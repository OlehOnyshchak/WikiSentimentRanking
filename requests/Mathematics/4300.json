In most [[English-speaking countries]], it is often written with a comma [[decimal mark#Digit grouping|separating]] the thousands unit: '''1,000'''. In analogy to the term ''century'' for {{nowrap|'100 years'}} the time lapse of 1,000 years is sometimes termed, after the Greek root, '''chiliad'''. A chiliad of other objects means 1,000 of them. \n\nIt may also be described as the '''short thousand''' in historical discussion of medieval contexts where it might be confused with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] concept of the \"[[long thousand]]\" (1200).\n\n== In mathematics ==\n* The decimal representation for one thousand is\n** '''1000'''—a [[1 (number)|one]] followed by three [[0 (number)|zeros]], in the general notation&nbsp;;\n** '''1 × 10<sup>3</sup>'''—in [[engineering notation]], which for this number coincides with&nbsp;:\n** '''1 × 10<sup>3</sup>''' exactly—in [[scientific notation|scientific normalized exponential notation]]&nbsp;;\n** '''1 E+3''' exactly—in [[scientific notation#E notation|scientific E notation]].\n* The [[SI]] [[SI prefix|prefix]] for a thousand is '''[[kilo-]]''', with the official symbol '''k'''—for instance, prefixed to \"metre\" or its symbol \"m\", kilometre or km signifies a thousand metres. As such, people occasionally represent the [[number]] in a non-standard notation by replacing the last three zeros of the general [[numerical digit|numeral]] with \"K\": for instance, 30K for 30,000.\n* By the [[SI#SI writing style|SI writing style]], a space can be used as a [[thousands separator]], i.e., to separate the digits of a number at every power of 1&nbsp;000.\n* The sum of [[Euler's totient function]] over the first 57 integers is 1000.\n* [http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php/1000.html Prime Curios!] mentions that 1000 is the smallest number that generates three primes in the fastest way possible by concatenation of decremented numbers (1000999, 1000999998997, and 1000999998997996995994993 are prime). The criterion excludes counting the number itself.\n* 1000 is a [[Harshad number]] in base 10.\n\n== In time ==\n* A [[millennium]] is 1,000 years. The year [[1000]] was the last year of the [[1st millennium]].\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* A ''grand'' is a [[slang]] term for one thousand units of a given [[currency]], usually [[dollar]]s or [[Pound (currency)|pound]]s. Several ''grand'' can be shortened to ''G''s.\n* The symbol ''K'' is sometimes used for a thousand; for example, in referring to units of salary or in reference to the [[Y2K]] computer bug.\n* Especially in the United States, the [[gambling]] community often refers to denominations of $1000 as ''[[wikt:dime|dimes]]''.\n* The idiom \"[[a picture is worth a thousand words]]\".\n* According to an ancient Japanese legend, anyone who folds a [[thousand origami cranes]] will be granted a wish by a crane.\n* The thousandth of something is often celebrated, as with other [[round numbers]].  A good example is a [[millennium]].\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\n* [[Thousand Oaks, California]]\n* Metal Mining [[Standard Industrial Classification|SIC Code]]\n* [[Thousand Island dressing]]\n* ''[[1000 Families: das Familienalbum des Planeten Erde]]'', a picture book by [[Uwe Ommer]]\n* [[Expedition of the Thousand]]\n\n==Music==\n* [[Thousand Foot Krutch]], an [[alternative rock]] band\n* [[I Feel It/Thousand]], a 1993 [[techno]] single by [[Moby]]\n* ''[[A Thousand Suns]]'', a 2010 album by [[Linkin Park]]\n* [[A Thousand Years (Christina Perri song)|A Thousand Years]], a 2011 song by [[Christina Perri]]\n* [[A Thousand Miles]], a 2002 song by [[Vanessa Carlton]]\n* [[A Thousand Answers]], a 2012 song by [[The Hives]]\n* [[1000hp]], a 2014 song by [[Godsmack]]\n\n== Selected numbers in the range 1001–1999 ==\n\n===1001 to 1099===\n:'''[[1001 (number)|1001]]''' – [[sphenic number]] (7 × 11 × 13), [[pentagonal number]], [[pentatope number]]\n:'''1002''' – sphenic number, [[Mertens function]] zero, [[abundant number]]\n:'''1004''' – [[heptanacci number]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A122189|title=Sloane's A122189 : Heptanacci numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref>\n:'''1005''' – Mertens function zero\n:'''1008''' – divisible by the number of primes below it\n:'''1009''' – smallest four-digit [[prime number|prime]], [[palindromic number|palindromic]] in bases 11, 15, 19, 24 and 28: (838<sub>11</sub>, 474<sub>15</sub>, 2F2<sub>19</sub>, 1I1<sub>24</sub>, 181<sub>28</sub>) \n:'''1010''' – Mertens function zero\n:'''1011''' – The largest number that 2<sup>n</sup> contains 101 and doesn't contain 11011, and it is a [[Harshad number]] in bases 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 (and 202 other bases).\n:'''1013''' – [[Sophie Germain prime]],<ref name=\"Sophie Germain\">{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005384|title=Sloane's A005384 : Sophie Germain primes|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref> [[centered square number]],<ref name=\"Centered square numbers\">{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001844|title=Sloane's A001844 : Centered square numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref> Mertens function zero\n:'''1014''' – Mertens function zero\n:'''1015''' – [[square pyramidal number]]<ref name=\"Square pyramidal numbers\">{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000330|title=Sloane's A000330 : Square pyramidal numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref>\n:'''1016''' – member of the [[Mian–Chowla sequence]],<ref name=Mian-Chowla>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005282|title=Sloane's A005282 : Mian-Chowla sequence|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref> [[stella octangula number]]\n:'''1018''' – Mertens function zero\n:'''1019''' – [[Sophie Germain prime]],<ref name=\"Sophie Germain\" /> [[safe prime]]<ref name=\"Safe primes\">{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005385|title=Sloane's A005385 : Safe primes|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref>\n:'''1020''' – [[polydivisible number]]\n:'''1022''' – [[Friedman number]]\n:'''1023''' – the highest number one can count to on one's fingers using binary;

[[Scheherazade number]]s always have 1001 as a factor.\n\n===Divisibility by 7, 11 and 13===\nTwo properties of 1001 are the basis of a divisibility test for 7, 11 and 13.  The method is along the same lines as the [[Divisibility rule#divisibility rule for 11|divisibility rule for 11]] using the property 10 ≡ &minus;1 (mod 11).  The two properties of 1001 are\n\n 1001 = 7 &times; 11 &times; 13 in prime factors\n 10<sup>3</sup> ≡ &minus;1 (mod 1001)\n\nThe method simultaneously tests for divisibility by any of the factors of 1001.  First, the digits of the number being tested are grouped in blocks of three.  The odd numbered groups are summed.

Using 2<sup>10''a''+''b''</sup> ≈ 2<sup>''b''</sup>10<sup>3''a''</sup> is fairly accurate for exponents up to about 100. For exponents up to 300, 3''a'' continues to be a good estimate of the number of digits.\n\nFor example, 2<sup>53</sup> ≈ 8×10<sup>15</sup>. The actual value is closer to 9×10<sup>15</sup>.\n\nIn the case of larger exponents, the relationship becomes increasingly inaccurate, with errors exceeding an order of magnitude for ''a'' ≥ 97. For example:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{2^{1000}}{10^{300}}\n&= \\exp \\left( \\ln \\left( \\frac{2^{1000}}{10^{300}} \\right) \\right) \\\\\n&= \\exp \\left( \\ln \\left( 2^{1000}\\right) - \\ln\\left(10^{300}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&\\approx \\exp\\left(693.147-690.776\\right)\\\\\n&\\approx \\exp\\left(2.372\\right)\\\\\n&\\approx 10.72\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn measuring [[byte]]s, 1024 is often used in place of 1000 as the quotients of the units [[byte]], [[kilobyte]], [[megabyte]], etc. In 1999, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] coined the term [[kibibyte]] for multiples of 1024, with kilobyte being used for multiples of 1000.\n\n== Special use in computers ==\nIn [[binary number|binary notation]], 1024 is represented as 10000000000, making it a simple [[round number]] occurring frequently in [[Computer science|computer]] [[Application software|applications]].\n\n1024 is the maximum number of computer [[memory address]]es that can be referenced with ten [[bit|binary switches]].

This allows it to be used as the basis for a [[Magician's Choice]]. For instance, one variation of the [[book test]] starts by having the spectator choose any two suitable numbers and then apply some basic math to produce a single four-digit number. That number is always 1089. The spectator is then asked to turn to page 108 of a book and read the 9th word, which the magician has memorized. To the audience it looks like the number is random, but through manipulation, the result is always the same. It is this property that led [[University of Oxford]] mathematician [[David Acheson (mathematician)|David Acheson]] to title his 2010 book '1089 and all that: a journey into mathematics'.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Acheson|first1=David|title=1089 and all that : a journey into mathematics|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199590028|edition=1. publ. in pbk.}}</ref>\n\nIn base 10, the following steps always yield 1089:\n# Take any three-digit number where the first and last digits differ by 2 or more.\n# Reverse the digits, and subtract the smaller from the larger one.\n# Add to this result the number produced by reversing its digits.\n\nFor example, if the spectator chooses 237 (or 732):\n\n: '''{{purple|7}}{{red|3}}{{orange|2}}''' &minus; '''{{orange|2}}{{red|3}}{{purple|7}}''' = '''{{green|4}}{{cyan|9}}{{blue|5}}'''\n: '''{{green|4}}{{cyan|9}}{{blue|5}}''' + '''{{blue|5}}{{cyan|9}}{{green|4}}''' = '''1089'''\n\n===Explanation===\nThe spectator's 3-digit number can be written as 100 &times; '''{{purple|A}}''' + 10 &times; '''{{red|B}}''' + 1 &times; '''{{orange|C}}''', and its reversal as 100 &times; '''{{orange|C}}''' + 10 &times; '''{{red|B}}''' + 1 &times; '''{{purple|A}}''', where 1 ≤ A ≤ 9, 0 ≤ B ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ C ≤ 9.

He remarks that this number can be divided by all the [[natural numbers|(natural) numbers]] from [[1 (number)|1]] to [[12 (number)|12]] with the single exception of [[11 (number)|11]] (however, it is not the smallest number to have this property; [[2520 (number)|2520]] is).  He rectifies this \"defect\" by suggesting that two families could be subtracted from the citizen body to produce the number 5038, which is [[divisible]] by 11.  Plato also took notice of the fact that 5040 can be divided by 12 twice over.  Indeed, Plato's repeated insistence on the use of 5040 for various state purposes is so evident that [[Benjamin Jowett]], in the introduction to his translation of ''Laws'', wrote, \"Plato, writing under [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] influences, seems really to have supposed that the well-being of the city depended almost as much on the number 5040 as on justice and moderation.\"<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1750/1750-h/1750-h.htm ''Laws''], by Plato, translated By Benjamin Jowett, at Project Gutenberg; retrieved 7 July 2009.</ref>\n\n[[Jean-Pierre Kahane]] has suggested that Plato's use of the number 5040 marks the first appearance of the concept of a [[highly composite number]], a number with more divisors than any smaller number.<ref>{{citation|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Kahane|authorlink=Jean-Pierre Kahane|title=Bernoulli convolutions and self-similar measures after Erdős: A personal hors d'oeuvre|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|date=February 2015|volume=62|issue=2|pages=136–140|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201502/rnoti-p121.pdf}}.</ref>\n\n==Number theoretical==\nIf <math>\\sigma(n)</math> is the [[divisor function]] and <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]], then 5040 is the largest of the known numbers {{OEIS| A067698}} for which this [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] holds:\n:<math>\\sigma(n) \\geq e^\\gamma n\\log \\log n </math>.\nThis is somewhat unusual, since in the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] we have:\n:<math>\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\sigma(n)}{n\\ \\log \\log n}=e^\\gamma.</math>\nGuy Robin showed in 1984 that the inequality fails for all larger numbers [[if and only if]] the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true.\n\n==Interesting notes==\n* 5040 has exactly 60 divisors, counting itself and 1.\n* 5040 is the largest [[factorial]] (7! = 5040) that is also a [[highly composite number]].

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n{{infobox number\n| number        = 69105\n}}\n\nThe [[number]] '''69,105''' was used as an [[in-joke]] at the [[computer game]] manufacturer [[Infocom]]. It has occasionally appeared in later computer games as a tribute to Infocom.\n\n==Significance of the number==\nThe number 69,105 makes a number of appearances in Infocom games. [[Nick Montfort]], in his book ''Twisty Little Passages'', suggests that the number was chosen not only because 69 is the [[69 (sex position)|common name of a sexual position]], but also because in its written form 69,105 falls naturally into two parts with an unusual relationship:<ref>{{cite book |last=Montfort |first=Nick |date=2003 |title=Twisty Little Passages - An Approach to Interactive Fiction |url= |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |page=104 |isbn=0-262-13436-5}}</ref>\n\n* 69 in [[hexadecimal]] is [[105 (number)|105]] in [[decimal]]\n* [[69 (number)|69]] in decimal is 105 in [[octal]]\n\nThis property was pointed out in a version of the [[Jargon File]] dating back at least to 1982. Commenting on the (\"Exclusive to [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT-AI]]\") usage of 69 as a generic \"large quantity\", [[Guy L. Steele]] said, \"I don't know whether its origins are related to the obscene interpretation, but I do know that 69 decimal = 105 octal, and 69 hexadecimal = 105 decimal, which is a nice property.\"<ref>http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.0.5.dos.txt</ref>\n\nThe same natural relationship applies to [[1001 (number)|1,001]]; 2,002; 3,003; 4,004; 5,005; 6,006; 7,007; 64,100; 65,101; 66,102; 67,103; and 68,104.\n\n==In mathematics==\n\n69105 is the third 23036-[[Polygonal number|gonal]] number and the fifth 6912-gonal number.

A typical [[car]] [[tire]] might rotate a million times in a {{convert|1200|mi|km|adj=on}} trip, while the engine would do several times that number of [[Revolutions per minute|revolutions]].\n* Fingers: If the [[finger (unit)|width of a human finger]] is {{convert|2.2|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}}, then a million fingers lined up would cover a distance of {{convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}. If a person walks at a speed of {{convert|4|km/h|abbr=on}}, it would take them approximately five and a half hours to reach the end of the fingers.\n* Area: A square a thousand objects or units on a side contains a million such objects or square units, so a million holes might be found in less than three square yards of window screen, or similarly, in about one half square foot (400–500&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) of bed sheet cloth. A city lot 70 by 100 feet is about a million square inches.\n* Volume: The cube root of one million is one hundred, so a million objects or cubic units is contained in a cube a hundred objects or linear units on a side. A million grains of [[table salt]] or granulated [[sugar]] occupies about {{convert|64|ml|abbr=on}}, the volume of a cube one hundred grains on a side. One million cubic inches would be the volume of a small room {{frac|8|1|3}}&nbsp;feet long by {{frac|8|1|3}}&nbsp;feet wide by {{frac|8|1|3}}&nbsp;feet high.\n* Mass: A million cubic millimeters (small droplets) of water would have a volume of one [[litre]] and a mass of one [[kilogram]]. A million millilitres or [[cubic centimetre]]s (one [[cubic metre]]) of water has a mass of a million [[gram]]s or one [[tonne]].\n* Weight: A million {{convert|80|mg|adj=on}} [[honey bee]]s would weigh the same as an {{convert|80|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} person.\n* Landscape: A [[pyramid]]al hill {{convert|600|ft|m}} wide at the base and {{convert|100|ft|m}} high would weigh about a million tons.\n* Computer: A [[display resolution]] of 1,280 by 800 [[pixel]]s contains 1,024,000 pixels.\n* Money: A [[Federal Reserve Note|USD bill]] of any denomination weighs {{convert|1|g}}. There are 454 grams in a pound. One million USD bills would weigh {{convert|2204.62|lb}}, or just over 1 ton.\n* Time: A million [[second]]s is 11.57 [[day]]s.\n\nIn [[Indian English]] and [[Pakistani English]], it is also expressed as 10 [[lakh]] or 10 Lac. Lakh is derived from 'laksh' for 100,000 in [[Sanskrit]]. \n \n[[File:One_million_dots_1080p.png|thumb|240px|One million black dots (pixels) &ndash; each tile with white or grey background contains

      "text": "{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Complex number that solves a monic polynomial with integer coefficients\n}}\n{{about|the ring of complex numbers integral over {{math|'''ℤ'''}}|the general notion of algebraic integer|Integrality}}\n{{Distinguish|algebraic element|algebraic number}}\n\nIn [[algebraic number theory]], an '''algebraic integer''' is a [[complex number]] that is a [[root of a function|root]] of some [[monic polynomial]] (a polynomial whose [[leading coefficient]] is 1) with coefficients in {{math|'''ℤ'''}} (the set of [[integer]]s). The set of all algebraic integers, {{mvar|A}}, is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication and therefore is a commutative [[subring]] of the complex numbers. The ring {{mvar|A}} is the [[integral closure]] of regular integers {{math|'''ℤ'''}} in complex numbers.\n\nThe [[ring of integers]] of a [[number field]] {{mvar|K}}, denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|O}}<sub>''K''</sub>}}, is the intersection of {{mvar|K}} and {{mvar|A}}: it can also be characterised as the maximal [[Order (ring theory)|order]] of the field {{mvar|K}}. Each algebraic integer belongs to the ring of integers of some number field. A number {{mvar|α}} is an algebraic integer [[if and only if]] the ring {{math|'''ℤ'''[''α'']}} is [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] as an [[Abelian group]], which is to say, as a [[Free Z-module|{{math|'''ℤ'''}}-module]].\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe following are equivalent definitions of an algebraic integer. Let {{mvar|K}} be a [[number field]] (i.e., a [[finite extension]] of {{math|'''ℚ'''}}, the set of [[rational number]]s), in other words, {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''ℚ'''(''θ'')}} for some algebraic number {{math|''θ'' ∈ '''ℂ'''}} by the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n* {{math|''α'' ∈ ''K''}} is an algebraic integer if there exists a monic polynomial {{math|''f''(''x'') ∈ '''ℤ'''[''x'']}} such that {{math|''f''(''α'') {{=}} 0}}.\n* {{math|''α'' ∈ ''K''}} is an algebraic integer if the minimal monic polynomial of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|'''ℚ'''}} is in {{math|'''ℤ'''[''x'']}}.\n* {{math|''α'' ∈ ''K''}} is an algebraic integer if {{math|'''ℤ'''[''α'']}} is a finitely generated {{math|'''ℤ'''}}-module.\n* {{math|''α'' ∈ ''K''}} is an algebraic integer if there exists a non-zero finitely generated {{math|'''ℤ'''}}-submodule {{math|''M'' ⊂ '''ℂ'''}} such that {{math|''αM'' ⊆ ''M''}}.\n\nAlgebraic integers are a special case of [[integral element]]s of a ring extension. In particular, an algebraic integer is an integral element of a finite extension {{math|''K''/'''ℚ'''}}.\n\n==Examples==\n* The only algebraic integers which are found in the set of [[rational numbers]] are the integers. In other words, the intersection of {{math|'''ℚ'''}} and {{mvar|A}} is exactly {{math|'''ℤ'''}}. The rational number {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is not an algebraic integer unless {{mvar|b}} divides {{mvar|a}}. Note that the leading coefficient of the polynomial {{math|''bx'' − ''a''}} is the integer {{mvar|b}}. As another special case, the square root {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} of a nonnegative integer {{mvar|n}} is an algebraic integer, but is irrational unless {{mvar|n}} is a [[square number|perfect square]].\n\n*If {{mvar|d}} is a [[square-free integer]] then the extension {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''ℚ'''({{sqrt|''d''}})}} is a [[quadratic field extension|quadratic field]] of rational numbers. The ring of algebraic integers {{math|{{mathcal|O}}<sub>''K''</sub>}} contains {{math|{{sqrt|''d''}}}} since this is a root of the monic polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''d''}}. Moreover, if {{math|''d'' ≡ 1 [[Modulo operation|mod]] 4}}, then the element {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + {{sqrt|''d''}})}} is also an algebraic integer. It satisfies the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' + {{sfrac|1|4}}(1 − ''d'')}} where the [[constant term]] {{math|{{sfrac|1|4}}(1 − ''d'')}} is an integer. The full ring of integers is generated by {{math|{{sqrt|''d''}}}} or {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + {{sqrt|''d''}})}} respectively. See [[quadratic integer]]s for more.\n\n*The ring of integers of the field {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''ℚ'''[''α'']}}, {{math|''α'' {{=}} {{radic|''m''|3}}}}, has the following [[integral basis]], writing {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''hk''<sup>2</sup>}} for two square-free coprime integers {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|k}}:<ref>{{cite book| last1=Marcus | first1=Daniel A. | title=Number Fields |edition=3rd | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-90279-1 | year=1977 |at=ch. 2, p. 38 and ex. 41}}</ref>\n::<math>\\begin{cases}\n1, \\alpha, \\dfrac{\\alpha^2 \\pm k^2 \\alpha + k^2}{3k} & m \\equiv \\pm 1 \\bmod 9 \\\\\n1, \\alpha, \\dfrac{\\alpha^2}k  & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n* If {{mvar|ζ<sub>n</sub>}} is a primitive {{mvar|n}}th [[root of unity]], then the ring of integers of the [[cyclotomic field]] {{math|'''ℚ'''(''ζ<sub>n</sub>'')}} is precisely {{math|'''ℤ'''[''ζ<sub>n</sub>'']}}.\n\n* If {{mvar|α}} is an algebraic integer then {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{radic|''α''|''n''}}}} is another algebraic integer. A polynomial for {{mvar|β}} is obtained by substituting {{math|''x<sup>n</sup>''}} in the polynomial for {{mvar|α}}.\n\n==Non-example==\n* If {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is a [[Primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive polynomial]] which has integer coefficients but is not monic, and {{mvar|P}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''ℚ'''}}, then none of the roots of {{mvar|P}} are algebraic integers (but ''are'' [[algebraic numbers]]). Here ''primitive'' is used in the sense that the [[highest common factor]] of the set of coefficients of {{mvar|P}} is 1; this is weaker than requiring the coefficients to be pairwise relatively prime.\n\n==Facts==\n* The sum, difference and product of two algebraic integers is an algebraic integer. In general their quotient is not. The monic polynomial involved is generally of higher [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] than those of the original algebraic integers, and can be found by taking [[resultant]]s and factoring. For example, if {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' − 1}}, {{math|''y''<sup>3</sup> − ''y'' − 1}} and {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''xy''}}, then eliminating {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} from {{math|''z'' − ''xy''}} and the polynomials satisfied by {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} using the resultant gives {{math|''z''<sup>6</sup> − 3''z''<sup>4</sup> − 4''z''<sup>3</sup> + ''z''<sup>2</sup> + ''z'' − 1}}, which is irreducible, and is the monic polynomial satisfied by the product. (To see that the {{mvar|xy}} is a root of the {{mvar|x}}-resultant of {{math|''z'' − ''xy''}} and {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' − 1}}, one might use the fact that the resultant is contained in the ideal generated by its two input polynomials.)\n* Any number constructible out of the integers with roots, addition, and multiplication is therefore an algebraic integer; but not all algebraic integers are so constructible: in a naïve sense, most roots of irreducible [[quintic]]s are not. This is the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]. <!-- what is the meaning of \"most\" roots of irreducible quintics? By counting, there are as many non-solvable as solvable quintics. Are coefficients of the quintic taken \"randomly\" from the integers? There ain't no such \"random\" integer! //--><!--How about this: Consider irreducible quintics of degree n, with integer coefficients with absolute value <= a. Does the proportion of them that are solvable not approach 0 as n and a go to infinitely, whether separately or together?-->\n* Every root of a monic polynomial whose coefficients are algebraic integers is itself an algebraic integer. In other words, the algebraic integers form a ring which is [[integrally closed domain|integrally closed]] in any of its extensions.\n* The ring of algebraic integers is a [[Bézout domain]], as a consequence of the [[principal ideal theorem]].\n* If the monic polynomial associated with an algebraic integer has constant term 1 or -1, then the reciprocal of that algebraic integer is also an algebraic integer, and is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], an element of the [[group of units]] of the ring of algebraic integers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Integral element]]\n*[[Gaussian integer]]\n*[[Eisenstein integer]]\n*[[Root of unity]]\n*[[Dirichlet's unit theorem]]\n*[[Fundamental unit (number theory)|Fundamental units]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|first=W. |last=Stein |title=Algebraic Number Theory: A Computational Approach |url=http://wstein.org/books/ant/ant.pdf}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Algebraic numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Algebraic numbers]]\n[[Category:Integers]]"

Because cube is an odd function, this curve has a [[Point reflection|point of symmetry]] in the origin, but no [[axis of symmetry]].\n\n==In integers==\nA '''cube number''', or a '''perfect cube''', or sometimes just a '''cube''', is a number which is the cube of an [[integer]].\nThe perfect cubes up to 60<sup>3</sup> are {{OEIS|id=A000578}}:\n\n{| style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 0<sup>3</sup> = || 0\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 1<sup>3</sup> = || 1\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|11<sup>3</sup> = || 1331\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|21<sup>3</sup> = || 9261\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|31<sup>3</sup> = || 29,791\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|41<sup>3</sup> = || 68,921\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|51<sup>3</sup> = || 132,651\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 2<sup>3</sup> = || 8\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|12<sup>3</sup> = || 1728\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|22<sup>3</sup> = || 10,648\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|32<sup>3</sup> = || 32,768\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|42<sup>3</sup> = || 74,088\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|52<sup>3</sup> = || 140,608\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 3<sup>3</sup> = || 27\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|13<sup>3</sup> = || 2197\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|23<sup>3</sup> = || 12,167\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|33<sup>3</sup> = || 35,937\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|43<sup>3</sup> = || 79,507\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|53<sup>3</sup> = || 148,877\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 4<sup>3</sup> = || 64\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|14<sup>3</sup> = || 2744\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|24<sup>3</sup> = || 13,824\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|34<sup>3</sup> = || 39,304\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|44<sup>3</sup> = || 85,184\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|54<sup>3</sup> = || 157,464\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 5<sup>3</sup> = || 125\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|15<sup>3</sup> = || 3375\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|25<sup>3</sup> = || 15,625\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|35<sup>3</sup> = || 42,875\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|45<sup>3</sup> = || 91,125\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|55<sup>3</sup> = || 166,375\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 6<sup>3</sup> = || 216\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|16<sup>3</sup> = || 4096\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|26<sup>3</sup> = || 17,576\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|36<sup>3</sup> = || 46,656\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|46<sup>3</sup> = || 97,336\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|56<sup>3</sup> = || 175,616\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 7<sup>3</sup> = || 343\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|17<sup>3</sup> = || 4913\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|27<sup>3</sup> = || 19,683\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|37<sup>3</sup> = || 50,653\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|47<sup>3</sup> = || 103,823\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|57<sup>3</sup> = || 185,193\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 8<sup>3</sup> = || 512\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|18<sup>3</sup> = || 5832\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|28<sup>3</sup> = || 21,952\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|38<sup>3</sup> = || 54,872\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|48<sup>3</sup> = || 110,592\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|58<sup>3</sup> = || 195,112\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"| 9<sup>3</sup> = || 729\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|19<sup>3</sup> = || 6859\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|29<sup>3</sup> = || 24,389\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|39<sup>3</sup> = || 59,319\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|49<sup>3</sup> = || 117,649\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|59<sup>3</sup> = || 205,379\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|10<sup>3</sup> = || 1000\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|20<sup>3</sup> = || 8000\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|30<sup>3</sup> = || 27,000\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|40<sup>3</sup> = || 64,000\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|50<sup>3</sup> = || 125,000\n| style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|60<sup>3</sup> = || 216,000\n|}\n\nGeometrically speaking, a positive integer {{mvar|m}} is a perfect cube [[if and only if]] one can arrange {{mvar|m}} solid unit cubes into a larger, solid cube. For example, 27 small cubes can be arranged into one larger one with the appearance of a [[Rubik's Cube]], since {{nowrap|3 × 3 × 3 {{=}} 27}}.\n\nThe difference between the cubes of consecutive integers can be expressed as follows:\n\n:{{math|size=120%|1=''n''<sup>3</sup> − (''n'' − 1)<sup>3</sup> = 3(''n'' − 1)''n'' + 1}}.\n\nor\n\n:{{math|size=120%|1=(''n'' + 1)<sup>3</sup> − ''n''<sup>3</sup> =  3(''n'' + 1)''n'' + 1}}.\n\nThere is no minimum perfect cube, since the cube of a negative integer is negative. For example, {{nowrap|(−4) × (−4) × (−4) {{=}} −64}}.\n\n===Base ten===\n\nUnlike [[square number|perfect squares]], perfect cubes do not have a small number of possibilities for the last two digits. Except for cubes divisible by 5, where only '''25''', '''75''' and '''00''' can be the last two digits, ''any'' pair of digits with the last digit odd can be a perfect cube. With [[Even and odd numbers|even]] cubes, there is considerable restriction, for only '''00''', {{math|''o''}}'''2''', {{math|''e''}}'''4''', {{math|''o''}}'''6''' and {{math|''e''}}'''8''' can be the last two digits of a perfect cube (where {{math|''o''}} stands for any odd digit and {{math|''e''}} for any even digit). Some cube numbers are also square numbers; for example, 64 is a square number {{nowrap|(8 × 8)}} and a cube number {{nowrap|(4 × 4 × 4)}}. This happens if and only if the number is a perfect sixth power (in this case 2{{sup|6}}).\n\nThe last digits of each 3rd power are:\n\n{| width=\"45%\"\n|| 0 || 1 || 8 || 7 || 4 || 5 || 6 ||3 ||2 ||9 ||\n|}\n\nIt is, however, easy to show that most numbers are not perfect cubes because ''all'' perfect cubes must have [[digital root]] '''1''', '''8''' or '''9'''. That is their values [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 9 may be only −1, 1 and 0. Moreover, the digital root of any number's cube can be determined by the remainder the number gives when divided by 3:\n* If the number ''x'' is divisible by 3, its cube has digital root 9; that is, \n:: <math>\\text{if}\\quad x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad x^3\\equiv 0 \\pmod 9;</math>\n* If it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 1; that is, \n:: <math>\\text{if}\\quad x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad x^3\\equiv 1 \\pmod 9;</math>\n* If it has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 8; that is, \n:: <math>\\text{if}\\quad x \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad x^3\\equiv -1 \\pmod 9.</math>\n\n===Waring's problem for cubes===\n{{main article|Waring's problem}}\n\nEvery positive integer can be written as the sum of nine (or fewer) positive cubes. This upper limit of nine cubes cannot be reduced because, for example, 23 cannot be written as the sum of fewer than nine positive cubes:\n\n:23 = 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup>.\n\n===Sums of three cubes===\n\nIt is conjectured that every integer (positive or negative) not [[modular arithmetic|congruent]] to {{math|±4}} modulo {{math|9}} can be written as a sum of three (positive or negative) cubes,<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Huisman |first=Sander G. |author-link= |eprint=1604.07746 |title=Newer sums of three cubes |class=math.NT |date=27 Apr 2016 }}</ref> for example, <math> 6 = 2^3+(-1)^3+(-1)^3</math>.

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\nThe '''digital sum in base ''b''''' of a set of [[natural number]]s is calculated as follows: express each of the numbers in [[numeral system|base ''b'']], then take the sum of corresponding digits and discard all carry overs. That is, the digital sum is the same as the normal sum except that no carrying is used.\n\nFor example, in [[decimal]] (base 10) arithmetic, the digital sum of 123 and 789 is 802:\n*3 + 9 = 12, discard the 10 leaving 2.\n*2 + 8 = 10, discard the 10 leaving 0.\n*1 + 7 = 8, there is no carry to discard.\n 123\n 789\n ---\n 802\n\nMore usually the digital sum is calculated in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] (base 2) where the result only depends upon whether there are an even or odd number of '''1'''s in each column. This is the same function as [[parity bit#Parity|parity]] or multiple [[exclusive or]]s.\n\nFor example:\n 011 (3)\n 100 (4)\n 101 (5)\n ---\n 010 (2) is the binary digital sum of 3, 4 and 5.\n\nThe binary digital sum is crucial for the theory of the game of [[nim]].\n\nThe digital sum in base ''b'' is an [[associative]] and [[commutative]] [[binary operation|operation]] on the [[natural number]]s; it has 0 as [[neutral element]] and every natural number has an [[inverse element]] under this operation. The natural numbers together with the base-''b'' digital sum thus form an [[abelian group]]; this group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[direct sum of abelian groups|direct sum]] of a [[Countable set|countable]] number of copies of [[modular arithmetic|'''Z'''/''b'''''Z''']].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Digital Sum In Base B}}\n[[Category:Integers]]"

Twelve is convenient because it has the most [[divisor]]s of any number under 18. \n\nThe use of twelve as a base number, known as the [[duodecimal]] system (also as ''dozenal''), originated in [[Mesopotamia]] (see also [[sexagesimal]]). This could come from counting on one's fingers by counting each finger bone with one's thumb.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Using this method, one hand can count to twelve, and two hands can count to 144. Twelve dozen (12<sup>2</sup> = [[144 (number)|144]]) are known as a [[gross (unit)|gross]]; and twelve gross (12<sup>3</sup> = [[1728 (number)|1,728]], the duodecimal 1,000) are called a [[great gross]], a term most often used when shipping or buying items in bulk. A [[great hundred]], also known as a [[small gross]], is [[120 (number)|120]] or [[10 (number)|ten]] dozen. \n\nA baker's dozen, also known as a big or long dozen, is [[13 (number)|13]]. Varying by country, some products are packaged or sold by the dozen, often foodstuff (a dozen eggs). Dozen may also be used to express a large number of items as in \"several dozen\" (ex. dozens of people came to the party).<ref>Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 2013, Procter, Paul 1408267667</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''dozen'' comes from the old form ''douzaine'', a [[French language|French]] word meaning \"a group of twelve\" (''\"Assemblage de choses de même nature au nombre de douze\"''(translation: ''A group of twelve things of the same nature'' as defined in the eighth edition of the [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/24/D0372400.html |title=Bartleby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210005528/http://www.bartleby.com/61/24/D0372400.html |archivedate=December 10, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dozen | title =Dozen | work = Free Dictionary | publisher = Merriam-Webster | accessdate= 2011-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/dozen?view=uk | work =Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Ask Oxford |title=dozen |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref> This French word<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.patrimoine-de-france.org/mots/mots-acade-30-14691.html#mot-2 |title = Douzain, Douzaine, Douze, Douze-huit, Douzième, Douzièmement, Dox(o)-, Doxographe, Doxologie, Doyen | publisher = Patrimoine de France |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref> is a derivation from the [[cardinal number]] ''douze'' (\"twelve\", from [[Latin]] ''duodĕcim'') and the [[collective number|collective]] [[suffix]] ''-aine'' (from Latin ''-ēna''), a suffix also used to form other words with similar meanings such as ''quinzaine'' (a group of fifteen), ''vingtaine'' (a group of twenty), ''centaine'' (a group of one hundred), etc. These French words have synonymous [[cognate]]s in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''docena'',<ref>{{cite web| url= http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=docena | publisher =Real Academia Española | work = Diccionario Usual | language= Spanish| title = docena |accessdate= 2011-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=doce |title= doce | publisher = Real Academia Española | work = Diccionario Usual | language= Spanish| accessdate = 2011-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=-ena | title = ‐ena | publisher = Real Academia Española | work = Diccionario Usual |language= Spanish|accessdate= 2011-10-28}}</ref> ''quincena'', ''veintena'', ''centena'', etc. English ''dozen'', French ''douzaine'', Catalan ''dotzena'', Persian dowjin \"دوجین\", Arabic durzen \"درزن\", Turkish \"düzine\", German ''Dutzend'', Dutch ''dozijn'', Italian ''dozzina'' and Polish ''tuzin'', are also used as indefinite [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] to mean \"about twelve\" or \"many\" (as in \"a dozen times\", \"dozens of people\").\n\nA confusion may arise with the Anglo-Norman ''dizeyne'' (French ''dixaine'' or ''dizaine'') a tithing, or group of ten households<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Oxford | title = English Dictionary | contribution = meaning #4}}.</ref> — dating from the late Anglo-Saxon system of grouping households into tens and hundreds for the purposes of law, order and mutual surety (see [[Tithing]]).

However, it is useful when comparing with other very large quantities such as the number of [[subatomic particles]] in the visible universe or the number of hypothetical possibilities in a [[chess]] game. Kasner used it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and [[infinity]], and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics. To give a sense of how big a googol really is, the mass of an electron, just under {{val|e=-30|u=kg}}, can be compared to the mass of the visible universe, estimated at between {{val|e=50}} and {{val|e=60|u=kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elert, Glenn|title=Mass of the Universe|url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/KristineMcPherson.shtml|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723000000/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/KristineMcPherson.shtml|archivedate=2017-07-23|df=}}</ref> It is a ratio in the order of about 10<sup>80</sup> to 10<sup>90</sup>, or only about one ten-billionth of a googol (0.00000001% of a googol).\n\n[[Carl Sagan]] pointed out that the total number of elementary particles in the universe is around 10<sup>80</sup> (the [[Eddington number]]) and that if the whole universe were packed with neutrons so that there would be no empty space anywhere, there would be around 10<sup>128</sup>. He also noted the similarity of the second calculation to that of [[Archimedes]] in ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''. By Archimedes's calculation, the universe of Aristarchus (roughly 2 light years in diameter), if fully packed with sand, would contain 10<sup>63</sup> grains. If the much larger observable universe of today were filled with sand, it would still only equal 10<sup>95</sup> grains. Another 100,000 observable universes filled with sand would be necessary to make a googol.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|year=1981|publisher=Book Club Associates|pages=220–221}}</ref>\n\nThe decay time for a supermassive [[black hole]] of roughly 1 galaxy-mass (10<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;[[solar mass]]es) due to [[Hawking radiation]] is on the order of 10<sup>100</sup>&nbsp;years.<ref name=page>Particle emission rates from a black hole: Massless particles from an uncharged, nonrotating hole, Don N.

      "text": "{{short description|Enormously large number, the upper bound solution to a Ramsey theory problem}}\n{{About|the large number named after Ronald Graham|the investing term named after Benjamin Graham|Graham number}}\n'''Graham's number''' is an [[Large numbers|immense number]] that arises as an [[upper bound]] on the answer of a problem in the mathematical field of [[Ramsey theory]]. It is named after mathematician [[Ronald Graham]], who used the number as a simplified explanation of the upper bounds of the problem he was working on in conversations with [[popular science]] writer [[Martin Gardner]]. Gardner later described the number in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1977, introducing it to the general public.  At the time of its introduction, it was the largest specific positive integer ever to have been used in a published mathematical proof.  The number was published in the 1980 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', adding to its popular interest.  Other specific integers (such as [[Kruskal's tree theorem#TREE(3)|TREE(3)]]) known to be far larger than Graham's number have since appeared in many serious mathematical proofs, for example in connection with [[Harvey Friedman]]'s various finite forms of [[Kruskal's theorem#Friedman's finite form|Kruskal's theorem]]. Additionally, smaller upper bounds on the Ramsey theory problem from which Graham's number derived have since been proven to be valid.\n\nGraham's number is much larger than many other [[large numbers]] such as [[Skewes' number]] and [[Moser's number]], both of which are in turn much larger than a [[googolplex]]. As with these, it is so large that the [[observable universe]] is far too small to contain an ordinary [[Numerical digit|digital representation]] of Graham's number, assuming that each digit occupies one [[Planck units#Derived units|Planck volume]], possibly the smallest measurable space. But even the number of digits in this digital representation of Graham's number would itself be a number so large that its digital representation cannot be represented in the observable universe.  Nor even can the number of digits of ''that'' number—and so forth, for a number of times far exceeding the total number of Planck volumes in the observable universe. Thus Graham's number cannot even be expressed in this way by [[Tetration|power towers]] of the form <math>a ^{ b ^{ c ^{ \\cdot ^{ \\cdot ^{ \\cdot}}}}}</math>.  \n\nHowever, Graham's number can be explicitly given by [[computable function|computable]] recursive formulas using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] or equivalent, as was done by Graham.  As there is a recursive formula to define it, it is much smaller than typical [[busy beaver]] numbers.  Though too large to be computed in full, the sequence of digits of Graham's number can be computed explicitly through simple algorithms. The last 12 digits are ...262464195387.

According to physicist [[John C. Baez|John Baez]], Graham invented the quantity now known as Graham's number in conversation with Gardner. While Graham was trying to explain a result in Ramsey theory which he had derived with his collaborator [[Bruce Lee Rothschild]], Graham found that the said quantity was easier to explain than the actual number appearing in the proof. Because the number which Graham described to Gardner is larger than the number in the paper itself, both are valid upper bounds for the solution to the problem studied by Graham and Rothschild.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/KJTgfjkTZCQ | author = [[John C.

In other words, ''G'' is calculated in 64 steps: the first step is to calculate ''g''<sub>1</sub> with four up-arrows between 3s; the second step is to calculate ''g''<sub>2</sub> with ''g''<sub>1</sub> up-arrows between 3s; the third step is to calculate ''g''<sub>3</sub> with ''g''<sub>2</sub> up-arrows between 3s; and so on, until finally calculating ''G'' = ''g''<sub>64</sub> with ''g''<sub>63</sub> up-arrows between 3s.\n\nEquivalently,\n<math display=\"block\">G = f^{64}(4),\\text{ where }f(n) = 3 \\uparrow^n 3,</math>\n\nand the superscript on ''f'' indicates an [[Iterated function|iteration of the function]], e.g., <math> f^4(n) = f(f(f(f(n))))</math>.  Expressed in terms of the family of [[hyperoperation]]s <math> \\text{H}_0, \\text{H}_1, \\text{H}_2, \\cdots</math>, the function ''f'' is the particular sequence <math>f(n) = \\text{H}_{n+2}(3,3)</math>, which is a version of the rapidly growing [[Ackermann function]] ''A''(''n'', ''n''). (In fact, <math>f(n) > A(n, n)</math> for all ''n''.)  The function ''f'' can also be expressed in [[Conway chained arrow notation#Graham's number|Conway chained arrow notation]] as <math>f(n) = 3 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow n</math>, and this notation also provides the following bounds on ''G'':\n\n<math display=\"block\"> 3\\rightarrow 3\\rightarrow 64\\rightarrow 2 < G < 3\\rightarrow 3\\rightarrow 65\\rightarrow 2.</math>\n\n===Magnitude===\nTo convey the difficulty of appreciating the enormous size of Graham's number, it may be helpful to express—in terms of exponentiation alone—just the first term (''g''<sub>1</sub>) of the rapidly growing 64-term sequence.  First, in terms of [[tetration]] (<math> \\uparrow\\uparrow</math>) alone:\n<math display=\"block\">\n g_1\n  = 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3\n  = 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow (3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3)\n  = 3 \\uparrow\\uparrow (3 \\uparrow\\uparrow (3 \\uparrow\\uparrow \\ \\dots \\ (3 \\uparrow\\uparrow 3) \\dots ))\n</math>\n\nwhere the number of 3s in the expression on the right is\n<math display=\"block\">3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3  =  3 \\uparrow \\uparrow (3 \\uparrow \\uparrow 3).</math>\n\nNow each tetration (<math>\\uparrow\\uparrow</math>) operation reduces to a power tower (<math>\\uparrow</math>) according to the definition\n<math display=\"block\">3 \\uparrow\\uparrow X  =  3 \\uparrow (3 \\uparrow (3 \\uparrow \\dots (3 \\uparrow 3) \\dots ))  =  3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}</math> where there are ''X'' 3s.\n\nThus,\n<math display=\"block\">\n g_1\n  = 3 \\uparrow\\uparrow (3 \\uparrow\\uparrow (3 \\uparrow\\uparrow \\ \\dots \\ (3 \\uparrow\\uparrow 3) \\dots ))\n  \\quad \\text{where the number of 3s is}\n  \\quad 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow (3 \\uparrow \\uparrow 3)\n</math>\n\nbecomes, solely in terms of repeated \"exponentiation towers\",\n<math display=\"block\">\n g_1 =\n  \\left.\n    \\begin{matrix}3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}}\\end{matrix}\n  \\right \\}\n  \\left.\n    \\begin{matrix}3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}\\end{matrix}\n  \\right \\}\n    \\dots\n  \\left.\n    \\begin{matrix}3^{3^3}\\end{matrix}\n  \\right \\}\n    3\n  \\quad \\text{where the number of towers is} \\quad\n  \\left.\n    \\begin{matrix}3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}\\end{matrix}\n  \\right \\}\n  \\left.\n    \\begin{matrix}3^{3^3}\\end{matrix}\n  \\right \\}\n    3\n</math>\n\nand where the number of 3s in each tower, starting from the leftmost tower, is specified by the value of the next tower to the right.\n\nIn other words, ''g''<sub>1</sub> is computed by first calculating the number of towers, <math> n = 3\\uparrow 3\\uparrow 3\\ \\dots\\ \\uparrow 3</math> (where the number of 3s is <math> 3\\uparrow 3\\uparrow 3 = 7625597484987</math>), and then computing the ''n''<sup>th</sup> tower in the following sequence:\n\n       1st tower:  <u>3</u>\n      \n       2nd tower:  3↑3↑3 (number of 3s is <u>3</u>) = <u>7625597484987</u>\n      \n       3rd tower:  3↑3↑3↑3↑...↑3 (number of 3s is <u>7625597484987</u>) = …\n      \n       ⋮\n      \n  ''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''n''<sup>th</sup> tower:  3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑...↑3 (number of 3s is given by the <u>''n-1''<sup>th</sup> tower</u>)\n\nwhere the number of 3s in each successive tower is given by the tower just before it.  Note that the result of calculating the third tower is the value of ''n'', the number of towers for ''g''<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe magnitude of this first term, ''g''<sub>1</sub>, is so large that it is practically incomprehensible, even though the above display is relatively easy to comprehend.  Even ''n'', the mere ''number of towers'' in this formula for ''g''<sub>1</sub>, is far greater than the number of Planck volumes (roughly 10<sup>185</sup> of them) into which one can imagine subdividing the [[observable universe]]. And after this first term, still another 63 terms remain in the rapidly growing ''g'' sequence before Graham's number ''G'' = ''g''<sub>64</sub> is reached. To illustrate just how fast this sequence grows, while ''g''<sub>1</sub> is equal to <math>3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3</math> with only four up arrows, the number of up arrows in ''g''<sub>2</sub> is this incomprehensibly large number ''g''<sub>1</sub>.\n\n==Rightmost decimal digits==\nGraham's number is a \"power tower\" of the form 3↑↑''n'' (with a very large value of ''n''), so its rightmost decimal digits must satisfy certain properties common to all such towers.  One of these properties is that ''all such towers of height greater than d (say), have the same sequence of d rightmost decimal digits''. This is a special case of a more general property: The ''d'' rightmost decimal digits of all such towers of height greater than ''d''+2, are ''independent'' of the topmost \"3\" in the tower; i.e., the topmost \"3\" can be changed to any other [[Non-negative number|non-negative]] integer without affecting the ''d'' rightmost digits.\n\nThe following table illustrates, for a few values of ''d'', how this happens.  For a given height of tower and number of digits ''d'', the full range of ''d''-digit numbers (10<sup>''d''</sup> of them) does ''not'' occur; instead, a certain smaller subset of values repeats itself in a cycle.  The length of the cycle and some of the values (in parentheses) are shown in each cell of this table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ Number of different possible values of 3↑3↑…3↑''x'' when all but the rightmost ''d'' decimal digits are ignored <br>\n! style=\"width:150pt;\"| Number of digits (''d'') !! style=\"width:40pt;\"| 3↑''x'' !! style=\"width:60pt;\"| 3↑3↑''x'' !! style=\"width:80pt;\"| 3↑3↑3↑''x'' !! style=\"width:100pt;\"| 3↑3↑3↑3↑''x'' !! style=\"width:120pt;\"| 3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑''x''\n|-\n! 1\n| 4 <br> (1,3,9,'''7''') || 2 <br> (3,'''7''') || style=\"background:#05FFD3;\" | 1 <br> ('''7''')|| style=\"background:#05FFD3;\" | 1 <br> ('''7''') || style=\"background:#05FFD3;\" | 1 <br> ('''7''')\n|-\n! 2\n| 20  <br> (01,03,…,'''87''',…,67) || 4 <br> (03,27,83,'''87''') || 2 <br> (27,'''87''') || style=\"background:#05FFD3;\" | 1 <br> ('''87''') || style=\"background:#05FFD3;\" | 1 <br> ('''87''')\n|-\n! 3\n| 100 <br> (001,003,…,'''387''',…,667) || 20 <br> (003,027,…'''387''',…,587) || 4 <br> (027,987,227,'''387''')|| 2 <br> (987,'''387''') || style=\"background:#05FFD3;\" | 1 <br> ('''387''')\n|}\n\nThe particular rightmost ''d'' digits that are ultimately shared by all sufficiently tall towers of 3s are in bold text, and can be seen developing as the tower height increases.  For any fixed number of digits ''d'' (row in the table), the number of values possible for 3<math>\\scriptstyle\\uparrow</math>3↑…3↑''x'' mod 10<sup>''d''</sup>, as ''x'' ranges over all nonnegative integers, is seen to decrease steadily as the height increases, until eventually reducing the \"possibility set\" to a single number (colored cells) when the height exceeds ''d''+2.\n\nA simple algorithm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51625.html |title=The Math Forum @ Drexel (\"Last Eight Digits of Z\") |publisher=Mathforum.org |accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref> for computing these digits may be described as follows: let x = 3, then iterate, ''d'' times, the [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] ''x'' = 3<sup>''x''</sup> mod 10<sup>''d''</sup>. Except for omitting any leading 0s, the final value assigned to ''x'' (as a base-ten numeral) is then composed of the ''d'' rightmost decimal digits of 3↑↑''n'', for all ''n'' > ''d''.  (If the final value of ''x'' has fewer than ''d'' digits, then the required number of leading 0s must be added.)\n\nLet ''k'' be the numerousness of these ''stable'' digits, which satisfy the congruence relation G(mod 10<sup>''k''</sup>)≡[G<sup>G</sup>](mod 10<sup>''k''</sup>).\n\n''k''=''t''-1, where G(''t''):=3↑↑''t''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ripà, Marco |year=2011|title=La strana coda della serie n^n^...^n|isbn=978-88-6178-789-6|publisher=UNI Service |language=it }}</ref> It follows that, {{nowrap|g<sub>63</sub> ≪ k ≪ g<sub>64</sub>}}.\n\nThe algorithm above produces the following 500 rightmost decimal digits of Graham's number (or of any tower of more than 500 3s):\n\n ...02425950695064738395657479136519351798334535362521\n    43003540126026771622672160419810652263169355188780\n    38814483140652526168785095552646051071172000997092\n    91249544378887496062882911725063001303622934916080\n    25459461494578871427832350829242102091825896753560\n    43086993801689249889268099510169055919951195027887\n    17830837018340236474548882222161573228010132974509\n    27344594504343300901096928025352751833289884461508\n    94042482650181938515625357963996189939679054966380\n    03222348723967018485186439059104575627262464195387\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite journal|author=Gardner, Martin|title=Mathematical Games|journal= Scientific American|volume=237|issue=5|pages=18–28|date=November 1977|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v237/n5/pdf/scientificamerican1177-18.pdf|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1177-18|bibcode=1977SciAm.237e..18G}}; reprinted (revised) in Gardner (2001), cited below.\n* {{cite book|year=1989|title=Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers|isbn=978-0-88385-521-8|first=Martin|last=Gardner |authorlink= Martin Gardner|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|location=Washington, D.C.}}\n* {{cite book|year=2001|title=The Colossal Book of Mathematics: Classic Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Problems|isbn=978-0-393-02023-6|first=Martin|last=Gardner |authorlink= Martin Gardner|publisher=Norton|location=New York, NY}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Graham, R.

      "title": "Integer literal",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_literal",
      "text": "In [[computer science]], an '''integer literal''' is a kind of [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] for an [[integer]] whose [[Value (computer science)|value]] is directly represented in [[source code]]. For example, in the assignment statement <code>x = 1</code>, the string <code>1</code> is an integer literal indicating the value 1, while in the statement <code>x = 0x10</code> the string <code>0x10</code> is an integer literal indicating the value 16, which is represented by <code>10</code> in hexadecimal (indicated by the <code>0x</code> prefix).\n\nBy contrast, in <code>x = cos(0)</code>, the expression <code>cos(0)</code> evaluates to 1 (as the [[cosine]] of 0), but the value 1 is not ''literally'' included in the source code. More simply, in <code>x = 2 + 2,</code> the expression <code>2 + 2</code> evaluates to 4, but the value 4 is not literally included. Further, in <code>x = \"1\"</code> the <code>\"1\"</code> is a [[string literal]], not an integer literal, because it is in quotes. The value of the string is <code>1</code>, which happens to be an integer string, but this is semantic analysis of the string literal – at the syntactic level <code>\"1\"</code> is simply a string, no different from <code>\"foo\"</code>.\n\n==Parsing==\nRecognizing a string (sequence of characters in the source code) as an integer literal is part of the [[lexical analysis]] (lexing) phase, while evaluating the literal to its value is part of the [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]] phase. Within the lexer and phrase grammar, the token class is often denoted <code>integer</code>, with the lowercase indicating a lexical-level token class, as opposed to phrase-level production rule (such as <code>ListOfIntegers</code>). Once a string has been lexed (tokenized) as an integer literal, its value cannot be determined syntactically (it is ''just'' an integer), and evaluation of its value becomes a semantic question.\n\nInteger literals are generally lexed with [[regular expression]]s, as in [[Python (programming language) |Python]].<ref name=pyintlits>\"[https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-and-long-integer-literals 2.4.4. Integer and long integer literals]\"</ref>\n\n==Evaluation==\nAs with other literals, integer literals are generally evaluated at compile time, as part of the semantic analysis phase. In some cases this semantic analysis is done in the lexer, immediately on recognition of an integer literal, while in other cases this is deferred until the parsing stage, or until after the [[parse tree]] has been completely constructed. For example, on recognizing the string <code>0x10</code> the lexer could immediately evaluate this to 16 and store that (a token of type <code>integer</code> and value 16), or defer evaluation and instead record a token of type <code>integer</code> and value <code>0x10</code>.\n\nOnce literals have been evaluated, further semantic analysis in the form of [[constant folding]] is possible, meaning that literal expressions involving literal values can be evaluated at the compile phase. For example, in the statement <code>x = 2 + 2</code> after the literals have been evaluated and the expression <code>2 + 2</code> has been parsed, it can then be evaluated to 4, though the value 4 does not itself appear as a literal.\n\n==Affixes==\nInteger literals frequently have prefixes indicating base, and less frequently suffixes indicating type.<ref name=pyintlits /> For example, in [[C++]] <code>0x10ULL</code> indicates the value 16 (because hexadecimal) as an unsigned long long integer.\n\nCommon prefixes include:\n* <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> for [[hexadecimal]] (base 16);\n* <code>0</code>, <code>0o</code> or <code>0O</code> for [[octal]] (base 8);\n* <code>0b</code> or <code>0B</code> for [[binary number|binary]] (base 2).\nCommon suffixes include:\n* <code>l</code> or <code>L</code> for long integer;\n* <code>ll</code> or <code>LL</code> for long long integer;\n* <code>u</code> or <code>U</code> for unsigned integer.\n\nThese affixes are somewhat similar to [[Sigil (computer programming)|sigils]], though sigils attach to identifiers (names), not literals.\n\n==Digit separators==\nIn some languages, integer literals may contain digit separators to allow [[Decimal mark#Digit grouping|digit grouping]] into more legible forms. If this is available, it can usually be done for floating point literals as well. This is particularly useful for [[bit field]]s, and makes it easier to see the size of large numbers (such as a million) at a glance by [[subitizing]] rather than counting digits. It is also useful for numbers that are typically grouped, such as [[credit card number]] or [[social security number]]s.{{efn|Typically sensitive numbers such as these would not be included as literals, however.}} Very long numbers can be further grouped by doubling up separators.\n\nTypically decimal numbers (base-10) are grouped in three digit groups (representing one of 1000 possible values), binary numbers (base-2) in four digit groups (one [[nibble]], representing one of 16 possible values), and hexadecimal numbers (base-16) in two digit groups (each digit is one nibble, so two digits are one [[byte]], representing one of 256 possible values). Numbers from other systems (such as id numbers) are grouped following whatever convention is in use.\n\n===Examples===\nIn [[Ada programming language|Ada]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-02-04.html#2.4 |title=Ada '83 Language Reference Manual: 2.4.

To distinguish this numeral from letters, it was sometimes given an [[overbar]]: {{overline|M}}. Multiples were written above this sign, so that for example {{Greek numeral|45820000}} would equal 4,582×10,000 or 45,820,000. The etymology of the word ''myriad'' itself is uncertain: it has been variously connected to [[Proto-Indo-European|PIE]] ''*meu-'' (\"damp\") in reference to the waves of the sea and to Greek ''myrmex'' ({{lang|grc|μύρμηξ}}, \"ant\") in reference to their swarms.<ref>Schwartzman, Steven.

In his ''[[Sand Reckoner]]'', [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]] used this quantity as the basis for a numeration system of large powers of ten, which he used to count grains of sand.\n\n==Usage==\nIn English, ''myriad'' is most commonly used to mean \"some large but unspecified number\".

The ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' notes that confusion over the use of myriad as a noun \"seems to reflect a mistaken belief that the word was originally and is still properly only an adjective ... however, the noun is in fact the older form, dating to the 16th century.

Owing to the possible confusion with the generic meaning of \"large quantity\", however, this is generally restricted to translation of other languages like [[ancient Greek]], [[Chinese numerals|Chinese]], and [[Indian numbering system|Hindi]] where numbers may be grouped into sets of 10,000 (myriads).

'twice hundred myriad').\n\n==East Asia==\n{{see also|Chinese numerals|Japanese numerals|Korean numerals|Vietnamese numerals}}\nIn [[East Asian culture|East Asia]], the traditional numeral systems of [[Chinese numerals|China]], [[Korean numerals|Korea]], and [[Japanese numerals|Japan]] are all [[decimal]]-based but grouped into ten thousands rather than thousands. The [[Chinese character|character]] for myriad is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|萬}}}} in [[traditional characters|traditional]] script and {{lang|zh|{{linktext|万}}}} in [[simplified characters|simplified]] form in both [[Simplified Chinese character#Mainland China|mainland China]] and [[Japanese script reform|Japan]]. The pronunciation varies within China and abroad: ''wàn'' ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), ''wan''<sup>5</sup> ([[Hakka language|Hakka]]), ''bān'' ([[Minnan language|Minnan]]), ''maan''<sup>6</sup> ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]), ''man'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]), and ''vạn'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]). [[Vietnam]] is peculiar within the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sinosphere]] in largely rejecting Chinese numerals in favor of [[Vietnamese numerals|its own]]: ''vạn'' is less common than the native ''mười nghìn'' (\"ten thousand\") and its numerals are grouped in threes.\n\nBecause of this grouping into fours, higher orders of numbers are provided by the [[power (math)|powers]] of 10,000 rather than 1,000: In China, 10,000<sup>2</sup> was {{lang|zh|{{linktext|萬萬}}}} in ancient texts but is now called {{lang|zh|{{linktext|億}}}} and sometimes written as 1,0000,0000; 10,000<sup>3</sup> is 1,0000,0000,0000 or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|兆}}}}; 10,000<sup>4</sup> is 1,0000,0000,0000,0000 or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|京}}}}; and so on. Conversely, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean generally do not have native words for powers of one thousand: what is called \"one million\" in English is \"100{{lang|zh|萬}}\" (100 myriad) in the [[Sinosphere]], and \"one billion\" in English is \"{{lang|zh|十億}}\" (ten [[-yllion|myllion]]) or \"{{lang|zh|十萬萬}}\" (ten myriad myriad) in the Sinosphere. Unusually, Vietnam employs its former translation of {{lang|zh|兆}}, ''một triệu'', to mean 1,000,000 rather than the Chinese figure. Similarly, the [[PRC]] government has adapted the word {{lang|zh|兆}} to mean the scientific prefix [[mega-]], but transliterations are used instead for [[giga-]], [[tera-]], and other larger prefixes. This has caused confusion in areas closely related to the PRC such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where {{lang|zh|兆}} is still largely used to mean 10,000<sup>3</sup>.\n\n{{lang|zh|萬}} and {{lang|zh|万}} are also frequently employed colloquially in expressions, [[cliché]]s, and ''[[chengyu]]'' (idioms) in the senses of \"vast\", \"numerous\", \"numberless\", and \"infinite\".

In British English \"nought\" is also used. In American English \"naught\" is used occasionally for zero, but as with British English, \"naught\" is more often used as an archaic word for nothing. \"Nil\", \"love\", and \"duck\" are used by different sports for scores of zero.\n\nIt is quite common in English to describe decades with a plural of the first year of the decade for example \"the nineties\" which can be written as \"the 90s\". There was a debate on what to call the first decade of the 21st century, as \"00s\" is not usually pronounced as a word. Apart from side stepping the issue and calling the decade the \"two-thousands\" (2000s) there is no agreed wording, although in Britain and some other countries \"noughties\" was also used.\n\nThere is a need to maintain an explicit distinction between digit zero and [[O|letter O]],{{efn|In many fonts the character for zero (number \"0\") and the letter \"O\" have slightly different shapes. In some fonts (and also in hand writing), where there is a need for a clear distinction a \"[[slashed zero]]\" ([[File:Slashed zero (2).jpg|7px]]) is used.}} which, because they are both usually represented graphically in [[English orthography]] (and indeed most orthographies using [[Latin script]] and [[Arabic numerals]]) with a simple [[circle]] or [[oval]], have a centuries-long history of being frequently conflated. However, in spoken English, the number 0 is often read as the letter \"[[wikt:o|o]]\" (\"[[wikt:oh|oh]]\"). For example, when dictating a [[telephone number]] the series of digits \"1070\" may be spoken as \"one zero seven zero\" or as \"one oh seven oh\".\n\nIn certain context zero and nothing are interchangeable as is \"null\". Sporting terms are sometimes used as slang terms for zero as are \"nada\", \"zilch\" and \"zip\".\n\n== \"Zero\" and \"cipher\" ==\n\"Zero\" and \"cipher\" are both names for the number 0, but the use of \"cipher\" for the number is rare and only literary in English today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/cipher |title=cipher &#124; meaning of cipher in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English &#124; LDOCE |website=Ldoceonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-08}}</ref> They are [[doublet (linguistics)|doublet]]s, which means they have entered the language through different routes but have the same etymological root, which is the Arabic \"[[wikt:صفر|صفر]]\" (which transliterates as \"sifr\").  Via Italian this became \"zefiro\" and thence \"zero\" in modern English, Portuguese, French, Catalan and Italian (\"cero\" in Spanish).  But via Spanish it became \"[[wikt:cifra|cifra]]\" and thence \"[[wikt:cifre|cifre]]\" in [[Old French]] and \"cipher\" in modern English (and \"[[wikt:chiffre|chiffre]]\" in modern French).<ref name=MMW>{{cite book|title=Mark My Words, A Guide to Modern Usage and Expression|page=640|author=John Baker Opdycke|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1949|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n\"Zero\" is more commonly used in mathematics and science, whereas \"cipher\" is used only in a literary style. Both also have other [[connotation]]s.  One may refer to a person as being a \"social cipher\", but would name them \"Mr. Zero\", for example.<ref name=MMW />\n\nIn his discussion of \"naught\" and \"nought\" in ''Modern English Usage'' (see below), [[H. W. Fowler]] uses \"cipher\" to name the number 0.<ref name=Fowler1 />\n\n== \"Nought\" and \"naught\" versus \"ought\" and \"aught\" ==\nIn English, \"naught\" and \"nought\" mean the number 0, or a figurative \"nothing\", whereas \"aught\" and \"ought\" (the latter in its noun sense) strictly speaking mean \"all\" or \"anything\", and are not names for the number 0. Nevertheless, they are sometimes used as such in [[American English]], for example \"aught\" as a placeholder for zero in the pronunciation of calendar year numbers. That practice is then also reapplied in the pronunciation of derived terms, such as when the rifle caliber .30-06 Springfield (introduced in 1906) is accordingly referred to by the name \"thirty-aught-six\".\n\nThe words \"nought\" and \"naught\" are spelling variants.  They are, according to [[H. W. Fowler]], not a modern accident as might be thought, but have descended that way from [[Old English]]. There is a distinction in [[British English]] between the two, but it is not one that is universally recognized. This distinction is that \"nought\" is primarily used in a literal arithmetic sense, where the number 0 is straightforwardly meant, whereas \"naught\" is used in poetical and rhetorical senses, where \"nothing\" could equally well be substituted.  So the name of the board game is \"noughts & crosses\", whereas the rhetorical phrases are \"bring to naught\", \"set at naught\", and \"availeth naught\". The [[Reader's Digest]] ''Right Word at the Right Time'' labels \"naught\" as \"old-fashioned\".<ref name=Fowler1>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Modern English Usage|author=[[H. W. Fowler]]|pages=371|article=naught, nought|year=1958|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Glasgow}}</ref><ref name=ReadersDigest1 />\n\nWhilst British English makes this distinction, in [[United States English]], the spelling \"naught\" is preferred for both the literal and rhetorical/poetic senses.<ref name=ReadersDigest1>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Right Word at the Right Time|pages=374–375|article=naught, nought|publisher=The Reader's Digest Association Ltd|location=London|year=1985|editor=John Ellison Kahn and Robert Ilson}}</ref>\n\n\"Naught\" and \"nought\" come from the Old English \"[[wikt:nawiht|nāwiht]]\" and \"[[wikt:nowiht|nōwiht]]\", respectively, both of which mean \"[[wikt:nothing|nothing]]\". They are compounds of ''no-'' (\"no\") and ''[[wikt:wiht|wiht]]'' (\"thing\").<ref name=ReadersDigest1 /><ref name=\"et-no\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=nought&searchmode=term |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date=1906-02-18 |accessdate=2017-07-08}}</ref><ref name=\"et-na\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=naught&searchmode=term |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nThe words \"aught\" and \"ought\" (the latter in its noun sense) similarly come from Old English \"[[wikt:awiht|āwiht]]\" and \"[[wikt:owiht|ōwiht]]\", which are similarly compounds of ''a'' (\"ever\") and ''wiht''<!--NOTE: do not change, this IS spelled CORRECTLY-->. Their meanings are thus the opposites to those of \"naught\" and \"nought\", and in English they in fact, strictly speaking, mean \"[[wikt:anything|anything]]\" or \"[[wikt:all|all]]\". (Fowler notes that \"aught\" is an [[archaism]], and that \"all\" is now used in phrases such as \"for all (that) I know\", where once they would have been \"for aught (that) I know\".)<ref name=ReadersDigest1 /><ref name=Fowler2>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Modern English Usage|author=[[H.

The reason for this is a [[rebracketing]], whereby \"a nought\" and \"a naught\" have been misheard as \"an ought\" and \"an aught\".<ref name=MMW /><ref name=ReadersDigest1 />\n\n[[Samuel Johnson]] thought that since \"aught\" was generally used for \"anything\" in preference to \"ought\", so also \"naught\" should be used for \"nothing\" in preference to \"nought\". However, he observed that \"custom has irreversibly prevailed in using 'naught' for 'bad' and 'nought' for 'nothing'\". Whilst this distinction existed in his time, in modern English, as observed by Fowler and The Reader's Digest above, it does not exist today.  However, the sense of \"naught\" meaning \"bad\" is still preserved in the word \"[[wikt:naughty|naughty]]\", which is simply the noun \"naught\" plus the adjectival suffix \"[[wikt:-y|-y]]\". This has never been spelled \"noughty\".<ref name=MMW />\n\nThe spellings \"owt\" and \"nowt\" are sometimes used to emphasise northern English pronunciation.\n\nThe word ''aught'' continues in use for 0 in a series of one or more for sizes larger than 1. For [[American Wire Gauge]], the largest gauges are written 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, and 4/0 and pronounced \"one aught\", \"two aught\", etc.  Shot pellet diameters 0, 00, and 000 are pronounced \"aught\", \"double aught\", and \"triple aught\". Decade names with a leading zero (e.g., 1900 to 1909) were pronounced as \"aught\" or \"nought\". This leads to the year 1904 ('04) being spoken as \"[nineteen] aught four\" or \"[nineteen] nought four\". Another acceptable pronunciation includes \"[nineteen] oh four\".\n\n=== Decade names ===\n{{see also|Aughts}}\n\nWhile \"2000s\" has been used to describe the first decade the 21st century in all [[English speaking countries]] there has been some national differences in the usage of other terms.\n\nOn January 1, 2000, the [[BBC]] listed the noughties (derived from \"nought\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/details-noughties-2837407.html |title=Complete Definition of \"noughties\" |publisher=Allwords.com |date=August 14, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512234754/http://www.allwords.com/details-noughties-2837407.html |archivedate=2014-05-12}}</ref> a word used for zero in many English-speaking countries), as a potential moniker for the new decade.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/585224.stm |work=BBC News |title=The noughties: So where are we now? |date=January 1, 2000 |accessdate=April 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230010/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/585224.stm |archivedate=2014-05-12}}</ref> This has become a common name for the decade in the UK<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2011/mar/29/leyton-orient-olympic-hockey-astroturf-connection |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Dave | last=Hill | title=Olympic hockey and Leyton Orient: the astroturf connection | date=March 29, 2011| accessdate=November 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526025448/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2011/mar/29/leyton-orient-olympic-hockey-astroturf-connection |archivedate=2012-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6198897/100-songs-that-defined-the-Noughties.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph  | first=Neil | last=McCormick | title=100 songs that defined the Noughties | date=September 18, 2009| accessdate=November 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513021304/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6198897/100-songs-that-defined-the-Noughties.html|archivedate=2014-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article6881549.ece |location=London |work=The Times  | title=The Noughties year by year | date=October 20, 2009 | first=Sophie | last=Tedmanson| accessdate=November 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818200111/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article6881549.ece|archivedate=2011-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/spain-at-glance-guide |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Giles | last=Tremlett | title=At-a-glance guide to Spain | date=March 28, 2011| accessdate=November 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529061916/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/28/spain-at-glance-guide|archivedate=2012-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-chancellor-to-close-online-vat-loophole |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Simon | last=Bowers | title=Budget 2011: Chancellor moves to close online VAT loophole | date=March 23, 2011| accessdate=November 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206163711/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-chancellor-to-close-online-vat-loophole|archivedate=2013-02-06}}</ref> and Australia,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/the-roaring-noughties/story-e6frg6z6-1225813622788 |work=The Australian | first=Cameron | last=Stewart | title=The roaring noughties  | date=December 26, 2009| accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/never-so-good-20091225-lezs.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald | first=John | last=Huxley | title=Never so good  | date=December 26, 2009| accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105135323/http://www.smh.com.au/national/never-so-good-20091225-lezs.html|archivedate=2012-11-05}}</ref> as well as some other English speaking countries.

The most commonly believed hypothesis is that it is derived from English speakers mis-hearing the French \"l'[[wikt:œuf|œuf]]\", \"the egg\", which was the name for a score of zero used in French, because the symbol for a zero used on the scoreboard was an [[ellipse|elliptical]] zero symbol, which visually resembled an egg.<ref>{{cite book |last=Palmatier |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&pg=PA245&dq=love+l%27oeuf+tennis&hl=en&ei=Flr8S8ukFYOB8gb_4ND6BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=love%20l%27oeuf%20tennis&f=false |title=Speaking of animals: a dictionary of animal metaphors |page=245 |year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Horn |first=Geoffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQoY647Kk-wC&pg=PA13&dq=love+l%27oeuf+tennis&hl=en&ei=Flr8S8ukFYOB8gb_4ND6BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=love%20l%27oeuf%20tennis&f=false |title=Rafael Nadal |page=13 |year=2006}}</ref>  There is tangential support for this in the use of \"duck\" as the name for a score of zero by a batsman in cricket, which name derives from the full name \"the duck's egg\" for that score.

([[Jacob Bernoulli]], for example, in his ''Letter to a Friend'', used \"à but\" to describe the initial zero–zero score in court tennis, which in English is \"love-all\".) Some alternative hypotheses have similar problems.  For example:  The assertion that \"love\" comes from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"luff\", meaning \"nothing\", falls at the first hurdle, because there is no authoritative evidence that there has ever been any such word in Scots in the first place.<ref name=Whitman /><ref>{{cite book|title=The Art of Conjecturing, Together with Letter to a Friend on Sets in Court Tennis|author=Edith Dudley Sylla |pages=399–400|chapter=Translator's Commentary on the ''Letter to a Friend'' and Miscellaneous Thesis 32|publisher=JHU Press|year=2006|isbn13=978-0-801-88235-7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first use of the word \"love\" in English to mean \"zero\" was to define how a game was to be played, rather than the score in the game itself. Gambling games could be played for stakes (money) or \"for love (of the game)\", i.e. for zero stakes. The first such recorded usage quoted in the OED was in 1678. The shift in meaning from \"zero stakes\" to \"zero score\" is not an enormous conceptual leap, and the first recorded usage of the word \"love\" to mean \"no score\" is by [[Edmond Hoyle|Hoyle]] in 1742 (OED, 2nd Edition).\n\n[[BBC Radio 5 Live]] has broadcast spin-off versions of its football phone-in [[6-0-6]] (\"''six-oh-six''\") focused on cricket and tennis, branded as \"6-Duck-6\" and \"6-Love-6\" respectively, in the summer months during the soccer off-season.\n\nAnother name for 0 that is used in sports is \"[[wikt:nil|nil]]\". This is derived from the Latin word \"[[wikt:nihil|nihil]]\", which means \"nothing\".  Although common in British English, in football results and the like, it is only used infrequently in U.S. English. The British \"nil\" is not slang, and occurs in formal contexts including technical jargon (e.g. \"nil by mouth\") and voting results.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sociolinguistic Perspectives|author=Charles Albert Ferguson and Thom Huebner|chapter=Sports Announcer Talk|page=164|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1996|location=New York|isbn=0-19-509290-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Facing Job Interviews|author=Namrata Palta and Mary Stella|page=92|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2007|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-8382-106-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Americanization and Australia|author=Philip Bell and Roger John Bell|chapter=Australian English|publisher=UNSW Press|year=1998|isbn13=978-0-868-40784-5}}</ref>\n\n== \"O\" (\"oh\") ==\nIn spoken English, the number 0 is often read as the letter \"[[wikt:o|o]]\", often spelled [[wikt:oh|oh]]. This is especially the case when the digit occurs within a list of other digits.  Whereas one might say that \"a million is expressed in base ten as a one followed by six zeroes\", the series of digits \"1070\" can be read as \"one zero seven zero\", or \"one oh seven oh\". This is particularly true of [[telephone number]]s (for example [[867-5309/Jenny|867-5309]], which can be said as \"eight-six-seven-five-three-oh-nine\"). Another example is [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]'s designation, 007, which is always read as \"double-o seven\", not \"double-zero seven\".<ref>{{cite book|title=A Communicative Grammar of English|author=Geoffrey Leech and Jan Svartvik|chapter=Numerals|page=337|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002|isbn13=978-0-582-50633-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=International English usage|author=Loreto Todd and Ian F.

Thus 16:05 is \"sixteen oh five\", and 08:30 is \"oh eight thirty\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Guide to Joining the Military|author=Scott A.

Blood can either contain antigen A (type A), antigen B (type B), both (type AB) or none (type O). Since the 'O' signifies the lack of antigens it is more meaningful for it to represent the number 'Oh' (zero) than the letter O. However, in English 'blood type O' is usually written with a letter O and not with a number 0 as in most other European languages.\n\n==Null==\nIn certain context zero and nothing are interchangeable as is \"null\". However, in mathematics and many scientific disciplines a distinction is made (see [[Null (disambiguation)|null]]<!-- This is an intentional link to a disambiguation page-->). The number 0 is represented by zero while null is a representation of an empty set {}. Hence in [[computer science]] a zero represents the outcome of a mathematical computation such as 2-2, while null is used for an undefined states (for example a memory location that has not been explicitly initiated).\n\n== Slang ==\nSporting terms ([[#Sport|see above]]) are sometimes used as [[slang]] terms for zero as are \"[[wikt:nada|nada]]\", \"[[wikt:zilch|zilch]]\" and \"[[wikt:zip|zip]]\".\n\n\"Zilch\" is a slang term for zero, and it can also mean \"nothing\".

Later, a set of objects could be tested for equality, excess or shortage, by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set.\n\nThe first major advance in abstraction was the use of [[numeral system|numerals]] to represent numbers. This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers. The ancient [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] for&nbsp;1, 10, and all the powers of&nbsp;10 up to over 1&nbsp;million. A stone carving from [[Karnak]], dating from around 1500&nbsp;BC and now at the [[Louvre]] in Paris, depicts&nbsp;276 as 2&nbsp;hundreds, 7&nbsp;tens, and 6&nbsp;ones; and similarly for the number&nbsp;4,622. The [[Babylonia]]ns had a [[Positional notation|place-value]] system based essentially on the numerals for&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;10, using base sixty, so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one, its value being determined from context.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers'', Wiley, 2000, {{isbn|0-471-37568-3}}</ref>\n\nA much later advance was the development of the idea that&nbsp;{{num|0}} can be considered as a number, with its own numeral. The use of a&nbsp;0 [[numerical digit|digit]] in place-value notation (within other numbers) dates back as early as 700&nbsp;BC by the Babylonians, but they omitted such a digit when it would have been the last symbol in the number.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Zero.html |title=A history of Zero |quote=a tablet found at Kish ... thought to date from around 700 BC, uses three hooks to denote an empty place in the positional notation.

Later, two classes of such formal definitions were constructed; later, they were shown to be equivalent in most practical applications.\n\n[[Set-theoretical definitions of natural numbers]] were initiated by [[Frege]] and he initially defined a natural number as the class of all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set, but this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes including [[Russell's paradox]]. Therefore, this formalism was modified so that a natural number is defined as a particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements.<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1990|loc=Chapter 15}}</ref>\n\nThe second class of definitions was introduced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], refined by [[Richard Dedekind]], and further explored by [[Giuseppe Peano]]; this approach is now called [[Peano arithmetic]]. It is based on an [[axiomatization]] of the properties of [[ordinal number]]s: each natural number has a successor and every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor. Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is [[ZFC]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation.

This kind of [[infinity]] is, by definition, called [[countably infinite|countable infinity]]. All sets that can be put into a [[bijective]] relation to the natural numbers are said to have this kind of infinity. This is also expressed by saying that the [[cardinal number]] of the set is [[Aleph number#Aleph-naught|aleph-naught]] ({{math|ℵ<sub>0</sub>}}).<ref>{{MathWorld |urlname=CardinalNumber |title=Cardinal Number}}</ref>\n\n===Addition===\nOne can recursively define an [[Addition in N|addition]] [[operation (mathematics)|operator]] on the natural numbers by setting {{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''a'' + ''S''(''b'') {{=}} ''S''(''a'' + ''b'')}} for all {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}. Here {{math|''S''}} should be read as \"[[Successor function|successor]]\". This turns the natural numbers {{math|(ℕ, +)}} into a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] with [[identity element]]&nbsp;0, the so-called [[free object]] with one generator. This monoid satisfies the [[cancellation property]] and can be embedded in a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (in the mathematical sense of the word ''group''). The smallest group containing the natural numbers is the [[integer]]s.\n\nIf 1 is defined as {{math|''S''(0)}}, then {{math|''b'' + 1 {{=}} ''b'' + ''S''(0) {{=}} ''S''(''b'' + 0) {{=}} ''S''(''b'')}}. That is, {{math|''b'' + 1}} is simply the successor of {{math|''b''}}.\n\n===Multiplication===\nAnalogously, given that addition has been defined, a [[multiplication]] operator × can be defined via {{math|''a'' × 0 {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''a'' × S(''b'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + ''a''}}. This turns {{math|(ℕ<sup>*</sup>, ×)}} into a free commutative monoid with identity element&nbsp;1; a generator set for this monoid is the set of [[prime number]]s.\n\n===Relationship between addition and multiplication===\nAddition and multiplication are compatible, which is expressed in the [[distributivity|distribution law]]: {{math|''a'' × (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + (''a'' × ''c'')}}. These properties of addition and multiplication make the natural numbers an instance of a [[commutative]] [[semiring]]. Semirings are an algebraic generalization of the natural numbers where multiplication is not necessarily commutative. The lack of additive inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|ℕ}} is not [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under subtraction (i.e., subtracting one natural from another does not always result in another natural), means that {{math|ℕ}} is ''not'' a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; instead it is a [[semiring]] (also known as a ''rig'').\n\nIf the natural numbers are taken as \"excluding 0\", and \"starting at 1\", the definitions of + and × are as above, except that they begin with {{math|''a'' + 1 {{=}} ''S''(''a'')}} and {{math|''a'' × 1 {{=}} ''a''}}.\n\n===Order===\nIn this section, juxtaposed variables such as {{math|''ab''}} indicate the product {{math|''a'' × ''b''}}, and the standard [[order of operations]] is assumed.\n\nA [[total order]] on the natural numbers is defined by letting {{math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if and only if there exists another natural number {{math|''c''}} where {{math|''a'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''b''}}. This order is compatible with the [[arithmetical operations]] in the following sense: if {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are natural numbers and {{math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}, then {{math|''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c''}} and {{math|''ac'' ≤ ''bc''}}.\n\nAn important property of the natural numbers is that they are [[well-order]]ed: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element. The rank among well-ordered sets is expressed by an [[ordinal number]]; for the natural numbers, this is denoted as [[omega (ordinal)|{{math|''ω''}}]] (omega).\n\n===Division===\nIn this section, juxtaposed variables such as {{math|''ab''}} indicate the product {{math|''a'' × ''b''}}, and the standard [[order of operations]] is assumed.\n\nWhile it is in general not possible to divide one natural number by another and get a natural number as result, the procedure of ''[[Division (mathematics)|division]] with remainder'' is available as a substitute: for any two natural numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} there are natural numbers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that\n:{{math|''a'' {{=}} ''bq'' + ''r''}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{math|''r'' < ''b''}}.\n\nThe number {{math|''q''}} is called the ''[[quotient]]'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by&nbsp;{{math|''b''}}. The numbers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}} and&nbsp;{{math|''b''}}. This [[Euclidean division]] is key to several other properties ([[divisibility]]), algorithms (such as the [[Euclidean algorithm]]), and ideas in number theory.\n\n===Algebraic properties satisfied by the natural numbers===\nThe addition (+) and multiplication (×) operations on natural numbers as defined above have several algebraic properties:\n* [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]] under addition and multiplication: for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' × ''b''}} are natural numbers.\n* [[Associativity]]: for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}} and {{math|''a'' × (''b'' × ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') × ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]]: for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}} and {{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' × ''a''}}.\n* Existence of [[identity element]]s: for every natural number ''a'', {{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''a'' × 1 {{=}} ''a''}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''a'' × (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + (''a'' × ''c'')}}.\n* No nonzero [[zero divisor]]s: if {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are natural numbers such that {{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both).\n\n==Generalizations==\nTwo important generalizations of natural numbers arise from the two uses of counting and ordering: [[cardinal number]]s and [[ordinal number]]s.\n* A natural number can be used to express the size of a finite set; more precisely, a cardinal number is a measure for the size of a set, which is even suitable for infinite sets. This concept of \"size\" relies on maps between sets, such that two sets have [[equinumerosity|the same size]], exactly if there exists a [[bijection]] between them. The set of natural numbers itself, and any bijective image of it, is said to be ''[[countable set|countably infinite]]'' and to have [[cardinality]] [[Aleph number#Aleph-null|aleph-null]] ({{math|ℵ<sub>0</sub>}}).\n* Natural numbers are also used as [[Ordinal numbers (linguistics)|linguistic ordinal numbers]]: \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", and so forth. This way they can be assigned to the elements of a totally ordered finite set, and also to the elements of any [[well-order]]ed countably infinite set. This assignment can be generalized to general well-orderings with a cardinality beyond countability, to yield the ordinal numbers. An ordinal number may also be used to describe the notion of \"size\" for a well-ordered set, in a sense different from cardinality: if there is an [[order isomorphism]] (more than a bijection!) between two well-ordered sets, they have the same ordinal number. The first ordinal number that is not a natural number is expressed as {{math|ω}}; this is also the ordinal number of the set of natural numbers itself.\n\nMany well-ordered sets with cardinal number {{math|ℵ<sub>0</sub>}} have an ordinal number greater than {{math|ω}} (the latter is the lowest possible). The least ordinal of cardinality {{math|ℵ<sub>0</sub>}} (i.e., the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal]]) is {{math|ω}}.\n\nFor [[finite set|finite]] well-ordered sets, there is a one-to-one correspondence between ordinal and cardinal numbers; therefore they can both be expressed by the same natural number, the number of elements of the set. This number can also be used to describe the position of an element in a larger finite, or an infinite, [[sequence]].\n\nA countable [[non-standard model of arithmetic]] satisfying the Peano Arithmetic (i.e., the first-order Peano axioms) was developed by [[Skolem]] in 1933.  The [[hypernatural]] numbers are an uncountable model that can be constructed from the ordinary natural numbers via the [[ultrapower construction]].\n\n[[Georges Reeb]] used to claim provocatively that ''The naïve integers don't fill up'' {{math|ℕ}}. Other generalizations are discussed in the article on [[number]]s.\n\n==Formal definitions==\n\n===Peano axioms===\n{{Main|Peano axioms}}\n\nMany properties of the natural numbers can be derived from the five [[Peano axioms]]:<ref>{{Citation\n| url   = http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Peano_axioms\n| author = G.E.

He begins with \"(I){{spaces|2}}{{math|0 ∈ ω}} (where, of course, {{math|0 {{=}} ∅}}\" ({{math|ω}} is the set of all natural numbers). (p. 46)<br />\n{{harvtxt|Morash|1991}} gives \"a two-part axiom\" in which the natural numbers begin with 1. (Section 10.1: ''An Axiomatization for the System of Positive Integers'')\n</ref>\n\n# 0 is a natural number.\n# Every natural number has a successor.\n# 0 is not the successor of any natural number.\n# If the successor of <math> x </math> equals the successor of <math> y </math>, then <math> x</math> equals <math> y</math>.\n# The [[axiom of induction]]: If a statement is true of 0, and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number, then the statement is true for every natural number.\n\nThese are not the original axioms published by Peano, but are named in his honor.  Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0.  In ordinary arithmetic, the successor of <math> x</math> is <math> x + 1</math>. Replacing axiom 5 by an axiom schema, one obtains a (weaker) first-order theory called ''[[Peano arithmetic]]''.\n\n===Constructions based on set theory===\n{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}\n{{Also|Ordinal number#Definitions}}\n\n====Von Neumann ordinals<!--'Von Neumann ordinal' and 'Von Neumann ordinals' redirect here-->====\n\nIn the area of mathematics called [[set theory]], a specific construction due to [[John von Neumann]]<ref name=\"von Neumann1923pp199-208\">{{Harvp|Von Neumann|1923}}</ref><ref name=\"Levy\">{{harvp|Levy|1979|page=52}} attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in 1916 and several papers by von Neumann the 1920s.</ref> defines the natural numbers as follows:\n* Set {{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}}, the [[empty set]],\n* Define {{math|''S''(''a'') {{=}} ''a'' ∪ {{mset|''a''}}}} for every set {{math|''a''}}. {{math|''S''(''a'')}} is the successor of {{math|''a''}}, and {{math|''S''}} is called the [[successor function]].\n* By the [[axiom of infinity]], there exists a set which contains 0 and is closed under the successor function. Such sets are said to be  'inductive'. The intersection of all such inductive sets is defined to be the set of natural numbers. It can be checked that the set of natural numbers satisfies the [[Peano axioms]].\n* It follows that each natural number is equal to the set of all natural numbers less than it:\n:*{{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}},\n:*{{math|1 {{=}} 0 ∪ {{mset|0}} {{=}} {{mset|0}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}},\n:*{{math|2 {{=}} 1 ∪ {{mset|1}} {{=}} {{mset|0, 1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}}},\n:*{{math|3 {{=}} 2 ∪ {{mset|2}} {{=}} {{mset|0, 1, 2}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}, {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}}}}},\n:*{{math|''n'' {{=}} ''n''−1 ∪ {{mset|''n''−1}} {{=}} {{mset|0, 1, …, ''n''−1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}, …, {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}, …}}}}}}, etc.\n\nWith this definition, a natural number {{math|''n''}} is a particular set with {{math|''n''}} elements, and {{math|''n'' ≤ ''m''}} if and only if {{math|''n''}} is a [[subset]] of {{math|''m''}}. The standard definition, now called definition of '''von Neumann ordinals'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, is: \"each ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals.\"\n\nAlso, with this definition, different possible interpretations of notations like {{math|ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>}} ({{math|''n''}}-tuples versus mappings of {{math|''n''}} into {{math|ℝ}}) coincide.\n\nEven if one [[finitism|does not accept the axiom of infinity]] and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is still possible to define any one of these sets.\n\n====Zermelo ordinals<!--'Zermelo ordinal' and 'Zermelo ordinals' redirects here-->====\n\nAlthough the standard construction is useful, it is not the only possible construction. [[Ernst Zermelo]]'s construction<ref name=\"Levy\"/> goes as follows:\n* Set {{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}}\n* Define {{math|''S''(''a'') {{=}} {{mset|''a''}}}},\n* It then follows that\n:*{{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}},\n:*{{math|1 {{=}} {{mset|0}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}},\n:*{{math|2 {{=}} {{mset|1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}}},\n:*{{math|''n'' {{=}} {{mset|''n''−1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|…}}}}}}}}, etc.\n:Each natural number is then equal to the set containing just the natural number preceding it.

      "text": "{{short description|Unspecified value mentioned by Plato}}\n\n'''Plato’s number''' is a number enigmatically referred to by [[Plato]] in his dialogue the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (8.546b). The text is notoriously difficult to understand and its corresponding translations do not allow an unambiguous interpretation. There is no real agreement either about the meaning or the value of the number. It also has been called the \"geometrical number\" or the \"nuptial number\" (the \"number of the bride\"). The passage in which Plato introduced the number has been discussed ever since it was written, with no consensus in the debate. As for the number's actual value, '''[[216 (number)|216]]''' is the most frequently proposed value for it, but 3,600 or 12,960,000 are also commonly considered.  \n\nAn incomplete list <ref name=Dupuis>for more names and references see Dupuis J., ''Le Nombre Geometrique de Platon'', Paris: Hachette, 1885</ref> of authors who mention or discourse about includes the names of [[Aristotle]], [[Proclus]] for antiquity; [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]] and [[Girolamo Cardano|Cardano]] during the Renaissance; [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Paul Tannery]] and Friedrich Hultsch in the 19th century and further new names are currently added.<ref name=Jacovides>McNamee K., and Jacovides M., '' Annotations to the Speech of the Muses (Plato \"Republic\" 546B-C)'', Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Bd. 144, (2003), pp. 31-50</ref>\n\nFurther in the ''Republic'' (9.587b) another number is mentioned, known as the \"Number of the Tyrant\".\n\n==Plato's text==\nGreat lexical and syntactical differences are easily noted between the many translations of the ''Republic''. Below is a typical text from a relatively recent translation of ''Republic'' 546b&ndash;c:\n<blockquote>\n\"Now for divine begettings there is a period comprehended by a perfect number, and for mortal by the first in which augmentations dominating and dominated when they have attained to three distances and four limits of the assimilating and the dissimilating, the waxing and the waning, render all things conversable and commensurable [546c] with one another, whereof a basal four-thirds wedded to the pempad yields two harmonies at the third augmentation, the one the product of equal factors taken one hundred times, the other of equal length one way but oblong,-one dimension of a hundred numbers determined by the \nrational diameters of the pempad lacking one in each case, or of the irrational lacking two; the other dimension of a hundred cubes of the triad. And this entire geometrical number is determinative of this thing, of better and inferior births.\"<ref>Translation by Paul Shorey, ''Plato: The Collected Dialogues'', Eds. Edith Hamilton & Huntington Cairns, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N. J., 1961, (p.775)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe 'entire geometrical number', mentioned shortly before the end of this text, is understood to be Plato's number. The introductory words mention (a period comprehended by) 'a perfect number' which is taken to be a reference to Plato's [[Great year|perfect year]] mentioned in his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (39d). The words are presented as uttered by the [[muses]], so the whole passage is sometimes called the 'speech of the muses' or something similar.<ref name=\"Jacovides\"/><ref>Erhardt E., ''The word of the muses'', ''Classical Quarterly'' (New Series) (1986), 36: 407-420</ref> Indeed, [[Philip Melanchthon]] compared it to the proverbial obscurity of the [[Sibyl]]s.<ref>''Selectae declamationes. Declamatio de periodis imperiorum'', v.3, p. 722, Strasbourg, 1559</ref> [[Cicero]] famously described it as 'obscure'  but others have seen some playfulness in its tone.<ref name=\"Dupuis\"/>\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[File:Plato_number.svg|thumb|250px|An illustrated interpretation of Plato's number as {{nowrap|3&#179; + 4&#179; + 5&#179; {{=}} 6&#179;}}]]\nShortly after Plato's time his meaning apparently did not cause puzzlement as Aristotle's casual remark attests.<ref>Aristotle, ''[[Politics]]'', Book V, 12, 8: \"He only says that nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain cycle: and that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are in the ratio of 4:3 and this when combined with a figure of five gives two harmonies: he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.\"</ref> Half a millennium later, however, it was an enigma for the [[Neoplatonist]]s, who had a somewhat mystic penchant and wrote frequently about it, proposing geometrical and numerical interpretations. Next, for nearly a thousand years, Plato's texts disappeared and it is only in the Renaissance that the enigma briefly resurfaced. During the 19th century, when classical scholars restored original texts, the problem reappeared. Schleiermacher interrupted his edition of Plato for a decade while attempting to make sense of the paragraph. [[Victor Cousin]] inserted a note that it has to be skipped in his French translation of Plato's works. In the early 20th century, scholarly findings suggested a [[Babylon]]ian origin for the topic.<ref>Barton G., ''On the Babylonian Origin of Plato's Nuptial Number'', Journal of the American Oriental Society, v.29, (1908), p.210-9</ref>\n\nMost interpreters argue that the value of Plato's number is 216 because it is the cube of 6, i.e. {{nowrap|1=6{{sup|3}} = 216}}, which is remarkable for being also a sum of the cubes for the [[Pythagorean triple]] (3, 4, 5): {{nowrap|1=3{{sup|3}} + 4{{sup|3}} + 5{{sup|3}} = 6{{sup|3}}}}.\n\nSuch considerations tend to ignore the second part of the text where some other numbers and their relations are described. The opinions tend to converge about their values being 480,000 and 270,000 but there is little agreement about the details. It has been noted that 6{{sup|4}} yields 1296 and {{nowrap|1=48 × 27 = 36 × 36 = 1296}}. Instead of multiplication some interpretations consider the sum of these factors: {{nowrap|1=48 + 27 = 75}}.\n\nOther values that have been proposed include:\n*{{nowrap|1=17,500 = 100 × 100 + 4800 + 2700}}, by Otto Weber (1862).<ref>Weber O., ''De Numero Platonis'', Cassel: Programm fur Shuljahre 1861/2, Lyceum Fredericianum, 1862</ref>\n*{{nowrap|1=760,000 = 750,000 + 10,000 = 19 × 4 × 10000}}, 19 being obtained from {{nowrap|1=({{sfrac|4|3}} + 5) × 3}} and being the number of years in the [[Metonic cycle]].<ref name=\"Dupuis\"/> \n*{{nowrap|1=8128 = 2{{sup|6}} × (2{{sup|7}} − 1)}}, a [[perfect number]] proposed by Cardano.

Written in binary, a power of two always has the form 100…000 or 0.00…001, just like a [[power of ten]] in the [[decimal]] system.\n\n== Computer science ==\nTwo to the power of {{mvar|n}}, written as {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}}, is the number of ways the [[bit]]s in a [[binary numeral system|binary]] word of length {{mvar|n}} can be arranged. A word, interpreted as an unsigned [[integer (computer science)|integer]], can represent values from 0&nbsp;({{math|000…000<sub>2</sub>}}) to {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1}}&nbsp;({{math|111…111<sub>2</sub>}}) inclusively. Corresponding [[signedness|signed]] integer values can be positive, negative and zero; see [[signed number representations]]. Either way, one less than a power of two is often the upper bound of an integer in binary computers. As a consequence, numbers of this form show up frequently in computer software. As an example, a [[video game]] running on an 8-bit system might limit the score or the number of items the player can hold to 255—the result of using a [[byte]], which is [[octet (computing)|8 bits long]], to store the number, giving a maximum value of {{math|1=2<sup>8</sup> − 1 = 255}}.  For example, in the original ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|Legend of Zelda]]'' the main character was limited to carrying 255&nbsp;rupees (the currency of the game) at any given time, and the video game [[Pac-Man]] famously has a [[Glossary of video game terms#Kill screen|kill screen]] at level&nbsp;256.\n\nPowers of two are often used to measure computer memory.  A byte is now considered eight bits (an [[octet (computing)|octet]], resulting in the possibility of 256 values (2<sup>8</sup>).  (The term ''byte'' once meant (and in some cases, still means) a [[bit#More than one bit|collection of bits]], typically of 5 to 32 bits, rather than only an 8-bit unit.)  The prefix ''kilo'', in conjunction with ''byte'', may be, and has traditionally been, used, to mean 1,024 (2<sup>10</sup>). However, in general, the term ''kilo'' has been used in the [[International System of Units]] to mean 1,000 (10<sup>3</sup>). [[Binary prefixes]] have been standardized, such as ''kibi''&nbsp;(Ki) meaning 1,024. Nearly all [[processor register]]s have sizes that are powers of two, 32 or 64 being most common.\n\nPowers of two occur in a range of other places as well. For many [[disk drive]]s, at least one of the sector size, number of sectors per track, and number of tracks per surface is a power of two. The logical block size is almost always a power of two.\n\nNumbers that are not powers of two occur in a number of situations, such as video resolutions, but they are often the sum or product of only two or three powers of two, or powers of two minus one. For example, {{math|1=640 = 32 × 20  }}, and {{math|1=480 = 32 × 15}}. Put another way, they have fairly regular bit patterns.\n\n== Mersenne and Fermat primes ==\nA [[prime number]] that is one less than a power of two is called a [[Mersenne prime]]. For example, the prime number [[thirty-one|31]] is a Mersenne prime because it is 1 less than 32 (2<sup>5</sup>). Similarly, a prime number (like [[257 (number)|257]]) that is one more than a positive power of two is called a [[Fermat prime]]—the exponent  itself is a power of two.  A [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] that has a power of two as its [[denominator]] is called a [[dyadic rational]]. The numbers that can be represented as sums of consecutive positive integers are called [[polite number]]s; they are exactly the numbers that are not powers of two.\n\n== Euclid's ''Elements'', Book IX ==\nThe geometric progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, … (or, in the [[binary numeral system]], 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, … ) is important in [[number theory]]. Book&nbsp;IX, Proposition&nbsp;36 of [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']] proves that if the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} terms of this progression is a prime number (and thus is a Mersenne prime as mentioned above), then this sum times the {{mvar|n}}th term is a [[perfect number]]. For example, the sum of the first 5 terms of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31, which is a prime number. The sum 31 multiplied by 16 (the 5th term in the series) equals 496, which is a perfect number.\n\nBook&nbsp;IX, Proposition&nbsp;35, proves that in a geometric series if the first term is subtracted from the second and last term in the sequence, then as the excess of the second is to the first—so is the excess of the last to all those before it. (This is a restatement of our formula for geometric series from above.) Applying this to the geometric progression 31, 62, 124, 248, 496 (which results from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 by multiplying all terms by 31), we see that 62 minus 31 is to 31 as 496 minus 31 is to the sum of 31, 62, 124, 248. Therefore, the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 and 248 add up to 496 and further these are all the numbers that [[divisor|divide]] 496. For suppose that {{mvar|p}} divides 496 and it is not amongst these numbers. Assume {{math|''p q''}} is equal to {{math|16 × 31}}, or 31 is to {{mvar|q}} as {{mvar|p}} is to 16. Now {{mvar|p}} cannot divide 16 or it would be amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.\nTherefore, 31 cannot divide {{mvar|q}}. And since 31 does not divide {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|q}} measures 496, the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] implies that {{mvar|q}} must divide 16 and be amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. Let {{mvar|q}} be 4, then {{mvar|p}} must be 124, which is impossible since by hypothesis {{mvar|p}} is not amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 or 248.\n\n== The 0th through 95th powers of

The term stands for '''rep'''eated '''unit''' and was coined in 1966 by [[Albert H. Beiler]] in his book ''Recreations in the Theory of Numbers''.{{refn|group=note|Albert H. Beiler coined the term “repnunit number” as follows:<blockquote>A number which consists of a repeated of a single digit is sometimes called a monodigit number, and for convenience the author has used the term “repunit number”(repeated unit) to represent monodigit numbers consisting solely of the digit 1.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beiler|2013|pp=83}}</ref></blockquote>}}<!--- Original publication was 1964; did he coin repunit in that edition? or was this added in 1966? --->\n\nA '''repunit prime''' is a repunit that is also a [[prime number]]. Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base 2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(b)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base b representation. The first two repunits base ''b'' for ''n''=1 and ''n''=2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-10) repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n\\equiv R_n^{(10)}={10^n-1\\over{10-1}}={10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(10)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base 10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits [[base 2]] are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(2)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 × 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 × 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 × 5 = 5 × 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base ''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b - 1''. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2·29·1069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' &minus; 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' - 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' &minus; 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base ''b''.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base 5, 11111 in base 2) and 8191 (111 in base 90, 1111111111111 in base 2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base ''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''-1 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1≤''i''<''j''≤''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' - ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit–Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base ''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base ''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime. The Euclidean Algorithm is based on ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''gcd''(''m'' - ''n'', ''n'') for ''m'' > ''n''. Similarly, using ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> × ''b''<sup>''m''-''n''</sup> = ''R''<sub>''m''-''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, it can be easily shown that ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''-''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) for ''m'' > ''n''. Therefore if ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''d'', then ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''R<sub>d</sub>''<sup>(''b'')</sup>. \n\n== Factorization of decimal repunits ==\n\n(Prime factors colored {{color|red|red}} means \"new factors\", i. e. the prime factor divides ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> but not divides ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> for all ''k'' < ''n'') {{OEIS|id=A102380}}<ref>For more information, see [http://stdkmd.com/nrr/repunit/ Factorization of repunit numbers].</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>1</sub> =||1\n|-\n|''R''<sub>2</sub> =||{{color|red|11}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>3</sub> =||{{color|red|3}} · {{color|red|37}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>4</sub> =||11 · {{color|red|101}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>5</sub> =||{{color|red|41}} · {{color|red|271}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>6</sub> =||3 · {{color|red|7}} · 11 · {{color|red|13}} · 37\n|-\n|''R''<sub>7</sub> =||{{color|red|239}} · {{color|red|4649}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>8</sub> =||11 · {{color|red|73}} · 101 · {{color|red|137}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>9</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> · 37 · {{color|red|333667}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>10</sub> =||11 · 41 · 271 · {{color|red|9091}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>11</sub> =||{{color|red|21649}} · {{color|red|513239}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>12</sub> =||3 · 7 · 11 · 13 · 37 · 101 · {{color|red|9901}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>13</sub> =||{{color|red|53}} · {{color|red|79}} · {{color|red|265371653}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>14</sub> =||11 · 239 · 4649 · {{color|red|909091}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>15</sub> =||3 · {{color|red|31}} · 37 · 41 · 271 · {{color|red|2906161}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>16</sub> =||11 · {{color|red|17}} · 73 · 101 · 137 · {{color|red|5882353}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>17</sub> =||{{color|red|2071723}} · {{color|red|5363222357}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>18</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> · 7 · 11 · 13 · {{color|red|19}} · 37 · {{color|red|52579}} · 333667\n|-\n|''R''<sub>19</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|19|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>20</sub> =||11 · 41 · 101 · 271 · {{color|red|3541}} · 9091 · {{color|red|27961}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>21</sub> =||3 · 37 · {{color|red|43}} · 239 · {{color|red|1933}} · 4649 · {{color|red|10838689}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>22</sub> =||11<sup>2</sup> · {{color|red|23}} · {{color|red|4093}} · {{color|red|8779}} · 21649 · 513239\n|-\n|''R''<sub>23</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|23|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>24</sub> =||3 · 7 · 11 · 13 · 37 · 73 · 101 · 137 · 9901 · {{color|red|99990001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>25</sub> =||41 · 271 · {{color|red|21401}} · {{color|red|25601}} · {{color|red|182521213001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>26</sub> =||11 · 53 · 79 · {{color|red|859}} · 265371653 · {{color|red|1058313049}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>27</sub> =||3<sup>3</sup> · 37 · {{color|red|757}} · 333667 · {{color|red|440334654777631}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>28</sub> =||11 · {{color|red|29}} · 101 · 239 · {{color|red|281}} · 4649 · 909091 · {{color|red|121499449}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>29</sub> =||{{color|red|3191}} · {{color|red|16763}} · {{color|red|43037}} · {{color|red|62003}} · {{color|red|77843839397}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>30</sub> =||3 · 7 · 11 · 13 · 31 · 37 · 41 · {{color|red|211}} · {{color|red|241}} · 271 · {{color|red|2161}} · 9091 · 2906161\n|}\n|}\n\nSmallest prime factor of ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > 1 are\n:11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 239, 11, 3, 11, 21649, 3, 53, 11, 3, 11, 2071723, 3, 1111111111111111111, 11, 3, 11, 11111111111111111111111, 3, 41, 11, 3, 11, 3191, 3, 2791, 11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 2028119, 11, 3, 11, 83, 3, 173, 11, 3, 11, 35121409, 3, 239, 11, ... {{OEIS|id=A067063}}\n\n==Repunit primes==\nThe definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for [[integer factorization|prime factors]] of such numbers.\n\nIt is easy to show that if ''n'' is divisible by ''a'', then ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> is divisible by ''R''<sub>''a''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>:\n\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}=\\frac{1}{b-1}\\prod_{d|n}\\Phi_d(b),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi_d(x)</math> is the <math>d^\\mathrm{th}</math> [[cyclotomic polynomial]] and ''d'' ranges over the divisors of ''n''.

If ''n'' is a [[prime power]] (can be written as ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>, with ''p'' prime, ''r'' integer, ''p'', ''r'' >0), then all repunit in base ''b'' are not prime aside from ''R<sub>p</sub>'' and ''R<sub>2</sub>''. ''R<sub>p</sub>'' can be either prime or composite, the former examples, ''b'' = −216, −128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, ''b'' = −243, −125, −64, −32, −27, −8, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can be prime (when ''p'' differs from 2) only if ''b'' is negative, a power of −2, for example, ''b'' = −8, −32, −128, −8192, etc., in fact, the ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can also be composite, for example, ''b'' = −512, −2048, −32768, etc. If ''n'' is not a prime power, then no base ''b'' repunit prime exists, for example, ''b'' = 64, 729 (with ''n'' = 6), ''b'' = 1024 (with ''n'' = 10), and ''b'' = −1 or 0 (with ''n'' any natural number). Another special situation is ''b'' = −4''k''<sup>4</sup>, with ''k'' positive integer, which has the [[aurifeuillean factorization]], for example, ''b'' = −4 (with ''k'' = 1, then ''R<sub>2</sub>'' and ''R<sub>3</sub>'' are primes), and ''b'' = −64, −324, −1024, −2500, −5184, ... (with ''k'' = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...), then no base ''b'' repunit prime exists.

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[Édouard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240–246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\nKaprekar has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaprekar|1938}}, {{Harvnb|Gunjikar and Kaprekar|1939}}</ref>. \nThey are named after [[Demlo]] railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then [[G.I.P. Railway]], where Kaprekar started investigating them.\nHe calls ''Wonderful Demlo numbers'' those of the form 1, 121, 12321, 1234321, ..., 12345678987654321. The fact that these are the squares of the repunits has led some authors to call Demlo numbers the infinite sequence of these<ref>{{MathWorld |title= Demlo Number |urlname=DemloNumber}}</ref>, 1, 121, 12321, ..., 12345678987654321, 1234567900987654321, 123456790120987654321, ..., {{OEIS|id=A002477}}, although one can check these are not Demlo numbers for ''p'' = 10, 19, 28, ...\n\n==See also==\n* [[All one polynomial]] - Another generalization\n* [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]]\n* [[Repeating decimal]]\n* [[Repdigit]]\n* [[Wagstaff prime]] - can be thought of as repunit primes with [[negative base]] <math>b=-2</math>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n|last=Beiler\n|first=Albert H.\n|author-link=Albert Beiler\n|orig-year=1964\n|date=2013\n|title=Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains\n|publisher=Dover Publications\n|location=New York\n|edition=2nd Revised\n|series=Dover Recreational Math\n|url={{Google books|NbbbL9gMJ88C|Recreations in the theory of numbers|plainurl=yes}}\n|isbn=978-0-486-21096-4\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Dickson\n|first=Leonard Eugene\n|author-link=Leonard Eugene Dickson\n|last2=Cresse\n|first2=G.H.\n|author2-link=G.

      "text": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2012}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''square number''' or '''perfect square''' is an [[integer]] that is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of an integer;<ref>Some authors also call squares of [[rational numbers]] perfect squares.</ref> in other words, it is the [[multiplication|product]] of some integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as {{math|3 × 3}}.\n\nThe usual notation for the square of a number {{mvar|n}} is not the product {{math|''n'' × ''n''}}, but the equivalent [[exponentiation]] {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}, usually pronounced as \"{{mvar|n}} squared\". The name ''square'' number comes from the name of the shape. The unit of [[area]] is defined as the area of a [[unit square]] ({{math|1 × 1}}). Hence, a square with side length {{mvar|n}} has area {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nSquare numbers are [[non-negative]]. Another way of saying that a (non-negative) integer is a square number is that its [[square root]] is again an integer. For example, {{sqrt|9}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, so 9 is a square number.\n\nA positive integer that has no perfect square [[divisor]]s except 1 is called [[Square-free integer|square-free]].\n\nFor a non-negative integer {{mvar|n}}, the {{mvar|n}}th square number is {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}, with {{math|1=0<sup>2</sup> = 0}} being the [[0 (number)|zeroth]] one. The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems. If [[rational number|rational]] numbers are included, then a square is the ratio of two square integers, and, conversely, the ratio of two square integers is a square, e.g., \n<math>\\textstyle \\frac{4}{9} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2</math>.\n\nStarting with 1, there are {{math|⌊{{sqrt|''m''}}⌋}} square numbers up to and including {{mvar|m}}, where the expression {{math|⌊''x''⌋}} represents the [[floor function|floor]] of the number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.\n\n==Examples==\nThe squares {{OEIS|id=A000290}} smaller than 60<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3600 are:\n\n<div style=\"float:left; padding: 1em;\">\n:0<sup>2</sup> = 0\n:1<sup>2</sup> = 1\n:2<sup>2</sup> = 4\n:3<sup>2</sup> = 9\n:4<sup>2</sup> = 16\n:5<sup>2</sup> = 25\n:6<sup>2</sup> = 36\n:7<sup>2</sup> = 49\n:8<sup>2</sup> = 64\n:9<sup>2</sup> = 81\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:left; padding: 1em;\">\n:10<sup>2</sup> = 100\n:11<sup>2</sup> = 121\n:12<sup>2</sup> = 144\n:13<sup>2</sup> = 169\n:14<sup>2</sup> = 196\n:15<sup>2</sup> = 225\n:16<sup>2</sup> = 256\n:17<sup>2</sup> = 289\n:18<sup>2</sup> = 324\n:19<sup>2</sup> = 361\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:left; padding: 1em;\">\n:20<sup>2</sup> = 400\n:21<sup>2</sup> = 441\n:22<sup>2</sup> = 484\n:23<sup>2</sup> = 529\n:24<sup>2</sup> = 576\n:25<sup>2</sup> = 625\n:26<sup>2</sup> = 676\n:27<sup>2</sup> = 729\n:28<sup>2</sup> = 784\n:29<sup>2</sup> = 841\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:left; padding: 1em;\">\n:30<sup>2</sup> = 900\n:31<sup>2</sup> = 961\n:32<sup>2</sup> = 1024\n:33<sup>2</sup> = 1089\n:34<sup>2</sup> = 1156\n:35<sup>2</sup> = 1225\n:36<sup>2</sup> = 1296\n:37<sup>2</sup> = 1369\n:38<sup>2</sup> = 1444\n:39<sup>2</sup> = 1521\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:left; padding: 1em;\"> \n:40<sup>2</sup> = 1600 \n:41<sup>2</sup> = 1681 \n:42<sup>2</sup> = 1764\n:43<sup>2</sup> = 1849\n:44<sup>2</sup> = 1936\n:45<sup>2</sup> = 2025\n:46<sup>2</sup> = 2116\n:47<sup>2</sup> = 2209\n:48<sup>2</sup> = 2304\n:49<sup>2</sup> = 2401\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:left; padding: 1em;\"> \n:50<sup>2</sup> = 2500\n:51<sup>2</sup> = 2601 \n:52<sup>2</sup> = 2704\n:53<sup>2</sup> = 2809\n:54<sup>2</sup> = 2916\n:55<sup>2</sup> = 3025\n:56<sup>2</sup> = 3136\n:57<sup>2</sup> = 3249\n:58<sup>2</sup> = 3364\n:59<sup>2</sup> = 3481\n</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\nThe difference between any perfect square and its predecessor is given by the identity {{math|''n''{{sup|2}} − (''n'' − 1){{sup|2}} {{=}} 2''n'' − 1}}. Equivalently, it is possible to count up square numbers by adding together the last square, the last square's root, and the current root, that is, {{math|''n''{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''n'' − 1){{sup|2}} + (''n'' − 1) + ''n''}}.\n\n==Properties==\nThe number&nbsp;{{mvar|m}} is a square number if and only if one can arrange {{mvar|m}} points in a square:\n{| cellpadding=\"8\"\n|-\n|{{bigmath|1=''m'' = 1<sup>2</sup> = 1}}\n|[[Image:Square number 1.png]]\n|-\n|{{bigmath|1=''m'' = 2<sup>2</sup> = 4}}\n|[[Image:Square number 4.png]]\n|-\n|{{bigmath|1=''m'' = 3<sup>2</sup> = 9}}\n|[[Image:Square number 9.png]]\n|-\n|{{bigmath|1=''m'' = 4<sup>2</sup> = 16}}\n|[[Image:Square number 16.png]]\n|-\n|{{bigmath|1=''m'' = 5<sup>2</sup> = 25}}\n|[[Image:Square number 25.png]]\n|}\n\nThe expression for the {{mvar|n}}th square number is {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}. This is also equal to the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} [[odd number]]s as can be seen in the above pictures, where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd number of points (shown in magenta). The formula follows:\n:<math>n^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^n(2k-1).</math>\nSo for example, {{math|1=5<sup>2</sup> = 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9}}.\n\nThere are several [[recursion#Recursion in mathematics|recursive]] methods for computing square numbers. For example, the {{mvar|n}}th square number can be computed from the previous square by {{math|''n''{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''n'' − 1){{sup|2}} + (''n'' − 1) + n {{=}} (''n'' − 1){{sup|2}} + (2''n'' − 1)}}. Alternatively, the {{mvar|n}}th square number can be calculated from the previous two by doubling the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}th square, subtracting the {{math|(''n'' − 2)}}th square number, and adding 2, because {{math|1=''n''<sup>2</sup> = 2(''n'' − 1)<sup>2</sup> − (''n'' − 2)<sup>2</sup> + 2}}. For example,\n:{{math|1= 2 × 5<sup>2</sup> − 4<sup>2</sup> + 2 = 2 × 25 − 16 + 2 = 50 − 16 + 2 = 36 = 6<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nOne number less than a square (''m'' - 1) is always the product of {{sqrt|''m''}} - 1 and {{sqrt|''m''}} + 1 (e.g. 8 × 6 equals 48, while 7{{sup|2}} equals 49).  Thus, 3 is the only prime number one less than a square.\n\nA square number is also the sum of two consecutive [[triangular number]]s. The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a [[centered square number]]. Every odd square is also a [[centered octagonal number]].\n\nAnother property of a square number is that (except 0) it has an odd number of positive divisors, while other natural numbers have an even number of positive divisors. An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the square number, while other divisors come in pairs.\n\n[[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares. Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form {{math|4<sup>''k''</sup>(8''m'' + 7)}}. A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its [[prime factorization]] contains no odd powers of primes of the form {{math|4''k'' + 3}}. This is generalized by [[Waring's problem]].\n\nIn [[base 10]], a square number can end only with digits 0, 1,  4,  5, 6 or  9, as follows:\n\n* if the last digit of a number is 0, its square ends in 0 (in fact, the last two digits must be 00);\n* if the last digit of a number is 1 or 9, its square ends in 1;\n* if the last digit of a number is 2 or 8, its square ends in 4;\n* if the last digit of a number is 3 or 7, its square ends in 9;\n* if the last digit of a number is 4 or 6, its square ends in 6; and\n* if the last digit of a number is 5, its square ends in 5 (in fact, the last two digits must be 25).\n\nIn [[base 12]], a square number can end only with square digits (like in base 12, a [[prime number]] can end only with prime digits or 1), i.e. 0, 1, 4 or 9, as follows:\n\n* if a number is divisible both by 2 and by 3 (i.e. divisible by 6), its square ends in 0;\n* if a number is divisible neither by 2 nor by 3, its square ends in 1;\n* if a number is divisible by 2, but not by 3, its square ends in 4; and\n* if a number is not divisible by 2, but by 3, its square ends in 9.\n\nSimilar rules can be given for other bases, or for earlier digits (the tens instead of the units digit, for example).{{cn|date=March 2016}}  All such rules can be proved by checking a fixed number of cases and using [[modular arithmetic]].\n\nIn general, if a [[prime]]&nbsp;{{mvar|p}} divides a square number&nbsp;{{mvar|m}} then the square of {{mvar|p}} must also divide {{mvar|m}}; if {{mvar|p}} fails to divide {{math|{{sfrac|''m''|''p''}}}}, then {{mvar|m}} is definitely not square. Repeating the divisions of the previous sentence, one concludes that every prime must divide a given perfect square an even number of times (including possibly 0 times). Thus, the number {{mvar|m}} is a square number if and only if, in its [[canonical representation of a positive integer|canonical representation]], all exponents are even.\n\nSquarity testing can be used as alternative way in [[factorization]] of large numbers. Instead of testing for divisibility, test for squarity: for given {{mvar|m}} and some number&nbsp;{{mvar|k}}, if {{math|''k''<sup>2</sup> − ''m''}} is the square of an integer&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} then {{math|''k'' − ''n''}} divides {{mvar|m}}. (This is an application of the factorization of a [[difference of two squares]].) For example, {{math|100<sup>2</sup> − 9991}} is the square of 3, so consequently {{math|100 − 3}} divides 9991. This test is deterministic for odd divisors in the range from {{math|''k'' − ''n''}} to {{math|''k'' + ''n''}} where {{mvar|k}} covers some range of natural numbers {{math|''k'' ≥ {{sqrt|''m''}}}}.\n\nA square number cannot be a [[perfect number]].\n\nThe sum  of the ''n'' first square numbers is\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^N n^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + \\cdots + N^2 = \\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}.</math>\nThe first values of these sums, the [[square pyramidal number]]s, are: {{OEIS|id=A000330}}\n<blockquote>\n0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240, 1496, 1785, 2109, 2470, 2870, 3311, 3795, 4324, 4900, 5525, 6201...\n</blockquote>\nThe sum of the first odd integers, beginning with one, is a perfect square. 1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 5, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7, etc.\n\nThe sum of the ''n'' first [[cube (algebra)|cubes]] is the square of the sum of the ''n'' first positive integers; this is [[Nicomachus's theorem]].\n\nAll fourth powers, sixth powers, eighth powers and so on are perfect squares.\n\n==Special cases==\n* If the number is of the form {{math|''m''5}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the preceding digits, its square is {{math|''n''25}} where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''(''m'' + 1)}} and represents digits before 25. For example, the square of 65 can be calculated by {{math|1=''n'' = 6 × (6 + 1) = 42}} which makes the square equal to 4225.\n* If the number is of the form {{math|''m''0}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the preceding digits, its square is {{math|''n''00}} where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}. For example, the square of 70 is 4900.\n* If the number has two digits and is of the form {{math|5''m''}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the units digit, its square is {{math|''aabb''}} where {{math|1=''aa'' = 25 + ''m''}} and {{math|1=''bb'' = ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}. Example: To calculate the square of 57, 25&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 and 7<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;49, which means 57<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3249.\n* If the number ends in 5, its square will end in 5; similarly for ending in 25, 625, 0625, 90625, ... 8212890625, etc. If the number ends in 6, its square will end in 6, similarly for ending in 76, 376, 9376, 09376, ... 1787109376. For example, the square of 55376 is 3066501376, both ending in ''376''. (The numbers 5, 6, 25, 76, etc. are called [[automorphic number]]s. They are sequence A003226 in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]<ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A003226|2=Automorphic numbers: n^2 ends with n. Also m-morphic numbers for all m not equal to 6 (mod 10)}}</ref>)\n\n==Odd and even square numbers== <!-- This section is linked from [[Irrational number]] -->\n\nSquares of even numbers are even (and in fact divisible by 4), since {{math|1=(2''n'')<sup>2</sup> = 4''n''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nSquares of odd numbers are odd, since {{math|1=(2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 4(''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''n'') + 1}}.\n\nIt follows that square roots of even square numbers are even, and square roots of odd square numbers are odd.\n\nAs all even square numbers are divisible by 4, the even numbers of the form {{math|4''n'' + 2}} are not square numbers.\n\nAs all odd square numbers are of the form {{math|4''n'' + 1}}, the odd numbers of the form {{math|4''n'' + 3}} are not square numbers.\n\nSquares of odd numbers are of the form {{math|8''n'' + 1}}, since {{math|1=(2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 4''n''(''n'' + 1) + 1}} and {{math|1=''n''(''n'' + 1)}} is an even number.\n\nEvery odd perfect square is a [[centered octagonal number]]. The difference between any two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8. The difference between 1 and any higher odd perfect square always is eight times a triangular number, while the difference between 9 and any higher odd perfect square is eight times a triangular number minus eight. Since all triangular numbers have an odd factor, but no two values of {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}} differ by an amount containing an odd factor, the only perfect square of the form {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1}} is 1, and the only perfect square of the form {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> + 1}} is 9.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Automorphic number]]\n* [[Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity]]\n* [[Cubic number]]\n* [[Euler's four-square identity]]\n* [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]]\n* [[Integer square root]]\n* [[Methods of computing square roots]]\n* [[Polygonal number]]\n* [[Power of two]]\n* [[Pythagorean triple]]\n* [[Quadratic residue]]\n* [[Quadratic function]]\n* [[Square (algebra)#Related identities]]\n* [[Square triangular number]]\n* [[Wallis sieve]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[J.H.

For example, the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,&nbsp;… (the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]]) is formed by starting with 0 and 1 and then adding any two consecutive terms to obtain the next one: an implicit description. The sequence 0, 3, 8, 15,&nbsp;… is formed according to the formula ''n''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 for the ''n''th term: an explicit definition.\n\nAlternatively, an integer sequence may be defined by a property which members of the sequence possess and other integers do not possess. For example, we can determine whether a given integer is a [[perfect number]], even though we do not have a formula for the ''n''th perfect number.\n\n== Examples ==\nInteger sequences which have received their own name include:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Abundant number]]s\n*[[Baum–Sweet sequence]]\n*[[Bell number]]s\n*[[Binomial coefficient]]s\n*[[Carmichael number]]s\n*[[Catalan number]]s\n*[[Composite number]]s\n*[[Deficient number]]s\n*[[Euler number]]s\n*[[Even and odd numbers]]\n*[[Factorial]] numbers\n*[[Fibonacci number]]s\n*[[Fibonacci word]]\n*[[Figurate numbers]]\n*[[Golomb sequence]]\n*[[Happy number]]s\n*[[Highly composite number]]s\n*[[Highly totient number]]s\n*[[Home prime]]s\n*[[Hyperperfect number]]s\n*[[Juggler sequence]]\n*[[Kolakoski sequence]]\n*[[Lucky number]]s\n*[[Lucas number]]s\n*[[Motzkin number]]s\n*[[Natural number]]s\n*[[Padovan sequence|Padovan number]]s\n*[[Partition number]]s\n*[[Perfect number]]s\n*[[Prime number]]s\n*[[Pseudoprime]] numbers\n*[[Regular paperfolding sequence]]\n*[[Rudin–Shapiro sequence]]\n*[[Semiperfect number]]s\n*[[Semiprime]] numbers\n*[[Superperfect number]]s\n*[[Thue–Morse sequence]]\n*[[Ulam numbers]]\n*[[Weird number]]s\n*[[Wolstenholme number]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Computable and definable sequences ==\n\nAn integer sequence is a '''[[Recursion theory|computable]] sequence''' if there exists an algorithm which, given ''n'', calculates ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, for all ''n'' &gt; 0. The set of computable integer sequences is [[countable]]. The set of all integer sequences is [[uncountable]] (with [[cardinality]] equal to [[beth one|that of the continuum]]), and so not all integer sequences are computable.\n\nAlthough some integer sequences have definitions, there is no systematic way to define what it means for an integer sequence to be definable in the universe or in any absolute (model independent) sense.\n\nSuppose the set ''M'' is a [[transitive model]] of [[ZFC set theory]]. The transitivity of M implies that the integers and integer sequences inside M are actually integers and sequences of integers. An integer sequence is a '''[[definable set|definable]] sequence relative to ''M''''' if there exists some formula ''P''(''x'') in the language of set theory, with one free variable and no parameters, which is true in ''M'' for that integer sequence and false in ''M'' for all other integer sequences.  In each such ''M'', there are definable integer sequences that are not computable, such as sequences that encode the [[Turing jump]]s of computable sets.\n\nFor some transitive models ''M'' of ZFC, every sequence of integers in ''M'' is definable relative to ''M''; for others, only some integer sequences are (Hamkins et al. 2013). There is no systematic way to define in ''M'' itself the set of sequences definable relative to ''M'' and that set may not even exist in some such ''M''. Similarly, the map from the set of formulas that define integer sequences in ''M'' to the integer sequences they define is not definable in ''M'' and may not exist in ''M''. However, in any model that does possess such a definability map, some integer sequences in the model will not be definable relative to the model (Hamkins et al. 2013).\n\nIf ''M'' contains all integer sequences, then the set of integer sequences definable in ''M'' will exist in ''M'' and be countable and countable in ''M''.\n\n== Complete sequences ==\n\nA sequence of positive integers is called a [[complete sequence]] if every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of values in the sequence, using each value at most once.\n\n==See also==\n* [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]]\n** [[List of OEIS sequences]]\n\n==References==\n\n* {{Citation|last=Hamkins|first=Joel David|last2=Linetsky|first2=David|last3=Reitz|first3=Jonas|title=Pointwise Definable Models of Set Theory|arxiv=1105.4597|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=78|issue=1|pages=139–156|year=2013|doi=10.2178/jsl.7801090}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Integer sequences}}\n*[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/ Journal of Integer Sequences].

It was created and maintained by [[Neil Sloane]] while a researcher at [[AT&T Labs]]. Foreseeing his retirement from AT&T Labs in 2012 and the need for an independent foundation, Sloane agreed to transfer the [[intellectual property]] and hosting of the OEIS to the '''OEIS Foundation''' in October 2009.<ref>[http://oeisf.org/index.html#IPXFER Transfer of IP in OEIS to the OEIS Foundation Inc.]</ref> Sloane is president of the OEIS Foundation.\n\nOEIS records information on integer sequences of interest to both professional [[mathematician]]s and [[recreational mathematics|amateurs]], and is widely cited. {{As of|2019|06|url=https://oeis.org/|df=}} it contains over 320,000 sequences, making it the largest database of its kind.\n\nEach entry contains the leading terms of the sequence, [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s, mathematical motivations, literature links, and more, including the option to generate a [[Graph of a function|graph]] or play a [[Computer music|musical]] representation of the sequence. The database is [[Search engine (computing)|searchable]] by keyword and by [[subsequence]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, 2nd edition, by N.J.A. Sloane.jpg|right|thumb|Second edition of the book]]\n[[Neil Sloane]] started collecting integer sequences as a graduate student in 1965 to support his work in [[combinatorics]].<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Gleick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/27/science/in-a-random-world-he-collects-patterns.html |title=In a 'random world,' he collects patterns |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 27, 1987 |page=C1 }}</ref> The database was at first stored on [[punched card]]s. He published selections from the database in book form twice:\n#'''''A Handbook of Integer Sequences''''' (1973, {{isbn|0-12-648550-X}}), containing 2,372 sequences in [[Lexicographical order|lexicographic order]] and assigned numbers from 1 to 2372.\n#'''''The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences''''' with [[Simon Plouffe]] (1995, {{isbn|0-12-558630-2}}), containing 5,488 sequences and assigned M-numbers from M0000 to M5487.  The Encyclopedia includes the references to the corresponding sequences (which may differ in their few initial terms) in ''A Handbook of Integer Sequences'' as N-numbers from N0001 to N2372 (instead of 1 to 2372.) The Encyclopedia includes the A-numbers that are used in the OEIS, whereas the Handbook did not.\nThese books were well received and, especially after the second publication, mathematicians supplied Sloane with a steady flow of new sequences. The collection became unmanageable in book form, and when the database had reached 16,000 entries Sloane decided to go online—first as an e-mail service (August 1994), and soon after as a web site (1996). As a spin-off from the database work, Sloane founded the ''[[Journal of Integer Sequences]]'' in 1998.<ref>[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/ Journal of Integer Sequences]\n ({{ISSN|1530-7638}})</ref>\nThe database continues to grow at a rate of some 10,000 entries a year.\nSloane has personally managed 'his' sequences for almost 40 years, but starting in 2002, a board of associate editors and volunteers has helped maintain the database.<ref>{{cite web | url = //oeis.org/wiki/Editorial_Board | title = Editorial Board | work = On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences}}</ref>\nIn 2004, Sloane celebrated the addition of the 100,000th sequence to the database, {{OEIS link|A100000}}, which counts the marks on the [[Ishango bone]]. In 2006, the user interface was overhauled and more advanced search capabilities were added. In 2010 an [//oeis.org/wiki/ OEIS wiki] at [//oeis.org/ OEIS.org] was created to simplify the collaboration of the OEIS editors and contributors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://oeisf.org/announcementNov2010.txt | title = New version of OEIS | date = 2010-11-17 | author = Neil Sloane}}</ref> The 200,000th sequence, {{OEIS link|A200000}}, was added to the database in November 2011; it was initially entered as A200715, and moved to A200000 after a week of discussion on the SeqFan mailing list,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://list.seqfan.eu/pipermail/seqfan/2011-November/015853.html|title=<nowiki>[seqfan]</nowiki> A200000|author=Neil J.

For example, the fifth-order [[Farey sequence]], <math>\\textstyle {1 \\over 5}, {1 \\over 4}, {1 \\over 3}, {2 \\over 5}, {1 \\over 2}, {3 \\over 5}, {2 \\over 3}, {3 \\over 4}, {4 \\over 5}</math>, is catalogued as the numerator sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4 ({{OEIS link|A006842}}) and the denominator sequence 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5 ({{OEIS link|A006843}}).\nImportant irrational numbers such as π = 3.1415926535897... are catalogued under representative integer sequences such as [[decimal]] expansions (here 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 8, 8, ... ({{OEIS link|A000796}})), [[binary number|binary]] expansions (here 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... ({{OEIS link|A004601}})), or [[continued fraction]] expansions (here 3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, 1, 1, ... ({{OEIS link|A001203}})).\n\n== Conventions ==\nThe OEIS was limited to plain [[ASCII]] text until 2011, and it still uses a linear form of conventional mathematical notation (such as ''f''(''n'') for functions, ''n'' for running variables, etc.). [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] are usually represented by their full names, ''e.g.'', mu for μ, phi for φ.\nEvery sequence is identified by the letter A followed by six digits, almost always referred to with leading zeros, ''e.g.'', A000315 rather than A315.\nIndividual terms of sequences are separated by commas. Digit groups are not separated by commas, periods, or spaces.\nIn comments, formulas, etc., <tt>a(n)</tt> represents the ''n''th term of the sequence.\n\n=== Special meaning of zero ===\nZero is often used to represent non-existent sequence elements. For example, {{OEIS link|A104157}} enumerates the \"smallest prime of ''n''² consecutive primes to form an ''n''×''n'' [[magic square]] of least magic constant, or 0 if no such magic square exists.\" The value of ''a''(1) (a 1×1 magic square) is 2; ''a''(3) is 1480028129. But there is no such 2×2 magic square, so ''a''(2) is 0.\nThis special usage has a solid mathematical basis in certain counting functions. For example, the [[totient]] valence function ''N''<sub>φ</sub>(''m'') ({{OEIS link|A014197}}) counts the solutions of φ(''x'') = ''m''. There are 4 solutions for 4, but no solutions for 14, hence ''a''(14) of A014197 is 0—there are no solutions.\nOccasionally −1 is used for this purpose instead, as in {{OEIS link|A094076}}.\n\n=== Lexicographical ordering ===\nThe OEIS maintains the [[lexicographical order]] of the sequences, so each sequence has a predecessor and a successor (its \"context\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome: Arrangement of the Sequences in Database|url=https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Arrangement_of_the_Sequences_in_Database|website=OEIS Wiki|accessdate=2016-05-05}}</ref> OEIS normalizes the sequences for lexicographical ordering, (usually) ignoring all initial zeros and ones, and also the sign of each element. Sequences of [[weight distribution]] codes often omit periodically recurring zeros.<!-- Unclear, please rephrase. -->\n\nFor example, consider: the [[prime number]]s, the [[palindromic prime]]s, the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], and the coefficients in the series expansion of <math>\\textstyle {{\\zeta(n + 2)} \\over {\\zeta(n)}}</math>. In OEIS lexicographic order, they are:\n* Sequence #1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000040}}\n* Sequence #2: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, ... {{OEIS link|id=A002385}}\n* Sequence #3: {{bgcolor|lightpink|0, 1, 1,}} 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000045}}\n* Sequence #4: {{bgcolor|lightpink|1,}} 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 56, 67, 79, 92, 106, 121, 137, 154, ... {{OEIS link|id=A000124}}\n* Sequence #5: {{bgcolor|lightpink|1,}} {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}8, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}24, 24, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}48, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}3, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}8, 72, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}120, 24, {{bgcolor|lightpink|−}}168, 144, ... {{OEIS link|id=A046970}}\nwhereas unnormalized lexicographic ordering would order these sequences thus: #3, #5, #4, #1, #2.\n\n==Self-referential sequences==<!-- This section is linked from A053873 -->\nVery early in the history of the OEIS, sequences defined in terms of the numbering of sequences in the OEIS itself were proposed. \"I resisted adding these sequences for a long time, partly out of a desire to maintain the dignity of the database, and partly because A22 was only known to 11 terms!\", Sloane reminisced.<ref>{{cite web | first = N. J. A. | last = Sloane | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180517140606/http://neilsloane.com/doc/sg.pdf | title = My favorite integer sequences | page = 10 | format = [[PDF]]}}</ref>\nOne of the earliest self-referential sequences Sloane accepted into the OEIS was {{OEIS link|A031135}} (later {{OEIS link|A091967}}) \"''a''(''n'') = ''n''-th term of sequence A<sub>''n''</sub> or -1 if A<sub>''n''</sub> has fewer than n terms\". This sequence spurred progress on finding more terms of {{OEIS link|A000022}}. \n{{OEIS link|A100544}} lists the first term given in sequence A<sub>''n''</sub>, but it needs to be updated from time to time because of changing opinions on offsets. Listing instead term ''a''(1) of sequence A<sub>''n''</sub> might seem a good alternative if it weren't for the fact that some sequences have offsets of 2 and greater.\nThis line of thought leads to the question \"Does sequence A<sub>''n''</sub> contain the number ''n'' ?\" and the sequences {{OEIS link|A053873}}, \"Numbers ''n'' such that OEIS sequence A<sub>''n''</sub> contains ''n''\", and {{OEIS link|A053169}}, \"''n'' is in this sequence if and only if ''n'' is not in sequence A<sub>''n''</sub>\". Thus, the composite number 2808 is in A053873 because {{OEIS link|A002808}} is the sequence of composite numbers, while the non-prime 40 is in A053169 because it's not in {{OEIS link|id=A000040}}, the prime numbers. Each ''n'' is a member of exactly one of these two sequences, and in principle it can be determined ''which'' sequence each ''n'' belongs to, with two exceptions (related to the two sequences themselves):\n*It cannot be determined whether 53873 is a member of A053873 or not. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should not be. Nevertheless, either decision would be consistent, and would also resolve the question of whether 53873 is in A053169.\n*It can be proved that 53169 [[principle of contradiction|both is and is not]] a member of A053169. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should not be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should be. This is a form of [[Russell's paradox]]. Hence it is also not possible to answer if 53169 is in A053873.\n\n==An abridged example of a typical OEIS entry==\nThis entry, {{OEIS link|A046970}}, was chosen because it contains every field an OEIS entry can have.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oeis.org/eishelp2.html |title=Explanation of Terms Used in Reply From |publisher=OEIS |author=N.J.A.

The letter \"A\" stands for \"absolute\". Numbers are either assigned by the editor(s) or by an A number dispenser, which is handy for when contributors wish to send in related sequences at once and be able to create cross-references. An A number from the dispenser expires a month from issue if not used. But as the following table of arbitrarily selected sequences show, the rough correspondence holds.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A059097}}\n|Numbers ''n'' such that the binomial coefficient ''C''(2''n'',&nbsp;''n'') is not divisible by the square of an odd prime.\n|{{nowrap|Jan 1, 2001}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A060001}}\n|[[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]](''n'')!.\n|{{nowrap|Mar 14, 2001}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A066288}}\n|Number of 3-dimensional polyominoes (or polycubes) with n cells and symmetry group of order exactly 24.\n|{{nowrap|Jan 1, 2002}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A075000}}\n|Smallest number such that ''n''·''a''(''n'') is a concatenation of ''n'' consecutive integers ...\n|{{nowrap|Aug 31, 2002}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A078470}}\n|Continued fraction for ''ζ''(3/2)\n|{{nowrap|Jan 1, 2003}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A080000}}\n|Number of permutations satisfying −''k''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''p''(''i'')&nbsp;−&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''r'' and ''p''(''i'')&nbsp;−&nbsp;''i''\n|{{nowrap|Feb 10, 2003}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A090000}}\n|Length of longest contiguous block of 1s in binary expansion of ''n''th prime.\n|{{nowrap|Nov 20, 2003}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A091345}}\n|Exponential convolution of A069321(n) with itself, where we set A069321(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n|{{nowrap|Jan 1, 2004}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A100000}}\n|Marks from the 22000-year-old [[Ishango bone]] from the Congo.\n|{{nowrap|Nov 7, 2004}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A102231}}\n|Column 1 of triangle A102230, and equals the convolution of A032349 with A032349 shift right.\n|{{nowrap|Jan 1, 2005}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A110030}}\n|Number of consecutive integers starting with n needed to sum to a Niven number.\n|{{nowrap|Jul 8, 2005}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A112886}}\n|Triangle-free positive integers.\n|{{nowrap|Jan 12, 2006}}\n|-\n!{{OEIS link|A120007}}\n|[[Möbius transform]] of sum of prime factors of ''n'' with multiplicity.\n|{{nowrap|Jun 2, 2006}}\n|}\n: Even for sequences in the book predecessors to the OEIS, the ID numbers are not the same. The 1973 ''Handbook of Integer Sequences'' contained about 2400 sequences, which were numbered by lexicographic order (the letter N plus four digits, zero-padded where necessary), and the 1995 ''Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences'' contained 5487 sequences, also numbered by lexicographic order (the letter M plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary). These old M and N numbers, as applicable, are contained in the ID number field in parentheses after the modern A number.\n; Sequence data\n: The sequence field lists the numbers themselves, or at least about four lines' worth. The sequence field makes no distinction between sequences that are finite but still too long to display and sequences that are infinite. To help make that determination, you need to look at the keywords field for \"fini\", \"full\", or \"more\". To determine to which ''n'' the values given correspond, see the offset field, which gives the ''n'' for the first term given.\n; Name\n: The name field usually contains the most common name for the sequence, and sometimes also the formula. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, ({{OEIS link|A000578}}) is named \"The cubes: a(n) = n^3.\".\n; Comments\n: The comments field is for information about the sequence that does not quite fit in any of the other fields. The comments field often points out interesting relationships between different sequences and less obvious applications for a sequence. For example, Lekraj Beedassy in a comment to A000578 notes that the cube numbers also count the \"total number of triangles resulting from criss-crossing [[Ceva's theorem|cevians]] within a triangle so that two of its sides are each n-partitioned,\" while Neil Sloane points out the unexpected relationship between centered hexagonal numbers ({{OEIS link|A003215}}) and second Bessel polynomials ({{OEIS link|A001498}}) in a comment to A003215.\n; References\n: References to printed documents (books, papers, ...).\n; Links\n: Links, i.e. [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]], to online resources. These may be:\n:# references to applicable articles in journals\n:# links to the index\n:# links to text files which hold the sequence terms (in a two column format) over a wider range of indices than held by the main database lines\n:# links to images in the local database directories which often provide combinatorial background related to graph theory\n:# others related to computer codes, more extensive tabulations in specific research areas provided by individuals or research groups\n; Formula\n: Formulae, recurrences, generating functions, etc. for the sequence.\n; Example\n: Some examples of sequence member values.\n; Maple\n: [[Maple computer algebra system|Maple]] code.\n; Mathematica\n: [[Wolfram Language]] code.\n; Program\n: Originally [[Maple computer algebra system|Maple]] and [[Mathematica]] were the preferred programs for calculating sequences in the OEIS, and they both have their own field labels. {{As of|2016}}, Mathematica was the most popular choice with 100,000 Mathematica programs followed by 50,000 [[PARI/GP]] programs, 35,000 Maple programs, and 45,000 in other languages.\n: As for any other part of the record, if there is no name given, the contribution (here: program) was written by the original submitter of the sequence.\n; See also\n: Sequence cross-references originated by the original submitter are usually denoted by \"[[Cf.]]\"\n: Except for new sequences, the \"see also\" field also includes information on the lexicographic order of the sequence (its \"context\") and provides links to sequences with close A numbers (A046967, A046968, A046969, A046971, A046972, A046973, in our example).

For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181 ... {{OEIS link|A002385}} are prime numbers regardless of base, but they are [[palindromic prime|palindromic]] specifically in base 10. Most of them are not palindromic in binary. Some sequences rate this keyword depending on how they are defined. For example, the [[Mersenne prime]]s 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, ... {{OEIS link|A000668}} does not rate \"base\" if defined as \"primes of the form 2^n - 1\". However, defined as \"[[repunit]] primes in binary,\" the sequence would rate the keyword \"base\".\n:* '''bref''' \"sequence is too short to do any analysis with\", for example, {{OEIS link|A079243}}, Number of isomorphism classes of associative non-commutative non-anti-associative anti-commutative closed binary operations on a set of order n.\n:* '''cofr''' The sequence represents a [[continued fraction]], for example, continued fraction expansion of ''e'' ({{OEIS link|A003417}}) or π ({{OEIS link|A001203}}).\n:* '''cons''' The sequence is a decimal expansion of a mathematical constant, like ''e'' ({{OEIS link|A001113}}) or π ({{OEIS link|A000796}}).\n:* '''core''' A sequence that is of foundational importance to a branch of mathematics, such as the prime numbers ({{OEIS link|A000040}}), the Fibonacci sequence ({{OEIS link|A000045}}), etc.\n:* '''dead''' This keyword used for erroneous sequences that have appeared in papers or books, or for duplicates of existing sequences. For example, {{OEIS link|A088552}} is the same as {{OEIS link|A000668}}.\n:* '''dumb''' One of the more subjective keywords, for \"unimportant sequences,\" which may or may not directly relate to mathematics, such as [[popular culture]] references, arbitrary sequences from Internet puzzles, and sequences related to [[numeric keypad]] entries. {{OEIS link|A001355}}, \"Mix digits of pi and e.\" is one example of lack of importance, and {{OEIS link|A085808}}, \"Price is Right wheel\" (the sequence of numbers on the [[Showcase Showdown]] wheel used in the U.S. game show ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'') is an example of a non-mathematics-related sequence, kept mainly for trivia purposes.<ref>The person who submitted A085808 did so as an example of a sequence that should not have been included in the OEIS. Sloane added it anyway, surmising that the sequence \"might appear one day on a quiz.\"</ref>\n:* '''easy''' The terms of the sequence can be easily calculated. Perhaps the sequence most deserving of this keyword is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... {{OEIS link|A000027}}, where each term is 1 more than the previous term. The keyword \"easy\" is sometimes given to sequences \"primes of the form f(m)\" where f(m) is an easily calculated function. (Though even if f(m) is easy to calculate for large m, it might be very difficult to determine if f(m) is prime).\n:* '''eigen''' A sequence of [[eigenvalue]]s.\n:* '''fini''' The sequence is finite, although it might still contain more terms than can be displayed. For example, the sequence field of {{OEIS link|A105417}} shows only about a quarter of all the terms, but a comment notes that the last term is 3888.\n:* '''frac''' A sequence of either numerators or denominators of a sequence of fractions representing rational numbers. Any sequence with this keyword ought to be cross-referenced to its matching sequence of numerators or denominators, though this may be dispensed with for sequences of [[Egyptian fraction]]s, such as {{OEIS link|A069257}}, where the sequence of numerators would be {{OEIS link|A000012}}. This keyword should not be used for sequences of continued fractions, cofr should be used instead for that purpose.\n:* '''full''' The sequence field displays the complete sequence. If a sequence has the keyword \"full\", it should also have the keyword \"fini\". One example of a finite sequence given in full is that of the [[Supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular prime]]s {{OEIS link|A002267}}, of which there are precisely fifteen.\n:* '''hard''' The terms of the sequence cannot be easily calculated, even with raw number crunching power. This keyword is most often used for sequences corresponding to unsolved problems, such as \"How many [[n-sphere|''n''-spheres]] can touch another ''n''-sphere of the same size?\" {{OEIS link|A001116}} lists the first ten known solutions.\n:* '''hear''' A sequence with a graph audio deemed to be \"particularly interesting and/or beautiful\".\n:* '''less''' A \"less interesting sequence\".\n:* '''look''' A sequence with a graph visual deemed to be \"particularly interesting and/or beautiful\".\n:* '''more''' More terms of the sequence are wanted. Readers can submit an extension.\n:* '''mult''' The sequence corresponds to a [[multiplicative function]]. Term a(1) should be 1, and term a(mn) can be calculated by multiplying a(m) by a(n) if m and n are coprime. For example, in {{OEIS link|A046970}}, a(12) = a(3)a(4) = -8 × -3.\n:* '''new''' For sequences that were added in the last couple of weeks, or had a major extension recently. This keyword is not given a checkbox in the Web form for submitting new sequences, Sloane's program adds it by default where applicable.\n:* '''nice''' Perhaps the most subjective keyword of all, for \"exceptionally nice sequences.\"\n:* '''nonn''' The sequence consists of nonnegative integers (it may include zeroes). No distinction is made between sequences that consist of nonnegative numbers only because of the chosen offset (e.g., ''n''<sup>3</sup>, the cubes, which are all positive from ''n'' = 0 forwards) and those that by definition are completely nonnegative (e.g., ''n''<sup>2</sup>, the squares).\n:* '''obsc''' The sequence is considered obscure and needs a better definition.\n:* '''sign''' Some (or all) of the values of the sequence are negative. The entry includes both a Signed field with the signs and a Sequence field consisting of all the values passed through the [[absolute value]] function.\n:* '''tabf''' \"An irregular (or funny-shaped) array of numbers made into a sequence by reading it row by row.\" For example, {{OEIS link|A071031}}, \"Triangle read by rows giving successive states of cellular automaton generated by \"rule 62.\"\n:* '''tabl''' A sequence obtained by reading a geometric arrangement of numbers, such as a triangle or square, row by row. The quintessential example is [[Pascal's triangle]] read by rows, {{OEIS link|A007318}}.\n:* '''uned''' The sequence has not been edited but it could be worth including in the OEIS. The sequence may contain computational or typographical errors. Contributors are encouraged to edit these sequences.\n:* '''unkn''' \"Little is known\" about the sequence, not even the formula that produces it. For example, {{OEIS link|A072036}}, which was presented to the [[Internet Oracle]] to ponder.\n:* '''walk''' \"Counts walks (or self-avoiding paths).\"\n:* '''word''' Depends on the words of a specific language. For example, zero, one, two, three, four, five, etc. For example, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8, 8 ... {{OEIS link|A005589}}, \"Number of letters in the English name of n, excluding spaces and hyphens.\"\n: Some keywords are mutually exclusive, namely: core and dumb, easy and hard, full and more, less and nice, and nonn and sign.\n; Offset\n: The offset is the index of the first term given. For some sequences, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence {{OEIS link|A073502}}, the [[magic constant]] for ''n''×''n'' [[magic square]] with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, is an example of a sequence with offset 3, and {{OEIS link|A072171}}, \"Number of stars of visual magnitude ''n''.\" is an example of a sequence with offset -1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], the maximum number of pieces you can cut a pancake into with ''n'' cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... {{OEIS link|A000124}}, with offset 0, while [[Mathworld]] gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely ''n'' = 0. But it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors don't bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The internal format actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents the index of the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus {{OEIS link|A000001}}, which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing a(1) has '''1, 4''' as the internal value of the offset field.\n; Author(s)\n: The author(s) of the sequence is (are) the person(s) who submitted the sequence, even if the sequence has been known since ancient times. The name of the submitter(s) is given first name (spelled out in full), middle initial(s) (if applicable) and last name; this in contrast to the way names are written in the reference fields. The e-mail address of the submitter is also given, with the @ character replaced by \"(AT)\" with some exceptions such as for associate editors or if an e-mail address does not exist. For most sequences after A055000, the author field also includes the date the submitter sent in the sequence.\n; Extension\n: Names of people who extended (added more terms to) the sequence, followed by date of extension.\n\n==Applications==\n===Sloane's gap===\n[[File:Sloanes gap.png|thumb|Plot of Sloane's Gap : number of occurrences (Y log scale) of each integer (X scale) in the OEIS database]]In 2009, the OEIS database was used by an amateur mathematician{{who|date=February 2019}} to measure the \"importance\" of each integer number.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guglielmetti|first1=Philippe|title=Chasse aux nombres acratopèges|url=http://www.drgoulu.com/2008/08/24/nombres-acratopeges|website=Pourquoi Comment Combien|lang=fr}}</ref> The result shown in the plot on the right shows a clear \"gap\" between two distinct point clouds<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guglielmetti|first1=Philippe|title=La minéralisation des nombres|url=http://www.drgoulu.com/2009/04/18/nombres-mineralises|website=Pourquoi Comment Combien|accessdate=25 December 2016|lang=fr}}</ref> the \"uninteresting numbers\" (blue dots) and the \"interesting\" numbers that occur comparatively more often in sequences from the OEIS.

The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16. The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is the '''abundance'''. The number 12 has an abundance of 4, for example.\n\n==Definition==\nA number ''n'' for which the sum of divisors [[Divisor function|''σ''(''n'')]] > 2''n'', or, equivalently, the sum of proper divisors (or [[aliquot sum]]) ''s''(''n'') > ''n''.\n\nAbundance is the value ''σ''(''n'') − ''2n'' (or ''s''(''n'') − ''n'').\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe first 28 abundant numbers are:\n\n:12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 102, 104, 108, 112, 114, 120, ... {{OEIS|id=A005101}}.\n\nFor example, the proper divisors of 24 are 1,&nbsp;2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12, whose sum is 36.

A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] mathematician [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (826–901). Other [[Arab]] mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti|al-Majriti]] (died 1007), [[Ibn Tahir al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] (980–1037), and [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320). The [[Iran]]ian mathematician [[Muhammad Baqir Yazdi]] (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to [[René Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Costello |first = Patrick  | title = New Amicable Pairs Of Type (2; 2) And Type (3; 2)  | journal = Mathematics of Computation | volume = 72 | pages = 489–497 | date = 1 May 2002 | url = http://www.ams.org/mcom/2003-72-241/S0025-5718-02-01414-X/S0025-5718-02-01414-X.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2007 |issue=241 | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-02-01414-X}}\n</ref> Much of the work of [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Eastern mathematicians]] in this area has been forgotten.\n\nThābit ibn Qurra's formula was rediscovered by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] (1601–1665) and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (1596–1650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783). It was extended further by [[Walter Borho|Borho]] in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians. Euler also discovered dozens of new pairs.<ref name=Sandifer/> The second smallest pair, (1184, 1210), was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage B. Nicolò I. Paganini (not to be confused with the composer and violinist), having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sprugnoli|first=Renzo|title=Introduzione alla matematica: La matematica della scuola media|url=http://www.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/media.pdf|publisher=Universita degli Studi di Firenze: Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica|accessdate=21 August 2012|page=59|language=Italian|date=27 September 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913033238/http://www.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/media.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nBy 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then.

This formula gives the pairs {{math|(220, 284)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, {{math|(17296, 18416)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}, and {{math|(9363584, 9437056)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}, but no other such pairs are known. Numbers of the form {{math|3×2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1}} are known as [[Thabit number]]s. In order for Ibn Qurra's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive Thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of {{mvar|n}}.\n\nTo establish the theorem, Thâbit ibn Qurra proved nine [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] divided into two groups. The first three lemmas deal with the determination of the aliquot parts of a natural integer. The second group of lemmas deals more specifically with the formation of perfect, abundant and deficient numbers.<ref name=\"Rashed\">{{cite book|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|title=The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra.|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, Boston, London|year=1994|volume=156|isbn=978-0-7923-2565-9|page=278,279}}</ref>\n\n===Euler's rule===\n''Euler's rule'' is a generalization of the Thâbit ibn Qurra theorem. It states that if\n:{{math|''p'' {{=}} (2<sup>''n'' − ''m''</sup> + 1)×2<sup>''m''</sup> − 1}},\n:{{math|''q'' {{=}} (2<sup>''n'' − ''m''</sup> + 1)×2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1}},\n:{{math|''r'' {{=}} (2<sup>''n'' − ''m''</sup> + 1)<sup>2</sup>×2<sup>''m'' + ''n''</sup> − 1}},\nwhere {{math|''n'' > ''m'' > 0}} are [[integer]]s and {{mvar|p}}, {{mvar|q}}, and {{mvar|r}} are [[prime number]]s, then {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>×''p''×''q''}} and {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>×''r''}} are a pair of amicable numbers. Thābit ibn Qurra's theorem corresponds to the case {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''n'' − 1}}. Euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for {{math|(''m'',''n'') {{=}} (1,8), (29,40)}} with no others being known. Euler (1747 & 1750) overall found 58 new pairs to make all the by then existing pairs into 61.<ref name=Sandifer>{{cite book | title=How Euler Did It | last=Sandifer | first=C.

If {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} are both [[coprime]] to {{mvar|g}} and [[Square-free integer|square free]] then the pair ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) is said to be '''regular''' {{OEIS|A215491}}, otherwise it is called '''irregular''' or '''exotic'''. If ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) is regular and {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} have {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} prime factors respectively, then {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is said to be of '''type''' {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}}.\n\nFor example, with {{math|(''m'', ''n'') {{=}} (220, 284)}}, the greatest common divisor is {{math|4}} and so {{math|''M'' {{=}} 55}} and {{math|''N'' {{=}} 71}}. Therefore, {{math|(220, 284)}} is regular of type {{math|(2, 1)}}.\n\n== Twin amicable pairs ==\nAn amicable pair {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is twin if there are no integers between {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} belonging to any other amicable pair {{OEIS|A273259}}.\n\n== Other results ==\nIn every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both [[Even and odd numbers|even]] or both odd.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[order theory]], an '''antichain''' is a subset of a [[partially ordered set]] such that any two distinct elements in the subset are incomparable. (Some authors use the term \"antichain\" to mean [[strong antichain]], a subset such that there is no element of the [[Partially ordered set|poset]] smaller than two distinct elements of the antichain.)\n\nLet ''S'' be a partially ordered set.  We say two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of a partially ordered set are '''[[Comparability|comparable]]''' if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' or ''b'' ≤ ''a''.  If two elements are not comparable, we say they are '''incomparable'''; that is, ''x'' and ''y'' are incomparable if neither ''x'' ≤ ''y'' nor ''y'' ≤ ''x''.\n\nA '''chain''' in ''S'' is a [[subset]] ''C'' of ''S'' in which each pair of elements is comparable; that is, ''C'' is [[Total order|totally ordered]].

A '''maximum antichain''' is an antichain that has cardinality at least as large as every other antichain. The ''width'' of a partially ordered set is the cardinality of a maximum antichain. Any antichain can intersect any chain in at most one element, so, if we can partition the elements of an order into ''k'' chains then the width of the order must be at most ''k'' (if the antichain has more than \"k\" elements, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there would be 2 of its elements belonging to the same chain, contradiction). [[Dilworth's theorem]] states that this bound can always be reached: there always exists an antichain, and a partition of the elements into chains, such that the number of chains equals the number of elements in the antichain, which must therefore also equal the width. Similarly, we can define the ''height'' of a partial order to be the maximum cardinality of a chain. [[Mirsky's theorem]] states similarly that in any partial order of finite height, the height equals the smallest number of antichains into which the order may be partitioned.\n\n== Sperner families ==\n\nAn antichain in the inclusion ordering of subsets of an ''n''-element set is known as a [[Sperner family]].

Four common definitions are as follows.\n\n===Automata-theoretic===\nLet ''k'' be a positive [[integer]], and let ''D'' = (''Q'', Σ<sub>''k''</sub>, δ, ''q<sub>0</sub>'', Δ, τ) be a [[deterministic finite automaton]] ''with output'', where\n*''Q'' is the finite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of states;\n*the input alphabet Σ<sub>''k''</sub> consists of the set {0,1,...,''k''-1} of possible digits in [[radix|base]]-''k'' notation;\n*δ : ''Q'' × Σ<sub>''k''</sub> → ''Q'' is the transition function;\n*''q<sub>0</sub>'' ∈ ''Q'' is the initial state;\n*the output alphabet Δ is a finite set; and\n*τ : ''Q'' → Δ is the output function mapping from the set of internal states to the output alphabet.\n\nExtend the transition function δ from acting on single digits to acting on strings of digits by defining the action of δ on a string ''s'' consisting of digits ''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>...''s''<sub>''t''</sub> as:\n\n:δ(''q'',''s'') = δ(δ(''q<sub>0</sub>'', ''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>...''s''<sub>''t''-1</sub>), ''s''<sub>''t''</sub>).\n\nDefine a function ''a'' from the set of positive integers to the output alphabet Δ as follows:\n\n:''a''(''n'') = τ(δ(''q<sub>0</sub>'',''s''(''n''))),\n\nwhere ''s''(''n'') is ''n'' written in base ''k''. Then the sequence ''a'' = ''a''(1)''a''(2)''a''(3)... is a ''k''-automatic sequence.<ref name=as1/>\n\nAn automaton reading the base ''k'' digits of ''s''(''n'') starting with the most significant digit is said to be ''direct reading'', while an automaton starting with the least significant digit is ''reverse reading''.<ref name=PF13>Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.&nbsp;13</ref> The above definition holds whether ''s''(''n'') is direct or reverse reading.<ref name=PF15>Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.&nbsp;15</ref>\n\n===Substitution===\nLet φ be a ''k''-[[uniform morphism]] of a [[free monoid]] Σ<sup>&lowast;</sup> and let τ be defined as in the automata-theoretic case. If ''w'' is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of φ—that is, if ''w'' = φ(''w'')—then ''s'' = τ(''w'') is a ''k''-automatic sequence.<ref name=AS175>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;175</ref> This result is due to Cobham, and it is referred to in the literature as ''Cobham's theorem''.<ref name=BLRS78/><ref name=C72>Cobham (1972)</ref> Conversely, every ''k''-automatic sequence is obtainable in this way.<ref name=PF13/>\n\n===''k''-kernel===\nLet ''k''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2. The ''k-kernel'' of the sequence ''s''(''n'') is the set of subsequences\n:<math>K_{k}(s) = \\{s(k^e n + r) : e \\geq 0 \\text{ and } 0 \\leq r \\leq k^e - 1\\}.</math>\nIn most cases, the ''k''-kernel of a sequence is infinite. However, if the ''k''-kernel is finite, then the sequence ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-automatic.<ref name=AS185>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;185</ref><ref name=ApCOw527>Lothaire (2005) p.&nbsp;527</ref><ref name=BR91>Berstel & Reutenauer (2011) p.&nbsp;91</ref>\n\nIt follows that a ''k''-automatic sequence is necessarily a sequence on a finite alphabet.\n\n===Formal power series===\nLet ''u''(''n'') be a sequence over an alphabet Σ and suppose that there is an [[injective function]] β from Σ to the [[finite field]] '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, where ''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> for some prime ''p''.  The associated [[formal power series]] is \n:<math> \\sum_{i \\geq 0} \\beta(u(i)) X^i . </math> \nThen the sequence ''u'' is ''q''-automatic if and only if this formal power series is [[Algebraic function|algebraic]] over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''X''). This result is due to Christol, and it is referred to in the literature as ''Christol's theorem''.<ref>{{cite journal | first=G. | last=Christol | title=Ensembles presque périodiques ''k''-reconnaissables | journal=Theoret.

The notion of automatic sequences was further studied by Cobham in 1972, who called these sequences \"uniform [[Tag system|tag sequences]]\".<ref name=C72/>\n\nThe term \"automatic sequence\" first appeared in a paper of Deshouillers.<ref>{{cite journal | first=J.-M. | last=Deshouillers | title=La répartition modulo 1 des puissances de rationnels dans l'anneau des séries formelles sur un corps fini | journal=Séminaire de Théorie des Nombres de Bordeaux | year=1979–1980 | pages=5.01–5.22 }}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe following sequences are automatic:\n\n===Thue–Morse sequence===\n[[File:ThueMorseAutomaton.png|thumb|DFAO generating the Thue–Morse sequence]]\nThe [[Thue–Morse sequence]] ''t''(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A010060}}) is the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the morphism 0 → 01, 1 → 10. Since the ''n''-th term of the Thue–Morse sequence counts the number of ones [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 2 in the base-2 representation of ''n'', it is generated by the two-state deterministic finite automaton with output pictured here, where being in state ''q''<sub>0</sub> indicates there are an even number of ones in the representation of ''n'' and being in state ''q''<sub>1</sub> indicates there are an odd number of ones.\nHence, the Thue–Morse sequence is 2-automatic.\n\n===Period-doubling sequence===\nThe ''n''-th term of the period-doubling sequence ''d''(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A096268}}) is determined by the parity of the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing ''n''. It is also the fixed point of the morphism 0 → 01, 1 → 00.<ref name=AS176>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;176</ref> Starting with the initial term ''w'' = 0 and iterating the 2-uniform morphism φ on ''w'' where φ(0) = 01 and φ(1) = 00, it is evident that the period-doubling sequence is the fixed-point of φ(''w'') and thus it is 2-automatic.\n\n===Rudin–Shapiro sequence===\nThe ''n''-th term of the [[Rudin–Shapiro sequence]] ''r''(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A020985}}) is determined by the number of consecutive ones in the base-2 representation of ''n''. The 2-kernel of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence<ref name=AS154>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;186</ref> is \n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nr(2n) &= r(n), \\\\\nr(4n+1) &= r(n), \\\\\nr(8n+7) &= r(2n+1), \\\\\nr(16n+3) &= r(8n+3), \\\\\nr(16n+11) &= r(4n+3).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nSince the 2-kernel consists only of ''r''(''n''), ''r''(2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), ''r''(4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3), and ''r''(8''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3), it is finite and thus the Rudin–Shapiro sequence is 2-automatic.\n\n===Other sequences===\nBoth the [[Baum–Sweet sequence]]<ref name=AS156>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;156</ref> ({{OEIS2C|id=A086747}}) and the [[regular paperfolding sequence]]<ref name=BR92>Berstel & Reutenauer (2011) p.&nbsp;92</ref><ref name=AS155>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;155</ref><ref name=LotIII526>Lothaire (2005) p.&nbsp;526</ref> ({{OEIS2C|id=A014577}}) are automatic. In addition, the general paperfolding sequence with a periodic sequence of folds is also automatic.<ref name=AS183>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;183</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nAutomatic sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below.\n\n*Every automatic sequence is a [[morphic word]].<ref name=LotIII524>Lothaire (2005) p.&nbsp;524</ref>\n*For ''k''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2 and ''r''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1, a sequence is ''k''-automatic if and only if it is ''k''<sup>''r''</sup>-automatic.

Since a finite state automaton must eventually return to a previously visited state, all 1-automatic sequences are ultimately periodic.\n\n==Generalizations==\nAutomatic sequences are robust against variations to either the definition or the input sequence. For instance, as noted in the automata-theoretic definition, a given sequence remains automatic under both direct and reverse reading of the input sequence. A sequence also remains automatic when an alternate set of digits is used or when the base is negated; that is, when the input sequence is represented in base −''k'' instead of in base ''k''.<ref name=AS157>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;157</ref> However, in contrast to using an alternate set of digits, a change of base may affect the automaticity of a sequence.\n\nThe domain of an automatic sequence can be extended from the natural numbers to the integers via ''two-sided'' automatic sequences. This stems from the fact that, given ''k''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2, every integer can be represented uniquely in the form <math> \\sum_{0 \\leq i \\leq r} a_{i}(-k)^{i} , </math> where <math>a_{i} \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}</math>. Then a two-sided infinite sequence ''a''(''n'')<sub>''n''&nbsp;<math>\\in \\mathbb{Z}</math></sub> is (−''k'')-automatic if and only if its subsequences ''a''(''n'')<sub>n ≥ 0</sub> and ''a''(−''n'')<sub>n ≥ 0</sub> are ''k''-automatic.<ref name=AS162>Allouche & Shallit (2003) p.&nbsp;162</ref>\n\nThe alphabet of a ''k''-automatic sequence can be extended from finite size to infinite size via [[k-regular sequence|''k''-regular sequences]].<ref>{{citation | last1 = Allouche | first1 = J.-P. | last2 = Shallit | first2 = J. | title = The ring of ''k''-regular sequences | journal = Theoret.
