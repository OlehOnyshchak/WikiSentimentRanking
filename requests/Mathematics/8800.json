Scherk described two complete embedded minimal surfaces in 1834;<ref>H.F. Scherk, Bemerkungen über die kleinste Fläche innerhalb gegebener Grenzen, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, Volume 13 (1835) pp. 185–208 [https://books.google.com/books?id=K5tGAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA185&ots=tV5mR2nP-m&dq=%22Bemerkungen%20%C3%BCber%20die%20kleinste%20Fl%C3%A4che%20innerhalb%20gegebener%20Grenzen%22&pg=PA185#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref> his first surface is a doubly periodic surface, his second surface is singly periodic. They were the third non-trivial examples of minimal surfaces (the first two were the [[catenoid]] and [[helicoid]]).<ref>http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Scherk.html</ref> The two surfaces are [[Associate family|conjugates]] of each other.\n\nScherk surfaces arise in the study of certain limiting minimal surface problems and in the study of harmonic [[diffeomorphism]]s of [[hyperbolic space]].\n\n==Scherk's first surface==\n\nScherk's first surface is asymptotic to two infinite families of parallel planes, orthogonal to each other, that meet near ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in a checkerboard pattern of bridging arches. It contains an infinite number of straight vertical lines.\n\n===Construction of a simple Scherk surface===\n\n[[Image:ScherkSurface.png|thumb|The Scherk surface &Sigma; given by the graph of ''u''(''x'', ''y'') = log ( cos(''x'') / cos(''y'') ) for ''x'' and ''y'' between −''π''/2 and ''π''/2.]]\n[[File:Superficie di scherk.jpg|thumb|Nine periods of the Scherk surface.]]\n\nConsider the following minimal surface problem on a square in the Euclidean plane: for a [[natural number]] ''n'', find a minimal surface Σ<sub>''n''</sub> as the graph of some function\n\n:<math>u_{n} : \\left( - \\frac{\\pi}{2}, + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( - \\frac{\\pi}{2}, + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>\n\nsuch that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{y \\to \\pm \\pi / 2} u_{n} \\left( x, y \\right) = + n \\text{ for } - \\frac{\\pi}{2} < x < + \\frac{\\pi}{2},</math>\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to \\pm \\pi / 2} u_{n} \\left( x, y \\right) = - n \\text{ for } - \\frac{\\pi}{2} < y < + \\frac{\\pi}{2}.</math>\n\nThat is, ''u''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfies the [[minimal surface equation]]\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{div} \\left( \\frac{\\nabla u_{n} (x, y)}{\\sqrt{1 + | \\nabla u_{n} (x, y) |^{2}}} \\right) \\equiv 0</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\Sigma_{n} = \\left\\{ (x, y, u_{n}(x, y)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\left| - \\frac{\\pi}{2} < x, y < + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right. \\right\\}.</math>\n\nWhat, if anything, is the limiting surface as ''n'' tends to infinity? The answer was given by H. Scherk in 1834: the limiting surface Σ is the graph of\n\n:<math>u : \\left( - \\frac{\\pi}{2}, + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( - \\frac{\\pi}{2}, + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\to \\mathbb{R},</math>\n:<math>u(x, y) = \\log \\left( \\frac{\\cos (x)}{\\cos (y)} \\right).</math>\n\nThat is, the '''Scherk surface''' over the square is\n\n:<math>\\Sigma = \\left\\{ \\left. \\left(x, y, \\log \\left( \\frac{\\cos (x)}{\\cos (y)} \\right) \\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\right| - \\frac{\\pi}{2} < x, y < + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right\\}.</math>\n\n===More general Scherk surfaces===\n\nOne can consider similar minimal surface problems on other [[quadrilateral]]s in the Euclidean plane. One can also consider the same problem on quadrilaterals in the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]. In 2006, Harold Rosenberg and Pascal Collin used hyperbolic Scherk surfaces to construct a harmonic diffeomorphism from the complex plane onto the hyperbolic plane (the unit disc with the hyperbolic metric), thereby disproving the [[Schoen–Yau conjecture]].\n\n==Scherk's second surface==\n\n[[File:Scherk's second surface.png|thumb|Scherk's second surface]]\n\nScherk's second surface looks globally like two orthogonal planes whose intersection consists of a sequence of tunnels in alternating directions. Its intersections with horizontal planes consists of alternating hyperbolas.\n\nIt has implicit equation:\n:<math>\\sin(z) - \\sinh(x)\\sinh(y)=0</math>\n\nIt has the [[Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization]]\n<math>f(z) = \\frac{4}{1-z^4}</math>, <math>g(z) = iz</math>\nand can be parametrized as:<ref>Eric W. Weisstein, CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics, 2nd ed., CRC press 2002</ref>\n\n:<math>x(r,\\theta) = 2 \\Re ( \\ln(1+re^{i \\theta}) - \\ln(1-re^{i \\theta}) ) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{1+r^2+2r \\cos \\theta}{1+r^2-2r \\cos \\theta} \\right)</math>\n\n:<math>y(r,\\theta) = \\Re ( 4i \\tan^{-1}(re^{i \\theta})) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{1+r^2-2r \\sin\\theta}{1+r^2+2r \\sin \\theta} \\right)</math>\n\n:<math>z(r,\\theta) = \\Re ( 2i(-\\ln(1-r^2e^{2i \\theta}) + \\ln(1+r^2e^{2i \\theta}) ) = 2 \\tan^{-1}\\left( \\frac{2 r^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{r^4-1} \\right)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)</math> and <math>r \\in (0,1)</math>. This gives one period of the surface, which can then be extended in the z-direction by symmetry.\n\nThe surface has been generalised by H. Karcher into the [[saddle tower]] family of periodic minimal surfaces.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, this surface is occasionally called Scherk's fifth surface in the literature.<ref>Nikolaos Kapuoleas, Constructions of minimal surfaces by glueing minimal immersions.

Soap bubbles usually last for only a few seconds before bursting, either on their own or on contact with another object. They are often used for children's enjoyment, but they are also used in artistic [[performance]]s. Assembling several bubbles results in [[foam]].\n\nWhen light shines onto a bubble it appears to change colour. Unlike those seen in a rainbow, which arise from differential refraction, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from interference of light reflecting off the front and back surfaces of the thin soap film. Depending on the thickness of the film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.\n\n== Mathematics ==\nSoap bubbles are physical examples of the complex [[math]]ematical problem of [[minimal surface]]. They will assume the shape of least [[surface area]] possible containing a given volume. A true minimal surface is more properly illustrated by a [[soap film]], which has equal pressure on inside as outside, hence is a surface with zero [[mean curvature]]. A soap bubble is a closed soap film: due to the difference in outside and inside pressure, it is a surface of ''constant'' mean curvature.\n\nWhile it has been known since 1884 that a spherical soap bubble is the least-area way of enclosing a given volume of air (a theorem of [[H. A. Schwarz]]), it was not until 2000 that it was proven that two merged soap bubbles provide the optimum way of enclosing two given volumes of air of different size with the least surface area. This has been dubbed the ''[[double bubble conjecture]]''.<ref>{{ cite journal| last1 = Hutchings | first1 = Michael | first2= Frank |last2 = Morgan| first3=Manuel |last3= Ritoré | first4= Antonio| last4= Ros | date =  July 17, 2000 |  title = Proof of the double bubble conjecture | journal = Electronic Research Announcements | volume = 6| issue = 6 |pages = 45–49 | doi = 10.1090/S1079-6762-00-00079-2\n}}</ref>\n\nBecause of these qualities, soap bubbles films have been used with practical problem solving application. [[Structural engineer]] [[Frei Otto]] used soap bubble films to determine the geometry of a sheet of least surface area that spreads between several points, and translated this geometry into revolutionary [[tension structure|tensile roof structures]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/oct/04/architecture Jonathan Glancey, The Guardian November 28, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108193633/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/oct/04/architecture |date=January 8, 2017 }}</ref> A famous example is his West German Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal.\n\n== Physics ==\n\n=== Merging ===\n[[File:Ggb in soap bubble 1.jpg|thumb|Soap bubbles can easily merge.]]\nWhen two bubbles merge, they  adopt a  shape which makes the sum of their surface areas as small as possible, compatible with the volume of air each bubble encloses. If the bubbles are of equal size, their common wall is flat. If they aren't the same size, their common wall bulges into the larger bubble, since the smaller one has a higher internal [[pressure]] than the larger one, as predicted by the [[Young–Laplace equation]].\n\nAt a point where three or more bubbles meet, they sort themselves out so that only three bubble walls meet along a line. Since the surface tension is the same in each of the three surfaces, the three angles between them must be equal to 120°.  Only four bubble walls can meet at a point, with the lines where triplets of bubble walls meet separated by cos<sup>−1</sup>(−1/3) ≈ 109.47°. All these rules, known as [[Plateau's laws]], determine how a [[foam]] is built from bubbles.\n\n=== Stability ===\nThe longevity of a soap bubble is limited by the ease of rupture of the very thin layer of water which constitutes its surface, namely a [[micrometre|micrometer]]-thick [[soap film]].\nIt is thus sensitive to :\n* Drainage within the soap film: water falls down due to gravity. This can be slowed down by increasing the water viscosity, for instance by adding glycerol. Still, there is an ultimate height limit, which is the [[capillary length]], very high for soap bubbles: around 13 feet (4 meters). In principle, there is no limit in the length it can reach.\n* [[Evaporation]]: This can be slowed down by blowing bubbles in a wet atmosphere, or by adding some sugar to the water.\n* Dirt and fat:  When the bubble touches the ground, a wall, or our skin, it usually ruptures the soap film. This can be prevented by wetting these surfaces with water (preferably containing some soap).\n\n=== Wetting ===\n[[File:Bubble on a ultrahydrophobic surface.jpg|thumb|A soap bubble wetting an ultrahydrophobic surface]]\n[[File:Bubble on a liquid surface.jpg|thumb|A soap bubble wetting a liquid surface]]\nWhen a soap bubble is in contact with a solid or a liquid surface [[wetting]] is observed.

Therefore, many different minimal surfaces can be designed. It is actually sometimes easier to physically make them than to compute them by [[mathematical modelling]].

Bubbles are useful in teaching concepts starting from 2 years old and into college years. A Swiss university professor, Dr. Natalie Hartzell, has theorized that usage of artificial bubbles for entertainment purposes of young children has shown a positive effect in the region of the child's brain that controls motor skills and is responsible for coordination with children exposed to bubbles at a young age showing measurably better motion skills than those who were not.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1970949| jstor = 1970949| title = The Structure of Singularities in Soap-Bubble-Like and Soap-Film-Like Minimal Surfaces| journal = The Annals of Mathematics| volume = 103| issue = 3| pages = 489–539| year = 1976| last1 = Taylor | first1 = J.

The London-based firm [[Pears (soap)|A. & F. Pears]] created a famous advertising campaign for its soaps in 1886 using a painting by John  Everett Millais of a child playing with bubbles. The Chicago company Chemtoy began selling bubble solution in the 1940s, and bubble solution has been popular with children ever since. According to one  industry estimate, retailers sell around 200 million bottles annually.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n=== Colored bubbles ===\nA bubble is made of transparent water enclosing transparent air. However the [[soap film]] is as thin as the visible light [[wavelength]], resulting in [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferences]]. This creates [[iridescence]] which, together with the bubble's spherical shape and fragility, contributes to its magical effect on children and adults alike. Each colour is the result of varying thicknesses of soap bubble film. [[Tom Noddy]] (who featured in the second episode of [[Marcus du Sautoy]]'s ''[[The Code (2011 TV series)|The Code]]'') gave the analogy of looking at a [[contour line|contour]] map of the bubbles' surface. However, it has become a challenge to produce artificially coloured bubbles.\n\nByron, Melody & Enoch Swetland invented a patented non-toxic bubble (Tekno Bubbles)<ref>{{cite web |author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa061500a.htm |title=Interview with Byron and Melody Swetland - The Inventors of Tekno Bubbles |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=1999-10-05 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704191253/http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa061500a.htm |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}</ref> that glow under UV lighting. These bubbles look like ordinary high quality \"clear\" bubbles under normal lighting, but glow when exposed to true UV light. The brighter the UV lighting, the brighter they glow. The family sold them worldwide, but has since sold their company.\n\nAdding coloured [[dye]] to bubble mixtures fails to produce coloured bubbles, because the dye attaches to the water molecules as opposed to the surfactant. Therefore, a colourless bubble forms with the dye falling to a point at the base. Dye [[chemist]] [[Ram Sabnis|Dr. Ram Sabnis]] has developed a [[lactone]] dye that sticks to the surfactants, enabling brightly coloured bubbles to be formed. [[Crystal violet lactone]] is an example. Another man named Tim Kehoe invented a coloured bubble which loses its colour when exposed to pressure or oxygen, which he is now marketing online as [[Zubbles]], which are non-toxic and non-staining. In 2010, Japanese astronaut [[Naoko Yamazaki]] demonstrated that it is possible to create coloured bubbles in [[microgravity]]. The reason is that the water molecules are spread evenly around the bubble in the low-gravity environment.\n\n=== Freezing ===\n[[File:Frozen Ice Bubble.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Frozen soap bubble on snow at {{convert|-7|C|F}}.]]\nIf soap bubbles are blown into air that is below a [[temperature]] of {{convert|-15|C|F|lk=on}},  they will freeze when they [[Nucleation|touch a surface]]. The air inside will gradually [[diffusion|diffuse]] out, causing the bubble to crumble under its own weight. At temperatures below about {{convert|-25|C|F}}, bubbles will freeze in the air and may shatter when hitting the ground. When a bubble is blown with warm air, the bubble will freeze to an almost perfect sphere at first, but when the warm air cools, and a reduction in volume occurs, there will be a partial collapse of the bubble. A bubble, created successfully at this low temperature, will always be rather small; it will freeze quickly and will shatter if increased further.<ref>Hope Thurston Carter: [http://hopecarter.photoshelter.com/gallery/Frozen-Frosted-Fun/G0000C2ixRgR2ecg/ Frozen Frosted Fun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215083224/http://hopecarter.photoshelter.com/gallery/Frozen-Frosted-Fun/G0000C2ixRgR2ecg |date=2016-02-15 }} hopecarter.photoshelter.com, Michigan, USA, 2014, retrieved 25 January 2017. – Photo catalogue.</ref>\nFreezing of small soap bubbles happens within 2 seconds after setting on snow (at air temperature around –10...–14&nbsp;°C).<!--http://www.accuweather.com/de/de/regensburg/93047/january-weather/167556 recorded –8/–14°C for 23 January 2017, the pictures seem to be taken during night and outside of town. --><ref>pilleuspulcher: [https://plus.google.com/+pilleuspulcher/posts/3ZbXqEr5iYc Freezing soap bubbles on snow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202095553/https://plus.google.com/+pilleuspulcher/posts/3ZbXqEr5iYc |date=2017-02-02 }} google+, Regensburg, Germany, 23 January 2017, retrieved 25 January 2017. – Photos, description in German.</ref>\n\n== Art ==\n[[File:Professional bubble.jpg|thumb|220px|Professional 'bubbleologist' at the 2009 [[Strawberry Fair]] in [[Cambridge]], UK.]]\n[[File:Szappanbuborék - Alex, Deák tér (1).JPG|thumb|Soap bubbles in downtown Budapest]]\nSoap bubble [[performance]]s combine [[entertainment]] with artistic achievement.

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=April 2013}}\n'''Soap films''' are thin layers of [[liquid]] (usually water-based) surrounded by air. For example, if two [[soap bubble]]s come into contact, they merge and a thin film is created in between. Thus, [[foam]]s are composed of a network of films connected by [[Plateau's laws|Plateau borders]]. Films are used as model systems for minimal surfaces, which are widely used in mathematics.\n\n== Stability ==\n[[File:SchemeSoapFilm.png|left|thumb|Figure 1: Organisation of surfactants at both surfaces of the soap film]]\n[[File:MarangoniInSoapFilms.png|thumb|Figure 2: Marangoni surface forces due to inhomogeneities in surfactants concentration. The arrows represent the force direction]]\n\nDaily experience shows that soap bubble formation is not feasible with water or with any pure liquid. Actually, the presence of soap, which is composed at a molecular scale of [[surfactants]], is necessary to stabilize the film. Most of the time, surfactants are [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]], which means they are molecules with both a [[hydrophobic]] and a [[hydrophilic]] part. Thus, they are arranged preferentially at the air/water interface (see figure 1).\n\nSurfactants stabilize films because they create a repulsion between both surfaces of the film, preventing it from thinning and consequentially bursting. This can be shown quantitatively through calculations relating to [[disjoining pressure]]. The main repulsion mechanisms are [[steric]] (the surfactants can not interlace) and electrostatic (if surfactants are charged).\n\nMoreover, surfactants make the film more stable toward thickness fluctuations due to the [[Marangoni effect]]. This gives some elasticity to the interface: if surface concentrations are not homogeneously dispersed at the surface, Marangoni forces will tend to re-homogenize the surface concentration (see figure 2).\n\nEven in the presence of stabilizing surfactants, a soap film does not last forever. Water evaporates with time depending on the humidity of the atmosphere. Moreover, as soon as a film is not perfectly horizontal, the liquid flows toward the bottom due to gravity and the liquid accumulates at the bottom. At the top, the film thins and bursts.\n\n== Importance of surface tension: minimal surfaces ==\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, soap films are considered [[minimal surface]]s. See for instance the approximate numerical method for minimal surfaces form finding at [[Stretched grid method]]. [[Surface tension]], which measures the energy needed to create a surface indeed acts as a physical surface minimizer: since surface energy is proportional to the soap film surface, the film deforms to minimize its surface and, thus its energy.<ref name=Ball61>Ball, 2009. pp. 61–67</ref>\n\nDepending on the support provided, the soap film naturally takes the minimal surface. On a flat support, the soap film is usually flat. But, on more complicate supports, it takes the minimal achievable surface.<ref name=Ball61/>\n\n== Colours ==\n\n[[File:thinfilmbubble.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3: thin film interference in a soap bubble. Notice the golden yellow colour near the top where the film is thin and a few even thinner black spots]]\n\nThe [[iridescence|iridescent]] colours of a soap film are caused by [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfering]] of (internally and externally) reflected light waves, a process called [[Thin-film interference|thin film interference]] and are determined by the thickness of the film. This phenomenon is not the same as the origin of [[rainbow]] colours (caused by the [[refraction]] of internally reflected light), but rather is the same as the phenomenon causing the colours in an oil slick on a wet road.\n\n==Drainage==\n\nIf [[Surfactant|surfactants]] are well chosen<ref name=Ball61/> and the atmospheric humidity and air movements are suitably controlled, a horizontal soap film can last from minutes to hours. In contrast, a vertical soap film is affected by [[gravity]] and so the liquid tends to drain, causing the soap film to thin at the top. Colour depends on film thickness, which accounts for the coloured interference fringes that can be seen at the top of figure 4.\n\n[[File:GenerationSoapFilm.jpg|thumb|upright|Figure 4: Picture of a film taken during its generation. The film is pulled out of a soapy solution and drains from the top.]]\n\n==Bursting==\n\nIf a soap film is unstable, it ends by bursting. A hole is created somewhere in the film and opens very rapidly. [[Surface tension]] indeed leads to surface minimization and, thus, to film disappearance. The hole aperture is not instantaneous and is slowed down by the liquid inertia. The balance between the forces of inertia and surface tension leads to the opening velocity:<ref>{{cite article |title=Comments on a Ruptured Soap Film | last1=Culick|first1=F.E.C. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=31 |issue=6  |date= |year= 1960|month= |origyear= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=1128–1129}}</ref>\n<math>V=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\rho h}}</math> where <math>\\gamma</math> is the liquid surface tension, <math>\\rho</math> is the liquid density and <math>h</math> is the film thickness.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General sources===\n\n* {{cite book | title=Shapes.

For the physics and chemistry behind it, see [[nucleation]].\n\n===Appearance===\nBubbles are visible because they have a different [[refractive index]] (RI) than the surrounding substance. For example, the RI of air is approximately 1.0003 and the RI of water is approximately 1.333. [[Snell's Law]] describes how electromagnetic waves change direction at the interface between two mediums with different IR; thus bubbles can be identified from the accompanying [[refraction]] and [[internal reflection]] even though both the immersed and immersing mediums are transparent.\n\nThe above explanation only holds for bubbles of one medium submerged in another medium (e.g. bubbles of gas in a soft drink); the volume of a [[membrane bubble]] (e.g. soap bubble) will not distort light very much, and one can only see a membrane bubble due to [[thin-film diffraction]] and [[Specular reflection|reflection]].\n\n===Applications===\nNucleation can be intentionally induced, for example to create a [[bubblegram]] in a solid.\n\nIn medical [[ultrasound]] imaging, small encapsulated bubbles called [[Contrast-enhanced ultrasound|contrast agent]] are used to enhance the contrast.\n\nIn thermal [[Inkjet printer|inkjet]] printing, vapor bubbles are used as actuators. They are occasionally used in other [[microfluidics]] applications as actuators.<ref>R. J. Dijkink, J. P. van der Dennen, C. D. Ohl, [[Andrea Prosperetti|A. Prosperetti]],''The ‘acoustic scallop’: a bubble-powered actuator'', J. Micromech. Microeng. '''16''' 1653 (2006)</ref>\n\nThe violent collapse of bubbles ([[cavitation]]) near solid surfaces and the resulting impinging jet constitute the mechanism used in [[Ultrasound#Ultrasonic_cleaning|ultrasonic cleaning]]. The same effect, but on a larger scale, is used in focused energy weapons such as the [[bazooka]] and the [[torpedo]]. [[Pistol shrimp]] also use a collapsing cavitation bubble as a weapon. The same effect is used to treat [[kidney stones]] in a [[lithotripter]]. Marine mammals such as [[dolphins]] and [[whales]] use bubbles for entertainment or as hunting tools. [[Aeration|Aerators]] cause dissolution of gas in the liquid by injecting bubbles.\n\n[[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] and [[metallurgy|metallurgic]] [[engineer]]s rely on bubbles for operations such as distillation, absorption, flotation and spray drying.

Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water, in which case they are also called '''water globules''', or they can be completely submerged into the liquid to which they are directed.\n\n==Background==\n\nAntibubbles are a common but widely unrecognized [[phenomenon]], in part because of their resemblance to air bubbles, and in part because of their typically [[wikt:transience|transient]], or short-lived, nature. With certain ([[soap]]y) solutions, they can be made to last much longer.\n\nAntibubbles can be created by allowing a tap to drip into a container of water to which a drop or two of soap has been added. Being inherently unstable, they are difficult to form. The soap reduces the water's surface tension and allows the skin of air surrounding the droplet to remain in place for more than just a fraction of a second.\n\nJust as [[soap bubble]]s, with air inside and air outside, have negative [[buoyancy]] and tend to sink towards the ground, so antibubbles, with water inside and air outside have positive buoyancy and tend to rise towards the water surface.  But again, just as soap bubbles can be filled with a lighter gas to give them positive buoyancy, so antibubbles can be filled with a heavier liquid to give them negative buoyancy.  Using a [[drinking straw]] to drop droplets of [[sugar]] solution onto soapy water will produce antibubbles that sink.\n\nAntibubbles usually pop when they touch the bottom or the side of the vessel containing the liquid.  This can be prevented by tipping a few teaspoons of sugar into the soapy water and giving it some time to dissolve (but without stirring it).  This will produce a denser layer of sugary water at the bottom of the container.  Antibubbles made from sugar solution will then sink through the water and rest on top of the denser layer at the bottom.  Antibubbles made this way can last for several minutes.\n\nThe layers of an antibubble are water, which it is submerged in, air, and the water trapped in the air.\n\n==Differences between air bubbles and antibubbles==\n[[Image:Bubbles in antibubble.JPG|thumb|Comparison of three different types of bubbles: normal bubbles on the surface, antibubbles on the surface, and submerged air bubbles within an antibubble]]\nThe behavior of antibubbles differs from that of air bubbles in three primary ways, and provides a ready means of identification:\n\n* Antibubbles are held in place by [[surface tension]], and move rapidly across the surface of the water. They can also be seen to ricochet off other objects in the water (such as air bubbles) and off the sides of a container in a manner similar to that of billiard balls.\n* Under ordinary circumstances, antibubbles are short-lived. An air bubble with a soap skin may last several minutes. Antibubbles often have lifetimes of a few seconds or less; however, if the [[electrical potential]] between the inner and outer fluid is equalized, antibubbles can last as long as, or longer than, air bubbles. Antibubbles with a lifetime of at least tens of hours can be produced by adsorbing colloidal particles at the air-water interfaces of the antibubble.\n* Antibubbles [[refract]] light in a different manner than air bubbles. Because they are water droplets, light entering them is refracted back toward its source in the same manner as rainbows are produced. Because of this refraction, antibubbles have a bright appearance.\n\n==Potential uses for antibubbles==\nIf antibubbles can be stabilized they can be used to form a long lasting froth — antifoam. Possible uses for antifoam are as a [[lubricant]] or using the thin passageways permeating antifoam as a filter for air or other gasses.\n\nAntibubbles themselves could be used for chemical processes such as removing pollutants from a smokestack. Replacing the air in antibubble shells with another liquid could be used for a drug delivery system by creating a shell of liquid-[[polymer]] around a drug. Hardening the polymer with [[ultraviolet]] light would create a drug filled capsule.\n\n== Lifetime ==\nThe lifetime of surface antibubbles can be prolonged indefinitely by making the water under them vibrate.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |title = Droplets bouncing over a vibrating fluid layer|last1 = Cabrera-Garcia|first1 = Pablo|last2 = Zenit|first2 = Roberto|year = 2012|eprint = 1210.3538|class = physics.flu-dyn}}</ref><ref>[http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2012/10/drops-on-drops-on-drops.html Drops on Drops on Drops]</ref> These are called \"walking bubbles\" and are used as a model of [[quantum mechanic]]al behavior.<ref>[http://math.mit.edu/~bush/?page_id=484 Hydrodynamic quantum analogs]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Dorbolo S, Caps H, Vandewalle N | title= Fluid instabilities in the birth and death of antibubbles |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/YbI5ddMXDCttIIuJiQAwSQ/article/1367-2630/5/1/161/njp3_1_161.html | journal=New Journal of Physics | volume=5 | issue=Dec. 22 | year=2003 | pages=161 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/5/1/161|bibcode = 2003NJPh....5..161D }}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Het Panhuis M, Hutzler S, Weaire D, Phelan R | title=New variations on the soap film experiments of Plateau I: Experiments under forced drainage | journal=Philosophical Magazine B | volume=78| issue=July 1| year=1998| pages=1–12 | doi=10.1080/014186398258320|bibcode = 1998PMagB..78....1P }}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Kim PG, Stone HA | title=Dynamics of the formation of antibubbles | journal=Europhysics Letters | volume=83 | year=2008 | pages=54001 | doi=10.1209/0295-5075/83/54001|bibcode = 2008EL.....8354001K | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0295-5075/83/5/54001 | issue=5}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Postema M, de Jong N, Schmitz G, van Wamel A | title=Creating antibubbles with ultrasound | journal=Proc IEEE Ultrason Symp | volume= | issue= | year=2005 | pages=977–980}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Tufaile A, Sartotelli JC | title=Bubble and spherical air shell formation dynamics | journal=Physical Review E | volume=66 | issue=November | year=2002 | pages=056204 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.66.056204| pmid=12513583 |bibcode = 2002PhRvE..66e6204T }}\n* {{cite journal | author=Weiss P | title=The rise of antibubbles | journal=Science News | volume=165 | issue=20 | date=May 15, 2004 | pages=311–312 | doi=10.2307/4015222 | jstor=4015222 }}\n* {{cite journal | author=Poortinga A | title=Long-lived antibubbles: stable antibubbles through Pickering stabilization | journal=Langmuir | volume=27 | issue=6 | date=January 20, 2011 | pages=2138–2141 | doi=10.1021/la1048419| pmid=21250742 }}\n* {{cite journal | author=Stong CL | title=The amateur scientist: Curious bubbles in which a gas encloses a liquid instead of the other way around | journal=Scientific American | volume=230 | issue=4 | date=April 1974 | pages=116–120 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0474-116 }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.antibubble.org Antibubble.org]\n* [http://chemistry-chemists.com/N5_2015/ChemistryAndChemists_5_2015-P3-1.html chemistry-chemists.com]\n\n[[Category:Bubbles (physics)]]\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]"

Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of [[LeTourneau University]] presented two papers at the [[American Nuclear Society]] Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, [[deuterated benzene]], [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[uranyl nitrate]]. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of [[Neutron detection|neutron detectors]]. They claimed a liquid [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detector measured neutron levels at 8 [[standard deviation]]s above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated [[Experimental control|control]] liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid.<ref name=\"LeTourneau-2006-11-17\">\"Bubble Fusion Confirmed by LETU Research\" LeTourneau University News (www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/events/Bubble_Fusion_Confirmed_by_LETU_Research.html) link inactive as of 2008-05-10</ref><ref name=\"ANS-pgm\">{{cite web\n  |url    = http://www.ans.org/meetings/docs/2006/wm2006-official.pdf\n  |title  = Technical Sessions by Day (Wednesday)\n  |work   = ANS 2006 Winter Meeting & Nuclear Technology Expo Official Program\n  |page   = 24\n  |date   = November 12–16, 2006\n  |accessdate = 2006-12-06\n  }} (confirmation of presentation)\n</ref><ref name=\"Transactions-ANS=2006\">{{cite journal\n  |last    = Forringer\n  |first   = Edward R.\n  |authorlink = Edward Forringer\n  |author2=David Robbins|author3=Jonathan Martin\n  |date    = 12 November 2006\n  |title   = Confirmation of Neutron Production During Self-Nucleated Acoustic Cavitation\n  |journal = Transactions of the American Nuclear Society\n  |volume  = v.95\n  |page   =736\n  |issn    = 0003-018X}}</ref><ref name=\"spectrum\"/> William M.

In the 2006 ''Nature'' report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he didn't give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they shouldn't publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university's press release present his experiment as \"peer-reviewed\" and \"independent\", when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data.

Multiple layers might be needed to provide [[shock (mechanics)|shock]] and [[vibration]] isolation. A single layer might be used just as a surface protective layer. Bubble wrap is used to form some types of mailing envelopes.\n\nBubble wrap is most often formed from polyethylene ([[LDPE]]) film with a shaped side bonded to a flat side to form air bubbles.  Some types of bubble wrap have a lower permeation barrier film to allow longer useful life and resistance to loss of air in vacuums.\n \nThe bubbles can be as small as 6 millimeters (1/4&nbsp;inch) in diameter, to as large as 26 millimeters (1 inch) or more, to provide added levels of shock absorption during transit.  The most common bubble size is 1 centimeter.{{fact|date=May 2014}}  In addition to the degree of protection available from the size of the air bubbles in the plastic, the plastic material itself can offer some forms of protection for the object in question. For example, when shipping sensitive electronic parts and components, a type of bubble wrap is used that employs an [[anti-static]] plastic that dissipates [[static electricity|static charge]], thereby protecting the sensitive [[electronic chip]]s from static which can damage them.  One of the first widespread uses of bubble wrap was in 1960, shipping [http://www.wikipedia.org/Bubble_Wrap_(brand)] the new [[IBM 1401]] computers to buyers.

Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called \"cavitation\". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.\n\nThe process in which a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]], is called inertial cavitation. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.\n\nSince the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].\n\n== Physics ==\n\nInertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.\n\nOther ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233–252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}</ref>\n\nInertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.\n\nThe physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}</ref>\n\nIn order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation \"bubbles\" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.\n\nThe vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.\n\n==Hydrodynamic cavitation==\nHydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.\n\nThe process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nOrifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChE Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1648 }}</ref>\n\nThe cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes.

These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.<ref>[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain</ref>\n\nThis is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P.

Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).\n\nCavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].\n\nUse of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}</ref><!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. -->\n\nHydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together.

The implication being that, it is not the \"bubbles popping,\" but rather, the bones rubbing together, that causes osteoarthritis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Deweber|first=K|author2=Olszewski, M|author3=Ortolano, R|title=Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=Mar–Apr 2011|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–74|pmid=21383216|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156}}</ref>\n\n===Cleaning===\nIn industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input.

A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within.

In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A.

The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].\n\nAlthough the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.\n\nAfter a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}</ref>\n\n===Pumps and propellers===\nMajor places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.\n\nAs an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure can become around it. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.\n\nCavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:\n\n====Suction cavitation====\n[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.\n\nCommon causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nIn automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.\n\n====Discharge cavitation====\nDischarge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.\n\nDischarge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.\n\n====Cavitation solutions====\nSince all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.\n\nTo have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.<ref>[[Pulp & Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes</ref>\nTo overcome cavitation:\nIncrease suction pressure if possible.\nDecrease liquid temperature if possible.\nThrottle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.\nVent gases off the pump casing.\n\n===Control valves===\n\nCavitation can occur in [[control valves]].<ref>[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136</ref>  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.\n\n===Spillways===\nWhen water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.\n\nExperimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.<ref name=\"Volkart_Rutschmann_1984\">{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors – A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.\n\n===Engines===\nSome larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.\n\nIt is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.\n\nFrom about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.\n\n==In nature==\n\n===Geology===\nSome hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation—namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.\n\nThe loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat.

The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.<ref>Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., & Tyree, M.T., 1996.

[[Fern]] provides a clear example. Namely, the fern sporangium acts as a catapult. The opening phase is driven by water vaporization and by the resulting pressure decrease inside [[annulus (botany)|annulus]] cells (that is the charging phase of the catapult). When the negative pressure approximately reaches the value of 9 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], cavitation occurs. This rapid event triggers the spore dispersal due to the [[elastic energy]] released by the annulus structure (that is the discharging phase of the catapult). The initial spores acceleration is significantly high (up to <math>\\begin{matrix} 10^5 \\end{matrix}</math> times the [[gravitational acceleration]]).<ref name=\"NoblinRojas2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Noblin|first1=X.|last2=Rojas|first2=N.

For a gas bubble with a liquid wall, beyond which is again gas, there are two surfaces, each contributing to the total pressure difference.\nIf the bubble is spherical and the outer radius differs from the inner radius by a small distance, <math>R_o=R_i+d</math>, we find\n\n: <math>\\Delta P = \\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{R_i}+\\frac{1}{R_i+d}\\right) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_i}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{R_i+d}\\right) \\approx \\frac{2 \\gamma}{R} + \\mathcal{O}(d).</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n\nA common example of use is finding the pressure inside an air bubble in pure water, where <math>\\gamma</math> =&nbsp;72&nbsp;mN/m at 25&nbsp;°C (298 K).  The extra pressure inside the bubble is given here for three bubble sizes: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Yet when the diameter is ~3&nbsp;µm, the bubble has an extra atmosphere inside than outside. When the bubble is only several hundred nanometers, the pressure inside can be several atmospheres. One should bear in mind that the surface tension in the numerator can be much smaller in the presence of surfactants or contaminants.  The same calculation can be done for small oil droplets in water, where even in the presence of surfactants and a fairly low interfacial tension <math>\\gamma</math> =&nbsp;5&ndash;10&nbsp;mN/m, the pressure inside 100&nbsp;nm diameter droplets can reach several atmospheres. Such [[emulsion|nanoemulsions]] can be antibacterial because the large pressure inside the oil droplets can cause them to attach to bacteria and simply merge with them, swell them, and \"pop\" them.<ref>http://nano.med.umich.edu/Platforms/Antimicrobial-Nanoemulsion.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ostwald ripening]]\n* [[Kelvin equation]]\n* [[Laplace number]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pressure]]\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Bubbles (physics)]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"

Nucleation is typically defined to be the process that determines how long an observer has to wait before the new phase or self-organized structure appears. For example, if a volume of water is cooled (at atmospheric pressure) below 0° C, it will tend to freeze into ice. Volumes of water cooled only a few degrees below 0° C often stay completely free of ice for long periods. At these conditions, nucleation of ice is either slow or does not occur at all. However, at lower temperatures ice crystals appear after little or no delay. At these conditions ice nucleation is fast.<ref name=pruppacher_book/><ref name=sear_review/> Nucleation is commonly how first-order [[phase transition]]s start, and then it is the start of the process of forming a new [[Phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]]. By contrast, new phases at continuous [[phase transition]]s start to form immediately.\n\nNucleation is often found to be very sensitive to impurities in the system. These impurities may be too small to be seen by the naked eye, but still can control the rate of nucleation. Because of this, it is often important to distinguish between heterogeneous nucleation and homogeneous nucleation. Heterogeneous nucleation occurs at ''nucleation sites'' on surfaces in the system.<ref name=pruppacher_book/> Homogeneous nucleation occurs away from a surface.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n[[File:Nucleation of the equilibrium phase (red) from a metastable phase (white) in the Ising model.ogg|thumb|Nucleation at a surface (black) in the 2D [[Ising model]].

A common mechanism is illustrated in the animation to the right. This shows nucleation of a new phase (shown in red) in an existing phase (white). In the existing phase microscopic fluctuations of the red phase appear and decay continuously, until an unusually large fluctuation of the new red phase is so large it is more favourable for it to grow than to shrink back to nothing. This nucleus of the red phase then grows and converts the system to this phase. The standard theory that describes this behaviour for the nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase is called [[classical nucleation theory]]. However, the CNT fails in describing experimental results of vapour to liquid nucleation even for model substances like Argon by several orders of magnitude.<ref>A. Fladerer, R. Strey: „Homogeneous nucleation and droplet growth in supersaturated argon vapor: The cryogenic nucleation pulse chamber.“ in: The Journal of Chemical Physics 124(16), 164710 (2006).

The [[contact angle]] the nucleus surface makes with the solid horizontal surface decreases from left to right.\nThe surface area of the nucleus decreases as the contact angle decreases. This geometrical effect reduces the barrier in [[classical nucleation theory]] and hence results in faster nucleation on surfaces with smaller contact angles. Also, if instead of the surface being flat it curves towards fluid, then this also reduces the interfacial area and so the nucleation barrier. ]]\n\nHeterogeneous nucleation, nucleation with the nucleus at a surface, is much more common than homogeneous nucleation.<ref name=\"pruppacher_book\"/><ref name=\"sear_review14\"/>\nFor example, in the nucleation of ice from supercooled water droplets, purifying the water to remove all or almost all impurities results in water droplets that freeze below around - 35 C <ref name=\"pruppacher_book\" /><ref name=\"sear_review14\" /><ref name=\":0\" />, whereas water that contains impurities may freeze at - 5 C or warmer<ref name=\"pruppacher_book\" />. Thus here, we have direct evidence that nucleation of ice on impurities can occur at much higher temperatures (smaller degrees of supercooling) than without impurities.\n\nThis observation that heterogeneous nucleation can occur when the rate of homogeneous nucleation is essentially zero, is often understood using [[classical nucleation theory]]. This predicts that the nucleation slows exponentially with the height of a [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] [[Activation energy#Relationship with Gibbs energy|barrier]] &Delta;G*. This barrier comes from the free energy penalty of forming the surface of the growing nucleus. For homogeneous nucleation the nucleus is approximated by a sphere, but as we can see in the schematic of macroscopic droplets to the right, droplets on surfaces are not complete spheres and so the area of the interface between the droplet and the surrounding fluid is less than a sphere's <math> 4\\pi r^2 </math>. This reduction in surface area of the nucleus reduces the height of the barrier to nucleation and so speeds nucleation up exponentially.<ref name=\"sear_review\">{{cite journal |last=Sear |first=R.P. |title=Nucleation: theory and applications to protein solutions and colloidal suspensions |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |year=2007 |volume=19 |page=033101 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/19/3/033101 |url=http://personal.ph.surrey.ac.uk/~phs1rs/review.pdf |issue=3 |bibcode=2007JPCM...19c3101S |citeseerx=10.1.1.605.2550}}</ref>\n\nNucleation can also start at the surface of a liquid.

For a nucleus that may be only of order ten molecules across it is not always clear that we can treat something so small as a volume plus a surface. Also nucleation is an inherently out of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] phenomenon so it is not always obvious that its rate can be estimated using equilibrium properties.\n\nHowever, modern computers are powerful enough to calculate essentially exact nucleation rates for simple models. These have been compared with the classical theory, for example for the case of nucleation of the crystal phase in the model of hard spheres. This is a model of perfectly hard spheres in thermal motion, and is a simple model of some [[colloids]]. For the crystallization of hard spheres the classical theory is a very reasonable approximate theory.<ref name=auer04>{{cite journal |last=Auer |first=S. |author2=D.

Nucleation of the crystal is then being prevented by a substantial barrier. This has consequences, for example cold high altitude clouds may contain large numbers of small liquid water droplets that are far below 0° C.<ref name=pruppacher_book/>\n\nIn small volumes, such as in small droplets, only one nucleation event may be needed for crystallisation. In these small volumes, the time until the first crystal appears is usually defined to be the nucleation time.<ref name=\"sear_review14\" /> In larger volumes many nucleation events will occur. A simple model for crystallisation in that case, that combines nucleation and growth is the [[Avrami equation|KJMA or Avrami model]].\n\n===Primary and secondary nucleation===\n\nThe time until the appearance of the first crystal is also called primary nucleation time, to distinguish it from secondary nucleation times. Primary here refers to the first nucleus to form, while secondary nuclei are crystal nuclei produced from a preexisting crystal. Primary nucleation describes the transition to a new phase that does not rely on the new phase already being present, either because it is the very first nucleus of that phase to form, or because the nucleus forms far from any pre-existing piece of the new phase. Particularly in the study of crystallisation, secondary nucleation can be important. This is the formation of nuclei of a new crystal directly caused by pre-existing crystals.<ref name=\"botsaris1976\">{{cite book |last1=Botsaris |first1=GD |editor1-last=Mullin |editor1-first=J |title=Industrial Crystallization |date=1976 |publisher=Springer |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-7258-9_1 |chapter=Secondary Nucleation — A Review |isbn=978-1-4615-7260-2}}</ref>\n\nFor example, if the crystals are in a solution and the system is subject to shearing forces, small crystal nuclei could be sheared off a growing crystal, thus increasing the number of crystals in the system. So both primary and secondary nucleation increase the number of crystals in the system but their mechanisms are very different, and secondary nucleation relies on crystals already being present.\n\n===Experimental observations on the nucleation times for the crystallisation of small volumes===\n\nIt is typically difficult to experimentally study the nucleation of crystals. The nucleus is microscopic, and thus too small to be directly observed. In large liquid volumes there are typically multiple nucleation events, and it is difficult to disentangle the effects of nucleation from those of growth of the nucleated phase. These problems can be overcome by working with small droplets. As nucleation is [[stochastic]], many droplets are needed so that statistics for the nucleation events can be obtained. \n[[File:Fraction of a set of supercooled liquid tin droplets that have not frozen, as a function of time(png).png|thumb|Fraction of a set of supercooled liquid tin droplets that have not frozen, as a function of time(png)|thumbnail|right|The black triangles are the fraction of a large set of small supercooled liquid tin droplets that are still liquid, i.e., where the crystal state has not nucleated, as a function of time.

The red curve is a fit of a [[Gompertz function]] to the data. This is a simplified version of the model Pound and La Mer used to model their data.<ref name=pound52 /> The model assumes that nucleation occurs due to impurity particles in the liquid tin droplets, and it makes the simplifying assumption that all impurity particles produce nucleation at the same rate. It also assumes that these particles are [[Poisson distribution|Poisson distributed]] among the liquid tin droplets. The fit values are that the nucleation rate due to a single impurity particle is 0.02/s, and the average number of impurity particles per droplet is 1.2. Note that about 30% of the tin droplets never freeze; the data plateau at a fraction of about 0.3. Within the model this is assumed to be because, by chance, these droplets do not have even one impurity particle and so there is no heterogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation is assumed to be negligible on the timescale of this experiment. The remaining droplets freeze in a stochastic way, at rates 0.02/s if they have one impurity particle, 0.04/s if they have two, and so on.\n\nThese data are just one example, but they illustrate common features of the nucleation of crystals in that there is clear evidence for heterogeneous nucleation, and that nucleation is clearly stochastic.\n\n===Ice===\n\nThe freezing of small water droplets to ice is an important process, particularly in the formation and dynamics of clouds.<ref name=pruppacher_book/> Water (at atmospheric pressure) does not freeze at 0° C, but rather at temperatures that tend to decrease as the volume of the water decreases and as the water impurity increases.<ref name=pruppacher_book /> [[File:Survival curve 34.5 micrometre water droplets 1950 NACA Dorsch & Hacker ice nucleation.png|thumb|Survival curve for water droplets 34.5 μm in diameter.

The plot shows the fraction of a large set of water droplets, that are still liquid water, i.e., have not yet frozen, as a function of temperature.

The excess vapor begins to nucleate and to form small water droplets which form a cloud. Nucleation of the droplets of liquid water is heterogeneous, occurring on particles referred to as [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. [[Cloud seeding]] is the process of adding artificial condensation nuclei to quicken the formation of clouds.\n* Bubbles of [[carbon dioxide]] ''nucleate'' shortly after the pressure is released from a container of [[carbonation|carbonated]] liquid. \n[[Image:Nucleation finger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nucleation of carbon dioxide bubbles around a finger]]\n* Nucleation in [[boiling]] can occur in the bulk [[liquid]] if the pressure is reduced so that the liquid becomes [[superheating|superheated]] with respect to the pressure-dependent boiling point. More often, nucleation occurs on the heating surface, at ''nucleation sites''. Typically, nucleation sites are tiny crevices where free gas-liquid surface is maintained or spots on the heating surface with lower [[wetting]] properties. Substantial superheating of a liquid can be achieved after the liquid is de-gassed and if the heating surfaces are clean, smooth and made of materials well wetted by the liquid.\n* Some [[champagne stirrer]]s operate by providing many nucleation sites via high surface-area and sharp corners, speeding the release of bubbles and removing carbonation from the wine.\n* The [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption]] offers another example. The surface of Mentos candy provides nucleation sites for the formation of carbon-dioxide bubbles from carbonated soda.\n* Both the [[bubble chamber]] and the [[cloud chamber]] rely on nucleation, of bubbles and droplets, respectively.\n\n===Examples of the nucleation of crystals===\n* The most common [[crystallisation]] process on Earth is the formation of ice. Liquid water does not freeze at 0° C unless there is ice already present, cooling significantly below 0° C is required to nucleate ice and so for the water to freeze.

Frenzel]] and [[H. Schultes]] put an ultrasound [[transducer]] in a tank of photographic [[developer fluid]]. They hoped to speed up the development process. Instead, they noticed tiny dots on the film after developing and realized that the bubbles in the fluid were emitting light with the ultrasound turned on.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It was too difficult to analyze the effect in early experiments because of the complex environment of a large number of short-lived bubbles. (This experiment is also ascribed to N.&nbsp;Marinesco and J.&nbsp;J. Trillat in 1933, which also credits them with independent discovery). This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL).\n\nIn 1960 Dr. Peter Jarman from Imperial College of London proposed the most reliable theory of SL phenomenon. The collapsing bubble generates an imploding shock wave that compresses and heats the gas at the center of the bubble to extremely high temperature.\n\nIn 1989 an experimental advance was introduced by [[D. Felipe Gaitan]] and [[Lawrence Crum]], who produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In SBSL, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the [[standing wave]]. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon, because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt [[steel]], as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about 12,000 [[kelvin]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ndiaye AA, Pflieger R, Siboulet B, Molina J, Dufrêche JF, Nikitenko SI | title = Nonequilibrium vibrational excitation of OH radicals generated during multibubble cavitation in water | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A | volume = 116 | issue = 20 | pages = 4860–7 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22559729 | doi = 10.1021/jp301989b | bibcode = 2012JPCA..116.4860N }}</ref> Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner [[temperature]] of such a bubble well above one million [[kelvin]]s was postulated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=William C.|last2=Clarke|first2=Douglas B.|last3=White|first3=John W.|last4=Young|first4=David A.|date=September 1994|title=Hydrodynamic simulations of bubble collapse and picosecond sonoluminescence|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.868124|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2979–2985|doi=10.1063/1.868124|issn=1070-6631}}</ref> This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] indicate temperatures around {{convert|20000|K|C F}}.<ref name=Illinois/>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:Sonoluminescence.jpg|right|thumb|Long exposure image of multi-bubble sonoluminescence created by a high-intensity [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] horn immersed in a beaker of liquid]]\n\nSonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.\n\nSome facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1–{{val|10|ul=mW}}.\n* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light—about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter—depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).\n* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities]].\n* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.\n\nSpectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.<ref name=flannigan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Didenko YT, McNamara WB, Suslick KS | title = Effect of noble gases on sonoluminescence temperatures during multibubble cavitation | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 777–80 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11017370 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.777 | bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84..777D }}</ref> Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.\n\nWriting in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', chemists [[David J.

Here, ''μ'' is the [[viscosity]], ''p'' the [[pressure]], and ''γ'' the [[surface tension]]. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse.  Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble.<ref name=\"pmid10046927\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barber BP, Putterman SJ | title = Light scattering measurements of the repetitive supersonic implosion of a sonoluminescing bubble | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 69 | issue = 26 | pages = 3839–3842 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 10046927 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.3839 }}</ref> Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh–Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce.\n\n==Mechanism of phenomenon==\n{{main|Mechanism of sonoluminescence}}\nThe mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown.

Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner MP, Hilgenfeldt S, Lohse D | title = Single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | date = May 2002 | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 425–484 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.425 }}</ref> An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20–40% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of [[water vapor]]. Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matula TJ, Crum LA | title = Evidence for gas exchange in single-bubble sonoluminescence. | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = January 1998 | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 865–868 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.865 }}</ref> The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the [[argon flash]] devices.\n\nDuring bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).\n\nComputations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.\n\nAny discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter.

According to the basic insights of [[Marston Morse]], a typical differentiable function on a manifold will reflect the topology quite directly. Morse theory allows one to find [[CW complex|CW structures]] and [[handle decomposition]]s on manifolds and to obtain substantial information about their [[homology (mathematics)|homology]].\n\nBefore Morse, [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had developed some of the ideas of Morse theory in the context of [[topography]]. Morse originally applied his theory to [[geodesic]]s ([[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of the energy [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on paths). These techniques were used in [[Raoul Bott]]'s proof of his [[Bott periodicity theorem|periodicity theorem]].\n\nThe analogue of Morse theory for complex manifolds is [[Picard–Lefschetz theory]].\n\n==Basic concepts==\n[[Image:Saddle point.png|thumb|right|A saddle point]]\n\nConsider, for purposes of illustration, a mountainous landscape ''M''.  If ''f'' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>M \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> sending each [[Point (geometry)|point]] to its elevation, then the [[inverse image]] of a point in <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is a [[contour line]] (more generally, a [[level set]]). Each connected component of a contour line is either a point, a simple [[closed curve]], or a closed curve with a [[Singular point of a curve|double point]].  Contour lines may also have points of higher order (triple points, etc.), but these are unstable and may be removed by a slight deformation of the landscape.  Double points in contour lines occur at [[saddle points]], or passes.  Saddle points are points where the surrounding landscape curves up in one direction and down in the other.\n\n[[Image:Saddle contours.svg|thumb|left|Contour lines around a saddle point]]\nImagine flooding this landscape with water. Then, the region covered by water when the water reaches an elevation of ''a'' is <math>f^{-1}(-\\infty, a]</math>, or the points with elevation less than or equal to ''a''.  Consider how the topology of this region changes as the water rises.  It appears, intuitively, that it does not change except when ''a'' passes the height of a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]; that is, a point where the [[gradient]] of ''f'' is 0 (that is the [[Jacobian matrix]] acting as a linear map from the tangent space at that point to the tangent space at its image under the map ''f'' does not have maximal rank).  In other words, it does not change except when the water either (1) starts filling a basin, (2) covers a saddle (a [[mountain pass]]), or (3) submerges a peak.\n\n[[Image:3D-Leveltorus.png|thumb|right|The torus]]\nTo each of these three types of critical points – basins, passes, and peaks (also called minima, saddles, and maxima) – one associates a number called the index. Intuitively speaking, the index of a critical point ''b'' is the number of independent directions around ''b'' in which ''f'' decreases. More precisely the index of a non-degenerate critical point ''b'' of ''f'' is the dimension of the largest subspace of the tangent space to ''M'' at ''b'' on which the [[hessian matrix | Hessian]] of ''f'' is negative definite. Therefore, the indices of basins, passes, and peaks are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. \n\nDefine <math>M^a</math> as  <math>f^{-1}(-\\infty, a]</math>. Leaving the context of topography, one can make a similar analysis of how the topology of <math>M^a</math> changes as ''a'' increases when ''M'' is a [[torus]] oriented as in the image and ''f'' is projection on a vertical axis, taking a point to its height above the plane.\n\n[[Image:3D-Cylinder and disk with handle.png|thumb|left|These figures are homotopy equivalent.]]\n[[Image:3D-Cylinder with handle and torus with hole.png|thumb|right|These figures are homotopy equivalent.]]\nStarting from the bottom of the torus, let ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', and ''s'' be the four critical points of index 0, 1, 1, and 2, respectively. When ''a'' is less than ''f''(''p'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, then <math>M^a</math> is the empty set.  After ''a'' passes the level of ''p'', when <math>0<a<f(q)</math>, then <math>M^a</math> is a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]], which is [[homotopy equivalent]] to a point (a 0-cell), which has been \"attached\" to the empty set. Next, when ''a'' exceeds the level of ''q'', and <math>f(q)<a<f(r)</math>, then <math>M^a</math> is a cylinder, and is homotopy equivalent to a disk with a 1-cell attached (image at left). Once ''a'' passes the level of ''r'', and ''f''(''r'')&nbsp;<&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''f''(''s''), then ''M''<sup>''a''</sup> is a torus with a disk removed, which is homotopy equivalent to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] with a 1-cell attached (image at right).  Finally, when ''a'' is greater than the critical level of ''s'', <math>M^a</math> is a torus. A torus, of course, is the same as a torus with a disk removed with a disk (a 2-cell) attached.\n\nOne therefore appears to have the following rule: the topology of <math>M^{\\alpha}</math> does not change except when <math>\\alpha</math> passes the height of a critical point, and when <math>\\alpha</math> passes the height of a critical point of index <math>\\gamma</math>, a <math>\\gamma</math>-cell is attached to <math>M^{\\alpha}</math>.  This does not address the question of what happens when two critical points are at the same height.  That situation can be resolved by a slight perturbation of ''f''.  In the case of a landscape (or a manifold [[embedding|embedded]] in [[Euclidean space]]), this perturbation might simply be tilting the landscape slightly, or rotating the coordinate system.\n\nOne should be careful and verify the non-degeneracy of critical points.  To see what can pose a problem, let ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R''' and let ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>.  Then 0 is a critical point of ''f'', but the topology of <math>M^{\\alpha}</math> does not change when α passes 0.   The problem is that the second derivative of ''f''  is also 0 at 0, i.e. the [[hessian matrix | Hessian]] of f vanishes and this critical point is degenerate.  Note that this situation is unstable: by slightly deforming ''f'', the degenerate critical point is either removed or breaks up into two non-degenerate critical points.\n\n==Formal development==\nFor a real-valued [[smooth function]] ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''R''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] ''M'', the points where the [[differential (calculus)|differential]] of ''f'' vanishes are called [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of ''f'' and their images under ''f'' are called [[critical value]]s.  If at a critical point ''b'', the matrix of second partial derivatives (the [[Hessian matrix]]) is non-singular, then ''b'' is called a '''non-degenerate critical point'''; if the Hessian is singular then ''b'' is a '''degenerate critical point'''.\n\nFor the functions\n:<math>f(x)=a + b x+ c x^2+d x^3+\\cdots</math>\nfrom '''R''' to '''R''', ''f'' has a critical point at the origin if ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, which is non-degenerate if ''c''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 (i.e. ''f'' is of the form ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''cx''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...) and degenerate if ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (i.e. ''f'' is of the form ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''dx''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...). A less trivial example of a degenerate critical point is the origin of the [[monkey saddle]].\n\nThe '''[[Critical point (mathematics)#Several variables|index]]''' of a non-degenerate critical point ''b'' of ''f'' is the dimension of the largest subspace of the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''b'' on which the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite, semidefinite and indefinite matrices|negative definite]]. This corresponds to the intuitive notion that the index is the number of directions in which ''f'' decreases.  The degeneracy and index of a critical point are independent of the choice of the local coordinate system used, as shown by [[Sylvester's law of inertia|Sylvester's Law]].\n\n===Morse lemma===\nLet ''b'' be a non-degenerate critical point of ''f'' : ''M'' → '''R'''.  Then there exists a [[chart (topology)|chart]] (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''U'' of ''b'' such that <math>x_i(b) = 0</math> for all ''i'' and\n:<math>f(x) = f(b) - x_1^2 - \\cdots - x_{\\alpha}^2 + x_{\\alpha +1}^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2 </math>\nthroughout ''U''. Here α is equal to the index of ''f'' at ''b''. As a corollary of the Morse lemma, one sees that non-degenerate critical points are [[isolated point|isolated]].  (Regarding an extension to the complex domain see [[Method of steepest descent#Complex Morse Lemma|Complex Morse Lemma]]. For a generalization, see [[Morse–Palais lemma]]).\n\n=== Fundamental theorems ===\nA smooth real-valued function on a manifold ''M'' is a '''Morse function''' if it has no degenerate critical points.  A basic result of Morse theory says that almost all functions are Morse functions.  Technically, the Morse functions form an open, dense subset of all smooth functions ''M''&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''R''' in the ''C''<sup>2</sup> topology.  This is sometimes expressed as \"a typical function is Morse\" or \"a [[generic property|generic]] function is Morse\".\n\nAs indicated before, we are interested in the question of when the topology of ''M''<sup>''a''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f''<sup>−1</sup>(−∞,&nbsp;''a''] changes as ''a'' varies.  Half of the answer to this question is given by the following theorem.\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Suppose ''f'' is a smooth real-valued function on ''M'', ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''f''<sup>−1</sup>[''a'',&nbsp;''b''] is [[compact space|compact]], and there are no critical values between ''a'' and ''b''.  Then  ''M''<sup>''a''</sup> is [[diffeomorphic]] to ''M''<sup>''b''</sup>, and ''M''<sup>''b''</sup> [[deformation retract]]s onto  ''M''<sup>''a''</sup>.\n\nIt is also of interest to know how the topology of ''M''<sup>''a''</sup> changes when ''a'' passes a critical point.  The following theorem answers that question.\n\n:'''Theorem.'''  Suppose ''f'' is a smooth real-valued function on ''M'' and ''p'' is a non-degenerate critical point of ''f'' of index γ, and that ''f''(''p'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''.  Suppose ''f''<sup>−1</sup>[''q''&nbsp;−&nbsp;ε,&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε] is compact and contains no critical points besides ''p''.  Then ''M''<sup>''q''+ε</sup> is [[homotopy equivalent]] to ''M''<sup>''q''−ε</sup> with a γ-cell attached.\n\nThese results generalize and formalize the 'rule' stated in the previous section.  \n\nUsing the two previous results and the fact that there exists a Morse function on any differentiable manifold, one can prove that any differentiable manifold is a CW complex with an ''n''-cell for each critical point of index ''n''.  To do this, one needs the technical fact that one can arrange to have a single critical point on each critical level, which is usually proven by using [[gradient-like vector field]]s to rearrange the critical points.\n\n===Morse inequalities===\nMorse theory can be used to prove some strong results on the homology of manifolds.  The number of critical points of index γ of ''f'' &nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''R''' is equal to the number of γ cells in the CW structure on ''M'' obtained from \"climbing\" ''f''.  Using the fact that the alternating sum of the ranks of the homology groups of a topological space is equal to the alternating sum of the ranks of the chain groups from which the homology is computed, then by using the cellular chain groups (see [[cellular homology]]) it is clear that the [[Euler characteristic]] <math>\\chi(M)</math> is equal to the sum\n\n:<math>\\sum(-1)^\\gamma C^\\gamma\\,=\\chi(M)</math>\n\nwhere ''C''<sup>''γ''</sup> is the number of critical points of index γ. Also by cellular homology, the rank of the ''n''<sup>th</sup> homology group of a CW complex ''M'' is less than or equal to the number of ''n''-cells in ''M''. Therefore, the rank of the γ<sup>th</sup> homology group,i.e., the [[Betti number]] <math>b_\\gamma(M)</math>, is less than or equal to the number of critical points of index γ of a Morse function on ''M''. These facts can be strengthened to obtain the '''Morse inequalities''':\n\n:<math>C^\\gamma -C^{\\gamma -1}\\pm \\cdots + (-1)^\\gamma C^0 \\ge b_\\gamma(M)-b_{\\gamma-1}(M)\\pm \\cdots + (-1)^\\gamma b_0(M).</math>\n\nIn particular, for any\n\n: <math>\\gamma \\in \\{0,\\dots,n=\\dim M\\},</math>\n\none has\n\n:<math>C^\\gamma\\ge b_\\gamma(M).</math>\n\nThis gives a powerful tool to study manifold topology. Suppose on a closed manifold there exists a Morse function ''f'' : ''M'' → '''R''' with precisely ''k'' critical points. In what way does the existence of the function ''f'' restrict ''M''? The case ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 was studied by [[Georges Reeb]] in 1952; the [[Reeb sphere theorem]] states that ''M'' is homeomorphic to a sphere <math>S^n</math>. The case ''k'' = 3 is possible only in a small number of low dimensions, and ''M'' is homeomorphic to an [[Eells–Kuiper manifold]].\nIn 1982 [[Edward Witten]] developed an analytic approach to the Morse inequalities by considering the [[de Rham complex]] for the perturbed operator \n<math>d_t = e^{-tf} d e^{tf}.</math><ref>{{harvnb|Roe|1998}}</ref>\n\n===Application to classification of closed 2-manifolds===\nMorse theory has been used to classify closed 2-manifolds up to diffeomorphism. If ''M'' is oriented, then ''M'' is classified by its genus ''g'' and is diffeomorphic to a sphere with ''g'' handles: thus if ''g'' = 0, ''M'' is diffeomorphic to the 2-sphere; and if ''g'' > 0, ''M'' is diffeomorphic to the [[connected sum]] of ''g'' 2-tori. If ''N'' is unorientable, it is classified by a number ''g'' > 0 and is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of ''g'' real projective spaces ''RP''<sup>2</sup>. In particular two closed 2-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if they are diffeomorphic.<ref>{{harvnb|Smale|1994}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gauld|1982}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shastri|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Morse homology===\n[[Morse homology]] is a particularly easy way to understand the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of [[smooth manifold]]s. It is defined using a generic choice of Morse function and [[Riemannian metric]].  The basic theorem is that the resulting homology is an invariant of the manifold (i.e., independent of the function and metric) and isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold; this implies that the Morse and singular [[Betti number]]s agree and gives an immediate proof of the Morse inequalities.  An infinite dimensional analog of Morse homology in [[symplectic geometry]] is known as [[Floer homology]].\n\n==Morse–Bott theory==\nThe notion of a Morse function can be generalized to consider functions that have nondegenerate manifolds of critical points. A '''Morse–Bott function''' {{anchor|Morse–Bott function}} is a smooth function on a manifold whose [[critical set]] is a closed submanifold and whose Hessian is non-degenerate in the normal direction. (Equivalently, the kernel of the Hessian at a critical point equals the tangent space to the critical submanifold.) A Morse function is the special case where the critical manifolds are zero-dimensional (so the Hessian at critical points is non-degenerate in every direction, i.e., has no kernel).\n\nThe index is most naturally thought of as a pair\n\n:<math>(i_-, i_+),</math>\n\nwhere <math>i_-</math> is the dimension of the unstable manifold at a given point of the critical manifold, and <math>i_+</math> is equal to <math>i_-</math> plus the dimension of the critical manifold. If the Morse–Bott function is perturbed by a small function on the critical locus, the index of all critical points of the perturbed function on a critical manifold of the unperturbed function will lie between <math>i_-</math> and <math>i_+</math>.\n\nMorse–Bott functions are useful because generic Morse functions are difficult to work with; the functions one can visualize, and with which one can easily calculate, typically have symmetries. They often lead to positive-dimensional critical manifolds. [[Raoul Bott]] used Morse–Bott theory in his original proof of the [[Bott periodicity theorem]].\n\n[[Round function]]s are examples of Morse–Bott functions, where the critical sets are (disjoint unions of) circles.\n\n[[Morse homology]] can also be formulated for Morse–Bott functions; the differential in Morse–Bott homology is computed by a [[spectral sequence]].  Frederic Bourgeois sketched an approach in the course of his work on a Morse–Bott version of symplectic field theory, but this work was never published due to substantial analytic difficulties.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Almgren–Pitts min-max theory]]\n* [[Digital Morse theory]]\n* [[Discrete Morse theory]]\n* [[Jacobi set]]\n* [[Lagrangian Grassmannian]]\n* [[Lusternik–Schnirelmann category]]\n* [[Morse–Smale system]]\n* [[Sard's lemma]]\n* [[Stratified Morse theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|last=Bott|first= Raoul|authorlink=Raoul Bott| year=1988|url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1988__68__99_0 |title=Morse Theory Indomitable| journal=[[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]]|volume=68|pages= 99–114}}\n* {{citation|last=Bott|first= Raoul|authorlink=Raoul Bott| year=1982| title=Lectures on Morse theory, old and new|journal= [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|series= (N.S.) |volume=7|issue=2|pages= 331–358}}\n* Cayley, Arthur (1859). \"[http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/cayleyconslo.pdf On Contour and Slope Lines]\".

The cells which have no pairs, i.e., whose function values are strictly higher than their boundary cells '''and''' strictly lower than their co-boundary cells are called ''critical'' cells. Thus, a discrete Morse function partitions the CW complex into three distinct cell collections: <math>\\mathcal{X} = \\mathcal{A} \\sqcup \\mathcal{K} \\sqcup \\mathcal{Q}</math>, where:\n\n# <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> denotes the '''critical''' cells which are unpaired,\n# <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> denotes cells which are paired with boundary cells, and\n# <math>\\mathcal{Q}</math> denotes cells which are paired with co-boundary cells.\n\nBy construction, there is a [[bijection]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] between <math>k</math>-dimensional cells in <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> and the <math>(k-1)</math>-dimensional cells in <math>\\mathcal{Q}</math>, which can be denoted by <math>p^k:\\mathcal{K}^k \\to \\mathcal{Q}^{k-1}</math> for each [[natural number]] <math>k</math>.

For instance, over the [[integer]]s <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>, the only allowed values are <math>\\pm 1</math>. This technical requirement is guaranteed, for instance, when one assumes that <math>\\mathcal{X}</math> is a regular CW complex over <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\nThe fundamental result of discrete Morse theory establishes that the CW complex <math>\\mathcal{X}</math> is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] on the level of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to a new complex <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> consisting of only the critical cells. The paired cells in <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{Q}</math> describe ''gradient paths'' between adjacent critical cells which can be used to obtain the boundary operator on <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.

      "text": "{{Short description|Symplectic topology tool}}\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Floer [[homology (mathematics)|homology]]''' is a tool for studying [[symplectic geometry]] and low-dimensional [[topology]].  Floer homology is a novel [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] that arises as an infinite-dimensional analog of finite-dimensional [[Morse homology]].  [[Andreas Floer]] introduced the first version of Floer homology, now called Hamiltonian Floer homology, in his proof of the [[Arnold conjecture]] in symplectic geometry.  Floer also developed a closely related theory for [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s of a symplectic [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]]. A third construction, also due to Floer, associates homology groups to closed three-dimensional manifolds using the [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills functional]].  These constructions and their descendants play a fundamental role in current investigations into the topology of symplectic and contact manifolds as well as (smooth) three- and four-dimensional manifolds.\n\nFloer homology is typically defined by associating to the object of interest an infinite-dimensional manifold and a real valued function on it.  In the symplectic version, this is the free [[loop space]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] with the symplectic action functional. For the ([[instanton]]) version for three-manifolds, it is the space of SU(2)-[[connection (mathematics)|connections]] on a three-dimensional manifold with the [[Chern–Simons]] functional.  Loosely speaking, Floer homology is the Morse homology of the function on the infinite-dimensional manifold.   A Floer [[chain complex]] is formed from the [[abelian group]] spanned by the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of the function (or possibly certain collections of critical points).  The [[differential form|differential]] of the chain complex is defined by counting the function's [[gradient]] [[flow lines]] connecting certain pairs of critical points (or collections thereof).  Floer homology is the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of this chain complex.\n\nThe gradient flow line equation, in a situation where Floer's ideas can be successfully applied, is typically a  geometrically meaningful and analytically tractable equation.  For symplectic Floer homology, the gradient flow equation for a path in the loopspace is (a perturbed version of) the [[Cauchy–Riemann equation]] for a map of a cylinder (the total space of the path of loops) to the symplectic manifold of interest; solutions are known as [[pseudoholomorphic curves]].  The [[Gromov's compactness theorem (topology)|Gromov compactness theorem]] is then used to show that the differential is well-defined and squares to zero, so that the Floer homology is defined.  For instanton Floer homology, the gradient flow equations is exactly the Yang-Mills equation on the three-manifold crossed with the real line.\n\n==Symplectic Floer homology==\n\nSymplectic Floer Homology (SFH) is a homology theory associated to a [[symplectic manifold]] and a nondegenerate [[symplectomorphism]] of it.  If the symplectomorphism is [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphism|Hamiltonian]], the homology arises from studying the [[symplectic action]] functional on the ([[universal cover]] of the) [[free loop space]] of a symplectic manifold.  SFH is invariant under [[Hamiltonian isotopy]] of the symplectomorphism.\n\nHere, nondegeneracy means that 1 is not an eigenvalue of the derivative of the symplectomorphism at any of its fixed points.  This condition implies that the fixed points are isolated.  SFH is the homology of the [[chain complex]] generated by the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of such a symplectomorphism, where the differential counts certain [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]s in the product of the real line and the [[mapping torus]] of the symplectomorphism.  This  itself is a symplectic manifold of dimension two greater than the original manifold.  For an appropriate choice of [[almost complex structure]], punctured [[holomorphic curve]]s (of finite energy) in it have cylindrical ends asymptotic to the loops in the [[mapping torus]] corresponding to fixed points of the symplectomorphism.  A relative index may be defined between pairs of fixed points, and the differential counts the number of holomorphic cylinders with relative index&nbsp;1.\n\nThe symplectic Floer homology of a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism of a compact manifold is isomorphic to the singular homology of the underlying manifold.  Thus, the sum of the [[Betti number]]s of that manifold yields the lower bound predicted by one version of the [[Arnold conjecture]] for the number of fixed points for a nondegenerate symplectomorphism.  The SFH of a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism also has a [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]] product that is a deformed [[cup product]] equivalent to [[quantum cohomology]].  A version of the product also exists for non-exact symplectomorphisms.\n\nFor the [[cotangent bundle]] of a manifold M, the Floer homology depends on the choice of Hamiltonian due to its noncompactness.  For Hamiltonians that are quadratic at infinity, the Floer homology is the [[singular homology]] of the free loop space of M (proofs of various versions of this statement are due to Viterbo, Salamon–Weber, Abbondandolo–Schwarz, and Cohen). There are more complicated  operations on the Floer homology of a cotangent bundle that correspond to the [[string topology]] operations on the homology of the loop space of the underlying manifold.\n\nThe symplectic version of Floer homology figures in a crucial way in the formulation of the [[homological mirror symmetry]] conjecture.\n\n===PSS isomorphism===\nIn 1996 S. Piunikhin, D. Salamon and M. Schwarz summarized the results about the relation between Floer homology and [[quantum cohomology ring|quantum cohomology]] and formulated as the following.{{harvtxt|Piunikhin|Salamon|Schwarz|1996}}\n\n:*The Floer cohomology groups of the loop space of a ''semi-positive'' symplectic manifold (''M'',ω) are naturally isomorphic to the ordinary [[cohomology]] of ''M'', tensored by a suitable [[Novikov ring]] associated the group of [[deck transformation|covering transformations]].\n:*This isomorphism intertwines the [[quantum cup product]] structure on the cohomology of M with the pair-of-pants product on Floer homology.\n\nThe above condition of semi-positive and the compactness of symplectic manifold ''M'' is required for us to obtain [[quantum cohomology#Novikov ring|Novikov ring]] and for the definition of both Floer homology and quantum cohomology. The semi-positive condition means that one of the following holds (note that the three cases are not disjoint):\n\n:*<math>\\langle [\\omega],A\\rangle=\\lambda\\langle c_1,A\\rangle</math> for every ''A'' in π<sub>2</sub>(''M'') where λ≥0 (''M'' is ''monotone'').\n:*<math>\\langle c_1,A\\rangle=0</math> for every ''A'' in {{pi}}<sub>2</sub>(''M'').\n:*The ''minimal Chern Number'' ''N''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;0 defined by <math>\\langle c_1,\\pi_2(M)\\rangle=N\\mathbb{Z}</math> is greater than or equal to ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2.\n\nThe quantum cohomology group of symplectic manifold ''M'' can be defined as the tensor products of the ordinary cohomology with Novikov ring Λ, i.e.\n\n::<math>QH_*(M)=H_*(M)\\otimes\\Lambda.</math>\n\nThis construction of Floer homology explains the independence on the choice of the [[almost complex structure]] on ''M'' and the isomorphism to Floer homology provided from the ideas of [[Morse theory]] and [[pseudoholomorphic curves]], where we must recognize the [[Poincaré duality]] between homology and cohomology as the background.\n\n==Floer homology of three-manifolds==\nThere are several  equivalent Floer homologies associated to [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[three-manifolds]].  Each yields three types of homology groups, which fit into an [[exact triangle]].  A knot in a three-manifold induces a filtration on the chain complex of each theory, whose chain homotopy type is a knot invariant.  (Their homologies satisfy similar formal properties to the combinatorially-defined [[Khovanov homology]].)\n\nThese homologies are closely related to the Donaldson and Seiberg invariants of 4-manifolds, as well as to  Taubes's Gromov invariant of symplectic 4-manifolds; the differentials of the corresponding three-manifold homologies to these theories are studied by considering solutions to the relevant differential equations ([[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills]], [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory|Seiberg–Witten]], and [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann]], respectively) on the 3-manifold cross&nbsp;'''R'''.  The 3-manifold Floer homologies should also be the targets of relative invariants for four-manifolds with boundary, related by gluing constructions to the invariants of a closed 4-manifold obtained by gluing together bounded 3-manifolds along their boundaries.  (This is closely related to the notion of a [[topological quantum field theory]].)  For Heegaard Floer homology, the 3-manifold homology was defined first, and an invariant for closed 4-manifolds was later defined in terms of it.\n\nThere are also extensions of the 3-manifold homologies to 3-manifolds with boundary: sutured Floer homology {{harv|Juhász|2008}} and bordered Floer homology {{harv|Lipshitz|Ozsváth|Thurston|2008}}.  These are related to the invariants for closed 3-manifolds by gluing formulas for the Floer homology of a 3-manifold described as the union along the boundary of two 3-manifolds with boundary.\n\nThe [[three-manifold]] Floer homologies also come equipped with a distinguished element of the homology if the [[three-manifold]] is equipped with a [[contact structure]]. Kronheimer and Mrowka first introduced the contact element in the Seiberg–Witten.  Ozsvath and Szabo used constructed it for Heegaard Floer homology using Giroux's relation between contact manifolds and open book decompositions, and it comes for free, as the homology class of the empty set, in embedded contact homology. (Which, unlike the other three, requires a contact homology for its definition. For embedded contact homology see {{harvtxt|Hutchings|2009}}.\n\nThese theories all come equipped with a priori relative gradings; these have been lifted to absolute gradings (by homotopy classes of oriented 2-plane fields) by Kronheimer and Mrowka (for SWF), Gripp and Huang (for HF), and Hutchings (for ECH).  Cristofaro-Gardiner has shown that Taubes' isomorphism between ECH and Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology preserves these absolute gradings.\n\n===Instanton Floer homology===\nThis is a three-manifold invariant connected to [[Donaldson theory]] introduced by Floer himself.  It is obtained using the [[Chern–Simons theory|Chern–Simons]] functional on the space of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] on a [[principal bundle|principal]] [[SU(2)]]-bundle over the three-manifold.  Its critical points are [[flat connection]]s and its flow lines are [[instanton]]s, i.e. anti-self-dual connections on the three-manifold crossed with the real line.  Instanton Floer homology may be viewed as a generalization of the [[Casson invariant]] because the [[Euler characteristic]] of Floer homology agrees with the Casson invariant.\n\nSoon after Floer's introduction of Floer homology, Donaldson realized that cobordisms induce maps.  This was the first instance of the structure that came to be known as a Topological Quantum Field Theory.\n\n===Seiberg–Witten Floer homology===\n'''Seiberg–Witten Floer homology''' or '''monopole Floer homology''' is a homology theory of smooth [[3-manifold]]s (equipped with a [[spin-c structure|spin<sup>''c''</sup> structure]]).  It may be viewed as the Morse homology of the Chern-Simons-Dirac functional on U(1) connections on the three-manifold.  The associated gradient flow equation corresponds to the Seiberg-Witten equations on the 3-manifold crossed with the real line.  Equivalently, the generators of the chain complex are translation-invariant solutions to Seiberg–Witten equations (known as monopoles) on the product of a 3-manifold and the real line, and the differential counts solutions to the Seiberg–Witten equations on the product of a three-manifold and the real line, which are asymptotic to invariant solutions at infinity and negative infinity.\n\nOne version of Seiberg-Witten-Floer homology was constructed rigorously in the monograph [[Monopoles and Three-manifolds]] by [[Peter Kronheimer]] and [[Tomasz Mrowka]], where it is known as monopole Floer homology.  Taubes has shown that it is isomorphic to embedded contact homology.   Alternate constructions of SWF for rational homology 3-spheres have been given by {{harvtxt|Manolescu|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Frøyshov|2010}}; they are known to agree.\n\n===Heegaard Floer homology===<!-- This section is linked from [[Knot invariant]] -->\n'''Heegaard Floer homology''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-heegaard.ogg|}} is an invariant due to [[Peter Ozsváth]] and [[Zoltán Szabó (mathematician)|Zoltán Szabó]] of a closed 3-manifold equipped with a spin<sup>''c''</sup> structure.  It is computed using a [[Heegaard splitting|Heegaard diagram]] of the space via a construction analogous to Lagrangian Floer homology. {{harvtxt|Kutluhan|Lee|Taubes|2010}} announced a proof that Heegaard Floer homology is isomorphic to Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, and {{harvtxt|Colin|Ghiggini|Honda|2011}} announced a proof that the plus-version of Heegaard Floer homology (with reverse orientation) is isomorphic to embedded contact homology.\n\nA knot in a three-manifold induces a filtration on the Heegaard Floer homology groups, and the filtered homotopy type is a powerful [[knot invariant]], called knot Floer homology. It [[categorification|categorifies]] the [[Alexander polynomial]]. Knot Floer homology was defined by {{Harvtxt|Ozsváth|Szabó|2003}} and independently by {{harvtxt|Rasmussen|2003}}.  It is known to detect knot genus. Using [[grid diagrams]] for the Heegaard splittings, knot Floer homology was given a combinatorial construction by {{harvtxt|Manolescu|Ozsváth|Sarkar|2009}}.\n\nThe Heegaard Floer homology of the [[Double cover (topology)|double cover]] of S^3 branched over a knot is related by a spectral sequence to [[Khovanov homology]] {{harv|Ozsváth|Szabó|2005}}.\n\nThe \"hat\" version of Heegaard Floer homology was described combinatorially by {{harvtxt|Sarkar|Wang|2010}}. The \"plus\" and \"minus\" versions of Heegaard Floer homology, and the related Ozsváth-Szabó four-manifold invariants, can be described combinatorially as well {{harv|Manolescu|Ozsváth|Thurston|2009}}.\n\n===Embedded contact homology===\n'''Embedded contact homology''', due to [[Michael Hutchings (mathematician)|Michael Hutchings]], is an invariant of 3-manifolds (with a distinguished second homology class, corresponding to the choice of a spin<sup>''c''</sup> structure in Seiberg–Witten Floer homology) isomorphic (by work of [[Clifford Taubes]]) to Seiberg–Witten Floer cohomology and consequently (by work announced by {{harvnb|Kutluhan|Lee|Taubes|2010}} and {{harvnb|Colin|Ghiggini|Honda|2011}}) to the plus-version of Heegaard Floer homology (with reverse orientation).  It may be seen as an extension of [[Taubes's Gromov invariant]], known to be equivalent to the [[Seiberg–Witten invariant]], from closed symplectic [[4-manifold]]s to certain non-compact symplectic 4-manifolds (namely, a contact three-manifold cross R).  Its construction is analogous to symplectic field theory, in that it is generated by certain collections of closed [[Reeb orbits]] and its differential counts certain holomorphic curves with ends at certain collections of Reeb orbits. It differs from SFT in technical conditions on the collections of Reeb orbits that generate it—and in not counting all holomorphic curves with [[Fredholm index]] 1 with given ends, but only those that also satisfy a topological condition given by the ''ECH index'', which in particular implies that the curves considered are (mainly) embedded.\n\nThe [[Weinstein conjecture]] that a contact 3-manifold has a closed Reeb orbit for any contact form holds on any manifold whose ECH is nontrivial, and was proved by Taubes using techniques closely related to ECH; extensions of this work yielded the isomorphism between ECH and SWF.  Many constructions in ECH (including its well-definedness) rely upon this isomorphism {{harv|Taubes|2007}}.\n\nThe contact element of ECH has a particularly nice form: it is the cycle associated to the empty collection of Reeb orbits.\n\nAn analog of embedded contact homology may be defined for mapping tori of symplectomorphisms of a surface (possibly with boundary) and is known as periodic Floer homology, generalizing the symplectic Floer homology of surface symplectomorphisms.  More generally, it may be defined with respect to any [[stable Hamiltonian structure]] on the 3-manifold; like contact structures, stable Hamiltonian structures define a nonvanishing vector field (the Reeb vector field), and Hutchings and Taubes have proven an analogue of the Weinstein conjecture for them, namely that they always have closed orbits (unless they are mapping tori of a 2-torus).\n\n==Lagrangian intersection Floer homology==\nThe Lagrangian Floer homology of two transversely intersecting [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s of a symplectic manifold is the homology of a chain complex generated by the intersection points of the two submanifolds and whose differential counts [[pseudoholomorphic]] [[Whitney discs]].\n\nGiven three Lagrangian submanifolds ''L''<sub>0</sub>, ''L''<sub>1</sub>, and ''L''<sub>2</sub> of a symplectic manifold, there is a product structure on the Lagrangian Floer homology:\n\n:<math>HF(L_0, L_1) \\otimes HF(L_1,L_2) \\rightarrow HF(L_0,L_2), </math>\n\nwhich is defined by counting holomorphic triangles (that is, holomorphic maps of a triangle whose vertices and edges map to the appropriate intersection points and Lagrangian submanifolds).\n\nPapers on this subject are due to Fukaya, Oh, Ono, and Ohta; the recent work on \"[[cluster homology]]\" of Lalonde and Cornea offer a different approach to it.  The Floer homology of a pair of Lagrangian submanifolds may not always exist; when it does, it provides an obstruction to isotoping one Lagrangian away from the other using a [[Hamiltonian isotopy]].\n\nSeveral kinds of Floer homology are special cases of Lagrangian Floer homology.  The symplectic Floer homology of a symplectomorphism of M can be thought of as a case of Lagrangian Floer homology in which the ambient manifold is M crossed with M and the Lagrangian submanifolds are the diagonal and the graph of the symplectomorphism.  The construction of Heegaard Floer homology is based on a variant of Lagrangian Floer homology for totally real submanifolds defined using a Heegaard splitting of a three-manifold.  Seidel-Smith and Manolescu constructed a link invariant as a certain case of Lagrangian Floer homology, which conjecturally agrees with [[Khovanov homology]], a combinatorially-defined link invariant.\n\n===Atiyah–Floer conjecture===\nThe Atiyah–Floer conjecture<ref>M.F. Atiyah, \"New invariants of three and four dimensional manifolds\" Proc. Symp. Pure Math., 48 (1988)</ref> connects the instanton Floer homology with the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology. Consider a 3-manifold Y with a [[Heegaard splitting]] along a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] <math>\\Sigma</math>. Then the space of [[flat connection]]s on <math>\\Sigma</math> modulo gauge equivalence is a symplectic manifold <math>M(\\Sigma)</math> of dimension 6''g''&nbsp;−&nbsp;6, where ''g'' is the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the surface <math>\\Sigma</math>. In the Heegaard splitting, <math>\\Sigma</math> bounds two different 3-manifolds; the space of flat connections modulo gauge equivalence on each 3-manifold with boundary embeds into <math>M(\\Sigma)</math> as a Lagrangian submanifold. One can consider the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology.  Alternately, we can consider the Instanton Floer homology of the 3-manifold Y. The Atiyah–Floer conjecture asserts that these two invariants are isomorphic. Salamon-Wehrheim and Daemi-Fukaya are working on their programs to prove this conjecture.\n\n===Relations to mirror symmetry===\nThe [[homological mirror symmetry]] conjecture of [[Maxim Kontsevich]] predicts an equality between the Lagrangian Floer homology of Lagrangians in a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] <math>X</math> and the [[Ext group]]s of [[coherent sheaves]] on the mirror Calabi–Yau manifold. In this situation, one should not focus on the Floer homology groups but on the Floer chain groups. Similar to the pair-of-pants product, one can construct multi-compositions using pseudo-holomorphic ''n''-gons. These compositions satisfy the <math>A_\\infty</math>-relations making the category of all (unobstructed) Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic manifold into an <math>A_\\infty</math>-category, called the [[Fukaya category]].\n\nTo be more precise, one must add additional data to the Lagrangian – a grading and a [[spin structure]]. A Lagrangian with a choice of these structures is often called a [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] in homage to the underlying physics. The Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture states there is a type of derived [[Morita equivalence]] between the Fukaya category of the Calabi–Yau <math>X</math> and a [[dg category]] underlying the bounded [[derived category]] of coherent sheaves of the mirror, and vice versa.\n\n==Symplectic field theory (SFT)==\nThis is an invariant of [[contact manifold]]s and symplectic [[cobordism]]s between them, originally due to [[Yakov Eliashberg]], [[Alexander Givental]] and [[Helmut Hofer]].  The symplectic field theory as well as its subcomplexes, rational symplectic field theory and contact homology, are defined as homologies of differential algebras, which are generated by closed orbits of the [[Reeb vector field]] of a chosen contact form. The differential counts certain holomorphic curves in the cylinder over the contact manifold, where the trivial examples are the branched coverings of (trivial) cylinders over closed Reeb orbits.  It further includes a linear homology theory, called cylindrical or linearized contact homology (sometimes, by abuse of notation, just contact homology), whose chain groups are vector spaces generated by closed orbits and whose differentials count only holomorphic cylinders. However, cylindrical contact homology is not always defined due to the presence of holomorphic discs and a lack of regularity and transversality results.  In situations where cylindrical contact homology makes sense, it may be seen as the (slightly modified) ''Morse homology'' of the action functional on the free loop space, which sends a loop to the integral of the contact form alpha over the loop.  Reeb orbits are the critical points of this functional.\n\nSFT also associates a relative invariant of a [[Legendrian submanifold]] of a contact manifold known as [[relative contact homology]].  Its generators are Reeb chords, which are trajectories of the Reeb vector field beginning and ending on a Lagrangian, and its differential counts certain holomorphic strips in the [[symplectization]] of the contact manifold whose ends are asymptotic to given Reeb chords.\n\nIn SFT the contact manifolds can be replaced by [[mapping torus|mapping tori]] of symplectic manifolds with symplectomorphisms. While the cylindrical contact homology is well-defined and given by the symplectic Floer homologies of powers of the symplectomorphism, (rational) symplectic field theory and contact homology can be considered as generalized symplectic Floer homologies. In the important case when the symplectomorphism is the time-one map of a time-dependent Hamiltonian, it was however shown that these higher invariants do not contain any further information.\n\n==Floer homotopy==\nOne conceivable way to construct a Floer homology theory of some object would be to construct a related [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectrum]] whose ordinary homology is the desired Floer homology.  Applying other [[homology theories]] to such a spectrum could yield other interesting invariants.  This strategy was proposed by Ralph Cohen, John Jones, and [[Graeme Segal]], and carried out in certain cases for Seiberg–Witten–Floer homology by {{harvtxt|Manolescu|2003}} and for the symplectic Floer homology of cotangent bundles by Cohen.  This approach was the basis of Manolescu's 2013 construction of Pin (2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, with which he disproved the Triangulation Conjecture for manifolds of dimension 5 and higher.\n\n==Analytic foundations==\nMany of these Floer homologies have not been completely and rigorously constructed, and many conjectural equivalences have not been proved. Technical difficulties come up in the analysis involved, especially in constructing [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]] [[moduli space]]s of pseudoholomorphic curves.  Hofer, in collaboration with Kris Wysocki and Eduard Zehnder, has developed new analytic foundations via their theory of [[polyfold]]s and a \"general Fredholm theory\". While the polyfold project is not yet fully completed, in some important cases transversality was shown using simpler methods.\n\n==Computation==\nFloer homologies are generally difficult to compute explicitly. For instance, the symplectic Floer homology for all surface symplectomorphisms was completed only in 2007. The Heegaard Floer homology has been a success story in this regard: researchers have exploited its algebraic structure to compute it for various classes of 3-manifolds and have found combinatorial algorithms for computation\nof much of the theory.  It is also connected to existing invariants and structures and many insights into 3-manifold topology have resulted.\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n<references />\n\n===Books and surveys===\n* {{cite book\n |author=[[Michael Atiyah]]\n |year=1988\n |title=New invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds\n |url=https://web.math.princeton.edu/~lewallen/AtiyahFloer.pdf\n |volume=48 |pages=285–299\n |ref=harv\n |doi=10.1090/pspum/048/974342\n |series=Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics\n |isbn=9780821814826\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |author1=[[Augustin Banyaga]]\n |author2=David Hurtubise\n |year=2004\n |title=Lectures on Morse Homology\n |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]\n |isbn=978-1-4020-2695-9\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |author1=[[Simon Donaldson]]\n |author2=M.

Thus,\n\n:<math>\\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_j} \\right) =\n       \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_i} \\right).</math>\n\nIn a formal statement: if the second partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} are all [[continuous function|continuous]] in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] {{math|''D''}} of a given point, then the Hessian of {{math|''f''}} is a [[symmetric matrix]] throughout {{math|''D''}}; see [[symmetry of second derivatives]].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Second derivative test ===\n{{Main|Second partial derivative test}}\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a [[convex function]] is [[positive semi-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]]. Refining this property allows us to test if a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] {{math|''x''}} is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point, as follows:\n\nIf the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] at {{math|''x''}}, then {{math|''f''}} attains an isolated local minimum at {{math|''x''}}. If the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite, semidefinite and indefinite matrices|negative definite]] at {{math|''x''}}, then {{math|''f''}} attains an isolated local maximum at {{math|''x''}}. If the Hessian has both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s then {{math|''x''}} is a [[saddle point]] for {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that at a local minimum the Hessian is positive-semi-definite, and at a local maximum the Hessian is negative semi-definite.\n\nNote that for positive semidefinite and negative semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of [[Morse theory]].\n\nThe [[second derivative test]] for functions of one and two variables is simple. In one variable, the Hessian contains just one second derivative; if it is positive then {{math|''x''}} is a local minimum, and if it is negative then {{math|''x''}} is a local maximum; if it is zero then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the [[determinant]] can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second derivative test is inconclusive.\n\nEquivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization—the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign with the 1×1 minor being negative.\n\n=== Critical points ===\n\nIf the [[gradient]] (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function {{math|''f''}} is zero at some point {{math|'''x'''}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]'' (or ''[[stationary point]]'') at {{math|'''x'''}}. The [[determinant]] of the Hessian at {{math|'''x'''}} is then called the [[discriminant]]. If this determinant is zero then {{math|'''x'''}} is called a ''degenerate critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}, or a ''non-Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a ''Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nThe Hessian matrix plays an important role in [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]], because its [[kernel of a matrix|kernel]] and [[eigenvalue]]s allow classification of the critical points.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geruGMKT9_UC&pg=PA248|title=Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View|last=Callahan|first=James J.|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-7332-0|page=248|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcn3CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|title=Recent Developments in General Relativity|editor-last=Casciaro|editor-first=B.|editor-last2=Fortunato|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Francaviglia|editor-first3=M.|editor-last4=Masiello|editor-first4=A.|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9788847021136|page=178|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Domenico P.

For such situations, [[truncated Newton method|truncated-Newton]] and [[quasi-Newton method|quasi-Newton]] algorithms have been developed.

      "title": "Morse homology",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_homology",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], specifically in the field of [[differential topology]], '''Morse homology''' is a [[homology theory]] defined for any smooth [[manifold]].  It is constructed using the [[smooth structure]] and an auxiliary [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the manifold, but turns out to be [[Topological invariant|topologically invariant]], and is in fact isomorphic to [[singular homology]].  Morse homology also serves as a model for the various infinite-dimensional generalizations known as [[Floer homology]] theories.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\nGiven any (compact) smooth manifold, let ''f'' be a [[Morse function]] and ''g'' a [[Riemannian metric]] on the manifold. (These are auxiliary; in the end, the Morse homology depends on neither.) The pair <math>(f, g)</math> gives us a [[gradient]] vector field. We say that <math>(f, g)</math> is '''Morse–Smale''' if the [[stable manifold|stable]] and [[unstable manifold]]s associated to all of the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of ''f'' intersect each other [[Transversality (mathematics)|transversely]].\n\nFor any such pair <math>(f, g)</math>, it can be shown that the difference in [[Critical point (mathematics)#Several variables|index]] between any two critical points is equal to the dimension of the [[moduli space]] of gradient flows between those points. Thus there is a one-dimensional moduli space of flows between a critical point of index ''i'' and one of index <math>i-1</math>. Each flow can be reparametrized by a one-dimensional translation in the domain. After modding out by these reparametrizations, the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] is zero-dimensional &mdash; that is, a collection of [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] points representing unparametrized flow lines.\n\nA [[chain complex]] <math>C_*(M, (f, g))</math> may then be defined as follows. The set of chains is the '''[[integer|Z]]'''-[[module (mathematics)|module]] generated by the critical points. The differential ''d'' of the complex sends a critical point ''p'' of index ''i'' to a sum of index-<math>(i-1)</math> critical points, with coefficients corresponding to the (signed) number of unparametrized flow lines from ''p'' to those index-<math>(i-1)</math> critical points. The fact that the number of such flow lines is finite follows from the compactness of the moduli space.\n\nThe fact that this defines a [[chain complex]] (that is, that <math>d^2 = 0</math>) follows from an understanding of how the moduli spaces of gradient flows [[compactification (mathematics)|compactify]].  Namely, in <math>d^2(p)</math> the coefficient of an index-<math>(i-2)</math> critical point ''q'' is the (signed) number of ''broken flows'' consisting of an index-1 flow from ''p'' to some critical point ''r'' of index <math>i-1</math> and another index-1 flow from ''r'' to ''q''.  These broken flows exactly constitute the boundary of the moduli space of index-2 flows: The limit of any sequence of unbroken index-2 flows can be shown to be of this form, and all such broken flows arise as limits of unbroken index-2 flows.  Unparametrized index-2 flows come in one-dimensional families, which compactify to compact one-manifolds.  The fact that the boundary of a compact one-manifold is always zero proves that <math>d^2(p)=0</math>.\n\n== Invariance of Morse homology ==\n\nIt can be shown that the homology of this complex is independent of the Morse–Smale pair (''f'', ''g'') used to define it.  A homotopy of pairs (''f<sub>t</sub>'', ''g<sub>t</sub>'') that interpolates between any two given pairs (''f''<sub>0</sub>, ''g''<sub>0</sub>) and (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>1</sub>) may always be defined. Either through [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] analysis or by using a [[continuation map]] to define a [[Chain complex#Chain maps|chain map]] from <math>C_*(M, (f_0, g_0))</math> to <math>C_*(M, (f_1, g_1))</math>, it can be shown that the two Morse homologies are isomorphic.  Analogous arguments using a homotopy of homotopies shows that this isomorphism is canonical.\n\nAnother approach to proving the invariance of Morse homology is to relate it directly to singular homology.  One can define a map to singular homology by sending a critical point to the singular chain associated to the unstable manifold associated to that point; inversely, a singular chain is sent to the limiting critical points reached by flowing the chain using the gradient vector field.  The cleanest way to do this rigorously is to use the theory of [[Current (mathematics)|currents]].\n\nThe isomorphism with singular homology can also be proved by demonstrating an isomorphism with [[cellular homology]], by viewing an unstable manifold associated to a critical point of index ''i'' as an ''i''-cell, and showing that the boundary maps in the Morse and cellular complexes correspond.\n\n== Related constructions ==\n\nThis approach to Morse theory was known in some form to [[René Thom]] and [[Stephen Smale]]. It is also implicit in [[John Milnor]]'s book on the [[h-cobordism]] theorem.\n\nFrom the fact that the Morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology, the Morse inequalities follow by considering the number of generators &mdash; that is, critical points &mdash; necessary to generate the homology groups of the appropriate ranks (and by considering truncations of the Morse complex, to get the stronger inequalities). The existence of Morse homology \"explains\", in the sense of [[categorification]], the Morse inequalities.\n\n[[Edward Witten]] came up with a related construction in the early 1980s sometimes known as [[Morse–Witten theory]].\n\nMorse homology can be extended to finite-dimensional non-compact or infinite-dimensional manifolds where the index remains finite, the metric is complete and the function satisfies the [[Palais–Smale compactness condition]], such as the energy functional for geodesics on a Riemannian manifold. The generalization to situations in which both index and coindex are infinite, but the relative index of any pair of critical points is finite, is known as [[Floer homology]].\n\n[[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]] generalized this construction to a homology theory associated to a [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed one-form]] on a manifold.  Morse homology is a special case for the one-form ''df''.  A special case of Novikov's theory is [[circle-valued Morse theory]], which [[Michael Hutchings (mathematician)|Michael Hutchings]] and Yi-Jen Lee have connected to [[Reidemeister torsion]] and [[Seiberg–Witten theory]].\n\n== Morse–Bott homology ==\n\nMorse homology can be carried out in the Morse–Bott setting, i.e. when instead of isolated nondegenerate critical points, a function has critical manifolds whose tangent space at a point coincides with the kernel of the Hessian at the point. This situation will always occur, if the function considered is invariant w.r.t a non-discrete Lie group.\n\nTo describe the resulting chain complex and its homology, introduce a generic Morse function on each critical submanifold.  Chains will consist of paths that begin in a critical manifold at a critical point of the auxiliary Morse function, following a gradient trajectory with respect to some metric, and then leave the submanifold to follow the gradient vector field of the Morse–Bott function until it hits some other critical manifold; it either flows for a while along a gradient trajectory associated to the Morse function on that critical submanifold and then flows to another critical submanifold, etc., or flows to a critical point in the original submanifold and terminates.  See (Frauenfelder).  This approach to Morse–Bott homology appeared in the context of unpublished work for [[contact homology]] by Bourgeois, in which the critical submanifolds are the sets of [[Reeb orbits]], and the gradient flows between the critical submanifolds are pseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectization of a contact manifold asymptotic to Reeb orbits in the relevant critical manifolds of Reeb orbits.\nIf we extend each Morse function to a function on the entire manifold supported near the critical submanifolds, we can explicitly write down a Morse–Smale function that perturbs the original Morse–Bott function.  Namely, multiply each of the extended functions by some small positive constant, sum them and add the result to the original Morse–Bott function.  The broken flows described above will be C<sup>0</sup> close to the flow lines of this Morse–Smale function.\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite book|last1=Banyaga|first1= Augustin |authorlink1=Augustin Banyaga| last2=Hurtubise|first2= David|year=2004|title=Lectures on Morse Homology| location=Dordrecht|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=1-4020-2695-1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Bott|first= Raoul|authorlink=Raoul Bott| url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1988__68__99_0 |title=Morse Theory Indomitable|journal= [[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]] |volume= 68 |year=1988|pages=99–114}}\n* Farber, Michael.

Let ''S'' be the subset of <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\Gamma]</math> consisting of those with leading term 1.

It computes the homology of ''M'': <math>H^*(C_*(f)) \\approx H^*(M, \\mathbf{Z})</math> (cf. [[Morse homology]].)\n\nIn an analogy with this, one can define \"Novikov numbers\". Let ''X'' be a connected polyhedron with a base point. Each cohomology class <math>\\xi \\in H^1(X, \\mathbb{R})</math> may be viewed as a linear functional on the first homology group <math>H_1(X, \\mathbb{R})</math> and, composed with the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]], it can be viewed as a group homomorphism <math>\\xi: \\pi=\\pi_1(X) \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>.

Since ''X'' is a connected polyhedron, a [[local coefficient system]] over it corresponds one-to-one to a <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\pi]</math>-module. Let <math>L_\\xi</math> be a local coefficient system corresponding to <math>\\operatorname{Nov}</math> with module structure given by <math>\\phi_\\xi</math>.

      "title": "Perverse sheaf",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_sheaf",
      "text": "The mathematical term '''perverse sheaves''' refers to a certain [[abelian category]] associated to a [[topological space]] ''X'', which may be a real or complex [[manifold]], or a more general [[topologically stratified space]], usually singular. This concept was introduced in the thesis of [[Zoghman Mebkhout]], gaining more popularity after the (independent) work of [[Joseph Bernstein]], [[Alexander Beilinson]], and [[Pierre Deligne]] (1982) as a formalisation of the [[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence]], which related the topology of singular spaces ([[intersection homology]] of [[Mark Goresky]] and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|Robert MacPherson]]) and the algebraic theory of differential equations ([[microlocal calculus]] and holonomic [[D-module]]s of [[Joseph Bernstein]], [[Masaki Kashiwara]] and [[Takahira Kawai]]). It was clear from the outset that perverse sheaves are fundamental mathematical objects at the crossroads of [[algebraic geometry]], [[topology]], analysis and [[differential equations]]. They also play an important role in [[number theory]], algebra, and [[representation theory]]. Note that the properties characterizing perverse sheaves already appeared in the 75's paper of Kashiwara on the constructibility of solutions of holonomic  [[D-module]]s.\n\n== Preliminary remarks ==\n\nThe name ''perverse sheaf'' comes through rough translation of the French \"faisceaux pervers\"<ref>''Les faisceaux pervers n'etant ni des faisceaux, ni pervers, la terminologie requiert une explication.'' BBD, p. 10</ref>. The justification is that perverse sheaves are complexes of sheaves which have several features in common with sheaves: they form an abelian category, they have [[cohomology]], and to construct one, it suffices to construct it locally everywhere. The adjective \"pervers\" originates in the [[Intersection homology#Perversities|intersection homology]] theory,<ref>[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/29970/what-is-the-etymology-of-the-term-perverse-sheaf/ What is the etymology of the term \"perverse sheaf\"?] – [[MathOverflow]]</ref> and its origin was explained by {{harvtxt|Goresky|2010}}.\n\nThe Beilinson–Bernstein–Deligne definition of a perverse sheaf proceeds through the machinery of [[triangulated categories]] in [[homological algebra]] and has very strong algebraic flavour, although the main examples arising from Goresky–MacPherson theory are topological in nature because the simple objects in the category of perverse sheaves are the intersection cohomology complexes. This motivated MacPherson to recast the whole theory in geometric terms on a basis of [[Morse theory]]. For many applications in representation theory, perverse sheaves can be treated as a 'black box', a category with certain formal properties.\n\n==Definition and examples==\nA '''perverse sheaf''' is an object ''C'' of the bounded [[derived category]] of sheaves with [[Constructible sheaf|constructible]] cohomology on a space ''X'' such that the set of points ''x'' with\n:<math>H^{-i}(j_x^*C)\\ne 0 </math> or <math>H^{i}(j_x^!C)\\ne 0</math>\nhas dimension at most 2''i'', for all ''i''. Here ''j''<sub>''x''</sub> is the inclusion map of the point ''x''.\n\nIf ''X'' is smooth and everywhere of dimension ''d'', then\n:<math>\\mathcal F[d]</math>\nis a perverse sheaf for any [[local system]] <math>\\mathcal F</math>.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beilinson|Bernstein|Deligne|1982|loc=Proposition 2.2.2, §4.0}}</ref> If ''X'' is a flat, locally complete intersection (for example, regular) scheme over a [[Henselian ring|henselian]] [[discrete valuation ring]], then the constant sheaf shifted by <math>\\dim X+1</math> is an étale perverse sheaf.<ref>{{harvtxt|Illusie|2003|loc=Corollaire 2.7}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nThe category of perverse sheaves is an abelian subcategory of the (non-abelian) derived category of sheaves, equal to the core of a suitable [[t-structure]],  and is preserved by [[Verdier duality]].\n\nThe bounded derived category of perverse l-adic sheaves on a scheme ''X'' is equivalent to the derived category of constructible sheaves and similarly for sheaves on the complex analytic space associated to a scheme ''X''/'''C'''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beilinson|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nPerverse sheaves are a fundamental tool for the geometry of singular spaces. Therefore, they are applied in a variety of mathematical areas. In the [[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence]], perverse sheaves correspond to regular holonomic [[D-module]]s. This application establishes the notion of perverse sheaf as occurring 'in nature'. The [[decomposition theorem]], a far-reaching extension of the [[hard Lefschetz theorem]] decomposition, requires the usage of perverse sheaves. [[Hodge module]]s are, roughly speaking, a [[Hodge theory|Hodge-theoretic]] refinement of perverse sheaves. The [[geometric Satake equivalence]] identifies equivariant perverse sheaves on the [[affine Grassmannian]] <math>Gr_G</math> with representations of the [[Langlands dual]] group of a [[reductive group]] ''G'' - see {{harvtxt|Mirković|Vilonen|2007}}. A proof of the [[Weil conjectures]] using perverse sheaves is given in {{harvtxt|Kiehl|Weissauer|2001}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Intersection homology]]\n* [[L² cohomology]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite journal\n| url = http://www.ams.org/notices/201005/rtx100500632p.pdf\n| last1 = Andrea de Cataldo\n| first1 = Mark\n| first2 = Luca |last2=Migliorini\n| title=What is a perverse sheaf?\n| journal = Notices of the AMS\n| date=May 2010\n| volume = 57\n| issue = 5\n| ref = harv\n}}\n\n* {{citation|mr=2668828|author1=Arinkin|first1=Dmitry|author2=Bezrukavnikov|first2=Roman|title=Perverse coherent sheaves|journal=Mosc.

      "text": "An '''algebraic Riccati equation''' is a type of nonlinear equation that arises in the context of infinite-horizon [[optimal control]] problems in [[continuous time]] or [[discrete time]].\n\nA typical algebraic Riccati equation is similar to one of the following:\n\nthe continuous time algebraic Riccati equation (CARE):\n\n: <math>A^T X + X A - X B R^{-1} B^T X + Q = 0 \\, </math>\n\nor the discrete time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE):\n\n: <math>X = A^T X A -(A^T X B)(R + B^T X B)^{-1}(B^T X A) + Q.\\,</math>\n\n''X'' is the unknown ''n'' by ''n'' symmetric matrix and ''A'', ''B'', ''Q'', ''R'' are known [[real number|real]] coefficient matrices.\n\nThough generally this equation can have many solutions, it is usually specified that we want to obtain the unique stabilizing solution, if such a solution exists.\n\n==Origin of the name==\n\nThe name Riccati is given to these equations because of their relation to the [[Riccati differential equation]].  Indeed, the CARE is verified by the time invariant solutions of the associated matrix valued Riccati differential equation.  As for the DARE, it is verified by the time invariant solutions of the matrix valued Riccati difference equation (which is the analogue of the Riccati differential equation in the context of discrete time LQR).\n\n==Context of the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation==\n\nIn  infinite-horizon [[optimal control]] problems, one cares about the value of some variable of interest arbitrarily far into the future, and one must optimally choose a value of a controlled variable right now, knowing that one will also behave optimally at all times in the future.  The optimal current values of the problem's control variables at any time can be found using the solution of the Riccati equation and the current observations on evolving state variables. With multiple state variables and multiple control variables, the Riccati equation will be a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation.\n\nThe algebraic Riccati equation determines the solution of the infinite-horizon time-invariant [[Linear-quadratic regulator|Linear-Quadratic Regulator problem]] (LQR) as well as that of the infinite horizon time-invariant [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian control problem]] (LQG). These are two of the most fundamental problems in [[control theory]].\n\nA typical specification of the discrete-time linear quadratic control problem is to minimize\n\n:<math>\\sum_{t=1}^T (y_t^T Qy_t + u_t^T Ru_t)</math>\n\nsubject to the state equation\n\n:<math>y_t = Ay_{t-1} + Bu_t,</math>\n\nwhere ''y'' is an ''n'' × 1 vector of state variables, ''u'' is a ''k'' × 1 vector of control variables, ''A'' is the ''n'' × ''n'' state transition matrix, ''B'' is the ''n'' × ''k'' matrix of control multipliers, and ''Q'' (''n'' × ''n'') and ''R'' (''k'' × ''k'') are symmetric [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite]] [[Loss function|cost]] matrices.\n\n[[Bellman equation|Induction backwards in time]] can be used to obtain the optimal control solution at each time,<ref>{{cite book |last=Chow |first=Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Chow |title=Analysis and Control of Dynamic Economic Systems |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1975 |isbn=0-471-15616-7 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>u_t^*=-(B^TX_tB+R)^{-1}(B^TX_tA)y_{t-1},</math>\n\nwith the symmetric positive definite cost-to-go matrix ''X'' evolving backwards in time from <math>X_T = Q</math> according to\n\n: <math> X_{t-1} = Q+A^TX_tA - A^TX_tB(B^TX_tB+R)^{-1}B^TX_tA, \\,</math>\n\nwhich is known as the discrete-time dynamic Riccati equation of this problem. The steady-state characterization of ''X'', relevant for the infinite-horizon problem in which ''T'' goes to infinity, can be found by iterating the dynamic equation repeatedly until it converges; then ''X'' is characterized by removing the time subscripts from the dynamic equation.\n\n==Solution==\n\nUsually solvers try to find the unique stabilizing solution, if such a solution exists.  A solution is stabilizing if using it for controlling the associated LQR system makes the closed loop system stable.\n\nFor the CARE, the control is\n:<math>K = R^{-1} B^T X</math>\nand the closed loop state transfer matrix is\n: <math>A - BK = A - B R^{-1} B^T X</math>\nwhich is stable if and only if all of its eigenvalues have strictly negative real part.\n\nFor the DARE, the control is\n: <math>K = (R + B^T X B)^{-1} B^T X A</math>\nand the closed loop state transfer matrix is\n: <math>A - BK = A - B (R + B^T X B)^{-1} B^T X A</math>\nwhich is stable if and only if all of its eigenvalues are strictly inside the unit circle of the complex plane.\n\nA solution to the algebraic Riccati equation can be obtained by matrix factorizations or by iterating on the Riccati equation.  One type of iteration can be obtained in the discrete time case by using the ''dynamic'' Riccati equation that arises in the finite-horizon problem: in the latter type of problem each iteration of the value of the matrix is relevant for optimal choice at each period that is a finite distance in time from a final time period, and if it is iterated infinitely far back in time it converges to the specific matrix that is relevant for optimal choice an infinite length of time prior to a final period&mdash;that is, for when there is an infinite horizon.\n\nIt is also possible to find the solution by finding the eigendecomposition of a larger system.  For the CARE, we define the [[Hamiltonian matrix]]\n: <math> Z = \\begin{pmatrix} A & -B R^{-1} B^T \\\\ -Q & -A^T \\end{pmatrix} </math>\nSince <math>\\scriptstyle Z </math> is Hamiltonian, if it does not have any eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, then exactly half of its eigenvalues have a negative real part.

      "text": "[[File:Kochendwassergerät.JPG|thumb|A [[water heater]] that maintains desired temperature by turning the applied power on and off (as opposed to continuously varying electrical [[voltage]] or [[electrical current|current]]) based on temperature [[feedback control|feedback]] is an example application of bang–bang control. Although the applied power switches from one discrete state to another, the water temperature will remain relatively constant due to the slow nature of temperature changes in materials. Hence, the regulated temperature is like a [[sliding mode control|sliding mode]] of the [[variable structure system]] setup by the bang–bang controller.]]\n[[File:Zweipunkt.svg|thumb|Symbol for a bang-bang control]]\nIn [[control theory]], a '''bang–bang controller''' (2 step or '''on–off controller'''), also known as a '''hysteresis controller''', is a [[feedback control]]ler that switches abruptly between two states. These controllers may be realized in terms of any element that provides [[hysteresis]]. They are often used to control a plant that accepts a binary input, for example a furnace that is either completely on or completely off. Most common residential [[thermostats]] are bang–bang controllers. The [[Heaviside step function]] in its discrete form is an example of a '''bang–bang control''' signal. Due to the [[discontinuous]] control signal, systems that include bang–bang controllers are [[variable structure systems]], and bang–bang controllers are thus variable structure controllers.\n\n==Bang–bang solutions in optimal control==\n\nIn [[optimal control]] problems, it is sometimes the case that a control is restricted to be between a lower and an upper bound. If the optimal control switches from one extreme to the other (i.e., is strictly never in between the bounds), then that control is referred to as a bang-bang solution.\n\nBang–bang controls frequently arise in minimum-time problems. For example, if it is desired to stop a car in the shortest possible time at a certain position sufficiently far ahead of the car, the solution is to apply maximum acceleration until the unique ''switching point'', and then apply maximum braking to come to rest exactly at the desired position.\n\nA familiar everyday example is bringing water to a [[boiling|boil]] in the shortest time, which is achieved by applying full heat, then turning it off when the water reaches a boil.  A closed-loop household example is most thermostats, wherein the heating element or air conditioning compressor is either running or not, depending upon whether the measured temperature is above or below the setpoint.\n\nBang–bang solutions also arise when the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] is linear in the control variable; application of [[Pontryagin's maximum principle|Pontryagin's minimum or maximum principle]] will then lead to pushing the control to its upper or lower bound depending on the sign of the coefficient of ''u'' in the Hamiltonian.\n\nIn summary, bang–bang controls are actually ''optimal'' controls in some cases, although they are also often implemented because of simplicity or convenience.\n\n== Practical implications of bang-bang control ==\n\nMathematically or within a computing context there may\nbe no problems, but the physical realization of bang-bang\ncontrol systems gives rise to several complications. \n\nFirst, depending on the width of the hysteresis gap and inertia in the process, there will be an oscillating error signal around the desired set point value (e.g., temperature), often saw-tooth shaped. Room temperature may become uncomfortable just before the next switch 'ON' event. Alternatively, a narrow hysteresis gap will lead to frequent\non/off switching, which is undesirable for, e.g., an electrically ignited gas heater.\n\nSecond, the onset of the step function may entail, for example, a high electrical current and/or sudden heating and expansion of metal vessels, ultimately leading to [[metal fatigue]] or other wear-and-tear effects. Where possible, continuous control, such as in [[PID control]] will avoid problems caused by the brisk physical system state transitions that are the consequence of bang-bang control.\n\n==See also==\n* [[ Euler equation]]\n* [[Double-setpoint control]]\n* [[Lyapunov's theorem]]\n* [[Optimal control]]\n* [[Robust control]]\n* [[Sliding mode control]]\n* [[Vector measure]]\n* [[Pulse and glide]]\n* [[GBU-12 Paveway II]] – a laser-guided bomb which uses a simplified bang-bang steering mechanism\n\n==References==\n* {{cite article|last=Artstein|first=Zvi|title=Discrete&nbsp;and&nbsp;continuous bang-bang and facial&nbsp;spaces, or: Look for the extreme points|journal=SIAM Review|volume=22|year=1980|number=2|pages=172–185|doi=10.1137/1022026|jstor=2029960 |mr=564562}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|authorlink1=Irmgard Flugge-Lotz|title=Discontinuous Automatic Control|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953|isbn=9780691653259}}\n* {{cite book|title=Functional analysis and time optimal control|last1=Hermes|first1=Henry |last2=LaSalle|first2=Joseph&nbsp;P.|series=Mathematics in Science and Engineering|volume=56|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York—London|year=1969|pages=viii+136|mr=420366}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Kluvánek|first1=Igor|authorlink1=Igor Kluvánek|last2=Knowles|first2=Greg|title=Vector measures and control systems|series=North-Holland Mathematics Studies|volume=20|issue=Notas de Matemática, No. 58.

      "text": "The '''Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM)''', one of [[list of topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|many topics named after]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], is a direct transcription method for discretizing a continuous [[optimal control]] problem into a [[nonlinear programming|nonlinear program]]  (NLP). The Gauss pseudospectral method differs from several other [[pseudospectral optimal control |pseudospectral methods]]  in that the dynamics are not collocated at either endpoint of the time interval.  This collocation, in conjunction with the proper approximation to the [[costate]], leads to a set of [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|KKT]] conditions that are identical to the discretized form of the first-order optimality conditions. This equivalence between the KKT conditions and the discretized first-order optimality conditions leads to an accurate costate estimate using the KKT multipliers of the NLP.\n\n==Description==\nThe method is based on the theory of orthogonal [[Collocation method|collocation]] where the collocation points (i.e., the points at which the optimal control problem is discretized) are the [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]]&ndash;Gauss (LG) points.  The approach used in the GPM is to use a [[Lagrange polynomial]] approximation for the state that includes coefficients for the initial state plus the values of the state at the N LG points.  In a somewhat opposite manner, the approximation for the [[costate]] (adjoint) is performed using a basis of Lagrange polynomials that includes the final value of the costate plus the costate at the N LG points.  These two approximations together lead to the ability to map the KKT multipliers of the nonlinear program (NLP) to the costates of the optimal control problem at the N LG points PLUS the boundary points.  The costate mapping theorem that arises from the GPM has been described in several references including two PhD theses<ref>Benson, D.A., ''A Gauss Pseudospectral Transcription for Optimal Control'', Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, November 2004,</ref><ref>Huntington, G.T., ''Advancement and Analysis of a Gauss Pseudospectral Transcription for Optimal Control'', Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, May 2007</ref> and journal articles that include the theory along with applications<ref>Benson, D.A., Huntington, G.T., Thorvaldsen, T.P., and Rao, A.V., \"Direct Trajectory Optimization and Costate Estimation via an Orthogonal Collocation Method\", ''Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics''.

      "text": "The theory of [[optimal control]] is concerned with operating a [[dynamic system]] at minimum cost.  The case where the system dynamics are described by a set of [[linear differential equation]]s and the cost is described by a [[quadratic polynomial|quadratic]] [[functional (mathematics)|function]] is called the LQ problem.  One of the main results in the theory is that the solution is provided by the '''linear–quadratic regulator (LQR)''', a feedback controller whose equations are given below. The LQR is an important part of the solution to the [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|LQG (linear–quadratic–Gaussian) problem]]. Like the LQR problem itself, the LQG problem is one of the most fundamental problems in [[control theory]].\n\n==General description==\nThe settings of a (regulating) controller governing either a machine or process (like an airplane or chemical reactor) are found by using a mathematical algorithm that minimizes a [[Loss function|cost function]] with weighting factors supplied by a human (engineer). The cost function is often defined as a sum of the deviations of key measurements, like altitude or process temperature, from their desired values. The algorithm thus finds those controller settings that minimize undesired deviations. The magnitude of the control action itself may also be included in the cost function.\n\nThe LQR algorithm reduces the amount of work done by the control systems engineer to optimize the controller. However, the engineer still needs to specify the cost function parameters, and compare the results with the specified design goals. Often this means that controller construction will be an iterative process in which the engineer judges the \"optimal\" controllers produced through simulation and then adjusts the parameters to produce a controller more consistent with design goals.\n\nThe LQR algorithm is essentially an automated way of finding an appropriate [[state space (controls)|state-feedback controller]]. As such, it is not uncommon for control engineers to prefer alternative methods, like [[full state feedback]], also known as pole placement, in which there is a  clearer relationship between controller parameters and controller behavior. Difficulty in finding the right weighting factors limits the application of the LQR based controller synthesis.\n\n<!-- The final paragraph of this article assumes that the final controlled signal is the most important result of control. This may seems like an obvious statement, but, there are examples where the cost of the control input is of similar magnitude to the cost of having the system deviate. In such applications it may be preferable to allow the system to deviate. An example that I am familiar with (although not the most intuitive example) is load control of airfoils. Near stall conditions sucking, blowing and periodic excitation are all methods of delaying stall. None of the above mentioned methods will control stall indefinitely. While all methods can require significant energy inputs that may exceed the capabilities of the power source. Given that none of these methods can always control the system, situations will arise where control is not possible. In this situation a state-feedback controller will try harder and harder to correct the system, possibly burning out the power source, or causing serious damage to other components. An example of irreversible damage is in Mig 21 fighter planes. They used the blowing of hot exhaust to control stall in tight turns, it was common that in dog fights the blowing mechanism would actually burn up the wings destroying the plane. with an LQR the controller would recognize that control is hopeless and allow the system to deviate. In the Mig 21 example the plane would simply not be able to turn as tight. This may be undesirable in a dog fight, but nor is burning up and falling from the sky. Now maybe I do not understand what a state-feedback controller is, but this is my impression of the last paragraph-->\n\n==Finite-horizon, continuous-time LQR==\n\nFor a continuous-time linear system, defined on <math>t\\in[t_0,t_1]</math>, described by:\n\n:<math>\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu</math>\n\nwith a quadratic cost function defined as:\n\n:<math>J =  x^T(t_1)F(t_1)x(t_1)  + \\int\\limits_{t_0}^{t_1} \\left( x^T Q x + u^T R u + 2 x^T N u \\right) dt</math><!-- Q,R,N and other variables are not defined, making the formula useless. -->\n\nthe feedback control law that minimizes the value of the cost is:\n\n:<math>u = -K x \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>K</math> is given by:\n\n:<math>K = R^{-1} (B^T P(t) + N^T) \\,</math>\n\nand <math>P</math> is found by solving the continuous time [[Riccati differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>A^T P(t) + P(t) A - (P(t) B + N) R^{-1} (B^T P(t) + N^T) + Q = - \\dot{P}(t) \\,</math>\n\nwith the boundary condition:\n\n:<math>P(t_1) = F(t_1).</math>\n\nThe first order conditions for J<sub>min</sub> are:\n\n'''(i) State equation''' \n:<math>\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu</math>\n\n'''(ii) [[Costate equations|Co-state equation]]''' \n:<math>-\\dot{\\lambda} = Qx + Nu + A^T \\lambda </math>\n\n'''(iii) Stationary equation'''\n:<math> 0 = Ru + N^Tx + B^T \\lambda</math>\n\n'''(iv) Boundary conditions'''\n:<math> x(t_0) = x_0</math>\nand\n<math> \\lambda(t_1) = F(t_1) x(t_1)</math>\n\n==Infinite-horizon, continuous-time LQR==\n\nFor a continuous-time linear system described by:\n\n:<math>\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu</math>\n\nwith a cost functional defined as:\n\n:<math>J = \\int_{0}^\\infty \\left( x^T Q x + u^T R u + 2 x^T N u \\right) dt</math>\n\nthe feedback control law that minimizes the value of the cost is:\n\n:<math>u = -K x \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>K</math> is given by:\n\n:<math>K = R^{-1} (B^T P + N^T) \\,</math>\n\nand <math>P</math> is found by solving the continuous time [[algebraic Riccati equation]]:\n\n:<math>A^T P + P A - (P B + N) R^{-1} (B^T P + N^T) + Q = 0 \\,</math>\n\nThis can be also written as:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal A^T P + P \\mathcal A - P B R^{-1} B^T P + \\mathcal Q = 0 \\,</math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>\\mathcal A = A - B R^{-1} N^T \\qquad  \\mathcal Q = Q - N R^{-1} N^T \\,</math>\n\n==Finite-horizon, discrete-time LQR==\n\nFor a discrete-time linear system described by:\n<ref>{{cite book |last= Chow |first= Gregory C. |title= Analysis and Control of Dynamic Economic Systems |publisher= Krieger Publ.

There are many manufacturing processes in which an interruption of the power supply may cause high revenue losses and long start-up time.<ref name=\"Securicon\"/><ref name=\"TypeOfMicrogrid\"/>\nIndustrial microgrids can be designed to supply [[circular economy]] (near-)zero-emission industrial processes, and can integrate combined heat and power (CHP) generation, being fed by both renewable sources and waste processing; energy storage can be additionally used to optimize the operations of these sub-systems.<ref name=\"Venice\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|last2=Bovo|first2=A.|last3=Giovannelli|first3=A.|last4=Mattavelli|first4=P.|year=2018|title= The VERITAS multi-technology microgrid experiment: a design review |journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=12|issue=3|pages=19–31|doi=10.1109/MIE.2018.2855735|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n== Basic components in microgrids ==\n\n[[File:SoSie+SoSchiff Ansicht.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Solar Settlement]], a sustainable housing community project in [[Freiburg]], Germany.]]\n\n===Local generation===\nA microgrid presents various types of generation sources that feed electricity, heating, and cooling to user. These sources are divided into two major groups – thermal energy sources (e.g,. natural gas or [[biogas]] generators or [[micro combined heat and power]]) and renewable generation sources (e.g. wind turbines, solar).\n\n===Consumption===\nIn a microgrid, consumption simply refers to elements that consume electricity, heat, and cooling which range from single devices to lighting, heating system of buildings, commercial centers, etc. In the case of ''controllable loads'', the electricity consumption can be modified in demand of the network.\n\n===Energy Storage===\nIn microgrid, [[energy storage]] is able to perform multiple functions, such as ensuring power quality, including frequency and voltage regulation, smoothing the output of renewable energy sources, providing backup power for the system and playing crucial role in cost optimization. It includes all of electrical, pressure, gravitational, flywheel, and heat storage technologies. When multiple energy storages with various capacities are available in a microgrid, it is preferred to coordinate their charging and discharging such that a smaller energy storage does not discharge faster than those with larger capacities. Likewise, it is preferred a smaller one does not get fully charged before those with larger capacities. This can be achieved under a coordinated control of energy storages based on their state of charge.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hosseinimehr|first=Tahoura|last2=Ghosh|first2=Arindam|last3=Shahnia|first3=Farhad|date=May 2017|title=Cooperative control of battery energy storage systems in microgrids|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S014206151630076X|journal=International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems|volume=87|pages=109–120|doi=10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.12.003|issn=0142-0615}}</ref>\nIf multiple energy storage systems (possibly working on different technologies) are used and they are controlled by a unique supervising unit (an Energy Management System - EMS), a hierarchical control based on a master/slaves architecture can ensure best operations, particularly in the islanded mode.<ref name=\"Venice\" />\n\n===Point of common coupling (PCC)===\nIt is the point in the electric circuit where a microgrid is connected to a main grid.<ref name=\"PointOfCommonCoupling\">{{cite web|url=http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~kwasinski/EE394J10_DG_Grid%20interconnection.ppt|last1=Alexis Kwasinki|accessdate=20 June 2016|title=Grid-Microgrids Interconnection}}</ref> Microgrids that do not have a PCC are called isolated microgrids which are usually presented in the case of remote sites (e.g., remote communities\nor remote industrial sites) where an interconnection with the main grid is not feasible due to either technical or economic constraints.\n\n== Advantages and challenges of microgrids ==\n\n===Advantages===\nA microgrid is capable of operating in grid-connected and stand-alone modes and of handling the transition between the two.

Some of these challenges arise from invalid assumptions typically applied to conventional distribution systems, while others are the result of stability issues formerly observed only at a transmission system level.<ref name=\"TrendInMicrogrid\"/>\nThe most relevant challenges in microgrid protection and control include:\n\n* Bidirectional power flows: The presence of [[distributed generation]] (DG) units in the network at low voltage levels can cause reverse power flows that may lead to complications in protection coordination, undesirable power flow patterns, [[Fault (power engineering)|fault current]] distribution, and [[voltage]] control.<ref name=\"TrendInMicrogrid\"/>\n* Stability issues: Interaction of control system of DG units may create local oscillations, requiring a thorough small-disturbance stability analysis.

      "text": "'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.<ref>See ref. below for first published work.</ref>  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].\n\nThe principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.\n\nIf <math>\\mathcal{U}</math> is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control <math>u^*</math> must satisfy:\n:<math>H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\\lambda^*(t),t) \\leq H(x^*(t),u,\\lambda^*(t),t), \\quad \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{U}, \\quad t \\in [t_0, t_f]</math>\nwhere <math>x^*\\in C^1[t_0,t_f]</math> is the optimal state trajectory and <math>\\lambda^* \\in BV[t_0,t_f]</math> is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.<ref>More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C<sup>1</sup>]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces</ref>\n\nThe result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.\n\nSpecial conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived.

The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.<ref>See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.</ref>\n\n==Notation==\nIn what follows we will be making use of the following notation.\n:<math>\n\\Psi_T(x(T))= \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(x)}{\\partial T}|_{x=x(T)} \\,\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\Psi_x(x(T))=\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\n\\Psi(x)}{\\partial x_1}|_{x=x(T)} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial\n\\Psi(x)}{\\partial x_n} |_{x=x(T)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nH_x(x^*,u^*,\\lambda^*,t)=\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\\lambda=\\lambda^*}\n& \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\\lambda=\\lambda^*}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nL_x(x^*,u^*)=\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}\n& \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nf_x(x^*,u^*)=\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_n}{\\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &\n\\ldots & \\frac{\\partial f_n}{\\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==\nHere the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take <math>x</math> to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input <math>u</math>, such that\n:<math>\n\\dot{x}=f(x,u), \\quad x(0)=x_0, \\quad u(t) \\in \\mathcal{U}, \\quad t \\in\n[0,T]\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{U}</math> is the set of admissible controls and <math>T</math> is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control <math>u \\in \\mathcal{U}</math> must be chosen for all <math>t \\in [0,T]</math> to minimize the objective functional <math>J</math> which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as\n\n:<math>\nJ=\\Psi(x(T))+\\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \\,dt\n</math>\n\nThe constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] <math>L</math> by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector <math>\\lambda</math>, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] <math>H</math> defined for all <math>t \\in [0,T]</math> by:\n:<math>\nH(x(t),u(t),\\lambda(t),t)=\\lambda^{\\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \\,\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\lambda^{\\rm T}</math> is the transpose of <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\nPontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory <math>x^*</math>, optimal control <math>u^*</math>, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector <math>\\lambda^*</math> must  minimize the Hamiltonian <math>H</math> so that\n\n:<math>\n(1) \\qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\\lambda^*(t),t)\\leq H(x^*(t),u,\\lambda^*(t),t) \\,\n</math>\n\nfor all time <math>t \\in [0,T]</math> and for all permissible control inputs <math>u \\in \\mathcal{U}</math>. It must also be the case that\n\n:<math>\n(2) \\qquad \\Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \\,\n</math>\n\nAdditionally, the [[costate equations]]\n\n:<math>\n(3) \\qquad -\\dot{\\lambda}^{\\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\\lambda(t),t)=\\lambda^{\\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))\n</math>\n\nmust be satisfied. If the final state <math>x(T)</math> is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that\n\n:<math>\n(4) \\qquad \\lambda^{\\rm T}(T)=\\Psi_x(x(T)) \\,\n</math>\n\nThese four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when <math>x(T)</math> is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces]], Lagrangian method in calculus of variations\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |first=V.

      "title": "Shape optimization",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_optimization",
      "text": "'''Shape optimization''' is part of the field of [[optimal control]] theory. The typical problem is to find the [[shape]] which is optimal in that it minimizes a certain cost [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] while satisfying given [[constraint (mathematics)|constraints]]. In many cases, the functional being solved depends on the solution of a given partial differential equation defined on the variable domain.\n\n[[Topology optimization]] is, in addition, concerned with the number of connected components/boundaries belonging to the domain. Such methods are needed since typically shape optimization methods work in a subset of allowable shapes which have fixed topological properties, such as having a fixed number of holes in them. Topological optimization techniques can then help work around the limitations of pure shape optimization.\n\n==Definition==\n[[Mathematics|Mathematically]], shape optimization can be posed as the problem of finding a [[bounded set]] <math>\\Omega</math>, [[maxima and minima|minimizing]] a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}(\\Omega)</math>, \npossibly subject to a [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] of the form\n:<math>\\mathcal{G}(\\Omega)=0.</math> \nUsually we are interested in sets <math>\\Omega</math> which are [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] or C<sup>1</sup> [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] and consist of finitely many [[connected component (analysis)|components]], which is a way of saying that we would like to find a rather pleasing shape as a solution, not some jumble of rough bits and pieces. Sometimes additional constraints need to be imposed to that end to ensure well-posedness of the problem and uniqueness of the solution.\n\nShape optimization is an [[infinite-dimensional optimization]] problem. Furthermore, the space of allowable shapes over which the optimization is performed does not admit a [[vector space]] structure, making application of traditional optimization methods more difficult.\n\n==Examples==\n{{Unordered list\n|Among all three-dimensional shapes of given volume, find the one which has minimal surface area. Here: \n:<math>\\mathcal{F}(\\Omega)=\\mbox{Area}(\\partial \\Omega)</math>, \nwith \n:<math>\\mathcal{G}(\\Omega)=\\mbox{Volume}(\\Omega)-\\mbox{const.}</math> \nThe answer, given by the [[isoperimetric inequality]], is a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]. \n|Find the shape of an airplane wing which minimizes [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. Here the constraints could be the wing strength, or the wing dimensions.\n|Find the shape of various mechanical structures, which can resist a given [[Stress (physics)|stress]] while having a minimal mass/volume. \n|Given a known three-dimensional object with a fixed radiation source inside, deduce the shape and size of the source based on measurements done on part of the boundary of the object. A formulation of this [[inverse problem]] using [[least-squares]] fit leads to a shape optimization problem.\n}}\n\n==Techniques==\n\nShape optimization problems are usually solved [[numerical analysis|numerically]], by using [[iterative method]]s. That is, one starts with an initial guess for a shape, and then gradually evolves it,\nuntil it morphs into the optimal shape.\n\n=== Keeping track of the shape ===\n[[File:Shape optimization for buildings by formsolver.jpg|thumbnail|right|Example: Shape optimization as applied to building geometry. Example provided courtesy of Formsolver.com]]\n[[File:Emerging Shape Optimization Families for buildings by formsolver.jpg|thumbnail|right|Example: Optimization shape families resulting from differing goal parameters. Example provided courtesy of Formsolver.com]]\nTo solve a shape optimization problem, one needs to find a way to represent a shape in the [[computer memory]], and follow its evolution. Several approaches are usually used.\n\nOne approach is to follow the boundary of the shape. For that, one can \nsample the shape boundary in a relatively dense and uniform manner, that is, to consider enough points to get a sufficiently accurate outline of the shape. Then, one can evolve the shape by gradually moving the boundary points. This is called the ''Lagrangian approach''.\n\nAnother approach is to consider a [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined on a rectangular box around the shape, which is positive inside of the shape, zero on the boundary of the shape, and negative outside of the shape. One can then evolve this function instead of the shape itself. One can consider a rectangular grid on the box and sample the function at the grid points. As the shape evolves, the grid points do not change; only the function values at the grid points change. This approach, of using a fixed grid, is called the ''Eulerian approach''. The idea of using a function to represent the shape is at the basis of the [[level-set method]].\n\nA third approach is to think of the shape evolution as of a flow problem. That is, one can imagine that the shape is made of a plastic material gradually deforming such that any point inside or on the boundary of the shape can be always traced back to a point of the original shape in a one-to-one fashion. Mathematically, if <math>\\Omega_0</math> is the initial shape, and <math>\\Omega_t</math> is the shape at time ''t'', one considers the [[diffeomorphism]]s\n\n:<math>f_t:\\Omega_0\\to \\Omega_t, \\mbox{ for } 0\\le t\\le t_0.</math>\n\nThe idea is again that shapes are difficult entities to be dealt with directly, so manipulate them by means of a function.\n\n=== Iterative methods using shape gradients ===\n\nConsider a smooth velocity field <math>V</math> and the family of transformations <math>T_s</math> of the initial domain <math>\\Omega_0</math> under the velocity field <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>x(0) = x_0 \\in \\Omega_0, \\quad x'(s) = V(x(s)), \\quad T_s(x_0) = x(s), \\quad s \\geq 0 </math>,\n\nand denote\n\n:<math>\\Omega_0 \\mapsto T_s(\\Omega_0) = \\Omega_s.</math>\n\nThen the Gâteaux or shape derivative of <math>\\mathcal{F}(\\Omega)</math> at <math>\\Omega_0</math> with respect to the shape is the limit of\n\n:<math>d\\mathcal{F}(\\Omega_0;V) = \\lim_{s \\to 0}\\frac{\\mathcal{F}(\\Omega_s) - \\mathcal{F}(\\Omega_0)}{s}</math>\n\nif this limit exists. If in addition the derivative is linear with respect to <math>V</math>, there is a unique element of <math>\\nabla \\mathcal{F} \\in L^2(\\partial \\Omega_0)</math> and\n\n:<math>d\\mathcal{F}(\\Omega_0;V) = \\langle \\nabla \\mathcal{F}, V \\rangle_{\\partial \\Omega_0}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla \\mathcal{F}</math> is called the shape gradient. This gives a natural idea of [[gradient descent]], where the boundary <math>\\partial \\Omega</math> is evolved in the direction of negative shape gradient in order to reduce the value of the cost functional. Higher order derivatives can be similarly defined, leading to Newtonlike methods.\n\nTypically, gradient descent is preferred, even if requires a large number of iterations, because, it can be hard to compute the second-order derivative (that is, the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]])  of the objective functional <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>.\n\nIf the shape optimization problem has constraints, that is, the functional \n<math>\\mathcal{G}</math> is present, one has to find ways to convert the \nconstrained problem into an unconstrained one. Sometimes ideas based on [[Lagrange multipliers]] can work.\n\n=== Geometry parametrization ===\n\nShape optimization can be faced using standard optimization methods if a parametrization of the geometry is defined. Such parametrization is very important in CAE field where goal functions are usually complex functions evaluated using numerical models (CFD, FEA,...). A convenient approach, suitable for a wide class of problems, consists in the parametrization of the CAD model coupled with a full automation of all the process required for function evaluation (meshing, solving and result processing). [[Mesh morphing]] is a valid choice for complex problems that resolves typical issues associated with [[re-meshing]] such as discontinuities in the computed objective and constraint functions \n.<ref name=\"wilke\">Wilke, D.N.; Kok, S.; Groenwold,  A.A. (2010) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-009-0389-x ''The application of gradient-only optimization methods for problems discretized using non-constant methods''. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, Vol. 40, 433-451.]</ref>\nIn this case the parametrization is defined after the meshing stage acting directly on the numerical model used for calculation that is changed using mesh updating methods. \nThere are several algorithms available for mesh morphing ([[deforming volume]]s, [[pseudosolid]]s, [[radial basis function]]s).\nThe selection of the parametrization approach depends mainly on the size of the problem: the CAD approach is preferred for small-to-medium sized models whilst the mesh morphing approach is the best (and sometimes the only feasible one) for large and very large models.\nThe multi-objective Pareto optimization (NSGA II) could be utilized as a powerful approach for shape optimization. In this regard, the Pareto optimization approach displays useful advantages in design method such as the effect of area constraint that other multi-objective optimization cannot declare it. The approach of using a penalty function is an effective technique which could be used in the first stage of optimization. In this method the constrained shape design problem is adapted to an unconstrained problem with utilizing the constraints in the objective function as a penalty factor. Most of the time penalty factor is dependent to the amount of constraint variation rather than constraint number. The GA real-coded technique is applied in the present optimization problem. Therefore, the calculations are based on real value of variables. <ref name=\"ssttds\">{{cite journal | last1 = Talebitooti | first1 = R.| last2 = shojaeefard | first2 = M.H.| last3 = Yarmohammadisatri | first3 = Sadegh | title = Shape design optimization of cylindrical tank using b-spline curves | url = | journal = Computer & Fluids | volume = 109 | pages = 100–112 | doi= 10.1016/j.compfluid.2014.12.004 | year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Topological derivative]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Allaire, G.

A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into \"solvable\" and \"perturbation\" parts.<ref name=\"General Perturbations\">{{cite book |isbn= 978-145378-1470|url= https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Astrodynamics-William-E-Wiesel/dp/1453781471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400160278&sr=1-1&keywords=modern+astrodynamics+wiesel |title=Modern Astrodynamics |author=William E.

The leading term in this power series is the solution of the exactly solvable problem, while further terms describe the deviation in the solution, due to the deviation from the initial problem. Formally, we have for the approximation to the full solution {{mvar|A}}, a series in the small parameter (here called {{mvar|ε}}), like the following:\n\n:<math> A= A_0 + \\varepsilon^1 A_1 + \\varepsilon^2 A_2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nIn this example, {{math|''A''<sub>0</sub>}} would be the known solution to the exactly solvable initial problem and {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ...}} represent the '''higher-order terms''' which may be found iteratively by some systematic procedure. For small {{mvar|ε}} these higher-order terms in the series become successively smaller.\n\nAn approximate \"perturbation solution\" is obtained by truncating the series, usually by keeping only the first two terms, the initial solution and the \"first-order\" perturbation correction\n:<math>A \\approx A_0 + \\varepsilon A_1~.</math>\n\nPerturbation theory is the most common tool for approximating the impact of anharmonic terms in the potential energy surface on the vibrational energies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mathematical Physics in Theoretical Chemistry, 2019|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==General description==\nPerturbation theory is closely related to methods used in [[numerical analysis]]. The earliest use of what would now be called ''perturbation theory'' was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of [[celestial mechanics]]: for example the [[orbit of the Moon]], which moves noticeably differently from a simple [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]] because of the competing gravitation of the Earth and the [[Sun]].<ref>[https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.70.589 Martin C. Gutzwiller, \"Moon-Earth-Sun: The oldest three-body problem\", Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 589 – Published 1 April 1998]</ref>\n\nPerturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is ''simple enough'' to be solved exactly. In [[celestial mechanics]], this is usually a [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]]. Under [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|non-relativistic gravity]], an ellipse is exactly correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the [[Moon]]) but not quite correct when there are [[three-body problem|three or more objects]] (say, the Earth, [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and the rest of the [[solar system]]) and not quite correct when the gravitational interaction is stated using formulations from [https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html General relativity].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe solved, but simplified problem is then ''\"perturbed\"'' to make the conditions that the perturbed solution actually satisfies closer to the formula in the original problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third body (the [[Sun]]). Typically, the \"conditions\" that represent reality are a formula (or several) that specifically express some physical law, like [[Newton's second law|Newton's second law, the force-acceleration equation]],\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a} ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the example, the force {{math|'''F'''}} is calculated based on the number of gravitationally relevant bodies; the acceleration {{math|'''a'''}} is obtained, using calculus, from the path of the [[Moon]] in its orbit. Both of these come in two forms: approximate values for force and acceleration, which result from simplifications, and hypothetical exact values for force and acceleration, which would require the complete answer to calculate.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe slight changes that result from accommodating the perturbation, which themselves may have been simplified yet again, are used as corrections to the approximate solution. Because of simplifications introduced along every step of the way, the corrections are never perfect, and the conditions met by the corrected solution do not perfectly match the equation demanded by reality. However, even only one cycle of corrections often provides an excellent approximate answer to what the real solution should be.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThere is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, cycles of finding increasingly better corrections could go on indefinitely. In practice, one typically stops at one or two cycles of corrections. The usual difficulty with the method is that the corrections progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. [[Isaac Newton]] is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [[Moon]]'s orbit, that ''\"It causeth my head to ache.\"''<ref>{{Citation | last1=Cropper | first1=William H. | title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=978-0-19-517324-6 | year=2004 | page=34}}.</ref>\n\nThis general procedure is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering: start with a simplified problem and gradually add corrections that make the formula that the corrected problem becomes a closer and closer match to the original formula.\n\n==Examples==\nExamples for the \"mathematical description\" are:  an [[algebraic equation]],<ref>[http://math.unm.edu/~lromero/2013/class_notes/poly.pdf L.

For instance, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] explained the gravitation between two astronomical bodies, but when a third body is added, the problem was, \"How does each body pull on each?\" Newton's equation only allowed the mass of two bodies to be analyzed. The gradually increasing accuracy of [[astrometry|astronomical observations]] led to incremental demands in the accuracy of solutions to Newton's gravitational equations, which led several notable 18th and 19th&nbsp;century mathematicians, such as [[Lagrange]] and [[Laplace]], to extend and generalize the methods of perturbation theory. These well-developed perturbation methods were adopted and adapted to solve new problems arising during the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in 20th&nbsp;century atomic and subatomic physics. [[Paul Dirac]] developed perturbation theory in 1927 to evaluate when a particle would be emitted in radioactive elements. It was later named [[Fermi's golden rule]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bransden|first1=B. H.|last2=Joachain|first2=C.

This was the origin of the [[three-body problem]]; thus, in studying the system Moon–Earth–Sun the mass ratio between the Moon and the Earth was chosen as the small parameter. [[Lagrange]] and [[Laplace]] were the first to advance the view that the constants which describe the motion of a planet around the Sun are  \"perturbed\", as it were, by the motion of other planets and vary as a function of time; hence the name \"perturbation theory\".<ref name=\"EoM\" />\n\nPerturbation theory was investigated by the classical scholars—[[Laplace]], [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]], [[Gauss]]—as a result of which the computations could be performed with a very high accuracy. [[Discovery of Neptune|The discovery of the planet Neptune]] in 1848 by [[Urbain Le Verrier]], based on the deviations in motion of the planet [[Uranus]] (he sent the coordinates to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] who successfully observed Neptune through his telescope), represented a triumph of perturbation theory.<ref name=\"EoM\" />\n\n==Perturbation orders==\nThe standard exposition of perturbation theory is given in terms of the ''order'' to which the perturbation is carried out: '''first-order perturbation theory''' or '''second-order perturbation theory''', and whether the perturbed states are degenerate, which requires '''[[singular perturbation]]'''.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Short description|application of mathematical perturbation theory to approximating Hamiltonians of quantum mechanical systems}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2018}} \nIn [[quantum mechanics]], '''perturbation theory''' is a set of approximation schemes directly related to mathematical [[perturbation theory|perturbation]] for describing a complicated [[quantum system]] in terms of a simpler one. The idea is to start with a simple system for which a mathematical solution is known, and add an additional \"perturbing\" [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] representing a weak disturbance to the system. If the disturbance is not too large, the various physical quantities associated with the perturbed system (e.g. its [[energy level]]s and [[quantum state|eigenstates]]) can be expressed as \"corrections\" to those of the simple system. These corrections, being small compared to the size of the quantities themselves, can be calculated using approximate methods such as [[asymptotic series]].  The complicated system can therefore be studied based on knowledge of the simpler one. In effect, it is describing a complicated unsolved system using a simple, solved system.\n\n== Approximate Hamiltonians ==\n\nPerturbation theory is an important tool for describing real quantum systems, as it turns out to be very difficult to find exact solutions to the [[Schrödinger equation]] for [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the [[hydrogen atom]], the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] and the [[particle in a box]], are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, we can use the known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.\n\n== Applying perturbation theory ==\nPerturbation theory is applicable if the problem at hand cannot be solved exactly, but can be formulated by adding a \"small\" term to the mathematical description of the exactly solvable problem.\n\nFor example, by adding a perturbative [[electric potential]] to the quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom, tiny shifts in the [[spectral line]]s of hydrogen caused by the presence of an [[electric field]] (the [[Stark effect]]) can be calculated. This is only approximate because the sum of a [[Coulomb potential]] with a linear potential is unstable (has no true bound states) although the [[tunneling time]] ([[decay rate]]) is very long. This instability shows up as a broadening of the energy spectrum lines, which perturbation theory fails to reproduce entirely.\n\nThe expressions produced by perturbation theory are not exact, but they can lead to accurate results as long as the expansion parameter, say {{mvar|α}}, is very small. Typically, the results are expressed in terms of finite [[power series]] in {{mvar|α}} that seem to converge to the exact values when summed to higher order. After a certain order {{math|''n'' ~ 1/''α''}} however, the results become increasingly worse since the series are usually [[divergent series|divergent]] (being [[asymptotic series]]). There exist ways to convert them into convergent series, which can be evaluated for large-expansion parameters, most efficiently by the [[Variational method (quantum mechanics)|variational method]].\n\nIn the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), in which the [[electron]]–[[photon]] interaction is treated perturbatively, the calculation of the electron's [[magnetic moment]] has been found to agree with experiment to eleven decimal places.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tenth-order QED lepton anomalous magnetic moment: Eighth-order vertices containing a second-order vacuum polarization|last1=Aoyama|first1=Tatsumi|last2=Hayakawa|first2=Masashi|last3=Kinoshita|first3=Toichiro|last4=Nio|first4=Makiko|journal=Physical Review D|volume=85|issue=3|pages=033007|year=2012|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.85.033007|arxiv=1110.2826|bibcode=2012PhRvD..85c3007A}}</ref> In QED and other [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], special calculation techniques known as [[Feynman diagram]]s are used to systematically sum the power series terms.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n\n==== Large perturbations ====\n\nUnder some circumstances, perturbation theory is an invalid approach to take. This happens when the system we wish to describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some simple system. In [[quantum chromodynamics]], for instance, the interaction of [[quark]]s with the [[gluon]] field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the [[coupling constant]] (the expansion parameter) becomes too large.{{clarify|what does too large mean?|date=April 2017}}\n\n==== Non-adiabatic states ====\n\nPerturbation theory also fails to describe states that are not generated [[Adiabatic process (quantum mechanics)|adiabatically]] from the \"free model\", including [[bound state]]s and various collective phenomena such as [[soliton]]s.{{fact|date=November 2018}} Imagine, for example, that we have a system of free (i.e. non-interacting) particles, to which an attractive interaction is introduced. Depending on the form of the interaction, this may create an entirely new set of eigenstates corresponding to groups of particles bound to one another. An example of this phenomenon may be found in conventional [[superconductivity]], in which the [[phonon]]-mediated attraction between [[conduction electron]]s leads to the formation of correlated electron pairs known as [[Cooper pair]]s. When faced with such systems, one usually turns to other approximation schemes, such as the [[variational method (quantum mechanics)|variational method]] and the [[WKB approximation]]. This is because there is no analogue of a [[bound particle]] in the unperturbed model and the energy of a soliton typically goes as the ''inverse'' of the expansion parameter. However, if we \"integrate\" over the solitonic phenomena, the nonperturbative corrections in this case will be tiny; of the order of exp(−1/{{mvar|g}}) or exp(−1/{{mvar|g}}<sup>2</sup>) in the perturbation parameter {{mvar|g}}. Perturbation theory can only detect solutions \"close\" to the unperturbed solution, even if there are other solutions for which the perturbative expansion is not valid.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Difficult computations ====\n\nThe problem of non-perturbative systems has been somewhat alleviated by the advent of modern [[computer]]s. It has become practical to obtain numerical non-perturbative solutions for certain problems, using methods such as [[density functional theory]]. These advances have been of particular benefit to the field of [[quantum chemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Mourik |first1=T. |last2=Buhl |first2=M. |last3=Gaigeot |first3=M.-P. |title=Density functional theory across chemistry, physics and biology |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |date=10 February 2014 |volume=372 |issue=2011 |pages=20120488–20120488 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2012.0488 |pmc=3928866 |pmid=24516181 }}</ref> Computers have also been used to carry out perturbation theory calculations to extraordinarily high levels of precision, which has proven important in [[particle physics]] for generating theoretical results that can be compared with experiment.\n\n== Time-independent perturbation theory ==\nTime-independent perturbation theory is one of two categories of perturbation theory, the other being time-dependent perturbation (see next section). In time-independent perturbation theory the perturbation Hamiltonian is static (i.e., possesses no time dependence).

Chapter 5</ref> with an unperturbed Hamiltonian {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}}, which is also assumed to have no time dependence. It has known energy levels and eigenstates, arising from the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]]:\n\n:<math> H_0 \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang = E_n^{(0)} \\left |n^{(0)} \\right\\rang,  \\qquad n = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots </math>\n\nFor simplicity, we have assumed that the energies are discrete. The {{math|(0)}} superscripts denote that these quantities are associated with the unperturbed system. Note the use of [[bra–ket notation]].\n\nWe now introduce a perturbation to the Hamiltonian. Let {{mvar|V}} be a Hamiltonian representing a weak physical disturbance, such as a potential energy produced by an external field. (Thus, {{mvar|V}} is formally a [[Hermitian operator]].) Let {{mvar|λ}} be a dimensionless parameter that can take on values ranging continuously from 0 (no perturbation) to 1 (the full perturbation). The perturbed Hamiltonian is\n\n:<math> H = H_0 + \\lambda V </math>\n\nThe energy levels and eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian are again given by the Schrödinger equation:\n\n:<math> \\left(H_0 + \\lambda V \\right) |n\\rang = E_n |n\\rang . </math>\n\nOur goal is to express {{mvar|E<sub>n</sub>}} and <math>|n\\rang</math> in terms of the energy levels and eigenstates of the old Hamiltonian. If the perturbation is sufficiently weak, we can write them as a (Maclaurin) [[power series]] in {{mvar|λ}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nE_n &= E_n^{(0)} + \\lambda E_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots \\\\\n|n\\rang &= \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang + \\lambda \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + \\lambda^2 \\left |n^{(2)} \\right \\rang + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nE_n^{(k)} &= \\frac{1}{k!} \\frac{d^k E_n}{d \\lambda^k} \\bigg|_{\\lambda = 0}\\\\\n\\left |n^{(k)} \\right \\rang &= \\frac{1}{k!}\\frac{d^k |n\\rang }{d \\lambda^k} \\bigg|_{\\lambda = 0}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, these reduce to the unperturbed values, which are the first term in each series. Since the perturbation is weak, the energy levels and eigenstates should not deviate too much from their unperturbed values, and the terms should rapidly become smaller as we go to higher order.\n\nSubstituting the power series expansion into the Schrödinger equation, we obtain\n\n:<math>\\left(H_0 + \\lambda V \\right) \\left(\\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang + \\lambda \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + \\cdots \\right) = \\left(E_n^{(0)} + \\lambda E_n^{(1)} +  \\cdots \\right) \\left(\\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang + \\lambda \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + \\cdots \\right)</math>\n\nExpanding this equation and comparing coefficients of each power of ''λ'' results in an infinite series of [[simultaneous equation]]s. The zeroth-order equation is simply the Schrödinger equation for the unperturbed system. The first-order equation is\n\n:<math> H_0 \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + V \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang = E_n^{(0)} \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + E_n^{(1)} \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang </math>\n\nOperating through by <math> \\lang n^{(0)} | </math>, the first term on the left-hand side cancels the first term on the right-hand side. (Recall, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]]). This leads to the first-order energy shift:\n\n:<math> E_n^{(1)} = \\left \\langle n^{(0)} \\right | V \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang </math>\n\nThis is simply the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of the perturbation Hamiltonian while the system is in the unperturbed state. This result can be interpreted in the following way: suppose the perturbation is applied, but we keep the system in the quantum state <math>|n^{(0)}\\rang</math>, which is a valid quantum state though no longer an energy eigenstate. The perturbation causes the average energy of this state to increase by <math>\\lang n^{(0)}|V|n^{(0)}\\rang</math>. However, the true energy shift is slightly different, because the perturbed eigenstate is not exactly the same as ''<math>|n^{(0)}\\rang</math>''. These further shifts are given by the second and higher order corrections to the energy.\n\nBefore we compute the corrections to the energy eigenstate, we need to address the issue of normalization. We may suppose\n\n:<math>\\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right | \\left. n^{(0)} \\right \\rang = 1,</math>\n\nbut perturbation theory assumes we also have <math>\\lang n | n \\rang = 1</math>. It follows that at first order in {{mvar|λ}}, we must have\n\n:<math> \\left( \\left\\lang n^{(0)}\\right| + \\lambda \\left\\lang n^{(1)} \\right| \\right) \\left(\\left| n^{(0)} \\right\\rang + \\lambda \\left| n^{(1)} \\right\\rang \\right) = 1</math>\n:<math>\\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right | \\left. n^{(0)} \\right \\rang + \\lambda \\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right | \\left. n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + \\lambda\\left \\lang n^{(1)} \\right | \\left. n^{(0)} \\right \\rang + \\cancel{\\lambda^2 \\left \\lang n^{(1)} \\right | \\left . n^{(1)} \\right \\rang} = 1</math>\n:<math>\\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right | \\left. n^{(1)} \\right \\rang + \\left \\lang n^{(1)} \\right | \\left. n^{(0)} \\right \\rang = 0.</math>\n\nSince the overall phase is not determined in quantum mechanics, [[without loss of generality]], in time independent theory we may assume <math>\\lang n^{(0)}|n^{(1)} \\rang </math> is purely real. Therefore,\n\n:<math>\\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right | \\left. n^{(1)} \\right \\rang =  -\\left \\lang n^{(1)} \\right | \\left. n^{(0)} \\right \\rang,</math>\n\nand we deduce\n\n:<math> \\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right | \\left. n^{(1)} \\right \\rang = 0.</math>\n\nTo obtain the first-order correction to the energy eigenstate, we insert our expression for the first-order energy correction back into the result shown above of equating the first-order coefficients of {{mvar|λ}}. We then make use of the [[resolution of the identity]],\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang &= \\left( \\sum_{k\\ne n} \\left |k^{(0)} \\right \\rang \\left \\lang k^{(0)} \\right | \\right) V \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang  + \\left(\\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rangle \\left \\lang n^{(0)} \\right |\\right)  V \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang  \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k\\ne n} \\left |k^{(0)} \\right \\rang \\left \\lang k^{(0)} \\right | V \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rangle  + E_n^{(1)} \\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the <math>|k^{(0)}\\rangle</math> are in the [[orthogonal complement]] of <math>|n^{(0)}\\rangle</math>. The first-order equation may thus be expressed as\n\n:<math>\\left(E_n^{(0)} - H_0 \\right) \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang = \\sum_{k \\ne n} \\left |k^{(0)} \\right \\rang \\left \\langle k^{(0)} \\right |V\\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang </math>\n\nFor the moment, suppose that the zeroth-order energy level is not [[Degenerate energy level|degenerate]], i.e. there is no  eigenstate of {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} in the orthogonal complement of <math>|n^{(0)}\\rangle</math> with the energy <math>E_n^{(0)}</math>. After renaming the summation dummy index above as <math>k'</math>, we can pick any <math>k\\neq n</math>, and multiply through by <math>\\lang k^{(0)}|</math> giving\n\n:<math>\\left(E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)} \\right) \\left \\langle k^{(0)} \\right. \\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang = \\left \\langle k^{(0)} \\right |V\\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang </math>\n\nWe see that the above <math>\\langle k^{(0)} |n^{(1)} \\rang</math> also gives us the component of the first-order correction along <math>|k^{(0)}\\rang</math>.\n\nThus in total we get,\n\n:<math>\\left |n^{(1)} \\right \\rang = \\sum_{k \\ne n} \\frac{\\left \\langle k^{(0)} \\right |V\\left |n^{(0)} \\right \\rang}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}} \\left |k^{(0)} \\right \\rang </math>\n\nThe first-order change in the {{mvar|n}}-th energy eigenket has a contribution from each of the energy eigenstates {{math|''k'' ≠ ''n''}}. Each term is proportional to the matrix element <math>\\lang k^{(0)} | V | n^{(0)} \\rang </math>, which is a measure of how much the perturbation mixes eigenstate {{mvar|n}} with eigenstate {{mvar|k}}; it is also inversely proportional to the energy difference between eigenstates {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|n}}, which means that the perturbation deforms the eigenstate to a greater extent if there are more eigenstates at nearby energies. We see also that the expression is singular if any of these states have the same energy as state {{mvar|n}}, which is why we assumed that there is no degeneracy.\n\n=== Second-order and higher corrections ===\nWe can find the higher-order deviations by a similar procedure, though the calculations become quite tedious with our current formulation.

{{mvar|k<sub>j</sub>}} such that the denominator does not vanish.\n}}\n\n=== Effects of degeneracy ===\nSuppose that two or more energy eigenstates are [[Degenerate energy level|degenerate]]. The first-order energy shift is not well defined, since there is no unique way to choose a basis of eigenstates for the unperturbed system. The various eigenstates for a given energy will perturb with different energies, or may well possess no continuous family of perturbations at all. \n\nThis is manifested in the calculation of the perturbed eigenstate via the fact that the operator\n:<math> E_n^{(0)} - H_0 </math>\ndoes not have a well-defined inverse.\n\nLet {{mvar|D}} denote the subspace spanned by these degenerate eigenstates. No matter how small the perturbation is, in the degenerate subspace {{mvar|D}} the energy differences between the eigenstates of {{math|''H''}} are non-zero, so complete mixing of at least some of these states is assured. Typically, the eigenvalues will split, and the eigenspaces will become simple (one-dimensional), or at least  of smaller dimension than ''D''. \n\nThe  successful perturbations will not be \"small\" relative to a poorly chosen basis of ''D''. Instead, we consider the perturbation \"small\" if the new eigenstate is close to the subspace {{mvar|D}}. The new Hamiltonian must be diagonalized in {{mvar|D}}, or a slight variation of ''D'', so to speak. These  perturbed eigenstates in {{mvar|D}} are now the basis for the perturbation expansion,\n:<math>|n\\rangle =  \\sum_{k \\in D} \\alpha_{nk} |k^{(0)}\\rangle + \\lambda|n^{(1)}\\rangle.</math>\n\nFor the first-order perturbation, we need solve the perturbed Hamiltonian restricted to the degenerate subspace {{mvar|D}},\n:<math>V |k^{(0)}\\rangle  = \\epsilon_k |k^{(0)}\\rangle + \\text{small} \\qquad \\forall |k^{(0)}\\rangle \\in D,</math>\nsimultaneously for all the degenerate eigenstates, where <math>\\epsilon_k</math> are first-order corrections to the degenerate energy levels, and \"small\" is a  vector of <math>O(\\lambda)</math> orthogonal to ''D''. This  amounts  to diagonalizing the matrix \n:<math>\\langle k^{(0)} | V |l^{(0)}\\rangle = V_{kl} \\qquad \\forall \\; |k^{(0)}\\rangle, |l^{(0)}\\rangle \\in D. </math>\n\nThis procedure is approximate, since we neglected states outside the {{mvar|D}} subspace (\"small\"). The splitting of degenerate energies <math>\\epsilon_k</math> is generally observed. Although the splitting may be small, <math>O(\\lambda)</math>,  compared to the range of energies found in the system, it is crucial in understanding certain details, such as spectral lines in [[Electron Spin Resonance]] experiments.\n\nHigher-order corrections due to other eigenstates outside {{mvar|D}}  can be found in the same way as for the non-degenerate case,\n:<math> \\left(E_n^{(0)} - H_0 \\right) |n^{(1)}\\rang = \\sum_{k \\not\\in D} \\left(\\langle k^{(0)}|V|n^{(0)} \\rangle \\right) |k^{(0)}\\rang. </math>\n\nThe operator on the left-hand side is not singular when applied to eigenstates outside {{mvar|D}}, so we can write\n:<math> |n^{(1)}\\rangle = \\sum_{k \\not\\in D} \\frac{\\langle k^{(0)}|V|n^{(0)} \\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}} |k^{(0)}\\rang, </math>\nbut the effect on the degenerate states is of <math>O(\\lambda)</math>.  \n\nNear-degenerate states should also be treated similarly,  when the original Hamiltonian splits  aren't   larger than the perturbation in the near-degenerate subspace.  An application is found in the [[nearly free electron model]], where near-degeneracy, treated properly, gives rise to an energy gap even for small perturbations. Other eigenstates will only shift the absolute energy of all near-degenerate states simultaneously.\n\n=== Generalization to multi-parameter case ===\nThe generalization of the time-independent perturbation theory to the case where there are multiple small parameters <math>x^\\mu = (x^1,x^2,\\cdots)</math> in place of λ can be formulated more systematically using the language of [[differential geometry]], which basically defines the derivatives of the quantum states and calculates the perturbative corrections by taking derivatives iteratively at the unperturbed point.\n\n==== Hamiltonian and force operator ====\nFrom the differential geometric point of view, a parameterized Hamiltonian is considered as a function defined on the parameter [[manifold]] that maps each particular set of parameters <math>(x^1,x^2,\\cdots)</math> to an Hermitian operator {{math|''H''(''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>'')}} that acts on the Hilbert space. The parameters here can be external field, interaction strength, or driving parameters in the [[quantum phase transition]]. Let {{math|''E<sub>n</sub>''(''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>'')}} and <math>|n(x^\\mu)\\rangle</math> be the {{mvar|n}}-th eigenenergy and eigenstate of {{math|''H''(''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>'')}} respectively. In the language of differential geometry, the states <math>|n(x^\\mu)\\rangle</math> form a [[vector bundle]] over the parameter manifold, on which derivatives of these states can be defined. The perturbation theory is to answer the following question: given <math>E_n(x^\\mu_0)</math> and <math>|n(x^\\mu_0)\\rangle</math> at an unperturbed reference point <math>x^\\mu_0</math>, how to estimate the {{math|''E<sub>n</sub>''(''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>'')}} and <math>|n(x^\\mu)\\rangle</math> at {{math|''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>''}} close to that reference point.\n\nWithout loss of generality, the coordinate system can be shifted, such that the reference point <math>x^\\mu_0 = 0</math> is set to be the origin. The following linearly parameterized Hamiltonian is frequently used\n\n:<math>H(x^\\mu)= H(0)+x^\\mu F_\\mu.</math>\n\nIf the parameters {{math|''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>''}} are considered as generalized coordinates, then {{math|''F<sub>μ</sub>''}} should be identified as the generalized force operators related to those coordinates. Different indices {{mvar|μ}} label the different forces along different directions in the parameter manifold. For example, if {{math|''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>''}} denotes the external magnetic field in the {{mvar|μ}}-direction, then {{math|''F<sub>μ</sub>''}} should be the magnetization in the same direction.\n\n==== Perturbation theory as power series expansion ====\nThe validity of the perturbation theory lies on the adiabatic assumption, which assumes the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are smooth functions of parameters such that their values in the vicinity region can be calculated in power series (like [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]]) of the parameters:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nE_n(x^\\mu) &= E_n + x^\\mu\\partial_\\mu E_n + \\frac{1}{2!}x^\\mu x^\\nu\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu E_n+\\cdots \\\\\n\\left | n(x^\\mu) \\right \\rangle &= | n\\rangle + x^\\mu|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2!}x^\\mu x^\\nu|\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu  n\\rangle+\\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nHere {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>}} denotes the derivative with respect to {{math|''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>''}}. When applying to the state <math>|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle</math>, it should be understood as the [[covariant derivative]] if the vector bundle is equipped with non-vanishing [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]]. All the terms on the right-hand-side of the series are evaluated at {{math|''x<sup>&thinsp;μ</sup>'' {{=}} 0}}, e.g. {{math|''E<sub>n</sub>'' ≡ ''E<sub>n</sub>''(0)}} and <math>|n\\rangle\\equiv |n(0)\\rangle</math>. This convention will be adopted throughout this subsection, that all functions without the parameter dependence explicitly stated are assumed to be evaluated at the origin. The power series may converge slowly or even not converge when the energy levels are close to each other. The adiabatic assumption breaks down when there is energy level degeneracy, and hence the perturbation theory is not applicable in that case.\n\n==== Hellmann–Feynman theorems ====\nThe above power series expansion can be readily evaluated if there is a systematic approach to calculate the derivates to any order. Using the [[chain rule]], the derivatives can be broken down to the single derivative on either the energy or the state. The [[Hellmann–Feynman theorem]]s are used to calculate these single derivatives. The first Hellmann–Feynman theorem gives the derivative of the energy,\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu E_n=\\langle n|\\partial_\\mu H | n\\rangle</math>\n\nThe second Hellmann–Feynman theorem gives the derivative of the state (resolved by the complete basis with m ≠ n),\n\n:<math>\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle=\\frac{\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H | n\\rangle}{E_n-E_m}, \\qquad \\langle\\partial_\\mu m| n\\rangle=\\frac{\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H | n\\rangle}{E_m-E_n}.</math>\n\nFor the linearly parameterized Hamiltonian, {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>''H''}} simply stands for the generalized force operator {{math|''F<sub>μ</sub>''}}.\n\nThe theorems can be simply derived by applying the differential operator {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>}} to both sides of the [[Schrödinger equation]] <math>H|n\\rang=E_n|n\\rang,</math> which reads\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu H|n\\rangle + H|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle=\\partial_\\mu E_n|n\\rangle+E_n|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle.</math>\n\nThen overlap with the state <math>\\langle m|</math> from left and make use of the Schrödinger equation <math>\\langle m|H=\\langle m|E_m</math> again,\n\n:<math>\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H|n\\rangle + E_m\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle=\\partial_\\mu E_n\\langle m|n\\rangle+E_n\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle.</math>\n\nGiven that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian always form an orthonormal basis <math>\\langle m|n \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}</math>, the cases of {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''n''}} and {{math|''m'' ≠ ''n''}} can be discussed separately. The first case will lead to the first theorem and the second case to the second theorem, which can be shown immediately by rearranging the terms. With the differential rules given by the Hellmann–Feynman theorems, the perturbative correction to the energies and states can be calculated systematically.\n\n==== Correction of energy and state ====\nTo the second order, the energy correction reads\n\n:<math>E_n(x^\\mu)=\\langle n|H|n\\rangle +\\langle n|\\partial_\\mu H|n\\rangle  x^\\mu + \\Re \\sum _{m\\neq n} \\frac{\\langle n|\\partial_\\nu H|m\\rangle \\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H|n\\rangle}{E_n-E_m}x^\\mu x^\\nu+\\cdots,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Re</math> denotes the [[real part]] function.\nThe first order derivative {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>''E<sub>n</sub>''}} is given by the first Hellmann–Feynman theorem directly. To obtain the second order derivative {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>∂<sub>''ν''</sub>''E<sub>n</sub>''}}, simply applying the differential operator {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>}} to the result of the first order derivative <math>\\langle n|\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle</math>, which reads\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu E_n=\\langle \\partial_\\mu n|\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle +\\langle  n|\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle + \\langle  n|\\partial_\\nu H|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle.</math>\n\nNote that for linearly parameterized Hamiltonian, there is no second derivative {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>∂<sub>''ν''</sub>''H'' {{=}} 0}} on the operator level. Resolve the derivative of state by inserting the complete set of basis,\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu E_n=\\sum_m\\left (\\langle \\partial_\\mu n|m\\rangle\\langle m|\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle + \\langle  n|\\partial_\\nu H|m\\rangle\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu n\\rangle\\right),</math>\n\nthen all parts can be calculated using the Hellmann–Feynman theorems. In terms of Lie derivatives, <math>\\langle \\partial_\\mu n|n\\rangle = \\langle  n| \\partial_\\mu n\\rangle = 0</math> according to the definition of the connection for the vector bundle. Therefore, the case {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''n''}} can be excluded from the summation, which avoids the singularity of the energy denominator. The same procedure can be carried on for higher order derivatives, from which higher order corrections are obtained.\n\nThe same computational scheme is applicable for the correction of states. The result to the second order is as follows\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\left |n \\left (x^\\mu \\right ) \\right\\rangle = |n\\rangle &+\\sum _{m\\neq n} \\frac{\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H|n\\rangle }{E_n-E_m}|m\\rangle x^\\mu \\\\\n&+\\left(\\sum_{m\\neq n} \\sum_{l\\neq n} \\frac{\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H|l\\rangle \\langle l|\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle }{(E_n-E_m)(E_n-E_l)}|m\\rangle -\\sum _{m\\neq n} \\frac{\\langle m|\\partial_\\mu H|n\\rangle \\langle n|\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle }{(E_n-E_m)^2}|m\\rangle -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum _{m\\neq n} \\frac{\\langle n|\\partial_\\mu H|m\\rangle \\langle m|\\partial_\\nu H|n\\rangle }{(E_n-E_m)^2}|m\\rangle \\right)x^\\mu x^\\nu+\\cdots.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBoth energy derivatives and state derivatives will be involved in deduction. Whenever a state derivative is encountered, resolve it by inserting the complete set of basis, then the Hellmann-Feynman theorem is applicable. Because differentiation can be calculated systematically, the series expansion approach to the perturbative corrections can be coded on computers with symbolic processing software like [[Mathematica]].\n\n==== Effective Hamiltonian ====\nLet {{math|''H''(0)}} be the Hamiltonian completely restricted either in the low-energy subspace <math>\\mathcal{H}_L</math> or in the high-energy subspace <math>\\mathcal{H}_H</math>, such that there is no matrix element in {{math|''H''(0)}} connecting the low- and the high-energy subspaces, i.e. <math>\\langle m|H(0)|l\\rangle=0</math> if <math> m\\in \\mathcal{H}_L, l\\in\\mathcal{H}_H</math>. Let {{math|''F<sub>μ</sub>'' {{=}} ∂<sub>''μ''</sub>''H''}} be the coupling terms connecting the subspaces.

Thus, the goals of time-dependent perturbation theory are slightly different from time-independent perturbation theory.  One is interested in the following quantities:\n* The time-dependent [[expectation value]] of some observable {{mvar|A}}, for a given initial state.\n* The time-dependent amplitudes{{clarify|reason=Why are these amplitudes changing? Are we allowing the initial state to evolve, as is done in the first item on the list, or are we taking the expectation value with respect to a changing operator, or what?|date=September 2016}}  of those quantum states that are energy eigenkets (eigenvectors) in the unperturbed system.\n\nThe first quantity is important because it gives rise to the [[classical mechanics|classical]] result of an  {{mvar|A}} measurement performed on a macroscopic number of copies of the perturbed system. For example, we could take  {{mvar|A}} to be the displacement in the {{mvar|x}}-direction of the electron in a hydrogen atom, in which case the expected value, when multiplied by an appropriate coefficient, gives the time-dependent [[dielectric polarization]] of a hydrogen gas. With an appropriate choice of perturbation (i.e. an oscillating electric potential), this allows one to calculate the AC [[permittivity]] of the gas.\n\nThe second quantity looks at the time-dependent probability of occupation for each eigenstate. This is particularly useful in [[laser]] physics, where one is interested in the populations of different atomic states in a gas when a time-dependent electric field is applied. These probabilities are also useful for calculating the \"quantum broadening\" of [[spectral line]]s (see [[line broadening]]) and [[particle decay]] in [[particle physics]] and [[nuclear physics]].\n\nWe will briefly examine the method behind Dirac's formulation of time-dependent perturbation theory. Choose an energy basis <math>{|n\\rangle}</math> for the unperturbed system. (We drop the (0) superscripts for the eigenstates, because it is not useful to speak of energy levels and eigenstates for the perturbed system.)\n\nIf the unperturbed system is an eigenstate (of the Hamiltonian) <math>|j\\rangle</math> at time {{mvar|t}} = 0, its state at subsequent times varies only by a [[phase (waves)|phase]] (in the [[Schrödinger picture]], where state vectors evolve in time and operators are constant),\n:<math> |j(t)\\rang = e^{-iE_j t /\\hbar} |j\\rang ~.</math>\n\nNow, introduce a time-dependent perturbing Hamiltonian {{math|''V''(''t'')}}. The Hamiltonian of the perturbed system is\n:<math> H = H_0 + V(t) ~.</math>\nLet <math>|\\psi(t)\\rang</math> denote the quantum state of the perturbed system at time {{mvar|t}}. It obeys the time-dependent Schrödinger equation,\n:<math> H |\\psi(t)\\rang = i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\psi(t)\\rang ~.</math>\n\nThe quantum state at each instant can be expressed as a linear combination of the complete eigenbasis of <math>|n\\rang</math>:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> |\\psi(t)\\rang = \\sum_n c_n(t) e^{- i E_n t / \\hbar} |n\\rang ~,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nwhere the {{math|''c<sub>n</sub>''(''t'')}}s are to be determined [[complex number|complex]] functions of {{mvar|t}} which we will refer to as '''amplitudes''' (strictly speaking, they are the amplitudes in the [[Dirac picture]]).\n\nWe have explicitly extracted the exponential phase factors <math>\\exp(- i E_n t / \\hbar)</math> on the right hand side. This is only a matter of convention, and may be done without loss of generality. The reason we go to this trouble is that when the system starts in the state <math>|j\\rang</math> and no perturbation is present, the amplitudes have the convenient property that, for all {{mvar|t}},\n{{math|''c<sub>j</sub>''(''t'')}} = 1 and {{math|''c<sub>n</sub>''(''t'')}}  = 0 if {{math|''n ≠ j''}}.\n\nThe square of the absolute amplitude  {{math|''c<sub>n</sub>''(''t'')}} is the probability that the system is in state  {{mvar|n}} at time  {{mvar|t}}, since\n:<math> \\left|c_n(t)\\right|^2 = \\left|\\lang n|\\psi(t)\\rang\\right|^2 ~.</math>\n\nPlugging into the Schrödinger equation and using the fact that ∂/∂''t'' acts by a [[product rule]], one obtains\n:<math> \\sum_n \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_n}{\\mathrm{d} t} - c_n(t) V(t) \\right) e^{- i E_n t /\\hbar} |n\\rang = 0  ~.</math>\n\nBy resolving the identity in front of {{mvar|V}} and multiplying through by the [[Bra-ket notation|bra]] <math>\\langle n|</math> on the left, this can be reduced to a set of coupled [[differential equation]]s for the amplitudes,\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c_n}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{-i}{\\hbar} \\sum_k \\lang n|V(t)|k\\rang \\,c_k(t)\\, e^{-i(E_k - E_n)t/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nwhere we have used equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) to evaluate the sum on {{mvar|n}} in the second term, then used the fact that <math>\\langle k| \\Psi(t) \\rangle = c_k(t)\n e^{-iE_kt/\\hbar}</math>.\n\nThe matrix elements of {{mvar|V}}  play a similar role as in time-independent perturbation theory, being proportional to the rate at which amplitudes are shifted between states. Note, however, that the direction of the shift is modified by the exponential phase factor. Over times much longer than the energy difference {{math|''E<sub>k</sub>'' − ''E<sub>n</sub>''}}, the phase winds around 0 several times. If the time-dependence of {{mvar|V}}  is sufficiently slow, this may cause the state amplitudes to oscillate. ( E.g., such oscillations are useful for managing radiative transitions in a [[laser]].)\n\nUp to this point, we have made no approximations, so this set of differential equations is exact. By supplying appropriate initial values  {{math|''c<sub>n</sub>''(''t'')}}, we could in principle find an exact (i.e., non-perturbative) solution. This is easily done when there are only two energy levels ({{mvar|n}} = 1, 2), and this solution is useful for modelling systems like the [[ammonia]] molecule.\n\nHowever, exact solutions are difficult to find when there are many energy levels, and one instead looks for perturbative solutions.  These may be obtained by expressing the equations in an integral form,\n:<math> c_n(t) = c_n(0) + \\frac{-i}{\\hbar} \\sum_k \\int_0^t dt' \\;\\lang n|V(t')|k\\rang \\,c_k(t')\\, e^{-i(E_k - E_n)t'/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nRepeatedly substituting this expression for {{mvar|c<sub>n</sub>}} back into right hand side, yields an iterative solution,\n:<math>c_n(t) = c_n^{(0)} + c_n^{(1)} + c_n^{(2)} + \\cdots</math>\nwhere, for example, the first-order term is\n:<math>c_n^{(1)}(t) = \\frac{-i}{\\hbar} \\sum_k \\int_0^t dt' \\;\\lang n|V(t')|k\\rang \\, c_k^{(0)} \\, e^{-i(E_k - E_n)t'/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nSeveral further results follow from this, such as [[Fermi's golden rule]], which relates the rate of transitions between quantum states to the density of states at particular energies; or the [[Dyson series]], obtained by applying the iterative method to the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|time evolution operator]], which is one of the starting points for the method of [[Feynman diagram]]s.\n\n=== Method of Dyson series ===\nTime-dependent perturbations can be reorganized through the technique of the [[Dyson series]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]]\n:<math>H(t)|\\psi(t)\\rangle=i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial |\\psi(t)\\rangle}{\\partial t}</math>\nhas the formal solution\n:<math>|\\psi(t)\\rangle = T\\exp{\\left[-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^t dt'H(t')\\right]}|\\psi(t_0)\\rangle ~,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|T}} is the time ordering operator,\n:<math>TA(t_1)A(t_2)= \\begin{cases} A(t_1)A(t_2) & t_1>t_2 \\\\ A(t_2)A(t_1) & t_2>t_1\\end{cases}~.</math>\nThus, the exponential represents the following [[Dyson series]],\n:<math>|\\psi(t)\\rangle=\\left[1-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1H(t_1)-\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2H(t_1)H(t_2)+\\ldots\\right]|\\psi(t_0)\\rangle  ~.</math>\nNote that in the second term, the 1/2! factor exactly cancels the double contribution due to the time-ordering operator, etc.\n\nConsider the following perturbation problem\n:<math>[H_0+\\lambda V(t)]|\\psi(t)\\rangle=i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial |\\psi(t)\\rangle}{\\partial t}   ~,</math>\nassuming that the parameter {{mvar|λ}} is small and that  the problem <math>H_0|n\\rangle=E_n|n\\rangle </math> has been solved.\n\nPerform the following unitary transformation to the [[interaction picture]] (or Dirac picture),\n:<math>|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t-t_0)}|\\psi_I(t)\\rangle ~.</math>\nConsequently, the [[Schrödinger equation]]  simplifies to\n:<math>\\lambda e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t-t_0)}V(t)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t-t_0)}|\\psi_I(t)\\rangle=i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial |\\psi_I(t)\\rangle}{\\partial t} ~,</math>\nso it is solved through the above [[Dyson series]],\n:<math>|\\psi_I(t)\\rangle=\\left[1-\\frac{i\\lambda}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1 e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)}V(t_1)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)}-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\hbar^2}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)}V(t_1)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)} e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_2-t_0)}V(t_2)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_2-t_0)}+\\ldots\\right]|\\psi(t_0)\\rangle ~,</math>\nas a perturbation series with small {{mvar|λ}}.\n\nUsing the solution of the unperturbed problem <math>H_0|n\\rangle=E_n|n\\rangle</math> and <math>\\sum_n|n\\rangle\\langle n|=1</math> (for the sake of simplicity assume a pure discrete spectrum),  yields, to first order,\n:<math>|\\psi_I(t)\\rangle=\\left[1-\\frac{i\\lambda}{\\hbar}\\sum_m\\sum_n\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1\\langle m|V(t_1)| n\\rangle e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(E_n-E_m)(t_1-t_0)}|m\\rangle\\langle n|+\\ldots\\right]|\\psi(t_0)\\rangle~.</math>\n\nThus, the system, initially in the unperturbed state <math>|\\alpha\\rangle = |\\psi(t_0)\\rangle</math>,  by dint of the perturbation can go into the state <math>|\\beta\\rangle </math>. The corresponding transition probability amplitude to first order is\n:<math>A_{\\alpha\\beta}=-\\frac{i\\lambda}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1\\langle\\beta|V(t_1)|\\alpha\\rangle e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(E_\\alpha-E_\\beta)(t_1-t_0)} ~,</math>\nas detailed in the previous section——while the corresponding transition probability to a continuum is  furnished by [[Fermi's golden rule]].\n\nAs an aside, note that time-independent perturbation theory is also organized inside this time-dependent perturbation theory Dyson series. To see this, write the unitary evolution operator, obtained from the above [[Dyson series]], as\n:<math>U(t)=1-\\frac{i\\lambda}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1 e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)}V(t_1)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)}-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\hbar^2}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)}V(t_1)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_1-t_0)} e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_2-t_0)}V(t_2)e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_0(t_2-t_0)}+\\cdots</math>\nand take the perturbation {{mvar|V}} to be time-independent.\n\nUsing the identity resolution\n:<math>\\sum_n|n\\rangle\\langle n|=1</math>\nwith <math>H_0|n\\rangle=E_n|n\\rangle</math> for a pure discrete spectrum,  write\n:<math>\\begin{align}U(t)= 1 &- \\left \\{ \\frac{i\\lambda}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1 \\sum_m\\sum_n\\langle m|V|n\\rangle e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(E_n-E_m)(t_1-t_0)}|m\\rangle\\langle n| \\right \\} \\\\\n&- \\left \\{\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\hbar^2}\\int_{t_0}^t dt_1\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2\\sum_m\\sum_n\\sum_q e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(E_n-E_m)(t_1-t_0)}\\langle m|V|n\\rangle  \\langle n|V|q\\rangle e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(E_q-E_n)(t_2-t_0)}|m\\rangle\\langle q| \\right \\}+\\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is evident that, at second order,  one must sum on all the intermediate states. Assume <math>t_0=0</math> and the asymptotic limit of larger times. This means that, at each contribution of the perturbation series, one has  to add a multiplicative factor <math>e^{-\\epsilon t}</math> in the integrands for {{mvar|ε}} arbitrarily small. Thus the limit {{math|''t'' → ∞}} gives back the final state of the system by eliminating all oscillating terms, but keeping the secular ones.  The integrals are thus computable, and, separating the diagonal terms from the others yields\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU(t)=1 &-\\frac{i\\lambda}{\\hbar}\\sum_n\\langle n|V|n\\rangle t-\\frac{i\\lambda^2}{\\hbar}\\sum_{m\\neq n}\\frac{\\langle n|V|m\\rangle\\langle m|V|n\\rangle}{E_n-E_m}t-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\hbar^2}\\sum_{m,n}\\langle n|V|m\\rangle\\langle m|V|n\\rangle t^2+\\ldots \\\\\n&+\\lambda\\sum_{m\\neq n}\\frac{\\langle m|V|n\\rangle}{E_n-E_m}|m\\rangle\\langle n|\n+\\lambda^2\\sum_{m\\neq n}\\sum_{q\\neq n}\\sum_n\\frac{\\langle m|V|n\\rangle\\langle n|V|q\\rangle}{(E_n-E_m)(E_q-E_n)}|m\\rangle\\langle q|+\\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere the time secular series yields the eigenvalues of the perturbed problem specified above, recursively; whereas the remaining time-constant part yields the corrections to the stationary eigenfunctions also given above (<math>|n(\\lambda)\\rangle= U(0; \\lambda)|n\\rangle )</math>.)\n\nThe unitary evolution operator is applicable to  arbitrary eigenstates of the unperturbed problem and, in this case, yields a secular series that holds at small times.\n\n== Strong perturbation theory ==\nIn a similar way as for small perturbations, it is possible to develop a strong perturbation theory. Consider as usual the [[Schrödinger equation]]\n\n:<math>H(t)|\\psi(t)\\rangle=i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial |\\psi(t)\\rangle}{\\partial t}</math>\n\nand we consider the question if a dual Dyson series exists that applies in the limit of a perturbation increasingly large.

But we know that in this case we can use the [[adiabatic approximation]]. When <math>V(t)</math> does not depend on time one gets the [[Wigner-Kirkwood series]] that is often used in [[statistical mechanics]]. Indeed, in this case we introduce the unitary transformation\n\n:<math>|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\lambda V(t-t_0)}|\\psi_F(t)\\rangle</math>\n\nthat defines a '''free picture''' as we are trying to eliminate the interaction term.

The reason is that we have obtained this series simply interchanging {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{mvar|V}} and we can go from one to another applying this exchange. This is called '''duality principle''' in perturbation theory. The choice <math>H_0=p^2/2m</math> yields, as already said, a [[Wigner-Kirkwood series]] that is a gradient expansion.

      "text": "{{short description|A formula that describes the transition rate from one energy eigenstate of a quantum system into other energy eigenstates}}\nIn [[quantum physics]], '''Fermi's golden rule''' is a formula that describes the transition rate (probability of transition per unit time) from one energy [[eigenstate]] of a quantum system to a group of energy eigenstates in a continuum, as a result of a weak [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]]. This transition rate is effectively independent of time (so long as the strength of the perturbation is independent of time) and is proportional to the strength of the coupling between the initial and final states of the system (described by the square of the [[Matrix element (physics)|matrix element]] of the perturbation) as well as the [[density of states]]. It is also applicable when the final state is not part of a continuum if there is some [[decoherence]] in the process, like relaxation of the atoms or like noise in the perturbation, in which case the density of states is replaced by the reciprocal of decoherence bandwidth.\n\n==General==\nAlthough named after [[Enrico Fermi]], most of the work leading to the Golden Rule is due to [[Paul Dirac]] who formulated 20 years earlier a virtually identical equation, including the three components of a constant, the matrix element of the perturbation and an energy difference.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bransden|first1=B.

If {{mvar| H'}} is time-independent, the system goes only into those states in the continuum that have the same energy as the initial state. If {{mvar| H'}} is oscillating sinusoidally as a function of time (i.e. it is a harmonic perturbation) with an [[angular frequency]] {{mvar|ω}}, the transition is into states with energies that differ by {{math|  ''ħω''}} from the energy of the initial state.\n\nIn both cases, the ''transition probability per unit of time'' from the initial state <math> | i \\rangle</math> to a set of final states <math>| f\\rangle</math> is essentially constant. It is given, to first order approximation, by\n::<math> \\Gamma_{i \\rightarrow f}= \\frac{2 \\pi} {\\hbar}  \\left | \\langle f|H'|i  \\rangle \\right |^{2} \\rho(E_{f})</math>\nwhere <math> \\langle f|H'|i  \\rangle </math> is the [[Matrix element (physics)|matrix element]] (in [[bra–ket notation]]) of the perturbation {{mvar| H'}} between the final and initial states and <math>\\rho(E_{f})</math> is the [[density of states]] (number of continuum states in an infinitesimally small energy interval <math>E + dE</math> ) at the energy <math>E_{f}</math> of the final states. This transition probability is also called \"decay probability\" and is related to the inverse of the [[Exponential decay#Mean lifetime|mean lifetime]]. Thus, the probability of finding the system in state <math> |f \\rangle </math> is proportional to <math> e^{-\\Gamma_{i\\rightarrow f} t} </math>.\n\nThe standard way to derive the equation is to start with time-dependent perturbation theory and to take the limit for absorption under the assumption that the time of the measurement is much larger than the time needed for the transition.<ref>[http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~schwitte/PHY362L/QMnote.pdf R Schwitters' UT Notes on Derivation]</ref><ref>It is remarkable in that the rate is ''constant'' and not linearly increasing in time, as might be naively expected for transitions with strict conservation of energy enforced.

      "text": "{{Distinguish|Laplace smoothing}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Laplace's method''', named after [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is a technique used to approximate [[integral]]s of the form\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b e^{Mf(x)} \\, dx,</math>\n\nwhere <math>f(x)</math> is a twice-[[Derivative|differentiable]] [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''M'' is a large number, and the endpoints ''a'' and ''b'' could possibly be infinite. This technique was originally presented in Laplace (1774, pp.&nbsp;366–367).\n\n==The idea of Laplace's method==\n[[File:Laplaces method.svg|right|150px|thumb| <math>f(x) = \\tfrac{\\sin(x)}{x}</math> has a global maximum at 0. <math>e^{Mf(x)}</math> is shown on top for ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5, and at the bottom for ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 (both in blue). As ''M'' grows the approximation of this function by a [[Gaussian function]] (shown in red) improves. This observation underlies Laplace's method.]]\n\nSuppose the function <math>f(x)</math> has a unique [[Maxima and minima|global maximum]] at ''x''<sub>0</sub>. Let ''M'' be a constant and consider the following two functions:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ng(x) &= Mf(x) \\\\\nh(x) &= e^{Mf(x)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote that ''x''<sub>0</sub> will be the global maximum of <math>g</math> and <math>h</math> as well. Now observe:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{g(x_0)}{g(x)} &= \\frac{M f(x_0)}{M f(x)} = \\frac{f(x_0)}{f(x)} \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac{h(x_0)}{h(x)} &= \\frac{e^{M f(x_0)}}{e^{M f(x)}} = e^{M(f(x_0) - f(x))}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs ''M'' the ratio for <math>h</math> will grow exponentially while the ratio for <math>g</math> does not change. Thus, significant contributions to the integral of this function will come only from points ''x'' in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x''<sub>0</sub>, which can then be estimated.\n\n==General theory of Laplace's method==\nTo state and motivate the method, we need several assumptions. We will assume that ''x''<sub>0</sub> is not an endpoint of the interval of integration, that the values <math>f(x)</math> cannot be very close to <math>f(x_0)</math> unless ''x'' is close to ''x''<sub>0</sub>, and that <math>f''(x_0)<0.</math>\n\nWe can expand <math>f(x)</math> around ''x''<sub>0</sub> by [[Taylor's theorem]],\n\n:<math>f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} f''(x_0)(x-x_0)^2 + R</math>\n\nwhere <math>R = O\\left((x-x_0)^3\\right)</math> (see: [[big O notation]]).\n\nSince <math>f</math> has a global maximum at ''x''<sub>0</sub>, and since ''x''<sub>0</sub> is not an endpoint, it is a [[stationary point]], so the derivative of <math>f</math> vanishes at ''x''<sub>0</sub>. Therefore, the function <math>f(x)</math> may be approximated to quadratic order\n\n:<math>f(x) \\approx f(x_0) - \\frac{1}{2} \\left|f''(x_0)\\right| (x-x_0)^2</math>\n\nfor ''x'' close to ''x''<sub>0</sub> (recall <math>f''(x_0)<0</math>). The assumptions ensure the accuracy of the approximation\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b e^{M f(x)}\\, dx\\approx e^{M f(x_0)}\\int_a^b e^{-\\frac{1}{2} M|f''(x_0)| (x-x_0)^2} \\, dx</math>\n\n(see the picture on the right). This latter integral is a [[Gaussian integral]] if the limits of integration go from −∞ to +∞ (which can be assumed because the exponential decays very fast away from ''x''<sub>0</sub>), and thus it can be calculated. We find\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b e^{M f(x)}\\, dx\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{M|f''(x_0)|}}e^{M f(x_0)} \\text { as } M\\to\\infty.</math>\n\nA generalization of this method and extension to arbitrary precision is provided by Fog (2008).\n\n===Formal statement and proof===\n\nSuppose <math>f(x)</math> is a twice continuously differentiable function on <math>[a,b],</math> and there exists a unique point <math>x_0 \\in (a,b)</math> such that: \n\n:<math>f(x_0) = \\max_{x \\in [a,b]} f(x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f''(x_0)<0.</math> \n\nThen:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n\\left(-f''(x_0)\\right)}}}= 1. </math>\n\n{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title={{center|Proof}}}}\n'''Lower bound:''' Let <math>\\varepsilon > 0</math>.

Again we start by picking an <math>\\varepsilon >0</math> but in order for the proof to work we need <math>\\varepsilon</math> small enough so that <math>f''(x_0) + \\varepsilon < 0.</math> Then, as above, by continuity of <math>f''</math> and [[Taylor's Theorem]] we can find <math>\\delta>0</math> so that if <math>|x-x_0| < \\delta</math>, then \n\n:<math>f(x) \\le f(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (f''(x_0) + \\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2.</math>\n\nLastly, by our assumptions (assuming <math>a,b</math> are finite) there exists an <math>\\eta >0</math> such that if <math>|x-x_0|\\ge \\delta</math>, then <math>f(x) \\le f(x_0) - \\eta</math>.\n\nThen we can calculate the following upper bound:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx &\\le \\int_a^{x_0-\\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\, dx + \\int_{x_0-\\delta}^{x_0 + \\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\, dx + \\int_{x_0 + \\delta}^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx \\\\\n&\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\eta)} + \\int_{x_0-\\delta}^{x_0 + \\delta} e^{n f(x) } \\, dx \\\\\n&\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\eta)} + e^{nf(x_0)} \\int_{x_0-\\delta}^{x_0 + \\delta} e^{\\frac{n}{2}(f''(x_0)+\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \\, dx\\\\\n&\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\eta)} + e^{nf(x_0)} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} e^{\\frac{n}{2}(f''(x_0)+\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \\, dx \\\\\n&\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\eta)} + e^{nf(x_0)} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi}{n (-f''(x_0) - \\varepsilon)}}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf we divide both sides of the above inequality by \n\n:<math>e^{nf(x_0)}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}}</math> \n\nand take the limit we get:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n(-f''(x_0))}}} \\le \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (b-a) e^{-\\eta n} \\sqrt{\\frac{n(-f''(x_0))}{2\\pi}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{-f''(x_0)}{-f''(x_0) - \\varepsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-f''(x_0)}{-f''(x_0) - \\varepsilon}}</math>\n\nSince <math>\\varepsilon</math> is arbitrary we get the upper bound:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}}} \\le 1</math>\n\nAnd combining this with the lower bound gives the result.\n\nNote that the above proof obviously fails when <math>a = -\\infty</math> or <math>b = \\infty</math> (or both). To deal with these cases, we need some extra assumptions. A sufficient (not necessary) assumption is that for <math>n = 1,</math> \n\n:<math>\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx < \\infty,</math> \n\nand that the number <math>\\eta</math> as above exists (note that this must be an assumption in the case when the interval <math>[a,b]</math> is infinite). The proof proceeds otherwise as above, but with a s lightly different approximation of integrals:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^{x_0-\\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\, dx + \\int_{x_0 + \\delta}^b e^{nf(x)} \\, dx \\le \\int_a^b e^{f(x)}e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \\eta)} \\, dx = e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \\eta)} \\int_a^b e^{f(x)} \\, dx.</math>\n\nWhen we divide by \n\n:<math>e^{nf(x_0)}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n(-f''(x_0))}},</math>\n\nwe get for this term\n\n:<math>\\frac{e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \\eta)} \\int_a^b e^{f(x)} \\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n(-f''(x_0))}}} = e^{-(n-1)\\eta} \\sqrt{n} e^{-f(x_0)} \\int_a^b e^{f(x)} \\, dx \\sqrt{\\frac{-f''(x_0)}{2\\pi}}</math>\n\nwhose limit as <math>n \\to \\infty</math> is <math>0</math>. The rest of the proof (the analysis of the interesting term) proceeds as above.\n\nThe given condition in the infinite interval case is, as said above, sufficient but not necessary. However, the condition is fulfilled in many, if not in most, applications: the condition simply says that the integral we are studying must be well-defined (not infinite) and that the maximum of the function at <math>x_0</math> must be a \"true\" maximum (the number <math>\\eta > 0</math> must exist). There is no need to demand that the integral is finite for <math>n=1</math> but it is enough to demand that the integral is finite for some <math>n=N.</math>\n{{hidden end}}\n\nThis method relies on 4 basic concepts such as\n{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title={{center|Concepts}}}}\n:'''1. Relative error'''\nThe “approximation” in this method is related to the [[relative error]] and not the [[absolute error]]. Therefore, if we set\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{M\\left|f''(x_0)\\right|}}.</math>\n\nthe integral can be written as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \n\\int_a^b e^{M f(x)} \\, dx &= se^{Mf(x_0)} \\frac{1}{s}\\int_a^b e^{M(f(x)-f(x_0))}\\, dx \\\\ \n& = se^{Mf(x_0)} \\int_{\\frac{a-x_0}{s}}^{\\frac{b-x_0}{s}} e^{M(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))}\\,dy \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>s</math> is a small number when <math>M</math> is a large number obviously and the relative error will be\n \n:<math>\\left| \\int_{\\frac{a-x_0}{s}}^{\\frac{b-x_0}{s}} e^{M(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))} dy-1 \\right|.</math>\n\nNow, let us separate this integral into two parts: <math>y\\in[-D_y,D_y]</math> region and the rest.\n\n:'''2. <math>e^{M (f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))} \\to e^{-\\pi y^2}</math> around the [[stationary point]] when <math>M</math> is large enough'''\n\nLet’s look at the [[Taylor expansion]] of <math>M(f(x)-f(x_0))</math> around ''x''<sub>0</sub> and translate ''x'' to ''y'' because we do the comparison in y-space, we will get\n\n:<math>M(f(x)-f(x_0)) = \\frac{Mf''(x_0)}{2}s^2y^2 +\\frac{Mf'''(x_0)}{6}s^3y^3+ \\cdots = -\\pi y^2 +O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}\\right).</math>\n\nNote that <math>f'(x_0)=0</math> because <math>x_0</math> is a stationary point. From this equation you will find that the terms higher than second derivative in this Taylor expansion is suppressed as the order of <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}</math> so that <math>\\exp(M(f(x)-f(x_0)))</math> will get closer to the [[Gaussian function]] as shown in figure. Besides,\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\pi y^2} dy =1.</math>\n\n[[File:For laplace method --- with different M.png|thumb|The figure of <math>e^{M[f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0)]}</math> with <math>M</math> equals 1, 2 and 3, and the red line is the curve of function <math>e^{-\\pi y^2}</math> .]]\n\n:'''3.

If the integral in Laplace’s method converges, the contribution of the region which is not around the stationary point of the integration of its relative error will tend to zero as <math>M</math> grows.'''\n\nRelying on the 3rd concept, even if we choose a very large ''D<sub>y</sub>'', ''sD<sub>y</sub>'' will finally be a very small number when <math>M</math> is increased to a huge number. Then, how can we guarantee the integral of the rest will tend to 0 when <math>M</math> is large enough?\n\nThe basic idea is to find a function <math>m(x)</math> such that <math>m(x)\\ge f(x)</math> and the integral of <math>e^{Mm(x)}</math> will tend to zero when <math>M</math> grows. Because the exponential function of <math>Mm(x)</math> will be always larger than zero as long as <math>m(x)</math> is a real number, and this exponential function is proportional to <math>m(x),</math> the integral of <math>e^{Mf(x)}</math> will tend to zero. For simplicity, choose <math>m(x)</math> as a [[tangent]] through the point <math>x=sD_y</math> as shown in the figure:\n\n[[File:For laplace method --- upper limit function m(x).gif|thumb| <math>m(x)</math> is denoted by the two [[tangent]] lines passing through <math>x=\\pm sD_y+x_0</math>. When <math>sD_y</math> gets smaller, the cover region will be larger. ]]\n\nIf the interval of the integration of this method is finite, we will find that no matter <math>f(x)</math> is continue in the rest region, it will be always smaller than <math>m(x)</math> shown above when <math>M</math> is large enough. By the way, it will be proved later that the integral of <math>e^{Mm(x)}</math> will tend to zero when <math>M</math> is large enough.\n\nIf the interval of the integration of this method is infinite, <math>m(x)</math> and <math>f(x)</math> might always cross to each other. If so, we cannot guarantee that the integral of <math>e^{Mf(x)}</math> will tend to zero finally. For example, in the case of <math>f(x)=\\tfrac{\\sin(x)}{x},</math> <math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0}e^{Mf(x)} dx</math> will always diverge. Therefore, we need to require that <math>\\int^{\\infty}_{d}e^{Mf(x)} dx</math> can converge for the infinite interval case. If so, this integral will tend to zero when <math>d</math> is large enough and we can choose this <math>d</math> as the cross of <math>m(x)</math> and <math>f(x).</math>\n\nYou might ask that why not choose <math>\\int^{\\infty}_{d}e^{f(x)} dx</math> as a convergent integral? Let me use an example to show you the reason. Suppose the rest part of <math>f(x)</math> is <math>-\\ln x,</math> then <math>e^{f(x)}=\\tfrac{1}{x}</math> and its integral will diverge; however, when <math>M=2,</math> the integral of <math>e^{Mf(x)}=\\tfrac{1}{x^2}</math> converges. So, the integral of some functions will diverge when <math>M</math> is not a large number, but they will converge when <math>M</math> is large enough.\n{{hidden end}}\n\nBased on these four concepts, we can derive the relative error of this Laplace's method.\n\n==Other formulations==\nLaplace's approximation is sometimes written as\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b h(x) e^{M g(x)}\\, dx \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{M|g''(x_0)|}} h(x_0) e^{M g(x_0)} \\ \\text { as } M\\to\\infty</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is positive.\n\nImportantly, the accuracy of the approximation depends on the variable of integration, that is, on what stays in <math>g(x)</math> and what goes into <math>h(x)</math>.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Ronald W |date=2007 |title=Saddlepoint approximations and applications |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87250-8}}</ref>\n\n{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|title={{center|The derivation of its relative error}}}}\nFirst of all, let me set the global maximum is located at <math>x_0=0</math> which can simplify the derivation and does not lost any important information; therefore, all the derivation inside this sub-section is under this assumption.

Therefore,\n\n:<math>|R| < \\underbrace{\\left| \\int_{D_y}^{\\infty}A_0 dy \\right|}_{(a_1)} + \\underbrace{\\left| \\int_{D_y}^{b/s}A dy \\right|}_{(b_1)}+ \\underbrace{\\left| \\int_{-D_y}^{D_y}\\left(A-A_0\\right) dy \\right|}_{(c)} + \\underbrace{\\left| \\int_{a/s}^{-D_y}A dy \\right|}_{(b_2)} + \\underbrace{\\left| \\int_{-\\infty}^{-D_y}A_0 dy \\right|}_{(a_2)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>(a_1)</math> and <math>(a_2)</math> are similar, let us just calculate <math>(a_1)</math> and <math>(b_1)</math> and <math>(b_2)</math> are similar, too, I’ll just calculate <math>(b_1)</math>.\n\nFor <math>(a_1)</math>, after the translation of <math>z\\equiv\\pi y^2</math>, we can get\n\n:<math>(a_1) = \\left| \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_{\\pi D_y^2}^{\\infty} e^{-z}z^{-1/2} dz\\right| <\\frac{e^{-\\pi D_y^2}}{2\\pi D_y}.</math>\n\nThis means that as long as <math>D_y</math> is large enough, it will tend to zero.\n\nFor <math>(b_1)</math>, we can get\n\n:<math>(b_1)\\le\\left| \\int_{D_y}^{b/s}\\left[\\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)}\\right]_{\\text{max}} e^{Mm(sy)}dy \\right|</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>m(x) \\ge g(x)-g(0) \\text{as} x\\in [sD_y,b]</math>\n\nand <math>h(x)</math> should have the same sign of <math>h(0)</math> during this region. Let us choose <math>m(x)</math> as the tangent across the point at <math>x=sD_y</math> , i.e. <math>m(sy)= g(sD_y)-g(0) +g'(sD_y)\\left( sy-sD_y \\right)</math> which is shown in the figure\n\n[[File:For laplace method --- upper limit function m(x).gif|thumb|<math>m(x)</math> is the tangent lines across the point at <math>x=sD_y</math> .]]\n\nFrom this figure you can find that when <math>s</math> or <math>D_y</math> gets smaller, the region satisfies the above inequality will get larger. Therefore, if we want to find a suitable <math>m(x)</math> to cover the whole <math>f(x)</math> during the interval of <math>(b_1)</math>, <math>D_y</math> will have an upper limit. Besides, because the integration of <math>e^{-\\alpha x}</math> is simple, let me use it to estimate the relative error contributed by this <math>(b_1)</math>.\n\nBased on Taylor expansion, we can get\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nM\\left[g(sD_y)-g(0)\\right] &= M\\left[ \\frac{g''(0)}{2}s^2D_y^2 +\\frac{g'''(\\xi)}{6}s^3D_y^3 \\right] && \\text{as } \\xi\\in[0,sD_y] \\\\\n& = -\\pi D_y^2 +\\frac{(2\\pi)^{3/2}g'''(\\xi)D_y^3}{6\\sqrt{M}|g''(0)|^{\\frac{3}{2}}},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nMsg'(sD_y) &= Ms\\left(g''(0)sD_y +\\frac{g'''(\\zeta)}{2}s^2D_y^2\\right) && \\text{as } \\zeta\\in[0,sD_y] \\\\\n &= -2\\pi D_y +\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{M}}\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{|g''(0)|} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}g'''(\\zeta)D_y^2,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand then substitute them back into the calculation of <math>(b_1)</math>; however, you can find that the remainders of these two expansions are both inversely proportional to the square root of <math>M</math>, let me drop them out to beautify the calculation. Keeping them is better, but it will make the formula uglier.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(b_1) &\\le \\left|\\left[ \\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)} \\right]_{\\max} e^{-\\pi D_y^2}\\int_0^{b/s-D_y}e^{-2\\pi D_y y} dy \\right| \\\\\n &\\le \\left|\\left[ \\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)} \\right]_{\\max} e^{-\\pi D_y^2}\\frac{1}{2\\pi D_y} \\right|.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, it will tend to zero when <math>D_y</math> gets larger, but don't forget that the upper bound of <math>D_y</math> should be considered during this calculation.\n\nAbout the integration near <math>x=0</math>, we can also use [[Taylor's Theorem]] to calculate it. When <math>h'(0) \\ne 0</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(c) &\\le \\int_{-D_y}^{D_y} e^{-\\pi y^2} \\left| \\frac{sh'(\\xi)}{h(0)}y \\right|\\, dy \\\\\n &< \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi M |g''(0)|}} \\left| \\frac{h'(\\xi)}{h(0)} \\right|_\\max \\left( 1-e^{-\\pi D_y^2} \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand you can find that it is inversely proportional to the square root of <math>M</math>. In fact, <math>(c)</math> will have the same behave when <math>h(x)</math> is a constant.\n\nConclusively, the integral near the stationary point will get smaller as <math>\\sqrt{M}</math> gets larger, and the rest parts will tend to zero as long as <math>D_y</math> is large enough; however, we need to remember that <math>D_y</math> has an upper limit which is decided by whether the function <math>m(x)</math> is always larger than <math>g(x)-g(0)</math> in the rest region. However, as long as we can find one <math>m(x)</math> satisfying this condition, the upper bound of <math>D_y</math> can be chosen as directly proportional to <math>\\sqrt{M}</math> since <math>m(x)</math> is a tangent across the point of <math>g(x)-g(0)</math> at <math>x=sD_y</math>. So, the bigger <math>M</math> is, the bigger <math>D_y</math> can be.\n{{hidden end}}\n\nIn the multivariate case where <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> is a <math>d</math>-dimensional vector and <math>f(\\mathbf{x})</math> is a scalar function of <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, Laplace's approximation is usually written as:\n\n:<math>\\int e^{M f(\\mathbf{x})}\\, d\\mathbf{x} \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{M}\\right)^{d/2} \\frac{e^{M f(\\mathbf{x}_0)}}{\\left|-H(f)(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\right|^{1/2}} \\text { as } M\\to\\infty</math>\n\nwhere <math>H(f)(\\mathbf{x}_0)</math> is the [[Hessian matrix]] of <math>f</math> evaluated at <math>\\mathbf{x}_0</math> and where <math>|\\cdot|</math> denotes [[matrix determinant]].

In particular, if no point ''x''<sub>0</sub> where the derivative of <math>f</math> vanishes exists on the real line, it may be necessary to deform the integration contour to an optimal one, where the above analysis will be possible. Again the main idea is to reduce, at least asymptotically, the calculation of the given integral to that of a simpler integral that can be explicitly evaluated. See the book of Erdelyi (1956) for a simple discussion (where the method is termed ''steepest descents'').\n\nThe appropriate formulation for the complex ''z''-plane is\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b e^{M f(z)}\\, dz \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{-Mf''(z_0)}}e^{M f(z_0)} \\text{ as } M\\to\\infty.</math>\n\nfor a path passing through the saddle point at ''z''<sub>0</sub>. Note the explicit appearance of a minus sign to indicate the direction of the second derivative: one must ''not'' take the modulus. Also note that if the integrand is [[meromorphic]], one may have to add residues corresponding to poles traversed while deforming the contour (see for example section 3 of Okounkov's paper ''Symmetric functions and random partitions'').\n\n==Further generalizations==\nAn extension of the steepest descent method is the so-called ''nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method''. Here, instead of integrals, one needs to evaluate asymptotically solutions of [[Riemann–Hilbert problem|Riemann–Hilbert factorization problem]]s.\n\nGiven a contour ''C'' in the [[complex sphere]], a function <math>f</math> defined on that contour and a special point, say infinity, one seeks a function ''M'' holomorphic away from the contour ''C'', with prescribed jump across ''C'', and with a given normalization at infinity. If <math>f</math> and hence ''M'' are matrices rather than scalars this is a problem that in general does not admit an explicit solution.\n\nAn asymptotic evaluation is then possible along the lines of the linear stationary phase/steepest descent method. The idea is to reduce asymptotically the solution of the given Riemann–Hilbert problem to that of a simpler, explicitly solvable, Riemann–Hilbert problem. Cauchy's theorem is used to justify deformations of the jump contour.\n\nThe nonlinear stationary phase was introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993, based on earlier work of Its. A (properly speaking) nonlinear steepest descent method was introduced by Kamvissis, K. McLaughlin and P. Miller in 2003, based on previous work of Lax, Levermore, Deift, Venakides and Zhou. As in the linear case, \"steepest descent contours\" solve a min-max problem. In the nonlinear case they turn out to be \"S-curves\" (defined in a different context back in the 80s by Stahl, Gonchar and Rakhmanov).\n\nThe nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method has applications to the theory of soliton equations and [[integrable model]]s, [[random matrices]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n==Complex integrals==\nFor complex integrals in the form:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} g(s)e^{st} \\,ds</math>\n\nwith <math>t \\gg 1,</math> we make the substitution ''t'' = ''iu'' and the change of variable <math>s=c+ix</math> to get the bilateral Laplace transform:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(c+ix)e^{-ux}e^{icu} \\, dx.</math>\n\nWe then split ''g''(''c'' + ''ix'') in its real and complex part, after which we recover ''u'' = ''t''/''i''. This is useful for [[inverse Laplace transform]]s, the [[Perron formula]] and complex integration.\n\n==Example 1: Stirling's approximation==\nLaplace's method can be used to derive [[Stirling's approximation]]\n\n:<math>N!\\approx \\sqrt{2\\pi N} N^N e^{-N}\\,</math>\n\nfor a large [[integer]]&nbsp;''N''.\n\nFrom the definition of the [[Gamma function]], we have\n\n:<math>N! = \\Gamma(N+1)=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} x^N \\, dx.</math>\n\nNow we change variables, letting <math>x=Nz</math> so that <math>dx = Ndz.</math> Plug these values back in to obtain\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nN! &= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-Nz} (Nz)^N N \\, dz \\\\\n   &= N^{N+1} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-Nz} z^N \\, dz \\\\\n   &= N^{N+1} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-Nz} e^{N\\ln z} \\, dz \\\\\n   &= N^{N+1} \\int_0^\\infty e^{N(\\ln z-z)} \\, dz.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis integral has the form necessary for Laplace's method with\n\n:<math>f(z) = \\ln{z}-z</math>\n\nwhich is twice-differentiable:\n\n:<math>f'(z) = \\frac{1}{z}-1,</math>\n:<math>f''(z) = -\\frac{1}{z^2}.</math>\n\nThe maximum of <math>f(z)</math> lies at ''z''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and the second derivative of <math>f(z)</math> has the value&nbsp;−1 at this point.

The saddle-point approximation is used with integrals in the complex plane, whereas Laplace’s method is used with real integrals.\n\nThe integral to be estimated is often of the form\n:<math>\\int_Cf(z)e^{\\lambda g(z)}\\,dz,</math>\nwhere ''C'' is a contour, and λ is large.

Here, the catastrophe theory replaces the [[Method of steepest descent#Complex Morse Lemma|Morse lemma]], valid only in the non-degenerate case, to transform the function {{math|''S''(''z'')}} into one of the multitude of canonical representations. For further details see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Poston|Stewart|1978}} and {{harvtxt|Fedoryuk|1987}}.\n\nIntegrals with degenerate saddle points naturally appear in many applications including [[Caustic (optics)|optical caustics]] and the multidimensional [[WKB approximation]] in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe other cases such as, e.g., {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} and/or {{math|''S''(''x'')}} are discontinuous or when an extremum of {{math|''S''(''x'')}} lies at the integration region's boundary, require special care (see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Fedoryuk|1987}} and {{harvtxt|Wong|1989}}).\n\n==Extensions and generalizations==\nAn extension of the steepest descent method is the so-called ''nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method''. Here, instead of integrals, one needs to evaluate asymptotically solutions of [[Riemann&ndash;Hilbert factorization]] problems.\n\nGiven a contour ''C'' in the [[complex sphere]], a function ''f'' defined on that contour and a special point, say infinity, one seeks a function ''M'' holomorphic away from the contour ''C'', with prescribed jump across ''C'', and with a given normalization at infinity. If ''f'' and hence ''M'' are matrices rather than scalars this is a problem that in general does not admit an explicit solution.\n\nAn asymptotic evaluation is then possible along the lines of the linear stationary phase/steepest descent method. The idea is to reduce asymptotically the solution of the given Riemann&ndash;Hilbert problem to that of a simpler, explicitly solvable, Riemann&ndash;Hilbert problem. Cauchy's theorem is used to justify deformations  of the jump contour.\n\nThe nonlinear stationary phase was introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993, based on earlier work of the Russian mathematician Alexander Its. A (properly speaking) nonlinear steepest descent method was introduced by Kamvissis, K. McLaughlin and P. Miller in 2003, based on previous work of Lax, Levermore, Deift, Venakides and Zhou. As in the linear case, steepest descent contours solve a min-max problem. In the nonlinear case they turn out to be \"S-curves\" (defined in a different context back in the 80s by Stahl, Gonchar and Rakhmanov).\n\nThe nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method has applications to the theory of [[soliton]] equations and [[integrable model]]s, [[random matrices]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n==See also==\n[[Pearcey integral]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n | last1=Chaichian\n | first1=M.\n | last2=Demichev\n | first2=A.\n | title=Path Integrals in Physics Volume 1: Stochastic Process and Quantum Mechanics\n | publisher=Taylor & Francis\n | year=2001\n | page=174\n | isbn=075030801X\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last1=Debye\n | first1=P.\n | author1-link=Peter Debye\n | title=Näherungsformeln für die Zylinderfunktionen für große Werte des Arguments und unbeschränkt veränderliche Werte des Index\n | doi=10.1007/BF01450097\n | year=1909\n | journal=Mathematische Annalen\n | volume=67\n | issue=4\n | pages=535–558| url=https://zenodo.org/record/2397260\n }} English translation in {{Citation | last1=Debye | first1=Peter J.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-scale_analysis",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], '''multiple-scale analysis''' (also called the '''method of multiple scales''') comprises techniques used to construct uniformly valid [[approximation]]s to the solutions of [[perturbation theory|perturbation problems]], both for small as well as large values of the [[independent variable]]s. This is done by introducing fast-scale and slow-scale variables for an independent variable, and subsequently treating these variables, fast and slow, as if they are independent. In the solution process of the perturbation problem thereafter, the resulting additional freedom – introduced by the new independent variables – is used to remove (unwanted) [[secular variation|secular terms]]. The latter puts constraints on the approximate solution, which are called '''solvability conditions'''.\n\nMathematics research from about the 1980s proposes that coordinate transforms and invariant manifolds provide a sounder support for multiscale modelling (for example, see [[center manifold]] and [[slow manifold]]).\n\n==Example: undamped Duffing equation==\n===Differential equation and energy conservation===\nAs an example for the method of multiple-scale analysis, consider the undamped and unforced [[Duffing equation]]:<ref>This example is treated in: Bender & Orszag (1999) pp. 545–551.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2} + y + \\varepsilon y^3 = 0,</math> {{pad|3em}} <math>y(0)=1, \\qquad \\frac{dy}{dt}(0)=0,</math>\n\nwhich is a second-order [[ordinary differential equation]] describing a [[nonlinear]] [[oscillator]]. A solution ''y''(''t'') is sought for small values of the (positive) nonlinearity parameter 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''ε''&nbsp;≪&nbsp;1. The undamped Duffing equation is known to be a [[Hamiltonian system]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dp}{dt}=-\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}, \\qquad \\frac{dq}{dt}=+\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}, \\quad \\text{ with } \\quad H = \\tfrac12 p^2 + \\tfrac12 q^2 + \\tfrac14 \\varepsilon q^4,</math>\n\nwith ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''(''t'') and ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''dy''/''dt''. Consequently, the Hamiltonian ''H''(''p'',&nbsp;''q'') is a conserved quantity, a constant, equal to ''H''&nbsp;=&nbsp;½&nbsp;+&nbsp;¼&nbsp;''ε'' for the given [[initial conditions]]. This implies that both ''y'' and ''dy''/''dt'' have to be bounded:\n\n:<math>\\left| y(t) \\right| \\le \\sqrt{1 + \\tfrac12 \\varepsilon} \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad \\left| \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right| \\le \\sqrt{1 + \\tfrac12 \\varepsilon} \\qquad \\text{ for all } t.</math>{{pad|3em}}\n\n===Straightforward perturbation-series solution===\nA regular [[perturbation theory|perturbation-series approach]] to the problem gives the result:\n\n:<math>\n  y(t) = \\cos(t) \n       + \\varepsilon \\left[ \\tfrac{1}{32} \\cos(3t) - \\tfrac{1}{32} \\cos(t) - \\underbrace{\\tfrac38\\, t\\, \\sin(t)}_\\text{secular} \\right] \n       + \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^2).\n</math>\n\nThe last term between the square braces is secular: it grows without bound for large |''t''|. In particular, for <math>t = O(\\epsilon^{-1})</math> this term is ''O''(1) and has the same order of magnitude as the leading-order term. Because the terms have become disordered, the series is no longer an asymptotic expansion of the solution.\n\n===Method of multiple scales===\nTo construct a solution that is valid beyond <math>t = O(\\epsilon^{-1})</math>, the method of ''multiple-scale analysis'' is used. Introduce the slow scale ''t''<sub>1</sub>:\n\n:<math>t_1 = \\varepsilon t\\,</math>\n\nand assume the solution ''y''(''t'') is a perturbation-series solution dependent both on ''t'' and ''t''<sub>1</sub>, treated as:\n\n:<math>y(t) = Y_0(t,t_1) + \\varepsilon Y_1(t,t_1) + \\cdots.</math>\n\nSo:\n\n:<math>\n  \\begin{align}\n    \\frac{dy}{dt} \n      &= \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_0}{\\partial t} + \\frac{dt_1}{dt} \\frac{\\partial Y_0}{\\partial t_1} \\right)  \n       + \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_1}{\\partial t} + \\frac{dt_1}{dt} \\frac{\\partial Y_1}{\\partial t_1} \\right)\n       + \\cdots\n    \\\\\n      &= \\frac{\\partial Y_0}{\\partial t}  \n       + \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_0}{\\partial t_1} + \\frac{\\partial Y_1}{\\partial t} \\right)\n       + \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^2),\n  \\end{align}\n</math>\n\nusing ''dt''<sub>1</sub>/''dt''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ε''. Similarly:\n\n:<math>\n  \\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2} \n    = \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_0}{\\partial t^2} \n    + \\varepsilon \\left( 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_0}{\\partial t\\, \\partial t_1} + \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_1}{\\partial t^2} \\right)\n    + \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^2).\n</math>\n\nThen the zeroth- and first-order problems of the multiple-scales perturbation series for the Duffing equation become:\n\n:<math>\n  \\begin{align}\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_0}{\\partial t^2} + Y_0 &= 0,\n    \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_1}{\\partial t^2} + Y_1 &= - Y_0^3 - 2\\, \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_0}{\\partial t\\, \\partial t_1}.\n  \\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Solution===\nThe zeroth-order problem has the general solution:\n\n:<math>Y_0(t,t_1) = A(t_1)\\, e^{+it} + A^\\ast(t_1)\\, e^{-it},</math>\n\nwith ''A''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) a [[complex-valued amplitude]] to the zeroth-order solution ''Y''<sub>0</sub>(''t'',&nbsp;''t''<sub>1</sub>) and ''i''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;−1.  Now, in the first-order problem the forcing in the [[right hand side]] of the differential equation is\n\n:<math>\\left[ -3\\, A^2\\, A^\\ast - 2\\, i\\, \\frac{dA}{dt_1} \\right]\\, e^{+it} - A^3\\, e^{+3it} + c.c.</math>\n\nwhere ''c.c.'' denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of the preceding terms. The occurrence of ''secular terms'' can be prevented by imposing on the – yet unknown – amplitude ''A''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) the ''solvability condition''\n\n:<math>-3\\, A^2\\, A^\\ast - 2\\, i\\, \\frac{dA}{dt_1} = 0.</math>\n\nThe solution to the solvability condition, also satisfying the initial conditions ''y''(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''dy''/''dt''(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, is:\n\n:<math>A = \\tfrac12\\, \\exp \\left(\\tfrac38\\, i \\, t_1 \\right).</math>\n \nAs a result, the approximate solution by the multiple-scales analysis is\n\n:<math>y(t) = \\cos \\left[ \\left( 1 + \\tfrac38\\, \\varepsilon \\right) t \\right] + \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon),</math>\n\nusing ''t''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''εt'' and valid for ''εt''&nbsp;=&nbsp;O(1). This agrees with the nonlinear [[frequency]] changes found by employing the [[Lindstedt–Poincaré method]].\n\nThis new solution is valid until <math>t = O(\\epsilon^{-2})</math>. Higher-order solutions – using the method of multiple scales – require the introduction of additional slow scales, ''i.e.'': ''t''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ε''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;''t'', ''t''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ε''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;''t'', etc.  However, this introduces possible ambiguities in the perturbation series solution, which require a careful treatment (see {{harvnb|Kevorkian|Cole|1996}}; {{harvnb|Bender|Orszag|1999}}).<ref>Bender & Orszag (1999) p. 551.</ref>\n\n===Coordinate transform to amplitude/phase variables===\n\nAlternatively, modern sound approaches derive these sorts of models using coordinate transforms,<ref>{{citation| first1=C.-H. |last1=Lamarque |first2=C. |last2=Touze |first3=O. |last3=Thomas |title=An upper bound for validity limits of asymptotic analytical approaches based on normal form theory |journal=[[Nonlinear Dynamics (journal)|Nonlinear Dynamics]] |pages=1931–1949|year=2012 |volume=70 |issue=3 |doi=10.1007/s11071-012-0584-y |hdl=10985/7473 }}</ref> as described next.\n\nA solution <math>y\\approx r\\cos\\theta</math> is sought in new coordinates <math>(r,\\theta)</math> where the amplitude <math>r(t)</math> varies slowly and the phase <math>\\theta(t)</math> varies at an almost constant rate, namely <math>d\\theta/dt\\approx 1.</math> Straightforward algebra finds the coordinate transform{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n:<math>y=r\\cos\\theta +\\frac1{32}\\varepsilon r^3\\cos3\\theta +\\frac1{1024}\\varepsilon^2r^5(-21\\cos3\\theta+\\cos5\\theta)+\\mathcal O(\\varepsilon^3)</math>\n\ntransforms Duffing's equation into the pair that the radius is constant <math>dr/dt=0</math> and the phase evolves according to\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}=1 +\\frac38\\varepsilon r^2 -\\frac{15}{256}\\varepsilon^2r^4 +\\mathcal O(\\varepsilon^3).</math>\n\nThat is, Duffing's oscillations are of constant amplitude <math>r</math> but have different frequencies <math>d\\theta/dt</math> depending upon the amplitude.<ref>{{citation |first=A.J. |last=Roberts |title=Modelling emergent dynamics in complex systems |url=http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/modelling.php |accessdate=2013-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nMore difficult examples are better treated using a time-dependent coordinate transform involving complex exponentials (as also invoked in the previous multiple time-scale approach).

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=May 2012}}\nIn mathematics, [[perturbation theory]] works typically by expanding unknown quantity in a [[power series]] in a small parameter.  However, in a '''perturbation problem beyond all orders''', [[flat function|all coefficients of the perturbation expansion vanish]] and the difference between the function and the constant function 0 cannot be detected by a power series.\n\nA simple example is understood by an attempt at trying to expand <math>e^{-1/\\epsilon}</math> in a [[Taylor series]] in <math>\\epsilon > 0</math> about 0. All terms in a naïve Taylor expansion are identically zero. This is because the function <math>e^{-1/z}</math> possesses an [[essential singularity]] at <math>z = 0</math> in the complex <math>z</math>-plane, and therefore the function is most appropriately modeled by a [[Laurent series]] -- a Taylor series has a zero [[radius of convergence]]. Thus, if a physical problem possesses a solution of this nature, possibly in addition to an analytic part that may be modeled by a power series, the perturbative analysis fails to recover the singular part.

      "text": "{{In line citation|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe '''Ritz method''' is a direct method to find an approximate solution for [[boundary value problem]]s.  The method is named after [[Walther Ritz]].\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], a system of particles can be described in terms of an \"energy functional\" or [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which will measure the energy of any proposed configuration of said particles. It turns out that certain privileged configurations are more likely than other configurations, and this has to do with the [[eigenvalue|eigenanalysis]] (\"analysis of characteristics\") of this [[Hamiltonian system]]. Because it is often impossible to analyze all of the infinite configurations of particles to find the one with the least amount of energy, it becomes essential to be able to approximate this Hamiltonian in some way for the purpose of [[numerical analysis|numerical computations]].\n\nThe Ritz method can be used to achieve this goal. In the language of mathematics, it is exactly the [[finite element method]] used to compute the [[eigenvector]]s and [[eigenvalue]]s of a Hamiltonian system.\n\n== Discussion ==\n\nAs with other [[variational method]]s, a [[ansatz|trial wave function]], <math>\\Psi</math>, is tested on the system.  This trial function is selected to meet boundary conditions (and any other physical constraints).  The exact function is not known; the trial function contains one or more adjustable parameters, which are varied to find a lowest energy configuration.\n\nIt can be shown that the ground state energy, <math>E_0</math>, satisfies an inequality:\n\n:<math> E_0 \\le \\frac{\\langle \\Psi | \\hat{H}| \\Psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi | \\Psi \\rangle}. </math>\n\nThat is, the ground-state energy is less than this value.\nThe trial wave-function will always give an expectation value larger than or equal to the ground-energy.\n\nIf the trial wave function is known to be [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the ground state, then it will provide a boundary for the energy of some excited state.\n\nThe Ritz ansatz function is a linear combination of ''N'' known basis functions <math>\\left\\lbrace\\Psi_i\\right\\rbrace</math>, parametrized by unknown coefficients:\n\n:<math> \\Psi = \\sum_{i=1}^N c_i \\Psi_i. </math>\n\nWith a known Hamiltonian, we can write its expected value as\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\left\\langle \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i\\Psi_i \\right| \\hat{H} \\left| \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^Nc_i\\Psi_i \\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle \\left. \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i\\Psi_i \\right| \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^Nc_i\\Psi_i \\right\\rangle} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^N\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^Nc_i^*c_jH_{ij}}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^N\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^Nc_i^*c_jS_{ij}} \\equiv \\frac{A}{B}. </math>\n\nThe basis functions are usually not orthogonal, so that the [[overlap matrix]] '''''S''''' has nonzero nondiagonal elements. Either <math>\\left\\lbrace c_i \\right\\rbrace</math> or <math>\\left\\lbrace c_i^* \\right\\rbrace</math> (the conjugation of the first) can be used to minimize the expectation value. For instance, by making the partial derivatives of <math>\\varepsilon</math> over <math>\\left\\lbrace c_i^* \\right\\rbrace</math> zero, the following equality is obtained for every ''k'' = 1, 2, ..., ''N'':\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial\\varepsilon}{\\partial c_k^*} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^Nc_j(H_{kj}-\\varepsilon S_{kj})}{B} = 0, </math>\n\nwhich leads to a set of ''N'' [[secular equation]]s:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{j=1}^N c_j \\left( H_{kj} - \\varepsilon S_{kj} \\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k = 1,2,\\dots,N. </math>\n\nIn the above equations, energy <math>\\varepsilon</math> and the coefficients <math>\\left\\lbrace c_j \\right\\rbrace</math> are unknown. With respect to '''''c''''', this is a homogeneous set of linear equations, which has a solution when the [[determinant]] of the coefficients to these unknowns is zero:\n\n:<math>\\det \\left( H - \\varepsilon S \\right) = 0, </math>\n\nwhich in turn is true only for ''N'' values of <math>\\varepsilon</math>. Furthermore, since the Hamiltonian is a [[hermitian operator]], the '''''H''''' matrix is also [[hermitian matrix|hermitian]] and the values of <math>\\varepsilon_i</math> will be real. The lowest value among <math>\\varepsilon_i</math> (i=1,2,..,N), <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, will be the best approximation to the ground state for the basis functions used. The remaining ''N-1'' energies are estimates of excited state energies. An approximation for the wave function of state ''i'' can be obtained by finding the coefficients <math>\\left\\lbrace c_j \\right\\rbrace</math> from the corresponding secular equation.\n\n== The relationship with the finite element method ==\n\nIn the language of the finite element method, the matrix <math>H_{kj}</math> is precisely the ''stiffness matrix'' of the Hamiltonian in the piecewise linear element space, and the matrix <math>S_{kj}</math> is the ''mass matrix''.

This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of\nthe two formalisms are identical.\n\nSuppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be <math>| A \\rang</math> and <math>| B \\rang</math>, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field.

Sequence transformations are also commonly used to compute the  [[antilimit]] of a [[divergent series]] numerically, and are used in conjunction with [[extrapolation methods]].\n\n==Overview==\nClassical examples for sequence transformations include the [[binomial transform]], [[Möbius transform]], [[Stirling transform]] and others.\n\n==Definitions==\nFor a given sequence \n\n:<math>S=\\{ s_n \\}_{n\\in\\N},\\,</math>\n\nthe '''transformed sequence''' is \n\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}(S)=S'=\\{ s'_n \\}_{n\\in\\N},\\,</math>\n\nwhere the members of the transformed sequence are usually computed from some finite number of members of the original sequence, i.e.\n\n:<math>s_n' = T(s_n,s_{n+1},\\dots,s_{n+k})</math>\n\nfor some <math>k</math> which often depends on <math>n</math> (cf. e.g. [[Binomial transform]]).

More precisely, the solution cannot be uniformly approximated by an [[asymptotic expansion]]\n\n:<math>\\varphi(x) \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^N \\delta_n(\\varepsilon) \\psi_n(x) \\,</math>\n\nas <math>\\varepsilon \\to 0</math>.

This is in contrast to [[perturbation theory|regular perturbation]] problems, for which a uniform approximation of this form can be obtained. Singularly perturbed problems are generally characterized by dynamics operating on multiple scales. Several classes of singular perturbations are outlined below.\n\nThe term \"singular perturbation\" was \ncoined in the 1940s by [[Kurt Otto Friedrichs]] and [[Wolfgang R. Wasow]].<ref> {{Citation\n | last=Wasow\n  | first=Wolfgang R.\n   | date=1981\n    | title=ON BOUNDARY LAYER PROBLEMS IN THE THEORY OF ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\n     | journal=Mathematics Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Technical Summary Report\n      | volume=2244\n      |page = PDF page 5\n\t |url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA103857}}</ref>\n==Methods of analysis==\nA perturbed problem whose solution can be approximated on the whole problem domain, whether space or time, by a single [[asymptotic expansion]] has a [[Perturbation theory|regular perturbation]]. Most often in applications, an acceptable approximation to a regularly perturbed problem is found by simply replacing the small parameter <math>\\varepsilon</math> by zero everywhere in the problem statement. This corresponds to taking only the first term of the expansion, yielding an approximation that converges, perhaps slowly, to the true solution as <math>\\varepsilon</math> decreases. The solution to a singularly perturbed problem cannot be approximated in this way: As seen in the examples below, a singular perturbation generally occurs when a problem's small parameter multiplies its highest operator. Thus naively taking the parameter to be zero changes the very nature of the problem. In the case of differential equations, boundary conditions cannot be satisfied; in algebraic equations, the possible number of solutions is decreased.\n\nSingular perturbation theory is a rich and ongoing area of exploration for mathematicians, physicists, and other researchers. The methods used to tackle problems in this field are many. The more basic of these include the [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]] and [[WKB approximation]] for spatial problems, and in time, the [[Poincaré-Lindstedt method]], the [[method of multiple scales]] and [[periodic averaging]].\n\nFor books on singular perturbation in ODE and PDE's, see for example Holmes, ''Introduction to Perturbation Methods'',<ref name=holmes>Holmes, Mark H.

Some show how the problem may be solved by more sophisticated singular methods.\n\n=== Vanishing coefficients in ordinary differential equations ===\t \nDifferential equations that contain a small parameter that premultiplies the highest order term typically exhibit boundary layers, so that the solution evolves in two different scales. For example, consider the boundary value problem\n\n:<math>\\begin{matrix} \t \n\\varepsilon u^{\\prime \\prime }(x)+u^{\\prime }(x) =-e^{-x},\\ \\ 0<x<1 \\\\ \t \nu(0) =0,\\ \\ u(1)=1. \t \n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\nIts solution when <math>\\varepsilon=0.1</math> is the solid curve shown below. Note that the solution changes rapidly near the origin. If we naively set <math>\\varepsilon=0</math>, we would get the solution labelled \"outer\" below which does not model the boundary layer, for which ''x'' is close to zero. For more details that show how to obtain the uniformly valid approximation, see [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]].\n<center>[[File:Matching (perturbation).jpg]]</center>\n\n=== Examples in time ===\nAn electrically driven robot manipulator can have slower mechanical dynamics and faster electrical dynamics, thus exhibiting two time scales. In such cases, we can divide the system into two subsystems, one corresponding to faster dynamics and other corresponding to slower dynamics, and then design controllers for each one of them separately. Through a singular perturbation technique, we can make these two subsystems independent of each other, thereby simplifying the control problem.\n\nConsider a class of system described by following set of equations:\n\n:<math>\\dot{x}_1 = f_1(x_1,x_2) + \\varepsilon g_1(x_1,x_2,\\varepsilon), \\,</math>\n:<math>\\varepsilon\\dot{x}_2 = f_2(x_1,x_2) + \\varepsilon g_2(x_1,x_2,\\varepsilon), \\, </math>\n:<math>x_1(0) = a_1, x_2(0) = a_2, \\,</math>\n\nwith <math>0<\\varepsilon <\\!\\!< 1</math>.

Thus the fluid exhibits multiple spatial scales.\n\n[[Reaction-diffusion]] systems in which one reagent diffuses much more slowly than another can form [[pattern formation|spatial patterns]] marked by areas where a reagent exists, and areas where it does not, with sharp transitions between them. In [[ecology]], predator-prey models such as\n\n:<math>u_t = \\varepsilon u_{xx} + uf(u) - vg(u), \\,</math>\n:<math>v_t = v_{xx} + vh(u), \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>u</math> is the prey and <math>v</math> is the predator, have been shown to exhibit such patterns.<ref>Owen, M. R.  and Lewis,  M. A. How Predation can Slow, Stop, or Reverse a Prey Invasion, ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology'' (2001) 63, 655-684.</ref>\n\n=== Algebraic equations ===\n\nConsider the problem of finding all [[Root of a function|roots]] of the polynomial <math>p(x) = \\varepsilon x^3-x^2+1</math>. In the limit <math>\\varepsilon\\to 0</math>, this [[cubic function|cubic]] degenerates into the [[quadratic function|quadratic]] <math>1 - x^2</math> with roots at <math>x = \\pm 1</math>. Substituting a regular perturbation series\n\n:<math>x(\\varepsilon) = x_0 + \\varepsilon x_1 + \\varepsilon^2 x_2+\\cdots</math>\n\nin the equation and equating equal powers of <math>\\varepsilon</math> only yields corrections to these two roots:\n\n:<math>x(\\varepsilon) = \\pm 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon \\pm \\frac{5}{8}\\varepsilon^2+\\cdots .</math>\n\nTo find the other root, singular perturbation analysis must be used. We must then deal with the fact that the equation degenerates into a quadratic when we let <math>\\varepsilon</math> tend to zero, in that limit one of the roots escapes to infinity. To prevent this root from becoming invisible to the perturbative analysis, we must rescale <math>x</math> to keep track with this escaping root so that in terms of the rescaled variables, it doesn't escape. We define a rescaled variable <math>x= \\frac{y}{\\varepsilon^{\\nu}}</math> where the exponent <math>\\nu</math> will be chosen such that we rescale just fast enough so that the root is at a finite value of <math>y</math> in the limit of <math>\\varepsilon</math> to zero, but such that it doesn't collapse to zero where the other two roots will end up. In terms of <math>y</math> we have\n\n:<math>y^3 -\\varepsilon^{\\nu-1}y^2 + \\varepsilon^{3\\nu - 1} = 0 .</math>\n\nWe can see that for <math>\\nu < 1</math> the <math>y^3</math> is dominated by the lower degree terms, while at <math>\\nu =1</math> it becomes as dominant as the <math>y^2</math> term while they both dominate the remaining term. This point where the highest order term will no longer vanish in the limit <math>\\varepsilon</math> to zero by becoming equally dominant to another term, is called significant degeneration; this yields the correct rescaling to make the remaining root visible. This choice yields\n\n:<math>y^3 -y^2 + \\varepsilon^2 = 0 .</math>\n\nSubstituting the perturbation series\n\n:<math>y(\\varepsilon) = y_0 + \\varepsilon^2 y_1 + \\varepsilon^4 y_2+\\cdots</math>\n\nyields\n\n:<math>y_0^3 - y_0^2 = 0.</math>\n\nWe are then interested in the root at <math>y_0 = 1</math>; the double root at <math>y_0 = 0</math> are the two roots that we've found above that collapse to zero in the limit of an infinite rescaling. Calculating the first few terms of the series then yields\n\n:<math>x(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{y(\\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon}  = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - \\varepsilon - 2\\varepsilon^3+\\cdots.</math>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Singular Perturbation}}\n[[Category:Differential equations]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear control]]\n[[Category:Perturbation theory]]"

If, however, these same sinusoids have phases which change rapidly as the frequency changes, they will add incoherently, varying between constructive and destructive addition at different times.\n\n== Formula ==\nLetting <math>\\Sigma</math> denote the set of [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of the function <math>f</math> (i.e. points where <math>\\nabla f =0</math>), under the assumption that <math>g</math> is either compactly supported or has exponential decay, and that all critical points are nondegenerate (i.e. <math>\\det(\\mathrm{Hess}(f(x_0))\\neq 0</math> for <math>x_0 \\in \\Sigma</math>) we have the following asymptotic formula, as <math>k\\to \\infty</math>:\n\n<math>\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}g(x)e^{ikf(x)}=\\sum_{x_0\\in \\Sigma} e^{ik f(x_0)}|\\det({\\mathrm{Hess}}(f))|^{-1/2}e^{\\pi i/4 \\mathrm{sign}(\\mathrm{Hess}(f))}(2\\pi/k)^{n/2}g(x_0)+o(k^{-n/2})</math>\n\nHere <math>\\mathrm{Hess}(f)</math> denotes the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of <math>f</math>.\n\nFor <math>n=1</math>, this reduces to:\n\n<math>\\int_\\mathbb{R}g(x)e^{ikf(x)}dx=\\sum_{x_0\\in \\Sigma} g(x_0)e^{ik f(x_0)+\\mathrm{sign}(f''(x_0))i\\pi/4}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k |f''(x_0)|}\\right)^{1/2}+o(k^{-1/2})</math>\n\nIn this case the assumptions on <math>f</math> reduce to all the critical points being non-degenerate.\n\nThis is just the [[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]] version of the formula for the [[method of steepest descent]].\n\n==An example==\n\nConsider a function\n\n:<math>f(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbb R} F(\\omega) e^{i [k(\\omega) x - \\omega t]} \\, d\\omega</math>.\n\nThe phase term in this function, {{nowrap|''ϕ'' {{=}} ''k''(''ω'') ''x'' − ''ω'' ''t''}}, is stationary when\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\mathopen{}\\left(k(\\omega) x - \\omega t\\right)\\mathclose{} = 0</math>\n\nor equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\frac{d k}{d\\omega} = \\frac{t}{x}</math>.\n\nSolutions to this equation yield dominant frequencies ''ω''<sub>0</sub> for some ''x'' and ''t''. If we expand ''ϕ'' as a [[Taylor series]] about ''ω''<sub>0</sub> and neglect terms of order higher than {{nowrap|(''ω'' − ''ω''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}},\n\n:<math>\\phi = \\left[k(\\omega_0) x - \\omega_0 t\\right] + \\frac{1}{2} x k''(\\omega_0) (\\omega - \\omega_0)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nwhere ''k''″ denotes the second derivative of ''k''.  When ''x'' is relatively large, even a small difference {{nowrap|(''ω'' − ''ω''<sub>0</sub>)}} will generate rapid oscillations within the integral, leading to cancellation. Therefore we can extend the limits of integration beyond the limit for a Taylor expansion. If we double the real contribution from the positive frequencies of the transform to account for the negative frequencies,\n\n:<math>f(x, t) \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot 2 \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ e^{i \\left[k(\\omega_0) x - \\omega_0 t\\right]} \\left|F(\\omega_0)\\right| \\int_{\\mathbb R} e^{\\frac{1}{2} i x k''(\\omega_0) (\\omega - \\omega_0)^2} \\, d\\omega \\right\\}</math>.\n\nThis integrates to\n\n:<math>f(x, t) \\approx \\frac{\\left|F(\\omega_0)\\right|}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{x \\left|k''(\\omega_0)\\right|}} \\cos\\left[k(\\omega_0) x - \\omega_0 t \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]</math>.\n\n==Reduction steps==\n\nThe first major general statement of the principle involved is that the asymptotic behaviour of ''I''(''k'') depends only on the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of ''f''.  If by choice of ''g'' the integral is localised to a region of space where ''f'' has no critical point, the resulting integral tends to 0 as the frequency of oscillations is taken to infinity. See for example [[Riemann-Lebesgue lemma]].\n\nThe second statement is that when ''f'' is a [[Morse function]], so that the singular points of ''f'' are [[non-degenerate critical point|non-degenerate]] and isolated, then the question can be reduced to the case ''n'' = 1. In fact, then, a choice of ''g'' can be made to split the integral into cases with just one critical point ''P'' in each. At that point, because the [[Hessian determinant]] at ''P'' is by assumption not 0, the [[Morse lemma]] applies. By a change of co-ordinates ''f'' may be replaced by\n\n:<math>(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\cdots + x_j^2) - (x_{j + 1}^2 + x_{j + 2}^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2)</math>.\n\nThe value of ''j'' is given by the [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] of the [[Hessian matrix]] of ''f'' at ''P''. As for ''g'', the essential case is that ''g'' is a product of [[bump function]]s of ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>. Assuming now without loss of generality that ''P'' is the origin,  take a smooth bump function ''h'' with value 1 on the interval {{nowrap|[−1, 1]}} and quickly tending to 0 outside it. Take\n\n:<math>g(x) = \\prod_i h(x_i)</math>,\n\nthen [[Fubini's theorem]] reduces ''I''(''k'') to a product of integrals over the real line like\n\n:<math>J(k) = \\int h(x) e^{i k f(x)} \\, dx</math>\n\nwith ''f''(''x'') = ±''x''<sup>2</sup>. The case with the minus sign is the [[complex conjugate]] of the case with the plus sign, so there is essentially one required asymptotic estimate.\n\nIn this way asymptotics can be found for oscillatory integrals for Morse functions. The degenerate case requires further techniques (see for example [[Airy function]]).\n\n==One-dimensional case==\n\nThe essential statement is this one:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 e^{i k x^2} \\, dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{k}} e^{i \\pi / 4} + \\mathcal O \\mathopen{}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)\\mathclose{}</math>.\n\nIn fact by [[contour integration]] it can be shown that the main term on the right hand side of the equation is the value of the integral on the left hand side, extended over the range {{nowrap|[−∞, ∞]}} (for a proof see [[Fresnel integral]]). Therefore it is the question of estimating away the integral over, say, {{nowrap|[1, ∞]}}.<ref>See for example [[Jean Dieudonné]], ''Infinitesimal Calculus'', p. 119 or [[Jean Dieudonné]], ''Calcul Infinitésimal'', p.135.</ref>\n\nThis is the model for all one-dimensional integrals ''I''(''k'') with ''f'' having a single non-degenerate critical point at which ''f'' has [[second derivative]] > 0. In fact the model case has second derivative 2 at 0. In order to scale using ''k'', observe that replacing ''k'' by {{nowrap|''c'' ''k''}}\nwhere ''c'' is constant is the same as scaling ''x'' by √''c''. It follows that for general values of {{nowrap|''f''″(0) > 0}}, the factor {{nowrap|√(''π'' / ''k'')}} becomes\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi}{k f''(0)}}</math>.\n\nFor {{nowrap|''f''″(0) < 0}} one uses the complex conjugate formula, as mentioned before.\n\n== Lower Order Terms ==\nAs can be seen from the formula, stationary phase provides the first-order approximation of the asymptotic behavior of the integral. The lower order terms can be understood as a sum of over [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrams]] with various weighting factors, for well behaved <math>f</math>.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Common integrals in quantum field theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bleistein, N. and Handelsman, R.

      "text": "{{about||the architecture concept|Shearing layers|the anatomical structure|Boundary layer of uterus|the concept in asymptotic analysis|Method of matched asymptotic expansions}}\nIn [[physics]] and [[fluid mechanics]], a '''boundary layer''' is an important concept and refers to the layer of [[fluid]] in the immediate vicinity of a [[Boundary (thermodynamic)|bounding surface]] where the effects of viscosity are significant.\n\nIn the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the [[atmospheric boundary layer]] is the air layer near the ground affected by diurnal heat, moisture or momentum transfer to or from the surface.  On an [[aircraft]] [[wing]] the boundary layer is the part of the flow close to the wing, where [[viscosity|viscous]] [[force]]s distort the surrounding non-viscous flow.\n\n==Types of boundary layer==\n[[Image:Boundarylayer.png|343x343px|thumb|right|Boundary layer visualization, showing transition from laminar to turbulent condition]]\nLaminar boundary layers can be loosely classified according to their structure and the circumstances under which they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body is an example of a [[Stokes boundary layer]], while the [[Blasius boundary layer]] refers to the well-known [[Similitude (model)|similarity]] solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and [[Falkner–Skan boundary layer]], a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the [[Coriolis effect]] (rather than convective inertia), an [[Ekman layer]] forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.\n\nThe viscous nature of airflow reduces the local velocities on a surface and is responsible for skin friction. The layer of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer. There are two different types of boundary layer flow: laminar and turbulent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=A.D.|title=Boundary layers|date=1989|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0930403576|edition=1st publ.}}</ref>\n\n'''Laminar boundary layer flow'''\n\nThe laminar boundary is a very smooth flow, while the turbulent boundary layer contains swirls or \"eddies.\" The laminar flow creates less skin friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing surface begins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow continues back from the leading edge, the laminar boundary layer increases in thickness.\n\n'''Turbulent boundary layer flow'''\n\nAt some distance back from the leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have a large amount of the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.\n\n==Aerodynamics==\n[[File:Prandtl portrait.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Prandtl|289x289px]]\n[[File:Laminar boundary layer scheme.svg|thumb|322x322px|Laminar boundary layer velocity profile]] The [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] boundary layer was first defined by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in a paper presented on August 12, 1904 at the third [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Heidelberg, Germany]]. It simplifies the equations of fluid flow by dividing the flow field into two areas: one inside the boundary layer, dominated by [[viscosity]] and creating the majority of [[drag (physics)|drag]] experienced by the boundary body; and one outside the boundary layer, where viscosity can be neglected without significant effects on the solution. This allows a closed-form solution for the flow in both areas, a significant simplification of the full [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. The majority of the [[heat transfer]] to and from a body also takes place within the boundary layer, again allowing the equations to be simplified in the flow field outside the boundary layer.  The pressure distribution throughout the boundary layer in the direction normal to the surface (such as an [[airfoil]]) remains constant throughout the boundary layer, and is the same as on the surface itself.\n\nThe [[Boundary-layer thickness|thickness]] of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as the distance from the solid body to the point at which the viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). [[displacement thickness|Displacement thickness]] is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The [[no-slip condition]] requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.\n\nThe [[Thermal boundary layer thickness and shape|thermal boundary layer thickness]] is similarly the distance from the body at which the temperature is 99% of the freestream temperature. The ratio of the two thicknesses is governed by the [[Prandtl number]]. If the Prandtl number is 1, the two boundary layers are the same thickness.  If the Prandtl number is greater than 1, the thermal boundary layer is thinner than the velocity boundary layer. If the Prandtl number is less than 1, which is the case for air at standard conditions, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer.\n\nIn high-performance designs, such as [[glider aircraft|glider]]s and commercial aircraft, much attention is paid to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to minimize drag.  Two effects have to be considered. First, the boundary layer adds to the effective thickness of the body, through the [[displacement thickness]], hence increasing the pressure drag.  Secondly, the [[simple shear|shear]] forces at the surface of the wing create [[skin friction|skin friction drag]].\n\nAt high [[Reynolds number]]s, typical of full-sized aircraft, it is desirable to have a [[Laminar flow|laminar]] boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes [[turbulent]], the process known as [[boundary layer transition]]. One way of dealing with this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a [[porous]] surface (see [[Boundary layer suction]]). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. [[Natural laminar flow]] techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the airfoil or [[fuselage]] so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.\n\nAt lower [[Reynolds number]]s, such as those seen with model aircraft, it is relatively easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by [[adverse pressure gradient]]s. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such [[flow separation]] causes a large increase in the [[pressure drag]], since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a [[turbulator]]. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as [[vortex generator]]s on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.\n\nWhen using half-models in wind tunnels, a [[peniche (fluid dynamics)|peniche]] is sometimes used to reduce or eliminate the effect of the boundary layer.\n\n==Boundary layer equations==\n\nThe deduction of the '''boundary layer equations''' was one of the most important advances in fluid dynamics. Using an [[order of magnitude analysis]], the well-known governing [[Navier–Stokes equations]] of [[viscous]] [[fluid]] flow can be greatly simplified within the boundary layer. Notably, the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic]] of the [[Partial differential equation|partial differential equations (PDE)]] becomes parabolic, rather than the elliptical form of the full Navier–Stokes equations. This greatly simplifies the solution of the equations. By making the boundary layer approximation, the flow is divided into an inviscid portion (which is easy to solve by a number of methods) and the boundary layer, which is governed by an easier to solve [[Partial differential equation|PDE]]. The continuity and Navier–Stokes equations for a two-dimensional steady [[incompressible flow]] in [[Cartesian coordinates]] are given by\n\n:<math> {\\partial u\\over\\partial x}+{\\partial \\upsilon\\over\\partial y}=0 </math>\n\n:<math> u{\\partial u \\over \\partial x}+\\upsilon{\\partial u \\over \\partial y}=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial p \\over \\partial x}+{\\nu}\\left({\\partial^2 u\\over \\partial x^2}+{\\partial^2 u\\over \\partial y^2}\\right) </math>\n\n:<math> u{\\partial \\upsilon \\over \\partial x}+\\upsilon{\\partial \\upsilon \\over \\partial y}=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial p \\over \\partial y}+{\\nu}\\left({\\partial^2 \\upsilon\\over \\partial x^2}+{\\partial^2 \\upsilon\\over \\partial y^2}\\right) </math>\n\nwhere <math>u</math> and <math>\\upsilon</math> are the velocity components, <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>p</math> is the pressure, and <math>\\nu</math> is the [[kinematic viscosity]] of the fluid at a point.\n\nThe approximation states that, for a sufficiently high [[Reynolds number]] the flow over a surface can be divided into an outer region of inviscid flow unaffected by viscosity (the majority of the flow), and a region close to the surface where viscosity is important (the boundary layer). Let <math>u</math> and <math>\\upsilon</math> be streamwise and transverse (wall normal) velocities respectively inside the boundary layer.  Using [[scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]], it can be shown that the above equations of motion reduce within the boundary layer to become\n\n:<math> u{\\partial u \\over \\partial x}+\\upsilon{\\partial u \\over \\partial y}=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial p \\over \\partial x}+{\\nu}{\\partial^2 u\\over \\partial y^2} </math>\n\n:<math> {1\\over \\rho} {\\partial p \\over \\partial y}=0 </math>\n\nand if the fluid is incompressible (as liquids are under standard conditions):\n\n:<math> {\\partial u\\over\\partial x}+{\\partial \\upsilon\\over\\partial y}=0 </math>\n\nThe order of magnitude analysis assumes the streamwise length scale significantly larger than the transverse length scale inside the boundary layer.  It follows that variations in properties in the streamwise direction are generally much lower than those in the wall normal direction. Apply this to the continuity equation shows that <math>\\upsilon</math>, the wall normal velocity, is small compared with <math>u</math> the streamwise velocity.\n\nSince the static pressure <math>p</math> is independent of <math>y</math>, then pressure at the edge of the boundary layer is the pressure throughout the boundary layer at a given streamwise position. The external pressure may be obtained through an application of [[Bernoulli's equation]].  Let <math> U </math> be the fluid velocity outside the boundary layer, where <math> u </math> and <math> U </math> are both parallel. This gives upon substituting for <math>p</math> the following result\n\n:<math> u{\\partial u \\over \\partial x}+\\upsilon{\\partial u \\over \\partial y}=U\\frac{dU}{dx}+{\\nu}{\\partial^2 u\\over \\partial y^2} </math>\n\nFor a flow in which the static pressure <math> p </math> also does not change in the direction of the flow\n\n:<math> \\frac{dp}{dx}=0 </math>\n\nso <math> U </math> remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion simplifies to become\n\n:<math> u{\\partial u \\over \\partial x}+\\upsilon{\\partial u \\over \\partial y}={\\nu}{\\partial^2 u\\over \\partial y^2} </math>\n\nThese approximations are used in a variety of practical flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous [[laminar flow|laminar]] or [[turbulent]] boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the [[mean]] flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution often referred to as the [[Blasius boundary layer]].\n\n===Prandtl's transposition theorem===\n[[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]]<ref>Prandtl, L. \"Zur berechnung der grenzschichten.\" ZAMM‐Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics/Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 18.1 (1938): 77–82.</ref> observed that from any solution <math>u(x,y,t),\\ v(x,y,t)</math> which satisfies the boundary layer equations, further solution <math>u^*(x,y,t),\\ v^*(x,y,t) </math>, which is also satisfying the boundary layer equations, can be constructed by writing\n\n:<math>u^*(x,y,t) = u(x,y+f(x),t), \\quad v^*(x,y,t) = v(x,y+f(x),t) - f'(x) u(x,y+f(x),t)</math>\n\nwhere <math>f(x)</math> is arbitrary.

One of the most widely used techniques in which turbulent flows are tackled is to apply [[Reynolds decomposition]]. Here the instantaneous flow properties are decomposed into a mean and fluctuating component. Applying this technique to the boundary layer equations gives the full turbulent boundary layer equations not often given in literature:\n\n:<math> {\\partial \\overline{u}\\over\\partial x}+{\\partial \\overline{v}\\over\\partial y}=0 </math>\n\n:<math> \\overline{u}{\\partial \\overline{u} \\over \\partial x}+\\overline{v}{\\partial \\overline{u} \\over \\partial y}=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial \\overline{p} \\over \\partial x}+ \\nu \\left({\\partial^2 \\overline{u}\\over \\partial x^2}+{\\partial^2 \\overline{u}\\over \\partial y^2}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\overline{u'v'})-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\overline{u'^2}) </math>\n\n:<math> \\overline{u}{\\partial \\overline{v} \\over \\partial x}+\\overline{v}{\\partial \\overline{v} \\over \\partial y}=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial \\overline{p} \\over \\partial y}+\\nu \\left({\\partial^2 \\overline{v}\\over \\partial x^2}+{\\partial^2 \\overline{v}\\over \\partial y^2}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\overline{u'v'})-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\overline{v'^2}) </math>\n\nUsing a similar order-of-magnitude analysis, the above equations can be reduced to leading order terms. By choosing length scales <math> \\delta </math> for changes in the transverse-direction, and <math> L </math> for changes in the streamwise-direction, with <math>\\delta<<L</math>, the x-momentum equation simplifies to:\n\n:<math> \\overline{u}{\\partial \\overline{u} \\over \\partial x}+\\overline{v}{\\partial \\overline{u} \\over \\partial y}=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial \\overline{p} \\over \\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\overline{u'v'}). </math>\n\nThis equation does not satisfy the [[no-slip condition]] at the wall. Like Prandtl did for his boundary layer equations, a new, smaller length scale must be used to allow the viscous term to become leading order in the momentum equation. By choosing <math>\\eta<<\\delta</math> as the ''y''-scale, the leading order momentum equation for this \"inner boundary layer\" is given by:\n\n:<math> 0=-{1\\over \\rho} {\\partial \\overline{p} \\over \\partial x}+{\\nu}{\\partial^2 \\overline{u}\\over \\partial y^2}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\overline{u'v'}). </math>\n\nIn the limit of infinite Reynolds number, the pressure gradient term can be shown to have no effect on the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer. The new \"inner length scale\" <math>\\eta</math> is a viscous length scale, and is of order <math>\\frac{\\nu}{u_*}</math>, with <math>u_*</math> being the velocity scale of the turbulent fluctuations, in this case a [[Shear velocity#Friction Velocity in Turbulence|friction velocity]].\n\nUnlike the laminar boundary layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. the inner and outer scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent boundary layer difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called [[Law of the wall|log-law]] or [[Law of the wall#Power law solutions|power-law]].\n\nThe additional term <math>\\overline{u'v'}</math> in the turbulent boundary layer equations is known as the Reynolds shear stress and is unknown [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. The solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations therefore necessitates the use of a [[Turbulence modeling|turbulence model]], which aims to express the Reynolds shear stress in terms of known flow variables or derivatives. The lack of accuracy and generality of such models is a major obstacle in the successful prediction of turbulent flow properties in modern fluid dynamics.\n\nA constant stress layer exists in the near wall region. Due to the damping of the vertical velocity fluctuations near the wall, the Reynolds stress term will become negligible and we find that a linear velocity profile exists. This is only true for the very [[Law of the wall#Near the wall|near wall region]].\n\n== Heat and mass transfer ==\nIn 1928, the French engineer [[André Lévêque]] observed that convective heat transfer in a flowing fluid is affected only by the velocity values very close to the surface.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author= Lévêque, A.\n|year=1928\n|title=Les lois de la transmission de chaleur par convection\n|journal=Annales des Mines ou Recueil de Mémoires sur l'Exploitation des Mines et sur les Sciences et les Arts qui s'y Rattachent, Mémoires\n|volume=XIII\n|issue=13\n|pages=201–239\n|language=French}}</ref><ref name=\"McMahon\">{{cite web\n|title=André Lévêque p285, a review of his velocity profile approximation\n|author=Niall McMahon\n|url=http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~nmcmahon/biography/leveque/leveque_approximation.html\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604004223/http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~nmcmahon/biography/leveque/leveque_approximation.html\n|archivedate=2012-06-04\n|df=\n}}</ref> For flows of large Prandtl number, the temperature/mass transition from surface to freestream temperature takes place across a very thin region close to the surface.

Rather than the differential x-momentum balance (equation of motion), this uses a similarly derived Energy and Mass balance:\n\nEnergy:{{space|8}} <math> v_x {\\partial T \\over \\partial x} + v_y {\\partial T \\over \\partial y} = {k \\over \\rho C_p}{\\partial^2 T \\over \\partial y^2} </math>\n\nMass:{{space|10}} <math> v_x {\\partial c_A \\over \\partial x} + v_y {\\partial c_A \\over \\partial y} = D_{AB}{\\partial^2 c_A \\over \\partial y^2} </math>\n\nFor the momentum balance, kinematic viscosity <math>\\nu</math> can be considered to be the ''momentum diffusivity''. In the energy balance this is replaced by thermal diffusivity <math>\\alpha = {k / \\rho C_P}</math>, and by mass diffusivity <math>D_{AB}</math> in the mass balance. In thermal diffusivity of a substance, <math>k</math> is its thermal conductivity, <math>\\rho</math> is its density and <math>C_P</math> is its heat capacity.

This leads to a reduced set of equations known as the [[Boundary layer#Boundary layer equations|boundary layer equations]]. For steady incompressible flow with constant viscosity and density, these read:\n\nContinuity: <math> \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=0 </math>\n\n<math>x</math>-Momentum: <math> u \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = - \\dfrac{1}{\\rho} \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + {\\nu} \\dfrac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} </math>\n\n<math>y</math>-Momentum: <math> \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0 </math>\n\nHere the coordinate system is chosen with <math>x</math> pointing parallel to the plate in the direction of the flow and the <math>y</math> coordinate pointing towards the free stream, <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> are the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> velocity components, <math>p</math> is the [[pressure]], <math>\\rho</math> is the [[density]] and <math>\\nu</math> is the [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]].\n\nThe <math>y</math>-momentum equation implies that the pressure in the boundary layer must be equal to that of the free stream for any given <math>x</math> coordinate.

      "text": "[[File:Hunting h126 RAF Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Blown flaps of the [[Hunting H.126]]]]\n'''Blown flaps''', or '''jet flaps''', are powered [[aerodynamic]] [[high-lift device]]s used on the [[wing]]s of certain [[aircraft]] to improve their low-speed flight characteristics. They use air blown through nozzles to shape the airflow over the rear edge of the wing, directing the flow downward to increase the [[lift coefficient]]. There are a variety of methods to achieve this airflow, most of which use jet exhaust or high-pressure air [[Bleed air|bled off]] of a jet engine's compressor and then redirected to follow the line of [[Flap (aeronautics)|trailing-edge flaps]].\n\nThe term may be used to refer specifically to those systems that use internal ductwork within the wing to direct the airflow, or more broadly to systems like upper surface blowing or nozzle systems on conventional underwing engine which that direct air through the flaps. Blown flaps are one solution among a broader category known as [[powered lift]], which also includes various [[boundary layer control]] systems, systems using directed [[Slipstream|prop wash]], and [[circulation control wing]]s.\n\nInternal blown flaps were used on some carrier and land-based fast jets in the 1960s, including the [[Lockheed F-104]], [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] and certain versions of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]. They generally fell from favour because they imposed a significant maintenance overhead in keeping the ductwork clean and various valve systems working properly, along with the disadvantage that an engine failure reduced lift in precisely the situation where it is most desired. The concept reappeared in the form of upper and lower blowing in several [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]], both turboprop and turbofan.\n\n==Mechanism==\nIn a conventional blown flap, a small amount of the compressed air produced by the [[jet engine]] is \"bled\" off at the compressor stage and piped to channels running along the rear of the wing. There, it is forced through slots in the [[Flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]] of the aircraft when the flaps reach certain angles. Injecting high energy air into the [[boundary layer]] produces an increase in the stalling [[angle of attack]] and maximum [[lift coefficient]] by delaying [[boundary layer separation]] from the [[airfoil]]. [[Boundary layer control]] by mass injecting (blowing) prevents [[boundary layer separation]] by supplying additional energy to the particles of [[fluid]] which are being retarded in the [[boundary layer]]. Therefore, injecting a high velocity air mass into the air stream essentially [[tangent]] to the wall surface of the airfoil reverses the boundary layer friction deceleration thus the boundary layer separation is delayed.<ref>Aerodynamics for Engineering Students, E.L. Houghton & P.W. Carpenter, Elsevier</ref>\n\nThe lift of a wing can be greatly increased with blowing [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]]. With mechanical slots the natural boundary layer limits the boundary layer control pressure to the freestream total head.<ref>http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.59830?journalCode=ja p.508</ref> Blowing with a small proportion of engine airflow (internal blown flap) increases the lift. Using much higher quantities of gas from the engine exhaust, which increases the effective chord of the flap (the jet flap), produces supercirculation,<ref name=bedford>http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/rm/3304.pdf p.1</ref> or forced circulation<ref name=nasa>http://cafefoundation.org/v2/pdf_tech/Drag.Reduction/NASA.Synergistic.Airframe.1998.pdf p.22</ref> up to the theoretical potential flow maximum.<ref name=bedford/> Surpassing this limit requires the addition of direct thrust.<ref name=nasa/>\n\nDevelopment of the general concept continued at [[NASA]] in the 1950s and 60s, leading to simplified systems with similar performance. The ''externally blown flap'' arranges the engine to blow across the flaps at the rear of the wing. Some of the jet exhaust is deflected downward directly by the flap, while additional air travels through the slots in the flap and follows the outer edge due to the [[Coandă effect]]. The similar ''upper-surface blowing'' system arranges the engines over the wing and relies completely on the Coandă effect to redirect the airflow. Although not as effective as direct blowing, these \"powered lift\" systems are nevertheless quite powerful and much simpler to build and maintain.\n\nA more recent and promising blow-type flow control concept is the counter-flow fluid injection which is able to exert [[high-authority control]] to global flows using low energy modifications to key flow regions. In this case the air blow slit is located at the pressure side near the [[leading edge]] [[stagnation point]] location and the control air-flow is directed [[tangentially]] to the surface but with a forward direction. During the operation of such a flow control system two different effects are present. One effect, [[boundary layer enhancement]], is caused by the increased [[turbulence]] levels away from the wall region thus transporting higher-energy outer flow into the wall region. In addition to that another effect, the [[virtual shaping effect]], is utilized to aerodynamically thicken the [[airfoil]] at high [[angles of attack]]. Both these effects help to delay or eliminate [[flow separation]].<ref>Control of High-Reynolds-Number Turbulent Boundary Layer Separation Using Counter-Flow Fluid Injection, B.E. Wake, G. Tillman, S.S. Ochs, J.S. Kearney, 3rd AIAA Flow Control Conference, 2006</ref>\n\nIn general, blown flaps can improve the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a [[Boeing 747]] produces a [[coefficient of lift]] of about 2.45,<ref name=agard>\"Aerodynamic issues in the Design of High-Lift Systems for Transport Aircraft\" Figure 1. Trends in Boeing Transport High Lift System Development, Agard CP-365</ref> external blowing (upper surface blowing on a [[YC-14]]) improves this to about 7,<ref name=agard/> and internal blowing (jet flap on [[Hunting H.126]]) to 9.<ref>\nhttp://cafefoundation.org/v2/pdf_tech/Drag.Reduction/NASA.Synergistic.Airframe.1998.pdf p.18</ref>\n\n==History==\nWilliams<ref name=\"naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk\">http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0209.pdf</ref> states some flap blowing tests were done at the R.A.E. before the Second World War and that extensive tests were done during the war in Germany including flight tests with Arado 232, Do-24 and Bf 109 aircraft. Lachmann<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%203066.html</ref> states the Arado and Dornier aircraft used an ejector-driven single flow of air which was sucked over part of the trailing edge span and blown over the remainder. The ejector was chemically powered using high pressure vapour. The Bf 109 used engine-driven blowers for flap blowing.\n\nRebuffet and Poisson-Quinton<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930093899.pdf</ref> describe tests in France at O.N.E.R.A. after the war with combined sucking at le of first flap section and blowing at second flap section using a jet engine compressor bleed ejector to give both sucking and blowing. Flight testing was done on a [[Breguet Vultur]] aircraft.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19850024795.pdf</ref>\n\nTests were also done at Westland Aircraft by W.H. Paine after the war with reports dated 1950 and 1951.<ref name=\"naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk\"/>\n\nIn the United States a [[Grumman F9F Panther]] was modified with flap blowing based on work done by John Attinello in 1951. Engine compressor bleed was used. The system was known as \"Supercirculation Boundary Layer Control\" or BLC for short.<ref>\"U.S. Naval Air Superiority Development of Shipborne Jet Fighters 1943-1962\" Tommy H. Thomason, Midland Publishing, Hincklet 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58007-110-9}}, page 81</ref>\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955 Cessna did flap blowing tests on Cessna 309 and 319 aircraft using the Arado system.<ref name=cessna>\"Cessna Wings for the World, the Single-Engine Development Story\" by William D. Thompson, 1991</ref>\n   \nDuring the 1950s and 60s, [[fighter aircraft]] generally evolved towards smaller wings in order to reduce drag at high speeds. Compared to the fighters of a generation earlier, they had [[wing loading]]s about four times as high; for instance the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] had a wing loading of {{nowrap|24 lb/ft<sup>2</sup>}} {{nowrap|(117 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)}} and the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] had the \"very high\" loading of {{nowrap|30 lb/ft<sup>2</sup>}} {{nowrap|(146 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)}}, whereas the 1950s-era [[F-104 Starfighter]] had {{nowrap|111 lb/ft<sup>2</sup>}} {{nowrap|(542 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)}}.\n\nOne serious downside to these higher wing loadings is at low speed, when there isn't enough wing left to provide lift to keep the plane flying. Even huge flaps could not offset this to any large degree, and as a result many aircraft landed at fairly high speeds, and were noted for accidents as a result.\n\nThe major reason flaps were not effective is that the airflow over the wing could only be \"bent so much\" before it stopped following the wing profile, a condition known as '''[[flow separation]]'''. There is a limit to how much air the flaps can deflect overall. There are ways to improve this, through better flap design; modern airliners use complex multi-part flaps for instance. However, large flaps tend to add considerable complexity, and take up room on the outside of the wing, which makes them unsuitable for use on a fighter.\n\nThe principle of the jet flap, a type of internally blown flap, was proposed and patented in 1952 by the British [[National Gas Turbine Establishment]] (NGTE) and thereafter investigated by the NGTE and the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]].<ref>''Flight International'' 1963 p454</ref>\nThe concept was first tested at full-scale on the experimental [[Hunting H.126]]. It reduced the [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed to only {{convert|32|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, a number most light aircraft cannot match. The jet flap used a large percentage of the engine exhaust, rather than compressor bleed air, for blowing.<ref name=\"cafefoundation.org\">http://cafefoundation.org/v2/pdf_tech/Drag.Reduction/NASA.Synergistic.Airframe.1998.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Image:Buccanneer blown wings diagram (1).svg|thumb|A [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneer]] pictured with the blowing slots visible on the leading edges. The extended [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] are contributing to the [[Coandă effect|coanda]] airflow over the wing.]]\n\nOne of the first production aircraft with blown flaps was the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] which entered service in January 1958.<ref>\"United States Army and Air Force Fighter 1916-1961\" produced by D.A. Russell, Harleyford Publications Limited, Letchworth 1961, Library of Congress Card No.61-16739(United States) page 132</ref> After prolonged development problems, the BLCS proved to be enormously useful in compensating for the Starfighter's tiny wing surface. The [[Lockheed T2V SeaStar]], with blown flaps, had entered service in May 1957 but was to have persistent maintenance problems with the BLCS which led to its early retirement.<ref>American Military Training Aircraft' E.R. Johnson and Lloyd S. Jones, McFarland & Co. Inc. Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina</ref> In June 1958 the [[Supermarine Scimitar]] with blown flaps entered service.<ref>\"British Naval Aircraft Since 1912\" Owen Thetford, Putnam & Co. Ltd.London, 1962, p.318</ref> Blown flaps were used on the [[North American Aviation]] [[A-5 Vigilante]], the [[Vought F-8 Crusader]] variants E(FN) and J, the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] and the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]]. The [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]] had blown flaps. Petrov<ref name=\"icas.org\">[http://icas.org/ICAS_ARCHIVE/ICAS2012/PAPERS/266.PDF [[International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences|ICAS]] Archive]</ref> states long-term operation of these aircraft showed high reliability of the BLC systems. The [[TSR-2]], which was cancelled before it entered service, had full-span blown flaps.<ref>\"TSR2 with Hindsight\" edited by Air Vice-Marshal A F C Hunter CBE AFC DL, Royal Air Force Historical Society 1998, {{ISBN|0-9519824 8 6}}, page 181</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1970s the lessons of air combat over [[Vietnam]] changed thinking considerably. Instead of aircraft designed for outright speed, general maneuverability and load capacity became more important in most designs. The result is an evolution back to larger planforms to provide more lift. For instance the [[F-16]] has a wing loading of {{nowrap|78.5 lb/ft<sup>2</sup>}} {{nowrap|(383 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)}}, and uses [[leading edge extension]]s to provide considerably more lift at higher [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], including approach and landing. Some later combat aircraft achieved the required low-speed characteristics using [[swing-wing]]s. Internal flap blowing is still used to supplement externally blown flaps on the [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]].\n\nSome aircraft currently (2015) in service that require a STOL performance use external flap blowing and, in some cases, also use internal flap blowing on flaps as well as on  control surfaces such as the rudder to ensure adequate control and stability at low speeds. External blowing concepts are known as<ref name=\"cafefoundation.org\"/> the \"externally blown flap\" (used on the [[C-17 Globemaster ]]), \"upper surface blowing\" (used on the [[An-72]] and [[An-74]]) and \"vectored slipstream\", or \"over the wing blowing\",<ref name=\"icas.org\"/> used on the [[An-70]] and the [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] and [[ShinMaywa US-2]].\n\nPowered high-lift systems, such as externally blown flaps, are not used for civil transport aircraft for reasons given by Reckzeh,<ref>\"Aerodynamiic Design of Airbus High-Lift Wings in a Multidisciplinary Environment\" Daniel Reckzeh, European Congress on Computational Methods in Applied Sciences and Engineering ECCOMAS 2004</ref> which include complexity, weight, cost, sufficient existing runway lengths and certification rules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Boundary layer]]\n*[[Boundary layer control]]\n*[[Coandă effect]]\n*[[Circulation control wing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200061.html |title=Blow, blow thou BLC wind|date=1971 |journal=Flight International }}\n{{Aircraft components}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blown Flap}}\n[[Category:Aircraft controls]]\n[[Category:Boundary layers]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]"

      "text": "'''Boundary layer control''' refers to methods of controlling the behaviour of [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]] [[boundary layer]]s.\n\nIt may be desirable to reduce flow separation on fast vehicles to reduce the size of the wake (streamlining), which may reduce drag. Boundary layer separation is generally undesirable in aircraft high lift coefficient systems and jet engine intakes.\n\n[[Laminar flow]] produces less skin friction than turbulent but a turbulent boundary layer transfers heat better. Turbulent boundary layers are more resistant to separation.\n\nThe energy in a boundary layer may need to be increased to keep it attached to its surface. Fresh air can be introduced through slots or mixed in from above. The low momentum layer at the surface can be sucked away through a perforated surface or bled away when it is in a high pressure duct. It can be scooped off completely by a diverter or internal bleed ducting. Its energy can be increased above that of the free stream by introducing high velocity air.\n\n==Nature==\nFrank E. Fish states that dolphins appear to have a turbulent boundary layer to reduce the likelihood of separation and minimize drag, and that mechanisms for maintaining a laminar boundary layer to reduce skin friction have not been demonstrated for dolphins.<ref>The myth and reality of Gray’s paradox: implication of dolphin drag reduction for technology https://web.archive.org/web/20160305153746/http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/2006B%26BGray%27sParadox.pdf</ref>\n\nThe wings of birds have a leading edge feature called the [[Alula]] which delays wing stalling at low speeds in a similar manner to the leading edge slat on an aircraft wing.<ref>http://www.ardeola.org/files/1295.pdf</ref>\n\nThin membrane wings found on bats and insects have features which appear to cause favourable roughening at the Reynolds numbers involved, thereby enabling these creatures to fly better than would otherwise be the case.<ref>\"The Design of the Aeroplane\" Stinton Darrol, BSP Professional Books, Oxford 1989, {{ISBN|0-632-01877-1}}, p.97</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nBalls may be given features which roughen the surface and extend the hit or throw distance. Roughening causes the boundary layer to become turbulent and remain attached farther round the back before breaking away with a smaller wake than would otherwise be the case. Balls may be struck in different ways to give them spin which makes them follow a curved path. The spin causes boundary layer separation to be biased to one side which produces a side force.\n\nBL control (roughening) was applied to golf balls in the 19th century. The stitching on cricket balls and baseballs acts as a boundary layer control structure.<ref>\"Spinning Flight\" Lorenz Ralph D.

Krause, H. Jr. Oertel, C. Mayes  8th edition Springer 2004 {{ISBN|3-540-66270-7}}</ref>  Rotation of the cylinder can reduce or eliminate the boundary layer that is formed on the side which is  moving in the same direction as the freestream.  The side moving against the flow also exhibits only partial separation of the boundary layer.  Suction applied through a slit in the cylinder near a separation point can also delay the onset of separation by removing fluid particles that have been slowed in the boundary layer.  Alternatively, fluid can be blown from a faired slit such that the slowed fluid is accelerated and thus the point of separation is delayed.\n\n==Maintaining a laminar boundary layer on aircraft==\nLaminar flow airfoils were developed in the 1930s by shaping to maintain a favourable pressure gradient to prevent them becoming turbulent. Their low-drag wind tunnel results led to them being used on aircraft such as the P-51 and B-24 but maintaining laminar flow required low levels of surface roughness and waviness not routinely found in service.<ref name=mclean>\"Understanding Aerodynamics Arguing from the Real Physics\"McLean Doug, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Many organizations have been working on the use of such actuators for flow control.  [[Boeing]], [[NASA]] and the [[University of Arizona]] Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [Advanced Fluidics], [[TU-Berlin]] are a few of them. They are slots built into the control surface of an airfoil that build on the same principles as that of [[blown flap]]s; that by actively blowing air over the surface of an airfoil the effective lift produced by it is increased.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe impetus behind the research into sweeping jet actuators lies in the realization that any vertical tail structure on an aircraft is a [[Parasitic drag|parasitic surface]] in level flight. The design specification that must be met by the [[vertical stabilizer]] of any multi-engined aircraft is that it be able to produce enough lift to counteract any [[critical engine|thrust asymmetry]] that would come as a result of engine failure during rotation (takeoff); but in any condition that is not an emergency or where a yaw moment is not desired the vertical stabilizer will only contribute added weight and drag to the aircraft.\n\nThe jet nozzles (located directly upstream of the hinge around which the [[rudder]] moves) eject a subsonic stream of air that flows over the rudder and act to retain or reattach the [[boundary layer]] to the control surface as it is deflected beyond the incidence angle where natural flow would separate, generating as much as a 30-percent increase in the effective lift produced by the rudder.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graff|first1=E|title=Sweeping Jet Actuators - a New Design Tool for High Lift Generation|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20130013994.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAs of January 2015 sweeping jet actuators have only seen experimental application and are not included as a design feature of any known aircraft.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Boundary layer control devices}}\n* [[Boundary layer control]]\n* [[Blown flap]]\n* [[Coandă effect]]\n* [[High-lift device]]\n* [[Circulation control wing]]\n* [[Leading edge slot]]\n* [[Boundary layer suction]]\n* [[Vortex generator]]\n* [[Aerodynamics]]\n* [[Turbulator]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\nCavity Resonance Suppression Using Miniature Fluidic Oscillators, G.

Improving the air flow can reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]].  Improvements in [[fuel efficiency]] have been estimated as high as 30%.\n==The boundary layer==\nThe air molecules at the surface of a wing are effectively stationary (see the [[no-slip condition]]).  If the flow is smooth, known as [[laminar flow]], the velocity of the air increases steadily as measurements are taken further away from the surface.  However the smooth flow is often disturbed by the boundary layer breaking away from the surface and creating a low pressure region immediately behind the airfoil (see [[flow separation]]). This low pressure region results in increased overall drag.  Attempts have been made over the years to delay the onset of this flow separation by careful design and smooth surfaces.\n\n==Use of suction==\nAs flow separation results from the velocity deficit that is characteristic of boundary layers, suction attempts to remove the boundary layer from the surface before it can separate.  The technology was first developed by [[Werner Pfenninger]] in the [[Second World War]] and has been researched almost continuously since.  In the 1960s, NASA experimented with this concept with the [[Northrop X-21]], a converted [[Douglas B-66 Destroyer|Douglas WB-66D]]. In the 1990s tests [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88653main_H-2382.pdf] were done by [[NASA]] with an [[General Dynamics F-16XL#NASA_testing|F-16XL]].\n\n[[Loek Boermans]] is researching the technology for use in [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] at the [[Delft University of Technology|Technical University of Delft]].  However about 500 watts of power would be needed to drive the pumps and this would mean covering the glider with [[solar panel]]s and would increase the cost greatly.  There are also structural problems to be overcome before the ultimate glider could be manufactured.\n\n== See also ==\n* The [[pusher configuration]] is an alternative way to re-energize the boundary layer, but is only used on the fuselage.\n* [[General Dynamics F-16XL#NASA|NASA F-16XL research aircraft]]\n* [[Vortex generator]]\n* [[aerodynamics]]\n* [[Boundary layer control]]\n* [[Circulation control wing]]\n* [[Turbulator]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Boundary layer suction}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060523115337/http://www.dg-flugzeugbau.de/leistung-e.html DGflugzeugbau article]\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88653main_H-2382.pdf NASA report on F16 program]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070118223025/http://www.iag.uni-stuttgart.de/transition/publications/trans_publ-200Xwww.htm combination] of [[vortex generator]] with suction\n\n[[Category:Boundary layers]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]"

The boundary layer concept was first described by [[Ludwig Prandtl]].<ref>L. Prandtl, (1904), “Über Flüssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung,” Verhandlungen des Dritten Internationalen Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg 1904, A. Krazer, ed., Teubner, Leipzig, (1905) 484–491.</ref> Consider a stationary body with a fluid flowing around it, like the semi-infinite flat plate with air flowing over the top of the plate (assume the flow and the plate extends to infinity in the positive/negative direction perpendicular to the <math>x-y</math> plane).  At the solid walls of the body the fluid satisfies a [[no-slip boundary condition]] and has zero velocity, but as you move away from the wall, the velocity of the flow asymptotically approaches the free stream mean velocity.  Therefore, it is impossible to define a sharp point at which the boundary layer becomes the free stream, yet this layer has a well-defined characteristic thickness.  The parameters below provide a useful definition of this characteristic, measurable thickness.  Also included in this boundary layer description are some parameters useful in describing the shape of the boundary layer.\n\n== Boundary Layer thickness ==\nThe '''boundary layer thickness''', '''δ''',  is the distance across a boundary layer from the walls to a point where the flow velocity has essentially reached the 'free stream' velocity, <math>u_0</math>.  This distance is defined normal to the wall.  It is customarily defined as the point <math>y_{99}</math> where:\n:<math>u(y_{99}) = 0.99u_o</math>\nat a point on the wall <math>x</math>.  For laminar boundary layers over a flat plate, the [[Blasius boundary layer|Blasius solution]] to the flow governing equations gives:<ref>Schlichting, p.140.</ref>\n:<math> \\delta \\approx 4.91 \\sqrt{ {\\nu  x}\\over u_0} </math>\n:<math> \\delta \\approx 4.91 x/ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Re}_x} </math>\n\nFor turbulent boundary layers over a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness is given by:<ref>Schlichting, p. 638.</ref>\n:<math> \\delta \\approx 0.37x/ {\\mathrm{Re}_x}^{1/5} </math>\n\nwhere\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re}_x = \\rho u_0 x/\\mu</math>\n\n:<math>\\delta</math> is the overall thickness (or height) of the boundary layer\n:<math>\\mathrm{Re}_x</math> is the [[Reynolds number]]\n:<math>\\rho</math> is the density\n:<math>u_0</math> is the freestream velocity\n:<math>x</math> is the distance downstream from the start of the boundary layer\n:<math>\\mu</math> is the dynamic viscosity\n:<math>\\nu = \\mu/\\rho</math> is the kinematic viscosity\n\nThe turbulent boundary layer thickness formula assumes 1) the flow is turbulent right from the start of the boundary layer and 2) the turbulent boundary layer behaves in a geometrically similar manner (i.e. the velocity profiles are geometrically similar along the flow in the x-direction, differing only by stretching factors in <math>y</math> and <math>u(y)</math><ref>Schlichting, p.152.</ref>).  Neither one of these assumptions are true for the general turbulent boundary layer case so care must be excersised in applying this formula.\n\nThe velocity thickness can also be referred to as the Soole ratio, although the gradient of the thickness over distance would be adversely proportional to that of velocity thickness.\n\n== Displacement thickness ==\n\nThe '''displacement thickness''', '''δ<sup>*</sup>''' or '''δ<sub>1</sub>''' is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved in the direction perpendicular to its normal vector away from the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity <math>u_0</math> to give the same flow rate as occurs between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.<ref>Schlichting, p. 140.</ref>\n\nIn practical [[aerodynamics]], the displacement thickness essentially modifies the shape of a body immersed in a fluid to allow an inviscid solution.  It is commonly used in aerodynamics to overcome the difficulty inherent in the fact that the fluid velocity in the [[boundary layer]] approaches asymptotically to the free stream value as distance from the wall increases at any given location.\n\nThe definition of the displacement thickness for [[compressibility|compressible]] flow is based on mass flow rate:\n\n:<math> {\\delta^*}= \\int_0^\\infty {\\left(1-{\\rho(y) u(y)\\over \\rho_0 u_0}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nThe definition for [[compressibility|incompressible]] flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:\n\n:<math> {\\delta^*}= \\int_0^\\infty {\\left(1-{u(y)\\over u_0}\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho_0</math> and <math>u_0</math> are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and <math>y</math> is the coordinate normal to the wall.\n\nFor turbulent boundary layer calculations, the time averaged density and velocity at the edge of the boundary layer must be used.  In the equations above, <math>\\rho_0</math> and <math>u_0</math> are therefore replaced with <math>\\rho_e</math> and <math>u_e</math>.\n\nThe displacement thickness is used to calculate the boundary layer's [[Shape factor (boundary layer flow)|shape factor]].\n\n== Momentum thickness ==\n\nThe '''momentum thickness''', '''θ''' or '''δ<sub>2</sub>''', is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved perpendicular from the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity <math>u_0</math> to give the same total momentum as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.<ref>Schlichting, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe definition of the momentum thickness for [[compressibility|compressible]] flow is based on mass flow rate:\n\n:<math> \\theta = \\int_0^\\infty {{\\rho(y) u(y)\\over \\rho_0 u_o} {\\left(1 - {u(y)\\over u_o}\\right)}} \\,\\mathrm{d}y </math>\n\nThe definition for [[compressibility|incompressible]] flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:\n\n:<math> \\theta = \\int_0^\\infty {{u(y)\\over u_o} {\\left(1 - {u(y)\\over u_o}\\right)}} \\,\\mathrm{d}y </math>\n\nWhere <math>\\rho_0</math> and <math>u_0</math> are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and <math>y</math> is the coordinate normal to the wall.\n\nFor turbulent boundary layer calculations, the time averaged density and velocity at the edge of the boundary layer must be used.  In the equations above, <math>\\rho_0</math> and <math>u_0</math> are therefore replaced with <math>\\rho_e</math> and <math>u_e</math>.\n\nFor a flat plate at zero [[angle of attack]] with a laminar boundary layer, the Blasius solution gives.<ref>Schlichting, p. 141.</ref>\n\n:<math> \\theta \\approx 0.664 \\sqrt{{\\nu x}\\over u_o}</math>\n\nThe influence of fluid [[viscosity]] creates a wall [[shear stress]], <math> \\tau_w </math>, which extracts energy from the mean flow.  The boundary layer can be considered to possess a total momentum flux deficit, due to the frictional [[dissipation]] given by:\n\n:<math> \\rho \\int_0^\\infty {u(y) \\left(u_o - u(y)\\right)} \\,\\mathrm{d}y. </math>\n\n== Energy thickness ==\n\nThe '''energy thickness''', <math>\\delta_3</math> , is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved parallel to itself towards the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity <math>u_0</math> to give the same total kinetic energy as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.<ref>Rosenhead, Louis, ed. Laminar boundary layers. Clarendon Press, 1963.</ref>\n\nThe definition of the energy thickness for [[compressibility|compressible]] flow is based on mass flow rate:\n\n:<math> \\delta_3 = \\int_0^\\infty {{\\rho(y) u(y)\\over \\rho_0 u_o} {\\left(1 - {u(y)^2\\over u_o^2}\\right)}} \\,\\mathrm{d}y </math>\n\nThe definition for [[compressibility|incompressible]] flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:\n\n:<math> \\delta_3 = \\int_0^\\infty {{u(y)\\over u_o} {\\left(1 - {u(y)^2\\over u_o^2}\\right)}} \\,\\mathrm{d}y </math>\n\nWhere <math>\\rho_0</math> and <math>u_0</math> are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and <math>y</math> is the coordinate normal to the wall.\n\n== Shape factor ==\n\nA '''shape factor''' is used in [[boundary layer flow]] to determine the nature of the flow.\n\n:<math>H = \\frac {\\delta^*}{\\theta}</math>\n\nwhere ''H'' is the shape factor, <math>\\delta^*</math> is the [[displacement thickness]] and ''θ'' is the [[momentum thickness]]. The higher the value of ''H'', the stronger the adverse [[pressure gradient]]. A high adverse pressure gradient can greatly reduce the [[Reynolds number]] at which transition into [[turbulence]] may occur.\n\nConventionally, ''H'' = 2.59 (Blasius boundary layer) is typical of laminar flows, while ''H'' = 1.3 - 1.4 is typical of turbulent flows.<ref>Schlichting, p. 454.</ref>\n\n== Moment Method ==\nA relatively new method<ref>Weyburne, 2006.</ref><ref>Weyburne, 2014.</ref> for describing the thickness and shape of the boundary layer utilizes the [[Moment (mathematics)|moment method]] commonly used to describe a random variable's [[probability distribution]].  The moment method was developed from the observation that the plot of the second derivative of the [[Blasius boundary layer]] for laminar flow over a plate looks very much like a Gaussian distribution curve.<ref>Weyburne, 2006, p. 1678.</ref>  It is straightforward to cast the properly scaled velocity profile and its first two derivatives into suitable integral kernels.\n\nThe velocity profiles central moments are defined as:\n:<math> {\\zeta_n}= \\int_0^\\infty {(y-m)^n {1\\over\\delta^*} (1-{u(y)\\over u_0}) \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nwhere the mean location is given by: \n:<math> m = \\int_0^\\infty { y {1\\over\\delta^*} (1-{u(y)\\over u_0}) \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nThere are some advantages to also include descriptions of moments of the boundary layer profile derivatives with respect to the height above the wall.  Consider the first derivative velocity profile central moments given by:\n:<math> {\\kappa_n} = \\int_0^\\infty { (y-{\\delta^*})^n {d u(y)/u_0 \\over dy} \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nwhere the mean location is the displacement thickness <math>\\delta^*</math>.\n\nFinally the second derivative velocity profile central moments are given by:\n:<math> {\\lambda_n} = \\int_0^\\infty { (y-{\\eta})^n {d^2 \\{-\\eta u(y)/u_0 \\} \\over dy^2} \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nwhere the mean location is given by:\n:<math> {\\eta} = {\\mu u_0 \\over \\tau_w}</math>\n \nWith the moments and the mean locations defined, the boundary layer thickness and shape can be described in terms of the boundary layer widths ([[variance]]), [[Skewness|skewnesses]], and excesses ([[Kurtosis|excess kurtosis]]).  Experimentally, it is found that the turbulent boundary layer thickness defined as <math>\\delta_m = m + 3\\sigma_m</math> where <math>\\sigma_m=\\zeta_2^{1/2}</math>, tracks the 99% thickness very well.<ref>Weyburne, 2014, p. 26.</ref>\n\nTaking a cue from the [[Boundary layer|boundary layer momentum balance equations]], the second derivative boundary layer moments, <math>{\\lambda_n}</math> track the thickness and shape of that portion of the boundary layer where the viscous forces are significant.  Hence the moment method makes it possible to track and quantify the inner viscous region using <math>{\\lambda_n}</math> moments whereas the outer region of the turbulent boundary layer is tracked using <math>{\\zeta_n}</math> and <math>{\\kappa_n}</math> moments.\n\nCalculation of the derivative moments without the need to take derivatives is simplified by using integration by parts to reduce the moments to simply integrals based on the displacement thickness kernel:\n:<math> {\\alpha_n}= \\int_0^\\infty {y^n (1-{u(y)\\over u_0}) \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\nThis means that the first derivative skewness, for example, can be calculated as:\n:<math>\\gamma_{1} = \\kappa_3/\\kappa_{2}^{3/2} = (2\\delta^{*3} - 6\\delta^* \\alpha_1 + 3\\alpha_3)/(-\\delta^{*2} + 2\\alpha_1)^{3/2} </math>    \nThis parameter was shown to track the boundary layer shape changes that accompany the laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition.<ref>Weyburne, 2014, p. 25.</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Rosenhead, Louis, ed.

In many ways, the thermal boundary layer description parallels the [[boundary layer|velocity (momentum) boundary layer]] description first conceptualized by [[Ludwig Prandtl]].<ref>L. Prandtl, “Über Flüssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung,” Verhandlungen des Dritten Internationalen Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg 1904, A. Krazer, ed., Teubner, Leipzig, (1905) 484–491.</ref>  Consider a fluid of uniform temperature <math>T_o</math> and velocity <math>u_o</math> impinging onto a stationary plate uniformly heated to a temperature <math>T_s</math>.  Assume the flow and the plate are semi-infinite in the positive/negative direction perpendicular to the <math>x-y</math> plane.  As the fluid flows along the wall, the fluid at the wall surface satisfies a [[no-slip boundary condition]] and has zero velocity, but as you move away from the wall, the velocity of the flow asymptotically approaches the free stream velocity <math>u_0</math>.  The temperature at the solid wall is <math>T_s</math> and gradually changes to <math>T_o</math> as one moves toward the free stream of the fluid.  It is impossible to define a sharp point at which the thermal boundary layer fluid or the velocity boundary layer fluid becomes the free stream, yet these layers have a well-defined characteristic thickness given by <math>\\delta_T</math> and <math>\\delta_v</math>.  The parameters below provide a useful definition of this characteristic, measurable thickness for the thermal boundary layer.  Also included in this boundary layer description are some parameters useful in describing the shape of the thermal boundary layer.\n\n== 99% Thermal Boundary Layer thickness ==\nThe '''thermal boundary layer thickness''', '''<math>\\delta_T</math>''',  is the distance across a boundary layer from the wall to a point where the flow temperature has essentially reached the 'free stream' temperature, <math>T_0</math>.  This distance is defined normal to the wall in the <math>y</math>-direction.  The thermal boundary layer thickness is customarily defined as the point in the boundary layer, <math>y_{99}</math>, where the temperature <math>T(x,y)</math> reaches 99% of the free stream value <math>T_0</math>:\n:<math>\\delta_T = y_{99}</math>   such that  <math>T(x,y_{99})</math> = 0.99 <math>T_0</math>\nat a position <math>x</math> along the wall.  In a real fluid, this quantity can be estimated by measuring the temperature profile at a position <math>x  \n</math> along the wall.  The temperature profile is the temperature as a function of <math>y</math> at a fixed <math>x</math> position.\n\nFor [[laminar flow]] over a flat plate a zero incidence, the thermal boundary layer thickness is given by:<ref>Schlichting, p. 307.</ref>\n:<math> \\delta_T = \\delta_v \\mathrm{Pr}^{-1/3}  </math>\n:<math> \\delta_T = 5.0 \\sqrt{ {\\nu  x}\\over u_0} \\mathrm{Pr}^{-1/3}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\mathrm{Pr}</math> is the [[Prandtl Number]]\n:<math>\\delta_v</math> is the thickness of the [[boundary layer thickness|velocity boundary layer thickness]] <ref>Schlichting, p.140.</ref>\n:<math>u_0</math> is the freestream velocity\n:<math>x</math> is the distance downstream from the start of the boundary layer\n:<math>\\nu</math> is the [[kinematic viscosity]]\n\nFor [[turbulent flow]] over a flat plate, the thickness of the thermal boundary layer that is formed is not determined by thermal diffusion, but instead, it is random fluctuations in the outer region of the boundary layer of the fluid that is the driving force determining thermal boundary layer thickness.  Thus the thermal boundary layer thickness for turbulent flow does not depend on the [[Prandtl number]] but instead on the [[Reynolds number]].  Hence, the turbulent thermal boundary layer thickness is given approximately by the turbulent velocity [[boundary layer thickness]] expression<ref>Schlichting, p. 638.</ref> given by:\n:<math> \\delta_T \\approx \\delta \\approx 0.37x/ {\\mathrm{Re}_x}^{1/5} </math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>{\\mathrm{Re}_x}= u_0 x/\\nu</math> is the [[Reynolds number]]\n\nThis turbulent boundary layer thickness formula assumes 1) the flow is turbulent right from the start of the boundary layer and 2) the turbulent boundary layer behaves in a geometrically similar manner (i.e. the velocity profiles are geometrically similar along the flow in the x-direction, differing only by stretching factors in <math>y</math> and <math>u(x,y)</math><ref>Schlichting, p.152.</ref>).  Neither one of these assumptions is true for the general turbulent boundary layer case so care must be exercised in applying this formula.\n\n== Thermal Displacement Thickness ==\n\nThe '''thermal displacement thickness''', '''<math>\\beta^*</math>''' may be thought of in terms of the difference between a real fluid and a hypothetical fluid with thermal diffusion turned off but with velocity <math>u_0</math> and temperature <math>T_0</math>.  With no thermal diffusion, the temperature drop is abrupt.  The thermal displacement thickness is the distance by which the hypothetical fluid surface would have to be moved in the <math>y</math>-direction to give the same integrated temperature as occurs between the wall and the reference plane at <math>\\delta_T</math> in the real fluid.  It is a direct analog to the velocity displacement thickness which is often described in terms of an equivalent shift of a hypothetical inviscid fluid (see Schlichting<ref>Schlichting, p. 140.</ref> for velocity displacement thickness).\n\nThe definition of the thermal displacement thickness for incompressible flow is based on the integral of the reduced temperature:\n\n:<math> {\\beta^*}= \\int_0^\\infty {\\theta(x,y) \\,\\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n \nwhere the dimensionless temperature is <math>\\theta(x,y) = (T(x,y)-T_0)/(T_s-T_0)</math>.  In a [[wind tunnel]], the velocity and temperature profiles are obtained by measuring the velocity and temperature at many discrete <math>y</math>-values at a fixed <math>x</math>-position.  The thermal displacement thickness can then be estimated by [[numerical integration|numerically integrating]] the scaled temperature profile.\n  \n== Moment Method ==\nA relatively new method<ref>Weyburne, 2006.</ref><ref>Weyburne, 2018.</ref> for describing the thickness and shape of the thermal boundary layer utilizes the [[Moment (mathematics)|moment method]] commonly used to describe a random variable's [[probability distribution]].  The moment method was developed from the observation that the plot of the second derivative of the thermal profile for laminar flow over a plate looks very much like a [[Gaussian distribution]] curve.<ref>Weyburne, 2006, p. 1680.</ref>  It is straightforward to cast the properly scaled thermal profile into a suitable integral kernel.\n\nThe thermal profile central moments are defined as:\n:<math> {\\kappa_n} = {1\\over\\beta^*}\\int_0^\\infty { (y- m_T)^n  \\theta(x,y) \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\nwhere the mean location, <math>m_T</math>, is given by: \n:<math> m_T = {1\\over\\beta^*}\\int_0^\\infty { y \\theta(x,y)  \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nThere are some advantages to also include descriptions of moments of the boundary layer profile derivatives with respect to the height above the wall.  Consider the first derivative temperature profile central moments given by:\n:<math> {\\epsilon_n} = \\int_0^\\infty { (y-{\\beta^*})^n {d \\theta(x,y) \\over dy} \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\nwhere the mean location is the thermal displacement thickness <math>\\beta^*</math>.\n\nFinally the second derivative temperature profile central moments are given by:\n:<math> {\\phi_n} = \\mu\\int_0^\\infty { (y-{\\mu})^n {d^2  \\theta(x,y) \\over dy^2} \\mathrm{d}y}</math>\nwhere the mean location, <math>\\mu</math>, is given by:\n:<math> {1 \\over \\mu} = -\\left( \\frac{d\\theta(x,y) }{d y}\\right)_{y=0}</math>\n  \nWith the moments and the thermal mean location defined, the boundary layer thickness and shape can be described in terms of the thermal boundary layer width ([[variance]]), thermal [[Skewness|skewnesses]], and thermal excess ([[Kurtosis|excess kurtosis]]).  For the Pohlhausen solution for laminar flow on a heated flat plate,<ref>Schlichting, p. 292.</ref> it is found that thermal boundary layer thickness defined as <math>\\delta_T = m_T + 4\\sigma_T</math> where <math>\\sigma_T=\\kappa_2^{1/2}</math>, tracks the 99% thickness very well.<ref>Weyburne, 2018, p. 5.</ref>  \n\nFor laminar flow, the three different moment cases all give similar values for the thermal boundary layer thickness.  For turbulent flow, the thermal boundary layer can be divided into a region near the wall where thermal diffusion is important and an outer region where thermal diffusion effects are mostly absent.  Taking a cue from the [[Boundary layer|boundary layer energy balance equation]], the second derivative boundary layer moments, <math>{\\phi_n}</math> track the thickness and shape of that portion of the thermal boundary layer where [[thermal diffusivity]] <math>{\\alpha }</math> is significant.  Hence the moment method makes it possible to track and quantify the region where thermal diffusivity is important using <math>{\\phi_n}</math> moments whereas the overall thermal boundary layer is tracked using <math>{\\epsilon_n}</math> and <math>{\\kappa_n}</math> moments.\n\nCalculation of the derivative moments without the need to take derivatives is simplified by using integration by parts to reduce the moments to simply integrals based on the thermal displacement thickness kernel:\n:<math> {k_n}= \\int_0^\\infty {y^n\\theta(x,y) \\,\\mathrm{d}y}</math>\nThis means that the second derivative skewness, for example, can be calculated as:\n:<math>\\gamma_{T} = \\phi_3/\\phi_2^{3/2} = (2\\mu^3 - 6\\beta^*\\mu^2 + 6\\mu k_1)/(-\\mu^2 + 2\\mu\\beta^*)^{3/2} </math>    \n\n== Further reading ==\n* Hermann Schlichting, ''Boundary-Layer Theory'', 7th ed., McGraw Hill, 1979.\n* Frank M.

Klebanoff is the first scientist who experimentally observed bypass transition scenario during his experiments in elevated free-stream turbulence flow. He identified an important aspect of the bypass transition. In his experiment, using hot wires he studied flow over a flat plate which was subjected to a 0.3% free-stream turbulence level. At this moderate free-stream turbulence level, he could observe a low-frequency velocity perturbation signal, that is less than 12 Hz which is much smaller than usual [[Tollmien-Schlichting wave]] frequency. He also observed thickening and thinning of [[Boundary layer thickness|boundary layer]] which is not in the case of low free-stream turbulence flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kenndal |first1= James M.|title=Experiments on Boundary Layer Receptivity to Free stream Turbulence |journal=AIAA |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.2514/6.1998-530|year= 1998}}</ref>\n==Pre-transitional flow structures==\nIn Bypass transition flow, the pre-transitional flow structures are quite different from those of very low turbulent intensity free-stream flow. From various laboratory experiments and computational studies, it has been observed that the low frequency streaky flow structures are present inside the laminar boundary layers. These streaky structures are called Klebanoff modes or simply K-modes since this was first experimentally observed by Klebanoff.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Matsubara |first1= M.|last2=Alfredsson |first2=P.

He discovered that when air was ejected from a rectangular nozzle, it would attach itself to an inclined flat plate connected to the nozzle exit. Emphasizing the need for a sharp angle between the nozzle and the flat plate, Coandă then applied the principle to a series of deflecting surfaces, each at a sharp angle to the previous one, and succeeded in turning flows through angles as large as 180. He stated that \"when a jet of fluid is passed over a curved surface, it bends to follow the surface, entraining large amounts of air as it does so,\" and this phenomenon has become known as the ''Coandă Effect''.

Blow on a part of the water and the pressure is increased a slight amount which naturally makes the water move away.   Direct a flame parallel over a liquid or submerge a candle almost to its wick and the liquid will be seen to rise slightly as the heat of the flame lessens the Atmospheric Press pressing on the water.\nThe hotter the flame and the closer to the surface the greater the effect will be seen.\n{{Citation\n | last=Young\n | first=Thomas\n | authorlink=Thomas Young (scientist)\n | title=Outlines of experiments and inquiries respecting sound and light\n | year=1800\n }}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA hundred years later, Henri Coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his [[Coandă-1910]] aircraft, which mounted an unusual engine he designed. The motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward, and Coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces. In 1934 Coandă obtained a patent in [[France]] for a \"method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid.\" The effect was described as the \"deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall.\" The first official documents that explicitly mention the Coandă effect were two 1936 patents by Henri Coandă.<ref>Coanda, H. \"US Patent# 2,052,869.\" Device for Deflecting a Stream of Elastic Fluid Projected into an Elastic Fluid (1936).</ref><ref>Coanda H.

The engine is approximately bullet or inverted bowl shaped, with fluid being expelled horizontally from a circular slit near the top of the bullet. A small step at the lower edge of the slit ensures that a low pressure vortex develops immediately below the point where the fluid exits the slit (see '''Diagram 5'''). From there on the Coandă effect causes the sheet of fluid to cling to the curved outer surface of the engine. The entrainment of the ambient fluid into the stream flowing over the bullet, causes a low pressure area above the bullet ('''Diagrams 1–5''') . This, together with the ambient (\"high\") pressure below the bullet causes lift, or, if mounted horizontally, forward motion in the direction of the apex of the bullet.<ref name=Reba />]]\n\nA free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an [[axisymmetrical]] \"tube\" or \"sleeve\" of low pressure around the jet (see '''Diagram 1'''). The resultant forces from this low pressure tube end up balancing any perpendicular flow instability, which stabilises the jet in a straight line. However, if a solid surface is placed close, and approximately parallel to the jet ('''Diagram 2'''), then the entrainment (and therefore removal) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that cannot be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the \"open\" side of the jet. The pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface, and then to adhere to it ('''Diagram 3''').<ref name=Reba /><ref name=Thermofluids>[http://www.thermofluids.co.uk/effect.php Coanda Effect] Retrieved 17 November 2017</ref> The jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ('''Diagram 4'''), because each (infinitesimally small) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface.<ref name=Thermofluids /><ref>[http://karmak.org/archive/2003/02/coanda_effect.html Jeff Raskin: Coanda Effect: Understanding how wings work.] Retrieved 17 November 2017</ref> If the surface is not too sharply curved, the jet can, under the right circumstances, adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface, and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction.

Coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a ''free jet'' or a ''wall jet''.\n\nOn the left image of the preceding section: \"The mechanism of Coanda effect\", the effect as described, in the terms of T. Young as \"the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle\", represents a ''free jet'' emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings. It includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access, without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle  in the surroundings, as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure.\n\nOn the right image, the effect occurs along the curved wall as a ''wall jet''. The image here on the right represents a ''two dimensional wall jet'' between two parallel plane walls, where the \"obstacle\" is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice, so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall, but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air.\n\n1. [[Wall jet]]. To compare experiment with a theoretical model, we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width ''h'' along a circular wall of radius ''r''. A wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall, say of infinite radius,or rather  whose radius is the radius of the Earth ''without separation'' because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall.\n[[File:Surface pressure of a wall jet along a circular wall.png|thumb|Measurements of surface pressure along a circularly curved wall of radius r = 12 cm, deflecting a [[turbulent]] jet of air ([[Reynolds number]] = 10<sup>6</sup>) of width h. The pressure begins to fall before the origin of the jet, due to local effects at the point of exit of the air from the nozzle which creates the jet. If the h/r ratio (ratio of the width of the jet to the radius of curvature of the wall) is less than 0.5, a true Coandă effect is observed, with the wall pressures along the curved wall remaining at this low (sub-ambient pressure) level until the jet reaches the end of the wall (when the pressure rapidly returns to ambient pressure). If the h/r ratio is more than 0.5, only the local effects occur at the origin of the jet, after which the jet immediately separates from the wall, and there is no Coandă effect. Experiments by M. Kadosch and J. Liermann in  M. Kadosch's  laboratory, SNECMA.<ref name=kadosh />]]\nWith a much smaller radius (12 centimeters in the image on the right) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet, creating a pressure gradient depending upon ''h/r'', the relative curvature. This pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and  after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises, and disappear at the point  where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall, where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure (and the transverse gradient becomes zero).\n\nExperiments made in 1956 with [[turbulent]] air jets at a [[Reynolds number]] of 10<sup>6</sup> at various  jet widths ({{mvar|h}}) show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall (radius {{mvar|r}}) at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet (see the diagram on the right).<ref name=kadosh>Kadosch M., ''Déviation d’un jet par adhérence à une paroi convexe'' in ''Journal de Physique et le Radium'', avril 1958, Paris, pp.1–12A</ref><ref name= Gersten>Kadosch M., ''\"The curved wall effect\"'' in 2nd Cranfield Fluidics Conference, Cambridge, 3 janvier 1967</ref>\n\nAbove a critical {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall. The jet then immediately separates from the curved wall. A Coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment:  a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9°, followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer, subject to this positive longitudinal gradient. However, if the {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5, the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall (until the wall ends –; see diagram on the right). This is \"a true Coandă effect\" as the jet clings to the wall \"at a nearly constant pressure\" as in a conventional wall jet.\n\nA calculation made by Woods in 1954<ref>L. C. Woods, ''Compressible subsonic flow in two-dimensional channels with mixed boundary conditions'', in ''Quart. Journ. Mech. And Applied Math.'', VII, 3, {{pp.|263–282}}, 1954</ref> of an [[inviscid]] flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall, where a singular point appears with an infinite  slope of the surface pressure curve. \n[[File:Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet.jpg|thumb|Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet]]\n\nIntroducing in the calculation  the angle at separation found in the preceding  experiments for each value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}}, the image here was recently obtained,<ref>Kadosch M., Illusions créatrices, CreateSpace & Kindle,2015, Ch. 8,  Coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs, {{pp.|91 to 112}}</ref> and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution: the calculated  pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above, outside the nozzle. The flow curvature is caused exclusively by the transverse pressure gradient, as described by T. Young. Then, viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall. According to Van Dyke,<ref>M. Van Dyke (1969), ''Higher-Order Boundary-Layer Theory'', Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics</ref> quoted in [[Lift (force)]] Wikipedia article, §10.3, the derivation of his equation (4c) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible.\n\nAn alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates. A rough calculation has been tried that gives the separation angle as a function of {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and the Reynolds number:<ref name = Gersten/> The results are reported on the image, e.g., 54° calculated instead of 60° measured for {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.25}}. More experiments and a more accurate boundary layer calculation would be desirable.\n\nOther experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that Coandă effect does not occur in a [[laminar flow]], and the critical h/r ratios for small Reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=T. |last1=Vit |first2=F. |last2=Marsik |title=Experimental and Theoretical Study of Heated Coandă Jet |journal=XXI International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics |date=August 15–21, 2004}}</ref> down to {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.14}} if {{math|1=Re=500}} and {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.05}} if {{math|1=Re=100}}.\n\n2. [[Free jet]]. L. C. Woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of  a free jet of width h, deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r, between a first contact A and separation at B, including a deflection angle θ. Again a solution exists for any value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and angle θ. \nMoreover, in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form, giving the distribution of  velocity along the circular wall. The surface pressure distribution is then calculated using Bernoulli equation. Let us note {{math|''p''<sub>a</sub>}} the pressure and {{math|''v''<sub>a</sub>}} the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure, and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in A and θ in B. Then the velocity {{mvar|v}} is found to be:\n:<math>\\frac{v}{v_a} = \\exp\\bigg[{2h \\over\\pi r} \\tan^{-1}\\bigg( \\big[{\\sinh^2 ({\\pi\\theta r \\over 4h}) - \\cosh^2({\\pi\\theta r \\over 4h}) \\tanh^2({\\pi\\gamma r \\over 4h})}\\big]^{1/2}\\bigg)\\bigg]</math>\n\nAn image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of  the relative curvature h/r, and the same angle θ as those  found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established: it may be found in reference (15) p.&nbsp;104 and both images are quite similar : Coanda effect of  a free jet is  inertial, the same as Coanda effect of a wall jet. However, an experimental measurement of the corresponding surface pressure distribution is not known.\n\nExperiments in 1959 by Bourque and Newmann<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bourque |first1=C. |last2=Newmann |first2=B. G. |title=Reattachment of a two-dimensional, incompressible jet to an adjacent flat Plate |journal=The Aeronautical Quarterly |volume=XI |date=August 1960 |pages=201 ''et seq''}}</ref> concerning the reattachment of a two-dimensional turbulent jet to an offset parallel plate after enclosing a separation bubble where a low pressure vortex is confined (as in the image 5 in the preceding section) and also for a two-dimensional jet followed by a single flat plate inclined at an angle instead of the circularly curved wall in the diagram on the right here describing the experience of a wall jet: the jet separates from the plate, then curves towards the plate when the surrounding fluid is entrained and pressure lowered, and eventually reattaches to it, enclosing a separation bubble. The jet remains free if the angle is greater than 62°.\n\nIn this last case which is the geometry  proposed by Coanda, the claim of the inventor is that the quantity of fluid entrained by the jet  from the surroundings is increased when the jet is deflected, a feature exploited to improve the scavenging of internal combustion engines, and to increase the maximum lift coefficient of a wing, as indicated in the applications below.\n\nThe surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases, and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble, the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice: the agreement with experiment was satisfactory.\n\n==Applications==\nThe Coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on [[aircraft]], where air moving over the wing can be \"bent down\" towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing. The bending of the flow results in [[aerodynamic lift]].<ref>\"Lift is a force generated by turning a moving fluid.\" Lift from Flow Turning NASA Glenn Research Center http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html</ref> The flow from a high speed jet engine mounted in a [[podded engines|pod]] over the wing produces increased lift by dramatically increasing the velocity [[gradient]] in the [[shear flow]] in the boundary layer. In this velocity gradient, particles are blown away from the surface, thus lowering the pressure there. Closely following the work of Coandă on applications of his research, and in particular the work on his \"Aerodina Lenticulară,\"<ref>[http://www.phys.ttu.edu/~cmyles/Phys5306/Talks/2004/Fluid%20Dynamics.ppt Fluid Dynamics by Mihaela-Maria Tanasescu, Texas Tech University]</ref>\n[[John Carver Meadows Frost|John Frost]] of [[Avro Canada]] also spent considerable time researching the effect, leading to a series of \"inside out\" [[hovercraft]]-like aircraft from which the air exited in a ring around the outside of the aircraft and was directed by being \"attached\" to a flap-like ring.\n[[File:Avrocar at factory.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The first Avrocar being readied at the Avro factory in 1958]]\nThis is as opposed to a traditional hovercraft design, in which the air is blown into a central area, the ''plenum'', and directed down with the use of a fabric \"skirt.\" Only one of Frost's designs was ever built, the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]].\n\nThe [[VZ-9 AV Avrocar]] (often listed as '''VZ-9''') was a Canadian [[vertical takeoff and landing|vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)]] aircraft developed by [[Avro Canada|Avro Aircraft Ltd.]] as part of a secret United States military project carried out in the early years of the [[Cold War]].<ref>Yenne 2003, pp. 281–283.</ref> The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single \"turborotor\" blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated [[VTOL]]-like performance. In the air, it would have resembled a [[flying saucer]]. Two prototypes were built as \"proof-of-concept\" test vehicles for a more advanced [[USAF|U.S. Air Force]] fighter and also for a [[U.S. Army]] tactical combat aircraft requirement.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Milberry 1979, p. 137.</ref>\n\nAvro's 1956 [[Project 1794]] for the US military designed a larger-scale flying saucer based on the Coandă effect and intended to reach speeds between Mach 3 and Mach 4.<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/137505-us-air-forces-1950s-supersonic-flying-saucer-declassified, US Air Force's 1950s supersonic flying saucer declassified]</ref> Project documents remained classified until 2012.\n \nThe effect was also implemented during the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport|AMST]] project. Several aircraft, notably the [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]] (the first modern type to exploit the effect), NASA's  [[Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft]], and the [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan]]'s [[Kawasaki C-1|Asuka]] research aircraft have been built to take advantage of this effect, by mounting [[turbofan]]s on the top of the wings to provide high-speed air even at low flying speeds, but to date only one aircraft has gone into production using this system to a major degree, the [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-72|An-72 \"Coaler.\"]] The [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] flying boat utilizes a similar system, only it directs the propwash from its four turboprop engines over the top of the wing to generate low-speed lift. More uniquely, it incorporates a fifth turboshaft engine inside of the wing center-section solely to provide air for powerful [[blown flap]]s. The addition of these two systems gives the aircraft an impressive STOL capability.\n[[Image:NOTAR System.svg|thumb|left|300 px|A Coandă engine (items 3,6–8) replaces the tail rotor in the [[NOTAR]] helicopter.

This is not an engineering drawing, but a somewhat exaggerated diagram to emphasize the major points.]]\n[[Image:C-17 no169 landing.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|The [[C-17 Globemaster III]] uses the Coandă effect in the same way as the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] (depicted on the right), but with additional use of the exhaust from the engines over the upper surfaces of the wings to cause lift for a comfortable ride at low flying speeds]]\n\nThe [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] and its successor, the Boeing [[C-17 Globemaster III]], also employ the effect. The [[NOTAR]] helicopter replaces the conventional [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] tail rotor with a Coandă effect tail (diagram on the left).\n\nA milestone in the direction of a better understanding of Coandă effect has been the large scientific literature produced by ACHEON EU FP7 project<ref>ACHEON-Aerial Coanda High Efficiency Orienting jet Nozzle, European Commission, Project reference: 309041, Funded under: FP7.\" TRANSPORT (2011).</ref> This project about a particular symmetric nozzle produced an effective modeling of Coandă effect;<ref>Trancossi M. , et al. \"Design methods of Coanda effect nozzle with two streams.\" INCAS Bulletin 6.1 (2014): 83. http://bulletin.incas.ro/files/trancossi__dumas__das__pascua__vol_6_iss_1.pdf</ref> Das et al., .<ref>Das, Shyam, et al. \"Numerical modeling of Coanda effect in a novel propulsive system.\" The International Journal of Multiphysics 8.2 (2014): 181–202.</ref><ref>Subhash, Maharshi, and Antonio Dumas. \"Computational study of Coanda adhesion over curved surface.\" SAE International Journal of Aerospace 6.2013-01-2302 (2013): 260–272.</ref> It has been possible to determine innovative STOL aircraft configurations based on Coanda effect,<ref>Trancossi, Michele, et al. \"A new aircraft architecture based on the ACHEON Coanda effect nozzle: flight model and energy evaluation.\" European Transport Research Review 8.2 (2016): 1–21. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12544-016-0198-4</ref><ref name=\"Das, Shyam S. 2015\">Das, Shyam S., et al. \"Computational Fluid Dynamic Study on a Novel Propulsive System: ACHEON and Its Integration with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).\" Journal of Aerospace Engineering 29.1 (2015): 04015015.</ref> This activity has been expanded by Dragan in the turbomachinery sector, with the objective of better optimizing the shape of rotating blades by Rumanian Comoti Research Centre's work on turbomachinery.<ref>Dragan, V.

Due to the slope, the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing, and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the Coandă effect, the water flows through the screen to the [[penstock]]s leading the water to the turbines.\n\nThe Coandă effect is used in dual-pattern fluid dispensers in automobile windshield washers.<ref>{{patent|US|4210283|\"Dual pattern windshield washer nozzle\"}}</ref>\n  \nThe operation principle of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two \"islands.\" Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes under one of the islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but in the direction of the second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.<ref>Spitzer, David W. \"Industrial Flow measurement.\" Instrument Society of America, 1990.</ref>\n\nIn [[air conditioning]], the Coandă effect is exploited to increase the [[throw (engineering)|throw]] of a ceiling mounted [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]]. Because the Coandă effect causes air discharged from the diffuser to \"stick\" to the ceiling, it travels farther before dropping for the same discharge velocity than it would if the diffuser were mounted in free air, without the neighbouring ceiling. Lower discharge velocity means lower noise levels and, in the case of [[variable air volume]] (VAV) air conditioning systems, permits greater [[turndown ratio]]s. [[Linear diffuser]]s and [[slot diffuser]]s that present a greater length of contact with the ceiling exhibit a greater Coandă effect.\n\nIn [[cardiovascular medicine]], the Coandă effect accounts for the separate streams of blood in the [[fetal]] right [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]].<ref>Ashrafian H. The Coandă effect and preferential right atrial streaming.\nChest. 2006 Jul;130(1):300.</ref> It also explains why eccentric [[mitral regurgitation]] jets are attracted and dispersed along adjacent left atrial wall surfaces (so called \"wall-hugging jets\" as seen on echocardiographic color-doppler interrogation). This is clinically relevant because the visual area (and thus severity) of these eccentric wall-hugging jets is often underestimated compared to the more readily apparent central jets. In these cases, volumetric methods such as the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method are preferred to quantify the severity of [[mitral regurgitation]].\n\nIn medicine, the Coandă effect is used in ventilators.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/6/859.full | doi=10.1093/bja/aen111| pmid=18483115| title=Coanda effect as an explanation for unequal ventilation of the lungs in an intubated patient?| journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia| volume=100| issue=6| pages=859–860| year=2008| last1=Qudaisat| first1=I.Y.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fluidic+ventilator | title=Fluidic ventilator}}</ref><ref>http://www.japi.org/june_2009/16_MP_Anaestheisa_and_Critical_Care.pdf</ref>\n\nIn [[meteorology]], the Coandă effect theory has also been applied to some air streams flowing out of mountain ranges such as the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and [[Transylvanian Alps]], where effects on agriculture and vegetation have been noted. It also appears to be an effect in the [[Rhone Valley]] in France and near [[Big Delta]] in Alaska.<ref>Giles, B.D. Fluidics, The Coandă Effect, and some orographic winds. Arch.Met.Geoph.Biokl. Ser.A. 25, 1977, 273–279</ref>\n\nIn [[Formula One]] automobile racing, the Coandă effect has been exploited by the McLaren, Sauber, Ferrari and Lotus teams, after the first introduction by Adrian Newey (Red Bull Team) in 2011, to help redirect exhaust gases to run through the rear diffuser with the intention of increasing downforce at the rear of the car.<ref>[http://www.formula1.com/news/technical/2012/0/939.html Formula 1]</ref> Due to changes in regulations set in place by the [[FIA]] from the beginning of the [[2014 Formula One season]], the intention of redirecting exhaust gases to use the Coandă effect have been negated, due to the mandatory requirement that the car exhaust must not have bodywork directly behind the exit for use of aerodynamic effect.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/12877/ | title=Latest News}}</ref>\n\nIn [[fluidics]], the Coandă effect was used to build [[bistable multivibrator]]s, where the working stream (compressed air) stuck to one curved wall or another and control beams could switch the stream between the walls.\n\nThe Coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a '''Coandă effect mixer'''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.|date=2004|title=A novel in-plane passive microfluidic mixer with modified Tesla structures|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=4|issue=2|pages=109–13|doi=10.1039/b305892a|pmid=15052349|issn=1473-0197}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|title=A Novel In-Plane Passive Micromixer Using Coanda Effect|date=2001|work=Micro Total Analysis Systems 2001|pages=31–33|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401038935|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1015-3_11}}</ref>\n\n== Practical demonstration ==\nThe Coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball. The jet is drawn to and follows the upper surface of the ball curving around it, due to the (radial) acceleration (slowing and turning) of the air around the ball. With enough airflow, this change in [[momentum]] is balanced by the equal and opposite force on the ball supporting its weight.  This demonstration can be performed using a vacuum cleaner if the outlet can be attached to the pipe and aimed upwards at an angle.\n\nA common misconception is that Coandă effect is demonstrated when a stream of tap water flows over the back of a spoon held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream (for example, Massey in \"Mechanics of Fluids\"<ref>\"Mechanics of Fluids, 4th edition 1979, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-442-30245-2}}, Fig, 3.12</ref> uses the Coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder). While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coandă effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water). This particular demonstration is dominated by [[surface tension]]. (McLean in \"Understanding Aerodynamics\"<ref>\"Understanding Aerodynamics Arguing from the Real Physics\" Doug McLean, 2013, John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Chichester, {{ISBN|978-1-119-96751-4}}, Figure 7.3.6</ref> states that the water deflection \"actually demonstrates molecular attraction and surface tension.\")\n\nAnother demonstration is to direct the air flow from, e.g., a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse, tangentially past a round cylinder. A waste basket works well. The air flow seems to \"wrap around\" the cylinder and can be detected at more than 180° from the incoming flow. Under the right conditions, flow rate, weight of the cylinder, smoothness of the surface it sits on, the cylinder actually moves. Note that the cylinder does not move directly into the flow as a misapplication of the Bernoulli effect would predict, but at a diagonal.\n\nThe effect can also be seen by placing a can in front of a lit candle. If one blows directly at the can, the air bends around it and extinguishes the candle.\n\n==Problems caused==\nThe engineering use of Coandă effect has disadvantages as well as advantages.\n\nIn marine propulsion, the efficiency of a [[propeller]] or [[Bow thruster|thruster]] can be severely curtailed by the Coandă effect. The force on the vessel generated by a propeller is a function of the speed, volume and direction of\nthe water jet leaving the propeller. Under certain conditions (e.g., when a ship moves through water) the Coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet, causing it to follow the shape of the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The side force from a [[bow thruster|tunnel thruster]] at the bow of a ship decreases rapidly with forward speed.<ref>\nThis problem can be solved by an accurate design of both the propeller and the hull that is specifically optimized on a fluiddynamic point of view.\n{{Citation\n | last=Lehn\n | first=E.\n | title=Practical methods for estimation of thrust losses\n | year=1992\n | publisher=Marintek (Norwegian Marine Technology Research Institute)\n | place=Trondheim, Norway\n | id=report number 513003.00.06\n}}\n</ref> The side thrust may completely disappear at speeds above about 3 knots.<ref>\n{{Citation\n | last=Clarke\n | first=I.

In the Blasius solution, m = 0 corresponding to an angle of attack of zero radians.

Boundary layers can be either [[laminar flow|laminar]] or [[turbulent flow|turbulent]]. A reasonable assessment of whether the boundary layer will be laminar or turbulent can be made by calculating the [[Reynolds number]] of the local flow conditions.\n\n'''Flow separation''' occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an [[adverse pressure gradient]] that the speed of the boundary layer relative to the object falls almost to zero.<ref>Anderson, John D. (2004), ''Introduction to Flight'', Section 4.20 (5th edition)</ref><ref>[[L. J. Clancy]] (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', Section 4.14</ref> The fluid flow becomes detached from the surface of the object, and instead takes the forms of [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] and [[vortex|vortices]]. In [[aerodynamics]], flow separation can often result in increased [[drag (physics)|drag]], particularly [[pressure drag]] which is caused by the [[pressure]] differential between the front and rear surfaces of the object as it travels through the air. For this reason much effort and research has gone into the design of [[aerodynamic]] and [[hydrodynamic]] surfaces which delay flow separation and keep the local flow attached for as long as possible. Examples of this include the fur on a tennis ball, dimples on a golf ball, [[turbulator]]s on a glider, which induce an early transition to turbulent flow regime; [[vortex generator]]s on light aircraft, for controlling the separation pattern; and [[leading edge extension]]s for high [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] on the wings of aircraft such as the [[F/A-18 Hornet]].\n\n'''Boundary layer separation''' is the detachment of a boundary layer from the surface into a broader wake.<ref>White (2010), \"Fluid Mechanics\", Section 7.1 (7th edition)</ref> Boundary layer separation occurs when the portion of the boundary layer closest to the wall or leading edge reverses in flow direction. The separation point is defined as the point between the forward and backward flow, where the shear stress is zero. The overall boundary layer initially thickens suddenly at the separation point and is then forced off the surface by the reversed flow at its bottom.<ref name=\"Wilcox, David C 2007\">Wilcox, David C.

The last profile represents reverse flow which shows separated flow.]]\n\nThe flow reversal is primarily caused by [[adverse pressure gradient]] imposed on the boundary layer by the outer [[potential flow]]. The streamwise momentum equation inside the boundary layer is approximately stated as\n\n:<math>u {\\partial u \\over \\partial s} = -{1 \\over \\rho}{dp \\over ds} + {\\nu} {\\partial^2 u \\over \\partial y^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>s,y</math> are streamwise and normal coordinates.\nAn adverse pressure gradient is when <math>dp/ds > 0</math>, which then can be seen to cause the velocity <math>u</math> to decrease along <math>s</math> and possibly go to zero if the adverse pressure gradient is strong enough.<ref>Balmer, David (2003) [http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/johnc/teaching/fluidmechanics4/2003-04/fluids14/separation.html Separation of Boundary Layers], from School of Engineering and Electronics,  [[University of Edinburgh]]</ref>\n\n==Influencing parameters==\nThe tendency of a boundary layer to separate primarily depends on the distribution of the adverse or negative\nedge velocity gradient <math>du_o/ds (s) < 0 </math> along the surface, which in turn is directly related to the pressure and its gradient by the differential form of the [[Bernoulli principle|Bernoulli relation]],\nwhich is the same as the momentum equation for the outer inviscid flow.\n\n:<math>\\rho u_o {du_o \\over ds} = -{dp \\over ds}</math>\n\nBut the general magnitudes of <math>du_o/ds</math> required for separation are much greater for [[turbulence|turbulent]] than for [[Laminar flow|laminar]] flow, the former being able to tolerate nearly an order of magnitude stronger flow deceleration. A secondary influence is the [[Reynolds number]]. For a given adverse <math>du_o/ds</math> distribution, the separation resistance of a turbulent boundary layer increases slightly with increasing Reynolds number. In contrast, the separation resistance of a laminar boundary layer is independent of Reynolds number — a somewhat counterintuitive fact.\n\n==Internal separation==\nBoundary layer separation can occur for internal flows. It can result from such causes such as a rapidly expanding duct of pipe. Separation occurs due to an adverse pressure gradient encountered as the flow expands, causing an extended region of separated flow. The part of the flow that separates the recirculating flow and the flow through the central region of the duct is called the dividing streamline.<ref name=\"Wilcox, David C 2007\" /> The point where the dividing streamline attaches to the wall again is called the reattachment point. As the flow goes farther downstream it eventually achieves an equilibrium state and has no reverse flow.\n\n==Effects of boundary layer separation==\nWhen the boundary layer separates, its [[displacement thickness]] increases sharply, which modifies the outside [[potential flow]] and pressure field. In the case of airfoils, the pressure field modification results in an increase in [[pressure drag]], and if severe enough will also result in  [[stall (flight)|stall]] and loss of lift, all of which are undesirable. For internal flows, flow separation produces an increase in the flow losses, and stall-type phenomena such as [[compressor stall|compressor surge]], both undesirable phenomena.<ref>Fielding, Suzanne. \"Laminar Boundary Layer Separation.\" 27 October 2005.

When the vortices begin to shed from the bounded surface of a structure they do so at a certain frequency. The shedding of the vortices then could cause vibrations in the structure. If the frequency of shedding these vortices reaches the [[resonance frequency]] of the structure, it could cause serious structural failures.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerodynamics]]\n* [[D'Alembert's paradox]]\n* [[Magnus effect]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n==References==\n* Anderson, John D.

If the boundary layer is thin compared to the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the wall, the pressure remains constant across the boundary layer. On the other hand, if the boundary layer thickness is comparable to the radius of curvature, the centrifugal action creates a pressure variation across the boundary layer. This leads to the centrifugal instability (Görtler instability) of the boundary layer and consequent formation of Görtler vortices.\n\n==Görtler number==\nThe onset of Görtler vortices can be predicted using the [[dimensionless number]] called '''Görtler number''' ('''G''').

      "text": "{{short description|Process of fluid flow becoming turbulent}}\n[[File:Laminar-turbulent transition.jpg|thumb|The plume from an ordinary candle transitions from laminar to turbulent flow in this [[Schlieren photograph]].]]\nThe process of a [[Laminar flow|laminar]] flow becoming [[turbulent]] is known as '''laminar–turbulent transition'''. The main parameter characterizing transition is the [[Reynolds number]].\n\nTransition is often described as a process proceeding through a series of stages.  \"Transitional flow\" can refer to transition in either direction, that is laminar–turbulent transitional or turbulent–laminar transitional flow.\n\nThe process applies to any fluid flow, and is most often used in the context of [[boundary layer]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Reynolds fluid turbulence experiment 1883.jpg|thumb|Reynolds’ 1883 experiment on fluid dynamics in pipes]]\n[[File:Reynolds observations turbulence 1883.svg|thumb|Reynolds’ 1883 observations of the nature of the flow in his experiments]]\nIn 1883 [[Osborne Reynolds]] demonstrated the transition to turbulent flow in a classic experiment in which he examined the behaviour of water flow under different flow rates using a small jet of dyed water introduced into the centre of flow in a larger pipe.\n\nThe larger pipe was glass, so the behaviour of the layer of dyed flow could be observed, and at the end of this pipe was a flow-control valve used to vary the water velocity inside the tube.  When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this happened was the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow. Reynolds identified the governing parameter for the onset of this effect, which was a dimensionless constant later called the [[Reynolds number]].\n\nReynolds found that the transition occurred between Re&nbsp;=&nbsp;2000 and 13000, depending on the smoothness of the entry conditions. When extreme care is taken, the transition can even happen with Re as high as 40000. On the other hand, Re&nbsp;=&nbsp;2000 appears to be about the lowest value obtained at a rough entrance.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Fung, Y.

His final theoretical model published in the mid-1890s is still the standard mathematical framework used today. Examples of titles from his more groundbreaking reports are:\n:''Improvements in Apparatus for Obtaining Motive Power from Fluids and also for Raising or Forcing Fluids'' (1875)\n:''An experimental investigation of the circumstances which determine whether the motion of water in parallel channels shall be direct or sinuous and of the law of resistance in parallel channels'' (1883)\n:''On the dynamical theory of incompressible viscous fluids and the determination of the criterion'' (1895)\n\n==Transition stages in a boundary layer==\n[[File:Path to transition.png|thumb|alt=Morkovin's path to transition|The path from receptivity to laminar-turbulent transition as illustrated by Morkovin, 1994.<ref>Morkovin M. V., Reshotko E., Herbert T. 1994. \"Transition in open flow systems—a reassessment\". ''Bull. Am. Phys. Soc.'' 39:1882.</ref>]]\n\nA boundary layer can transition to turbulence through a number of paths. Which path is realized physically depends on the initial conditions such as initial disturbance amplitude and surface roughness. The level of understanding of each phase varies greatly, from near complete understanding of primary mode growth to a near-complete lack of understanding of [[Bypass Transition|bypass mechanisms]].\n\n===Receptivity===\nThe initial stage of the natural transition process is known as the Receptivity phase and consists of the transformation of environmental disturbances – both acoustic (sound) and [[Vorticity|vortical]] (turbulence) – into small perturbations within the boundary layer. The mechanisms by which these disturbances arise are varied and include freestream sound and/or turbulence interacting with surface curvature, shape discontinuities and surface roughness. These initial conditions are small, often unmeasurable perturbations to the basic state flow. From here, the growth (or decay) of these disturbances depends on the nature of the disturbance and the nature of the basic state. Acoustic disturbances tend to excite two-dimensional instabilities such as [[Tollmien–Schlichting wave]]s (T-S waves), while vortical disturbances tend to lead to the growth of three-dimensional phenomena such as the [[crossflow instability]].<ref>Saric W. S., Reed H. L., Kerschen E. J. 2002. \"Boundary-layer receptivity to freestream disturbances\". ''Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.'' 34:291–319.</ref>\n\nNumerous experiments in recent decades have revealed that the extent of the amplification region, and hence the location of the transition point on the body surface, is strongly dependent not only upon the amplitude and/or the spectrum of external disturbances but also on their physical nature. Some of the disturbances easily penetrate into the boundary layer whilst others do not. Consequently, the concept of boundary layer transition is a complex one and still lacks a complete theoretical exposition.\n\n===Primary mode growth===\nIf the initial, environmentally-generated disturbance is small enough, the next stage of the transition process is that of primary mode growth. In this stage, the initial disturbances grow (or decay) in a manner described by [[hydrodynamic stability|linear stability theory]].<ref>Mack L. M. 1984. \"Boundary-layer linear stability theory\". ''AGARD Rep. No. 709''.</ref> The specific instabilities that are exhibited in reality depend on the geometry of the problem and the nature and amplitude of initial disturbances. Across a range of [[Reynolds number]]s in a given flow configuration, the most amplified modes can and often do vary.\n\nThere are several major types of instability which commonly occur in boundary layers. In subsonic and early supersonic flows, the dominant two-dimensional instabilities are T-S waves. For flows in which a three-dimensional boundary layer develops such as a swept wing, the [[crossflow instability]] becomes important. For flows navigating concave surface curvature, [[Görtler vortices]] may become the dominant instability. Each instability has its own physical origins and its own set of control strategies - some of which are contraindicated by other instabilities – adding to the difficulty in controlling laminar-turbulent transition.\n\n====Simple harmonic boundary layer sound in the physics of transition to turbulence====\n\nSimple harmonic sound as a precipitating factor in the sudden transition from laminar to turbulent flow might be attributed to Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Her poem, Aurora Leigh (1856), revealed how musical notes (the pealing of a particular church bell), triggered wavering turbulence in the previously steady laminar-flow flames of street gaslights (“...gaslights tremble in the streets and squares”: Hair 2016). Her instantly acclaimed poem might have alerted scientists (e.g., Leconte 1859) to the influence of simple harmonic (SH) sound as a cause of turbulence. A contemporary flurry of scientific interest in this effect culminated in Sir John Tyndall (1867) deducing that specific SH sounds, directed perpendicular to the flow had waves that blended with similar SH waves created by friction along the boundaries of tubes, amplifying them and triggering the phenomenon of high-resistance turbulent flow.  His interpretation re-surfaced over 100 years later (Hamilton 2015).\n\nTollmien (1931) and Schlichting (1929) proposed that friction (viscosity) along a smooth flat boundary, created SH boundary layer (BL) oscillations that gradually increased in amplitude until turbulence erupted. Although contemporary wind tunnels failed to confirm the theory, Schubauer and Skramstad (1943) created a refined wind tunnel that deadened the vibrations and sounds that might impinge on the wind tunnel flat plate flow studies. They confirmed the development of SH long-crested BL oscillations, the dynamic shear waves of transition to turbulence. They showed that specific SH fluttering vibrations induced electromagnetically into a BL ferromagnetic ribbon could amplify similar flow-induced SH BL flutter (BLF) waves, precipitating turbulence at much lower flow rates. Furthermore, certain other specific frequencies interfered with the development of the SH BLF waves, preserving laminar flow to higher flow rates.\n\nAn oscillation of a mass in a fluid is a vibration that creates a sound wave. SH BLF oscillations in boundary layer fluid along a flat plate must produce SH sound that reflects off the boundary perpendicular to the fluid laminae. In late transition, Schubauer and Skramstad found foci of amplification of BL oscillations, associated with bursts of noise (“turbulent spots”). Focal amplification of the transverse sound in late transition was associated with BL vortex formation.\n\nThe focal amplified sound of turbulent spots along a flat plate with high energy oscillation of molecules perpendicularly through the laminae, might suddenly cause localized freezing of laminar slip. The sudden braking of “frozen” spots of fluid would transfer resistance to the high resistance at the boundary, and might explain the head-over-heels BL vortices of late transition. Osborne Reynolds described similar turbulent spots during transition in water flow in cylinders (“flashes of turbulence,” 1883).\n\nWhen many random vortices erupt as turbulence onsets, the generalized freezing of laminar slip (laminar interlocking) is associated with noise and a dramatic increase in resistance to flow. This might also explain the parabolic isovelocity profile of laminar flow abruptly changing to the flattened profile of turbulent flow – as laminar slip is replaced by laminar interlocking as turbulence erupts (Hamilton 2015).\n\n<ref>E.

As the primary modes grow and distort the mean flow, they begin to exhibit nonlinearities and linear theory no longer applies. Complicating the matter is the growing distortion of the mean flow, which can lead to inflection points in the velocity profile a situation shown by [[Lord Rayleigh]] to indicate absolute instability in a boundary layer. These secondary instabilities lead rapidly to breakdown. These secondary instabilities are often much higher in frequency than their linear precursors.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Transition modeling]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Laminar to turbulent flow transition}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laminar-turbulent transition}}\n[[Category:Boundary layers]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Chaos theory]]\n[[Category:Turbulence]]\n[[Category:Transport phenomena]]\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]"

In such a case, owing to the very great expansion ratio, the exhaust mixture will be at a relatively low temperature and suitable for admission to the condenser.\n\nAll the plates and washers are fitted on and keyed to a sleeve threaded at the ends and equipped with nuts and collars for drawing the thick end-plates together, or the collars may be simply forced onto it and the ends upset. The sleeve has a hole fitting snugly on the shaft, to which it is fastened as usual.\n\nThis construction permits free expansion and contraction of each plate individually under the varying influence of heat and centrifugal force and possesses a number of other advantages, which are of considerable practical importance. A larger active plate area and consequently more power is obtained for a given width, improving efficiency. Warping is virtually eliminated, and smaller side clearances may be used, which results in diminished leakage and friction losses. The rotor is better adapted for dynamic balancing and through rubbing friction resists disturbing influences thereby ensuring quieter running. For this reason and also because the discs are not rigidly joined, it is protected against damage which might otherwise be caused by vibration or excessive speed.\n\n<!-- This image is original -->\n[[File:Tesla turbine system.png|thumb|right|330px|View of Tesla turbine system]]\n\nThe Tesla turbine has the trait of being in an installation normally working with a mixture of steam and products of combustion and in which the exhaust heat is used to provide steam supplied to the turbine, providing a valve governing the supply of the steam so that the pressures and temperatures can be adjusted to the optimal working conditions.\n\nAs diagrammed, a Tesla turbine installation is:\n# Able to start with steam alone.\n# A disc type adapted to work with fluids at high temperature.\n\nAn efficient Tesla turbine requires close spacing of the disks. For example, a steam-powered type must maintain 0.4-millimeter (0.016&nbsp;inch) inter-disk spacing. The disks must be extremely smooth to minimize surface and shear losses. Disks must also be very thin to prevent drag and turbulence at disk edges. Unfortunately, preventing disks from warping and distorting was a major challenge in Tesla's time. It is thought that this inability to prevent the disks distorting contributed to the commercial failure of the turbines, because metallurgical technology at the time was not able to produce disks of sufficient quality and rigidity.\n\n== Pump ==\nThe device can function as a pump if a similar set of disks and a housing with an [[involute]] shape (versus circular for the turbine) are used. In this configuration a motor is attached to the shaft. The fluid enters near the center, is given energy by the disks, then exits at the periphery. The Tesla turbine does not use friction in the conventional sense;  precisely, it avoids it and uses adhesion (the [[Coandă effect]]) and [[viscosity]] instead. It uses the [[boundary-layer]] effect on the disc blades.\n\nSmooth rotor disks were originally proposed, but these gave poor starting torque. Tesla subsequently discovered that smooth rotor disks with small washers bridging the disks in ~12–24 places around the perimeter of a 10″ disk and a second ring of 6–12 washers at a sub-diameter made for a significant improvement in starting torque without compromising efficiency.\n\n== Applications ==\nTesla's patents state that the device was intended for the use of [[fluid]]s as motive agents, as distinguished from the application of the same for the propulsion or [[compression (physical)|compression]] of fluids (though the device can be used for those purposes as well). As of 2016, the Tesla turbine has not seen widespread commercial use since its invention. The Tesla pump, however, has been commercially available since 1982<ref>[http://www.discflo.com/history.htm Discflo Disc Pump Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214220002/http://www.discflo.com/history.htm |date=February 14, 2009 }}</ref> and is used to pump fluids that are abrasive, viscous, shear sensitive, contain solids, or are otherwise difficult to handle with other pumps. Tesla himself did not procure a large contract for production. The main drawback in his time, as mentioned, was the poor knowledge of [[materials science|materials characteristics]] and behaviors at high [[temperature]]s. The best [[metallurgy]] of the day could not prevent the turbine disks from moving and warping unacceptably during operation.\n\nIn 2003, [[Scott O’Hearen]] took a patent on the Radial turbine blade system. This invention utilizes a combination of the concepts of a smooth runner surface for working fluid frictional contact and that of blades projecting axially from plural transverse runner faces.<ref>[http://greenif.com/links.html Author, Harikishan Gupta E., & Author, Shyam P.

The issue of the warping of the discs has been partially solved using new materials such as carbon fiber.\n\nOne proposed current application for the device is a [[Pump|waste pump]], in factories and mills where normal [[stator|vane]]-type [[turbine]] pumps typically get blocked.\n\nApplications of the Tesla turbine as a multiple-disk centrifugal [[ventricular assist device|blood pump]] have yielded promising results.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/10.46255 | last1 = Miller | first1 = G.

At the time of introduction, modern ship turbines were massive and included dozens, or even hundreds of stages of turbines, yet produced extremely low efficiency due to their low speed. For example, the turbine on the Titanic weighed over 400 tons, ran at just 165rpm, and used steam at a pressure of only 6 PSI. This limited it to harvesting waste steam from the main power plants, a pair of reciprocating steam engines.<ref>Titanic: Building the World's Most Famous Ship\nBy Anton Gill, P121</ref> The Tesla turbine also had the ability to run on higher temperature gasses than bladed turbines of the time contributed to its greater efficiency. Eventually axial turbines were given gearing to allow them to operate at higher speeds, but efficiency of axial turbines remained very low in comparison to the Tesla Turbine.\n\nAs time went on, competing Axial turbines became dramatically more efficient and powerful, a second stage of reduction gears was introduced in most cutting edge U.S. naval ships of the 1930s. The improvement in steam technology gave the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers a clear advantage in speed over both Allied and enemy aircraft carriers, and so the proven axial steam turbines became the preferred form of propulsion until the 1973 oil embargo took place. The oil crisis drove the majority of new civilian vessels to turn to diesel engines. Axial steam turbines still had not exceeded 50% efficiency by that time, and so civilian ships chose to utilize diesel engines due to their superior efficiency.<ref>The Design of High-Efficiency Turbomachinery and Gas Turbines, David Gordon Wilson, P.15</ref> By this time, the comparably efficient Tesla turbine was over 60 years old.\n[[File:Tesla-Turbine-Testing.png|right]]\n\nTesla's design attempted to sidestep the key drawbacks of the bladed axial turbines, and even the lowest estimates for efficiency still dramatically outperformed the efficiency of axial steam turbines of the day. However, in testing against more modern engines, the Tesla Turbine had expansion efficiencies far below contemporary steam turbines and far below contemporary reciprocating steam engines.  It does suffer from other problems such as shear losses and flow restrictions, but this is partially offset by the relatively massive reduction in weight and volume. Some of Tesla turbine's advantages lie in relatively low flow rate applications or when small applications are called for. The disks need to be as thin as possible at the edges in order not to introduce turbulence as the fluid leaves the disks. This translates to needing to increase the number of disks as the flow rate increases. Maximum efficiency comes in this system when the inter-disk spacing approximates the thickness of the boundary layer, and since boundary layer thickness is dependent on viscosity and pressure, the claim that a single design can be used efficiently for a variety of fuels and fluids is incorrect. A Tesla turbine differs from a conventional turbine only in the mechanism used for transferring energy to the shaft. Various analyses demonstrate the flow rate between the disks must be kept relatively low to maintain efficiency. Reportedly, the efficiency of the Tesla turbine drops with increased load. Under light load, the spiral taken by the fluid moving from the intake to the exhaust is a tight spiral, undergoing many rotations. Under load, the number of rotations drops and the spiral becomes progressively shorter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  This will increase the shear losses and also reduce the efficiency because the gas is in contact with the discs for less distance.\n\nEfficiency is a function of power output. A moderate load makes for high efficiency. Too heavy a load increases the slip in the turbine and lowers the efficiency; with too light a load, little power is delivered to the output, which also decreases efficiency (to zero at idle). This behavior is not exclusive to Tesla turbines.\n\n[[File:Tesla-Turbine-Small.png|left]]\nThe [[turbine efficiency]] of the gas Tesla turbine is estimated to be above 60, reaching a maximum of 95 percent {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Keep in mind that turbine efficiency is different from the cycle efficiency of the engine using the turbine. Axial turbines which operate today in steam plants or jet engines have efficiencies of about 60–70% (Siemens Turbines Data).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This is different from the cycle efficiencies of the plant or engine which are between approximately 25% and 42%, and are limited by any irreversibilities to be below the [[Carnot cycle]] efficiency.

In BST the blades must be carefully orientated, in the optimal regime of the regime's work, in such a way as to minimize the angle of the steam attack to their surface aria. Or in their words, they are trying to minimize the angle with which the steam is hitting their surface aria, as to create smooth seam flow, without any so called “eddies” or turbulence. Exactly these eddies are created according to the N3LM, or in reaction to the steam impacting the surface of the blades. One these eddies are loss to the useful energy that can be extracted from of the system and second, as they are in opposite direction, they decrease the energy of the incoming steam stream. \n\nIn TT, considering that there are no blades to be impacted what is the mechanism of  this energy of reaction to materialize. The recreational force to the steam head pressure actually builds, relatively quickly, as a steam pressure “belt” along the periphery of the turbine. That belt is most dense, pressurized, in the periphery as it pressure, when the rotor is not under load, will be a notch less, then the steam pressure. In a normal operational mode, that peripheral pressure, as Tesla noted, plays a role of BEMF (Back Electro Motive Force), limiting the flow of the incoming stream, and in this way the TT can be said to be self regulating. When the rotor is not under load the relative speeds between the \"steam compressed spirals\" (SCS, the steam spirally rotating between the disks) and the disks is minimal.\n\nWhen a load is applied on the TT shaft the slows down, i.e. the relative speed of the discs to the (movement) fluid increases as the fluid, at least initially, preserves its own momentum. For example, we can take a {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} radius where at 9000&nbsp;RPM the peripheral disk speeds are {{convert|90|m/s|abbr=on}}, when there is no load on the rotor, the disks move at approximately the same speed with the fluid, but when the rotor is loaded, the relative velocity differential (between the SCS and the metal disks) increases and {{convert|45|m/s|abbr=on}} rotor speed has a relative speed of 45&nbsp;m/s to the SCS. This is a dynamic environment and these speeds reach these values over time delta and not instantly. Here we have to note that fluids start to behave like solid bodies at high relative velocities, and in TT case, we also have to take in consideration the additional pressure. According to the old literature on steam boilers it is said, that steam at high speed, resulting from high pressure source, cuts steel as a \"knife cuts butter\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} According to the logic, this pressure and relative velocity towards the faces of the discs, the steam should start behaving like a solid body (SCS) dragging on disk metal surfaces. The created “friction” can only lead to the generation of an additional heat directly on the disk and in SCS, and will be most pronounced in the peripheral layer, where the relative velocity between the metal discs and SCS discs is the highest. This increase in the temperature, will be translated to increase in the SCS temperature, and that will lead to SCS steam expansion and pressure increase perpendicular to the metal discs as well as radially on the axis of rotation (SCS trying to expand, in order to absorb additional heat energy), and so this dynamics appears to be a positive feedback for transmitting a stronger “dragging” on the metal disks and consequently increasing the torque at the axis of rotation. \n\nThis dynamics appears to be a derivative of what Tesla commented, and although it is not mentioned by him, it is a logical next step to explain the thermodynamics in the system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Tesla patents]]\n* [[Radial turbine]]\n* [[Tesla coil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[File:TeslaTurbine-00.png|right|333px]]\n\n=== Books and publications ===\n* Tesla, Nikola, [http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1911-09-18.htm \"Dr. Tesla Talks Of Gas Turbines\"].

[[File:Mountain-Plain winds.gif|thumb|<div align=\"center\">Daytime mountain-plain wind system</div>]]During daytime, incoming solar radiation heats up the mountain top faster than the plain, creating a mean low pressure zone at the top. Winds then blow towards the mountain on all sides, flow up the slope and converge at the top. A return flow occurs aloft and comes back down into the plains.  The exact opposite happens during nighttime, when the top cools down faster than the plain, which creates a mean high pressure zone leading to winds coming from the mountain top down to the plain. This represents the idealized situation since many complications can arise from cross currents, forced or pressure driven channeling or even  [[cold front]]s approaching the mountain barrier.\n\n===Valley winds===\n[[File:Valley winds.gif|thumb|Up-valley winds during the day and down-valley winds at night.]]\nValley winds are best developed on clear summer days and are driven by horizontal pressure gradients. During the day, the valley is warmer than the flat terrain (because it contains a smaller volume of air receiving the same amount of radiation), which creates a lower pressure zone over the valley, entraining the air from the plains up to the valley. The opposite process occurs at nighttime, where the valley cools faster and the air flows back down to the plains .\n\n===Slope winds===\n[[File:Slope winds.gif|thumb|Up-slope winds during the day and down-slope winds at night.]]\nSlope-winds are produced by the temperature gradient between the valley and the air layer aloft. During daytime, the air above the valley on the slopes is warmer than at the bottom (due to a more direct exposure to incoming radiation), which leads to upslope flows converging at the ridge tops (and can lead to cloud formation depending on the humidity of the air parcel). At night, the air above the valley cools down faster than the surface leading to down-slope motion. This means that a temperature inversion occurs at night. The temperature increases from the bottom of the valley to the ridge top and the starts decreasing only when the air parcel is free from the influence of the topography. Again, this ideal circulation can often vary due to the complex topography. Insulation of the slopes is affected by [[Shade (shadow)|shade]], [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] and sky view factor, which is the portion of the visible sky not obscured by the relief. For instance, east facing slopes receive radiation earlier in the morning than west facing slopes, which affects how the PBL grows with time and space. A very good example of down-slope winds are the [[Santa Ana winds]], which are dry and warm winds coming from the Great Basin and Mojave desert down to coastal South California.\n\n==PBL growth due to wind systems==\n\n===Diurnal variation===\n[[File:Diurnal mountain winds variation.jpg|thumb|Diurnal wind system variation in the appalachian mountain range.]]\n[[File:Mountain CBL.jpg|thumb|Diurnal variation of the PBL over a mountainous terrain.]]\nOverall, plain to mountain, up-valley and up-slope winds occurring during the day  locally increase the height of the PBL.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ketterer|first=Christine |last2=Zieger |first2=Paul |last3= Bukowiecki |first3=Nicolas |last4=Collaud Coen |first4=Martine |last5=Maier |first5=Olaf |last6=Ruffieux |first6=Dominique |last7=Weingartner |first7=Ernest |year=2013 |title=Investigation of the Planetary Boundary Layer in the Swiss Alps Using Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurements|journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=317–334 |doi=10.1007/s10546-013-9897-8|bibcode = 2014BoLMe.151..317K }}</ref>\nThe PBL starts rising on the east facing slopes and near the ridges (warmed up by sun first and not hindered by pockets of cold air accumulated down the valley over night) and becomes more spatially homogeneous during the afternoon.\nTemporally speaking, the convection ends around the early evening.

This phenomenon can sometimes cause a vertical exchange of the PBL air into the free [[Earth's atmosphere|troposphere]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kossmann |first=M. |last2=Corsmeier |first2=U. |last3=de Wekker |first3=S. |last4=Fiedler |first4=F. |last5=Vögtlin |first5=R. |last6=Kalthoff |first6=N. |last7=Güsten |first7=H. |last8=Neininger |first8=B. |year=1999 |title= Observations of handover processes between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free troposphere over mountainous terrain |journal= Contrib Atmos Phys |volume=72 |pages=329–350}}</ref>\nSimilarly to the daytime situation, during summer the top of the mountain is warmer than its surroundings creating a low pressure zone. Winds then blow up from the plains to the mountain top, which is an efficient lifting mechanism to carry PBL pollutants into the free atmosphere.\n\n==Effect of landcover==\nBesides wind systems, the variation in land cover also plays a significant role in the PBL growth.\nBare or rocky soils are not the only land cover types found in high elevation, a more complex combination of snow and/or ice and/or vegetation is often observed. On such surfaces, the radiation energy budget is highly temporally and spatially variable and so is the growth of the PBL.\n\n===Snow===\n[[File:Down slope winds created by snowpack..jpg|thumb|Snow sublimates and creates a cold layer directly above the surface, which leads to winds blowing down-slope.]]\nDue to wind, fresh snow does not stay at the surface but is blown into the first few meters of the surface layer. This blowing snow usually sublimates due to the insulation and has a significant meteorological effect . The sublimation of blowing snow leads to a modification of the energy budget and an overall temperature decrease of 0.5&nbsp;°C combined to an increase of water vapor has been observed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Déry |first=Stephen J. |last2=Taylor |first2=Peter A. |last3=Jingbing |first3=Xiao |year=1998 |title=Thermodynamic effects of sublimating, blowing snow in the atmospheric boundary layer |journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=251–283|bibcode = 1998BoLMe..89..251T |doi = 10.1023/A:1001712111718 }}</ref> This forms a stable cold and moist layer of air above the snow surface, even if the surrounding air temperature is above freezing point.\nThis cold layer induces downslope winds, which  damper the growth of the PBL.\nThis surface winds are also drifting the snowpack, leading to an increase of surface roughness and therefore an increase of wind shear ([[Forced convection]]).\n\n===Vegetation===\n[[File:Up-slope winds created by vegetation.jpg|thumb|The canopy top reflects a significant part of the incoming solar radiation, which warms up the air layer above.]]\nLow vegetation cover such as grass or shrubs are usually covered by snow during winter time or at very high elevations and the modification in surface roughness is therefore of a limited magnitude. However, dense and high forests have a significant effect on surface roughness and also on the energy budget. The turbulence created by the vegetation canopy increases the forced convection in the surface layer. The top of the canopy has a tendency to warm up faster than the air at the bottom of the valley creating upslope wind conditions just from the presence of vegetation.\n\nTo summarize, the presence of snow creates down-slope winds hindering the growth of the PBL while the presence of forest creates up-slope winds facilitating the growth of the PBL.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Boundary layer meteorology]]"

Normally, the sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air just above it.  [[Thermal]]s form when this warm air rises into the cold air (warm air is less [[density|dense]] than cold air), a process described by [[convection]]. A convective layer such as this has the potential for cloud formation, since [[condensation]] occurs as the warm air rises and cools.\n\nAn inversion occurs when the normal temperature (warm air below, cold air above) profile is reversed, creating a stable configuration of dense, cold air sitting below lighter, warm air. An elevated inversion layer is thus a region of warm air above a region of cold air, but higher in the atmosphere (generally not touching the surface).\n\nA capping inversion occurs when there is a boundary layer with a normal temperature profile (warm air rising into cooler air) and the layer above that is an inversion layer (cooler air below warm air).  Cloud formation from the lower layer is \"capped\" by the inversion layer.  If the capping inversion layer or \"cap\" is too strong (too close to the surface), it will prevent thunderstorms from developing.  A strong cap can result in [[fog]]gy conditions.  \n\nHowever, if the air at the surface is [[convective instability|unstable]] enough, strong updrafts can be forced through the capping inversion.  This selective process of only allowing the strongest updrafts to form [[thunderstorm]]s often results in outbreaks of [[severe weather]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Convective available potential energy]]\n*[[Convective inhibition]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070817100924/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=capping-inversion1 Capping Inversion] - AMS Glossary of Meteorology\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070409061401/http://education.arm.gov/nsdl/Library/glossary.shtml#Capping_inversion#Capping_inversion Capping Inversion] - National Science Digital Library\n\n{{Meteorological variables}}\n\n[[Category:Boundary layer meteorology]]\n[[Category:Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n\n\n{{Climate-stub}}\n\n[[fr:Couche d'inversion#Inhibition de la convection]]"

The mixed layer, the major part of CBL, has a nearly constant distribution of quantities such as [[potential temperature]], [[wind]] speed, moisture and pollutant concentration because of strong [[buoyancy]] generated convective turbulent mixing. Parameterization of turbulent transport is used to simulate the vertical profiles and temporal variation of quantities of interest, because of the randomness and the unknown physics of turbulence.

Turbulences are generated by [[buoyancy]] and [[wind shear]]. If the buoyancy dominates over shear production, the boundary layer flow is in free convection. When shear generated turbulence is stronger than those generated by buoyancy, the flow is in forced convection.\n\n[[File:Buoyancy shear.pdf|thumb|Normalized turbulent kinetic energy generated by buoyancy and shear by surface buoyancy. Adapted from Stull 1988 \"An Introduction to Boundary layer meteorology\" page 155]]\n\nIn the surface layer, shear production always exceeds buoyancy production because of strong shear generated by surface drag. In the mixed layer, buoyancy generated by heating from the ground surface is the major driver of convective turbulence.<ref name=\"Stull12\">{{cite book|last=Stull|first=Rolald B.|title=An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology|date=1988|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=12}}</ref> Radiative cooling from the cloud tops is also an effective driver of convection. The buoyancy generated turbulence peaks in the afternoon, hence the boundary layer flow is in free convection during most of the afternoon.\n\nThe up and downdrafts of boundary layer convection is the primary way in which the atmosphere moves heat, momentum, moisture, and pollutants between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Thus, boundary layer [[convection]] is important in the global climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, air-quality modeling and the dynamics of numerous mesoscale phenomena.\n\n==Model Simulation==\n\n===Conservation equation===\n\nTo quantitatively describe the variation of quantities in the CBL, we need to solve the conservation equations. The simplified form of the conservation equation for a passive scalar in typical CBL is\n\n<math>\\frac {\\partial \\bar {c}}{\\partial t}=-\\frac {\\partial \\overline {w'c'}}{\\partial z}</math>\n \nwhere <math>\\bar {c} </math> is the mean of quantity <math>c</math>, which could be water vapor mixing ratio <math>q</math>, potential temperature <math>\\theta</math>, eastward-moving <math>u</math> and northward-moving <math>v</math> wind speed. <math>\\overline {w'c'}</math> is the vertical turbulent flux of <math>c</math>.\n\nWe made several approximations to get the above simplified equation: ignore the body source, Bousinesq approximation, horizontal homogeneity and no subsidence. Bousinesq approximation is to ignore the density change due to pressure perturbation and keep the density change due to temperature change. This is a fairly good approximation in the CBL. The latter two approximations are not always effective in the real CBL. But this is acceptable in theoretical research. Observations show that turbulent mixing accounts for 50% of the total variation of potential temperature in a typical CBL.\n\nHowever, due to the randomness of turbulences and our lack of knowledge about the exact physical behavior of it, parameterization of turbulent transport is needed in model simulation. Unlike shear dominated turbulence in the surface layer, large eddies associated with rise of warm air parcels that transport heat from hot to cold, regardless of the local gradient of the background environment exit in the mixed layer. Hence the non-local counter-gradient transport should be properly represented in the model simulation.\n\nSeveral approaches are generally followed in numerical models to obtain the vertical profiles and temporal variations of quantities in CBL. Full mixing scheme for the whole CBL, local scheme for the shear dominated regions, non-local scheme and top-down and bottom up diffusion scheme for the buoyancy dominated mixed layer. In the full mixing scheme, all quantities are assumed to be uniformly distributed and the turbulent fluxes are assumed to be linearly related to height, with a jump at the top. In the local scheme, the turbulent flux is scaled by the local gradient of the quantity. In non-local scheme, the turbulence fluxes are related to known quantities at any number of grid points elsewhere in the vertical.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stull|first=Rolald B.|title=An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology|date=1988|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=200}}</ref> In top-down and bottom-up diffusion, the vertical profile is determined by diffusion from the two directions and the turbulent fluxes in sub-grid scale are derived from known quantities or their vertical derivatives at the same grid point.\n\n===Full mixing scheme===\n\nFull mixing is the simplest representation of CBL in some global models. Fluxes within this layer are assumed to decrease linearly with height, and the mean variables keep their vertical profile at each simulation time step.<ref name=\"Lin10\">{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Jin-Tai|author2=Michael B.

The method analyzes high-frequency [[wind]] and [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] atmospheric data series, and yields values of [[flux]]es of these properties. It is a [[statistics|statistical]] method used in [[meteorology]] and other applications (micrometeorology, oceanography, hydrology, agricultural sciences, industrial and regulatory applications, etc.) to determine exchange rates of trace gases over natural ecosystems and agricultural fields, and to quantify gas emissions rates from other land and water areas. It is frequently used to estimate [[momentum]], [[heat flux|heat]], water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes.<ref>Baldocchi, D., B. Hicks, and T. Meyers. 1988.

The technique is mathematically complex, and requires significant care in setting up and processing data. To date, there is no uniform terminology or a single methodology for the Eddy Covariance technique, but much effort is being made by flux measurement networks (e.g., [[FluxNet]], [http://ameriflux.lbl.gov/ Ameriflux], [http://www.icos-infrastructure.eu/ ICOS], [http://www.carboeurope.org/ CarboEurope], [http://fluxnet.ccrp.ec.gc.ca/e_about.htm Fluxnet Canada], [http://www.ozflux.org.au/ OzFlux], [http://www.neoninc.org/ NEON], and [http://www.ileaps.org/ iLEAPS]) to unify the various approaches.\n\n[[File:Eddycorrelationsystem.jpg|thumb|200px|An eddy correlation instrument measuring oxygen fluxes in benthic environments.]]\nThe technique has additionally proven applicable under water to the [[benthic zone]] for measuring oxygen fluxes between seafloor and overlying water.<ref>Berg, P., H.

Oxygen fluxes are extracted from raw measurements largely following the same principles as used in the atmosphere, and they are typically used as a proxy for carbon exchange, which is important for local and global carbon budgets. For most benthic ecosystems, eddy correlation is the most accurate technique for measuring ''in-situ'' fluxes.

The situation looks chaotic, but vertical movement of the components can be measured from the tower.\n\n[[File:Pyörrekovarianssi-tekniikan kaaviokuva.jpg|center]]<center><sup>[4]</sup></center><center><sup>[4]</sup></center>\n\n'''Physical meaning of the eddy covariance method'''\n \nAt one physical point on the tower, at Time1, Eddy1 moves parcel of air c1 down at the speed w1. Then, at Time2, Eddy2 moves parcel c2 up at the speed w2. Each parcel has gas concentration, pressure, temperature, and humidity. If these factors, along with the speed are known, we can determine the flux. For example, if one knew how many molecules of water went down with eddies at Time 1, and how many molecules went up with eddies at Time2, at the same point, one could calculate the vertical flux of water at this point over this time. \nSo, vertical flux can be presented as a covariance of the vertical wind velocity and the concentration of the entity of interest.\n\n[[Image:EddyCovariance diagram 2.jpg|center]]<center><sup>[4]</sup></center><center><sup>[4]</sup></center>\n\n==Mathematical foundation==\nIn mathematical terms, \"eddy flux\" is computed as a [[covariance]] between instantaneous deviation in vertical wind speed (w') from the mean value (w-overbar) and instantaneous deviation in gas concentration, mixing ratio (s'), from its mean value (s-overbar), multiplied by mean air density (ρa). Several mathematical operations and assumptions, including Reynolds decomposition, are involved in getting from physically complete equations of the turbulent flow to practical equations for computing \"eddy flux\", as shown below.\n\n[[Image:EddyCovariance equations part 1.jpg|center]]\n[[Image:EddyCovariance equations part 2.jpg|center]]<center><sup>[4]</sup></center><center><sup>[4]</sup></center>\n\n==Major assumptions==\n*\tMeasurements at a point can represent an upwind area\n*\tMeasurements are done inside the boundary layer of interest\n*\tFetch/[[flux footprint]] is adequate – fluxes are measured only at area of interest\n*\tFlux is fully turbulent – most of the net vertical transfer is done by eddies\n*\tTerrain is horizontal and uniformed: average of fluctuations is zero; density fluctuations negligible; flow convergence & divergence negligible\n*\tInstruments can detect very small changes at high frequency, ranging from minimum of 5&nbsp;Hz and to 40&nbsp;Hz for tower-based measurements\n\n==Eddy covariance  processing software==\nCurrently (2011) there are many software programs <ref>M.

The programs range significantly in complexity, flexibility, number of allowed instruments and variables, help system and user support. Some programs are [[open-source software]], while others are [[closed-source]] or [[proprietary software|proprietary]].\n\nExamples include free fully supported and [https://www.licor.com/env/help/eddypro/topics_eddypro/EddyPro_Home.html documented] open-source software such as [http://www.licor.com/env/products/eddy_covariance/software.html EddyPro]; free unsupported open-source programs such as [http://gaia.agraria.unitus.it/eco2s ECO<sub>2</sub>S] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080821152535/http://www.met.wau.nl/ ECpack]; free closed-source packages such as [https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/jbm/micromet/EdiRe/ EdiRe], [https://epub.uni-bayreuth.de/342/ TK3], [http://www.climatexchange.nl/projects/alteddy/index.htm Alteddy], and [https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/www/uploads/Publications/TechnicalReports/tech_report10.pdf EddySoft]. Eddy covariance processing algorithms can also be implemented in commercial software such as [[Matlab]] or the free [[open-source software]] [[R (programming language)|R]].\n\n==Summary==\nIn summation, the 3D wind and another variable (usually gas concentration, temperature or momentum) are decomposed into [[average|mean]] and fluctuating components.  The covariance is calculated between the fluctuating component of the vertical wind and the fluctuating component of gas concentration. The measured flux is proportional to the covariance.\n\nThe area from which the detected eddies originate is described probabilistically and called a [[flux footprint]]. The flux footprint area is dynamic in size and shape, changing with wind direction, thermal stability and measurements height, and has a gradual border.\n\nThe effect of sensor separation, finite sampling length, sonic path averaging, as well as other instrumental limitations, affect frequency response of the measurement system and may need a co-spectral correction, especially noticeable with closed-path instruments and at low heights below 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;m.\n\n==Uses of eddy covariance method==\n\nCommon uses:\n*[[Greenhouse gas emissions]]\n*[[Carbon dioxide]] emission monitoring\n*[[Methane emissions]] monitoring\n*Water loss, [[evapotranspiration]]\n*Instantaneous water use efficiency\n*Instantaneous radiation use efficiency\n\nNovel uses:\n*Precision [[irrigation]], precision agriculture\n*[[Carbon Sequestration]] and Capture monitoring\n*[[Landfill]] gas emissions into the atmosphere\n*Emissions of gases displaced by [[hydraulic fracturing]] into the atmosphere\n*Gas leak detection and location\n*Methane emission from permafrost regions\n*Biogenic VOCs emission\n*[[Reactive trace gas]] exchange flux measurement\n\n== Related methods ==\n\n=== Eddy accumulation ===\n\n==== True eddy accumulation ====\nThe true eddy accumulation technique can be used to measure fluxes of trace gases for which there are no fast enough analysers available, thus where the eddy covariance technique is unsuitable. The basic idea is that upwards moving air parcels (updrafts) and downwards moving air parcels (downdrafts) are sampled proportionally to their velocity into separate reservoirs. A slow response gas analyser can then be used to quantify the average gas concentrations in both updraft and downdraft reservoirs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R. E. Speer, K. A. Peterson, T. G.

It was first described by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]]. Ekman layers occur both in the atmosphere and in the ocean.\n\nThere are two types of Ekman layers. The first type occurs at the surface of the ocean and is forced by surface winds, which act as a drag on the surface of the ocean. The second type occurs at the bottom of the atmosphere and ocean, where frictional forces are associated with flow over rough surfaces.\n\n==History==\nEkman developed the theory of the Ekman layer after [[Fridtjof Nansen]] observed that [[iceberg|ice]] drifts at an angle of 20°–40° to the right of the [[wind|prevailing wind]] direction while on an [[Arctic]] expedition aboard the [[Fram]].

      "title": "Flux footprint",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_footprint",
      "text": "'''Flux footprint''' (also known as '''atmospheric flux footprint''' or footprint) is an [[upwind]] area where the atmospheric [[flux]] measured by an instrument is generated. Specifically, the term flux footprint describes an upwind area \"seen\" by the instruments measuring vertical [[turbulence|turbulent]] fluxes, such that [[heat]], [[water]], [[gas]] and [[momentum]] transport generated in this area is registered by the instruments. Another frequently used term, fetch, usually refers to the distance from the tower when describing the footprint.\n\n==Visualization of the concept==\n[[Image:General Concept of Flux footprint.jpg|left|thumb|300px|General concept of the flux footprint.]]\n\nConsider an instrument measuring a flux of water ([[evapotranspiration]]) a few meters above the surface in a situation with no wind. In such a case, the instrument would measure evapotranspiration generated just underneath the instrument location and brought upwards by mostly non-turbulent exchange.\n\nIn a situation with a strong wind, the wind would blow air located under the instrument away. The wind would bring in air generated somewhere upwind and brought upwards to a large degree due to turbulent exchange. So, the water flux footprint was just under the instrument in the first case, and was somewhere upwind in the second case.\n\nIn the adjacent image, the darker the red color, the more contribution that is coming from the surface area a certain distance away for the instrument. Most of the contribution usually comes not from underneath the instrument or from kilometers away, but rather from somewhere in between. Size and shape of the footprint is also a dynamic area that changes with time.\n\n==Mathematical foundation==\n[[Image:Mathmatical representation of footprint.jpg|center|thumb|300px|Mathematical representation of footprint.]]\nAtmospheric transport can be looked at as a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian transport model]]. In such case, the footprint is the area of cumulative contribution to flux measurement computed from analytical solutions of the [[diffusion equation]]. For example, for near-neutral conditions, the mathematical representation of the flux footprint would be that seen in the image above.<ref>Schuepp et al. (1990)</ref><ref>Gash (1986)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Relative Contribution of land Surface area height.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Relative contribution of the land surface area to the flux for two different measurement heights at near-neutral stability.]] [[Image:Relative Contribution of land Surface area 2 roughness.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Relative contribution of the land surface area to the flux for two different surface roughnesses at near-neutral stability.]] [[Image:Relative Contribution of land Surface area 3 thermal.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Relative contribution of the land surface area to the flux for two different cases of thermal stability.]]\n\n==Main factors affecting flux footprint==\nThree main factors affecting the size and shape of flux footprint are: \n* measurement height\n* [[surface roughness]]\n* atmospheric thermal [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes|stability]]\nIncrease in measurement height, decrease in surface roughness, and change in atmospheric stability from unstable to stable would lead to an increase in size of the footprint and move peak contribution away from the instrument. The opposite is also true. Decrease in measurement height, increase in surface roughness, and change in atmospheric stability from stable to unstable would lead to a decrease in size of the footprint and move peak contribution closer to the instrument.\n\n===Examples===\n\nTo the right is an example of how the flux footprint is affected in all three cases, using the example of actual evapotranspiration flux (ET) measured over [[prairie]] in the summer season.\n\nThe '''top figure''' shows relative contribution of the land surface area to the flux for two different measurement heights at near-neutral stability. Please note that not only distance to the peak contributing was affected by a measurement height, but magnitude of the peak and overall distribution of the footprint was dramatically affected as well.\n\nThe '''middle figure''' shows relative contribution of the land surface area to the flux for two different surface roughnesses at near-neutral stability. Area under the curves on the plot above and on the two plots below sums up to nearly 100% of the flux contribution. The remaining few percent of flux are coming from an area beyond 500 m.\n\nThe '''bottom figure''' shows relative contribution of the land [[surface area]] to the flux for two different cases of [[thermal stability]].<ref>This example is adopted from Leclerc, M.Y., and G.W.

[[Surface tension]] stabilises the short wavelength instability however, and theory predicts stability until a velocity threshold is reached.

      "text": "The '''log wind profile''' is a semi-empirical relationship commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds within the lowest portion of the [[planetary boundary layer]].  The relationship is well described in the literature.<ref>{{cite book|author=Oke, T.R.|title=Boundary Layer Climates|edition=|publisher=Methuen|year=1987|id=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e., the [[surface layer]] of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]]). The rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the planetary boundary layer (up to around 1000 m) and the troposphere or free atmosphere.  In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used.\n\n==Definition==\nThe equation to estimate the mean wind speed (<math>u_z</math>) at height <math>z</math> (meters) above the ground is:\n<CENTER>\n<math>u_z = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_0} \\right) + \\psi(z,z_0,L)\\right]</math>\n</CENTER>\nwhere <math>u_*</math> is the [[friction velocity]] (m s<sup>−1</sup>), <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[Von Kármán constant]] (~0.41), <math>d</math> is the zero plane displacement (in metres), <math>z_0</math> is the [[Roughness Length|surface roughness]] (in meters), and <math>\\psi</math> is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability]] term where <math>L</math> is the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Obukhov length]] from [[Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]]. Under [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|neutral stability]] conditions, <math>z/L = 0</math> and <math>\\psi</math> drops out and the equation is simplified to,\n<CENTER>\n<math>u_z = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_0} \\right)\\right]</math>.\n</CENTER>\n\nZero-plane displacement (<math>d</math>) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  It can be approximated as <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the average height of the obstacles.<ref name=\"Holmes2015\">Holmes JD. Wind Loading of Structures. 3rd ed. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015.</ref>  For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.\n\nRoughness length (<math>z_0</math>) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow.  That is, the value of the roughness length depends on the terrain.  The exact value is subjective and references indicate a range of values, making it difficult to give definitive values. In most cases, references present a tabular format with the value of <math>z_0</math> given for certain terrain descriptions. For example, for very flat terrain (snow, desert) the roughness length may be in the range 0.001 to 0.005 m.<ref name=\"Holmes2015\"/>  Similarly, for open terrain (grassland) the typical range is 0.01-0.05 m.<ref name=\"Holmes2015\"/>  For cropland, and brush/forest the ranges are 0.1-0.25 m and 0.5-1.0 m respectively.

      "text": "{{short description|A layer in which active turbulence has homogenized some range of depths.}}\n[[File:MixedLayerTempDepthMonth.png|thumb|200px|Depth of Mixed Layer versus temperature, along with relationship to different months of the year]]\n[[File:MixedLayerMonth.png|thumb|200px|Depth of Mixed Layer versus the month of the year, along with relationship to temperature]]\nThe oceanic or [[limnological]] '''mixed layer''' is a layer in which active turbulence has homogenized some range of depths. The surface mixed layer is a layer where this turbulence is generated by winds, surface heat fluxes, or processes such as evaporation or sea ice formation which result in an increase in salinity.   The atmospheric '''mixed layer''' is a zone having nearly constant [[potential temperature]] and [[specific humidity]] with height. The depth of the atmospheric mixed layer is known as the '''mixing height'''.  [[Turbulence]] typically plays a role in the formation of [[fluid]] mixed layers.\n\n== Oceanic mixed layer ==\n\n=== Importance of the mixed layer ===\nThe mixed layer plays an important role in the physical climate. Because the [[specific heat]] of ocean water is much larger than that of air, the top 2.5 m of the ocean holds as much heat as the entire atmosphere above it. Thus the heat required to change a mixed layer of 2.5 m by 1&nbsp;°C would be sufficient to raise the temperature of the atmosphere by 10&nbsp;°C. The depth of the mixed layer is thus very important for determining the temperature range in oceanic and coastal regions.   In addition, the heat stored within the oceanic mixed layer provides a source for heat that drives global variability such as [[El nino|El Niño]].\n\nThe mixed layer is also important as its depth determines the average level of light seen by marine organisms. In very deep mixed layers, the tiny marine plants known as [[phytoplankton]] are unable to get enough light to maintain their metabolism. The deepening of the mixed layer in the wintertime in the North Atlantic is therefore associated with a strong decrease in surface chlorophyll a. However, this deep mixing also replenishes near-surface nutrient stocks. Thus when the mixed layer becomes shallow in the spring, and light levels increase,  there is often a concomitant increase of phytoplankton biomass, known as the \"spring bloom\".\n\n=== Oceanic mixed layer formation ===\n\nThere are three primary sources of energy for driving turbulent mixing within the open-ocean mixed layer.  The first is the ocean waves, which act in two ways. The first is the generation of turbulence near the ocean surface, which acts to stir light water downwards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kato | first1 = H. | last2 = Phillips | first2 = O.M. | year = 1969 | title = On the penetration of a turbulent layer into a stratified fluid | url = | journal = J.

When these shears reach sufficient magnitude, they can eat into stratified fluid. This process is often described and modelled as an example of [[Kelvin-Helmholtz instability]], though other processes may play a role as well. Finally, if cooling, addition of brine from freezing sea ice, or evaporation at the surface causes the surface density to increase, [[convection]] will occur. The deepest mixed layers (exceeding 2000 m in regions such as the [[Labrador Sea]]) are formed through this final process, which is a form of [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]. Early models of the mixed layer such as those of Mellor and Durbin included the final two processes. In coastal zones, large velocities due to tides may also play an important role in establishing the mixed layer.\n\nThe mixed layer is characterized by being nearly uniform in properties such as temperature and salinity throughout the layer. Velocities, however, may exhibit significant shears within the mixed layer. The bottom of the mixed layer is characterized by a [[gradient]], where the water properties change.   [[Oceanography|Oceanographers]] use various definitions of the number to use as the mixed layer depth at any given time, based on making measurements of physical properties of the water.  Often, an abrupt temperature change called a [[thermocline]] occurs to mark the bottom of the mixed layer; sometimes there may be an abrupt salinity change called a [[halocline]] that occurs as well.  The combined influence of temperature and salinity changes results in an abrupt density change, or [[pycnocline]]. Additionally, sharp gradients in nutrients (nutricline) and oxygen (oxycline) and a maximum in [[chlorophyll]] concentration are often co-located with the base of the seasonal mixed layer.\n\n=== Oceanic mixed layer depth determination ===\n[[Image:Mixed layer depth.png|thumb|Mixed layer depth climatology for boreal winter(upper image) and boreal summer(lower image).]]\nThe depth of the mixed layer is often determined by [[hydrography]]—making measurements of water properties. Two criteria often used to determine the '''mixed layer depth''' are temperature and sigma-''t'' (density) change from a reference value (usually the surface measurement).  The temperature criterion used in Levitus (1982) defines the mixed layer as the depth at which the temperature change from the surface temperature is 0.5&nbsp;°C.  The [[sigma-t|sigma-''t'']] (density) criterion used in Levitus (1982) uses the depth at which a change from the surface sigma-''t'' of 0.125 has occurred. Neither criterion implies that active mixing is occurring to the mixed layer depth at all times. Rather, the mixed layer depth estimated from hydrography is a measure of the depth to which mixing occurs over the course of a few weeks.\n\nThe mixed layer depth is in fact greater in winter than summer in each hemisphere. During the summer increased solar heating of the surface water leads to more stable density stratification, reducing the penetration of wind-driven mixing. Because seawater is most dense just before it freezes, wintertime cooling over the ocean always reduces stable stratification, allowing a deeper penetration of wind-driven turbulence but also generating turbulence that can penetrate to great depths.\n\n <!--- Important, do not remove this line before article has been created. --->\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = \n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background = \n | footer    = \n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width     = \n | image1    = example_blt_31Jan2002_Argo2.png\n | width1    = 350\n | caption1  = <center>An example of barrier layer thickness for an Argo profile taken January 31, 2002 in the tropical Indian Ocean.

The difference between D<sub>T-02</sub> minus D<sub>sigma</sub> is the barrier layer thickness (blue arrows on the figure) [http://www.lodyc.jussieu.fr/~cdblod/blt.html].  </center>}}\n\n=== Barrier layer thickness ===\nThe barrier layer thickness (BLT) is a layer of water separating the well-mixed surface layer from the [[Thermocline#oceanography|thermocline]].<ref>Sprintall, J., and M. Tomczak, Evidence of the barrier layer in the surface-layer of the tropics, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 97 (C5), 7305-7316, 1992.</ref>   A more precise definition would be the difference between [[Mixed layer#Oceanic mixed layer formation|mixed layer depth]] (MLD) calculated from temperature minus the mixed layer depth calculated using density.   The first reference to this difference as the barrier layer was in a paper describing observations in the western Pacific as part of the Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Study.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lukas | first1 = R. | last2 = Lindstrom | first2 = E. | year = 1991 | title = The Mixed Layer of the Western Equatorial Pacific-Ocean | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 3343–3357 | doi=10.1029/90jc01951 | bibcode=1991JGR....96.3343L}}</ref>  In regions where the barrier layer is present, [[stratification (water)|stratification]] is stable because of strong [[buoyancy]] forcing associated with a fresh (i.e. more buoyant) water mass sitting on top of the water column. \n \nIn the past, a typical criterion for MLD was the depth at which the surface temperature cools by some change in temperature from surface values.  For example, Levitus (1982) used 0.5<sup>o</sup>C.  In the example to the right,  0.2<sup>o</sup>C is used to define the MLD (i.e. D<sub>T-02</sub> in the Figure).  Prior to the abundant subsurface salinity available from [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo]], this was the main methodology for calculating the oceanic MLD.  More recently, a density criterion has been used to define the MLD.     The density-derived MLD is defined as the depth where the density increases from the surface value due to a prescribed temperature decrease of some value (e.g. 0.2<sup>o</sup>C) from the surface value while maintaining constant surface salinity value.   In the Figure, this is defined by D<sub>sigma</sub> and corresponds to a layer that is both isothermal and isohaline.   The BLT is the difference of the temperature-defined MLD minus the density-defined value (i.e. D<sub>T-02</sub> - D<sub>sigma</sub>).\n\n==== BLT regimes ====\nLarge values of the BLT are typically found in the equatorial regions and can be as high as 50 m.  Above the barrier layer, the well mixed layer may be due to local precipitation exceeding evaporation (e.g. in the western Pacific), monsoon related river runoff (e.g. in the northern Indian Ocean), or [[Advection#Meteorology|advection]] of salty water subducted in the subtropics (found in all subtropical [[ocean gyre]]s).  Barrier layer formation in the subtropics is associated with seasonal change in the mixed layer depth, a sharper gradient in sea surface salinity (SSS) than normal, and subduction across this SSS front.<ref>Sato, K., T. Suga, and K. Hanawa, Barrier layers in the subtropical gyres of the world's oceans, Geophysical Research Letters, 33 (8), 2006.</ref>    In particular, the barrier layer is formed in winter season in the equatorward flank of subtropical salinity maxima.  During early winter, the atmosphere cools the surface and strong wind and negative buoyancy forcing mixes temperature to a deep layer.  At this same time, fresh surface salinity is advected from the rainy regions in the tropics.  The deep temperature layer along with strong stratification in the salinity gives the conditions for barrier layer formation.<ref>Mignot, J., C.d.B. Montegut, A. Lazar, and S. Cravatte, Control of salinity on the mixed layer depth in the world ocean: 2. Tropical areas, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 112 (C10), 2007.</ref>\n  \nFor the western Pacific, the mechanism for barrier layer formation is different.  Along the equator, the eastern edge of the warm pool (typically 28<sup>o</sup>C isotherm - see [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Weeklysst.gif SST plot] in the western Pacific) is a demarcation region between warm fresh water to the west and cold, salty, [[Upwelling#Equatorial|upwelled]] water in the central Pacific.  A barrier layer is formed in the isothermal layer when salty water is subducted (i.e. a denser water mass moves below another) from the east into the warm pool due to local convergence or warm fresh water overrides denser water to the east.  Here, weak winds, heavy precipitation, eastward advection of low salinity water, westward subduction of salty water and downwelling [[Kelvin waves#Equatorial Kelvin wave|equatorial Kelvin]] or [[Rossby wave#Oceanic waves|Rossby waves]] are factors that contribute to deep BLT formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bosc | first1 = C. | last2 = Delcroix | first2 = T. | last3 = Maes | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Barrier layer variability in the western Pacific warm pool from 2000 to 2007 | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans | volume = 114 | issue = | page = | doi=10.1029/2008jc005187 | bibcode=2009JGRC..114.6023B}}</ref>\n\n==== Importance of BLT ====\nPrior to [[El Nino]], the warm pool stores heat and is confined to the far western Pacific.  During the El Nino, the warm pool migrates eastward along with the concomitant precipitation and current anomalies.  The [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] of the westerlies is increased during this time, reinforcing the event.  Using data from the ship of opportunity and Tropical Atmosphere – Ocean (TAO) moorings in the western Pacific, the east and west migration of the warm pool was tracked over 1992-2000 using sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), currents, and subsurface data from [[Conductivity, temperature, depth]] taken on various research cruises.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Delcroix | first1 = T. | last2 = McPhaden | first2 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Interannual sea surface salinity and temperature changes in the western Pacific warm pool during 1992-2000 | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans | volume = 107 | issue = C12| page = | doi=10.1029/2001jc000862| bibcode = 2002JGRC..107.8002D}}</ref>  This work showed that during westward flow, the BLT in the western Pacific along the equator (138<sup>o</sup>E-145<sup>o</sup>E, 2<sup>o</sup>N-2<sup>o</sup>S) was between 18 m – 35 m corresponding with warm SST and serving as an efficient storage mechanism for heat.   Barrier layer formation is driven by westward (i.e. converging and subducting) [[ocean currents|currents]] along the equator near the eastern edge of the salinity front that defines the warm pool.  These westward currents are driven by downwelling Rossby waves and represent either a westward advection of BLT or a preferential deepening of the deeper thermocline versus the shallower halocline due to Rossby wave dynamics (i.e. these waves favor vertical stretching of the upper water column).  During El Nino, westerly winds drive the warm pool eastward allowing fresh water to ride on top of the local colder/saltier/denser water to the east.   \nUsing coupled, atmospheric/ocean models and tuning the mixing to eliminate BLT for one year prior to El Nino, it was shown that the heat buildup associated with barrier layer is a requirement for big El Nino.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maes | first1 = C. | last2 = Picaut | first2 = J. | last3 = Belamari | first3 = S. | year = 2005 | title = Importance of the salinity barrier layer for the buildup of El Niño | url = | journal = Journal of Climate | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 104–118 | doi=10.1175/jcli-3214.1| bibcode = 2005JCli...18..104M }}</ref>  It has been shown that there is a tight relationship between SSS and SST in the western Pacific and the barrier layer is instrumental in maintaining heat and momentum in the warm pool within the salinity stratified layer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maes | first1 = C. | last2 = Ando | first2 = K. | last3 = Delcroix | first3 = T. | last4 = Kessler | first4 = W.S. | last5 = McPhaden | first5 = M.J. | last6 = Roemmich | first6 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Observed correlation of surface salinity, temperature and barrier layer at the eastern edge of the western Pacific warm pool | url = | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = | doi=10.1029/2005gl024772 | bibcode=2006GeoRL..33.6601M}}</ref> Later work, including Argo drifters, confirm the relationship between eastward migration of the warm pool during El Nino and barrier layer heat storage in the western Pacific.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mignot | first1 = J. | last2 = Montegut | first2 = C.d.B. | last3 = Lazar | first3 = A. | last4 = Cravatte | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Control of salinity on the mixed layer depth in the world ocean: 2.

Water changes density as it changes temperature.  In lakes, temperature structure is complicated by the fact that fresh water is heaviest at 3.98&nbsp;°C (degrees Celsius).  Thus in lakes where the surface gets very cold, the mixed layer briefly extends all the way to the bottom in the spring, as surface warms as well as in the fall, as the surface cools. This overturning is often important for maintaining the oxygenation of very deep lakes.\n\nThe study of [[limnology]] encompasses all inland water bodies, including bodies of water with salt in them.  In saline lakes and seas (such as the Caspian Sea),  mixed layer formation generally behaves similarly to the ocean.\n\n== Atmospheric mixed layer formation ==\n{{Main|Planetary boundary layer}}\nThe atmospheric mixed layer results from [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] air motions, typically seen towards the middle of the day when air at the surface is warmed and rises. It is thus mixed by [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]. The standard procedure for determining the mixed layer depth is to examine the profile of [[potential temperature]], the temperature which the air would have if it were brought to the pressure found at the surface without gaining or losing heat. As such an increase of pressure involves compressing the air, the potential temperature is higher than the in-situ temperature, with the difference increasing as one goes higher in the atmosphere. The atmospheric mixed layer is defined as a layer of (approximately) constant potential temperature, or a layer in which the temperature falls at a rate of approximately 10&nbsp;°C/km, provided it is free of clouds. Such a layer may have gradients in the humidity, though. As is the case with the ocean mixed layer, velocities will not be constant throughout the atmospheric mixed layer.\n\n== External links ==\n* [[Lake effect snow]] for a link to a NASA image from the SeaWiFS satellite showing clouds in the atmospheric mixed layer.\n* See the Ifremer/Los Mixed Layer Depth Climatology website at http://www.ifremer.fr/cerweb/deboyer/mld for having access to up to date ocean Mixed Layer Depth Climatology, data, maps and links.\n\n== References ==\n* Levitus, Sydney (1982), Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean, NOAA Professional Paper 13, U.S. Department of Commerce.\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Mellor | first1 = G.
