This is the [[normal subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] given by the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the [[determinant]]\n\n:<math>\\det\\colon \\operatorname{GL}(n, F) \\to F^\\times.</math>\n\nwhere we write ''F''<sup>×</sup> for the [[multiplicative group]] of ''F'' (that is, ''F'' excluding 0).\n\nThese elements are \"special\" in that they form a [[Algebraic variety|subvariety]] of the general linear group – they satisfy a polynomial equation (since the determinant is polynomial in the entries).\n\n==Geometric interpretation==\nThe special linear group {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} can be characterized as the group of ''[[volume]] and [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] preserving'' linear transformations of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>; this corresponds to the interpretation of the determinant as measuring change in volume and orientation.\n\n==Lie subgroup==\nWhen ''F'' is '''R''' or '''C''', {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} is a [[Lie subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} of dimension {{nowrap|''n''<sup>2</sup> − 1}}. The [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{sl}(n, F)</math> of SL(''n'', ''F'') consists of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices over ''F'' with vanishing [[trace (matrix)|trace]]. The [[Lie bracket]] is given by the [[commutator]].\n\n==Topology==\nAny invertible matrix can be uniquely represented according to the [[polar decomposition]] as the product of a [[unitary matrix]] and a [[hermitian matrix]] with positive [[eigenvalue]]s. The [[determinant]] of the unitary matrix is on the [[unit circle]] while that of the hermitian matrix is real and positive and since in the case of a matrix from the special linear group the product of these two determinants must be 1, then each of them must be 1. Therefore, a special linear matrix can be written as the product of a [[special unitary matrix]] (or [[special orthogonal matrix]] in the real case) and a [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] hermitian matrix (or [[symmetric matrix]] in the real case) having determinant 1.\n\nThus the topology of the group {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''C''')}} is the [[product topology|product]] of the topology of SU(''n'') and the topology of the group of hermitian matrices of unit determinant with positive eigenvalues. A hermitian matrix of unit determinant and having positive eigenvalues can be uniquely expressed as the [[matrix exponential|exponential]] of a [[traceless]] hermitian matrix, and therefore the topology of this is that of {{nowrap|(''n''<sup>2</sup> − 1)}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 2.5</ref> Since SU(''n'') is [[simply connected]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.11</ref> we conclude that {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''C''')}} is also simply connected, for all ''n''.\n\nThe topology of {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} is the product of the topology of [[special orthogonal matrix|SO]](''n'') and the topology of the group of symmetric matrices with positive eigenvalues and unit determinant. Since the latter matrices can be uniquely expressed as the exponential of symmetric traceless matrices, then this latter topology is that of {{nowrap|(''n'' + 2)(''n'' − 1)/2}}-dimensional Euclidean space. Thus, the group {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} has the same [[fundamental group]] as SO(''n''), that is, '''Z''' for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} and '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Sections 13.2 and 13.3</ref> In particular this means that {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}}, unlike {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''C''')}}, is not simply connected, for ''n'' greater than 1.\n\n==Relations to other subgroups of GL(''n'',''A'')==\n{{see also|Whitehead's lemma}}\n\nTwo related subgroups, which in some cases coincide with SL, and in other cases are accidentally conflated with SL, are the [[commutator subgroup]] of GL, and the group generated by [[Shear mapping|transvections]]. These are both subgroups of SL (transvections have determinant 1, and det is a map to an abelian group, so [GL, GL] ≤ SL), but in general do not coincide with it.\n\nThe group generated by transvections is denoted {{nowrap|E(''n'', ''A'')}} (for [[elementary matrices]]) or {{nowrap|TV(''n'', ''A'')}}. By the second [[Steinberg relations|Steinberg relation]], for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}, transvections are commutators, so for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}, {{nowrap|E(''n'', ''A'') ≤ [GL(''n'', ''A''), GL(''n'', ''A'')]}}.\n\n<!-- Does equality hold? Dunno. -->\nFor {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, transvections need not be commutators (of {{nowrap|2 × 2}} matrices), as seen for example when ''A'' is '''F'''<sub>2</sub>, the field of two elements, then \n:<math>\\operatorname{Alt}(3) \\cong [\\operatorname{GL}(2, \\mathbf{F}_2),\\operatorname{GL}(2, \\mathbf{F}_2)] < \\operatorname{E}(2, \\mathbf{F}_2) = \\operatorname{SL}(2, \\mathbf{F}_2) = \\operatorname{GL}(2, \\mathbf{F}_2) \\cong \\operatorname{Sym}(3),</math>\nwhere Alt(3) and Sym(3) denote the [[alternating group|alternating]] resp. [[symmetric group]]<!--- I suppose this is meant; that article does not mention \"Sym(n)\" notation---> on 3 letters.\n\nHowever, if ''A'' is a field with more than 2 elements, then {{nowrap|1=E(2, ''A'') = [GL(2, ''A''), GL(2, ''A'')]}}, and if ''A'' is a field with more than 3 elements, {{nowrap|1=E(2, ''A'') = [SL(2, ''A''), SL(2, ''A'')]}}. {{Dubious - discuss|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn some circumstances these coincide: the special linear group over a field or a [[Euclidean domain]] is generated by transvections, and the ''stable'' special linear group over a [[Dedekind domain]] is generated by transvections. For more general rings the stable difference is measured by the [[special Whitehead group]] {{nowrap|1=SK<sub>1</sub>(''A'') := SL(''A'')/E(''A'')}}, where SL(''A'') and E(''A'') are the [[direct limit of groups|stable group]]s of the special linear group and elementary matrices.\n\n==Generators and relations==\nIf working over a ring where SL is generated by [[Shear mapping|transvections]] (such as a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] or [[Euclidean domain]]), one can give a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of SL using transvections with some relations. Transvections satisfy the [[Steinberg relations]], but these are not sufficient: the resulting group is the [[Steinberg group (K-theory)|Steinberg group]], which is not the special linear group, but rather the [[universal central extension]] of the commutator subgroup of GL.\n\nA sufficient set of relations for {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''Z''')}} for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}} is given by two of the Steinberg relations, plus a third relation {{harv|Conder|Robertson|Williams|1992|p=19}}.\nLet {{nowrap|1=''T<sub>ij</sub>'' := ''e<sub>ij</sub>''}}(1) be the elementary matrix with 1's on the diagonal and in the ''ij'' position, and 0's elsewhere (and ''i'' ≠ ''j''). Then\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\left[ T_{ij},T_{jk} \\right] &= T_{ik} && \\text{for } i \\neq k\\\\[4pt]\n\\left[ T_{ij},T_{k\\ell} \\right] &= \\mathbf{1}          && \\text{for } i \\neq \\ell, j \\neq k\\\\[4pt]\n(T_{12}T_{21}^{-1}T_{12})^4 &= \\mathbf{1}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nare a complete set of relations for SL(''n'', '''Z'''), ''n'' ≥ 3.\n\n==SL<sup>±</sup>(''n'',''F'')==\nIn [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2, the set of matrices with determinant {{math|±1}} form another subgroup of GL, with SL as an index 2 subgroup (necessarily normal); in characteristic 2 this is the same as SL. This forms a [[short exact sequence]] of groups:\n:<math>\\mathrm{SL}(n, F) \\to \\mathrm{SL}^{\\pm}(n, F) \\to \\pm 1.</math>\n\nThis sequence splits by taking any matrix with determinant {{math|−1}}, for example the diagonal matrix <math>(-1, 1, \\dots, 1).</math> If <math>n = 2k + 1</math> is odd, the negative identity matrix <math>-I</math> is in {{math|SL<sup>±</sup>(''n'',''F'')}} but not in {{math|SL(''n'',''F'')}} and thus the group splits as an [[internal direct product]] <math>SL^\\pm(2k + 1, F) \\cong SL(2k + 1, F) \\times \\{\\pm I\\}</math>. However, if <math>n = 2k</math> is even, <math>-I</math> is already in {{math|SL(''n'',''F'')}} , {{math|SL<sup>±</sup>}} does not split, and in general is a non-trivial [[group extension]].\n\nOver the real numbers, {{math|SL<sup>±</sup>(''n'', ''R'')}} has two [[connected component (topology)|connected components]], corresponding to {{math|SL(''n'', ''R'')}} and another component, which are isomorphic with identification depending on a choice of point (matrix with determinant {{math|−1}}). In odd dimension these are naturally identified by <math>-I</math>, but in even dimension there is no natural identification.\n\n==Structure of GL(''n'',''F'')==\nThe group {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} splits over its determinant (we use {{nowrap|''F''<sup>×</sup> ≅ GL(1, ''F'') → GL(''n'', ''F'')}} as the [[monomorphism]] from ''F''<sup>×</sup> to {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}}, see [[semidirect product]]), and therefore {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} can be written as a [[semidirect product]] of {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} by ''F''<sup>×</sup>:\n\n:GL(''n'', ''F'') = SL(''n'', ''F'') ⋊ ''F''<sup>×</sup>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]]\n* [[SL2(C)|SL(2, '''C''')]]\n* [[Modular group]]\n* [[Projective linear group]]\n* [[Conformal map]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Conder | first1=Marston|author1-link=Marston Conder | last2=Robertson | first2=Edmund | last3=Williams | first3=Peter | title=Presentations for 3-dimensional special linear groups over integer rings | mr=1079696  | year=1992 | journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society | volume=115 | issue=1 | pages=19–26 |doi=10.2307/2159559 | publisher=American Mathematical Society | jstor=2159559 }}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie groups, Lie algebras, and representations: An elementary introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015}}\n\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Linear algebraic groups]]"

The group {{math|SU(2)}} is [[isomorphic]] to the group of [[quaternion]]s of [[Quaternion#Conjugation,_the_norm,_and_reciprocal|norm]] 1, and is thus [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]]. Since [[unit quaternion]]s can be used to represent rotations in 3-dimensional space (up to sign), there is a [[surjective]] [[homomorphism]] from {{math|SU(2)}} to the [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation group {{math|SO(3)}}]] whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is {{math|{+''I'', −''I''}}}.<ref group=nb>For an explicit description of the homomorphism {{math|SU(2) → SO(3)}}, see [[rotation group SO(3)#Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)|Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)]].</ref> {{math|SU(2)}} is also identical to one of the symmetry groups of [[spinor]]s, [[spin group|Spin]](3), that enables a spinor presentation of rotations.\n\n==Properties==\nThe special unitary group {{math|SU(''n'')}} is a real [[Lie group]] (though not a [[complex Lie group]]).

The [[Weyl group]] is the [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S<sub>n</sub>''}}, which is represented by [[generalized permutation matrix#Signed permutation group|signed permutation matrices]] (the signs being necessary to ensure the determinant is 1).\n\nThe [[Lie algebra]] of {{math|SU(''n'')}}, denoted by <math>\\mathfrak{su}(n)</math>, can be identified with the set of [[traceless]] [[antiHermitian]] {{math|''n''×''n''}} complex matrices, with the regular [[commutator]] as Lie bracket. [[Particle physics|Particle physicists]] often use a different, equivalent representation: the set of traceless [[Hermitian]] {{math|''n''×''n''}} complex matrices with Lie bracket given by {{math|−''i''}} times the commutator.\n\n==Lie algebra==\n{{main article|Classical group#U(p, q) and U(n) – the unitary groups}}\n\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\operatorname{su}(n)</math> of <math>\\operatorname{SU}(n)</math> consists of <math>n \\times n</math> [[skew Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian]] matrices with trace zero.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.24</ref> This (real) Lie algebra has dimension <math>n^2 - 1</math>. More information about the structure of this Lie algebra can be found below in the section \"Lie algebra structure.\"\n\n===Fundamental representation===\nIn the physics literature, it is common to identify the Lie algebra with the space of trace-zero ''Hermitian'' (rather than the skew-Hermitian) matrices. That is to say, the physicists' Lie algebra differs by a factor of <math>i</math> from the mathematicians'. With this convention, one can then choose generators {{math|''T''<sub>''a''</sub>}} that are [[trace (linear algebra)|traceless]] [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] complex {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrices, where:\n\n:<math>T_a T_b = \\frac{1}{2n}\\delta_{ab}I_n + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{c=1}^{n^2 -1}\\left(if_{abc} + d_{abc}\\right) T_c</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''f''}} are the [[structure constants]] and are antisymmetric in all indices, while the {{math|''d''}}-coefficients are symmetric in all indices.\n\nAs a consequence, the anticommutator and commutator are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\left\\{T_a, T_b\\right\\} &= \\frac{1}{n}\\delta_{ab} I_n + \\sum_{c=1}^{n^2 -1}{d_{abc} T_c} \\\\\n    \\left[T_a, T_b\\right] &= i \\sum_{c=1}^{n^2 -1} f_{abc} T_c\\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe factor of <math>i</math> in the commutation relations arises from the physics convention and is not present when using the mathematicians' convention.\n\nWe may also take\n\n:<math>\\sum_{c,e=1}^{n^2 - 1} d_{ace}d_{bce} = \\frac{n^2 - 4}{n} \\delta_{ab}</math>\n\nas a normalization convention.\n\n===Adjoint representation===\nIn the {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''<sup>2</sup> − 1)}} }}-dimensional [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]], the generators are represented by {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''<sup>2</sup> − 1)}} }}× {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''<sup>2</sup> − 1)}} }} matrices, whose elements are defined by the structure constants themselves:\n\n:<math>\\left(T_a\\right)_{jk} = -if_{ajk}.</math>\n\n==The group SU(2)==\n{{see also|Versor|Pauli matrices|Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra|Representation theory of SU(2)}}\n{{math|SU(2)}} is the following group,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Exercise 1.5</ref>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{SU}(2) = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & -\\overline{\\beta} \\\\ \\beta & \\overline{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}: \\ \\ \\alpha,\\beta \\in \\mathbf{C}, |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1 \\right\\}~,</math>\n\nwhere the overline denotes [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]].\n\nThere is a 2:1 homomorphism from [[Rotation_group_SO(3)#Using_quaternions_of_unit_norm|SU(2) to SO(3)]].\n\n===[[Diffeomorphism]] with [[3-sphere|S<sup>3</sup>]]===\nIf we consider <math>\\alpha,\\beta</math> as a pair in <math>\\mathbb{C}^2</math> where <math>\\alpha=a+bi</math> and <math>\\beta=c+di</math>, then the equation <math>|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1</math> becomes\n:<math>a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1</math>\n\nThis is the equation of the [[3-sphere|3-sphere S<sup>3</sup>]]. This can also be seen using an embedding: the map\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\varphi \\colon \\mathbf{C}^2 &\\to \\operatorname{M}(2, \\mathbf{C}) \\\\[5pt]\n       \\varphi(\\alpha, \\beta) &= \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & -\\overline{\\beta}\\\\ \\beta & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|M(2, '''C''')}} denotes the set of 2 by 2 complex matrices, is an injective real linear map (by considering {{math|'''C'''<sup>2</sup>}} [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}} and {{math|M(2, '''C''')}} diffeomorphic to {{math|'''R'''<sup>8</sup>}}). Hence, the [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of {{math|''φ''}} to the [[3-sphere]] (since modulus is 1), denoted {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}, is an embedding of the 3-sphere onto a compact submanifold of {{math|M(2, '''C''')}}, namely {{math|1=''φ''(''S''<sup>3</sup>) = SU(2)}}.\n\nTherefore, as a manifold, {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} is diffeomorphic to {{math|SU(2)}}, which shows that {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} can be endowed with the structure of a compact, connected [[Lie group]].\n\n===[[Isomorphism]] with [[Rotation group SO(3)#Using quaternions of unit norm|unit quaternions]]===\nThe complex matrix:\n:<math> \\begin{pmatrix} \n    a + bi & c + di \\\\ \n    -c + di &  a - bi\n  \\end{pmatrix} \\quad\n  (a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R})\n</math>\n\ncan be mapped to the [[quaternion]]:\n:<math>a\\,\\hat{1} + b\\,\\hat{i} + c\\,\\hat{j} + d\\,\\hat{k}</math>\n\nThis map is in fact an isomorphism. Additionally, the determinant of the matrix is the norm of the corresponding quaternion. Clearly any matrix in {{math|SU(2)}} is of this form and, since it has determinant&nbsp;1, the corresponding quaternion has norm 1. Thus {{math|SU(2)}} is isomorphic to the [[versor|unit quaternions]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alistairsavage.ca/mat4144/notes/MAT4144-5158-LieGroups.pdf |series=MATH 4144 notes |title=LieGroups |author=Savage, Alistair}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Lie algebra basis}}Lie algebra===\nThe [[Lie algebra]] of {{math|SU(2)}} consists of <math>2\\times 2</math> [[skew Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian]] matrices with trace zero.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.24</ref> Explicitly, this means\n:<math>\\mathfrak{su}(2) = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} i\\ a & -\\overline{z} \\\\ z & -i\\ a \\end{pmatrix}:\\ a \\in \\mathbf{R}, z \\in \\mathbf{C} \\right\\}~.</math>\n\nThe Lie algebra is then generated by the following matrices,\n:<math>u_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & i \\\\\n    i & 0\n  \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n  u_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -1 \\\\\n    1 &  0\n  \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n  u_3 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    i &  0 \\\\\n    0 & -i\n  \\end{pmatrix}~,\n</math>\nwhich have the form of the general element specified above.\n\nThese satisfy the [[quaternion]] relationships  <math>u_2\\ u_3 = -u_3\\ u_2 = u_1~,</math>  <math>u_3\\ u_1 = -u_1\\ u_3 = u_2~,</math>  and  <math>u_1 u_2 = -u_2\\ u_1 = u_3~.</math> The [[commutator bracket]] is therefore specified by\n:<math>\\left[u_3, u_1\\right] = 2\\ u_2, \\quad \\left[u_1, u_2\\right] = 2\\ u_3, \\quad \\left[u_2, u_3\\right] = 2\\ u_1~.</math>\n\nThe above generators are related to the [[Pauli matrices]] by <math>u_1 = i\\ \\sigma_1~, \\, u_2 = -i\\ \\sigma_2</math>  and  <math>u_3 = +i\\ \\sigma_3~.</math> This representation is routinely used in [[quantum mechanics]] to represent the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of [[fundamental particle]]s such as [[electron]]s.

This group is often referred to as the '''special unitary group of signature {{math|''p q''}} over {{math|''F''}}'''. The field {{math|''F''}} can be replaced by a [[commutative ring]], in which case the vector space is replaced by a [[free module]].\n\nSpecifically, fix a [[Hermitian matrix]] {{math|''A''}} of signature {{math|''p q''}} in {{math|GL(''n'', '''R''')}}, then all\n:<math>M \\in \\operatorname{SU}(p, q, R)</math>\n\nsatisfy\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  M^{*} A M &= A \\\\\n     \\det M &= 1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOften one will see the notation {{math|SU(''p'', ''q'')}} without reference to a ring or field; in this case, the ring or field being referred to is {{math|'''C'''}} and this gives one of the classical [[Lie groups]]. The standard choice for {{math|''A''}} when {{nowrap|{{math|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}}} is\n: <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 0       & i \\\\\n     0 & I_{n-2} & 0 \\\\\n    -i & 0       & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nHowever, there may be better choices for {{math|''A''}} for certain dimensions which exhibit more behaviour under restriction to subrings of {{math|'''C'''}}.\n\n===Example===\nAn important example of this type of group is the [[Picard modular group]] {{math|SU(2, 1; '''Z'''[''i''])}} which acts (projectively) on complex hyperbolic space of degree two, in the same way that {{math|SL(2,9;'''Z''')}} acts (projectively) on real [[hyperbolic space]] of dimension two. In 2005 Gábor Francsics and [[Peter Lax]] computed an explicit fundamental domain for the action of this group on {{math|HC<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>{{cite arXiv |arxiv=math/0509708 |date=September 2005 |title=An Explicit Fundamental Domain For The Picard Modular Group In Two Complex Dimensions |last1=Francsics |first1=Gabor |last2=Lax |first2=Peter D. }}</ref>\n\nA further example is {{math|SU(1, 1; '''C''')}}, which is isomorphic to {{math|SL(2,'''R''')}}.\n\n==Important subgroups==\nIn physics the special unitary group is used to represent [[bosonic]] symmetries. In theories of [[symmetry breaking]] it is important to be able to find the subgroups of the special unitary group. Subgroups of {{math|SU(''n'')}} that are important in [[Grand unification theory|GUT physics]] are, for {{nowrap|{{math|''p'' > 1, ''n'' − ''p'' > 1}} }},\n:<math>\\operatorname{SU}(n) \\supset \\operatorname{SU}(p) \\times \\operatorname{SU}(n - p) \\times \\operatorname{U}(1),</math>\n\nwhere × denotes the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] and {{math|U(1)}}, known as the [[circle group]], is the multiplicative group of all [[complex number]]s with [[absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]]&nbsp;1.\n\nFor completeness, there are also the [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] and [[compact symplectic group|symplectic]] subgroups,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\operatorname{SU}(n) &\\supset \\operatorname{SO}(n), \\\\\n  \\operatorname{SU}(2n) &\\supset \\operatorname{Sp}(n).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince the [[rank of a Lie group|rank]] of {{math|SU(n)}} is {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' − 1}} }} and of {{math|U(1)}} is 1, a useful check is that the sum of the ranks of the subgroups is less than or equal to the rank of the original group. {{math|SU(''n'')}} is a subgroup of various other Lie groups,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\operatorname{SO}(2n) &\\supset \\operatorname{SU}(n) \\\\\n    \\operatorname{Sp}(n) &\\supset \\operatorname{SU}(n) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Spin}(4) &= \\operatorname{SU}(2) \\times \\operatorname{SU}(2) \\\\\n      \\operatorname{E}_6 &\\supset \\operatorname{SU}(6) \\\\\n      \\operatorname{E}_7 &\\supset \\operatorname{SU}(8) \\\\\n      \\operatorname{G}_2 &\\supset \\operatorname{SU}(3)\n\\end{align}</math>\nSee [[spin group]], and [[simple Lie groups]] for E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, and G<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThere are also the [[Spin group#Accidental isomorphisms|accidental isomorphisms]]:   {{nowrap|{{math|1 = SU(4) = Spin(6)}} }}, {{nowrap|{{math|1 = SU(2) = Spin(3) = Sp(1)}} }},<ref group=nb>{{math|Sp(''n'')}} is the [[compact real form]] of {{math|Sp(2''n'', '''C''')}}.

The dimension of the {{math|Sp(''n'')}}-matrices is {{math|2''n'' × 2''n''}}.</ref> and {{nowrap|{{math|1 = U(1) = Spin(2) = SO(2)}} }}.\n\nOne may finally mention that {{math|SU(2)}} is the [[double covering group]] of {{math|SO(3)}}, a relation that plays an important role in the theory of rotations of 2-[[spinor]]s in non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n==The group SU(1,1)==\nSU(1,1) = <math>\\{ \\begin{pmatrix}u & v \\\\ v^* & u^* \\end{pmatrix} \\in M(2,C) : \\ u u^* - v v^* \\ = \\ 1 \\},</math> where <math>u^*</math> denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of the complex number ''u''.\n\nThis group is isomorphic to SO(2,1) and SL(2,ℝ)<ref>Robert Gilmore (1974) ''Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and some of their Applications'', pages 52, 201−5, [[John Wiley & Sons]] {{mr|1275599}}</ref> where the numbers separated by a comma refer to the [[signature (quadratic form)|signature]] of the [[quadratic form]] preserved by the group. The expression <math>u u^* - v v^* </math> in the definition of SU(1,1) is an [[Hermitian form]] which becomes an [[isotropic quadratic form]] when ''u'' and ''v'' are expanded with their real components. An early appearance of this group was as the \"unit sphere\" of [[coquaternion]]s, introduced by [[James Cockle]] in 1852. Let\n:<math>j = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} , \\quad k = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} , \\quad i = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} .</math>\nThen <math>j k = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -i .</math> Also i is a square root of −1 (negative of the identity matrix), while j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> = identity matrix. Similar to Hamilton's quaternions, here ''q'' = ''w'' + ''x'' i + ''y'' j + ''z'' k is a coquaternion with conjugate ''q'' * = ''w'' – ''x'' i – ''y'' j – ''z'' k. The elements i, j, and k have the [[anticommutativity]] property so that the quadratic form is <math> q q^* \\ = \\ w^2 + x^2 - y^2 - z^2. </math>\n\nNote that the 2-sheet [[hyperboloid]] <math>\\{x i + y j + z k : x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 1 \\} </math> corresponds to the [[imaginary unit]]s in the algebra so that any point on this hyperbola can be used as a '''pole''' of a sinusoidal wave according to [[Euler's formula]].\n\nThe hyperboloid is stable under SU(1,1), illustrating the isomorphism with SO(2,1). The variability of the pole of a wave, as noted in studies of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], might view [[elliptical polarization]] as an exhibit of the elliptical shape of a wave with pole ''p'' ≠ ± i. The [[Poincaré sphere (optics)|Poincaré sphere]] model used since 1892 has been compared to a 2-sheet hyperboloid model.<ref>R. D. Mota, D. Ojeda-Guillén, M. Salazar-Ramírez, and V. D.

      "text": ":''Not to be confused with [[tensor product]]s of [[spin representation]]s.''\n\nIn [[mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[theoretical physics]], the '''spin tensor''' is a quantity used to describe the rotational motion of particles in [[spacetime]]. The tensor has application in \n[[general relativity]] and [[special relativity]], as well as [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], and [[quantum field theory]].\n\nThe [[Euclidean group]] SE(d) of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]] is generated by [[translation]]s and [[rotation]]s. Its [[Lie algebra]] is written <math>\\mathfrak{se}(d)</math>.\n\nThis article uses [[Cartesian coordinates]] and [[tensor index notation]].\n\n==Background on Noether currents==\n\nThe [[Noether current]] for translations in space is momentum, while the current for increments in time is energy. These two statements combine into one in spacetime: translations in spacetime, i.e. a displacement between two events, is generated by the four-momentum ''P''. Conservation of four-momentum is given by the [[continuity equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\nu T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu\\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress–energy tensor]], and ∂ are [[partial derivative]]s that make up the [[four gradient]] (in non-Cartesian coordinates this must be replaced by the [[covariant derivative]]). Integrating over spacetime:\n\n:<math>\\int d^3 x T^{\\mu 0}(\\vec{x},t) = P^\\mu</math>\n\ngives the [[four-momentum]] vector at time ''t''.\n\nThe Noether current for a rotation about the point ''y'' is given by a tensor of 3rd order, denoted <math>M^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}_y</math>. Because of the [[Lie algebra]] relations\n\n:<math>M^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}_y(x)=M^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}_0(x)+y^\\alpha T^{\\beta\\mu}(x)-y^\\beta T^{\\alpha\\mu}(x)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere the 0 subscript indicates the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] (unlike momentum, angular momentum depends on the origin), the integral:\n\n:<math>\\int d^4 x M^{\\mu\\nu}_0(\\vec{x},t)</math>\n\ngives the angular momentum tensor <math>M^{\\mu\\nu} \\,</math> at time ''t''.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe '''spin tensor''' is defined at a point '''x''' to be the value of the Noether current at '''x''' of a rotation about ''x'',\n\n:<math>S^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}(\\mathbf{x})\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   M^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}_x(\\mathbf{x})=M^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}_0(\\mathbf{x})+x^\\alpha T^{\\beta\\mu}(\\mathbf{x})-x^\\beta T^{\\alpha\\mu}(\\mathbf{x})</math>\n\nThe continuity equation\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu M^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}_0=0\\,,</math>\n\nimplies:\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu S^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}=T^{\\beta\\alpha}-T^{\\alpha\\beta} \\neq 0</math>\n\nand therefore, the [[stress–energy tensor]] is not a [[symmetric tensor]].\n\nThe quantity ''S'' is the density of [[spin (physics)|spin]] angular momentum (spin in this case is not only for a point-like particle, but also for an extended body), and ''M'' is the density of orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum is always the sum of spin and orbital contributions.\n\nThe relation:\n\n:<math> T_{ij} - T_{ji} </math>\n\ngives the [[torque]] density showing the rate of conversion between the orbital angular momentum and spin.\n\n==Examples==\n\nExamples of materials with a nonzero spin density are [[molecular fluid]]s, the [[electromagnetic field]] and [[turbulent fluid]]s. For molecular fluids, the individual molecules may be spinning. The electromagnetic field can have [[circularly polarized light]]. For turbulent fluids, we may arbitrarily make a distinction between long wavelength phenomena and short wavelength phenomena. A long wavelength [[vorticity]] may be converted via turbulence into tinier and tinier vortices transporting the angular momentum into smaller and smaller wavelengths while simultaneously reducing the [[vorticity]]. This can be approximated by the [[eddy viscosity]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Poincaré group]]\n* [[Lorentz group]]\n* [[Relativistic angular momentum]]\n* [[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n* [[Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations]]\n* [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite book|title=General Relativity, Astrophysics, and Cosmology|author1=A.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Type of pseudo-Riemannian manifold}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}\nIn [[differential geometry]], [[representation theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]], a '''symmetric space''' is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] whose group of symmetries contains an [[inversion symmetry]] about every point. This can be made more precise, in either the language of [[Riemannian geometry]] or of [[Lie theory]]. The Riemannian definition is more geometric, and plays a deep role in the theory of [[holonomy]]. The Lie-theoretic definition is more algebraic.\n\nIn [[Riemannian geometry]], a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold is a symmetric space if and only if its curvature tensor is invariant under parallel transport. More generally, a Riemannian manifold (''M'', ''g'') is said to be symmetric if and only if, for each point ''p'' of ''M'', there exists an isometry of ''M'' fixing ''p'' and acting on the tangent space <math>T_pM</math> of ''M'' at ''p'' by minus the identity.  Every symmetric space is complete, and has a finite cover which is a simply connected symmetric space; thus these two characterizations in fact coincide up to finite covers. Both descriptions can also naturally be extended to the setting of [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.\n\nFrom the point of view of [[Lie theory]], a symmetric space is the quotient ''G''/''H'' of Lie group ''G'' by a Lie subgroup ''H'', where the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak h</math> of ''H'' is also required to be the +1-eigenspace of an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of ''G''. \nAs stated, this characterization includes pseudo-Riemannian spaces as well as a Riemannian ones; extra algebraic conditions are needed to restrict to the Riemannian case.\n\nRiemannian symmetric spaces arise in a wide variety of situations in both mathematics and physics. They were first classified by [[Élie Cartan]]. Their central role in the theory of [[holonomy]] was discovered by [[Marcel Berger]]. They are important objects of study in representation theory and harmonic analysis as well as in differential geometry.\n\n==Definition using geodesic symmetries==\nLet ''M'' be a connected Riemannian manifold and ''p'' a point of ''M''. An automorphism ''f'' of a neighborhood of ''p'' is said to be a '''geodesic symmetry''' if it fixes the point ''p'' and reverses geodesics through that point, i.e. if ''γ'' is a geodesic and <math> \\gamma(0)=p</math> then <math>f(\\gamma(t))=\\gamma(-t).</math> It follows that the derivative of the map at ''p'' is minus the identity map on the  [[tangent space]] of ''p''. On a general Riemannian manifold, ''f'' need not be isometric, nor can it be extended, in general, from a neighbourhood of ''p'' to all of ''M''.\n\n''M'' is said to be '''locally Riemannian symmetric''' if its geodesic symmetries are in fact isometric. This is equivalent to the vanishing of the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor. \nA locally symmetric space is said to be a '''(globally)  symmetric space''' if, in addition, its geodesic symmetries are defined on all of ''M''.\n\n===Basic properties===\nThe [[Cartan&ndash;Ambrose&ndash;Hicks theorem]] implies that ''M'' is locally Riemannian symmetric [[if and only if]] its curvature tensor is [[covariant derivative|covariantly constant]], and furthermore that every [[simply connected]], [[complete space|complete]] locally Riemannian symmetric space is actually Riemannian symmetric.\n\nEvery Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' is complete and Riemannian [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] (meaning that the isometry group of ''M'' acts transitively on ''M''). In fact, already the identity component of the isometry group acts transitively on ''M'' (because ''M'' is connected).\n \nLocally Riemannian symmetric spaces that are not Riemannian symmetric may be constructed as quotients of Riemannian symmetric spaces by discrete groups of isometries with no fixed points, and as open subsets of (locally) Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\n===Examples===\nBasic examples of Riemannian symmetric spaces are [[Euclidean space]], [[sphere]]s, [[projective space]]s, and [[hyperbolic space]]s, each with their standard Riemannian metrics. More examples are provided by compact, semi-simple [[Lie groups]] equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. An example of a non-Riemannian symmetric space is [[anti-de Sitter space]].\n\nEvery compact Riemann surface of genus greater than 1 (with its usual metric of constant curvature &minus;1) is a locally symmetric space but not a symmetric space.\n\n==General definition==\nLet ''G'' be a connected [[Lie group]]. Then a '''symmetric space''' for ''G'' is a homogeneous space ''G''/''H'' where the stabilizer ''H'' of a typical point is an open subgroup of the fixed point set of an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''σ'' in Aut(''G''). Thus ''σ'' is an automorphism of ''G'' with ''σ''<sup>2</sup> = id<sub>''G''</sub> and ''H'' is an open subgroup of the set\n: <math> G^\\sigma=\\{ g\\in G: \\sigma(g) = g\\}.</math>\nBecause ''H'' is open, it is a union of components of ''G''<sup>''σ''</sup> (including, of course, the identity component).\n\nAs an automorphism of ''G'', ''σ'' fixes the identity element, and hence, by differentiating at the identity, it induces an automorphism of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of ''G'', also denoted by ''σ'', whose square is the identity. It follows that the eigenvalues of ''σ'' are ±1. The +1 eigenspace is the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak h</math> of ''H'' (since this is the Lie algebra of ''G''<sup>''σ''</sup>), and the −1 eigenspace will be denoted <math>\\mathfrak m</math>. Since ''σ'' is an automorphism of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, this gives a [[direct sum of Lie algebras|direct sum]] decomposition\n:<math> \\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak h\\oplus\\mathfrak m</math>\nwith\n:<math> [\\mathfrak h,\\mathfrak h]\\subset \\mathfrak h,\\; [\\mathfrak h,\\mathfrak m]\\subset \\mathfrak m,\\; [\\mathfrak m,\\mathfrak m]\\subset \\mathfrak h.</math>\nThe first condition is automatic for any homogeneous space: it just says the infinitesimal stabilizer <math>\\mathfrak h</math> is a Lie subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. The second condition means that <math>\\mathfrak m</math> is an <math>\\mathfrak h</math>-invariant complement to <math>\\mathfrak h</math> in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. Thus any symmetric space is a [[reductive homogeneous space]], but there are many reductive homogeneous spaces which are not symmetric spaces. The key feature of symmetric spaces is the third condition that <math>\\mathfrak m</math> brackets into <math>\\mathfrak h</math>.\n\nConversely, given any Lie algebra <math> \\mathfrak g</math> with a direct sum decomposition satisfying these three conditions, the linear map ''σ'', equal to the identity on <math>\\mathfrak h</math> and minus the identity on <math>\\mathfrak m</math>, is an involutive automorphism.\n\n==Riemannian symmetric spaces satisfy  the Lie-theoretic characterization==\nIf ''M'' is a Riemannian symmetric space, the identity component ''G'' of the isometry group of ''M'' is a [[Lie group]] acting transitively on ''M'' (''M'' is Riemannian homogeneous). Therefore, if we fix some point ''p'' of ''M'', ''M'' is diffeomorphic to the quotient ''G/K'', where ''K'' denotes the [[isotropy group]] of the action of ''G'' on ''M'' at ''p''. By differentiating the action at ''p'' we obtain an isometric action of ''K'' on T<sub>''p''</sub>''M''. This action is faithful (e.g., by a theorem of Kostant, any isometry in the identity component is determined by its [[jet bundle|1-jet]] at any point) and so ''K'' is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of T<sub>''p''</sub>''M'', hence compact. Moreover, if we denote by ''s''<sub>''p''</sub>: M → M the geodesic symmetry of ''M'' at ''p'', the map\n:<math>\\sigma: G \\to G, h \\mapsto s_p \\circ h \\circ s_p</math>\nis an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] Lie group [[automorphism]] such that the isotropy group ''K'' is contained between the fixed point group of ''σ'' and its identity component (hence an open subgroup).\n\nTo summarize, ''M'' is a symmetric space ''G''/''K'' with a compact isotropy group ''K''. Conversely, symmetric spaces with compact isotropy group are Riemannian symmetric spaces, although not necessarily in a unique way. To obtain a Riemannian symmetric space structure we need to fix a ''K''-invariant inner product on the tangent space to ''G''/''K'' at the identity coset ''eK'': such an inner product always exists by averaging, since ''K'' is compact, and by acting with ''G'', we obtain a ''G''-invariant Riemannian metric ''g'' on ''G''/''K''.\n\nTo show that ''G''/''K'' is Riemannian symmetric, consider any point ''p'' = ''hK'' (a coset of ''K'', where ''h'' ∈ ''G'') and define\n:<math>s_p: M \\to M, h'K \\mapsto h \\sigma(h^{-1}h')K</math>\nwhere ''σ'' is the involution of ''G'' fixing ''K''. Then one can check that ''s''<sub>''p''</sub> is an isometry with (clearly) ''s''<sub>''p''</sub>(''p'') = ''p'' and (by differentiating) d''s''<sub>''p''</sub>  equal to minus the identity on T<sub>''p''</sub>''M''. Thus ''s''<sub>''p''</sub> is a geodesic symmetry and, since ''p'' was arbitrary, ''M'' is a Riemannian symmetric space.\n\nIf one starts with a Riemannian symmetric space ''M'', and then performs these two constructions in sequence, then the Riemannian symmetric space yielded is isometric to the original one. This shows that the \"algebraic data\" (''G'',''K'',''σ'',''g'') completely describe the structure of ''M''.\n\n==Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces==\n{{main|List of simple Lie groups}}\n\nThe algebraic description of Riemannian symmetric spaces enabled [[Élie Cartan]] to obtain a complete classification of them in 1926.\n\nFor a given Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' let (''G'',''K'',''σ'',''g'') be the algebraic data associated to it. To classify the possible isometry classes of ''M'', first note that the [[universal cover]] of a Riemannian symmetric space is again Riemannian symmetric, and the covering map is described by dividing the connected isometry group ''G'' of the covering by a subgroup of its center. Therefore, we may suppose without loss of generality that ''M'' is simply connected. (This implies ''K'' is connected by the [[long exact sequence of a fibration]], because ''G'' is connected by assumption.)\n\n===Classification scheme===\nA simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is said to be '''irreducible''' if it is not the product of two or more Riemannian symmetric spaces. It can then be shown that any simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is a Riemannian product of irreducible ones. Therefore, we may further restrict ourselves to classifying the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nThe next step is to show that any irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' is of one of the following three types:\n\n1. '''Euclidean type''': ''M'' has vanishing curvature, and is therefore isometric to a [[Euclidean space]].\n\n2. '''Compact type''': ''M'' has nonnegative (but not identically zero) [[sectional curvature]].\n\n3. '''Non-compact type''': ''M'' has nonpositive (but not identically zero) sectional curvature.\n\nA more refined invariant is the '''rank''', which is the maximum dimension of a subspace of the tangent space (to any point) on which the curvature is identically zero. The rank is always at least one, with equality if the sectional curvature is positive or negative.  If the curvature is positive, the space is of compact type, and if negative, it is of  noncompact type.  The spaces of Euclidean type have rank equal to their dimension and are isometric to a Euclidean space of that dimension. Therefore, it remains to classify the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact and non-compact type. In both cases there are two classes.\n\nA. ''G'' is a (real) simple Lie group;\n\nB. ''G'' is either the product of a compact simple Lie group with itself (compact type), or a complexification of such a Lie group (non-compact type).\n\nThe examples in class B are completely described by the classification of [[simple Lie group]]s. For compact type, ''M'' is a compact simply connected simple Lie group, ''G'' is ''M''&times;''M'' and ''K'' is the diagonal subgroup. For non-compact type, ''G'' is a simply connected complex simple Lie group and ''K'' is its maximal compact subgroup. In both cases, the rank is the [[rank of a Lie group|rank of ''G'']].\n\nThe compact simply connected Lie groups are the universal covers of the classical Lie groups <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n)</math>, <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math>, <math>\\mathrm{Sp}(n)</math> and the five [[Exceptional Lie group#Exceptional algebras|exceptional Lie groups]] ''E''<sub>6</sub>, ''E''<sub>7</sub>, ''E''<sub>8</sub>, ''F''<sub>4</sub>, ''G''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe examples of class A are completely described by the classification of noncompact simply connected real simple Lie groups. For non-compact type, ''G'' is such a group and ''K'' is its maximal compact subgroup. Each such example has a corresponding example of compact type, by considering a maximal compact subgroup of the complexification of ''G'' which contains ''K''. More directly, the examples of compact type are classified by involutive automorphisms of compact simply connected simple Lie groups ''G'' (up to conjugation). Such involutions extend to involutions of the complexification of ''G'', and these in turn classify non-compact real forms of ''G''.\n\nIn both class A and class B there is thus a correspondence between symmetric spaces of compact type and non-compact type. This is known as duality for Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\n===Classification result===\nSpecializing to the Riemannian symmetric spaces of class A and compact type, Cartan found that there are the following seven infinite series and twelve exceptional Riemannian symmetric spaces ''G''/''K''. They are here given in terms of ''G'' and ''K'', together with a geometric interpretation, if readily available. The labelling of these spaces is the one given by Cartan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Label\n! ''G''\n! ''K''\n! Dimension\n! Rank\n!

The irreducible compact Riemannian symmetric spaces are, up to finite covers, either a compact simple Lie group, a Grassmannian, a [[Lagrangian Grassmannian]], or a [[double Lagrangian Grassmannian]] of subspaces of <math>(\\mathbf A \\otimes \\mathbf B)^n,</math> for normed division algebras '''A''' and '''B'''. A similar construction produces the irreducible non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\n==Symmetric spaces in general==\n\nAn important class of symmetric spaces generalizing the Riemannian symmetric spaces are '''pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces''', in which the Riemannian metric is replaced by a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] (nondegenerate instead of positive definite on each tangent space). In particular, '''Lorentzian symmetric spaces''', i.e., ''n'' dimensional pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces of signature (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,1), are important in [[general relativity]], the most notable examples being [[Minkowski space]], [[De Sitter space]] and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (with zero, positive and negative curvature respectively). De Sitter space of dimension ''n'' may be identified with the 1-sheeted hyperboloid in a Minkowski space of dimension ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nSymmetric and locally symmetric spaces in general can be regarded as affine symmetric spaces. If ''M'' = ''G''/''H'' is a symmetric space, then Nomizu showed that there is a ''G''-invariant torsion-free [[affine connection]] (i.e. an affine connection whose [[torsion tensor]] vanishes) on ''M'' whose [[curvature of a connection|curvature]] is [[parallel transport|parallel]]. Conversely a manifold with such a connection is locally symmetric (i.e., its [[universal cover]] is a symmetric space). Such manifolds can also be described as those affine manifolds whose geodesic symmetries are all globally defined affine diffeomorphisms, generalizing the Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian case.\n\n===Classification results===\nThe classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces does not extend readily to the general case for the simple reason that there is no general splitting of a symmetric space into a product of irreducibles. Here a symmetric space ''G''/''H'' with Lie algebra\n:<math>\\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak h\\oplus \\mathfrak m</math>\nis said to be irreducible if <math>\\mathfrak m</math> is an [[irreducible representation]] of <math>\\mathfrak h</math>. Since  <math>\\mathfrak h</math> is not semisimple (or even reductive) in general, it can have [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] representations which are not irreducible.\n\nHowever, the irreducible symmetric spaces can be classified. As shown by [[Katsumi Nomizu]], there is a dichotomy: an irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''H'' is either flat (i.e., an affine space) or <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is semisimple. This is the analogue of the Riemannian dichotomy between Euclidean spaces and those of compact or noncompact type, and it motivated M. Berger to classify semisimple symmetric spaces (i.e., those with  <math>\\mathfrak g</math>  semisimple) and determine which of these are irreducible. The latter question is more subtle than in the Riemannian case: even if <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is simple, ''G''/''H'' might not be irreducible.\n\nAs in the Riemannian case there are semisimple symmetric spaces with ''G'' = ''H'' &times; ''H''. Any semisimple symmetric space is a product of symmetric spaces of this form with symmetric spaces such that <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is simple. It remains to describe the latter case. For this, one needs to classify involutions ''σ'' of a (real) simple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. If <math>\\mathfrak g^c</math> is not simple, then <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is a complex simple Lie algebra, and the corresponding symmetric spaces have the form ''G''/''H'', where ''H'' is a real form of ''G'': these are the analogues of the Riemannian symmetric spaces ''G''/''K'' with ''G'' a complex simple Lie group, and ''K'' a maximal compact subgroup.\n\nThus we may assume <math>\\mathfrak g^c</math> is simple. The real subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> may be viewed as the fixed point set of a complex [[antilinear]] involution ''τ'' of <math>\\mathfrak g^c</math>, while ''σ'' extends to a complex antilinear involution of <math>\\mathfrak g^c</math> commuting with ''τ'' and hence also a complex linear involution ''σ''∘''τ''.\n\nThe classification therefore reduces to the classification of commuting pairs of antilinear involutions of a complex Lie algebra. The composite ''σ''∘''τ'' determines a complex symmetric space, while ''τ'' determines a real form. From this it is easy to construct tables of symmetric spaces for any given <math>\\mathfrak g^c</math>, and furthermore, there is an obvious duality given by exchanging ''σ'' and ''τ''. This extends the compact/non-compact duality from the Riemannian case, where either ''σ'' or ''τ'' is a [[Cartan involution]], i.e., its fixed point set is a maximal compact subalgebra.\n\n===Tables===\nThe following table indexes the real symmetric spaces by complex symmetric spaces and real forms, for each classical and exceptional complex simple Lie group.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left\" | ''G''<sup>c</sup> = SL(''n'','''C''')\n!

These are defined as Riemannian manifolds ''M''  with a transitive connected Lie group of isometries ''G'' and an isometry σ normalising ''G'' such that given ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' there is an isometry ''s'' in ''G'' such that ''sx'' =   σ''y'' and ''sy'' = σ''x''. (Selberg's assumption that σ<sup>2</sup> should be an element of ''G'' was later shown to be unnecessary by [[Ernest Vinberg]].) Selberg proved that weakly symmetric spaces give rise to [[Gelfand pair]]s, so that in particular the [[unitary representation]] of ''G'' on ''L''<sup>2</sup>(''M'') is multiplicity free.\n\nSelberg's definition can also be phrased equivalently in terms of a generalization of geodesic symmetry. It is required that for every point ''x'' in ''M'' and tangent vector ''X'' at ''x'', there is an isometry ''s'' of ''M'', depending on ''x'' and ''X'', such that\n\n*''s'' fixes ''x'';\n*the derivative of ''s'' at ''x'' sends ''X'' to –''X''.\n\nWhen ''s'' is independent of ''X'', ''M'' is a symmetric space. \n \nAn account of weakly symmetric spaces and their classification by Akhiezer and Vinberg, based on the classification of periodic automorphisms of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, is given in {{harvtxt|Wolf|2007}}.\n\n==Applications and special cases==\n\n===Symmetric spaces and holonomy===\n{{main|Holonomy group}}\n\nIf the identity component of the [[holonomy group#Riemannian holonomy|holonomy group]] of a Riemannian manifold at a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space, then either the manifold is a locally Riemannian symmetric space, or it is in one of [[holonomy group#The Berger classification|7 families]].\n\n===Hermitian symmetric spaces===\n{{main|Hermitian symmetric space}}\n\nA Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel complex structure compatible with the Riemannian metric is called a [[Hermitian symmetric space]]. Some examples are complex vector spaces and complex projective spaces, both with their usual Riemannian metric, and the complex unit balls with suitable metrics so that they become complete and Riemannian symmetric.\n\nAn irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''K'' is Hermitian if and only if ''K'' contains a central circle. A quarter turn by this circle acts as multiplication by ''i'' on the tangent space at the identity coset. Thus the Hermitian symmetric spaces are easily read off of the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there are four infinite series, namely AIII, BDI with ''p=2'', DIII and CI, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded symmetric domains in complex vector spaces.\n\n===Quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces===\n{{main|Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space}}\n\nA Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel subbundle of End(T''M'') isomorphic to the imaginary quaternions at each point, and compatible with the Riemannian metric, is called [[quaternion-Kähler symmetric space]].\n\nAn irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''K'' is quaternion-Kähler if and only if isotropy representation of ''K'' contains an Sp(1) summand acting like the [[unit quaternion]]s on a [[quaternionic vector space]]. Thus the quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are easily read off from the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there is exactly one for each complex simple Lie group, namely AI with ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 or ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 (these are isomorphic),  BDI with ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 or ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, CII with ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 or ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, EII, EVI, EIX, FI and&nbsp;G.\n\n===Bott periodicity theorem===\n{{main|Bott periodicity theorem}}\n\nIn the [[Bott periodicity theorem]], the [[loop spaces]] of the stable [[orthogonal group]] can be interpreted as reductive symmetric spaces.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]]\n*[[Relative root system]]\n*[[Satake diagram]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|doi=10.1007/BF01236659|first=D.

      "text": "{{for| finite groups with all characteristic abelian subgroups cyclic|group of symplectic type}}\n{{Lie groups |Classical}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |Topological}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the name '''symplectic group''' can refer to two different, but closely related, collections of mathematical [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], denoted {{math|Sp(2''n'', ''F'')}} and {{math|Sp(''n'')}}. The latter is called the '''compact symplectic group'''.  Many authors prefer slightly different notations, usually differing by factors of {{math|2}}. The notation used here is consistent with the size of the most common [[Matrix (math)|matrices]] which represent the groups. In [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]]'s classification of the [[simple Lie algebra]]s, the Lie algebra of the complex group {{math|Sp(2''n'', '''C''')}} is denoted {{math|''C<sub>n</sub>''}}, and {{math|Sp(''n'')}} is the [[Real form (Lie theory)#Compact real form|compact real form]] of {{math|Sp(2''n'', '''C''')}}. Note that when we refer to ''the'' (compact) symplectic group it is implied that we are talking about the collection of (compact) symplectic groups, indexed by their dimension {{math|''n''}}.\n\nThe name \"symplectic group\" is [[Symplectic topology#Name|due to Hermann Weyl]] as a replacement for the previous confusing names ('''line''') '''complex group''' and '''Abelian linear group''', and is the Greek analog of \"complex\".\n\n=={{math|Sp(2''n'', ''F'')}}==\nThe symplectic group of degree {{math|2''n''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|Sp(2''n'', ''F'')}}, is the [[group (math)|group]] of {{math|2''n'' × 2''n''}} [[symplectic matrix|symplectic matrices]] with entries in {{math|''F''}} with the operation of [[matrix multiplication]]:<blockquote><math>\\mathrm{Sp}(2n)\\ = \\ \\{\\,M\\in M_{2n\\times 2n}(F) \\ \\text{ with } \\ M^T\\!\\Omega\\, M = \\Omega\\,\\},</math> </blockquote>where ''M''<sup>T</sup> is the [[transpose]] of ''M'', and Ω is a  [[Nonsingular matrix|nonsingular]] [[skew-symmetric matrix]], often taken to be:\n\n:<sup><math>\\Omega = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & I_n \\\\\n-I_n & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math></sup>\n\nwhere ''I<sub>n</sub>'' is the identity matrix''.'' Since all symplectic matrices have [[determinant]] {{math|1}}, the symplectic group is a [[subgroup]] of the [[special linear group]] {{math|SL(2''n'', ''F'')}}.\n\nNotational warning: What is here called {{math|Sp(2''n'', ''F'')}} is often denoted {{math|Sp(''n'', ''F'')}}.\n\nDefined more abstractly as a [[classical group]], the symplectic group is the set of [[linear transformations]] of a {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional [[vector space]] over {{math|''F''}} which preserve a [[nondegenerate form|non-degenerate]] [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] [[bilinear form]]. Such a vector space is called a [[symplectic vector space]], and the symplectic group of an abstract symplectic vector space {{math|''V''}} is denoted {{math|Sp(''V'')}}.\n\nTypically, the field {{math|''F''}} is the field of [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}} or [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_representation",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''theta representation''' is a particular representation of the [[Heisenberg group]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. It gains its name from the fact that the [[Jacobi theta function]] is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup of the Heisenberg group. The representation was popularized by [[David Mumford]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe theta representation is a representation of the continuous Heisenberg group <math>H_3(\\mathbb{R})</math> over the field of the real numbers. In this representation, the group elements act on a particular [[Hilbert space]]. The construction below proceeds first by defining [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s that correspond to the Heisenberg group generators. Next, the Hilbert space on which these act is defined, followed by a demonstration of the [[isomorphism]] to the usual representations.\n\n===Group generators===\nLet ''f''(''z'') be a [[holomorphic function]], let ''a'' and ''b'' be [[real number]]s, and let <math>\\tau</math> be fixed, but arbitrary complex number in the [[upper half-plane]]; that is, so that the imaginary part of <math>\\tau</math> is positive. Define the operators ''S''<sub>''a''</sub> and ''T''<sub>''b''</sub> such that they act on holomorphic functions as\n\n:<math>(S_a f)(z) = f(z+a)= \\exp  (a \\partial_z)  ~ f(z) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>(T_b f)(z) = \\exp (i\\pi b^2 \\tau +2\\pi ibz) f(z+b\\tau)= \\exp( 2\\pi i bz + b \\tau \\partial_z) ~ f (z) .</math>\n\nIt can be seen that each operator generates a one-parameter subgroup:\n\n:<math>S_{a_1} (S_{a_2} f) = (S_{a_1} \\circ S_{a_2}) f = S_{a_1+a_2} f</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>T_{b_1} (T_{b_2} f) = (T_{b_1} \\circ T_{b_2}) f = T_{b_1+b_2} f.</math>\n\nHowever, ''S'' and ''T'' do not commute:\n\n:<math>S_a \\circ T_b = \\exp (2\\pi iab) \\; T_b \\circ S_a.</math>\n\nThus we see that ''S'' and ''T'' together with a [[unitary operator|unitary]] phase form a [[nilpotent]] [[Lie group]], the (continuous real) [[Heisenberg group]], parametrizable as <math>H=U(1)\\times\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}</math> where U(1) is the [[unitary group]].\n\nA general group element <math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)\\in H</math> then acts on a holomorphic function ''f''(''z'') as\n\n:<math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)\\;f(z)=\\lambda (S_a \\circ T_b f)(z) = \n\\lambda \\exp (i\\pi b^2 \\tau +2\\pi ibz) f(z+a+b\\tau)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lambda \\in U(1)</math>.  <math>U(1) = Z(H)</math> is the [[center of a group|center]] of ''H'', the [[commutator subgroup]] <math>[H, H]</math>. The parameter <math>\\tau</math> on <math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)</math> serves only to remind that every different value of <math>\\tau</math> gives rise to a different representation of the action of the group.\n\n===Hilbert space===\nThe action of the group elements <math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)</math> is unitary and irreducible on a certain Hilbert space of functions. For a fixed value of &tau;, define a norm on [[entire function]]s of the [[complex plane]] as\n\n:<math>\\Vert f \\Vert_\\tau ^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{C}}\n\\exp \\left( \\frac {-2\\pi y^2} {\\Im \\tau} \\right) |f(x+iy)|^2 \\  dx \\  dy.\n</math>\n\nHere, <math>\\Im \\tau</math> is the imaginary part of <math>\\tau</math> and the domain of integration is the entire complex plane. Let <math>\\mathcal{H}_\\tau</math> be the set of entire functions ''f'' with finite norm. The subscript <math>\\tau</math> is used only to indicate that the space depends on the choice of parameter <math>\\tau</math>. This <math>\\mathcal{H}_\\tau</math> forms a [[Hilbert space]]. The action of <math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)</math> given above is unitary on <math>\\mathcal{H}_\\tau</math>, that is, <math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)</math> preserves the norm on this space. Finally, the action of <math>U_\\tau(\\lambda,a,b)</math> on <math>\\mathcal{H}_\\tau</math> is [[irreducible representation|irreducible]].\n\nThis norm is closely related to that used to define [[Segal–Bargmann space]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n==Isomorphism==\nThe above ''theta representation'' of the Heisenberg group is isomorphic to the canonical [[Weyl representation]] of the Heisenberg group.  In particular, this implies that <math>\\mathcal{H}_\\tau</math> and [[Lp space|L<sup>2</sup>('''R''')]] are [[isomorphic]] as [[module (mathematics)|''H''-modules]]. Let\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{M}(a,b,c) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a & c \\\\ 0 & 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nstand for a general group element of <math>H_3(\\mathbb{R})</math>. In the canonical Weyl representation, for every real number ''h'', there is a representation <math>\\rho_h</math> acting on L<sup>2</sup>('''R''') as \n:<math>\\rho_h(M(a,b,c))\\;\\psi(x)= \\exp (ibx+ihc) \\psi(x+ha)</math> \nfor <math>x\\in\\mathbb{R}</math> and <math>\\psi\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})</math>.\n\nHere, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].

      "text": "{{Short description|Group that is a topological space with continuous group action}}\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n\n[[Image:Real number line.svg|thumb|right|350px|The [[real numbers]] form a topological group under addition]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''topological group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' together with a [[topological space|topology]] on ''G'' such that the group's binary operation and the group's inverse function are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions with respect to the topology. A topological group is a mathematical object with both an algebraic structure and a topological structure. Thus, one may perform algebraic operations, because of the group structure, and one may talk about continuous functions, because of the topology.\n\nTopological groups, along with [[continuous group action]]s, are used to study continuous [[symmetry|symmetries]], which have many applications, for example, [[Symmetry (physics)|in physics]].\n\n==Formal definition==\nA '''topological group''', ''G'', is a [[topological space]] which is also a group such that the group operations of product:\n:<math>G\\times G \\to G : (x,y)\\mapsto xy</math>\nand taking inverses:\n:<math>G\\to G : x \\mapsto x^{-1}</math>\n\nare continuous (''i.e.'' if for any open set <math>U\\subset G</math> we have that <math>f^{-1}(U)</math> is open in the domain <math>\\text{dom}(f)</math> of <math>f</math>, then the function is continuous). Here <math>G\\times G</math> is viewed as a topological space with the [[product topology]]. So the product is continuous if for all open <math>U\\subset G</math> such that <math>xy \\in U</math>, there exists open <math>V\\times W \\subset G\\times G</math> with <math>(x,y) \\in V \\times W</math> and <math>V\\cdot W := \\{pq: p\\in V, q \\in W \\} \\subset U</math>, and taking inverses is continuous if for all open <math>U \\subset G</math> with <math>x^{-1} \\in U</math>, there exists an open <math>V \\subset G</math> with <math>x \\in V</math>, such that <math>V^{-1} := \\{ p^{-1}: p \\in V \\} \\subset U</math>.\n\nAlthough not part of this definition, many authors<ref>Armstrong (1997), p. 73; Bredon (1997), p. 51.</ref> require that the topology on ''G'' be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]; it is equivalent to assume that the singleton containing the identity element 1 is a [[closed subset]] of ''G''. The reasons, and some equivalent conditions, are discussed below. In any case, any topological group can be made Hausdorff by taking an appropriate canonical quotient.\n\nIn the language of [[category theory]], topological groups can be defined concisely as [[group object]]s in the [[category of topological spaces]], in the same way that ordinary groups are group objects in the [[category of sets]]. Note that the axioms are given in terms of the maps (binary product, unary inverse, and nullary identity), hence are categorical definitions.\n\n===Homomorphisms===\nA '''homomorphism''' of topological groups means a continuous [[group homomorphism]] ''G'' <math>\\to</math> ''H''. An '''isomorphism''' of topological groups is a [[group isomorphism]] which is also a [[homeomorphism]] of the underlying topological spaces. This is stronger than simply requiring a continuous group isomorphism—the inverse must also be continuous. There are examples of topological groups which are isomorphic as ordinary groups but not as topological groups.  Indeed, any non-discrete topological group is also a topological group when considered with the discrete topology.  The underlying groups are the same, but as topological groups there is not an isomorphism.\n\nTopological groups, together with their homomorphisms, form a [[category theory|category]].\n\n==Examples==\nEvery group can be trivially made into a topological group by considering it with the [[discrete topology]]; such groups are called [[discrete group]]s. In this sense, the theory of topological groups subsumes that of ordinary groups.\n\nThe [[real number]]s, '''R''' with the usual topology form a topological group under addition. [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is also a topological group under addition, and more generally, every [[topological vector space]] forms an (abelian) topological group. Some other examples of [[abelian group|abelian]] topological groups are the [[circle group]] ''S''<sup>1</sup>, or the [[torus group|torus]] (''S''<sup>1</sup>)<sup>''n''</sup> for any natural number ''n''.\n\nThe [[classical group]]s are important examples of non-abelian topological groups. For instance, the [[general linear group]] GL(''n'','''R''') of all invertible ''n''-by-''n'' [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with real entries can be viewed as a topological group with the topology defined by viewing GL(''n'','''R''') as a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''×''n''</sup>. Another classical group is the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n''), the group of all [[linear map]]s from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to itself that preserve the [[Euclidean distance|length]] of all vectors. The orthogonal group is [[compact space|compact]] as a topological space. Much of [[Euclidean geometry]] can be viewed as studying the structure of the orthogonal group, or the closely related group ''O''(''n'') ⋉ '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> of [[Euclidean group|isometries]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nThe groups mentioned so far are all [[Lie group]]s, meaning that they are [[smooth manifold]]s in such a way that the group operations are [[smooth function|smooth]], not just continuous. Lie groups are the best-understood topological groups; many questions about Lie groups can be converted to purely algebraic questions about [[Lie algebra]]s and then solved.\n\nAn example of a topological group which is not a Lie group is the additive group '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s, with the topology inherited from '''R'''. This is a [[countable]] space, and it does not have the discrete topology. An important example for [[number theory]] is the group '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic integers]], for a [[prime number]] ''p'', meaning the [[inverse limit]] of the finite groups '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''</sup> as ''n'' goes to infinity. The group '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> is well behaved in that it is compact (in fact, homeomorphic to the [[Cantor set]]), but it differs from (real) Lie groups in that it is [[totally disconnected group|totally disconnected]]. More generally, there is a theory of [[p-adic Lie group]]s, including compact groups such as GL(''n'','''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>) as well as [[locally compact group]]s such as GL(''n'','''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>), where '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> is the locally compact [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[p-adic number]]s.\n\nThe group '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> is a [[pro-finite group]]; it is isomorphic to a subgroup of the product <math>\\prod_{n \\geq 1} \\mathbb{Z} / p^n </math> in such a way that its topology is induced by the product topology, where the finite groups <math>\\mathbb{Z} / p^n</math> are given the discrete topology. Another large class of pro-finite groups important in number theory are [[absolute Galois group]]s.\n\nSome topological groups can be viewed as [[infinite dimensional Lie group]]s; this phrase is best understood informally, to include several different families of examples. For example, a [[topological vector space]], such as a [[Banach space]] or [[Hilbert space]], is an abelian topological group under addition. Some other infinite-dimensional groups that have been studied, with varying degrees of success, are [[loop group]]s, [[Kac–Moody algebra|Kac–Moody group]]s, [[diffeomorphism group]]s, [[homeomorphism group]]s, and [[gauge group]]s.\n\nIn every [[Banach algebra]] with multiplicative identity, the set of invertible elements forms a topological group under multiplication. For example, the group of invertible [[bounded operator]]s on a Hilbert space arises this way.\n\n==Properties==\nThe inversion operation on a topological group ''G'' is a homeomorphism from ''G'' to itself. Likewise, if ''a'' is any element of ''G'', then left or right multiplication by ''a'' yields a homeomorphism ''G'' → ''G''.\n\nEvery topological group can be viewed as a [[uniform space]] in two ways; the ''left uniformity'' turns all left multiplications into uniformly continuous maps while the ''right uniformity'' turns all right multiplications into uniformly continuous maps.<ref>Bourbaki (1998), section III.3.</ref> If ''G'' is not abelian, then these two need not coincide. The uniform structures allow one to talk about notions such as [[completeness (topology)|completeness]], [[uniformly continuous|uniform continuity]] and [[uniform convergence]] on topological groups.\n\nAs a uniform space, every topological group is [[completely regular space|completely regular]]. It follows that if the identity element is closed in a topological group ''G'', then ''G'' is T<sub>2</sub> ([[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]), even T<sub>3½</sub> ([[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]). If ''G'' is not Hausdorff, then one can obtain a Hausdorff group by passing to the quotient group ''G''/''K'', where ''K'' is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the identity.<ref>Bourbaki (1998), section III.2.7.</ref> This is equivalent to taking the [[Kolmogorov space#The Kolmogorov quotient|Kolmogorov quotient]] of ''G''.\n\nThe '''[[Garrett Birkhoff|Birkhoff]]–[[Shizuo Kakutani|Kakutani]] theorem''' states that the following three conditions on a topological group ''G'' are equivalent:<ref>Montgomery & Zippin (1955), section 1.22.</ref>\n*The identity element 1 is closed in ''G'', and there is a countable [[neighborhood basis|basis of neighborhoods]] for 1 in ''G''.\n*''G'' is [[metrizable]] (as a topological space).\n*There is a left-invariant metric on ''G'' that induces the given topology on ''G''. (A metric on ''G'' is called left-invariant if for each point ''a'' in ''G'', the map ''x'' ↦ ''ax'' is an [[isometry]] from ''G'' to itself.)\n\nEvery [[subgroup]] of a topological group is itself a topological group when given the [[subspace topology]]. If ''H'' is a subgroup of ''G'', the set of left [[coset]]s ''G''/''H'' with the [[quotient topology]] is called a [[homogeneous space]] for ''G''. The quotient map ''q'' : ''G'' → ''G''/''H'' is always [[open map|open]]. For example, for a positive integer ''n'', the [[n-sphere|sphere]] ''S''<sup>''n''</sup> is a homogeneous space for the [[rotation group]] SO(''n''+1) in '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup>, with ''S''<sup>''n''</sup> = SO(''n''+1)/SO(''n''). A homogeneous space ''G''/''H'' is Hausdorff if and only if ''H'' is closed in ''G''.<ref>Bourbaki (1998), section III.2.5.</ref> Partly for this reason, it is natural to concentrate on closed subgroups when studying topological groups.\n\nEvery open subgroup ''H'' is also closed in ''G'', since the complement of ''H'' is the open set given by the union of open sets ''gH'' for ''g'' in G \\ H.\n\nIf ''H'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'', then the [[quotient group]] ''G''/''H'' becomes a topological group when given the quotient topology. It is Hausdorff if and only if ''H'' is closed in ''G''. For example, the quotient group '''R'''/'''Z''' is isomorphic to the circle group ''S''<sup>1</sup>.\n\nIf ''H'' is a subgroup of ''G'' then the closure of ''H'' is also a subgroup. Likewise, if ''H'' is a normal subgroup of ''G'', the closure of ''H'' is normal in ''G''.\n\nIn any topological group, the [[identity component]] (i.e., the [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] containing the identity element) is a closed normal subgroup. If ''C'' is the identity component and ''a'' is any point of ''G'', then the left coset ''aC'' is the component of ''G'' containing ''a''. So the collection of all left cosets (or right cosets) of ''C'' in ''G'' is equal to the collection of all components of ''G''. It follows that the quotient group ''G''/''C'' is totally disconnected.<ref>Bourbaki (1998), section I.11.5.</ref>\n\nThe [[isomorphism theorem]]s from ordinary group theory are not always true in the topological setting. This is because a bijective homomorphism need not be an isomorphism of topological groups. The theorems are valid if one places certain restrictions on the maps involved. For example, the first isomorphism theorem states that if ''f'' : ''G'' → ''H'' is a homomorphism, then the homomorphism from ''G''/ker(''f'') to im(''f'') is an isomorphism if and only if the map ''f'' is open onto its image.<ref>Bourbaki (1998), section III.2.8.</ref>\n\n==Hilbert's fifth problem==\nThere are several strong results on the relation between topological groups and Lie groups. First, every continuous homomorphism of Lie groups <math>G \\to H</math> is smooth. It follows that a topological group has a unique structure of a Lie group if one exists. Also, [[closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]] says that every closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie subgroup, in particular a smooth [[submanifold]].\n\n'''[[Hilbert's fifth problem]]''' asked whether a topological group ''G'' which is a [[topological manifold]] must be a Lie group. In other words, does ''G'' have the structure of a smooth manifold, making the group operations smooth? As shown by [[Andrew Gleason]], [[Deane Montgomery]], and [[Leo Zippin]], the answer to this problem is yes.<ref>Montgomery & Zippin (1955), section 4.10.</ref> In fact, ''G'' has a [[real analytic]] structure. Using the smooth structure, one can define the Lie algebra of ''G'', an object of [[linear algebra]] which determines a [[connected space|connected]] group ''G'' up to [[covering space]]s. As a result, the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem reduces the classification of topological groups that are topological manifolds to an algebraic problem, albeit a complicated problem in general.\n\nThe theorem also has consequences for broader classes of topological groups. First, every [[compact group]] (understood to be Hausdorff) is an inverse limit of compact Lie groups. (One important case is an inverse limit of finite groups, called a [[profinite group]]. For example, the group '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> of ''p''-adic integers and the [[absolute Galois group]] of a field are profinite groups.) Furthermore, every connected locally compact group is an inverse limit of connected Lie groups.<ref>Montgomery & Zippin (1955), section 4.6.</ref> At the other extreme, a totally disconnected locally compact group always contains a compact open subgroup, which is necessarily a profinite group.<ref>Bourbaki (1998), section III.4.6.</ref> (For example, the locally compact group GL(''n'','''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>) contains the compact open subgroup GL(''n'','''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>), which is the inverse limit of the finite groups GL(''n'','''Z'''/''p''<sup>''r''</sup>) as ''r'' goes to infinity.)\n\n==Representations of compact or locally compact groups==\nAn '''action''' of a topological group ''G'' on a topological space ''X'' is a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' such that the corresponding function ''G'' × ''X'' → ''X'' is continuous. Likewise, a '''[[representation theory|representation]]''' of a topological group ''G'' on a real or complex topological vector space ''V'' is a continuous action of ''G'' on ''V'' such that for each ''g'' in ''G'', the map ''v'' ↦ ''gv'' from ''V'' to itself is linear.\n\nGroup actions and representation theory are particularly well understood for compact groups, generalizing what happens for [[representation theory of finite groups|finite group]]s. For example, every finite-dimensional (real or complex) representation of a compact group is a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representation]]s. An infinite-dimensional [[unitary representation]] of a compact group can be decomposed as a Hilbert-space direct sum of irreducible representations, which are all finite-dimensional; this is part of the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]].<ref>Hewitt & Ross (1970), Theorem 27.40.</ref> For example, the theory of [[Fourier series]] describes the decomposition of the unitary representation of the circle group ''S''<sup>1</sup> on the complex Hilbert space L<sup>2</sup>(''S''<sup>1</sup>). The irreducible representations of ''S''<sup>1</sup> are all 1-dimensional, of the form ''z'' ↦ ''z''<sup>''n''</sup> for integers ''n'' (where ''S''<sup>1</sup> is viewed as a subgroup of the multiplicative group '''C'''*). Each of these representations occurs with multiplicity 1 in L<sup>2</sup>(''S''<sup>1</sup>).\n\nThe irreducible representations of all compact connected Lie groups have been classified. In particular, the [[character theory | character]] of each irreducible representation is given by the [[Weyl character formula]].\n\nMore generally, locally compact groups have a rich theory of [[harmonic analysis]], because they admit a natural notion of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[integral]], given by the [[Haar measure]]. Every unitary representation of a locally compact group can be described as a [[direct integral]] of irreducible unitary representations. (The decomposition is essentially unique if ''G'' is of [[C*-algebra#Type for C*-algebras|Type I]], which includes the most important examples such as abelian groups and [[semisimple Lie group]]s.<ref>Mackey (1976), section 2.4.</ref>) A basic example is the [[Fourier transform]], which decomposes the action of the additive group '''R''' on the Hilbert space L<sup>2</sup>('''R''') as a direct integral of the irreducible unitary representations of '''R'''. The irreducible unitary representations of '''R''' are all 1-dimensional, of the form ''x'' ↦ ''e''<sup>2π''iax''</sup> for ''a'' ∈ '''R'''.\n\nThe irreducible unitary representations of a locally compact group may be infinite-dimensional. A major goal of representation theory, related to the [[Langlands classification]] of [[admissible representation]]s, is to find the [[unitary dual]] (the space of all irreducible unitary representations) for the semisimple Lie groups. The unitary dual is known in many cases such as [[representation theory of SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]], but not all.\n\nFor a locally compact abelian group ''G'', every irreducible unitary representation has dimension 1. In this case, the unitary dual <math>\\hat{G}</math> is a group, in fact another locally compact abelian group. [[Pontryagin duality]] states that for a locally compact abelian group ''G'', the dual of <math>\\hat{G}</math> is the original group ''G''. For example, the dual group of the integers '''Z''' is the circle group ''S''<sup>1</sup>, while the group '''R''' of real numbers is isomorphic to its own dual.\n\nEvery locally compact group ''G'' has a good supply of irreducible unitary representations; for example, enough representations to distinguish the points of ''G'' (the [[Gelfand–Raikov theorem]]). By contrast, representation theory for topological groups that are not locally compact has so far been developed only in special situations, and it may not be reasonable to expect a general theory. For example, there are many abelian [[Banach manifold|Banach–Lie groups]] for which every representation on Hilbert space is trivial.<ref>Banaszczyk (1983).</ref>\n\n==Homotopy theory of topological groups==\nTopological groups are special among all topological spaces, even in terms of their [[homotopy type]]. One basic point is that a topological group ''G'' determines a path-connected topological space, the [[classifying space]] ''BG'' (which classifies [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundles]] over topological spaces, under mild hypotheses). The group ''G'' is isomorphic in the [[model category#Homotopy and the homotopy category|homotopy category]] to the [[loop space]] of ''BG''; that implies various restrictions on the homotopy type of ''G''.<ref>Hatcher (2001), Theorem 4.66.</ref> Some of these restrictions hold in the broader context of [[H-space]]s.\n\nFor example, the [[fundamental group]] of a topological group ''G'' is abelian. (More generally, the [[Whitehead product]] on the homotopy groups of ''G'' is zero.) Also, for any field ''k'', the [[cohomology]] ring ''H''*(''G'',''k'') has the structure of a [[Hopf algebra]]. In view of structure theorems on Hopf algebras by [[Heinz Hopf]] and [[Armand Borel]], this puts strong restrictions on the possible cohomology rings of topological groups. In particular, if ''G'' is a path-connected topological group whose rational cohomology ring ''H''*(''G'','''Q''') is finite-dimensional in each degree, then this ring must be a free [[graded-commutative]] algebra over '''Q''', that is, the [[tensor product of algebras|tensor product]] of a [[polynomial ring]] on generators of even degree with an [[exterior algebra]] on generators of odd degree.<ref>Hatcher (2001), Theorem 3C.4.</ref>\n\nIn particular, for a connected Lie group ''G'', the rational cohomology ring of ''G'' is an exterior algebra on generators of odd degree. Moreover, a connected Lie group ''G'' has a [[maximal compact subgroup]] ''K'', which is unique up to conjugation, and the inclusion of ''K'' into ''G'' is a [[homotopy equivalence]]. So describing the homotopy types of Lie groups reduces to the case of compact Lie groups. For example, the maximal compact subgroup of SL(2,'''R''') is the circle group SO(2), and the homogeneous space SL(2,'''R''')/SO(2) can be identified with the [[hyperbolic plane]]. Since the hyperbolic plane is [[contractible space|contractible]], the inclusion of the circle group into SL(2,'''R''') is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nFinally, compact connected Lie groups have been classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]], [[Élie Cartan]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]. As a result, there is an essentially complete description of the possible homotopy types of Lie groups. For example, a compact connected Lie group of dimension at most 3 is either a torus, the group [[SU(2)]] ([[diffeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere ''S''<sup>3</sup>), or its quotient group SU(2)/{±1} ≅ [[SO(3)]] (diffeomorphic to [[real projective space|'''RP'''<sup>3</sup>]]).\n\n==Generalizations==\nVarious generalizations of topological groups can be obtained by weakening the continuity conditions:<ref>Arhangel'skii & Tkachenko (2008), p. 12.</ref>\n* A [[semitopological group]] is a group ''G'' with a topology such that for each ''c'' in ''G'' the two functions ''G'' → ''G'' defined by <math>x\\mapsto xc</math> and <math>x\\mapsto cx</math> are continuous.\n* A [[quasitopological group]] is a semitopological group in which the function mapping elements to their inverses is also continuous.\n* A [[paratopological group]] is a group with a topology such that the group operation is continuous.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lie group]]\n*[[Algebraic group]]\n*[[Compact group]]\n*[[Profinite group]]\n*[[Locally compact group]]\n*[[Topological ring]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last1=Arhangel'skii|first1= Alexander | authorlink1 = Alexander Arhangelskii | last2=Tkachenko|first2= Mikhail | title=Topological Groups and Related Structures | publisher=[[World Scientific]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-90-78677-06-2 | mr=2433295}}\n*{{cite book | last=Armstrong|first= Mark A. | title=Basic Topology | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | edition=1st | year=1997 | isbn=0-387-90839-0 | mr=0705632}}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Wojciech | author1-last=Banaszczyk | title=On the existence of exotic Banach–Lie groups | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | volume=264 | issue=4 | year=1983 | pages=485–493 | doi=10.1007/BF01456956 | mr=0716262 }}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Nicolas | author1-last=Bourbaki | author1-link=Nicolas Bourbaki | year=1998 | title=General Topology.

For the group of unitary matrices with determinant 1, see [[Special unitary group]].\n\nIn the simple case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}, the group U(1) corresponds to the [[circle group]], consisting of all [[complex numbers]] with [[Complex number#Absolute value and distance|absolute value]] 1 under multiplication. All the unitary groups contain copies of this group.\n\nThe unitary group U(''n'') is a real [[Lie group]] of dimension ''n''<sup>2</sup>. The [[Lie algebra]] of U(''n'') consists of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} [[skew-Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian matrices]], with the [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]] given by the [[commutator]].\n\nThe '''general unitary group''' (also called the '''group of unitary similitudes''') consists of all matrices ''A'' such that ''A''<sup>∗</sup>''A'' is a nonzero multiple of the [[identity matrix]], and is just the product of the unitary group with the group of all positive multiples of the identity matrix.\n\n==Properties==\nSince the [[determinant]] of a unitary matrix is a complex number with norm {{math|1}}, the determinant gives a [[group homomorphism]]\n\n:<math>\\det \\colon \\operatorname{U}(n) \\to \\operatorname{U}(1).</math>\n\nThe [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of this homomorphism is the set of unitary matrices with determinant {{math|1}}. This subgroup is called the '''[[special unitary group]]''', denoted {{math|SU(''n'')}}. We then have a [[short exact sequence]] of Lie groups:\n\n:<math>1 \\to \\operatorname{SU}(n) \\to \\operatorname{U}(n) \\to \\operatorname{U}(1) \\to 1.</math>\n\nTherefore {{math|U(''n'')}} may be written as a [[semidirect product]] of {{math|SU(''n'')}} by {{math|U(1)}}. Here the {{math|U(1)}} subgroup of {{math|U(''n'')}} can be taken to consist of matrices that are diagonal, with {{math|''e<sup>iθ</sup>''}} in the upper left corner and {{math|1}} on the rest of the diagonal.\n\nThe unitary group {{math|U(''n'')}} is [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] for {{math|''n'' > 1}}. The [[center of a group|center]] of {{math|U(''n'')}} is the set of scalar matrices {{math|''λI''}} with {{math|''λ'' ∈ U(1)}}; this follows from [[Schur's lemma]]. The center is then isomorphic to {{math|U(1)}}. Since the center of {{math|U(''n'')}} is a {{math|1}}-dimensional abelian [[normal subgroup]] of {{math|U(''n'')}}, the unitary group is not [[Semisimple algebraic group|semisimple]], but it is [[Reductive group|reductive]].\n\n==Topology==\nThe unitary group U(''n'') is endowed with the [[relative topology]] as a subset of {{nowrap|M(''n'', '''C''')}}, the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} complex matrices, which is itself homeomorphic to a 2''n''<sup>2</sup>-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].\n\nAs a topological space, U(''n'') is both [[compact space|compact]] and [[connected space|connected]]. To show that U(''n'') is connected, recall that any unitary matrix ''A'' can be [[diagonalized]] by another unitary matrix ''S''. Any diagonal unitary matrix must have complex numbers of absolute value 1 on the main diagonal. We can therefore write\n\n:<math>A = S\\,\\operatorname{diag}\\left(e^{i\\theta_1}, \\dots, e^{i\\theta_n}\\right)\\,S^{-1}.</math>\n\nA [[path (topology)|path]] in U(''n'') from the identity to ''A'' is then given by\n\n:<math>t \\mapsto S \\, \\operatorname{diag}\\left(e^{it\\theta_1}, \\dots, e^{it\\theta_n}\\right)\\,S^{-1} .</math>\n\nThe unitary group is not [[simply connected]]; the fundamental group of U(''n'') is infinite cyclic for all ''n'':<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.11</ref>\n\n:<math>\\pi_1(\\operatorname{U}(n)) \\cong \\mathbf{Z} .</math>\n\nTo see this, note that the above splitting of U(''n'') as a semidirect product of SU(''n'') and U(1) induces a topological product structure on U(''n''), so that\n:<math>\\pi_1(\\operatorname{U}(n)) \\cong \\pi_1(\\operatorname{SU}(n)) \\times \\pi_1(\\operatorname{U}(1)).</math>\n\nNow the first unitary group U(1) is topologically a [[circle]], which is well known to have a [[fundamental group]] isomorphic to '''Z''', whereas <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math> is simply connected.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.11</ref>\n\nThe determinant map {{nowrap|det: U(''n'') → U(1)}} induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups, with the splitting {{nowrap|U(1) → U(''n'')}} inducing the inverse.\n\nThe [[Weyl group]] of U(''n'') is the [[symmetric group]] ''S<sub>n</sub>'', acting on the diagonal torus  by permuting the entries:\n:<math>\\operatorname{diag}\\left(e^{i\\theta_1}, \\dots, e^{i\\theta_n}\\right) \\mapsto \\operatorname{diag}\\left(e^{i\\theta_{\\sigma(1)}}, \\dots, e^{i\\theta_{\\sigma(n)}}\\right)</math>\n\n==Related groups==\n\n===2-out-of-3 property===\nThe unitary group is the 3-fold intersection of the [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]], [[symplectic group|symplectic]], and [[linear complex structure|complex]] groups:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{U}(n) = \\operatorname{O}(2n) \\cap \\operatorname{Sp}(2n, \\mathbf{R}) \\cap \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbf{C}).</math>\n\nThus a unitary structure can be seen as an orthogonal structure, a complex structure, and a symplectic structure, which are required to be ''compatible'' (meaning that one uses the same ''J'' in the complex structure and the symplectic form, and that this ''J'' is orthogonal; writing all the groups as matrix groups fixes a ''J'' (which is orthogonal) and ensures compatibility).\n\nIn fact, it is the intersection of any ''two'' of these three; thus a compatible orthogonal and complex structure induce a symplectic structure, and so forth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=V.I. |title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics |publisher=Springer |edition=Second |year=1989 |page=225}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/symplectic.html |title=Symplectic, Quaternionic, Fermionic |last=Baez |first=John |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the level of equations, this can be seen as follows:\n:<math>\\begin{array}{r|r}\n  \\text{Symplectic} &\n  A^\\mathsf{T}JA = J \\\\\n  \\hline\n  \\text{Complex} &\n  A^{-1}JA = J \\\\\n  \\hline\n  \\text{Orthogonal} &\n  A^\\mathsf{T} = A^{-1}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nAny two of these equations implies the third.\n\nAt the level of forms, this can be seen by decomposing a Hermitian form into its real and imaginary parts: the real part is symmetric (orthogonal), and the imaginary part is skew-symmetric (symplectic)—and these are related by the complex structure (which is the compatibility). On an [[almost Kähler manifold]], one can write this decomposition as {{math|1=''h'' = ''g'' + ''iω''}}, where {{mvar|h}} is the Hermitian form, {{mvar|g}} is the [[Riemannian metric]], {{mvar|i}} is the [[almost complex manifold|almost complex structure]], and {{mvar|ω}} is the [[almost symplectic manifold|almost symplectic structure]].\n\nFrom the point of view of [[Lie group]]s, this can partly be explained as follows: O(2''n'') is the [[maximal compact subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(2''n'', '''R''')}}, and U(''n'') is the maximal compact subgroup of both {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}} and Sp(2''n''). Thus the intersection {{nowrap|O(2''n'') ∩ GL(''n'', '''C''')}} or {{nowrap|O(2''n'') ∩ Sp(2''n'')}} is the maximal compact subgroup of both of these, so U(''n''). From this perspective, what is unexpected is the intersection {{nowrap|1=GL(''n'', '''C''') ∩ Sp(2''n'') = U(''n'')}}.\n\n===Special unitary and projective unitary groups===\n[[File:PSU-PU.svg|right]]\n{{see also|Special unitary group|Projective unitary group}}\n\nJust as the orthogonal group O(''n'') has the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n'') as subgroup and the [[projective orthogonal group]] PO(''n'') as quotient, and the [[projective special orthogonal group]] PSO(''n'') as [[subquotient]], the unitary group U(''n'') has associated to it the [[special unitary group]] SU(''n''), the [[projective unitary group]] PU(''n''), and the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU(''n''). These are related as by the commutative diagram at right; notably, both projective groups are equal: {{nowrap|1=PSU(''n'') = PU(''n'')}}.\n\nThe above is for the classical unitary group (over the complex numbers) – for [[#Finite_fields|unitary groups over finite fields]], one similarly obtains special unitary and projective unitary groups, but in general <math>\\operatorname{PSU}\\left(n, q^2\\right) \\neq \\operatorname{PU}\\left(n, q^2\\right)</math>.\n\n==G-structure: almost Hermitian==\nIn the language of [[G-structure]]s, a manifold with a U(''n'')-structure is an [[almost Hermitian manifold]].\n\n==Generalizations==\nFrom the point of view of [[Lie theory]], the classical unitary group is a real form of the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg group]] <math>{}^2\\!A_n</math>, which is an [[algebraic group]] that arises from the combination of the ''diagram automorphism'' of the general linear group (reversing the [[Dynkin diagram]] A<sub>''n''</sub>, which corresponds to transpose inverse) and the ''[[field automorphism]]'' of the extension '''C'''/'''R''' (namely [[complex conjugation]]). Both these automorphisms are automorphisms of the algebraic group, have order 2, and commute, and the unitary group is the fixed points of the product automorphism, as an algebraic group. The classical unitary group is a real form of this group, corresponding to the standard [[Hermitian form]] Ψ, which is positive definite.\n\nThis can be generalized in a number of ways:\n* generalizing to other Hermitian forms yields indefinite unitary groups {{nowrap|U(''p'', ''q'')}};\n* the field extension can be replaced by any degree 2 separable algebra, most notably a degree 2 extension of a finite field;\n* generalizing to other diagrams yields other [[groups of Lie type]], namely the other [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg groups]] <math>{}^2\\!D_n, {}^2\\!E_6, {}^3\\!D_4,</math> (in addition to <math>{}^2\\!A_n</math>) and [[Suzuki-Ree groups]]\n*: <math>{}^2\\!B_2\\left(2^{2n+1}\\right), {}^2\\!F_4\\left(2^{2n+1}\\right), {}^2\\!G_2\\left(3^{2n+1}\\right);</math>\n* considering a generalized unitary group as an algebraic group, one can take its points over various algebras.\n\n===Indefinite forms===\nAnalogous to the [[indefinite orthogonal group]]s, one can define an '''indefinite unitary group''', by considering the transforms that preserve a given Hermitian form, not necessarily positive definite (but generally taken to be non-degenerate). Here one is working with a vector space over the complex numbers.\n\nGiven a Hermitian form Ψ on a complex vector space ''V'', the unitary group U(Ψ) is the group of transforms that preserve the form: the transform ''M'' such that {{nowrap|1=Ψ(''Mv'', ''Mw'') = Ψ(''v'', ''w'')}} for all {{nowrap|''v'', ''w'' ∈ ''V''}}. In terms of matrices, representing the form by a matrix denoted Φ, this says that {{nowrap|1=''M''<sup>∗</sup>Φ''M'' = Φ}}.\n\nJust as for [[symmetric sesquilinear form|symmetric forms]] over the reals, Hermitian forms are determined by [[Signature of a quadratic form|signature]], and are all [[Matrix congruence|unitarily congruent]] to a diagonal form with ''p'' entries of 1 on the diagonal and ''q'' entries of −1. The non-degenerate assumption is equivalent to {{nowrap|1=''p'' + ''q'' = ''n''}}. In a standard basis, this is represented as a quadratic form as:\n:<math>\\lVert z \\rVert_\\Psi^2 = \\lVert z_1 \\rVert^2 + \\dots + \\lVert z_p \\rVert^2 - \\lVert z_{p+1} \\rVert^2 - \\dots - \\lVert z_n \\rVert^2</math>\n\nand as a symmetric form as:\n:<math>\\Psi(w, z) = \\bar w_1 z_1 + \\cdots + \\bar w_p z_p - \\bar w_{p+1}z_{p+1} - \\cdots - \\bar w_n z_n.</math>\n\nThe resulting group is denoted {{nowrap|U(''p'',''q'')}}.\n\n===Finite fields===\nOver the [[finite field]] with {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>}} elements, '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, there is a unique quadratic extension field, '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub>, with order 2 automorphism <math>\\alpha\\colon x \\mapsto x^q</math> (the ''r''th power of the [[Frobenius automorphism]]). This allows one to define a Hermitian form on an '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub> vector space ''V'', as an '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>-bilinear map <math>\\Psi\\colon V \\times V \\to K</math> such that <math>\\Psi(w, v) = \\alpha \\left(\\Psi(v, w)\\right)</math> and <math>\\Psi(w, cv) = c\\Psi(w, v)</math> for {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub>}}.{{clarify|What is K?|date=June 2014}} Further, all non-degenerate Hermitian forms on a vector space over a finite field<!-- clear from context, but I think it fails infinite fields of pos char--> are unitarily congruent to the standard one, represented by the identity matrix; that is, any Hermitian form is unitarily equivalent to\n:<math>\\Psi(w, v) = w^\\alpha \\cdot v = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^q v_i</math>\n\nwhere <math>w_i,v_i</math> represent the coordinates of {{nowrap|''w'', ''v'' ∈ ''V''}} in some particular '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub>-basis of the ''n''-dimensional space ''V'' {{harv|Grove|2002|loc=Thm. 10.3}}.\n\nThus one can define a (unique) unitary group of dimension ''n'' for the extension '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub>/'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, denoted either as {{nowrap|U(''n'', ''q'')}} or {{nowrap|U(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}} depending on the author. The subgroup of the unitary group consisting of matrices of determinant 1 is called the '''special unitary group''' and denoted {{nowrap|SU(''n'', ''q'')}} or {{nowrap|SU(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}}. For convenience, this article will use the {{nowrap|U(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}} convention.  The center of {{nowrap|U(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}} has order {{nowrap|''q'' + 1}} and consists of the scalar matrices that are unitary, that is those matrices ''cI<sub>V</sub>'' with <math>c^{q+1} = 1</math>.  The center of the special unitary group has order {{nowrap|gcd(''n'', ''q'' + 1)}} and consists of those unitary scalars which also have order dividing ''n''.  The quotient of the unitary group by its center is called the '''[[projective unitary group]]''', {{nowrap|PU(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}}, and the quotient of the special unitary group by its center is the '''[[projective special unitary group]]''' {{nowrap|PSU(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}}. In most cases ({{nowrap|''n'' > 1}} and {{nowrap|(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>) ∉ {(2, 2<sup>2</sup>), (2, 3<sup>2</sup>), (3, 2<sup>2</sup>)}{{void}}}}), {{nowrap|SU(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}} is a [[perfect group]] and {{nowrap|PSU(''n'', ''q''<sup>2</sup>)}} is a finite [[simple group]], {{harv|Grove|2002|loc=Thm. 11.22 and 11.26}}.\n\n===Degree-2 separable algebras===\nMore generally, given a field ''k'' and a degree-2 separable ''k''-algebra ''K'' (which may be a field extension but need not be), one can define unitary groups with respect to this extension.\n\nFirst, there is a unique ''k''-automorphism of ''K'' <math>a \\mapsto \\bar a</math> which is an involution and fixes exactly ''k'' (<math>a = \\bar{a}</math> if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' ∈ ''k''}}).<ref>Milne, [http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/aag.html Algebraic Groups and Arithmetic Groups], p. 103</ref> This generalizes complex conjugation and the conjugation of degree 2 finite field extensions, and allows one to define Hermitian forms and unitary groups as above.\n\n===Algebraic groups===\nThe equations defining a unitary group are polynomial equations over ''k'' (but not over ''K''): for the standard form {{nowrap|1=Φ = ''I''}}, the equations are given in matrices as {{nowrap|1=''A''<sup>∗</sup>''A'' = ''I''}}, where <math>A^* = \\bar{A}^\\mathsf{T}</math> is the [[conjugate transpose]]. Given a different form, they are {{nowrap|1=''A''<sup>∗</sup>Φ''A'' = Φ}}. The unitary group is thus an [[algebraic group]], whose points over a ''k''-algebra ''R'' are given by:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{U}(n, K/k, \\Phi)(R) := \\left\\{ A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, K \\otimes_k R) : A^*\\Phi A = \\Phi\\right\\}.</math>\n\nFor the field extension '''C'''/'''R''' and the standard (positive definite) Hermitian form, these yield an algebraic group with real and complex points given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\operatorname{U}(n, \\mathbf{C}/\\mathbf{R})(\\mathbf{R}) &= \\operatorname{U}(n) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{U}(n, \\mathbf{C}/\\mathbf{R})(\\mathbf{C}) &= \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbf{C}).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn fact, the unitary group is a [[linear algebraic group]].\n\n====Unitary group of a quadratic module====\nThe unitary group of a quadratic module is a generalisation of the linear algebraic group U just defined, which incorporates as special cases many different [[Classical group|classical algebraic groups]]. The definition goes back to Anthony Bak's thesis.<ref>Bak, Anthony (1969), \"On modules with quadratic forms\", ''Algebraic K-Theory and its Geometric Applications'' (editors&mdash;Moss R. M. F., Thomas C. B.) Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 108,  pp. 55-66, Springer. {{doi|10.1007/BFb0059990}}</ref>\n\nTo define it, one has to define quadratic modules first:\n\nLet ''R'' be a ring with anti-automorphism ''J'', <math>\\varepsilon \\in R^\\times</math> such that <math>r^{J^2} = \\varepsilon r \\varepsilon^{-1}</math> for all ''r'' in ''R'' and <math>\\varepsilon^J = \\varepsilon^{-1}</math>. Define\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\Lambda_\\text{min} &:= \\left\\{r \\in R \\ : \\ r - r^J\\varepsilon\\right\\}, \\\\\n  \\Lambda_\\text{max} &:= \\left\\{r \\in R \\ : \\ r^J\\varepsilon = -r\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nLet {{nowrap|Λ ⊆ ''R''}} be an additive subgroup of ''R'', then Λ is called ''form parameter'' if <math>\\Lambda_\\text{min} \\subseteq \\Lambda \\subseteq \\Lambda_\\text{max}</math> and <math>r^J \\Lambda r \\subseteq \\Lambda</math>. A pair {{nowrap|(''R'', Λ)}} such that ''R'' is a ring and Λ a form parameter is called ''form ring''.\n\nLet ''M'' be an ''R''-module and ''f'' a ''J''-sesquilinear form on ''M'' (i.e., <math>f(xr, ys) = r^J f(x, y)s</math> for any <math>x, y \\in M</math> and <math>r, s \\in R</math>). Define <math>h(x, y) := f(x, y) + f(y, x)^J \\varepsilon \\in R</math> and <math>q(x) := f(x, x) \\in R/\\Lambda</math>, then ''f'' is said to ''define'' the ''Λ-quadratic form'' {{nowrap|(''h'', ''q'')}} on ''M''. A ''quadratic module'' over {{nowrap|(''R'', Λ)}} is a triple {{nowrap|(''M'', ''h'', ''q'')}} such that ''M'' is an ''R''-module and {{nowrap|(''h'', ''q'')}} is a Λ-quadratic form.\n\nTo any quadratic module {{nowrap|(''M'', ''h'', ''q'')}} defined by a ''J''-sesquilinear form ''f'' on ''M'' over a form ring {{nowrap|(''R'', Λ)}} one can associate the ''unitary group''\n\n:<math>U(M) := \\{\\sigma \\in GL(M) \\ : \\ \\forall x, y \\in M, h(\\sigma x, \\sigma y) = h(x, y) \\text{ and } q(\\sigma x) = q(x) \\}.</math>\n\nThe special case where {{nowrap|1=Λ = Λ<sub>max</sub>}}, with ''J'' any non-trivial involution (i.e., <math>J \\neq id_R, J^2 = id_R</math> and {{nowrap|1=ε = −1}} gives back the \"classical\" unitary group (as an algebraic group).\n\n==Polynomial invariants==\nThe unitary groups are the automorphisms of two polynomials in real non-commutative variables:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  C_1 &= \\left(u^2 + v^2\\right) + \\left(w^2 + x^2\\right) + \\left(y^2 + z^2\\right) + \\ldots \\\\\n  C_2 &= \\left(uv - vu\\right) + \\left(wx - xw\\right) + \\left(yz - zy\\right) + \\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese are easily seen to be the real and imaginary parts of the complex form <math>Z \\overline{Z}</math>. The two invariants separately are invariants of O(2''n'') and Sp(2''n''). Combined they make the invariants of U(''n'') which is a subgroup of both these groups. The variables must be non-commutative in these invariants otherwise the second polynomial is identically zero.\n\n==Classifying space==\nThe [[classifying space]] for U(''n'') is described in the article [[classifying space for U(n)]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Special unitary group]]\n*[[Projective unitary group]]\n*[[Orthogonal group]]\n*[[Symplectic group]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Grove | first1=Larry C. | title=Classical groups and geometric algebra | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-2019-3 | mr=1859189  | year=2002 | volume=39}}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unitary Group}}\n[[Category:Lie groups]]"

Suppose that ''γ'' is a ''G''-valued field on the [[complex plane]]. More precisely, we want ''γ'' to be defined on the [[Riemann sphere]] <math>\\mathbf{S}^2,</math> which amounts to the complex plane [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]] by adding a [[point at infinity]].\n\nThe WZW model is then a [[nonlinear sigma model]] defined by ''γ'' with an [[action (physics)|action]] given by\n\n:<math>S_k(\\gamma)= -\\frac{k}{8\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbf{S}^2} d^2x\\, \\mathcal{K} \\left (\\gamma^{-1} \\partial^\\mu \\gamma, \\gamma^{-1} \\partial_\\mu \\gamma \\right ) + 2\\pi k S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma).</math>\n\nHere, {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub> {{=}} ∂/∂''x''<sup>''μ''</sup>}} is the [[partial derivative]] and the usual [[summation convention]] over indices is used, with a [[Euclidean metric]], <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> is the [[Killing form]] on ''g'', and thus the first term is the standard kinetic term of [[quantum field theory]].\n\nThe term ''S''<sup>WZ</sup> is called the ''Wess–Zumino term'' and can be written as\n\n:<math>S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma) = -\\frac{1}{48\\pi^2} \\int_{\\mathbf{B}^3} d^3y\\, \\epsilon^{ijk} \\mathcal{K} \\left( \\gamma^{-1} \\frac {\\partial \\gamma} {\\partial y^i}, \\left[\\gamma^{-1} \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial y^j}, \\gamma^{-1} \\frac {\\partial \\gamma} {\\partial y^k} \\right]\\right)</math>\n\nwhere [,] is the [[commutator]], {{math|''ε<sup>ijk</sup>''}} is the [[completely anti-symmetric tensor]], and the integration coordinates ''y<sup>i</sup>'' for ''i'' = 1,2,3 range over the [[unit ball]] <math>\\mathbf{B}^3.</math> In this integral, the field γ has been extended so that it is defined on the interior of the unit ball. This extension can always be done because the [[homotopy group]] <math>\\pi_2(G)</math> always vanishes for any compact, simply-connected Lie group, and we originally defined ''γ'' on the 2-sphere <math>\\mathbf{S}^2 = \\partial \\mathbf{B}^3.</math>\n\n===Pullback===\nNote that if ''e<sub>a</sub>'' are the basis vectors for the [[Lie algebra]], then <math>\\mathcal{K} (e_a, [e_b, e_c])</math> are the [[structure constants]] of the Lie algebra. Note also that the structure constants are completely anti-symmetric, and thus they define a [[alternating form|3-form]] on the [[group manifold]] of ''G''. Thus, the integrand above is just the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the harmonic 3-form to the ball <math>\\mathbf{B}^3.</math> Denoting the harmonic 3-form by ''c'' and the pullback by <math>\\gamma^*,</math> one then has \n\n:<math>S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma) = \\int_{\\mathbf{B}^3} \\gamma^{*} c.</math>\n\nThis form leads directly to a topological analysis of the WZ term.\n\nGeometrically, this term describes the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] of the respective manifold.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Braaten | first1 = E. | last2 = Curtright | first2 = T.

Consider two different extensions of γ to the interior of the ball. They are maps from flat 3-space into the Lie group ''G''. Consider now glueing these two balls together at their boundary <math>\\mathbf{S}^2</math> The result of the gluing is a topological 3-sphere; each ball <math>\\mathbf{B}^3</math> is a hemisphere of <math>\\mathbf{S}^3.</math> The two different extensions of ''γ'' on each ball now becomes a map <math>\\mathbf{S}^3\\to G.</math> However, the homotopy group <math>\\pi_3(G)=\\Z</math> for any compact, connected simple Lie group ''G''.\n\nThus, one has\n\n:<math>S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma) = S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma')+n,</math>\n\nwhere ''γ'' and ''γ′'' denote the two different extensions onto the ball, and ''n'', an integer, is the [[winding number]] of the glued-together map.\n\nThe physics that this model leads to will stay the same if\n\n:<math>\\exp \\left(i2\\pi k S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma) \\right)= \\exp \\left( i2\\pi k S^{\\mathrm WZ}(\\gamma')\\right).</math>\n\nThus, topological considerations lead one to conclude that the level ''k'' must be an integer when ''G'' is a connected, compact, simple Lie group. For a semisimple or disconnected compact Lie group, the level consists of an integer for each connected, simple component.\n\nThis topological obstruction can also be seen in the representation theory of the [[affine Lie algebra]] symmetry of the theory. When each level is a positive integer the affine Lie algebra has unitary highest weight [[representation theory|representations]] with highest [[weight (representation theory)|weight]]s that are dominant integral. Such representations are easier to work with as they decompose into finite-dimensional subalgebras with respect to the subalgebras spanned by each [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]], the corresponding negative root and their commutator, which is a [[Cartan matrix|Cartan generator]].\n\nOften one is interested in a WZW model with a non-compact simple Lie group ''G'', such as [[SL2(R)|<math>\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\R)</math>]] which has been used by [[Juan Maldacena]] and [[Hirosi Ooguri]] to describe [[string theory]] on a three-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Maldacena | first1 = J. | last2 = Ooguri | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1063/1.1377273 | title = Strings in AdS<sub>3</sub> and the SL(2,R) WZW model.

Correspondingly, the representation theory of such non-compact Lie groups is much richer than that of their compact counterparts.\n\n===Generalizations===\nAlthough in the above, the WZW model is defined on the [[Riemann sphere]], it can be generalized so that the field γ lives on a compact [[Riemann surface]].\n\n==Current algebra==\nIf we choose an orthonormal basis (with respect to the [[Killing form]]) <math> \\{t^a\\}_a </math> of the Lie algebra <math> \\mathfrak{g} = \\mathrm{Lie}(G) </math>, then we let <math> J^a(z) </math> be the quantisation of the <math> t^a </math>-component of the classical current <math> \\partial_z g g^{-1} </math> (in complex coordinates on the [[Riemann sphere]]).

      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar}}\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], an '''algebraic group''' (or '''group variety''') is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] that is an [[algebraic variety]], such that the multiplication and inversion operations are given by [[regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular map]]s on the variety.\n\nIn terms of [[category theory]], an algebraic group is a [[group object]] in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of algebraic varieties.\n\n==Classes==\nSeveral important classes of groups are algebraic groups, including:\n* [[Finite group]]s\n* GL(''n'', '''C'''), the [[general linear group]] of [[invertible matrices]] over '''C'''\n* [[Jet group]]\n* [[Elliptic curve]]s.\n\nTwo important classes of algebraic groups arise, that for the most part are studied separately: ''[[abelian variety|abelian varieties]]'' (the 'projective' theory) and ''[[linear algebraic group]]s'' (the 'affine' theory). There are certainly examples that are neither one nor the other&nbsp;— these occur for example in the modern theory of [[differential of the first kind|integrals of the second and third kinds]] such as the [[Weierstrass zeta function]], or the theory of [[generalized Jacobian]]s. But according to [[Chevalley's structure theorem]] any algebraic group is an extension of an [[abelian variety]] by a linear algebraic group. This is a result of [[Claude Chevalley]]: if ''K'' is a [[perfect field]], and ''G'' an algebraic group over ''K'', there exists a unique normal closed subgroup ''H'' in ''G'', such that ''H'' is a linear group and ''G''/''H'' an abelian variety.\n\nAccording to another basic theorem, any group in the category of [[affine variety|affine varieties]] has a [[Faithful representation|faithful]] finite-dimensional [[linear representation]]: we can consider it to be a [[matrix group]] over ''K'', defined by polynomials over ''K'' and with matrix multiplication as the group operation. For that reason a concept of ''affine algebraic group'' is redundant over a field&nbsp;— we may as well use a very concrete definition. Note that this means that algebraic group is narrower than [[Lie group]], when working over the field of real numbers: there are examples such as the [[universal cover]] of the 2×2 special linear group that are Lie groups, but have no faithful linear representation. A more obvious difference between the two concepts arises because the [[identity component]] of an affine algebraic group ''G'' is necessarily of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]] in ''G''.\n\nWhen one wants to work over a base ring ''R'' (commutative), there is the [[group scheme]] concept: that is, a [[group object]] in the category of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s over ''R''. ''Affine group scheme'' is the concept dual to a type of [[Hopf algebra]]. There is quite a refined theory of group schemes, that enters for example in the contemporary theory of abelian varieties.\n\n==Algebraic subgroup==\nAn '''algebraic subgroup''' of an algebraic group is a [[Zariski topology|Zariski-closed]] [[subgroup]].\nGenerally these are taken to be connected (or irreducible as a variety) as well.\n\nAnother way of expressing the condition is as a [[subgroup]] which is also a [[algebraic variety|subvariety]].\n\nThis may also be generalized by allowing [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] in place of varieties. The main effect of this in practice, apart from allowing subgroups in which the [[connected space|connected component]] is of finite index > 1,  is to admit non-[[reduced scheme]]s, in characteristic ''p''.\n\n==Coxeter groups==\n{{main|Coxeter group}}\n{{further|Field with one element}}\nThere are a number of analogous results between algebraic groups and [[Coxeter group]]s – for instance, the number of elements of the symmetric group is <math>n!</math>, and the number of elements of the general linear group over a finite field is the [[q-factorial|''q''-factorial]] <math>[n]_q!</math>; thus the symmetric group behaves as though it were a linear group over \"the field with one element\". This is formalized by the [[field with one element]], which considers Coxeter groups to be simple algebraic groups over the field with one element.\n\n== Glossary of algebraic groups ==\nThere are a number of [[mathematics|mathematical]] notions to study and classify algebraic groups.\n\nIn the sequel, ''G'' denotes an algebraic group over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n! notion!! explanation !! example !! remarks\n|-\n| [[linear algebraic group]]\n  || A Zariski closed subgroup of <math>{\\rm GL}_n</math> for some ''n''\n  || [[special linear group|<math>{\\rm SL}_n</math>]]\n  || Every affine algebraic group is isomorphic to a linear algebraic group, and vice versa\n|-\n| [[affine algebraic group]]\n  || An algebraic group which is an affine variety\n  || [[general linear group|<math>{\\rm GL}_n</math>]], non-example: [[elliptic curve]]\n  || The notion of affine algebraic group stresses the independence from any embedding in <math>{\\rm GL}_n</math>\n|-\n| commutative\n  || The underlying (abstract) group is [[abelian group|abelian]].\n  || <math>{\\mathbb G}_a</math> (the [[Abelian group|additive group]]), <math>{\\mathbb G}_m</math> (the [[multiplicative group]]),<ref>These two are the only connected one-dimensional linear groups, {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Springer|year = 1998|loc = Theorem 3.4.9}}</ref> any [[complete variety|complete]] algebraic group (see [[abelian variety]])\n  ||\n|-\n| [[diagonalizable group]]\n  ||A closed subgroup of <math>(\\mathbb{G}_m)^n</math>, the group of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]] (of size ''n''-by-''n'')\n  ||\n  ||\n|-\n| simple algebraic group\n  || A connected group which has no non-trivial connected normal subgroups\n  || <math>{\\rm SL}_n</math>\n  ||\n|-\n| [[semisimple group]]\n  || An affine algebraic group with trivial [[Radical of an algebraic group|radical]]\n  || <math>{\\rm SL}_n</math>, <math>{\\rm SO}_n</math>\n  || In characteristic zero, the Lie algebra of a semisimple group is a semisimple Lie algebra\n|-\n| [[reductive group]]\n  || An affine algebraic group with trivial [[Unipotent#Unipotent radical|unipotent radical]]\n  || Any finite group, <math>{\\rm GL}_n</math>\n  || Any semisimple group is reductive\n|-\n| [[unipotent group]]\n  || An affine algebraic group such that all elements are [[unipotent]]\n  || The group of upper-triangular ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with all diagonal entries equal to 1\n  || Any unipotent group is [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]]\n|-\n| [[Algebraic torus|torus]]\n  || A group that becomes isomorphic to <math>(\\mathbb{G}_m)^n</math> when passing to the [[algebraic closure]] of ''k''.\n  || <math>{\\rm SO}_2</math>\n  || ''G'' is said to be ''split'' by some bigger field ''k' '', if ''G'' becomes isomorphic to G<sub>m</sub><sup>''n''</sup> as an algebraic group over ''k'.''\n|-\n| [[character group]] ''X''<sub>∗</sub>(''G'')\n  || The group of characters, i.e., group homomorphisms <math>G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb G}_m</math>\n  || <math>X^*(\\mathbb{G}_m)\\cong\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n  ||\n|-\n| [[Lie algebra]] Lie(''G'')\n  || The [[tangent space]] of ''G'' at the unit element.\n  || <math>{\\rm Lie}({\\rm GL}_n)</math> is the space of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices\n  || Equivalently, the space of all left-invariant [[derivation (algebra)|derivations]].\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algebraic topology (object)]]\n*[[Borel subgroup]]\n*[[Tame group]]\n*[[Morley rank]]\n*[[Cherlin–Zilber conjecture]]\n*[[Adelic algebraic group]]\n*[[Pseudo-reductive group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Citation | editor1-last=Chevalley | editor1-first=Claude | title=Séminaire C.

      "text": "In [[abstract algebra]], an '''adelic algebraic group''' is a [[semitopological group]] defined by an [[algebraic group]] ''G'' over a [[number field]] ''K'', and the [[adele ring]] ''A'' = ''A''(''K'') of ''K''. It consists of the points of ''G'' having values in ''A''; the definition of the appropriate [[topological space|topology]] is straightforward only in case ''G'' is a [[linear algebraic group]]. In the case of ''G'' being an [[abelian variety]], it presents a technical obstacle, though it is known that the concept is potentially useful in connection with Tamagawa numbers. Adelic algebraic groups are widely used in [[number theory]], particularly for the theory of [[automorphic representation]]s, and the [[arithmetic of quadratic forms]].\n\nIn case ''G'' is a linear algebraic group, it is an [[affine algebraic variety]] in affine ''N''-space. The topology on the adelic algebraic group <math>G(A)</math> is taken to be the [[subspace topology]] in ''A''<sup>''N''</sup>, the [[Cartesian product]] of ''N'' copies of the adele ring. In this case, <math>G(A)</math>is a topological group.\n\n==Ideles==\nAn important example, the '''idele group''' ''I''(''K''), is the case of <math>G = GL_1</math>. Here the set of '''ideles''' (also ''idèles'' {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|z}}) consists of the invertible adeles; but the topology on the idele group is ''not'' their topology as a subset of the adeles. Instead, considering that <math>GL_1</math> lies in two-dimensional [[affine space]] as the '[[hyperbola]]' defined parametrically by\n\n: <math> \\{(t,t^{-1})\\}, </math>\n\nthe topology correctly assigned to the idele group is that induced by inclusion in ''A''<sup>2</sup>; composing with a projection, it follows that the ideles carry a [[finer topology]] than the subspace topology from&nbsp;''A''.\n\nInside ''A''<sup>''N''</sup>, the product ''K''<sup>''N''</sup> lies as a [[discrete subgroup]]. This means that ''G''(''K'') is a discrete subgroup of ''G''(''A''), also. In the case of the idele group, the [[quotient group]]\n\n: <math> I(K)/K^\\times \\, </math>\n\nis the '''idele class group'''. It is closely related to (though larger than) the [[ideal class group]]. The idele class group is not itself compact; the ideles must first be replaced by the ideles of norm 1, and then the image of those in the idele class group is a [[compact group]]; the proof of this is essentially equivalent to the finiteness of the class number.\n\nThe study of the [[Galois cohomology]] of idele class groups is a central matter in [[class field theory]]. [[Character (group theory)|Characters]] of the idele class group, now usually called [[Hecke character]]s, give rise to the most basic class of [[L-function]]s.\n\n==Tamagawa numbers==\n{{see also|Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers}}\n\nFor more general ''G'', the '''Tamagawa number''' is defined (or indirectly computed) as the measure of\n\n:''G''(''A'')/''G''(''K'').\n\n[[Tsuneo Tamagawa]]'s observation was that, starting from an invariant [[differential form]] ω on ''G'', defined ''over K'', the measure involved was [[well-defined]]: while ω could be replaced by ''c''ω with ''c'' a non-zero element of ''K'', the [[product formula]] for [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]s in ''K'' is reflected by the independence from ''c'' of the measure of the quotient, for the product measure constructed from ω on each effective factor. The computation of Tamagawa numbers for [[semisimple group]]s contains important parts of classical [[quadratic form]] theory.\n\n==History of the terminology==\nHistorically the ''idèles'' were introduced  by {{harvs|txt|last=Chevalley|authorlink=Claude Chevalley|year=1936}} under the name \"élément idéal\", which is \"ideal element\" in French, which {{harvtxt|Chevalley|1940}} then abbreviated to \"idèle\" following a suggestion of Hasse. (In these papers he also gave the ideles a non-[[Hausdorff topology]].) This was to formulate [[class field theory]] for infinite extensions in terms of topological groups. {{harvtxt|Weil|1938}} defined (but did not name) the ring of adeles in the function field case and pointed out that Chevalley's group of ''Idealelemente''  was the group of invertible elements of this ring. {{harvtxt|Tate|1950}} defined the ring of adeles as a restricted direct product, though he called its elements \"valuation vectors\" rather than adeles.\n\n{{harvtxt|Chevalley|1951}} defined the ring of adeles in the function field case, under the name \"repartitions\". The term ''adèle'' (short for additive idèles, and also a French woman's name) was in use shortly afterwards {{harv|Jaffard|1953}} and may have been introduced by [[André Weil]].  The general construction of adelic algebraic groups by {{harvtxt|Ono|1957}} followed the algebraic group theory founded by [[Armand Borel]] and [[Harish-Chandra]].\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2016}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Chevalley | first1=Claude | title=Généralisation de la théorie du corps de classes pour les extensions infinies. | language=French | jfm=62.1153.02  | year=1936 | journal=Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées  | volume=15 | pages=359–371}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Chevalley | first1=Claude | title=La théorie du corps de classes | jstor=1969013 | mr=0002357  | year=1940 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=41 | pages=394–418 | doi=10.2307/1969013}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Chevalley | first1=Claude | title=Introduction to the Theory of Algebraic Functions of One Variable | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Mathematical Surveys, No. VI | mr=0042164  | year=1951}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Jaffard | first1=Paul | title=Anneaux d'adèles (d'après Iwasawa) | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=SB_1954-1956__3__23_0 | publisher=Secrétariat mathématique, Paris | series=Séminaire Bourbaki, | mr=0157859  | year=1953}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ono | first1=Takashi | title=Sur une propriété arithmétique des groupes algébriques commutatifs | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1957__85__307_0 | mr=0094362  | year=1957 | journal=Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France | issn=0037-9484 | volume=85 | pages=307–323}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Tate | first1=John T. | title=Algebraic Number Theory (Proc.

      "text": "In algebraic group theory, '''approximation theorems''' are an extension of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] to [[algebraic group]]s ''G'' over [[global field]]s ''k''.\n\n==Use==\nThey give conditions for the group ''G''(''k'') to be dense in a restricted direct product of groups of the form ''G''(''k''<sub>''s''</sub>) for ''k''<sub>''s''</sub> a completion of ''k'' at the place ''s''. In weak approximation theorems the product  is over a finite set of places ''s'', while in strong approximation theorems the product is over all but a finite set of places.\n\n==History==\n{{harvtxt|Eichler|1938}} proved strong approximation for some classical groups.\nStrong approximation was established in the 1960s and 1970s, for semisimple simply-connected algebraic groups over [[global field]]s. The results for [[number field]]s are due to {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Martin Kneser|last=Kneser|year=1966}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Vladimir Platonov|last=Platonov|year=1969}}; the [[global field|function field]] case, over [[finite field]]s, is due to {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Grigory Margulis|last=Margulis|year=1977}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gopal Prasad|last=Prasad|year=1977}}. In the number field case Platonov also proved a related result over [[local field]]s called the [[Kneser–Tits conjecture]].\n\n==Formal definitions and properties==\nLet ''G'' be a linear algebraic group over a global field ''k'', and ''A'' the adele ring of ''k''. If ''S'' is a non-empty finite set of places of ''k'', then we write ''A''<sup>''S''</sup> for the ring of ''S''-adeles and ''A''<sub>''S''</sub> for the product of the completions ''k''<sub>''s''</sub>, for ''s'' in the finite set ''S''. For any choice of ''S'', ''G''(''k'') embeds in ''G''(''A''<sub>''S''</sub>) and ''G''(''A''<sup>''S''</sup>).\n\nThe question asked in ''weak'' approximation is whether the embedding of ''G''(''k'') in ''G''(''A''<sub>''S''</sub>) has dense image. If the group ''G'' is connected and ''k''-rational, then it satisfies weak approximation with respect to any set ''S'' {{harv|Platonov, Rapinchuk|1994|loc=p.402}}. More generally, for any connected group ''G'', there is a finite set ''T'' of finite places of ''k'' such that ''G'' satisfies weak approximation with respect to any set ''S'' that is disjoint with ''T'' {{harv|Platonov, Rapinchuk|1994|loc=p.415}}. In particular, if ''k'' is an algebraic number field then any group ''G'' satisfies weak approximation with respect to the set ''S'' = ''S''<sub>∞</sub> of infinite places.\n\nThe question asked in ''strong'' approximation is whether the embedding of ''G''(''k'') in ''G''(''A''<sup>''S''</sup>) has dense image, or equivalently whether the set\n\n:''G''(''k'')''G''(''A''<sub>''S''</sub>)\n\nis a [[dense subset]] in ''G''(''A''). The main theorem of strong approximation {{harv|Kneser|1966|loc=p.188}} states that a non-solvable linear algebraic group ''G'' over a global field ''k'' has strong approximation for the finite set ''S'' if and only if its [[Radical of an algebraic group|radical]] ''N'' is [[unipotent]], ''G''/''N'' is simply connected, and each almost simple component ''H'' of ''G''/''N'' has a non-compact component ''H''<sub>''s''</sub> for some ''s'' in ''S'' (depending on ''H'').\n\nThe proofs of strong approximation depended on the [[Hasse principle]] for algebraic groups, which for groups of type ''E''<sub>8</sub> was only proved several years later.\n\nWeak approximation holds for a broader class of groups, including [[adjoint group]]s and [[inner form]]s of [[Chevalley group]]s, showing that the strong approximation property is restrictive.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Superstrong approximation]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Eichler | first1=Martin | title=Allgemeine Kongruenzklasseneinteilungen der Ideale einfacher Algebren über algebraischen Zahlkörpern und ihre L-Reihen. | url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN002174561 | language=German | doi=10.1515/crll.1938.179.227 | year=1938 | journal=Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik | issn=0075-4102 | volume=179 | pages=227–251}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Kneser | first1=Martin | title=Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups (Proc.

They also give rise to very interesting examples of [[Riemannian manifold]]s and hence are objects of interest in [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]]. Finally, these two topics join in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s which is fundamental in modern number theory.\n\n==History==\n\nOne of the origins of the mathematical theory of arithmetic groups is algebraic number theory. The classical reduction theory of quadratic and Hermitian forms by [[Charles Hermite]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and others can be seen as computing [[fundamental domain]]s for the action of certain arithmetic groups on the relevant [[symmetric space]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Borel |first=Armand |date=1969 |title=Introduction aux groupes arithmétiques |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=244260 |publisher=Hermann}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Carl Ludwig |date=1989 |title=Lectures on the geometry of numbers |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1020761 |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref> The topic was related to Minkowski's [[Geometry of numbers]] and the early development of the study of arithmetic invariant of number fields such as the [[Discriminant of an algebraic number field|discriminant]]. Arithmetic groups can be thought of as a vast generalisation of the [[Dirichlet's unit theorem|unit group]]s of number fields to a noncommutative setting.\n\nThe same groups also appeared in analytic number theory as the study of classical modular forms and their generalisations developed. Of course the two topics were related, as can be seen for example in Langlands' computation of the volume of certain fundamental domains using analytic methods.<ref>{{citation |last=Langlands|first= R.

The state of the art after this period was essentially fixed in Raghunathan's treatise, published in 1972.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raghunathan |first=M.S. |date=1972 |title=Discrete subgroups of Lie groups |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=507234 |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\nIn the seventies Margulis revolutionised the topic by proving that in \"most\" cases the arithmetic constructions account for all lattices in a given Lie group.<ref>{{cite book | last=Margulis |first=Grigori |title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians (Vancouver, B.C., 1974), Vol. 2 |publisher=Canad.

The driving force behind this effort is mainly the [[Langlands program]] initiated by [[Robert Langlands]]. One of the main tool used there is the [[Selberg's trace formula|trace formula]] originating in Selberg's work<ref>{{cite journal| last=Selberg | first=Atle | date=1956 | title=Harmonic analysis ans discontinuous groups in weakly symmetric Riemannian spaces with applications to Dirichlet series | url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=88511 | journal=J.

With this definition, to the algebraic group <math>\\mathrm G</math> is associated a collection of \"discrete\" subgroups all commensurable to each other.\n\n=== Using number fields ===\n\nA natural generalisation of the construction above is as follows: let <math>F</math> be a [[number field]] with ring of integers <math>O</math> and <math>\\mathrm G</math> an algebraic group over <math>F</math>. If we are given an embedding <math>\\rho : \\mathrm{G} \\to \\mathrm{GL}_n</math> defined over <math>F</math> then the subgroup <math>\\rho^{-1}(\\mathrm{GL}_n(O)) \\subset \\mathrm G(F)</math> can legitimately be called an arithmetic group.\n\nOn the other hand, the class of groups thus obtained is not larger than the class of arithmetic groups as defined above. Indeed, if we consider the algebraic group <math>\\mathrm G'</math> over <math>\\Q</math> obtained by [[Weil restriction|restricting scalars]] from <math>F</math> to <math>\\Q</math> and the <math>\\Q </math>-embedding <math>\\rho' : \\mathrm G' \\to \\mathrm{GL}_{dn}</math> induced by <math>\\rho</math> (where <math>d = [F:\\Q ]</math>) then the group constructed above is equal to <math>(\\rho')^{-1}(\\mathrm{GL}_{nd}(\\Z))</math>.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe classical example of an arithmetic group is <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\Z)</math>, or the closely related groups <math>\\mathrm{PSL}_n(\\Z)</math>, <math>\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\Z)</math> and <math>\\mathrm{PGL}_n(\\Z)</math>. For <math>n = 2</math> the group <math>\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\Z)</math>, or sometimes <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\Z)</math>, is called the [[modular group]] as it is related to the [[modular curve]]. Similar examples are the [[Siegel modular form|Siegel modular groups]] <math>\\mathrm{Sp}_{2g}(\\Z)</math>.\n\nOther well-known and studied examples include the [[Bianchi group]]s <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(O_{-m}),</math> where <math>m > 0</math> is a square-free integer and <math>O_{-m}</math> is the ring of integers in the field <math>\\Q(\\sqrt{-m}),</math> and the [[Hilbert modular form|Hilbert—Blumenthal modular groups]] <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(O_m)</math>.\n\nAnother classical example is given by the integral elements in the orthogonal group of a quadratic form defined over a number field, for example <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n,1)(\\Z )</math>. A related construction is by taking the unit groups of [[order (ring theory)|orders]] in [[quaternion algebra]]s over number fields (for example the [[Hurwitz quaternion order]]). Similar constructions can be performed with unitary groups of [[hermitian form]]s, a well-known example is the [[Picard modular group]].\n\n== Arithmetic lattices in semisimple Lie groups ==\n\nWhen <math>G</math> is a Lie group one can define an arithmetic lattice in <math>G</math> as follows: for any algebraic groups <math>\\mathrm G</math> defined over <math>\\Q</math> such that there is a morphism <math>\\mathrm G(\\R) \\to G</math> with compact kernel, the image of an arithmetic subgroup in <math>\\mathrm G(\\Q)</math> is an arithmetic lattice in <math>G</math>. Thus, for example, if <math>G = \\mathrm G(\\R)</math> and <math>G</math> is a subgroup of <math>\\mathrm{GL}_n</math> then <math>G \\cap \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\Z)</math> is an arithmetic lattice in <math>G</math> (but there are many more, corresponding to other embeddings); for instance, <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\Z)</math> is an arithmetic lattice in <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\R )</math>.\n\n=== The Borel–Harish-Chandra theorem ===\n\nA [[Lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in a Lie group is usually defined as a discrete subgroup with finite covolume. The terminology introduced above is coherent with this, as a theorem due to Borel and Harish-Chandra states that an arithmetic subgroup in a semisimple Lie group is of finite covolume (the discreteness is obvious).\n\nThe theorem is more precise: it tells that the arithmetic lattice is cocompact if and only if the \"form\" of <math>G</math> used to define it (i.e. the <math>\\Q </math>-group <math>\\mathrm G</math>) is anisotropic. For example, the arithmetic lattice associated to a quadratic form in <math>n</math> variables over <math>\\Q</math> will be co-compact in the associated orthogonal group if and only if the quadratic form does not vanish at any point in <math>\\Q^n \\setminus \\{ 0\\}</math>.\n\n=== Margulis arithmeticity theorem ===\n\nThe spectacular result that Margulis obtained is a partial converse to the Borel—Harish-Chandra theorem: for certain Lie groups ''any'' lattice is arithmetic. This result is true for all irreducible lattice in semisimple Lie groups of real rank larger than two.<ref>{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Girgori |date=1991 |title=Discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Witte-Morris |first=Dave |date=2015 |title=Introduction to arithmetic groups |chapter=16 |url=http://deductivepress.ca/ }}</ref> For example, all lattices in <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\R )</math> are arithmetic when <math>n \\ge 3</math>. The main new ingredient that Margulis used to prove his theorem was the [[superrigidity]] of lattices in higher-rank groups that he proved for this purpose.\n\nIrreducibility only plays a rôle when <math>G</math> has a factor of real rank one (otherwise the theorem always holds) and is not simple: it means that for any product decomposition <math>G = G_1\\times G_2</math> the lattice is not commensurable to a product of lattices in each of the factors <math>G_i</math>. For example, the lattice <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\Z [\\sqrt 2])</math> in <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\R) \\times \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\R)</math> is irreducible, while <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\Z) \\times \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\Z)</math> is not.\n\nThe Margulis arithmeticity (and superrigidity) theorem holds for certain rank 1 Lie groups, namely <math>\\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)</math> for <math>n \\geqslant 1 </math> and the exceptional group <math>F_4^{-20}</math>.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Gromov | first1=Mikhail | last2=Schoen | first2=Richard | title=Harmonic maps into singular spaces and p-adic superrigidity for lattices in groups of rank one | journal=Inst.

These are always finite-index subgroups and the congruence subgroup problem roughly asks whether all subgroups are obtained in this way. The conjecture (usually attributed to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] is that this is true for (irreducible) arithmetic lattices in higher-rank groups and false in rank-one groups. It is still open in this generality but there are many results establishing it for specific lattices (in both its positive and negative cases).\n\n== S-arithmetic groups ==\n\nInstead of taking integral points in the definition of an arithmetic lattice one can take points which are only integral away from a finite number of primes.

The prototypical example is <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2 \\left( \\Z \\left[\\tfrac 1 p \\right] \\right)</math>.

Here the group ''B'' is a Borel subgroup and ''N'' is the normalizer of a [[maximal torus]] contained in ''B''.\n\nThe notion was introduced by [[Armand Borel]], who played a leading role in the development of the theory of algebraic groups.\n\n==Parabolic subgroups==\nSubgroups between a Borel subgroup ''B'' and the ambient group ''G'' are called '''parabolic subgroups'''. \nParabolic subgroups ''P'' are also characterized, among algebraic subgroups, by the condition that ''G''/''P'' is a [[complete variety]]. \nWorking over algebraically closed fields, the Borel subgroups turn out to be the '''minimal parabolic subgroups''' in this sense. Thus B is a Borel subgroup when the homogeneous space G/B is a complete variety which is \"as large as possible\".\n\nFor a simple algebraic group ''G'', the set of [[conjugacy class]]es of parabolic subgroups is in bijection with the set of all subsets of nodes of the corresponding [[Dynkin diagram]]; the Borel subgroup corresponds to the empty set and ''G'' itself corresponding to the set of all nodes. (In general each node of the Dynkin diagram determines a simple negative root and thus a one-dimensional 'root group' of ''G''---a subset of the nodes thus yields a parabolic subgroup, generated by ''B'' and the corresponding negative root groups. Moreover, any parabolic subgroup is conjugate to such a parabolic subgroup.)\n\n== Example ==\nLet <math>G = GL_4(\\mathbb{C})</math>.

It was introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Pierre|last=Cartier|year=1962|authorlink=Pierre Cartier (mathematician)}}.\n\n==Definition using characters==\n\nGiven any finite flat commutative group scheme ''G'' over ''S'', its Cartier dual is the group of characters, defined as the functor that takes any ''S''-scheme ''T'' to the abelian group of group scheme homomorphisms from the base change ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> to '''G'''<sub>''m'',''T''</sub> and any map of ''S''-schemes to the canonical map of character groups.  This functor is representable by a finite flat ''S''-group scheme, and Cartier duality forms an additive involutive antiequivalence from the category of finite flat commutative ''S''-group schemes to itself.  If ''G'' is a constant commutative group scheme, then its Cartier dual is the diagonalizable group ''D''(''G''), and vice versa.  If ''S'' is affine, then the duality functor is given by the duality of the Hopf algebras of functions.\n\n==Definition using Hopf algebras==\n\nA finite commutative group scheme over a field corresponds to a finite dimensional commutative cocommutative Hopf algebra. Cartier duality corresponds to taking the [[dual module|dual]] of the Hopf algebra, exchanging the multiplication and comultipication.\n\n==More general cases of Cartier duality==\n\nThe definition of Cartier dual extends usefully to much more general situations where the resulting functor on schemes is no longer represented as a group scheme.  Common cases include fppf sheaves of commutative groups over ''S'', and complexes thereof.  These more general geometric objects can be useful when one wants to work with categories that have good limit behavior.  There are cases of intermediate abstraction, such as commutative algebraic groups over a field, where Cartier duality gives an antiequivalence with commutative affine [[formal group]]s, so if ''G'' is the additive group '''G'''<sub>a</sub>, then its Cartier dual is the multiplicative formal group <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{G}}_m</math>, and if ''G'' is a torus, then its Cartier dual is étale and torsion-free.  For loop groups of tori, Cartier duality defines the tame symbol in local [[geometric class field theory]].  [[Laumon]] introduced a sheaf-theoretic Fourier transform for [[quasi-coherent module]]s over [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|1-motives]] that specializes to many of these equivalences.<ref>{{cite arXiv|first=Gerard|author=Laumon|title=Transformation de Fourier généralisee|arxiv=alg-geom/9603004|year=1996}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n*The Cartier dual of the cyclic group <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}</math> of order ''n'' is the ''n''-th roots of unity <math>\\mu_n</math>.\n*Over a field of characteristic ''p'' the group scheme α<sub>''p''</sub> (the kernel of the endomorphism of the additive group induced by taking ''p''th powers) is its own Cartier dual.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{citation|mr=0148665 \n|last=Cartier|first= P.\n|chapter=Groupes algébriques et groupes formels|title=1962 Colloq.

The first cohomology  H<sup>1</sup>(''L'', ''G'') = H<sup>1</sup>(Γ<sub>''L''</sub>, ''G'') is a set classifying the forms of ''G'' over ''L'', and is a functor of ''L''. \n\nA cohomological invariant of ''G'' of dimension ''d'' taking values in a Γ<sub>''K''</sub>-module ''M'' is a natural transformation of functors (of ''L'') from H<sup>1</sup>(L, ''G'') to H<sup>''d''</sup>(L, ''M'').\n\nIn other words a cohomological invariant associates an element of an abelian cohomology group to elements of a non-abelian cohomology set.\n\nMore generally, if ''A'' is any functor from finitely generated extensions of a field to sets, then a cohomological invariant of ''A'' of dimension ''d'' taking values in a Γ-module ''M'' is a natural transformation of functors (of ''L'') from ''A'' to H<sup>''d''</sup>(L, ''M'').\n\nThe cohomological invariants of a fixed group ''G'' or functor ''A'', dimension ''d'' and [[Galois module]] ''M'' form an [[abelian group]] denoted by Inv<sup>''d''</sup>(''G'',''M'') or Inv<sup>''d''</sup>(''A'',''M'').\n\n==Examples==\n\n*Suppose ''A'' is the functor taking a field to the isomorphism classes of dimension ''n'' [[etale algebra]]s over it. The cohomological invariants with coefficients in '''Z'''/2'''Z''' is a free module over the cohomology of ''k'' with a basis of elements of degrees 0, 1, 2, ..., ''m'' where ''m'' is the integer part of ''n''/2. \n*The [[Hasse−Witt invariant]] of a quadratic form is essentially a dimension 2 cohomological invariant of the corresponding spin group taking values in a group of order 2.\n*If ''G'' is a quotient of a group by a smooth finite central subgroup ''C'', then the boundary map of the corresponding exact sequence gives a dimension 2 cohomological invariant with values in ''C''.  If ''G'' is a special orthogonal group and the cover is the spin group then the corresponding invariant is essentially the [[Hasse−Witt invariant]].\n*If ''G'' is the orthogonal group of a quadratic form in characteristic not 2, then there are Stiefel–Whitney classes for each positive dimension which are cohomological invariants with values in '''Z'''/2'''Z'''. (These are not the topological [[Stiefel–Whitney class]]es of a real vector bundle, but are the analogues of them for vector bundles over a scheme.) For dimension 1 this is essentially the discriminant, and for dimension 2 it is essentially the [[Hasse−Witt invariant]]. \n*The [[Arason invariant]] ''e''<sub>3</sub> is a dimension 3 invariant of some even dimensional quadratic forms ''q'' with trivial discriminant and trivial Hasse−Witt invariant. It takes values in '''Z'''/2'''Z'''. It can be used to construct a dimension 3 cohomological invariant of the corresponding spin group as follows. If ''u'' is in H<sup>1</sup>(''K'', Spin(''q'')) and ''p'' is the quadratic form corresponding to the image of ''u'' in H<sup>1</sup>(''K'', O(''q'')), then ''e''<sub>3</sub>(''p''−''q'') is the value of the dimension 3 cohomological invariant on ''u''. \n*The [[Merkurjev−Suslin invariant]] is a dimension 3 invariant of a special linear group of a central simple algebra of rank ''n'' taking values in the tensor square of the group of ''n''th roots of unity. When ''n''=2 this is essentially the Arason invariant.\n*For absolutely simple simply connected groups ''G'', the [[Rost invariant]] is a dimension 3 invariant taking values in '''Q'''/'''Z'''(2) that in some sense generalizes the Arason invariant and the Merkurjev−Suslin invariant to more general groups.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|MR=1999383 |last= Garibaldi|first= Skip|last2= Merkurjev|first2= Alexander|last3= Serre|first3= Jean-Pierre|title= Cohomological invariants in Galois cohomology|series=University Lecture Series|volume= 28|publisher= American Mathematical Society|place= Providence, RI|year= 2003|isbn= 0-8218-3287-5 }}\n* {{citation | last1=Knus | first1=Max-Albert | last2=Merkurjev | first2=Alexander | author2-link=Alexander Merkurjev | last3=Rost | first3=Markus | author3-link=Markus Rost | last4=Tignol | first4=Jean-Pierre | title=The book of involutions | zbl=0955.16001 | series=Colloquium Publications | publisher=American Mathematical Society | volume=44 | location=Providence, RI | year=1998 | isbn=0-8218-0904-0 }}\n*{{citation|MR=1321649 \n|last=Serre|first= Jean-Pierre\n|title=Cohomologie galoisienne: progrès et problèmes\n|series=Séminaire Bourbaki, Vol. 1993/94.

A diagonalizable group defined over ''k'' is said to ''split over'' ''k'' or ''k''-''split'' if the isomorphism is defined over ''k''. This coincides with the usual notion of [[splitting lemma|split]] for an algebraic group. Every diagonalizable group splits over the [[separable closure]] ''k''<sub>s</sub> of ''k''. Any closed subgroup and image of diagonalizable groups are diagonalizable.

The fact plays a crucial role in the structure theory of solvable groups.\n\nA connected diagonalizable group is called an [[algebraic torus]] (which is not necessarily compact, in contrast to a [[complex torus]]).

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''Dieudonné module''' introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Dieudonné|first=Jean|authorlink=Jean Dieudonné|year1=1954|year2=1957b}},  is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the non-commutative '''Dieudonné ring''', which is generated over the ring of [[Witt vector]]s by two special  endomorphisms ''F'' and ''V'' called the [[Frobenius endomorphism|Frobenius]] and [[Verschiebung operator|Verschiebung]] operators. They are used for studying finite flat commutative group schemes.\n\nFinite flat commutative group schemes over a perfect [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' of positive characteristic ''p'' can be studied by transferring their geometric structure to a (semi-)linear-algebraic setting.  The basic object is the Dieudonné ring \n\n:<math>D=W(k)\\{F,V\\}/(FV-p)</math>, \n\nwhich is a quotient of the ring of noncommutative polynomials, with coefficients in [[Witt vectors]] of ''k''.  The endomorphisms ''F'' and ''V'' are the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators, and they may act nontrivially on the Witt vectors.  Dieudonné and [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]] constructed an [[antiequivalence of categories]] between finite commutative group schemes over ''k'' of order a power of ''p'' and modules over ''D'' with finite <math>W(k)</math>-length.  The Dieudonné module functor in one direction is given by homomorphisms into the abelian sheaf ''CW'' of Witt co-vectors.  This sheaf is more or less dual to the sheaf of Witt vectors (which is in fact representable by a group scheme), since it is constructed by  taking a direct limit of finite length Witt vectors under successive Verschiebung maps <math>V\\colon W_n \\to W_{n+1}</math>, and then completing.  Many properties of commutative group schemes can be seen by examining the corresponding Dieudonné modules, e.g., connected ''p''-group schemes correspond to ''D''-modules for which ''F'' is nilpotent, and étale group schemes correspond to modules for which ''F'' is an isomorphism.\n\nDieudonné theory exists in a somewhat more general setting than finite flat groups over a field.  [[Tadao Oda]]'s 1967 thesis gave a connection between Dieudonné modules and the first [[de Rham cohomology]] of abelian varieties, and at about the same time, [[Alexander Grothendieck]]  suggested that there should be a crystalline version of the theory that could be used to analyze ''p''-divisible groups.  Galois actions on the group schemes transfer through the equivalences of categories, and the associated deformation theory of Galois representations was used in [[Andrew Wiles]]'s work on the [[Shimura–Taniyama conjecture]].\n\n==Dieudonné rings==\nIf ''k'' is a field of characteristic ''p'', its ring of [[Witt vector]]s consists of sequences {{nowrap|(''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub>, ...)}} of elements of ''k'', and has an endomorphism ''σ'' induced by the Frobenius endomorphism of ''k'', so {{nowrap|1=(''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub>, ...)<sup>''σ''</sup> = (''w''{{su|b=1|p=''p''|lh=1}}, ''w''{{su|b=2|p=''p''|lh=1}}, ''w''{{su|b=3|p=''p''|lh=1}}, ...)}}. The '''Dieudonné ring''', often denoted by ''E''<sub>''k''</sub> or D<sub>''k''</sub>, is the non-commutative ring over ''W''(''k'') generated by 2 elements ''F'' and ''V'' subject to the relations\n:''FV'' = ''VF'' = ''p''\n:''Fw'' = ''w''<sup>''σ''</sup>''F''\n:''wV'' = ''Vw''<sup>''σ''</sup>.\n\nIt is a <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-graded ring, where the piece of  degree <math>{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}}</math> is a 1-dimensional free module over ''W''(''k''), spanned by ''V''<sup>&minus;''n''</sup> if {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 0}} and by ''F''<sup>''n''</sup> if {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 0}}.\n \nSome authors define the Dieudonné ring to be the completion of the ring above for the ideal generated by ''F'' and ''V''.\n\n==Dieudonné modules and groups==\n\nSpecial sorts of modules over the Dieudonné ring correspond to certain algebraic group schemes. For example, finite length modules over the Dieudonné ring form an abelian category equivalent to the opposite of the category of finite commutative ''p''-group schemes over ''k''.\n\n==Examples==\n\n* If <math>X</math> is the constant group scheme <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}</math> over <math>k</math>, then its corresponding Dieudonné module <math> \\mathbf{D}(X) </math> is <math>k</math> with <math> F = \\mathrm{Frob}_k</math> and <math> V = 0 </math>.\n* For the scheme of ''p''-th roots of unity <math>X = \\mu_p</math>, then its corresponding Dieudonné module is <math> \\mathbf{D}(X) = k</math> with <math> F = 0 </math> and <math> V = \\mathrm{Frob}_k^{-1}</math>.\n* For <math> X = \\alpha_p</math>, defined as the kernel of the Frobenius <math> \\mathbb{G}_{a} \\to \\mathbb{G}_{a}</math>, the Dieudonné module is <math> \\mathbf{D}(X) = k</math> with <math> F = V = 0 </math>.\n* If <math> X = E[p] </math> is the ''p''-torsion of an elliptic curve over ''k'' (with ''p''-torsion in ''k''), then the Dieudonné module depends on whether ''E'' is [[supersingular elliptic curve|supersingular]] or not.\n\n==Dieudonné–Manin classification theorem==\n\nThe Dieudonné–Manin classification theorem was proved by {{harvs|txt|last=Dieudonné | author-link=Jean Dieudonné|year=1955}} and {{harvs|txt|first=Yuri|last=Manin|authorlink=Yuri Manin| year=1963}}. It describes the structure of Dieudonné modules over an algebraically closed field ''k'' up to \"isogeny\". More precisely, it classifies the finitely generated modules over <math>D_k[1/p]</math>, where <math>D_k</math> is the Dieudonné ring. The category of such modules is semisimple, so every module is a direct sum of simple modules. The simple modules are the modules ''E''<sub>''s''/''r''</sub> where ''r'' and ''s'' are coprime integers with ''r''>0.  The module ''E''<sub>''s''/''r''</sub> has a basis over ''W''(''k'')[1/''p''] of the form ''v'', ''Fv'', ''F''<sup>2</sup>''v'',...,''F''<sup>''r''−1</sup>''v'' for some element ''v'', and {{nowrap|1=''F''<sup>''r''</sup>''v'' = ''p''<sup>''s''</sup>''v''}}. The rational number ''s''/''r'' is called the slope of the module.\n\n==The Dieudonné module of a group scheme==\n\nIf ''G'' is a commutative group scheme, its Dieudonné module ''D''(''G'') is defined to be Hom(''G'',''W''), defined as lim<sub>''n''</sub> Hom(''G'', ''W''<sub>''n''</sub>) where ''W'' is the formal Witt group scheme and \n''W''<sub>''n''</sub> is the truncated Witt group scheme of Witt vectors of length ''n''. \n\nThe Dieudonné module gives antiequivalences between various sorts of commutative group schemes and left modules over the Dieudonné ring ''D''.\n*Finite commutative group schemes of ''p''-power order correspond to ''D'' modules that have finite length over ''W''.\n*Unipotent affine commutative group schemes correspond to ''D'' modules that are ''V''-torsion.\n*''p''-divisible groups correspond to ''D''-modules that are finitely generated free ''W''-modules, at least over perfect fields.\n\n==Dieudonné crystal==\n\nA Dieudonné crystal is a [[crystal (mathematics)|crystal]] ''D'' together with homomorphisms ''F'':''D''<sup>''p''</sup>→''D''  and ''V'' :''D''→''D''<sup>''p''</sup> satisfying the relations ''VF''=''p'' (on ''D''<sup>''p''</sup>), ''FV''=''p'' (on ''D''). Dieudonné crystals were introduced by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1966}}. They play the same role for classifying algebraic groups over schemes that Dieudonné modules play for classifying algebraic groups over fields.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Cartier | first1=Pierre | authorlink=Pierre Cartier (mathematician) | title=Colloq.

They are used in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic topology]].\n\n==Definitions==\nA '''one-dimensional formal group law''' over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' is a power series\n''F''(''x'',''y'') with coefficients in ''R'', such that \n# ''F''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' + ''y'' + terms of higher degree\n# ''F''(''x'', ''F''(''y'',''z'')) = ''F''(''F''(''x'',''y''), ''z'')  (associativity).\nThe simplest example is the '''additive formal group law''' ''F''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x'' + ''y''.\nThe idea of the definition is that ''F'' should be something like the formal power series expansion of the product of a Lie group, where we choose coordinates so that the identity of the Lie group is the origin.\n\nMore generally, an ''' ''n''-dimensional formal group law''' is a collection of ''n'' power series\n''F''<sub>''i''</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) in 2''n'' variables, such that \n# '''F'''('''x''','''y''') = '''x''' + '''y''' + terms of higher degree\n# '''F'''('''x''', '''F'''('''y''','''z''')) = '''F'''('''F'''('''x''','''y'''), '''z''')\nwhere we write '''F''' for (''F''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>), '''x''' for (''x''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), and so on.\n\nThe formal group law is called '''commutative''' if '''F'''('''x''','''y''') = '''F'''('''y''','''x''').\n\n:'''Prop.'''{{fact|date=December 2018}} If ''R'' is <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-torsion free then any one-dimensional formal group law over ''R'' is commutative.\n\n:'''Proof.''' The torsion freeness gives us the exponential and logarithm which allows us to write ''F'' as ''F''(''x'',''y'') = exp(log(''x'') + log(''y'')).\n\nThere is no need for an axiom analogous to the existence of an inverse for groups, as this turns out to follow automatically from the definition of a formal group law. In other words we can always find a (unique) power series '''G''' such that '''F'''('''x''','''G'''('''x''')) = 0.\n\nA '''homomorphism'''  from a formal group law '''F''' of dimension ''m'' to a formal group law '''G''' of dimension ''n'' is a collection '''f''' of ''n'' power series in ''m'' variables, such that\n::'''G'''('''f'''('''x'''), '''f'''('''y''')) = '''f'''('''F'''('''x''', '''y''')).\nA homomorphism with an inverse is called an '''isomorphism''', and is called a '''strict isomorphism''' if in addition '''f'''('''x''')= '''x''' + terms of higher degree. Two formal group laws with an isomorphism between them are essentially the same; they differ only by a \"change of coordinates\".\n\n==Examples==\n*The '''additive formal group law''' is given by\n:: <math>F(x,y) = x + y.\\ </math>\n*The '''multiplicative formal group law''' is given by\n:: <math>F(x,y) = x + y + xy.\\ </math>\nThis rule can be understood as follows. The product ''G'' in the (multiplicative group of the) ring ''R'' is given by ''G''(''a'',''b'') = ''ab''. If we \"change coordinates\" to make 0 the identity by putting ''a'' = 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'', ''b'' = 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'', and ''G'' = 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F'', then we find that \n''F''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''xy''.\nOver the rational numbers, there is an isomorphism from the additive formal group law to the multiplicative one, given by {{nowrap|exp(''x'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1}}. Over general commutative rings ''R'' there is no such homomorphism as defining it requires non-integral rational numbers, and the additive and multiplicative formal groups are usually not isomorphic.\n\n*More generally, we can construct a formal group law of dimension ''n'' from any algebraic group or Lie group of dimension ''n'', by taking coordinates at the identity and writing down the formal power series expansion of the product map. The additive and multiplicative formal group laws are obtained in this way from the additive and multiplicative algebraic groups. Another important special case of this is the '''formal group (law) of an [[elliptic curve]]''' (or [[abelian variety]]).\n*''F''(''x'',''y'') = (''x'' + ''y'')/(1 + ''xy'') is a formal group law coming from the addition formula for the hyperbolic tangent function: tanh(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'') = ''F''(tanh(''x''), tanh(''y'')), and is also the formula for addition of velocities in [[special relativity]] (with the speed of light equal to 1).\n*<math>F(x,y) = \\left(x\\sqrt{1-y^4} +y\\sqrt{1-x^4}\\right)/(1+x^2y^2)</math> is a formal group law over '''Z'''[1/2] found by [[Euler]], in the form of the [https://scholar.rose-hulman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1148&context=rhumj addition formula] for an [[elliptic integral]] ({{harvtxt|Strickland}}):\n\n:: <math>\\int_0^x{dt\\over \\sqrt{1-t^4}} + \\int_0^y{dt\\over \\sqrt{1-t^4}} = \\int_0^{F(x,y)}{dt\\over \\sqrt{1-t^4}}.</math>\n\n==Lie algebras==\n\nAny ''n''-dimensional formal group law gives an ''n'' dimensional Lie algebra over the ring ''R'', defined in terms of the quadratic part ''F''<sub>2</sub> of the formal group law. \n:[''x'',''y''] = ''F''<sub>2</sub>(''x'',''y'') &minus; ''F''<sub>2</sub>(''y'',''x'')\nThe natural functor from Lie groups or algebraic groups to Lie algebras can be factorized into a functor from Lie groups to formal group laws, followed by taking the Lie algebra of the formal group:\n::Lie groups &rarr; Formal group laws &rarr; Lie algebras\n\nOver fields of characteristic 0, formal group laws are essentially the same as finite-dimensional Lie algebras: more precisely, the functor from finite-dimensional formal group laws to finite-dimensional Lie algebras is an equivalence of categories.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Over fields of non-zero characteristic, formal group laws are not equivalent to Lie algebras. In fact, in this case it is well known that passing from an algebraic group to its Lie algebra often throws away too much information, but passing instead to the formal group law often keeps enough information. So in some sense formal group laws are the \"right\" substitute for Lie algebras in characteristic ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.\n\n==The logarithm of a commutative formal group law==\n\nIf '''F''' is a commutative ''n''-dimensional formal group law over a commutative '''Q'''-algebra ''R'', then it is strictly isomorphic to the additive formal group law. In other words, there is a strict isomorphism '''f''' from the additive formal group to '''F''', called the '''logarithm''' of '''F''', so that \n::'''f'''('''F'''('''x''','''y''')) = '''f'''('''x''') + '''f'''('''y''')\n\nExamples:\n*The logarithm of ''F''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'' is ''f''(''x'') = ''x''.\n*The logarithm of ''F''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''xy'' is ''f''(''x'') = log(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''), because log(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''xy'') = log(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;log(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'').\n\nIf ''R'' does not contain the rationals, a map '''f''' can be constructed by extension of scalars to  ''R''⊗'''Q''', but this will send everything to zero if ''R'' has positive characteristic.  Formal group laws over a ring ''R'' are often constructed by writing down their logarithm as a power series with coefficients in ''R''⊗'''Q''', and then proving that the coefficients of the corresponding formal group over ''R''⊗'''Q''' actually lie in ''R''.  When working in positive characteristic, one typically replaces ''R'' with a mixed characteristic ring that has a surjection to ''R'', such as the ring ''W''(''R'') of [[Witt vectors]], and reduces to ''R'' at the end.\n\n==The formal group ring of a formal group law==\n\nThe formal group ring of a formal group law is a cocommutative Hopf algebra analogous to the [[group ring]] of a group and to the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra, both of which are also cocommutative Hopf algebras. In general cocommutative Hopf algebras behave very much like groups.\n\nFor simplicity we describe the 1-dimensional case; the higher-dimensional case is similar except that notation becomes messier.\n\nSuppose that ''F'' is a (1-dimensional) formal group law over ''R''. Its '''formal group ring''' (also called its '''hyperalgebra''' or its '''covariant bialgebra''') is a cocommutative [[Hopf algebra]] ''H'' constructed as follows.\n* As an ''R''-module, ''H'' is free with a basis 1 = ''D''<sup>(0)</sup>, ''D''<sup>(1)</sup>, ''D''<sup>(2)</sup>, ...\n*The coproduct Δ is given by Δ''D''<sup>(''n'')</sup> = ∑''D''<sup>(''i'')</sup>&nbsp;⊗&nbsp;''D''<sup>(''n''&minus;''i'')</sup> (so the dual of this coalgebra is just the ring of formal power series).\n*The counit ''η'' is given by the coefficient of ''D''<sup>(0)</sup>.\n*The identity is 1 = ''D''<sup>(0)</sup>.\n*The antipode ''S'' takes ''D''<sup>(''n'')</sup> to (&minus;1)<sup>''n''</sup>''D''<sup>(''n'')</sup>.\n*The coefficient of ''D''<sup>(1)</sup> in the product ''D''<sup>(i)</sup>''D''<sup>(''j'')</sup> is the coefficient of ''x''<sup>''i''</sup>''y''<sup>''j''</sup> in ''F''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'').\n\nConversely, given a Hopf algebra whose coalgebra structure is given above, we can recover a formal group law ''F'' from it. So 1-dimensional formal group laws are essentially the same as Hopf algebras whose coalgebra structure is given above.\n\n==Formal group laws as functors==\n\nGiven an ''n''-dimensional formal group law '''F''' over ''R'' and a commutative ''R''-algebra ''S'', we can form a group '''F'''(''S'') whose underlying set is ''N''<sup>''n''</sup> where ''N'' is the set of ''[[nilpotent]]'' elements of ''S''. The product is given by using '''F''' to multiply elements of ''N''<sup>''n''</sup>; the point is that all the formal power series now converge because they are being applied to nilpotent elements, so there are only a finite number of nonzero terms.\nThis makes '''F''' into a [[functor]] from commutative ''R''-algebras ''S'' to groups.\n\nWe can extend the definition of '''F'''(''S'') to some topological ''R''-algebras. In particular, if ''S'' is an inverse limit of discrete ''R'' algebras, we can define '''F'''(''S'') to be the inverse limit of the corresponding groups. For example, this allows us to define '''F'''('''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>) with values in the ''p''-adic numbers.\n\nThe group-valued functor of '''F''' can also be described using the formal group ring ''H'' of '''F'''. For simplicity we will assume that '''F''' is 1-dimensional; the general case is similar. For any cocommutative Hopf algebra, an element ''g'' is called '''group-like''' if Δg = g&nbsp;⊗&nbsp;g and εg = 1, and the group-like elements form a group under multiplication. In the case of the Hopf algebra of a formal group law over a ring, the group like elements are exactly those of the form \n:''D''<sup>(0)</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''D''<sup>(1)</sup>''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''D''<sup>(2)</sup>''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...\nfor ''nilpotent'' elements ''x''. In particular we can identify the group-like elements of ''H''⊗''S'' with the nilpotent elements of ''S'', and the group structure on the group-like elements of ''H''⊗''S'' is then identified with the group structure on '''F'''(''S'').\n\n==The height of a formal group law==\nSuppose that ''f'' is a homomorphism between one dimensional formal group laws over a field of characteristic ''p''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0. Then ''f'' is either zero, or the first nonzero term in its power series expansion is <math>ax^{p^h}</math> for some non-negative integer ''h'', called the '''height''' of the homomorphism ''f''. The height of the zero homomorphism is defined to be ∞.\n\nThe '''height''' of a one dimensional formal group law over a field of characteristic ''p''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 is defined to be the height of its ''multiplication by p'' map.\n\nTwo one dimensional formal group laws over an algebraically closed field of characteristic ''p''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 are isomorphic if and only if they have the same height, and the height can be any positive integer or ∞.\n\nExamples:\n*The additive formal group law ''F''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'' has height ∞, as its ''p''th power map is 0.\n*The multiplicative formal group law ''F''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''xy'' has height 1, as its ''p''th power map is (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'')<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 = ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>.\n*The formal group law of an elliptic curve has height either one or two, depending on whether the curve is ordinary or [[supersingular]].  Supersingularity can be detected by the vanishing of the Eisenstein series <math>E_{p-1}</math>.\n\n==Lazard ring==\n{{main|Lazard's universal ring}}\nThere is a universal commutative one-dimensional formal group law over a universal commutative ring defined as follows.  We let\n\n:''F''(''x'', ''y'')\n\nbe\n\n:''x'' + ''y'' + &Sigma;''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> ''x''<sup>''i''</sup>''y''<sup>''j''</sup>\n\nfor indeterminates\n\n:''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>,\n\nand we define the universal ring ''R'' to be the commutative ring generated by the elements ''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>, with the relations that are forced by the associativity and commutativity laws for formal group laws. More or less by definition, the ring ''R'' has the following universal property:\n:For any commutative ring ''S'', one-dimensional formal group laws over ''S'' correspond to ring homomorphisms from ''R'' to&nbsp;''S''.\n\nThe commutative ring ''R'' constructed above is known as '''Lazard's universal ring'''. At first sight it seems to be incredibly complicated: the relations between its generators are very messy. However Lazard proved that it has a very simple structure: it is just a polynomial ring (over the integers) on generators of degrees 2, 4, 6, ... (where ''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> has degree 2(''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)). [[Daniel Quillen]] proved that the coefficient ring of [[complex cobordism]] is naturally isomorphic as a graded ring to Lazard's universal ring, explaining the unusual grading.\n\n==Formal groups==\n\nA '''formal group''' is a [[group object]] in the category of [[formal scheme]]s.  \n* If <math> G </math> is a functor from [[Artin algebra]]s to groups which is left exact, then it is representable (G is the functor of points of a formal group. (left exactness of a functor is equivalent to commuting with finite projective limits).\n* If <math> G </math> is a [[group scheme]] then <math> \\widehat{G} </math>, the formal completion of G at the identity, has the structure of a formal group.\n*A smooth group scheme is isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{Spf}(R[[T_1,\\ldots,T_n]])</math>. Some people call a formal group scheme ''smooth'' if the converse holds.\n*''formal smoothness'' asserts the existence of lifts of deformations  and can apply to formal schemes that are larger than points. A smooth formal group scheme is a special case of a formal group scheme.\n*Given a smooth formal group, one can construct a formal group law and a field by choosing a uniformizing set of sections.\n*The (non-strict) isomorphisms between formal group laws induced by change of parameters make up the elements of the group of coordinate changes on the formal group.\n\nFormal groups and formal group laws can also be defined over arbitrary [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], rather than just over commutative rings or fields, and families can be classified by maps from the base to a parametrizing object.\n\nThe moduli space of formal group laws is a disjoint union of infinite-dimensional affine spaces, whose components are parametrized by dimension, and whose points are parametrized by admissible coefficients of the power series '''F'''.  The corresponding [[moduli stack]] of smooth formal groups is a quotient of this space by a canonical action of the infinite-dimensional groupoid of coordinate changes.\n\nOver an algebraically closed field, the substack of one dimensional formal groups is either a point (in characteristic zero) or an infinite chain of stacky points parametrizing heights. In characteristic zero, the closure of each point contains all points of greater height.  This difference gives formal groups a rich geometric theory in positive and mixed characteristic, with connections to the Steenrod algebra, ''p''-divisible groups, Dieudonné theory, and Galois representations.  For example, the Serre-Tate theorem implies that the deformations of a group scheme are strongly controlled by those of its formal group, especially in the case of [[supersingular abelian varieties]].  For [[supersingular elliptic curve]]s, this control is complete, and this is quite different from the characteristic zero situation where the formal group has no deformations.\n\nA formal group is sometimes defined as a [[cocommutative]] [[Hopf algebra]] (usually with some extra conditions added, such as being pointed or connected).<ref name=Und121>{{cite book | last=Underwood | first=Robert G. | title=An introduction to Hopf algebras | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-387-72765-3 | zbl=1234.16022 | page=121 }}</ref>  This is more or less dual to the notion above.  In the smooth case, choosing coordinates is equivalent to taking a distinguished basis of the formal group ring.\n\nSome authors use the term ''formal group'' to mean ''formal group law''.\n\n==Lubin–Tate formal group laws==\n\n{{main|Lubin–Tate formal group law}}\n\nWe let '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> be the ring of ''p''-adic integers. The '''Lubin–Tate formal group law''' is the unique (1-dimensional) formal group law ''F'' such that ''e''(''x'') = ''px''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''<sup>''p''</sup> is an endomorphism of ''F'', in other words\n:<math>e(F(x,y)) = F(e(x), e(y)).\\ </math>\nMore generally we can allow ''e'' to be any power series such that ''e''(''x'') = ''px''&nbsp;+&nbsp;higher-degree&nbsp;terms and ''e''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''p''.

      "text": "{{distinguish|Clarke's generalized Jacobian}}\n{{for|other generalizations of Jacobians|intermediate Jacobian}}\nIn algebraic geometry a '''generalized Jacobian''' is a commutative algebraic group associated to a curve with a divisor, generalizing the [[Jacobian variety]] of a complete curve. They were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Maxwell Rosenlicht|first=Maxwell|last= Rosenlicht|year=1954}}, and can be used to study [[ramified covering]]s of a curve, with abelian [[Galois group]]. Generalized Jacobians of a curve are extensions of the Jacobian of the curve by a commutative affine algebraic group, giving nontrivial examples of [[Chevalley's structure theorem]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nSuppose ''C'' is a complete nonsingular curve, ''m'' an effective divisor on ''C'', ''S'' is the support of ''m'', and ''P'' is a fixed base point on ''C'' not in ''S''. The generalized Jacobian ''J''<sub>''m''</sub> is a commutative algebraic group with a rational map ''f'' from ''C'' to ''J''<sub>''m''</sub> such that:\n*''f'' takes ''P'' to the identity of  ''J''<sub>''m''</sub>.\n*''f'' is regular outside ''S''.\n*''f''(''D'') = 0 whenever ''D'' is the divisor of a rational function ''g'' on ''C'' such that ''g''≡1 mod ''m''. \nMoreover ''J''<sub>''m''</sub> is the universal group with these properties, in the sense that any rational map from ''C'' to a group with the properties above factors uniquely through ''J''<sub>''m''</sub>. The group ''J''<sub>''m''</sub> does not depend on the choice of base point ''P'', though changing ''P'' changes that map ''f'' by a translation.\n\n==Structure of the generalized Jacobian==\n\nFor ''m''=0 the generalized Jacobian ''J''<sub>''m''</sub> is just the usual Jacobian ''J'', an abelian variety of dimension ''g'', the genus of ''C''.\n\nFor ''m'' a '''nonzero''' effective divisor the generalized Jacobian is an extension of ''J'' by a connected commutative affine algebraic group ''L''<sub>''m''</sub> of dimension deg(''m'')−1. So we have an exact sequence\n:0 → ''L''<sub>''m''</sub> → ''J''<sub>''m''</sub> → ''J'' → 0\n\nThe group ''L''<sub>''m''</sub> is a quotient\n:0 → ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> → Π''R''<sub>''i''</sub> → ''L''<sub>''m''</sub> → 0\nof a product of groups ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> by the multiplicative group ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> of the underlying field. The product runs over the points ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> in the support of ''m'', and the group ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> is the group of invertible elements of the local ring modulo those that are 1 mod ''m''.  The group ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> has dimension ''n''<sub>''i''</sub>, the number of times ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> occurs in ''m''. It is the product of the multiplicative  group ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> by a unipotent group of dimension ''n''<sub>''i''</sub>−1, which in characteristic 0 is isomorphic to a product of ''n''<sub>''i''</sub>−1 additive groups.\n\n==Complex generalized Jacobians==\n\nOver the complex numbers the analytic subgroup underlying the generalized Jacobian can be described as follows. (This does not always determine the algebraic structure as two non-isomorphic commutative algebraic groups may be isomorphic as analytic groups.) Suppose that ''C'' is a curve with an effective divisor ''m'' with support ''S''.   There is a natural map from the homology group ''H''<sub>1</sub>(''C''−''S'') to the dual Ω(−''m'')* of the complex vector space Ω(−''m'') (1-forms with poles on ''m'') induced by the integral of a 1-form over a 1-cycle. The analytic generalized Jacobian is then the quotient group Ω(−''m'')*/''H''<sub>1</sub>(''C''−''S'').\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|mr=0061422\n|last=Rosenlicht|first= Maxwell\n|title=Generalized Jacobian varieties. \n|journal=Ann. of Math. |series= 2|volume= 59|year=1954|pages= 505–530|jstor=1969715|doi=10.2307/1969715}}\n*{{citation|mr=0103191 \n|last=Serre|first= Jean-Pierre\n|title=Algebraic groups and class fields. \n|series= Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume= 117|publisher= Springer-Verlag|place= New York|year= 1988|isbn= 0-387-96648-X |origyear=1959}}\n\n[[Category:Algebraic groups]]\n[[Category:Algebraic curves]]"

It was developed by [[David Mumford]] in  1965, using ideas from the paper {{harv|Hilbert|1893}}  in  classical [[invariant theory]].\n\nGeometric invariant theory studies an [[Group action (mathematics)|action of a group]] ''G'' on an [[algebraic variety]] (or [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]])  ''X'' and  provides techniques for forming the 'quotient' of ''X'' by ''G'' as a scheme with reasonable properties. One motivation was to construct [[moduli space]]s in [[algebraic geometry]] as quotients of schemes parametrizing marked objects. In the 1970s and 1980s the theory developed \ninteractions with [[symplectic geometry]] and [[equivariant topology]], and was used to construct  moduli spaces of objects in [[differential geometry]], such as [[instanton]]s and [[monopole (mathematics)|monopoles]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Invariant theory}}\nInvariant theory is concerned with a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' on an [[algebraic variety]] (or a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]) ''X''. Classical invariant theory addresses the situation when ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''V'' is a [[vector space]] and ''G'' is either a finite group, or one of the [[classical Lie group]]s that acts linearly on ''V''. This action induces a linear action of ''G'' on the space of [[Ring of polynomial functions|polynomial functions]] ''R''(''V'') on ''V'' by the formula\n\n: <math> g\\cdot f(v)=f(g^{-1}v), \\quad g\\in G, v\\in V.</math>\n\nThe polynomial [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of the ''G''-action on ''V'' are those polynomial functions ''f'' on ''V'' which are fixed under the 'change of variables' due to the action of the group, so that ''g''·''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f'' for all ''g'' in ''G''. They form a commutative [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''R''(''V'')<sup>''G''</sup>, and this algebra is interpreted as the algebra of functions on the '[[GIT quotient|invariant theory quotient]]' ''V'' //''G'' because any one of these functions gives the same value for all points that are equivalent (that is, <math>f(v)=f(gv)</math> for all {{math|g}}). In the language of modern [[algebraic geometry]],\n\n: <math> V/\\!\\!/G=\\operatorname{Spec} A=\\operatorname{Spec} R(V)^G.</math>\n\nSeveral difficulties emerge from this description. The first one, successfully tackled by Hilbert in the case of a [[general linear group]], is to prove that the algebra ''A'' is finitely generated. This is necessary if one wanted the quotient to be an [[affine algebraic variety]]. Whether a similar fact holds for arbitrary groups ''G'' was the subject of [[Hilbert's fourteenth problem]], and [[Masayoshi Nagata|Nagata]] demonstrated that the answer was negative in general. On the other hand, in the course of development of [[representation theory]] in the first half of the twentieth century, a large class of groups for which the answer is positive was identified; these are called [[reductive group]]s and include all finite groups and all [[classical group]]s.\n\nThe finite generation of the algebra ''A'' is but the first step towards the complete description of ''A'', and progress in resolving this more delicate question was rather modest. The invariants had classically been described only in a restricted range of situations, and the complexity of this description beyond the first few cases held out little hope for full understanding of the algebras of invariants in general. Furthermore, it may happen that any polynomial invariant ''f'' takes the same value on a given pair of points ''u'' and ''v'' in ''V'', yet these points are in different [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of the ''G''-action. A simple example is provided by the multiplicative group '''C'''<sup>*</sup> of non-zero complex numbers that acts on an ''n''-dimensional complex vector space '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> by scalar multiplication. In this case, every polynomial invariant is a constant, but there are many different orbits of the action. The zero vector forms an orbit by itself, and the non-zero multiples of any non-zero vector form an orbit, so that non-zero orbits are parametrized by the points of the complex [[projective space]] '''CP'''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>. If this happens (different orbits having the same function values), one says that \"invariants do not separate the orbits\", and the algebra ''A'' reflects the topological [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] ''X'' /''G'' rather imperfectly. Indeed, the latter space, with the [[quotient topology]], is frequently non-separated (non-[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]). (This is the case in our example – the null orbit is not open because any neighborhood of the null vector contains points in all other orbits, so in the quotient topology any neighborhood of the null orbit contains all other orbits.) In 1893 Hilbert formulated and proved a criterion for determining those orbits which are not separated from the zero orbit by invariant polynomials. Rather remarkably, unlike his earlier work in invariant theory, which led to the rapid development of [[abstract algebra]], this result of Hilbert remained little known and little used for the next 70 years. Much of the development of invariant theory in the first half of the twentieth century concerned explicit computations with invariants, and at any rate, followed the logic of algebra rather than geometry.\n\n== Mumford's book ==\n\nGeometric invariant theory was founded and developed by Mumford in a monograph, first published in 1965, that applied ideas of nineteenth century invariant theory, including some  results of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], to modern algebraic geometry questions. (The book was greatly expanded in two later editions, with extra appendices by Fogarty and Mumford, and a chapter on symplectic quotients by Kirwan.) The book uses both [[scheme theory]] and  computational techniques available in examples. \n<!--- Incorporate below\nThe theory has been very influential, and the technical concept of ''stability'' used has been basic in much later research, for example on moduli spaces of [[vector bundle]]s.\n-->\nThe abstract setting used is that of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] on a scheme ''X''.\nThe simple-minded idea of an [[orbit space]]\n\n:''G''\\''X'',\n\ni.e. the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of ''X'' by the group action, runs into difficulties in algebraic geometry, for reasons that are explicable in abstract terms. There is in fact no general reason why [[equivalence relation]]s should interact well with the (rather rigid) [[regular function]]s (polynomial functions), which are at the heart of algebraic geometry. The functions on the orbit space ''G''\\''X'' that should be considered are those on ''X'' that are [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the action of ''G''. The direct approach can be made, by means of the [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of a variety (i.e. [[rational function]]s): take the [[G-invariant|''G''-invariant]] rational functions on it, as the function field of the [[quotient variety]]. Unfortunately this &mdash; the point of view of [[birational geometry]] &mdash; can only give a first approximation to the answer. As Mumford put it in the Preface to the book:\n\n:''The problem is, within the set of all models of the resulting birational class, there is one model whose [[geometric point]]s classify the set of orbits in some action, or the set of algebraic objects in some moduli problem''.\n\nIn Chapter 5 he isolates further the specific technical problem addressed, in a [[moduli problem]] of quite classical type &mdash; classify the big 'set' of all algebraic varieties subject only to being [[non-singular]] (and a requisite condition on [[polarization of an algebraic variety|polarization]]). The moduli are supposed to describe the parameter space. For example, for [[algebraic curve]]s it has been known from the time of [[Riemann]] that there should be [[connected space|connected component]]s of dimensions\n\n:0, 1, 3, 6, 9, …\n\naccording to the [[genus (curve)|genus]] ''g''&nbsp;=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …, and the moduli are functions on each component. In the [[coarse moduli problem]] Mumford considers the obstructions to be:\n\n*non-separated topology on the moduli space (i.e. not enough parameters in good standing)\n*infinitely many irreducible components (which isn't avoidable, but [[local finiteness]] may hold)\n*failure of components to be representable as schemes, although respectable topologically.\n\nIt is the third point that motivated the whole theory. As Mumford puts it, if the first two difficulties are resolved\n\n:[the third question] ''becomes essentially equivalent to the question of whether an orbit space of some [[locally closed]] subset of the [[Hilbert scheme|Hilbert]] or [[Chow scheme]]s by the [[projective group]] exists''.\n\nTo deal with this he introduced a notion (in fact three) of '''stability'''. This enabled him to open up the previously treacherous area &mdash; much had been written, in particular by [[Francesco Severi]], but the methods of the literature had limitations. The birational point of view can afford to be careless about subsets of [[codimension]] 1. To have a moduli space as a scheme is on one side a question about characterising schemes as [[representable functor]]s (as the [[Grothendieck]] school would see it); but geometrically it is more like a [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] question, as the stability criteria revealed. The restriction to non-singular varieties will not lead to a [[compact space]] in any sense as moduli space: varieties can degenerate to having singularities. On the other hand, the points that would correspond to highly singular varieties are definitely too 'bad' to include in the answer. The correct middle ground, of points stable enough to be admitted, was isolated by Mumford's work. The concept was not entirely new, since certain aspects of it were to be found in [[David Hilbert]]'s final ideas on invariant theory, before he moved on to other fields.\n\nThe book's Preface also enunciated the [[haboush's theorem|Mumford conjecture]], later proved by [[William Haboush]].\n<!-- Expand on this, but not just yet\nIn many contexts where both theories apply, geometric invariant theory quotients are equivalent to [[symplectic reduction]].\n-->\n\n==Stability== <!-- \"Stable point\" redirects here -->\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Stable point|Stable fixed point}} \nIf a reductive group ''G'' acts linearly on a vector space ''V'', then a non-zero point  of ''V'' is called\n*'''unstable''' if 0 is in the closure of its orbit,\n*'''semi-stable''' if 0 is not in the closure of its orbit,\n*'''stable''' if its orbit is closed, and its stabilizer is finite.\n\nThere are equivalent ways to state these (this criterion is known as the [[Hilbert–Mumford criterion]]):\n*A non-zero point ''x'' is unstable if and only if there is a 1-parameter subgroup of ''G'' all of whose weights with respect to ''x'' are positive.\n*A non-zero point ''x'' is unstable if and only if every invariant polynomial has the same value on 0 and ''x''.\n*A non-zero point ''x'' is semistable if and only if there is no 1-parameter subgroup of ''G'' all of whose weights with respect to ''x'' are positive.\n*A non-zero point ''x'' is semistable if and only if some invariant polynomial has different values on 0 and ''x''.\n*A non-zero point ''x'' is stable if and only if every 1-parameter subgroup of ''G'' has positive (and negative) weights with respect to ''x''.\n*A non-zero point ''x'' is stable if and only if for every ''y'' not in the orbit of ''x'' there is some invariant polynomial that has different values on ''y'' and ''x'', and the ring of invariant polynomials has transcendence degree  dim(''V'')&minus;dim(''G'').\n\nA point of the corresponding projective space of ''V'' is called unstable, semi-stable, or stable if it is the \nimage of a point in ''V'' with the same property.  \"Unstable\" is the opposite of \"semistable\" (not \"stable\"). The unstable points form a Zariski closed set of projective space, while the semistable and stable points both form Zariski open sets (possibly empty). These definitions are from {{harv|Mumford|1977}} and are not equivalent to the ones in the  first edition of Mumford's book.\n\nMany moduli spaces can be constructed as the quotients of the space of stable points of some subset of projective space by some group action. These spaces can often be compactified by adding certain equivalence classes of semistable points. Different stable orbits correspond to different points in the quotient, but two different semistable orbits may correspond to the same point in the quotient if their closures intersect. \n \nExample: {{harv|Deligne|Mumford|1969}}\nA '''[[stable curve]]''' is a reduced connected curve of genus ≥2 such that its only singularities are ordinary double points and every non-singular rational component meets the other components in at least 3 points. The moduli space of stable curves of genus ''g'' is the quotient of a subset of the [[Hilbert scheme]] of curves in '''P'''<sup>5''g''-6</sup> with Hilbert polynomial (6''n''&minus;1)(''g''&minus;1) by the group PGL<sub>5''g''&minus;5</sub>.\n\nExample:\nA vector bundle ''W'' over an [[algebraic curve]] (or over a [[Riemann surface]]) is a [[stable vector bundle]] \nif and only if\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle\\frac{\\deg(V)}{\\hbox{rank}(V)} < \\frac{\\deg(W)}{\\hbox{rank}(W)}</math>\n\nfor all proper non-zero subbundles ''V'' of ''W'' \nand is semistable if this condition holds with < replaced by ≤.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geometric complexity theory]]\n*[[Geometric quotient]]\n*[[Categorical quotient]]\n*[[Quantization commutes with reduction]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation | last1=Deligne | first1=Pierre | author1-link=Pierre Deligne | last2=Mumford | first2=David | author2-link=David Mumford | title=The irreducibility of the space of curves of given genus | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1969__36__75_0 |mr=0262240 | year=1969 | journal=[[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]] | issue=1 | pages=75–109 | doi=10.1007/BF02684599 | volume=36}}\n*{{citation|last=Hilbert|first=D.|title=Über die vollen Invariantensysteme|journal=Math.

[[Armand Borel]] showed that its [[cohomology ring]] is isomorphic to the quotient of the ring of polynomials by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the invariant homogeneous polynomials of positive degree. This ring had already been considered by [[Claude Chevalley]] in establishing the foundations of the cohomology of [[compact Lie group]]s and their [[homogeneous space]]s with [[André Weil]], [[Jean-Louis Koszul]] and [[Henri Cartan]]; the existence of such a basis was used by Chevalley to prove that the ring of invariants was itself a polynomial ring. A detailed account of Kostant polynomials was given by {{harvtxt|Bernstein|Gelfand|Gelfand|1973}} and independently {{harvtxt|Demazure|1973}} as a tool to understand the [[Schubert calculus]] of the flag manifold. The Kostant polynomials are related to the [[Schubert polynomial]]s defined combinatorially by {{harvtxt|Lascoux|Schützenberger|1982}} for the classical flag manifold, when ''G'' = SL(n,'''C''').

      "text": "In the mathematical theory of [[linear algebraic group|linear algebraic groups]], a '''[[Tits index]]''' (or '''index''') is an object used to classify semisimple [[algebraic group]]s defined over a base field ''k'', not assumed to be [[algebraically closed]]. The possible irreducible indices were classified by [[Jacques Tits]]<ref>{{harv|Tits|1966}}</ref>, and this classification is reproduced below. (Because every index is a direct sum of irreducible indices, classifying ''all'' indices amounts to classifying irreducible indices.)\n\n==Organization of the list==\nAn index can be represented as a [[Dynkin diagram]] with certain vertices drawn close to each other (the orbit of the vertices under the *-action of the Galois group of ''k'') and with certain sets of vertices circled (the orbits of the non-distinguished vertices under the *-action). This representation captures the full information of the index except when the underlying Dynkin diagram is D<sub>4</sub>, in which case one must distinguish between an action by the [[cyclic group]] ''C''<sub>3</sub> or the [[permutation group]] ''S''<sub>3</sub>.\n\nAlternatively, an index can be represented using the name of the underlying Dykin diagram together with additional superscripts and subscripts, to be explained momentarily. This representation, together with the labeled Dynkin diagram described in the previous paragraph,  captures the full information of the index.\n\nThe notation for an index is of the form <sup>''g''</sup>''X''{{su|p=''t''|b=''n'',''r''}}, where\n* ''X'' is the letter of the underlying Dynkin diagram (A, B, C, D, E, F, or G),\n* ''n'' is the number of vertices of the Dynkin diagram,\n* ''r'' is the '''relative rank''' of the corresponding algebraic group,\n* ''g'' is the order of the quotient of the absolute Galois group that acts [[Group action (mathematics)#Faithful|faithfully]] on the Dynkin diagram (so ''g'' = 1, 2, 3, or 6), and\n* ''t'' is either\n** the degree of a certain [[division algebra]] (that is, the square root of its dimension) arising in the construction of the algebraic group when the group is of classical type (A, B, C, or D), in which case ''t'' is written in parentheses, or\n** the dimension of the anisotropic kernel of the algebraic group when the group is of exceptional type (E, F, or G), in which case ''t'' is written without parentheses.\n\n==A<sub>''n''</sub>==\n===<sup>1</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>===\n'''Image''': [[File:tits_index_1An.svg]]\n\n'''Full name''': <sup>1</sup>A{{su|b=''n,r''|p=(''d'')}}\n\n'''Conditions''': ''d'' · (''r'' + 1) = ''n'' + 1, ''d'' ≥ 1.\n\n'''Algebraic group''': The [[special linear group]] SL<sub>''r''+1</sub>(''D'') where ''D'' is a [[central simple algebra | central division algebra]] over ''k''.\n\n'''Special fields''': Over a finite field, ''d'' = 1; over the reals, ''d'' = 1 or 2; over a ''p''-adic field or a number field, ''d'' is arbitrary.\n\n===<sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>===\n'''Image''': [[File:tits_index_2An.svg]]\n\n'''Full name''': <sup>2</sup>A{{su|b=''n,r''|p=(''d'')}}\n\n'''Conditions''': ''d'' | ''n'' + 1, ''d'' ≥ 1, 2''rd'' ≤ ''n'' + 1.\n\n'''Algebraic group''': The [[special unitary group]] SU<sub>(''n''+1)/''d''</sub>(''D'',''h''), where ''D'' is a central division algebra of degree ''d'' over a separable quadratic extension ''k' '' of ''k'', and where ''h'' is a nondegenerate [[hermitian form]] of [[Isotropic quadratic form|index]] ''r'' relative to the unique non-trivial ''k''-automorphism of ''k' ''.\n\n'''Special fields''': Over a finite field, ''d'' = 1 and ''r'' = ⌊(''n''+1)/2⌋; over the reals, ''d'' = 1; over a ''p''-adic field, ''d'' = 1 and ''n'' = 2''r'' − 1; over a number field, ''d'' and ''r'' are arbitrary.\n\n==B<sub>''n''</sub>==\n'''Image''': [[File:tits_index_Bn.svg]]\n\n'''Full name''': B<sub>''n,r''</sub>\n\n'''Conditions''': None.\n\n'''Algebraic group''': The [[special orthogonal group]] SO<sub>2''n''+1</sub>(''k'',''q''), where ''q'' is a quadratic form of [[Isotropic quadratic form|index]] ''r'', and defect 1 if ''k'' has characteristic 2.\n\n'''Special fields''':  Over a finite field, ''r'' = ''n''; over a ''p''-adic field, ''r'' = ''n'' or ''n'' − 1; over the reals or a number field, ''r'' is arbitrary.\n\n==C<sub>''n''</sub>==\n'''Image''': [[File:tits_index_Cn.svg]]\n\n'''Full name''': C{{su|b=''n,r''|p=(''d'')}}\n\n'''Conditions''': 2<sup>''n''</sup> | 2''n'', ''d'' ≥ 1; ''n'' = ''r'' if ''d'' = 1.\n\n'''Algebraic group''': The [[special unitary group]] SU<sub>2''n''/''d''</sub>(''D'',''h''), where ''D'' is a division algebra of degree ''d'' over ''k'' and ''h'' is a nondegenerate [[antihermitian]] form relative to a ''k''-linear involution σ of ''D'' (also called an \"involution of the first kind\") such that the [[fixed-point subring]] ''D''<sup>σ</sup> has dimension 1/2 ''d''(''d'' + 1); or equivalently, when ''d'' > 1 and char ''k'' ≠ 2, the group SU<sub>2''n''/''d''</sub> where ''D'' and ''h'' are as above except that ''h'' is hermitian and D<sub></sub> has dimension 1/2 ''d''(''d'' − 1).

      "text": "In [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Mumford–Tate group''' (or '''Hodge group''') ''MT''(''F'') constructed from a [[Hodge structure]] ''F'' is a certain [[algebraic group]] ''G''. When ''F'' is given by a [[rational representation]] of an [[algebraic torus]], the definition of ''G'' is as the [[Zariski closure]] of the image in the representation of the [[circle group]], over the [[rational numbers]].  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Mumford|last=Mumford|year=1966}} introduced Mumford–Tate groups over the complex numbers under the name of Hodge groups. {{harvtxt|Serre|1967}} introduced the ''p''-adic analogue of Mumford's construction for [[Hodge–Tate module]]s, using the work of {{harvs|txt|last=Tate|authorlink=John Tate|year=1967}} on [[p-divisible group]]s, and named them Mumford–Tate groups.\n\n==Formulation==\nThe algebraic torus ''T'' used to describe Hodge structures has a concrete matrix representation, as the 2&times;2 invertible matrices of the shape that is given by the action of ''a''+''bi'' on the basis {1,''i''} of the complex numbers '''C''' over '''R''':\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{bmatrix}.\n       </math>\n\nThe circle group inside this group of matrices is the [[unitary group]] ''U''(1).\n\nHodge structures arising in geometry, for example on the [[cohomology group]]s of [[Kähler manifold]]s, have a [[lattice (group theory)|lattice]] consisting of the integral cohomology classes. Not quite so much is needed for the definition of the Mumford&ndash;Tate group, but it does assume that the vector space ''V'' underlying the Hodge structure has a given rational structure, i.e. is given over the rational numbers ''Q''. For the purposes of the theory the complex vector space ''V''<sub>''C''</sub>, obtained by extending the scalars of ''V'' from ''Q'' to ''C'', is used.\n\nThe weight ''k'' of the Hodge structure describes the action of the diagonal matrices of ''T'', and ''V'' is supposed therefore to be homogeneous of weight ''k'', under that action. Under the action of the full group ''V''<sub>''C''</sub> breaks up into subspaces ''V''<sup>''pq''</sup>, complex conjugate in pairs under switching ''p'' and ''q''. Thinking of the matrix in terms of the complex number &lambda; it represents, ''V''<sup>''pq''</sup> has the action of &lambda; by the ''p''th power and of the complex conjugate of &lambda; by the ''q''th power. Here necessarily\n\n:''p'' + ''q'' = ''k''.\n\nIn more abstract terms, the torus ''T'' underlying the matrix group is the [[Weil restriction]] of the [[multiplicative group]] ''GL''(1), from the complex field to the real field, an algebraic torus whose character group consists of the two homomorphisms to ''GL''(1), interchanged by complex conjugation.\n\nOnce formulated in this fashion, the rational representation &rho; of ''T'' on ''V'' setting up the Hodge structure ''F'' determines the image &rho;(''U''(1)) in ''GL''(''V''<sub>''C''</sub>); and ''MT''(''F'') is by definition the smallest algebraic group defined over ''Q'' containing this image.<ref>http://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/seattle/voisin.pdf, pp. 7&ndash;9.</ref>\n\n==Mumford–Tate conjecture==\n\nThe original context for the formulation of the group in question was the question of the [[Galois representation]] on the [[Tate module]] of an [[abelian variety]] ''A''. Conjecturally, the image of such a Galois representation, which is an [[l-adic]] Lie group for a given prime number ''l'', is determined by the corresponding Mumford–Tate group ''G'' (coming from the Hodge structure on ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''A'')), to the extent that knowledge of ''G'' determines the [[Lie algebra]] of the Galois image. This conjecture is known only in particular cases.<ref>http://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/Articles/mg.pdf, survey by [[Ken Ribet]].</ref> Through generalisations of this conjecture, the Mumford–Tate group has been connected to the [[motivic Galois group]], and, for example, the general issue of extending the [[Sato&ndash;Tate conjecture]] (now a theorem).\n\n==Period conjecture==\n\nA related conjecture on abelian varieties states that the [[period matrix]] of ''A'' over number field has [[transcendence degree]], in the sense of the field generated by its entries, predicted by the dimension of its Mumford&ndash;Tate group, as in the previous section. Work of [[Pierre Deligne]] has shown that the dimension bounds the transcendence degree; so that the Mumford&ndash;Tate group catches sufficiently many algebraic relations between the periods. This is a special case of the full Grothendieck period conjecture.<ref>http://math.cts.nthu.edu.tw/Mathematics/preprints/prep2005-6-002.pdf, p. 3.</ref><ref>https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2569v1, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Mumford | first1=David | author1-link=David Mumford | title=Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups (Proc.

      "title": "Pseudo-reductive group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-reductive_group",
      "text": "In mathematics, a '''pseudo-reductive group''' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' (sometimes called a '''''k''-reductive group''') is a smooth connected [[affine algebraic group]] defined over ''k'' whose ''k''-unipotent radical (i.e., largest smooth connected unipotent normal ''k''-subgroup) is trivial. Over [[perfect field]]s these are the same as (connected) [[reductive group]]s, but over non-perfect fields [[Jacques Tits]] found some examples of pseudo-reductive groups that are not reductive. A pseudo-reductive ''k''-group need not be reductive (since the formation of the ''k''-unipotent radical does not generally commute with non-separable\nscalar extension on ''k'', such as scalar extension to an algebraic closure of ''k'').  Pseudo-reductive groups arise naturally in the study of algebraic groups over function fields of positive-dimensional varieties in positive characteristic (even over a perfect field of constants).\n\n{{harvtxt|Springer|1998}} gives an exposition of Tits' results on pseudo-reductive groups, while {{harvtxt|Conrad|Gabber|Prasad|2010}} builds on Tits' work to develop a general structure theory, including more advanced topics such as construction techniques, root systems and root groups and open cells, classification theorems, and applications to rational conjugacy theorems for smooth connected affine groups over arbitrary fields.  The general theory (with applications) as of 2010 is summarized in  {{harvtxt|Rémy|2011}}, and later work in the second edition {{harvtxt|Conrad|Gabber|Prasad|2015}} and in {{harvtxt|Conrad|Prasad|2016}} provides further refinements.\n\n==Examples of pseudo reductive groups that are not reductive==\n\nSuppose that ''k'' is a non-perfect field of characteristic 2, and ''a'' is an element of ''k'' that is not a square. Let ''G'' be the group of nonzero elements ''x'' + ''y''{{radic|''a''}} in ''k''[{{radic|''a''}}]. There is a morphism from ''G'' to the multiplicative group ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> taking ''x'' + ''y''{{radic|''a''}} to its norm ''x''<sup>2</sup> – ''ay''<sup>2</sup>, and the kernel is the subgroup of elements of norm 1. The underlying reduced scheme of the geometric kernel is isomorphic to the additive group ''G''<sub>''a''</sub> and is the unipotent radical of the geometric fiber of ''G'', but this reduced subgroup scheme of the geometric fiber is not defined over ''k'' (i.e., it does not arise from a closed subscheme of ''G'' over the ground field ''k'') and the ''k''-unipotent radical of ''G'' is trivial.  So ''G'' is a pseudo-reductive ''k''-group but is not a reductive ''k''-group.  A similar construction works using a primitive nontrivial purely inseparable finite extension of any imperfect field in any positive characteristic, the only difference being that the formula for the norm map is a bit more complicated than in the preceding quadratic examples.\n\nMore generally, if ''K'' is a non-trivial purely inseparable finite extension of ''k'' and ''G'' is any non-trivial connected reductive ''K''-group defined then the Weil restriction  ''H''=R<sub>''K''/''k''</sub>(''G'') is a smooth connected affine ''k''-group for which there is a (surjective) homomorphism from ''H<sub>K</sub>'' onto ''G''. The kernel of this ''K''-homomorphism descends the unipotent radical of the geometric fiber of ''H'' and is not defined over ''k'' (i.e., does not arise from a closed subgroup scheme of ''H''), so R<sub>''K''/''k''</sub>(''G'') is pseudo-reductive but not reductive. The previous example is the special case using the multiplicative group and the extension ''K''=''k''[{{radic|''a''}}].\n\n==Classification and exotic phenomena==\n\nOver fields of characteristic greater than 3, all pseudo-reductive groups can be obtained from reductive groups by the \"standard construction\", a generalization of the construction above.  The ''standard construction'' involves an auxiliary choice of a commutative pseudo-reductive group, which turns out to be a Cartan subgroup of the output of the construction, and the main complication for a general pseudo-reductive group is that the structure of Cartan subgroups (which are always commutative and pseudo-reductive) is mysterious. The commutative pseudo-reductive groups admit no useful classification (in contrast with the connected reductive case, for which they are tori and hence are accessible via Galois lattices), but modulo this one has a useful description of the situation away from characteristics 2 and 3 in terms of reductive groups over some finite (possibly inseparable) extensions of the ground field.\n\nOver imperfect fields of characteristics 2 and 3 there are some extra pseudo-reductive groups (called exotic) coming from the existence of exceptional isogenies between groups of types B and C in characteristic 2, between groups of type F₄ in characteristic 2, and between groups of type G₂ in characteristic 3, using a construction analogous to that of the [[Ree group]]s.  Moreover, in characteristic 2 there are additional possibilities arising not from exceptional isogenies but rather from the fact that for simply connected type C (I.e., symplectic groups) there are roots that are divisible (by 2) in the weight lattice; this gives rise to examples whose root system (over a separable closure of the ground field) is non-reduced; such examples exist with a split maximal torus and an irreducible non-reduced root system of any positive rank over every imperfect field of characteristic 2.  The classification in characteristic 3 is as complete as in larger characteristics, but in characteristic 2 the classification is most complete when ''[k:k^2]=2'' (due to complications caused by the examples with a non-reduced root system, as well as phenomena related to certain regular degenerate quadratic forms that can only exist when  ''[k:k^2]>2'').  Subsequent work of {{harvtxt|Conrad|Prasad|2016}}, building on additional material included in the second edition  {{harvtxt|Conrad|Gabber|Prasad|2015}}, completes the classification in characteristic 2 up to a controlled central extension by providing an exhaustive array of additional constructions that only exist when  ''[k:k^2]>2'' , ultimately resting on a notion of special orthogonal group attached to regular but degenerate and not fully defective quadratic spaces in characteristic 2.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last2=Gabber | first2=Ofer | last1=Conrad | first1=Brian | last3=Prasad | first3=Gopal | title=Pseudo-reductive groups | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=New Mathematical Monographs | isbn=978-0-521-19560-7 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511661143 |mr=2723571 | year=2010 | volume=17|edition=1}}\n*{{Citation | last2=Gabber | first2=Ofer | last1=Conrad | first1=Brian | last3=Prasad | first3=Gopal | title=Pseudo-reductive groups |  publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=New Mathematical Monographs | isbn=978-1-107-08723-1 | doi=10.1017/CBO9781316092439 |mr=3362817 | year=2015 | volume=26|edition=2}}\n*{{citation|mr=3379926  \n|last1=Conrad|first1= Brian|last2= Prasad|first2= Gopal\n|title=Classification of pseudo-reductive groups. \n|series=Annals of Mathematics Studies|volume= 191|publisher= Princeton University Press|place= Princeton, NJ|year= 2016|isbn= 978-0-691-16793-0|jstor=j.ctt18z4hnr|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10650.html}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Rémy | first1=Bertrand | title=Groupes algébriques pseudo-réductifs et applications (d'après J.

Then the exact sequence splits canonically as a direct sum so the étale cohomology group contains '''Q'''/'''Z''' canonically. The invariant ''a''(''P'') is the image of the element 1/[''K'':''k''] of '''Q'''/'''Z''' under the trace map from H{{su|b=et|p=3}}(''P''<sub>''K''</sub>,'''Q'''/'''Z'''(2)) to H{{su|b=et|p=3}}(''P'','''Q'''/'''Z'''(2)), which lies in the subgroup H<sup>3</sup>(''k'','''Q'''/'''Z'''(2)).\n\nThese invariants ''a''(''P'') are functorial in field extensions ''K'' of ''k''; in other words the fit together to form an element of the cyclic group Inv<sup>3</sup>(''G'','''Q'''/'''Z'''(2)) of cohomological invariants of the group ''G'', which consists of morphisms of the functor ''K''→H<sup>1</sup>(''K'',''G'') to the functor ''K''→H<sup>3</sup>(''K'','''Q'''/'''Z'''(2)).

Tamagawa numbers were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Tsuneo Tamagawa|last=Tamagawa|year=1966}}, and named after him by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|last=Weil|year=1959}}.\n\n[[Tsuneo Tamagawa]]'s observation was that, starting from an invariant [[differential form]] ω on {{math|''G''}}, defined over {{math|''k''}}, the measure involved was [[well-defined]]: while {{math|''ω''}} could be replaced by {{math|''cω''}} with {{math|''c''}} a non-zero element of <math>k</math>, the [[Global field#Analogies between the two classes of fields|product formula for valuations]] in {{math|''k''}} is reflected by the independence from {{math|''c''}} of the measure of the quotient, for the product measure constructed from {{math|''ω''}} on each effective factor. The computation of Tamagawa numbers for [[semisimple group]]s contains important parts of classical [[quadratic form]] theory.\n\n==Definition==\nLet {{math|''k''}} be a global field, {{math|''A''}} its ring of adeles, and {{math|''G''}} a semisimple algebraic group defined over {{math|''k''}}.\n\nChoose [[Haar measure]]s on the [[Completion (algebra)|completion]]s {{math|''k''<sub>''v''</sub> of ''k''}} such that {{math|''O''<sub>''v''</sub>}} has volume 1 for all but finitely many places {{math|''v''}}. These then induce a Haar measure on {{math|''A''}}, which we further assume is normalized so that  {{math|''A''/''k''}} has volume 1 with respect to the induced quotient measure.\n \nThe Tamagawa measure on the adelic algebraic group {{math|''G''(''A'')}} is now defined as follows. Take a left-invariant {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on {{math|''G''(''k'')}} defined over {{math|''k''}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the [[Dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] of {{math|''G''}}. This, together with the above choices of Haar measure on the {{math|''k''<sub>''v''</sub>}}, induces Haar measures on {{math|''G''(''k''<sub>''v''</sub>)}} for all places of {{math|''v''}}. As {{math|''G''}} is semisimple, the product of these measures yields a Haar measure on {{math|''G''(''A'')}}, called the ''Tamagawa measure''. The Tamagawa measure does not depend on the choice of ω, nor on the choice of measures on the {{math|''k''<sub>''v''</sub>}}, because multiplying {{math|''ω''}} by an element of {{math|''k''*}} multiplies the Haar measure on {{math|''G''(''A'')}} by 1, using the product formula for valuations.\n\nThe Tamagawa number {{math|''τ''(''G'')}} is defined to be the Tamagawa measure of {{math|''G''(''A'')/''G''(''k'')}}.\n\n==Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers==\n{{see also|Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers}}\n''Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers'' states that the [[Tamagawa number]] {{math|''τ''(''G'')}} of a simply connected (i.e. not having a proper ''algebraic'' covering) simple [[algebraic group]] defined over a number field is 1.  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|last=Weil|year=1959}} calculated the Tamagawa number in many cases of [[classical group]]s and observed that it is an integer in all considered cases and that it was equal to 1 in the cases when the group is simply connected. {{harvtxt|Ono|1963}} found examples where the Tamagawa numbers are not integers, but the conjecture about the Tamagawa number of simply connected groups was proven in general by several works culminating in a paper by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Kottwitz|last=Kottwitz|year=1988}} and for the analogue over [[algebraic function field|function field]]s over finite fields by [[Jacob Lurie|Lurie]] and [[Dennis Gaitsgory|Gaitsgory]] in 2011.{{sfn|Lurie|2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adelic algebraic group]]\n*[[Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Springer|id=T/t092060|title=Tamagawa number}}\n*{{citation|last= Kottwitz|first= Robert E. |title=Tamagawa numbers |journal=  Ann. of Math. |series=   2 |volume= 127  |year=1988|issue=  3|pages=629–646|doi=10.2307/2007007|jstor=2007007|publisher=Annals of Mathematics|mr= 0942522}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Ono | first1=Takashi | authorlink=Takashi Ono (mathematician) | title=On the Tamagawa number of algebraic tori | jstor=1970502 |mr=0156851 | year=1963 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=78 | pages=47–73 | doi=10.2307/1970502}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ono | first1=Takashi | title=On the relative theory of Tamagawa numbers | jstor=1970563 |mr=0177991 | year=1965 | journal=Annals of Mathematics |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=82 | pages=88–111 | doi=10.2307/1970563}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Tamagawa | first1=Tsuneo | title=Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Proc.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Tannakian category''' is a particular kind of [[monoidal category]] ''C'', equipped with some extra structure relative to a given [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''. The role of such categories ''C'' is to approximate, in some sense, the category of [[linear representation]]s of an [[algebraic group]] ''G'' defined over ''K''. A number of major applications of the theory have been made, or might be made in pursuit of some of the central conjectures of contemporary [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].\n\nThe name is taken from [[Tannaka–Krein duality]], a theory about [[compact group]]s ''G'' and their representation theory. The theory was developed first in the school of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. It was later reconsidered by [[Pierre Deligne]], and some simplifications made. The pattern of the theory is that of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], which is a theory about finite [[permutation representation (symmetric group)|permutation representation]]s of groups ''G'' which are [[profinite group]]s.\n\nThe gist of the theory, which is rather elaborate in detail in the exposition of Saavedra Rivano, is that the [[fiber functor]] Φ of the Galois theory is replaced by a '''tensor functor''' ''T'' from ''C'' to [[K-Vect]]. The group of [[natural transformation]]s of Φ to itself, which turns out to be a profinite group in the Galois theory, is replaced by the group (''a priori'' only a [[monoid]]) of [[natural transformation]]s of ''T'' into itself, that respect the tensor structure. This is by nature not an algebraic group, but an inverse limit of algebraic groups ([[pro-algebraic group]]).\n\n==Formal definition==\n\nA '''neutral Tannakian category''' is a rigid [[abelian category|abelian]] [[tensor category]], such that there exists a ''K''-tensor functor to the [[category of finite dimensional K-vector spaces]] that is [[exact functor|exact]] and [[faithful functor|faithful]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Deligne|Milne|1982}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe construction is used in cases where a [[Hodge structure]] or [[l-adic representation]] is to be considered in the light of group representation theory. For example, the [[Mumford–Tate group]] and [[motivic Galois group]] are potentially to be recovered from one [[cohomology group]] or [[Galois module]], by means of a mediating Tannakian category it generates.\n\nThose areas of application are closely connected to the theory of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motive]]s. Another place in which Tannakian categories have been used is in connection with the [[Grothendieck–Katz p-curvature conjecture]]; in other words, in bounding [[monodromy group]]s.\n\nThe [[Geometric Satake equivalence]] establishes an equivalence between representations of the [[Langlands dual]] group <math>{}^L G</math> of a [[reductive group]] ''G'' and certain equivariant [[perverse sheaf|perverse sheaves]] on the [[affine Grassmannian]] associated to ''G''. This equivalence provides a non-combinatorial construction of the Langlands dual group. It is proved by showing that the mentioned category of perverse sheaves is a Tannakian category and identifying its Tannaka dual group with <math>{}^L G</math>.\n\n==Extensions==\n{{harvtxt|Wedhorn|2004}} has established partial Tannaka duality results in the situation where the category is ''R''-linear, where ''R'' is no longer a field (as in classical Tannakian duality), but certain [[valuation ring]]s. {{harvtxt|Duong|Hai|2017}} showed a Tannaka duality result if ''R'' is a [[Dedekind ring]].\n\n{{harvtxt|Iwanari|2014}} has initiated the study of Tannaka duality in the context of [[infinity-categories]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Pierre Deligne, ''Catégories tannakiennes''.

In differential geometry, one considers an action of a real or complex torus on a manifold (or an [[orbifold]]).\n\nA [[normal scheme|normal]] algebraic variety with a torus acting on it in such a way that there is a dense orbit is called a [[toric variety]] (for example, orbit closures that are normal are toric varieties).\n\n== Linear action of a torus ==\nA [[group-scheme action|linear action]] of a torus can be simultaneously diagonalized, after extending the base field if necessary: if a torus ''T'' is acting on a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'', then there is a direct sum decomposition:\n:<math>V = \\bigoplus_{\\chi} V_{\\chi}</math>\nwhere\n*<math>\\chi: T \\to \\mathbb{G}_m</math> is a group homomorphism, a character of ''T''.\n*<math>V_{\\chi} = \\{ v \\in V | t \\cdot v = \\chi(t) v \\}</math>, ''T''-invariant subspace called the weight subspace of weight <math>\\chi</math>.\n\nThe decomposition exists because the linear action determines (and is determined by) a linear representation <math>\\pi: T \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V)</math> and then <math>\\pi(T)</math> consists of commuting [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable linear transformations]], upon extending the base field.\n\nIf ''V'' does not have finite dimension, the existence of such a decomposition is tricky but one easy case when decomposition is possible is when ''V'' is a union of finite-dimensional representations (<math>\\pi</math> is called [[rational representation|rational]]; see below for an example).

It turns out that for applications it is better, even for groups which have a natural lower-dimensional linear representation (such as the [[special linear group]]s <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb R)</math>), to always define the trace field using the adjoint representation.

Equivalently, ''M'' is unipotent if all its [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] are&nbsp;1.\n\nThe term '''quasi-unipotent''' means that some power is unipotent, for example for a [[diagonalizable matrix]] with [[eigenvalue]]s that are all [[roots of unity]].\n\nIn an '''unipotent affine algebraic group''', all elements are unipotent (see below for the definition of an element being unipotent in such a group).\n\n==Unipotent algebraic groups==\nAn element, ''x'', of an affine [[algebraic group]] is unipotent when its associated right translation operator, ''r''<sub>''x''</sub>, on the [[affine coordinate ring]] ''A''[''G''] of ''G'' is locally unipotent as an element of the ring of linear endomorphism of ''A''[''G'']. (Locally unipotent means that its restriction to any finite-dimensional stable subspace of ''A''[''G''] is unipotent in the usual ring sense.)\n\nAn affine algebraic group is called '''unipotent''' if all its elements are unipotent. Any unipotent algebraic group is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a closed subgroup of the group of upper triangular matrices with diagonal entries 1, and conversely any such subgroup is unipotent. In particular any unipotent group is a [[nilpotent group]], though the converse is not true (counterexample: the diagonal matrices of GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''k'')).\n\nIf a unipotent group acts on an affine variety, all its orbits are closed, and if it acts linearly on a finite-dimensional vector space then it has a non-zero fixed vector. In fact, the latter property characterizes unipotent groups.\n\nUnipotent groups over an algebraically closed field of any given dimension can in principle be classified, but in practice the complexity of the classification increases very rapidly with the dimension, so people{{Who|date=August 2010}} tend to give up somewhere around dimension 6.\n\nOver the real numbers (or more generally any field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0) the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] takes any nilpotent square matrix to a unipotent matrix. Moreover, if ''U'' is a commutative unipotent group, the exponential map induces an isomorphism from the Lie algebra of ''U'' to ''U'' itself.\n\n== Unipotent radical==\nThe '''unipotent radical''' of an [[algebraic group]] ''G'' is the set of unipotent elements in the [[radical of an algebraic group|radical]] of ''G''. It is a connected unipotent normal subgroup of ''G'', and contains all other such subgroups. A group is called reductive if its unipotent radical is trivial. If ''G'' is reductive then its radical is a torus.\n\n== Jordan decomposition ==\n{{Main|Jordan–Chevalley decomposition}}\nAny element ''g'' of a linear algebraic group over a [[perfect field]] can be written uniquely as the product ''g'' = ''g''<sub>''u''</sub>''g''<sub>''s''</sub> of commuting unipotent and [[Semi-simplicity|semisimple]] elements ''g''<sub>''u''</sub> and ''g''<sub>''s''</sub>. In the case of the group GL<sub>''n''</sub>('''C'''), this essentially says that any invertible complex matrix is conjugate to the product of a diagonal matrix and an upper triangular one, which is (more or less) the multiplicative version of the [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]].\n\nThere is also a version of the Jordan decomposition for groups: \nany commutative linear algebraic group over a [[perfect field]] is the product of a unipotent group and a semisimple group.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[unipotent representation]]\n*[[Deligne–Lusztig theory]]\n\n==References==\n*A.

Its dual is the group scheme of ''n''th roots of unity, whose Frobenius homomorphism is [''p''] and whose Verschiebung is the identity homomorphism.\n*For Witt vectors the Verschiebung takes (''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ...) to (0, ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>,  ...).\n*On the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions the Verschiebung ''V''<sub>''n''</sub> is the algebra endomorphism that takes the complete symmetric function ''h''<sub>''r''</sub> to ''h''<sub>''r''/''n''</sub> if ''n'' divides ''r'' and to 0 otherwise.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Dieudonne module]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Demazure | first1=Michel | author1-link=Michel Demazure | title=Lectures on p-divisible groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-06092-5 | doi=10.1007/BFb0060741 | mr=0344261 | year=1972 | volume=302}}\n* {{Citation | url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?IDDOC=504725 | last1=Witt | first1=Ernst | author1-link = Ernst Witt | title=Zyklische Körper und Algebren der Characteristik p vom Grad p<sup>n</sup>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Witt vector''' is an [[infinite sequence]] of elements of a [[commutative ring]]. [[Ernst Witt]] showed how to put a ring [[mathematical structure|structure]] on the set of Witt vectors, in such a way that the ring of Witt vectors over the finite field of order ''p'' is the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]].\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Ernst Eduard Kummer]] studied cyclic extensions of fields as part of his work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. This led to the subject now known as [[Kummer theory]]. Let ''k'' be a field containing a primitive ''n''th root of unity. Kummer theory classifies degree ''n'' cyclic field extensions ''K'' of ''k''. Such fields are in bijection with order ''n'' cyclic groups <math>\\Delta \\subseteq k^\\times / (k^\\times)^n</math>, where <math>\\Delta</math> corresponds to <math>K = k(\\sqrt[n]{\\Delta})</math>.\n\nBut suppose that ''k'' has characteristic ''p''. The problem of studying degree ''p'' extensions of ''k'', or more generally degree ''p<sup>n</sup>'' extensions, may appear superficially similar to Kummer theory. However, in this situation, ''k'' cannot contain a primitive ''p''th root of unity. If ''x'' is a ''p''th root of unity in ''k'', then it satisfies <math>x^p = 1</math>. Because raising to the ''p''th power is the [[Frobenius homomorphism]], this equation may be rewritten as <math>(x-1)^p = 0</math>, and therefore <math>x = 1</math>. Consequently Kummer theory is never applicable to extensions whose degree is divisible by the characteristic.\n\nThe case where the characteristic divides the degree is now called [[Artin–Schreier theory]] because the first progress was made by Artin and Schreier. Their initial motivation was the [[Artin–Schreier theorem]], which characterizes the [[real closed field]]s as those whose absolute Galois group has order two.<ref>Artin, Emil and Schreier, Otto, ''Über eine Kennzeichnung der reell abgeschlossenen Körper'', Abh. Math. Sem. Hamburg '''3''' (1924).</ref> This inspired them to ask what other fields had finite absolute Galois groups. In the midst of proving that no other such fields exist, they proved that degree ''p'' extensions of a field ''k'' of characteristic ''p'' were the same as splitting fields of ''Artin–Schreier polynomials''. These are by definition of the form <math>x^p - x - a</math>. By repeating their construction, they described degree ''p''<sup>2</sup> extensions. [[Abraham Adrian Albert]] used this idea to describe degree ''p<sup>n</sup>'' extensions. Each repetition entailed complicated algebraic conditions to ensure that the field extension was normal.<ref>A. A. Albert, ''Cyclic fields of degree'' ''p<sup>n</sup>'' over ''F'' of characteristic ''p'', Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. '''40''' (1934).</ref>\n\nSchmid<ref>Schmid, H. L., ''Zyklische algebraische Funktionenkörper vom Grad'' ''p<sup>n</sup>'' ''über endlichen Konstantenkörper der Charakteristik'' ''p'', Crelle '''175''' (1936).</ref> generalized further to non-commutative cyclic algebras of degree ''p<sup>n</sup>''. In the process of doing so, certain polynomials related to addition of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] appeared. Witt seized on these polynomials. By using them systematically, he was able to give simple and unified constructions of degree ''p<sup>n</sup>'' field extensions and cyclic algebras. Specifically, he introduced a ring now called ''W''<sub>''n''</sub>(k), the '''ring of ''n''-truncated ''p''-typical Witt vectors'''. This ring has ''k'' as a quotient, and it comes with an operator ''F'' which is called the Frobenius operator because it reduces to the Frobenius operator on ''k''. Witt observes that the degree ''p<sup>n</sup>'' analog of Artin–Schreier polynomials is\n\n:<math>F(x) - x - a,</math>\n\nwhere <math>a \\in W_n(k)</math>. To complete the analogy with Kummer theory, define <math>\\wp</math> to be the operator <math>x \\mapsto F(x) - x</math>. Then the degree ''p<sup>n</sup>'' extensions of ''k'' are in bijective correspondence with cyclic subgroups <math>\\Delta \\subseteq W_n(k) / \\wp(W_n(k))</math> of order ''p<sup>n</sup>'', where <math>\\Delta</math> corresponds to the field <math>k(\\wp^{-1}(\\Delta))</math>.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nAny <math>p</math>-adic integer (an element of <math>\\Z_p</math>, not to be confused with <math>\\Z /p\\Z =\\mathbb{F}_p</math>) can be written as a [[power series]] <math>a_0 + a_1 p^1 + a_2 p^2 + \\cdots</math>, where the <math>a_i\\!</math>'s are usually taken from the integer interval <math>[0,p{-}1]=\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, p{-}1\\}</math>. However, it is hard to provide an algebraic expression for addition and multiplication using this representation, as one faces the problem of carrying between digits. However, taking representative coefficients <math>a_i\\in [0,p{-}1]</math> is only one of many choices, and [[Oswald Teichmüller|Teichmüller]] suggested alternative coefficients <math>a_i\\in\\Z_p</math> such that expressions for addition and multiplication can be written in closed form. These coefficients <math>a_i</math> consist of 0 together with the <math>(p{-}1)^{\\text{th}}</math> [[root of unity|roots of unity]]; that is, the roots of <math>x^p - x = 0</math> in <math>\\Z_p,</math> so that <math>a_i=a_i^p.</math>\n\nThese '''Teichmüller representatives''' can be identified with the elements of the [[finite field]] <math>\\mathbb{F}_p</math> of order <math>p</math> (by taking residues modulo <math>p</math>), and elements of <math>\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times</math> are taken to their representatives by the [[Teichmüller character]] <math>\\omega:\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times \\to \\Z_p^\\times</math>. This identifies the set of <math>p</math>-adic integers with infinite sequences of elements of <math>\\omega(\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times) \\cup \\{0\\}.</math>\n\nWe now have the following problem: given two infinite sequences of elements of <math>\\omega(\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times) \\cup \\{0\\},</math> describe their sum and product as <math>p</math>-adic integers explicitly. This problem was solved by Witt using Witt vectors.\n\n===Detailed motivational sketch===\n\nWe derive the ring of <math>p</math>-adic integers <math>\\Z_p</math> from the finite field <math>\\mathbb{F}_p=\\Z /p\\Z</math> using a construction which naturally generalizes to the Witt vector construction.\n\nThe ring <math>\\Z_p</math> of <math>p</math>-adic integers can be understood as the [[projective limit]] of <math>\\Z /p^i\\Z.</math> Specifically, it consists of the sequences <math>(n_0,n_1,\\ldots)</math> with <math>n_i\\in\\Z /p^{i+1}\\Z,</math> such that <math>n_j\\equiv n_i \\bmod p^{i+1}</math> for <math>j\\ge i.</math> That is, each successive element of the sequence is equal to the previous elements modulo a lower power of ''p''; this is the [[inverse limit]] of the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]<nowiki/>s <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^{i+1}\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p^i\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\nThe elements of <math>\\Z_p</math> can be expanded as [[formal power series|(formal) power series]] in <math>p</math>\n\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 p^1 + a_2 p^2 + \\cdots,</math> \n\nwhere <math>a_i</math> are usually taken from the integer interval <math>[0,p{-}1]=\\{0, 1, \\ldots, p-1\\}.</math> Of course, this power series usually will not converge in <math>\\R</math> using the standard metric on the reals, but it will converge in <math>\\Z_p,</math> with the [[p-adic metric]]. We will sketch of a method of defining ring operations for such power series.\n\nLetting <math>a+b</math> be denoted by <math>c</math>, one might consider the following definition for addition:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nc_0 &\\equiv a_0+b_0 && \\bmod p \\\\\nc_0+c_1 p &\\equiv (a_0+b_0) + (a_1 +b_1)p && \\bmod p^2 \\\\\nc_0+c_1 p+c_2 p^2 &\\equiv (a_0+b_0) + (a_1 +b_1)p+(a_2+b_2) p^2 &&\\bmod p^3,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand one could make a similar definition for multiplication. However, this is not a closed formula, since the new coefficients are not in the allowed set <math>[0,p{-}1].</math>\n\nThere is an better coefficient subset of <math>\\Z_p</math>which does yield closed formulas, the Teichmuller representatives: zero together with the <math>(p{-}1)^{\\text{th}}</math>roots of unity. They can be explicitly calculated (in terms of the original coefficient representatives <math>[0,p{-}1]\\!\\!</math>)  as roots of <math>x^{p-1}-1=0</math> through [[Hensel lifting]], the p-adic version of [[Newton's method]]. For example, in <math>\\Z_5,</math> to calculate the representative of <math>2</math>, one starts by finding the unique solution of <math>x^4-1=0</math> in <math>\\Z/25\\Z</math> with <math>x\\equiv 2 \\bmod 5</math>; one gets <math>7</math>. Repeat this in <math>\\Z /125\\Z </math>, with the conditions <math>x^{4}-1=0</math> and <math>x\\equiv 7 \\bmod 25</math> gives <math>57,</math> and so on; the resulting Teichmüller representative is the sequence <math>(2,7,57,\\ldots).</math> The existence of a lift in each step is guaranteed by the greatest common divisor <math>(x^{p-1}-1,(p-1)x^{p-2})=1</math> in every <math>\\Z /p^n\\Z.</math>\n\nThis algorithm shows that for every <math>j\\in[0,p{-}1]</math>, there is exactly one Teichmuller representative with <math>a_{0}=j</math>, which we denote <math>\\omega(j).</math> Indeed, this defines the [[Teichmüller character]] <math>\\omega:\\mathbb{F}_p^*\\to \\Z_p^*</math>satisfying <math>m\\circ \\omega=\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{F}_p}</math> if we denote <math>m:\\Z_p\\to \\Z_p/p\\Z_p \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p.</math> Note that <math>\\omega</math> is ''not'' additive, as the sum need not be a representative. Despite this, if <math>\\omega(k)=\\omega(i)+\\omega(j)\\bmod p</math> in <math>\\Z_p,</math> then <math>i+j=k</math> in <math>\\mathbb{F}_p.</math> \n\nBecause of this one-to-one correspondence given by <math>\\omega</math>, one can expand every <math>p</math>-adic integer as a power series in <math>p</math> with coefficients taken from the Teichmüller representatives. An explicit algorithm can be given, as follows. Write the Teichmüller representative as <math>\\omega(t_0) = t_0 + t_1 p^1 + t_2 p^2 + \\cdots.</math> Then, if one has some arbitrary ''p''-adic integer of the form <math>x = x_0 + x_1 p^1 + x_2 p^2 + \\cdots,</math> one takes the difference <math>x-\\omega(x_0)=x'_1 p^1 + x'_2 p^2 + \\cdots,</math> leaving a value divisible by <math>p</math>. Hence, <math>x-\\omega(x_0) = 0 \\bmod p</math>. The process is then repeated, subtracting <math>\\omega(x'_1)p</math> and proceed likewise. This yields a sequence of congruences\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &\\equiv \\omega(x_0) && \\bmod p \\\\\nx &\\equiv \\omega(x_0) + \\omega(x'_1)p && \\bmod p^2 \\\\\n  &\\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSo that \n\n:<math>x \\equiv \\sum_{j = 0}^i \\omega(\\bar{x}_j)p^j \\bmod p^{i+1}</math>\n\nand <math>i' > i</math> implies: \n\n:<math>\\sum_{j = 0}^{i'} \\omega(\\bar{x}_j)p^j \\equiv \\sum_{j = 0}^i \\omega(\\bar{x}_j)p^j \\bmod p^{i+1}</math>\n\nfor \n\n:<math>\\bar{x}_{i} := m\\left(\\frac{x-\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\omega(\\bar{x}_j)p^j}{p^i}\\right).</math>\n\nHence we have a power series for each residue of ''x'' modulo powers of ''p'', but with coefficients in the Teichmüller representatives rather than <math>\\{0, \\ldots, p-1\\}</math>. It is clear that \n\n:<math>\\sum_{j = 0}^\\infty \\omega(\\bar{x}_j)p^j=x,</math>\n\nsince \n\n:<math>p^{i+1} \\mid x - \\sum_{j = 0}^i \\omega(\\bar{x}_j)p^j</math> \n\nfor all <math>i</math> as <math>i\\to\\infty,</math> so the difference tends to 0 with respect to the p-adic metric. The resulting coefficients will typically differ from the <math>a_i\\!\\!</math>'s modulo <math>p^i\\!\\!</math>, except the first one.\n\nThe Teichmuller coefficients have the key additional property that <math>\\omega(\\bar{x}_i)^p=\\omega(\\bar{x}_i),</math> which is missing for . This can be used to describe addition, as follows. Since the Teichmüller character is '''not''' additive, <math>c_0=a_0+b_0</math> is not true in <math>\\Z_p</math>. But it holds in <math>\\mathbb{F}_p,</math> as the first congruence implies. In particular, \n\n:<math>c_0^p\\equiv (a_0+b_0)^p  \\bmod p^2,</math>\n\nand thus\n\n:<math>c_0-a_0-b_0\\equiv (a_0+b_0)^p-a_0-b_0\\equiv \\binom{p}{1} a_0^{p-1}b_0+\\cdots+ \\binom{p}{p-1} a_0 b_0^{p-1} \\bmod p^2.</math>\n\nSince the [[binomial coefficient]] <math>\\binom{p}{i}</math> is divisible by <math>p</math>, this gives\n\n:<math>c_1\\equiv a_1+b_1- a_0^{p-1}b_0-\\frac{p-1}{2}a_0^{p-2}b_0^2-\\cdots- a_0 b_0^{p-1} \\bmod p.</math>\n\nThis completely determines <math>c_1</math> by the lift. Moreover, the congruence modulo <math>p</math> indicates that the calculation can actually be done in <math>\\mathbb{F}_p,</math> satisfying the basic aim of defining a simple additive structure.\n\nFor <math>c_2</math> this step is already very cumbersome. Write\n\n:<math>c_1=c_1^p \\equiv \\left(a_1+b_1- a_0^{p-1}b_0-\\frac{p-1}{2}a_0^{p-2}b_0^2-\\cdots - a_0 b_0^{p-1}\\right)^p \\bmod p.</math>\n\nJust as for <math>c_0,</math> a single <math>p</math>th power is not enough: one must take\n\n:<math>c_0=c_0^{p^2}\\equiv(a_0+b_0)^{p^2}.</math>\n\nHowever, <math>\\binom{p^2}{i}</math> is not in general divisible by <math>p^2,</math> but it is divisible when <math>i=pd,</math> in which case <math>a^ib^{p^2-i}=a^db^{p-d}</math> combined with similar monomials in <math>c_1^p</math> will make a multiple of <math>p^2</math>.\n\nAt this step, it becomes clear that one is actually working with addition of the form\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nc_0 &\\equiv a_0+b_0 && \\bmod p \\\\\nc_0^p+c_1 p &\\equiv a_0^p+a_1 p+b_0^p+b_1 p && \\bmod p^2 \\\\\nc_0^{p^2}+c_1^p p+c_2 p^2 &\\equiv a_0^{p^2}+a_1^p p+a_2 p^2+b_0^{p^2}+b_1^p p+b_2 p^2 && \\bmod p^3\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis motivates the definition of Witt vectors.\n\n==Construction of Witt rings==\nFix a [[prime number]] ''p''. A '''Witt vector''' over a commutative ring ''R'' is a sequence: <math>(X_0,X_1,X_2,\\ldots)</math> of elements of ''R''. Define the '''Witt polynomials''' <math>W_i</math> by \n#<math> W_0=X_0</math>\n#<math> W_1=X_0^p+pX_1</math>\n#<math> W_2=X_0^{p^2}+pX_1^p+p^2X_2</math>\nand in general\n:<math> W_n=\\sum_ip^iX_i^{p^{n-i}}.</math>\n\nThe <math>W_n</math> are called the '''ghost components''' of the Witt vector <math>(X_0,X_1,X_2,\\ldots)</math>, and are usually denoted by <math>X^{(n)}.</math>The ghost components can be thought of as an alternative coordinate system for the ''R''-module of sequences. \n\nThe '''ring of Witt vectors''' is defined by componentwise addition and multiplication of the ghost components. That is, that there is a unique way to make the set of Witt vectors over any commutative ring ''R'' into a ring such that:\n\n*the sum and product are given by polynomials with integral coefficients that do not depend on ''R'', and\n\n*projection to each ghost component is a ring homomorphism from the Witt vectors over ''R,'' to ''R''.\n\nIn other words, \n\n*<math>(X+Y)_i</math> and <math>(XY)_i</math> are given by polynomials with integral coefficients that do not depend on ''R'', and\n\n*<math> X^{(i)}+Y^{(i)}=(X+Y)^{(i)}</math> and <math> X^{(i)}Y^{(i)}=(XY)^{(i)}</math>.\n\nThe first few polynomials giving the sum and product of Witt vectors can be written down explicitly. For example, \n*<math>(X_0,X_1,\\ldots)+(Y_0,Y_1,\\ldots)=(X_0+Y_0, X_1+Y_1+(X_0^p+Y_0^p-(X_0+Y_0)^p)/p,\\ldots)</math>\n*<math>(X_0,X_1,\\ldots)\\times(Y_0,Y_1,\\ldots)=(X_0 Y_0, X_0^p Y_1+X_1 Y_0^p+p X_1 Y_1,\\ldots)</math>.\n\n==Examples==\n*The Witt ring of any commutative ring ''R'' in which ''p'' is invertible is just isomorphic to <math>R^\\N</math> (the product of a countable number of copies of ''R''). In fact the Witt polynomials always give a homomorphism from the ring of Witt vectors to <math>R^\\N</math>, and if ''p'' is invertible this homomorphism is an isomorphism.\n\n*The Witt ring of the [[finite field]] of order ''p'' is the ring of ''p''-adic integers written in terms of the Teichmuller representatives, as demonstrated above.\n\n*The Witt ring of a finite field of order ''p<sup>n</sup>'' is the [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|unramified extension]] of degree ''n'' of the ring of ''p''-adic integers.\n\n==Universal Witt vectors==\nThe Witt polynomials for different primes ''p'' are special cases of universal Witt polynomials, which can be used to form a universal Witt ring (not depending on a choice of prime ''p''). \nDefine the universal Witt polynomials ''W''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' ≥ 1 by \n#<math> W_1=X_1\\,</math>\n#<math> W_2=X_1^2+2X_2</math>\n#<math> W_3=X_1^3+3X_3</math>\n#<math> W_4=X_1^{4}+2X_2^2+4X_4</math>\nand in general\n:<math> W_n=\\sum_{d|n}dX_d^{n/d}.</math>\n\nAgain, <math>(W_1,W_2,W_3,\\ldots)</math> is called the vector of '''ghost components''' of the Witt vector <math>(X_1,X_2,X_3,\\ldots)</math>, and is usually denoted by <math> (X^{(1)},X^{(2)},X^{(3)},\\ldots)</math>.\n\nWe can use these polynomials to define the '''ring of universal Witt vectors''' over any commutative ring ''R'' in much the same way as above (so the universal Witt polynomials are all homomorphisms to the ring ''R'').\n\n==Generating Functions==\nWitt also provided another approach using generating functions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Serge |title=Algebra |publisher=Springer|edition = 3rd |date=September 19, 2005 |pages=330 |chapter=Chapter VI: Galois Theory |isbn=978-0-387-95385-4}}</ref>\n\n===Definition===\nLet <math>X</math> be a Witt vector and define\n\n:<math>f_X(t)=\\prod_{n\\ge 1}(1-X_n t^n)=\\sum_{n\\ge 0}A_n t^n</math>\n\nFor <math>n\\ge 1</math> let <math>\\mathcal{I}_n</math> denote the collection of subsets of <math>\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}</math> whose elements add up to <math>n</math>.

From the construction of truncated Witt vectors, it follows that their associated ring scheme <math>\\mathbb{W}_n</math> is the scheme <math>\\mathbb{A}_{\\Z}^n</math> with the unique ring structure such that the morphism <math>\\mathbb{W}_n\\to \\underline{\\mathcal{O}}^n</math> given by the Witt polynomials is a morphism of ring schemes.\n\n==Commutative unipotent algebraic groups==\n\nOver an [[algebraically closed field]] of characteristic 0, any [[unipotent]] abelian connected [[algebraic group]] is isomorphic to a product of copies of the additive group <math>G_a</math>. The analogue of this for fields of characteristic ''p'' is false: the truncated Witt schemes are counterexamples. (We make them into algebraic groups by forgetting the multiplication and just using the additive structure.) However, these are essentially the only counterexamples: over an algebraically closed field of characteristic ''p'', any [[unipotent]] abelian connected [[algebraic group]] is [[Isogeny#Abelian varieties up to isogeny|isogenous]] to a product of truncated Witt group schemes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Formal group]]\n*[[Artin–Hasse exponential]]\n*[[Necklace ring]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{springer|authorlink=Igor Dolgachev|first=Igor V. |last=Dolgachev|id=Witt_vector|title=Witt vector}}\n*{{citation|mr=2553661 |last=Hazewinkel|first= Michiel |chapter=Witt vectors.

This  paper was written during his stay in Paris in 1826 and presented to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] in October of the same year. This theory, later fully developed by others, was one of the crowning achievements of nineteenth century mathematics and has had a major impact on the development of modern mathematics. In more abstract and geometric language, it is contained in the concept of [[abelian variety]], or more precisely in the way an [[algebraic curve]] can be mapped into abelian varieties. The Abelian Integral was later connected to the prominent mathematician [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem|16th Problem]] and continues to be considered one of the foremost challenges to contemporary [[mathematical analysis]].\n\n== Modern view ==\n\nIn the theory of [[Riemann surfaces]], an abelian integral is a function related to the [[indefinite integral]] of a [[differential of the first kind]]. Suppose we are given a Riemann surface <math>S</math> and on it a [[Differential form|differential 1-form]] <math>\\omega</math> that is everywhere [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on <math>S</math>, and fix a point <math>P_0</math> on <math>S</math>, from which to integrate. We can regard\n\n:<math>\\int_{P_0}^P \\omega</math>\n\nas a [[multi-valued function]] <math>f\\left(P\\right)</math>, or (better) an honest function of the chosen path <math>C</math> drawn on <math>S</math> from <math>P_0</math> to <math>P</math>. Since <math>S</math> will in general be [[multiply connected]], one should specify <math>C</math>, but the value will in fact only depend on the [[homology class]] of <math>C</math>. \n\nIn the case of <math>S</math> a [[compact Riemann surface]] of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1, i.e. an [[elliptic curve]], such functions are the [[elliptic integral]]s. Logically speaking, therefore, an abelian integral should be a function such as <math>f</math>.\n\nSuch functions were first introduced to study [[hyperelliptic integral]]s, i.e., for the case where <math>S</math> is a [[hyperelliptic curve]]. This is a natural step in the theory of integration to the case of integrals involving [[algebraic function]]s <math>\\sqrt{A}</math>, where <math>A</math> is a [[polynomial]] of degree <math>>4</math>. The first major insights of the theory were given by Abel; it was later formulated in terms of the [[Jacobian variety]] <math>J\\left(S\\right)</math>. Choice of <math>P_0</math> gives rise to a standard [[holomorphic function]]\n\n:<math>S\\to J(S)</math>\n\nof [[complex manifold]]s.

The terminology here is from [[complex multiplication]] theory, which was developed for [[elliptic curve]]s in the nineteenth century. One of the major achievements in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] of the twentieth century was to find the correct formulations of the corresponding theory for abelian varieties of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] ''d'' > 1. The problem is at a deeper level of abstraction, because it is much harder to manipulate [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variable]]s.\n\nThe formal definition is that \n\n:<math> \\operatorname{End}_\\mathbb{Q}(A) </math>\n\nthe [[tensor product]] of End(''A'') with the [[rational number]] field '''Q''', should contain a commutative subring of [[vector space dimension|dimension]] 2''d'' over '''Q'''. When ''d'' = 1 this can only be a [[quadratic field]], and one recovers the cases where End(''A'') is an [[order (ring theory)|order]] in an [[imaginary quadratic field]]. For ''d'' > 1 there are comparable cases for [[CM-field]]s, the complex [[quadratic extension]]s of [[totally real field]]s. There are other cases that reflect that ''A'' may not be a [[simple abelian variety]] (it might be a [[cartesian product]] of elliptic curves, for example). Another name for abelian varieties of CM-type is abelian varieties with '''sufficiently many complex multiplications'''.\n\nIt is known that if ''K'' is the complex numbers, then any such ''A'' has a [[field of definition]] which is in fact a [[number field]]. The possible types of endomorphism ring have been classified, as rings with [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (the [[Rosati involution]]), leading to a classification of CM-type abelian varieties. To construct such varieties in the same style as for elliptic curves, starting with a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] Λ in '''C'''<sup>''d''</sup>, one must take into account the [[Riemann relations]] of abelian variety theory.\n\nThe '''CM-type''' is a description of the action of a (maximal) commutative subring ''L'' of End<sub>'''Q'''</sub>(''A'') on the holomorphic [[tangent space]] of ''A'' at the [[identity element]]. [[Spectral theory]] of a simple kind applies, to show that ''L'' acts via a basis of [[eigenvector]]s; in other words ''L'' has an action that is via [[diagonal matrices]] on the holomorphic vector fields on ''A''. In the simple case, where ''L'' is itself a number field rather than a product of some number of fields, the CM-type is then a list of [[complex embedding]]s of ''L''. There are 2''d'' of those, occurring in [[complex conjugate]] pairs; the CM-type is a choice of one out of each pair. It is known that all such possible CM-types can be realised.\n\nBasic results of [[Goro Shimura]] and [[Yutaka Taniyama]] compute the [[Hasse–Weil L-function]] of ''A'', in terms of the CM-type and a Hecke L-function with [[Hecke character]], having [[infinity-type]] derived from it. These generalise the results of [[Max Deuring]] for the elliptic curve case.\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation | last=Lang | first=Serge | title=Complex Multiplication | year=1983 | publisher=Springer Verlag | isbn=0-387-90786-6 }}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abelian Variety Of Cm-Type}}\n[[Category:Abelian varieties]]\n[[Category:Number theory]]"

In other words, there is a morphism from the variety ''V'' to its Albanese variety ''A''(''V''), such that any morphism from ''V'' to an abelian variety (taking the given point to the identity) factors uniquely through ''A''(''V''). For complex manifolds {{harvtxt|Blanchard|1956}} defined the Albanese variety in a similar way, as a morphism from ''V'' to a torus ''A''(''V'') such that any morphism to a torus factors uniquely through this map.

In terms of [[differential form]]s, any holomorphic 1-form on ''V'' is a [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of translation-invariant 1-form on the Albanese, coming from the holomorphic [[cotangent space]] of Alb(''V'') at its identity element.

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''arithmetic of abelian varieties''' is the study of the [[number theory]] of an [[abelian variety]], or a family of abelian varieites. It goes back to the studies of [[Pierre de Fermat]] on what are now recognized as [[elliptic curve]]s; and has become a very substantial area of [[arithmetic geometry]] both in terms of results and conjectures. Most of these can be posed for an abelian variety ''A'' over a [[number field]] ''K''; or more generally (for [[global field]]s or more general finitely-generated rings or fields).\n\n==Integer points on abelian varieties==\nThere is some tension here between concepts: ''integer point'' belongs in a sense to [[affine geometry]], while ''abelian variety'' is inherently defined in [[projective geometry]]. The basic results proving that [[elliptic curve]]s have finitely many integer points come out of [[diophantine approximation]].\n\n==Rational points on abelian varieties==\nThe basic result, the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] in [[Diophantine geometry]], says that ''A''(''K''), the group of points on ''A'' over ''K'', is a [[finitely-generated abelian group]]. A great deal of information about its possible [[torsion subgroup]]s is known, at least when ''A'' is an elliptic curve. The question of the ''rank'' is thought to be bound up with [[L-function]]s (see below).\n\nThe [[torsor]] theory here leads to the [[Selmer group]] and [[Tate–Shafarevich group]], the latter (conjecturally finite) being difficult to study.\n\n==Heights==\nThe theory of [[height function|heights]] plays a prominent role in the arithmetic of abelian varieties. For instance, the canonical [[Néron–Tate height]] is a [[quadratic form]] with remarkable properties that appear in the statement of the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]].\n\n==Reduction mod ''p''==\nReduction of an abelian variety ''A'' modulo a [[prime ideal]] of (the integers of) ''K'' &mdash; say, a prime number ''p'' &mdash; to get an abelian variety ''A<sub>p</sub>'' over a [[finite field]], is possible for [[almost all]] ''p''. The 'bad' primes, for which the reduction [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerates]] by acquiring [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singular points]], are known to reveal very interesting information. As often happens in number theory, the 'bad' primes play a rather active role in the theory.\n\nHere a refined theory of (in effect) a [[right adjoint]] to reduction mod ''p'' &mdash; the [[Néron model]] &mdash; cannot always be avoided. In the case of an elliptic curve there is an algorithm of [[John Tate]] describing it.\n\n==L-functions==\nFor abelian varieties such as  A<sub>''p''</sub>, there is a definition of [[local zeta-function]] available. To get an L-function for A itself, one takes a suitable [[Euler product]] of such local functions; to understand the finite number of factors for the 'bad' primes one has to refer to the [[Tate module]] of A, which is (dual to) the [[étale cohomology]] group H<sup>1</sup>(A), and the [[Galois group]] action on it. In this way one gets a respectable definition of [[Hasse–Weil L-function]] for A. In general its properties, such as [[functional equation]], are still conjectural – the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] (which was proven in 2001) was just a special case, so that's hardly surprising.\n\nIt is in terms of this L-function that the [[conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer]] is posed. It is just one particularly interesting aspect of the general theory about values of L-functions L(''s'') at integer values of ''s'', and there is much empirical evidence supporting it.\n\n==Complex multiplication==\nSince the time of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (who knew of the ''lemniscate function'' case) the special role has been known of those abelian varieties <math>A</math> with extra automorphisms, and more generally endomorphisms. In terms of the ring <math>{\\rm End}(A)</math>, there is a definition of [[abelian variety of CM-type]] that singles out the richest class. These are special in their arithmetic. This is seen in their L-functions in rather favourable terms – the [[harmonic analysis]] required is all of the [[Pontryagin duality]] type, rather than needing more general [[automorphic representation]]s. That reflects a good understanding of their Tate modules as [[Galois module]]s. It also makes them ''harder'' to deal with in terms of the conjectural [[algebraic geometry]] ([[Hodge conjecture]] and [[Tate conjecture]]). In those problems the special situation is more demanding than the general.\n\nIn the case of elliptic curves, the [[Hilbert's twelfth problem|Kronecker Jugendtraum]] was the programme [[Leopold Kronecker]] proposed, to use elliptic curves of CM-type to do [[class field theory]] explicitly for [[imaginary quadratic field]]s – in the way that [[root of unity|roots of unity]] allow one to do this for the field of rational numbers. This generalises, but in some sense with loss of explicit information (as is typical of [[several complex variables]]).\n\n==Manin–Mumford conjecture==\nThe Manin–Mumford conjecture of [[Yuri Manin]] and [[David Mumford]], proved by [[Michel Raynaud]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | first=Michel | last=Raynaud | authorlink=Michel Raynaud | chapter=Sous-variétés d'une variété abélienne et points de torsion | language=French | editor1-last=Artin | editor1-first=Michael | editor1-link=Michael Artin | editor2-last=Tate | editor2-first=John | editor2-link=John Tate | title=Arithmetic and geometry.

But when the base field is a number field, complex multiplication is the exception. It is known that, in a general sense, the case of complex multiplication is the hardest to resolve for the [[Hodge conjecture]].\n\n==Kronecker and abelian extensions==\n\n[[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] first postulated that the values of [[elliptic function]]s at torsion points should be enough to generate all [[abelian extension]]s for imaginary quadratic fields, an idea that went back to [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] in some cases, and even to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. This became known as the ''[[Kronecker Jugendtraum]]''; and was certainly what had prompted Hilbert's remark above, since it makes explicit [[class field theory]] in the way the [[roots of unity]] do for abelian extensions of the [[rational number|rational number field]], via [[Shimura's reciprocity law]].\n\nIndeed, let ''K'' be an imaginary quadratic field with class field ''H''.  Let ''E'' be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the integers of ''K'', defined over ''H''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''dual abelian variety''' can be defined from an [[abelian variety]] ''A'', defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''.\n\n==Definition==\nTo an abelian variety ''A'' over a field ''k'', one associates a '''dual abelian variety''' ''A''<sup>v</sup> (over the same field), which is the solution to the following [[moduli problem]]. A family of degree 0 line bundles parametrized by a ''k''-variety ''T'' is defined to be a line bundle ''L'' on \n''A''×''T'' such that \n# for all <math>t \\in T</math>, the restriction of ''L'' to ''A''×{''t''} is a degree 0 line bundle, \n# the restriction of ''L'' to {0}×''T'' is a trivial line bundle (here 0 is the identity of ''A'').\n\nThen there is a variety ''A''<sup>v</sup> and a family of degree 0 line bundles ''P'',{{clarify|Bundles on what?|date=July 2014}} the Poincaré bundle, parametrized by ''A''<sup>v</sup> such that a family ''L'' on ''T'' is associated a unique morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''A''<sup>v</sup> so that ''L'' is isomorphic to the pullback of ''P'' along the morphism 1<sub>A</sub>×''f'': ''A''×''T'' → ''A''×''A''<sup>v</sup>. Applying this to the case when ''T'' is a point, we see that the points of ''A''<sup>v</sup> correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on ''A'', so there is a natural group operation on ''A''<sup>v</sup> given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.\n\nIn the language of [[representable functor]]s one can state the above result as follows. The contravariant functor, which associates to each ''k''-variety ''T'' the set of families of degree 0 line bundles on ''T'' and to each ''k''-morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''T''' the mapping induced by the pullback with ''f'', is representable. The universal element representing this functor is the pair (''A''<sup>v</sup>, ''P'').\n\nThis association is a duality in the sense that there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between the double dual ''A''<sup>vv</sup> and ''A'' (defined via the Poincaré bundle) and that it is [[contravariant functor]]ial, i.e. it associates to all morphisms ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' dual morphisms ''f''<sup>v</sup>: ''B''<sup>v</sup> → ''A''<sup>v</sup> in a compatible way. The ''n''-torsion of an abelian variety and the ''n''-torsion of its dual are [[Pontryagin dual|dual]] to each other when ''n'' is coprime to the characteristic of the base. In general - for all ''n'' - the ''n''-torsion [[group scheme]]s of dual abelian varieties are [[Cartier dual]]s of each other. This generalizes the [[Weil pairing]] for elliptic curves.\n\n==History==\nThe theory was first put into a good form when ''K'' was the field of [[complex number]]s. In that case there is a general form of duality between the [[Albanese variety]] of a [[complete variety]] ''V'', and its [[Picard variety]]; this was realised, for definitions in terms of [[complex tori]], as soon as [[André Weil]] had given a general definition of Albanese variety. For an abelian variety ''A'', the Albanese variety is ''A'' itself, so the dual should be ''Pic''<sup>0</sup>(''A''), the [[connected space|connected component]] of what in contemporary terminology is the [[Picard scheme]].\n\nFor the case of the [[Jacobian variety]] ''J'' of a [[compact Riemann surface]] ''C'', the choice of a [[principal polarization]] of ''J'' gives rise to an identification of ''J'' with its own Picard variety. This in a sense is just a consequence of [[Abel–Jacobi map|Abel's theorem]]. For general abelian varieties, still over the complex numbers, ''A'' is in the same [[isogeny]] class as its dual. An explicit isogeny can be constructed by use of an [[invertible sheaf]] ''L'' on ''A'' (i.e. in this case a [[holomorphic line bundle]]), when the subgroup\n\n:''K''(''L'')\n\nof translations on ''L'' that take ''L'' into an isomorphic copy is itself finite. In that case, the quotient\n\n:''A''/''K''(''L'')\n\nis isomorphic to the dual abelian variety ''Â''.\n\nThis construction of ''Â'' extends to any field ''K'' of [[characteristic zero]].<ref>Mumford, ''Abelian Varieties'', pp.74-80</ref> In terms of this definition, the '''Poincaré bundle''', a universal line bundle can be defined on\n\n:''A'' &times; ''Â''.\n\nThe construction when ''K'' has characteristic ''p'' uses [[scheme theory]]. The definition of ''K''(''L'') has to be in terms of a [[group scheme]] that is a scheme-theoretic [[Group action (mathematics)|stabilizer]], and the quotient taken is now a quotient by a subgroup scheme.<ref>Mumford, ''Abelian Varieties'', p.123 onwards</ref>\n\n==Dual isogeny (elliptic curve case)==\nGiven an [[isogeny]]\n\n:<math> f : E \\rightarrow E' </math>\n\nof [[elliptic curve]]s of degree <math>n</math>, the '''dual isogeny''' is an isogeny\n\n:<math>\\hat{f} : E' \\rightarrow E</math>\n\nof the same degree such that\n\n:<math>f \\circ \\hat{f} = [n].</math>\n\nHere <math>[n]</math> denotes the multiplication-by-<math>n</math> isogeny  <math>e\\mapsto ne</math> which has degree <math>n^2.</math>\n\n== Construction of the dual isogeny ==\nOften only the existence of a dual isogeny is needed, but it can be explicitly given as the composition\n\n:<math> E'\\rightarrow \\mbox{Div}^0(E')\\to\\mbox{Div}^0(E)\\rightarrow E\\,</math>\n\nwhere  <math>{\\mathrm{Div}}^0</math> is the group of [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisors]] of degree 0.

It was introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Barry |last=Mazur|authorlink=Barry Mazur|year= 1977}}, in studying the rational points of modular curves. An '''Eisenstein prime''' is a prime in the support of the Eisenstein ideal (this has nothing to do with primes in the Eisenstein integers). \n\n==Definition==\n\nLet ''N'' be a rational prime, and define\n\n:''J''<sub>0</sub>(''N'') = ''J''\n\nas the Jacobian variety of the modular curve \n\n:''X''<sub>0</sub>(''N'') = ''X''.\n\nThere are endomorphisms ''T''<sub>''l''</sub> of ''J'' for each prime number ''l'' not dividing ''N''. These come from the Hecke operator, considered first as an [[algebraic correspondence]] on ''X'', and from there as acting on [[divisor class]]es, which gives the action on ''J''. There is also a [[Fricke involution]] ''w'' (and [[Atkin–Lehner involution]]s if ''N'' is composite). The Eisenstein ideal, in the (unital) subring of End(''J'') generated as a ring by the  ''T''<sub>''l''</sub>, is generated as an ideal by the elements\n\n: ''T''<sub>''l''</sub> &minus; ''l'' - 1\n\nfor all ''l'' not dividing ''N'', and by\n\n:''w'' + 1.\n\n==Geometric definition==\n\nSuppose that ''T''* is the ring generated by the Hecke operators acting on all modular forms for Γ<sub>0</sub>(''N'') (not just the cusp forms). The ring ''T'' of Hecke operators on the cusp forms is a quotient of ''T''*, so Spec(''T'') can be viewed as a subscheme of Spec(''T''*). Similarly Spec(''T''*) contains a line (called the Eisenstein line) isomorphic to Spec('''Z''') coming from the action of Hecke operators on the Eisenstein series. The Eisenstein ideal is the ideal defining the intersection of the Eisenstein line with Spec(''T'') in Spec(''T''*).\n\n==Example==\n\n*The Eisenstein ideal can also be defined for higher weight modular forms.

The map taking a Hecke operator ''T''<sub>''n''</sub> to its eigenvalues (σ<sub>11</sub>(''n''),τ(n)) gives a homomorphism from ''T'' into the ring '''Z'''×'''Z''' (where τ is the [[Ramanujan tau function]] and σ<sub>11</sub>(''n'') is the sum of the 11th powers of the divisors of ''n''). The image is the set of pairs (''c'',''d'') with ''c'' and ''d''  congruent mod 691 because of Ramanujan's congruence σ<sub>11</sub>(''n'') ≡ τ(n) mod 691. The Hecke algebra of Hecke operators acting on the cusp form  Δ is just isomorphic to '''Z'''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the concept of [[abelian variety]] is the higher-dimensional generalization of the [[elliptic curve]]. The '''equations defining abelian varieties''' are a topic of study because every abelian variety is a [[projective variety]]. In dimension ''d'' ≥ 2, however, it is no longer as straightforward to discuss such equations.\n\nThere is a large classical literature on this question, which in a reformulation is, for [[complex algebraic geometry]], a question of describing relations between [[theta function]]s. The modern geometric treatment now refers to some basic papers of [[David Mumford]], from 1966 to 1967, which reformulated that theory in terms from abstract algebraic geometry valid over general [[field (mathematics)|field]]s.\n\n==Complete intersections==\n\nThe only 'easy' cases are those for ''d'' = 1, for an elliptic curve with linear span the projective plane or projective 3-space. In the plane, every elliptic curve is given by a cubic curve. In ''P''<sup>3</sup>, an elliptic curve can be obtained as the intersection of two [[quadric]]s.\n\nIn general abelian varieties are not [[complete intersection]]s. [[Computer algebra]] techniques are now able to have some impact on the direct handling of equations for small values of ''d'' > 1.\n\n==Kummer surfaces==\n\nThe interest in nineteenth century geometry in the [[Kummer surface]] came in part from the way a [[quartic surface]] represented a quotient of an abelian variety with ''d'' = 2, by the group of order 2 of automorphisms generated by ''x'' → &minus;''x'' on the abelian variety.\n\n==General case==\n\nMumford defined a [[theta representation|theta group]] associated to an [[invertible sheaf]] ''L'' on an abelian variety ''A''. This is a group of self-automorphisms of ''L'', and is a finite analogue of the [[Heisenberg group]]. The primary results are on the action of the theta group on the [[global section]]s of ''L''. When ''L'' is [[very ample]], the [[linear representation]] can be described, by means of the structure of the theta group. In fact the theta group is abstractly a simple type of [[nilpotent group]], a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of a group of torsion points on ''A'', and the extension is known (it is in effect given by the [[Weil pairing]]). There is a uniqueness result for irreducible linear representations of the theta group with given [[central character]], or in other words an analogue of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]]. (It is assumed for this that the characteristic of the field of coefficients doesn't divide the order of the theta group.)\n\nMumford showed how this abstract algebraic formulation could account for the classical theory of theta functions with [[theta characteristic]]s, as being the case where the theta group was an extension of the two-torsion of ''A''.\n\nAn innovation in this area is to use the [[Mukai–Fourier transform]].\n\n==The coordinate ring==\nThe goal of the theory is to prove results on the [[homogeneous coordinate ring]] of the embedded abelian variety ''A'', that is, set in a projective space according to a very ample ''L'' and its global sections. The [[graded commutative ring]] that is formed by the direct sum of the global sections of the\n\n:<math>L^n,\\ </math>\n\nmeaning the ''n''-fold [[tensor product]] of itself, is represented as the [[quotient ring]] of a [[polynomial algebra]] by a [[homogeneous ideal]] ''I''. The graded parts of ''I'' have been the subject of intense study.\n\nQuadratic relations were provided by [[Bernhard Riemann]]. '''Koizumi's theorem''' states the third power of an ample line bundle is [[normally generated]]. The '''Mumford–Kempf theorem''' states that the fourth power of an ample line bundle is quadratically presented. For a base field of [[characteristic zero]], Giuseppe Pareschi proved a result including these (as the cases ''p'' = 0, 1) which had been conjectured by Lazarsfeld: let ''L'' be an ample line bundle on an abelian variety ''A''. If ''n'' &ge; ''p'' + 3, then the ''n''-th tensor power of ''L'' satisfies [[Homogeneous coordinate ring#Projective normality|condition ''N''<sub>p</sub>]].<ref>Giuseppe Pareschi, ''Syzygies of Abelian Varieties'', Journal of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Jul., 2000), pp. 651–664.</ref> Further results have been proved by Pareschi and Popa, including previous work in the field.<ref>Giuseppe Pareschi, Minhea Popa, ''Regularity on abelian varieties II: basic results on linear series and defining equations'', J.

Most natural functors, including basic ones like [[direct image functor|pushforwards]] and [[inverse image functor|pullbacks]], are of this type.\n\nThese kinds of functors were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Mukai|year=1981|authorlink=Shigeru Mukai}} in order to prove an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the derived categories of coherent sheaves on an [[abelian variety]] and its [[dual abelian variety|dual]]. That equivalence is analogous to the classical [[Fourier transform]] that gives an isomorphism between [[Distribution (mathematics)|tempered distribution]]s on a finite-dimensional real [[vector space]] and its [[dual vector space|dual]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nLet ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[projective variety|projective varieties]], ''K'' ∈ D<sup>b</sup>(''X''×''Y'') an object in the derived category of coherent sheaves on their product.

It is the connected component of the identity in the [[Picard group]] of ''C'', hence an [[abelian variety]].\n\n==Introduction==\n\nThe Jacobian variety is named after [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]], who proved the complete version [[Abel-Jacobi theorem]], making the injectivity statement of [[Niels Abel]] into an isomorphism. It is a principally polarized [[abelian variety]], of [[dimension]] ''g'', and hence, over the complex numbers, it is a [[complex torus]].

This holds for fields that are not algebraically closed, provided one considers divisors and functions defined over that field.\n\n==Further notions==\n[[Torelli's theorem]] states that a complex curve is determined by its Jacobian (with its polarization).\n\nThe [[Schottky problem]] asks which principally polarized abelian varieties are the Jacobians of curves.\n\nThe [[Picard variety]], the [[Albanese variety]], and [[intermediate Jacobian]]s are generalizations of the Jacobian for higher-dimensional varieties. For varieties of higher dimension the construction of the Jacobian variety as a quotient of the space of holomorphic 1-forms generalizes to give the [[Albanese variety]], but in general this  need not be isomorphic to the Picard variety.\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | author=P.

It was constructed by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1961/62}}, and also described by {{harvtxt|Mumford|1966}} and {{harvtxt|Kleiman|2005}}. The '''Picard variety''' is dual to the [[Albanese variety]] of classical algebraic geometry.\n\nIn the cases of most importance to classical algebraic geometry, for a [[non-singular]] [[complete variety]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero, the [[connected space|connected component]] of the identity in the Picard scheme is an [[abelian variety]] written Pic<sup>0</sup>(''V''). In the particular case where ''V'' is a curve, this neutral component is the [[Jacobian variety]] of ''V''. For fields of positive characteristic however, [[Jun-Ichi Igusa|Igusa]] constructed an example of a smooth projective surface ''S'' with Pic<sup>0</sup>(''S'') non-reduced, and hence not an [[abelian variety]].\n\nThe quotient Pic(''V'')/Pic<sup>0</sup>(''V'') is a [[finitely-generated abelian group]] denoted NS(''V''), the '''[[Néron&ndash;Severi group]]''' of ''V''. In other words the Picard group fits into an [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>1\\to \\mathrm{Pic}^0(V)\\to\\mathrm{Pic}(V)\\to \\mathrm{NS}(V)\\to 1.\\,</math>\n\nThe fact that the rank is finite is [[Francesco Severi]]'s '''theorem of the base'''; the rank is the '''Picard number''' of ''V'', often denoted &rho;(''V'').

In its original form, it was applied to an unramified [[Double cover (topology)|double covering]] of a [[Riemann surface]], and was used by [[Friedrich Schottky|F. Schottky]] and H. W. E. Jung in relation with the [[Schottky problem]], as it is now called, of characterising [[Jacobian varieties]] among abelian varieties.  It is said to have appeared first in the late work of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]], and was extensively studied by [[Wilhelm Wirtinger|Wirtinger]] in 1895, including degenerate cases.\n\nGiven a non-constant morphism\n\n:&phi;: ''C''<sub>1</sub> &rarr; ''C''<sub>2</sub>\n\nof algebraic curves, write ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> for the Jacobian variety of ''C''<sub>''i''</sub>. Then from φ construct the corresponding morphism\n\n:&psi;: ''J''<sub>1</sub> &rarr; ''J''<sub>2</sub>,\n\nwhich can be defined on a divisor class ''D'' of degree zero by applying φ to each point of the divisor. This is a well-defined morphism, often called the ''norm homomorphism''. Then the Prym variety of φ is the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ψ. To qualify that somewhat, to get an abelian ''variety'', the [[connected component of the identity]] of the [[reduced scheme]] underlying the [[kernel (scheme theory)|kernel]] may be intended. Or in other words take the largest abelian subvariety of  ''J''<sub>1</sub> on which ψ is trivial.\n\nThe theory of Prym varieties was dormant for a long time, until revived by [[David Mumford]] around 1970. It now plays a substantial role in some contemporary theories, for example of the [[Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation]].  One advantage of the method is that it allows one to apply the theory of curves to the study of a wider class of abelian varieties than Jacobians.  For example, [[principally polarized]] abelian varieties (p.p.a.v.'s) of dimension > 3 are not generally Jacobians, but all p.p.a.v.'s of dimension 5 or less are Prym varieties.  It is for this reason that p.p.a.v.'s are fairly well understood up to dimension 5.\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |first1=Christina |last1=Birkenhake |first2=Herbert |last2=Lange |year=2004 |title=Complex Abelian Varieties |chapter=Prym varieties |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=3-540-20488-1 |pages=363–410 }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Mumford | first1=David | author1-link=David Mumford | editor1-last=Ahlfors | editor1-first=Lars V. | editor2-last=Kra | editor2-first=Irwin | editor3-last=Nirenberg | editor3-first=Louis |display-editors = 3 | editor4-last=Maskit | editor4-first=Bernard | title=Contributions to analysis (a collection of papers dedicated to Lipman Bers) | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | isbn=978-0-12-044850-0 |mr=0379510 | year=1974 | chapter=Prym varieties.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Schottky problem,''' named after [[Friedrich Schottky]], is a classical question of [[algebraic geometry]], asking for a characterisation of [[Jacobian varieties]] amongst [[abelian varieties]].\n\n==Geometric formulation==\nMore precisely, one should consider [[algebraic curve]]s ''C'' of a given [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'', and their Jacobians ''J''. There is a [[moduli space]] ''M''<sub>''g''</sub> of such curves, and a moduli space ''A''<sub>''g''</sub> of abelian varieties of dimension ''g'', which are ''principally polarized''. There is a morphism\n\n:&iota;: ''M''<sub>''g''</sub> &rarr; ''A''<sub>''g''</sub>\n\nwhich on points ([[geometric point]]s, to be more accurate) takes ''C'' to ''J''. The content of [[Torelli's theorem]] is that ι is injective (again, on points). The '''Schottky problem''' asks for a description of the image of ι.\n\nThe dimension of ''M''<sub>''g''</sub> is 3''g'' &minus; ''3'', for ''g'' ≥ 2, while the dimension of ''A''<sub>''g''</sub> is ''g''(''g'' + 1)/2.  This means that the dimensions are the same (0, 1, 3, 6) for ''g'' = 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore ''g'' = 4 is the first interesting case, and this was studied by F. Schottky in the 1880s. Schottky applied the [[theta constant]]s, which are [[modular form]]s for the [[Siegel upper half-space]], to define the '''Schottky locus''' in ''A''<sub>''g''</sub>. A more precise form of the question is to determine whether the image of ι essentially coincides with the Schottky locus (in other words, whether it is [[Zariski dense]] there).\n\n==Period lattice formulation==\n\nIf one describes the moduli space ''A''<sub>''g''</sub> in intuitive terms, as the parameters on which an abelian variety depends, then the Schottky problem asks simply what condition on the parameters implies that the abelian variety comes from a curve's Jacobian. The classical case, over the complex number field, has received most of the attention, and then an abelian variety ''A'' is simply a [[complex torus]] of a particular type, arising from a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in '''C'''<sup>''g''</sup>. In relatively concrete terms, it is being asked which lattices are the ''period lattices'' of [[compact Riemann surface]]s.\n\n==Riemann's matrix formulation==\n''Note that a Riemann matrix is quite different from any [[Riemann tensor]]''\n\nOne of the major achievements of [[Bernhard Riemann]] was his theory of complex tori and [[theta function]]s. Using the [[Riemann theta function]], necessary and sufficient conditions on a lattice were written down by Riemann for a lattice in '''C'''<sup>''g''</sup> to have the corresponding torus embed into [[complex projective space]]. (The interpretation may have come later, with [[Solomon Lefschetz]], but Riemann's theory was definitive.) The data is what is now called a '''Riemann matrix'''. Therefore the complex Schottky problem becomes the question of characterising the [[period matrix|period matrices]] of compact Riemann surfaces of genus ''g'', formed by integrating a basis for the [[abelian integral]]s round a basis for the first [[homology group]], amongst all Riemann matrices. It was solved by [[Takahiro Shiota]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Takahiro |year=1986 |title=Characterization of Jacobian varieties in terms of soliton equations |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=333–382 |doi=10.1007/BF01388967 }}</ref>\n\n==Geometry of the problem==\n\nThere are a number of geometric approaches, and the question has also been shown to implicate the [[Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation]], related to [[soliton]] theory.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Beauville | first1=Arnaud | title=Le problème de Schottky et la conjecture de Novikov | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=SB_1986-1987__29__101_0 | series=Séminaire Bourbaki |mr=936851 | year=1987 | journal=Astérisque | issn=0303-1179 | issue=152 | pages=101–112 }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Debarre | first1=Olivier | title=Current topics in complex algebraic geometry (Berkeley, CA, 1992/93) | url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book28/contents.html | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Math.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''theorem of the cube''' is a condition for a [[line bundle]] over a product of three complete varieties to be trivial. It was a principle discovered, in the context of [[linear equivalence]], by the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. The final version of the theorem of the cube was first published by {{harvtxt|Lang|1959}}, who credited it to [[André Weil]]. A discussion of the history has been given by {{harvtxt|Kleiman|2005}}. A treatment by means of [[sheaf cohomology]], and description in terms of the [[Picard functor]], was given \nby {{harvtxt|Mumford|2008}}.\n\n==Statement==\nThe theorem states that for any [[complete variety|complete varieties]] ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'' over an algebraically closed field, and given points ''u'', ''v'' and ''w'' on them, any [[invertible sheaf]] ''L'' which has a trivial restriction to each of ''U''&times; ''V'' &times; {''w''}, ''U''&times; {''v''} &times; ''W'', and {''u''} &times; ''V'' &times; ''W'', is itself trivial. (Mumford p.&nbsp;55; the result there is slightly stronger, in that one of the varieties need not be complete and can be replaced by a connected scheme.) \n\n===Special cases===\nOn a [[ringed space]] ''X'', an invertible sheaf ''L'' is ''trivial'' if isomorphic to ''O''<sub>''X''</sub>, as an ''O''<sub>''X''</sub>-module.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Weil pairing''' is a  [[pairing]] ([[bilinear form]], though with [[multiplicative notation]]) on the points of order dividing ''n''  of an [[elliptic curve]] ''E'', taking values in ''n''th [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. More generally there is a similar Weil pairing between points of order ''n'' of an abelian variety and its dual. It was introduced by [[André Weil]] ([[#{{harvid|Weil|1940}}|1940]]) for Jacobians of curves, who gave an abstract algebraic definition; the corresponding results for [[elliptic function]]s were known, and can be expressed simply by use of the [[Weierstrass sigma function]].\n\n==Formulation==\nChoose an elliptic curve ''E'' defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', and an integer ''n''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 (we require ''n'' to be prime to char(''K'') if char(''K'')&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0) such that ''K'' contains a [[primitive nth root of unity]]. Then the ''n''-torsion on <math>E(\\overline{K})</math> is known to be a [[Cartesian product]] of two [[cyclic group]]s of order ''n''. The Weil pairing produces an ''n''-th root of unity\n\n:<math>w(P,Q) \\in \\mu_n</math>\n\nby means of [[Kummer theory]], for any two points <math>P,Q \\in E(K)[n]</math>, where <math>E(K)[n]=\\{T \\in E(K) \\mid n \\cdot T = O \\} </math> and <math>\\mu_n = \\{x\\in K \\mid x^n =1 \\} </math>.\n\nA down-to-earth construction of the Weil pairing is as follows. Choose a function ''F'' in the [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of ''E'' over the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K'' with [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]]\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{div}(F)= \\sum_{0 \\leq k < n}[P+k\\cdot Q] - \\sum_{0 \\leq k < n} [k\\cdot Q]. </math>\n\nSo ''F'' has a simple zero at each point ''P'' + ''kQ'', and a simple pole at each point ''kQ'' if these points are all distinct. Then ''F'' is well-defined up to multiplication by a constant. If ''G'' is the translation of ''F'' by ''Q'', then by construction ''G'' has the same divisor, so the function ''G/F'' is constant.\n\nTherefore if we define\n\n:<math> w(P,Q):=\\frac{G}{F}</math>\n\nwe shall have an ''n''-th root of unity (as translating ''n'' times must give 1) other than 1. With this definition it can be shown that ''w'' is alternating and bilinear,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Silverman|first1=Joseph|title=The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves|date=1986|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-96203-4}}</ref> giving rise to a non-degenerate pairing on the ''n''-torsion.\n\nThe Weil pairing does not extend to a pairing on all the torsion points (the direct limit of ''n''-torsion points) because the pairings for different ''n'' are not the same.

(When the [[coefficient field]] has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 2 or 3, the above equation is not quite general enough to comprise all non-singular [[cubic plane curve|cubic curves]]; see {{section link|#Elliptic curves over a general field}} below.)\n\nFormally, an elliptic curve is a [[Nonsingular variety|smooth]], [[Projective variety|projective]], [[algebraic curve]] of [[Genus of an algebraic curve|genus]] one, on which there is a specified point ''O''. An elliptic curve is an [[abelian variety]] – that is, it has a multiplication defined algebraically, with respect to which it is an [[abelian group]] – and ''O'' serves as the identity element. Often the curve itself, without ''O'' specified, is called an elliptic curve; the point ''O'' is often taken to be the curve's \"[[point at infinity]]\" in the [[projective plane]].\n\nIf ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''P''(''x''), where ''P'' is any polynomial of degree three in ''x'' with no repeated roots, the solution set is a nonsingular plane curve of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] one, an elliptic curve. If ''P'' has degree four and is [[Square-free polynomial|square-free]] this equation again describes a plane curve of genus one; however, it has no natural choice of identity element. More generally, any algebraic curve of genus one, for example from the intersection of two [[quadric|quadric surfaces]] embedded in three-dimensional projective space, is called an elliptic curve, provided that it has at least one [[rational point]] to act as the identity.\n\nUsing the theory of [[elliptic function]]s, it can be shown that elliptic curves defined over the [[complex number]]s correspond to embeddings of the [[torus]] into the [[complex projective plane]]. The torus is also an [[abelian group]], and in fact this correspondence is also a [[group isomorphism]].\n\nElliptic curves are especially important in [[number theory]], and constitute a major area of current research; for example, they were used in the proof, by [[Andrew Wiles]], of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. They also find applications in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] (ECC) and [[integer factorization]].\n\nAn elliptic curve is ''not'' an [[ellipse]]: see [[elliptic integral]] for the origin of the term.  Topologically, a complex elliptic curve is a [[torus]].\n\n==Elliptic curves over the real numbers==\n[[Image:ECClines-3.svg|frame|right|Graphs of curves ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x'' and ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x'' + 1]]\nAlthough the formal definition of an elliptic curve is fairly technical and requires some background in [[algebraic geometry]], it is possible to describe some features of elliptic curves over the [[real number]]s using only introductory [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].\n\nIn this context, an elliptic curve is a [[plane curve]] defined by an equation of the form\n\n:<math>y^2 = x^3 + ax + b</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. This type of equation is called a [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions|Weierstrass equation]].\n\nThe definition of elliptic curve also requires that the curve be [[non-singular]]. Geometrically, this means that the graph has no [[cusp (singularity)|cusps]], self-intersections, or isolated points. Algebraically, this holds if and only if the [[discriminant]]\n\n: <math>\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)</math>\n\nis not equal to zero. (Although the factor −16 is irrelevant to whether or not the curve is non-singular, this definition of the discriminant is useful in a more advanced study of elliptic curves.)\n\nThe (real) graph of a non-singular curve has ''two'' components if its discriminant is positive, and ''one'' component if it is negative. For example, in the graphs shown in figure to the right, the discriminant in the first case is 64, and in the second case is −368.\n\n==The group law==\nWhen working in the [[projective plane]], we can define a group structure on any smooth cubic curve. In Weierstrass normal form, such a curve will have an additional point at infinity, ''O'', at the [[homogeneous coordinates]] [0:1:0] which serves as the identity of the group.\n\nSince the curve is symmetrical about the x-axis, given any point ''P'', we can take −''P'' to be the point opposite it. We take −''O'' to be just ''O''.\n\nIf ''P'' and ''Q'' are two points on the curve, then we can uniquely describe a third point, ''P'' + ''Q'', in the following way. First, draw the line that intersects ''P'' and ''Q''. This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, ''R''. We then take ''P'' + ''Q'' to be −''R'', the point opposite ''R''.\n\nThis definition for addition works except in a few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is when one of the points is ''O''. Here, we define ''P'' + ''O'' = ''P'' = ''O'' + ''P'', making ''O'' the identity of the group. Next, if ''P'' and ''Q'' are opposites of each other, we define ''P'' + ''Q'' = ''O''. Lastly, if ''P'' = ''Q'' we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point ''R'' and we can take its opposite. However, if ''P'' happens to be an [[inflection point]] (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take ''R'' to be ''P'' itself and ''P'' + ''P'' is simply the point opposite itself.\n\nFor a cubic curve not in Weierstrass normal form, we can still define a group structure by designating one of its nine inflection points as the identity ''O''. In the projective plane, each line will intersect a cubic at three points when accounting for multiplicity. For a point ''P'', −''P'' is defined as the unique third point on the line passing through ''O'' and ''P''. Then, for any ''P'' and ''Q'', ''P'' + ''Q'' is defined as −''R'' where ''R'' is the unique third point on the line containing ''P'' and ''Q''.\n\nLet ''K'' be a field over which the curve is defined (i.e., the coefficients of the defining equation or equations of the curve are in ''K'') and denote the curve by ''E''. Then the ''K''-[[rational point]]s of ''E'' are the points on ''E'' whose coordinates all lie in ''K'', including the point at infinity. The set of ''K''-rational points is denoted by ''E''(''K'').  It, too, forms a group, because properties of polynomial equations show that if ''P'' is in ''E''(''K''), then −''P'' is also in ''E''(''K''), and if two of ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' are in ''E''(''K''), then so is the third.  Additionally, if ''K'' is a subfield of ''L'', then ''E''(''K'') is a [[subgroup]] of ''E''(''L'').\n\nThe above group can be described algebraically as well as geometrically. Given the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'' over the field ''K'' (whose [[Prime subfield|characteristic]] we assume to be neither 2 nor 3), and points ''P'' = (''x<sub>P</sub>'', ''y<sub>P</sub>'') and ''Q'' = (''x<sub>Q</sub>'', ''y<sub>Q</sub>'') on the curve, assume first that ''x<sub>P</sub>'' ≠ ''x<sub>Q</sub>'' (first pane below). Let ''y = sx + d'' be the line that intersects ''P'' and ''Q'', which has the following slope:\n\n:<math>s = \\frac{y_P - y_Q}{x_P - x_Q}</math>\n\nSince ''K'' is a field, ''s'' is well-defined. The line equation and the curve equation have an identical ''y'' in the points ''x<sub>P</sub>'', ''x<sub>Q</sub>'', and ''x<sub>R</sub>''.\n\n:<math>(s x + d)^2 = x^3 + ax + b</math>\n\nwhich is equivalent to <math>0 = x^3 - s^2 x^2 - 2xd + ax + b - d^2</math>. We know that this equation has its roots in exactly the same ''x''-values as\n\n:<math>(x - x_P) (x - x_Q) (x - x_R) = x^3 + x^2 (-x_P - x_Q - x_R) + x (x_P x_Q + x_P x_R + x_Q x_R) - x_P x_Q x_R </math>\n\nWe [[Equating_coefficients|equate the coefficient]] for ''x<sup>2</sup>'' and solve for ''x<sub>R</sub>''. ''y<sub>R</sub>'' follows from the line equation. This defines ''R'' = (''x<sub>R</sub>'', ''y<sub>R</sub>'') = −(''P'' + ''Q'') with\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x_R &= s^2 - x_P - x_Q \\\\\n  y_R &= y_P + s(x_R - x_P)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf ''x<sub>P</sub>'' = ''x<sub>Q</sub>'', then there are two options: if ''y<sub>P</sub>'' = −''y<sub>Q</sub>'' (third and fourth panes below), including the case where ''y<sub>P</sub>'' = ''y<sub>Q</sub>'' = 0 (fourth pane), then the sum is defined as 0; thus, the inverse of each point on the curve is found by reflecting it across the ''x''-axis. If ''y<sub>P</sub>'' = ''y<sub>Q</sub>'' ≠ 0, then ''Q'' = ''P'' and ''R'' = (''x''<sub>''R''</sub>, ''y''<sub>''R''</sub>) = −(''P'' + ''P'') = −2''P'' = −2''Q'' (second pane below with ''P'' shown for ''R'') is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    s &= \\frac{3{x_P}^2 + a}{2y_P}\\\\\n  x_R &= s^2 - 2x_P\\\\\n  y_R &= y_P + s(x_R - x_P)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n[[Image:ECClines.svg]]\n</div>\n\n==Elliptic curves over the complex numbers==\n[[Image:Lattice torsion points.svg|right|thumb|300px|An elliptic curve over the complex numbers is obtained as a quotient of the complex plane by a lattice Λ, here spanned by two fundamental periods ω<sub>1</sub> and ω<sub>2</sub>. The four-torsion is also shown, corresponding to the lattice 1/4 Λ containing Λ.]]\nThe formulation of elliptic curves as the embedding of a [[torus]] in the [[complex projective plane]] follows naturally from a curious property of [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions]].  These functions and their first derivative are related by the formula\n\n:<math>\\wp'(z)^2 = 4\\wp(z)^3 -g_2\\wp(z) - g_3</math>\n\nHere, ''g''<sub>2</sub> and ''g''<sub>3</sub> are constants; <math>\\wp(z)</math> is the Weierstrass elliptic function and <math>\\wp'(z)</math> its derivative. It should be clear that this relation is in the form of an elliptic curve (over the [[complex number]]s). The Weierstrass functions are doubly periodic; that is, they are periodic with respect to a [[fundamental pair of periods|lattice]] Λ; in essence, the Weierstrass functions are naturally defined on a torus  ''T'' = '''C'''/Λ. This torus may be embedded in the complex projective plane by means of the map\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto [1 :\\wp(z) : \\wp'(z)/2]</math>\n\nThis map is a [[group isomorphism]] of the torus (considered with its natural group structure) with the chord-and-tangent group law on the cubic curve which is the image of this map.  It is also an isomorphism of [[Riemann surface]]s from the torus to the cubic curve, so topologically, an elliptic curve is a torus.  If the lattice Λ is related by multiplication by a non-zero complex number ''c'' to a lattice ''c''Λ, then the corresponding curves are isomorphic. Isomorphism classes of elliptic curves are specified by the [[j-invariant]].\n\nThe isomorphism classes can be understood in a simpler way as well. The constants ''g''<sub>2</sub> and ''g''<sub>3</sub>, called the [[j-invariant|modular invariant]]s, are uniquely determined by the lattice, that is, by the structure of the torus. However, the complex numbers form the [[splitting field]] for polynomials with real coefficients, and so the elliptic curve may be written as\n:<math>y^2 = x(x - 1)(x - \\lambda)</math>\n\nOne finds that\n:<math>g_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]4}{3} (\\lambda^2 - \\lambda + 1)</math>\n\nand\n:<math>g_3 = \\frac{1}{27} (\\lambda + 1)(2\\lambda^2 - 5\\lambda + 2)</math>\n\nso that the [[modular discriminant]] is\n:<math>\\Delta = g_2^3 - 27g_3^2 = \\lambda^2(\\lambda - 1)^2</math>\n\nHere, λ is sometimes called the [[modular lambda function]].\n\nNote that the [[uniformization theorem]] implies that every [[Compact space|compact]] Riemann surface of genus one can be represented as a torus.\n\nThis also allows an easy understanding of the [[torsion subgroup|torsion points]] on an elliptic curve: if the lattice Λ is spanned by the fundamental periods ω<sub>1</sub> and ω<sub>2</sub>, then the ''n''-torsion points are the (equivalence classes of) points of the form\n:<math> \\frac{a}{n} \\omega_1 + \\frac{b}{n} \\omega_2</math>\n\nfor ''a'' and ''b'' integers in the range from 0 to ''n''−1.\n\nOver the complex numbers, every elliptic curve has nine [[inflection point]]s. Every line through two of these points also passes through a third inflection point; the nine points and 12 lines formed in this way form a realization of the [[Hesse configuration]].\n\n==Elliptic curves over the rational numbers==\nA curve ''E'' defined over the field of rational numbers is also defined over the field of real numbers. Therefore, the law of addition (of points with real coordinates) by the tangent and secant method can be applied to ''E''. The explicit formulae show that the sum of two points ''P'' and ''Q'' with rational coordinates has again rational coordinates, since the line joining ''P'' and ''Q'' has rational coefficients.<!--Il en est de même pour le symétrique par rapport à l'axe des abscisses d'un point à coordonnées rationnelles.--> This way, one shows that the set of rational points of ''E'' forms a subgroup of the group of real points of ''E''. As this group, it is an [[abelian group]], that is, ''P'' + ''Q'' = ''Q'' + ''P''.\n\n===The structure of rational points===\nThe most important result is that all points can be constructed by the method of tangents and secants starting with a ''finite'' number of points. More precisely<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=Theorem 4.1}}</ref> the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] states that the group ''E''('''Q''') is a [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] (abelian) group. By the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] it is therefore a finite direct sum of copies of '''Z''' and finite cyclic groups.\n\nThe proof of that theorem<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=pp. 199–205}}</ref> rests on two ingredients: first, one shows that for any integer ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1, the [[quotient group]] ''E''('''Q''')/''mE''('''Q''') is finite (weak Mordell–Weil theorem). Second, introducing a [[height function]] ''h'' on the rational points ''E''('''Q''') defined by ''h''(''P''<sub>0</sub>) = 0 and {{math|''h''(''P'') {{=}} log max(&#124;''p''&#124;, &#124;''q''&#124;)}} if ''P'' (unequal to the point at infinity ''P''<sub>0</sub>) has as abscissa the rational number ''x'' = ''p''/''q'' (with [[coprime]] ''p'' and ''q''). This height function ''h'' has the property that ''h''(''mP'') grows roughly like the square of ''m''. Moreover, only finitely many rational points with height smaller than any constant exist on ''E''.\n\nThe proof of the theorem is thus a variant of the method of [[infinite descent]]<ref>See also J. W. S. Cassels, [[Mordell]]'s Finite Basis Theorem Revisited, ''Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'' 100, 3–41 and the comment of A. Weil on the genesis of his work: A. Weil, ''Collected Papers'', vol. 1, 520–521.</ref> and relies on the repeated application of [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclidean division]]s on ''E'': let ''P'' ∈ ''E''('''Q''') be a rational point on the curve, writing ''P'' as the sum 2''P''<sub>1</sub> + ''Q''<sub>1</sub> where ''Q''<sub>1</sub> is a fixed representant of ''P'' in ''E''('''Q''')/2''E''('''Q'''), the height of ''P''<sub>1</sub> is about {{sfrac|1|4}} of the one of ''P'' (more generally, replacing 2 by any ''m'' > 1, and {{sfrac|1|4}} by {{sfrac|1|''m''<sup>2</sup>}}). Redoing the same with ''P''<sub>1</sub>, that is to say ''P''<sub>1</sub> = 2''P''<sub>2</sub> + ''Q''<sub>2</sub>, then ''P''<sub>2</sub> = 2''P''<sub>3</sub> + ''Q''<sub>3</sub>, etc. finally expresses ''P'' as an integral linear combination of points ''Q<sub>i</sub>'' and of points whose height is bounded by a fixed constant chosen in advance: by the weak Mordell–Weil theorem and the second property of the height function ''P'' is thus expressed as an integral linear combination of a finite number of fixed points.\n\nSo far, the theorem is not effective since there is no known general procedure for determining the representants of ''E''('''Q''')/''mE''('''Q''').\n\nThe [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of ''E''('''Q'''), that is the number of copies of '''Z''' in ''E''('''Q''') or, equivalently, the number of independent points of infinite order, is called the ''rank'' of ''E''. The [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] is concerned with determining the rank. One conjectures that it can be arbitrarily large, even if only examples with relatively small rank are known. The elliptic curve with biggest exactly known rank is\n:''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''xy'' + ''y'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x''<sup>2</sup> + {{gaps|31|368|015|812|338|065|133|318|565|292|206|590|792|820|353|345}}''x'' + {{gaps|302|038|802|698|566|087|335|643|188|429|543|498|624|522|041|683|874|493|555|186|062|568|159|847}}\n\nIt has rank 19, found by [[Noam Elkies]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~duje/tors/rankhist.html|title=History of elliptic curves rank records|last=Dujella|first=Andrej|authorlink=Andrej Dujella|accessdate=|publisher = University of Zagreb}}</ref> Curves of rank at least 28 are known, but their rank is not exactly known.\n\nAs for the groups constituting the [[torsion subgroup]] of ''E''('''Q'''), the following is known:<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=Theorem 7.5}}</ref> the torsion subgroup of ''E''('''Q''') is one of the 15 following groups ([[Mazur's torsion theorem|a theorem]] due to [[Barry Mazur]]): '''Z'''/''N'''''Z''' for ''N'' = 1, 2, ..., 10, or 12, or '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × '''Z'''/2''N'''''Z''' with ''N'' = 1, 2, 3, 4.

The conjecture relies on analytic and arithmetic objects defined by the elliptic curve in question.\n\nAt the analytic side, an important ingredient is a function of a complex variable, ''L'', the [[Hasse–Weil zeta function]] of ''E'' over '''Q'''. This function is a variant of the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Dirichlet L-function]]s. It is defined as an [[Euler product]], with one factor for every [[prime number]] ''p''.\n\nFor a curve ''E'' over '''Q''' given by a minimal equation\n:<math>y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6</math>\n\nwith integral coefficients <math>a_i</math>, reducing the coefficients [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''p'' defines an elliptic curve over the [[finite field]] '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> (except for a finite number of primes ''p'', where the reduced curve has a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] and thus fails to be elliptic, in which case ''E'' is said to be of [[bad reduction]] at ''p'').\n\nThe zeta function of an elliptic curve over a finite field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> is, in some sense, a [[generating function]] assembling the information of the number of points of ''E'' with values in the finite [[field extension]]s '''F'''<sub>''p<sup>n</sup>''</sub> of '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>.

It is defined by\n:<math>L(E(\\mathbf{Q}), s) = \\prod_p \\left(1 - a_p p^{-s} + \\varepsilon(p)p^{1 - 2s}\\right)^{-1}</math>\n\nwhere ε(''p'') = 1 if ''E'' has good reduction at ''p'' and 0 otherwise (in which case ''a<sub>p</sub>'' is defined differently from the method above: see Silverman (1986) below).\n\nThis product [[absolute convergence|converges]] for Re(''s'') > 3/2 only. Hasse's conjecture affirms that the ''L''-function admits an [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane and satisfies a [[functional equation]] relating, for any ''s'', ''L''(''E'', ''s'') to ''L''(''E'', 2 − ''s''). In 1999 this was shown to be a consequence of the proof of the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture, which asserts that every elliptic curve over ''Q'' is a [[modular curve]], which implies that its ''L''-function is the ''L''-function of a [[modular form]] whose analytic continuation is known.\n\nOne can therefore speak about the values of ''L''(''E'', ''s'') at any complex number ''s''. The Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture relates the arithmetic of the curve to the behavior of its ''L''-function at ''s'' = 1. More precisely, it affirms that the order of the ''L''-function at ''s'' = 1 equals the rank of ''E'' and predicts the leading term of the Laurent series of ''L''(''E'', ''s'') at that point in terms of several quantities attached to the elliptic curve.\n\nMuch like the [[Riemann hypothesis]], this conjecture has multiple consequences, including the following two:\n* Let ''n'' be an odd [[square-free integer]]. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, ''n'' is the area of a right triangle with rational side lengths (a [[congruent number]]) if and only if the number of triplets of integers (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') satisfying <math>2x^2 + y^2 + 8z^2 = n</math> is twice the number of triples satisfying <math>2x^2 + y^2 + 32z^2 = n</math>. This statement, due to [[Tunnell's theorem|Tunnell]], is related to the fact that ''n'' is a congruent number if and only if the elliptic curve <math>y^2 = x^3 - n^2x</math> has a rational point of infinite order (thus, under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, its ''L''-function has a zero at 1). The interest in this statement is that the condition is easily verified.<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Koblitz|year=1993|nb=yes}}</ref>\n*In a different direction, certain analytic methods allow for an estimation of the order of zero in the center of the [[critical strip]] of families of ''L''-functions. Admitting the BSD conjecture, these estimations correspond to information about the rank of families of elliptic curves in question. For example: assuming the [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] and the BSD conjecture, the average rank of curves given by <math>y^2=x^3+ax+b</math> is smaller than 2.<ref>{{cite journal |first=D.

Showing that they are equivalent is difficult and was a main topic of number theory in the second half of the 20th century. The modularity of an elliptic curve ''E'' of conductor ''N'' can be expressed also by saying that there is a non-constant [[rational map]] defined over '''Q''', from the modular curve ''X''<sub>0</sub>(''N'') to ''E''. In particular, the points of ''E'' can be parametrized by [[modular function]]s.\n\nFor example, a modular parametrization of the curve <math>y^2 - y = x^3 - x</math> is given by<ref>{{cite book |first=D. |last=Zagier |title=Modular points, modular curves, modular surfaces and modular forms |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics |volume=1111 |publisher=Springer |year=1985 |pages=225–248 |doi= }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x(z) &= q^{-2} + 2q^{-1} + 5 + 9q + 18q^2 + 29q^3 + 51q^4 +\\ldots\\\\\n  y(z) &= q^{-3} + 3q^{-2} + 9q^{-1} + 21 + 46q + 92q^2 + 180q^3 +\\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere, as above, ''q'' = exp(2π''iz''). The functions ''x(z)'' and ''y(z)'' are modular of weight 0 and level 37; in other words they are [[meromorphic]], defined on the [[upper half-plane]] Im(''z'') > 0 and satisfy\n:<math>x\\!\\left(\\frac{az + b}{cz + d}\\right) = x(z)</math>\n\nand likewise for ''y(z)'' for all integers ''a, b, c, d'' with ''ad'' − ''bc'' = 1 and 37|''c''.\n\nAnother formulation depends on the comparison of [[Galois representation]]s attached on the one hand to elliptic curves, and on the other hand to modular forms. The latter formulation has been used in the proof the conjecture. Dealing with the level of the forms (and the connection to the conductor of the curve) is particularly delicate.\n\nThe most spectacular application of the conjecture is the proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (FLT). Suppose that for a prime ''p'' ≥ 5, the Fermat equation\n:<math>a^p + b^p = c^p</math>\n\nhas a solution with non-zero integers, hence a counter-example to FLT.

In particular, the group ''E(K)'' of ''K''-rational points of an elliptic curve ''E'' defined over ''K'' is finitely generated, which generalizes the Mordell–Weil theorem above. A theorem due to [[Loïc Merel]] shows that for a given integer ''d'', there are ([[up to]] isomorphism) only finitely many groups that can occur as the torsion groups of ''E''(''K'') for an elliptic curve defined over a number field ''K'' of [[degree of a field extension|degree]] ''d''. More precisely,<ref>{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Merel | authorlink=Loïc Merel | title=Bornes pour la torsion des courbes elliptiques sur les corps de nombres | language=French | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=124 |year=1996 |issue=1–3 |pages=437–449 | zbl=0936.11037 | doi=10.1007/s002220050059 }}</ref> there is a number ''B''(''d'') such that for any elliptic curve ''E'' defined over a number field ''K'' of degree ''d'', any torsion point of ''E''(''K'') is of [[order (group theory)|order]] less than ''B''(''d''). The theorem is effective: for ''d'' > 1, if a torsion point is of order ''p'', with ''p'' prime, then\n:<math>p < d^{3d^2}</math>\n\nAs for the integral points, Siegel's theorem generalizes to the following: Let ''E'' be an elliptic curve defined over a number field ''K'', ''x'' and ''y'' the Weierstrass coordinates. Then there are only finitely many points of ''E(K)'' whose ''x''-coordinate is in the [[ring of integers]] ''O''<sub>''K''</sub>.\n\nThe properties of the Hasse–Weil zeta function and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture can also be extended to this more general situation.\n\n==Elliptic curves over a general field==\nElliptic curves can be defined over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''; the formal definition of an elliptic curve is a non-singular projective algebraic curve over ''K'' with [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1 and endowed with a distinguished point defined over ''K''.\n\nIf the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' is neither 2 nor 3, then every elliptic curve over ''K'' can be written in the form\n:<math>y^2 = x^3 - px - q</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' and ''q'' are elements of ''K'' such that the right hand side polynomial ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''px'' − ''q'' does not have any double roots. If the characteristic is 2 or 3, then more terms need to be kept: in characteristic 3, the most general equation is of the form\n:<math>y^2 = 4x^3 + b_2 x^2 + 2b_4 x + b_6</math>\n\nfor arbitrary constants ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''b''<sub>4</sub>, ''b''<sub>6</sub> such that the polynomial on the right-hand side has distinct roots (the notation is chosen for historical reasons).  In characteristic 2, even this much is not possible, and the most general equation is\n\n:<math>y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6</math>\n\nprovided that the variety it defines is non-singular. If characteristic were not an obstruction, each equation would reduce to the previous ones by a suitable change of variables.\n\nOne typically takes the curve to be the set of all points (''x'',''y'') which satisfy the above equation and such that both ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K''. Points of the curve whose coordinates both belong to ''K'' are called '''''K''-rational points'''.\n\n==Isogeny==\n{{Further|Isogeny}}\nLet ''E'' and ''D'' be elliptic curves over a field ''k''. An ''isogeny'' between ''E'' and ''D'' is a [[finite morphism]] ''f'' : ''E'' → ''D'' of [[Abelian variety|varieties]] that preserves basepoints (in other words, maps the given point on ''E'' to that on ''D'').\n\nThe two curves are called ''isogenous'' if there is an isogeny between them. This is an [[equivalence relation]], [[symmetric|symmetry]] being due to the existence of the [[dual isogeny]]. Every isogeny is an algebraic [[homomorphism]] and thus induces homomorphisms of the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of the elliptic curves for ''k''-valued points.\n\n==Elliptic curves over finite fields==\n{{Further|arithmetic of abelian varieties}}\n\n[[File:Elliptic curve on Z61.svg|thumb|right|275px|Set of affine points of elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x'' over finite field '''F'''<sub>61</sub>.]]\n\nLet ''K'' = '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> be the [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements and ''E'' an elliptic curve defined over ''K''. While the precise [[Counting points on elliptic curves|number of rational points of an elliptic curve]] ''E'' over ''K'' is in general rather difficult to compute, [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]] gives us, including the point at infinity, the following estimate:\n:<math>|\\# E(K) - (q + 1) | \\le 2\\sqrt{q}</math>\n\nIn other words, the number of points of the curve grows roughly as the number of elements in the field. This fact can be understood and proven with the help of some general theory; see [[local zeta function]], [[Étale cohomology]].\n\n[[File:Elliptic curve on Z89.svg|thumb|left|275px|Set of affine points of elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x'' over finite field '''F'''<sub>89</sub>.]]\n\nThe set of points ''E''('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) is a finite abelian group. It is always cyclic or the product of two cyclic groups.{{explain|date=September 2017}} For example,<ref>See {{Harvard citations|last=Koblitz|year=1994|nb=yes|loc=p. 158}}</ref> the curve defined by\n:<math>y^2 = x^3 - x</math>\n\nover '''F'''<sub>71</sub> has 72 points (71 [[Affine space#Affine_coordinates|affine points]] including (0,0) and one [[point at infinity]]) over this field, whose group structure is given by '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × '''Z'''/36'''Z'''. The number of points on a specific curve can be computed with [[Schoof's algorithm]].\n\nStudying the curve over the [[field extension]]s of '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> is facilitated by the introduction of the local zeta function of ''E'' over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, defined by a generating series (also see above)\n:<math>Z(E(K), T) \\equiv \\exp \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\# \\left[E(K_n)\\right] {T^n\\over n} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere the field ''K<sub>n</sub>'' is the (unique up to isomorphism) extension of ''K'' = '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> of degree ''n'' (that is,  '''F'''<sub>''q<sup>n</sup>''</sub>). The zeta function is a rational function in ''T''. There is an integer ''a'' such that\n\n:<math>Z(E(K), T) = \\frac{1 - aT + qT^2}{(1 - qT)(1 - T)}</math>\n\nMoreover,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  Z \\left(E(K), \\frac{1}{qT} \\right) &= Z(E(K), T)\\\\\n         \\left(1 - aT + qT^2 \\right) &= (1 - \\alpha T)(1 - \\beta T)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwith complex numbers α, β of [[absolute value]] <math>\\sqrt{q}</math>. This result is a special case of the [[Weil conjectures]]. For example,<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Koblitz|year=1994|nb=yes|loc=p. 160}}</ref> the zeta function of ''E'' : ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''y'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup> over the field '''F'''<sub>2</sub> is given by\n:<math>\\frac{1 + 2T^2}{(1 - T)(1 - 2T)}</math>\n\nthis follows from:\n:<math> \\left| E(\\mathbf{F}_{2^r}) \\right| = \\begin{cases} 2^r + 1 & r \\text{ odd} \\\\ 2^r + 1 - 2(-2)^{\\frac{r}{2}} & r \\text{ even} \\end{cases} </math>\n\n[[File:Elliptic curve on Z71.svg|thumb|right|350px|Set of affine points of elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x'' over finite field '''F'''<sub>71</sub>.]]\n\nThe [[Sato–Tate conjecture]] is a statement about how the error term <math>2\\sqrt{q}</math> in Hasse's theorem varies with the different primes ''q'', if an elliptic curve E over '''Q''' is reduced modulo q. It was proven (for almost all such curves) in 2006 due to the results of Taylor, Harris and Shepherd-Barron,<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Harris |first2=N. |last2=Shepherd-Barron |first3=R. |last3=Taylor |title=A family of Calabi–Yau varieties and potential automorphy |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=171 |issue=2 |pages=779–813|year=2010 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.779 }}</ref> and says that the error terms are equidistributed.\n\nElliptic curves over finite fields are notably applied in [[cryptography]] and for the [[factorization]] of large integers. These algorithms often make use of the group structure on the points of ''E''. Algorithms that are applicable to general groups, for example the group of invertible elements in finite fields, '''F'''*<sub>''q''</sub>, can thus be applied to the group of points on an elliptic curve. For example, the [[discrete logarithm]] is such an algorithm. The interest in this is that choosing an elliptic curve allows for more flexibility than choosing ''q'' (and thus the group of units in '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>). Also, the group structure of elliptic curves is generally more complicated.\n<!--{{Voir aussi|Factorisation en courbe elliptique de Lenstra|Cryptologie sur les courbes elliptiques|Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm}}-->\n\n==Applications==\n* [[Elliptic curve cryptography]]\n\n==Algorithms that use elliptic curves==\nElliptic curves over finite fields are used in some [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications as well as for [[integer factorization]].

Weil also suggested that the conductor was equal to the level of a modular form corresponding to the elliptic curve.\n\n{{harvtxt|Serre|Tate|1968}} extended the theory to conductors of abelian varieties.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''E'' be an elliptic curve defined over a [[local field]] ''K'' and '''p''' the prime ideal of the [[ring of integers]] of ''K''.  We consider a ''minimal equation'' for ''E'': a generalised [[Weierstrass equation]] whose coefficients are '''p'''-integral and with the valuation of the discriminant ν<sub>'''p'''</sub>(Δ) as small as possible.  If the discriminant is a '''p'''-unit then ''E'' has ''good reduction'' at '''p''' and the exponent of the conductor is zero.\n\nWe can write the exponent ''f'' of the conductor as a sum ε + δ of two terms, corresponding to the tame and wild ramification. The tame ramification part ε is defined in terms of the reduction type: ε=0 for good reduction, ε=1 for multiplicative reduction and ε=2 for additive reduction. The wild ramification term δ is zero unless '''p''' divides 2 or 3, and in the latter cases it is defined in terms of the [[wild ramification]] of the extensions of ''K'' by the [[division point]]s of ''E'' by Serre's formula\n:<math>\\delta = \\dim_{Z/lZ} \\text {Hom}_{Z_l[G]}(P, M).</math>\nHere ''M'' is the group of points on the elliptic curve of order ''l'' for a prime ''l'', ''P'' is the [[Swan representation]], and ''G'' the Galois group of a finite extension of ''K'' such that the points of ''M'' are defined over it (so that ''G'' acts on ''M'')\n\n==Ogg's formula==\nThe exponent of the conductor is related to other invariants of the elliptic curve by Ogg's formula:\n\n:<math>f_\\mathbf{p} = \\nu_\\mathbf{p} ( \\Delta ) + 1 - n \\ , </math>\nwhere ''n'' is the number of components (without counting multiplicities) of the singular fibre of the [[Néron minimal model]] for E. (This is sometimes used as a definition of the conductor).\n\nOgg's original proof used a lot of case by case checking, especially in characteristics 2 and 3. {{harvtxt|Saito|1988}} gave a uniform proof and generalized Ogg's formula to more general arithmetic surfaces.\n\nWe can also describe ε in terms of the valuation of the [[j-invariant]] ν<sub>'''p'''</sub>(''j''): it is 0 in the case of good reduction; otherwise it is 1 if ν<sub>'''p'''</sub>(''j'') < 0 and 2 if ν<sub>'''p'''</sub>(''j'') ≥ 0.\n\n==Global conductor==\nLet ''E'' be an elliptic curve defined over a number field ''K''.  The global conductor is the ideal given by the product over primes of ''K''\n\n:<math> f(E) = \\prod_\\mathbf{p} \\mathbf{p}^{f_\\mathbf{p}} \\ . </math>\n\nThis is a finite product as the primes of bad reduction are contained in the set of primes divisors of the discriminant of any model for ''E'' with global integral coefficients.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book\n | first=John | last=Cremona  \n | year = 1997 | edition=2nd\n | title = Algorithms for Modular Elliptic Curves\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | url = http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona//book/fulltext/index.html\n | isbn=0-521-59820-6\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | first=Dale | last=Husemöller\n | year = 2004\n | title = Elliptic Curves\n | edition = 2nd\n | series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics\n | volume=111\n | publisher = Springer\n | isbn=0-387-95490-2\n }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Néron | first1=André | author1-link=André Néron | title=Modèles minimaux des variétés abéliennes sur les corps locaux et globaux | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1964__21__5_0 | mr=0179172 | zbl=0132.41403 | year=1964 | journal=[[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]] | issn=1618-1913 | volume=21 | pages=5–128 | doi=10.1007/BF02684271 | language=French }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ogg | first1=A.

Similarly, 6 is a congruent number because it is the area of a (3,4,5) triangle. 3 is not a congruent number.\n\nIf {{mvar|q}} is a congruent number then {{math|''s''<sup>2</sup>''q''}} is also a congruent number for any natural number {{mvar|s}} (just by multiplying each side of the triangle by {{mvar|s}}), and vice versa.  This leads to the observation that whether a nonzero rational number {{mvar|q}} is a congruent number depends only on its residue in the [[group (mathematics)|group]]\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{Q}^{*}/\\mathbb{Q}^{*2}</math>.\n\nEvery residue class in this group contains exactly one [[square-free integer]], and it is common, therefore, only to consider square-free positive integers, when speaking about congruent numbers.\n\n==Congruent number problem==\nThe question of determining whether a given rational number is a congruent number is called the '''congruent number problem'''.  This problem has not (as of 2019) been brought to a successful resolution. [[Tunnell's theorem]] provides an easily testable criterion for determining whether a number is congruent; but his result relies on the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], which is still unproven.\n\n[[Fermat's right triangle theorem]], named after [[Pierre de Fermat]], states that no [[square number]] can be a congruent number.

A calculation shows these three numbers\nsatisfy the two equations for {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} above.\n\nThese two correspondences between ({{mvar|a}},{{mvar|b}},{{mvar|c}}) and ({{mvar|x}},{{mvar|y}}) are inverses of each other, so\nwe have a one-to-one correspondence between any solution of the two equations in\n{{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} and any solution of the equation in {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} with {{mvar|y}} nonzero.   In particular,\nfrom the formulas in the two correspondences, for rational {{mvar|n}} we see that {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are\nrational if and only if the corresponding {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are rational, and vice versa.\n(We also have that {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are all positive if and only if {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive;\nnotice from the equation {{math|''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> - ''xn''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''(''x''<sup>2</sup> - ''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}\nthat if {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are positive then {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> - ''n''<sup>2</sup>}} must be positive, so the formula for\n{{mvar|a}} above is positive.)\n\nThus a positive rational number {{mvar|n}} is congruent if and only if the equation\n{{math|''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> - ''n''<sup>2</sup>''x''}} has a [[rational point]] with {{mvar|y}} not equal to 0.\nIt can be shown (as a nice application of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] on primes in arithmetic progression)\nthat the only torsion points on this elliptic curve are those with {{mvar|y}} equal to 0, hence the\nexistence of a rational point with {{mvar|y}} nonzero is equivalent to saying the elliptic curve has positive rank.\n\n\nAnother approach to solving is to start with integer value of n denoted as N and solve \n\n:<math>N^2=ed^2+e^2</math>\n\nwhere \n\n:<math>\n\t\\begin{matrix}\n            c&=&n^2/e+e\\\\\n            a&=&2n\\\\\n            b&=&n^2/e-e\n         \\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\n==Current progress==\nMuch work has been done classifying congruent numbers.\n\nFor example, it is known<ref>{{citation |author=[[Paul Monsky]] |title=Mock Heegner Points and Congruent Numbers |journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift |volume=204 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=45–67 |doi=10.1007/BF02570859}}</ref> that for  a prime number {{mvar|p}}, the following holds:\n*if {{math|''p'' ≡ 3 ([[modular arithmetic|mod]] 8)}}, then {{mvar|p}} is not a congruent number, but 2{{mvar|p}} is a congruent number.\n*if {{math|''p'' ≡ 5 (mod 8)}}, then {{mvar|p}} is a congruent number.\n*if {{math|''p'' ≡ 7 (mod 8)}}, then {{mvar|p}} and 2{{mvar|p}} are congruent numbers.\n\nIt is also known<ref>{{citation\n | last = Tian | first = Ye | authorlink = Tian Ye (mathematician)\n | arxiv = 1210.8231\n | doi = 10.4310/CJM.2014.v2.n1.a4\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Cambridge Journal of Mathematics\n | mr = 3272014\n | pages = 117–161\n | title = Congruent numbers and Heegner points\n | volume = 2\n | year = 2014}}.</ref> that in each of the congruence classes {{math|5, 6, 7 (mod 8)}}, for any given {{mvar|k}} there are infinitely many square-free congruent numbers with {{mvar|k}} prime factors.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |last=Alter |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Alter |title=The Congruent Number Problem |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=87 |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=43–45 |doi=10.2307/2320381 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |jstor=2320381}}\n*{{citation |doi=10.1007/BF02837344 |last=Chandrasekar |first=V. |title=The Congruent Number Problem |journal=Resonance |volume=3 |issue=8 |year=1998 |pages=33–45 |url=http://www.math.rug.nl/~top/Chandrasekar.pdf}}\n*{{citation |last=Dickson |first=Leonard Eugene |authorlink=Leonard Eugene Dickson |title=[[History of the Theory of Numbers]] |volume=Volume II: Diophantine Analysis |date=2005 |series=Dover Books on Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-44233-4 |chapter=Chapter XVI}} - see, for a history of the problem.\n*{{citation |last=Guy |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard K.

There have been several approaches to do so, and the [[algorithms]] devised have proved to be useful tools in the study of various fields such as [[number theory]], and more recently in [[cryptography]] and Digital Signature Authentication (See [[elliptic curve cryptography]] and [[elliptic curve DSA]]). While in number theory they have important consequences in the solving of [[Diophantine equations]], with respect to cryptography, they enable us to make effective use of the difficulty of the [[discrete logarithm problem]] (DLP) for the group <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math>, of elliptic curves over a [[finite field]] <math>\\mathbb{F}_q</math>, where ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''k''</sup> and ''p'' is a prime. The DLP, as it has come to be known, is a widely used approach to [[public key cryptography]], and the difficulty in solving this problem determines the [[level of security]] of the cryptosystem.  This article covers algorithms to count points on elliptic curves over fields of large characteristic, in  particular ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;3. For curves over fields of small characteristic more efficient algorithms based on ''p''-adic methods exist.\n\n==Approaches to counting points on elliptic curves==\n\nThere are several approaches to the problem. Beginning with the naive approach, we trace the developments up to Schoof's definitive work on the subject, while also listing the improvements to Schoof's algorithm made by Elkies (1990) and Atkin (1992).\n\nSeveral algorithms make use of the fact that groups of the form <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math> are subject to an important theorem due to Hasse, that bounds the number of points to be considered. The [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves|Hasse's theorem]] states that if ''E'' is an elliptic curve over the finite field <math>\\mathbb{F}_q</math>, then the [[cardinality]] of <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math> satisfies\n\n:<math>\n||E(\\mathbb{F}_q)| - (q+1)| \\leq 2 \\sqrt{q}. \\, \n</math>\n\n==Naive approach==\n\nThe naive approach to counting points, which is the least sophisticated, involves running through all the elements of the field <math>\\mathbb{F}_q</math> and testing which ones satisfy the Weierstrass form of the elliptic curve\n\n:<math> \ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B. \\, \n</math>\n\n===Example===\nLet ''E'' be the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1 over <math>\\mathbb{F}_5</math>. To count points on ''E'', we make a\nlist of the possible values of ''x'', then of the [[quadratic residues]] of x mod 5 (for lookup purpose only), then of ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1 mod 5, then of ''y'' of ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1 mod 5. This yields the points on ''E''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! <math>x</math>\n! <math>x^2</math>\n! <math>x^3 + x + 1</math>\n! <math>y</math>\n! Points\n|-\n| <math> \\quad 0</math>\n| <math>0</math>\n| <math>1</math>\n| <math>1, 4</math>\n| <math>(0, 1), (0, 4)</math>\n|-\n| <math> \\quad 1</math>\n| <math>1</math>\n| <math>3</math>\n| <math>-</math>\n| <math>-</math>\n|-\n| <math> \\quad 2</math>\n| <math>4</math>\n| <math>1</math>\n| <math>1, 4</math>\n| <math>(2, 1), (2, 4)</math>\n|-\n| <math> \\quad 3</math>\n| <math>4</math>\n| <math>1</math>\n| <math>1, 4</math>\n| <math>(3, 1), (3, 4)</math>\n|-\n| <math> \\quad 4</math>\n| <math>1</math>\n| <math>4</math>\n| <math>2, 3</math>\n| <math>(4, 2), (4, 3)</math>\n|-\n|}\n\nE.g. the last row is computed as follows: If you insert <math>x = 4</math> in the equation <math>y^2 = x^3 + x + 1</math> you get <math>4</math> as result (3rd column). This result can be achieved if <math>y = 2, 3</math> ([[Quadratic residues]] can be looked up in the 2nd column). So the points for the last row are <math>(4, 2), (4, 3)</math>.\n\nTherefore, <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_5)</math> has [[cardinality]] of 9: the 8 points listed before and the point at infinity.\n\nThis algorithm requires running time ''O''(''q''), because all the values of <math>x \\in \\mathbb{F}_q</math> must be considered.\n\n==Baby-step giant-step==\n \nAn improvement in running time is obtained using a different approach: we pick an element <math>P=(x,y) \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math> by selecting random values of <math>x</math> until <math>x^3 + Ax +B</math> is a square in <math>\\mathbb{F}_q</math> and then computing the square root of this value in order to get <math>y</math>.\nHasse's theorem tells us that <math>|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|</math> lies in the interval <math>(q +1 - 2 \\sqrt{q}, q + 1 + 2 \\sqrt{q})</math>. Thus, by [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], finding a unique <math>M</math> lying in this interval and satisfying <math>MP=O</math>, results in finding the cardinality of <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math>. The algorithm fails if there exist two integers <math>M</math> and <math>M'</math> in the interval such that <math>MP = M'P = O</math>. In such a case it usually suffices to repeat the algorithm with another randomly chosen point in <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math>.\n\nTrying all values of <math>M</math> in order to find the one that satisfies <math>MP=O</math> takes around <math>4 \\sqrt{q}</math> steps.\n \nHowever, by applying the [[baby-step giant-step]] algorithm to <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math>, we are able to speed this up to around <math>4 \\sqrt[4]{q}</math> steps. The algorithm is as follows.\n\n===The algorithm===\n\n 1. choose <math>m</math> integer, <math>m > \\sqrt[4]{q}</math>\n 2. '''FOR'''{<math>j=0</math> to <math>m</math>} '''DO''' \n 3.    <math>P_j \\leftarrow jP</math>\n 4. '''ENDFOR'''\n 5. <math>L \\leftarrow 1</math>\n 6. <math>Q \\leftarrow (q+1)P</math>\n 7.

'''IF''' <math>\\frac{M}{p_i}P=O</math>\n 13.       '''THEN''' <math>M \\leftarrow \\frac{M}{p_i}</math>\n 14.       '''ELSE''' <math>i \\leftarrow i+1</math> \n 15.    '''ENDIF'''\n 16.

'''ENDWHILE'''\n 21. '''RETURN''' <math>N</math>     \\\\it is the cardinality of <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math>\n\n===Notes to the algorithm===\n \n* In line 8. we assume the existence of a match. Indeed, the following lemma assures that such a match exists:\n\n::Let <math>a</math> be an integer with <math>|a| \\leq 2m^2</math>. There exist integers <math>a_0</math> and <math>a_1</math> with\n::<math>\n-m < a_0 \\leq m \\mbox{ and } -m \\leq a_1 \\leq m \\mbox{ s.t. } a = a_0 + 2ma_1.\n</math>\n      \n* Computing <math>(j+1)P</math> once <math>jP</math> has been computed can be done by adding <math>P</math> to <math>jP</math> instead of computing the complete scalar multiplication anew. The complete computation thus requires <math>m</math> additions. <math>2mP</math> can be obtained with one doubling from <math>mP</math>. The computation of <math>Q</math> requires <math>\\log (q+1)</math> doublings and <math>w</math> additions, where <math>w</math> is the number of nonzero digits in the binary representation of <math>q+1</math>; note that knowledge of the <math>jP</math> and <math>2mP</math> allows us to reduce the number of doublings. Finally, to get from <math>Q+k(2mP)</math> to <math>Q+(k+1)(2mP)</math>, simply add <math>2mP</math> rather than recomputing everything.\n* We are assuming that we can factor <math>M</math>. If not, we can at least find all the small prime factors <math>p_i</math> and check that <math>\\frac{M}{p_i} \\neq O</math> for these. Then <math>M</math> will be a good candidate for the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of <math>P</math>.\n* The conclusion of step 17 can be proved using elementary group theory: since <math>MP=O</math>, the order of <math>P</math> divides <math>M</math>. If no proper divisor <math>\\bar{M}</math> of <math>M</math> realizes <math>\\bar{M}P=O</math>, then <math>M</math> is the order of <math>P</math>.\n\nOne drawback of this method is that there is a need for too much memory when the group becomes large. In order to address this, it might be more efficient to store only the <math>x</math> coordinates of the points <math>jP</math> (along with the corresponding integer <math>j</math>). However, this leads to an extra scalar multiplication in order to choose between <math>-j</math> and <math>+j</math>.\n\nThere are other generic algorithms for computing the order of a group element that are more space efficient, such as [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard's rho algorithm]] and the [[Pollard kangaroo]] method. The Pollard kangaroo method allows one to search for a solution in a prescribed interval, yielding a running time of <math>O(\\sqrt[4]{q})</math>, using <math>O(\\log^2{q})</math> space.\n\n==Schoof's algorithm==\n{{main|Schoof's algorithm}}\n\nA theoretical breakthrough for the problem of computing the cardinality of groups of the type <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</math> was achieved by René Schoof, who, in 1985, published the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm. Central to Schoof's algorithm are the use of [[division polynomial]]s and [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves|Hasse's theorem]], along with the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].\n\nSchoof's insight exploits the fact that, by Hasse's theorem, there is a finite range of possible values for <math>|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|</math>. It suffices to compute <math>|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|</math> modulo an integer <math>N > 4\\sqrt{q}</math>.  This is achieved by computing <math>|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|</math> modulo primes <math>\\ell_1, \\ldots, \\ell_s</math> whose product exceeds <math>4 \\sqrt{q}</math>, and then applying the Chinese remainder theorem.  The key to the algorithm is using the division polynomial <math>\\psi_{\\ell}</math> to efficiently compute <math>|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|</math> modulo <math>\\ell</math>.\n\nThe running time of Schoof's Algorithm is polynomial in <math>n=\\log{q}</math>, with an asymptotic complexity of <math>O(n^2M(n^3)/\\log{n})=O(n^{5+o(1)})</math>, where <math>M(n)</math> denotes the [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations|complexity of integer multiplication]].  Its space complexity is <math>O(n^3)</math>.\n\n==Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm==\n{{Main|Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Noam Elkies]], followed by [[A. O. L. Atkin]] devised improvements to Schoof's basic algorithm by making a distinction among the primes <math>\\ell_1, \\ldots, \\ell_s</math> that are used.  A prime <math>\\ell</math> is called an Elkies prime if the characteristic equation of the Frobenius endomorphism, <math>\\phi^2-t\\phi+ q = 0</math>, splits over <math>\\mathbb{F}_\\ell</math>.  Otherwise <math>\\ell</math> is called an Atkin prime.  Elkies primes are the key to improving the asymptotic complexity of Schoof's algorithm.  Information obtained from the Atkin primes permits a further improvement which is asymptotically negligible but can be quite important in practice.  The modification of Schoof's algorithm to use Elkies and Atkin primes is known as the Schoof–Elkies–Atkin (SEA) algorithm.\n\nThe status of a particular prime <math>\\ell</math> depends on the elliptic curve <math>E/\\mathbb{F}_q</math>, and can be determined using the [[Classical modular curve|modular polynomial]] <math>\\Psi_\\ell(X,Y)</math>.  If the univariate polynomial <math>\\Psi_\\ell(X,j(E))</math> has a root in <math>\\mathbb{F}_q</math>, where <math>j(E)</math> denotes the [[j-invariant]] of <math>E</math>, then <math>\\ell</math> is an Elkies prime, and otherwise it is an Atkin prime.  In the Elkies case, further computations involving modular polynomials are used to obtain a proper factor of the division polynomial <math>\\psi_\\ell</math>.  The degree of this factor is <math>O(\\ell)</math>, whereas <math>\\psi_\\ell</math> has degree <math>O(\\ell^2)</math>.\n\nUnlike Schoof's algorithm, the SEA algorithm is typically implemented as a [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic algorithm]] (of the [[Las Vegas algorithm|Las Vegas]] type), so that root-finding and other operations can be performed more efficiently.  Its computational complexity is dominated by the cost of computing the modular polynomials <math>\\Psi_\\ell(X,Y)</math>, but as these do not depend on <math>E</math>, they may be computed once and reused.  Under the heuristic assumption that there are sufficiently many small Elkies primes, and excluding the cost of computing modular polynomials, the asymptotic running time of the SEA algorithm is <math>O(n^2 M(n^2)/\\log{n}) = O(n^{4+o(1)})</math>, where <math>n=\\log{q}</math>.  Its space complexity is <math>O(n^3\\log{n})</math>, but when precomputed modular polynomials are used this increases to <math>O(n^4)</math>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Schoof's algorithm]]\n* [[Elliptic curve cryptography]]\n* [[Baby-step giant-step]]\n* [[Public key cryptography]]\n* [[Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm]]\n* [[Pollard rho]]\n* [[Pollard kangaroo]]\n* [[Elliptic curve primality proving]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* I.

It is a special case of [[Weierstrass form]] and it is also important in [[elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic-curve cryptography]] because the doubling speeds up considerably (computing as composition of 2-[[isogeny]] and its [[dual abelian variety|dual]]). \nIt has been introduced by Christophe Doche, Thomas Icart, and David R. Kohel in ''Efficient Scalar Multiplication by Isogeny Decompositions.''<ref>Christophe Doche, Thomas Icart, and David R.

In general, the group law is defined in the following way: if three points lies in the same line then they sum up to zero. So, by this property, the group laws are different for every curve shape.\n\nIn this case, since these curves are special cases of Weierstrass curves, the addition is just the standard addition on Weierstrass curves. On the other hand, to double a point, the standard doubling formula can be used, but it would not be so fast.\nIn this case, the [[identity element|neutral element]] is <math> \\theta=(0:1:0) </math> (in projective coordinates), for which <math> \\theta=-\\theta </math>.

The concept of elliptic curves over [[finite fields]] is widely used in [[elliptic curve cryptography]]. Applications of Edwards curves to [[cryptography]] were developed by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] and [[Tanja Lange]]: they pointed out several advantages of the Edwards form in comparison to the more well known [[elliptic curve|Weierstrass form]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe equation of an Edwards curve over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' which does not\nhave [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic 2]] is:\n\n: <math> x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2 \\, </math>\n\nfor some [[scalar field|scalar]] <math>d\\in K\\setminus\\{0,1\\}</math>.\nAlso the following form with parameters ''c'' and ''d'' is called an Edwards curve:\n\n: <math> x^2 + y^2 = c^2(1 + dx^2 y^2) \\, </math>\n\nwhere ''c'',&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''K'' with ''cd''(1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''c''<sup>4</sup>·''d'')&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0.\n\nEvery Edwards curve is [[birationally equivalent]] to an elliptic curve in [[elliptic curve|Weierstrass form]], and thus admits an algebraic group law once one chooses a point to serve as a neutral element.  If ''K'' is finite, then a sizeable fraction of all elliptic curves over ''K'' can be written as Edwards curves.\nOften elliptic curves in Edwards form are defined having c=1, without loss of generality. In the following sections, it is assumed that c=1.\n\n==The group law==\n(See also [[elliptic curve#The group law|Weierstrass curve group law]])\n\nThe points on an elliptic curve form an abelian group: one can add points and take integer multiples of a single point. When an elliptic curve is described by a non-singular cubic equation, then the sum of two points ''P'' and ''Q'', denoted ''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''Q'', is directly related to third point of intersection between the curve and the line that passes through ''P'' and ''Q''. But for higher degree singular curves, such as Edwards curves, the situation is somewhat more complicated. For a geometric explanation of the addition law on Edwards curves, see\n\"Faster Computation of the Tate Pairing\" by Arene et al.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/155|title=Faster Computation of the Tate Pairing|author=Christophe Arene |author2=Tanja Lange |author3=Michael Naehrig |author4=Christophe Ritzenthaler|year=2009|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Edwards addition law===\n\nOn any elliptic curve, by which is meant a curve of genus 1 and a point selected to serve the neutral element, the sum of two points is given by a rational expression of the coordinates of the points, although in general one may need to use several formulas to cover all possible pairs. For the Edwards curve, taking the [[identity element|neutral element]] to be the point&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;1), the sum of the points (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) is given by the formula\n\n:<math> (x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = \\left( \\frac{x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1}{1 + dx_1 x_2 y_1 y_2}, \\frac{y_1 y_2 - x_1 x_2}{1 - dx_1 x_2 y_1 y_2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2}{x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2}, \\frac{x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2}{x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2} \\right) \\, </math>\n\nThe inverse of any point (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) is (−''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>). One can check that the point (0,&nbsp;−1) has order&nbsp;2, and that the points \n(±1,0) have order&nbsp;4. In particular, an Edwards curve always has a point of order&nbsp;4 with coordinates in ''K''.\n\nIf ''d is not a square'' in ''K'' and <math> (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2) \\in \\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2=1+d x^2 y^2 \\} </math>, then there are no exceptional points: the denominators 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''dx''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>2</sub> and 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''dx''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>2</sub> are always nonzero. Therefore, the Edwards addition law is complete when ''d'' is not a square in ''K''. This means that the formulas work for all pairs of input points on the Edwards curve with no exceptions for doubling, no exception for the neutral element, no exception for negatives, etc.<ref name = \"Daniel. J Bernstein , Tanja Lange\">Daniel. J. Bernstein , Tanja Lange, pag. 3, '' Faster addition and doubling on elliptic curves''</ref> In other words, it is defined for all pairs of input points on the Edwards curve over ''K'' and the result gives the sum of the input points.\n\nIf ''d is a square'' in ''K'', then the same operation can have exceptional points, i.e. there can be pairs (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) where 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''dx''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''dx''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nOne of the attractive feature of the Edwards Addition law is that it is strongly ''unified'' i.e. it can also be used to double a point, simplifying protection against [[side-channel attack]]. The addition formula above is faster than other unified formulas and has the strong property of completeness<ref name = \"Daniel. J Bernstein , Tanja Lange\"/>\n\n'''Example of addition law ''':\n\nConsider the elliptic curve in the Edwards form with ''d''=2\n\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2 x^2 y^2</math>\n\nand the point <math>P_1=(1,0)</math> on it. It is possible to prove that the sum of ''P''<sub>1</sub> with the neutral element (0,1) gives again P<sub>1</sub>. Indeed, using the formula given above, the coordinates of the point given by this sum are:\n\n:<math>x_3 = \\frac{x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2}{1 + dx_1 x_2 y_1 y_2} = 1</math>\n\n:<math>y_3 = \\frac{y_1 y_2 - x_1 x_2}{1 - dx_1 x_2 y_1 y_2} = 0</math>\n\n===An analogue on the circle===\n[[File:Edwards Curve,Clock group diagram.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Clock group]]\nTo understand better the concept of \"addition\" of points on a curve, a nice example is given by the classical circle group:\n\ntake the circle of radius 1\n\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}x^2+y^2=1</math>\n\nand consider two points P<sub>1</sub>=(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>), P<sub>2</sub>=(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) on it. Let α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> be the angles such that:\n\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}P_{1}=(x_{1},y_{1})=(\\sin{\\alpha_{1}},\\cos{\\alpha_{1}})</math>\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}P_{2}=(x_{2},y_{2})=(\\sin{\\alpha_{2}},\\cos{\\alpha_{2}})</math>\n\nThe sum of P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> is, thus, given by the sum of \"their angles\". That is, the point P<sub>3</sub>=P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub> is a point on the circle with coordinates (x<sub>3</sub>,y<sub>3</sub>), where:\n\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}x_{3}=\\sin({\\alpha}_{1}+{\\alpha}_{2})=\\sin{\\alpha}_{1}\\cos{\\alpha}_{2}+\\sin{\\alpha}_{2}\\cos{\\alpha}_{1}=x_{1}y_{2}+x_{2}y_{1}</math>\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}y_{3}=\\cos({\\alpha}_{1}+{\\alpha}_{2})=\\cos{\\alpha}_{1}\\cos{\\alpha}_{2}-\\sin{\\alpha}_{1}\\sin{\\alpha}_{2}=y_{1}y_{2}-x_{1}x_{2}.</math>\n\nIn this way, the addition formula for points on the circle of radius 1 is:\n\n:<math>{\\displaystyle}(x_1,y_1)+(x_2,y_2) = (x_1y_2+x_2y_1,y_1y_2-x_1x_2)</math>.\n\n==Projective homogeneous coordinates==\nIn the context of cryptography, [[homogeneous coordinates]] are used to prevent [[elliptic curve cryptography|field inversions]] that appear in the affine formula. To avoid inversions in the original Edwards addition formulas, the curve equation can be written in [[projective space|projective coordinates]] as:\n\n<math>(X^2+Y^2)Z^2=Z^4+dX^2Y^2</math>.\n\nA projective point (''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Z''<sub>1</sub>) corresponds to the [[Affine space|affine point]] (''X''<sub>1</sub>/''Z''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''Y''<sub>1</sub>/''Z''<sub>1</sub>) on the Edwards curve.\n\nThe identity element is represented by (0&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1). The inverse of (''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Z''<sub>1</sub>) is (−''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Z''<sub>1</sub>).\n\nAn addition formula in projective homogeneous coordinates is given by: [these are clearly inadequate, since when P1 = P2 for point doubling, the result goes to X3 = 0, Y3 = 0, Z3 = 0]\n\n: (''X''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Y''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Z''<sub>3</sub>) = (''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Z''<sub>1</sub>) + (''X''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Y''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''Z''<sub>2</sub>)\n\nwhere\n\n: ''X''<sub>3</sub> = ''Z''<sub>1</sub>''Z''<sub>2</sub>(''X''<sub>1</sub>''Y''<sub>2</sub> − ''Y''<sub>1</sub>''X''<sub>2</sub>)(''X''<sub>1</sub>''Y''<sub>1</sub>''Z''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''Z''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>''X''<sub>2</sub>''Y''<sub>2</sub>)\n\n: Y<sub>3</sub> = Z<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>2</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + Y<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>)(X<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> − Z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>X<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>)\n\n: Z<sub>3</sub> = kZ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>Z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>(X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + Y<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>)(X<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub> − Y<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>) with ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/''c''.\n\n===Algorithm===\nUsing the following algorithm, X<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>3</sub>, Z<sub>3</sub> can be written as:\nX<sub>3</sub>→ GJ, Y<sub>3</sub>→ HK, Z<sub>3</sub>→ kJK.d\n\nwhere:\nA→ X<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>2</sub>,\n\nB→ Y<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>2</sub>,\n\nC→ Z<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>,\n\nD→ Z<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>,\n\nE→ AB,\n\nF→ CD,\n\nG→ E+F,\n\nH→ E-F,\n\nJ→ (A-C)(B+D)-H,\n\nK→ (A+D)(B+C)-G\n\n==Doubling==\n''Doubling'' can be performed with exactly the same formula as addition. Doubling refers to the case in which the inputs (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) are known to be equal. Since (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) is on the Edwards curve, one can substitute the coefficient by (''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)/''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>''y''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n2(x_1,y_1) & = (x_1,y_1)+(x_1,y_1) \\\\[6pt]\n2(x_1,y_1) & = \\left( \\frac{2x_1y_1}{1+dx_1^2y_1^2}, \\frac{y_1^2-x_1^2}{1-dx_1^2y_1^2} \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\left( \\frac{2x_1y_1}{x_1^2+y_1^2}, \\frac{y_1^2-x_1^2}{2-x_1^2-y_1^2} \\right)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis reduces the degree of the denominator from 4 to 2 which is reflected in faster doublings.\nA general addition in Edwards coordinates takes 10'''M'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1'''S'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1'''C'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1'''D'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;7'''a''' and doubling costs 3'''M'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4'''S'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3'''C'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;6'''a''' where '''M''' is field multiplications, '''S''' is field squarings, '''D''' is the cost of multiplying by a selectable curve parameter and '''a''' is field addition.\n\n;Example of doubling\n\nAs in the previous example for the addition law, consider the Edwards curve with d=2:\n\n<math>{\\displaystyle}x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2 x^2 y^2</math>\n\nand the point P<sub>1</sub>=(1,0). The coordinates of the point 2P<sub>1</sub> are:\n\n<math>x_3 = \\frac{2x_1y_1}{1+dx_1^2y_1^2} = 0</math>\n\n<math>y_3 = \\frac{y_1^2-x_1^2}{1-dx_1^2y_1^2} = -1</math>\n\nThe point obtained from doubling P<sub>1</sub> is thus P<sub>3</sub>=(0,-1).\n\n==Mixed Addition==\nMixed addition is the case when Z<sub>2</sub> is known to be 1. In such a case A=Z<sub>1</sub><sup>.</sup>Z<sub>2</sub> can be eliminated and the total cost reduces to 9'''M'''+1'''S'''+1'''C'''+1'''D'''+7'''a'''\n\n===Algorithm===\nA= Z<sub>1</sub><sup>.</sup>Z<sub>2</sub> // in other words, A= Z<sub>1</sub>\n\nB= Z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>\n\nC=X<sub>1</sub>.X<sub>2</sub>\n\nD=Y<sub>1</sub><sup>.</sup>Y<sub>2</sub>\n\nE=d<sup>.</sup>C<sup>.</sup>D\n\nF=B-E\n\nG=B+E\n\nX<sub>3</sub>= A<sup>.</sup>F((X<sub>I</sub>+Y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>.</sup>(X<sub>2</sub>+Y<sub>2</sub>)-C-D)\n\nY<sub>3</sub>= A<sup>.</sup>G<sup>.</sup>(D-C)\n\nZ<sub>3</sub>=C<sup>.</sup>F<sup>.</sup>G\n\n==Tripling==\n''Tripling'' can be done by first doubling the point and then adding the result to itself. By applying the curve equation as in doubling, we obtain\n\n: <math> 3(x_1,y_1) = \\left( \\frac{(x_1^2+ y_1^2) - (2 y_1)^2}{4(x_1^2-1)x_1^2 - (x_1^2-y_1^2)^2}x_1, \\frac{(x_1^2+ y_1^2) - 2(x_1 )^2}{-4 (y_1^2-1)y_1^2+(x_1^2-y_1^2)^2}y_1 \\right). \\, </math>\n\nThere are two sets of formulas for this operation in standard Edwards coordinates. The first one costs 9'''M'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4'''S''' while the second needs 7'''M'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;7'''S'''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''elliptic cohomology''' is a [[cohomology theory]] in the sense of [[algebraic topology]]. It is related to [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular forms]].\n\n==History and motivation==\nHistorically, elliptic cohomology arose from the study of [[elliptic genus|elliptic genera]]. It was known by Atiyah and Hirzebruch that if <math>S^1</math> acts smoothly and non-trivially on a spin manifold, then the index of the [[Dirac operator]] vanishes. In 1983, [[Edward Witten|Witten]] conjectured that in this situation the equivariant index of a certain twisted Dirac operator is at least constant. This led to certain other problems concerning <math>S^1</math>-actions on manifolds, which could be solved by Ochanine by the introduction of elliptic genera. In turn, Witten related these to (conjectural) index theory on [[free loop]] spaces. Elliptic cohomology, invented in its original form by Landweber, Stong and [[Douglas Ravenel|Ravenel]] in the late 1980s, was introduced to clarify certain issues with elliptic genera and provide a context for (conjectural) index theory of families of differential operators on free loop spaces. In some sense it can be seen as an approximation to the [[topological K-theory|K-theory]] of the free loop space.\n\n==Definitions and constructions==\nCall a cohomology theory <math>A^*</math> even periodic if <math>A^i = 0</math> for i odd and there is an invertible element <math>u\\in A^2</math>. These theories possess a [[complex orientation]], which gives a [[formal group law]]. A particularly rich source for formal group laws are [[elliptic curve]]s. A cohomology theory A with \n\n:<math>A^0 = R</math>\n\nis called ''elliptic'' if it is even periodic and its formal group law is isomorphic to a formal group law of an elliptic curve E over R. The usual construction of such elliptic cohomology theories uses the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]]. If the formal group law of E is Landweber exact, one can define an elliptic cohomology theory (on finite complexes) by\n\n: <math>A^*(X) = MU^*(X)\\otimes_{MU^*}R[u,u^{-1}]. \\, </math>\n\nFranke has identified the condition needed to fulfill Landweber exactness:\n\n# R needs to be flat over <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n# There is no irreducible component ''X'' of <math>\\text{Spec }R/pR</math>, where the fiber <math>E_x</math> is [[supersingular]] for every <math>x\\in X</math>\n\nThese conditions can be checked in many cases related to elliptic genera. Moreover, the conditions are fulfilled in the universal case in the sense that the map from the [[moduli stack]] of elliptic curves to the moduli stack of [[formal group]]s \n\n:<math>\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}\\to\\mathcal{M}_{fg}</math>\n\nis [[flat morphism|flat]]. This gives then a [[presheaf]] of cohomology theories over the site of affine [[scheme (algebraic geometry)|schemes]] flat over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. The desire to get a universal elliptic cohomology theory by taking global sections has led to the construction of the [[topological modular forms]].\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation |last=Franke |first=Jens |year=1992 |title=On the construction of elliptic cohomology |journal=[[Mathematische Nachrichten]] |volume=158 |issue=1 |pages=43–65 |doi=10.1002/mana.19921580104 }}.\n*{{Citation |last=Landweber |first=Peter S. |chapter=Elliptic genera: An introductory overview |editor1-first=P.

      "title": "Elliptic curve point multiplication",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication",
      "text": "'''Elliptic curve point multiplication''' is the operation of successively adding a point along an [[elliptic curve]] to itself repeatedly.  It is used in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] (ECC) as a means of producing a [[one-way function]].\nThe literature presents this operation as [[scalar multiplication]], thus the most common name is '''elliptic curve scalar multiplication''', as written in [[Hessian form of an elliptic curve]].\n\n==Basics==\nGiven a curve, ''E'', defined along some equation in a finite field (such as ''E'': {{math|''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}), point multiplication is defined as the repeated addition of a point along that curve.  Denote as {{math|''nP'' {{=}} ''P'' + ''P'' + ''P'' + … + ''P''}} for some scalar (integer) ''n'' and a point {{math|''P'' {{=}} (''x'', ''y'')}} that lies on the curve, ''E''. This type of curve is known as a Weierstrass curve.\n\nThe security of modern ECC depends on the intractability of determining ''n'' from {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''nP''}} given known values of ''Q'' and ''P'' if ''n'' is large (known as the \"elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem\"). This is because the addition of two points on an elliptic curve (or the addition of one point to itself) yields a third point on the elliptic curve whose location has no immediately obvious relationship to the locations of the first two, and repeating this many times over yields a point ''nP'' that may be essentially anywhere. Intuitively, this is not dissimilar to the fact that if you had a point ''P'' on a circle, adding 42.57 degrees to its angle may still be a point \"not too far\" from ''P'', but adding 1000 or 1001 times 42.57 degrees will yield a point that may be anywhere on the circle. Reverting this process, i.e., given ''Q=nP'' and ''P'' and determining ''n'' can therefore only be done by trying out all possible ''n''—an effort that is computationally intractable if ''n'' is large.\n\n==Point addition==\n\nWith 2 distinct points, ''P'' and ''Q'', addition is defined as the negation of the point resulting from the intersection of the curve, ''E'', and the straight line defined by the points ''P'' and ''Q'', giving the point, ''R''.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                    P + Q &= R \\\\\n  (x_p, y_p) + (x_q, y_q) &= (x_r, y_r)\n\\end{align}</math>.\n\nAssuming the elliptic curve, ''E'', is given by {{math|''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}, this can be calculated as:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\lambda &= \\frac{y_q - y_p}{x_q - x_p} \\\\\n      x_r &= \\lambda^2 - x_p - x_q \\\\\n      y_r &= \\lambda(x_p - x_r) - y_p \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\nThese equations are correct when neither point is the point at infinity, (0,0).  When adding the point at infinity to another point, the result is simply the other point.  This is important for the [[Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm|ECDSA verification algorithm]] where the hash value could be zero.\n\n===Point doubling===\nWhere the points ''P'' and ''Q'', are coincident (at the same coordinates), addition is similar, except that there is no well-defined straight line through ''P'' and ''Q'', so the operation is closed using limiting case, the tangent to the curve, ''E'', at ''P'' and ''Q''.\n\nThis is calculated as above, except with:\n:<math>\\lambda = \\frac{3x_p^2 + a}{2y_p}</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is from the defining equation of the curve, ''E'', above.\n\n==Point multiplication==\n\nThe straightforward way of computing a point multiplication is through repeated addition. However, this is a fully exponential approach to computing the multiplication.\n\n===Double-and-add===\nThe simplest method is the double-and-add method,<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last1=Hankerson|first1=Darrel|last2=Vanstone|first2=Scott|last3=Menezes|first3=Alfred|title=Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography|year=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-95273-X|series=Springer Professional Computing|doi=10.1007/b9764891}}</ref> similar to [[Exponentiation by squaring|multiply-and-square]] in modular exponentiation.  The algorithm works as follows:\n\nTo compute ''dP'', start with the binary representation for ''d'': <math>\\scriptstyle d ~=~ d_0 \\,+\\, 2d_1 \\,+\\, 2^2d_2 \\,+\\, \\cdots \\,+\\, 2^md_m</math>, where [<math>\\scriptstyle d_0  ~..~  d_m</math>] ∈ {0,1}\n\nThere are two possible iterative algorithms.\n\nIterative algorithm, index increasing:\n\n   N ← P\n   Q ← 0\n   for i from 0 to m do\n      if d<sub>i</sub> = 1 then\n          Q ← point_add(Q, N)\n      N ← point_double(N)\n   return ''Q''\n\nIterative algorithm, index decreasing:\n\n   Q ← 0\n   for i from m down to 0 do\n      Q ← point_double(Q)\n      if d<sub>i</sub> = 1 then\n          Q ← point_add(Q, P)\n   return ''Q''\n\nAn alternative way of writing the above as a recursive function is\n\n   f(P, n) is\n      if n = 0 then\n          return 0                        # computation complete\n      else if n = 1 then\n          return P\n      else if n mod 2 = 1 then\n         return point_add(P, f(P, n - 1)) # addition when n is odd\n      else\n         return f(point_double(P), n/2)   # doubling when n is even\n\nwhere f is the function for doubling, P is the coordinate to double, n is the number of times to double the coordinate. Example: 100P can be written as {{nowrap|2(2[P + 2(2[2(P + 2P)])])}} and thus requires six doublings and two additions. 100P would be equal to f(P, 100).\n\nThis algorithm requires log<sub>2</sub>(''d'') iterations of point doubling and addition to compute the full-point multiplication.  There are many variations of this algorithm such as using a window, sliding window, NAF, NAF-w, vector chains, and Montgomery ladder.\n\n===Windowed method===\nIn the windowed version of this algorithm,<ref name=\"guide\"/> one selects a window size ''w'' and computes all <math>\\scriptstyle 2^w</math> values of <math>\\scriptstyle dP</math> for <math>\\scriptstyle d ~=~ 0,\\, 1,\\, 2,\\, \\dots,\\, 2^w \\,-\\, 1</math>.  The algorithm now uses the representation <math>\\scriptstyle d ~=~ d_0 \\,+\\, 2^wd_1 \\,+\\, 2^{2w}d_2 \\,+\\, \\cdots \\,+\\, 2^{mw}d_m</math> and becomes\n\n   Q ← 0\n   for i from m to 0 do\n       Q ← point_double_repeat(Q, w)\n       if d<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0 then\n           Q ← point_add(Q, d<sub>i</sub>P) # using pre-computed value of d<sub>i</sub>P\n   return Q\n\nThis algorithm has the same complexity as the double-and-add approach with the benefit of using fewer point additions (which in practice are slower than doubling).  Typically, the value of ''w'' is chosen to be fairly small making the [[pre-computation]] stage a trivial component of the algorithm.  For the NIST recommended curves, <math>\\scriptstyle w ~=~ 4</math> is usually the best selection.  The entire complexity for a ''n''-bit number is measured as <math>\\scriptstyle n \\,+\\, 1</math> point doubles and <math>\\scriptstyle 2^w \\,-\\, 2 \\,+\\, \\frac{n}{w}</math> point additions.\n\n===Sliding-window method===\nIn the sliding-window version, we look to trade off point additions for point doubles.  We compute a similar table as in the windowed version except we only compute the points <math>\\scriptstyle dP</math> for <math>\\scriptstyle d ~=~ 2^{w-1},\\, 2^{w-1} \\,+\\, 1,\\, \\dots,\\, 2^w \\,-\\, 1</math>.  Effectively, we are only computing the values for which the most significant bit of the window is set.  The algorithm then uses the original double-and-add representation of <math>\\scriptstyle d ~=~ d_0 \\,+\\, 2d_1 \\,+\\, 2^2d_2 \\,+\\, \\cdots \\,+\\, 2^md_m</math>.\n\n   Q ← 0\n   for i from m downto 0 do\n      if d<sub>i</sub> = 0 then\n         Q ← point_double(Q)\n      else \n         t ← extract j (up to w − 1) additional bits from d (including d<sub>i</sub>)\n         i ← i − j\n         if j < w then\n            Perform double-and-add using t \n            return Q\n         else \n            Q ← point_double_repeat(Q, w)\n            Q ← point_add(Q, tP)\n   return Q\n\nThis algorithm has the benefit that the pre-computation stage is roughly half as complex as the normal windowed method while also trading slower point additions for point doublings.  In effect, there is little reason to use the windowed method over this approach, except that the former can be implemented in constant time.  The algorithm requires <math>\\scriptstyle w \\,-\\, 1 \\,+\\, n</math> point doubles and at most <math>\\scriptstyle 2^{w-1} \\,-\\, 1 \\,+\\, \\frac{n}{w}</math> point additions.\n\n==={{math|''w''}}-ary non-adjacent form ({{math|''w''}}NAF) method===\nIn the [[non-adjacent form]] we aim to make use of the fact that point subtraction is just as easy as point addition to perform fewer (of either) as compared to a sliding-window method.  The NAF of the multiplicand <math>\\scriptstyle d</math> must be computed first with the following algorithm\n\n    i ← 0\n    while (d &gt; 0) do\n        if (d mod 2) = 1 then \n            d<sub>i</sub> ← d mods 2<sup>w</sup>\n            d ← d − d<sub>i</sub>\n        else\n            d<sub>i</sub> = 0\n        d ← d/2\n        i ← i + 1\n    return (d<sub>i−1</sub>, d<sub>i-2</sub>, …, d<sub>0</sub>)\n\nWhere the ''mods'' function is defined as \n  \n    if (d mod 2<sup>w</sup>) &gt;= 2<sup>w−1</sup>\n        return (d mod 2<sup>w</sup>) − 2<sup>w</sup>\n    else\n        return d mod 2<sup>w</sup>\n\nThis produces the NAF needed to now perform the multiplication.  This algorithm requires the pre-computation of the points <math>\\scriptstyle \\lbrace 1,\\, 3,\\, 5,\\, \\dots,\\, 2^{w-1} \\,-\\, 1 \\rbrace P</math> and their negatives, where <math>\\scriptstyle P</math> is the point to be multiplied.  On typical Weierstrass curves, if <math>\\scriptstyle P ~=~ \\lbrace x,\\, y \\rbrace</math> then <math>\\scriptstyle -P ~=~ \\lbrace x,\\, -y \\rbrace</math>.  So in essence the negatives are cheap to compute. Next, the following algorithm computes the multiplication <math>\\scriptstyle dP</math>:\n\n    Q ← 0\n    for j ← i − 1 downto 0 do\n        Q ← point_double(Q)\n        if (d<sub>j</sub> != 0)\n            Q ← point_add(Q, d<sub>j</sub>G)\n    return Q\n\nThe wNAF guarantees that on average there will be a density of <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{1}{w \\,+\\, 1}</math> point additions (slightly better than the unsigned window).  It requires 1 point doubling and <math>\\scriptstyle 2^{w-2} \\,-\\, 1</math> point additions for precomputation.  The algorithm then requires <math>\\scriptstyle n</math> point doublings and <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{n}{w \\,+\\, 1}</math> point additions for the rest of the multiplication.\n\nOne property of the NAF is that we are guaranteed that every non-zero element <math>\\scriptstyle d_i</math> is followed by at least <math>\\scriptstyle w \\,-\\, 1</math> additional zeroes.  This is because the algorithm clears out the lower <math>\\scriptstyle w</math> bits of <math>\\scriptstyle d</math> with every subtraction of the output of the ''mods'' function.  This observation can be used for several purposes. After every non-zero element the additional zeroes can be implied and do not need to be stored.  Secondly, the multiple serial divisions by 2 can be replaced by a division by <math>\\scriptstyle 2^w</math> after every non-zero <math>\\scriptstyle d_i</math> element and divide by 2 after every zero.\n\n===Montgomery ladder===\nThe Montgomery ladder<ref>{{cite journal | first=Peter L. | last=Montgomery | title=Speeding the Pollard and elliptic curve methods of factorization | journal=[[Math. Comp.]] | year=1987 | volume=48 | issue=177 | pages=243–264 | mr=0866113 | doi=10.2307/2007888}}</ref> approach computes the point multiplication in a ''fixed'' amount of time.  This can be beneficial when timing or power consumption measurements are exposed to an attacker performing a [[side-channel attack]].  The algorithm uses the same representation as from double-and-add.\n\n   R<sub>0</sub> ← 0\n   R<sub>1</sub> ← P\n   for i from m downto 0 do\n      if d<sub>i</sub> = 0 then\n         R<sub>1</sub> ← point_add(R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>)\n         R<sub>0</sub> ← point_double(R<sub>0</sub>)\n      else\n         R<sub>0</sub> ← point_add(R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>)\n         R<sub>1</sub> ← point_double(R<sub>1</sub>)\n   return R<sub>0</sub>\n\nThis algorithm has in effect the same speed as the double-and-add approach except that it computes the same number of point additions and doubles regardless of the value of the multiplicand ''d''.  This means that at this level the algorithm does not leak any information through timing or power. However, it has been shown that through application of a FLUSH+RELOAD side-channel attack, the full private key can be revealed after performing timing against as little as 200 signature.<ref>{{cite conference | first3=Nigel P. | last3=Smart | first2=Joop | last2=Van de Pol | first4=Yuval | last4=Yarom | first1=Naomi | last1=Benger | title=\"Ooh Aah...
