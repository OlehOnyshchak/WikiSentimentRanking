      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic torus''' is a type of commutative affine [[algebraic group]].  These [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] were named by analogy with the theory of ''tori'' in [[Lie group]] theory (see [[Cartan subgroup]]).\n\nTori are of fundamental importance in the theory of algebraic groups and Lie groups and in the study of the geometric objects associated to them such as [[symmetric space]]s and [[Building (mathematics)|buildings]].\n\n== Algebraic tori over fields ==\n\nIn most places we suppose that the base field is [[Perfect field|perfect]] (for example finite or characteristic zero). In general one has to use separable closures instead of algebraic closures.\n\n=== Multiplicative group of a field ===\n{{Main article | Multiplicative group}}\n\nIf <math>F</math> is a field then the ''multiplicative group'' over <math>F</math> is the algebraic group <math>\\mathbf G_{\\mathbf m}</math> such that for any field extension <math>E/F</math> the <math>E</math>-points are isomorphic to the group <math>E^\\times</math>. To define it properly as an algebraic group one can take the affine variety defined by the equation <math>xy = 1</math> in the affine plane over <math>F</math> with coordinates <math>x, y</math>. The multiplication is then given by restricting the regular rational map <math>F^2 \\times F^2 \\to F^2</math> defined by <math>((x, y), (x',y')) \\mapsto (xx', yy') </math> and the inverse is the restriction of the regular rational map <math>(x, y) \\mapsto (y, x)</math>.\n\n=== Definition ===\n\nLet <math>F</math> be a field with algebraic closure <math>\\overline F</math>. Then a ''<math>F</math>-torus'' is an algebraic group defined over <math>F</math> which is isomorphic over <math>\\overline F</math> to a finite product of copies of the multiplicative group.\n\nIn other words, if <math>\\mathbf T</math> is an <math>F</math>-group it is a torus if and only if <math>\\mathbf T(\\overline F) \\cong (\\overline F^\\times)^r</math> for some <math>r \\ge 1</math>. The basic terminology associated to tori is as follows.\n\n*The integer <math>r</math> is called the ''rank'' or ''absolute rank'' of the torus <math>\\mathrm T</math>.\n*The torus is said to be ''split'' over a field extension <math>E/F</math> if <math>\\mathbf T(E) \\cong (E^\\times)^r</math>. There is a unique minimal finite extension of <matH>F</math> over which <math>\\mathbf T</math> is split, which is called the ''splitting field'' of <math>\\mathbf T</math>.\n*The ''<math>F</math>-rank'' of <math>\\mathbf T</math> is the maximal rank of a split sub-torus of <math>\\mathbf T</math>. A torus is split if and only if its <math>F</math>-rank equals its absolute rank.\n*A torus is said to be ''anisotropic'' if its <matH>F</math>-rank is zero.\n\n=== Isogenies ===\n\nAn [[isogeny]] between algebraic groups is a surjective morphism with finite kernel; two tori are said to be ''isogenous'' if there exists an isogeny from the first to the second. Isogenies between tori are particularly well-behaved: for any isogeny <math>\\phi:\\mathbf T \\to \\mathbf T'</math> there exists a \"dual\" isogeny <math>\\psi: \\mathbf T' \\to \\mathbf T</math> such that <math>\\psi \\circ \\phi</math> is a power map. In particular being isogenous is an equivalence relation between tori.\n\n=== Examples ===\n\nOver any algebraically closed field there is up to isomorphism a unique torus of any given rank.\n\nOver the field of real numbers <math>\\mathbb R</math> there are exactly (up to isomorphism) two tori of rank 1:\n*the split torus <math>\\mathbb R^\\times</math> ; \n*the compact form, which can be realised as the [[unitary group]] <math>\\mathbf U(1)</math> or as the special [[orthogonal group]] <math>\\mathrm{SO}(2)</math>. It is an anisotropic torus. As a Lie group, it is also isomorphic to the 1-[[Torus (mathematics)|torus]] <math>\\mathbf T^1</math>, which explains the picture of diagonalisable algebraic groups as tori.\nAny real torus is isogenous to a finite sum of those two; for example the real torus <math>\\mathbb C^\\times</math> is doubly covered by (but not isomorphic to) <math>\\mathbb R^\\times \\times \\mathbb T^1</math>. This gives an example of isogenous, non-isomorphic tori.\n\nOver the [[finite field]] <math>\\mathbb F_q</math> there are two rank-1 tori: the split one, of cardinality <math>q-1</math>, and the anisotropic one of cardinality <math>q+1</math>. The latter can be realised as the matrix group\n:<math> \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} t & du \\\\ u & t \\end{pmatrix} : t,u \\in \\mathbb F_q, t^2 - du^2=1 \\right\\} \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb F_q) </math>.\n\nMore generally, if <math>E/F</math> is a finite field extension of degree <math>d</math> then the [[Weil restriction]] from <math>E</math> to <math>F</math> of the multiplicative group of <math>E</math> is an <math>F</math>-torus of rank <math>d</math> and <math>F</math>-rank 1 (note that restriction of scalars over an inseparable field extension will yield a commutative algebraic group that is not a torus). The kernel <math>N_{E/F}</math> of its [[field norm]] is also a torus, which is anisotropic and of rank <math>d-1</math>. Any <math>F</math>-torus of rank one is either split or isomorphic to the kernel of the norm of a quadratic extension.<ref>{{ cite book | ref=harv | title=Algebraic groups and their birational invariants | last=Voskresenskii | first=V. S. | series=Translations of mathematical monographs | publisher=American Math. Soc. | date=1998}}</ref> The two examples above are special cases of this: the compact real torus is the kernel of the field norm of <math>\\mathbb C/\\mathbb R</math> and the anisotropic torus over <math>\\mathbb F_q</math> is the kernel of the field norm of <math>\\mathbb F_{q^2} / \\mathbb F_q</math>.\n\n== Weights and coweights ==\n\nOver a separably closed field, a torus ''T'' admits two primary invariants. The [[Weight (representation theory)|weight]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] <math>X^\\bullet(T)</math> is the group of algebraic homomorphisms ''T''&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''G'''<sub>m</sub>, and the coweight lattice <math>X_\\bullet(T)</math> is the group of algebraic homomorphisms&nbsp;'''G'''<sub>m</sub>&nbsp;→&nbsp;''T''.  These are both free abelian groups whose rank is that of the torus, and they have a canonical nondegenerate pairing <math>X^\\bullet(T) \\times X_\\bullet(T) \\to \\mathbb{Z}</math> given by <math>(f,g) \\mapsto \\text{deg}(f \\circ g)</math>, where degree is the number ''n'' such that the composition is equal to the ''n''th power map on the multiplicative group.  The functor given by taking weights is an antiequivalence of categories between tori and free abelian groups, and the coweight functor is an equivalence.  In particular, maps of tori are characterized by linear transformations on weights or coweights, and the automorphism group of a torus is a general linear group over&nbsp;'''Z'''.  The quasi-inverse of the weights functor is given by a dualization functor from free abelian groups to tori, defined by its functor of points as:\n\n:<math>D(M)_S(X) := \\mathrm{Hom}(M, \\mathbb{G}_{m,S}(X)).</math>\n\nThis equivalence can be generalized to pass between groups of multiplicative type (a distinguished class of [[formal group]]s) and arbitrary abelian groups, and such a generalization can be convenient if one wants to work in a well-behaved category, since the category of tori doesn't have kernels or filtered colimits.\n\nWhen a field ''K'' is not separably closed, the weight and coweight lattices of a torus over ''K'' are defined as the respective lattices over the separable closure.  This induces canonical continuous actions of the absolute Galois group of ''K'' on the lattices.  The weights and coweights that are fixed by this action are precisely the maps that are defined over&nbsp;''K''.  The functor of taking weights is an antiequivalence between the category of tori over ''K'' with algebraic homomorphisms and the category of finitely generated torsion free abelian groups with an action of the absolute Galois group of ''K''.\n\nGiven a finite separable field extension ''L''/''K'' and a torus ''T'' over ''L'', we have a [[Galois module]] isomorphism\n\n:<math>X^\\bullet(\\mathrm{Res}_{L/K}T) \\cong \\mathrm{Ind}_{G_L}^{G_K} X^\\bullet(T).</math>\n\nIf ''T'' is the multiplicative group, then this gives the restriction of scalars a permutation module structure.  Tori whose weight lattices are permutation modules for the Galois group are called quasi-split, and all quasi-split tori are finite products of restrictions of scalars.\n\n== Tori in semisimple groups ==\n\n=== Linear representations of tori ===\n\nAs seen in the examples above tori can be represented as linear groups. An alternative definition for tori is:\n\n:''A linear algebraic group is a torus if and only if it is diagonalisable over an algebraic closure. ''\n\nThe torus is split over a field if and only if it is diagonalisable over this field.\n\n=== Split rank of a semisimple group ===\n\nIf <math>\\mathbf G</math> is a semisimple algebraic group over a field <math>F</math> then:\n*its ''rank'' (or ''absolute rank'') is the rank of a maximal torus subgroup in <math>\\mathbf G</math> (note that all maximal tori are conjugated over <math>F</math> so the rank is well-defined); \n*its ''<math>F</math>-rank'' (sometimes called ''<math>F</math>-split rank'') is the maximal rank of a torus subgroup in <math>G</math> which is split over <math>F</math>. \nObviously the rank is larger than the <math>F</math>-rank; the group is called ''split'' if and only if equality holds (that is, there is a maximal torus in <math>\\mathbf G</math> which is split over <math>F</math>). The group is called ''anisotropic'' if it contains no split tori (i.e. its <math>F</math>-rank is zero).\n\n=== Classification of semisimple groups ===\n{{Main article|Tits index}}\n\nIn the classical theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s over the complex field the [[Cartan subalgebra]]s play a fundamental rôle in the classification via [[root system]]s and [[Dynkin diagram]]s. This classification is equivalent to that of connected algebraic groups over the complex field, and Cartan subalgebras correspond to maximal tori in these. In fact the classification carries over to the case of an arbitrary base field under the assumption that there exists a split maximal torus (which is automatically satisfied over an algebraically closed field). Without the splitness assumption things become much more complicated and a more detailed theory has to be developed, which is still based in part on the study of adjoint actions of tori.\n\nIf <math>\\mathbf T</math> is a maximal torus in a semisimple algebraic group <math>\\mathbf G</math> then over the algebraic closure it gives rise to a root system <math>\\Phi</math> in the vector space <math>V = X^*(\\mathbf T) \\otimes_{\\mathbb Z} \\mathbb R</math>. On the other hand, if <math>{}_F \\mathbf T \\subset \\mathbf T</math> is a maximal <math>F</math>-split torus its action on the <math>F</math>-Lie algebra of <math>\\mathbf G</math> gives rise to another root system <math>{}_F \\Phi</math>. The restriction map <math>X^*(\\mathbf T) \\to X^*(_F\\mathbf T)</math> induces a map <math>\\Phi \\to {}_F\\Phi \\cup\\{0\\}</math> and the [[Tits index]] is a way to encode the properties of this map and of the action of the Galois group of <math>\\overline F / F</math> on <math>\\Phi</math>. The Tits index is a \"relative\" version of the \"absolute\" Dynkin diagram associated to <math>\\Phi</math>; obviously, only finitely many Tits indices can correspond to a given Dynkin diagram.\n\nAnother invariant associated to the split torus <math>{}_F \\mathbf T</math> is the ''anisotropic kernel'': this is the semisimple algebraic group obtained as the derived subgroup of the centraliser of <math>{}_F \\mathbf T</math> in <math>\\mathbf G</math> (the latter is only a reductive group). As its name indicates it is an anisotropic group, and its absolute type is uniquely determined by <math>{}_F \\Phi</math>.\n\nThe first step towards a classification is then the following theorem{{sfn|Tits|1966|loc=Theorem 2.7.1}}\n\n:''Two semisimple <math>F</math>-algebraic groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same Tits indices and isomorphic anisotropic kernels. ''\n\nThis reduces the classification problem to anisotropic groups, and to determining which Tits indices can occur for a given Dynkin diagram. The latter problem has been solved in {{harvtxt|Tits|1966}}. The former is related to the [[Galois cohomology]] groups of <math>F</math>. More precisely to each Tits index there is associated a unique [[quasi-split group]] over <math>F</math>; then every <math>F</math>-group with the same index is an [[inner form]] of this quasi-split group, and those are classified by the Galois cohomology of <math>F</math> with coefficients in the adjoint group.\n\n== Tori and geometry ==\n\n=== Flat subspaces and rank of symmetric spaces ===\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a semisimple Lie group then its '''real rank''' is the <math>\\mathbb R</math>-rank as defined above (for any <math>\\mathbb R</math>-algebraic group whose group of real points is isomorphic to <math>G</math>), in other words the maximal <math>r</math> such that there exists an embedding <math>(\\mathbb R^\\times)^r \\to G</math>. For example, the real rank of <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb R)</math> is equal to <math>n-1</math>, and the real rank of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(p,q)</math> is equal to <math>\\min(p,q)</math>.\n\nIf <math>X</math> is the [[symmetric space]] associated to <math>G</math> and <math>T \\subset G</math> is a maximal split torus then there exists a unique orbit of <math>T</math> in <math>X</math> which is a totally geodesic flat subspace in <math>X</math>. It is in fact a maximal flat subspace and all maximal such are obtained as orbits of split tori in this way. Thus there is a geometric definition of the real rank, as the maximal dimension of a flat subspace in <math>X</math>.{{sfn|Witte-Morris|2015|p=22}}\n\n=== Q-rank of lattices ===\n\nIf the Lie group <math>G</math> is obtained as the real points of an algebraic group <math>\\mathbf G</math> over the rational field <math>\\mathbb Q</math> then the <math>\\mathbb Q</math>-rank of <math>\\mathbf G</math> has also a geometric significance. To get to it one has to introduce an [[arithmetic group]] <math>\\Gamma</math> associated to <matH>\\mathbf G</math>, which roughly is the group of integer points of <math>\\mathbf G</math>, and the quotient space <math>M = \\Gamma \\backslash X</math>, which is a Riemannian orbifold and hence a metric space. Then any [[asymptotic cone]] of <math>M</math> is homeomorphic to a finite [[simplicial complex]] with top-dimensional simplices of dimension equal to the <math>\\mathbb Q</math>-rank of <math>\\mathbf G</math>. In particular, <math>M</math> is compact if and only if <math>\\mathbf G</math> is anisotropic.{{sfn|Witte-Morris|2015|p=25}}\n\nNote that this allows to define the <math>\\mathbf Q</math>-rank of any lattice in a semisimple Lie group, as the dimension of its asymptotic cone.\n\n=== Buildings ===\n{{Main article | Building (mathematics)}}\n\nIf <math>\\mathbf G</math> is a semisimple group over <math>\\mathbb Q_p</math> the maximal split tori in <math>\\mathbf G</math> correspond to the apartments of the Bruhat-Tits building <math>X</math> associated to <math>\\mathbf G</math>. In particular the dimension of <math>X</math> is equal to the <math>\\mathbb Q_p</matH>-rank of <math>\\mathbf G</math>.\n\n== Algebraic tori over an arbitrary base scheme ==\n\n=== Definition ===\n\nGiven a base [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''S'', an algebraic torus over ''S'' is defined to be a [[group scheme]] over ''S'' that is [[flat topology|fpqc locally]] isomorphic to a finite product of copies of the multiplicative group scheme '''G'''<sub>''m''</sub>/''S'' over ''S''.  In other words, there exists a faithfully flat map ''X''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''S'' such that any point in ''X'' has a quasi-compact open neighborhood ''U'' whose image is an open affine subscheme of ''S'', such that base change to ''U'' yields a finite product of copies of ''GL''<sub>1,''U''</sub> = '''G'''<sub>''m''</sub>/''U''.{{clarify|reason=undefined notation|date=March 2015}}  One particularly important case is when ''S'' is the spectrum of a field ''K'', making a torus over ''S'' an algebraic group whose extension to some finite separable extension ''L'' is a finite product of copies of '''G'''<sub>''m''</sub>/''L''.  In general, the multiplicity of this product (i.e., the dimension of the scheme) is called the [[rank (differential topology)|rank]] of the torus, and it is a locally constant function on ''S''.\n\nMost notions defined for tori over fields carry to this more general setting.\n\n=== Weights ===\n\nFor a general base scheme ''S'', weights and coweights are defined as fpqc sheaves of free abelian groups on ''S''.  These provide representations of fundamental groupoids of the base with respect the fpqc topology.  If the torus is locally trivializable with respect to a weaker topology such as the etale topology, then the sheaves of groups descend to the same topologies and these representations factor through the respective quotient groupoids.  In particular, an etale sheaf gives rise to a quasi-isotrivial torus, and if ''S'' is locally noetherian and normal (more generally, [[Unibranch local ring|geometrically unibranched]]), the torus is isotrivial.  As a partial converse, a theorem of [[Grothendieck]] asserts that any torus of finite type is quasi-isotrivial, i.e., split by an etale surjection.\n\nGiven a rank ''n'' torus ''T'' over ''S'', a twisted form is a torus over ''S'' for which there exists a fpqc covering of ''S'' for which their base extensions are isomorphic, i.e., it is a torus of the same rank.  Isomorphism classes of twisted forms of a split torus are parametrized by nonabelian flat cohomology <math>H^1(S, GL_n(\\mathbb{Z}))</math>, where the coefficient group forms a constant sheaf.  In particular, twisted forms of a split torus ''T'' over a field ''K'' are parametrized by elements of the Galois cohomology pointed set <math>H^1(G_K, GL_n(\\mathbb{Z}))</math> with trivial Galois action on the coefficients.  In the one-dimensional case, the coefficients form a group of order two, and isomorphism classes of twisted forms of '''G'''<sub>m</sub> are in natural bijection with separable quadratic extensions of&nbsp;''K''.\n\nSince taking a weight lattice is an equivalence of categories, short exact sequences of tori correspond to short exact sequences of the corresponding weight lattices.  In particular, extensions of tori are classified by Ext<sup>1</sup> sheaves.  These are naturally isomorphic to the flat cohomology groups <math>H^1(S, \\mathrm{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z} (X^\\bullet(T_1), X^\\bullet(T_2)))</math>.  Over a field, the extensions are parametrized by elements of the corresponding Galois cohomology group.\n\n==Arithmetic invariants==\n\nIn his work on [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers|Tamagawa numbers]], [[Takashi Ono (mathematician)|T. Ono]] introduced a type of functorial invariants of tori over finite separable extensions of a chosen field ''k''.  Such an invariant is a collection of positive real-valued functions ''f''<sub>K</sub> on isomorphism classes of tori over ''K'', as ''K'' runs over finite separable extensions of ''k'', satisfying three properties:\n# Multiplicativity: Given two tori ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> over ''K'', ''f''<sub>K</sub>(''T''<sub>1</sub> &times; ''T''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''<sub>K</sub>(''T''<sub>1</sub>) ''f''<sub>K</sub>(''T''<sub>2</sub>)\n# Restriction: For a finite separable extension ''L''/''K'', ''f''<sub>L</sub> evaluated on an ''L'' torus is equal to ''f''<sub>K</sub> evaluated on its restriction of scalars to ''K''.\n# Projective triviality: If ''T'' is a torus over ''K'' whose weight lattice is a projective Galois module, then ''f''<sub>K</sub>(''T'') = 1.\n\nT. Ono showed that the Tamagawa number of a torus over a number field is such an invariant.  Furthermore, he showed that it is a quotient of two cohomological invariants, namely the order of the group <math>H^1(G_k, X^\\bullet(T)) \\cong Ext^1(T, \\mathbb{G}_m)</math> (sometimes mistakenly called the [[Picard group]] of ''T'', although it doesn't classify '''G'''<sub>m</sub> torsors over ''T''), and the order of the [[Tate&ndash;Shafarevich group]].\n\nThe notion of invariant given above generalizes naturally to tori over arbitrary base schemes, with functions taking values in more general rings.  While the order of the extension group is a general invariant, the other two invariants above do not seem to have interesting analogues outside the realm of fraction fields of one-dimensional domains and their completions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n\n*[[Toric geometry]]\n*[[Torus]]\n*[[Torus based cryptography]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n*A.

Automorphic forms are a generalization of the idea of [[periodic function]]s in Euclidean space to general topological groups.\n\n[[Modular form]]s are automorphic forms defined over the groups [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] or [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2, '''R''')]] with the discrete subgroup being the [[modular group]], or one of its [[congruence subgroup]]s; in this sense the theory of automorphic forms is an extension of the theory of modular forms. More generally, one can use the [[Adele ring|adelic]] approach as a way of dealing with the whole family of [[congruence subgroup]]s at once. From this point of view, an automorphic form over the group G('''A'''<sub>''F''</sub>), for an algebraic group G and an algebraic number field ''F'',  is a complex-valued function on G('''A'''<sub>''F''</sub>) that is left invariant under G(F) and satisfies certain smoothness and growth conditions.\n\n[[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] first discovered automorphic forms as generalizations of [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric]] and [[elliptic function]]s. Through the [[Langlands conjectures]] automorphic forms play an important role in modern number theory.<ref name=Freidberg2013>{{cite web|last=Friedberg|first=Solomon|title=Automorphic Forms: A Brief Introduction|url=https://icerm.brown.edu/materials/Slides/sp-s13-off_weeks/Automorphic_Forms-_A_Brief_Introduction_]_Solomon_Friedberg,_Boston_College.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606222417/http://icerm.brown.edu/materials/Slides/sp-s13-off_weeks/Automorphic_Forms-_A_Brief_Introduction_%5D_Solomon_Friedberg,_Boston_College.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 June 2013|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Formulation==\n\nAn automorphic form is a function ''F'' on ''G'' (with values in some fixed finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'', in the vector-valued case), subject to three kinds of conditions:\n\n# to transform under translation by elements <math>\\gamma \\in \\Gamma </math> according to the given [[factor of automorphy]] ''j'';\n# to be an [[eigenfunction]] of certain [[Casimir operator]]s on ''G''; and\n# to satisfy a \"moderate growth\" asymptotic condition a [[height function]].<ref>{{harvs|txt|last=Bump|authorlink=Daniel Bump|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nIt is the first of these that makes ''F'' ''automorphic'', that is, satisfy an interesting [[functional equation]] relating ''F''(''g'') with ''F''(γ''g'') for <math>\\gamma \\in \\Gamma </math>. In the vector-valued case the specification can involve a finite-dimensional [[group representation]] ρ acting on the components to 'twist' them. The Casimir operator condition says that some [[Laplacian]]s{{Citation needed|reason=unveriviable and unsufficient citation about the source|date=May 2017}} have ''F'' as eigenfunction; this ensures that ''F'' has excellent analytic properties, but whether it is actually a complex-analytic function depends on the particular case. The third condition is to handle the case where ''G''/Γ is not [[compact space|compact]] but has [[Cusp form|cusp]]s.\n\nThe formulation requires the general notion of ''factor of automorphy'' ''j'' for Γ, which is a type of 1-[[Group cohomology#Cochain complexes|cocycle]] in the language of [[group cohomology]]. The values of ''j'' may be complex numbers, or in fact complex square matrices, corresponding to the possibility of vector-valued automorphic forms. The cocycle condition imposed on the factor of automorphy is something that can be routinely checked, when ''j'' is derived from a [[Jacobian matrix]], by means of the [[chain rule]].\n\n==History==\nBefore this very general setting was proposed (around 1960), there had already been substantial developments of automorphic forms other than modular forms. The case of Γ a [[Fuchsian group]] had already received attention before 1900 (see below). The [[Hilbert modular form]]s (also called Hilbert-Blumenthal forms) were proposed not long after that, though a full theory was long in coming. The [[Siegel modular form]]s, for which ''G'' is a [[symplectic group]], arose naturally from considering [[moduli space]]s and [[theta function]]s. The post-war interest in several complex variables made it natural to pursue the idea of automorphic form in the cases where the forms are indeed complex-analytic. Much work was done, in particular by [[Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro]], in the years around 1960, in creating such a theory. The theory of the [[Selberg trace formula]], as applied by others, showed the considerable depth of the theory. [[Robert Langlands]] showed how (in generality, many particular cases being known) the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] could be applied to the calculation of dimensions of automorphic forms; this is a kind of ''post hoc'' check on the validity of the notion. He also produced the general theory of [[real analytic Eisenstein series|Eisenstein series]], which corresponds to what in [[spectral theory]] terms would be the 'continuous spectrum' for this problem, leaving the [[cusp form]] or discrete part to investigate. From the point of view of number theory, the cusp forms had been recognised, since [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]], as the heart of the matter.\n\n==Automorphic representations==\n{{See also|Cuspidal representation}}\nThe subsequent notion of an \"automorphic representation\" has proved of great technical value when dealing with ''G'' an [[algebraic group]], treated as an [[adelic algebraic group]]. It does not completely include the automorphic form idea introduced above, in that the [[Adele ring|adelic]] approach is a way of dealing with the whole family of [[congruence subgroup]]s at once. Inside an ''L''<sup>2</sup> space for a quotient of the adelic form of ''G'', an automorphic representation is a representation that is an infinite [[tensor product]] of representations of [[p-adic group]]s, with specific [[Universal enveloping algebra|enveloping algebra]] representations for the [[infinite prime]](s). One way to express the shift in emphasis is that the [[Hecke operator]]s are here in effect put on the same level as the Casimir operators; which is natural from the point of view of [[functional analysis]]{{Citation needed|reason=unveriviable and unsufficient citation about the source|date=May 2017}}, though not so obviously for the number theory. It is this concept that is basic to the formulation of the [[Langlands philosophy]].\n\n==Poincaré on discovery and his work on automorphic functions==\nOne of [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]'s first discoveries in mathematics, dating to the 1880s, was automorphic forms. He named them Fuchsian functions, after the mathematician [[Lazarus Fuchs]], because Fuchs was known for being a good teacher and had researched on differential equations and the theory of functions. Poincaré actually developed the concept of these functions as part of his doctoral thesis. Under Poincaré's definition, an automorphic function is one which is analytic in its domain and is invariant under a discrete infinite group of linear fractional transformations. Automorphic functions then generalize both [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric]] and [[elliptic function]]s.\n\nPoincaré explains how he discovered Fuchsian functions:\n:''For fifteen days I strove to prove that there could not be any functions like those I have since called Fuchsian functions. I was then very ignorant; every day I seated myself at my work table, stayed an hour or two, tried a great number of combinations and reached no results. One evening, contrary to my custom, I drank black coffee and could not sleep. Ideas rose in crowds; I felt them collide until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making a stable combination. By the next morning I had established the existence of a class of Fuchsian functions, those which come from the [[hypergeometric series]]; I had only to write out the results, which took but a few hours.''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Automorphic factor]]\n* [[Factor of automorphy]]\n* [[Maass cusp form]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{springer|id=a/a014160|authorlink=Alexey Parshin|author=A.

      "text": "{{short description|formula in Lie theory}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula''' is the solution for <math>Z</math> to the equation\n\n:<math>e^X e^Y=e^Z</math>\nfor possibly [[noncommutative]] {{mvar|''X''}} and {{mvar|''Y''}} in the [[Lie algebra]] of a [[Lie group]]. There are various ways of writing the formula, but all ultimately yield an expression for <math>Z</math> in Lie algebraic terms, that is, as a formal series (not necessarily convergent) in <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> and iterated commutators thereof. The first few terms of this series are:\n:<math>Z = X+Y+\\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]+\\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]]-\\frac{1}{12}[Y,[X,Y]]+\\cdots\\,,</math>\nwhere \"<math>\\cdots</math>\" indicates terms involving higher commutators of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. If <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are sufficiently small elements of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of a Lie group <math>G</math>, the series is convergent. Meanwhile, every element <math>g</math> sufficiently close to the identity in <math>G</math> can be expressed as <math>g=e^X</math> for a small <math>X</math> in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. Thus, we can say that ''near the identity'' the group multiplication in <math>G</math>—written as <math>e^Xe^Y=e^Z</math>—can be expressed in purely Lie algebraic terms. The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula can be used to give comparatively simple proofs of deep results in the [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]].\n\nIf <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are sufficiently small <math>n\\times n</math> matrices, then <math>Z</math> can be computed as the logarithm of <math>e^Xe^Y</math>, where the exponentials and the logarithm can be computed as power series. The point of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula is then the highly nonobvious claim that <math>Z:=\\log(e^Xe^Y)</math> can be expressed as a series in repeated commutators of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. \n\nModern expositions of the formula can be found in, among other places, the books of Rossmann<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}}</ref> and Hall<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} </ref>.\n\n== History ==\nThe formula is named after [[Henry Frederick Baker]], [[John Edward Campbell]], and [[Felix Hausdorff]] who stated its qualitative form, i.e. that only [[commutator]]s and commutators of commutators, ad infinitum, are needed to express the solution.

Thus, if one wants ''Z'' to be an actual element of the Lie algebra containing ''X'' and ''Y'' (as opposed to a formal power series), one has to assume that ''X'' and ''Y'' are small. Thus, the conclusion that the product operation on a Lie group is determined by the Lie algebra is only a local statement. Indeed, the result cannot be global, because globally one can have nonisomorphic Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras.\n\nConcretely, if working with a matrix Lie algebra and <math>\\|.\\|</math> is a given [[matrix norm|submultiplicative matrix norm]], convergence is guaranteed<ref name=\"dynkin\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Biagi|first=Stefano|last2=Bonfiglioli|first2=Andrea|last3=Matone|first3=Marco|date=2018|title=On the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Theorem: non-convergence and prolongation issues|journal=Linear and Multilinear Algebra|language=en|volume=|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/03081087.2018.1540534|issn=0308-1087|arxiv=1805.10089}}</ref> if\n\n:<math>\\|X\\|+\\|Y\\|< \\frac{\\ln 2} 2.</math>\n\n== Special cases ==\nIf ''<math>X</math>'' and ''<math>Y</math>'' commute, that is <math>[X,Y]=0</math>, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula reduces to <math>e^X e^Y = e^{X+Y}</math>. \n\nA more interesting case assumes that <math>[X,Y]</math> commutes with both <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>, as for the [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]] [[Heisenberg group]].

In this case, there are no smallness restrictions on <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. This result is behind the \"exponentiated commutation relations\" that enter into the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]]. A simple proof of this identity is given below.\n\nAnother useful form of the general formula emphasizes\nexpansion in terms of ''Y'' and uses the [[adjoint endomorphism|adjoint]] mapping notation <math>ad_X(Y)=[X,Y]</math>:\n:<math>\\log(\\exp X\\exp Y) = X + \\frac{\\operatorname{ad}_X}{1-e^{-\\operatorname{ad}_X}} ~ Y + O(Y^2),</math>\n\nwhich is evident from the integral formula below.

The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula implies that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are in some [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak g,</math> defined over any field of [[characteristic 0]] like <math>\\R</math> or <math>\\C</math>, then\n\n:<math>Z = \\log(\\exp(X) \\exp(Y)),</math>\n\ncan formally be written as an infinite sum of elements of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. [This infinite series may or may not converge, so it need not define an actual element ''Z'' in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.] For many applications, the mere assurance of the existence of this formal expression is sufficient, and an explicit expression for this infinite sum is not needed.

It follows that <math>X</math> and <math>P</math> commute with their commutator. Thus, if we ''formally'' applied a special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula (even though <math>X</math> and <math>P</math> are unbounded operators and not matrices), we would conclude that\n:<math>e^{iaX}e^{ibP}=e^{i(aX+bP-ab\\hbar)}.</math>\nThis \"exponentiated commutation relation\" does indeed hold, and forms the basis of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]]<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 14</ref>.\n\nA related application is the [[annihilation and creation operators]], {{mvar|''â''}} and {{math|''â''<sup>†</sup>}}. Their commutator {{math|[''â''<sup>†</sup>,''â'']{{=}} −''I''}} is [[Center (group theory)|''central'']], that is, it commutes with both {{mvar|''â''}} and {{math|''â''<sup>†</sup>}}. As indicated above, the expansion then collapses to the semi-trivial degenerate form:\n:<math> e^{v\\hat{a}^\\dagger - v^*\\hat{a}} = e^{v\\hat{a}^\\dagger} e^{-v^*\\hat{a}} e^{-|v|^{2}/2} ,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|''v''}} is just a complex number.\n\nThis example illustrates the resolution of the [[displacement operator]], {{math|exp(''vâ''<sup>†</sup>−''v<sup>*</sup>â'')}}, into exponentials of annihilation and creation operators and scalars.<ref>[[Leonard Mandel|L. Mandel]], [[Emil Wolf|E. Wolf]] ''Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics'' (Cambridge 1995).</ref>\n\nThis degenerate Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula then displays the product of two displacement operators as another displacement operator (up to a phase factor), with the resultant displacement equal to the sum of the two displacements,\n:<math> e^{v\\hat{a}^\\dagger - v^*\\hat{a}} e^{u\\hat{a}^\\dagger - u^*\\hat{a}} = e^{(v+u)\\hat{a}^\\dagger -(v^*+u^*)\\hat{a}} e^{(vu^*-uv^*)/2},</math>\nsince the [[Heisenberg group]] they provide a representation of is [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]].

It is related to the [[Schubert cell]] decomposition of Grassmannians: see [[Weyl group]] for this.\n\nMore generally, any group with a [[(B, N) pair|(''B'', ''N'') pair]] has a Bruhat decomposition.\n\n==Definitions==\n*''G'' is a [[connected space|connected]], [[reductive group|reductive]] [[algebraic group]] over an [[algebraically closed field]].\n*''B'' is a [[Borel subgroup]] of ''G''\n*''W'' is a [[Weyl group]] of ''G'' corresponding to a maximal torus of ''B''.\n\nThe '''Bruhat decomposition''' of ''G'' is the decomposition\n:<math>G=BWB =\\coprod_{w\\in W}BwB</math>\nof ''G'' as a disjoint union of [[double coset]]s of ''B'' parameterized by the elements of the Weyl group ''W''. (Note that although ''W'' is not in general a subgroup of ''G'', the coset ''wB'' is still well defined.)\n\n== Examples ==\nLet ''G'' be the [[general linear group]] '''GL'''<sub>''n''</sub> of invertible <math>n \\times n</math> matrices with entries in some algebraically closed field, which is a reductive group. Then the Weyl group ''W'' is isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> on ''n'' letters, with [[permutation matrices]] as representatives. In this case, we can take ''B'' to be the subgroup of upper triangular invertible matrices, so Bruhat decomposition says that one can write any invertible matrix ''A'' as a product ''U''<sub>1</sub>''PU''<sub>2</sub> where ''U''<sub>1</sub> and ''U''<sub>2</sub> are upper triangular, and ''P'' is a permutation matrix. Writing this as ''P'' = ''U''<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>''AU''<sub>2</sub><sup>−1</sup>, this says that any invertible matrix can be transformed into a permutation matrix via a series of row and column operations, where we are only allowed to add row ''i'' (resp. column ''i'') to row ''j'' (resp. column ''j'') if ''i''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''j'' (resp. ''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''j''). The row operations correspond to ''U''<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>, and the column operations correspond to ''U''<sub>2</sub><sup>−1</sup>.\n\nThe [[special linear group]] '''SL'''<sub>''n''</sub> of invertible <math>n \\times n</math> matrices with [[determinant]] 1 is a [[semisimple algebraic group|semisimple group]], and hence reductive. In this case, ''W'' is still isomorphic to the symmetric group ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>. However, the determinant of a permutation matrix is the sign of the permutation, so to represent an odd permutation in '''SL'''<sub>''n''</sub>, we can take one of the nonzero elements to be −1 instead of 1. Here ''B'' is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with determinant 1, so the interpretation of Bruhat decomposition in this case is similar to the case of '''GL'''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\n== Geometry ==\nThe cells in the Bruhat decomposition correspond to the [[Schubert cell]] decomposition of Grassmannians. The dimension of the cells corresponds to the [[length function|length]] of the word ''w'' in the Weyl group. [[Poincaré duality]] constrains the topology of the cell decomposition, and thus the algebra of the Weyl group; for instance, the top dimensional cell is unique (it represents the [[fundamental class]]), and corresponds to the [[longest element of a Coxeter group]].\n\n==Computations==\nThe number of cells in a given dimension of the Bruhat decomposition are the coefficients of the ''q''-polynomial<ref>[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week186.html This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 186]</ref> of the associated [[Dynkin diagram]].\n\n==Double Bruhat Cells==\n\nWith two opposite Borels one may intersect the Bruhat cells for each of them.\n:<math>G=\\coprod_{w_1 , w_2\\in W} ( Bw_1 B \\bigcap B_- w_2 B_- )</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lie group decompositions]]\n* [[Birkhoff factorization]], a special case of the Bruhat decomposition for affine groups.\n* [[Cluster algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*[[Armand Borel|Borel, Armand]].

      "text": "{{broader|Rotation group SO(3)}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[special orthogonal group]] in three dimensions, otherwise known as the [[rotation group SO(3)]], is a naturally occurring example of a [[manifold]]. The various '''[[Chart (topology)|chart]]s on SO(3)''' set up rival [[coordinate system]]s: in this case there cannot be said to be a preferred set of [[parameter]]s describing a rotation. There are three [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], so that the dimension of SO(3) is three. In numerous applications one or other coordinate system is used, and the question arises how to convert from a given system to another.\n\n==The space of rotations==\nIn [[geometry]] the '''rotation group''' is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[rotation]]s about the origin of three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>3</sup> under the operation of [[functional composition|composition]].<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 34, Ex. 14.</ref> By definition, a rotation about the origin is a [[linear transformation]] that preserves [[length]] of [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]s (it is an [[isometry]]) and preserves [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] (i.e. ''handedness'') of space. A length-preserving transformation which reverses orientation is called an [[improper rotation]].  Every improper rotation of three-dimensional Euclidean space is a rotation followed by a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane through the origin.\n\nComposing two rotations results in another rotation; every rotation has a unique inverse rotation; and the [[identity map]] satisfies the definition of a rotation. Owing to the above properties, the set of all rotations is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition. Moreover, the rotation group has a natural [[manifold]] structure for which the group operations are [[smooth function|smooth]]; so it is in fact a [[Lie group]]. The rotation group is often denoted SO(3) for reasons explained [[#Orthogonal_and_rotation_matrices|below]].\n\nThe space of rotations is isomorphic with the set of [[rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]]s and the set of orthonormal matrices with determinant +1. It is also isomorphic with the set of quaternions with their internal product, and also equivalent to the set of rotation vectors, with a different internal composition operation given by the product of their equivalent matrices.\n\nRotation vectors notation arise from the [[Euler's rotation theorem]] which states that any rotation in three dimensions can be described by a rotation by some angle about some axis. Considering this, we can then specify the axis of one of these rotations by two angles, and we can use the radius of the vector to specify the [[angle of rotation]]. These vectors represent a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] in 3D with an unusual topology.\n\nThis 3D solid sphere is equivalent to the surface of a 4D sphere, which is also a 3D variety. For doing this equivalence, we will have to define how will we represent a rotation with this 4D-embedded surface.\n\n==The hypersphere of rotations==\n[[Image:Space of rotations.png|200px|thumb|right|Two rotations by different angles and different axes in the space of rotations. The length of the vector is related to the magnitude of the rotation.]]\n\n===Visualizing the hypersphere===\nIt is interesting to consider the space as the three-dimensional sphere '''S'''<sup>3</sup>, the boundary of a disk in 4-dimensional Euclidean space. For doing this, we will have to define how we represent a rotation with this 4D-embedded surface.\n\nThe way in which the radius can be used to specify the angle of rotation is not straightforward. It can be related to circles of latitude in a sphere with a defined north pole and is explained following.\n\nBeginning at the north pole of a sphere in three-dimensional space, we specify the point at the north pole to represent the identity rotation. In the case of the identity rotation, no axis of rotation is defined, and the angle of rotation (zero) is irrelevant. A rotation with its axis contained in the ''xy''-plane and a very small rotation angle can be specified by a slice through the sphere parallel to the ''xy''-plane and very near the north pole. The circle defined by this slice will be very small, corresponding to the small angle of the rotation. As the rotation angles become larger, the slice moves southward, and the circles become larger until the equator of the sphere is reached, which will correspond to a rotation angle of 180 degrees. Continuing southward, the radii of the circles now become smaller (corresponding to the absolute value of the angle of the rotation considered as a negative number). Finally, as the south pole is reached, the circles shrink once more to the identity rotation, which is also specified as the point at the south pole. Notice that a number of characteristics of such rotations and their representations can be seen by this visualization.\n\nThe space of rotations is continuous, each rotation has a neighborhood of rotations which are nearly the same, and this neighborhood becomes flat as the neighborhood shrinks.\n\n===Aliases===\n[[Image:Hypersphere of rotations.png|250px|thumb|right|The hypersphere of rotations for the rotations that have a \"horizontal\" axis (in the ''xy''-plane).]]\n\nAlso, each rotation is actually represented by two antipodal points on the sphere, which are at opposite ends of a line through the center of the sphere. This reflects the fact that each rotation can be represented as a rotation about some axis, or, equivalently, as a negative rotation about an axis pointing in the opposite direction (a so-called [[Double covering group|double cover]]). The \"latitude\" of a circle representing a particular rotation angle will be half of the angle represented by that rotation, since as the point is moved from the north to south pole, the latitude ranges from zero to 180 degrees, while the angle of rotation ranges from 0 to [[turn (geometry)|360 degrees]]. (the \"longitude\" of a point then represents a particular axis of rotation.) Note however that this set of rotations is not closed under composition.\n\nTwo successive rotations with axes in the ''xy''-plane will not necessarily give a rotation whose axis lies in the ''xy''-plane, and thus cannot be represented as a point on the sphere. This will not be the case with a general rotation in 3-space, which do form a closed set under composition.\n\nThis visualization can be extended to a general rotation in 3-dimensional space. The identity rotation is a point, and a small angle of rotation about some axis can be represented as a point on a sphere with a small radius. As the angle of rotation grows, the sphere grows, until the angle of rotation reaches 180 degrees, at which point the sphere begins to shrink, becoming a point as the angle approaches 360 degrees (or zero degrees from the negative direction). This set of expanding and contracting spheres represents a [[3-sphere|hypersphere in four-dimensional space]] (a 3-sphere).\n\nJust as in the simpler example above, each rotation represented as a point on the hypersphere is matched by its antipodal point on that hypersphere. The \"latitude\" on the hypersphere will be half of the corresponding angle of rotation, and the neighborhood of any point will become \"flatter\" (i.e. be represented by a 3D Euclidean space of points) as the neighborhood shrinks.\n\nThis behavior is matched by the set of unit quaternions: A general quaternion represents a point in a four-dimensional space, but constraining it to have unit magnitude yields a three-dimensional space equivalent to the surface of a hypersphere. The magnitude of the unit quaternion will be unity, corresponding to a hypersphere of unit radius.\n\nThe vector part of a unit quaternion represents the radius of the 2-sphere corresponding to the axis of rotation, and its magnitude is the sine of half the angle of rotation. Each rotation is represented by two unit quaternions of opposite sign, and, as in the space of rotations in three dimensions, the quaternion product of two unit quaternions will yield a unit quaternion. Also, the space of unit quaternions is \"flat\" in any infinitesimal neighborhood of a given unit quaternion.\n\n==Parametrizations==\n{{main|Orientation (geometry)}}\n\nWe can parameterize the space of rotations in several ways, but degenerations will always appear. For example, if we use three angles ([[Euler angles]]), such parameterization is degenerate at some points on the hypersphere, leading to the problem of [[gimbal lock]]. We can avoid this by using four Euclidean coordinates ''w'',''x'',''y'',''z'', with ''w''<sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''z''<sup>2</sup> = 1. The point (''w'',''x'',''y'',''z'') represents a rotation around the axis directed by the vector (''x'',''y'',''z'') by an angle \n:<math>\\alpha = 2 \\cos^{-1}(w) = 2 \\sin^{-1} \\left (\\sqrt{1-(x^2+y^2+z^2)} \\right ).</math>\n\nThis problem is similar to parameterize the bidimensional surface of a [[sphere]] with two coordinates, such as latitude and longitude. Latitude and longitude are ill-behaved ([[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]]) at the north and south poles, though the poles are not intrinsically different from any other points on the sphere. At the poles (latitudes +90° and&nbsp;−90°), the longitude becomes meaningless. It can be shown that no two-parameter coordinate system can avoid such degeneracy.\n\nThe possible parametrizations candidates include:\n\n*[[Euler angles]] (θ,φ,ψ), representing a product of rotations about the ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' axes;\n*[[Tait–Bryan angles]] (θ,φ,ψ), representing a product of rotations about the ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' axes;\n*[[Axis angle]] pair ('''''n''''', θ) of a unit vector representing an axis, and an angle of rotation about it;\n*A [[quaternion]] '''q''' of length 1 (cf. [[Versor]], [[quaternions and spatial rotation]], [[3-sphere]]), the components of which are also called [[Euler–Rodrigues parameters]];\n*a 3 × 3 [[skew-symmetric matrix]], via exponentiation; the 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrices are the [[Lie algebra]] SO(3), and this is the [[exponential map in Lie theory]];\n*Cayley rational parameters, based on the [[Cayley transform]], usable in all characteristics;\n*[[Möbius transformation]]s, <math>w=\\frac{az+b}{cz+d},</math> acting on the [[Riemann sphere]].\n\n===Problems of the parametrizations===\nThere are problems in using these as more than local charts, to do with their multiple-valued nature, and singularities. That is, one must be careful above all to work only with [[diffeomorphism]]s in the definition of [[chart (topology)|chart]].  Problems of this sort are inevitable, since SO(3) is diffeomorphic to [[real projective space]] '''P'''<sup>3</sup>('''R'''), which is a quotient of '''S'''<sup>3</sup> by identifying antipodal points, and charts try to model a manifold using '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThis explains why, for example, the Euler angles appear to give a variable in the 3-[[torus]], and the unit quaternions in a [[3-sphere]]. The uniqueness of the representation by Euler angles breaks down at some points (cf. [[gimbal lock]]), while the quaternion representation is always a [[Double covering group|double cover]], with ''q'' and −''q'' giving the same rotation.\n\nIf we use a skew-symmetric matrix, every 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrix is determined by 3 parameters, and so at first glance, the parameter space is '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. [[Matrix exponential|Exponentiating]] such a matrix results in an orthogonal 3 × 3 matrix of determinant 1 – in other words, a rotation matrix, but this is a many-to-one map. Note that it is not a [[covering map]] – while it is a local homeomorphism near the origin, it is not a covering map at rotations by 180 degrees. It is possible to restrict these matrices to a ball around the origin in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> so that rotations do not exceed 180 degrees, and this will be one-to-one, except for rotations by 180 degrees, which correspond to the boundary '''S'''<sup>2</sup>, and these identify antipodal points – this is the [[Cut locus (Riemannian manifold)|cut locus]].  The 3-ball with this identification of the boundary is '''P'''<sup>3</sup>('''R''').  A similar situation holds for applying a Cayley transform to the skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nAxis angle gives parameters in '''S'''<sup>2</sup> × '''S'''<sup>1</sup>; if we replace the unit vector by the actual axis of rotation, so that '''''n''''' and −'''''n''''' give the same axis line, the set of axis becomes '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''R'''), the [[real projective plane]]. But since rotations around '''''n''''' and −'''''n''''' are parameterized by opposite values of θ, the result is an '''S'''<sup>1</sup> bundle over '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''R'''), which turns out to be '''P'''<sup>3</sup>('''R''').\n\nFractional linear transformations use four complex parameters, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'', with the condition that ''ad''−''bc'' is non-zero.  Since multiplying all four parameters by the same complex number does not change the parameter, we can insist that ''ad''−''bc''=1. This suggests writing (''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'') as a 2 × 2 complex matrix of determinant 1, that is, as an element of the special linear group SL(2,'''C''').  But not all such matrices produce rotations: conformal maps on '''S'''<sup>2</sup> are also included.  To only get rotations we insist that ''d'' is the complex conjugate of ''a'', and ''c'' is the negative of the complex conjugate of ''b''.  Then we have two complex numbers, ''a'' and ''b'', subject to |''a''|<sup>2</sup>+|''b''|<sup>2</sup>=1.  If we write ''a''+''bj'', this is a quaternion of unit length.\n\nUltimately, since '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is not '''P'''<sup>3</sup>('''R'''), there will be a problem with each of these approaches.  In some cases, we need to remember that certain parameter values result in the same rotation, and to remove this issue, boundaries must be set up, but then a path through this region in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> must then suddenly jump to a different region when it crosses a boundary.  Gimbal lock is a problem when the derivative of the map is not full rank, which occurs with Euler angles and Tait–Bryan angles, but not for the other choices.  The quaternion representation has none of these problems (being a two-to-one mapping everywhere), but it has 4 parameters with a condition (unit length), which sometimes makes it harder to see the three degrees of freedom available.\n\n===Applications===\nOne area in which these considerations, in some form, become inevitable, is the [[kinematics]] of a [[rigid body]]. One can take as definition the idea of a [[curve]] in the [[Euclidean group]] ''E''(3) of three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], starting at the identity (initial position). The translation subgroup ''T'' of ''E''(3) is a [[normal subgroup]], with quotient SO(3) if we look at the subgroup [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|''E''<sup>+</sup>(3)]] of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]] only (which is reasonable in kinematics). The translational part can be decoupled from the rotational part in standard Newtonian kinematics by considering the motion of the center of mass, and rotations of the rigid body about the center of mass. Therefore, any rigid body movement leads directly to SO(3), when we factor out the translational part.\n\nThese identifications illustrate that SO(3) is [[connectedness|connected]] but not [[simply connected]]. As to the latter, in the ball with antipodal surface points identified, consider the path running from the \"north pole\" straight through the center down to the south pole. This is a closed loop, since the north pole and the south pole are identified. This loop cannot be shrunk to a point, since no matter how you deform the loop, the start and end point have to remain antipodal, or else the loop will \"break open\". In terms of rotations, this loop represents a continuous sequence of rotations about the ''z''-axis starting and ending at the identity rotation (i.e. a series of rotations through an angle φ where φ runs from 0 to 2π).\n\nSurprisingly, if you run through the path twice, i.e., from north pole down to south pole and back to the north pole so that φ runs from 0 to 4π, you get a closed loop which ''can'' be shrunk to a single point: first move the paths continuously to the ball's surface, still connecting north pole to south pole twice. The second half of the path can then be mirrored over to the antipodal side without changing the path at all. Now we have an ordinary closed loop on the surface of the ball, connecting the north pole to itself along a great circle. This circle can be shrunk to the north pole without problems. The [[Plate trick|Balinese plate trick]] and similar tricks demonstrate this practically.\n\nThe same argument can be performed in general, and it shows that the [[fundamental group]] of SO(3) is [[cyclic group]] of order 2. In [[physics]] applications, the non-triviality of the fundamental group allows for the existence of objects known as [[spinor]]s, and is an important tool in the development of the [[spin-statistics theorem]].\n\nThe [[Covering space#Universal covers|universal cover]] of SO(3) is a [[Lie group]] called [[spinor group|Spin(3)]]. The group Spin(3) is isomorphic to the [[special unitary group]] SU(2); it is also diffeomorphic to the unit [[3-sphere]] '''S'''<sup>3</sup> and can be understood as the group of [[quaternion|unit quaternions]] (i.e. those with [[absolute value]] 1). The connection between quaternions and rotations, commonly exploited in [[computer graphics]], is explained in [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s. The map from '''S'''<sup>3</sup> onto SO(3) that identifies antipodal points of '''S'''<sup>3</sup> is a [[surjective]] [[homomorphism]] of Lie groups, with [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] {±1}. Topologically, this map is a two-to-one [[covering map]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atlas (topology)]]\n* [[Rotation (mathematics)]]\n* [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Euclidean symmetries]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Rotation in three dimensions]]"

Since '''C'''<sup>&times;</sup> is [[abelian group|abelian]], it follows that '''T''' is as well.  The circle group is also the group '''U(1)''' of 1&times;1 complex-valued [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]]; these [[Group action (mathematics)|act]] on the complex plane by rotation about the origin.  The circle group can be parametrized by the angle &theta; of rotation by\n:<math>\\theta\\mapsto z = e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta.</math>\nThis is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] for the circle group.\n\nThe circle group plays a central role in [[Pontryagin duality]], and in the theory of [[Lie group]]s.\n\nThe notation '''T''' for the circle group stems from the fact that, with the standard topology (see below), the circle group is a 1-[[torus]]. More generally '''T'''<sup>''n''</sup> (the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of '''T''' with itself ''n'' times) is geometrically an ''n''-torus.\n\n== Elementary introduction ==\n<!-- this section is intended to be accessible to a curious high school student -->\n\n[[Image:Circle-group.svg|thumb|200px|Multiplication on the circle group is equivalent to addition of angles]]\n\nOne way to think about the circle group is that it describes how to add ''angles'', where only angles between 0° and 360° are permitted. For example, the diagram illustrates how to add 150° to 270°. The answer should be 150° + 270° = 420°, but when thinking in terms of the circle group, we need to \"forget\" the fact that we have wrapped once around the circle. Therefore, we adjust our answer by 360° which gives 420° = 60° ([[Modular arithmetic|mod]] 360°).\n\nAnother description is in terms of ordinary addition, where only numbers between 0 and 1 are allowed (with 1 corresponding to a full rotation). To achieve this, we might need to throw away digits occurring before the decimal point. For example, when we work out 0.784 + 0.925 + 0.446, the answer should be 2.155, but we throw away the leading 2, so the answer (in the circle group) is just 0.155.\n\n==Topological and analytic structure==\nThe circle group is more than just an abstract algebraic object. It has a [[natural topology]] when regarded as a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of the complex plane. Since multiplication and inversion are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous functions]] on '''C'''<sup>&times;</sup>, the circle group has the structure of a [[topological group]]. Moreover, since the unit circle is a [[closed subset]] of the complex plane, the circle group is a closed subgroup of '''C'''<sup>&times;</sup> (itself regarded as a topological group).\n\nOne can say even more. The circle is a 1-dimensional real [[manifold]] and multiplication and inversion are [[analytic function|real-analytic maps]] on the circle. This gives the circle group the structure of a [[one-parameter group]], an instance of a [[Lie group]]. In fact, [[up to]] isomorphism, it is the unique 1-dimensional [[compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]] Lie group. Moreover, every ''n''-dimensional compact, connected, abelian Lie group is isomorphic to '''T'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n==Isomorphisms==\nThe circle group shows up in a variety of forms in mathematics. We list some of the more common forms here. Specifically, we show that\n\n:<math>\\mathbb T \\cong \\mbox{U}(1) \\cong \\mathbb R/\\mathbb Z \\cong \\mbox{SO}(2).</math>\n\nNote that the slash (/) denotes here  [[quotient group]].\n\nThe set of all 1&times;1 [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] clearly coincides with the circle group; the unitary condition is equivalent to the condition that its element have absolute value 1. Therefore, the circle group is canonically isomorphic to U(1), the first [[unitary group]].\n\nThe [[exponential function]] gives rise to a [[group homomorphism]] exp : '''R''' → '''T''' from the additive real numbers '''R''' to the circle group '''T''' via the map\n\n:<math>\\theta \\mapsto e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta.</math>\n\nThe last equality is [[Euler's formula]] or the complex exponential. The real number θ corresponds to the angle (in [[radian]]s) on the unit circle as measured counterclockwise from the positive ''x''-axis. That this map is a homomorphism follows from the fact that the multiplication of unit complex numbers corresponds to addition of angles:\n\n:<math>e^{i\\theta_1}e^{i\\theta_2} = e^{i(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)}.\\,</math>\n\nThis exponential map is clearly a [[surjective]] function from '''R''' to '''T'''. It is not, however, [[injective]]. The [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of this map is the set of all [[integer]] multiples of 2π. By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] we then have that\n\n:<math>\\mathbb T \\cong \\mathbb R/2\\pi\\mathbb Z.\\,</math>\n\nAfter rescaling we can also say that '''T''' is isomorphic to '''R'''/'''Z'''.\n\nIf complex numbers are realized as 2&times;2 real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] (see [[complex number]]), the unit complex numbers correspond to 2&times;2 [[orthogonal matrices]] with unit [[determinant]]. Specifically, we have\n\n:<math> e^{i\\theta} \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} =f(e^{i\\theta}).</math>\n\nThis function shows that the circle group is [[Group_isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(2) since\n:<math> f(e^{i\\theta_1} e^{i\\theta_2}) = \n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2) & -\\sin(\\theta_1+\\theta_2) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta_1+\\theta_2) & \\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2) \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} =\nf(e^{i\\theta_1}) \\times f(e^{i\\theta_2}) </math> where <math>\\times</math> is matrix multiplication.\nThis isomorphism has the geometric interpretation that multiplication by a unit complex number is a proper rotation in the complex (and real) plane, and every such rotation is of this form.\n\n==Properties==\nEvery compact Lie group ''G'' of dimension&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 has a [[subgroup]] isomorphic to the circle group. That means that, thinking in terms of [[symmetry]], a compact symmetry group acting ''continuously'' can be expected to have one-parameter circle subgroups acting; the consequences in physical systems are seen for example at [[rotational invariance]], and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].\n\nThe circle group has many [[subgroup]]s, but its only proper [[closed set|closed]] subgroups consist of [[root of unity|roots of unity]]: For each integer ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, the ''n''th roots of unity form a [[cyclic group]] of order&nbsp;''n'', which is unique up to isomorphism.\n\n==Representations==\nThe [[group representation|representations]] of the circle group are easy to describe. It follows from [[Schur's lemma]] that the [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[complex number|complex]] representations of an abelian group are all 1-dimensional. Since the circle group is compact, any representation ρ&nbsp;:&nbsp;'''T'''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''GL''(1,&nbsp;'''C''')&nbsp;≅&nbsp;'''C'''<sup>&times;</sup>, must take values in ''U''(1)&nbsp;≅&nbsp;'''T'''. Therefore, the irreducible representations of the circle group are just the [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] from the circle group to itself.\n\nThese representations are all inequivalent.

Here we only have positive integers ''n'' since the representation <math>\\rho_{-n}</math> is equivalent to <math>\\rho_n</math>.\n\n==Group structure==\nThe circle group '''T''' is a [[divisible group]]. Its [[torsion subgroup]] is given by the set of all ''n''th [[roots of unity]] for all ''n'', and is isomorphic to '''Q'''/'''Z'''. The [[Divisible group#Structure theorem of divisible groups|structure theorem]] for divisible groups and the [[axiom of choice]] together tell us that '''T''' is isomorphic to the [[direct sum of abelian groups|direct sum]] of '''Q'''/'''Z''' with a number of copies of '''Q'''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The number of copies of '''Q''' must be ''c'' (the [[cardinality of the continuum]]) in order for the cardinality of the direct sum to be correct. But the direct sum of ''c'' copies of '''Q''' is isomorphic to '''R''', as '''R''' is a [[vector space]] of dimension ''c'' over '''Q'''.

A group is complex according to whether its Lie algebra is complex. The '''real classical groups''' refers to all of the classical groups since any Lie algebra is a real algebra. The '''compact classical groups''' are the [[compact real form]]s of the complex classical groups. These are, in turn, {{math|SU(''n'')}}, {{math|SO(''n'')}} and {{math|Sp(''m'')}}. One characterization of the compact real form is in terms of the Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}}. If {{math|'''g''' {{=}} '''u''' + ''i'''''u'''}}, the [[complexification]] of {{math|'''u'''}}, then if the connected group {{math|''K''}} generated by {{math|exp(''X''): ''X'' ∈ '''u'''}} is a compact, {{math|''K''}} is a compact real form.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe classical groups can uniformly be characterized in a different way using [[real form]]s. The classical groups (here with the determinant 1 condition, but this is not necessary) are the following:\n:The complex linear [[algebraic groups]] {{math|SL(''n'', '''C'''), SO(''n'', '''C''')}}, and {{math|Sp(''n'', '''C''')}} together with their [[real form]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|Wallach|2009}} See end of chapter 1.</ref>\nFor instance, {{math|SO<sup>∗</sup>(2''n'')}} is a real form of {{math|SO(2''n'', '''C''')}}, {{math|SU(''p'', ''q'')}} is a real form of {{math|SL(''n'', '''C''')}}, and {{math|SL(''n'', '''H''')}} is a real form of {{math|SL(2''n'', '''C''')}}. Without the determinant 1 condition, replace the special linear groups with the corresponding general linear groups in the characterization. The algebraic groups in question are Lie groups, but the \"algebraic\" qualifier is needed to get the right notion of \"real form\".\n\n== Bilinear and sesquilinear forms ==\n{{main|Bilinear form|Sesquilinear form}}\nThe classical groups are defined in terms of forms defined on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, {{math|'''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, and {{math|'''H'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are the [[field (mathematics)|field]]s of the [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s. The [[quaternion]]s, {{math|'''H'''}}, do not constitute a field because multiplication does not commute; they form a [[division ring]] or a '''skew field''' or '''non-commutative field'''. However, it is still possible to define matrix quaternionic groups. For this reason, a vector space {{math|''V''}} is allowed to be defined over {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}}, as well as {{math|'''H'''}} below. In the case of {{math|'''H'''}}, {{math|''V''}} is a ''right'' vector space to make possible the representation of the group action as matrix multiplication from the ''left'', just as for {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}}p. 93.</ref>\n\nA form {{math|''φ'': ''V'' × ''V'' → ''F''}} on some finite-dimensional right vector space over {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''R''', '''C'''}}, or {{math|'''H'''}} is [[bilinear form|bilinear]] if \n:<math>\\varphi(x\\alpha, y\\beta) = \\alpha\\varphi(x, y)\\beta, \\quad \\forall x,y \\in V, \\forall \\alpha,\\beta \\in F.</math> and if \n:<math>\\varphi(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2)=\\varphi(x_1,y_1)+\\varphi(x_1,y_2)+\\varphi(x_2,y_1)+\\varphi(x_2,y_2),\\quad \\forall x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \\in V. </math>\nIt is called '''[[semi-bilinear form|sesquilinear]]''' if \n:<math>\\varphi(x\\alpha, y\\beta) = \\bar{\\alpha}\\varphi(x, y)\\beta, \\quad \\forall x,y \\in V, \\forall \\alpha,\\beta \\in F.</math> and if :<math>\\varphi(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2)=\\varphi(x_1,y_1)+\\varphi(x_1,y_2)+\\varphi(x_2,y_1)+\\varphi(x_2,y_2) \\forall x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \\in V. </math>\n\n\nThese conventions are chosen because they work in all cases considered. An [[automorphism]] of {{math|''φ''}} is a map {{math|''Α''}} in the set of linear operators on {{math|''V''}} such that\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\varphi(Ax, Ay) = \\varphi(x, y), \\quad \\forall x,y \\in V.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nThe set of all automorphisms of {{math|''φ''}} form a group, it is called the automorphism group of {{math|''φ''}}, denoted {{math|Aut(''φ'')}}. This leads to a preliminary definition of a classical group:\n:'''''A classical group is a group that preserves a bilinear or sesquilinear form on finite-dimensional vector spaces over''''' {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}}.\nThis definition has some redundancy. In the case of {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''R'''}}, bilinear is equivalent to sesquilinear. In the case of {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''H'''}}, there are no non-zero bilinear forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 105</ref>\n\n=== Symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hermitian, and skew-Hermitian forms===\nA form is '''symmetric''' if\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = \\varphi(y, x).</math>\nIt is '''skew-symmetric''' if\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = -\\varphi(y, x).</math>\nIt is '''Hermitian''' if\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = \\overline{\\varphi(y, x)}</math>\nFinally, it is '''skew-Hermitian''' if\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = -\\overline{\\varphi(y, x)}.</math>\n\nA bilinear form {{math|''φ''}} is uniquely a sum of a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form. A transformation preserving {{math|''φ''}} preserves both parts separately. The groups preserving symmetric and skew-symmetric forms can thus be studied separately. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to Hermitian and skew-Hermitian forms. For this reason, for the purposes of classification, only purely symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hermitian, or skew-Hermitian forms are considered. The '''normal forms''' of the forms correspond to specific suitable choices of bases. These are bases giving the following normal forms in coordinates:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\text{Bilinear symmetric form in (pseudo-)orthonormal basis:} \\qquad \\varphi(x, y) &= \\pm \\xi_1\\eta_1 \\pm \\xi_2\\eta_2 \\pm \\cdots \\pm \\xi_n\\eta_n, \\,\\,(\\mathbf R)\\\\\n\\text{Bilinear symmetric form in orthonormal basis:} \\qquad \\varphi(x, y) &= \\xi_1\\eta_1 +\\xi_2\\eta_2 +\\cdots +\\xi_n\\eta_n, \\,\\,(\\mathbf C)\\\\\n\\text{Bilinear skew-symmetric in symplectic basis:} \\qquad \\varphi(x, y) &= \\xi_1\\eta_{m + 1} + \\xi_2\\eta_{m + 2} +\\cdots + \\xi_m\\eta_{2m = n} \\\\\n&- \\xi_{m + 1}\\eta_1 - \\xi_{m + 2}\\eta_2 -\\cdots - \\xi_{2m = n}\\eta_m,\\,\\,(\\mathbf R, \\mathbf C)\\\\\n\\text{Sesquilinear Hermitian:}\\qquad  \\varphi(x, y) &= \\pm \\bar{\\xi_1}\\eta_1 \\pm \\bar{\\xi_2}\\eta_2 \\pm \\cdots \\pm \\bar{\\xi_n}\\eta_n, \\,\\,(\\mathbf C, \\mathbf H)\\\\\n\\text{Sesquilinear skew-Hermitian:} \\qquad \\varphi(x, y) &= \\bar{\\xi_1}\\mathbf{j}\\eta_1 + \\bar{\\xi_2}\\mathbf{j}\\eta_2 +\\cdots + \\bar{\\xi_n}\\mathbf{j}\\eta_n, \\,\\,(\\mathbf H).\\end{align}</math>\nThe {{math|'''j'''}} in the skew-Hermitian form is the third basis element in the basis {{math|('''1''', '''i''', '''j''', '''k''')}} for {{math|'''H'''}}. Proof of existence of these bases and [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the independence of the number of plus- and minus-signs, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, in the symmetric and Hermitian forms, as well as the presence or absence of the fields in each expression, can be found in {{harvtxt|Rossmann|2002}} or {{harvtxt|Goodman|Wallach|2009}}. The pair {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}, and sometimes {{math|''p'' − ''q''}}, is called the '''signature''' of the form.\n\n'''Explanation of occurrence of the fields''' {{math|'''R''', '''C''', '''H'''}}: There are no nontrivial bilinear forms over {{math|'''H'''}}. In the symmetric bilinear case, only forms over {{math|'''R'''}} have a signature. In other words, a complex bilinear form with \"signature\" {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} can, by a change of basis, be reduced to a form where all signs are \"{{math|+}}\" in the above expression, whereas this is impossible in the real case, in which {{math|''p'' − ''q''}} is independent of the basis when put into this form. However, Hermitian forms have basis-independent signature in both the complex and the quaternionic case. (The real case reduces to the symmetric case.) A skew-Hermitian form on a complex vector space is rendered Hermitian by multiplication by {{mvar|i}}, so in this case, only {{math|'''H'''}} is interesting.\n\n==Automorphism groups==\n[[Image:Hermann Weyl ETH-Bib Portr 00890.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Hermann Weyl]], the author of [[The Classical Groups]]. Weyl made substantial contributions to the representation theory of the classical groups.]]\nThe first section presents the general framework. The other sections exhaust the qualitatively different cases that arise as automorphism groups of bilinear and sesquilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces over {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}.\n\n===Aut(''φ'') – the automorphism group===\nAssume that {{math|''φ''}} is a [[non-degenerate]] form on a finite-dimensional vector space {{math|''V''}} over {{math|'''R''', '''C'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}}. The automorphism group is defined, based on condition ({{EquationNote|1}}), as\n:<math>\\mathrm{Aut}(\\varphi) = \\{A \\in \\mathrm{GL}(V) : \\varphi(Ax, Ay) = \\varphi(x, y), \\quad \\forall x,y \\in V\\}.</math>\n\nEvery {{math|''A'' ∈ ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}} has an adjoint {{math|''A''<sup>''φ''</sup>}} with respect to {{math|''φ''}} defined by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\varphi(Ax, y) = \\varphi(x, A^\\varphi y), \\qquad x, y \\in V.</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\nUsing this definition in condition ({{EquationNote|1}}), the automorphism group is seen to be given by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\varphi) = \\{A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(V): A^\\varphi A = 1\\}.</math><ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 91</ref>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nFix a basis for {{math|''V''}}. In terms of this basis, put\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = \\sum \\xi_i\\varphi_{ij}\\eta_j</math>\nwhere {{math|ξ<sub>''i''</sub>, η<sub>''j''</sub>}} are the components of {{math|''x'', ''y''}}. This is appropriate for the bilinear forms. Sesquilinear forms have similar expressions and are treated separately later. In matrix notation one finds\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = x^{\\mathrm T}\\Phi y</math>\nand\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>A^\\varphi = \\Phi^{-1}A^{\\mathrm T}\\Phi</math><ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 92</ref>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\nfrom ({{EquationNote|2}}) where {{math|Φ}} is the matrix {{math|(''φ<sub>ij</sub>'')}}. The non-degeneracy condition means precisely that {{math|Φ}} is invertible, so the adjoint always exists. {{math|Aut(''φ'')}} expressed with this becomes\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\varphi) = \\{A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(V): \\Phi^{-1}A^{\\mathrm T}\\Phi A = 1\\}.</math>\nThe Lie algebra {{math|'''aut'''(''φ'')}} of the automorphism groups can be written down immediately. Abstractly, {{math|''X'' ∈ '''aut'''(''φ'')}} if and only if\n:<math>(e^{tX})^\\varphi e^{tX} = 1</math>\nfor all {{math|''t''}}, corresponding to the condition in ({{EquationNote|3}}) under the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential mapping]] of Lie algebras, so that\n:<math>\\mathfrak{aut}(\\varphi) = \\{X \\in M_n(V): X^\\varphi = -X\\},</math>\nor in a basis\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mathfrak{aut}(\\varphi) = \\{X \\in M_n(V): \\Phi^{-1}X^{\\mathrm T}\\Phi = -X\\}</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\nas is seen using the [[power series]] expansion of the exponential mapping and the linearity of the involved operations. Conversely, suppose that {{math|''X'' ∈ '''aut'''(''φ'')}}. Then, using the above result, {{math|''φ''(''Xx'', ''y'') {{=}} φ(''x'', ''X''<sup>''φ''</sup>''y'') {{=}} -φ(''x'', ''Xy'')}}. Thus the Lie algebra can be characterized without reference to a basis, or the adjoint, as\n:<math>\\mathfrak{aut}(\\varphi) = \\{X \\in M_n(V): \\varphi(Xx, y) = -\\varphi(x, Xy),\\quad \\forall x,y \\in V\\}.</math>\n\nThe normal form for {{math|''φ''}} will be given for each classical group below. From that normal form, the matrix {{math|Φ}} can be read off directly. Consequently, expressions for the adjoint and the Lie algebras can be obtained using formulas ({{EquationNote|4}}) and ({{EquationNote|5}}). This is demonstrated below in most of the non-trivial cases.\n\n=== Bilinear case ===\nWhen the form is symmetric, {{math|Aut(''φ'')}} is called {{math|O(''φ'')}}. When it is skew-symmetric then {{math|Aut(''φ'')}} is called {{math|Sp(''φ'')}}. This applies to the real and the complex cases. The quaternionic case is empty since no nonzero bilinear forms exists on quaternionic vector spaces.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 105</ref>\n\n====Real case====\nThe real case breaks up into two cases, the symmetric and the antisymmetric forms that should be treated separately.\n\n=====O(''p'', ''q'') and O(''n'') &ndash; the orthogonal groups=====\n{{main|Orthogonal group|Indefinite orthogonal group}}\nIf {{math|''φ''}} is symmetric and the vector space is real, a basis may be chosen so that\n:<math>\\varphi(x, y) = \\pm \\xi_1\\eta_1 \\pm \\xi_1\\eta_1 \\cdots \\pm \\xi_n\\eta_n.</math>\nThe number of plus and minus-signs are independent of the particular basis.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 107.</ref> In the case {{math|''V'' {{=}} '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} one writes {{math|O(''φ'') {{=}} O(''p'', ''q'')}} where {{math|''p''}} is the number of plus signs and {{math|''q''}} is the number of minus-signs, {{math|''p'' + ''q'' {{=}} ''n''}}. If {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}} the notation is {{math|O(''n'')}}. The matrix {{math|Φ}} is in this case\n:<math>\\Phi = \\left(\\begin{matrix}I_p & 0 \\\\0 & -I_q\\end{matrix}\\right) \\equiv I_{p,q}</math>\nafter reordering the basis if necessary.

When the [[field (mathematics)|field]]&nbsp;''F'' of coefficients of the matrix group is either real number or complex numbers, these groups are just the classical Lie groups. When the ground field is a [[finite field]], then the classical groups are [[groups of Lie type]]. These groups play an important role in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. Also, one may consider classical groups over a unital [[associative algebra]]&nbsp;''R'' over ''F''; where ''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[quaternion|'''H''']] (an algebra over reals) represents an important case. For the sake of generality the article will refer to groups over ''R'', where ''R'' may be the ground field&nbsp;''F'' itself.\n\nConsidering their abstract group theory, many linear groups have a \"'''special'''\" subgroup, usually consisting of the elements of [[determinant]] 1 over the ground field, and most of them have associated \"'''projective'''\" quotients, which are the quotients by the center of the group. For orthogonal groups in characteristic 2 \"S\" has a different meaning.\n\nThe word \"'''general'''\" in front of a group name usually means that the group is allowed to multiply some sort of form by a constant, rather than leaving it fixed. The subscript ''n'' usually indicates the dimension of the [[module (algebra)|module]] on which the group is acting; it is a [[vector space]] if ''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F''. Caveat: this notation clashes somewhat with the ''n'' of Dynkin diagrams, which is the rank.\n\n===General and special linear groups===\n\nThe [[general linear group]] GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is the group of all ''R''-linear automorphisms of ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>. There is  a subgroup: the [[special linear group]] SL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), and their quotients: the [[projective general linear group]] PGL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') = GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')/Z(GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')) and the [[projective special linear group]] PSL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') = SL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')/Z(SL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')). The projective special linear group PSL<sub>''n''</sub>(''F'') over a field ''F'' is simple for ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2, except for the two cases when ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and the field has order{{clarify|date=February 2014}} 2 or&nbsp;3.\n\n===Unitary groups===\n\nThe [[unitary group]] U<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is a group preserving a [[sesquilinear form]] on a module. There is a subgroup, the [[special unitary group]] SU<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') and their quotients the [[projective unitary group]] PU<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') = U<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')/Z(U<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')) and the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') = SU<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')/Z(SU<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''))\n\n===Symplectic groups===\n\nThe [[symplectic group]] Sp<sub>2''n''</sub>(''R'') preserves a [[skew symmetric form]] on a module. It has a quotient, the [[projective symplectic group]] PSp<sub>2''n''</sub>(''R''). The [[general symplectic group]] GSp<sub>2''n''</sub>(''R'')  consists of the automorphisms of a module multiplying  a skew symmetric form  by some invertible scalar. The projective symplectic group PSp<sub>2''n''</sub>('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) over a finite field is simple for ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1, except for the cases of PSp<sub>2</sub> over the fields of two and three elements.\n\n===Orthogonal groups===\n\nThe [[orthogonal group]] O<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') preserves a non-degenerate quadratic form on a module. There is a subgroup, the [[special orthogonal group]] SO<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') and quotients, the [[projective orthogonal group]] PO<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), and the [[projective special orthogonal group]] PSO<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''). In characteristic 2 the determinant is always 1, so the special orthogonal group is often defined as the subgroup of elements of [[Orthogonal group|Dickson invariant]] 1.\n\nThere is a nameless group often denoted by Ω<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') consisting of the elements of the orthogonal group of elements of [[spinor norm]] 1, with corresponding subgroup and quotient groups SΩ<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''),  PΩ<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''),  PSΩ<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''). (For positive definite quadratic forms over the reals, the group Ω happens to be the same as the orthogonal group, but in general it is smaller.) There is also a double cover of Ω<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), called the [[pin group]]  Pin<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), and it has a subgroup called the [[spin group]] Spin<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''). The [[general orthogonal group]] GO<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') consists of the automorphisms of a module multiplying a quadratic form by some invertible scalar.\n\n===Notational conventions===\n{{details|Group of Lie type#Notation issues}}\n\n==Contrast with exceptional Lie groups==\n\nContrasting with the classical Lie groups are the [[exceptional Lie groups]], G<sub>2</sub>,  F<sub>4</sub>,  E<sub>6</sub>,  E<sub>7</sub>,  E<sub>8</sub>, which share their abstract properties, but not their familiarity.<ref>Wybourne, B.

Compact groups are a natural generalization of [[finite group]]s with the [[discrete topology]] and have properties that carry over in significant fashion. Compact groups have a well-understood theory, in relation to [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]s and [[representation theory]].\n\nIn the following we will assume all groups are [[Hausdorff space]]s.\n\n==Compact Lie groups==\n\n[[Lie group]]s form a very nice class of topological groups, and the compact Lie groups have a particularly well-developed theory. Basic examples of compact Lie groups include<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.2</ref>\n* the [[circle group]] '''T''' and the [[torus group]]s '''T'''<sup>''n''</sup>,\n* the [[orthogonal group]]s O(''n''), the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n'') and its covering [[spin group]] Spin(''n''),\n* the [[unitary group]] U(''n'') and the [[special unitary group]] SU(''n''),\n* the [[symplectic group]] Sp(''n''),\n* the compact forms of the [[exceptional Lie group]]s: [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], and [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]],\nThe [[classification theorem]] of compact Lie groups states that up to finite [[group extension|extensions]] and finite [[covering group|covers]] this exhausts the list of examples (which already includes some redundancies). This classification is described in more detail in the next subsection.\n\n===Classification===\n\nGiven any compact Lie group ''G'' one can take its [[identity component]] ''G''<sub>0</sub>, which is [[connected space|connected]]. The [[quotient group]] ''G''/''G''<sub>0</sub> is the group of components &pi;<sub>0</sub>(''G'') which must be finite since ''G'' is compact. We therefore have a finite extension\n:<math>1\\to G_0 \\to G \\to \\pi_0(G) \\to 1.\\,</math>\nMeanwhile, for connected compact Lie groups, we have the following result:<ref>{{harvnb|Bröcker|1985}} Chapter V, Sections 7 and 8</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': Every connected compact Lie group is the quotient by a finite central subgroup of a product of a simply connected compact Lie group and a torus.\nThus, the classification of connected compact Lie groups can in principle be reduced to knowledge of the simply connected compact Lie groups together with information about their centers. (For information about the center, see the section below on fundamental group and center.)\n\nFinally, every compact, connected, simply-connected Lie group ''K'' is a product of compact, connected, simply-connected [[simple Lie group]]s ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> each of which is isomorphic to exactly one of the following:\n*The [[Symplectic_group#Sp.28n.29|compact symplectic group]] <math>\\operatorname{Sp}(n),\\,n\\geq 1</math>\n*The [[special unitary group]] <math>\\operatorname{SU}(n),\\,n\\geq 3</math>\n*The [[spin group]] <math>\\operatorname{Spin}(n),\\,n\\geq 7</math>\nor one of the five exceptional groups [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], and [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]]. The restrictions on ''n'' are to avoid special isomorphisms among the various families for small values of ''n''. For each of these groups, the center is known explicitly. The classification is through the associated [[root system]] (for a fixed maximal torus), which in turn are classified by their [[Dynkin diagram]]s.\n\nThe classification of compact, simply connected Lie groups is the same as the classification of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. Indeed, if ''K'' is a simply connected compact Lie group, then the complexification of the Lie algebra of ''K'' is semisimple. Conversely, every complex semisimple Lie algebra has a compact real form isomorphic to the Lie algebra of a compact, simply connected Lie group.\n\n===Maximal tori and root systems===\n{{see also|Maximal torus|Root system}}\nA key idea in the study of a connected compact Lie group ''K'' is the concept of a ''maximal torus'', that is a subgroup ''T'' of ''K'' that is isomorphic to several copies of <math>S^1</math> and that is not contained in any larger subgroup of this type. A basic example is the case <math>K=SU(n)</math>, in which case we may take <math>T</math> to be the group of diagonal elements in <math>K</math>. A basic result is the ''torus theorem'' which states that every element of <math>K</math> belongs to a maximal torus and that all maximal tori are conjugate.\n\nThe maximal torus in a compact group plays a role analogous to that of the [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras_and_root_systems|Cartan subalgebra]] in a complex semisimple Lie algebra. In particular, once a maximal torus <math>T\\subset K</math> has been chosen, one can define a [[root system]] and a [[Weyl group]] similar to what one has for [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 11</ref> These structures then play an essential role both in the classification of connected compact groups (described above) and in the representation theory of a fixed such group (described below).\n\nThe root systems associated to the simple compact groups appearing in the classification of simply connected compact groups are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.7</ref>\n*The special unitary groups <math>\\operatorname{SU}(n)</math> correspond to the root system <math>A_{n-1}</math>\n*The odd spin groups <math>\\operatorname{Spin}(2n+1)</math> correspond to the root system <math>B_{n}</math>\n*The compact symplectic groups <math>\\operatorname{Sp}(n)</math> correspond to the root system <math>C_{n}</math>\n*The even spin groups <math>\\operatorname{Spin}(2n)</math> correspond to the root system <math>D_{n}</math>\n*The exceptional compact Lie groups correspond to the five exceptional root systems G<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, or E<sub>8</sub>\n\n===Fundamental group and center===\n{{see also|Fundamental group#Lie groups}}\nIt is important to know whether a connected compact Lie group is simply connected, and if not, to determine its [[fundamental group]]. For compact Lie groups, there are [[Fundamental_group#Lie_groups|two basic approaches]] to computing the fundamental group. The first approach applies to the classical compact groups <math>\\operatorname{SU}(n)</math>, <math>\\operatorname{U}(n)</math>, <math>\\operatorname{SO}(n)</math>, and <math>\\operatorname{Sp}(n)</math> and proceeds by induction on <math>n</math>. The second approach uses the root system and applies to all connected compact Lie groups.\n\nIt is also important to know the center of a connected compact Lie group. The center of a classical group <math>G</math> can easily be computed \"by hand,\" and in most cases consists simply of whatever multiples of the identity are in <math>G</math>. (The group SO(2) is an exception—the center is the whole group, even though most elements are not multiples of the identity.) Thus, for example, the center of <math>\\operatorname{SU}(n)</math> consists of ''n''th roots of unity times the identity, a cyclic group of order <math>n</math>.\n\nIn general, the center can be expressed in terms of the root lattice and the kernel of the exponential map for the maximal torus.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.8</ref> The general method shows, for example, that the simply connected compact group corresponding to the exceptional root system <math>G_2</math> has trivial center. Thus, [[G2_(mathematics)|the compact <math>G_2</math> group]] is one of very few simple compact groups that are simultaneously simply connected and center free. (The others are [[F4 (mathematics)|<math>F_4</math>]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|<math>E_8</math>]].)\n\n==Further examples==\n\nAmongst groups that are not Lie groups, and so do not carry the structure of a [[manifold]], examples are the additive group ''Z''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic integer]]s, and constructions from it. In fact any [[profinite group]] is a compact group. This means that [[Galois group]]s are compact groups, a basic fact for the theory of [[algebraic extension]]s in the case of infinite degree.\n\n[[Pontryagin duality]] provides a large supply of examples of compact commutative groups. These are in duality with abelian [[discrete group]]s.\n\n==Haar measure==\n{{see also|Peter–Weyl theorem}}\nCompact groups all carry a [[Haar measure]],<ref>{{Citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = L'intégration dans les groupes topologiques et ses applications | series = Actualités Scientifiques et Industrielles | publisher = Hermann | year = 1940 | place = Paris | volume = 869}}''</ref> which will be invariant by both left and right translation (the [[Haar measure|modulus function]] must be a continuous [[homomorphism]] to [[positive reals]] (ℝ<sup>+</sup>, ×), and so 1). In other words, these groups are [[unimodular group|unimodular]]. Haar measure is easily normalized to be a [[probability measure]], analogous to d&theta;/2&pi; on the circle.\n\nSuch a Haar measure is in many cases easy to compute; for example for orthogonal groups it was known to [[Adolf Hurwitz]], and in the Lie group cases can always be given by an invariant [[differential form]]. In the profinite case there are many subgroups of [[finite index]], and Haar measure of a coset will be the reciprocal of the index. Therefore, integrals are often computable quite directly, a fact applied constantly in [[number theory]].\n\nIf <math>K</math> is a compact group and <math>m</math> is the associated Haar measure, the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]] provides a decomposition of <math>L^2(K,dm)</math> as an orthogonal direct sum of finite-dimensional subspaces of matrix entries for the irreducible representations of <math>K</math>.\n\n==Representation theory==\n\nThe representation theory of compact groups (not necessarily Lie groups and not necessarily connected) was founded by the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]].<ref>{{citation|first1=F.|last1=Peter|first2=H.|last2=Weyl|title=Die Vollständigkeit der primitiven Darstellungen einer geschlossenen kontinuierlichen Gruppe|journal=Math. Ann.|volume=97|year=1927|pages=737–755|doi=10.1007/BF01447892}}.</ref> [[Hermann Weyl]] went on to give the detailed [[character theory]] of the compact connected Lie groups, based on [[maximal torus]] theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Part III</ref> The resulting [[Weyl character formula]] was one of the influential results of twentieth century mathematics. The combination of the Peter–Weyl theorem and the Weyl character formula led Weyl to a complete classification of the representations of a connected compact Lie group; this theory is described in the next section.\n\nA combination of Weyl's work and [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]] gives a survey of the whole representation theory of compact groups ''G'' . That is, by the Peter–Weyl theorem the irreducible [[unitary representation]]s &rho; of ''G'' are into a unitary group (of finite dimension) and the image will be a closed subgroup of the unitary group by compactness. Cartan's theorem states that Im(&rho;) must itself be a Lie subgroup in the unitary group. If ''G'' is not itself a Lie group, there must be a kernel to &rho;. Further one can form an [[inverse system]], for the kernel of &rho; smaller and smaller, of finite-dimensional unitary representations, which identifies ''G'' as an [[inverse limit]] of compact Lie groups. Here the fact that in the limit a [[faithful representation]] of ''G'' is found is another consequence of the Peter–Weyl theorem,\n\nThe unknown part of the representation theory of compact groups is thereby, roughly speaking, thrown back onto the [[complex representations of finite groups]]. This theory is rather rich in detail, but is qualitatively well understood.\n\n==Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group==\nCertain simple examples of the representation theory of compact Lie groups can be worked out by hand, such as the representations of the [[Representation_of_a_Lie_group#An_example:_The_rotation_group_SO.283.29|rotation group SO(3)]], the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|special unitary group SU(2)]], and the [[Clebsch–Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Representations_of_the_SU.283.29_group|special unitary group SU(3)]]. We focus here on the general theory. See also the parallel theory of [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]].\n\nThroughout this section, we fix a connected compact Lie group ''K'' and a [[maximal torus]] ''T'' in ''K''.\n===Representation theory of ''T''===\nSince ''T'' is commutative, [[Schur's lemma]] tells us that each irreducible representation <math>\\rho</math> of ''T'' is one-dimensional:\n:<math>\\rho:T\\rightarrow GL(1;\\mathbb{C})=\\mathbb{C}^*</math>.\nSince, also, ''T'' is compact, <math>\\rho</math> must actually map into <math>S^1\\subset\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nTo describe these representations concretely, we let <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> be the Lie algebra of ''T'' and we write points <math>h\\in T</math> as\n:<math>h=e^{H},\\quad H\\in\\mathfrak{t}</math>.\nIn such coordinates, <math>\\rho</math> will have the form\n:<math>\\rho(e^{H})=e^{i \\lambda(H)}</math>\nfor some linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> on <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>. \n\nNow, since the exponential map <math>H\\mapsto e^{H}</math> is not injective, not every such linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> gives rise to a well-defined map of ''T'' into <math>S^1</math>. Rather, let <math>\\Gamma</math> denote the kernel of the exponential map:\n:<math>\\Gamma=\\{ H\\in\\mathfrak{t}|e^{2\\pi H}=\\operatorname{Id}\\}</math>,\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{Id}</math> is the identity element of ''T''. (We scale the exponential map here by a factor of <math>2\\pi</math> in order to avoid such factors elsewhere.) \nThen for <math>\\lambda</math> to give a well-defined map <math>\\rho</math>, <math>\\lambda</math> must satisfy\n:<math>\\lambda(H)\\in\\mathbb{Z},\\quad H\\in\\Gamma</math>,\nwhere <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> is the set of integers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 12.9</ref> A linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> satisfying this condition is called an '''analytically integral element'''. This integrality condition is related to, but not identical to, the notion of [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|integral element]] in the setting of semisimple Lie algebras.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 12.2</ref>\n\nSuppose, for example, ''T'' is just the group of <math>S^1</math> of complex numbers <math>e^{i\\theta}</math> of absolute value 1. The Lie algebra is the set of pure imaginary numbers, <math>H=i\\theta,\\,\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R},</math> and the kernel of the (scaled) exponential map is the set of numbers of the form <math>in</math> where <math>n</math> is an integer. A linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> takes integer values on all such numbers if and only if it is of the form <math>\\lambda(i\\theta)=k\\theta</math> for some integer <math>k</math>. The irreducible representations of ''T'' in this case are one-dimensional and of the form\n:<math>\\rho(e^{i\\theta})=e^{ik\\theta},\\quad k \\in\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\n===Representation theory of ''K''===\n{{see also|Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras}}\n[[File:A2example.pdf|thumb|Example of the weights of a representation of the group SU(3)]]\n[[Image:meson octet.png|thumb|The \"[[Eightfold Way (physics)|eightfold way]]\" representation of SU(3), as used in particle physics]]\n[[File:Weights_for_A2_root_system.png|thumb|right|Black dots indicate the dominant integral elements for the group SU(3)]]\nWe now let <math>\\Sigma</math> denote a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of ''K'' (over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>). We then consider the restriction of <math>\\Sigma</math> to ''T''. This restriction not irreducible unless <math>\\Sigma</math> is one-dimensional. Nevertheless, the restriction decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations of ''T''. (Note that a given irreducible representation of ''T'' may occur more than once.) Now, each irreducible representation of ''T'' is described by a linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> as in the preceding subsection. If a given <math>\\lambda</math> occurs at least once in the decomposition of the restriction of <math>\\Sigma</math> to ''T'', we call <math>\\lambda</math> a '''weight''' of <math>\\Sigma</math>. The strategy of the representation theory of ''K'' is to classify the irreducible representations in terms of their weights.\n\nWe now briefly describe the structures needed to formulate the theorem; more details can be found in the article on [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|weights in representation theory]]. We need the notion of a '''root system''' for ''K'' (relative to a given maximal torus ''T''). The construction of this root system <math>R\\subset \\mathfrak{t}</math> is very similar to the [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras_and_root_systems|construction for complex semisimple Lie algebras]]. Specifically, the weights are the nonzero weights for the adjoint action of ''T'' on the complexified Lie algebra of ''K''. The root system ''R'' has all the usual properties of a [[root system]], except that the elements of ''R'' may not span <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 11.7</ref> We then choose a base <math>\\Delta</math> for ''R'' and we say that an integral element <math>\\lambda</math> is '''dominant''' if <math>\\lambda(\\alpha)\\ge 0</math> for all <math>\\lambda\\in\\Delta</math>. Finally, we say that one weight is '''higher''' than another if their difference can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of <math>\\Delta</math> with non-negative coefficients.\n\nThe irreducible finite-dimensional representations of ''K'' are then classified by a '''theorem of the highest [[Weight_(representation_theory)|weight]]''',<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 12</ref> which is closely related to the analogous theorem classifying [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]]. The result says that: \n:(1) every irreducible representation has highest weight, \n:(2) the highest weight is always a dominant, analytically integral element, \n:(3) two irreducible representations with the same highest weight are isomorphic, and \n:(4) every dominant, analytically integral element arises as the highest weight of an irreducible representation.\n\nThe theorem of the highest weight for representations of ''K'' is then almost the same as for semisimple Lie algebras, with one notable exception: The concept of an [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Integral_weight|integral element]] is different. The weights <math>\\lambda</math> of a representation <math>\\Sigma</math> are analytically integral in the sense described in the previous subsection. Every analytically integral element is [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Integral_weight|integral]] in the Lie algebra sense, but not the other way around.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 12.2</ref> (This phenomenon reflects that, in general, [[Lie_group–Lie_algebra_correspondence#Lie_group_representations|not every representation]] of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> comes from a representation of the group ''K''.) On the other hand, if ''K'' is simply connected, the set of possible highest weights in the group sense is the same as the set of possible highest weights in the Lie algebra sense.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 13.20</ref>\n\n===The Weyl character formula===\n{{main|Weyl character formula}}\nIf <math>\\Pi:K\\rightarrow\\operatorname{GL}(V)</math> is representation of ''K'', we define the '''character''' of <math>\\Pi</math> to be the function <math>\\Chi :K\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}</math> given by\n:<math>\\Chi(x)=\\operatorname{trace}(\\Pi(x)),\\quad x\\in K</math>.\nThis function is easily seen to be a class function, i.e., <math>\\Chi(xyx^{-1})=\\Chi(y)</math> for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in ''K''. Thus, <math>\\Chi</math> is determined by its restriction to ''T''.\n\nThe study of characters is an important part of the representation theory of compact groups. One crucial result, which is a corollary of the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]], is that the characters form an orthonormal basis for the set of square-integrable class functions in ''K''. A second key result is the [[Weyl character formula]], which gives an explicit formula for the character—or, rather, the restriction of the character to ''T''—in terms of the highest weight of the representation. \n\nIn the closely related representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, the Weyl character formula is an additional result established ''after'' the representations have been classified. In Weyl's analysis of the compact group case, however, the Weyl character formula is actually a crucial part of the classification itself. Specifically, in Weyl's analysis of the representations of ''K'', the hardest part of the theorem—showing that every dominant, analytically integral element is actually the highest weight of some representation—is proved in totally different way from the usual Lie algebra construction using [[Verma_module|Verma modules]]. In Weyl's approach, the construction is based on the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]] and an analytic proof of the [[Weyl character formula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Sections 12.4 and 12.5</ref> Ultimately, the irreducible representations of ''K'' are realized inside the space of continuous functions on ''K''.\n\n===The SU(2) case===\nWe now consider the case of the compact group SU(2). The representations are often considered from the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|Lie algebra point of view]], but we here look at them from the group point of view. We take the maximal torus to be the set of matrices of the form\n:<math> \\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\theta} & 0\\\\\n0 & e^{-i\\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>.\nAccording to the example discussed above in the section on representations of ''T'', the analytically integral elements are labeled by integers, so that the dominant, analytically integral elements are non-negative integers <math>m</math>. The general theory then tells us that for each <math>m</math>, there is a unique irreducible representation of SU(2) with highest weight <math>m</math>. \n\nMuch information about the representation corresponding to a given <math>m</math> is encoded in its character. Now, the Weyl character formula says, [[Weyl_character_formula#The_SU.282.29_case|in this case]], that the character is given by\n:<math>\\Chi\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\theta} & 0\\\\\n0 & e^{-i\\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\\right)=\\frac{\\sin((m+1)\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)}.</math>\nWe can also write the character as sum of exponentials as follows:\n:<math>\\Chi\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\theta} & 0\\\\\n0 & e^{-i\\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\\right)=e^{im\\theta}+e^{i(m-2)\\theta}+\\cdots e^{-i(m-2)\\theta}+e^{-im\\theta}.</math>\n(If we use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series on the above expression and simplify, we obtain the earlier expression.)\n\nFrom this last expression and the standard formula for the [[Weyl_character_formula#Complex_semisimple_Lie_algebras|character in terms of the weights of the representation]], we can read off that the weights of the representation are \n:<math>m,m-2,\\ldots,-(m-2),-m</math>,\neach with multiplicity one. (The weights are the integers appearing in the exponents of the exponentials and the multiplicities are the coefficients of the exponentials.) Since there are <math>m+1</math> weights, each with multiplicity 1, the dimension of the representation is <math>m+1</math>. Thus, we recover much of the information about the representations that is usually obtained from the Lie algebra computation.\n\n===An outline of the proof===\nWe now outline the proof of the theorem of the highest weight, following the original argument of [[Hermann Weyl]]. We continue to let <math>K</math> be a connected compact Lie group and <math>T</math> a fixed maximal torus in <math>K</math>. We focus on the most difficult part of the theorem, showing that every dominant, analytically integral element is the highest weight of some (finite-dimensional) irreducible representation.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Sections 12.4 and 12.5</ref>\n\nThe tools for the proof are the following:\n*The [[Maximal_torus#Properties|torus theorem]].\n*The [[Maximal_torus#Weyl_integral_formula|Weyl integral formula]].\n*The [[Peter–Weyl_theorem#Restriction_to_class_functions|Peter–Weyl theorem for class functions]], which states that the characters of the irreducible representations form an orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable class functions on <math>K</math>.\n\nWith these tools in hand, we proceed with the proof. The first major step in the argument is to prove the [[Weyl character formula]]. The formula states that if <math>\\Pi</math> is an irreducible representation with highest weight <math>\\lambda</math>, then the character <math>\\Chi</math> of <math>\\Pi</math> satisfies:\n: <math>\\Chi(e^H)=\\frac{\\sum_{w\\in W} \\det(w) e^{i\\langle w\\cdot(\\lambda+\\rho),H\\rangle}}{\\sum_{w\\in W} \\det(w) e^{i\\langle w\\cdot\\rho,H\\rangle}}</math>\nfor all <math>H</math> in the Lie algebra of <math>T</math>. Here <math>\\rho</math> is half the sum of the positive roots. (The notation uses the convention of \"real weights\"; this convention requires an explicit factor of <math>i</math> in the exponent.) Weyl's proof of the character formula is analytic in nature and hinges on the fact that the <math>L^2</math> norm of the character is 1. Specifically, if there were any additional terms in the numerator, the Weyl integral formula would force the norm of the character to be greater than 1.\n\nNext, we let <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math> denote the function on the right-hand side of the character formula. We show that ''even if <math>\\lambda</math> is not known to be the highest weight of a representation'', <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math> is a well-defined, Weyl-invariant function on <math>T</math>, which therefore extends to a class function on <math>K</math>. Then using the Weyl integral formula, one can show that as <math>\\lambda</math> ranges over the set of dominant, analytically integral elements, the functions <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math> form an orthonormal family of class functions. We emphasize that do not currently know that every such <math>\\lambda</math> is the highest weight of a representation; nevertheless, the expressions on the right-hand side of the character formula gives a well-defined set of functions <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math>, and these functions are orthonormal.\n\nNow comes the conclusion. The set of all <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math>—with <math>\\lambda</math> ranging over the dominant, analytically integral elements—forms an orthonormal set in the space of square integrable class functions. But by the Weyl character formula, the characters of the irreducible representations form a subset of the <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math>'s. And by the Peter–Weyl theorem, the characters of the irreducible representations form an orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable class functions. If there were some <math>\\lambda</math> that is not the highest weight of a representation, then the corresponding <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math> would not the character of a representation. Thus, the characters would be a ''proper'' subset of the set of <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math>'s. But then we have an impossible situation: an orthonormal ''basis'' (the set of characters of the irreducible representations) would be contained in a strictly larger orthonormal set (the set of <math>\\Phi_\\lambda</math>'s). Thus, every <math>\\lambda</math> must actually be the highest weight of a representation.\n\n==Duality==\n\nThe topic of recovering a compact group from its representation theory is the subject of the [[Tannaka–Krein duality]], now often recast in term of [[tannakian category]] theory.\n\n==From compact to non-compact groups==\n\nThe influence of the compact group theory on non-compact groups was formulated by Weyl in his [[unitarian trick]]. Inside a general [[semisimple Lie group]] there is a [[maximal compact subgroup]], and the representation theory of such groups, developed largely by [[Harish-Chandra]], uses intensively the [[restriction of a representation]] to such a subgroup, and also the model of Weyl's character theory.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Peter–Weyl theorem]]\n*[[Maximal torus]]\n*[[Root system]]\n*[[Locally compact group]]\n*[[p-compact group|''p''-compact group]]\n*[[Protorus]]\n*[[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras]]\n*[[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|Weights in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=Bröcker|first=Theodor|last2=tom Dieck|first2=Tammo|title=Representations of Compact Lie Groups|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|year=1985|volume=98|publisher=Springer}}\n*{{citation|year=2015|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n*{{Citation\n | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = Karl H. \n | last2 =  Morris | first2 =  Sidney A. \n | year = 1998\n | title = The structure of compact groups\n | publisher = de Gruyter\n | location = Berlin\n | isbn = 3-11-015268-1\n}}\n\n[[Category:Topological groups]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Fourier analysis]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''complex reflection group''' is a [[Group (mathematics)|finite group]] acting on a [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector space]] that is generated by '''complex reflections''': non-trivial elements that fix a complex [[hyperplane]] pointwise.\n\nComplex reflection groups arise in the study of the [[invariant theory]] of [[polynomial ring]]s.  In the mid-20th century, they were completely classified in work of Shephard and Todd.  Special cases include the [[symmetric group]] of permutations, the [[dihedral group]]s, and more generally all finite real reflection groups (the [[Coxeter group]]s or [[Weyl group]]s, including the symmetry groups of [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]]).\n\n==Definition==\n\nA (complex) reflection ''r'' (sometimes also called ''pseudo reflection'' or ''unitary reflection'') of a finite-dimensional complex vector space ''V'' is an element <math>r \\in GL(V)</math> of finite order that fixes a complex hyperplane pointwise, that is, the ''fixed-space'' <math>\\operatorname{Fix}(r) := \\operatorname{ker}(r-\\operatorname{Id}_V)</math> has codimension 1.\n\nA ('''finite''') '''complex reflection group''' <math>W \\subseteq GL(V)</math> is a finite subgroup of <math>GL(V)</math> that is generated by reflections.\n\n==Properties==\n\nAny real reflection group becomes a complex reflection group if we extend the scalars from \n'''R''' to '''C'''. In particular all [[Coxeter group]]s or [[Weyl group]]s give examples of complex reflection groups.\n\nA complex reflection group ''W'' is '''irreducible''' if the only ''W''-invariant proper subspace of the corresponding vector space is the origin. In this case, the dimension of the vector space is called the '''rank''' of ''W''.\n\nThe '''Coxeter number''' <math>h</math> of an irreducible complex reflection group ''W'' of rank <math>n</math> is defined as <math>h = \\frac{|\\mathcal{R}|+|\\mathcal{A}|}{n}</math> where <math>\\mathcal{R}</math> denotes the set of reflections and <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> denotes the set of reflecting hyperplanes.\nIn the case of real reflection groups, this definition reduces to the usual definition of the Coxeter number for finite Coxeter systems.\n\n==Classification==\n\nAny complex reflection group is a product of irreducible complex reflection groups, acting on the sum of the corresponding vector spaces. So it is sufficient to classify the irreducible complex reflection groups.\n\nThe irreducible complex reflection groups were classified by  {{Harvs |txt |first=G.

For <math>\\ell</math> being the ''rank'' of the reflection group, the degrees <math>d_1 \\leq d_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq d_\\ell</math> of the generators of the ring of invariants are called ''degrees of W'' and are listed in the column above headed \"degrees\". They also showed that many other invariants of the group are determined by the degrees as follows:\n\n*The center of an irreducible reflection group is cyclic of order equal to the greatest common divisor of the degrees.\n*The order of a complex reflection group is the product of its degrees.\n*The number of reflections is the sum of the degrees minus the rank.\n*An irreducible complex reflection group comes from a real reflection group if and only if it has an invariant of degree 2.\n*The degrees ''d''<sub>i</sub> satisfy the formula <math>\\prod_{i=1}^\\ell(q+d_i-1)= \\sum_{w\\in W}q^{\\dim(V^w)}.</math>\n\n==Codegrees==\n\nFor <math>\\ell</math> being the ''rank'' of the reflection group, the codegrees <math>d^*_1 \\geq d^*_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq d^*_\\ell</math> of W can be defined by\n<math>\\prod_{i=1}^\\ell(q-d^*_i-1)= \\sum_{w\\in W}\\det(w)q^{\\dim(V^w)}.</math>\n\n*For a real reflection group, the codegrees are the degrees minus 2.\n*The number of reflection hyperplanes is the sum of the codegrees plus the rank.\n\n==Well-generated complex reflection groups==\n\nBy definition, every complex reflection group is generated by its reflections.  The set of reflections is not a minimal generating set, however, and every irreducible complex reflection groups of rank {{math|''n''}} has a minimal generating set consisting of either {{math|''n''}} or {{math|''n'' + 1}} reflections.  In the former case, the group is said to be ''well-generated''.\n\nThe property of being well-generated is equivalent to the condition <math>d_i + d^*_i = d_\\ell</math> for all <math>1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell</math>.  Thus, for example, one can read off from the classification that the group {{math|''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')}} is well-generated if and only if ''p'' = 1 or ''m''.\n\nFor irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups, the ''[[Coxeter number]]'' {{math|''h''}} defined above equals the largest degree, <math>h = d_\\ell</math>. A reducible complex reflection group is said to be well-generated if it is a product of irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups. Every finite real reflection group is well-generated.\n\n==Shephard groups==\n\nThe well-generated complex reflection groups include a subset called the ''Shephard groups''.  These groups are the symmetry groups of [[regular complex polytope]]s.  In particular, they include the symmetry groups of regular real polyhedra.  The Shephard groups may be characterized as the complex reflection groups that admit a \"Coxeter-like\" presentation with a linear diagram.  That is, a Shephard group has associated positive integers {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and {{math|''q''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''q''<sub>''n'' − 1</sub>}} such that there is a generating set {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>}} satisfying the relations\n: <math>(s_i)^{p_i} = 1</math> for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n''}},\n: <math> s_i s_j = s_j s_i</math> if <math>|i - j| > 1</math>, \nand\n: <math> s_i s_{i + 1}s_i s_{i + 1} \\cdots = s_{i + 1}s_i s_{i + 1}s_i \\cdots</math> where the products on both sides have {{math|''q''<sub>''i''</sub>}} terms, for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n'' − 1}}.\n\nThis information is sometimes collected in the Coxeter-type symbol {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>[''q''<sub>1</sub>]''p''<sub>2</sub>[''q''<sub>2</sub>] … [''q''<sub>''n'' − 1</sub>]''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, as seen in the table above.\n\nAmong groups in the infinite family {{math|''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')}}, the Shephard groups are those in which {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}}.  There are also 18 exceptional Shephard groups, of which three are real.<ref>[[Peter Orlik]], Victor Reiner, Anne V. Shepler. ''The sign representation for Shephard groups''.

Shephard groups of rank ''n'' group have ''n'' generators.\n\nOrdinary Cartan matrices have diagonal elements 2, while unitary reflections do not have this restriction.<ref>Unitary Reflection Groups,

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Symmetry-based invariance to continuous group action}}\nIn [[mathematics]], '''continuous symmetry''' is an intuitive idea corresponding to the concept of viewing some [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] as [[Motion (physics)|motion]]s, as opposed to [[discrete symmetry]], e.g. [[reflection symmetry]], which is invariant under a kind of flip from one state to another. However, a discrete symmetry can always be reinterpreted as a subset of some higher-dimensional continuous symmetry, e.g. reflection of a 2 dimensional object in 3 dimensional space can be achieved by continuously rotating that object 180 degrees across a non-parallel plane.\n\n==Formalization==\nThe notion of continuous symmetry has largely and successfully been formalised in the mathematical notions of [[topological group]], [[Lie group]] and [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]. For most practical purposes continuous symmetry is modelled by a ''group action'' of a topological group that preserves some structure. Particularly, let <math>f:X\\to Y</math> be a function, and ''G'' is a group that acts on ''X'' then a subgroup <math>H\\subseteq G</math> is a symmetry of ''f'' if <math>f(h\\cdot x) = f(x)</math> for all <math>h\\in H</math>.''\n\n===One-parameter subgroups===\nThe simplest motions follow a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of a Lie group, such as the [[Euclidean group]] of [[three-dimensional space]]. For example [[translation (geometry)|translation]] parallel to the ''x''-axis by ''u'' units, as ''u'' varies, is a one-parameter group of motions. Rotation around the ''z''-axis is also a one-parameter group.\n\n==Noether's theorem==\nContinuous symmetry has a basic role in [[Noether's theorem]] in [[theoretical physics]], in the derivation of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s from symmetry principles, specifically for continuous symmetries. The search for continuous symmetries only intensified with the further developments of [[quantum field theory]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Goldstone's theorem]]\n*[[Infinitesimal transformation]]\n*[[Noether's theorem]]\n*[[Sophus Lie]]\n*[[Motion (geometry)]]\n*[[Circular symmetry]]\n\n==References==\n*William H.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Concept in topological group theory}}\n{{about|topological covering group|algebraic covering group|universal perfect central extension}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''covering group''' of a [[topological group]] ''H'' is a [[covering space]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''G'' is a topological group and the covering map ''p'' : ''G'' → ''H'' is a [[continuous (topology)|continuous]] [[group homomorphism]]. The map ''p'' is called the '''covering homomorphism'''. A frequently occurring case is a '''double covering group''', a [[double cover (topology)|topological double cover]] in which ''H'' has [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 in ''G;'' examples include the [[Spin group]]s, [[Pin group]]s, and [[metaplectic group]]s.\n\nRoughly explained, saying that for example the metaplectic group ''Mp''<sub>2''n''</sub> is a ''double cover'' of the [[symplectic group]] ''Sp''<sub>2''n''</sub> means that there are always two elements in the metaplectic group representing one element in the symplectic group.\n\n== Properties ==\nLet ''G'' be a covering group of ''H''. The [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] ''K'' of the covering homomorphism is just the fiber over the identity in ''H'' and is a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''. The kernel ''K'' is [[closed set|closed]] in ''G'' if and only if ''G'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (and if and only if ''H'' is Hausdorff). Going in the other direction, if ''G'' is any topological group and ''K'' is a discrete normal subgroup of ''G'' then the quotient map ''p'' : ''G'' → ''G''/''K'' is a covering homomorphism.\n\nIf ''G'' is [[connected space|connected]] then ''K'', being a discrete normal subgroup, necessarily lies in the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G'' and is therefore [[abelian group|abelian]]. In this case, the center of ''H'' = ''G''/''K'' is given by\n:<math>Z(H) \\cong Z(G)/K.</math>\n\nAs with all covering spaces, the [[fundamental group]] of ''G'' injects into the fundamental group of ''H''. Since the fundamental group of a topological group is always abelian, every covering group is a normal covering space. In particular, if ''G'' is [[path-connected]] then the [[quotient group]] <math>\\pi_1(H)/\\pi_1(G)</math> is isomorphic to ''K''. The group ''K'' [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] simply transitively on the fibers (which are just left [[coset]]s) by right multiplication. The group ''G'' is then a [[principal bundle|principal ''K''-bundle]] over ''H''.\n\nIf ''G'' is a covering group of ''H'' then the groups ''G'' and ''H'' are [[locally isomorphic groups|locally isomorphic]]. Moreover, given any two connected locally isomorphic groups ''H''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub>, there exists a topological group ''G'' with discrete normal subgroups ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub> such that ''H''<sub>1</sub> is isomorphic to ''G''/''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> is isomorphic to ''G''/''K''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n== Group structure on a covering space ==\nLet ''H'' be a topological group and let ''G'' be a covering space of ''H''. If ''G'' and ''H'' are both [[path-connected]] and [[locally path-connected]], then for any choice of element ''e''* in the fiber over ''e'' ∈ ''H'', there exists a unique topological group structure on ''G'', with ''e''* as the identity, for which the covering map ''p'' : ''G'' → ''H'' is a homomorphism.\n\nThe construction is as follows. Let ''a'' and ''b'' be elements of ''G'' and let ''f'' and ''g'' be [[path (topology)|path]]s in ''G'' starting at ''e''* and terminating at ''a'' and ''b'' respectively. Define a path ''h'' : ''I'' → ''H'' by ''h''(''t'') = ''p''(''f''(''t''))''p''(''g''(''t'')). By the path-lifting property of covering spaces there is a unique lift of ''h'' to ''G'' with initial point ''e''*. The product ''ab'' is defined as the endpoint of this path. By construction we have ''p''(''ab'') = ''p''(''a'')''p''(''b''). One must show that this definition is independent of the choice of paths ''f'' and ''g'', and also that the group operations are continuous.\n\nAlternatively, the group law on ''G'' can be constructed by lifting the group law ''H'' × ''H'' → ''H'' to ''G'', using the lifting property of the covering map ''G'' × ''G'' → ''H'' × ''H''.\n\nThe non-connected case is interesting and is studied in the papers by Taylor and by Brown-Mucuk cited below. Essentially there is an obstruction to the existence of a universal cover which is also a topological group such that the covering map is a morphism: this obstruction lies in the third cohomology group of the group of components of ''G'' with coefficients in the fundamental group of ''G'' at the identity.\n\n== Universal covering group ==\nIf ''H'' is a path-connected, locally path-connected, and [[semilocally simply connected]] group then it has a [[universal cover]]. By the previous construction the universal cover can be made into a topological group with the covering map a continuous homomorphism. This group is called the '''universal covering group''' of ''H''. There is also a more direct construction which we give below.\n\nLet ''PH'' be the [[path group]] of ''H''. That is, ''PH'' is the space of [[path (topology)|path]]s in ''H'' based at the identity together with the [[compact-open topology]]. The product of paths is given by pointwise multiplication, i.e. (''fg'')(''t'') = ''f''(''t'')''g''(''t''). This gives ''PH'' the structure of a topological group. There is a natural group homomorphism ''PH'' → ''H'' which sends each path to its endpoint. The universal cover of ''H'' is given as the quotient of ''PH'' by the normal subgroup of [[null-homotopic]] [[loop (topology)|loop]]s. The projection ''PH'' → ''H'' descends to the quotient giving the covering map. One can show that the universal cover is [[simply connected]] and the kernel is just the [[fundamental group]] of ''H''. That is, we have a [[short exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>1\\to \\pi_1(H) \\to \\tilde H \\to H \\to 1</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\tilde H</math> is the universal cover of ''H''. Concretely, the universal covering group of ''H'' is the space of homotopy classes of paths in ''H'' with pointwise multiplication of paths. The covering map sends each path class to its endpoint.\n\n== Lattice of covering groups ==\nAs the above suggest, if a group has a universal covering group (if it is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply connected), with discrete center, then the set of all topological groups that are covered by the universal covering group form a lattice, corresponding to the lattice of subgroups of the center of the universal covering group: inclusion of subgroups corresponds to covering of quotient groups. The maximal element is the universal covering group <math>\\tilde H,</math> while the minimal element is the universal covering group mod its center, <math>\\tilde H/Z(\\tilde H)</math>.\n\nThis corresponds algebraically to the [[universal perfect central extension]] (called \"covering group\", by analogy) as the maximal element, and a group mod its center as minimal element.\n\nThis is particularly important for Lie groups, as these groups are all the (connected) realizations of a particular Lie algebra. For many Lie groups the center is the group of scalar matrices, and thus the group mod its center is the projectivization of the Lie group. These covers are important in studying [[projective representation]]s of Lie groups, and [[spin representation]]s lead to the discovery of [[spin group]]s: a projective representation of a Lie group need not come from a linear representation of the group, but does come from a linear representation of some covering group, in particular the universal covering group. The finite analog led to the covering group or Schur cover, as discussed above.\n\nA key example arises from [[SL2(R)|SL<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]], which has center {±1} and fundamental group '''Z'''.  It is a double cover of the centerless [[projective special linear group]] PSL<sub>2</sub>('''R'''), which is obtained by taking the quotient by the center.  By [[Iwasawa decomposition]], both groups are circle bundles over the complex upper half-plane, and their universal cover <math>{\\mathrm{S}\\widetilde{\\mathrm{L}_2(}\\mathbf{R})}</math> is a real line bundle over the half-plane that forms one of [[Geometrization conjecture|Thurston's eight geometries]].  Since the half-plane is contractible, all bundle structures are trivial.  The preimage of SL<sub>2</sub>('''Z''') in the universal cover is isomorphic to the [[braid group]] on three strands.\n\n== Lie groups ==\n{{See also|Group extension#Central extension}}\n\nThe above definitions and constructions all apply to the special case of [[Lie group]]s. In particular, every covering of a [[manifold]] is a manifold, and the covering homomorphism becomes a [[smooth map]]. Likewise, given any discrete normal subgroup of a Lie group the quotient group is a Lie group and the quotient map is a covering homomorphism.\n\nTwo Lie groups are locally isomorphic if and only if their [[Lie algebras]] are isomorphic. This implies that a homomorphism φ  : ''G'' → ''H'' of Lie groups is a covering homomorphism if and only if the induced map on Lie algebras\n\n:<math>\\phi_* : \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak h</math>\n\nis an isomorphism.\n\nSince for every Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> there is a unique simply connected Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, from this follows that the universal covering group of a connected Lie group ''H'' is the (unique) simply connected Lie group ''G'' having the same Lie algebra as ''H''.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The universal covering group of the [[circle group]] '''T''' is the additive group of [[real number]]s '''R''' with the covering homomorphism given by the [[exponential function]] exp: '''R''' → '''T'''. The kernel of the exponential map is isomorphic to '''Z'''.\n* For any integer ''n'' we have a covering group of the circle by itself '''T''' → '''T''' which sends ''z'' to ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>. The kernel of this homomorphism is the [[cyclic group]] consisting of the ''n''th [[roots of unity]].\n* The rotation group [[SO(3)]] has as a universal cover the group [[SU(2)]] which is isomorphic to the group of [[versor]]s in the quaternions. This is a double cover since the kernel has order 2. (cf the [[plate trick]].)\n* The [[unitary group]] U(''n'') is covered by the compact group '''T''' &times; SU(''n'') with the covering homomorphism given by ''p''(''z'', ''A'') = ''zA''. The universal cover is just '''R''' &times; SU(''n'').\n* The [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n'') has a double cover called the [[spin group]] Spin(''n''). For ''n'' ≥ 3, the spin group is the universal cover of SO(''n'').\n* For ''n'' ≥ 2, the universal cover of the [[special linear group]] SL(''n'', '''R''') is ''not'' a [[matrix group]] (i.e. it has no faithful finite-dimensional [[group representation|representation]]s).\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | last = Pontryagin | first = Lev S. | authorlink = Lev Semenovich Pontryagin | title = Topological Groups | year = 1986 | edition = 3rd | others = trans. from Russian by Arlen Brown and P.S.V.

      "text": "The '''Darboux derivative''' of a map between a [[manifold]] and a [[Lie group]] is a variant of the standard derivative. It is arguably a more natural generalization of the single-variable derivative. It allows a generalization of the single-variable [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] to higher dimensions, in a different vein than the generalization that is [[Stokes' theorem]].\n\n==Formal definition==\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a [[Lie group]], and let <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be its [[Lie algebra]]. The [[Maurer-Cartan form]], <math>\\omega_G</math>, is the smooth <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued <math>1</math>-form on <math>G</math> (cf. [[Lie algebra valued form]]) defined by\n:<math>\\omega_G(X_g) = (T_g L_g)^{-1} X_g </math>\nfor all <math>g \\in G</math> and <math>X_g \\in T_g G</math>. Here <math>L_g</math> denotes left multiplication by the element <math>g \\in G</math> and <math>T_g L_g</math> is its derivative at <math>g</math>.\n\nLet <math>f:M \\to G</math> be a [[smooth function]] between a [[smooth manifold]] <math>M</math> and <math>G</math>. Then the '''Darboux derivative''' of <math>f</math> is the smooth <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued <math>1</math>-form \n:<math>\\omega_f := f^* \\omega_G,</math>\nthe [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of <math>\\omega_G</math> by <math>f</math>. The map <math>f</math> is called an '''integral''' or '''primitive''' of <math>\\omega_f</math>.\n\n==More natural?==\n\nThe reason that one might call the Darboux derivative a more natural generalization of the derivative of single-variable calculus is this. In single-variable calculus, the [[derivative]] <math>f'</math> of a function <math>f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> assigns to each point in the domain a single number. According to the more general manifold ideas of derivatives, the derivative assigns to each point in the domain a [[linear map]] from the tangent space at the domain point to the tangent space at the image point. This derivative encapsulates two pieces of data: the image of the domain point ''and'' the linear map. In single-variable calculus, we drop some information. We retain only the linear map, in the form of a scalar multiplying agent (i.e. a number).\n\nOne way to justify this convention of retaining only the linear map aspect of the derivative is to appeal to the (very simple) Lie group structure of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> under addition. The [[tangent bundle]] of any [[Lie group]] can be trivialized via left (or right) multiplication. This means that every tangent space in <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> may be identified with the tangent space at the identity, <math>0</math>, which is the [[Lie algebra]] of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>. In this case, left and right multiplication are simply translation. By post-composing the manifold-type derivative with the tangent space trivialization, for each point in the domain we obtain a linear map from the tangent space at the domain point to the Lie algebra of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>. In symbols, for each <math>x \\in \\mathbb{R}</math> we look at the map\n:<math>v \\in T_x \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto (T_{f(x)} L_{f(x)})^{-1} \\circ (T_x f) v \\in T_0 \\mathbb{R}.</math>\nSince the tangent spaces involved are one-dimensional, this linear map is just multiplication by some scalar. (This scalar can change depending on what basis we use for the vector spaces, but the [[Canonical units|canonical unit]] vector field <math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}</math> on <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> gives a canonical choice of basis, and hence a canonical choice of scalar.) This scalar is what we usually denote by <math>f'(x)</math>.\n\n==Uniqueness of primitives==\n\nIf the manifold <math>M</math> is connected, and <math>f,g: M \\to G</math> are both primitives of <math>\\omega_f</math>, i.e. <math>\\omega_f = \\omega_g</math>, then there exists some constant <math>C \\in G</math> such that \n:<math>f(x) = C \\cdot g(x)</math> for all <math>x \\in M</math>.\n\nThis constant <math>C</math> is of course the analogue of the constant that appears when taking an [[indefinite integral]].\n\n==The fundamental theorem of calculus==\n\nThe '''structural equation''' for the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] is:\n:<math>d \\omega + \\frac{1}{2} [\\omega, \\omega] = 0.</math>\nThis means that for all vector fields <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> on <math>G</math> and all <math>x \\in G</math>, we have\n:<math>(d \\omega)_x (X_x, Y_x) +  [\\omega_x(X_x), \\omega_x(Y_x)] = 0.</math>\nFor any Lie algebra-valued <math>1</math>-form on any smooth manifold, all the terms in this equation make sense, so for any such form we can ask whether or not it satisfies this structural equation.\n\nThe usual [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] for single-variable calculus has the following local generalization.\n\nIf a <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued <math>1</math>-form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>M</math> satisfies the structural equation, then every point <math>p \\in M</math> has an open neighborhood <math>U</math> and a smooth map <math>f: U \\to G</math> such that\n:<math>\\omega_f = \\omega|_U,</math>\ni.e. <math>\\omega</math> has a primitive defined in a neighborhood of every point of <math>M</math>.\n\nFor a global generalization of the fundamental theorem, one needs to study certain [[monodromy]] questions in <math>M</math> and <math>G</math>.\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite book|author=R.

Any {{math|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>, 0 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ∞, ''ω''}} map {{math|''f''}} between vector spaces (here first considering matrix Lie groups) has a {{math|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>}} inverse such that {{math|''f''}} is a {{math|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>}} bijection in an open set around a point {{math|''x''}} in the domain provided {{math|''df''<sub>''x''</sub>}} is invertible. From {{EquationNote|(3)}} it follows that this will happen precisely when\n\n:<math>\\frac{1 - e^{\\mathrm{ad_X}}}{\\mathrm{ad}_X}</math>\n\nis invertible. This, in turn, happens when the eigenvalues of this operator are all nonzero. The eigenvalues of {{math|{{sfrac|1 − exp(−ad<sub>''X''</sub>)|ad<sub>''X''</sub>}}}} are related to those of {{math|ad<sub>''X''</sub>}} as follows. If {{math|''g''}} is an analytic function of a complex variable expressed in a power series such that {{math|''g''(''U'')}} for a matrix {{math|''U''}} converges, then the eigenvalues of {{math|''g''(''U'')}} will be {{math|''g''(''λ''<sub>''ij''</sub>)}}, where {{math|''λ''<sub>''ij''</sub>}} are the eigenvalues of {{math|''U''}}, the double subscript is made clear below.<ref group=nb>This is seen by choosing a basis for the underlying vector space such that {{math|''U''}} is [[triangular matrix|triangular]], the eigenvalues being the diagonal elements.

Let {{math|''E''<sub>''ij''</sub>}} be the corresponding basis for matrix space, i.e. {{math|(''E''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''kl''</sub> {{=}} ''δ''<sub>''ik''</sub>''δ''<sub>''jl''</sub>}}. Order this basis such that {{math|''E''<sub>''ij''</sub> < ''E''<sub>''nm''</sub>}} if {{math|''i'' − ''j'' < ''n'' − ''m''}}.

The designation E<sub>6</sub> comes from the Cartan–Killing classification of the complex [[simple Lie algebra]]s (see {{section link|Élie Cartan|Work}}). This classifies Lie algebras into four infinite series labeled A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub>, and [[Exceptional simple Lie group|five exceptional cases]] labeled E<sub>6</sub>, [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]. The E<sub>6</sub> algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complex form, compact real form, or any algebraic version of E<sub>6</sub> is the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''/3'''Z''', and its [[outer automorphism group]] is the cyclic group '''Z'''/2'''Z'''. Its [[fundamental representation]] is 27-dimensional (complex), and a basis is given by the [[27 lines on a cubic surface]]. The [[dual representation]], which is inequivalent, is also 27-dimensional.\n\nIn [[particle physics]], E<sub>6</sub> plays a role in some [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]].\n\n== Real and complex forms ==\nThere is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E<sub>6</sub>, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 78. The complex adjoint Lie group E<sub>6</sub> of [[complex dimension]] 78 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 156. This has fundamental group '''Z'''/3'''Z''', has maximal [[Compact space|compact]] subgroup the compact form (see below) of E<sub>6</sub>, and has an outer automorphism group non-cyclic of order 4 generated by complex conjugation and by the outer automorphism which already exists as a complex automorphism.\n\nAs well as the complex Lie group of type E<sub>6</sub>, there are five real forms of the Lie algebra, and correspondingly five real forms of the group with trivial center (all of which have an algebraic double cover, and three of which have further non-algebraic covers, giving further real forms), all of real dimension 78, as follows:\n\n* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which has fundamental group '''Z'''/3'''Z''' and outer automorphism group '''Z'''/2'''Z'''.\n* The split form, EI (or E<sub>6(6)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup Sp(4)/(±1), fundamental group of order 2 and outer automorphism group of order 2.\n* The quasi-split form EII (or E<sub>6(2)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(2) × SU(6)/(center), fundamental group cyclic of order 6 and outer automorphism group of order 2.\n* EIII (or E<sub>6(-14)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup SO(2) × Spin(10)/(center), fundamental group '''Z''' and trivial outer automorphism group.\n*  EIV (or E<sub>6(-26)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup F<sub>4</sub>, trivial fundamental group cyclic and outer automorphism group of order 2.\n\nThe EIV form of E<sub>6</sub> is the group of collineations (line-preserving transformations) of the [[octonionic projective plane]] '''OP'''<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Rosenfeld | first1=Boris | title=Geometry of Lie Groups | year=1997 }} (theorem 7.4 on page 335, and following paragraph).</ref> It is also the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of the exceptional [[Jordan algebra]]. The exceptional Jordan algebra is 27-dimensional, which explains why the compact real form of E<sub>6</sub> has a 27-dimensional complex representation. The compact real form of E<sub>6</sub> is the [[isometry group]] of a 32-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] known as the 'bioctonionic projective plane'; similar constructions for E<sub>7</sub> and E<sub>8</sub> are known as the [[Rosenfeld projective plane]]s, and are part of the [[Freudenthal magic square]].\n\n== E<sub>6</sub> as an algebraic group ==\nBy means of a [[Chevalley basis]] for the Lie algebra, one can define E<sub>6</sub> as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as “untwisted”) adjoint form of E<sub>6</sub>. Over an algebraically closed field, this and its triple cover are the only forms; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or “twists” of E<sub>6</sub>, which are classified in the general framework of [[Galois cohomology]] (over a [[perfect field]] ''k'') by the set ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', Aut(E<sub>6</sub>)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>6</sub> (see [[#Dynkin diagram|below]]) has automorphism group '''Z'''/2'''Z''', maps to ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', '''Z'''/2'''Z''') = Hom (Gal(''k''), '''Z'''/2'''Z''') with kernel ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', E<sub>6,ad</sub>).<ref>{{cite book | last1=Платонов | first1=Владимир П. | last2=Рапинчук | first2=Андрей С. | title=Алгебраические группы и теория чисел | year=1991 | publisher=Наука | isbn=5-02-014191-7 }} (English translation: {{cite book | last1=Platonov | first1=Vladimir P. | last2=Rapinchuk | first2=Andrei S. | title=Algebraic groups and number theory | year=1994 | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=0-12-558180-7 }}), §2.2.4</ref>\n\nOver the field of real numbers, the real component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E<sub>6</sub> coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned [[#Real and complex forms|above]], but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all adjoint forms of E<sub>6</sub> have fundamental group '''Z'''/3'''Z''' in the sense of algebraic geometry, with Galois action as on the third roots of unity; this means that they admit exactly one triple cover (which may be trivial on the real points); the further non-compact real Lie group forms of E<sub>6</sub> are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.  The compact real form of E<sub>6</sub> as well as the noncompact forms EI=E<sub>6(6)</sub> and EIV=E<sub>6(-26)</sub> are said to be ''inner'' or of type <sup>1</sup>E<sub>6</sub> meaning that their class lies in ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', E<sub>6,ad</sub>) or that complex conjugation induces the trivial automorphism on the Dynkin diagram, whereas the other two real forms are said to be ''outer'' or of type <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>.\n\nOver finite fields, the [[Lang–Steinberg theorem]] implies that ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', E<sub>6</sub>) = 0, meaning that E<sub>6</sub> has exactly one twisted form, known as <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>: see [[#Chevalley and Steinberg groups of type E6 and 2E6|below]].\n\n== Algebra ==\n\n=== Dynkin diagram ===\nThe [[Dynkin diagram]] for E<sub>6</sub> is given by {{Dynkin2|node|3|node|3|branch|3|node|3|node}}, which may also be drawn as {{Dynkin|nodes|3s|nodes|loop2|3|node}}.\n\n=== Roots of E<sub>6</sub> ===\n[[File:Up 1 22 t0 E6.svg|thumb|300px|The 72 vertices of the [[1 22 polytope|1<sub>22</sub>]] polytope represent the root vectors of the E<sub>6</sub>, as shown in this [[Coxeter plane]] projection.

Other maximal subalgebras which have an importance in physics (see below) and can be read off the Dynkin diagram, are the algebras of SO(10) × U(1) and SU(6) × SU(2).\n\nIn addition to the 78-dimensional adjoint representation, there  are two dual [[E8 (mathematics)#Subgroups|27-dimensional \"vector\" representation]]s.\n\nThe characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the [[Weyl character formula]].  The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are {{OEIS|id=A121737}}:\n\n:<u>1</u>, 27 (twice), <u>78</u>, 351 (four times), <u>650</u>, 1728 (twice), <u>2430</u>, <u>2925</u>, <u>3003 (twice)</u>, <u>5824 (twice)</u>, 7371 (twice), 7722 (twice), 17550 (twice), 19305 (four times), 34398 (twice), <u>34749</u>, <u>43758</u>, 46332 (twice), 51975 (twice), 54054 (twice), 61425 (twice), <u>70070</u>, <u>78975 (twice)</u>, <u>85293</u>, 100386 (twice), <u>105600</u>, 112320 (twice), <u>146432 (twice)</u>, <u>252252 (twice)</u>, 314496 (twice), 359424 (four times), <u>371800 (twice)</u>, 386100 (twice), 393822 (twice), 412776 (twice), <u>442442 (twice)</u>&hellip;\n\nThe underlined terms in the sequence above are the dimensions of those irreducible representations possessed by the adjoint form of E<sub>6</sub> (equivalently, those whose weights belong to the root lattice of E<sub>6</sub>), whereas the full sequence gives the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simply connected form of E<sub>6</sub>.\n\nThe symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>6</sub> explains why many dimensions occur twice, the corresponding representations being related by the non-trivial outer automorphism; however, there are sometimes even more representations than this, such as four of dimension 351, two of which are fundamental and two of which are not.\n\nThe [[fundamental representation]]s have dimensions 27, 351, 2925, 351, 27 and 78 (corresponding to the six nodes in the [[#Dynkin diagram|Dynkin diagram]] in the order chosen for the [[#Cartan matrix|Cartan matrix]] above, i.e., the nodes are read in the five-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the middle one).\n\n== E6 polytope ==\nThe '''[[E6 polytope|E<sub>6</sub> polytope]]''' is the [[convex hull]] of the roots of E<sub>6</sub>. It therefore exists in 6 dimensions; its [[symmetry group]] contains the [[Coxeter group]] for E<sub>6</sub> as an [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 subgroup.\n\n==Chevalley and Steinberg groups of type E<sub>6</sub> and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>==\n{{Main article|²E₆}}\n\nThe groups of type ''E''<sub>6</sub> over arbitrary fields (in particular finite fields) were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Dickson|year1=1901|year2=1908}}.\n\nThe points over a [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements of the (split) algebraic group E<sub>6</sub> (see [[#E6 as an algebraic group|above]]), whether of the adjoint (centerless) or simply connected form (its algebraic universal cover), give a finite [[Group of Lie type|Chevalley group]].  This is closely connected to the group written E<sub>6</sub>(''q''), however there is ambiguity in this notation, which can stand for several things:\n\n* the finite group consisting of the points over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> of the simply connected form of E<sub>6</sub> (for clarity, this can be written E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') or more rarely <math>\\tilde E_6(q)</math> and is known as the \"universal\" Chevalley group of type E<sub>6</sub> over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>),\n* (rarely) the finite group consisting of the points over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> of the adjoint form of E<sub>6</sub> (for clarity, this can be written E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q''), and is known as the \"adjoint\" Chevalley group of type E<sub>6</sub> over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>), or\n* the finite group which is the image of the natural map from the former to the latter: this is what will be denoted by E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') in the following, as is most common in texts dealing with finite groups.\n\nFrom the finite group perspective, the relation between these three groups, which is quite analogous to that between SL(''n,q''), PGL(''n,q'') and PSL(''n,q''), can be summarized as follows: E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is simple for any ''q'', E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') is its [[Schur multiplier|Schur cover]], and E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') lies in its automorphism group; furthermore, when ''q''−1 is not divisible by 3, all three coincide, and otherwise (when ''q'' is congruent to 1 mod 3), the Schur multiplier of E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is 3 and E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is of index 3 in E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q''), which explains why E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') and E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') are often written as 3·E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') and E<sub>6</sub>(''q'')·3. From the algebraic group perspective, it is less common for E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') to refer to the finite simple group, because the latter is not in a natural way the set of points of an algebraic group over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> unlike E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') and E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'').\n\nBeyond this “split” (or “untwisted”) form of E<sub>6</sub>, there is also one other form of E<sub>6</sub> over the finite field '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, known as <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>, which is obtained by twisting by the non-trivial automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>6</sub>. Concretely, <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q''), which is known as a Steinberg group, can be seen as the subgroup of E<sub>6</sub>(''q''<sup>2</sup>) fixed by the composition of the non-trivial diagram automorphism and the non-trivial field automorphism of '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub>.  Twisting does not change the fact that the algebraic fundamental group of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub> is '''Z'''/3'''Z''', but it does change those ''q'' for which the covering of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub> by <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub> is non-trivial on the '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>-points.  Precisely: <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') is a covering of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q''), and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') lies in its automorphism group; when ''q''+1 is not divisible by 3, all three coincide, and otherwise (when ''q'' is congruent to 2 mod 3), the degree of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') over <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is 3 and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is of index 3 in <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q''), which explains why <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') are often written as 3·<sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'')·3.\n\nTwo notational issues should be raised concerning the groups <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'').  One is that this is sometimes written <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q''<sup>2</sup>), a notation which has the advantage of transposing more easily to the Suzuki and Ree groups, but the disadvantage of deviating from the notation for the '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>-points of an algebraic group.  Another is that whereas <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') are the '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>-points of an algebraic group, the group in question also depends on ''q'' (e.g., the points over '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>2</sup></sub> of the same group are the untwisted E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q''<sup>2</sup>) and E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q''<sup>2</sup>)).\n\nThe groups E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') and <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') are simple for any ''q'',<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger W. | last=Carter | title=Simple Groups of Lie Type | authorlink=Roger Carter (mathematician) | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | series=Wiley Classics Library | isbn=0-471-50683-4 | year=1989 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=Robert A. | last=Wilson | title=The Finite Simple Groups | authorlink=Robert Arnott Wilson | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | volume=251 | isbn=1-84800-987-9 | year=2009 }}</ref> and constitute two of the infinite families in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].

The order of E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') or E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(3,''q''−1) from the first formula {{OEIS|id=A008871}}, and the order of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') or <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'') (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(3,''q''+1) from the second {{OEIS|id=A008915}}.\n\nThe Schur multiplier of E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is always gcd(3,''q''−1) (i.e., E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') is its Schur cover). The Schur multiplier of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is gcd(3,''q''+1) (i.e., <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,sc</sub>(''q'') is its Schur cover) outside of the exceptional case ''q''=2 where it is 2<sup>2</sup>·3 (i.e., there is an additional 2<sup>2</sup>-fold cover).  The outer automorphism group of E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is the product of the diagonal automorphism group '''Z'''/gcd(3,''q''−1)'''Z''' (given by the action of E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'')), the group '''Z'''/2'''Z''' of diagram automorphisms, and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order ''f'' if ''q''=''p<sup>f</sup>'' where ''p'' is prime).  The outer automorphism group of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(''q'') is the product of the diagonal automorphism group '''Z'''/gcd(3,''q''+1)'''Z''' (given by the action of <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6,ad</sub>(''q'')) and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order ''f'' if ''q''=''p''<sup>''f''</sup> where ''p'' is prime).\n\n== Importance in physics ==\n[[File:E6GUT.svg|300px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]], {{math|''W''}}, weaker isospin, {{math|''W''&prime;}}, strong {{math|''g''3}} and {{math|''g''8}}, and baryon minus lepton, {{math|''B''}}, charges for particles in the [[SO(10)]] [[Grand Unified Theory]], rotated to show the embedding in {{math|E<sub>6</sub>}}.]]\n\n{{math|''N'' {{=}} 8}} [[supergravity]] in five dimensions, which is a [[dimensional reduction]] from {{math|11}} dimensional supergravity, admits an {{math|E<sub>6</sub>}} bosonic global symmetry and an {{math|Sp(8)}} bosonic [[gauge symmetry|local symmetry]].

The designation E<sub>7</sub> comes from the [[Cartan–Killing classification]] of the complex [[simple Lie algebra]]s, which fall into four infinite series labeled A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub>, and [[Exceptional simple Lie group|five exceptional cases]] labeled [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], E<sub>7</sub>, [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]. The E<sub>7</sub> algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases.\n\nThe fundamental group of the (adjoint) complex form, compact real form, or any algebraic version of E<sub>7</sub> is the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''/2'''Z''', and its [[outer automorphism group]] is the [[trivial group]]. The dimension of its [[fundamental representation]] is 56.\n\n==Real and complex forms==\nThere is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E<sub>7</sub>, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 133. The complex adjoint Lie group E<sub>7</sub> of [[complex dimension]] 133 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 266. This has fundamental group '''Z'''/2'''Z''', has maximal [[Compact space|compact]] subgroup the compact form (see below) of E<sub>7</sub>, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation.\n\nAs well as the complex Lie group of type E<sub>7</sub>, there are four real forms of the Lie algebra, and correspondingly four real forms of the group with trivial center (all of which have an algebraic double cover, and three of which have further non-algebraic covers, giving further real forms), all of real dimension 133, as follows:\n* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which has fundamental group '''Z'''/2'''Z''' and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* The split form, EV (or E<sub>7(7)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(8)/{±1}, fundamental group cyclic of order 4 and outer automorphism group of order 2.\n* EVI (or E<sub>7(-5)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(2)·SO(12)/(center), fundamental group non-cyclic of order 4 and trivial outer automorphism group.\n* EVII (or E<sub>7(-25)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup SO(2)·E<sub>6</sub>/(center), infinite cyclic findamental group and outer automorphism group of order 2.\n\nFor a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the [[list of simple Lie groups]].\n\nThe compact real form of E<sub>7</sub> is the [[isometry group]] of the 64-dimensional exceptional compact [[Riemannian symmetric space]] EVI (in Cartan's [[Riemannian symmetric space#Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces|classification]]). It is known informally as the \"{{Not a typo|[[quateroctonionic projective plane]]}}<!-- this is not a typo: please don't change this to \"qua*r*teroctonionic\" -->\" because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the [[quaternion]]s and the [[octonion]]s, and is also known as a [[Rosenfeld projective plane]], though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the ''[[Freudenthal magic square|magic square]]'', due to [[Hans Freudenthal]] and [[Jacques Tits]].\n\nThe [[Tits–Koecher construction]] produces forms of the E<sub>7</sub> Lie algebra from [[Albert algebra]]s, 27-dimensional exceptional [[Jordan algebra]]s.\n\n==E<sub>7</sub> as an algebraic group==\nBy means of a [[Chevalley basis]] for the Lie algebra, one can define E<sub>7</sub> as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as “untwisted”) adjoint form of E<sub>7</sub>. Over an algebraically closed field, this and its double cover are the only forms; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or “twists” of E<sub>7</sub>, which are classified in the general framework of [[Galois cohomology]] (over a [[perfect field]] ''k'') by the set ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', Aut(E<sub>7</sub>)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>7</sub> (see [[#Dynkin diagram|below]]) has no automorphisms, coincides with ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', E<sub>7, ad</sub>).<ref>{{Citation | last1=Platonov | first1=Vladimir | last2=Rapinchuk | first2=Andrei | title=Algebraic groups and number theory | origyear=1991 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0125581807 | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | isbn=978-0-12-558180-6 | mr=1278263 | year=1994 | volume=139}} (original version: {{cite book | last1=Платонов | first1=Владимир П. | last2=Рапинчук | first2=Андрей С. | title=Алгебраические группы и теория чисел | year=1991 | publisher=Наука | isbn=5-02-014191-7 }}), §2.2.4</ref>\n\nOver the field of real numbers, the real component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E<sub>7</sub> coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned [[#Real and complex forms|above]], but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all adjoint forms of E<sub>7</sub> have fundamental group '''Z'''/2'''Z''' in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit exactly one double cover; the further non-compact real Lie group forms of E<sub>7</sub> are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.\n\nOver finite fields, the [[Lang–Steinberg theorem]] implies that ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'', E<sub>7</sub>) = 0, meaning that E<sub>7</sub> has no twisted forms: see [[#Chevalley groups of type E7|below]].\n\n==Algebra==\n\n===Dynkin diagram===\nThe [[Dynkin diagram]] for E<sub>7</sub> is given by [[File:Dynkin diagram type E7.svg|120px]].\n\n===Root system===\n[[File:Gosset 2 31 polytope.svg|thumb|300px|The 126 vertices of the [[2 31 polytope|2<sub>31</sub> polytope]] represent the root vectors of E<sub>7</sub>, as shown in this [[Coxeter plane]] projection<br>[[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]]: {{CDD|nodea_1|3a|nodea|3a|branch|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea}}]]\n\n[[File:3_21_E7_to_3D_H3_symmetry_concentric_hulls.png|thumb|300px|Shown in 3D projection using the basis vectors [u,v,w] giving H3 symmetry:<br>\nu = (1, ''φ'', 0, -1, ''φ'', 0,0)<br>\nv = (''φ'', 0, 1, ''φ'', 0, -1,0)<br>\nw = (0, 1, ''φ'', 0, -1, ''φ'',0)<br>\nThe projected [[2 31 polytope|2<sub>31</sub> polytope]] vertices are sorted and tallied by their 3D norm generating the increasingly transparent hulls of each set of tallied norms.

We divide the variables into two groups of 28, (''p'', ''P'') and (''q'', ''Q'') where ''p'' and ''q'' are real variables and ''P'' and ''Q'' are 3×3 [[octonion]] hermitian matrices.

This is closely connected to the group written E<sub>7</sub>(''q''), however there is ambiguity in this notation, which can stand for several things:\n\n* the finite group consisting of the points over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> of the simply connected form of E<sub>7</sub> (for clarity, this can be written E<sub>7,sc</sub>(''q'') and is known as the “universal” Chevalley group of type E<sub>7</sub> over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>),\n* (rarely) the finite group consisting of the points over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> of the adjoint form of E<sub>7</sub> (for clarity, this can be written E<sub>7,ad</sub>(''q''), and is known as the “adjoint” Chevalley group of type E<sub>7</sub> over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>), or\n* the finite group which is the image of the natural map from the former to the latter: this is what will be denoted by E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') in the following, as is most common in texts dealing with finite groups.\n\nFrom the finite group perspective, the relation between these three groups, which is quite analogous to that between SL(''n'', ''q''), PGL(''n'', ''q'') and PSL(''n'', ''q''), can be summarized as follows: E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') is simple for any ''q'', E<sub>7,sc</sub>(''q'') is its [[Schur multiplier|Schur cover]], and the E<sub>7,ad</sub>(''q'') lies in its automorphism group; furthermore, when ''q'' is a power of 2, all three coincide, and otherwise (when ''q'' is odd), the Schur multiplier of E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') is 2 and E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') is of index 2 in E<sub>7,ad</sub>(''q''), which explains why E<sub>7,sc</sub>(''q'') and E<sub>7,ad</sub>(''q'') are often written as 2·E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') and E<sub>7</sub>(''q'')·2. From the algebraic group perspective, it is less common for E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') to refer to the finite simple group, because the latter is not in a natural way the set of points of an algebraic group over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> unlike E<sub>7,sc</sub>(''q'') and E<sub>7,ad</sub>(''q'').\n\nAs mentioned above, E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') is simple for any ''q'',<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger W. | last=Carter | title=Simple Groups of Lie Type | authorlink=Roger Carter (mathematician) | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | series=Wiley Classics Library | isbn=0-471-50683-4 | year=1989 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=Robert A. | last=Wilson | title=The Finite Simple Groups | authorlink=Robert Arnott Wilson | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | volume=251 | isbn=1-84800-987-9 | year=2009 }}</ref> and it constitutes one of the infinite families addressed by the [[classification of finite simple groups]].

The Schur multiplier of E<sub>7</sub>(''q'') is gcd(2, ''q''−1), and its outer automorphism group is the product of the diagonal automorphism group '''Z'''/gcd(2, ''q''−1)'''Z''' (given by the action of E<sub>7,ad</sub>(''q'')) and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order ''f'' if ''q'' = ''p<sup>f</sup>'' where ''p'' is prime).\n\n==Importance in physics==\n''N'' = 8 [[supergravity]] in four dimensions, which is a [[dimensional reduction]] from 11 dimensional supergravity, admit an E<sub>7</sub> bosonic global symmetry and an SU(8) bosonic [[gauge symmetry|local symmetry]].

The designation E<sub>8</sub> comes from the [[Killing form|Cartan–Killing classification]] of the complex [[simple Lie algebra]]s, which fall into four infinite series labeled A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub>, and [[Exceptional simple Lie group|five exceptional cases]] labeled [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], E<sub>8</sub>, [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]. The E<sub>8</sub> algebra is the largest and most complicated of these exceptional cases.\n\n== Basic description ==\n\nThe [[Lie group]] E<sub>8</sub> has dimension 248. Its [[Cartan subgroup|rank]], which is the dimension of its [[maximal torus]], is eight (8).\n\nTherefore, the vectors of the root system are in eight-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]: they are described explicitly later in this article. The [[Weyl group]] of E<sub>8</sub>, which is the [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]] of the maximal torus which are induced by [[conjugacy class|conjugations]] in the whole group, has order 2{{sup|14}}{{nnbsp}}3{{sup|5}}{{nnbsp}}5{{sup|2}}{{nnbsp}}7 = {{gaps|696|729|600}}.\n\nThe compact group E<sub>8</sub> is unique among simple compact Lie groups in that its non-[[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] representation of smallest dimension is the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] (of dimension 248) acting on the Lie algebra E<sub>8</sub> itself; it is also the unique one which has the following four properties: trivial center, compact, simply connected, and simply laced (all roots have the same length).\n\nThere is a Lie algebra [[En (Lie algebra)|E<sub>''k''</sub>]] for every integer ''k''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3, which is infinite dimensional if ''k'' is greater than&nbsp;8.\n\n== Real and complex forms ==\n\nThere is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E<sub>8</sub>, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 248. The complex Lie group E<sub>8</sub> of [[complex dimension]] 248 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 496. This is simply connected, has maximal [[Compact space|compact]] subgroup the compact form (see below) of E<sub>8</sub>, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation.\n\nAs well as the complex Lie group of type E<sub>8</sub>, there are three real forms of the Lie algebra, three real forms of the group with trivial center (two of which have non-algebraic double covers, giving two further real forms), all of real dimension 248, as follows:\n\n* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which is simply connected and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* The split form, EVIII (or E<sub>8(8)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup Spin(16)/('''Z'''/2'''Z'''), fundamental group of order 2 (implying that it has a [[Double covering group|double cover]], which is a simply connected Lie real group but is not algebraic, see [[#E8 as an algebraic group|below]]) and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* EIX (or E<sub>8(−24)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup E<sub>7</sub>&times;SU(2)/(−1,−1), fundamental group of order 2 (again implying a double cover, which is not algebraic) and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n\nFor a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the [[list of simple Lie groups]].\n\n== E<sub>8</sub> as an algebraic group ==\n\nBy means of a [[Chevalley basis]] for the Lie algebra, one can define E<sub>8</sub> as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as “untwisted”) form of E<sub>8</sub>. Over an algebraically closed field, this is the only form; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or “twists” of E<sub>8</sub>, which are classified in the general framework of [[Galois cohomology]] (over a [[perfect field]] ''k'') by the set H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',Aut(E<sub>8</sub>)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>8</sub> (see [[#Dynkin diagram|below]]) has no automorphisms, coincides with H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',E<sub>8</sub>).<ref>{{citation |last1=Платонов |first1=Владимир П. |last2=Рапинчук |first2=Андрей С. |title=Алгебраические группы и теория чисел |year=1991 |publisher=Наука |isbn=5-02-014191-7}} (English translation: {{citation |last1=Platonov |first1=Vladimir P. |last2=Rapinchuk |first2=Andrei S. |title=Algebraic groups and number theory |year=1994 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-558180-7}}), §2.2.4</ref>\n\nOver '''R''', the real connected component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E<sub>8</sub> coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned [[#Real and complex forms|above]], but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all forms of E<sub>8</sub> are simply connected in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit no non-trivial algebraic coverings; the non-compact and simply connected real Lie group forms of E<sub>8</sub> are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.\n\nOver finite fields, the [[Lang–Steinberg theorem]] implies that H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',E<sub>8</sub>)=0, meaning that E<sub>8</sub> has no twisted forms: see [[#Chevalley groups of type E8|below]].\n\nThe characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the [[Weyl character formula]].  The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are {{OEIS|id=A121732}}:\n: 1, 248, 3875, 27000, 30380, 147250, 779247, 1763125, 2450240, 4096000, 4881384, 6696000, 26411008, 70680000, 76271625, 79143000, 146325270, 203205000, 281545875, 301694976, 344452500, 820260000, 1094951000, 2172667860, 2275896000, 2642777280, 2903770000, 3929713760, 4076399250, 4825673125, 6899079264, 8634368000 (twice), 12692520960&hellip;\n\nThe 248-dimensional representation is the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]].  There are two non-isomorphic irreducible representations of dimension 8634368000 (it is not unique; however, the next integer with this property is 175898504162692612600853299200000 {{OEIS|id=A181746}}).  The [[fundamental representation]]s are those with dimensions 3875, 6696000, 6899079264, 146325270, 2450240, 30380, 248 and 147250 (corresponding to the eight nodes in the [[#Dynkin diagram|Dynkin diagram]] in the order chosen for the [[#Cartan matrix|Cartan matrix]] below, i.e., the nodes are read in the seven-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third).\n\nThe coefficients of the character formulas for infinite dimensional irreducible [[representation theory|representation]]s of E<sub>8</sub> depend on some large square matrices consisting of polynomials, the [[Lusztig–Vogan polynomial]]s, an analogue of [[Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial]]s introduced for [[reductive group]]s in general by [[George Lusztig]] and [[David Kazhdan]] (1983). The values at 1 of the Lusztig–Vogan polynomials give the coefficients of the matrices relating the standard representations (whose characters are easy to describe) with the irreducible representations.\n\nThese matrices were computed after four years of collaboration by a [[atlas of Lie groups and representations|group of 18 mathematicians and computer scientists]], led by [[Jeffrey Adams (mathematician)|Jeffrey Adams]], with much of the programming done by [[Fokko du Cloux]]. The most difficult case (for exceptional groups)  is the split [[real form]] of  E<sub>8</sub> (see above), where the largest matrix is  of size 453060×453060. The Lusztig–Vogan polynomials for all other exceptional simple groups  have been known for some time; the calculation for the split form of ''E''<sub>8</sub> is far longer than any other case. The announcement of the result in March 2007 received extraordinary attention from the media (see the external links), to the surprise of the mathematicians working on it.\n\nThe representations of the E<sub>8</sub> groups over finite fields are given by [[Deligne–Lusztig theory]].\n\n== Constructions ==\n\nOne can construct the (compact form of the) E<sub>8</sub> group as the [[automorphism group]] of the corresponding '''e'''<sub>8</sub> Lie algebra. This algebra has a 120-dimensional subalgebra '''so'''(16) generated by ''J''<sub>''ij''</sub> as well as 128 new generators ''Q''<sub>''a''</sub> that transform as a [[Weyl–Majorana spinor]] of '''spin'''(16). These statements determine the commutators\n: <math>\\left[J_{ij}, J_{k\\ell}\\right] = \\delta_{jk}J_{i\\ell} - \\delta_{j\\ell}J_{ik} - \\delta_{ik}J_{j\\ell} + \\delta_{i\\ell}J_{jk}</math>\n\nas well as\n: <math>\\left[J_{ij}, Q_a\\right] = \\frac 14 \\left(\\gamma_i\\gamma_j-\\gamma_j\\gamma_i\\right)_{ab} Q_b,</math>\n\nwhile the remaining commutators (not anticommutators!) between the spinor generators are defined as\n: <math>\\left[Q_a, Q_b\\right] = \\gamma^{[i}_{ac}\\gamma^{j]}_{cb} J_{ij}.</math>\n\nIt is then possible to check that the [[Jacobi identity]] is satisfied.\n\n== Geometry ==\n\nThe compact real form of E<sub>8</sub> is the [[isometry group]] of the 128-dimensional exceptional compact [[Riemannian symmetric space]] EVIII (in Cartan's [[Riemannian symmetric space#Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces|classification]]). It is known informally as the \"[[octooctonionic projective plane]]\" because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the [[octonion]]s with themselves, and is also known as a [[Rosenfeld projective plane]], though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the [[Freudenthal magic square|''magic square'']], due to [[Hans Freudenthal]] and [[Jacques Tits]] {{harv|Landsberg|Manivel|2001}}.\n\n== E<sub>8</sub> root system ==\n[[File:e8 roots zome.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Zome]] model of the E<sub>8</sub> root system, projected into three-space, and represented by the vertices of the [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]], {{CDD|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|branch|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea_1}}]]\n[[File:4_21_E8_to_3D_H3_symmetry_concentric_hulls.png|thumb|300px|Shown in 3D projection using the basis vectors [u,v,w] giving H3 symmetry:\n{{ubl\n | u {{=}} (1, ''φ'', 0, −1, ''φ'', 0,0,0)\n | v {{=}} (''φ'', 0, 1, ''φ'', 0, −1,0,0)\n | w {{=}} (0, 1, ''φ'', 0, −1, ''φ'',0,0)\n}}\n\nThe projected [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]] vertices are sorted and tallied by their 3D norm generating the increasingly transparent hulls of each set of tallied norms.

In particular, the root system must be invariant under [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] through the hyperplane perpendicular to any root.\n\nThe '''E<sub>8</sub> root system''' is a rank 8 root system containing 240 root vectors spanning '''R'''<sup>8</sup>. It is [[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] in the sense that it cannot be built from root systems of smaller rank. All the root vectors in E<sub>8</sub> have the same length. It is convenient for a number of purposes to normalize them to have length {{radic|2}}.  These 240 vectors are the vertices of a [[semi-regular polytope]] discovered by [[Thorold Gosset]] in 1900, sometimes known as the [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]].\n\n===Construction===\nIn the so-called ''even coordinate system'', E<sub>8</sub> is given as the set of all vectors in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with length squared equal to 2 such that coordinates are either all [[integer]]s or all [[half-integer]]s and the sum of the coordinates is even.\n\nExplicitly, there are 112 roots with integer entries obtained from\n: <math>\\left(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,0,0,0,0,0,0\\right)\\,</math>\n\nby taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary [[permutation]] of coordinates, and 128 roots with half-integer entries obtained from\n: <math>\\left(\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12\\right) \\,</math>\n\nby taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be even). There are 240 roots in all.\n\n[[File:E8-with-thread.jpg|thumb|300px|E8 2d projection with thread made by hand]]\n\nThe 112 roots with integer entries form a D<sub>8</sub> root system. The E<sub>8</sub> root system also contains a copy of A<sub>8</sub> (which has 72 roots) as well as [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]] and [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] (in fact, the latter two are usually ''defined'' as subsets of E<sub>8</sub>).\n\nIn the ''odd coordinate system'', E<sub>8</sub> is given by taking the roots in the even coordinate system and changing the sign of any one coordinate. The roots with integer entries are the same while those with half-integer entries have an odd number of minus signs rather than an even number.\n\n===Dynkin diagram===\nThe [[Dynkin diagram]] for E<sub>8</sub> is given by [[File:Dynkin diagram E8.svg|120px]].\n\nThis diagram gives a concise visual summary of the root structure. Each node of this diagram represents a simple root. A line joining two simple roots indicates that they are at an angle of 120° to each other. Two simple roots which are not joined by a line are [[orthogonal]].\n\n===Cartan matrix===\nThe [[Cartan matrix]] of a rank ''r'' root system is an ''r × r'' [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] whose entries are derived from the simple roots. Specifically, the entries of the Cartan matrix are given by\n: <math>A_{ij} = 2\\frac{\\left(\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j\\right)}{\\left(\\alpha_i, \\alpha_i\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere (−,−) is the Euclidean [[inner product]] and ''α<sub>i</sub>'' are the simple roots.

In the compact group, both E<sub>7</sub>×SU(2)/(−1,−1) and E<sub>6</sub>×SU(3)/('''Z'''/3'''Z''') are [[maximal subgroup]]s of E<sub>8</sub>.\n\nThe 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E<sub>8</sub> may be considered in terms of its [[restricted representation]] to the first of these subgroups. It transforms under E<sub>7</sub>×SU(2) as a sum of [[tensor product representation]]s, which may be labelled as a pair of dimensions as (3,1) + (1,133) + (2,56) (since there is a quotient in the product, these notations may strictly be taken as indicating the infinitesimal (Lie algebra) representations). Since the adjoint representation can be described by the roots together with the generators in the [[Cartan subalgebra]], we may see that decomposition by looking at these. In this description,\n* (3,1) consists of the roots (0,0,0,0,0,0,1,−1), (0,0,0,0,0,0,−1,1) and the Cartan generator corresponding to the last dimension;\n* (1,133) consists of all roots with (1,1), (−1,−1), (0,0), (−½,−½) or (½,½) in the last two dimensions, together with the Cartan generators corresponding to the first seven dimensions;\n* (2,56) consists of all roots with permutations of (1,0), (−1,0) or (½,−½) in the last two dimensions.\n\nThe 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E<sub>8</sub>, when similarly restricted, transforms under E<sub>6</sub>×SU(3) as: (8,1) + (1,78) + (3,27) + (<u style=\"text-decoration:overline\">3</u>,<u style=\"text-decoration:overline\">27</u>). We may again see the decomposition by looking at the roots together with the generators in the Cartan subalgebra. In this description,\n* (8,1) consists of the roots with permutations of (1,−1,0) in the last three dimensions, together with the Cartan generator corresponding to the last two dimensions;\n* (1,78) consists of all roots with (0,0,0), (−½,−½,−½) or (½,½,½) in the last three dimensions, together with the Cartan generators corresponding to the first six dimensions;\n* (3,27) consists of all roots with permutations of (1,0,0), (1,1,0) or (−½,½,½) in the last three dimensions.\n* (<u style=\"text-decoration:overline\">3</u>,<u style=\"text-decoration:overline\">27</u>) consists of all roots with permutations of (−1,0,0), (−1,−1,0) or (½,−½,−½) in the last three dimensions.\n\nThe finite quasisimple groups that can embed in (the compact form of) E<sub>8</sub> were found by {{harvtxt|Griess|Ryba|1999}}.\n\nThe [[Dempwolff group]] is a subgroup of (the compact form of) E<sub>8</sub>. It is contained in the [[Thompson sporadic group]], which acts on the underlying vector space of the Lie group E<sub>8</sub> but does not preserve the Lie bracket. The Thompson group fixes a lattice and does preserve the Lie bracket of this lattice mod 3, giving an embedding of the Thompson group into E<sub>8</sub>('''F'''<sub>3</sub>).\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe E<sub>8</sub> Lie group has applications in [[theoretical physics]] and especially in [[string theory]] and [[supergravity]].

The group depends only on the dimension ''n'' of the space, and is commonly denoted E(''n'') or ISO(''n'').\n\nThe Euclidean group  E(''n'') comprises all [[translation (geometry)|translations]], [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]], and [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] of 𝔼<sup>''n''</sup>; and arbitrary finite combinations of them.  The Euclidean group can be seen as the [[symmetry group]] of the space itself, and contains the group of symmetries of any figure (subset) of that space.\n\nA Euclidean isometry can be ''direct'' or ''indirect'', depending on whether it preserves the handedness of figures.  The direct Euclidean isometries form a subgroup, the '''special Euclidean group''', whose elements are called [[rigid motion]]s or Euclidean motions. They comprise arbirary combinations of translations and rotations, but not reflections.\n\nThese [[group (mathematics)|group]]s are among the oldest and most studied, at least in the cases of dimension 2 and 3&nbsp;– implicitly, long before the concept of group was invented.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Dimensionality===\n\nThe number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] for E(''n'') is {{nowrap|''n''(''n'' + 1)/2}}, which gives 3 in case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, and 6 for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}. Of these, ''n'' can be attributed to available [[translational symmetry]], and the remaining {{nowrap|''n''(''n'' − 1)/2}} to [[rotational symmetry]].\n\n===Direct and indirect isometries===\n<!-- Articles with one or more link to this section:\n   \"Anisohedral tiling\";\n   \"Charts on SO(3)\";\n   \"Orientation (geometry)\";\n   \"Orthogonal group\";\n   \"Point groups in three dimensions\";\n   \"Point groups in two dimensions\";\n   \"Rigid body\";\n   \"Rotation group\";\n   \"Rotational symmetry\";\n   \"SE(2)\";\n   \"SE(3)\";\n   \"SE(n)\";\n   \"SO(5)\";\n   \"Spin tensor\";\n   \"Symmetry\";\n-->\n\nThe direct isometries (i.e., isometries preserving the [[orientation (mathematics)|handedness]] of [[chirality|chiral]] subsets) comprise a [[subgroup]] of E(''n''), called the special Euclidean group and usually denoted by E<sup>+</sup>(''n'') or  SE(''n'').   They include the translations and rotations, and combinations thereof; including the identity transformation, but excluding any reflections.\n\nThe isometries that reverse handedness are called \"indirect\".  For any fixed indirect isometry ''R'', such as a reflection about some hyperplane, every other indirect isometry can be obtained by the composition of ''R'' with some direct isometry.  Therefore, the indirect isometries are a [[coset]] of E<sup>+</sup>(''n''), which can be denoted by E<sup>−</sup>(''n'').  It follows that the subgroup E<sup>+</sup>(''n'') is of [[index of a subgroup|index]] 2 in E(''n'').\n\n===Topology of the group===\nThe natural [[topology]] of Euclidean space 𝔼<sup>''n''</sup> implies a topology for the Euclidean group E(''n'').  Namely, a sequence ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> of isometries of 𝔼<sup>''n''</sup> (''i''∈ℕ) is defined to converge if and only if, for any point ''p'' of 𝔼<sup>''n''</sup>, the sequence of points ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> converges.\n\nFrom this definition it follows that a function ''f'':[0,1]→E(''n'') is continuous if and only if, for any point ''p'' of 𝔼<sup>''n''</sup>, the function ''f''<sub>''p''</sub>:[0,1]→𝔼<sup>''n''</sup> defined by ''f''<sub>''p''</sub>(''t'') = (''f''(t))(''p'') is continuous.  Such a function is called a \"continuous trajectory\" in E(''n'').\n\nIt turns out that the special Euclidean group SE(''n'') = E<sup>+</sup>(''n'') is connected in this topology. That is, given any two direct isometries ''A'' and ''B'' of 𝔼<sup>''n''</sup>, there is a continuous trajectory ''f'' in E(''n'') such that ''f''(0) = ''A'' and ''f''(1) = ''B''.  The same is true for the indirect isometries E<sup>−</sup>(''n'').  On the other hand, the group E(''n'') as a whole is not connected: there is no continuous trajectory that starts in E<sup>+</sup>(''n'') and ends in E<sup>−</sup>(''n'').\n\nThe continuous trajectories in E(3) play an important role in [[classical mechanics]], because they describe the physically possible movements of a [[rigid body]] in three-dimensional space over time.  One takes ''f''(0) to be the  [[identity transformation]] ''I'' of  𝔼<sup>3</sup>, which describes the initial position of the body. The position and orientation of the body at any  later time ''t'' will be described by the transformation ''f''(t)   Since ''f''(0)=''I'' is in E<sup>+</sup>(3), the same must be true of ''f''(t) for any later time.  For that reason, the direct Euclidean isometries are also called \"rigid motions\".\n\n===Lie structure===\n\nThe Euclidean groups are not only [[topological group]]s, they are [[Lie group]]s, so that [[calculus]] notions can be adapted immediately to this setting.\n\n===Relation to the affine group===\nThe Euclidean group E(''n'') is a subgroup of the [[affine group]] for ''n'' dimensions, and in such a way as to respect the [[semidirect product]] structure of both{{clarify|date=October 2016}} groups. This gives, ''a fortiori'', two ways of writing elements in an explicit notation. These are:\n\n# by a pair {{nowrap|(''A'', ''b'')}}, with ''A'' an {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} [[orthogonal matrix]], and ''b'' a real [[column vector]] of size ''n''; or\n# by a single [[square matrix]] of size {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, as explained for the [[affine group]].\n\nDetails for the first representation are given in the next section.\n\nIn the terms of [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen programme]], we read off from this that [[Euclidean geometry]], the geometry of the Euclidean group of symmetries, is, therefore, a specialisation of [[affine geometry]]. All affine theorems apply. The origin of Euclidean geometry allows definition of the notion of [[distance]], from which [[angle]] can then be deduced.\n\n==Detailed discussion==\n\n===Subgroup structure, matrix and vector representation===\nThe Euclidean group is a subgroup of the group of [[affine transformation]]s.\n\nIt has as subgroups the [[translation (geometry)|translational]] group T(''n''), and the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n''). Any element of E(''n'') is a translation followed by an orthogonal transformation (the linear part of the isometry), in a unique way:\n\n:<math>x \\mapsto A (x + b)</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is an [[orthogonal matrix]]\n\nor the same orthogonal transformation followed by a translation:\n\n:<math>x \\mapsto A x + c,</math>\nwith {{math|1=''c'' = ''Ab''}}\n\nT(''n'') is a [[normal subgroup]] of E(''n''): for any translation ''t'' and any isometry ''u'', we have\n\n:''u''<sup>−1</sup>''tu''\n\nagain a translation (one can say, through a displacement that is ''u'' acting on the displacement of ''t''; a translation does not affect a displacement, so equivalently, the displacement is the result of the linear part of the isometry acting on ''t'').\n\nTogether, these facts imply that E(''n'') is the [[semidirect product]] of O(''n'') extended by T(''n''), which is written as <math>\\text{E}(n) = \\text{T}(n)\\rtimes \\text{O}(n)</math>. In other words, O(''n'') is (in the natural way) also the [[quotient group]] of E(''n'') by T(''n''):\n\n:<math>\\text{O}(n) \\cong \\text{E}(n) / \\text{T}(n)</math>\n\nNow SO(''n''), the [[special orthogonal group]], is a subgroup of O(''n''), of [[index of a subgroup|index]] two. Therefore, E(''n'') has a subgroup E<sup>+</sup>(''n''), also of index two, consisting of ''direct'' isometries. In these cases the determinant of ''A'' is 1.\n\nThey are represented as a translation followed by a [[rotation]], rather than a translation followed by some kind of [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] (in dimensions 2 and 3, these are the familiar reflections in a [[mirror]] line or plane, which may be taken to include the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], or in 3D, a [[Improper rotation|rotoreflection]]).\n\nThis relation is commonly written as:\n:<math>\\text{SO}(n)\\cong \\text{E}^+(n) / \\text{T}(n)</math>\n\nor, equivalently:\n:<math>\\text{E}^+(n)=\\text{SO}(n)\\ltimes \\text{T}(n)</math>.\n\n===Subgroups===<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry group]] -->\nTypes of subgroups of E(''n''):\n;[[Finite group]]s.:They always have a fixed point. In 3D, for every point there are for every orientation two which are maximal (with respect to inclusion) among the finite groups: O<sub>''h''</sub> and I<sub>''h''</sub>. The groups I<sub>''h''</sub> are even maximal among the groups including the next category.\n;Countably infinite groups without arbitrarily small translations, rotations, or combinations:  i.e., for every point the set of images under the isometries is topologically [[discrete space|discrete]] (e.g., for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''m'' ≤ ''n''}} a group generated by ''m'' translations in independent directions, and possibly a finite point group). This includes [[lattice (group)|lattice]]s. Examples more general than those are the discrete [[space group]]s.\n;Countably infinite groups with arbitrarily small translations, rotations, or combinations:  In this case there are points for which the set of images under the isometries is not closed. Examples of such groups are, in 1D, the group generated by a translation of 1 and one of {{radic|2}}, and, in 2D, the group generated by a rotation about the origin by 1 radian.\n;Non-countable groups, where there are points for which the set of images under the isometries is not closed:  (e.g., in 2D all translations in one direction, and all translations by rational distances in another direction).\n;Non-countable groups, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is closed:  e.g.:\n:*all direct isometries that keep the origin fixed, or more generally, some point (in 3D called the [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation group]])\n:*all isometries that keep the origin fixed, or more generally, some point (the [[orthogonal group]])\n:*all direct isometries E<sup>+</sup>(''n'')\n:*the whole Euclidean group E(''n'')\n:*one of these groups in an ''m''-dimensional subspace combined with a discrete group of isometries in the orthogonal (''n''−''m'')-dimensional space\n:*one of these groups in an ''m''-dimensional subspace combined with another one in the orthogonal (''n''−''m'')-dimensional space\n\nExamples in 3D of combinations:\n*all rotations about one fixed axis\n*ditto combined with reflection in planes through the axis and/or a plane perpendicular to the axis\n*ditto combined with discrete translation along the axis or with all isometries along the axis\n*a discrete point group, frieze group, or wallpaper group in a plane, combined with any symmetry group in the perpendicular direction\n*all isometries which are a combination of a rotation about some axis and a proportional translation along the axis; in general this is combined with ''k''-fold rotational isometries about the same axis ({{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 1}}); the set of images of a point under the isometries is a ''k''-fold [[helix]]; in addition there may be a 2-fold rotation about a perpendicularly intersecting axis, and hence a ''k''-fold helix of such axes.\n*for any point group: the group of all isometries which are a combination of an isometry in the point group and a translation; for example, in the case of the group generated by inversion in the origin: the group of all translations and inversion in all points; this is the generalized [[dihedral group]] of R<sup>3</sup>, Dih(R<sup>3</sup>).\n\n===Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Isometry]] -->\nE(1), E(2), and E(3) can be categorized as follows, with [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Isometries of E(1)\n!

A Lie group, such as a one-dimensional circle, may be understood as a smooth [[manifold]] with a fixed, highly symmetric geometry. Larger Lie groups, as higher-dimensional manifolds, may be imagined as smooth surfaces composed of many circles (and hyperbolas) twisting around one another. At each point in a N-dimensional Lie group there can be N different orthogonal circles, tangent to N different orthogonal directions in the Lie group, spanning the N-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] of the Lie group. For a Lie group of rank R, one can choose at most R orthogonal circles that do not twist around each other, and so form a ''maximal torus'' within the Lie group, corresponding to a collection of R mutually-commuting Lie algebra generators, spanning a ''Cartan subalgebra''. Each elementary particle state can be thought of as a different orthogonal direction, having an integral number of twists around each of the R directions of a chosen maximal torus. These R twist numbers (each multiplied by a scaling factor) are the R different kinds of elementary charge that each particle has. Mathematically, these charges are [[eigenvalues]] of the Cartan subalgebra generators, and are called [[Root system|roots]] or [[Weight (representation theory)|weights]] of a [[Lie algebra representation|representation]].\n\nIn the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, each different kind of elementary particle has four different [[Charge (physics)|charges]], corresponding to twists along directions of a four-dimensional maximal torus in the twelve-dimensional Standard Model Lie group, SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1). The two strong “color” charges, g<sup>3</sup> and g<sup>8</sup>, correspond to twists along directions in the two-dimensional maximal torus of the eight-dimensional SU(3) Lie group of the [[strong interaction]]. The [[weak isospin]], T<sub>3</sub> (or W), and [[weak hypercharge]], Y<sub>W</sub> (or Y), correspond to twists along directions in the two-dimensional maximal torus of the four-dimensional SU(2)×U(1) Lie group of the [[electroweak interaction]], with W and Y combining as electric charge, Q. Whenever an interaction occurs between elementary particles, with two coming together and becoming a third, or one particle becoming two, each type of charge must be conserved. For example, a red [[up quark]], having [[quantum numbers|charges]] (g<sup>3</sup><math>{}=\\tfrac {1}{2}</math>, g<sup>8</sup><math>{}=\\tfrac {1}{2{\\sqrt{3}}}</math>, ''W''<math>=\\tfrac {1}{2}</math>, ''Y''<math>{}=\\tfrac {1}{3}</math>) can interact with a [[weak boson]], ''W''<sup>−</sup>, having charges (''g''<sup>3</sup> = 0, ''g''<sup>8</sup> = 0, ''W'' = −1, ''Y'' = 0), to produce a red [[down quark]], having charges (''g''<sup>3</sup> <math>{}=\\tfrac {1}{2}</math>, ''g''<sup>8</sup><math>{}=\\tfrac {1}{2{\\sqrt{3}}}</math>, ''W''<math>{}=\\tfrac {-1}{2}</math>, ''Y''<math>{}=\\tfrac {1}{3}</math>). The complete pattern of all Standard Model particle charges in four dimensions may be projected down to two dimensions and plotted in a charge diagram.\n\nIn [[grand unified theories]] (GUTs), the 12-dimensional Standard Model Lie group, SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) (modded by '''Z'''<sub>6</sub>), is considered as a subgroup of a higher-dimensional Lie group, such as of 24-dimensional [[SU(5)]] in the [[Georgi–Glashow model]] or of 45-dimensional [[Spin group|Spin(10)]] in the [[SO(10) (physics)|SO(10) model]] (Spin(10) being the double cover of SO(10), and having the same Lie algebra). Since there is a different elementary particle for each dimension of the Lie group, in addition to the 12 Standard Model [[gauge bosons]] there are 12 [[X and Y bosons]] in the SU(5) Model and 18 more X bosons and 3 [[W' and Z' bosons]] in Spin(10). In Spin(10) there is a five-dimensional maximal torus, and the Standard Model hypercharge, Y, is a combination of two new Spin(10) charges: “weaker charge”, W', and [[B − L|baryon minus lepton number]], B. In the Spin(10) model, one generation of 16 fermions (including left-handed electrons, neutrinos, three colors of up quarks, three colors of down quarks, and their anti-particles) lives neatly in the 16-complex-dimensional [[spinor]] representation space of Spin(10). The combination of these 32 real fermions and 45 bosons, along with another U(1) Lie group (corresponding to [[Peccei–Quinn symmetry]]), constitute the 78-dimensional real compact exceptional Lie group, [[E6 (mathematics)|E6]]. (This unusual algebraic structure, reminiscent of [[supersymmetry]], of gauge fields and spinors combined in a simple Lie group, is characteristic of the exceptional groups.)\n\nAs well as being in some representation space of the Standard Model or Grand Unified Theory Lie group, each physical fermion is a [[spinor]] under the [[Cartan formalism (physics)|gravitational]] noncompact [[Spin connection|Spin(1,3)]] Lie group of rotations and boosts. This six-dimensional Lie group has a two-dimensional maximal torus (technically a hyperboloid) and thus two kinds of charge, [[Spin (physics)|spin]], S<sub>z</sub>, and boost, S<sub>t</sub>. A [[Dirac fermion]] (consisting of fermion and anti-fermion) has eight real degrees of freedom corresponding to its real vs. imaginary parts, left or right '''chirality''', and being spin up or down. Using the Lie group equivalence of Spin(1,3) and SL(2,'''C'''), and the [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of Standard Model [[weak force]] fermion interactions, each fermion (and each anti-fermion) can be described as a two-complex-dimensional left-chiral [[Weyl spinor]] under gravitational SL(2,'''C'''). Accounting for the up or down spin for each of the 16 left-chiral fermions of one generation (or 15 fermions if neutrinos are [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]]), each fermion generation corresponds to 64 (or 60) real degrees of freedom.\n\nIn GraviGUT unification, the gravitational Spin(1,3) and Spin(10) GUT Lie groups are combined (modded by '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>) as parts of a Spin(11,3) Lie group, acting on each generation of fermions in a real 64-dimensional spinor representation. The remaining parts of Spin(11,3) include the 4-dimensional [[Frame fields in general relativity|spacetime frame]] and a [[Higgs field]] transforming as a 10 under Spin(10). The resulting [[gauge theory]] of [[Gauge gravitation theory|gravity]], Higgs, and [[gauge bosons]] is an extension of the [[MacDowell–Mansouri action|MacDowell-Mansouri formalism]] to higher dimensions. Several physicists objected to the apparent violation of the [[Coleman-Mandula theorem]], which states the impossibility of mixing gravity and gauge fields in a unified Lie group over spacetime, given reasonable assumptions. Proponents of GraviGUT unification and E<sub>8</sub> Theory claim that the Coleman-Mandula theorem is not violated because the assumptions are not met.<ref name=\"Roberto Percacci 2008\">{{cite journal |author=Roberto Percacci |arxiv=0803.0303 |title=Mixing internal and spacetime transformations: some examples and counterexamples |date=2008 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/41/33/335403 |volume=41 |issue=33 |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical |page=335403|bibcode = 2008JPhA...41G5403P }}</ref>\n\nIn E<sub>8</sub> Theory, it is observed that the GraviGUT algebra of spin(11,3) acting on one generation of fermions in a real positive-chiral 64-spinor, 64<sub>+</sub>, can be part of the 248-dimensional real quaternionic e8 Lie algebra,\n:e8 = spin(12,4) + 128<sub>+</sub>\n\nThe strongest criticism of E<sub>8</sub> Theory, stated by Distler, Garibaldi, and others, including Lisi in the original paper, is that given an embedding of gravitational spin(1,3) in the spin(12,4) subalgebra of e8, the 128<sub>+</sub> includes not only the 64<sub>+</sub> of a generation of fermions, but a 64<sub>−</sub> “anti-generation” of [[Mirror matter|mirror fermions]] with non-physical chirality. Since we do not see mirror fermions in nature, Distler and Garibaldi consider this to be a disproof of E<sub>8</sub> Theory. Lisi has voiced two responses to this criticism. The first response is that these mirror fermions might exist and have very large masses. The second response, stated in the original paper and in his latest work, is that there is not a single embedding of gravitational spin(1,3) in e8, but three embeddings related by [[triality]], with respect to which the 64<sub>−</sub> contains a second generation of physical fermions, and the third generation of fermions is contained within spin(12,4).<ref name=\"virginia_edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/A_Geometric_Theory_of_Everything.pdf |title=A Geometric Theory of Everything}}</ref>\n\nThe algebraic breakdown of the 248-dimensional e8 Lie algebra relevant to E8 Theory is\n:e8 = spin(4,4) + spin(8) + 8<sub>V</sub> ⊗ 8<sub>V</sub> + 8<sub>+</sub> ⊗ 8<sub>+</sub> + 8<sub>−</sub> ⊗ 8<sub>−</sub>\n\nThis decomposition, attributed to [[Bertram Kostant]], relies on the [[triality]] isomorphism between eight-dimensional vectors, 8<sub>v</sub>, positive-chiral spinors, 8<sub>+</sub>, and negative-chiral spinors, 8<sub>−</sub>, relating to the division algebra of the [[octonions]].<ref name=\"octonions\">{{Cite journal | ref = harv | last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez | title = The Octonions | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | issn = 0273-0979 | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–205 | date = 2002 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-01-00934-X | arxiv = math/0105155 | mr = 1886087 | access-date = 2015-12-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081009232658/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | archive-date = 2008-10-09 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}</ref> Within this decomposition, the strong force su(3) embeds in spin(8), three triality-related gravitational spin(1,3)’s embed in spin(4,4), the three [[Generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 60 fermions embed in 8<sub>V</sub> ⊗ 8<sub>V</sub> + 8<sub>+</sub> ⊗ 8<sub>+</sub> + 8<sub>−</sub> ⊗ 8<sub>−</sub>, and the gravitational frame, Higgs, and electroweak bosons embed throughout, with 18 colored X bosons remaining as new predicted particles.<ref name=\"BB\">{{cite news |title=The Big Bang: what will we find? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/03/25/scicomments125.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2008-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn E<sub>8</sub> Theory's current state, it is not possible to calculate masses for the existing or predicted particles. Lisi states the theory is young and incomplete, requiring a better understanding of the three fermion generations and their masses, and places a low confidence in its predictions. However, the discovery of new particles that do not fit in Lisi's classification, such as [[superpartner]]s or new fermions, would fall outside the model and falsify the theory.\n\n==Technical overview==\n\nThe fundamental geometric idea of E<sub>8</sub> Theory is that our universe and its contents exists as quantum excitations of the largest simple real quaternionic exceptional Lie group, ''E''<sub>8(−24)</sub>. This is described via an extension of [[Cartan geometry]] employing a '''superconnection'''. The relevant Cartan geometry is modeled on [[Klein geometry]], beginning with a [[homogeneous space]], G/H, in which the initial Lie group is ''G'' = ''E''<sub>8(−24)</sub> and the subgroup is ''H'' = SL(2,'''C''')xS(U(3)×U(2))x'''Z'''<sub>3</sub>, in which '''Z'''<sub>3</sub> = {1,''T'',''T''<sup>2</sup>} is the [[cyclic group]] of order three corresponding to a triality automorphism, T, of E<sub>8(−24)</sub>.<ref name=\"Lisi4\"/>\n\nUsually, in Cartan geometry, the deformation of a Lie group, ''G'', preserving the structure of a subgroup, ''H'', is described by allowing the Lie group's [[Maurer–Cartan form]], θ, to vary, becoming the [[Cartan connection]],\n:''C'' = ''W'' + ''Ɛ''\n\nThe resulting geometry, ''G̃'', is that of a [[principal bundle]], with W the [[Connection (principal bundle)|principal H-connection]], a [[1-form]] valued in Lie(H) over a base manifold, ''B'', modeled on ''G''/''H'', with the '''frame''', Ɛ, a 1-form valued in Lie(G/H). If H is a reductive subgroup of ''G'', the [[Curvature form|curvature]] of the Cartan connection is\n:''F''<sub>''C''</sub> = ''dC'' + ''CC'' = (''dW'' + ''WW'' + ''ƐƐ'') + (''dƐ'' + ''WƐ'' + ''ƐW'')\n\nIn Lisi's extension of Cartan geometry, the Cartan connection over B is interpreted as a superconnection,\n:''G'' = ''W'' + ''E'' + ''Ψ''\n\nover spacetime, M (a subspace of B), in which, Ψ, a Lie(G/H) valued 1-form over B assumed to be orthogonal to M, is interpreted as a set of three fermionic ([[Grassmann number]]) fields over M, valued in Lie(G/H), related by triality, T.<ref name=\"Lisi4\"/> According to Lisi, the description of Grassmann number fermions as 1-forms orthogonal to spacetime, valued in a spinor representation, provides a clear geometric understanding of what fermions are.<ref name=\"Horgan\"/> In E<sub>8</sub> Theory, the H-connection is physically the gravitational [[spin connection]], ½ω, plus the Standard Model and X boson gauge fields, H = g + W + B + X, while E is the 1-form frame over M, assumed to equal the gravitational frame 1-form, e, times (in the [[Clifford algebra]] sense) the Higgs, E = eΦ. The fermionic part of the superconnection, Ψ, is interpreted as the three generation multiplets of Standard Model [[fermions]]. The curvature of the resulting superconnection,\n:G = ½ω + H + eΦ + Ψ\nis\n:F = dG + GG = (½R − e e Φ<sup>2</sup>) + F<sub>H</sub> + (TΦ + eDΦ) + DΨ + ΨΨ\n\nin which R = dω + ½ωω is the gravitational [[Riemann curvature tensor|Riemann curvature]] 2-form, F<sub>H</sub> = d H + H H is the [[Curvature form|gauge field curvature]], T = de + ½ωe + ½eω is the [[Torsion tensor|gravitational torsion]], DΦ = dΦ + [H,Φ] is the [[Gauge covariant derivative|covariant derivative]] of the Higgs, and DΨ = dΨ + [½ω + H + eΦ,Ψ]  is the [[Dirac equation|covariant Dirac derivative]] of the fermions in curved spacetime.\n\nIn this geometric description, physical four-dimensional spacetime, M, is considered as a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of gauge-related subspaces of G̃. For the case in which the curvature vanishes, F = 0, there is no excitation of the Lie group, G, and the Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value, Φ=Φ<sub>0</sub>, corresponding to a positive [[cosmological constant]], Λ = − 12 Φ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>, with the vacuum spacetime, as a subspace of G, identified as [[de Sitter space]]time, satisfying R = −6Λee.\n\nWithin a Lie group, the [[Maurer–Cartan form]], θ, is the natural frame and determines the [[Haar measure]] for integration over the group manifold. With the [[Killing form]] of the Lie algebra, this also determines a natural [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and [[Hodge dual|Hodge duality operator]] on the group manifold. For a deforming Lie group, the Maurer–Cartan form is replaced by the superconnection, G, defined over the entire deforming Lie group manifold via [[gauge transformation]]. This superconnection, G, determines the [[Hodge dual|Hodge duality operator]], <math>\\star</math>, and the curvature, F, of the deforming Lie group. The action for E<sub>8</sub> Theory is the [[Yang–Mills action]], integrated over the entire deforming Lie group.\n:S = ½ <math>\\displaystyle \\int</math> (F,<math>\\star</math>F)\n\nSince the structure of the H subgroup and fermionic directions of B are preserved, this action reduces to an integral over spacetime,\n:S = ½ V <math>\\displaystyle \\int</math> {(ee,<math>\\star</math>ee) Φ<sup>4</sup> − (R,<math>\\star</math>ee) Φ<sup>2</sup> + ¼ (R,<math>\\star</math>R) + (DΦ,<math>\\star</math>DΦ) − (T,<math>\\star</math>T) Φ<sup>2</sup> + (F<sub>H</sub>,<math>\\star</math>F<sub>H</sub>) + (DΨ,<math>\\star</math>DΨ)}\n\nin which V is a constant volume factor, and the Hodge star, <math>\\star</math>, is now the Hodge star for M determined by the gravitational frame, e. As well as the usual [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] for gravity, [[Yang–Mills action]], and Higgs action, this action includes a quadratic torsion term, a quadratic curvature term, and a quadratic spinor Lagrangian.<ref name=\"Lisi4\"/>\n\n==Chronology and reaction==\nThree previous arXiv preprints by Lisi deal with mathematical physics related to the theory. \"Clifford Geometrodynamics\",<ref>{{cite arXiv |author=A.

It is named after [[Hans Freudenthal]] and [[Jacques Tits]], who developed the idea independently. It associates a Lie algebra to a pair of division algebras ''A'', ''B''. The resulting Lie algebras have [[Dynkin diagram]]s according to the table at right. The \"magic\" of the Freudenthal magic square is that the constructed Lie algebra is symmetric in ''A'' and ''B'', despite the original construction not being symmetric, though [[#Vinberg's symmetric method|Vinberg's symmetric method]] gives a symmetric construction.\n\nThe Freudenthal magic square includes all of the [[exceptional Lie group]]s apart from [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]], and it provides one possible approach to justify the assertion that \"the exceptional Lie groups all exist because of the [[octonions]]\": ''G''<sub>2</sub> itself is the [[automorphism group]] of the octonions (also, it is in many ways like a [[classical Lie group]] because it is the stabilizer of a generic 3-form on a 7-dimensional vector space &ndash; see [[prehomogeneous vector space]]).\n\n==Constructions==\nSee [[#History|history]] for context and motivation. These were originally constructed circa 1958 by Freudenthal and Tits, with more elegant formulations following in later years.<ref name=\"baez200243\" />\n\n===Tits' approach===\nTits' approach, discovered circa 1958 and published in {{Harv|Tits|1966}}, is as follows.\n\nAssociated with any normed real [[division algebra]] ''A'' (i.e., R, C, H or O) there is a [[Jordan algebra]], ''J''<sub>3</sub>(''A''), of 3 × 3 ''A''-[[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]]. For any pair (''A'', ''B'') of such division algebras, one can define a [[Lie algebra]]\n\n:<math> L=\\left (\\mathfrak{der}(A)\\oplus\\mathfrak{der}(J_3(B))\\right )\\oplus \\left (A_0\\otimes J_3(B)_0 \\right )</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{der}</math> denotes the Lie algebra of [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]s of an algebra, and the subscript 0 denotes the [[trace-free]] part. The Lie algebra ''L'' has <math>\\mathfrak{der}(A)\\oplus\\mathfrak{der}(J_3(B))</math> as a subalgebra, and this acts naturally on <math>A_0\\otimes J_3(B)_0</math>. The Lie bracket on <math>A_0\\otimes J_3(B)_0</math> (which is not a subalgebra) is not obvious, but Tits showed how it could be defined, and that it produced the following table of [[compact Lie algebra]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! || B|| R|| C|| H|| O\n|-\n! A|| ''der''(A/B)|| 0|| 0|| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_1</math>|| <math>\\mathfrak{g}_2</math>\n|-\n! R|| 0\n|<math>\\mathfrak{so}_3</math>||<math>\\mathfrak{su}_3</math>||<math>\\mathfrak{sp}_3</math>||<math>\\mathfrak{f}_4</math>\n|-\n! C|| 0\n|<math>\\mathfrak{su}_3</math>||<math>\\mathfrak{su}_3\\oplus\\mathfrak{su}_3</math>||<math>\\mathfrak{su}_6</math>||<math>\\mathfrak{e}_6</math>\n|-\n! H|| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_1</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_3</math>|| <math>\\mathfrak{su}_6</math>|| <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{12}</math> || <math>\\mathfrak{e}_7</math>\n|-\n! O|| <math>\\mathfrak{g}_2</math>\n|| <math>\\mathfrak{f}_4</math>|| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_6</math>|| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_7</math>|| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_8</math>\n|}\n\nNote that by construction, the row of the table with ''A''='''R''' gives <math>\\mathfrak{der}(J_3(B))</math>, and similarly vice versa.\n\n===Vinberg's symmetric method===\nThe \"magic\" of the Freudenthal magic square is that the constructed Lie algebra is symmetric in ''A'' and ''B''. This is not obvious from Tits' construction. [[Ernest Vinberg]] gave a construction which is manifestly symmetric, in {{Harv|Vinberg|1966}}. Instead of using a Jordan algebra, he uses an algebra of skew-hermitian trace-free matrices with entries in ''A'' ⊗ ''B'', denoted <math>\\mathfrak{sa}_3(A\\otimes B)</math>. Vinberg defines a Lie algebra structure on\n:<math> \\mathfrak{der}(A)\\oplus\\mathfrak{der}(B)\\oplus\\mathfrak{sa}_3(A\\otimes B).</math>\nWhen ''A'' and ''B'' have no derivations (i.e., '''R''' or '''C'''), this is just the Lie (commutator) bracket on <math>\\mathfrak{sa}_3(A\\otimes B)</math>. In the presence of derivations, these form a subalgebra acting naturally on <math>\\mathfrak{sa}_3(A\\otimes B)</math> as in Tits' construction, and the tracefree commutator bracket on <math>\\mathfrak{sa}_3(A\\otimes B)</math> is modified by an expression with values in <math> \\mathfrak{der}(A)\\oplus\\mathfrak{der}(B)</math>.\n\n===Triality===\nA more recent construction, due to [[Pierre Ramond]] {{Harv|Ramond|1976}} and Bruce Allison {{Harv|Allison|1978}} and developed by Chris Barton and [[Tony Sudbery|Anthony Sudbery]], uses [[triality]] in the form developed by [[John Frank Adams]]; this was presented in {{Harv|Barton|Sudbery|2000}}, and in streamlined form in {{Harv|Barton|Sudbery|2003}}. Whereas Vinberg's construction is based on the automorphism groups of a division algebra ''A'' (or rather their Lie algebras of derivations), Barton and Sudbery use the group of automorphisms of the corresponding triality. The triality is the trilinear map\n:<math> A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3 \\to \\mathbf R</math>\nobtained by taking three copies of the division algebra ''A'', and using the inner product on ''A'' to dualize the multiplication. The automorphism group is the subgroup of SO(''A''<sub>1</sub>) × SO(''A''<sub>2</sub>) × SO(''A''<sub>3</sub>) preserving this trilinear map. It is denoted Tri(''A''). The following table compares its Lie algebra to the Lie algebra of derivations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''A'':\n! '''R'''\n! '''C'''\n! '''H'''\n! '''O'''\n|-\n! <math>\\mathfrak{der}(A)</math>\n| 0\n| 0\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_1</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{g}_2</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\mathfrak{tri}(A)</math>\n| 0\n| <math>\\mathfrak u_1 \\oplus \\mathfrak u_1</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_1 \\oplus \\mathfrak{sp}_1\\oplus \\mathfrak{sp}_1</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{so}_8</math>\n|}\n\nBarton and Sudbery then identify the magic square Lie algebra corresponding to (''A'',''B'') with a Lie algebra structure on the vector space\n:<math> \\mathfrak{tri}(A)\\oplus\\mathfrak{tri}(B)\\oplus (A_1\\otimes B_1)\\oplus (A_2\\otimes B_2)\\oplus (A_3\\otimes B_3). </math>\nThe Lie bracket is compatible with a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> × '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> grading, with '''tri'''(''A'') and '''tri'''(''B'') in degree (0,0), and the three copies of ''A'' ⊗ ''B'' in degrees (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). The bracket preserves '''tri'''(''A'') and '''tri'''(''B'') and these act naturally on the three copies of ''A'' ⊗ ''B'', as in the other constructions, but the brackets between these three copies are more constrained.\n\nFor instance when ''A'' and ''B'' are the octonions, the triality is that of Spin(8), the double cover of SO(8), and the Barton-Sudbery description yields\n:<math>\\mathfrak e_8\\cong \\mathfrak{so}_8\\oplus\\widehat{\\mathfrak{so}}_8\\oplus(V\\otimes \\widehat V)\\oplus (S_+\\otimes\\widehat S_+)\\oplus (S_-\\otimes \\widehat S_-)</math>\nwhere V, S<sub>+</sub> and S<sub>−</sub> are the three 8-dimensional representations of <math>\\mathfrak{so}_8</math> (the fundamental representation and the two [[spin representation]]s), and the hatted objects are an isomorphic copy.\n\nWith respect to one of the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> gradings, the first three summands combine to give <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{16}</math> and the last two together form one of its spin representations Δ<sub>+</sub><sup>128</sup> (the superscript denotes the dimension). This is a well known [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric decomposition]] of [[E8 (mathematics)|E8]].\n\nThe Barton–Sudbery construction extends this to the other Lie algebras in the magic square. In particular, for the exceptional Lie algebras in the last row (or column), the symmetric decompositions are:\n:<math>\\mathfrak f_4\\cong \\mathfrak{so}_9\\oplus \\Delta^{16}</math>\n:<math>\\mathfrak e_6\\cong (\\mathfrak{so}_{10}\\oplus \\mathfrak u_1)\\oplus \\Delta^{32}</math>\n:<math>\\mathfrak e_7\\cong (\\mathfrak{so}_{12}\\oplus \\mathfrak{sp}_1)\\oplus \\Delta_+^{64}</math>\n:<math>\\mathfrak e_8\\cong \\mathfrak{so}_{16}\\oplus \\Delta_+^{128}.</math>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Split composition algebras===\nIn addition to the [[normed division algebra]]s, there are other [[composition algebra]]s over '''R''', namely the [[split-complex number]]s, the [[split-quaternions]] and the [[split-octonions]]. If one uses these instead of the complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions, one obtains the following variant of the magic square (where the split versions of the division algebras are denoted by a dash).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In particular, for the exceptional Lie algebras, the maximal compact subalgebras are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Split form\n| <math>\\mathfrak{f}_{4(4)}</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{6(6)}</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{7(7)}</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{8(8)}</math>\n|-\n!

According to Barton and Sudbery, the resulting table of Lie algebras is as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! A\\B\n! R\n! C\n! H\n! O\n|-\n!

This yields the following magic square.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<math>\\mathfrak{so}_3(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_3(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sp}_6(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{f}_{4}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_3(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_3(\\mathbf K)\\oplus\\mathfrak{sl}_3(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_6(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{e}_{6}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|-\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_6(\\mathbf K)</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_6(\\mathbf K)</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{12}(\\mathbf K)</math> \n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{7}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|-\n| <math>\\mathfrak{f}_{4}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{6}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{7}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{e}_{8}(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|}\nThere is some ambiguity here if '''K''' is not algebraically closed. In the case '''K''' = '''C''', this is the complexification of the Freudenthal magic squares for '''R''' discussed so far.\n\n===More general Jordan algebras===\nThe squares discussed so far are related to the Jordan algebras ''J''<sub>3</sub>(''A''), where ''A'' is a division algebra. There are also Jordan algebras ''J<sub>n</sub>''(''A''), for any positive integer ''n'', as long as ''A'' is associative. These yield split forms (over any field '''K''') and compact forms (over '''R''') of generalized magic squares.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<math>\\mathfrak{so}_n(\\mathbf K)</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{su}_n</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{sp}_n</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{su}_n</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbf K)\\oplus\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{su}_n\\oplus\\mathfrak{su}_n</math>\n|<math>\\mathfrak{sl}_{2n}(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{su}_{2n}</math>\n|-\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{sp}_n</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_{2n}(\\mathbf K)\\text{ or }\\mathfrak{su}_{2n}</math>\n| <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\\mathbf K)</math> \n|}\n\nFor ''n'' = 2, J<sub>''2''</sub>(''O'') is also a Jordan algebra. In the compact case (over '''R''') this yields a magic square of orthogonal Lie algebras.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! A\\B\n! R\n! C\n! H\n! O\n|-\n!

[[prehomogeneous vector space]]s.\n\n===Symmetric spaces===\n[[Riemannian symmetric space]]s, both compact and non-compact, can be classified uniformly using a magic square construction, in {{Harv|Huang|Leung|2011}}. The irreducible compact symmetric spaces are, up to finite covers, either a compact simple Lie group, a Grassmannian, a [[Lagrangian Grassmannian]], or a [[double Lagrangian Grassmannian]] of subspaces of <math>(\\mathbf A \\otimes \\mathbf B)^n,</math> for normed division algebras '''A''' and '''B'''. A similar construction produces the irreducible non-compact symmetric spaces.\n\n==History==\n\n===Rosenfeld projective planes===\nFollowing [[Ruth Moufang]]'s discovery in 1933 of the [[Cayley projective plane]] or \"octonionic projective plane\" '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''O'''), whose symmetry group is the exceptional Lie group [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and with the knowledge that [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]] is the automorphism group of the octonions, it was proposed by {{harvtxt|Rozenfeld|1956}} that the remaining exceptional Lie groups [[E6 (mathematics)|''E''<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|''E''<sub>7</sub>]], and [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] are isomorphism groups of projective planes over certain algebras over the octonions:<ref name=\"baez200243\">{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node16.html 4.3 The Magic Square]}}</ref>\n* the '''{{visible anchor|bioctonions}}''', '''C''' ⊗ '''O''',\n* the '''{{visible anchor|quateroctonions}}''', '''H''' ⊗ '''O''',\n* the '''{{visible anchor|octooctonions}}''', '''O''' ⊗ '''O'''.\nThis proposal is appealing, as there are certain exceptional compact [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s with the desired symmetry groups and whose dimension agree with that of the putative projective planes (dim('''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''K''' ⊗ '''K'''′)) = 2&nbsp;dim('''K''')dim('''K'''′)), and this would give a uniform construction of the exceptional Lie groups as symmetries of naturally occurring objects (i.e., without an a priori knowledge of the exceptional Lie groups). The Riemannian symmetric spaces were classified by Cartan in 1926 (Cartan's labels are used in sequel); see [[Riemannian symmetric space#Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces|classification]] for details, and the relevant spaces are:\n* the [[octonionic projective plane]] – FII, dimension 16 = 2 × 8, F<sub>4</sub> symmetry, [[Cayley projective plane]] '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''O'''),\n* the bioctonionic projective plane – EIII, dimension 32 = 2 × 2 × 8, E<sub>6</sub> symmetry, complexified Cayley projective plane, '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''' ⊗ '''O'''),\n* the \"'''{{visible anchor|quateroctonionic projective plane}}'''\"<ref name=\"baez200245\">{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node18.html 4.5 '''E'''<sub>7</sub>]}}</ref> – EVI, dimension 64 = 2 × 4 × 8, E<sub>7</sub> symmetry, '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''H''' ⊗ '''O'''),\n* the \"'''{{visible anchor|octooctonionic projective plane}}'''\"<ref name=\"baez200246\">{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc= [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node19.html 4.6 '''E'''<sub>8</sub>]}}</ref> – EVIII, dimension 128 = 2 × 8 × 8, E<sub>8</sub> symmetry, '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''O''' ⊗ '''O''').\nThe difficulty with this proposal is that while the octonions are a division algebra, and thus a projective plane is defined over them, the bioctonions, quateroctonions and octooctonions are not division algebras, and thus the usual definition of a projective plane does not work. This can be resolved for the bioctonions, with the resulting projective plane being the complexified Cayley plane, but the constructions do not work for the quateroctonions and octooctonions, and the spaces in question do not obey the usual axioms of projective planes,<ref name=\"baez200243\" /> hence the quotes on \"(putative) projective plane\". However, the tangent space at each point of these spaces can be identified with the plane ('''H''' ⊗ '''O''')<sup>2</sup>, or ('''O''' ⊗ '''O''')<sup>2</sup> further justifying the intuition that these are a form of generalized projective plane.<ref name=\"baez200245\" /><ref name=\"baez200246\" /> Accordingly, the resulting spaces are sometimes called '''Rosenfeld projective planes''' and notated as if they were projective planes. More broadly, these compact forms are the '''Rosenfeld elliptic projective planes''', while the dual non-compact forms are the '''Rosenfeld hyperbolic projective planes'''. A more modern presentation of Rosenfeld's ideas is in {{Harv|Rosenfeld|1997}}, while a brief note on these \"planes\" is in {{Harv|Besse|1987|loc=pp. 313–316}}.<ref>\"[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/twf_ascii/week106 This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics – Week 106]\", [[John Baez]] July 23, 1997</ref>\n\nThe spaces can be constructed using Tits' theory of buildings, which allows one to construct a geometry with any given algebraic group as symmetries, but this requires starting with the Lie groups and constructing a geometry from them, rather than constructing a geometry independently of a knowledge of the Lie groups.<ref name=\"baez200243\" />\n\n===Magic square===\nWhile at the level of manifolds and Lie groups, the construction of the projective plane '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''K''' ⊗ '''K'''′) of two normed division algebras does not work, the corresponding construction at the level of Lie algebras ''does'' work. That is, if one decomposes the Lie algebra of infinitesimal isometries of the projective plane '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''K''') and applies the same analysis to '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''K''' ⊗ '''K'''′), one can use this decomposition, which holds when '''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''K''' ⊗ '''K'''′) can actually be defined as a projective plane, as a ''definition'' of a \"magic square Lie algebra\" ''M''('''K''','''K'''′). This definition is purely algebraic, and holds even without assuming the existence of the corresponding geometric space. This was done independently circa 1958 in {{Harv|Tits|1966}} and by Freudenthal in a series of 11 papers, starting with {{Harv|Freudenthal|1954}} and ending with {{Harv|Freudenthal|1963}}, though the simplified construction outlined here is due to {{Harv|Vinberg|1966}}.<ref name=\"baez200243\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[E8 (mathematics)]]\n* [[E7 (mathematics)]]\n* [[E6 (mathematics)]]\n* [[F4 (mathematics)]]\n* [[G2 (mathematics)]]\n* [[Jordan triple system]]\n* [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]\n* [[Euclidean Jordan algebra]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=Lectures on Exceptional Lie Groups |last=Adams |first=John Frank |authorlink=John Frank Adams |editor1-last=Mahmud |editor1-first=Zafer |editor2-last=Mimura |editor2-first=Mamora |year=1996 |series=Chicago Lectures in Mathematics |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-00527-0 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv | first=B.N. |last=Allison | title=Structurable Algebras  |journal= Math.

      "text": "In [[representation theory]] of [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s, a '''fundamental representation''' is an [[irreducible representation|irreducible finite-dimensional representation]] of a [[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] Lie group\nor Lie algebra whose [[highest weight]] is a [[fundamental weight]]. For example, the defining module of a [[classical Lie group]] is a fundamental representation. Any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie group or Lie algebra can be constructed from the fundamental representations by a procedure due to [[Élie Cartan]]. Thus in a certain sense, the fundamental representations are the elementary building blocks for arbitrary finite-dimensional representations.\n\n== Examples ==\n* In the case of the [[general linear group]], all fundamental representations are [[exterior power]]s of the defining module. \n* In the case of the special unitary group [[SU(n)|SU(''n'')]], the ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 fundamental representations are the wedge products <math>\\operatorname{Alt}^k\\ {\\mathbb C}^n</math> consisting of the [[alternating tensor]]s, for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n* The [[spin representation]] of the twofold cover of an odd [[orthogonal group]], the odd [[spin group]], and the two half-spin representations of the twofold cover of an even orthogonal group, the even spinor group, are fundamental representations that cannot be realized in the space of tensors.\n* The [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]] of the simple Lie group of type [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] is a fundamental representation.\n\n== Explanation ==\n\nThe [[Irreducible representation | irreducible representations]] of a [[simply-connected]] [[compact group| compact]] [[Lie group]] are indexed by their highest [[weight (representation theory)|weights]]. These weights are the lattice points in an orthant ''Q''<sub>+</sub> in the [[weight lattice]] of the Lie group consisting of the dominant integral weights. It can be proved\nthat there exists a set of ''fundamental weights'', indexed by the vertices of the [[Dynkin diagram]], such that any dominant integral weight is a non-negative integer linear combinations of the fundamental weights.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.35</ref> The corresponding irreducible representations are the '''fundamental representations''' of the Lie group. From the expansion of a dominant weight in terms of the fundamental weights one can take a corresponding tensor product of the fundamental representations and extract one copy of the irreducible representation corresponding to that dominant weight.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} See the proof of Proposition 6.7 in the case of SU(3)</ref>\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nOutside of Lie theory, the term ''fundamental representation'' is sometimes loosely used to refer to a smallest-dimensional faithful representation, though this is also often called the ''standard'' or ''defining'' representation (a term referring more to the history, rather than having a well-defined mathematical meaning).\n\n== References ==\n*{{Fulton-Harris}}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-0-387-40122-5}}.\n\n;Specific\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Representation theory]]"

In particular, if <math> M </math> is a [[smooth manifold]] and <math> X</math> is a smooth [[Vector field#Vector fields on manifolds|vector field]], one is interested in finding [[integral curve]]s to <math> X </math>.

Similarly, there is a bijective correspondence between symplectic actions (the induced [[diffeomorphisms]] are all [[symplectomorphisms]]) and complete [[symplectic vector field]]s. \n\nA closely related idea is that of [[Hamiltonian vector field]]s. Given a symplectic manifold <math> (M,\\omega) </math>, we say that <math> X_H</math> is a Hamiltonian vector field if there exists a [[smooth function]] <math> H: M \\to \\mathbb R </math> satisfying\n:<math> dH = \\iota_{X_H}\\omega </math>\nwhere the map <math> \\iota </math> is the [[interior product]].

The  [[Sigma-algebra|<math>\\sigma</math>-algebra]] generated by all open subsets of <math>G</math>  is called the [[Borel algebra]]. An element of the Borel algebra is called a [[Borel set]].  If <math>g</math> is an element of <math>G</math> and <math>S</math> is a subset of <math>G</math>, then we define the left and right [[Coset|translates]] of <math>S</math> as follows:\n* Left translate:\n::<math> g S = \\{g\\cdot s\\,:\\,s \\in S\\}.</math>\n* Right translate:\n::<math> S g = \\{s\\cdot g\\,:\\,s \\in S\\}.</math>\n\nLeft and right translates map Borel sets into Borel sets.\n\nA measure <math>\\mu</math> on the Borel subsets of <math>G</math> is called ''left-translation-invariant'' if for all Borel subsets <math>S\\subset G</math> and all <math>g\\in G</math> one has\n:<math> \\mu(g S) = \\mu(S). \\quad </math>\nA measure <math>\\mu</math> on the Borel subsets of <math>G</math> is called ''right-translation-invariant'' if for all Borel subsets <math>S\\subset G</math> and all <math>g\\in G</math> one has\n:<math> \\mu(S g) = \\mu(S). \\quad </math>\n\n==Haar's theorem==\nThere is, [[up to]] a positive multiplicative constant, a unique [[countably additive]], nontrivial measure <math>\\mu</math> on the Borel subsets of <math>G</math> satisfying the following properties:\n\n* The measure <math>\\mu</math> is left-translation-invariant: <math>\\mu(gS) = \\mu(S)</math> for every <math>g\\in G</math> and all Borel sets <math>S\\subset G</math>.\n* The measure <math>\\mu</math> is finite on every compact set: <math>\\mu(K)<\\infty</math> for all compact <math>K\\subset G</math>.\n* The measure <math>\\mu</math> is  [[outer regular]] on Borel sets <math>S\\subset G</math>:\n::<math> \\mu(S) = \\inf \\{\\mu(U): S \\subseteq U, U \\text{ open}\\}.</math>\n\n* The measure <math>\\mu</math> is [[inner regular]] on open sets <math>U\\subset G</math>:\n::<math> \\mu(U) = \\sup \\{\\mu(K): K \\subseteq U, K \\text{ compact}\\}.</math>\n\nSuch a measure on <math>G</math> is called a ''left Haar measure.''  It can be shown as a consequence of the above properties that <math>\\mu(U)>0</math> for every non-empty open subset <math>U\\subset G</math>. In particular, if <math>G</math> is compact then <math>\\mu(G)</math> is finite and positive, so we can uniquely specify a left Haar measure on <math>G</math> by adding the normalization condition <math>\\mu(G)=1</math>.\n\nSome authors define a Haar measure on [[Baire set]]s rather than Borel sets. This makes the regularity conditions unnecessary as Baire measures are automatically regular. Halmos<ref>{{cite book|last1=Halmos|first1=Paul R.|title=Measure theory|date=1950|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4684-9442-6|page=219-220}}</ref> rather confusingly uses the term \"Borel set\" for elements of the <math>\\sigma</math>-ring generated by compact sets, and defines Haar measure on these sets.\n\nThe left Haar measure satisfies the inner regularity condition for all <math>\\sigma</math>-finite Borel sets, but may not be inner regular for ''all'' Borel sets.  For example, the product of the unit circle (with its usual topology) and the real line with the discrete topology is a locally compact group with the product topology and Haar measure on this group is not inner regular for the closed subset <math>\\{1\\} \\times [0,1]</math>. (Compact subsets of this vertical segment are finite sets and points have measure <math>0</math>, so the measure of any compact subset of this vertical segment is <math>0</math>. But, using outer regularity, one can show the segment has infinite measure.)\n\nThe existence and uniqueness (up to scaling) of a left Haar measure was first proven in full generality by [[André Weil]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = L'intégration dans les groupes topologiques et ses applications | series = Actualités Scientifiques et Industrielles | publisher = Hermann | year = 1940 | place = Paris | volume = 869}}''</ref> Weil's proof used the [[axiom of choice]] and [[Henri Cartan]] furnished a proof which avoided its use.<ref>{{Citation | last = Cartan | first = Henri | author-link = Henri Cartan | title = Sur la mesure de Haar | journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de Paris]] | volume = 211 | pages = 759–762 | year = 1940}}</ref> Cartan's proof also establishes the existence and the uniqueness simultaneously.

This is not additive on compact sets <math>K\\subset G</math>, though it does have the property that <math>[K:U]+[L:U]=[K\\cup L:U]</math> for disjoint compact sets <math>K,L\\subset G</math> provided that <math>U</math> is a sufficiently small open neighborhood of the identity (depending on <math>K</math> and <math>L</math>).  The idea of Haar measure is to take a sort of limit of <math>[K:U]</math> as <math>U</math> becomes smaller to make it additive on all pairs of disjoint compact sets, though it first has to be normalized so that the limit is not just infinity. So fix a compact set <math>A</math> with non-empty interior (which exists as the group is locally compact) and for a compact set <math>K</math> define\n:<math>\\mu_A(K)=\\lim_U\\frac{[K:U]}{[A:U]}</math>\nwhere the limit is taken over a suitable directed set of open neighborhoods of the identity eventually contained in any given neighborhood; the existence of a directed set such that the limit exists follows using [[Tychonoff's theorem]].\n\nThe function <math>\\mu_A</math> is additive on disjoint compact subsets of <math>G</math>, which implies that it is a regular [[content (measure theory)|content]]. From a regular content one can construct a measure by first extending  <math>\\mu_A</math> to open sets by inner regularity, then to all sets by outer regularity, and then restricting it to Borel sets. (Even for open sets <math>U</math>, the corresponding measure <math>\\mu_A(U)</math> need not be given by the lim sup formula above. The problem is that the function given by the lim sup formula is not countably subadditive in general and in particular is infinite on any set without compact closure, so is not an outer measure.)\n\n===A construction using compactly supported functions===\n\nCartan introduced  another way of constructing Haar measure as a [[Radon measure]] (a positive linear functional on compactly supported continuous functions) which is similar to the construction above except that <math>A</math>, <math>K</math>, and <math>U</math> are positive continuous functions of compact support rather than subsets of <math>G</math>. In this case we define <math>[K:U]</math> to be the infimum of numbers <math>c_1+\\cdots+c_n</math> such that <math>K(g)</math> is less than the linear combination <math>c_1 U(g_1 g)+\\cdots+c_n U(g_n g)</math> of left translates of <math>U</math> for some <math>g_1,\\ldots,g_n\\in G</math>.\nAs before we define\n:<math>\\mu_A(K)=\\lim_U\\frac{[K:U]}{[A:U]}</math>.\nThe fact that the limit exists takes some effort to prove, though the advantage of doing this is that the proof avoids the use of the axiom of choice and also gives uniqueness of Haar measure as a by-product. The functional <math>\\mu_A</math> extends to a positive linear functional on compactly supported continuous functions and so gives a Haar measure. (Note that even though the limit is linear in <math>K</math>, the individual terms <math>[K:U]</math> are not usually linear in <math>K</math>.)\n\n===A construction using mean values of functions===\n\nVon Neumann gave a method of constructing Haar measure using mean values of functions, though it only works for compact groups. The idea is that given a function <math>f</math> on a compact group, one can find a [[convex combination]] <math>\\sum a_i f(g_i g)</math> (where <math>\\sum a_i=1</math>) of its left translates that differs from a constant function by at most some small number <math>\\epsilon</math>. Then one shows that as <math>\\epsilon</math> tends to zero the values of these constant functions tend to a limit, which is called the mean value (or integral) of the function <math>f</math>.\n\nFor groups that are locally compact but not compact this construction does not give Haar measure as the mean value of compactly supported functions is zero. However something like this does work for [[almost periodic function]]s on the group which do have a mean value, though this is not given with respect to Haar measure.\n\n===A construction on Lie groups===\n\nOn an ''n''-dimensional Lie group, Haar measure can be constructed easily as the measure induced by a left-invariant ''n''-form. This was known before Haar's theorem.\n\n==The right Haar measure==\n\nIt can also be proved that there exists a unique (up to multiplication by a positive constant) right-translation-invariant Borel measure <math> \\nu</math> satisfying the above regularity conditions and being finite on compact sets, but it need not coincide with the  left-translation-invariant measure <math>\\mu</math>. The left and right Haar measures are the same only for so-called ''unimodular groups'' (see below). It is quite simple, though, to find a relationship between <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.\n\nIndeed, for a Borel set <math>S</math>, let us denote by <math>S^{-1}</math> the set of inverses of elements of <math>S</math>. If we define \n:<math> \\mu_{-1}(S) = \\mu(S^{-1}) \\quad </math>\nthen this is a right Haar measure. To show right invariance,  apply the definition:\n\n:<math> \\mu_{-1}(S g) = \\mu((S g)^{-1}) = \\mu(g^{-1} S^{-1}) = \\mu(S^{-1}) = \\mu_{-1}(S). \\quad </math>\n\nBecause the right measure is unique, it follows that <math>\\mu_{-1}</math> is a multiple of <math>\\nu</math> and so\n:<math>\\mu(S^{-1})=k\\nu(S)\\,</math>\nfor all Borel sets <math>S</math>, where <math>k</math> is some positive constant.\n\n===The modular function===\n\nThe ''left'' translate of a right Haar measure is a right Haar measure. More precisely, if <math>\\nu</math> is a right Haar measure, then\n\n:<math> S \\mapsto \\nu (g^{-1} S) \\quad </math>\n\nis also right invariant.  Thus, by uniqueness of the Haar measure, there exists a function <math>\\Delta</math> from the group to the positive reals, called the '''Haar modulus''', '''modular function''' or '''modular character''', such that for every Borel set <math>S</math>\n\n:<math> \\nu (g^{-1} S) = \\Delta(g) \\nu(S). \\quad</math>\n\nSince right Haar measure is well-defined up to a positive scaling factor, this equation shows the modular function is independent of the choice of right Haar measure in the above equation.\n\nThe modular function is a continuous group homomorphism into the multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]]. A group is called '''unimodular''' if the modular function is identically <math>1</math>, or, equivalently, if the Haar measure is both left and right invariant. Examples of unimodular groups are [[abelian group]]s, [[compact group]]s, [[discrete group]]s (e.g., [[finite group]]s), [[semisimple Lie group]]s and connected [[nilpotent Lie group]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} An example of a non-unimodular group is the group of affine transformations\n\n:<math>\\big\\{ x \\mapsto a x + b : a\\in\\R\\setminus\\{0\\}, b\\in\\R \\big\\}=\\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix}\n a & b \\\\\n0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\right\\}</math>\n\non the real line. This example shows that a solvable Lie group need not be unimodular.\nIn this group a left Haar measure is given by <math>\\frac{1}{a^2}da\\wedge db</math>, and a right Haar measure by <math>\\frac{1}{|a|}da\\wedge db</math>.\n\n==Measures on homogeneous spaces==\n\nIf the locally compact group <math>G</math> acts transitively on a [[homogeneous space]] <math>G/H</math>, one can ask if this space has an invariant measure, or more generally a semi-invariant measure with the property that <math>\\mu(gS) = \\chi(g)\\mu(S)</math> for some character <math>\\chi</math> of <math>G</math>. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a measure is that the restriction <math>\\chi|_H</math> is equal to <math>\\Delta|_H/\\delta</math>, where <math>\\Delta</math> and <math>\\delta</math> are the modular functions of <math>G</math> and <math>H</math> respectively. \nIn particular an invariant measure on <math>G/H</math> exists if and only if the modular function <math>\\Delta</math> of <math>G</math> restricted to <math>H</math> is the modular function <math>\\delta</math> of <math>H</math>.\n\n===Example=== \n\nIf <math>G</math> is the group <math>SL_2(\\mathbb{R})</math> and <math>H</math> is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices, then the modular function of <math>H</math> is nontrivial but the modular function of <math>G</math> is trivial. The quotient of these cannot be extended to any character of <math>G</math>, so the quotient space <math>G/H</math> (which can be thought of as 1-dimensional [[real projective space]]) does not have even a semi-invariant measure.\n\n==Haar integral==\n{{expand section|date=December 2011}}\nUsing the general theory of [[Lebesgue integration]], one can then define an integral for all Borel measurable functions <math>f</math>  on  <math>G</math>. This integral is called the '''Haar integral'''.   If <math>\\mu</math> is a left Haar measure, then\n:<math> \\int_G f(sx) \\ d\\mu(x) = \\int_G f(x) \\ d\\mu(x) </math>\nfor any Haar integrable function <math>f</math> on <math>G</math>. This is immediate for [[indicator function]]s, being essentially the definition of left invariance.\n:<math> \\int \\mathit{1}_A(tg)\\,dg = \\int \\mathit{1}_{t^{-1}A}(g)\\,dg=\\mu(t^{-1}A)=\\mu(A)=\\int\\mathit{1}_A(g)\\,dg </math>\n\n==Examples==\n\n* A Haar measure on the topological group <math>(\\mathbb{R}, +)</math> which takes the value <math>1</math> on the interval <math>[0,1]</math> is equal to the restriction of [[Lebesgue measure]] to the Borel subsets of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>. This can be generalized to <math>(\\mathbb{R}^n, +)</math>.\n* If <math>G</math> is the group of nonzero real numbers with multiplication as operation, then a Haar measure <math>\\mu</math> is given by\n::<math> \\mu(S) = \\int_S \\frac{1}{|t|} \\, dt </math>\n:for any Borel subset <math>S</math> of the nonzero reals.\n\n:For example, if <math>S</math> is taken to be an interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then we find <math>\\mu(S) = \\log(b/a)</math>. Now we let the multiplicative group act on this interval by a multiplication of all its elements by a number <math>g</math>, resulting in <math>gS</math> being the interval <math>[g\\cdot a,g\\cdot b]</math>. Measuring this new interval, we find <math> \\mu(gS) = \\log((g\\cdot b)/(g\\cdot a)) = \\log(b/a) = \\mu(S) </math>.\n\n* If the group <math>G</math> is represented as an open submanifold of <math>R^n</math> then a left Haar measure on <math>G</math> is given by <math>\\frac{1}{J(x)}d^n x</math>, where <math>J(x)</math> is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of left multiplication by <math>x</math>. A right Haar measure is given in the same way, except with <math>J(x)</math> the Jacobian of right multiplication by <math>x</math>.\n* As a special case of the previous construction, for <math>G = GL(n,\\mathbb{R})</math>, any left Haar measure is a right Haar measure and one such measure <math>\\mu</math> is given by\n::<math> \\mu(S) = \\int_S {1\\over |\\det(X)|^n} \\, dX </math>\n:where <math>dX</math> denotes the Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}</math> identified with the set of all <math>n\\times n</math>-matrices.  This follows from the [[change of variables formula]].\n* On any [[Lie group]] of dimension <math>d</math> a left Haar measure can be associated with any non-zero left-invariant <math>d</math>-form <math>\\omega</math>, as the ''Lebesgue measure'' <math>|\\omega|</math>; and similarly for right Haar measures. This means also that the modular function can be computed, as the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]].\n* In order to define a Haar measure <math>\\mu</math> on the [[circle group]] <math>\\mathbb{T}</math>, consider the function <math>f</math> from <math>[0,2\\pi]</math> onto <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> defined by <math>f(t)=(\\cos(t),\\sin(t))</math>. Then <math>\\mu</math> can be defined by\n::<math>\\mu(S)=\\frac1{2\\pi}m\\left(f^{-1}(S)\\right),</math>\n:where <math>m</math> is the Lebesgue measure. The factor <math>(2\\pi)^{-1}</math> is chosen so that <math>\\mu(\\mathbb{T})=1</math>.\n\n* The [[unit hyperbola]] <math>\\{(x,y) : x^2 - y^2 = 1 , x > 0 \\}</math> can be taken is a group under multiplication defined as with [[split-complex number]]s <math>z = x + y j, \\ \\ j^2 = +1 .</math> The usual [[area]] measure in the crescent <math>C = \\{(x,y) : |y| < x, \\ \\ x^2 - y^2 < 1 \\}</math> serves to define [[hyperbolic angle]] as the area of its [[hyperbolic sector]]. The Haar measure of the unit hyperbola is generated by the hyperbolic angle of segments on the hyperbola. For instance, a measure of one unit is given by the segment running from (1,1) to (e,1/e), where e is [[Euler's number]].

These prior measures are used to construct [[admissible procedure]]s, by appeal to the characterization of admissible procedures as [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian procedures]] (or limits of Bayesian procedures) by [[Abraham Wald|Wald]]. For example, a right Haar measure for a family of distributions with a [[location parameter]] results in the [[Pitman Estimator|Pitman estimator]], which is [[minimum variance unbiased estimator|best]] [[equivariant estimator|equivariant]]. When left and right Haar measures differ, the right measure is usually preferred as a prior distribution. For the group of affine transformations on the parameter space of the normal distribution, the right Haar measure is the [[Jeffreys prior]] measure<!-- improper \"prior\", not a probability distribution  -->.<ref>{{Citation | first = James O.| last = Berger | author-link = James O.

In invariant-theoretic conditional inference, the sampling distribution is conditioned on an invariant of the group of transformations (with respect to which the Haar measure is defined). The result of conditioning sometimes depends on the order in which invariants are used and on the choice of a [[maximal invariant]], so that by itself a  [[statistical principle]] of invariance fails to select any unique best conditional statistic (if any exist); at least another principle is needed.\n\nFor non-compact groups, statisticians have extended Haar-measure results using [[amenable group]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bondar | first1 = James V. | last2 = Milnes | first2 = Paul | year = 1981 | title = Amenability: A survey for statistical applications of Hunt–Stein and related conditions on groups | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 103–128 | doi = 10.1007/BF00533716 }}</ref>\n\n==Weil's converse theorem==\n\nIn 1936 Weil proved a converse (of sorts) to Haar's theorem, by showing that if a group has a left invariant measure for which one can define a convolution product, then one can define a topology on the group, and the completion of the group is locally compact and the given measure is essentially the same as the Haar measure on this completion.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Pontryagin duality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | last1 = Diestel | first1 = Joe | last2 = Spalsbury | first2 = Angela | author2-link = Angela Spalsbury | isbn = 978-1-4704-0935-7 | location = Providence, RI | mr = 3186070 | publisher = American Mathematical Society | series = Graduate Studies in Mathematics | title = The joys of Haar measure | volume = 150 | year = 2014}}\n*{{citation|first=Lynn|last=Loomis|authorlink=Lynn Harold Loomis|title=An Introduction to Abstract Harmonic Analysis|publisher=D. van Nostrand and Co.|year=1953}}.\n*{{citation|mr=0156915|last1=Hewitt|first1= Edwin|last2=Ross|first2= Kenneth A.\n|title=Abstract harmonic analysis.

Elements ''a, b'' and ''c'' can be taken from any [[commutative ring]] with identity, often taken to be the ring of [[real number]]s (resulting in the \"continuous Heisenberg group\") or the ring of [[integer]]s (resulting in the \"discrete Heisenberg group\").\n\nThe continuous Heisenberg group arises in the description of one-dimensional [[quantum mechanical]] systems, especially in the context of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]]. More generally, one can consider Heisenberg groups associated to ''n''-dimensional systems, and most generally, to any [[symplectic vector space]].\n\n==The three-dimensional case==\nIn the three-dimensional case, the product of two Heisenberg matrices is given by:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a & c\\\\\n 0 & 1 & b\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a' & c'\\\\\n 0 & 1 & b'\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a+a' & c+c'+ab'\\\\\n 0 & 1 & b+b'\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\\, .</math>\nSince the multiplication is not commutative, the group is [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]].\n\nThe neutral element of the Heisenberg group is the [[identity matrix]], and inverses are given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a & c\\\\\n 0 & 1 & b\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}^{-1}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & -a & ab-c\\\\\n 0 & 1 & -b\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\\,  .</math>\n\nThe group is a subgroup of the 2-dimensional affine group Aff(2):  <math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a & c\\\\\n 0 & 1 & b\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math> acting on <math>(\\vec{x},1)</math> corresponds to the affine transform <math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a\\\\\n 0 & 1 \n\\end{pmatrix}{\\vec  x}+\\begin{pmatrix}\nc\\\\\n b\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>.\n\nThere are several prominent examples of the three-dimensional case.\n\n===Continuous Heisenberg group===\nIf {{math|''a, b, c''}}, are [[real number]]s (in the ring '''R''') then one has the '''continuous Heisenberg group''' H<sub>3</sub>('''R''').\n\nIt is a [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] real [[Lie group]] of dimension 3.\n\nIn addition to the representation as real 3x3 matrices, the continuous Heisenberg group also has several different [[group representation|representations]] in terms of [[function space]]s. By [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]], there is, up to isomorphism, a unique irreducible unitary representation of H in which its [[center of a group|centre]] acts by a given nontrivial [[Character theory|character]]. This representation has several important realizations, or models. In the ''Schrödinger model'', the Heisenberg group acts on the space of [[square integrable]] functions. In the [[theta representation]], it acts on the space of [[holomorphic function]]s on the [[upper half-plane]]; it is so named for its connection with the [[theta function]]s.\n\n===Discrete Heisenberg group===\n[[Image:HeisenbergCayleyGraph.png|thumb|350px|right|A portion of the [[Cayley graph]] of the discrete Heisenberg group, with generators ''x,y,z'' as in the text. (The coloring is only for visual aid.)]]\n\nIf {{math|''a, b, c''}},  are integers (in the ring '''Z''') then one has the '''discrete Heisenberg group''' H<sub>3</sub>('''Z'''). It is a [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] [[nilpotent group]]. It has two generators,\n:<math>x=\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\\ \\ y=\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nand relations\n\n:<math> z^{}_{}=xyx^{-1}y^{-1},\\  xz=zx,\\  yz=zy </math>,\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>z=\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\n 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nis the generator of the [[center of a group|center]] of H<sub>3</sub>. (Note that the inverses of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' replace the 1 above the diagonal with −1.)\n\nBy [[Bass's theorem]], it has a polynomial [[Growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] of order 4.\n\nOne can generate any element through\n::<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & a & c\\\\\n 0 & 1 & b\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}=y^bz^cx^a\\, .</math>\n\n=== Heisenberg group modulo an odd prime ''p'' ===\nIf one takes ''a, b, c'' in [[modular arithmetic|'''Z'''/''p'' '''Z''']] for an odd [[prime number|prime]] ''p'', then one has the '''Heisenberg group modulo''' '''''p'''''. It is a group of [[order (group theory)|order]] ''p''<sup>3</sup> with generators ''x,y'' and relations:\n\n:<math> z^{}_{}=xyx^{-1}y^{-1},\\   x^p=y^p=z^p=1,\\  xz=zx,\\  yz=zy. </math>\n\nAnalogues of Heisenberg groups over ''finite'' fields of odd prime order ''p'' are called [[extra special group]]s, or more properly, extra special groups of [[exponent (group theory)|exponent]] ''p''.  More generally, if the [[derived subgroup]] of a group ''G'' is contained in the center ''Z'' of  ''G'', then the map from ''G/Z'' × ''G/Z'' → ''Z'' is a skew-symmetric bilinear operator on abelian groups.\n\nHowever, requiring that ''G/Z'' to be a finite [[vector space]] requires the [[Frattini subgroup]] of ''G'' to be contained in the center, and requiring that ''Z'' be a one-dimensional vector space over '''Z'''/''p'' '''Z''' requires that ''Z'' have order ''p'', so if ''G'' is not abelian, then ''G'' is extra special.  If ''G'' is extra special but does not have exponent ''p'', then the general construction below applied to the symplectic vector space ''G/Z'' does not yield a group isomorphic to ''G''.\n\n===Heisenberg group modulo 2===\nThe Heisenberg group modulo 2 is of order 8 and is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] D<sub>4</sub> (the symmetries of a square).

The other reflections are ''xyx'' and ''yxy'', and rotation by 180° is ''xyxy'' (=''yxyx'').\n\n==Lie algebra==\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak h</math> of the Heisenberg group <math>H</math> (over the real numbers) is the space of <math>3\\times 3</math> matrices of the form<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.26</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n 0 & a & b\\\\\n 0 & 0 & c\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>,\nwith <math>a,b,c\\in\\mathbb R</math>.

The simplest general case is the real Heisenberg group of dimension <math>2n+1</math>, for any integer <math>n\\geq 1</math>. As a group of matrices,  <math>H_{2n+1}</math> (or <math>H_{2n+1}(\\mathbb R)</math> to indicate this is the Heisenberg group over the field <math>\\mathbb R</math> of real numbers) is defined as the group <math>(n+2)\\times (n+2)</math> matrices with entries in <math>\\mathbb R</math> and having the form:\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwhere\n: '''a''' is a [[row vector]] of length ''n'',\n: '''b''' is a [[column vector]] of length ''n'',\n: ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.\n\n===Group Structure===\nThis is indeed a group, as is shown by the multiplication:\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\mathbf a' & c' \\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b' \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf a+ \\mathbf a' & c+c' +\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b' \\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b+\\mathbf b' \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}  </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}1 & -\\mathbf a & -c +\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b\\\\ 0 & I_n & -\\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & I_n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.  </math>\n\n===Lie algebra===\nThe Heisenberg group is a [[simply-connected]] Lie group whose [[Lie algebra]] consists of matrices\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & 0_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n\nwhere\n\n: '''a''' is a row vector of length ''n'', \n: '''b''' is a column vector of length ''n'',\n: 0<sub>''n''</sub> is the [[zero matrix]] of size ''n''.\n\nBy letting e<sub>1</sub>, ..., e<sub>''n''</sub> be the canonical basis of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and setting\n\n:<math> p_i = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\operatorname{e}_i^{\\mathrm{T}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0_n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n:<math> q_j = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0_n & \\operatorname{e}_j \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n:<math> z = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0  & 1\\\\ 0 & 0_n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n\nthe associated [[Lie algebra]] can be characterized by the [[canonical commutation relations]],\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\begin{bmatrix} p_i, q_j \\end{bmatrix} = \\delta_{ij}z,   \\qquad \n\\begin{bmatrix}  p_i, z \\end{bmatrix} = 0,  \\qquad \\begin{bmatrix}  q_j, z \\end{bmatrix} = 0~,</math>|1}}\n\nwhere ''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''q''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''q''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''z'' are the algebra generators.\n\nIn particular, ''z'' is a ''central'' element of the Heisenberg Lie algebra. Note that the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group is nilpotent.\n\n===Exponential Map===\nThe [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] is given by the following expression\n\n:<math> \\exp  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & 0_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & 0_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}^k = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf a & c + {1\\over 2}\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b\\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\nThe exponential map of a nilpotent Lie algebra is a [[diffeomorphism]] between the Lie algebra and the unique associated [[connected space|connected]], [[simply-connected]] Lie group.\n\nThis discussion (aside from statements referring to dimension and Lie group) further applies if we replace '''R''' by any commutative ring ''A''. The corresponding group is denoted ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'' ).\n\nUnder the additional assumption that the prime 2 is invertible in the ring ''A'', the exponential map is also defined, since it reduces to a finite sum and has the form above (i.e. ''A'' could be a ring '''Z'''/''p'' '''Z''' with an odd prime ''p'' or any [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0).\n\n== Representation theory ==\n{{main|Stone–von Neumann theorem}}\n\nThe unitary [[Lie group representation|representation theory]] of the Heisenberg group is fairly simple – later generalized by [[Mackey theory]] – and was the motivation for its introduction in quantum physics, as discussed below.\n\nFor each nonzero real number <math>\\hbar</math>, we can define an irreducible unitary representation <math>\\Pi_\\hbar</math> of <math>H_{2n+1}</math> acting on the Hilbert space <math>L^2(\\mathbb R^n)</math> by the formula:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 14.7</ref>\n\n:<math> \\left[\\Pi_\\hbar\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\mathbf a & c \\\\ 0 & I_n & \\mathbf b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\psi\\right](x)=e^{i\\hbar c}e^{ib\\cdot x}\\psi(x+\\hbar a) </math>\n\nThis representation is known as the [[Oscillator representation#Commutation relations of Heisenberg and Weyl|Schrödinger representation]]. The motivation for this representation is the action of the exponentiated [[position operator|position]] and [[momentum operator]]s in quantum mechanics. The parameter <math>a</math> describes translations in position space, the parameter <math>b</math> describes translations in momentum space, and the parameter <math>c</math> gives an overall phase factor. The phase factor is needed to obtain a group of operators, since translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute.\n\nThe key result is the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]], which states that every (strongly continuous) irreducible unitary representation of the Heisenberg group in which the center acts nontrivially is equivalent to <math>\\Pi_\\hbar</math> for some <math>\\hbar</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 14.8</ref> Alternatively, that they are all equivalent to the [[Weyl algebra]] (or [[CCR algebra]]) on a symplectic space of dimension 2''n''.\n\nSince the Heisenberg group is a one-dimensional central extension of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, its irreducible unitary representations can be viewed as irreducible unitary [[projective representation]]s of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. Conceptually, the representation given above constitutes the quantum mechanical counterpart to the group of translational symmetries on the classical phase space, <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. The fact that the quantum version is only a ''projective'' representation of <math>R^{2n}</math> is suggested already at the classical level. The Hamiltonian generators of translations in phase space are the position and momentum functions. The span of these functions do not form a Lie algebra under the [[Poisson bracket]] however, because <math>\\{x_i,p_j\\}=\\delta_{i,j}.</math> Rather, the span of the position and momentum functions ''and the constants'' forms a Lie algebra under the Poisson bracket. This Lie algebra is a one-dimensional central extension of the commutative Lie algebra <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group.\n\n==On symplectic vector spaces==\nThe general abstraction of a Heisenberg group is constructed from any [[symplectic vector space]].<ref>Hans Tilgner, \"[http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=AIHPA_1970__13_2_103_0 A class of solvable Lie groups and their relation to the canonical formalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605030417/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=AIHPA_1970__13_2_103_0 |date=2011-06-05 }}\", ''Annales de l'institut Henri Poincaré (A) Physique théorique'', '''13 ''' no. 2 (1970), pp. 103-127.</ref>  For example, let (''V'',ω) be a finite-dimensional real symplectic vector space (so ω is a [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] [[skew symmetric]] [[bilinear form]] on ''V'').  The Heisenberg group H(''V'') on (''V'',ω) (or simply ''V'' for brevity) is the set ''V''×'''R''' endowed with the group law\n\n:<math>(v,t)\\cdot(v',t') =\\left (v+v',t+t'+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\omega(v,v')\\right).</math>\n\nThe Heisenberg group is a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the additive group ''V''.  Thus there is an [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0\\to\\mathbf{R}\\to H(V)\\to V\\to 0.</math>\n\nAny symplectic vector space admits a [[Symplectic vector space#Standard symplectic space|Darboux basis]] {'''e'''<sub>''j''</sub>,'''f'''<sup>''k''</sup>}<sub>1 ≤ ''j'',''k'' ≤ ''n''</sub> satisfying ω('''e'''<sub>''j''</sub>,'''f'''<sup>''k''</sup>) = δ<sub>''j''</sub><sup>''k''</sup> and where 2''n'' is the dimension of ''V'' (the dimension of ''V'' is necessarily even).  In terms of this basis, every vector decomposes as\n\n:<math>v=q^a\\mathbf{e}_a+p_a\\mathbf{f}^a.</math>\n\nThe ''q''<sup>''a''</sup> and ''p''<sub>''a''</sub> are [[canonically conjugate coordinates]].\n\nIf {'''e'''<sub>''j''</sub>, '''f'''<sup>''k''</sup>}<sub>1 ≤ ''j'',''k'' ≤ ''n''</sub> is a Darboux basis for ''V'', then let {''E''} be a basis for '''R''', and {'''e'''<sub>''j''</sub>, '''f'''<sup>''k''</sup>, ''E''}<sub>1 ≤ ''j'',''k'' ≤ ''n''</sub> is the corresponding basis for ''V''×'''R'''.  A vector in H(''V'') is then given by\n\n:<math>v=q^a\\mathbf{e}_a+p_a\\mathbf{f}^a+tE</math>\n\nand the group law becomes\n\n:<math>(p,q,t)\\cdot(p',q',t') =\\left (p+p',q+q',t+t'+\\frac{1}{2}(p q'-p' q)\\right).</math>\n\nBecause the underlying manifold of the Heisenberg group is a linear space, vectors in the Lie algebra can be canonically identified with vectors in the group.  The Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group is given by the commutation relation\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix} (v_1,t_1),(v_2,t_2) \\end{bmatrix} =\\omega(v_1,v_2)</math>\n\nor written in terms of the Darboux basis\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{e}_a,\\mathbf{f}^b]=\\delta_a^b</math>\n\nand all other commutators vanish.\n\nIt is also possible to define the group law in a different way but which yields a group isomorphic to the group we have just defined. To avoid confusion, we will use ''u'' instead of ''t'', so a vector is given by\n\n:<math>v=q^a\\mathbf{e}_a+p_a\\mathbf{f}^a+uE</math>\n\nand the group law is\n\n:<math>(p,q,u)\\cdot(p',q',u')=(p+p',q+q',u+u'+p q').</math>\n\nAn element of the group \n:<math>v=q^a\\mathbf{e}_a+p_a\\mathbf{f}^a+uE</math> \ncan then be expressed as a matrix\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & p   & u\\\\\n0 & I_n & q\\\\\n0 & 0   & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math> ,\nwhich gives a faithful [[matrix representation]] of H(''V''). The ''u'' in this formulation is related to ''t'' in our previous formulation by <math>u=t+\\tfrac{1}{2}pq</math>, so that the ''t'' value for the product comes to\n\n:<math>u+u'+p q'-\\tfrac{1}{2}(p+p')(q+q')</math>\n:<math>=t+\\tfrac{1}{2}p q+t'+\\tfrac{1}{2}p' q'+p q'-\\tfrac{1}{2}(p+p')(q+q')</math>\n:<math>=t+t'+\\tfrac{1}{2}(p q'-p' q)</math> ,\nas before.\n\nThe isomorphism to the group using upper triangular matrices relies on the decomposition of ''V'' into a Darboux basis, which amounts to a choice of isomorphism ''V'' ≅ ''U'' ⊕ ''U''*. Although the new group law yields a group isomorphic to the one given higher up, the group with this law is sometimes referred to as the '''polarized Heisenberg group''' as a reminder that this group law relies on a choice of basis (a choice of a Lagrangian subspace of ''V'' is a [[polarization (abelian variety)|polarization]]).\n\nTo any Lie algebra, there is a unique [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected]] Lie group ''G''.  All other connected Lie groups with the same Lie algebra as ''G'' are of the form ''G''/''N'' where ''N'' is a central discrete group in ''G''.  In this case, the center of H(''V'') is '''R''' and the only discrete subgroups are isomorphic to ''Z''.  Thus H(''V'')/'''Z''' is another Lie group which shares this Lie algebra.  Of note about this Lie group is that it admits no faithful finite-dimensional representations; it is not isomorphic to any matrix group.  It does however have a well-known family of infinite-dimensional unitary representations.\n\n==The connection with the Weyl algebra==\n{{main|Weyl algebra}}\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}_n</math> of the Heisenberg group was described above, (1), as a Lie algebra of matrices. The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] applies to determine the [[universal enveloping algebra]] <math>U(\\mathfrak{h}_n)</math>. Among other properties, the universal enveloping algebra is an [[associative algebra]] into which <math>\\mathfrak{h}_n</math> injectively imbeds.\n\nBy the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem, it is thus the [[free module|free vector space]] generated by the monomials\n:<math> z^j p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_n^{k_n} q_1^{\\ell_1} q_2^{\\ell_2} \\cdots q_n^{\\ell_n} ~,</math>\nwhere the exponents are all non-negative.\n\nConsequently, <math>U(\\mathfrak{h}_n)</math> consists of real polynomials \n:<math> \\sum_{j, \\vec{k}, \\vec{\\ell}} c_{j \\vec{k} \\vec{\\ell}} \\,\\, z^j  p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_n^{k_n} q_1^{\\ell_1} q_2^{\\ell_2} \\cdots q_n^{\\ell_n}   ~,</math>\nwith the commutation relations\n:<math> p_k p_\\ell = p_\\ell p_k, \\quad q_k q_\\ell = q_\\ell q_k, \\quad p_k q_\\ell - q_\\ell p_k = \\delta_{k \\ell} z, \\quad z p_k - p_k z =0, \\quad z q_k - q_k z =0~.</math>\n\nThe algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{h}_n)</math> is closely related to the algebra of differential operators on ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> with polynomial coefficients, since any such operator has a unique representation in the form\n:<math>P=\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\vec{\\ell}} c_{\\vec{k} \\vec{\\ell}} \\,\\, \\partial_{x_1}^{k_1} \\partial_{x_2}^{k_2} \\cdots \\partial_{x_n}^{k_n} x_1^{\\ell_1} x_2^{\\ell_2} \\cdots x_n^{\\ell_n}  ~.</math>\n\nThis algebra is called the [[Weyl algebra]]. It follows from [[abstract nonsense]] that the [[Weyl algebra]] ''W<sub>n</sub>'' is a quotient of <math>U(\\mathfrak{h}_n)</math>.  However, this is also easy to see directly from the above representations; [[viz.]] by the mapping\n:<math> z^j p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_n^{k_n} q_1^{\\ell_1} q_2^{\\ell_2} \\cdots q_n^{\\ell_n} \\, \\mapsto \\, \\partial_{x_1}^{k_1} \\partial_{x_2}^{k_2} \\cdots \\partial_{x_n}^{k_n} x_1^{\\ell_1} x_2^{\\ell_2} \\cdots x_n^{\\ell_n}~.</math>\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Weyl's parameterization of quantum mechanics ===\n{{main|Wigner–Weyl transform}}\nThe application that led [[Hermann Weyl]] to an explicit realization of the Heisenberg group was the question of why the [[Schrödinger picture]] and [[Heisenberg picture]] are physically equivalent. Abstractly, the reason is the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]]: there is a unique [[unitary representation]] with given action of the central Lie algebra element ''z'',  up to a unitary equivalence: the nontrivial elements of the algebra are all equivalent to the usual position and momentum operators.\n\nThus, the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture are equivalent – they are just different ways of realizing this essentially unique representation.\n\n=== Theta representation ===\n{{main|theta representation}}\nThe same uniqueness result was used by [[David Mumford]] for discrete Heisenberg groups, in his theory of [[equations defining abelian varieties]]. This is a large generalization of the approach used in [[Jacobi's elliptic functions]], which is the case of the modulo 2 Heisenberg group, of order 8. The simplest case is the [[theta representation]] of the Heisenberg group, of which the discrete case gives the [[theta function]].\n\n=== Fourier analysis ===\nThe Heisenberg group also occurs in [[Fourier analysis]], where it is used in some formulations of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]]. In this case, the Heisenberg group can be understood to act on the space of [[square integrable]] functions; the result is a representation of the Heisenberg groups sometimes called the Weyl representation.\n\n==As a sub-Riemannian manifold==\nThe three-dimensional Heisenberg group ''H''<sub>3</sub>('''R''') on the reals can also be understood to be a smooth [[manifold]], and specifically, a simple example of a [[sub-Riemannian manifold]].<ref>Richard Montgomery, ''A Tour of Subriemannian Geometries, Their Geodesics and Applications (Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, Volume 91)'', (2002) American Mathematical Society, {{ISBN|0-8218-1391-9}}.</ref> Given a point ''p''=(''x'',''y'',''z'') in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, define a differential [[1-form]] Θ at this point as\n\n:<math>\\Theta_p=dz -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(xdy - ydx\\right).</math>\n\nThis [[one-form]] belongs to the [[cotangent bundle]] of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>; that is,\n\n:<math>\\Theta_p:T_p\\mathbf{R}^3\\to\\mathbf{R}</math>\n\nis a map on the [[tangent bundle]].  Let\n\n:<math>H_p = \\{ v\\in T_p\\mathbf{R}^3 \\mid \\Theta_p(v) = 0 \\}.</math>\n\nIt can be seen that ''H'' is a [[subbundle]] of the tangent bundle T'''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  A [[cometric]] on ''H'' is given by projecting vectors to the two-dimensional space spanned by vectors in the ''x'' and ''y'' direction.  That is, given vectors <math>v=(v_1,v_2,v_3)</math> and <math>w=(w_1,w_2,w_3)</math> in T'''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the inner product is given by\n\n:<math>\\langle v,w\\rangle = v_1w_1+v_2w_2.</math>\n\nThe resulting structure turns ''H'' into the manifold of the Heisenberg group. An orthonormal frame on the manifold is given by the Lie [[vector field]]s\n\n:<math>X=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - \\frac{1}{2} y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z},</math>\n:<math>Y=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\frac{1}{2} x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z},</math>\n:<math>Z=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z},</math>\n\nwhich obey the relations [''X'',''Y'']=''Z'' and [''X'',''Z'']=[''Y'',''Z'']=0. Being Lie vector fields, these form a left-invariant basis for the group action.  The [[geodesic]]s on the manifold are spirals, projecting down to circles in two dimensions. That is, if\n\n:<math>\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))</math>\n\nis a geodesic curve, then the curve <math>c(t)=(x(t),y(t))</math> is an arc of a circle, and\n\n:<math>z(t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_c xdy-ydx</math>\n\nwith the integral limited to the two-dimensional plane. That is, the height of the curve is proportional to the area of the circle subtended by the [[circular arc]], which follows by [[Stokes' theorem]].\n\n==Heisenberg group of a locally compact abelian group==\nIt is more generally possible to define the Heisenberg group of a [[locally compact abelian group]] ''K'', equipped with a [[Haar measure]].<ref>{{citation|author=[[David Mumford]]|title=Tata lectures on theta III|journal=Progress in Mathematics|volume=97|publisher=Birkhauser|year=1991}}</ref>  Such a group has a [[Pontrjagin dual]] <math>\\hat{K}</math>, consisting of all continuous <math>U(1)</math>-valued characters on ''K'', which is also a locally compact abelian group if endowed with the [[compact-open topology]].  The Heisenberg group associated with the locally compact abelian group ''K'' is the subgroup of the unitary group of <math>L^2(K)</math> generated by translations from ''K'' and multiplications by elements of <math>\\hat{K}</math>.\n\nIn more detail, the [[Hilbert space]] <math>L^2(K)</math> consists of square-integrable complex-valued functions <math>f</math> on ''K''.  The translations in ''K'' form a [[unitary representation]] of ''K'' as operators on <math>L^2(K)</math>:\n:<math>(T_xf)(y) = f(x+y)</math>\nfor <math>x,y\\in K</math>.  So too do the multiplications by characters:\n:<math>(M_\\chi f)(y) = \\chi(y)f(y)</math>\nfor <math>\\chi\\in\\hat{K}</math>.  These operators do not commute, and instead satisfy\n:<math>(T_xM_\\chi T^{-1}_x M_\\chi^{-1}f)(y) = \\overline{\\chi(x)}f(y)</math>\nmultiplication by a fixed unit modulus complex number.\n\nSo the Heisenberg group <math>H(K)</math> associated with ''K'' is a type of [[Central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of <math>K\\times\\hat{K}</math>, via an exact sequence of groups:\n:<math>1\\to U(1) \\to H(K) \\to K\\times\\hat{K}\\to 0.</math>\nMore general Heisenberg groups are described by 2-cocyles in the [[group cohomology|cohomology group]] <math>H^2(K,U(1))</math>.  The existence of a duality between <math>K</math> and <math>\\hat{K}</math> gives rise to a canonical cocycle, but there are generally others.\n\nThe Heisenberg group acts irreducibly on <math>L^2(K)</math>.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Manifold with inversion symmetry}}\n{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' is a [[Hermitian manifold]] which at every point has as an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by [[Élie Cartan]], they form a natural generalization of the notion of [[Riemannian symmetric space]] from [[real manifold]]s to [[complex manifold]]s.\n\nEvery Hermitian symmetric space is a homogeneous space for its isometry group and has a unique decomposition as a product of irreducible spaces and a Euclidean space. The irreducible spaces arise in pairs as a non-compact space that, as [[Armand Borel|Borel]] showed, can be embedded as an open subspace of its compact dual space. [[Harish Chandra]] showed that each non-compact space can be realized as a '''bounded symmetric domain''' in a complex vector space. The simplest case involves the groups SU(2), SU(1,1) and their common complexification SL(2,'''C'''). In this case the non-compact space is the [[unit disk]], a homogeneous space for SU(1,1). It is a bounded domain in the complex plane '''C'''. The one-point compactification of '''C''', the [[Riemann sphere]], is the dual space, a homogeneous space for SU(2) and SL(2,'''C''').\n\nIrreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the homogeneous spaces of simple compact Lie groups by maximal closed connected subgroups which contain a maximal torus and have center isomorphic to '''T'''.  There is a complete classification of irreducible spaces, with four classical series, studied by Cartan, and two exceptional cases; the classification can be deduced from [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]], which classifies closed connected subgroups containing a maximal torus. Hermitian symmetric spaces appear in the theory of [[Jordan triple system]]s, [[several complex variables]], [[complex geometry]], [[automorphic form]]s and [[group representation]]s, in particular permitting the construction of the [[holomorphic discrete series representation]]s of semisimple Lie groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|1972}}</ref>\n\n==Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==\n\n===Definition===\nLet ''H'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of ''H'' of order 2 and ''H''<sup>σ</sup> the fixed point subgroup of σ.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''H'' lying between ''H''<sup>σ</sup> and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> admits a decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus\\mathfrak{m},}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of σ and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> the –1 eigenspace. If <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> contains no simple summand of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, σ) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\">{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nAny inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on ''H'' / ''K'', with ''H'' acting by isometries. A canonical example is given by minus the [[Killing form]]. Under such an inner product, <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> are orthogonal. ''H'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n</ref>\n\nThe symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' if it has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric. This is equivalent to the existence of a linear map ''J'' with ''J''<sup>2</sup> = −''I'' on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''.\n\n===Symmetry and center of isotropy subgroup===\nIf (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>,σ) is Hermitian, ''K'' has non-trivial center and the symmetry σ is inner, implemented by an element of the center of ''K''.\n\nIn fact ''J'' lies in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and exp ''tJ'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>, then by the invariance of the inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math><ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149–150}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}</math>\n\nReplacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}</math>\n\nDefine a linear map δ on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. Since <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}</math>\n\nwith ''T'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and ''A'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. Taking ''X'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple. The symmetry σ is implemented by ''z'' = exp π''T'' and the almost complex structure by exp π/2 ''T''.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261–262}}</ref>\n\nThe innerness of σ implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''H'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''H''.<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\" />\n\n===Irreducible decomposition===\nThe symmetric space or the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, σ) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> (or equivalently the identity component of ''H''<sup>σ</sup> or  ''K'') is irreducible on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. This is equivalent to the maximality of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> as a subalgebra.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}</ref>\n\nIn fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras <math>\\mathfrak{l}</math> and ''K''-invariant subspaces \n<math>\\mathfrak{m}_1</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{l}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus \\mathfrak{m}_1,\\,\\,\\,\\ \\mathfrak{m}_1=\\mathfrak{l}\\cap \\mathfrak{m}.}</math>\n\nAny orthogonal symmetric algebra  (<math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, σ) of Hermitian type can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras of Hermitian type.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378–379}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nIn fact <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\oplus_{i=1}^N \\mathfrak{h}_i,}</math>\n\neach of which is left invariant by the automorphism σ and the complex structure ''J'', since they are both inner. The eigenspace decomposition of <math>\\mathfrak{h}_1</math> coincides with its intersections with <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. So the restriction of σ to <math>\\mathfrak{h}_1</math> is irreducible.\n\nThis decomposition of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' when ''H'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''H''<sup>σ</sup> is automatically connected. For simply connected ''H'', the symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is the direct product of ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> simply connected and simple. In the irreducible case, ''K'' is a maximal connected subgroup of ''H''. Since ''K'' acts irreducibly on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> (regarded as a complex space for the complex structure defined by ''J''), the center of ''K'' is a one-dimensional torus '''T''', given by the operators exp ''tT''. Since each ''H'' is simply connected and ''K'' connected, the quotient ''H''/''K'' is simply connected.<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\n===Complex structure===\n{{Main article|Complex structures on homogeneous spaces}}\nif ''H'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''H'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From [[Borel-de Siebenthal theory]], the involution σ is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of its center, which is isomorphic to '''T'''. In particular ''K'' is connected. It follows that ''H'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''H'' / ''K'' and the action of ''H'' is holomorphic. Since any Hermitian symmetric space is a product of irreducible spaces, the same is true in general.\n\nAt the [[Lie algebra]] level, there is a symmetric decomposition\n:<math>\\mathfrak h = \\mathfrak k\\oplus\\mathfrak m,</math>\nwhere <math>(\\mathfrak m,J)</math> is a real vector space with a complex structure ''J'', whose complex dimension is given in the table. Correspondingly, there is a [[graded Lie algebra]] decomposition\n:<math>\\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak{m}_{+}\\oplus\\mathfrak l\\oplus\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak m\\otimes\\mathbb C= \\mathfrak m_{-}\\oplus\\mathfrak m_{+}</math> is the decomposition into +''i'' and &minus;''i'' eigenspaces of ''J'' and <math>\\mathfrak l=\\mathfrak k\\otimes\\mathbb C</math>. The Lie algebra of ''P'' is the semidirect product <math>\\mathfrak m^{+}\\oplus\\mathfrak l</math>. The complex Lie algebras  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> are Abelian. Indeed, if ''U'' and ''V'' lie in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math>, [''U'',''V''] = ''J''[''U'',''V''] = [''JU'',''JV''] = [±''iU'',±''iV''] = –[''U'',''V''], so the Lie bracket must vanish.\n\nThe complex subspaces <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb C}</math> are irreducible for the action of ''K'', since ''J'' commutes with ''K'' so that each is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> with complex structure ±''J''.  Equivalently the centre '''T''' of ''K'' acts on <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> by the identity representation and on <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> by its conjugate.<ref>{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}</ref>\n\nThe realization of ''H''/''K'' as a generalized flag variety ''G''/''P'' is obtained by taking ''G'' as in the table (the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H'') and ''P'' to be the [[parabolic subgroup]] equal to the semidirect product of ''L'', the complexification of ''K'', with the complex Abelian subgroup exp <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math>. (In the language of [[algebraic groups]],  ''L'' is the [[Levi factor]] of ''P''.)\n\n===Classification===\nAny Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> simple, ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> connected of maximal rank with center '''T'''. The irreducible ones are therefore exactly the non-semisimple cases classified by [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]].<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\" />\n \nAccordingly, the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' are classified as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The corresponding symmetry σ of the simply connected simple compact Lie group is inner, given by conjugation by the unique element ''S'' in ''Z''(''K'') / ''Z''(''H'') of period 2. For the classical groups, as in the table above, these symmetries are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=444–447,451–455}}</ref>\n\n*AIII: <math>S=\\begin{pmatrix}-\\alpha I_p & 0\\\\ 0 & \\alpha I_q\\end{pmatrix}</math> in S(U(''p'')×U(''q'')), where α<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>=(−1)<sup>''p''</sup>.\n*DIII: ''S'' = ''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ SO(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to <math>J_n=\\begin{pmatrix}0 &I_n \\\\ -I_n & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.\n*CI: ''S''=''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ Sp(''n'') = Sp(''n'','''C''') ∩ U(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to ''J''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n*BDI: <math>S=\\begin{pmatrix}I_p & 0\\\\ 0 & -I_2\\end{pmatrix}</math> in SO(''p'')×SO(2).\n\nThe maximal parabolic subgroup ''P'' can be described explicitly in these classical cases. For AIII\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{P(p,q)= \\begin{pmatrix}A_{pp} & B_{pq}\\\\ 0 & D_{qq}\\end{pmatrix}}</math>\n\nin SL(''p''+''q'','''C'''). ''P''(''p'',''q'') is the stabilizer of a subspace of dimension ''p'' in '''C'''<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>.\n\nThe other groups arise as fixed points of involutions. Let ''J'' be the ''n'' × ''n'' matrix with 1's on the antidiagonal and 0's elsewhere and set\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & J\\\\ -J & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThen Sp(''n'','''C''') is the fixed point subgroup of the involution θ(''g'') = ''A'' (''g''<sup>''t''</sup>)<sup>−1</sup> ''A''<sup>−1</sup> of SL(2''n'','''C'''). SO(''n'','''C''') can be realised as the fixed points of ψ(''g'') = ''B'' (''g''<sup>''t''</sup>)<sup>−1</sup> ''B''<sup>−1</sup> in SL(''n'','''C''') where ''B'' = ''J''. These involutions leave invariant ''P''(''n'',''n'') in the cases DIII and CI and ''P''(''p'',2) in the case BDI. The corresponding parabolic subgroups ''P'' are obtained by taking the fixed points. The compact group ''H'' acts transitively on ''G'' / ''P'', so that ''G'' / ''P'' = ''H'' / ''K''.\n\n==Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type==\n\n===Definition===\nAs with symmetric spaces in general, each compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' has a noncompact dual ''H''<sup>*</sup>/''K'' obtained by replacing ''H'' with the closed real Lie subgroup ''H''<sup>*</sup> of the complex Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra\n:<math>\\mathfrak h^* = \\mathfrak k \\oplus i\\mathfrak m\\subset\\mathfrak g.</math>\n\n===Borel embedding===\nWhereas the natural map from ''H''/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is an isomorphism, the natural map from ''H''<sup>*</sup>/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is only an inclusion onto an open subset. This inclusion is called the '''Borel embedding''' after [[Armand Borel]]. In fact ''P'' ∩ ''H'' = ''K'' = ''P'' ∩ ''H''*. The images of ''H'' and ''H''* have the same dimension so are open. Since the image of ''H'' is compact, so closed, it follows that ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\n===Cartan decomposition===\nThe polar decomposition in the complex linear group ''G'' implies the Cartan decomposition ''H''* = ''K'' ⋅ exp <math>i\\mathfrak{m}</math> in ''H''*.<ref>{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> in t, ''A'' = exp  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is a toral subgroup such that σ(''a'') = ''a''<sup>−1</sup> on ''A''; and any two such <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''. A similar statement holds for <math>\\mathfrak{a}^*=i\\mathfrak{a}</math>. Morevoer if ''A''* = exp <math>\\mathfrak{a}^*</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{H^*=KA^*K.}</math>\n\nThese results are special cases of the Cartan decomposition in any Riemannian symmetric space and its dual. The geodesics emanating from the origin in the homogeneous spaces can be identified with one parameter groups with generators in  <math>i\\mathfrak{m}</math> or <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. Similar results hold for in the compact case: ''H''= ''K'' ⋅ exp <math>i\\mathfrak{m}</math> and ''H'' = ''KAK''.<ref>{{harvnb||Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\nThe properties of the [[totally geodesic]] subspace ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(''a'') = ''a''<sup>−1</sup>, so its Lie algebra lies in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> and hence equals <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is the centralizer of ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. Thus <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> is the union of the conjugates of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. In particular some conjugate of ''X'' lies in any other choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>.\n<ref>{{harvnb||Helgason|1978|p=248}}</ref>\n\nThe decompositions\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{H=KAK,\\,\\,\\,H = K\\cdot \\exp \\mathfrak{m}}</math>\n\ncan be proved directly by applying the [[slice theorem (differential geometry)|slice theorem]] for [[transformation group|compact transformation groups]] to the action of ''K'' on ''H'' / ''K''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}\n*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=35–36}}\n*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=8–9}}</ref> In fact the space ''H'' / ''K'' can be identified with\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{M=\\{ \\sigma(g)g^{-1}:g\\in H\\},}</math>\n\na closed submanifold of ''H'', and the Cartan decomposition follows by showing that ''M'' is the union of the ''kAk''<sup>−1</sup> for ''k'' in ''K''. Since this union is the continuous image of ''K'' × ''A'', it is compact and connected. So it suffices to show that the union is open in ''M'' and for this it is enough to show each ''a'' in ''A'' has an open neighbourhood in this union. Now by computing derivatives at 0, the union contains an open neighbourhood of 1. If ''a'' is central the union is invariant under multiplication by ''a'', so contains an open neighbourhood of ''a''. If ''a'' is not central, write ''a'' = ''b''<sup>2</sup> with ''b'' in ''A''. Then τ = Ad ''b'' −  Ad ''b''<sup>−1</sup> is a skew-adjoint operator on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> anticommuting with σ, which can be regarded as a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading operator σ on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. By an [[Euler–Poincaré characteristic]] argument it follows that the superdimension of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> coincides with the superdimension of the kernel of τ. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{k} - \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{k}_a = \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{m} - \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{m}_a,}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_a</math> are the subspaces fixed by Ad ''a''. Let the orthogonal complement of  <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a</math> in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> be <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a^\\perp</math>.

Here the terms ''a'' ''e''<sup>''Y''</sup> lie in the union by the argument for central ''a'': indeed ''a'' is in the center of the identity component of the centralizer of ''a'' which is invariant under σ and contains ''A''.\n\nThe dimension of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is called the '''rank''' of the Hermitian symmetric space.\n\n===Strongly orthogonal roots===\nIn the case of Hermitian symmetric spaces, Harish-Chandra gave a canonical choice for <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. \nThis choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is determined by taking a maximal torus ''T'' of ''H'' in ''K'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>. Since the symmetry σ is implemented by an element of ''T'' lying in the centre of ''H'', the root spaces <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> in  <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are left invariant by σ. It acts as the identity on those contained in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> and minus the identity on those in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math>.\n\nThe roots with root spaces in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> \nare called '''compact roots''' and those with root spaces in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> are called '''noncompact roots'''. (This terminology originates from the symmetric space of noncompact type.)   If ''H'' is simple, the generator ''Z'' of the centre of ''K'' can be used to define a set of positive roots, according to the sign of α(''Z''). With this choice of roots  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> are the direct sum of the root spaces <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> over positive and negative noncompact roots α. Root vectors ''E''<sub>α</sub> can be chosen so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{X_\\alpha=E_\\alpha + E_{-\\alpha}, \\,\\,\\, Y_\\alpha=i(E_\\alpha - E_{-\\alpha})}</math>\n\nlie in <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. The simple roots α<sub>1</sub>, ...., α<sub>''n''</sub> are the indecomposable positive roots. These can be numbered so that  α<sub>''i''</sub> vanishes on the center of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> for ''i'', whereas α<sub>1</sub> does not. Thus α<sub>1</sub> is the unique noncompact simple root and the other simple roots are compact. Any positive noncompact root then has the form β = α<sub>1</sub> + ''c''<sub>2</sub> α<sub>2</sub> + ⋅⋅⋅ +  ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> α<sub>''n''</sub> with non-negative coefficients ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>. These corfficients lead to a [[lexicographic order]] on positive roots. The coefficient of α<sub>1</sub> is always one because <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> is irreducible for ''K'' so is spanned by vectors obtained by successively applying the lowering operators ''E''<sub>–α</sub> for simple compact roots α.\n\nTwo roots α and β are said to be '''strongly orthogonal''' if  ±α ±β are not roots or zero, written  α ≐ β. The highest positive root ψ<sub>1</sub> is noncompact. Take ψ<sub>2</sub> to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ<sub>1</sub> (for the lexicographic order). Then continue in this way taking ψ<sub>''i'' + 1</sub> to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ<sub>1</sub>, ..., ψ<sub>''i''</sub> until the process terminates. The corresponding vectors\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{X_i= E_{\\psi_i} + E_{-\\psi_i}}</math>\n\nlie in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> and commute by strong orthogonality. Their span <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is Harish-Chandra's canonical maximal Abelian subalgebra.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=375–387}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}</ref> (As Sugiura later showed, having fixed ''T'', the set of strongly orthogonal roots is uniquely determined up to applying an element in the Weyl group of ''K''.<ref>{{harvnb|Agaoka|Kaneda|2002}}</ref>)\n\nMaximality can be checked by showing that if\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[\\sum c_\\alpha E_\\alpha + \\overline{c_\\alpha}E_{-\\alpha}, E_{\\psi_i} + E_{-\\psi_i}]=0}</math>\n\nfor all ''i'', then ''c''<sub>α</sub> = 0 for all positive noncompact roots α  different from the ψ<sub>''j''</sub>'s. This follows by showing inductively that if ''c''<sub>α</sub> ≠ 0, then α is strongly orthogonal to ψ<sub>1</sub>, ψ<sub>2</sub>, ... a contradiction. Indeed, the above relation shows ψ<sub>''i''</sub> + α cannot be a root; and that if ψ<sub>''i''</sub> – α is a root, then it would necessarily have the form β – ψ<sub>''i''</sub>. If ψ<sub>''i''</sub> – α were negative, then α would be a higher positive root than  ψ<sub>''i''</sub>, strongly orthogonal to the ψ<sub>''j''</sub> with ''j'' < ''i'', which is not possible; similarly if  β – ψ<sub>''i''</sub> were positive.\n\n===Polysphere and polydisk theorem===\nHarish-Chandra's canonical choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> leads to a polydisk and polysphere theorem in ''H''*/''K'' and ''H''/''K''. This result reduces the geometry to products of the prototypic example  involving SL(2,'''C'''), SU(1,1) and SU(2), namely the unit disk inside the Riemann sphere.\n\nIn the case of ''H'' = SU(2) the symmetry σ is given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries ±''i'' so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\sigma\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta\\\\ -\\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta\\\\ \\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix}}</math>\n\nThe fixed point subgroup is the maximal torus ''T'', the diagonal matrices with entries ''e''<sup> ±''it''</sup>. SU(2) acts on the Riemann sphere <math>\\mathbf{CP}^1</math> transitively by Möbius transformations and ''T'' is the stabilizer of 0. SL(2,'''C'''), the complexification of SU(2), also acts by Möbius transformations and the stabiliser of 0 is the subgroup ''B'' of lower triangular matrices. The noncompact subgroup SU(1,1) acts with precisely three orbits: the open unit disk |''z''| < 1; the unit circle ''z'' = 1; and its exterior |''z''| > 1. Thus\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{SU}(1,1)/\\mathbf{T} = \\{z: |z|<1\\} \\,\\,\\, \\subset \\,\\,\\, B_+/\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbb{C}} = \\mathbb{C}\\,\\,\\, \\subset \\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})/B = \\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},}</math>\n\nwhere ''B''<sub>+</sub>  and ''T''<sub>'''C'''</sub> denote the subgroups of upper triangular and diagonal matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The middle term is the orbit of 0 under the upper unitriangular matrices\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & z\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} =\\exp \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & z\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nNow for each root ψ<sub>''i''</sub> there is a homomorphism of π<sub>''i''</sub> of SU(2) into ''H'' which is compatible with the symmetries. It extends uniquely to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''') into ''G''. The images of the Lie algebras for different ψ<sub>''i''</sub>'s commute since they are strongly orthogonal. Thus there is a homomorphism π of the direct product SU(2)<sup>''r''</sup> into ''H'' compatible with the symmetries. It extends to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''')<sup>''r''</sup> into ''G''. The kernel of π is contained in the center (±1)<sup>''r''</sup> of SU(2)<sup>''r''</sup> which is fixed pointwise by the symmetry. So the image of the center under π lies in ''K''. Thus there is an embedding of the polysphere (SU(2)/T)<sup>''r''</sup> into ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P'' and the polysphere contains the polydisk (SU(1,1)/T)<sup>''r''</sup>. The polysphere and polydisk are the direct product of ''r'' copies of the Riemann sphere and the unit disk. By the Cartan decompositions in SU(2) and SU(1,1), \nthe polysphere is the orbit of ''T''<sub>r</sub>''A'' in ''H'' / ''K'' and the polydisk is the orbit of ''T''<sub>''r''</sub>''A''*, where ''T''<sub>''r''</sub> = π('''T'''<sup>''r''</sup>) ⊆ ''K''. On the other hand, ''H'' = ''KAK'' and ''H''* = ''K'' ''A''* ''K''.\n\nHence every element in the compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polysphere; and every element in the image  under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''* / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polydisk.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n&{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}</ref>\n\n===Harish-Chandra embedding===\n''H''* / ''K'', the  Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, lies in the image of <math>\\exp \\mathfrak m_+</math>, a dense open subset of ''H'' / ''K'' biholomorphic to  <math>\\mathfrak m_+</math>. The corresponding domain in <math>\\mathfrak m_+</math> is bounded. This is the '''Harish-Chandra embedding''' named after [[Harish-Chandra]]. \n \nIn fact Harish-Chandra showed the following properties of the space <math>\\mathbf{X}=\\exp (\\mathfrak{m}_+)\\cdot K_{\\mathbb{C}} \\cdot \\exp(\\mathfrak{m}_-)=\\exp (\\mathfrak{m}_+)\\cdot P</math>:\n\n# As a space, '''X''' is the direct product of the three factors.\n# '''X''' is open in ''G''.\n# '''X''' is dense in ''G''.\n# '''X''' contains ''H''*.\n# The closure of ''H''* / ''K'' in '''X''' / ''P'' = <math>\\exp \\mathfrak{m}_+ </math> is compact.\n\nIn fact <math>M_\\pm=\\exp \\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> are complex Abelian groups normalised by ''K''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. Moreover, <math>[\\mathfrak{m}_+,\\mathfrak{m}_-] \\subset \\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathfrak{C}}</math> since <math>[\\mathfrak{m},\\mathfrak{m}] \\subset \\mathfrak{k}</math>.\n\nThis implies ''P'' ∩ ''M''<sub>+</sub> = {1}. For if ''x'' = ''e''<sup>''X''</sup> with ''X'' in \n<math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> lies in ''P'', it must normalize ''M''<sub>−</sub> and hence <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>. But if ''Y'' lies in  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Y=\\mathrm{Ad}(X)\\cdot Y= Y + [X,Y] + {1\\over 2} [X,[X,Y]]\\in \\mathfrak{m}_+ \\oplus \\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m}_-,}</math>\n\nso that ''X'' commutes with <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>. But if ''X'' commutes with every noncompact root space, it must be 0, so ''x'' = 1. It follows that the multiplication map μ on ''M''<sub>+</sub> × ''P'' is injective so (1) follows. Similarly the derivative of μ at (''x'',''p'') is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mu^\\prime(X,Y)=\\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})X + Y =\\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})(X\\oplus\\mathrm{Ad}(p)Y),}</math>\n\nwhich is injective, so (2) follows. For the special case ''H'' = SU(2), ''H''* = SU(1,1) and ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') the remaining assertions are consequences of the identification with the Riemann sphere, '''C''' and unit disk. They can be applied to the groups defined for each root ψ<sub>''i''</sub>. By the polysphere and polydisk theorem ''H''*/''K'', '''X'''/''P'' and ''H''/''K'' are the union of the ''K''-translates of the polydisk, '''C'''<sup>''r''</sup> and the polysphere. So ''H''* lies in '''X''', the closure of ''H''*/''K'' is compact in '''X'''/''P'', which is in turn dense in ''H''/''K''.\n\nNote that (2) and (3) are also consequences of the fact that the image of ''X'' in ''G''/''P'' is that of the big cell ''B''<sub>+</sub>''B'' in the [[Complexification (Lie group)#Gauss decomposition|Gauss decomposition]] of ''G''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=382–396}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|p=281}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}\n</ref>\n\nUsing results on the [[restricted root system]] of the symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' and ''H''*/''K'', \n[[Robert Hermann (mathematician)|Hermann]] showed that the image of ''H''*/''K'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> is a generalized unit disk. In fact it is the [[convex set]] of ''X'' for which the [[operator norm]] of ad Im ''X'' is less than one.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=284–286}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|p=98}}</ref>\n\n===Bounded symmetric domains===\nA bounded domain ''&Omega;'' in a complex vector space is said to be a '''bounded symmetric domain''' if for every ''x'' in ''&Omega;'', there is an involutive biholomorphism ''&sigma;''<sub>''x''</sub> of ''&Omega;'' for which ''x'' is an isolated fixed point. The Harish-Chandra embedding exhibits every Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type ''H''* / ''K'' as a bounded symmetric domain. The biholomorphism group of ''H''<sup>*</sup> / ''K'' is equal to its isometry group ''H''<sup>*</sup>.\n\nConversely every bounded symmetric domain arises in this way. Indeed, given a bounded symmetric domain ''&Omega;'', the [[Bergman kernel]] defines a [[Riemannian metric|metric]] on ''&Omega;'', the [[Bergman metric]], for which every biholomorphism is an isometry.

In fact this follows from the [[polar decomposition]] for ''p'' × ''p'' matrices.\n* '''Type III'''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub>: for every complex symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix ''U'' such that ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is diagonal. This is proved by a classical argument of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]]. Take ''V'' unitary so that ''V''*''M''*''MV'' is diagonal. Then ''V''<sup>''t''</sup>''MV'' is symmetric and its real and imaginary parts commute. Since they are real symmetric matrices they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a real orthogonal matrix ''W''. So ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is diagonal if ''U'' = ''WV''<sup>''t''</sup>.\n* '''Type II'''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub>: for every complex skew symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix such that ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is made up of diagonal blocks <math>\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a\\\\ -a & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math> and one zero if ''n'' is odd. As in Siegel's artgument, this can be reduced to case where the real and imaginary parts of ''M'' commute. Any real skew-symmetric matrix can be reduced to the given [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Spectral theory|canonical form]] by an orthogonal matrix and this can be done simultaneously for commuting matrices.\n* '''Type IV'''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub>: by a transformation in SO(''n'') × SO(2) any vector can be transformed so that all but the first two coordinates are non-zero.\n\n===Boundary components===\nThe noncompact group ''H''* acts on the complex Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P'' with only finitely many orbits. The orbit structure is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Wolf|1972}}. In particular the closure of the bounded domain ''H''*/''K'' has a unique closed orbit, which is the [[Shilov boundary]] of the domain. In general the orbits are unions of Hermitian symmetric spaces of lower dimension. The complex function theory of the domains, in particular the analogue of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]s, are described for the Cartan domains in {{harvtxt|Hua|1979}}. The closure of the bounded domain is the [[Baily–Borel compactification]] of ''H''*/''K''.<ref>{{harvnb|Borel|Ji|2006|pp=77–91}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary structure can be described using [[Cayley transform]]s. For each copy of SU(2) defined by one of the noncompact roots ψ<sub>''i''</sub>, there is a Cayley transform ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> which as a Möbius transformation maps the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Given a subset ''I'' of indices of the strongly orthogonal family ψ<sub>1</sub>, ..., ψ<sub>''r''</sub>, the ''partial Cayley transform'' ''c''<sub>''I''</sub> is defined as the product of the ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>'s with ''i'' in ''I'' in the product of the groups π<sub>''i''</sub>. Let ''G''(''I'') be the centralizer of this product in ''G'' and ''H''*(''I'') = ''H''* ∩ ''G''(''I''). Since σ leaves ''H''*(''I'') invariant, there is a corresponding Hermitian symmetric space ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> ''H''*(''I'')/''H''*(''I'')∩''K'' ⊂ ''H''*/''K'' = ''M'' . The boundary component for the subset ''I'' is the union of the ''K''-translates of ''c''<sub>''I''</sub> ''M''<sub>''I''</sub>. When ''I'' is the set of all indices, ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> is a single point and the boundary component is the Shilov boundary. Moreover, ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> is in the closure of ''M''<sub>''J''</sub> if and only if ''I'' ⊇ ''J''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=286–293}}</ref>\n\n==Geometric properties==\nEvery Hermitian symmetric space is a [[Kähler manifold]]. They can be defined equivalently as Riemannian symmetric spaces with a parallel complex structure with respect to which the Riemannian metric is [[Hermitian metric|Hermitian]]. The complex structure is automatically preserved by the isometry group ''H'' of the metric, and so any Hermitian symmetric space ''M'' is a homogeneous complex manifold. Some examples are [[complex vector space]]s and [[complex projective space]]s, with their usual Hermitian metrics and [[Fubini–Study metric]]s, and the complex [[unit ball]]s with suitable metrics so that they become [[Complete metric space|complete]] and Riemannian symmetric. The [[compact space|compact]] Hermitian symmetric spaces are [[projective variety|projective varieties]], and admit a strictly larger [[Lie group]] ''G'' of [[biholomorphism]]s with respect to which they are homogeneous: in fact, they are [[generalized flag manifold]]s, i.e., ''G'' is [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] and the stabilizer of a point is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' of ''G''. Among (complex) generalized flag manifolds ''G''/''P'', they are characterized as those for which the [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]] of the Lie algebra of ''P'' is abelian. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded [[domain (mathematics)|domains]] in complex vector spaces.\n\n==Jordan algebras==\n{{See also|Mutation (Jordan algebra)|Symmetric cone|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}\nAlthough the classical Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed by ad hoc methods, [[Jordan triple system]]s, or equivalently Jordan pairs, provide a uniform algebraic means of describing all the basic properties connected with a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type and its non-compact dual. This theory is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} and {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} and summarized in {{harvtxt|Satake|1981}}. The development is in the reverse order from that using the structure theory of compact Lie groups. It starting point is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type realized as a bounded symmetric domain. It can be described in terms of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]]. This Jordan algebra structure can be used to reconstruct the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, including in particular all the associated Lie algebras and Lie groups.\n\nThe theory is easiest to describe when the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type. In that case the space is determined by a simple real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>\nwith negative definite Killing form. It must admit an action of SU(2) which only acts via the trivial and adjoint representation, both types occurring. Since <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is simple, this action is inner, so implemented by an inclusion of the Lie algebra of SU(2) in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. The complexification of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> decomposes as a direct sum of three eigenspaces for the diagonal matrices in SU(2). It is a three-graded complex Lie algebra, with the Weyl group element of SU(2) providing the involution. Each of the ±1 eigenspaces has the structure of a unital complex Jordan algebra explicitly arising as the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra. It can be identified with the multiplicity space of the adjoint representation  of SU(2) in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThe description of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type starts from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''. It admits [[Jordan frame (Jordan algebra)|Jordan frames]], i.e. sets of orthogonal minimal idempotents ''e''<sub>''1''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>. Any two are related by an automorphism of ''E'', so that the integer ''m'' is an invariant called the '''rank''' of ''E''. Moreover, if ''A'' is the complexification of ''E'', it has a unitary [[structure group (Jordan algebra)|structure group]]. It is a subgroup of GL(''A'') preserving the natural complex inner product on ''A''. Any element ''a'' in ''A'' has a polar decomposition {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with  {{math|1=α<sub>''i''</sub> ≥ 0}}. The spectral norm is defined by ||a|| = sup α<sub>''i''</sub>. The associated [[bounded symmetric domain]] is just the open unit ball ''D'' in ''A''. There is a biholomorphism between ''D'' and the tube domain ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'' where ''C'' is the open self-dual convex cone of elements in ''E'' of the form {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with ''u'' an automorphism of ''E'' and α<sub>''i''</sub> > 0. This gives two descriptions of the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. There is a natural way of using [[mutation (Jordan algebra)|mutations]] of the Jordan algebra ''A'' to compactify the space ''A''. The compactification ''X'' is a complex manifold and the finite-dimensional Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of holomorphic vector fields on ''X'' can be determined explicitly. One parameter groups of biholomorphisms can be defined such that the corresponding holomorphic vector fields span <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. This includes the group of all complex Möbius transformations corresponding to matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The subgroup SU(1,1) leaves invariant the unit ball and its closure. The subgroup SL(2,'''R''') leaves invariant the tube domain and its closure. The usual Cayley transform and its inverse, mapping the unit disk in '''C''' to the upper half plane, establishes analogous maps between ''D'' and ''T''. The polydisk corresponds to the real and complex Jordan subalgebras generated by a fixed Jordan frame. It admits a transitive action of SU(2)<sup>''m''</sup> and this action extends to ''X''. The group ''G'' generated by the one-parameter groups of biholomorphisms acts faithfully on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. The subgroup generated by the identity component ''K'' of the unitary structure group and the operators in SU(2)<sup>''m''</sup>. It defines a compact Lie group ''H'' which acts transitively on ''X''. Thus ''H'' / ''K'' is the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. The group ''G'' can be identified with the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H''. The subgroup ''H''* leaving ''D'' invariant is a  noncompact real form of ''G''. It acts transitively on ''D'' so that ''H''* / ''K'' is the dual Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. The inclusions ''D'' ⊂ ''A'' ⊂ ''X'' reproduce the Borel and Harish-Chandra embeddings. The classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type reduces to that of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. These were classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} in terms of [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]s, a special type of [[composition algebra]].\n\nIn general a Hermitian symmetric space gives rise to a 3-graded Lie algebra with a period 2 conjugate linear automorphism switching the parts of degree ±1 and preserving the degree 0 part. This gives rise to the structure of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]], to which {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} extended the theory of Jordan algebras. All irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed uniformly within this framework. {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} constructed the irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-tube type from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra together with a period 2 automorphism. The −1 eigenspace of the automorphism has the structure of a Jordan pair, which can be deduced from that of the larger Jordan algebra. In the non-tube type case corresponding to a [[Siegel domain]] of type II, there is no distinguished subgroup of real or complex Möbius transformations. For irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces, tube type is characterized by the real dimension of the Shilov boundary {{math|''S''}} being equal to the complex dimension of {{math|''D''}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Invariant convex cone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Agaoka|first= Yoshio|last2=Kaneda|first2= Eiji|title= Strongly orthogonal subsets in root systems|journal= Hokkaido Math.

      "title": "Hilbert's fifth problem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_fifth_problem",
      "text": "'''Hilbert's fifth problem''' is the fifth mathematical problem from the [[Hilbert problems|problem list]] publicized in 1900 by mathematician [[David Hilbert]], and concerns the characterization of [[Lie group]]s.\n\nThe theory of Lie groups describes [[continuous symmetry]] in mathematics; its importance there and in [[theoretical physics]] (for example [[quark theory]]) grew steadily in the twentieth century. In rough terms, Lie group theory is the common ground of [[group theory]] and the theory of [[topological manifold]]s. The question Hilbert asked was an acute one of making this precise: is there any difference if a restriction to [[smooth manifold]]s is imposed?\n\nThe expected answer was in the negative (the [[classical group]]s, the most central examples in Lie group theory, are smooth manifolds). This was eventually confirmed in the early 1950s. Since the precise notion of \"manifold\" was not available to Hilbert, there is room for some debate about the formulation of the problem in contemporary mathematical language.\n\n== Classic formulation ==\nA formulation that was accepted for a long period was that the question was to characterize Lie groups as the [[topological group]]s that were also [[topological manifold]]s. In terms closer to those that Hilbert would have used, near the [[identity element]] {{mvar|e}} of the group {{mvar|G}} in question, there is an [[open set]] {{mvar|U}} in [[Euclidean space]] containing {{mvar|e}}, and on some open subset {{mvar|V}} of {{mvar|U}} there is a [[continuous mapping]]\n\n:{{math|''F'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''U''}}\n\nthat satisfies the [[group axioms]] where those are defined. This much is a fragment of a typical [[manifold|locally Euclidean topological group]]. The problem is then to show that {{mvar|F}} is a [[smooth function]] near {{mvar|e}} (since topological groups are [[homogeneous space]]s, they look the same everywhere as they do near {{mvar|e}}).\n\nAnother way to put this is that the possible [[differentiability class]] of {{mvar|F}} does not matter: the group axioms collapse the whole {{math|''C<sup>&thinsp;k</sup>''}} gamut.\n\n== Solution ==\nThe first major result was that of [[John von Neumann]] in 1933,<ref>{{cite journal|last=John|first=von Neumann|title=Die Einführung analytischer parameter in topologischen Gruppen|journal=Annals of Mathematics |year=1933 |volume=34 |pages=170–190 |doi=10.2307/1968347|issue=1|ref=harv|jstor=1968347}}</ref> for [[compact group]]s. The [[locally compact abelian group]] case was solved in 1934 by [[Lev Pontryagin]]. The final resolution, at least in this interpretation of what Hilbert meant, came with the work of [[Andrew Gleason]], [[Deane Montgomery]] and [[Leo Zippin]] in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1953, [[Hidehiko Yamabe]] obtained the final answer to Hilbert’s Fifth Problem:<ref>According to {{harvtxt|Morikuni|1961|p=i}}</ref>\n\n:If a connected locally compact group {{mvar|G}} is a [[projective limit]] of a sequence of Lie groups, and if {{mvar|G}} \"has no small subgroups\" (a condition defined below), then {{mvar|G}} is a Lie group.\n\nHowever, the question is still debated since in the literature there have been other such claims, largely based on different interpretations of Hilbert's statement of the problem given by various researchers.<ref>For a review of such claims (however completely ignoring the contributions of Yamabe) and for a new one, see {{harvtxt|Rosinger|1998|pp=xiii–xiv and pp. 169–170}}</ref>\n\nMore generally, every locally compact, almost connected group is the projective limit of a Lie group. If we consider a general locally compact group {{mvar|G}} and the connected component of the identity {{math|''G''<sub>0</sub>}}, we have a group extension\n\n:{{math|''G''<sub>0</sub> → ''G'' → ''G''/''G''<sub>0</sub>.}}\n\nAs a totally disconnected group, {{math|''G''/''G''<sub>0</sub>}} has an open compact subgroup, and the pullback {{math|''G′''}} of such an open compact subgroup is an open, almost connected subgroup of {{mvar|G}}. In this way, we have a smooth structure on {{mvar|G}}, since it is homeomorphic to {{math|(''G′'' × ''G′''&thinsp;)/''G''<sub>0</sub>}}, where {{math|''G′''/''G''<sub>0</sub>}} is a discrete set.\n\n== Alternate formulation ==\nAnother view is that {{mvar|G}} ought to be treated as a [[transformation group]], rather than abstractly. This leads to the formulation of the [[Hilbert–Smith conjecture]], which was proven for R3 {{As of|2013|lc=on}}.\n\n== No small subgroups ==\nAn important condition in the theory is '''[[no small subgroup]]s'''.  A topological group {{mvar|G}}, or a partial piece of a group like {{mvar|F}} above, is said to have ''no small subgroups'' if there is a neighbourhood {{mvar|N}} of {{mvar|e}} containing no subgroup bigger than {{math|{''e''}.}} For example, the [[circle group]] satisfies the condition, while the [[p-adic integers|{{mvar|p}}-adic integers]] {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} as [[Abelian group|additive group]] does not, because {{mvar|N}} will contain the subgroups: {{math|''p<sup>k</sup>''&thinsp;'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, for all large integers {{mvar|k}}. This gives an idea of what the difficulty is like in the problem. In the Hilbert–Smith conjecture case it is a matter of a known reduction to whether {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} can act faithfully on a [[closed manifold]]. Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin characterized Lie groups amongst [[locally compact group]]s, as those having no small subgroups.\n\n== Infinite dimensions ==\nResearchers have also considered Hilbert's fifth problem without supposing [[Lie groups#Infinite dimensional Lie groups|finite dimensionality]].

A genus zero analogue of the Hitchin system arises as a certain limit of the [[Knizhnik&ndash;Zamolodchikov equations]].  Almost all integrable systems of [[classical mechanics]] can be obtained as particular cases of the Hitchin system (or its meromorphic  generalization or in a singular limit).\n\nThe '''Hitchin fibration''' is the map from the moduli space of [[Hitchin pair]]s to characteristic polynomials. \n{{harvs|txt|last=Ngô|year1=2006|year2=2010}} used Hitchin fibrations over finite fields in his proof of the [[fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].\n\n==Description==\n\nUsing the language of algebraic geometry, the phase space of the system is a partial compactification of the [[cotangent bundle]] to the [[moduli space]] of stable ''G''-bundles for some [[reductive group]] ''G'', on some compact algebraic curve. This space is endowed with a canonical symplectic form. Suppose for simplicity that ''G''=GL(''n''), the [[general linear group]]; then the hamiltonians can be described as follows: the tangent space to ''G''-bundles at the bundle ''F'' is \n\n:<math>H^1(End(F)),</math>\n\nwhich by [[Serre duality]] is dual to \n\n:<math>\\Phi \\in H^0(End(F)\\otimes K),</math> \n\nso a pair \n\n:<math>(F,\\Phi)</math> \n\ncalled a Hitchin pair or [[Higgs bundle]], defines a point in the cotangent bundle.

So taking any basis in these vector spaces we obtain functions ''H<sub>i</sub>'', which are Hitchin's hamiltonians. The construction for general reductive group is similar and uses invariant polynomials on the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G''.\n\nFor trivial reasons these functions are algebraically independent, and some calculations show that their number is exactly half of the dimension of the phase space.

      "text": "{{Short description|Topological space in group theory}}\n[[File:Torus.png|thumb|A [[torus]]. The standard torus is homogeneous under its [[diffeomorphism]] and [[homeomorphism]] groups, and the [[flat torus]] is homogeneous under its diffeomorphism, homeomorphism, and [[isometry group]]s. ]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], particularly in the theories of [[Lie group]]s, [[algebraic group]]s and [[topological group]]s, a '''homogeneous space''' for a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a non-empty [[manifold]] or [[topological space]] ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|transitively]].  The elements of ''G'' are called the '''symmetries''' of ''X''. A special case of this is when the group ''G'' in question is the [[automorphism group]] of the space ''X'' – here \"automorphism group\" can mean [[isometry group]], [[diffeomorphism group]], or [[homeomorphism group]]. In this case, ''X'' is homogeneous if intuitively ''X'' looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of ''G'' be [[effective group action|faithful]] (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' which can be thought of as preserving some \"geometric structure\" on ''X'', and making ''X'' into a single [[orbit (group theory)|''G''-orbit]].\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet ''X'' be a non-empty set and ''G'' a group. Then ''X'' is called a ''G''-space if it is equipped with an action of ''G'' on ''X''.<ref>We assume that the action is on the ''left''. The distinction is only important in the description of ''X'' as a coset space.</ref> Note that automatically ''G'' acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If ''X'' in addition belongs to some [[category (mathematics)|category]], then the elements of ''G'' are assumed to act as [[automorphism]]s in the same category. Thus, the maps on ''X'' effected by ''G'' are structure preserving. A homogeneous space is a ''G''-space on which ''G'' acts transitively.\n\nSuccinctly, if ''X'' is an object of the category '''C''', then the structure of a ''G''-space is a [[homomorphism]]:\n\n:<math>\\rho : G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}_{\\mathbf{C}}(X)</math>\n\ninto the group of [[automorphism]]s of the object ''X'' in the category '''C'''. The pair (''X'', ρ) defines a homogeneous space provided ρ(''G'') is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of ''X''.\n\n===Examples===\nFor example, if ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then group elements are assumed to act as [[homeomorphism]]s on ''X''. The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Homeo(''X'') into the [[homeomorphism group]] of ''X''.\n\nSimilarly, if ''X'' is a [[differentiable manifold]], then the group elements are [[diffeomorphism]]s. The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Diffeo(''X'') into the diffeomorphism group of ''X''.\n\n[[Riemannian symmetric space]]s are an important class of homogeneous spaces, and include many of the examples listed below.\n\nConcrete examples include:\n\n;Isometry groups\n*Positive curvature:\n# Sphere ([[orthogonal group]]): <math>S^{n-1} \\cong \\mathrm{O}(n)/\\mathrm{O}(n-1)</math>. This is true because of the following observations: First, <math>S^{n-1}</math> is the set of vectors in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> with norm <math>1</math>. If we consider one of these vectors as a base vector, then any other vector can be constructed using an orthogonal transformation. If we consider the span of this vector as a one dimensional subspace of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, then the complement is an <math>(n-1)</math>-dimensional vector space which is invariant under an orthogonal transformation from <math>\\text{O}(n-1)</math>. This shows us why we can construct <math>S^{n-1}</math> as a homogeneous space.\n# Oriented sphere ([[special orthogonal group]]): <math>S^{n-1} \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(n)/\\mathrm{SO}(n-1)</math>\n# Projective space ([[projective orthogonal group]]): <math>\\mathrm{P}^{n-1} \\cong \\mathrm{PO}(n)/\\mathrm{PO}(n-1)</math>\n* Flat (zero curvature):\n# Euclidean space ([[Euclidean group]], point stabilizer is orthogonal group): '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> ≅ E(''n'')/O(''n'')\n* Negative curvature:\n# Hyperbolic space ([[orthochronous Lorentz group]], point stabilizer orthogonal group, corresponding to [[hyperboloid model]]): '''H'''<sup>''n''</sup> ≅ O<sup>+</sup>(1, ''n'')/O(''n'')\n# Oriented hyperbolic space: SO<sup>+</sup>(1, ''n'')/SO(''n'')\n# [[Anti-de Sitter space]]: AdS<sub>''n''+1</sub> = O(2, ''n'')/O(1, ''n'')\n\n;Others\n* [[Affine space]] (for [[affine group]], point stabilizer [[general linear group]]): '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> = Aff(''n'', ''K'')/GL(''n'', ''k'').\n* [[Grassmannian]]: <math>\\mathrm{Gr}(r,n) = \\mathrm{O}(n)/(\\mathrm{O}(r) \\times \\mathrm{O}(n - r))</math>\n* [[Topological vector space]]s (in the sense of topology)\n\n==Geometry==\nFrom the point of view of the [[Erlangen program]], one may understand that \"all points are the same\", in the [[geometry]] of ''X''. This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before [[Riemannian geometry]], in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nThus, for example, [[Euclidean space]], [[affine space]] and [[projective space]] are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective [[symmetry group]]s. The same is true of the models found of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] of constant [[curvature]], such as [[hyperbolic space]].\n\nA further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional [[vector space]]). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL<sub>4</sub> acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by ''line co-ordinates'': these are the 2×2 [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the 4×2 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the [[line geometry]] of [[Julius Plücker]].\n\n==Homogeneous spaces as coset spaces==\nIn general, if ''X'' is a homogeneous space, and ''H''<sub>''o''</sub> is the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of some marked point ''o'' in ''X'' (a choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]), the points of ''X'' correspond to the left [[coset]]s ''G''/''H''<sub>''o''</sub>, and the marked point ''o'' corresponds to the coset of the identity. Conversely, given a coset space ''G''/''H'', it is a homogeneous space for ''G'' with a distinguished point, namely the coset of the identity. Thus a homogeneous space can be thought of as a coset space without a choice of origin.\n\nIn general, a different choice of origin ''o'' will lead to a quotient of ''G'' by a different subgroup ''H<sub>o′</sub>'' which is related to ''H<sub>o</sub>'' by an [[inner automorphism]] of ''G''.  Specifically,\n\n:<math>H_{o'} = gH_og^{-1} \\qquad \\qquad (1)</math>\n\nwhere ''g'' is any element of ''G'' for which ''go''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''o''′. Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such ''g'' is selected; it depends only on ''g'' modulo ''H''<sub>''o''</sub>.\n\nIf the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is continuous, then ''H'' is a [[closed subgroup]] of ''G''. In particular, if ''G'' is a [[Lie group]], then ''H'' is a [[Lie subgroup]] by [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]].  Hence ''G''/''H'' is a [[smooth manifold]] and so ''X'' carries a unique [[smooth structure]] compatible with the group action.\n\nIf ''H'' is the identity subgroup {''e''}, then ''X'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]].\n\nOne can go further to [[double coset|''double'' coset]] spaces, notably [[Clifford–Klein form]]s ''Γ''\\''G''/''H'', where ''Γ'' is a discrete subgroup (of ''G'') acting [[properly discontinuously]].\n\n==Example==\nFor example, in the line geometry case, we can identify H as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional [[general linear group]], GL(4), defined by conditions on the matrix entries\n\n:''h''<sub>13</sub> = ''h''<sub>14</sub> = ''h''<sub>23</sub> = ''h''<sub>24</sub> = 0,\n\nby looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that ''X'' has dimension 4.\n\nSince the [[homogeneous coordinates]] given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact, a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers.\n\nThis example was the first known example of a [[Grassmannian]], other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics.\n\n==Prehomogeneous vector spaces==\nThe idea of a [[prehomogeneous vector space]] was introduced by [[Mikio Sato]].\n\nIt is a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' with a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of an [[algebraic group]] ''G'', such that there is an orbit of ''G'' that is open for the [[Zariski topology]] (and so, dense). An example is GL(1) acting on a one-dimensional space.\n\nThe definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as \"castling\".\n\n==Homogeneous spaces in physics==\n[[Physical cosmology]] using the [[general theory of relativity]] makes use of the [[Bianchi classification]] system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the [[space (physics)|space part]] of background [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for some [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]s; for example, the three cases of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the [[Mixmaster universe]] represents an [[isotropy|anisotropic]] example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.<ref>{{citation |title=Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 2: The Classical Theory of Fields |author=[[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] |isbn=978-0-7506-2768-9 |year=1980 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}</ref>\n\nA homogeneous space of ''N'' dimensions admits a set of <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}N(N+1)</math> [[Killing vectors]].<ref>{{citation |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |author=[[Steven Weinberg]] |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1972}}</ref> For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields <math>\\xi^{(a)}_{i}</math>,\n\n:<math>\\xi^{(a)}_{[i;k]}=C^{a}_{\\ bc}\\xi^{(b)}_i \\xi^{(c)}_k</math>\n\nwhere the object <math>C^{a}_{\\ bc}</math>, the \"structure constants\", form a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] [[tensor|order-three tensor]] [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and \";\" represents the [[covariant derivative|covariant differential operator]]).

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], specifically [[group theory]], the '''identity component''' of a [[group (mathematics) | group]] ''G'' refers to several closely related notions of the largest [[connected space | connected]] subgroup of ''G'' containing the identity element. \n\nIn [[point set topology]], the '''identity component of a [[topological group]]''' ''G'' is the [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] ''G''<sup>0</sup> of ''G'' that contains the [[identity element]] of the group. The '''identity path component of a topological group''' ''G'' is the [[path component]] of ''G'' that contains the identity element of the group. \n\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], the '''identity component of an [[algebraic group]]''' ''G'' over a field ''k'' is the identity component of the underlying topological space. The '''identity component of a [[group scheme]]''' ''G'' over a base [[scheme (mathematics) | scheme]] ''S'' is, roughly speaking, the group scheme ''G''<sup>0</sup> whose [[fiber (mathematics) | fiber]] over the point ''s'' of ''S'' is the connected component ''(G<sub>s</sub>)<sup>0</sup>'' of the fiber ''G<sub>s</sub>'', an algebraic group.<ref>SGA 3, v. 1, Exposé VI, Définition 3.1</ref>.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe identity component ''G''<sup>0</sup> of a topological or algebraic group ''G'' is a [[closed set|closed]] [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''. It is closed since components are always closed. It is a subgroup since multiplication and inversion in a topological or algebraic group are [[continuous map (topology)|continuous map]]s by definition. Moreover, for any continuous [[automorphism]] ''a'' of ''G'' we have  \n\n:''a''(''G''<sup>0</sup>) = ''G''<sup>0</sup>.\n\nThus, ''G''<sup>0</sup> is a [[characteristic subgroup]] of ''G'', so it is normal.\n\nThe identity component ''G''<sup>0</sup> of a topological group ''G'' need not be [[open set|open]] in ''G''. In fact, we may have ''G''<sup>0</sup> = {''e''}, in which case ''G'' is [[totally disconnected group|totally disconnected]]. However, the identity component of a [[locally path-connected space]] (for instance a [[Lie group]]) is always open, since it contains a [[path-connected]] neighbourhood of {''e''}; and therefore is a [[clopen set]]. \n\nThe identity path component of a topological group may in general be smaller than the identity component (since path connectedness is a stronger condition than connectedness), but these agree if ''G'' is locally path-connected.\n\n== Component group ==\nThe [[quotient group]] ''G''/''G''<sup>0</sup> is called the '''group of components''' or '''component group''' of ''G''. Its elements are just the connected components of ''G''. The component group ''G''/''G''<sup>0</sup> is a [[discrete group]] if and only if ''G''<sup>0</sup> is open. If ''G'' is an algebraic group of [[glossary of algebraic geometry | finite type]], such as an [[affine algebraic group]], then ''G''/''G''<sup>0</sup> is actually a [[finite group]].\n\nOne may similarly define the path component group as the group of path components (quotient of ''G'' by the identity path component), and in general the component group is a quotient of the path component group, but if ''G'' is locally path connected these groups agree. The path component group can also be characterized as the zeroth [[homotopy group]], <math>\\pi_0(G,e).</math>\n\n==Examples==\n*The group of non-zero real numbers with multiplication ('''R'''*,•) has two components and the group of components is ({1,&minus;1},•).\n*Consider the [[group of units]] ''U'' in the ring of [[split-complex number]]s. In the ordinary topology of the plane {''z'' = ''x'' + j ''y'' : ''x'', ''y'' ∈ '''R'''}, ''U'' is divided into four components by the lines ''y'' = ''x'' and ''y'' = &minus; ''x'' where ''z'' has no inverse. Then ''U''<sup>0</sup> = { ''z'' : |''y''| < ''x'' } . In this case the group of components of ''U'' is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]].\n*The identity component of the additive group ('''Z'''<sub>p</sub>,+) of [[p-adic number | p-adic integers]] is the singleton set {1}, since '''Z'''<sub>p</sub> is totally disconnected.\n*The [[Weyl group]] of a [[reductive group | reductive algebraic group]] ''G'' is the components group of the [[centralizer and normalizer | normalizer group]] of a [[maximal torus]] of ''G''.\n*Consider the group scheme μ<sub>''2''</sub> = Spec('''Z'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> - 1)) of second [[root of unity | roots of unity]] defined over the base scheme Spec('''Z'''). Topologically, μ<sub>''n''</sub> consists of two copies of the curve Spec('''Z''') glued together at the point (that is, [[prime ideal]]) 2. Therefore, μ<sub>''n''</sub> is connected as a topological space, hence as a scheme. However, μ<sub>''2''</sub> does not equal its identity component because the fiber over every point of Spec('''Z''') except 2 consists of two discrete points.\n\nAn algebraic group ''G'' over a [[topological ring | topological field]] ''K'' admits two natural topologies, the [[Zariski topology]] and the topology inherited from ''K''. The identity component of ''G'' often changes depending on the topology. For instance, the [[general linear group]] GL<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''') is connected as an algebraic group but has two path components as a Lie group, the matrices of positive determinant and the matrices of negative determinant. Any connected algebraic group over a non-Archimedean [[local field]] ''K'' is totally disconnected in the ''K''-topology and thus has trivial identity component in that topology.\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=June 2016}}\n{{reflist}}\n*[[Lev Semenovich Pontryagin]], ''Topological Groups'', 1966.\n*{{Citation | author1-last=Demazure | author1-first=Michel | author1-link=Michel Demazure | author2-last=Gabriel | author2-first=Pierre | author2-link=Pierre Gabriel | title=Groupes algébriques.

For example, the symmetry operation S<sub>6</sub> is the combination of a rotation of (360°/6)=60° and a mirror plane reflection. (This should not to be confused with the same notation for [[symmetric group]]s).<ref name=\"Bishop\"/>\n* In [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]] the symbol {{overline|''n''}} is used for '''''n''-fold rotoinversion'''; i.e., rotation by an angle of rotation of 360°/''n'' with inversion.\n* The [[Coxeter notation]] for S<sub>2n</sub> is [2''n''<sup>+</sup>,2<sup>+</sup>].\n* The [[Orbifold notation]] is ''n''×, order 2''n''.\n\nThe [[Coxeter notation#Subgroups|direct subgroup]], index 2, is C<sub>''n''</sub>, [''n'']<sup>+</sup>, (''nn''), order ''n'', as the rotoreflection generator applied twice. \n\n''S''<sub>2''n''</sub> for odd ''n'' contain [[Inversion in a point|inversion]], with {{nowrap|1=''S''<sub>2</sub> = ''C<sub>i</sub>''}} is the group generated by inversion.

For example ''S''<sub>4</sub> is a subgroup of ''S''<sub>12</sub>.\n\n==As an indirect isometry ==\n\nIn a wider sense, an improper rotation may be defined as any '''[[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|indirect isometry]]'''; i.e., an element of ''[[Euclidean group|E]]''(3)/''E''<sup>+</sup>(3): thus it can also be a pure reflection in a plane, or have a [[glide reflection|glide plane]]. An indirect isometry is an [[affine transformation]] with an [[orthogonal matrix]] that has a determinant of −1.\n\nA '''proper rotation''' is an ordinary rotation. In the wider sense, a proper rotation is defined as a '''direct isometry'''; i.e., an element of ''E''<sup>+</sup>(3): it can also be the identity, a rotation with a translation along the axis, or a pure translation. A direct isometry is an affine transformation with an orthogonal matrix that has a determinant of 1.\n\nIn either the narrower or the wider senses, the composition of two improper rotations is a proper rotation, and the composition of an improper and a proper rotation is an improper rotation.\n\n== Physical systems==\nWhen studying the symmetry of a physical system under an improper rotation (e.g., if a system has a mirror symmetry plane), it is important to distinguish between [[vector (geometry)|vector]]s and [[pseudovector]]s (as well as [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] and [[pseudoscalar]]s, and in general between [[tensor]]s and [[pseudotensor]]s), since the latter transform differently under proper and improper rotations (in 3 dimensions, pseudovectors are invariant under inversion).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Isometry]]\n*[[Orthogonal group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Euclidean symmetries]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]"

The dimension of the group is {{nowrap|''n''(''n'' − 1)/2}}.\n\nThe '''indefinite special orthogonal group''', {{nowrap|SO(''p'', ''q'')}} is the [[subgroup]] of {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'')}} consisting of all elements with [[determinant]] 1. Unlike in the definite case, {{nowrap|SO(''p'', ''q'')}} is not connected – it has 2 components – and there are two additional finite index subgroups, namely the connected {{nowrap|SO<sup>+</sup>(''p'', ''q'')}} and {{nowrap|O<sup>+</sup>(''p'', ''q'')}}, which has 2 components – see {{slink||Topology}} for definition and discussion.\n\nThe signature of the form determines the group up to [[isomorphism]]; interchanging ''p'' with ''q'' amounts to replacing the metric by its negative, and so gives the same group.

We assume in what follows that both ''p'' and ''q'' are positive.\n\nThe group {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'')}} is defined for vector spaces over the [[real number|real]]s. For [[Complex number|complex]] spaces, all groups {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q''; '''C''')}} are isomorphic to the usual [[orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|O(''p'' + ''q''; '''C''')}}, since the transform <math>z_j \\mapsto iz_j</math> changes the signature of a form.\n\nIn even dimension {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''p''}}, {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''p'')}} is known as the [[#Split orthogonal group|split orthogonal group]].\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Squeeze r=1.5.svg|thumb|[[Squeeze mapping]]s, here {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 3/2}}, are the basic hyperbolic symmetries.]]\nThe basic example is the [[squeeze mapping]]s, which is the group {{nowrap|SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 1)}} of (the identity component of) linear transforms preserving the [[unit hyperbola]].

Diagonalizing this matrix gives a conjugation of this group with the standard group {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'')}}.\n\n==Topology==\nAssuming both ''p'' and ''q'' are positive, neither of the groups {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'')}} nor {{nowrap|SO(''p'', ''q'')}} are [[connected space|connected]], having four and two components respectively.\n{{nowrap|1=''π''<sub>0</sub>(O(''p'', ''q'')) ≅ C<sub>2</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>}} is the [[Klein four-group]], with each factor being whether an element preserves or reverses the respective orientations on the ''p'' and ''q'' dimensional subspaces on which the form is definite; note that reversing orientation on only one of these subspaces reverses orientation on the whole space.

      "title": "Infinitesimal transformation",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_transformation",
      "text": "{{Technical|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''infinitesimal transformation''' is a [[limit (mathematics)|limiting]] form of ''small'' [[transformation (geometry)|transformation]]. For example one may talk about an [[infinitesimal rotation]] of a [[rigid body]], in three-dimensional space. This is conventionally represented by a 3×3 [[skew-symmetric matrix]] ''A''. It is not the matrix of an actual [[rotation]] in space; but for small real values of a parameter ε the transformation\n\n:<math>T=I+\\varepsilon A</math>\n\nis a small rotation, up to quantities of order ε<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==History==\nA comprehensive theory of infinitesimal transformations was first given by [[Sophus Lie]]. This was at the heart of his work, on what are now called [[Lie group]]s and their accompanying [[Lie algebra]]s; and the identification of their role in [[geometry]] and especially the theory of [[differential equation]]s. The properties of an abstract [[Lie algebra]] are exactly those definitive of infinitesimal transformations, just as the axioms of [[group theory]] embody [[symmetry]]. The term \"Lie algebra\" was introduced in 1934 by [[Hermann Weyl]], for what had until then been known as the ''algebra of infinitesimal transformations'' of a Lie group.\n==Examples==\nFor example, in the case of infinitesimal rotations, the Lie algebra structure is that provided by the [[cross product]], once a skew-symmetric matrix has been identified with a 3-[[Vector (geometric)|vector]]. This amounts to choosing an axis vector for the rotations; the defining [[Jacobi identity]] is a well-known property of cross products.\n\nThe earliest example of an infinitesimal transformation that may have been recognised as such was in [[Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions]]. Here it is stated that a function ''F'' of ''n'' variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> that is homogeneous of degree ''r'', satisfies\n\n:<math>\\Theta F=rF \\, </math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>\\Theta=\\sum_i x_i{\\partial\\over\\partial x_i},</math>\n\nthe [[Theta operator]].  That is, from the property\n\n:<math>F(\\lambda x_1,\\dots, \\lambda x_n)=\\lambda^r F(x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\,</math>\n\nit is possible to differentiate with respect to λ and then set λ equal to 1. This then becomes a [[necessary condition]] on a [[smooth function]] ''F'' to have the homogeneity property; it is also sufficient (by using [[Schwartz distribution]]s one can reduce the [[mathematical analysis]] considerations here). This setting is typical, in that there is a [[one-parameter group]] of [[scaling (mathematics)|scalings]] operating; and the information is coded in an infinitesimal transformation that is a [[first-order differential operator]].\n\n==Operator version of Taylor's theorem==\nThe operator equation\n\n:<math>e^{tD}f(x)=f(x+t)\\,</math>\n\nwhere \n\n:<math>D={d\\over dx}</math>\n\nis an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] version of [[Taylor's theorem]] &mdash; and is therefore only valid under ''caveats'' about ''f'' being an [[analytic function]]. Concentrating on the operator part, it shows that ''D'' is an infinitesimal transformation, generating translations of the real line via the [[exponential function|exponential]]. In Lie's theory, this is generalised a long way. Any [[connected space|connected]] Lie group can be built up by means of its [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|infinitesimal generator]]s (a basis for the Lie algebra of the group); with explicit if not always useful information given in the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]].\n\n== References ==\n*{{Springer|id=L/l058370|title=Lie algebra}}\n*[[Sophus Lie]] (1893) [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/lie-_infinite_continuous_groups_-_i.pdf Vorlesungen über Continuierliche Gruppen], English translation by D.H.

''\n\nNote that in general Lie groups this statement is far from being true; in particular, in a [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]] Lie group, for any neighbourhood of the identity there exists a lattice in the group which is generated by its intersection with the neighbourhood: for example, in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>, the lattice <math>\\varepsilon \\mathbb Z^n</math> satisfies this property for <math>\\varepsilon > 0</math> small enough.\n\n=== Proof ===\n\nThe main technical result of Kazhdan–Margulis, which is interesting in its own right and from which the better-known statement above follows immediately, is the following.{{sfn|Raghunatan|1972|loc=Theorem 11.7}}\n\n:''Given a semisimple Lie group without compact factors <math>G</math> endowed with a norm <math>|\\cdot|</math>, there exists <math>c > 1</math>, a neighbourhood <math>U_0</math> of <math>e</math> in <math>G</math>, a compact subset <math>E \\subset G</math> such that, for any discrete subgroup <math>\\Gamma \\subset G</math> there exists a <math>g \\in E</math> such that <math>|g\\gamma g^{-1}| \\ge c|\\gamma|</math> for all <math>\\gamma \\in \\Gamma \\cap U_0</math>.

The space {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''/''H''}} of a Klein geometry is a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension\n:dim ''X'' = dim ''G'' − dim ''H''.\n\nThere is a natural smooth [[Group action (mathematics)|left action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' given by\n:<math>g.(aH) = (ga)H.</math>\nClearly, this action is transitive (take {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}}), so that one may then regard ''X'' as a [[homogeneous space]] for the action of ''G''. The [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of the identity coset {{nowrap|''H'' ∈ ''X''}} is precisely the group ''H''.\n\nGiven any connected smooth manifold ''X'' and a smooth transitive action by a Lie group ''G'' on ''X'', we can construct an associated Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} by fixing a basepoint ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''X'' and letting ''H'' be the stabilizer subgroup of ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''G''. The group ''H'' is necessarily a closed subgroup of ''G'' and ''X'' is naturally [[diffeomorphic]] to ''G''/''H''.\n\nTwo Klein geometries {{nowrap|(''G''<sub>1</sub>, ''H''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(''G''<sub>2</sub>, ''H''<sub>2</sub>)}} are '''geometrically isomorphic''' if there is a [[Lie group isomorphism]] {{nowrap|''φ'' : ''G''<sub>1</sub> → ''G''<sub>2</sub>}} so that {{nowrap|1=''φ''(''H''<sub>1</sub>) = ''H''<sub>2</sub>}}. In particular, if ''φ''  is [[conjugacy class|conjugation]] by an element {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}, we see that {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} and {{nowrap|(''G'', ''gHg''<sup>−1</sup>)}} are isomorphic. The Klein geometry associated to a homogeneous space ''X'' is then unique up to isomorphism (i.e. it is independent of the chosen basepoint ''x''<sub>0</sub>).\n\n==Bundle description==\nGiven a Lie group ''G'' and closed subgroup ''H'', there is natural [[Group action (mathematics)|right action]] of ''H'' on ''G'' given by right multiplication.  This action is both free and [[proper action|proper]]. The [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] are simply the left [[coset]]s of ''H'' in ''G''. One concludes that ''G'' has the structure of a smooth [[principal bundle|principal ''H''-bundle]] over the left coset space ''G''/''H'':\n:<math>H\\to G\\to G/H .</math>\n\n==Types of Klein geometries==\n\n===Effective geometries===\nThe action of ''G'' on {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''/''H''}} need not be effective. The '''kernel''' of a Klein geometry is defined to be the kernel of the action of ''G'' on ''X''. It is given by\n:<math>K = \\{k \\in G : g^{-1}kg \\in H\\;\\;\\forall g \\in G\\}.</math>\nThe kernel ''K'' may also be described as the [[core (group)|core]] of ''H'' in ''G'' (i.e. the largest subgroup of ''H'' that is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in ''G''). It is the group generated by all the normal subgroups of ''G'' that lie in ''H''.\n\nA Klein geometry is said to be '''effective''' if {{nowrap|1=''K'' = 1}} and '''locally effective''' if ''K'' is [[discrete group|discrete]]. If {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is a Klein geometry with kernel ''K'', then {{nowrap|(''G''/''K'', ''H''/''K'')}} is an effective Klein geometry canonically associated to {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}}.\n\n===Geometrically oriented geometries===\nA Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is '''geometrically oriented''' if ''G'' is [[connected space|connected]]. (This does ''not'' imply that ''G''/''H'' is an [[orientability|oriented manifold]]). If ''H'' is connected it follows that ''G'' is also connected (this is because ''G''/''H'' is assumed to be connected, and {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G''/''H''}} is a [[fibration]]).\n\nGiven any Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}}, there is a geometrically oriented geometry canonically associated to {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} with the same base space ''G''/''H''. This is the geometry {{nowrap|(''G''<sub>0</sub>, ''G''<sub>0</sub> ∩ ''H'')}} where ''G''<sub>0</sub> is the [[identity component]] of ''G''. Note that {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''G''<sub>0</sub> ''H''}}.\n\n===Reductive geometries===\nA Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is said to be '''reductive''' and ''G''/''H'' a '''reductive homogeneous space''' if the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak h</math> of ''H'' has an ''H''-invariant complement in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\nIn the following table, there is a description of the classical geometries, modeled as Klein geometries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"; text-align:center; margin:.5em 0 .5em 1em;\"\n|-\n| \n| '''Underlying space'''\n| '''Transformation group ''G'''''\n| '''Subgroup ''H'''''\n| '''Invariants'''\n|-\n!

      "text": "{{distinguish|text=[[Klein four-group]], the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2}}\n{{Groups}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Kleinian group''' is a [[discrete subgroup]] of [[PSL(2,C)|PSL(2, '''C''')]]. The group PSL(2, '''C''') of 2 by 2 complex  matrices of determinant 1 modulo its center has several natural representations: as [[conformal transformation]]s of the [[Riemann sphere]], and as [[orientation-preserving]] [[isometries]] of 3-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]] '''H'''<sup>3</sup>, and as orientation preserving [[conformal map|conformal]]  maps of the open [[unit ball]] ''B''<sup>3</sup> in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> to itself. Therefore, a Kleinian group can be regarded as a discrete subgroup acting on one of these spaces.\n==History==\nThe theory of general Kleinian groups was founded by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Felix Klein|first=Felix|last=Klein|year=1883}} and  {{harvs|txt|first=Henri| last=Poincaré|authorlink=Henri Poincaré|year=1883}}, who named them  after [[Felix Klein]]. The special case of [[Schottky group]]s had been studied a few years earlier, in 1877, by Schottky.\n\n==Definitions==\n{{technical|section|date=February 2019}}\nBy considering the ball's{{which|date=February 2019}} boundary, a Kleinian group can also be defined as a subgroup Γ of PGL(2,'''C'''), the complex [[projective linear group]], which acts by [[Möbius transformation]]s on the [[Riemann sphere]]. Classically, a Kleinian group was required to act properly discontinuously on a non-empty open subset of the Riemann sphere, but modern usage allows any discrete subgroup.\n\nWhen Γ is isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] <math>\\pi_1</math> of a [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]], then the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] '''H'''<sup>3</sup>/Γ becomes a [[Kleinian model]] of the manifold.  Many authors use the terms ''Kleinian model'' and ''Kleinian group'' interchangeably, letting the one stand for the other.\n\nDiscreteness implies points in ''B''<sup>3</sup>{{what|date=February 2019}} have finite [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]]s, and discrete [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] under the group&nbsp;Γ. But the orbit Γ''p'' of a point ''p'' will typically [[accumulation point|accumulate]] on the boundary of the [[closed ball]] <math>\\bar{B}^3</math>.\n\n[[Image:Apollonian gasket.svg|thumb|An [[Apollonian gasket]] is an example of a limit set of a Kleinian group]] The boundary of the closed ball is called the '''''sphere at infinity''''', and is denoted <math>S^2_\\infty</math>. The set of [[accumulation point]]s of Γ''p'' in <math>S^2_\\infty</math> is called the '''''limit set''''' of&nbsp;Γ, and usually denoted <math>\\Lambda(\\Gamma)</math>. The complement <math>\\Omega(\\Gamma)=S^2_\\infty - \\Lambda(\\Gamma)</math> is called the '''domain of discontinuity''' or the '''ordinary set''' or the '''regular set'''. [[Ahlfors' finiteness theorem]] implies that if the group is finitely generated then <math>\\Omega(\\Gamma)/\\Gamma</math> is a Riemann surface orbifold of finite type.\n\nThe unit ball ''B''<sup>3</sup> with its conformal structure is the [[Poincaré half-plane model|Poincaré model]] of [[hyperbolic 3-space]]. When we think of it metrically, with metric \n:<math>ds^2= \\frac{4 \\left| dx \\right|^2 }{\\left( 1-|x|^2 \\right)^2}</math>\nit is a model of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space '''H'''<sup>3</sup>. The set of conformal self-maps of ''B''<sup>3</sup> becomes the set of [[isometries]] (i.e. distance-preserving maps) of '''H'''<sup>3</sup> under this identification. Such maps restrict to conformal self-maps of <math>S^2_\\infty</math>, which are [[Möbius transformation]]s. There are isomorphisms\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Mob}(S^2_\\infty) \\cong \\operatorname{Conf}(B^3) \\cong \\operatorname{Isom}(\\mathbf{H}^3).</math>\n\nThe [[subgroup]]s of these groups consisting of [[orientation-preserving]] transformations are all isomorphic to the projective matrix group: PSL(2,'''C''') via the usual identification of the [[unit sphere]] with the [[complex projective line]] '''P'''<sup>1</sup>('''C''').\n===Variations===\n\nThere are some variations of the definition of a Kleinian group: sometimes \nKleinian groups are allowed to be subgroups of PSL(2, '''C''').2 (PSL(2, '''C''') extended by complex conjugations), in other words to have orientation reversing elements, and  sometimes they are assumed to be [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]], and sometimes they are required to act properly discontinuously on a non-empty open subset of the Riemann sphere.\n\n==Types==\n\n*A Kleinian group is said to be of '''finite type''' if its region of discontinuity has a finite number of orbits of components under the group action, and the quotient of each component by its stabilizer is a compact Riemann surface with finitely many points removed, and the covering is ramified at finitely many points.\n*A Kleinian group is called '''finitely generated''' if it has a finite number of generators. The [[Ahlfors finiteness theorem]] says that such a group is of finite type.\n*A Kleinian group Γ has '''finite covolume''' if '''H'''<sup>3</sup>/Γ has finite volume. Any Kleinian group of finite covolume is finitely generated.\n*A Kleinian group is called '''[[geometrically finite]]''' if it has a fundamental polyhedron (in hyperbolic 3-space) with finitely many sides. Ahlfors showed that if the limit set is not the whole Riemann sphere then it has measure 0.\n*A Kleinian group Γ is called '''arithmetic''' if it is commensurable with the group norm 1 elements of an order of  quaternion algebra ''A'' ramified at all real places  over a number field ''k'' with exactly one complex place. Arithmetic Kleinian groups have finite covolume.\n*A Kleinian group Γ is called '''cocompact''' if '''H'''<sup>3</sup>/Γ is compact, or equivalently SL(2, '''C''')/Γ is compact. Cocompact Kleinian groups have finite covolume.\n*A Kleinian group is called '''topologically tame''' if it is finitely generated and its hyperbolic manifold is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary.\n*A Kleinian group is called '''geometrically tame''' if its ends are either geometrically finite or simply degenerate {{harv|Thurston|1980}}.\n*A Kleinian group is said to be of '''type 1''' if the limit set is the whole Riemann sphere, and of '''type 2''' otherwise.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Bianchi groups===\nA [[Bianchi group]]  is a Kleinian group of the form PSL(2, ''O''<sub>''d''</sub>), where <math>\\mathcal{O}_d</math> is the ring of integers of the [[imaginary quadratic field]] <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})</math> for d a positive [[square-free integer]].\n\n===Elementary and reducible Kleinian groups===\nA Kleinian group is called elementary if its limit set is finite, in which case the limit set has 0, 1, or 2 points. \nExamples of elementary Kleinian groups include finite Kleinian groups (with empty limit set) and infinite cyclic Kleinian groups.\n\nA Kleinian group is called reducible if all elements have a common fixed point on the Riemann sphere. Reducible Kleinian groups are elementary, but some elementary finite  Kleinian groups are not reducible.\n\n===Fuchsian groups===\nAny [[Fuchsian group]] (a discrete subgroup of SL(2, '''R''')) is a Kleinian group, and conversely any Kleinian group preserving the real line (in its action on the Riemann sphere) is a Fuchsian group. More generally, every Kleinian group preserving a circle or straight line in the Riemann sphere is conjugate to a Fuchsian group.\n\n===Koebe groups===\n*A '''factor''' of a Kleinian group ''G'' is a subgroup ''H'' maximal subject to the following properties:\n**''H'' has a simply connected invariant component ''D''\n**A conjugate of an element ''h'' of ''H'' by a conformal bijection is parabolic or elliptic if and only if ''h'' is.\n**Any parabolic element of ''G'' fixing a boundary point of ''D'' is in ''H''.\n*A Kleinian group is called a '''Koebe group''' if all its factors are elementary or Fuchsian.\n\n===Quasi-Fuchsian groups===\n[[Image:Kleinian group limit set on sphere.svg|thumb|right|Limit set of a quasifuchsian group]]\nA Kleinian group that preserves a [[Jordan curve]] is called a '''[[quasi-Fuchsian group]]'''. When the Jordan curve is a circle or a straight line these are just conjugate to Fuchsian groups under conformal transformations. Finitely generated quasi-Fuchsian groups are conjugate to Fuchsian groups under quasi-conformal transformations. The limit set is contained in the invariant Jordan curve, and it is equal to the Jordan curve the group is said to be of '''type one''', and otherwise it is said to be of '''type 2'''.\n\n===Schottky groups===\nLet ''C''<sub>i</sub> be the boundary circles of a finite collection of disjoint closed disks. The group generated by [[Circle inversion|inversion]] in each circle has limit set  a [[Cantor set]], and the quotient '''H'''<sup>3</sup>/''G'' is a [[mirror orbifold]] with underlying space a ball. It is [[Double cover (topology)|double covered]] by a [[handlebody]]; the corresponding [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 subgroup is a Kleinian group called a [[Schottky group]].\n\n===Crystallographic groups===\nLet ''T'' be a [[Frequency|periodic]] [[tessellation]] of hyperbolic 3-space. The group of symmetries of the tessellation is a Kleinian group.\n\n===Fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds===\nThe fundamental group of any oriented hyperbolic 3-manifold is a Kleinian group. There are many examples of these, such as the complement of a figure 8 knot or the [[Seifert–Weber space]]. Conversely if a Kleinian group has no nontrivial torsion elements then it is the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.\n\n===Degenerate Kleinian groups===\nA Kleinian group is called degenerate if it is not elementary and its limit set is simply connected. Such groups can be constructed by taking a suitable limit of quasi-Fuchsian groups such that one of the two components of the regular points contracts down to the empty set; these groups are called '''singly degenerate'''. If both components of the regular set contract down to the empty set, then the limit set becomes a space-filling curve and the group is called '''doubly degenerate'''. \nThe existence of degenerate Kleinian groups was first shown indirectly by {{harvtxt|Bers|1970}}, and the first explicit example was found by Jørgensen. {{harvtxt|Cannon|Thurston|2007}} gave examples of doubly degenerate groups and space-filling curves associated to [[pseudo-Anosov map]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ahlfors measure conjecture]]\n*[[Density theorem for Kleinian groups]]\n*[[Ending lamination theorem]]\n*[[Tameness theorem]] (Marden's conjecture)\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Bers | first1=Lipman | authorlink = Lipman Bers | title=On boundaries of Teichmüller spaces and on Kleinian groups.

(The coloring and edges are only for visual aid.)]]\n\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n\nIn [[Lie theory]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''lattice''' in a [[locally compact group]] is a [[discrete subgroup]] with the property that the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] has finite [[invariant measure]]. In the special case of subgroups of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, this amounts to the usual [[Lattice (group)|geometric notion of a lattice]] as a periodic subset of points, and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the space of all lattices are relatively well understood.\n\nThe theory is particularly rich for lattices in semisimple Lie groups or more generally in [[semisimple algebraic group]]s over [[local field]]s. In particular there is a wealth of rigidity results in this setting, and a celebrated theorem of [[Grigori Margulis]] states that in most cases all lattices are obtained as [[arithmetic group]]s.\n\nLattices are also well-studied in some other classes of groups, in particular groups associated to [[Kac-Moody algebra]]s and automorphisms groups of regular [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] (the latter are known as ''tree lattices'').\n\nLattices are of interest in many areas of mathematics: [[geometric group theory]] (as particularly nice examples of [[discrete group]]s), in [[differential geometry]] (through the construction of locally homogeneous manifolds), in number theory (through [[arithmetic group]]s), in [[ergodic theory]] (through the study of homogeneous [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] on the quotient spaces) and in [[combinatorics]] (through the construction of [[Expander graph|expanding]] [[Cayley graph]]s and other combinatorial objects).\n\n== Generalities on lattices ==\n\n=== Informal discussion ===\n\nLattices are best thought of as discrete approximations of continuous groups (such as Lie groups). For example, it is intuitively clear that the subgroup <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math> of integer vectors \"looks like\" the real vector space <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> in some sense, while both groups are essentially different: one is [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and [[countable]], while the other is not (as a group) and has the [[cardinality of the continuum]].\n\nRigorously defining the meaning of \"approximation of a continuous group by a discrete subgroup\" in the previous paragraph in order to get a notion generalising the example <math>\\mathbb Z^n \\subset \\mathbb R^n</math> is a matter of what it is designed to achieve. Maybe the most obvious idea is to say that a subgroup \"approximates\" a larger group is that the larger group can be covered by the translates of a \"small\" subset by all elements in the subgroups. In a locally compact topological group there are two immediately available notions of \"small\": topological (a [[Compact set|compact]], or [[relatively compact subset]]) or measure-theoretical (a subset of finite Haar measure). Note that since the Haar measure is a [[Borel measure]], in particular gives finite mass to compact subsets, the second definition is more general. The definition of a lattice used in mathematics relies upon the second meaning (in particular to include such examples as <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z) \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math>) but the first also has its own interest (such lattices are called uniform).\n\n=== Definition ===\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a locally compact group and <math>\\Gamma</math> a discrete subgroup (this means that there exists a neighbourhood <math>U</math> of the identity element <math>e_G</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>\\Gamma \\cap U = \\{ e_G \\}</math>). Then <math>\\Gamma</math> is called a lattice in <math>G</math> if in addition there exists a [[Borel measure]] <math>\\mu</math> on the quotient space <math>G / \\Gamma</math> which is finite (i.e. <math> \\mu(G / \\Gamma) < +\\infty</math>) and <math>G</math>-invariant (meaning that for any <math>g \\in G</math> and any open subset <math> W \\subset G / \\Gamma</math> the equality <math>\\mu(gW) = \\mu(W)</math> is satisifed).\n\nA slightly more sophisticated formulation is as follows: suppose in addition that <math>G</math> is unimodular, then since <math>\\Gamma</math> is discrete it is also unimodular and by general theorems there exists a unique <math>G</math>-invariant Borel measure on <math>G / \\Gamma</math> up to scaling. Then <math>\\Gamma</math> is a lattice if and only if this measure is finite.\n\nIn the case of discrete subgroups this invariant measure coincides locally with the [[Haar measure]] and hence a discrete subgroup in a locally compact group <math>G</math> being a lattice is equivalent to it having a fundamental domain (for the action on <math>G</math> by left-translations) of finite volume for the Haar measure.\n\nA lattice <math>\\Gamma \\subset G</math> is called '''uniform''' when the quotient space <math>G/\\Gamma</math> is compact (and ''non-uniform'' otherwise). Equivalently a discrete subgroup <math>\\Gamma \\subset G</math> is a uniform lattice if and only if there exists a compact subset <math>C \\subset G</math> with <math>G = \\bigcup {}_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\, C\\gamma</math>. Note that if <math>\\Gamma</math> is any discrete subgroup in <math>G</math> such that <math>G/\\Gamma</matH> is compact then <math>\\Gamma</math> is automatically a lattice in <math>G</math>.\n\n=== First examples ===\n\nThe fundamental, and simplest, example is the subgroup <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math> which is a lattice in the Lie group <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. A slightly more complicated example is given by the discrete [[Heisenberg group]] inside the continuous Heisenberg group.\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a discrete group then a lattice in <math>G</math> is exactly a subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> of finite index (i.e. the quotient set <math>G/\\Gamma</math> is finite).\n\nAll of these examples are uniform. A non-uniform example is given by the [[modular group]] <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z)</math> inside <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math>, and also by the higher-dimensional analogues <math>\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb Z) \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb R)</math>.\n\nAny finite-index subgroup of a lattice is also a lattice in the same group. More generally, a subgroup [[commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] to a lattice is a lattice.\n\n=== Which groups have lattices? ===\n\nNot every locally compact group contains a lattice, and there is no general group-theoretical sufficient condition for this. On the other hand, there are plenty of more specific settings where such criteria exist. For example, the existence or non-existence of lattices in [[Lie group]]s is a well-understood topic.\n\nAs we mentioned, a necessary condition for a group to contain a lattice is that the group must be [[Unimodular group|unimodular]]. This allows for the easy construction of groups without lattices, for example the group of invertible [[Upper triangular matrix|upper triangular matrices]] or the [[affine group]]s. It is also not very hard to find unimodular groups without lattices, for example certain nilpotent Lie groups as explained below.\n\nA stronger condition than unimodularity is [[Simple group|simplicity]]. This is sufficient to imply the existence of a lattice in a Lie group, but in the more general setting of locally compact groups there exists simple groups without lattices, for example the \"Neretin groups\".<ref>{{cite journal | ref=BCGM | last1=Bader | first1=Uri | first2=Pierre-Emmanuel | last2=Caprace | first3=Tsachik | last3=Gelander | first4=Shahar | last4=Mozes| title=Simple groups without lattices|  journal=Bull.

All lattices in a nilpotent Lie group are uniform, and if <math>N</math> is a connected [[simply connected]] nilpotent Lie group (equivalently it does not contain a nontrivial compact subgroup) then a discrete subgroup is a lattice if and only if it is not contained in a proper connected subgroup{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 2.1}} (this generalises the fact that a discrete subgroup in a vector space is a lattice if and only if it spans the vector space).\n\nA nilpotent Lie group contains a lattice if and only if it can be defined over the rationals, that is if and only if its [[structure constants]] are rational numbers.{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 2.12}} More precisely, in a nilpotent group satisfying this condition lattices correspond via the exponential map to lattices (in the more elementary sense of [[Lattice (group)]]) in the Lie algebra.\n\nA lattice in a nilpotent Lie group <math>N</math> is always [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] (and hence [[Finitely presented group|finitely presented]] since it is itself nilpotent); in fact it is generated by at most <math>\\dim(N)</math> elements.{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 2.21}}\n\nFinally, a nilpotent group is isomorphic to a lattice in a nilpotent Lie group if and only if it contains a subgroup of finite index which is torsion-free and of finitely generated.\n\n=== The general case ===\n\nThe criterion for nilpotent Lie groups to have a lattice given above does not apply to more general solvable Lie groups. It remains true that any lattice in a solvable Lie group is uniform{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 3.1}} and that lattices in solvable groups are finitely presented.\n\nNot all finitely generated solvable groups are lattices in a Lie group. An algebraic criterion is that the group be [[Polycyclic group|polycyclic]].{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 4.28}}\n\n== Lattices in semisimple Lie groups ==\n\n=== Arithmetic groups and existence of lattices ===\n{{Main | Arithmetic group}}\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a semisimple [[linear algebraic group]] in <math>\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb R)</math> which is defined over the field <math>\\mathbb Q</math> of [[rational number]]s (i.e. the polynomial equations defining <math>G</math> have their coefficients in <math>\\mathbb Q</math>) then it has a subgroup <math>\\Gamma = G \\cap \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb Z)</math>. A fundamental theorem of [[Armand Borel]] and [[Harish-Chandra]] states that <math>\\Gamma</math> is always a lattice in <math>G</math>; the simplest example of this is the subgroup <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z) \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math>.\n\nGeneralising the construction above one gets the notion of an ''arithmetic lattice'' in a semisimple Lie group. Since all semisimple Lie groups can be defined over <math>\\mathbb Q</math> a consequence of the arithmetic construction is that any semisimple Lie group contains a lattice.\n\n=== Irreducibility ===\n\nWhen the Lie group <math>G</math> splits as a product <math>G = G_1 \\times G_2</math> there is an obvious construction of lattices in <math>G</math> from the smaller groups: if <math>\\Gamma_1 \\subset G_1, \\Gamma_2 \\subset G_2</math> are lattices then <math>\\Gamma_1 \\times \\Gamma_2 \\subset G</math> is a lattice as well. Roughly, a lattice is then said to be ''irreducible'' if it does not come from this construction.\n\nMore formally, if <math>G = G_1 \\times \\ldots \\times G_r</math> is the decomposition of <math>G</math> into simple factors, a lattice <math>\\Gamma \\subset G</math> is said to be irreducible if either of the following equivalent conditions hold: \n*The projection of <math>\\Gamma</math> to any factor <math>G_{i_1} \\times \\ldots \\times G_{i_k}</math> is dense;\n*The intersection of <math>\\Gamma</math> with any factor <math>G_{i_1} \\times \\ldots \\times G_{i_k}</math> is not a lattice.\n\nAn example of an irreducible lattice is given by the subgroup <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z[\\sqrt 2])</math> which we view as a subgroup <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R) \\times \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math> via the map <math>g \\mapsto (g, \\sigma(g))</math> where <math>\\sigma</math> is the Galois map sending a matric with coefficients <math>a_i+b_i\\sqrt 2</math> to <matH>a_i - b_i \\sqrt 2</math>.\n\n=== Rank 1 versus higher rank ===\n\nThe [[Algebraic torus#Flat subspaces and rank of symmetric spaces|real rank]] of a Lie group is the maximal dimension of an abelian subgroup containing only [[Semi-simple operator|semisimple]] elements. The semisimple Lie groups of real rank 1 without compact factors are (up to [[isogeny]]) those in the following list (see [[List of simple Lie groups]]):\n\n*The [[orthogonal group]]s <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n,1)</math> of [[Quadratic form#Real quadratic form|real quadratic form]]s of signature <math>(n, 1)</math> for <math>n \\ge 2</math>;\n*The [[unitary group]]s <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n,1)</math> of [[Sesquilinear form#Hermitian form|Hermitian form]]s of signature <math>(n, 1)</math> for <math>n \\ge 2</math>;\n*The groups <math>\\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)</math> (groups of matrices with [[quaternion]] coefficients which preserve a \"quaternionic quadratic form\" of signature <math>(n, 1)</math>) for <math>n \\ge 2</math>;\n*The [[exceptional Lie group]] <math>F_4^{-20}</math> (the real form of rank 1 corresponding to the exceptional Lie algebra <math>F_4</math>).\n\nThe real rank of a Lie group has a significant influence on the behaviour of the lattices it contains. In particular the behaviour of lattices in the first two families of groups (and to a lesser extent that of lattices in the latter two) differs much from that of irreducible lattices in groups of higher rank.

The fundamental result when studying lattices is the following:{{sfn|Witte-Morris|2015|loc=Proposition 13.17}}\n\n:''A lattice in a locally compact group has property (T) if and only if the group itself has property (T). ''\n\nUsing [[harmonic analysis]] it is possible to classify semisimple Lie groups according to whether or not they have the property. As a consequence we get the following result, further illustrating the dichotomy of the previous section:\n\n*Lattices in <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n,1), \\mathrm{SU}(n,1)</math> do not have Kazhdan's property (T) while irreducible lattices in all other simple Lie groups do;\n\n=== Finiteness properties ===\n\nLattices in semisimple Lie groups are always finitely presented. For uniform lattices this is a direct consequence of cocompactness. In the non-uniform case this can be proved using reduction theory.{{sfn|Witte-Morris|2015|loc=Chapter 19}} However a much faster proof is by using [[Kazhdan's property (T)]] when possible.\n\n== Riemannian manifolds associated to lattices in Lie groups ==\n\n=== Left-invariant metrics ===\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a Lie group then from an [[inner product]] <math>g_e</math> on the tangent space <math>\\mathfrak g</math> (the Lie algebra of <math>G</math>) one can construct a [[Riemannian metric]] on <math>G</math> as follows: if <math>v, w</math> belong to the tangent space at a point <math>\\gamma \\in G</math> put <math>g_\\gamma(v, w) = g_e(\\gamma^*v, \\gamma^*w)</math> where <math>\\gamma^*</math> indicates the [[tangent map]] (at <math>\\gamma</math>) of the diffeomorphism <math>x \\mapsto \\gamma^{-1}x</math> of <math>G</math>.\n\nThe maps <math>x \\mapsto \\gamma x </math> for <math>\\gamma \\in G</math> are by definition isometries for this metric <math>g</math>. In particular, if <math>\\Gamma</math> is any discrete subgroup in <math>G</math> (so that it acts [[Free action|freely]] and [[Properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]] by left-translations on <math>G</math>) the quotient <math>\\Gamma \\backslash G</math> is a Riemannian manifold locally isometric to <math>G</math> with the metric <math>g</math>.\n\nThe [[Riemannian volume form]] associated to <math>g</Math> defines a Haar measure on <math>G</math> and we see that the quotient manifold is of finite Riemannian volume if and only if <math>\\Gamma</math> is a lattice.\n\nInteresting examples in this class of Riemannian spaces include compact [[flat manifold]]s and [[nilmanifold]]s.\n\n=== Locally symmetric spaces ===\n{{Main | Symmetric space}}\n\nA natural inner product on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is given by the [[Killing form]]. If <math>G</math> is not compact it is not definite and hence not an inner product: however when <math>G</math> is semisimple and <math>K</math> is a maximal compact subgroup it can be used to define a <math>G</math>-invariant metric on the [[homogeneous space]] <math>X = G/K</math>: such Riemannian manifolds are called [[symmetric spaces]] of non-compact type without Euclidean factors.\n\nA subgroup <math>\\Gamma \\subset G</math> acts freely, properly discontinuously on <math>X</math> if and only if it is discrete and torsion-free. The quotients <math>\\Gamma \\backslash X</math> are called locally symmetric spaces. There is thus a bijective correspondence between complete locally symmetric spaces locally isomorphic to <math>X</math> and of finite Riemannian volume, and torsion-free lattices in <math>G</math>. This correspondence can be extended to all lattices by adding [[orbifold]]s on the geometric side.\n\n== Lattices in p-adic Lie groups ==\n\nA class of groups with similar properties (with respect to lattices) to real semisimple Lie groups are semisimple algebraic groups over local fields of characteristic 0, for example the [[p-adic field]]s <math>\\mathbb Q_p</math>. There is an arithmetic construction similar to the real case, and the dichotomy between higher rank and rank one also holds in this case, in a more marked form. Let <math>G</math> be an algebraic group over <math>\\mathbb Q_p</math> of split-<math>\\mathbb Q_p</math>-rank ''r''. Then:\n\n*If ''r'' is at least 2 all irreducible lattices in <math>G</math> are arithmetic;\n*if ''r=1'' then there are uncountably many commensurability classes of non-arithmetic lattices.<ref>{{cite journal | ref=LubGAFA | last=Lubotzky | first=Alexander | title=Lattices in rank one Lie groups over local fields | journal=Geom.

Usually <math>p=\\infty</math> is allowed, in which case <math>G_\\infty</math> is a real Lie group. An example of such a lattice is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{SL}_2 \\left( \\mathbb Z \\left[\\frac 1 p \\right] \\right) \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R) \\times \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb Q_p)</math>.\n\nThis arithmetic construction can be generalised to obtain the notion of an ''S-arithmetic group''. The Margulis arithmeticity theorem applies to this setting as well. In particular, if at least two of the factors <math>G_p</math> are noncompact then any irreducible lattice in <math>G</math> is S-arithmetic.\n\n=== Lattices in adelic groups ===\n\nIf <math>\\mathrm G</math> is a semisimple algebraic group over a [[number field]] <math>F</math> and <math>\\mathbb A</math> its [[Ring of adeles|adèle ring]] then the group <math>G = \\mathrm G(\\mathbb A)</math> of adélic points is well-defined (modulo some technicalities) and it is a locally compact group which naturally contains the group <math>\\mathrm G(F)</math> of <math>F</math>-rational point as a discrete subgroup. The Borel&ndash;Harish-Chandra theorem extends to this setting, and <math>\\mathrm G(F) \\subset \\mathrm G(\\mathbb A)</math> is a lattice.<ref>{{cite book | ref=Weil | last=Weil | first=André | title=Adeles and algebraic groups.

Demazure and Takashi Ono | series=Progress in Mathematics | volume=23 | publisher=Birkhäuser | year=1982 | pages=iii+126 | isbn=3-7643-3092-9 | mr=0670072}}</ref>\n\nThe [[strong approximation theorem]] relates the quotient <math>\\mathrm G(F) \\backslash \\mathrm G(\\mathbb A)</math> to more classical S-arithmetic quotients. This fact makes the adèle groups very effective as tools in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s. In particular modern forms of the [[Arthur-Selberg trace formula|trace formula]] are usually stated and proven for adélic groups rather than for Lie groups.\n\n== Rigidity ==\n\n=== Rigidity results ===\n\nAnother group of phenomena concerning lattices in semisimple algebraic groups is collectively known as ''rigidity''. Here are three classical examples of results in this category.\n\n[[Local rigidity]] results state that in most situations every subgroup which is sufficiently \"close\" to a lattice (in the intuitive sense, formalised by [[Chabauty topology]]) is actually conjugated to the original lattice by an element of the ambient Lie group. A consequence of local rigidity and the [[Kazhdan-Margulis theorem]] is Wang's theorem: in a given group (with a fixed Haar measure), for any ''v>0'' there are only finitely many (up to conjugation) lattices with covolume bounded by ''v''.\n\nThe [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] states that for lattices in simple Lie groups not locally isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math> (the group of 2 by 2 matrices with determinant 1) any isomorphism of lattices is essentially induced by an isomorphism between the groups themselves. In particular, a lattice in a Lie group \"remembers\" the ambient Lie group through its group structure. The first statement is sometimes called ''strong rigidity'' and is due to [[George Mostow]] and [[Gopal Prasad]] (Mostow proved it for cocompact lattices and Prasad extended it to the general case).\n\n''[[Superrigidity]]'' provides (for Lie groups and algebraic groups over local fields of higher rank) a generalization dealing with homomorphisms from a lattice in an algebraic group ''G'' into another algebraic group ''H''. It was proven by Grigori Margulis and is an essential ingredient in the proof of his arithmeticity theorem.\n\n=== Nonrigidity in low dimensions ===\n\nThe only groups for which Mostow rigidity does not hold are all groups locally isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math>. In this case there are in fact continuously many lattices and they give rise to [[Teichmüller space]]s.\n\nNonuniform lattices in the group <math>\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb C)</math> are not locally rigid. In fact they are accumulation points (in the Chabauty topology) of lattices of smaller covolume, as demonstrated by [[hyperbolic Dehn surgery]].\n\nAs lattices in rank-one p-adic groups are virtually free groups they are very non-rigid.\n\n== Tree lattices ==\n\n=== Definition ===\n\nLet <math>T</math> be a tree with a cocompact group of automorphisms; for example, <math>T</math> can be a [[Regular graph|regular]] or [[Biregular graph|biregular]] tree. The group of automorphisms<math>\\mathrm{Aut}(T)</math> of <math>T</math> is a locally compact group (when endowed with the [[compact-open topology]], in which a basis of neighbourhoods of the identity is given by the stabilsers of finite subtrees, which are compact). Any group which is a lattice in some <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(T)</math> is then called a ''tree lattice''.\n\nThe discreteness in this case is easy to see from the group action on the tree: a subgroup of <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(T)</math> is discrete if and only if all vertex stabilisers are finite groups.\n\nIt is easily seen from the basic theory of group actions on trees that uniform tree lattices are virtually free groups. Thus the more interesting tree lattices are the non-uniform ones, equivalently those for which the quotient graph <math>\\Gamma \\backslash T</math> is infinite. The existence of such lattices is not easy to see.\n\n=== Tree lattices from algebraic groups ===\n\nIf <math>F</math> is a local field of positive characteristic (i.e. a completion of a [[Function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of a curve over a finite field, for example the field of formal [[Laurent polynomial|Laurent]] [[power serie]]s <math>\\mathbb F_p((t))</math>) and <math>G</math> an algebraic group defined over <math>F</math> of <math>F</math>-split rank one, then any lattice in <math>G</math> is a tree lattice through its action on the [[Bruhat-Tits building]] which in this case is a tree. In contrast to the characteristic 0 case such lattices can be nonuniform, and in this case they are never finitely generated.\n\n=== Tree lattices from Bass-Serre theory ===\n{{Main | Bass-Serre theory}}\n\nIf <math>\\Gamma</math> is the fundamental group of an infinite [[graph of groups]], all of whose vertex groups are finite, and under additional necessary assumptions on the index of the edge groups and the size of the vertex groups, then the action of <math>\\Gamma</math> on the Bass-Serre tree associated to the graph of groups realises it as a tree lattice.\n\n=== Existence criterion ===\n\nMore generally one can ask the following question: if <math>H</math> is a closed subgroup of <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(T)</math>, under which conditions does <math>H</mat>H</matH> contain a lattice? The existence of a uniform lattice is equivalent to <math>H</math> being unimodular and the quotient <math>H \\backslash T</math> being finite. The general existence theorem is more subtle: it is necessary and sufficient that <math>H</math> be unimodular, and that the quotient <math>H \\backslash T</math> be of \"finite volume\" in a suitable sense (which can be expressed combinatorially in terms of the action of <math>H</math>), more general than the stronger condition that the quotient be finite (as proven by the very existence of nonuniform tree lattices).\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | first1=Hyman | last1=Bass | first2=Alexander | last2=Lubotzky | title=Tree lattices With appendices by H.

In other words, for any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the subgroup of all [[linear combination]]s with [[integer]] coefficients of the basis vectors forms a lattice. A lattice may be viewed as a [[regular tiling]] of a space by a [[primitive cell]].\n\nLattices have many significant applications in pure mathematics, particularly in connection to [[Lie algebra]]s, [[number theory]] and group theory. They also arise in applied mathematics in connection with [[coding theory]], in [[cryptography]] because of conjectured computational hardness of several [[lattice problems]], and are used in various ways in the physical sciences. For instance, in [[materials science]] and [[solid-state physics]], a lattice is a synonym for the \"frame work\" of a [[crystalline structure]], a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding in special cases with the [[atom]] or [[molecule]] positions in a [[crystal]]. More generally, [[lattice model (physics)|lattice models]] are studied in [[physics]], often by the techniques of [[computational physics]].\n\n==Symmetry considerations and examples==\nA lattice is the [[symmetry group]] of discrete [[translational symmetry]] in ''n'' directions. A pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. As a group (dropping its geometric structure) a lattice is a [[Finitely-generated abelian group|finitely-generated]] [[free abelian group]], and thus isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}^n</math>.\n\nA lattice in the sense of a 3-[[dimension]]al array of regularly spaced points coinciding with e.g. the [[atom]] or [[molecule]] positions in a [[crystal]], or more generally, the orbit of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] under translational symmetry, is a translate of the translation lattice: a [[coset]], which need not contain the origin, and therefore need not be a lattice in the previous sense.\n\nA simple example of a lattice in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is the subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}^n</math>. More complicated examples include the [[E8 lattice]], which is a lattice in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{8}</math>, and the [[Leech lattice]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{24}</math>.   The [[period lattice]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> is central to the study of [[elliptic functions]], developed in nineteenth century mathematics; it generalises to higher dimensions in the theory of [[abelian function]]s.  Lattices called [[root lattice]]s are important in the theory of [[simple Lie algebra]]s; for example, the E8 lattice is related to a Lie algebra that goes by the same name.\n\n==Dividing space according to a lattice==\nA typical lattice <math>\\Lambda</math> in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> thus has the form\n:<math>\n\\Lambda = \\left\\{\\left. \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i v_i \\; \\right\\vert \\; a_i \\in\\mathbb{Z} \\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere {''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>} is a basis for <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. Different bases can generate the same lattice, but the [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] of the vectors ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> is uniquely determined by Λ, and is denoted by d(Λ).\nIf one thinks of a lattice as dividing the whole of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> into equal [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] (copies of an ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]], known as the ''[[fundamental region]]'' of the lattice), then d(Λ) is equal to the ''n''-dimensional [[volume]] of this polyhedron.  This is why d(Λ) is sometimes called the '''covolume''' of the lattice.  If this equals 1, the lattice is called [[unimodular lattice|unimodular]].\n\n==Lattice points in convex sets==\n[[Minkowski's theorem]] relates the number d(Λ) and the volume of a symmetric [[convex set]] ''S'' to the number of lattice points contained in ''S''. The number of lattice points contained in a [[polytope]] all of whose vertices are elements of the lattice is described by the polytope's [[Ehrhart polynomial]]. Formulas for some of the coefficients of this polynomial involve d(Λ) as well.\n\n{{see also|Integer points in polyhedra}}\n\n==Computational lattice problems==\n{{Main|Lattice problem}}\n[[lattice problems|Computational lattice problems]] have many applications in computer science. For example, the [[Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm]] (LLL) has been used in the [[cryptanalysis]] of many [[Public-key cryptography|public-key encryption]] schemes,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nguyen|first=Phong|last2=Stern|first2=Jacques|date=2001|title=The Two Faces of Lattices in Cryptology|journal=Cryptography and Lattices|volume=2146|pages=146–180|doi=10.1007/3-540-44670-2_12|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-42488-8}}</ref> and many [[Lattice-based cryptography|lattice-based cryptographic schemes]] are known to be secure under the assumption that certain lattice problems are [[Computational hardness assumption|computationally difficult]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Regev|first=Oded|date=2005-01-01|title=On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography|journal=Proceedings of the Thirty-seventh Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|series=STOC '05|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=84–93|doi=10.1145/1060590.1060603|isbn=978-1581139600|citeseerx=10.1.1.110.4776}}</ref>\n\n==Lattices in two dimensions: detailed discussion==\n[[File:2d-bravais.svg|thumb|Five lattices in the Euclidean plane]]\nThere are five 2D lattice types as given by the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]]. Below, the [[wallpaper group]] of the lattice is given in [[IUC notation]], [[Orbifold notation]], and [[Coxeter notation]], along with a wallpaper diagram showing the symmetry domains. Note that a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. A [[List of planar symmetry groups#Wallpaper groups|full list of subgroups]] is available. For example below the hexagonal/triangular lattice is given twice, with full 6-fold and a half 3-fold reflectional symmetry. If the symmetry group of a pattern contains an ''n''-fold rotation then the lattice has ''n''-fold symmetry for even ''n'' and 2''n''-fold for odd ''n''.\n{| class=wikitable width=780\n|-\n!cmm, (2*22), [&infin;,2<sup>+</sup>,&infin;]\n!p4m, (*442), [4,4]\n!p6m, (*632), [6,3]\n|- valign=top align=center\n|[[File:Rhombic Lattice.svg|150px]][[File:Wallpaper group diagram cmm.svg|100px]]<BR>'''[[rhombus|rhombic]] lattice'''<BR>also '''centered rectangular lattice'''<BR>''isosceles triangular''\n|[[File:SquareLattice.svg|150px]][[File:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|75px]]<BR>'''[[square lattice]]'''<BR>''right isosceles triangular''\n|[[File:Equilateral Triangle Lattice.svg|150px]][[File:Wallpaper group diagram p6m.svg|100px]]<BR>'''[[hexagonal lattice]]'''<BR>(equilateral triangular lattice)\n|-\n!pmm, *2222, [&infin;,2,&infin;]\n!p2, 2222, [&infin;,2,&infin;]<sup>+</sup>\n!p3m1, (*333), [3<sup>[3]</sup>]\n|- valign=top align=center\n|[[File:Rectangular Lattice.svg|150px]][[File:Wallpaper group diagram pmm.svg|100px]]<BR>'''[[rectangle|rectangular]] lattice'''<BR>also '''centered rhombic lattice'''<BR>''right triangular''\n|[[File:Oblique Lattice.svg|150px]][[File:Wallpaper group diagram p2.svg|100px]]<BR>'''[[parallelogram]]mic lattice'''<BR>also '''oblique lattice'''<BR>''scalene triangular''\n|[[File:Equilateral Triangle Lattice.svg|150px]][[File:Wallpaper group diagram p3m1.svg|100px]]<BR>'''equilateral [[triangle|triangular]] lattice'''<BR>(hexagonal lattice)\n|}\n\nFor the classification of a given lattice, start with one point and take a nearest second point. For the third point, not on the same line, consider its distances to both points. Among the points for which the smaller of these two distances is least, choose a point for which the larger of the two is least. (Not [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] but in the case of lattices giving the same result is just \"Choose a point for which the larger of the two is least\".)\n\nThe five cases correspond to the [[triangle]] being equilateral, right isosceles, right, isosceles, and scalene. In a rhombic lattice, the shortest distance may either be a diagonal or a side of the rhombus, i.e., the line segment connecting the first two points may or may not be one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle. This depends on the smaller angle of the rhombus being less than 60° or between 60° and 90°.\n\nThe general case is known as a [[period lattice]]. If the vectors '''p''' and '''q''' generate the lattice, instead of '''p''' and '''q''' we can also take '''p''' and '''p'''-'''q''', etc. In general in 2D, we can take ''a'' '''p''' + ''b'' '''q''' and ''c'' '''p''' + ''d'' '''q''' for integers ''a'',''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' such that ''ad-bc'' is 1 or -1. This ensures that '''p''' and '''q''' themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors.  Each pair '''p''', '''q''' defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the [[cross product]]. One parallelogram fully defines the whole  object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a [[fundamental pair of periods|fundamental parallelogram]].\n\n[[File:ModularGroup-FundamentalDomain.svg|thumb|right|The [[fundamental domain]] of the [[period lattice]].]]\nThe vectors '''p''' and '''q''' can be represented by complex numbers. Up to size and orientation, a pair can be represented by their quotient. Expressed geometrically: if two lattice points are 0 and 1, we consider the position of a third lattice point. Equivalence in the sense of generating the same lattice is represented by the [[modular group]]: <math>T: z\\mapsto z+1</math> represents choosing a different third point in the same grid, <math>S: z\\mapsto -1/z</math> represents choosing a different side of the triangle as reference side 0-1, which in general implies changing the scaling of the lattice, and rotating it. Each \"curved triangle\" in the image contains for each 2D lattice shape one complex number, the grey area is a canonical representation, corresponding to the classification above, with 0 and 1 two lattice points that are closest to each other; duplication is avoided by including only half of the boundary. The rhombic lattices are represented by the points on its boundary, with the hexagonal lattice as vertex, and ''i'' for the square lattice. The rectangular lattices are at the imaginary axis, and the remaining area represents the parallelogrammetic lattices, with the mirror image of a parallelogram represented by the mirror image in the imaginary axis.\n\n==Lattices in three dimensions==\n{{main|Bravais lattice}}\nThe 14 lattice types in 3D are called '''Bravais lattices'''. They are characterized by their [[space group]]. 3D patterns with translational symmetry of a particular type cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself.\n\n==Lattices in complex space==\nA lattice in <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> is a discrete subgroup of <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> which spans the 2''n''-dimensional real vector space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>.\nFor example, the [[Gaussian integer]]s form a lattice in <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>.\n\nEvery lattice in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is a [[free abelian group]] of [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] ''n''; every lattice in <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> is a free abelian group of rank 2''n''.\n\n==In Lie groups==\n{{Main|Lattice (discrete subgroup)}}\nMore generally, a '''lattice''' Γ in a [[Lie group]] ''G'' is a [[discrete subgroup]], such that the [[Quotient group|quotient]] ''G''/Γ is of finite measure, for the measure on it inherited from [[Haar measure]] on ''G'' (left-invariant, or right-invariant—the definition is independent of that choice). That will certainly be the case when ''G''/Γ is [[compact space|compact]], but that sufficient condition is not necessary, as is shown by the case of the [[modular group]] in [[SL2(R)|''SL''<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]], which is a lattice but where the quotient isn't compact (it has ''cusps''). There are general results stating the existence of lattices in Lie groups.\n\nA lattice is said to be '''uniform''' or '''cocompact''' if ''G''/Γ is compact; otherwise the lattice is called '''non-uniform'''.\n\n==Lattices in general vector-spaces==\nWhile we normally consider <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> lattices in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> this concept can be generalized to any finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over any [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. This can be done as follows:\n\nLet ''K'' be a [[field (mathematics)|field]], let ''V'' be an ''n''-dimensional ''K''-[[vector space]], let <math>B = \\{\\mathbf{v}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_n\\}</math> be a ''K''-[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' and let ''R'' be a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] contained within ''K''. Then the ''R'' lattice <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> in ''V'' generated by ''B'' is given by:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L} = \\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\mathbf{v}_i \\quad | \\quad a_i \\in R, \\mathbf{v}_i \\in B \\right\\}.</math>\n\nIn general, different bases ''B'' will generate different lattices. However, if the [[Change of basis#General case|transition matrix]] ''T'' between the bases is in <math>GL_n(R)</math> - the [[general linear group]] of R (in simple terms this means that all the entries of ''T'' are in ''R'' and all the entries of <math>T^{-1}</math> are in ''R'' - which is equivalent to saying that the [[determinant]] of ''T'' is in <math>R^*</math> - the [[unit group]] of elements in ''R'' with multiplicative inverses) then the lattices generated by these bases will be isomorphic since ''T'' induces an [[isomorphism]] between the two lattices.\n\nImportant cases of such lattices occur in number theory with ''K'' a [[p-adic field]] and ''R'' the [[p-adic integer]]s.\n\nFor a vector space which is also an [[inner product space]], the [[dual lattice]] can be concretely described by the set:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}^* = \\{ \\mathbf{v} \\in V \\quad | \\quad \\langle \\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{x} \\rangle \\in R, \\forall \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{L} \\}</math>\n\nor equivalently as,\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}^* = \\{ \\mathbf{v} \\in V \\quad | \\quad \\langle \\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{v}_i \\rangle \\in R \\}.</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lattice (order)]]\n*[[Lattice (module)]]\n*[[Bravais lattice]]\n*[[Reciprocal lattice]]\n*[[Unimodular lattice]]\n*[[Crystal system]]\n*[[Mahler's compactness theorem]]\n*[[Lattice graph]]\n*[[Lattice-based cryptography]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | author1-link=John Horton Conway | last2=Sloane | first2=Neil J.

      "text": "{{short description|Group that is also a differentiable manifold with group operations that are smooth}}\n \n{{Lie groups}}\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n{{confuse|Group of Lie type}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Lie group''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|l|iː}} \"Lee\") is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are smooth. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s.\n\nIn rough terms, a Lie group is a continuous group, that is, one whose elements are described by several real parameters. As such, Lie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry, such as rotational symmetry in three dimensions. Lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics. Lie's original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]], in much the same way that finite groups are used in [[Galois theory]] to model the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Circle as Lie group.svg|right|thumb|The set of all [[complex number]]s with [[absolute value]] 1 (corresponding to points on the [[circle]] of center 0 and radius 1 in the [[complex plane]]) is a Lie group under complex multiplication:  the [[circle group]].]]\nLie groups are [[smoothness|smooth]] [[differentiable manifold]]s and as such can be studied using [[differential calculus]], in contrast with the case of more general [[topological group]]s. One of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the ''global'' object, the group, with its ''local'' or linearized version, which Lie himself called its \"infinitesimal group\" and which has since become known as its [[Lie algebra]].\n\nLie groups play an enormous role in modern [[geometry]], on several different levels. [[Felix Klein]] argued in his [[Erlangen program]] that one can consider various \"geometries\" by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Thus [[Euclidean geometry]] corresponds to the choice of the group [[Euclidean group|E(3)]] of distance-preserving transformations of the Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, [[conformal geometry]] corresponds to enlarging the group to the [[conformal group]], whereas in [[projective geometry]] one is interested in the properties invariant under the [[projective group]]. This idea later led to the notion of a [[G-structure]], where ''G'' is a Lie group of \"local\" symmetries of a manifold.\n\nLie groups (and their associated Lie algebras) play a major role in modern physics, with the Lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system. Here, the [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the Lie group (or of its [[Lie algebra representation|Lie algebra]]) are especially important. Representation theory [[Particle physics and representation theory|is used extensively in particle physics]]. Groups whose representations are of particular importance include [[3D_rotation_group|the rotation group SO(3)]] (or its [[3D_rotation_group#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|double cover SU(2)]]),  [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)#Representations of the SU.283.29 group|the special unitary group SU(3)]] and the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]].\n\nOn a \"global\" level, whenever a Lie group [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on a geometric object, such as a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or a [[symplectic manifold]], this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure. The presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a [[Lie group action]] on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates [[global analysis|analysis]] on the manifold. Linear actions of Lie groups are especially important, and are studied in [[representation theory]].\n\nIn the 1940s&ndash;1950s, [[Ellis Kolchin]], [[Armand Borel]], and [[Claude Chevalley]] realised that many foundational results concerning Lie groups can be developed completely algebraically, giving rise to the theory of [[algebraic group]]s defined over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most [[finite simple group]]s, as well as in [[algebraic geometry]]. The theory of [[automorphic form]]s, an important branch of modern [[number theory]], deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over [[adele ring]]s; [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.\n\n== Definitions and examples ==\nA '''real Lie group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a finite-dimensional real [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|smooth manifold]], in which the group operations of [[multiplication]] and inversion are [[smooth map]]s.  Smoothness of the group multiplication\n\n:<math> \\mu:G\\times G\\to G\\quad \\mu(x,y)=xy</math>\n\nmeans that ''μ'' is a smooth mapping of the [[Manifold#Cartesian products|product manifold]] {{nowrap|''G'' × ''G''}} into ''G''.  These two requirements can be combined to the single requirement that the mapping\n:<math>(x,y)\\mapsto x^{-1}y</math>\nbe a smooth mapping of the product manifold into ''G''.\n\n=== First examples ===\n* The 2×2 [[real number|real]] [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] form a group under multiplication, denoted by {{nowrap|[[general linear group|GL(2, '''R''')]]}} or by GL<sub>2</sub>('''R'''):\n\n:: <math> \\operatorname{GL}(2, \\mathbf{R}) = \\left\\{A=\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{pmatrix}: \\det A=ad-bc \\ne 0\\right\\}. </math>\n\n: This is a four-dimensional [[compact space|noncompact]] real Lie group; it is an open subset of <math>\\mathbb R^4</math>. This group is [[connected space|disconnected]]; it has two connected components corresponding to the positive and negative values of the [[determinant]].\n\n* The [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] matrices form a [[subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}, denoted by {{nowrap|SO(2, '''R''')}}. It is a Lie group in its own right: specifically, a one-dimensional compact connected Lie group which is [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[circle]]. Using the rotation angle <math>\\varphi</math> as a parameter, this group can be [[parametric equations|parametrized]] as follows:\n:: <math> \\operatorname{SO}(2, \\mathbf{R}) =\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\varphi & -\\sin \\varphi \\\\ \\sin \\varphi & \\cos \\varphi \\end{pmatrix}:  \\varphi\\in\\mathbf{R}/2\\pi\\mathbf{Z}\\right\\}. </math>\n\n:Addition of the angles corresponds to multiplication of the elements of {{nowrap|SO(2, '''R''')}}, and taking the opposite angle corresponds to inversion. Thus both multiplication and inversion are differentiable maps.\n\n* The [[Affine group#Matrix representation|affine group of one dimension]] is a two-dimensional matrix Lie group, consisting of <math>2\\times 2</math> real, upper-triangular matrices, with the first diagonal entry being positive and the second diagonal entry being 1. Thus, the group consists of matrices of the form\n::<math> A= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a & b\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right),\\quad a>0,\\, b\\in\\mathbb{R}.</math>\n\n=== Non-example ===\nWe now present an example of a group with an uncountable number of elements that is not a Lie group under a certain topology.

Any [[Closed subgroup theorem|closed subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}} is a Lie group;<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.45</ref> Lie groups of this sort are called '''matrix Lie groups.''' Since most of the interesting examples of Lie groups can be realized as matrix Lie groups, some textbooks restrict attention to this class, including those of Hall<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}</ref> and Rossmann.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2001}}</ref> Restricting attention to matrix Lie groups simplifies the definition of the Lie algebra and the exponential map. The following are standard examples of matrix Lie groups.\n*The [[special linear group]]s over '''R''' and '''C''', {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} and {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''C''')}}, consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with determinant one and entries in '''R''' or '''C'''\n*The [[unitary group]]s and special unitary groups, U(''n'') and SU(''n''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} complex matrices satisfying <math>U^*=U^{-1}</math> (and also <math>\\det(U)=1</math> in the case of SU(''n''))\n*The [[orthogonal group]]s and special orthogonal groups, O(''n'') and SO(''n''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} real matrices satisfying <math>R^\\mathrm{T}=R^{-1}</math> (and also <math>\\det(R)=1</math> in the case of SO(''n''))\nAll of the preceding examples fall under the heading of the [[classical group]]s.\n\n=== Related concepts ===\nA '''[[complex Lie group]]''' is defined in the same way using [[complex manifold]]s rather than real ones (example: {{nowrap|SL(2, '''C''')}}), and similarly, using an alternate [[Complete metric space#Completion|metric completion]] of '''Q''', one can define a '''''p''-adic Lie group''' over the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], a topological group in which each point has a ''p''-adic neighborhood. [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, [[Andrew Gleason|Gleason]], [[Deane Montgomery|Montgomery]] and [[Leo Zippin|Zippin]] showed that if ''G'' is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on ''G'' which turns it into a Lie group (see also [[Hilbert–Smith conjecture]]). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a [[Hilbert manifold]]), then one arrives at the notion of an infinite-dimensional Lie group.  It is possible to define analogues of many [[group of Lie type|Lie groups over finite fields]], and these give most of the examples of [[finite simple group]]s.\n\nThe language of [[category theory]] provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie group is a [[group object]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to [[supergroup (physics)|Lie supergroups]].\n\n=== Topological definition ===\nA Lie group can be defined as a (Hausdorff) [[topological group]] that, near the identity element, looks like a transformation group, with no reference to differentiable manifolds.<ref>{{harvnb|T. Kobayashi–T. Oshima|loc=Definition 5.3.}}</ref> First, we define an '''immersely linear Lie group''' to be a subgroup ''G'' of the general linear group <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{C})</math> such that\n# for some neighborhood ''V'' of the identity element ''e'' in ''G'', the topology on ''V'' is the subspace topology of <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{C})</math> and ''V'' is closed in <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{C})</math>.\n# ''G'' has at most countably many connected components.\n(For example, a closed subgroup of <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{C})</math>; that is, a matrix Lie group satisfies the above conditions.)\n\nThen a ''Lie group'' is defined as a topological group that (1) is locally isomorphic near the identities to an immersely linear Lie group and (2) has at most countably many connected components. Showing the topological definition is equivalent to the usual one is technical (and the beginning readers should skip the following) but is done roughly as follows:\n# Given a Lie group ''G'' in the usual manifold sense, the [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]] (or a version of [[Lie's third theorem]]) constructs an immersed Lie subgroup <math>G' \\subset \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{C})</math> such that <math>G, G'</math> share the same Lie algebra; thus, they are locally isomorphic. Hence, ''G'' satisfies the above topological definition.\n# Conversely, let ''G'' be a topological group that is a Lie group in the above topological sense and choose an immersely linear Lie group <math>G'</math> that is locally isomorphic to ''G''. Then, by a version of the [[closed subgroup theorem]], <math>G'</math> is a [[real-analytic manifold]] and then, through the local isomorphism, ''G'' acquires a structure of a manifold near the identity element. One then shows that the group law on ''G'' can be given by formal power series; <ref>This is the statement that a Lie group is a [[formal Lie group]]. For the latter concept, for now, see F. Bruhat, [http://www.math.tifr.res.in/~publ/ln/tifr14.pdf Lectures on Lie Groups and Representations of Locally Compact Groups].</ref> so the group operations are real-analytic and ''G'' itself is a real-analytic manifold.\n\nThe topological definition implies the statement that if two Lie groups are isomorphic as topological groups, then they are isomorphic as Lie groups. In fact, it states the general principle that, to a large extent, ''the topology of a Lie group'' together with the group law determines the geometry of the group.\n\n== More examples of Lie groups ==\n{{see also|Table of Lie groups|List of simple Lie groups}}\n\nLie groups occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physics. [[Matrix group]]s or [[algebraic group]]s are (roughly) groups of matrices (for example, [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] and [[symplectic group]]s), and these give most of the more common examples of Lie groups.\n\n===Dimensions one and two===\nThe only connected Lie groups with dimension one are the real line <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> (with the group operation being addition) and the [[circle group]] <math>S^1</math> of complex numbers with absolute value one (with the group operation being multiplication). The <math>S^1</math> group is often denoted as <math>U(1)</math>, the group of <math>1\\times 1</math> unitary matrices.\n\nIn two dimensions, if we restrict attention to simply connected groups, then they are classified by their Lie algebras. There are (up to isomorphism) only two Lie algebras of dimension two. The associated simply connected Lie groups are <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> (with the group operation being vector addition) and the affine group in dimension one, described in the previous subsection under \"first examples.\"\n\n=== Additional examples ===\n*The [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_2|group SU(2)]] is the group of <math>2\\times 2</math> unitary matrices with determinant 1. Topologically, SU(2) is the 3-sphere <math>S^3</math>; as a group, it may be identified with the group of unit [[quaternion]]s. \n*The [[Heisenberg group]] is a connected [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] Lie group of dimension 3, playing a key role in [[quantum mechanics]].\n*The [[Lorentz group]] is a 6-dimensional Lie group of linear [[isometry|isometries]] of the [[Minkowski space]].\n*The [[Poincaré group]] is a 10-dimensional Lie group of [[affine transformation|affine]] isometries of the Minkowski space.\n*The [[exceptional Lie group]]s of types [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]], [[F4 (mathematics)|''F''<sub>4</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|''E''<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|''E''<sub>7</sub>]], [[E8 (mathematics)|''E''<sub>8</sub>]] have dimensions 14, 52, 78, 133, and 248. Along with the A-B-C-D series of [[simple Lie group]]s, the exceptional groups complete the list of simple Lie groups. \n*The [[symplectic group]] Sp(2''n'', '''R''') consists of all 2''n'' × 2''n'' matrices preserving a ''[[symplectic form]]'' on '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup>. It is a connected Lie group of dimension 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''n''.\n\n=== Constructions ===\nThere are several standard ways to form new Lie groups from old ones:\n*The product of two Lie groups is a Lie group.\n*Any [[Closed set|topologically closed]] subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group. This is known as the [[Closed subgroup theorem]] or '''Cartan's theorem'''.\n*The quotient of a Lie group by a closed normal subgroup is a Lie group.\n*The [[universal cover]] of a connected Lie group is a Lie group. For example, the group '''R''' is the universal cover of the circle group '''S'''<sup>1</sup>. In fact any covering of a differentiable manifold is also a differentiable manifold, but by specifying ''universal'' cover, one guarantees a group structure (compatible with its other structures).\n\n=== Related notions ===\nSome examples of groups that are ''not'' Lie groups (except in the trivial sense that any group having at most countably many elements<!-- by convention, a manifold is second countable so we need to exclude an uncountable set --> can be viewed as a 0-dimensional Lie group, with the [[discrete topology]]), are:\n\n*Infinite-dimensional groups, such as the additive group of an infinite-dimensional real vector space. These are not Lie groups as they are not ''finite-dimensional'' manifolds.\n*Some [[totally disconnected group]]s, such as the [[Galois group]] of an infinite extension of fields,  or the additive group of the ''p''-adic numbers. These are not Lie groups because their underlying spaces are not real manifolds. (Some of these groups are \"''p''-adic Lie groups\".) In general, only topological groups having similar [[local property|local properties]] to '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> for some positive integer ''n'' can be Lie groups (of course they must also have a differentiable structure).\n\n== Basic concepts ==\n\n=== The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group ===\n{{main|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence}}\nTo every Lie group we can associate a Lie algebra whose underlying vector space is the tangent space of the Lie group at the identity element and which completely captures the local structure of the group. Informally we can think of elements of the Lie algebra as elements of the group that are \"[[infinitesimal]]ly close\" to the identity, and the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra is related to the [[commutator]] of two such infinitesimal elements. Before giving the abstract definition we give a few examples:\n* The Lie algebra of the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is just '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> with the Lie bracket given by <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [''A'',&nbsp;''B''] = 0. <br /> (In general the Lie bracket of a connected Lie group is always 0 if and only if the Lie group is abelian.)\n* The Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', '''C''') of invertible matrices is the vector space M(''n'', '''C''') of square matrices with the Lie bracket given by <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [''A'',&nbsp;''B''] = ''AB''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''BA''.\n*If ''G'' is a closed subgroup of GL(''n'', '''C''') then the Lie algebra of ''G'' can be thought of informally as the matrices ''m'' of M(''n'', '''R''') such that 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε''m'' is in ''G'', where ε is an infinitesimal positive number with ε<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (of course, no such real number ε exists). For example, the orthogonal group O(''n'', '''R''') consists of matrices ''A'' with ''AA''<sup>T</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, so the Lie algebra consists of the matrices ''m'' with (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε''m'')(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε''m'')<sup>T</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, which is equivalent to ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''m''<sup>T</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 because ε<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n*The preceding description can be made more rigorous as follows. The Lie algebra of a closed subgroup ''G'' of GL(''n'', '''C'''), may be computed as\n:<math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G) = \\{ X \\in M(n;\\mathbb{C}) | \\operatorname{exp}(tX) \\in G \\text{ for all } t \\text{ in } \\mathbb{\\mathbb{R}} \\},</math><ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|loc=Ch. II, § 2, Proposition 2.7.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015|}}</ref> where exp(''tX'') is defined using the [[matrix exponential]]. It can then be shown that the Lie algebra of ''G'' is a real vector space that is closed under the bracket operation, <math>[X,Y]=XY-YX</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.20</ref>\n\nThe concrete definition given above for matrix groups is easy to work with, but has some minor problems: to use it we first need to represent a Lie group as a group of matrices, but not all Lie groups can be represented in this way, and even it is not obvious that the Lie algebra is independent of the representation we use.<ref>But see {{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Proposition 3.30 and Exercise 8 in Chapter 3</ref> To get around these problems we give \nthe general definition of the Lie algebra of a Lie group (in 4 steps):\n#Vector fields on any smooth manifold ''M'' can be thought of as [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivations]] ''X'' of the ring of smooth functions on the manifold, and therefore form a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket [''X'',&nbsp;''Y'']&nbsp;=&nbsp;''XY''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''YX'', because the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of any two derivations is a derivation.\n#If ''G'' is any group acting smoothly on the manifold ''M'', then it acts on the vector fields, and the vector space  of vector fields fixed by the group is closed under the Lie bracket and therefore also forms a Lie algebra.\n#We apply this construction to the case when the manifold ''M'' is the underlying space of a Lie group&nbsp;''G'', with ''G'' acting on ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''M'' by left translations ''L<sub>g</sub>''(''h'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''gh''. This shows that the space of left invariant vector fields (vector fields satisfying ''L<sub>g</sub>''<sub>*</sub>''X<sub>h</sub>'' =&nbsp;''X<sub>gh</sub>'' for every ''h'' in ''G'', where ''L<sub>g</sub>''<sub>*</sub> denotes the differential of ''L<sub>g</sub>'') on a Lie group is a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket of vector fields.\n#Any tangent vector at the identity of a Lie group can be extended to a left invariant vector field by left translating the tangent vector to other points of the manifold. Specifically, the left invariant extension of an element ''v'' of the tangent space at the identity is the vector field defined by ''v''^<sub>''g''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''L<sub>g</sub>''<sub>*</sub>''v''. This identifies the [[tangent space]] ''T<sub>e</sub>G'' at the identity with the space of left invariant vector fields, and therefore makes the tangent space at the identity into a Lie algebra, called the Lie algebra of ''G'', usually denoted by a [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|Fraktur]] <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> Thus the Lie bracket on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is given explicitly by [''v'',&nbsp;''w'']&nbsp;=&nbsp;[''v''^,&nbsp;''w''^]<sub>''e''</sub>.\n\nThis Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is finite-dimensional and it has the same dimension as the manifold ''G''. The Lie algebra of ''G'' determines ''G'' up to \"local isomorphism\", where two Lie groups are called '''locally isomorphic''' if they look the same near the identity element.\nProblems about Lie groups are often solved by first solving the corresponding problem for the Lie algebras, and the result for groups then usually follows easily.  \nFor example, simple Lie groups are usually classified by first classifying the corresponding Lie algebras.\n\nWe could also define a Lie algebra structure on ''T<sub>e</sub>'' using right invariant vector fields instead of left invariant vector fields. This leads to the same Lie algebra, because the inverse map on ''G'' can be used to identify left invariant vector fields with right invariant vector fields, and acts as &minus;1 on the tangent space ''T<sub>e</sub>''.\n\nThe Lie algebra structure on ''T<sub>e</sub>'' can also be described as follows:\nthe commutator operation\n\n: (''x'', ''y'') → ''xyx''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''y''<sup>&minus;1</sup>\n\non ''G'' &times; ''G'' sends (''e'',&nbsp;''e'') to ''e'', so its derivative yields a [[bilinear operator|bilinear operation]] on ''T<sub>e</sub>G''. This bilinear operation is actually the zero map, but the second derivative, under the proper identification of tangent spaces, yields an operation that satisfies the axioms of a [[Lie algebra#Definition and first properties|Lie bracket]], and it is equal to twice the one defined through left-invariant vector fields.\n\n=== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ===\nIf ''G'' and ''H'' are Lie groups, then a Lie group homomorphism ''f'' : ''G'' → ''H''  is a smooth [[group homomorphism]]. In the case of complex Lie groups, such a homomorphism is required to be a [[holomorphic map]]. However, these requirements are a bit stringent; every continuous homomorphism between real Lie groups turns out to be (real) [[analytic map|analytic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.50. Hall only claims smoothness, but the same argument shows analyticity.</ref>\n\nThe composition of two Lie homomorphisms is again a homomorphism, and the class of all Lie groups, together with these morphisms, forms a [[category theory|category]]. Moreover, every Lie group homomorphism induces a homomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebras. Let <math>\\phi\\colon G \\to H</math> be a Lie group homomorphism and let <math>\\phi_{*}</math> be its [[Pushforward (differential)|derivative]] at the identity. If we identify the Lie algebras of ''G'' and ''H'' with their [[tangent space]]s at the identity elements then <math>\\phi_{*}</math> is a map between the corresponding Lie algebras:\n:<math>\\phi_{*}\\colon\\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak h</math>\nOne can show that <math>\\phi_{*}</math> is actually a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]] (meaning that it is a [[linear map]] which preserves the [[Lie bracket]]). In the language of [[category theory]], we then have a covariant [[functor]] from the category of Lie groups to the category of Lie algebras which sends a Lie group to its Lie algebra and a Lie group homomorphism to its derivative at the identity.\n\nTwo Lie groups are called ''isomorphic'' if there exists a [[bijective]] homomorphism between them whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, it is a [[diffeomorphism]] which is also a group homomorphism.\n\n===Lie group versus Lie algebra isomorphisms===\nIsomorphic Lie groups necessarily have isomorphic Lie algebras; it is then reasonable to ask how isomorphism classes of Lie groups relate to isomorphism classes of Lie algebras.\n\nThe first result in this direction is [[Lie's third theorem]], which states that every finite-dimensional, real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of  some (linear) Lie group. One way to prove Lie's third theorem is to use [[Ado's theorem]], which says every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is isomorphic to a matrix Lie algebra. Meanwhile, for every finite-dimensional matrix Lie algebra, there is a linear group (matrix Lie group) with this algebra as its Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras need not be isomorphic. Furthermore, this result remains true even if we assume the groups are connected. To put it differently, the ''global'' structure of a Lie group is not determined by its Lie algebra; for example, if ''Z'' is any discrete subgroup of the center of ''G'' then ''G'' and ''G''/''Z'' have the same Lie algebra (see the [[table of Lie groups]] for examples). An example of importance in physics are the groups [[Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(2)|SU(2)]] and [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]]. These two groups have isomorphic Lie algebras<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 3.27</ref>, but the groups themselves are not isomorphic, because SU(2) is simply connected but SO(3) is not.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.3.4</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, if we require that the Lie group be [[simply connected]], then the global structure is determined by its Lie algebra: two simply connected Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 5.7</ref> (See the next subsection for more information about simply connected Lie groups.) In light of Lie's third theorem, we may therefore say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras and isomorphism classes of simply connected Lie groups.\n\n===Simply connected Lie groups===\n{{see also|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence|Fundamental group#Lie groups}}\nA Lie group ''G'' is said to be '''[[Simply connected space|simply connected]]''' if every loop in ''G'' can be shrunk continuously to a point in ''G''. This notion is important because of the following result that has simple connectedness as a hypothesis:\n:'''Theorem'''<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.6</ref>: Suppose <math>G</math> and <math>H</math> are Lie groups with Lie algebras <math>\\mathfrak g</math> and <math>\\mathfrak h</math> and that <math>f:\\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{h}</math> is a Lie algebra homomorphism. If <math>G</math> is simply connected, then there is a unique Lie group homomorphism <math>\\phi:G\\rightarrow H</math> such that <math>\\phi_*=f</math>, where <math>\\phi_*</math> is the differential of <math>\\phi</math> at the identity.\n[[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence#The correspondence|Lie's third theorem]] says that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. It follows from Lie's third theorem and the preceding result that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a ''unique'' simply connected Lie group.\n\nAn example of a simply connected group is the special unitary group [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_2|SU(2)]], which as a manifold is the 3-sphere. The [[rotation group SO(3)]], on the other hand, is not simply connected. (See [[Rotation group SO(3)#Topology|Topology of SO(3)]].) The failure of SO(3) to be simply connected is intimately connected to the distinction between [[integer spin]] and [[half-integer spin]] in quantum mechanics. Other examples of simply connected Lie groups include the special unitary group [[SU(n)]], the spin group (double cover of rotation group) [[Spin(n)]] for <math>n\\geq 3</math>, and the compact symplectic group [[Symplectic group#Sp.28n.29|Sp(n)]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.2</ref>\n\nMethods for determining whether a Lie group is simply connected or not are discussed in the article on [[Fundamental group#Lie groups|fundamental groups of Lie groups]].\n\n===The exponential map===\n{{Main|Exponential map (Lie theory)}}\n{{see also|derivative of the exponential map|normal coordinates}}\n\nThe [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from the Lie algebra <math>M(n;\\mathbb C)</math>  of the [[general linear group]] <math>GL(n;\\mathbb C)</math> to <math>GL(n;\\mathbb C)</math> is defined by the [[matrix exponential]], given by the usual power series:\n\n:<math>\\exp(X) = 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2!} + \\frac{X^3}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\n\nfor matrices <math>X</math>. If <math>G</math> is a closed subgroup of <math>GL(n;\\mathbb C)</math>, then the exponential map takes the Lie algebra of <math>G</math> into <math>G</math>; thus, we have an exponential map for all matrix groups. Every element of <math>G</math> that is sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of a matrix in the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.42</ref>\n\nThe definition above is easy to use, but it is not defined for Lie groups that are not matrix groups, and it is not clear that the exponential map of a Lie group does not depend on its representation as a matrix group. We can solve both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.\n\nFor each vector <math>X</math> in the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of <math>G</math> (i.e., the tangent space to <math>G</math> at the identity), one proves that there is a unique one-parameter subgroup <math>c:\\mathbb R\\rightarrow G</math> such that <math>c'(0)=X</math>. Saying that <math>c</math> is a one-parameter subgroup means simply that <math>c</math> is a smooth map into <math>G</math> and that \n\n:<math>c(s + t) = c(s) c(t)\\ </math>\n\nfor all ''s'' and ''t''. The operation on the right hand side is the group multiplication in ''G''. The formal similarity of this formula with the one valid for the [[exponential function]] justifies the definition\n\n:<math>\\exp(X) = c(1).\\ </math>\n\nThis is called the '''exponential map''', and it maps the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> into the Lie group ''G''. It provides a [[diffeomorphism]] between a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of 0 in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and a neighborhood of ''e'' in ''G''. This exponential map is a generalization of the exponential function for real numbers (because '''R''' is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of [[positive real numbers]] with multiplication), for complex numbers (because '''C''' is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication) and for [[matrix (math)|matrices]] (because M(''n'', '''R''') with the regular commutator is the Lie algebra of the Lie group GL(''n'', '''R''') of all invertible matrices).\n\nBecause the exponential map is surjective on some neighbourhood ''N'' of ''e'', it is common to call elements of the Lie algebra '''infinitesimal generators''' of the group ''G''. The subgroup of ''G'' generated by ''N'' is  the identity component of ''G''.\n\nThe exponential map and the Lie algebra determine the ''local group structure'' of every connected Lie group, because of the [[Baker&ndash;Campbell&ndash;Hausdorff formula]]: there exists a neighborhood ''U'' of the zero element of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, such that for ''X'', ''Y'' in ''U'' we have\n\n:<math> \\exp(X)\\,\\exp(Y) = \\exp\\left(X + Y + \\tfrac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \\tfrac{1}{12}[\\,[X,Y],Y] - \\tfrac{1}{12}[\\,[X,Y],X] - \\cdots \\right),</math>\n\nwhere the omitted terms are known and involve Lie brackets of four or more elements. In case ''X'' and ''Y'' commute, this formula reduces to the familiar exponential law {{nowrap|exp(''X'') exp(''Y'') {{=}}}} {{nowrap|exp(''X'' + ''Y'')}}.\n\nThe exponential map relates Lie group homomorphisms. That is, if <math>\\phi: G \\to H</math> is a Lie group homomorphism and <math>\\phi_*: \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{h}</math> the induced map on the corresponding Lie algebras, then for all <math>x\\in\\mathfrak g</math> we have\n:<math>\\phi(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(\\phi_{*}(x)).\\,</math>\nIn other words, the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]],<ref group=Note>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~vkiritch/MAT552/ProblemSet1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928024044/http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~vkiritch/MAT552/ProblemSet1.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n[[File:ExponentialMap-01.png|center]]\n\n(In short, exp is a [[natural transformation]] from the functor Lie to the identity functor on the category of Lie groups.)\n\nThe exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group is not always [[Surjective function|onto]], even if the group is connected (though it does map onto the Lie group for connected groups that are either compact or nilpotent). For example, the exponential map of [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is not surjective. Also, exponential map is not surjective nor injective for infinite-dimensional (see below) Lie groups modelled on [[Smooth function#Differentiability classes|''C''<sup>∞</sup>]] [[Fréchet space]], even from arbitrary small neighborhood of 0 to corresponding neighborhood of 1.\n\n=== Lie subgroup ===\nA '''Lie subgroup''' ''H'' of a Lie group ''G'' is a Lie group that is a [[subset]] of ''G'' and such that the [[inclusion map]] from ''H'' to ''G'' is an [[injective]] [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] and [[group homomorphism]]. According to [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]], a closed [[subgroup]] of ''G'' admits a unique smooth structure which makes it an [[embedding|embedded]] Lie subgroup of ''G''—i.e. a Lie subgroup such that the inclusion map is a smooth embedding.\n\nExamples of non-closed subgroups are plentiful; for example take ''G'' to be a torus of dimension ≥ 2, and let ''H'' be a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of ''irrational slope'', i.e. one that winds around in ''G''. Then there is a Lie group [[homomorphism]] φ : '''R''' → ''G'' with ''H'' as its image. The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''H'' will be a sub-torus in ''G''.\n\nThe [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] gives a [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence#The correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] between the connected Lie subgroups of a connected Lie group ''G'' and the subalgebras of the Lie algebra of ''G''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20</ref>  Typically, the subgroup corresponding to a subalgebra is not a  closed subgroup.  There is no criterion solely based on the structure of ''G'' which determines which subalgebras correspond to closed subgroups.\n\n==Representations==\n{{main|Representation of a Lie group}}\n{{see also|Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|Lie algebra representation}}\nOne important aspect of the study of Lie groups is their representations, that is, the way they can act (linearly) on vector spaces. In physics, Lie groups often encode the symmetries of a physical system. The way one makes use of this symmetry to help analyze the system is often through representation theory. Consider, for example, the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]] in quantum mechanics, <math>\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi</math>. Assume the system in question has the [[rotation group SO(3)]] as a symmetry, meaning that the Hamiltonian operator <math>\\hat{H}</math> commutes with the action of SO(3) on the wave function <math>\\psi</math>. (One important example of such a system is the [[Hydrogen atom]].) This assumption does not necessarily mean that the solutions <math>\\psi</math> are rotationally invariant functions. Rather, it means that the ''space'' of solutions to <math>\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi</math> is invariant under rotations (for each fixed value of <math>E</math>). This space, therefore, constitutes a representation of SO(3). These representations have been [[Representation of a Lie group#An example: The rotation group SO.283.29|classified]] and the classification leads to a substantial [[Hydrogen-like atom|simplification of the problem]], essentially converting a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe case of a connected compact Lie group ''K'' (including the just-mentioned case of SO(3)) is particularly tractable.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Part III</ref> In that case, every finite-dimensional representation of ''K'' decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The irreducible representations, in turn, were classified by [[Hermann Weyl]]. [[Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|The classification]] is in terms of the \"highest weight\" of the representation. The classification is closely related to the [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|classification of representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]].\n\nOne can also study (in general infinite-dimensional) unitary representations of an arbitrary Lie group (not necessarily compact). For example, it is possible to give a relatively simple explicit description of the [[Representation theory of SL2(R)|representations of the group SL(2,R)]] and the [[Wigner%27s classification|representations of the Poincaré group]].\n\n== Early history ==\nAccording to the most authoritative source on the early history of Lie groups (Hawkins, p.&nbsp;1), [[Sophus Lie]] himself considered the winter of 1873–1874 as the birth date of his theory of continuous groups. Hawkins, however, suggests that it was \"Lie's prodigious research activity during the four-year period from the fall of 1869 to the fall of 1873\" that led to the theory's creation (''ibid''). Some of Lie's early ideas were developed in close collaboration with [[Felix Klein]].  Lie met with Klein every day from October 1869 through 1872: in Berlin from the end of October 1869 to the end of February 1870, and in Paris, Göttingen and Erlangen in the subsequent two years (''ibid'', p.&nbsp;2). Lie stated that all of the principal results were obtained by 1884. But during the 1870s all his papers (except the very first note) were published in Norwegian journals, which impeded recognition of the work throughout the rest of Europe (''ibid'', p.&nbsp;76). In 1884 a young German mathematician, [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]], came to work with Lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous groups. From this effort resulted the three-volume ''Theorie der Transformationsgruppen'', published in 1888, 1890, and 1893. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student Arthur Tresse.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants différentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1–88 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270}}</ref>\n\nLie's ideas did not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics. In fact, his interest in the geometry of differential equations was first motivated by the work of [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]], on the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s of first order and on the equations of [[classical mechanics]].  Much of Jacobi's work was published posthumously in the 1860s, generating enormous interest in France and Germany (Hawkins, p.&nbsp;43). Lie's ''idée fixe'' was to develop a theory of symmetries of differential equations that would accomplish for them what [[Évariste Galois]] had done for algebraic equations: namely, to classify them in terms of group theory. Lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]] tend to arise from group theoretical symmetries. In Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of ''continuous groups'', to complement the theory of [[discrete group]]s that had developed in the theory of [[modular form]]s, in the hands of [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. On the model of [[Galois theory]] and [[polynomial equation]]s, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of [[symmetry]], the whole area of [[ordinary differential equation]]s. However, the hope that Lie Theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled. Symmetry methods for ODEs continue to be studied, but do not dominate the subject. There is a [[differential Galois theory]], but it was developed by others, such as Picard and Vessiot, and it provides a theory of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]s, the [[indefinite integral]]s required to express solutions.\n\nAdditional impetus to consider continuous groups came from ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann]], on the foundations of geometry, and their further development in the hands of Klein. Thus three major themes in 19th century mathematics were combined by Lie in creating his new theory: the idea of symmetry, as exemplified by Galois through the algebraic notion of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]; geometric theory and the explicit solutions of [[differential equation]]s of mechanics, worked out by [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] and Jacobi; and the new understanding of [[geometry]] that emerged in the works of [[Julius Plücker|Plücker]], [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], [[Grassmann]] and others, and culminated in Riemann's revolutionary vision of the subject.\n\nAlthough today Sophus Lie is rightfully recognized as the creator of the theory of continuous groups, a major stride in the development of their structure theory, which was to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics, was made by [[Wilhelm Killing]], who in 1888 published the first paper in a series entitled ''Die Zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen Transformationsgruppen'' (''The composition of continuous finite transformation groups'') (Hawkins, p.&nbsp;100). The work of Killing, later refined and generalized by [[Élie Cartan]], led to classification of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, Cartan's theory of [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric spaces]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]'s description of [[group representation|representations]] of compact and semisimple Lie groups using [[highest weight]]s.\n\nIn 1900 [[David Hilbert]] challenged Lie theorists with his [[Hilbert's fifth problem|Fifth Problem]] presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris.\n\nWeyl brought the early period of the development of the theory of Lie groups to fruition, for not only did he classify irreducible representations of semisimple Lie groups and connect the theory of groups with quantum mechanics, but he also put Lie's theory itself on firmer footing by clearly enunciating the distinction between Lie's ''infinitesimal groups'' (i.e., Lie algebras) and the Lie groups proper, and began investigations of topology of Lie groups.{{sfnp|Borel|2001}} The theory of Lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by [[Claude Chevalley]].\n<!--\nNeed specific reference from Borel's book to Weyl's work, in particular, distinction mentioned in the text\n-->\n\n==The concept of a Lie group, and possibilities of classification==\nLie groups may be thought of as smoothly varying families of symmetries. Examples of symmetries include rotation about an axis.  What must be understood is the nature of 'small' transformations, for example, rotations through tiny angles, that link nearby transformations. The mathematical object capturing this structure is called a Lie algebra ([[Sophus Lie|Lie]] himself called them \"infinitesimal groups\"). It can be defined because Lie groups are smooth manifolds, so have [[tangent space]]s at each point.\n\nThe Lie algebra of any compact Lie group (very roughly: one for which the symmetries form a bounded set) can be decomposed as a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of an [[abelian Lie algebra]] and some number of [[simple Lie group|simple]] ones. The structure of an abelian Lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting (since the Lie bracket is identically zero); the interest is in the simple summands. Hence the question arises: what are the [[simple Lie group|simple Lie algebras]] of compact groups? It turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite families, the \"classical Lie algebras\" A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub> and D<sub>''n''</sub>, which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of Euclidean space. But there are also just five \"exceptional Lie algebras\" that do not fall into any of these families. E<sub>8</sub> is the largest of these.\n\nLie groups are classified according to their algebraic properties ([[simple group|simple]], [[semisimple group|semisimple]], [[solvable group|solvable]], [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]], [[abelian group|abelian]]), their [[connectedness]] ([[connected space|connected]] or [[simply connected space|simply connected]]) and their [[compact space|compactness]].\n\nA first key result is the [[Levi decomposition]], which says that every simply connected Lie group is the semidirect product of a solvable normal subgroup and a semisimple subgroup. \n\n*Connected [[compact Lie group]]s are all known: they are finite central quotients of a product of copies of the circle group '''S'''<sup>1</sup> and simple compact Lie groups (which correspond to connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s).\n*Any simply connected solvable Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Solvable groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.\n*Any simply connected nilpotent Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Like solvable groups, nilpotent  groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.\n*[[Simple Lie group]]s are sometimes defined to be those that are simple as abstract groups, and sometimes defined to be connected Lie groups with a simple Lie algebra. For example, [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is simple according to the second definition but not according to the first. They have all been [[list of simple Lie groups|classified]] (for either definition).\n*[[Semisimple group|Semisimple]] Lie groups are Lie groups whose Lie algebra is a product of simple Lie algebras.<ref>{{cite book |first=Sigurdur |last=Helgason |title=Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1978 |page=131 |isbn=978-0-12-338460-7 }}</ref> They are central extensions of products of simple Lie groups.\n\nThe [[identity component]] of any Lie group is an open [[normal subgroup]], and the [[quotient group]] is a [[discrete group]]. The universal cover of any connected Lie group is a simply connected Lie group, and conversely any connected Lie group is a quotient of a simply connected Lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center. Any Lie group ''G'' can be decomposed into discrete, simple, and abelian groups in a canonical way as follows.  Write \n:''G''<sub>con</sub> for the connected component of the identity\n:''G''<sub>sol</sub> for the largest connected normal solvable subgroup\n:''G''<sub>nil</sub> for the largest connected normal nilpotent subgroup\nso that we have a sequence of normal subgroups\n:1 ⊆ ''G''<sub>nil</sub> ⊆ ''G''<sub>sol</sub> ⊆ ''G''<sub>con</sub> ⊆ ''G''.\nThen\n:''G''/''G''<sub>con</sub> is discrete\n:''G''<sub>con</sub>/''G''<sub>sol</sub> is a [[group extension|central extension]] of a product of [[list of simple Lie groups|simple connected Lie groups]].\n:''G''<sub>sol</sub>/''G''<sub>nil</sub> is abelian. A connected abelian Lie group is isomorphic to a product of copies of  '''R''' and the [[circle group]] ''S''<sup>1</sup>.\n:''G''<sub>nil</sub>/1 is nilpotent, and therefore its ascending central series has all quotients abelian.\n\nThis can be used to reduce some problems about Lie groups (such as finding their unitary representations) to the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups of smaller dimension.\n\n* The [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism group]] of a Lie group acts transitively on the Lie group\n* Every Lie group is [[parallelizable]], and hence an [[orientable manifold]] (there is a [[fibre bundle|bundle isomorphism]] between its [[tangent bundle]] and the product of itself with the [[tangent space]] at the identity)\n\n==Infinite-dimensional Lie groups==\nLie groups are often defined to be finite-dimensional, but there are many groups that resemble Lie groups, except for being infinite-dimensional. The simplest way to define infinite-dimensional Lie groups is to  model them locally on [[Banach space]]s (as opposed to [[Euclidean space]] in the finite-dimensional case), and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finite-dimensional Lie groups. However this is inadequate for many applications, because many natural examples of infinite-dimensional Lie groups are not Banach manifolds. Instead one needs to define Lie groups modeled on more general [[Locally convex space|locally convex]] topological vector spaces. In this case the relation between the Lie algebra and the Lie group becomes rather subtle, and several results about finite-dimensional Lie groups no longer hold.\n\nThe literature is not entirely uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinite-dimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix ''Lie'' in ''Lie group''. On the Lie algebra side of affairs, things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix ''Lie'' in ''Lie algebra'' are purely algebraic. For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity). It is the \"nice enough\" that is not universally defined.\n\nSome of the examples that have been studied include:\n*The group of [[diffeomorphism]]s of a manifold. Quite a lot is known about the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. Its Lie algebra is (more or less) the [[Witt algebra]], whose [[Lie algebra extension|central extension]] the [[Virasoro algebra]] (see [[Lie algebra extension#Virasoro algebra|Virasoro algebra from Witt algebra]] for a derivation of this fact) is the symmetry algebra of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]]. Diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are [[Convenient vector space#Regular Lie groups|regular Fréchet Lie groups]]; very little about their structure is known.\nThe diffeomorphism group of spacetime sometimes appears in attempts to [[Quantization (physics)|quantize]] gravity.\n*The group of smooth maps from a manifold to a finite-dimensional Lie group is an example of a [[gauge group]] (with operation of [[pointwise multiplication]]), and is used  in [[quantum field theory]] and [[Donaldson theory]]. If the manifold is a circle these are called [[loop group]]s, and have central extensions whose Lie algebras are (more or less) [[Kac&ndash;Moody algebra]]s.\n*There are infinite-dimensional analogues of general linear groups, orthogonal groups, and so on.<ref>{{harvnb|Bäuerle|de Kerf|ten Kroode|1997}}</ref> One important aspect is that these may have ''simpler'' topological properties: see for example [[Kuiper's theorem]]. In [[M-theory]], for example, a 10 dimensional SU(N) gauge theory becomes an 11 dimensional theory when N becomes infinite.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Adjoint representation of a Lie group]]\n*[[Compact group]]\n*[[Haar measure]]\n*[[Homogeneous space]]\n*[[Lie algebra]]\n*[[List of Lie group topics]]\n*[[Representations of Lie groups]]\n*[[Symmetry in quantum mechanics]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|authorlink=John Frank Adams|first=John Frank|last= Adams|title=Lectures on Lie Groups|series=Chicago Lectures in Mathematics|isbn= 978-0-226-00527-0|year=1969|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago | mr=0252560}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Essays in the history of Lie groups and algebraic groups | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0821802887 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=History of Mathematics | isbn=978-0-8218-0288-5 | mr=1847105 | year=2001 | volume=21}}\n* {{citation|first=Nicolas|last= Bourbaki|authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Elements of mathematics: Lie groups and Lie algebras}}.

He showed the following main property: the order of an ordinary differential equation can be reduced by one if it is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under one-parameter Lie group of [[point transformation]]s.<ref name=\"Olver1993\"/> This observation unified and extended the available integration techniques. Lie devoted the remainder of his mathematical career to developing these [[continuous group]]s that have now an impact on many areas of mathematically based sciences. The applications of Lie groups to [[differential system]]s were mainly established by Lie and [[Emmy Noether]], and then advocated by [[Élie Cartan]].\n\nRoughly speaking, a Lie point symmetry of a system is a local group of transformations that maps every solution of the system to another solution of the same system. In other words, it maps the solution set of the system to itself. Elementary examples of Lie groups are [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[rotations]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scalings]].\n\nThe Lie symmetry theory is a well-known subject.

[[Lie-Bäcklund transformation]]s let them involve derivatives up to an arbitrary order.

In the literature, one can find the classical reduction process,<ref name=\"Olver1993\"/> and the [[moving frame]]-based reduction process.<ref name=\"Cartan1935\"/><ref name=\"FelsOlver1998\"/><ref name=\"FelsOlver1999\"/> Also symmetry groups can be used for classifying different symmetry classes of solutions.\n\n== Geometrical framework ==\n\n=== Infinitesimal approach ===\nLie's fundamental theorems underline that Lie groups can be characterized by elements known as ''infinitesimal generators''. These mathematical objects form a [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal generators. Deduced \"infinitesimal symmetry conditions\" (defining equations of the symmetry group) can be explicitly solved in order to find the closed form of symmetry groups, and thus the associated infinitesimal generators.\n\nLet <math>Z=(z_1,\\dots,z_n)</math> be the set of coordinates on which a system is defined where <math>n</math> is the cardinal of <math>Z</math>. An infinitesimal generator <math>\\delta</math> in the field <math>\\mathbb{R}(Z)</math> is a linear operator <math>\\delta : \\mathbb{R}(Z)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}(Z)</math> that has <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> in its kernel and that satisfies the [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]:\n:<math>\\forall (f_1,f_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}(Z)^2, \\delta f_1 f_2 = f_1 \\delta f_2 + f_2 \\delta f_1</math>.\nIn the canonical basis of elementary derivations <math>\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_1},\\dots,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_n}\\right \\}</math>, it is written as:\n:<math>\\delta = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_{z_i}(Z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i}</math>\nwhere <math>\\xi_{z_i}</math> is in <math>\\mathbb{R}(Z)</math> for all <math>i</math> in <math>\\left\\{1,\\dots,n\\right\\}</math>.\n\n=== Lie groups and Lie algebras of infinitesimal generators ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\n\n[[Lie algebra]]s can be generated by a generating set of infinitesimal generators as defined above. To every Lie group, one can associate a Lie algebra. Roughly, a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is an [[algebra]] constituted by a vector space equipped with [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] as additional operation. The base field of a Lie algebra depends on the concept of [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Here only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are considered.\n\n=== Continuous dynamical systems ===\n\nA [[dynamical system]] (or [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]) is a one-parameter [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]. Let us denote by <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> such a dynamical system, more precisely, a (left-)action of a group <math>(G,+)</math> on a [[manifold]] <math>M</math>:\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rccc}\n\\mathcal{D} : & G\\times M & \\rightarrow & M \\\\\n& \\nu \\times Z & \\rightarrow & \\mathcal{D}(\\nu,Z)\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nsuch that for all point <math>Z</math> in <math>M</math>:\n* <math>\\mathcal{D}(e,Z)=Z</math> where <math>e</math> is the neutral element of <math>G</math>;\n* for all <math>(\\nu, \\hat{\\nu})</math> in <math>G^2</math>, <math>\\mathcal{D}(\\nu,\\mathcal{D}(\\hat{\\nu},Z))=\\mathcal{D}(\\nu+\\hat{\\nu},Z)</math>.\n\nA continuous dynamical system is defined on a group <math>G</math> that can be identified to <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> i.e. the group elements are continuous.\n\n=== Invariants ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\n\nAn [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], roughly speaking, is an element that does not change under a transformation.\n\n== Definition of Lie point symmetries ==\n\nIn this paragraph, we consider precisely ''expanded Lie point symmetries'' i.e. we work in an expanded space meaning that the distinction between independent variable, state variables and parameters are avoided as much as possible.\n\nA symmetry group of a system is a continuous dynamical system defined on a local Lie group <math>G</math> acting on a manifold <math>M</math>. For the sake of clarity, we restrict ourselves to n-dimensional real manifolds <math>M=\\mathbb{R}^n</math> where <math>n</math> is the number of system coordinates.\n\n=== Lie point symmetries of algebraic systems ===\n\nLet us define [[algebraic system]]s used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.\n\n==== Algebraic systems ====\n\nLet <math>F=(f_1,\\dots,f_k)=(p_1/q_1,\\dots,p_k/q_k)</math> be a finite set of rational functions over the field <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> where <math>p_i</math> and <math>q_i</math> are polynomials in <math>\\mathbb{R}[Z]</math> i.e. in variables <math>Z=(z_1,\\dots,z_n)</math> with coefficients in <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>. An ''algebraic system'' associated to <math>F</math> is defined by the following equalities and inequalities:\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\np_1(Z)= 0, \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\np_k(Z)=0\n\\end{array}\n\\right.& \\mbox{and} &\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\nq_1(Z) \\neq 0, \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nq_k(Z) \\neq 0.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nAn algebraic system defined by <math>F=(f_1,\\dots,f_k)</math> is ''regular'' (a.k.a. [[Smooth algebraic variety|smooth]]) if the system <math>F</math> is of maximal rank <math>k</math>, meaning that the [[Jacobian matrix]] <math>(\\partial f_i / \\partial z_j)</math> is of rank <math>k</math> at every solution <math>Z</math> of the associated semi-algebraic [[algebraic variety|variety]].\n\n==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====\n\nThe following theorem (see th. 2.8 in ch.2 of <ref name=\"Olver1995\"/>) gives necessary and sufficient conditions so that a local Lie group <math>G</math> is a symmetry group of an algebraic system.\n\n'''Theorem'''. Let <math>G</math> be a connected local Lie group of a continuous dynamical system acting in the n-dimensional space <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. Let <math>F: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^k</math> with <math>k \\leq n</math> define a regular system of algebraic equations:\n:<math>\nf_i(Z)=0 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1,\\dots,k\\}.\n</math>\nThen <math>G</math> is a symmetry group of this algebraic system if, and only if,\n:<math>\n\\delta f_i(Z)=0 \\quad \\forall i\\in \\{1,\\dots,k\\} \\mbox{ whenever } f_1(Z)=\\dots=f_k(Z)=0\n</math>\nfor every infinitesimal generator <math>\\delta</math> in the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of <math>G</math>.\n\n==== Example ====\nConsider the algebraic system defined on a space of 6 variables, namely <math>Z=(P,Q,a,b,c,l)</math> with:\n:<math>\n\\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\nf_1(Z)=(1-cP)+bQ + 1, \\\\\nf_2(Z)=aP - lQ +1.\n\\end{array}\n\\right .\n</math>\n\nThe infinitesimal generator\n:<math>\n\\delta = a(a-1) \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial a} + (l+b)\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial b}+ (2ac-c)\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial c}+(-aP+P)\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\n</math>\nis associated to one of the one-parameter symmetry groups. It acts on 4 variables, namely <math>a,b,c</math> and <math>P</math>. One can easily verify that <math>\\delta f_1 = f_1 -f_2</math> and <math>\\delta f_2 = 0</math>. Thus the relations <math>\\delta f_1 = \\delta f_2 = 0</math> are satisfied for any <math>Z</math> in <math>\\mathbb{R}^6</math> that vanishes the algebraic system.\n\n=== Lie point symmetries of dynamical systems ===\n\nLet us define systems of first-order [[ordinary differential equations|ODEs]] used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.\n\n==== Systems of ODEs and associated infinitesimal generators ====\n\nLet <math>d\\cdot / dt</math> be a derivation w.r.t. the continuous independent variable <math>t</math>. We consider two sets <math>X=(x_1,\\dots,x_k)</math> and <math>\\Theta = (\\theta_1,\\dots,\\theta_l)</math>. The associated coordinate set is defined by <math>Z=(z_1,\\dots,z_n)=(t,x_1,\\dots,x_k,\\theta_1,\\dots,\\theta_l)</math> and its cardinal is <math>n=1+k+l</math>. With these notations, a ''system of first-order ODEs'' is a system where:\n:<math>\n\\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\dfrac{d x_i}{dt} = f_i(Z) \\mbox{ with } f_i \\in \\mathbb{R}(Z) \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1,\\dots,k\\}, \\\\\n\\dfrac{d \\theta_j}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1,\\dots,l\\}\n\\end{array}\n\\right .\n</math>\nand the set <math>F=(f_1,\\dots,f_k)</math> specifies the evolution of state variables of ODEs w.r.t. the independent variable. The elements of the set <math>X</math> are called ''state variables'', these of <math>\\Theta</math> ''parameters''.\n\nOne can associate also a continuous dynamical system to a system of ODEs by resolving its equations.\n\nAn infinitesimal generator is a derivation that is closely related to systems of ODEs (more precisely to continuous dynamical systems). For the link between a system of ODEs, the associated vector field and the infinitesimal generator, see section 1.3 of.<ref name=\"Olver1993\"/> The infinitesimal generator <math>\\delta</math> associated to a system of ODEs, described as above, is defined with the same notations as follows:\n:<math>\n\\delta = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(Z) \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\cdot\n</math>\n\n==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====\n\nHere is a geometrical definition of such symmetries. Let <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> be a continuous dynamical system and <math>\\delta_\\mathcal{D}</math> its infinitesimal generator. A continuous dynamical system <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> is a Lie point symmetry of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> if, and only if, <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> sends every orbit of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> to an orbit. Hence, the infinitesimal generator <math>\\delta_\\mathcal{S}</math> satisfies the following relation<ref name=\"Stephani1989\"/> based on [[Lie bracket]]:\n:<math>\n[\\delta_\\mathcal{D}, \\delta_\\mathcal{S}] = \\lambda \\delta_\\mathcal{D}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\lambda</math> is any constant of <math>\\delta_\\mathcal{D}</math> and <math>\\delta_\\mathcal{S}</math> i.e. <math>\\delta_\\mathcal{D}\\lambda = \\delta_\\mathcal{S} \\lambda = 0</math>. These generators are linearly independent.\n\nOne does not need the explicit formulas of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> in order to compute the infinitesimal generators of its symmetries.\n\n=== Example ===\n\nConsider [[Pierre François Verhulst]]'s [[logistic growth]] model with linear predation,<ref name=\"Murray2002\"/> where the state variable <math>x</math> represents a population. The parameter <math>a</math> is the difference between the growth and predation rate and the parameter <math>b</math> corresponds to the receptive capacity of the environment:\n:<math>\n\\dfrac{dx}{dt}= (a-bx)x, \\dfrac{da}{dt}=\\dfrac{db}{dt}=0.\n</math>\n\nThe continuous dynamical system associated to this system of ODEs is:\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rccc}\n\\mathcal{D}: & (\\mathbb{R},+) \\times \\mathbb{R}^4 & \\rightarrow & \\mathbb{R}^4 \\\\\n& (\\hat{t},(t,x,a,b)) & \\rightarrow & \\left(t+\\hat{t}, \\frac{axe^{a\\hat{t}}}{a-(1-e^{a\\hat{t}})bx}, a, b\\right).\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nThe independent variable <math>\\hat{t}</math> varies continuously; thus the associated group can be identified with <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator associated to this system of ODEs is:\n:<math>\n\\delta_\\mathcal{D} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + ((a-bx)x)\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\cdot\n</math>\n\nThe following infinitesimal generators belong to the 2-dimensional symmetry group of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math>:\n:<math>\n\\delta_{\\mathcal{S}_1} = -x \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+b\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial b},\n\\quad\n\\delta_{\\mathcal{S}_2} = t\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-x\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-a\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial a}\n\\cdot\n</math>\n\n== Software ==\n\nThere exist many software packages in this area.<ref name=\"Heck2003\"/><ref name=\"Schwarz1988\"/><ref name=\"Dimas2005\"/> For example, the package liesymm of [[Maple (software)|Maple]] provides some Lie symmetry methods for [[partial differential equation|PDEs]].<ref name=\"CarminatiDevittFee1992\"/> It manipulates integration of determining systems and also [[differential form]]s. Despite its success on small systems, its integration capabilities for solving determining systems automatically are limited by complexity issues. The DETools package uses the prolongation of [[vector field]]s for searching Lie symmetries of ODEs. Finding Lie symmetries for ODEs, in the general case, may be as complicated as solving the original system.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"BlumanKumei1989\">{{cite book |title= Symmetries and Differential Equations|last1= Bluman |first1 = G. |last2=Kumei |first2= S.|year=1989 |publisher= Springer-Verlag|location= New York |edition= Second |series= Applied Mathematical Sciences Series|volume= 81}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Murray2002\">{{cite book |title= Mathematical Biology |last= Murray |first= J.

      "text": "{{short description|formula of matrix exponentials}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Lie product formula''', named for [[Sophus Lie]] (1875), states that for arbitrary ''n'' &times; ''n'' [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ''A'' and ''B'',<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 2.11</ref>\n\n:<math>e^{A+B} = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} (e^{A/N}e^{B/N})^N, </math>\n\nwhere ''e''<sup>''A''</sup> denotes the [[matrix exponential]] of ''A''.  The '''Lie–Trotter product formula''' {{harv|Trotter|1959}} and the '''Trotter–Kato theorem''' {{harv|Kato|1978}} extend this to certain unbounded linear operators ''A'' and ''B''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 20.1</ref>\n\nThis formula is an analogue of the classical exponential law\n\n:<math>e^{x+y} = e^x e^y \\,</math>\n\nwhich holds for all real or complex numbers ''x'' and ''y''. If ''x'' and ''y'' are replaced with matrices ''A'' and ''B'', and the [[Exponential function|exponential]] replaced with a [[matrix exponential]], it is usually necessary for ''A'' and ''B'' to commute for the law to still hold. However, the Lie product formula holds for all matrices ''A'' and ''B'', even ones which do not commute.\n\nThe Lie product formula is conceptually related to the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]], in that both are replacements, in the context of non commuting operators, for the classical exponential law <math>e^{x+y} = e^x e^y \\,</math>.\n\nThe formula has applications, for example, in the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics. It allows one to separate the [[Propagator|Schrödinger evolution operator]] into alternating increments of kinetic and potential operators. The same idea is used in the construction of [[Symplectic integrator|splitting method]]s for the numerical solution of [[differential equation]]s. Moreover, the Lie product theorem is sufficient to prove the [[Feynman–Kac formula]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Time-evolving block decimation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Sophus Lie and Friedrich Engel  (1888, 1890, 1893).

When the components of ω are [[rational dependence|rationally independent]] all the orbits are dense on the whole space. This can be easily seen in the two dimensional case: if the two components of ω are rationally independent then the [[Poincaré section]] of the flow on an edge of the unit square is an [[irrational rotation]] on a circle and therefore its orbits are dense on the circle, as a consequence the orbits of the flow must be dense on the torus.\n\n==Irrational winding of a torus==\n\nIn [[topology]], an '''irrational winding of a torus''' is a continuous [[injective function|injection]] of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] into a two-dimensional [[torus]] that is used to set up several counterexamples.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILhUYVmvHt0C&pg=PA45|title=Compact Lie groups and their representations|author=D. P. Zhelobenko}}</ref> A related notion is the [[Kronecker foliation]] of a torus, a foliation formed by the set of all translates of a given irrational winding.\n\n=== Definition ===\nOne way of constructing a torus is as the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] <math>\\mathbb{T^2} = \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}^2</math> of a two-dimensional real vector space by the additive subgroup of integer vectors, with the corresponding [[Quotient space (topology)|projection]] <math>\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{T^2}</math>. Each point in the torus has as its preimage one of the translates of the square lattice <math>\\mathbb{Z}^2</math> in <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math>, and <math>\\pi</math> factors through a map that takes any point in the plane to a point in the [[unit square]] <math>[0, 1)^2</math> given by the fractional parts of the original point's Cartesian coordinates. Now consider a line in <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> given by the equation ''y = kx''. If the slope ''k'' of the line is [[rational number|rational]], then it can be represented by a fraction and a corresponding lattice point of <math>\\mathbb{Z}^2</math>. It can be shown that then the projection of this line is a [[simple curve|simple]] [[closed curve]] on a torus. If, however, ''k'' is [[irrational number|irrational]], then it will not cross any lattice points except 0, which means that its projection on the torus will not be a closed curve, and the restriction of <math>\\pi</math> on this line is [[injective mapping|injective]]. Moreover, it can be shown that the image of this restricted projection as a subspace, called the irrational winding of a torus, is [[dense subspace|dense]] in the torus.\n\n=== Applications ===\n\nIrrational windings of a torus may be used to set up counter-examples related to [[monomorphism]]s. An irrational winding is an [[Submanifold#Immersed submanifolds|immersed submanifold]] but not a [[Submanifold#Embedded submanifolds|regular submanifold]] of the torus, which shows that the image of a manifold under a [[continuous function|continuous]] injection to another manifold is not necessarily a (regular) submanifold.<ref name=\"Tu\">{{cite book|author=Loring W.

      "text": "{{Lie groups |Simple}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[simple Lie group]]s were first classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and later perfected by [[Élie Cartan]]. This classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification. \n\nThe list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of [[simple Lie algebra]]s and [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s.  See also the [[table of Lie groups]] for a smaller list of groups that commonly occur in [[theoretical physics]], and the [[Bianchi classification]] for groups of dimension at most 3. \n\n== Simple Lie groups ==\n\nUnfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a [[simple Lie group]]. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is [[simple group|simple]] as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether '''R''' is a simple Lie group. \n\nThe most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed ''connected'' normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but '''R''' is not simple. \n\nIn this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed.  Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a [[covering space#universal covers|universal cover]], whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.\n\n== Simple Lie algebras ==\n\nThe Lie algebra of a simple Lie group is a simple Lie algebra. This is a one-to-one correspondence between connected simple Lie groups with [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] center and simple Lie algebras of dimension greater than 1. (Authors differ on whether the one-dimensional Lie algebra should be counted as simple.)\n\nOver the complex numbers the semisimple Lie algebras are classified by their [[Dynkin diagram]]s, of types \"ABCDEFG\". If ''L'' is a real simple Lie algebra, its complexification is a simple complex Lie algebra, unless ''L'' is already \nthe complexification of a Lie algebra, in which case the complexification of ''L'' is a product of two copies of ''L''. This reduces the problem of classifying the real simple Lie algebras to that of finding all the [[real form]]s of each complex simple Lie algebra (i.e., real Lie algebras whose complexification is the given complex Lie algebra). There are always at least 2 such forms: a split form and a compact form, and there are usually a few others. The different real forms correspond to the classes of automorphisms of order at most 2 of the complex Lie algebra.\n\n== Symmetric spaces ==\n\nSymmetric spaces are classified as follows. \n\nFirst, the universal cover of a symmetric space is still symmetric, so we can reduce to the case of simply connected symmetric spaces. (For example, the universal cover of a real projective plane is a sphere.)\n\nSecond, the product of symmetric spaces is symmetric, so we may as well just classify the irreducible simply connected ones (where irreducible means they cannot be written as a product of smaller symmetric spaces). \n\nThe irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces are the real line, and exactly two symmetric spaces corresponding to  each ''non-compact'' simple Lie group ''G'',\none compact and one non-compact. The non-compact one is a cover of the quotient of ''G'' by a maximal compact subgroup ''H'', and the compact one is a cover of the quotient of\nthe compact form of ''G'' by the same subgroup ''H''. This duality between compact and non-compact symmetric spaces is a generalization of the well known duality between spherical and hyperbolic geometry.\n\n== Hermitian symmetric spaces ==\n\nA symmetric space with a compatible complex structure is called Hermitian.  The compact simply connected irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces fall into 4 infinite families with 2 exceptional ones left over, and each has a non-compact dual. In addition the complex plane is also a Hermitian symmetric space; this gives the complete list of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces.\n\nThe four families are the types A&nbsp;III, B&nbsp;I and D&nbsp;I for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}}, D&nbsp;III, and C&nbsp;I, and the two exceptional ones are types E&nbsp;III and E&nbsp;VII of complex dimensions 16 and 27.\n\n== Notation ==\n\n<math> \\mathbb {R, C, H, O} </math>&nbsp; stand for the real numbers, complex numbers, [[quaternions]], and [[octonion]]s.\n\nIn the symbols such as ''E''<sub>6</sub><sup>&minus;26</sup> for the exceptional groups, the exponent &minus;26 is the signature of an invariant symmetric bilinear form that is negative definite on the maximal compact subgroup. It is equal to the dimension of the group minus twice the dimension of a maximal compact subgroup.\n\nThe fundamental group listed in the table below is the fundamental group of the simple group with trivial center. \nOther simple groups with the same Lie algebra correspond to subgroups of this fundamental group (modulo the action of the outer automorphism group).\n\n== List ==\n\n=== Abelian ===\n\n{{See also|Abelian group}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=100|\n!

      "text": "{{Short description|Lie group of Lorentz transformations}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |Topological}}\n[[File:Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Hendrik Lorentz|Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1853–1928), after whom the Lorentz group is named.]]\nIn [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''Lorentz group''' is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[Lorentz transformation]]s of [[Minkowski spacetime]], the [[classical field theory|classical]] and [[Quantum field theory|quantum]] setting for all (non-gravitational) [[physics|physical phenomena]]. The Lorentz group is named for the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]].\n\nFor example, the following laws, equations, and theories respect Lorentz symmetry:\n* The [[kinematics|kinematical laws]] of [[special relativity]]\n* [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's field equations]] in the theory of [[electromagnetism]]\n* The [[Dirac equation]] in the theory of the [[electron]]\n* The [[Standard model]] of particle physics\n\nThe Lorentz group expresses the fundamental [[symmetry]] of space and time of all known fundamental [[laws of science|laws of nature]]. In [[general relativity]] physics, in cases involving small enough regions of spacetime where gravitational variances are negligible, physical laws are Lorentz invariant in the same manner as that of special relativity physics.\n\n== Basic properties ==\nThe Lorentz group is a [[subgroup]] of the [[Poincaré group]]—the group of all [[Isometry#Generalizations|isometries]] of [[Minkowski spacetime]]. Lorentz transformations are, precisely, isometries that leave the origin fixed. Thus, the Lorentz group is an [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|isotropy subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of Minkowski spacetime. For this reason, the Lorentz group is sometimes called the '''homogeneous Lorentz group''' while the Poincaré group is sometimes called the ''inhomogeneous Lorentz group''. Lorentz transformations are examples of [[Linear map|linear transformation]]s; general isometries of Minkowski spacetime are [[affine transformation]]s.\nMathematically, the Lorentz group may be described as the [[generalized orthogonal group]] O(1,3), the [[matrix Lie group]] that preserves the [[quadratic form]]\n: <math> (t, x, y, z) \\mapsto t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2</math>\n\non '''R'''<sup>4</sup>. This quadratic form is, when put on matrix form (see [[classical group#O(p, q) and O(n) – the orthogonal groups|classical orthogonal group]]), interpreted in physics as the [[metric tensor]] of Minkowski spacetime.\n\nThe Lorentz group is a six-[[dimension]]al [[Compact space|noncompact]] [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[real Lie group]] that is not [[Connected space|connected]]. The four [[Connected component (topology)|connected component]]s are not [[simply connected]], but rather [[doubly connected]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}}</ref> The [[identity component]] (i.e., the component containing the identity element) of the Lorentz group is itself a group, and is often called the '''restricted Lorentz group''', and is denoted SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3). The restricted Lorentz group consists of those Lorentz transformations that preserve the [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of space and direction of time. The restricted Lorentz group has often been presented through a facility of [[biquaternion]] algebra.\n\nThe restricted Lorentz group arises in other ways in pure mathematics.  For example, it arises as the [[point symmetry group]] of a certain [[ordinary differential equation]]. This fact also has physical significance.\n\n===Connected components===\n[[File:World line.svg|300px|right|thumb|Light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension.]]\nBecause it is a [[Lie group]], the Lorentz group O(1,3) is both a group and admits a topological description as a [[smooth manifold]]. As a manifold, it has four connected components. Intuitively, this means that it consists of four topologically separated pieces.\n\nThe four connected components can be categorized by two transformation properties its elements have:\n*some elements are reversed under time-inverting Lorentz transformations, for example, a future-pointing [[timelike vector]] would be inverted to a past-pointing vector\n*some elements have orientation reversed by '''improper Lorentz transformations''', for example, certain [[vierbein]] (tetrads)\n\nLorentz transformations that preserve the direction of time are called '''{{Visible anchor|orthochronous}}'''. The subgroup of orthochronous transformations is often denoted O<sup>+</sup>(1,3). Those that preserve orientation are called '''proper''', and as linear transformations they have determinant +1.  (The improper Lorentz transformations have determinant −1.)  The subgroup of proper Lorentz transformations is denoted SO(1,3). \n\nThe subgroup of all Lorentz transformations preserving both orientation and direction of time is called the '''proper, orthochronous Lorentz group''' or '''restricted Lorentz group''', and is denoted by SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3). (Note that some authors refer to SO(1,3) or even O(1,3) when they actually mean SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3).)\n\nThe set of the four connected components can be given a group structure as the [[quotient group]] O(1,3)/SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3), which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]]. Every element in O(1,3) can be written as the [[semidirect product]] of a proper, orthochronous transformation and an element of the [[discrete group]]\n: {1, ''P'', ''T'', ''PT''}\n\nwhere ''P'' and ''T'' are the [[P-symmetry|space inversion]] and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] operators:\n: ''P'' = diag(1, −1, −1, −1)\n: ''T'' = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).\n\nThus an arbitrary Lorentz transformation can be specified as a proper, orthochronous Lorentz transformation along with a further two \nbits of information, which pick out one of the four connected components.  This pattern is typical of finite-dimensional Lie groups.\n\n== Restricted Lorentz group ==\nThe restricted Lorentz group is the [[identity component]] of the Lorentz group, which means that it consists of all Lorentz transformations that can be connected to the identity by a [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] curve lying in the group. The restricted Lorentz group is a connected [[normal subgroup]] of the full Lorentz group with the same dimension, in this case with dimension six.\n\nThe restricted Lorentz group is generated by ordinary [[coordinate rotation|spatial rotations]] and [[Lorentz boost]]s (which can be thought of as [[hyperbolic rotation]]s in a plane that includes a time-like direction). Since every proper, orthochronous Lorentz transformation can be written as a product of a rotation (specified by [[charts on SO(3)|3 real parameters]]) and a boost (also specified by 3 real parameters), it takes 6 real parameters to specify an arbitrary proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation. This is one way to understand why the restricted Lorentz group is six-dimensional.  (See also the [[#Lie_algebra|Lie algebra of the Lorentz group]].)\n\nThe set of all rotations forms a [[Lie subgroup]] isomorphic to the ordinary [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The set of all boosts, however, does ''not'' form a subgroup, since composing two boosts does not, in general, result in another boost. (Rather, a pair of non-colinear boosts is equivalent to a boost and a rotation, and this relates to [[Thomas rotation]].) A boost in some direction, or a rotation about some axis, generates a [[one-parameter subgroup]].\n\n===Surfaces of transitivity===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 = HyperboloidOfOneSheet.png\n | width1 = 150\n | caption1 = Hyperboloid of one sheet\n | image2 = DoubleCone.png\n | width2 = 178\n | caption2 = Common conical surface\n | image3 = HyperboloidOfTwoSheets.png\n | width3 = 150\n | caption3 = Hyperboloid of two sheets\n}}\nIf a group {{math|''G''}} acts on a space {{math|''V''}}, then a surface {{math|''S'' ⊂ ''V''}} is a '''surface of transitivity''' if {{math|''S''}} is invariant under {{math|''G''}}, i.e., {{math|∀''g'' ∈ ''G'', ∀''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''gs'' ∈ ''S'' }}, and for any two points {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''S''}} there is a {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} such that {{math|''gs''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''s''<sub>2</sub>}}. By definition of the Lorentz group, it preserves the quadratic form \n:<math>Q(x) = x_0^2 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - x_3^2.</math>\n\nThe surfaces of transitivity of the orthochronous Lorentz group {{math|''O''<sup>+</sup>(1, 3)}}, {{math|''Q''(''x'') {{=}} const.}} of spacetime are the following:<ref name=Gelfand_1>{{harvnb|Gelfand|Minlos|Shapiro|1963}}</ref>\n*{{math|''Q''(''x'') > 0, x<sub>0</sub> > 0}} is the upper branch of a [[hyperboloid]] of two sheets.\n*{{math|''Q''(''x'') > 0, x<sub>0</sub> < 0}} is the lower branch of this hyperboloid.\n*{{math|''Q''(''x'') {{=}} 0, x<sub>0</sub> > 0}} is the upper branch of the [[light cone]].\n*{{math|''Q''(''x'') {{=}} 0, x<sub>0</sub> < 0}} is the lower branch of the light cone.\n*{{math|''Q''(''x'') < 0}} is a hyperboloid of one sheet.\n*The origin {{math|x<sub>0</sub> {{=}} x<sub>1</sub> {{=}} x<sub>2</sub> {{=}} x<sub>3</sub> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThese surfaces are {{nowrap|{{math|3}}-dimensional}}, so the images are not faithful, but they are faithful for the corresponding facts about {{math|''O''<sup>+</sup>(1, 2)}}. For the full Lorentz group, the surfaces of transitivity are only four since the transformation {{math|''T''}} takes an upper branch of a hyperboloid (cone) to a lower one and vice versa. \n\nThese observations constitute a good starting point for finding all [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Infinite-dimensional representations|infinite-dimensional unitary representations]] of the Lorentz group, in fact, of the Poincaré group, using the method of [[induced representation]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Wigner|1939}}</ref> One begins with a \"standard vector\", one for each surface of transitivity, and then ask which subgroup preserves these vectors. These subgroups are called [[little group]]s by physicists. The problem is then essentially reduced to the easier problem of finding representations of the little groups. For example, a standard vector in one of the hyperbolas of two sheets could be suitably chosen as {{math|(''m'', 0, 0, 0)}}. For each {{math|''m'' ≠ 0}}, the vector pierces exactly one sheet. In this case the little group is {{math|SO(3)}}, the [[rotation group]], all of whose representations are known. The precise infinite-dimensional unitary representation under which a particle transforms is part of its classification. Not all representations can correspond to physical particles (as far as is known). Standard vectors on the one-sheeted hyperbolas would correspond to [[tachyon]]s. Particles on the light cone are [[photon]]s, and more hypothetically, [[graviton]]s. The \"particle\" corresponding to the origin is the vacuum.\n\n===Relation to the Möbius group===\n{{Group theory sidebar |top/lie}}\n{{see also|Algebra of physical space}}\n\nThe restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3) is [[isomorphic]] to the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,'''C'''), which is, in turn, isomorphic to the [[Möbius group]], the [[symmetry group]] of [[conformal geometry]] on the [[Riemann sphere]]. (This observation was utilized by [[Roger Penrose]] as the starting point of [[twistor theory]].)\n\nThis may be shown by constructing a [[surjective]] [[homomorphism]] of Lie groups from SL(2,'''C''') to SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3),  dubbed \nthe [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#The_covering_group_SL(2,_C)|'''spinor map''']].  It proceeds as follows.\n\nOne may define an action of SL(2,'''C''') on Minkowski spacetime by writing a point of spacetime as a two-by-two [[Hermitian matrix]] in the form\n: <math> X = \\begin{bmatrix} t + z & x - iy \\\\ x + iy & t - z \\end{bmatrix}=t 1\\!\\!1 +x\\sigma_x +y\\sigma_y+z\\sigma_z, </math>\nin terms of [[Pauli matrices]].\nThis (Weyl) presentation satisfies\n: <math> \\det \\, X = t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2. </math>\n\nTherefore, one has identified the space of Hermitian matrices (which is four-dimensional, as a ''real'' vector space) with Minkowski spacetime, in such a way that the [[determinant]] of a Hermitian matrix is the squared length of the corresponding vector in Minkowski spacetime.\nSL(2,'''C''') acts on the space of Hermitian matrices via\n: <math> X \\mapsto P X P^*  ~,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|P}}<sup>*</sup> is the [[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian transpose]] of {{mvar|P}}, and this action preserves the determinant.  \n\nTherefore, SL(2,'''C''') acts on Minkowski spacetime by (linear) isometries. This defines a map from SL(2,'''C''')  to the Lorentz group  SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3), and the map is evidently a [[homomorphism]]. This is the spinor map. \n\nThe [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of the spinor map is the two element subgroup ±''I'', and it happens that the map is surjective. By the [[isomorphism theorem#First isomorphism theorem|first isomorphism theorem]], the quotient group PSL(2,'''C''') = SL(2,'''C''') / {±''I''} is isomorphic to SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3).\n\n====Appearance of the night sky====\n{{Lie groups |other}}\nThis isomorphism has the consequence that Möbius transformations of the Riemann sphere represent the way that Lorentz transformations change the appearance of the night sky, as seen by an observer who is maneuvering at [[special relativity|relativistic]] velocities relative to the \"fixed stars\". \n\nSuppose the \"fixed stars\" live in Minkowski spacetime and are modeled by points on the celestial sphere. Then a given point on the celestial sphere can be associated with {{math|''ξ {{=}} u + iv''}}, a complex number that corresponds to the point on the [[Riemann sphere]], and can be identified with a [[null vector]] (a [[Minkowski_space#Causal_structure|light-like vector]]) in Minkowski space\n: <math> \\begin{bmatrix} u^2 + v^2 + 1 \\\\ 2u \\\\ -2v \\\\ u^2 + v^2 - 1 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nor, in the Weyl representation (the spinor map), the Hermitian matrix\n: <math> N = 2\\begin{bmatrix} u^2 + v^2 & u + iv \\\\ u - iv & 1 \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nThe set of real scalar multiples of this null vector, called a ''null line'' through the origin, represents a ''line of sight'' from an observer at a particular place and time (an arbitrary event we can identify with the origin of Minkowski spacetime) to various distant objects, such as stars. Then the points of the [[celestial sphere]] (equivalently, lines of sight) are identified with certain Hermitian matrices.\n\n===Conjugacy classes===\nBecause the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3) is isomorphic to the Möbius group PSL(2,'''C'''), its [[conjugacy classes]] also fall into five classes:\n* '''Elliptic''' transformations\n* '''Hyperbolic''' transformations\n* '''Loxodromic''' transformations\n* '''Parabolic''' transformations\n* The trivial '''identity''' transformation\n\nIn the article on [[Möbius transformation]]s, it is explained how this classification arises by considering the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of Möbius transformations in their action on the Riemann sphere, which corresponds here to [[null vector|null]] [[eigenspace]]s of restricted Lorentz transformations in their action on Minkowski spacetime.\n\nAn example of each type is given in the subsections below, along with the effect of the [[one-parameter subgroup]] it generates (e.g., on the appearance of the night sky).\n\nThe Möbius transformations are the [[conformal map|conformal transformations]] of the Riemann sphere (or celestial sphere).  Then conjugating with an arbitrary element of SL(2,'''C''') obtains the following examples of arbitrary elliptic, hyperbolic, loxodromic, and parabolic (restricted) Lorentz transformations, respectively. The effect on the '''flow lines''' of the corresponding one-parameter subgroups is to transform the pattern seen in the examples by some conformal transformation. For example, an elliptic Lorentz transformation can have any two distinct fixed points on the celestial sphere, but points still flow along circular arcs from one fixed point toward the other. The other cases are similar.\n\n====Elliptic====\nAn elliptic element of SL(2,'''C''') is\n: <math> P_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\theta\\right) & 0 \\\\\n   0                                 & \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\theta\\right)\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nand has fixed points {{mvar|ξ}} = 0, ∞.  Writing the action as {{math|''X'' ↦ ''P''<sub>1</sub> ''X P''<sub>1</sub>*}} and collecting terms, the spinor map converts this to the (restricted) Lorentz transformation\n: <math> Q_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0            & 0             & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\sin(\\theta) &  \\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0            & 0             & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\exp \\left(\\theta\n               \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 0 &  0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 &  0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 &  0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\\right) ~.\n</math>\n\nThis transformation then represents a rotation about the {{mvar|z}} axis, exp({{math|''iθJ<sub>z</sub>''}}).  The one-parameter subgroup it generates is obtained by taking {{mvar|θ}} to be a real variable, the rotation angle, instead of a constant. \n\nThe corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (except for the identity) all share the same two fixed points, the North and South poles.  The transformations move all other points around latitude circles so that this group yields a continuous counterclockwise rotation about the {{mvar|z}}  axis as {{mvar|θ}} increases. The ''angle doubling'' evident in the spinor map is a characteristic feature of ''spinorial double coverings''.\n\n====Hyperbolic====\nA hyperbolic element of SL(2,'''C''') is\n: <math> P_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{2}\\right) & 0 \\\\\n 0                                & \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\eta}{2}\\right)\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nand has fixed points {{mvar|ξ}} = 0, ∞.  Under stereographic projection from the Riemann sphere to the Euclidean plane, the effect of this Möbius transformation is a dilation from the origin. \n\nThe spinor map converts this to the Lorentz transformation\n: <math> Q_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\cosh(\\eta) & 0 & 0 & \\sinh(\\eta) \\\\\n    0            & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0            & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    \\sinh(\\eta) & 0 & 0 & \\cosh(\\eta)\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\exp \\left( \\eta \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    1 & 0 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\\right)~.\n</math>\n\nThis transformation represents a boost along the {{mvar|z}} axis with [[rapidity]] {{mvar|η}}. The one-parameter subgroup it generates is obtained by taking {{mvar|η}} to be a real variable, instead of a constant.  The corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (except for the identity) all share the same fixed points (the North and South poles), and they move all other points along [[longitude]]s away from the South pole and toward the North pole.\n\n====Loxodromic====\nA loxodromic element of SL(2,'''C''') is\n: <math> P_3 = P_2 P_1 = P_1 P_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\eta + i\\theta)\\right) & 0 \\\\\n  0                                              & \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\eta + i\\theta)\\right)\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nand has fixed points {{mvar|ξ}} = 0, ∞. The spinor map converts this to the Lorentz transformation\n: <math>Q_3 = Q_2 Q_1 = Q_1 Q_2. </math>\n\nThe one-parameter subgroup this generates is obtained by replacing ''β+iθ''  with any real multiple of this complex constant. (If  ''β, θ'' vary independently, then a ''two-dimensional'' [[abelian group|abelian subgroup]] is obtained, consisting of simultaneous rotations about the {{mvar|z}} axis and boosts along the {{mvar|z}}-axis; in contrast, the ''one-dimensional'' subgroup discussed here consists of those elements of this two-dimensional subgroup such that the '''rapidity''' of the boost and '''angle''' of the rotation have a ''fixed ratio''.)  \n\nThe corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (excepting the identity) all share the same two fixed points (the North and South poles).  They move all other points away from the South pole and toward the North pole (or vice versa), along a family of curves called [[Rhumb_line|'''loxodromes''']].  Each loxodrome spirals infinitely often around each pole.\n\n====Parabolic====\nA parabolic element of SL(2,'''C''') is\n: <math> P_4 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\alpha \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nand has the single fixed point {{mvar|ξ}} = ∞ on the Riemann sphere.  Under stereographic projection, it appears as an ordinary [[translation (geometry)|translation]] along the [[real axis]].  \n\nThe spinor map converts this to the matrix (representing a Lorentz transformation)\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   Q_4 &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n      1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\vert\\alpha\\vert^2 & \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha) & \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha) & -\\frac{1}{2}\\vert\\alpha\\vert^2  \\\\\n      \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha)         & 1                         & 0                         & -\\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha)      \\\\\n    -\\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha)          & 0                         & 1                         &  \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha)       \\\\\n     \\frac{1}{2}\\vert\\alpha\\vert^2      & \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha) & \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha) &  1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\vert\\alpha\\vert^2\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\\\[6pt]\n       &=  \\exp \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0                         & \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha) & \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha) &  0  \\\\\n     \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha) & 0                         & 0                         & -\\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha)      \\\\\n    -\\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha) & 0                         & 0                         &  \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha)            \\\\\n     0                         & \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha) & \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha) &  0\n  \\end{bmatrix} ~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis generates a two-parameter abelian subgroup, which is obtained by considering {{mvar|α}} a complex variable rather than a constant.  The corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (except for the identity transformation) move points along a family of circles that are all tangent at the North pole to a certain [[great circle]].  All points other than the North pole itself move along these circles. \n\nParabolic Lorentz transformations are often called '''null rotations'''. Since these are likely to be the least familiar of the four types of nonidentity Lorentz transformations (elliptic, hyperbolic, loxodromic, parabolic), it is illustrated here how to determine the effect of an example of a parabolic Lorentz transformation on Minkowski spacetime.  \n\nThe matrix given above yields the transformation\n: <math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} t \\\\ x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\n    \\begin{bmatrix} t     \\\\ x     \\\\ y     \\\\ z     \\end{bmatrix} + \\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha) \\;\n    \\begin{bmatrix} x     \\\\ t - z \\\\ 0     \\\\ x     \\end{bmatrix} + \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha) \\;\n    \\begin{bmatrix} y     \\\\ 0     \\\\ z - t \\\\ y     \\end{bmatrix} + \\frac{\\vert\\alpha\\vert^2}{2} \\;\n    \\begin{bmatrix} t - z \\\\ 0     \\\\ 0     \\\\ t - z \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nNow, without loss of generality, pick {{math|''Im(α)'' {{=}} 0}}. Differentiating this transformation with respect to the now real group parameter {{mvar|α}} and evaluating at ''α''=0 produces the corresponding vector field (first order linear partial differential operator),\n: <math> x\\, \\left( \\partial_t + \\partial_z \\right) + (t - z)\\, \\partial_x. </math>\n\nApply this to a function {{math|''f(t, x, y, z)''}}, and demand that it stays invariant, i.e., it is annihilated by this transformation.  The solution of the resulting first order linear partial differential equation can be expressed in the form\n: <math>f(t, x, y, z) = F\\left(y,\\, t - z,\\, t^2 - x^2 - z^2\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|F}} is an ''arbitrary'' smooth function.  The arguments of {{mvar|F}} give three ''rational invariants'' describing how points (events) move under this parabolic transformation, as they themselves do not move,\n: <math> y = c_1, ~~~~ t-z = c_2, ~~~~ t^2 - x^2 - z^2 = c_3. </math>\n\nChoosing real values for the constants on the right hand sides yields three conditions, and thus specifies a curve in Minkowski spacetime.  This curve is an orbit of the transformation. \n\nThe form of the rational invariants shows that these flowlines (orbits) have a simple description: suppressing the inessential coordinate {{mvar|y}}, each orbit is the intersection of a ''null plane'', {{math| ''t'' {{=}} ''z + c''<sub>2</sub>}}, with a ''hyperboloid'',  {{math|''t<sup>2</sup> − x<sup>2</sup> − z<sup>2</sup>'' {{=}} ''c<sub>3</sub>''}}.  The case {{mvar|c}}<sub>3</sub> = 0 has the hyperboloid degenerate to a light cone with the orbits becoming parabolas lying in corresponding null planes.\n\nA particular null line lying on the light cone is left ''invariant''; this corresponds to the unique (double) fixed point on the Riemann sphere mentioned above.  The other null lines through the origin are \"swung around the cone\" by the transformation.  Following the motion of one such null line as {{mvar|α}}  increases corresponds to following the motion of a point along one of the circular flow lines on the celestial sphere, as described above.\n\nA choice  {{math|''Re(α)'' {{=}} 0}} instead, produces similar orbits, now with the roles of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} interchanged.\n\nParabolic transformations lead to the gauge symmetry of massless particles (like [[photon]]s) with [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] |{{mvar|h}}| ≥ 1. In the above explicit example, a massless particle moving in the {{mvar|z}} direction, so with 4-momentum '''''P'''''=(''p'', 0, 0, ''p''), is not affected at all by the {{mvar|x}}-boost and {{mvar|y}}-rotation combination  {{math|''K<sub>x</sub> − J<sub>y</sub>''}} displayed above, in the \"little group\" of its motion. This is evident from the explicit transformation law discussed: like any light-like vector, '''''P''''' itself is now invariant, i.e., all traces or effects of {{mvar|α}} have disappeared.  {{mvar|c}}<sub>1</sub> = {{mvar|c}}<sub>2</sub> = {{mvar|c}}<sub>3</sub> = 0, in the special case discussed. (The other similar generator, {{math|''K<sub>y</sub>+J<sub>x</sub>''}} as well as it and  {{mvar|J}}<sub>''z''</sub> comprise altogether the little group of the lightlike vector, isomorphic to {{mvar|E}}(2).)\n\n== Lie algebra ==\n\nAs with any Lie group, a useful way to study many aspects of the Lorentz group is via its [[Lie algebra]]. Since the Lorentz group SO(1,3) is a [[Lie_group#Matrix_Lie_groups|matrix Lie group]], its Lie algebra so(1,3) is an algebra of matrices, which may be computed as<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Definition 3.18</ref>\n:<math>\\mathrm{so}(1,3) = \\left\\{4\\times 4\\, \\mathrm{matrices}\\, X \\mid e^{tX} \\in \\mathrm{SO}(1,3)\\,\\mathrm{for}\\,\\mathrm{all}\\, t\\right\\}</math>.\n\nIf <math>g</math> is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries <math>(-1, 1, 1, 1)</math>, then the Lie algebra o(1,3) consists of <math>4\\times 4</math> matrices <math>X</math> such that<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.25</ref>\n:<math>gXg = -X^T</math>.\n\nExplicitly, so(1,3) consists of <math>4\\times 4</math> matrices of the form\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n  0 &  a &  b & c \\\\\n  a &  0 &  d & e \\\\\n  b & -d &  0 & f \\\\\n  c & -e & -f & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>a, b, c, d, e, f</math> are arbitrary real numbers. This Lie algebra is six dimensional. The subalgebra of so(1,3) consisting of elements in which <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> equal zero is isomorphic to so(3).\n\nNote that the full Lorentz group O(1,3), the proper Lorentz group SO(1,3) and the proper orthochronous Lorentz group <math>\\mathrm{SO}^+(1,3)</math> all have the same Lie algebra, which is typically denoted so(1,3).\n\nSince the identity component of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to a finite quotient of SL(2,C) (see the section above on the connection of the Lorentz group to the Möbius group), the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to the Lie algebra sl(2,C). Note that sl(2,C) is three dimensional when viewed as a complex Lie algebra, but six dimensional when viewed as a real Lie algebra.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lorentz group can also be thought of as a subgroup of the [[diffeomorphism group]] of '''R'''<sup>4</sup> and therefore its Lie algebra can be identified with vector fields on '''R'''<sup>4</sup>. In particular, the vectors that generate isometries on a space are its [[Killing vector]]s, which provides a convenient alternative to the [[Maurer–Cartan_form#Intrinsic_construction|left-invariant vector field]] for calculating the Lie algebra. We can write down a set of six generators:\n* vector fields on '''R'''<sup>4</sup> generating three rotations ''i'' '''''J''''',\n*:<math>-y \\partial_x + x \\partial_y \\equiv i J_z ~, \\qquad  -z \\partial_y + y \\partial_z \\equiv iJ_x~, \\qquad -x \\partial_z + z \\partial_x \\equiv iJ_y ~;</math>\n* vector fields on '''R'''<sup>4</sup> generating three boosts ''i'' '''''K''''',\n*:<math>x \\partial_t + t \\partial_x\\equiv iK_x ~, \\qquad  y \\partial_t + t \\partial_y \\equiv iK_y ~, \\qquad z \\partial_t + t \\partial_z\\equiv  iK_z.</math>\n\nIt may be helpful to briefly recall here how to obtain a one-parameter group from a [[vector field]], written in the form of a first order [[linear]] [[partial differential operator]] such as\n: <math> -y \\partial_x + x \\partial_y. </math>\n\nThe corresponding initial value problem is\n: <math> \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\lambda} = -y, \\; \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\lambda} = x, \\; x(0) = x_0, \\; y(0) = y_0. </math>\n\nThe solution can be written\n: <math> x(\\lambda) = x_0 \\cos(\\lambda) - y_0 \\sin(\\lambda), \\; y(\\lambda) = x_0 \\sin(\\lambda) + y_0 \\cos(\\lambda) </math>\n\nor\n: <math> \\begin{bmatrix} t \\\\ x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0             &  0             & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\cos(\\lambda) & -\\sin(\\lambda) & 0 \\\\ \n    0 & \\sin(\\lambda) &  \\cos(\\lambda) & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0             &  0             & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix} t_0 \\\\ x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\\\ z_0 \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere we easily recognize the one-parameter matrix group of rotations exp(''i λ J<sub>z</sub>'') about the z axis.\n\nDifferentiating with respect to the group parameter {{mvar|λ}} and setting it ''λ''=0 in that result, we recover the standard matrix,\n: <math>iJ_z = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} ~,</math>\n\nwhich corresponds to the vector field we started with.  This illustrates how to pass between matrix and vector field representations of elements of the Lie algebra.\n\nReversing the procedure in the previous section, we see that the Möbius transformations that correspond to our six generators arise from exponentiating respectively  ''β''/2  (for the three boosts) or  ''iθ''/2 (for the three rotations) times the three [[Pauli matrices]]\n: <math>\n  \\sigma_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &  1 \\\\ 1 &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\;\\;\n  \\sigma_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\;\\;\n  \\sigma_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &  0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nFor our purposes, another generating set is more convenient.  The following table lists the six generators, in which\n* The first column gives a generator of the flow under the Möbius action (after stereographic projection from the Riemann sphere) as a ''real'' vector field on the Euclidean plane.\n* The second column gives the corresponding one-parameter subgroup of Möbius transformations.\n* The third column gives the corresponding one-parameter subgroup of Lorentz transformations (the image under our homomorphism of preceding one-parameter subgroup).\n* The fourth column gives the corresponding generator of the flow under the Lorentz action as a real vector field on Minkowski spacetime.\n\nNotice that the generators consist of\n* Two parabolics (null rotations)\n* One hyperbolic (boost in the ∂<sub>''z''</sub> direction)\n* Three elliptics (rotations about the ''x, y, z'' axes, respectively)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n!

We can readily express the result in terms of the generating set given in the table above.\n\nThe one-dimensional subalgebras of course correspond to the four conjugacy classes of elements of the Lorentz group:\n* <math>X_1</math> generates a one-parameter subalgebra of parabolics SO(0,1),\n* <math>X_3</math> generates a one-parameter subalgebra of boosts SO(1,1),\n* <math>X_4</math> generates a one-parameter of rotations SO(2),\n* <math>X_3 + a X_4</math> (for any <math>a \\neq 0</math>) generates a one-parameter subalgebra of loxodromic transformations.\n(Strictly speaking the last corresponds to infinitely many classes, since distinct <math>a</math> give different classes.)\nThe two-dimensional subalgebras are:\n* <math>X_1, X_2</math> generate an abelian subalgebra consisting entirely of parabolics,\n* <math>X_1, X_3</math> generate a nonabelian subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the affine group A(1),\n* <math>X_3, X_4</math> generate an abelian subalgebra consisting of boosts, rotations, and loxodromics all sharing the same pair of fixed points.\nThe three-dimensional subalgebras are:\n* <math>X_1,X_2,X_3</math> generate a '''Bianchi V''' subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of Hom(2), the group of ''euclidean homotheties'',\n* <math>X_1,X_2,X_4</math> generate a '''Bianchi VII_0''' subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of E(2), the [[euclidean group]],\n* <math>X_2,X_2,X_3 + a X_4</math>, where <math>a \\neq 0</math>, generate a '''Bianchi VII_a''' subalgebra,\n* <math>X_1,X_3,X_5</math> generate a '''Bianchi VIII''' subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of SL(2,'''R'''), the group of isometries of the [[Poincaré half-plane model|hyperbolic plane]],\n* <math>X_4,X_5,X_6</math> generate a '''Bianchi IX''' subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of SO(3), the rotation group.\n(Here, the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi types]] refer to the classification of three-dimensional Lie algebras by the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Bianchi]].)\nThe four-dimensional subalgebras are all conjugate to\n* <math>X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4</math> generate a subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of Sim(2), the group of Euclidean [[Similarity (geometry)|similitudes]].\n\nThe subalgebras form a lattice (see the figure), and each subalgebra generates by exponentiation a [[closed subgroup]] of the restricted Lie group.  From these, all subgroups of the Lorentz group can be constructed, up to conjugation, by multiplying by one of the elements of the Klein four-group.\n\n[[File:Lorentz group subalgebra lattice.png|300px|thumb|right|The lattice of subalgebras of the Lie algebra SO(1,3), up to conjugacy.]]\nAs with any connected Lie group, the coset spaces of the closed subgroups of the restricted Lorentz group, or [[homogeneous spaces]], have considerable mathematical interest. A few, brief descriptions:\n* The group Sim(2) is the stabilizer of a ''null line'', i.e., of a point on the Riemann sphere—so the homogeneous space SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3)/Sim(2) is the [[Kleinian geometry]] that represents [[conformal geometry]] on the sphere S.<sup>2</sup>\n* The (identity component of the) Euclidean group SE(2) is the stabilizer of a [[null vector]], so the homogeneous space SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3)/SE(2) is the [[momentum space]] of a massless particle; geometrically, this Kleinian geometry represents the ''degenerate'' geometry of the light cone in Minkowski spacetime.\n* The rotation group SO(3) is the stabilizer of a [[timelike vector]], so the homogeneous space SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3)/SO(3) is the [[momentum space]] of a massive particle; geometrically, this space is none other than three-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]] H<sup>3</sup>.\n\n== Covering groups ==\nIn [[#Relation to the Möbius group|a previous section]], we constructed a homomorphism {{nowrap|SL(2, '''C''') → SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3)}}, which we called the spinor map.  Since {{nowrap|SL(2,'''C''')}} is simply connected, it is the [[universal cover|covering group]] of the restricted Lorentz group {{nowrap|SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3)}}.  By restriction we obtain a homomorphism {{nowrap|SU(2) → SO(3)}}.  Here, the [[special unitary group]] SU(2), which is isomorphic to the group of unit [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] [[quaternion]]s, is also simply connected, so it is the covering group of the rotation group SO(3). Each of these [[covering map]]s are twofold covers in the sense that precisely two elements of the covering group map to each element of the quotient.  One often says that the restricted Lorentz group and the rotation group are '''doubly connected'''.  This means that the [[fundamental group]] of the each group is [[isomorphic]] to the two-element [[cyclic group]] Z<sub>2</sub>.\n\n(In applications to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(2, '''C''')}} is sometimes called the Lorentz group.)\n\nTwofold coverings are characteristic of [[spin group]]s.  Indeed, in addition to the double coverings\n: Spin<sup>+</sup>(1, 3) = SL(2, '''C''') → SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3)\n: Spin(3) = SU(2) → SO(3)\nwe have the double coverings\n: [[pin group|Pin(1, 3)]] → O(1, 3)\n: Spin(1, 3) → SO(1, 3)\n: Spin<sup>+</sup>(1, 2) = SU(1, 1) → SO(1, 2)\n\nThese spinorial [[Double covering group|double coverings]] are all closely related to [[Clifford algebras]].\n\n== Topology ==\nThe left and right groups in the double covering\n: SU(2) → SO(3)\nare [[deformation retract]]s of the left and right groups, respectively, in the double covering\n: SL(2,'''C''') → SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3).\nBut the homogeneous space SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3)/SO(3) is [[homeomorphic]] to [[hyperbolic 3-space]] H<sup>3</sup>, so we have exhibited the restricted Lorentz group as a [[fiber bundle|principal fiber bundle]] with fibers SO(3) and base H<sup>3</sup>.  Since the latter is homeomorphic to '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, while SO(3) is homeomorphic to three-dimensional [[real projective space]] '''R'''P<sup>3</sup>, we see that the restricted Lorentz group is ''locally'' homeomorphic to the product of '''R'''P<sup>3</sup> with '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  Since the base space is contractible, this can be extended to a global homeomorphism.\n\n== Generalization to higher dimensions ==\nThe concept of the Lorentz group has a natural generalization to spacetime of any number of dimensions. Mathematically, the Lorentz group of ''n''+1-dimensional Minkowski space is the group O(''n'',1) (or O(1,''n'')) of linear transformations of '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> that preserves the quadratic form\n: <math> (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n, x_{n+1}) \\mapsto x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2 - x_{n+1}^2.</math>\n\nMany of the properties of the Lorentz group in four dimensions (where {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}) generalize straightforwardly to arbitrary ''n''. For instance, the Lorentz group O(''n'',1) has four connected components, and it acts by conformal transformations on the celestial (''n''−1)-sphere in ''n''+1-dimensional Minkowski space. The identity component SO<sup>+</sup>(''n'',1) is an SO(''n'')-bundle over hyperbolic ''n''-space H<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nThe low-dimensional cases {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} are often useful as \"toy models\" for the physical case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, while higher-dimensional Lorentz groups are used in physical theories such as [[string theory]] that posit the existence of hidden dimensions. The Lorentz group O(''n'',1) is also the isometry group of ''n''-dimensional [[de Sitter space]] dS<sub>''n''</sub>, which may be realized as the homogeneous space O(''n'',1)/O(''n''−1,1). In particular O(4,1) is the isometry group of the [[de Sitter universe]] dS<sub>4</sub>, a cosmological model.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|style=\"padding-right:2em\"|\n*[[Lorentz transformation]]\n*[[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|Lorentz group representation theory]]\n*[[Poincaré group]]\n*[[Möbius group]]\n*[[Minkowski space]]\n*[[Biquaternion]]s\n|\n*[[Indefinite orthogonal group]]\n*[[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n*[[Center of mass (relativistic)|Relativistic center of mass]]\n*[[Special relativity]]\n*[[Symmetry in quantum mechanics]]\n|}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |authorlink=Emil Artin |author=Artin, Emil |title=Geometric Algebra |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=1957 |isbn=978-0-471-60839-4|title-link=Geometric Algebra }} ''See Chapter III'' for the orthogonal groups O(p,q).\n* {{cite book |author=Carmeli, Moshe |authorlink=Moshe_Carmeli |title=Group Theory and General Relativity, Representations of the Lorentz Group and Their Applications to the Gravitational Field |publisher=McGraw-Hill, New York |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-07-009986-9}} A canonical reference; ''see chapters 1–6'' for representations of the Lorentz group.\n* {{cite book |author=Frankel, Theodore |title=The Geometry of Physics (2nd Ed.) |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-53927-2}}  An excellent resource for Lie theory, fiber bundles, spinorial coverings, and many other topics.\n* {{Fulton-Harris}}  ''See Lecture 11'' for the irreducible representations of SL(2,'''C''').\n* {{citation |first1=I.M. |last1=Gelfand |first2=R.A. |last2=Minlos |first3=Z.Ya. |last3=Shapiro |title=Representations of the Rotation and Lorentz Groups and their Applications |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |year=1963 |authorlink1=Israel Gelfand |authorlink2=Robert Adol'fovich Minlos}}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}.\n* {{cite book |author=Hall, G.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margulis_lemma",
      "text": "In differential geometry, a subfield of [[mathematics]], the '''Margulis lemma''' (named after [[Grigory Margulis]]) is a result about [[discrete subgroup]]s of isometries of a [[Sectional curvature#Manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature|non-positively curved]] [[Riemannian manifold]]s (e.g. the [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic n-space]]). Roughly, it states that within a fixed radius, usually called the '''Margulis constant''', the structure of the orbits of such a group cannot be too complicated. More precisely, within this radius around a point all points in its orbit are in fact in the orbit of a [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]] subgroup (in fact a bounded finite number of such).\n\n== The Margulis lemma for manifolds of non-positive curvature ==\n\n=== Formal statement ===\n\nThe Margulis lemma can be formulated as follows.{{sfn|Ballmann|Gromov|Schroeder|loc=Theorem 9.5}}\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a [[Simply connected space|simply-connected]] manifold of non-positive bounded curvature. There exist constants <math>C, \\varepsilon>0</math> with the following property. For any discrete subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> of the group of isometries of <math>X</math> and any <math>x \\in X</math>, if <math>F_x</math> is the set:\n:<math> F_x = \\{ g \\in \\Gamma: d(x, gx) < \\varepsilon \\} </math>\nthen the subgroup generated by <math>F_x</math> contains a nilpotent subgroup of index less than <math>C</math>. Here <math>d</math> is the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] induced by the Riemannian metric.\n\nAn immediately equivalent statement can be given as follows: for any subset <math>F</math> of the isometry group, if it satisfies that: \n* there exists a <math>x \\in X</math> such that <math>\\forall g \\in F : d(x, gx) < \\varepsilon</math>; \n* the group <math>\\langle F \\rangle </math> generated by <math>F</math> is discrete\nthen <math>\\langle F \\rangle </math> contains a nilpotent subgroup of index <math>\\le C</math>.\n\n=== Margulis constants ===\n\nThe optimal constant <math>\\varepsilon</math> in the statement can be made to depend only on the dimension and the lower bound on the curvature; usually it is normalised so that the curvature is between -1 and 0. It is usually called the Margulis constant of the dimension.\n\nOne can also consider margulis constants for specific spaces. For example there has been an important effort to determine the Margulis constant of the hyperbolic spaces (of constant curvature -1). For example:\n*the optimal constant for the [[hyperbolic plane]] is equal to <math>2 \\mathrm{arcsinh} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac {2\\cos(2\\pi/7) - 1} {8\\cos(\\pi/7) + 7}} \\right) \\simeq 0.2629 </math>;<ref>{{cite journal | ref=harv | last=Yamada | first=A. | title=On Marden’s universal constant of Fuchsian groups | journal=Kodai Math.

In this case the Margulis lemma can be given the following, more algebraic formulation which dates back to [[Hans Zassenhaus]]. {{sfn|Raghunatan|1972|Definition 8.22}}\n\n:''If <math>G</math> is a semisimple Lie group there exists a neighbourhood <math>\\Omega</math> of the identity in <math>G</math> and a <math>C > 0</math> such that any discrete subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> which is generated by <math>\\Gamma \\cap \\Omega</math> contains a nilpotent subgroup of index <math>\\le C</math>. ''\n\nSuch a neighbourhood is called a '''Zassenhaus neighbourhood'''.\n\n== Thick-thin decomposition ==\n\nLet <math>M</math> be a Riemannian manifold and <math>\\varepsilon > 0</math>. The ''thin part'' of <math>M</math> is the subset of points <math>x \\in M</math> where the [[injectivity radius]] of <math>M</math> at <math>x</math> is less than <math>\\varepsilon</math>, usually denoted <math>M_{< \\varepsilon}</math>, and the ''thick part'' its complement, usually denoted <math>M_{\\ge \\varepsilon}</math>. There is a tautological decomposition into a disjoint union <math>M = M_{< \\varepsilon} \\cup M_{\\ge \\varepsilon}</math>.\n\nWhen <math>M</math> is of negative curvature and <math>\\varepsilon</math> is smaller than the Margulis constant for <math>\\widetilde M</Math> the structure of the components of the thin part is very simple. Let us restrict to the case of hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. Suppose that <math>\\varepsilon</math> is smaller than the Margulis constant for <math>\\mathbb H^n</math> and let <math>M</math> be a [[Hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic <math>n</math>-manifold]] of finite volume. Then its thin part has two sorts of components:{{sfn|Thurston|1998|loc=Chapter 4.5}}\n\n*[[Cusp neighbourhood|Cusps]]: these are the unbounded components, they are diffeomorphic to a [[Flat manifold|flat <math>(n-1)</math>-manifold]] times a line;\n*Margulis tubes: these are neighbourhoods of [[closed geodesic]]s of length <math>< \\varepsilon</math> on <math>M</math>. They are bounded and diffeomorphic to a circle times a <math>(n-1)</math>-disc.\n\nIn particular, a complete finite-volume hyperbolic manifold is always diffeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with (possibly empty boundary).\n\n== Other applications ==\n\nThe Margulis lemma is an important tool in the study of manifolds of negative curvature. Besides the thick-thin decomposition some other applications are:\n\n*The ''collar lemma'': this is a more precise version of the description of the compact components of the thin parts. It states that any closed geodesic of length <math>\\ell < \\varepsilon</math> on an hyperbolic surface is contained in an embedded cylinder of diameter of order <math>\\ell^{-1}</math>.\n*The Margulis lemma gives an immediate qualitative solution to the problem of minimal covolume among hyperbolic manifolds: since the volume of a Margulis tube can be seen to be bounded below by a constant depending only on the dimension, it follows that there exists a positive infimum to the volumes of hyperbolic ''n''-manifolds for any ''n''.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|p=666}}\n*The existence of Zassenhaus neighbourhoods is a key ingredient in the proof of the [[Kazhdan-Margulis theorem]].\n*One can recover the [[Jordan–Schur theorem]] as a corollary to the existence of Zassenhaus neighbourhoods.\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{cite book | ref=harv | last1=Ballmann | first1=Werner | last2=Gromov | first2=Mikhail | last3=Schroeder | first3=Viktor | title=Manifolds of Nonpositive Curvature | publisher=Birkhâuser | year=1985}}\n*{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Raghunathan | first=M.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = January 2019}}\n{{Short description|Matrix operation generalizing exponentiation of scalar numbers}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''matrix exponential''' is a [[matrix function]] on [[square matrix|square matrices]] analogous to the ordinary [[exponential function]]. It is used to solve systems of linear differential equations. In the theory of Lie groups, the matrix exponential gives the connection between a matrix [[Lie algebra]] and the corresponding [[Lie group]].\n\nLet {{mvar|X}}  be an {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The exponential of {{mvar|X}}, denoted by {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>}} or {{math|exp(''X'')}}, is the {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix given by the [[power series]]\n\n:<math>e^X = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty{1 \\over k!}X^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>X^0</math> is defined to be the identity matrix  <math>I</math> with the same dimensions as  <math>X</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Equation 2.1</ref>\n\nThe above series always converges, so the exponential of {{mvar|X}} is well-defined. If {{mvar|X}} is a 1×1 matrix the matrix exponential of {{mvar|X}} is a 1×1 matrix whose single element is the ordinary [[Exponential function|exponential]] of the single element of {{mvar|X}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Elementary properties ===\nLet {{math|''X''}} and  {{math|''Y''}}  be {{math|''n''×''n''}} complex matrices and let {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} be arbitrary complex numbers. We denote the {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[identity matrix]] by {{math|''I''}} and the [[zero matrix]] by 0. The matrix exponential satisfies the following properties.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 2.3</ref>\n\nWe begin with the properties that are immediate consequences of the definition as a power series:\n* {{math|''e''<sup>0</sup> {{=}} ''I''}}\n* {{math|exp(''X''<sup>T</sup>) {{=}} (exp ''X'')<sup>T</sup>}}, where {{math|''X''<sup>T</sup>}} denotes the [[transpose]] of {{math|''X''}}.\n* {{math|exp(''X''<sup>∗</sup>) {{=}} (exp ''X'')<sup>∗</sup>}}, where {{math|''X''<sup>∗</sup>}} denotes the [[conjugate transpose]] of {{math|''X''}}.\n* If {{math|''Y''}} is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] then {{math|''e''<sup>''YXY''<sup>−1</sup></sup> {{=}} ''Ye''<sup>''X''</sup>''Y''<sup>−1</sup>.}}\n\nThe next key result is this one:\n* If <math>XY=YX</math> then <math>e^Xe^Y=e^{X+Y}</math>.\n\nThe proof of this identity is the same as the standard power-series argument for the corresponding identity for the exponential of real numbers. That is to say, ''as long as <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> commute'', it makes no difference to the argument whether <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are numbers or matrices. It is important to note that this identity typically does not hold if <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> do not commute (see [[#Inequalities for exponentials of Hermitian matrices|Golden-Thompson inequality]] below).\n\nConsequences of the preceding identity are the following:\n* {{math|''e''<sup>''aX''</sup>''e''<sup>''bX''</sup> {{=}} ''e''<sup>(''a'' + ''b'')''X''</sup>}}\n* {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>''e''<sup>−''X''</sup> {{=}} ''I''}}\n\nUsing the above results, we can easily verify the following claims. If {{math|''X''}} is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] then {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>}} is also symmetric, and if {{math|''X''}} is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] then {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>}} is [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]]. If {{math|''X''}} is [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] then {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>}} is also Hermitian, and if {{math|''X''}} is [[skew-Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian]] then {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>}} is [[unitary matrix|unitary]].\n\nFinally, we have the following:\n* A [[Laplace transform]] of matrix exponentials amounts to the [[resolvent formalism|resolvent]],\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{-ts}e^{tX}\\,dt=(sI-X)^{-1}</math>\n:for all sufficiently large positive values of ''s''.\n\n=== Linear differential equation systems ===\n\n{{Main|Matrix differential equation}}\n\nOne of the reasons for the importance of the matrix exponential is that it can be used to solve systems of linear [[ordinary differential equations]].

This follows from the fact that the right hand side of the above equation is always non-zero, and so {{math|det(''e<sup>A</sup>'') ≠ 0}}, which implies that {{math|''e<sup>A</sup>''}} must be invertible.\n\nIn the real-valued case, the formula also exhibits the map\n:<math>\\exp \\colon M_n(\\mathbb R) \\to \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb R)</math>\nto not be [[surjective function|surjective]], in contrast to  the complex case mentioned earlier. This follows from the fact that, for real-valued matrices, the right-hand side of the formula  is always positive, while there exist invertible matrices with a negative determinant.\n\n== The exponential of sums ==\n\nFor any real numbers (scalars) {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} we know that the exponential function satisfies {{math|''e''<sup>''x''+''y''</sup> {{=}} ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> ''e''<sup>''y''</sup>}}.

(To see this, note that addition and multiplication, hence also exponentiation, of diagonal matrices is equivalent to element-wise addition and multiplication, and hence exponentiation; in particular, the \"one-dimensional\" exponentiation is felt element-wise for the diagonal case.)\n\n=== Nilpotent case ===\nA matrix ''N'' is [[nilpotent matrix|nilpotent]] if ''N''<sup>''q''</sup> = 0 for some integer ''q''.

In particular, the roots of {{mvar|P}} are simple, and the \"[[interpolation]]\" characterization indicates that {{math|''S<sub>t</sub>''}} is given by the [[Lagrange interpolation]] formula, so it is the  [[Sylvester's formula|Lagrange−Sylvester polynomial]] .\n\nAt the other extreme, if {{math| ''P'' {{=}}  ''(z−a)<sup>n</sup>''}}, then\n:<math>S_t=e^{at}\\ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\ \\frac{t^k}{k!}\\ (z-a)^k ~.</math>\nThe simplest case not covered by the above observations is when <math>P=(z-a)^2\\,(z-b)</math> with  {{math|''a'' ≠ ''b''}}, which yields\n:<math>S_t=e^{at}\\ \\frac{z-b}{a-b}\\ \\Bigg(1+\\left(t+\\frac{1}{b-a}\\right)(z-a)\\Bigg)+e^{bt}\\ \\frac{(z-a)^2}{(b-a)^2}\\quad.</math>\n\n== Evaluation by implementation of [[Sylvester's formula]] ==\nA practical, expedited computation of the above reduces to the following rapid steps.\nRecall from above that an ''n×n'' matrix  {{math|exp(''tA'')}} amounts to a linear combination of the first {{mvar|n}}−1 powers of {{mvar|A}}  by the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]].  For [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]] matrices, as illustrated above, e.g. in the 2×2 case,  [[Sylvester's formula]] yields  {{math|exp(''tA'') {{=}} ''B<sub>α</sub>'' exp(''tα'')+''B<sub>β</sub>'' exp(''tβ'')}}, where the {{mvar|B}}s are  the [[Frobenius covariant]]s of {{mvar|A}}.\n\nIt is easiest, however, to simply solve for these {{mvar|B}}s directly, by evaluating this expression and its first derivative at {{mvar|t}}=0, in terms of {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|I}},  to find  the same answer as above.\n\nBut this simple procedure also works for [[defective matrix|defective]] matrices, in a generalization due to Buchheim.<ref>Rinehart, R. F. (1955). \"The equivalence of definitions of a matric function\". ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', '''62''' (6), 395-414.</ref> This is illustrated here for a 4×4 example of a matrix which is ''not diagonalizable'', and the {{mvar|B}}s are not projection matrices.\n\nConsider\n:<math>A =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1/8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1/2 & 1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}  ~,\n</math>\nwith eigenvalues {{math| ''λ''<sub>1</sub>{{=}}3/4}}  and  {{math| ''λ''<sub>2</sub>{{=}}1}}, each with a\nmultiplicity of two.\n\nConsider the exponential of each eigenvalue multiplied by {{mvar|t}},   {{math|exp(''λ<sub>i</sub>t'')}}. Multiply each exponentiated eigenvalue by the corresponding undetermined coefficient matrix {{math|''B''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.  If the eigenvalues have an algebraic multiplicity greater than 1, then repeat the process,  but now multiplying by an extra factor of {{mvar|t}}  for each repetition, to ensure linear independence.\n\n(If one eigenvalue had a multiplicity of three, then there would be the three terms: <math>B_{i_1} e^{\\lambda_i t}, ~ B_{i_2} t e^{\\lambda_i t}, ~ B_{i_3} t^2 e^{\\lambda_i t} </math>. By contrast, when all eigenvalues are distinct, the {{mvar|B}}s are just the [[Frobenius covariant]]s, and solving for them as below just amounts to the inversion of the [[Vandermonde matrix]] of these 4 eigenvalues.)\n\nSum all such terms,  here four such,\n:<math>\ne^{A t} = B_{1_1} e^{\\lambda_1 t} + B_{1_2} t e^{\\lambda_1 t} + B_{2_1} e^{\\lambda_2 t} + B_{2_2} t e^{\\lambda_2 t} ,\n</math>\n:<math>\ne^{A t} = B_{1_1} e^{3/4 t} + B_{1_2} t e^{3/4 t} + B_{2_1} e^{1 t} + B_{2_2} t e^{1 t}\n</math>.\n\nTo solve for all of the unknown matrices  {{mvar|B}}  in terms of the first three powers of  {{mvar|A}} and the identity, one needs four equations, the above one providing one such at {{mvar|t}} =0.

      "title": "Maurer–Cartan form",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer%E2%80%93Cartan_form",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan form''' for a [[Lie group]] {{math|''G''}} is a distinguished [[differential form|differential one-form]] on {{math|''G''}} that carries the basic infinitesimal information about the structure of {{math|''G''}}. It was much used by [[Élie Cartan]] as a basic ingredient of his [[method of moving frames]], and bears his name together with that of [[Ludwig Maurer]].\n\nAs a one-form, the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form is peculiar in that it takes its values in the [[Lie algebra]] associated to the Lie group {{math|''G''}}.  The Lie algebra is identified with the [[tangent space]] of {{math|''G''}} at the identity, denoted {{math|T<sub>''e''</sub>''G''}}.  The Maurer&ndash;Cartan form {{math|''ω''}} is thus a one-form defined globally on {{math|''G''}} which is a linear mapping of the tangent space {{math|T<sub>''g''</sub>''G''}} at each {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} into {{math|T<sub>''e''</sub>''G''}}.  It is given as the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of a vector in {{math|T<sub>''g''</sub>''G''}} along the left-translation in the group:\n:<math>\\omega(v) = (L_{g^{-1}})_* v,\\quad v\\in T_gG.</math>\n\n==Motivation and interpretation==\n{{see also|Lie group action}}\nA Lie group acts on itself by multiplication under the mapping\n:<math>G\\times G \\ni (g,h) \\mapsto gh \\in G.</math>\nA question of importance to Cartan and his contemporaries was how to identify a [[principal homogeneous space]] of {{math|''G''}}. That is, a [[manifold]] {{math|''P''}} identical to the group {{math|''G''}}, but without a fixed choice of unit element.  This motivation came, in part, from [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen programme]] where one was interested in a notion of [[symmetry]] on a space, where the symmetries of the space were [[transformation group|transformation]]s forming a Lie group.  The geometries of interest were [[homogeneous space]]s {{math|''G''/''H''}}, but usually without a fixed choice of origin corresponding to the [[coset]] {{math|''eH''}}.\n\nA principal homogeneous space of {{math|''G''}} is a manifold {{math|''P''}} abstractly characterized by having a [[Group action (mathematics)|free and transitive action]] of {{math|''G''}} on {{math|''P''}}.  The '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan form'''<ref>Introduced by Cartan (1904).</ref> gives an appropriate ''infinitesimal'' characterization of the principal homogeneous space.  It is a one-form defined on {{math|''P''}} satisfying an [[integrability condition]] known as the Maurer&ndash;Cartan equation.  Using this integrability condition, it is possible to define the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] of the Lie algebra and in this way obtain, locally, a group action on {{math|''P''}}.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Intrinsic construction===\nLet {{math|'''g''' ≅ T<sub>''e''</sub>''G''}} be the tangent space of a Lie group {{math|''G''}} at the identity (its [[Lie algebra]]). {{math|''G''}} acts on itself by left translation\n:<math> L : G \\times G \\to G</math>\nsuch that for a given {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} we have\n\n:<math> L_g : G \\to G \\quad \\mbox{where} \\quad L_g(h) = gh,</math>\n\nand this induces a map of the [[tangent bundle]] to itself:\n<math>(L_g)_*:T_hG\\to T_{gh}G.</math>\nA left-invariant [[vector field]] is a section {{math|''X''}} of {{math|T''G''}} such that <ref>Subtlety: <math>(L_g)_{*}X </math> gives a vector in <math> T_{gh}G \\text{ if } X\\in T_h G</math></ref>\n\n:<math>(L_g)_{*}X = X \\quad \\forall g \\in G.</math>\n\nThe '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan form''' {{math|''ω''}} is a {{math|'''g'''}}-valued one-form on {{math|''G''}} defined on vectors {{math|''v'' ∈ T<sub>''g''</sub>''G''}} by the formula\n\n: <math>\\omega_g(v)=(L_{g^{-1}})_*v.</math>\n\n===Extrinsic construction===\n\nIf {{math|''G''}} is embedded in {{math|GL(''n'')}} by a matrix valued mapping {{math|''g'' {{=}}(''g''<sub>''ij''</sub>)}}, then one can write {{math|''ω''}} explicitly as\n\n:<math>\\omega_g = g^{-1} \\,dg.</math>\n\nIn this sense, the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form is always the left [[logarithmic derivative]] of the identity map of {{math|''G''}}.\n\n===Characterization as a connection===\nIf we regard the Lie group {{math|''G''}} as a [[principal bundle]] over a manifold consisting of a single point then the Maurer–Cartan form can also be characterized abstractly as the unique [[connection (principal bundle)|principal connection]] on the principal bundle {{math|''G''}}. Indeed, it is the unique {{math|'''g''' {{=}} T<sub>''e''</sub>''G''}} valued {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''G''}} satisfying\n\n:# <math>\\omega_e = \\mathrm{id} : T_eG\\rightarrow {\\mathfrak g},\\text{ and}</math>\n:# <math>\\forall g \\in G \\quad \\omega_g = \\mathrm{Ad}(h)(R_h^*\\omega_e),\\text{ where }h=g^{-1},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''R''<sub>''h''</sub>*}} is the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of forms along the right-translation in the group and {{math|Ad(''h'')}} is the [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint action]] on the Lie algebra.\n\n==Properties==\nIf {{math|''X''}} is a left-invariant vector field on {{math|''G''}}, then {{math|''ω''(''X'')}} is constant on {{math|''G''}}. Furthermore, if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are both left-invariant, then\n\n:<math>\\omega([X,Y])=[\\omega(X),\\omega(Y)]</math>\n\nwhere the bracket on the left-hand side is the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]], and the bracket on the right-hand side is the bracket on the Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}}.  (This may be used as the definition of the bracket on {{math|'''g'''}}.)  These facts may be used to establish an isomorphism of Lie algebras\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{g}=T_eG\\cong \\{\\hbox{left-invariant vector fields on G}\\}.</math>\n\nBy the definition of the [[exterior derivative]], if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are arbitrary vector fields then\n\n:<math>d\\omega(X,Y)=X(\\omega(Y))-Y(\\omega(X))-\\omega([X,Y]).</math>\n\nHere {{math|''ω''(''Y'')}} is the {{math|'''g'''}}-valued function obtained by duality from pairing the one-form {{math|''ω''}} with the vector field {{math|''Y''}}, and {{math|''X''(''ω''(''Y''))}} is the [[Lie derivative]] of this function along {{math|''X''}}. Similarly {{math|''Y''(''ω''(''X''))}} is the Lie derivative along {{math|''Y''}} of the {{math|'''g'''}}-valued function {{math|''ω''(''X'')}}.\n\nIn particular, if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are left-invariant, then\n\n:<math>X(\\omega(Y))=Y(\\omega(X))=0,</math>\n\nso\n\n:<math>d\\omega(X,Y)+[\\omega(X),\\omega(Y)]=0</math>\n\nbut the left-invariant fields span the tangent space at any point (the push-forward of a basis in {{math|T<sub>''e''</sub>''G''}} under a diffeomorphism is still a basis), so the equation is true for any pair of vector fields {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}}.  This is known as the '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan equation'''.  It is often written as\n\n:<math>d\\omega + \\frac{1}{2}[\\omega,\\omega]=0.</math>\n\nHere {{math|[ω, ω]}} denotes the [[bracket of Lie algebra-valued forms]].\n\n==Maurer&ndash;Cartan frame==\nOne can also view the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form as being constructed from a '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan frame'''.  Let {{math|''E''<sub>i</sub>}} be a [[vector space basis|basis]] of sections of {{math|T''G''}} consisting of left-invariant vector fields, and {{math|''θ''<sup>''j''</sup>}} be the [[dual basis]] of sections of {{math|T<sup>*</sup>''G''}} such that {{math|''θ''<sup>''j''</sup>(''E''<sub>''i''</sub>) {{=}} ''δ''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''j''</sup>}}, the [[Kronecker delta]].  Then {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a Maurer&ndash;Cartan frame, and {{math|''θ''<sup>''i''</sup>}} is a '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan coframe'''.\n\nSince {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is left-invariant, applying the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form to it simply returns the value of {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} at the identity. Thus {{math|''ω''(''E''<sub>''i''</sub>) {{=}} ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e'') ∈ '''g'''}}.  Thus, the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form can be written\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\omega=\\sum_iE_i(e)\\otimes\\theta^i.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nSuppose that the Lie brackets of the vector fields {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are given by\n:<math>[E_i,E_j]=\\sum_k{c_{ij}}^kE_k.</math>\nThe quantities {{math|''c''<sub>''ij''</sub><sup>''k''</sup>}} are the [[structure constant]]s of the Lie algebra (relative to the basis {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}}).  A simple calculation, using the definition of the exterior derivative {{math|''d''}}, yields\n:<math>d\\theta^i(E_j,E_k) = -\\theta^i([E_j,E_k]) = -\\sum_r {c_{jk}}^r\\theta^i(E_r) = -{c_{jk}}^i = -\\frac{1}{2}({c_{jk}}^i - {c_{kj}}^i),</math>\nso that by duality\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>d\\theta^i=-\\frac12 \\sum_{jk} {c_{jk}}^i\\theta^j\\wedge\\theta^k.</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\nThis equation is also often called the '''Maurer&ndash;Cartan equation'''.  To relate it to the previous definition, which only involved the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form {{math|''ω''}}, take the exterior derivative of {{EquationNote|(1)}}:\n:<math>d\\omega = \\sum_i E_i(e)\\otimes d\\theta^i\\,=\\,-\\frac12 \\sum_{ijk}{c_{jk}}^iE_i(e)\\otimes\\theta^j\\wedge\\theta^k.</math>\nThe frame components are given by\n:<math>d\\omega(E_j,E_k) = -\\sum_i {c_{jk}}^iE_i(e) = -[E_j(e),E_k(e)]=-[\\omega(E_j),\\omega(E_k)],</math>\nwhich establishes the equivalence of the two forms of the Maurer&ndash;Cartan equation.\n\n==On a homogeneous space==\nMaurer&ndash;Cartan forms play an important role in Cartan's [[method of moving frames]].  In this context, one may view the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form as a {{nowrap|{{math|1}}-form}} defined on the tautological [[principal bundle]] associated to a [[homogeneous space]].  If {{math|''H''}} is a [[closed subgroup]] of {{math|''G''}}, then {{math|''G''/''H''}} is a smooth manifold of dimension  {{math|dim ''G'' − dim ''H''}}.  The quotient map {{math|''G'' → ''G''/''H''}} induces  the structure of an {{math|''H''}}-principal bundle over {{math|''G''/''H''}}.  The Maurer&ndash;Cartan form on the Lie group {{math|''G''}} yields a flat [[Cartan connection]] for this principal bundle. In particular, if {{math|''H'' {{=}} <nowiki/>{''e''<nowiki/>}}}, then this Cartan connection is an ordinary [[connection form]], and we have\n:<math>d\\omega+\\omega\\wedge\\omega=0</math>\nwhich is the condition for the vanishing of the curvature.\n\nIn the method of moving frames, one sometimes considers a local section of the tautological bundle, say {{math|''s'' : ''G''/''H'' → ''G''}}.  (If working on a [[submanifold]] of the homogeneous space, then {{math|''s''}} need only be a local section over the submanifold.)  The [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form along {{math|''s''}} defines a non-degenerate {{math|'''g'''}}-valued {{math|1}}-form {{math|''θ'' {{=}} ''s''<sup>*</sup>''ω''}} over the base.  The Maurer&ndash;Cartan equation implies that\n:<math>d\\theta + \\frac{1}{2}[\\theta,\\theta]=0.</math>\n\nMoreover, if {{math|''s''<sub>''U''</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>''V''</sub>}} are a pair of local sections defined, respectively, over open sets {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''V''}}, then they are related by an element of {{math|''H''}} in each fibre of the bundle:\n:<math>h_{UV}(x) = s_V\\circ s_U^{-1}(x),\\quad x \\in U \\cap V.</math>\nThe differential of {{math|''h''}} gives a compatibility condition relating the two sections on the overlap region:\n:<math>\\theta_V = \\operatorname{Ad}(h^{-1}_{UV})\\theta_U + (h_{UV})^* \\omega_H </math>\nwhere {{math|''ω''<sub>''H''</sub>}} is the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form on the group {{math|''H''}}.\n\nA system of non-degenerate {{math|'''g'''}}-valued {{math|1}}-forms {{math|''θ''<sub>''U''</sub>}} defined on open sets in a manifold {{math|''M''}}, satisfying the Maurer&ndash;Cartan structural equations and the compatibility conditions endows the manifold {{math|''M''}} locally with the structure of the homogeneous space {{math|''G''/''H''}}.  In other words, there is locally a [[diffeomorphism]] of {{math|''M''}} into the homogeneous space, such that {{math|''θ''<sub>''U''</sub>}} is the pullback of the Maurer&ndash;Cartan form along some section of the tautological bundle.  This is a consequence of the existence of primitives of the [[Darboux derivative]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|first = Élie|last = Cartan|title = Sur la structure des groupes infinis de transformations|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|year = 1904|volume = 21|pages=153–206|url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/ASENS_1904_3_21__153_0.pdf}}\n* {{cite book|author=R.

      "title": "Maximal compact subgroup",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_compact_subgroup",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''maximal compact subgroup''' ''K'' of a [[topological group]] ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] ''K'' that is a [[compact space]], in the [[subspace topology]], and [[maximal element|maximal]] amongst such subgroups.\n\nMaximal compact subgroups play an important role in the classification of Lie groups and especially semi-simple Lie groups. Maximal compact subgroups of Lie groups are ''not'' in general unique, but are unique up to [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugation]] – they are [[essentially unique]].\n\n==Example==\nAn example would be the subgroup O(2), the [[orthogonal group]], inside the [[general linear group]] GL(2, '''R'''). A related example is the [[circle group]] SO(2) inside [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]]. Evidently SO(2) inside GL(2, '''R''') is compact and not maximal. The non-uniqueness of these examples can be seen as any [[inner product]] has an associated orthogonal group, and the essential uniqueness corresponds to the essential uniqueness of the inner product.\n\n==Definition==\nA maximal compact subgroup is a maximal subgroup amongst compact subgroups – a ''maximal (compact subgroup)'' – rather than being (alternate possible reading) a [[maximal subgroup]] that happens to be compact; which would probably be called a ''compact (maximal subgroup)'', but in any case is not the intended meaning (and in fact maximal proper subgroups are not in general compact).\n\n==Existence and uniqueness==\nThe '''Cartan-Iwasawa-Malcev theorem''' asserts that every connected Lie group (and indeed every connected locally compact group) admits maximal compact subgroups and that they are all conjugate to one another. For a [[semisimple Lie group]] uniqueness is a consequence of the '''[[Cartan fixed point theorem]]''', which asserts that if a compact group acts by isometries on a complete simply connected [[negative curvature|negatively curved]] [[Riemannian manifold]] then it has a fixed point.\n\nMaximal compact subgroups of connected Lie groups are usually ''not'' unique, but they are unique up to conjugation, meaning that given two maximal compact subgroups ''K'' and ''L'', there is an element ''g'' ∈ ''G'' such that<ref>Note that this element ''g'' is not unique – any element in the same coset ''gK'' would do as well.</ref> ''gKg''<sup>−1</sup> = ''L'' – hence a maximal compact subgroup is [[essentially unique]], and people often speak of \"the\" maximal compact subgroup.\n\nFor the example of the general linear group GL(''n'', '''R'''), this corresponds to the fact that ''any'' [[inner product]] on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> defines a (compact) orthogonal group (its isometry group) – and that it admits an orthonormal basis: the change of basis defines the conjugating element conjugating the isometry group to the classical orthogonal group O(''n'', '''R''').\n\n===Proofs===\nFor a real semisimple Lie group, Cartan's proof of the existence and uniqueness of a maximal compact subgroup can be found in {{harvtxt|Borel|1950}} and {{harvtxt|Helgason|1978}}. {{harvtxt|Cartier|1955}} and {{harvtxt|Hochschild|1965}} discuss the extension to connected Lie groups and connected locally compact groups.\n\nFor semisimple groups, existence is a consequence of the existence of a compact [[Complexification (Lie group)|real form]] of the noncompact semisimple Lie group and the corresponding [[Cartan decomposition]]. The proof of uniqueness relies on the fact that the corresponding [[Riemannian symmetric space]] ''G''/''K''  has [[negative curvature]] and \nCartan's fixed point theorem. {{harvtxt|Mostow|1955}} showed that the derivative of the exponential map at any point of ''G''/''K'' satisfies |d exp ''X''| ≥ |X|. This implies that ''G''/''K'' is a [[Hadamard space]], i.e. a [[complete metric space]] satisfying a weakened form of the parallelogram rule in a Euclidean space. Uniqueness can then be deduced from the [[Bruhat-Tits fixed point theorem]]. Indeed, any bounded closed set in a Hadamard space is contained in a unique smallest closed ball, the center of which is called its [[circumcenter]]. In particular a compact group acting by isometries must fix the circumcenter of each of its orbits.\n\n===Proof of uniqueness for semisimple groups===\n{{harvtxt|Mostow|1955}} also related the general problem for semisimple groups to the case of GL(''n'', '''R'''). The corresponding symmetric space is the space of positive symmetric matrices. A direct proof of uniqueness relying on elementary properties of this space is given in {{harvtxt|Hilgert|Neeb|2012}}.\n\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a real semisimple Lie algebra with [[Cartan involution]] σ. Thus the [[fixed point subgroup]] of σ is the maximal compact subgroup ''K'' and there is an eigenspace decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus \\mathfrak{p},}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace. The Cartan decomposition gives\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G=K\\cdot \\exp \\mathfrak{p} = K\\cdot P = P\\cdot K.}</math>\n\nIf ''B'' is the [[Killing form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> given by ''B''(''X'',''Y'') = Tr (ad X)(ad Y), then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{(X,Y)_\\sigma=-B(X,\\sigma(Y))}</math>\n\nis a real inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. Under the adjoint representation, ''K'' is the subgroup of ''G'' that preserves this inner product.\n\nIf ''H'' is another compact subgroup of ''G'', then averaging the inner product over ''H'' with respect to the Haar measure gives an inner product invariant under ''H''. The operators Ad ''p'' with ''p'' in ''P'' are positive symmetric operators. This new inner produst can be written as\n\n:<math>(S\\cdot X,Y)_\\sigma,</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is a positive symmetric operator on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> such that \nAd(''h'')<sup>''t''</sup>''S'' Ad ''h'' = ''S'' for ''h'' in ''H'' (with the transposes computed with respect to the inner product). Moreover, for ''x'' in ''G'',\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{Ad}\\, \\sigma(x)=(\\mathrm{Ad}\\,(x)^{-1})^t.}</math>\n\nSo for ''h'' in ''H'',\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{S\\circ \\mathrm{Ad}(\\sigma(h))= \\mathrm{Ad}(h)\\circ S.}</math>\n\nFor ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> define\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{f(e^X)=\\mathrm{Tr}\\, \\mathrm{Ad}(e^X) S.}</math>\n\nIf ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for ''S'' with ''Se''<sub>''i''</sub> = λ<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{f(e^X)=\\sum \\lambda_i (\\mathrm{Ad}(e^X)e_i,e_i)_\\sigma \\ge (\\min \\lambda_i)\\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}\\,e^{\\mathrm{ad}\\,X},}</math>\n\nso that ''f'' is strictly positive and tends to ∞ as |''X''| tends to ∞. In fact this norm is equivalent to the operator norm on the symmetric operators ad ''X'' and each non-zero eigenvalue occurs with its negative, since i ad ''X'' is a ''skew-adjoint operator'' on the compact real form <math>\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus i\\mathfrak{p}</math>.\n\nSo ''f'' has a global minimum at ''Y'' say. This minimum is unique, because if ''Z'' were another then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{e^Z=e^{Y/2} e^X e^{Y/2},}</math>\n\nwhere ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is defined by the Cartan decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{e^{Z/2}e^{-Y/2}=k\\cdot e^{X/2}.}</math>\n\nIf ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of ad ''X'' with corresponding real eigenvalues μ<sub>''i''</sub>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{g(t)= f(e^{Y/2} e^{tX} e^{Y/2})= \\sum e^{\\mu_i t} \\|Ad(e^{Y/2})f_i\\|^2_\\sigma.}</math>\n\nSince the right hand side is a positive combination of exponentials, the real-valued function ''g'' is [[strictly convex]] if ''X'' ≠ 0, so has a unique minimum. On the other hand, it has local minima at ''t'' = 0 and ''t'' = 1, hence ''X'' = 0 and ''p'' = exp ''Y'' is the unique global minimum. By construction\n''f''(''x'') = ''f''(σ(''h'')''xh''<sup>−1</sup>) for ''h'' in ''H'', so that ''p'' = σ(''h'')''ph''<sup>−1</sup> for ''h'' in ''H''. Hence σ(''h'')= ''php''<sup>−1</sup>. Consequently, if ''g'' = exp ''Y''/2, ''gHg''<sup>−1</sup> is fixed by σ and therefore lies in ''K''.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Representation theory===\nMaximal compact subgroups play a basic role in the [[representation theory]] when ''G'' is not compact. In that case a maximal compact subgroup ''K'' is a [[compact Lie group]] (since a closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group), for which the theory is easier.\n\nThe operations relating the representation theories of ''G'' and ''K'' are [[Restricted representation|restricting representations]] from ''G'' to ''K'', and [[induced representation|inducing representations]] from ''K'' to ''G'', and these are quite well understood; their theory includes that of [[Zonal spherical function|spherical function]]s.\n\n===Topology===\nThe [[algebraic topology]] of the Lie groups is also largely carried by a maximal compact subgroup ''K''. To be precise, a connected Lie group is a topological product (though not a group theoretic product) of a maximal compact ''K'' and a Euclidean space – ''G'' = ''K'' × '''R'''<sup>''d''</sup> – thus in particular ''K'' is a [[deformation retract]] of ''G,'' and is [[homotopy equivalent]], and thus they have the same [[homotopy groups]]. Indeed, the inclusion <math>K \\hookrightarrow G</math> and the deformation retraction <math>G \\twoheadrightarrow K</math> are [[homotopy equivalence]]s.\n\nFor the general linear group, this decomposition is the [[QR decomposition]], and the deformation retraction is the [[Gram-Schmidt process]]. For a general semisimple Lie group, the decomposition is the [[Iwasawa decomposition]] of ''G'' as ''G'' = ''KAN'' in which ''K'' occurs in a product with a [[contractible]] subgroup ''AN''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hyperspecial subgroup]]\n*[[Complex Lie group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Borel|first= Armand|title=Sous-groupes compacts maximaux des groupes de Lie (Exposé No. 33)|series= Séminaire Bourbaki|volume=1|year=1950|url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=SB_1948-1951__1__271_0}}\n*{{citation|last=Cartier|first=P.|title= \nStructure topologique des groupes de Lie généraux (Exposé No. 22)|series= Séminaire \"Sophus Lie\"|volume= 1|year=1955|url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=SSL_1954-1955__1__A24_0}}\n*{{citation|last=Dieudonné|first= J.|series =Treatise on analysis|title=Compact Lie groups and semisimple Lie groups, Chapter XXI|volume=5|publisher=Academic Press|year= 1977|isbn= 012215505X}}\n* {{citation|first=Sigurdur|last=Helgason|title=Differential Geometry, Lie groups and Symmetric Spaces|publisher=Academic Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-12-338460-7}}\n*{{citation|title=Structure and geometry of Lie groups|series=Springer monographs in mathematics|\nlast=Hilgert|first=Joachim|first2= Karl-Hermann|last2= Neeb|publisher=Springer|year= 2012|\nisbn=0387847944}}\n*{{citation|last=Hochschild|first=G.|title=The structure of Lie groups|year=1965|publisher=Holden-Day}}\n*{{citation|last=Mostow|first= G.

      "text": "In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[compact Lie group]]s a special role is played by torus subgroups, in particular by the '''maximal torus''' subgroups.\n\nA '''torus''' in a compact [[Lie group]] ''G'' is a [[compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]], [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie subgroup]] of ''G'' (and therefore isomorphic to<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.2</ref> the standard torus '''T'''<sup>''n''</sup>). A '''maximal torus''' is one which is maximal among such subgroups. That is, ''T'' is a maximal torus if for any torus ''T''&prime; containing ''T'' we have ''T'' = ''T''&prime;. Every torus is contained in a maximal torus simply by [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensional]] considerations. A noncompact Lie group need not have any nontrivial tori (e.g. '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>).\n\nThe dimension of a maximal torus in ''G'' is called the '''rank''' of ''G''. The rank is [[well-defined]] since all maximal tori turn out to be [[conjugate (group theory)|conjugate]]. For [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] groups the rank is equal to the number of nodes in the associated [[Dynkin diagram]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe [[unitary group]] U(''n'') has as a maximal torus the subgroup of all [[diagonal matrices]]. That is,\n: <math>T = \\left\\{\\operatorname{diag}\\left(e^{i\\theta_1},e^{i\\theta_2},\\dots,e^{i\\theta_n}\\right) : \\forall j, \\theta_j \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}.</math>\n''T'' is clearly isomorphic to the product of ''n'' circles, so the unitary group U(''n'') has rank ''n''. A maximal torus in the [[special unitary group]] SU(''n'') ⊂ U(''n'') is just the intersection of ''T'' and SU(''n'') which is a torus of dimension&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\nA maximal torus in the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(2''n'') is given by the set of all simultaneous [[rotation]]s in any fixed choice of ''n'' pairwise orthogonal planes (i.e., two dimensional vector spaces). Concretely, the maximal torus consists of all block-diagonal matrices with <math>2\\times 2</math> diagonal blocks, where each diagonal block is a rotation matrix.\nThis is also a maximal torus in the group SO(2''n''+1) where the action fixes the remaining direction. Thus both SO(2''n'') and SO(2''n''+1) have rank ''n''. For example, in the [[rotation group SO(3)]] the maximal tori are given by rotations about a fixed axis.\n\nThe [[symplectic group]] Sp(''n'') has rank ''n''. A maximal torus is given by the set of all diagonal matrices whose entries all lie in a fixed complex subalgebra of [[Quaternion|'''H''']].\n\n==Properties==\nLet ''G'' be a compact, connected Lie group and let <math>\\mathfrak g</math> be the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G''. The first main result is the torus theorem, which may be formulated as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Lemma 11.12</ref>\n:'''Torus theorem''':  If ''T'' is one fixed maximal torus in ''G'', then every element of ''G'' is conjugate to an element of ''T''. \nThis theorem has the following consequences:\n* All maximal tori in ''G'' are conjugate.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.9</ref> \n* All maximal tori have the same dimension, known as the ''rank'' of ''G''.\n* A maximal torus in ''G'' is a maximal abelian subgroup, but the converse need not hold.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.36 and Exercise 11.5</ref>\n* The maximal tori in ''G'' are exactly the Lie subgroups corresponding to the maximal abelian subalgebras of <math>\\mathfrak g</math><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 11.7</ref> (cf. [[Cartan subalgebra]])\n* Every element of ''G'' lies in some maximal torus; thus, the [[Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)|exponential map]] for ''G'' is surjective.\n* If ''G'' has dimension ''n'' and rank ''r'' then ''n'' &minus; ''r'' is even.\n\n==Root system==\nIf ''T'' is a maximal torus in a compact Lie group ''G'', one can define a [[root system]] as follows. The roots are the [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|weights]] for the adjoint action of ''T'' on the complexified Lie algebra of ''G''. To be more explicit, let <math>\\mathfrak t</math> denote the Lie algebra of ''T'', let <math>\\mathfrak g</math> denote the Lie algebra of <math>G</math>, and let <math>\\mathfrak g_{\\mathbb C}:=\\mathfrak g\\oplus i\\mathfrak g</math> denote the complexification of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. Then we say that an element <math>\\alpha\\in\\mathfrak t</math> is a '''root''' for ''G'' relative to ''T'' if <math>\\alpha\\neq 0</math> and there exists a nonzero <math>X\\in\\mathfrak g_{\\mathbb C}</math> such that\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}_{e^H}(X)=e^{i\\langle\\alpha,H\\rangle}X</math>\nfor all <math>H\\in\\mathfrak t</math>. Here <math>\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle</math> is a fixed inner product on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> that is invariant under the adjoint action of connected compact Lie groups.\n\nThe root system, as a subset of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak t</math> of ''T'', has all the usual properties of a root system, except that the roots may not span <math>\\mathfrak t</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 11.7</ref> The root system is a key tool in understanding the [[Compact_group#Classification|classification]] and [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|representation theory]] of ''G''.\n\n== Weyl group ==\nGiven a torus ''T'' (not necessarily maximal), the [[Weyl group]] of ''G'' with respect to ''T'' can be defined as the [[normalizer]] of ''T'' modulo the [[centralizer]] of ''T''. That is, \n:<math>W(T,G) := N_G(T)/C_G(T).</math> \nFix a maximal torus <math>T = T_0</math> in ''G;'' then the corresponding Weyl group is called the Weyl group of ''G'' (it depends up to isomorphism on the choice of ''T''). \n\nThe first two major results about the Weyl group are as follows.\n* The centralizer of ''T'' in ''G'' is equal to ''T'', so the Weyl group is equal to ''N''(''T'')/''T''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.36</ref>\n* The Weyl group is generated by reflections about the roots of the associated Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.36</ref> Thus, the Weyl group of ''T'' is isomorphic to the [[Weyl group]] of the [[root system]] of the Lie algebra of ''G''.\n\nWe now list some consequences of these main results.\n* Two elements in ''T'' are conjugate if and only if they are conjugate by an element of ''W''. That is, each conjugacy class of ''G'' intersects ''T'' in exactly one Weyl [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.39</ref> In fact, the space of conjugacy classes in ''G'' is homeomorphic to the [[orbit space]] ''T''/''W''.\n* The Weyl group acts by ([[outer automorphism|outer]]) [[automorphism]]s on ''T'' (and its Lie algebra).\n* The [[identity component]] of the normalizer of ''T'' is also equal to ''T''. The Weyl group is therefore equal to the [[component group]] of ''N''(''T'').\n* The Weyl group is finite.\nThe [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|representation theory]] of ''G'' is essentially determined by ''T'' and ''W''.\n\nAs an example, consider the case <math>G=SU(n)</math> with <math>T</math> being the diagonal subgroup of <math>G</math>. Then <math>x\\in G</math> belongs to <math>N(T)</math> if and only if <math>x</math> maps each standard basis element <math>e_i</math> to a multiple of some other standard basis element <math>e_j</math>, that is, if and only if <math>x</math> permutes the standard basis elements, up to multiplication by some constants. The Weyl group in this case is then the permutation group on <math>n</math> elements.\n\n==Weyl integral formula==\nSuppose ''f'' is a continuous function on ''G''. Then the integral over ''G'' of ''f'' with respect to the normalized Haar measure ''dg'' may be computed as follows:\n: <math>\\displaystyle{\\int_G f(g)\\, dg = |W|^{-1} \\int_T |\\Delta(t)|^2\\int_{G/T}f\\left(yty^{-1}\\right)\\,d[y]\\, dt,}</math>\nwhere <math>d[y]</math> is the normalized volume measure on the quotient manifold <math>G/T</math> and <math>dt</math> is the normalized Haar measure on ''T''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.30 and Proposition 12.24</ref> Here  Δ is given by the [[Weyl denominator formula]] and <math>|W|</math> is the order of the Weyl group. An important special case of this result occurs when ''f'' is a [[class function]], that is, a function invariant under conjugation. In that case, we have\n: <math>\\displaystyle{\\int_G f(g)\\, dg = |W|^{-1} \\int_T f(t) |\\Delta(t)|^2\\, dt.}</math>\nConsider as an example the case <math>G=SU(2)</math>, with <math>T</math> being the diagonal subgroup. Then the Weyl integral formula for class functions takes the following explicit form:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 11.33</ref>\n\n: <math>\\displaystyle{\\int_{SU(2)} f(g)\\, dg = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f\\left(\\mathrm{diag}\\left(e^{i\\theta}, e^{-i\\theta}\\right)\\right)\\, 4\\,\\mathrm{sin}^2(\\theta)  \\, \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi}.}</math>\nHere <math>|W|=2</math>, the normalized Haar measure on <math>T</math> is <math>\\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi}</math>, and <math>\\mathrm{diag}\\left(e^{i\\theta}, e^{-i\\theta}\\right)</math> denotes the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries <math>e^{i\\theta}</math> and <math>e^{-i\\theta}</math>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Compact group]]\n* [[Cartan subgroup]]\n* [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras|Cartan subalgebra]]\n* [[Toral Lie algebra]]\n* [[Bruhat decomposition]]\n* [[Weyl character formula]]\n* [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{citation|last=Adams|first= J.

      "text": "{{Short description|Rational function of the form (az + b)/(cz + d)}}\n{{distinguish|Möbius transform|Möbius function}}\n\nIn [[geometry]] and [[complex analysis]], a '''Möbius transformation''' of the [[complex plane]] is a [[rational function]] of the form\n\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d}</math>\n\nof one [[complex number|complex]] variable ''z''; here the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are complex numbers satisfying ''ad'' − ''bc'' ≠ 0.\n\nGeometrically, a Möbius transformation can be obtained by first performing [[stereographic projection]] from the plane to the [[sphere|unit two-sphere]], rotating and moving the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then performing stereographic projection (from the new position of the sphere) to the plane.<ref>{{Harv|Arnold|Rogness|2008|loc=Möbius transformations revealed, Theorem 1 [http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/papers/moebius.pdf]}}</ref>\nThese transformations preserve angles, map every straight line to a line or circle, and map every circle to a line or circle.\n\nThe Möbius transformations are the [[projective transformation]]s of the [[complex projective line]]. They form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the '''Möbius group''', which is the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,'''C'''). Together with its [[subgroup]]s, it has numerous applications in mathematics and physics.\n\nMöbius transformations are named in honor of [[August Ferdinand Möbius]]; they are also variously named '''[[homography|homographies]]''', '''homographic transformations''', '''linear fractional transformations''', '''bilinear transformations''', or '''fractional linear transformations'''.\n\n== Overview ==\nMöbius transformations are defined on the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}} = \\mathbf{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}</math> (i.e., the [[complex plane]] augmented by the [[point at infinity]]).\n\n[[Stereographic projection]] identifies <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math> with a sphere, which is then called the [[Riemann sphere]]; alternatively, <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math> can be thought of as the complex [[projective line]] <math>\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}^1</math>.  The Möbius transformations are exactly the [[bijective]] [[conformal map|conformal]] maps from the Riemann sphere to itself, i.e., the [[automorphism group|automorphisms]] of the Riemann sphere as a [[complex manifold]]; alternatively, they are the automorphisms of <math>\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}^1</math> as an algebraic variety.  Therefore, the set of all Möbius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]].  This group is called the Möbius group, and is sometimes denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}})\\,</math>.\n\nThe Möbius group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group of orientation-preserving [[isometry|isometries]] of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] and therefore plays an important role when studying [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s.\n\nIn [[physics]], the [[identity component]] of the [[Lorentz group]] acts on the [[celestial sphere]] in the same way that the Möbius group acts on the Riemann sphere. In fact, these two groups are isomorphic. An observer who accelerates to relativistic velocities will see the pattern of constellations as seen near the Earth continuously transform according to infinitesimal Möbius transformations. This observation is often taken as the starting point of [[twistor theory]].\n\nCertain [[subgroup]]s of the Möbius group form the automorphism groups of the other [[simply-connected]] Riemann surfaces (the [[complex plane]] and the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]). As such, Möbius transformations play an important role in the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s. The [[fundamental group]] of every Riemann surface is a [[discrete subgroup]] of the Möbius group (see [[Fuchsian group]] and [[Kleinian group]]).\nA particularly important discrete subgroup of the Möbius group is the [[modular group]]; it is central to the theory of many [[fractal]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[elliptic curve]]s and [[Pellian equation]]s.\n\nMöbius transformations can be more generally defined in spaces of dimension ''n''>2 as the bijective conformal orientation-preserving maps from the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] to the ''n''-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] a Möbius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]], orthogonal transformations and inversions.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe general form of a Möbius transformation is given by\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d}</math>\nwhere ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are any [[complex number]]s satisfying {{math|''ad'' − ''bc'' ≠ 0}}. If {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}, the rational function defined above is a constant since\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d} = \\frac{a(cz+d)}{c(cz+d)} - \\frac{a d -bc}{c(c z + d)} = \\frac{a}{c}</math>\nand is thus not considered a Möbius transformation.\n\nIn case {{math|''c'' ≠ 0}}, this definition is extended to the whole [[Riemann sphere]] by defining\n:<math>f\\left(\\frac{-d}{c}\\right) = \\infin \\text{ and } f(\\infin) = \\frac{a}{c}.</math>\n\nIf {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}, we define\n:<math>f(\\infin) = \\infin.</math>\n\nThus a Möbius transformation is always a bijective [[holomorphic function]] from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.\n\nThe set of all Möbius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]]. This group can be given the structure of a [[complex manifold]] in such a way that composition and inversion are [[holomorphic map]]s. The Möbius group is then a [[complex Lie group]]. The Möbius group is usually denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}})</math> as it is the [[automorphism group]] of the Riemann sphere.\n\n== Fixed points ==\nEvery non-identity Möbius transformation has two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] <math>\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2</math> on the Riemann sphere. Note that the fixed points are counted here with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]; the parabolic transformations are those where the fixed points coincide. Either or both of these fixed points may be the point at infinity.\n\n=== Determining the fixed points ===\nThe fixed points of the transformation\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}</math>\nare obtained by solving the fixed point equation f(γ) = γ. For ''c'' ≠ 0, this has two roots obtained by expanding this equation to\n:<math>c \\gamma^2 - (a - d) \\gamma - b = 0 \\ ,</math>\nand applying the [[quadratic formula]]. The roots are\n:<math>\\gamma_{1,2} = \\frac{(a - d) \\pm \\sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4bc}}{2c} = \\frac{(a - d) \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2c}</math>\nwith discriminant\n:<math> \\Delta =(\\operatorname{tr}\\mathfrak{H})^2 - 4\\operatorname{det}\\mathfrak{H}=(a+d)^2 - 4(ad-bc)</math>.\nParabolic transforms have coincidental fixed points due to zero discriminant. For ''c'' nonzero and nonzero discriminant the transform is elliptic or hyperbolic.\n\nWhen ''c'' = 0, the quadratic equation degenerates into a linear equation and the transform is linear. This corresponds to the situation that one of the fixed points is the point at infinity. When ''a'' ≠ ''d'' the second fixed point is finite and is given by\n\n:<math>\\gamma=-\\frac{b}{a-d}.</math>\n\nIn this case the transformation will be a simple transformation composed of [[translation (mathematics)|translation]]s, [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, and [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]]s:\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto \\alpha z + \\beta.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''c'' = 0 and ''a'' = ''d'', then both fixed points are at infinity, and the Möbius transformation corresponds to a pure translation:\n:<math>z \\mapsto z + \\beta.</math>\n\n=== Topological proof ===\nTopologically, the fact that (non-identity) Möbius transformations fix 2 points (with multiplicity) corresponds to the [[Euler characteristic]] of the sphere being 2:\n:<math>\\chi(\\hat{\\mathbf{C}})=2.</math>\n\nFirstly, the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,''K'') is [[n-transitive|sharply 3-transitive]]&nbsp;– for any two ordered triples of distinct points, there is a unique map that takes one triple to the other, just as for Möbius transforms, and by the same algebraic proof (essentially [[dimension counting]], as the group is 3-dimensional). Thus any map that fixes at least 3 points is the identity.\n\nNext, one can see by identifying the  Möbius group with <math>PGL(2,\\mathbb C)</math> that any Möbius function is homotopic to the identity. Indeed, any member of the [[general linear group]] can be reduced to the identity map by Gauss-Jordan elimination, this shows that the projective linear group is path-connected as well, providing a homotopy to the identity map.The [[Lefschetz–Hopf theorem]] states that the sum of the indices (in this context, multiplicity) of the fixed points of a map with finitely many fixed points equals the [[Lefschetz number]] of the map, which in this case is the trace of the identity map on homology groups, which is simply the Euler characteristic.\n\nBy contrast, the projective linear group of the real projective line, PGL(2,'''R''') need not fix any points&nbsp;– for example <math>(1+x)/(1-x)</math> has no (real) fixed points: as a complex transformation it fixes ±''i''<ref group=\"note\">Geometrically this map is the [[stereographic projection]] of a rotation by 90° around ±''i'' with period 4, which takes <math>0 \\mapsto 1 \\mapsto \\infty \\mapsto -1 \\mapsto 0.</math></ref>&nbsp;– while the map 2''x'' fixes the two points of 0 and ∞. This corresponds to the fact that the Euler characteristic of the circle (real projective line) is 0, and thus the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says only that it must fix at least 0 points, but possibly more.\n\n=== Normal form ===\nMöbius transformations are also sometimes written in terms of their fixed points in so-called '''normal form'''. We first treat the non-parabolic case, for which there are two distinct fixed points.\n\n''Non-parabolic case'':\n\nEvery non-parabolic transformation is [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to a dilation/rotation, i.e. a transformation of the form\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto k z \\, </math>\n\n(''k''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;'''C''') with fixed points at 0 and ∞. To see this define a map\n\n:<math>g(z) = \\frac{z - \\gamma_1}{z - \\gamma_2}</math>\n\nwhich sends the points (γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub>) to (0, ∞). Here we assume that γ<sub>1</sub> and γ<sub>2</sub> are distinct and finite. If one of them is already at infinity then ''g'' can be modified so as to fix infinity and send the other point to 0.\n\nIf ''f'' has distinct fixed points (γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub>) then the transformation <math>gfg^{-1}</math> has fixed points at 0 and ∞ and is therefore a dilation: <math>gfg^{-1}(z) = kz</math>. The fixed point equation for the transformation ''f'' can then be written\n:<math>\\frac{f(z)-\\gamma_1}{f(z)-\\gamma_2} = k \\frac{z-\\gamma_1}{z-\\gamma_2}.</math>\n\nSolving for ''f'' gives (in matrix form):\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma_1 - k\\gamma_2 & (k - 1) \\gamma_1\\gamma_2 \\\\\n1 - k                &  k\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nor, if one of the fixed points is at infinity:\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma, \\infty) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk & (1 - k) \\gamma \\\\\n0 &  1\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nFrom the above expressions one can calculate the derivatives of ''f'' at the fixed points:\n\n:<math>f'(\\gamma_1)= k\\,</math> and <math>f'(\\gamma_2)= 1/k.\\,</math>\n\nObserve that, given an ordering of the fixed points, we can distinguish one of the multipliers (''k'') of ''f'' as the '''characteristic constant''' of ''f''. Reversing the order of the fixed points is equivalent to taking the inverse multiplier for the characteristic constant:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) = \\mathfrak{H}(1/k; \\gamma_2, \\gamma_1).</math>\n\nFor loxodromic transformations, whenever |''k''| > 1, one says that γ<sub>1</sub> is the '''repulsive''' fixed point, and γ<sub>2</sub> is the '''attractive''' fixed point. For |''k''| < 1, the roles are reversed.\n\n''Parabolic case'':\n\nIn the parabolic case there is only one fixed point γ. The transformation sending that point to ∞ is\n\n:<math>g(z) = \\frac{1}{z - \\gamma}</math>\n\nor the identity if γ is already at infinity. The transformation <math>gfg^{-1}</math> fixes infinity and is therefore a translation:\n\n:<math>gfg^{-1}(z) = z + \\beta\\,.</math>\n\nHere, β is called the '''translation length'''. The fixed point formula for a parabolic transformation is then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{f(z)-\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{z-\\gamma} + \\beta.</math>\n\nSolving for ''f'' (in matrix form) gives\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(\\beta; \\gamma) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\gamma\\beta    & - \\beta \\gamma^2  \\\\\n\\beta            &   1-\\gamma \\beta\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nor, if γ = ∞:\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(\\beta; \\infty) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\beta  \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNote that β is ''not'' the characteristic constant of ''f'', which is always 1 for a parabolic transformation. From the above expressions one can calculate:\n:<math>f'(\\gamma) = 1.\\,</math>\n\n== Poles of the transformation ==\n\nThe point <math>z_\\infty = - \\frac{d}{c}</math> is called the pole of <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math>; it is that point which is transformed to the point at infinity under <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math>.\n\nThe inverse pole <math>Z_\\infty = \\frac{a}{c}</math> is that point to which the point at infinity is transformed.\nThe point midway between the two poles is always the same as the point midway between the two fixed points:\n\n:<math>\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 = z_\\infty + Z_\\infty.</math>\n\nThese four points are the vertices of a parallelogram which is sometimes called the '''characteristic parallelogram''' of the transformation.\n\nA transform <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> can be specified with two fixed points γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub> and the pole <math>z_\\infty</math>.\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\infty & - \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\\\\n1        & - z_\\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\;\\;\nZ_\\infty = \\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - z_\\infty.\n</math>\n\nThis allows us to derive a formula for conversion between ''k'' and <math>z_\\infty</math> given <math>\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2</math>:\n:<math>z_\\infty = \\frac{k \\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2}{1 - k}</math>\n:<math>k= \\frac{\\gamma_2 - z_\\infty}{\\gamma_1 - z_\\infty}\n= \\frac{Z_\\infty - \\gamma_1}{Z_\\infty - \\gamma_2}\n= \\frac {a - c \\gamma_1}{a - c \\gamma_2},</math>\n\nwhich reduces down to\n:<math>k = \\frac{(a + d) + \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{(a + d) - \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}.</math>\n\nThe last expression coincides with one of the (mutually reciprocal) [[eigenvalue]] ratios <math> \\lambda_1\\over \\lambda_2</math> of the matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nrepresenting the transform (compare the discussion in the preceding section about the characteristic constant of a transformation). Its characteristic polynomial is equal to\n:<math>\n\\det (\\lambda I_2- \\mathfrak{H})\n=\\lambda^2-\\operatorname{tr} \\mathfrak{H}\\,\\lambda+\n\\det \\mathfrak{H}\n=\\lambda^2-(a+d)\\lambda+(ad-bc)\n</math>\nwhich has roots\n:<math> \\lambda_{i}=\\frac{(a + d) \\pm \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{2}=\\frac{(a + d) \\pm \\sqrt {(a + d)^2 - 4(ad-b c)}}{2}=c\\gamma_i+d \\ .\n</math>\n\n==Simple  Möbius transformations and composition ==\n\nA Möbius transformation can be [[Function composition|composed]] as a sequence of simple transformations.\n\nThe following simple transformations are also Möbius transformations:\n\n<math>  f(z) = z+b\\quad (a=1,c = 0 ,d=1 ) </math>\nis a [[translation (geometry)|translation]]\n\n<math>  f(z) = az \\quad (b=0,c = 0 ,d=1 ) </math>\nis a combination of a ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])\nIf <math>  |a| =1 </math> then it is a rotation, if <math>  a \\in \\mathbb{R} </math> then it is a homothety\n\n<math>f(z)= 1/z \\quad (a=0, b=1, c = 1 ,d=0 ) </math> ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)\n\n=== Composition of simple transformations===\n\nLet:\n\n* <math>f_1(z)= z+d/c \\quad</math> ([[translation (geometry)|translation]] by ''d''/''c'')\n* <math>f_2(z)= 1/z \\quad</math> ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)\n* <math>f_3(z)= \\frac{bc-ad}{c^2} z \\quad</math> ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])\n* <math>f_4(z)= z+a/c \\quad</math> (translation by ''a''/''c'')\n\nThen these functions can be [[Function composition|composed]], giving\n\n:<math> f_4\\circ f_3\\circ f_2\\circ f_1 (z)= f(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d} </math>\n\nThis decomposition makes many properties of the Möbius transformation obvious.\n\n== Elementary properties ==\nA Möbius transformation is equivalent to a sequence of simpler transformations.\nThe composition  makes many properties of the Möbius transformation obvious.\n\n=== Formula for the inverse transformation ===\nThe existence of the inverse Möbius transformation and its explicit formula are easily derived by the composition of the inverse functions of the simpler transformations. That is, define functions ''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ''g''<sub>3</sub>, ''g''<sub>4</sub> such that each ''g<sub>i</sub>'' is the inverse of ''f<sub>i</sub>''. Then the composition\n: <math>g_1\\circ g_2\\circ g_3\\circ g_4 (z) = f^{-1}(z) = \\frac{dz-b}{-cz+a}</math> gives a formula for the inverse.\n\n=== Preservation of angles and generalized circles ===\nFrom this decomposition, we see that Möbius transformations carry over all non-trivial properties of [[circle inversion]]. For example, the preservation of angles is reduced to proving that circle inversion preserves angles since the other types of transformations are dilation and [[isometries]] (translation, reflection, rotation), which trivially preserve angles.\n\nFurthermore, Möbius transformations map [[generalized circle]]s to generalized circles since circle inversion has this property. A generalized circle is either a circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a Möbius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, it does not necessarily map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.\n\n=== Cross-ratio preservation ===\n[[Cross-ratio]]s are invariant under Möbius transformations. That is, if a Möbius transformation maps four distinct points <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4</math> to four distinct points <math>w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4</math> respectively, then\n:<math>\\frac{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}{(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)} =\\frac{(w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_4)}{(w_2-w_3)(w_1-w_4)}. </math>\n\nIf one of the points <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4</math> is the point at infinity, then the cross-ratio has to be defined by taking the appropriate limit; e.g. the cross-ratio of <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, \\infin</math> is\n:<math>\\frac{(z_1-z_3)}{(z_2-z_3)}.</math>\n\nThe cross ratio of four different points is real if and only if there is a line or a circle passing through them. This is another way to show that Möbius transformations preserve generalized circles.\n\n=== Conjugation ===\nTwo points ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> are '''conjugate''' with respect to a generalized circle ''C'', if, given a generalized circle ''D'' passing through ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> and cutting ''C'' in two points ''a'' and ''b'', {{nowrap|(''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>; ''a'', ''b'')}} are in [[harmonic cross-ratio]] (i.e. their cross ratio is −1). This property does not depend on the choice of the circle ''D''. This property is also sometimes referred to as being '''symmetric''' with respect to a line or circle.<ref>{{citation|last=Olsen|first=John|title=The Geometry of Mobius Transformations |url=http://www.johno.dk/mathematics/moebius.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{mathworld|id=SymmetricPoints|title=Symmetric Points}}</ref>\n\nTwo points ''z'', ''z''<sup>∗</sup> are conjugate with respect to a line, if they are [[reflection symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to the line. Two points are conjugate with respect to a circle if they are exchanged by the [[inversive geometry|inversion]] with respect to this circle.\n\nThe point ''z''<sup>∗</sup> conjugate to ''z'' when ''L'' is the line determined by the vector based ''e<sup>iθ</sup>'' at the point ''z''<sub>0</sub> can be explicitly given as\n:<math>z^* = e^{2i\\theta} \\overline{z - z_0} + z_0.</math>\n\nThe point ''z''<sup>∗</sup> conjugate to ''z'' when ''C'' is the circle of radius ''r'' centered ''z''<sub>0</sub> can be explicitly given as\n:<math>z^* = \\frac{r^2}{\\overline{z - z_0}} + z_0</math>\n\nSince Möbius transformations preserve generalized circles and cross-ratios, they preserve also the conjugation.\n\n== Projective matrix representations ==\nWith every [[invertible matrix|invertible]] complex 2-by-2 matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak H = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwe can associate the Möbius transformation\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d}.</math>\nThe condition ''ad'' − ''bc'' ≠ 0 is equivalent to the condition that the [[determinant]] of above matrix be nonzero, i.e. that the matrix be invertible.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that then the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of two matrices will be associated with the composition of the two corresponding Möbius transformations. In other words, the map\n:<math>\\pi\\colon \\operatorname{GL}(2,\\mathbf C) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf C})</math>\nfrom the [[general linear group]] GL(2,'''C''') to the Möbius group, which sends the matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> to the transformation ''f'', is a [[group homomorphism]].\n\nNote that any matrix obtained by multiplying <math>\\mathfrak H</math> by a complex scalar λ determines the same transformation, so a Möbius transformation determines its matrix only [[up to]] scalar multiples. In other words: the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of {{pi}} consists of all scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]] I, and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] of group theory states that the [[quotient group]] GL(2,'''C''')/(('''C&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}''')Id) is isomorphic to the Möbius group. This quotient group is known as the [[projective linear group]] and is usually denoted PGL(2,'''C''').\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}) \\cong \\operatorname{PGL}(2,\\mathbf C).</math>\nThe same identification of PGL(2,''K'') with the group of fractional linear transformations and with the group of projective linear automorphisms of the projective line holds over any field ''K'', a fact of algebraic interest, particularly for finite fields, though the case of the complex numbers has the greatest geometric interest.\n\nThe natural [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of PGL(2,'''C''') on the [[complex projective line]] '''CP'''<sup>1</sup> is exactly the natural action of the Möbius group on the Riemann sphere, where the projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup> and the Riemann sphere are identified as follows:\n:<math>[z_1 : z_2]\\leftrightarrow z_1/z_2.</math>\nHere [''z''<sub>1</sub>:''z''<sub>2</sub>] are [[homogeneous coordinates]] on '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>; the point [1:0] corresponds to the point ∞ of the Riemann sphere.\nBy using homogeneous coordinates, many concrete calculations involving Möbius transformations can be simplified, since no case distinctions dealing with ∞ are required.\n\nIf one restricts <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> to matrices of determinant one, the map {{pi}} restricts to a surjective map from the [[special linear group]] SL(2,'''C''') to the Möbius group; in the restricted setting the kernel is formed by plus and minus the identity, and the quotient group SL(2,'''C''')/{±''I''}, denoted by PSL(2,'''C'''), is therefore also isomorphic to the Möbius group:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf C}) \\cong \\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf C).</math>\nFrom this we see that the Möbius group is a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group). It is a [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] non-[[Compact group|compact]] Lie group.\n\nNote that there are precisely two matrices with unit determinant which can be used to represent any given Möbius transformation. That is, SL(2,'''C''') is a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of PSL(2,'''C'''). Since SL(2,'''C''') is [[simply-connected]] it is the [[universal cover]] of the Möbius group. Therefore, the [[fundamental group]] of the Möbius group is '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Specifying a transformation by three points ===\n\nGiven a set of three distinct points ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>3</sub> on the Riemann sphere and a second set of distinct points ''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub>, there exists precisely one Möbius transformation ''f''(''z'')  with ''f''(''z''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1,2,3. (In other words: the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the Möbius group on the Riemann sphere is ''sharply 3-transitive''.) There are several ways to determine ''f''(''z'') from the given sets of points.\n\n==== Mapping first to 0, 1, ∞ ====\nIt is easy to check that the Möbius transformation\n\n:<math>f_1(z)= \\frac {(z-z_1)(z_2-z_3)}{(z-z_3)(z_2-z_1)}</math>\n\nwith matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\nz_2 - z_3 & -z_1 (z_2 - z_3)\\\\\nz_2-z_1 & -z_3 (z_2-z_1)\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nmaps ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>3</sub> to 0, 1, ∞, respectively. If one of the ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> is ∞, then the proper formula for <math>\\mathfrak{H}_1</math> is obtained from the above one by first dividing all entries by ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> and then taking the limit ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> → ∞.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{H}_2</math> is similarly defined to map ''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub> to 0, 1, ∞, then the matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> which maps ''z''<sub>1,2,3</sub> to ''w''<sub>1,2,3</sub> becomes\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} = \\mathfrak{H}_2^{-1} \\mathfrak{H}_1.</math>\n\nThe stabilizer of {0, 1, ∞} (as an unordered set) is a subgroup known as the [[anharmonic group]].\n\n==== Explicit determinant formula ====\nThe equation\n:<math>w=\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}</math>\nis equivalent to the equation of a standard [[hyperbola]]\n:<math>\\, c wz -az+dw -b=0 </math>\nin the (''z'',''w'')-plane. The problem of constructing a Möbius transformation <math> \\mathfrak{H}(z) </math> mapping a triple <math> (z_1, z_2, z_3 )</math> to another triple <math>(w_1, w_2, w_3 )</math> is thus equivalent to finding the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of the hyperbola passing through the points <math> (z_i, w_i ) </math>. An explicit equation can be found by evaluating the [[determinant]]\n:<math>\\det \\begin{pmatrix} zw & z & w & 1 \\\\ z_1w_1 & z_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & z_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & w_3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\nby means of a [[Laplace expansion]] along the first row. This results in the determinant formulae\n:<math>a=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & w_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>b=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & z_1 & w_1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & z_2 & w_2 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & w_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>c=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3 & w_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>d=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & z_1 & 1 \\\\  z_2w_2 & z_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nfor the coefficients ''a,b,c,d'' of the representing matrix <math>\\, \\mathfrak{H} =\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\  c & d \\end{pmatrix} </math>. The constructed matrix <math> \\mathfrak{H} </math> has determinant equal to <math> (z_1-z_2) (z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_3)(w_1-w_2) (w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_3) </math> which does not vanish if the ''z<sub>i</sub>'' resp. ''w<sub>i</sub>'' are pairwise different thus the Möbius transformation is well-defined. If one of the points ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> or ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> is ∞, then we first divide all four determinants by this variable and then take the limit as the variable approaches ∞.\n\n== Subgroups of the Möbius group ==\nIf we require the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of a Möbius transformation to be real numbers with {{nowrap|''ad'' − ''bc'' {{=}} 1}}, we obtain a subgroup of the\nMöbius group denoted as [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]]. This is the group of those Möbius transformations that map the [[upper half-plane]] {{nowrap|''H'' {{=}} ''x'' + i''y'' : ''y'' > 0}} to itself, and is equal to the group of all [[biholomorphic]] (or equivalently: [[bijective]], [[conformal map|conformal]] and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''H'' → ''H''}}. If a proper [[Riemannian metric|metric]] is introduced, the upper half-plane becomes a model of the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ''H''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>, the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], and PSL(2,'''R''') is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup> in this model.\n\nThe subgroup of all Möbius transformations that map the open disk {{nowrap|''D'' {{=}} ''z'' : {{abs|''z''}} < 1}} to itself consists of all transformations of the form\n:<math>f(z) = e^{i\\phi} \\frac{z + b}{\\bar{b} z + 1}</math>\nwith <math>\\phi</math> ∈ '''R''', ''b'' ∈ '''C''' and |''b''| < 1. This is equal to the group of all biholomorphic (or equivalently: bijective, angle-preserving and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''D'' → ''D''}}. By introducing a suitable metric, the open disk turns into another model of the hyperbolic plane, the [[Poincaré disk model]], and this group is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup> in this model.\n\nSince both of the above subgroups serve as isometry groups of ''H<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>'', they are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism is given by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] with the transformation\n:<math>f(z)=\\frac{z+i}{iz+1}</math>\nwhich bijectively maps the open unit disk to the upper half plane.\n\nAlternatively, consider an open disk with radius ''r'', centered at ''ri''. The Poincaré disk model in this disk becomes identical to the upper-half-plane model as ''r'' approaches ∞.\n\nA [[maximal compact subgroup]] of the Möbius group <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is given by<ref>{{Harvard citation|Tóth|2002|loc=Section 1.2, Rotations and Möbius Transformations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i76mmyvDHYUC&pg=PA22 p.&nbsp;22]}}</ref>\n:<math>\\mathcal{M}_0 := \\left\\{z \\mapsto \\frac{uz - \\bar v}{vz + \\bar u} : |u|^2 + |v|^2 = 1\\right\\},</math>\nand corresponds under the isomorphism <math>\\mathcal{M} \\cong \\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf{C})</math> to the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU(2,'''C''') which is isomorphic to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, and can be interpreted as rotations of the Riemann sphere.

The discrete subgroups of PSL(2,'''R''') are known as [[Fuchsian group]]s; they are important in the study of [[Riemann surface]]s.\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Apollonian circles.svg|thumb|A hyperbolic transformation is shown.

The classification has both algebraic and geometric significance. Geometrically, the different types result in different transformations of the complex plane, as the figures below illustrate.\n\nThe four types can be distinguished by looking at the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\,\\mathfrak{H}=a+d</math>.

Thus, all Möbius transformations of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] are elliptic transformations, namely exactly those where λ is a [[root of unity]], or, equivalently, where α is a [[Rational number|rational]] multiple of [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The simplest possibility of a fractional multiple means ''α'' = {{pi}}/2, which is also the unique case of <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\mathfrak{H} = 0</math>, is also denoted as a '''{{visible anchor|circular transform}}'''; this corresponds geometrically to rotation by 180° about two fixed points. This class is represented in matrix form as:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThere are 3 representatives fixing {0, 1, ∞}, which are the three transpositions in the symmetry group of these 3 points: <math>1/z,</math> which fixes 1 and swaps 0 with ''∞'' (rotation by 180° about the points 1 and −1), <math>1-z</math>, which fixes ''∞'' and swaps 0 with 1 (rotation by 180° about the points 1/2 and ''∞''), and <math>z/(z - 1)</math> which fixes 0 and swaps 1 with ''∞'' (rotation by 180° about the points 0 and 2).\n\n=== Hyperbolic transforms ===\nThe transform is said to be ''hyperbolic'' if it can be represented by a matrix <math>\\mathfrak H</math> whose trace is [[real number|real]] with\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H} > 4.\\,</math>\n\nA transform is hyperbolic if and only if λ is real and positive.\n\n=== Loxodromic transforms ===\nThe transform is said to be ''loxodromic'' if <math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H}</math> is not in [0,4]. A transformation is loxodromic if and only if <math>|\\lambda|\\ne 1</math>.\n\nHistorically, [[navigation]] by [[loxodrome]] or [[rhumb line]] refers to a path of constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]; the resulting path is a [[logarithmic spiral]], similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic Möbius transformation makes.

The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the transformation&nbsp;– division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/''n'' is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of ±1 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace ''squared'' as a proxy for the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the [[SL2(R)#Classification of elements|classification of elements of SL(2, '''R''')]] (the 2-fold cover), and [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|analogous classifications]] are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.\n\n== Geometric interpretation of the characteristic constant ==\nThe following picture depicts (after stereographic transformation from the sphere to the plane) the two fixed points of a Möbius transformation in the non-parabolic case:\n\n[[File:Mobius Identity.jpeg]]\n\nThe characteristic constant can be expressed in terms of its [[Natural logarithm|logarithm]]:\n:<math>e^{\\rho + \\alpha i} = k. \\;</math>\nWhen expressed in this way, the real number ρ becomes an expansion factor. It indicates how repulsive the fixed point γ<sub>1</sub> is, and how attractive γ<sub>2</sub> is. The real number α is a rotation factor, indicating to what extent the transform rotates the plane anti-clockwise about γ<sub>1</sub> and clockwise about γ<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Elliptic transformations ===\nIf ρ = 0, then the fixed points are neither attractive nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation is said to be ''elliptic''. These transformations tend to move all points in circles around the two fixed points. If one of the fixed points is at infinity, this is equivalent to doing an affine rotation around a point.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any elliptic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a family of circles which is nested between the two fixed points on the Riemann sphere. In general, the two fixed points can be any two distinct points.\n\nThis has an important physical interpretation.\nImagine that some observer rotates with constant angular velocity about some axis. Then we can take the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere. The appearance of the night sky is now transformed continuously in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of elliptic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, and with the number α corresponding to the constant angular velocity of our observer.\n\nHere are some figures illustrating the effect of an elliptic Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):\n\n[[File:Mobius Small Neg Elliptical.jpeg]]\n\n[[File:Mobius Large Pos Elliptical.jpeg]]\n\nThese pictures illustrate the effect of a single Möbius transformation. The one-parameter subgroup which it generates ''continuously'' moves points along the family of circular arcs suggested by the pictures.\n\n=== Hyperbolic transformations ===\n\nIf α is zero (or a multiple of 2{{pi}}), then the transformation is said to be ''hyperbolic''. These transformations tend to move points along circular paths from one fixed point toward the other.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any hyperbolic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of circular arcs ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.\n\nThis too has an important physical interpretation. Imagine that an observer accelerates (with constant magnitude of acceleration) in the direction of the North pole on his celestial sphere. Then the appearance of the night sky is transformed in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of hyperbolic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, with the real number ρ corresponding to the magnitude of his acceleration vector. The stars seem to move along longitudes, away from the South pole toward the North pole. (The longitudes appear as circular arcs under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane.)\n\nHere are some figures illustrating the effect of a hyperbolic Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):\n\n[[File:Mobius Small Neg Hyperbolic.jpeg]]\n\n[[File:Mobius Large Pos Hyperbolic.jpeg]]\n\nThese pictures resemble the field lines of a positive and a negative electrical charge located at the fixed points, because the circular flow lines subtend a constant angle between the two fixed points.\n\n=== Loxodromic transformations ===\n\nIf both ρ and α are nonzero, then the transformation is said to be ''loxodromic''. These transformations tend to move all points in S-shaped paths from one fixed point to the other.\n\nThe word \"[[loxodrome]]\" is from the Greek: \"λοξος (loxos), ''slanting'' + δρόμος (dromos), ''course''\". When [[sailing]] on a constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] – if you maintain a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the [[north pole]] in a [[logarithmic spiral]]. On the [[mercator projection]] such a course is a straight line, as the north and south poles project to infinity. The angle that the loxodrome subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the \"tightness\" of the spiral) is the argument of ''k''. Of course, Möbius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.\n\nYou can probably guess the physical interpretation in the case when the two fixed points are 0, ∞: an observer who is both rotating (with constant angular velocity) about some axis and moving along the ''same'' axis, will see the appearance of the night sky transform according to the one-parameter subgroup of loxodromic transformations with fixed points 0, ∞, and with ρ, α determined respectively by the magnitude of the actual linear and angular velocities.\n\n=== Stereographic projection ===\nThese images show Möbius transformations [[stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] onto the [[Riemann sphere]]. Note in particular that when projected onto a sphere, the special case of a fixed point at infinity looks no different from having the fixed points in an arbitrary location.\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''One fixed point at infinity'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-inf-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-inf-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-inf-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Fixed points diametrically opposite'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-opp-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-opp-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-opp-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Fixed points in an arbitrary location'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-arb-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-arb-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-arb-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|}\n\n== Iterating a transformation ==\n\nIf a transformation <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> has fixed points γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub>, and characteristic constant ''k'', then <math>\\mathfrak{H}' = \\mathfrak{H}^n</math> will have <math>\\gamma_1' = \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2' = \\gamma_2, k' = k^n</math>.\n\nThis can be used to [[iterate (math)|iterate]] a transformation, or to animate one by breaking it up into steps.\n\nThese images show three points (red, blue and black) continuously iterated under transformations with various characteristic constants.\n\n{| style=\"margin: auto;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Mobius23621.jpeg]] || [[File:Mobius23622.jpeg]] || [[File:Mobius23623.jpeg]] ||\n|-\n|\n|}\n\nAnd these images demonstrate what happens when you transform a circle under Hyperbolic, Elliptical, and Loxodromic transforms.

Points with ''Q''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 are called ''spacelike''. The [[null cone]] ''S'' consists of those points where ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0; the ''future null cone'' ''N''<sup>+</sup> are those points on the null cone with ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0. The [[celestial sphere]] is then identified with the collection of rays in ''N''<sup>+</sup> whose initial point is the origin of '''R'''<sup>4</sup>. The collection of [[linear transformation]]s on '''R'''<sup>4</sup> with positive [[determinant]] preserving the quadratic form ''Q'' and preserving the time direction form the [[restricted Lorentz group]] SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3).\n\nIn connection with the geometry of the celestial sphere, the group of transformations SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) is identified with the group PSL(2,'''C''') of Möbius transformations of the sphere.

Since the determinant of ''X'' is identified with the quadratic form ''Q'', SL(2,'''C''') acts by Lorentz transformations.

Consider first the hyperplane in '''R'''<sup>4</sup> given by ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. The celestial sphere may be identified with the sphere ''S''<sup>+</sup> of intersection of the hyperplane with the future null cone ''N''<sup>+</sup>. The stereographic projection from the north pole (1,0,0,1) of this sphere onto the plane ''x''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 takes a point with coordinates (1,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) with\n\n:<math>x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1</math>\n\nto the point\n\n:<math>\\left(1, \\frac{x_1}{1-x_3}, \\frac{x_2}{1-x_3},0\\right).</math>\n\nIntroducing the [[complex number|complex]] coordinate\n\n:<math>\\zeta = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3},</math>\n\nthe inverse stereographic projection gives the following formula for a point (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) on ''S''<sup>+</sup>:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_1 &= \\frac{\\zeta+\\bar{\\zeta}}{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1}\\\\\nx_2 &= \\frac{\\zeta-\\bar{\\zeta}}{i(\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1)}\\\\\nx_3 &= \\frac{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}-1}{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThe action of SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) on the points of ''N''<sup>+</sup> does not preserve the hyperplane ''S''<sup>+</sup>, but acting on points in ''S''<sup>+</sup> and then rescaling so that the result is again in ''S''<sup>+</sup> gives an action of SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) on the sphere which goes over to an action on the complex variable ζ. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional linear transformation of ζ variable goes over to a unique Lorentz transformation on ''N''<sup>+</sup>, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.\n\nA more invariant description of the stereographic projection which allows the action to be more clearly seen is to consider the variable ζ&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'':''w'' as a ratio of a pair of homogeneous coordinates for the complex projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>. The stereographic projection goes over to a transformation from '''C'''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;{0} to ''N''<sup>+</sup> which is homogeneous of degree two with respect to real scalings\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>(z,w)\\mapsto (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)=(z\\bar{z}+w\\bar{w}, z\\bar{z}-w\\bar{w}, z\\bar{w}+w\\bar{z}, i^{-1}(z\\bar{w}-w\\bar{z}))</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nwhich agrees with ({{EquationNote|4}}) upon restriction to scales in which <math>z\\bar{z}+w\\bar{w}=1.</math> The components of ({{EquationNote|5}}) are precisely those obtained from the outer product\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_0+x_1 & x_2+ix_3\\\\\nx_2-ix_3 & x_0-x_1\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n2\\begin{bmatrix}\nz\\\\ w\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\bar{z}&\\bar{w}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nIn summary, the action of the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) agrees with that of the Möbius group PSL(2,'''C'''). This motivates the following definition. In dimension ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2, the '''Möbius group''' Möb(''n'') is the group of all orientation-preserving [[conformal geometry|conformal]] [[isometry|isometries]] of the round sphere ''S''<sup>''n''</sup> to itself. By realizing the conformal sphere as the space of future-pointing rays of the null cone in the Minkowski space '''R'''<sup>1,n+1</sup>, there is an isomorphism of Möb(''n'') with the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,''n''+1) of Lorentz transformations with positive determinant, preserving the direction of time.\n\nCoxeter began instead with the equivalent quadratic form <math>Q(x_1,\\ x_2,\\ x_3 \\ x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - x_4^2 .</math>\n\nHe identified the Lorentz group with transformations for which {''x'' : Q(''x'') = -1} is [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]]. Then he interpreted the x's as [[homogeneous coordinates]]  and {''x'' : Q(''x'') = 0}, the [[null cone]], as the [[Cayley absolute]] for a hyperbolic space of points {''x'' : Q(''x'') < 0}. Next, Coxeter introduced the variables\n:<math>\\xi = \\frac {x_1}{x_4} , \\ \\eta = \\frac {x_2}{x_4}, \\ \\zeta = \\frac {x_3}{x_4} </math>\n\nso that the Lorentz-invariant quadric corresponds to the sphere <math>\\xi^2 + \\eta^2 + \\zeta^2 = 1 .</math> Coxeter notes that [[Felix Klein]] also wrote of this correspondence, applying stereographic projection from (0, 0, 1) to the complex plane <math>z = \\frac{\\xi + i \\eta}{1 - \\zeta}.</math>\nCoxeter used the fact that circles of the inversive plane represent planes of hyperbolic space, and the general homography is the product of inversions in two or four circles, corresponding to the general hyperbolic displacement which is the product of inversions in two or four planes.\n\n=== Hyperbolic space ===\nAs seen above, the Möbius group PSL(2,'''C''') acts on Minkowski space as the group of those isometries that preserve the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where ''Q''=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, we see that the Möbius group acts on ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the Möbius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.\n\nIf we use the [[Poincaré disk model|Poincaré ball model]], identifying the unit ball in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> with ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, then we can think of the Riemann sphere as the \"conformal boundary\" of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>. Every orientation-preserving isometry of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> gives rise to a Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere and vice versa; this is the very first observation leading to the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjectures in physics.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bilinear transform]]\n* [[Conformal geometry]]\n* [[Fuchsian group]]\n* [[Generalised circle]]\n* [[Hyperbolic geometry]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n* [[Inversion transformation]]\n* [[Kleinian group]]\n* [[Lie sphere geometry]]\n* [[Linear fractional transformation]]\n* [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)]]\n* [[Lorentz group]]\n* [[Modular group]]\n* [[Poincaré half-plane model]]\n* [[Projective geometry]]\n* [[Projective line over a ring]]\n* [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Specific'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''General'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |last=Arnold |first=Douglas N. |last2=Rogness |first2=Jonathan |year=2008 |title=Möbius Transformations Revealed |journal=Notices of the AMS |pages=1226–1231 |volume=55 |issue=10 |url=http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/papers/moebius.pdf }}\n* {{citation | first=Alan F.|last=Beardon | title=The Geometry of Discrete Groups | publisher=New York: Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-387-90788-8}}\n* {{citation | first=G.

This notion was introduced by [[Anatoly Maltsev|Anatoly Mal'cev]] in 1951.\n\nIn the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold.  A [[Riemannian manifold]] is called a '''homogeneous nilmanifold''' if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it.  The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson <ref>E.

One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group ''N'' and a [[discrete subgroup]] <math> \\Gamma </math>.  If the subgroup <math> \\Gamma </math> acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on ''N'', then the quotient manifold <math>N/ \\Gamma </math> will be a compact nilmanifold.  As Mal'cev has shown, every compact\nnilmanifold is obtained this way.<ref>A. I. Mal'cev, ''On a class of homogeneous spaces'', AMS Translation No. '''39''' (1951).</ref>\n\nSuch a subgroup <math> \\Gamma </math> as above is called a [[lattice (group theory)|lattice]] in ''N''.  It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational [[structure constants]]: this is [[Malcev's criterion]].  Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also Raghunathan.<ref>Raghunathan, Chapter II, ''Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups'', M. S. Raghunathan</ref>\n\nA '''compact Riemannian nilmanifold''' is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric.  These spaces are constructed as follows.  Let <math> \\Gamma </math> be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group ''N'', as above.  Endow ''N'' with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric.  Then the subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> acts by isometries on ''N'' via left-multiplication.  Thus the quotient <math>\\Gamma \\backslash N</math> is a compact space locally isometric to ''N''.  Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to <math>N / \\Gamma </math>.\n\nCompact nilmanifolds also arise as [[principal bundles]].  For example, consider a 2-step [[nilpotent Lie group]] ''N'' which admits a lattice (see above).  Let <math>Z=[N,N]</math> be the commutator subgroup of ''N''.  Denote by p the dimension of ''Z'' and by q the codimension of ''Z''; i.e. the dimension of ''N'' is p+q.  It is known (see Raghunathan) that <math>Z \\cap \\Gamma</math> is a lattice in ''Z''.  Hence, <math>G = Z/(Z \\cap \\Gamma )</math> is a ''p''-dimensional compact torus.  Since ''Z'' is central in ''N'', the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold <math>P = N/ \\Gamma</math> with quotient space <math>M=P/G</math>.  This base manifold ''M'' is a ''q''-dimensional compact torus.  It has been shown that ever principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see.<ref>Palais, R. S.; Stewart, T. E. ''Torus bundles over a torus.'' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 1961 26–29.</ref>  More generally, a compact nilmanifold is a torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus.\n\nAs mentioned above, [[almost flat manifold]]s are intimately compact nilmanifolds.  See that article for more information.\n\n==Complex nilmanifolds==\n\nHistorically, a '''complex nilmanifold''' meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over a [[cocompact lattice]]. An example of such a nilmanifold is an [[Iwasawa manifold]]. From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one.\n\nAn '''almost complex structure''' on a real Lie algebra ''g'' is an endomorphism <math>I:\\; g \\rightarrow g</math> which squares to\n&minus;Id<sub>''g''</sub>. This operator is called '''a complex structure''' if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues\n<math>\\pm \\sqrt{-1}</math>, are subalgebras in <math>g \\otimes {\\mathbb C}</math>. In this case, ''I'' defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold (''G'',''I'') is called '''a complex group manifold'''.\nIt is easy to see that every connected complex [[homogeneous space|homogeneous manifold]] equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way.\n\nLet ''G'' be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A '''complex nilmanifold''' is a quotient of a complex group  manifold (''G'',''I''), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right.\n\nComplex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties.\n\nIn complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a [[Kodaira surface]].<ref>Keizo Hasegawa  ''Complex and Kähler structures on Compact Solvmanifolds,'' J. Symplectic Geom. Volume 3, Number 4 (2005), 749–767.</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\nCompact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never [[formal space|homotopy formal]].<ref>Keizo Hasegawa,  ''Minimal models of nilmanifolds,'' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 106 (1989), no. 1, 65–71.</ref> This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot\nadmit a [[Kähler structure]] (see also <ref>C. Benson, C.S. Gordon, ''Kähler and symplectic structures on nilmanifolds'', Topology '''27'''(4) (1988) 513–518.</ref>).\n\nTopologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained\nas iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by [[Upper central series|ascending central series]].<ref>Sönke Rollenske,  [https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3120 Geometry of nilmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure and deformations in the large], 40 pages, arXiv:0901.3120, Proc. London Math. Soc., 99, 425–460, 2009</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Nilpotent Lie groups ===\nFrom the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold.  The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros.\n\nFor example, the [[Heisenberg group]] is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group.  This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient.  The group <math>\\Gamma</math> would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients.  The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional.  One possible [[fundamental domain]] is (isomorphic to) [0,1]<sup>3</sup> with the faces identified in a suitable way.  This is because an element <math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x & z \\\\ & 1 & y \\\\ & & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\Gamma</math> of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element <math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\{x\\} & \\{z-x \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\} \\\\ & 1 & \\{y\\} \\\\ & & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math> in the fundamental domain.  Here <math>\\lfloor x \\rfloor</math> denotes the [[floor function]] of ''x'', and <math>\\{ x \\}</math> the [[Floor_function#Fractional_part|fractional part]].  The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher-order Fourier analysis.<ref>Ben Green and Terence Tao, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/0606088 Linear equations in primes],  Ann. of Math.  Volume 171 (2010), Issue 3, 1753–1850</ref>\n\n=== Abelian Lie groups ===\nA simpler example would be any abelian Lie group.  This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group.  For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers.  The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle <math>\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}</math>.  Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nA parallel construction based on [[solvable group|solvable]] Lie groups produces a class of spaces called '''solvmanifolds'''. An important example of a solvmanifolds are [[Inoue surface]]s, known in [[complex geometry]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Homogeneous spaces]]\n[[Category:Smooth manifolds]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]"

According to Lie, an ''infinitesimal transformation'' is an infinitely small transformation of the one-parameter group that it generates.<ref>[[Sophus Lie]] (1893) [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/lie-_infinite_continuous_groups_-_i.pdf Vorlesungen über Continuierliche Gruppen], English translation by D.H. Delphenich, §8, link from Neo-classical Physics</ref> It is these infinitesimal transformations that generate a [[Lie algebra]] that is used to describe a [[Lie group]] of any dimension.\n\nThe [[action (group theory)|action]] of a one-parameter group on a set is known as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]]. A smooth vector field on a manifold, at a point, induces a ''local flow'' - a one parameter group of local diffeomorphisms, sending points along [[Integral curve#Generalization to differentiable manifolds|integral curves]] of the vector field. The local flow of a vector field is used to define the [[Lie derivative]] of tensor fields along the vector field.\n\n==Examples==\nSuch one-parameter groups are of basic importance in the theory of [[Lie group]]s, for which every element of the associated [[Lie algebra]] defines such a homomorphism, the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]. In the case of matrix groups it is given by the [[matrix exponential]].\n\nAnother important case is seen in [[functional analysis]], with <math>G</math> being the group of [[unitary operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]]. See [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups]].\n\nIn his 1957 monograph ''Lie Groups'', [[P. M.

(1995) ''Applied Functional Analysis: Main Principles and Their Applications'' Springer-Verlag</ref> Furthermore, whenever a system of physical laws admits a one-parameter group of [[derivative|differentiable]] [[symmetry group|symmetries]], then there is a [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], by [[Noether's theorem]].\n\nIn the study of [[spacetime]] the use of the [[unit hyperbola]] to calibrate spatio-temporal measurements has become common since [[Hermann Minkowski]] discussed it in 1908. The [[principle of relativity]] was reduced to arbitrariness of which diameter of the unit hyperbola was used to determine a [[world-line]]. Using the parametrization of the hyperbola with [[hyperbolic angle]], the theory of [[special relativity]] provided a calculus of relative motion with the one-parameter group indexed by [[rapidity]]. The ''rapidity'' replaces the ''velocity'' in kinematics and dynamics of relativity theory. Since rapidity is unbounded, the one-parameter group it stands upon is non-compact. The rapidity concept was introduced by [[E.T. Whittaker]] in 1910, and named by [[Alfred Robb]] the next year. The rapidity parameter amounts to the length of a [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]], a concept of the nineteenth century.

      "title": "Oppenheim conjecture",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheim_conjecture",
      "text": "In [[Diophantine approximation]], the '''Oppenheim conjecture''' concerns representations of numbers by real [[quadratic form]]s in several variables. It was formulated in 1929 by [[Alexander Oppenheim]] and later the conjectured property was further strengthened by [[Harold Davenport]] and Oppenheim. Initial research on this problem took the number ''n'' of variables to be large, and applied a version of the [[Hardy-Littlewood circle method]]. The definitive work of [[Grigory Margulis|Margulis]], settling the conjecture in the affirmative, used methods arising from [[ergodic theory]] and the study of [[discrete subgroup]]s of [[semisimple Lie group]]s.\n\n== Short description ==\n\n[[Meyer's theorem]] states that an indefinite [[integral quadratic form]] ''Q'' in ''n'' variables, ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;5, nontrivially represents zero, i.e. there exists a non-zero vector ''x'' with integer components such that ''Q''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. The Oppenheim conjecture can be viewed as an analogue of this statement for forms ''Q'' that are not multiples of a rational form. It states that in this case, the set of values of ''Q'' on integer vectors is a [[dense subset]] of the [[real line]].\n\n== History ==\n\nSeveral versions of the conjecture were formulated by Oppenheim and [[Harold Davenport]].\n* Let ''Q'' be a real nondegenerate [[indefinite quadratic form]] in ''n'' variables. Suppose that ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3 and ''Q'' is not a multiple of a form with rational coefficients. Then for any ''ε''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there exists a non-zero vector ''x'' with integer components such that |''Q''(''x'')|&nbsp;<&nbsp;''ε''.\n\nFor ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;5 this was conjectured by Oppenheim in 1929; the stronger version is due to Davenport in 1946.\n* Let ''Q'' and ''n'' have the same meaning as before. Then for any ''ε''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there exists a non-zero vector ''x'' with integer components such that 0 < |''Q''(''x'',''x'')| < ''ε''.\n\nThis was conjectured by Oppenheim in 1953 and proved by Birch, Davenport, and Ridout for ''n'' at least 21, and by Davenport and Heilbronn for diagonal forms in five variables. Other partial results are due to  Oppenheim (for forms in four variables,\nbut under the strong restriction that the form represents zero over '''Z'''), Watson, Iwaniec, Baker–Schlickewey. Early work [[analytic number theory]] and [[reduction theory]] of quadratic forms.\n\nThe conjecture was proved in 1987 by Margulis in complete generality using methods of ergodic theory. Geometry of actions of certain unipotent subgroups of the [[orthogonal group]] on the [[homogeneous space]] of the [[lattice (group)|lattices]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> plays a decisive role in this approach. It is sufficient to establish the case ''n'' = 3. The idea to derive the Oppenheim conjecture from a statement about homogeneous group actions is usually attributed to [[M. S. Raghunathan]], who observed in the 1970s that the conjecture for ''n'' = 3 is equivalent to the following property of the space of lattices:\n* Any [[relatively compact]] orbit of SO(2,1) in SL(3,'''R''')/SL(3,'''Z''') is [[compact set|compact]].\n\nHowever, Margulis later remarked that in an implicit form of this equivalence occurred already in a 1955 paper of [[J. W. S. Cassels|Cassels]] and [[H. P. F. Swinnerton-Dyer]], albeit in a different language.\n\nShortly after Margulis's breakthrough, the proof was simplified and generalized by Dani and Margulis. Qualitative versions of the Oppenheim conjecture were later proved by Eskin–Margulis–Mozes. [[Armand Borel|Borel]] and [[Gopal Prasad|Prasad]] established some ''S''-arithmetic analogues. The study of the properties of unipotent and quasiunipotent flows on homogeneous spaces remains an active area of research, with applications to further questions in the theory of [[Diophantine approximation]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Ratner's theorems]]\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite journal | first=Armand | last=Borel | title=Values of indefinite quadratic forms at integral points and flows on spaces of lattices | journal=[[Bull.

      "title": "Orthogonal group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group",
      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Topological}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''orthogonal group''' in dimension {{math|''n''}}, denoted {{math|O(''n'')}}, is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[isometry|distance-preserving transformations]] of a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension {{math|''n''}} that preserve a fixed point, where the group operation is given by [[Function composition|composing]] transformations. Equivalently, it is the group of {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]], where the group operation is given by [[matrix multiplication]]; an orthogonal matrix is a [[real number|real]] matrix whose [[invertible matrix|inverse]] equals its [[transpose]].\n\nAn important subgroup of {{math|O(''n'')}} is the '''special orthogonal group''', denoted {{math|SO(''n'')}}, of the orthogonal matrices of [[determinant]] {{math|1}}. This group is also called the '''rotation group''', because, in dimensions 2 and 3, its elements are the usual [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] around a point (in dimension 2) or a line (in dimension 3). In low dimension, these groups have been widely studied, see {{math|[[SO(2)]]}}, {{math|[[SO(3)]]}} and {{math|[[SO(4)]]}}.\n\nThe term \"orthogonal group\" may also refer to a generalization of the above case: the group of invertible [[linear operator]]s that preserve a non-degenerate [[symmetric bilinear form]] or [[quadratic form]]<ref>For base fields of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] not 2, the definition in terms of a [[symmetric bilinear form]] is equivalent to that in terms of a [[quadratic form]], but in characteristic 2 these notions differ.</ref> on a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]].  In particular, when the bilinear form is the [[scalar product]] on the vector space {{math|''F<sup> n</sup>''}} of dimension {{math|''n''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''F''}}, with quadratic form the sum of squares, then the corresponding orthogonal group, denoted {{math|O(''n'', ''F'' )}}, is the set of {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] with entries from {{math|''F''}}, with the group operation of [[matrix multiplication]]. This is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] {{math|GL(''n'', ''F'' )}} given by\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{O}(n, F) = \\left\\{Q \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, F) \\;\\left|\\; Q^\\mathsf{T} Q = Q Q^\\mathsf{T} = I \\right.\\right\\} ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''Q''}}<sup>T</sup> is the [[transpose]] of {{math|''Q''}} and {{math|''I''}} is the [[identity matrix]].\n\nThis article mainly discusses the orthogonal groups of quadratic forms that may be expressed over some bases as the [[dot product]]; over the reals, they are the [[positive definite quadratic form]]s. Over the reals, for any non-degenerate quadratic form, there is a basis, on which the matrix of the form is a diagonal matrix such that the diagonal entries are either {{math|1}} or {{math|−1}}. Thus the orthogonal group depends only on the numbers of {{math|1}} and of {{math|−1}}, and is denoted {{math|O(''p'', ''q'')}}, where {{math|''p''}} is the number of ones and {{math|''q''}} the number of negative ones. For details, see [[indefinite orthogonal group]].\n\nThe [[commutator subgroup|derived subgroup]] {{math|Ω(''n'', ''F'' )}} of {{math|O(''n'', ''F'')}} is an often studied object because, when {{math|''F''}} is a [[finite field]], {{math|Ω(''n'', ''F'' )}} is often{{clarify|date=February 2013}} a central extension of a finite simple group.\n\nBoth {{math|O(''n'', ''F'' )}} and {{math|SO(''n'', ''F'' )}} are [[algebraic group]]s, because the condition that a matrix be orthogonal (i.e., have its own [[transpose]] as [[inverse matrix|inverse]]) can be expressed as a set of polynomial equations in the entries of the matrix. The [[Cartan–Dieudonné theorem]] describes the structure of the orthogonal group for a non-singular form.\n\n==Name==\n\nThe [[determinant]] of any orthogonal matrix is either {{math|1}} or {{math|−1}}. The orthogonal {{math|''n''}}-by-{{math|''n''}} matrices with determinant {{math|1}} form a [[normal subgroup]] of {{math|O(''n'', ''F'' )}} known as the '''special orthogonal group''' {{math|SO(''n'', ''F'' )}}, consisting of all [[proper rotation]]s. (More precisely, {{math|SO(''n'', ''F'' )}} is the [[Kernel (matrix)|kernel]] of the [[Orthogonal group#The Dickson invariant|Dickson invariant]], discussed below.). By analogy with GL–SL (general linear group, special linear group), the orthogonal group is sometimes called the '''''general'' orthogonal group''' and denoted {{math|GO}}, though this term is also sometimes used for ''indefinite'' orthogonal groups {{math|O(''p'', ''q'')}}. The term '''rotation group''' can be used to describe either the special or general orthogonal group.\n\n==In even and odd dimension==\nThe structure of the orthogonal group differs in certain respects between even and odd dimensions; for example, over [[ordered field]]s (such as [[real number|{{math|'''R'''}}]]) the [[reflection through the origin|{{math|−''I''}} element]] is [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-preserving in even dimensions, but orientation-reversing in odd dimensions. When this distinction is to be emphasized, the groups may be denoted {{math|O(2''k'')}} and {{math|O(2''k'' + 1)}}, reserving {{math|''n''}} for the dimension of the space ({{math|1=''n'' = 2''k''}} or {{math|1=''n'' = 2''k'' + 1}}). The letters {{math|''p''}} or {{math|''r''}} are also used, indicating the [[Rank (Lie algebra)|rank]] of [[#Lie algebra|the corresponding Lie algebra]]; in odd dimension the corresponding Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{so}(2r + 1)</math>, while in even dimension the Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{so}(2r)</math>.\n\nThe distinction between even and odd dimensions arises from considering the maximal torus (discussed below). The groups {{math|SO(2''k'')}} and {{math|SO(2''k'' + 1)}} have the same maximal torus, but different root systems.\n\n==Over the real number field==\nOver the field {{math|'''R'''}} of [[real number]]s, the orthogonal group {{math|O(''n'', '''R''')}} and the special orthogonal group {{math|SO(''n'', '''R''')}} are often simply denoted by {{math|O(''n'')}} and {{math|SO(''n'')}} if no confusion is possible. They form real [[Compact space|compact]] [[Lie group]]s of [[dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] {{math|''n''(''n'' − 1)/2}}. {{math|O(''n'', '''R''')}} has two [[Connected space|connected components]], with {{math|SO(''n'', '''R''')}} being the [[identity component]]; i.e., the connected component containing the [[identity matrix]].\n\n===Presentation as real algebraic variety===\nIf we consider the set of matrices <math>M_{n \\times n}(\\mathbb{R})</math> as <math>\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}</math> and let <math>A = \\left[\\mathbf{x}_1 \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_n\\right]</math> be column vectors representing a matrix, then the orthogonality condition <math>A^\\mathsf{T}A = I</math> is\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\mathbf{x}_1\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_1 & \\mathbf{x}_1\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{x}_1\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_n \\\\\n    \\mathbf{x}_2\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_1 & \\mathbf{x}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{x}_2\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_n \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\cdots & \\vdots \\\\\n    \\mathbf{x}_n\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_1 & \\mathbf{x}_n \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{x}_n \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_n\n  \\end{bmatrix} = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\cdots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nBecause of the [[symmetric matrix|symmetry]] of [[Gramian matrix|these matrices]], this gives <math>\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^n i = n(n + 1)/2</math> scalar equations. This proves that {{math|O(''n'')}} is an [[algebraic set]] of dimension \n:<math>\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} = n^2 - \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2},</math>\n\nwhich is a [[complete intersection]].\n\nThis algebraic set has two [[irreducible component]]s, depending on the sign of the determinant (that is {{math|1=det(''A'') = 1}} or {{math|1=det(''A'') = –1}}), which are [[smooth algebraic variety|smooth algebraic varieties]] of the same dimension {{math|''n''(''n'' – 1)/2}}. The component with {{math|1=det(''A'') = 1}} is {{math|SO(''n'')}}.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nThe real orthogonal and real special orthogonal groups have the following geometric interpretations:\n\n{{math|O(''n'', '''R''')}} is a subgroup of the [[Euclidean group]] {{math|''E''(''n'')}}, the group of [[isometry|isometries]] of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}; it contains those that leave the origin fixed – {{math|1=O(''n'', '''R''') = ''E''(''n'') ∩ GL(''n'', '''R''')}}. It is the [[symmetry group]] of the [[n-sphere|{{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-sphere]] (for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, this is just the [[sphere]]) and all objects with spherical symmetry, if the origin is chosen at the center.\n\n{{math|SO(''n'', '''R''')}} is a subgroup of {{math|''E''<sup>+</sup>(''n'')}}, which consists of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|''direct'' isometries]], i.e., isometries preserving [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]]; it contains those that leave the origin fixed – {{math|1=SO(''n'', '''R''') = ''E''<sup>+</sup>(''n'') ∩ GL(''n'', '''R''') = ''E''(''n'') ∩ GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'', '''R''')}}. It is the rotation group of the sphere and all objects with spherical symmetry, if the origin is chosen at the center.\n\n{{math|{±''I''}}} is a [[normal subgroup]] and even a [[characteristic subgroup]] of {{math|O(''n'', '''R''')}}, and, if {{math|''n''}} is even, also of {{math|SO(''n'', '''R''')}}. If {{math|''n''}} is odd, {{math|O(''n'', '''R''')}} is the internal [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of {{math|SO(''n'', '''R''')}} and {{math|{±''I''}}}. For every positive integer {{math|''k''}} the [[cyclic group]] {{math|''C''<sub>''k''</sub>}} of [[rotational symmetry|{{math|''k''}}-fold rotations]] is a normal subgroup of {{math|O(2, '''R''')}} and {{math|SO(2, '''R''')}}.\n\nRelative to suitable orthogonal bases, the isometries are of the form:\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{matrix}\n    R_1 &        & \\\\\n        & \\ddots & \\\\\n        &        & R_k\n  \\end{matrix} & 0 \\\\\n  0 & \\begin{matrix}\n    \\pm 1 &        & \\\\\n          & \\ddots & \\\\\n          &        & \\pm 1\n  \\end{matrix} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the matrices {{math|''R''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''R''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are 2-by-2 rotation matrices in orthogonal [[planes of rotation]]. As a special case, known as [[Euler's rotation theorem]], any (non-identity) element of {{math|SO(3, '''R''')}} is a [[rotation]] about a uniquely defined axis.\n\nThe orthogonal group is generated by reflections ([[Coordinate rotations and reflections|two reflections give a rotation]]), as in a [[Coxeter group]],<ref group=\"note\">The analogy is stronger: Weyl groups, a class of (representations of) Coxeter groups, can be considered as simple algebraic groups over the [[field with one element]], and there are a number of analogies between algebraic groups and vector spaces on the one hand, and Weyl groups and sets on the other.</ref> and elements have [[length function|length]] at most {{math|''n''}} (require at most {{math|''n''}} reflections to generate; this follows from the above classification, noting that a rotation is generated by 2 reflections, and is true more generally for [[indefinite orthogonal group]]s, by the [[Cartan–Dieudonné theorem]]). A [[Longest element of a Coxeter group|longest element]] (element needing the most reflections) is [[reflection through the origin]] (the map {{math|''v'' ↦ −''v''}}), though so are other maximal combinations of rotations (and a reflection, in odd dimension).\n\nThe [[symmetry group]] of a [[circle]] is {{math|O(2, '''R''')}}.<!--\n[[Dihedral group|Dih]]('''S'''<sup>1</sup>), where '''S'''<sup>1</sup> denotes the multiplicative group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]]&nbsp;1.\n--> The orientation-preserving subgroup {{math|SO(2, '''R''')}}  is isomorphic (as a ''real'' Lie group) to the [[circle group]], also known as {{math|[[unitary group|U]](1)}}.

The [[Weyl group]] of {{math|SO(2''n'' + 1)}} is the [[semidirect product]] <math>\\{\\pm 1\\}^n \\rtimes S_n</math> of a normal [[elementary abelian group|elementary abelian]] [[p-group|2-subgroup]] and a [[symmetric group]], where the nontrivial element of each {{math|{±1}}} factor of {{math|{±1}<sup>''n''</sup>}} acts on the corresponding circle factor of {{math|''T'' × {1}}} by [[multiplicative inverse|inversion]], and the symmetric group {{math|''S<sub>n</sub>''}} acts on both {{math|{±1}<sup>''n''</sup>}} and {{math|''T'' × {1}}} by permuting factors. The elements of the Weyl group are represented by matrices in {{math|O(2''n'') × {±1}}}.\n\nThe {{math|''S<sub>n</sub>''}} factor is represented by block permutation matrices with 2-by-2 blocks, and a final 1 on the diagonal. The {{math|{±1}<sup>''n''</sup>}} component is represented by block-diagonal matrices with 2-by-2 blocks either\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 1 \\\\\n    1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix},\n</math>\n\nwith the last component {{math|±1}} chosen to make the determinant 1.\n\nThe Weyl group of {{math|SO(2''n'')}} is the subgroup <math>H_{n-1} \\rtimes S_n < \\{\\pm 1\\}^n \\rtimes S_n</math> of that of {{math|SO(2''n'' + 1)}}, where {{math|''H''<sub>''n''−1</sub> < {±1}<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the [[kernel (algebra)#Group homomorphism|kernel]] of the product homomorphism {{math|{±1}<sup>''n''</sup> → {±1}}} given by <math>\\left(\\epsilon_1, \\ldots, \\epsilon_n\\right) \\mapsto \\epsilon_1 \\cdots \\epsilon_n</math>; that is, {{math|''H''<sub>''n''−1</sub> < {±1}<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the subgroup with an even number of minus signs. The Weyl group of {{math|SO(2''n'')}} is represented in {{math|SO(2''n'')}} by the preimages under the standard injection {{math|SO(2''n'') → SO(2''n'' + 1)}} of the representatives for the Weyl group of {{math|SO(2''n'' + 1)}}. Those matrices with an odd number of <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}</math> blocks have no remaining final {{math|−1}} coordinate to make their determinants positive, and hence cannot be represented in {{math|SO(2''n'')}}.\n\n===Low-dimensional topology===\nThe low-dimensional (real) orthogonal groups are familiar [[topological space|space]]s:\n* {{math|1=O(1) = ''S''<sup>0</sup>}}, a [[2 (number)|two]]-point [[discrete topology|discrete space]]\n* {{math|1=SO(1) = {1} }}\n* {{math|SO(2)}} is [[circle|{{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}}]]\n* [[Rotation group SO(3)|{{math|SO(3)}}]] is [[real projective space|{{math|'''R'''P<sup>3</sup>}}]] <ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.3.4</ref>\n* {{math|SO(4)}} is [[double cover (topology)|doubly covered]] by {{math|1=[[special unitary group|SU]](2) × SU(2) = [[3-sphere|''S''<sup>3</sup>]] × ''S''<sup>3</sup>}}.\n\n===Fundamental group===\nIn terms of [[algebraic topology]], for {{math|''n'' > 2}} the [[fundamental group]] of {{math|SO(''n'', '''R''')}} is [[Cyclic group|cyclic of order 2]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.10</ref> and the [[spin group]] {{math|Spin(''n'')}} is its [[universal cover]]. For {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} the fundamental group is [[infinite cyclic]] and the universal cover corresponds to the  [[real line]] (the group {{math|Spin(2)}} is the unique connected [[double cover (topology)|2-fold cover]]).\n\n===Homotopy groups===\nGenerally, the [[homotopy group]]s {{math|π<sub>''k''</sub>(''O'')}} of the real orthogonal group are related to [[homotopy groups of spheres]], and thus are in general hard to compute. However, one can compute the homotopy groups of the stable orthogonal group (aka the infinite orthogonal group), defined as the [[direct limit]] of the sequence of inclusions:\n:<math>\\operatorname{O}(0) \\subset \\operatorname{O}(1)\\subset \\operatorname{O}(2) \\subset \\cdots \\subset O = \\bigcup_{k=0}^\\infty \\operatorname{O}(k)</math>\n\nSince the inclusions are all closed, hence [[cofibration]]s, this can also be interpreted as a union. On the other hand, [[n-sphere|{{math|''S''<sup>''n''</sup>}}]] is a [[homogeneous space]] for {{math|O(''n'' + 1)}}, and one has the following [[fiber bundle]]:\n: <math>\\operatorname{O}(n) \\to \\operatorname{O}(n + 1) \\to S^n,</math>\n\nwhich can be understood as \"The orthogonal group {{math|O(''n'' + 1)}} acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on the unit sphere {{math|''S''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, and the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of a point (thought of as a [[unit vector]]) is the orthogonal group of the [[orthogonal complement|perpendicular complement]], which is an orthogonal group one dimension lower. Thus the natural inclusion {{math|O(''n'') → O(''n'' + 1)}} is [[n-connected|{{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-connected]], so the homotopy groups stabilize, and {{math|1=π<sub>''k''</sub>(O(''n'' + 1)) = π<sub>''k''</sub>(O(''n''))}} for {{math|''n'' > ''k'' + 1}}: thus the homotopy groups of the stable space equal the lower homotopy groups of the unstable spaces.\n\nFrom [[Bott periodicity]] we obtain {{math|Ω<sup>8</sup>''O'' ≅ ''O''}}, therefore the homotopy groups of {{math|''O''}} are 8-fold periodic, meaning {{math|1=π<sub>''k'' + 8</sub>(''O'') = π<sub>''k''</sub>(''O'')}}, and one need only to list the lower 8 homotopy groups:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\pi_0 (O) &= \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_1 (O) &= \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_2 (O) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_3 (O) &= \\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_4 (O) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_5 (O) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_6 (O) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_7 (O) &= \\mathbf{Z}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n====Relation to KO-theory====\nVia the [[clutching construction]], homotopy groups of the stable space {{math|''O''}} are identified with stable vector bundles on spheres ([[up to isomorphism]]), with a dimension shift of 1: {{math|1=π<sub>''k''</sub>(''O'') = π<sub>''k'' + 1</sub>(''BO'')}}. Setting {{math|1=''KO'' = ''BO'' × '''Z''' = Ω<sup>−1</sup>''O'' × '''Z'''}} (to make {{math|π<sub>0</sub>}} fit into the periodicity), one obtains:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\pi_0 (KO) &= \\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_1 (KO) &= \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_2 (KO) &= \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_3 (KO) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_4 (KO) &= \\mathbf{Z}\\\\\n  \\pi_5 (KO) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_6 (KO) &= 0\\\\\n  \\pi_7 (KO) &= 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n====Computation and interpretation of homotopy groups====\n\n=====Low-dimensional groups=====\nThe first few homotopy groups can be calculated by using the concrete descriptions of low-dimensional groups.\n\n*{{math|1=π<sub>0</sub>(''O'') = π<sub>0</sub>(O(1)) = '''Z'''/2'''Z'''}}, from [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-preserving/reversing (this class survives to {{math|O(2)}} and hence stably)\n*{{math|1=π<sub>1</sub>(''O'') = π<sub>1</sub>(SO(3)) = '''Z'''/2'''Z'''}}, which is [[spin group|spin]] comes from {{math|1=SO(3) = '''R'''P<sup>3</sup> = ''S''<sup>3</sup>/('''Z'''/2'''Z''')}}.\n*{{math|1=π<sub>2</sub>(''O'') = π<sub>2</sub>(SO(3)) = 0}}, which surjects onto {{math|π<sub>2</sub>(SO(4))}}; this latter thus vanishes.\n\n=====Lie groups=====\nFrom general facts about [[Lie group]]s, {{math|π<sub>2</sub>(''G'')}} always vanishes, and {{math|π<sub>3</sub>(''G'')}} is free ([[free abelian group|free abelian]]).\n\n=====Vector bundles=====\nFrom the vector bundle point of view, {{math|π<sub>0</sub>(''K''O)}} is vector bundles over {{math|''S''<sup>0</sup>}}, which is two points. Thus over each point, the bundle is trivial, and the non-triviality of the bundle is the difference between the dimensions of the vector spaces over the two points, so {{math|1=π<sub>0</sub>(''K''O) = '''[[integers|Z]]'''}} is [[Hamel dimension|dimension]].\n\n=====Loop spaces=====\nUsing concrete descriptions of the loop spaces in [[Bott periodicity]], one can interpret the higher homotopies of {{math|''O''}} in terms of simpler-to-analyze homotopies of lower order. Using π<sub>0</sub>, {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''O''/U}} have two components, {{math|1=''K''O = ''B''O × '''Z'''}} and {{math|1=''K''Sp = ''B''Sp × '''Z'''}} have [[countably many]] components, and the rest are connected.\n\n====Interpretation of homotopy groups====\nIn a nutshell:<ref>[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week105.html John Baez \"This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics\" week 105]</ref>\n\n*{{math|1=π<sub>0</sub>(''K''O) = '''Z'''}} is about [[Hamel dimension|dimension]]\n*{{math|1=π<sub>1</sub>(''K''O) = '''Z'''/2'''Z'''}} is about [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]\n*{{math|1=π<sub>2</sub>(''K''O) = '''Z'''/2'''Z'''}} is about [[spin group|spin]]\n*{{math|1=π<sub>4</sub>(''K''O) = '''Z'''}} is about [[topological quantum field theory]].\n\nLet {{math|''R''}} be any of the four [[division algebra]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}}, {{math|'''[[quaternions|H]]'''}}, {{math|'''[[octonions|O]]'''}},<!-- since '''H''' and '''O''' are not fields, and also to avoid conflict with the lead, I change the former ''F'' notation to ''R'' (ring) --Incnis Mrsi --> and let {{math|''L<sub>R</sub>''}} be the [[tautological line bundle]] over the [[projective line]] {{math|''R''P<sup>1</sup>}}, and {{math|[''L<sub>R</sub>'']}} its class in K-theory.

This is done by constructing [[short exact sequence]]s starting with an [[Eilenberg&ndash;MacLane space]] for the homotopy group to be removed. The first few entries in the tower are the [[spin group]] and the [[string group]], and are preceded by the [[fivebrane group]].  The homotopy groups that are killed are in turn {{pi}}<sub>0</sub>(''O'') to obtain ''SO'' from ''O'', {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''O'') to obtain ''Spin'' from ''SO'', {{pi}}<sub>3</sub>(''O'') to obtain ''String'' from ''Spin'', and then {{pi}}<sub>7</sub>(''O'') and so on to obtain the higher order [[brane]]s.\n\n==Over the complex number field==\nOver the field {{math|'''C'''}} of [[complex number]]s, {{math|O(''n'', '''C''')}} and {{math|SO(''n'', '''C''')}} are complex Lie groups of dimension {{math|''n''(''n'' − 1)/2}} over {{math|'''C'''}} (it means the dimension over {{math|'''R'''}} is twice that). {{math|O(''n'', '''C''')}} has two connected components, and {{math|SO(''n'', '''C''')}} is the connected component containing the identity matrix. For {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}} these groups are noncompact.\n\nJust as in the real case {{math|SO(''n'', '''C''')}} is not simply connected.

Over fields that are not of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 2 it is equivalent to the determinant: the determinant is −1 to the power of the Dickson invariant.\nOver fields of characteristic 2, the determinant is always 1, so the Dickson invariant gives more information than the determinant.\n\nThe special orthogonal group is the [[Kernel (matrix)|kernel]] of the Dickson invariant<ref name=Knus224/> and usually has index 2 in {{math|O(''n'', ''F'' )}}.<ref>{{harv|Taylor|1992|loc=page 160}}</ref> When the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is not 2, the Dickson Invariant is {{math|0}} whenever the determinant is {{math|1}}.

Each element in {{math|O(''n'', ''F'' )}} has determinant {{math|±1}}. Thus in characteristic 2, the determinant is always {{math|1}}.\n\nThe Dickson invariant can also be defined for [[Clifford group]]s and [[Pin group]]s in a similar way (in all dimensions).\n\n==Orthogonal groups of characteristic 2==\nOver fields of characteristic 2 orthogonal groups often exhibit special behaviors, some of which are listed in this section. (Formerly these groups were known as the '''hypoabelian groups''', but this term is no longer used.)\n\n*Any orthogonal group over any field is generated by reflections, except for a unique example where the vector space is 4-dimensional over the field with 2 elements and the [[Witt index]] is 2.<ref>{{harv|Grove|2002|loc=Theorem 6.6 and 14.16}}</ref> Note that a reflection in characteristic two has a slightly different definition.  In characteristic two, the reflection orthogonal to a vector {{math|'''u'''}} takes a vector {{math|'''v'''}} to {{math|'''v''' + ''B''('''v''', '''u''')/Q('''u''') · '''u'''}} where {{math|''B''}} is the bilinear form and {{math|''Q''}} is the quadratic form associated to the orthogonal geometry.  Compare this to the [[Householder reflection]] of odd characteristic or characteristic zero, which takes {{math|'''v'''}} to {{math|'''v''' − 2·''B''('''v''', '''u''')/Q('''u''') · '''u'''}}.\n*The [[center of a group|center]] of the orthogonal group usually has order 1 in characteristic 2, rather than 2, since {{math|1=''I'' = −''I''}}.\n*In odd dimensions {{math|2''n'' + 1}} in characteristic 2, orthogonal groups over [[perfect field]]s are the same as [[symplectic group]]s in dimension {{math|2''n''}}. In fact the symmetric form is alternating in characteristic 2, and as the dimension is odd it must have a kernel of dimension 1, and the quotient by this kernel is a symplectic space of dimension {{math|2''n''}}, acted upon by the orthogonal group.\n*In even dimensions in characteristic 2 the orthogonal group is a subgroup of the symplectic group, because the symmetric bilinear form of the quadratic form is also an alternating form.\n\n==The spinor norm<!-- This section is linked from [[Clifford algebra]] -->==\nThe '''spinor norm''' is a homomorphism from an orthogonal group over a field {{math|''F''}} to the [[quotient group]] {{math|''F''<sup>×</sup>/(''F''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup>}} (the [[multiplicative group]] of the field {{math|''F''}} [[up to]] multiplication by [[square (algebra)|square]] elements), that takes reflection in a vector of norm {{math|''n''}} to the image of {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''F''<sup>×</sup>/(''F''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref name=C178>{{harvnb|Cassels|1978|p=178}}</ref>\n\nFor the usual orthogonal group over the reals it is trivial, but it is often non-trivial over other fields, or for the orthogonal group of a quadratic form over the reals that is not positive definite.\n\n==Galois cohomology and orthogonal groups==\nIn the theory of [[Galois cohomology]] of [[algebraic group]]s, some further points of view are introduced. They have explanatory value, in particular in relation with the theory of quadratic forms; but were for the most part ''post hoc'', as far as the discovery of the phenomena is concerned. The first point is that [[quadratic form]]s over a field can be identified as a Galois {{math|''H''<sup>1</sup>}}, or twisted forms ([[torsor]]s) of an orthogonal group. As an algebraic group, an orthogonal group is in general neither connected nor simply-connected; the latter point brings in the spin phenomena, while the former is related to the [[discriminant]].\n\nThe 'spin' name of the spinor norm can be explained by a connection to the [[spin group]] (more accurately a [[pin group]]). This may now be explained quickly by Galois cohomology (which however postdates the introduction of the term by more direct use of [[Clifford algebra]]s). The spin covering of the orthogonal group provides a [[short exact sequence]] of [[algebraic group]]s.\n\n:<math> 1 \\rightarrow \\mu_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Pin}_V \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_V} \\rightarrow 1 </math>\n\nHere {{math|μ<sub>2</sub>}} is the [[Group scheme of roots of unity|algebraic group of square roots of 1]]; over a field of characteristic not 2 it is roughly the same as a two-element group with trivial Galois action. The [[connecting homomorphism]] from {{math|''H''<sup>0</sup>(O<sub>V</sub>)}}, which is simply the group  {{math|O<sub>V</sub>(''F'')}} of {{math|''F''}}-valued points, to  {{math|''H''<sup>1</sup>(μ<sub>2</sub>)}} is essentially the spinor norm, because {{math|''H''<sup>1</sup>(μ<sub>2</sub>)}} is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the field modulo squares.\n\nThere is also the connecting homomorphism from {{math|''H''<sup>1</sup>}} of the orthogonal group, to the {{math|''H''<sup>2</sup>}} of the kernel of the spin covering. The cohomology is non-abelian, so that this is as far as we can go, at least with the conventional definitions.\n\n==Lie algebra==\n{{anchor|orthogonal Lie algebra}}{{anchor|special orthogonal Lie algebra}}\nThe [[Lie algebra]] corresponding to Lie groups {{math|O(''n'', ''F'' )}} and {{math|SO(''n'', ''F'' )}} consists of the [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices, with the Lie bracket {{math|[ , ]}} given by the [[commutator]]. One Lie algebra corresponds to both groups. It is often denoted by <math>\\mathfrak{o}(n, F)</math> or <math>\\mathfrak{so}(n, F)</math>, and called the '''orthogonal Lie algebra''' or '''special orthogonal Lie algebra'''. Over real numbers, these Lie algebras for different {{math|''n''}} are the [[compact real form]]s of two of the four families of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s: in odd dimension {{math|B<sub>''k''</sub>}}, where {{math|1=''n'' = 2''k'' + 1}}, while in even dimension {{math|D<sub>''r''</sub>}}, where {{math|1=''n'' = 2''r''}}.\n\nSince the group SO(''n'') is not simply connected, the representation theory of the orthogonal Lie algebras includes both representations corresponding to ''ordinary'' representations of the orthogonal groups, and representations corresponding to ''projective'' representations of the orthogonal groups. (The projective representations of SO(''n'') are just linear representations of the universal cover, the [[spin group]] Spin(''n'').) The latter are the so-called [[spin representation]], which are important in physics.\n\nMore intrinsically, given a vector space with an inner product{{clarify|reason=This is presumably intended to be a nondegenerate bilinear form, not an [[inner product]]|date=March 2017}}, the special orthogonal Lie algebra is given by the [[bivector]]s on the space, which are sums of simple bivectors ([[blade (geometry)|2-blades]]) {{math|'''v''' ∧ '''w'''}}. The correspondence is given by the map <math>\\mathbf{v} \\wedge \\mathbf{w} \\mapsto \\mathbf{v}^* \\otimes \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^* \\otimes \\mathbf{v},</math> where {{math|'''v'''<sup>∗</sup>}} is the [[covector]] dual to the vector {{math|'''v'''}};{{clarify|reason=Given a nondegenerate bilinear form, there is a natural map from the vectors onto covectors (see Bilinear_form#Maps_to_the dual_space); the term \"covector dual to the vector\" is inappropriate though and should be rephased.|date=March 2017}} in coordinates these are exactly the elementary skew-symmetric{{clarify|reason=This should presumably be \"alternating\", to cover the case of fields of characteristic 2.|date=March 2017}} matrices.\n\nOver real numbers, this characterization is used in interpreting the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field (naturally a 2-vector) as an infinitesimal rotation or \"curl\", hence the name. Generalizing the inner product with a [[nondegenerate form]] yields the indefinite orthogonal Lie algebras <math>\\mathfrak{so}(p, q).</math>\n\n==Related groups==\nThe orthogonal groups and special orthogonal groups have a number of important subgroups, supergroups, quotient groups, and covering groups. These are listed below.\n\nThe inclusions {{math|1=O(''n'') ⊂ U(''n'') ⊂ Sp(''n'') = USp(2''n'')}} and {{math|1=USp(''n'') ⊂ U(''n'') ⊂ O(2''n'')}} are part of a sequence of 8 inclusions used in a [[Bott periodicity theorem#Geometric model of loop spaces|geometric proof of the Bott periodicity theorem]], and the corresponding quotient spaces are [[symmetric space]]s of independent interest – for example, {{math|U(''n'')/O(''n'')}} is the [[Lagrangian Grassmannian]].\n\n===Lie subgroups===\nIn physics, particularly in the areas of [[Kaluza–Klein]] compactification, it is important to find out the subgroups of the orthogonal group. The main ones are:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{O}(n) \\supset \\mathrm{O}(n - 1)</math> – preserve an axis\n:<math>\\mathrm{O}(2n) \\supset \\mathrm{U}(n) \\supset \\mathrm{SU}(n)</math> – {{math|U(''n'')}} are those that preserve a compatible complex structure ''or'' a compatible symplectic structure – see [[Unitary group#2-out-of-3 property|2-out-of-3 property]]; {{math|SU(''n'')}} also preserves a complex orientation.\n:<math>\\mathrm{O}(2n) \\supset \\mathrm{USp}(n)</math>\n:<math>\\mathrm{O}(7) \\supset \\mathrm{G}_2</math>\n\n===Lie supergroups===\nThe orthogonal group {{math|O(''n'')}} is also an important subgroup of various Lie groups:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n     \\mathrm{U}(n) \\supset \\mathrm{SU}(n) &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(n) \\\\\n                         \\mathrm{USp}(2n) &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(n) \\\\\n                             \\mathrm{G}_2 &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(3) \\\\\n                             \\mathrm{F}_4 &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(9) \\\\\n                             \\mathrm{E}_6 &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(10) \\\\\n                             \\mathrm{E}_7 &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(12) \\\\\n                             \\mathrm{E}_8 &\\supset \\mathrm{O}(16)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n====Conformal group====\n{{Main|Conformal group}}\n\nBeing [[isometry|isometries]], real orthogonal transforms preserve [[angle]]s, and are thus [[conformal map]]s, though not all conformal linear transforms are orthogonal. In classical terms this is the difference between [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] and [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]], as exemplified by SSS (side-side-side) [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|congruence of triangles]] and AAA (angle-angle-angle) [[similar triangles|similarity of triangles]]. The group of conformal linear maps of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is denoted {{math|CO(''n'')}} for the '''conformal orthogonal group''', and consists of the product of the orthogonal group with the group of [[Homothetic transformation|dilations]]. If {{math|''n''}} is odd, these two subgroups do not intersect, and they are a [[direct product of groups|direct product]]: {{math|1=CO(2''k'' + 1) = O(2''k'' + 1) × '''R'''<sup>∗</sup>}}, where {{math|1='''R'''<sup>∗</sup> = '''R'''∖{0}}} is the real [[multiplicative group]], while if {{math|''n''}} is even, these subgroups intersect in {{math|±1}}, so this is not a direct product, but it is a direct product with the subgroup of dilation by a positive scalar: {{math|1=CO(2''k'') = O(2''k'') × '''R'''<sup>+</sup>}}.\n\nSimilarly one can define {{math|CSO(''n'')}}; note that this is always: {{math|1=CSO(''n'') = CO(''n'') ∩ GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'') = SO(''n'') × '''R'''<sup>+</sup>}}.\n\n===Discrete subgroups===\nAs the orthogonal group is compact, discrete subgroups are equivalent to finite subgroups.<ref group=\"note\">Infinite subsets of a compact space have an [[accumulation point]] and are not discrete.</ref> These subgroups are known as [[point group]]s and can be realized as the symmetry groups of [[polytope]]s. A very important class of examples are the [[finite Coxeter group]]s, which include the symmetry groups of [[regular polytope]]s.\n\nDimension 3 is particularly studied – see [[point groups in three dimensions]], [[polyhedral group]]s, and [[list of spherical symmetry groups]]. In 2 dimensions, the finite groups are either cyclic or dihedral – see [[point groups in two dimensions]].\n\nOther finite subgroups include:\n* [[Permutation matrices]] (the [[Coxeter group]] {{math|A<sub>''n''</sub>}})\n* [[Signed permutation matrices]] (the [[Coxeter group]] {{math|B<sub>''n''</sub>}}); also equals the intersection of the orthogonal group with the [[integer matrix|integer matrices]].<ref group=\"note\">{{math|O(''n'') ∩ [[general linear group|GL]](''n'', '''Z''')}} equals the signed permutation matrices because an integer vector of norm 1 must have a single non-zero entry, which must be {{math|±1}} (if it has two non-zero entries or a larger entry, the norm will be larger than 1), and in an orthogonal matrix these entries must be in different coordinates, which is exactly the signed permutation matrices.</ref>\n\n===Covering and quotient groups===\nThe orthogonal group is neither [[simply connected]] nor [[centerless]], and thus has both a [[covering group]] and a [[quotient group]], respectively:\n* Two covering [[Pin group]]s, {{math|Pin<sub>+</sub>(''n'') → O(''n'')}} and {{math|Pin<sub>−</sub>(''n'') → O(''n'')}},\n* The quotient [[projective orthogonal group]], {{math|O(''n'') → PO(''n'')}}.\nThese are all 2-to-1 covers.\n\nFor the special orthogonal group, the corresponding groups are:\n* [[Spin group]], {{math|Spin(''n'') → SO(''n'')}},\n* [[Projective special orthogonal group]], {{math|SO(''n'') → PSO(''n'')}}.\nSpin is a 2-to-1 cover, while in even dimension, {{math|PSO(2''k'')}} is a 2-to-1 cover, and in odd dimension {{math|PSO(2''k'' + 1)}} is a 1-to-1 cover; i.e., isomorphic to {{math|SO(2''k'' + 1)}}. These groups, {{math|Spin(''n'')}}, {{math|SO(''n'')}}, and {{math|PSO(''n'')}} are Lie group forms of the compact [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]], <math>\\mathfrak{so}(n, \\mathbb{R})</math> – Spin is the simply connected form, while PSO is the centerless form, and SO is in general neither.<ref group=\"note\">In odd dimension, {{math|SO(2''k'' + 1) ≅ PSO(2''k'' + 1)}} is centerless (but not simply connected), while in even dimension {{math|SO(2''k'')}} is neither centerless nor simply connected.</ref>\n\nIn dimension 3 and above these are the covers and quotients, while dimension 2 and below are somewhat degenerate; see specific articles for details.\n\n==Principal homogeneous space: Stiefel manifold==\n{{Main|Stiefel manifold}}\nThe [[principal homogeneous space]] for the orthogonal group {{math|O(''n'')}} is the [[Stiefel manifold]] {{math|''V<sub>n</sub>''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} of [[Orthonormal basis|orthonormal bases]] (orthonormal [[k-frame|{{math|''n''}}-frames]]).\n\nIn other words, the space of orthonormal bases is like the orthogonal group, but without a choice of base point: given an orthogonal space, there is no natural choice of orthonormal basis, but once one is given one, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bases and the orthogonal group. Concretely, a linear map is determined by where it sends a basis: just as an invertible map can take any basis to any other basis, an orthogonal map can take any ''orthogonal'' basis to any other ''orthogonal'' basis.\n\nThe other Stiefel manifolds {{math|''V<sub>k</sub>''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} for {{math|''k'' < ''n''}} of ''incomplete'' orthonormal bases (orthonormal {{math|''k''}}-frames) are still homogeneous spaces for the orthogonal group, but not ''principal'' homogeneous spaces: any {{math|''k''}}-frame can be taken to any other {{math|''k''}}-frame by an orthogonal map, but this map is not uniquely determined.\n\n==See also==\n\n===Specific transforms===\n*[[Coordinate rotations and reflections]]\n*[[Reflection through the origin]]\n\n===Specific groups===\n*rotation group, [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3, '''R''')]]\n*[[SO(8)]]\n\n===Related groups===\n*[[indefinite orthogonal group]]\n*[[unitary group]]\n*[[symplectic group]]\n\n===Lists of groups===\n*[[list of finite simple groups]]\n*[[list of simple Lie groups]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group = note }}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation | first=J.W.S. | last=Cassels | authorlink=J.

In [[quantum mechanics]], they occur in the [[Pauli equation]] which takes into account the interaction of the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle with an external [[electromagnetic field]].\n\nEach Pauli matrix is [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]], and together with the identity matrix {{mvar|I}} (sometimes considered as the zeroth Pauli matrix {{math|''σ''<sub>0</sub>}}), the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ''real'' coefficients) form a basis for the [[vector space]] of {{math|2 × 2}} [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]].\n\nHermitian operators represent [[observable]]s, so the Pauli matrices span the space of observables of the {{math|2}}-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]].

It is straightforward to show, using the properties listed above, that\n:: <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\, \\sigma^i\\sigma^j = 2\\delta_{ij}</math>\n: where \"tr\" denotes the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]], and hence that \n:: <math>\\begin{align}\n                 c &= \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}\\,M,\\ \\ a_i = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}\\,\\sigma^i M ~. \\\\[3pt]\n  \\therefore ~~ 2M &= I \\operatorname{tr}\\, M + \\sum_i \\sigma^i \\operatorname{tr}\\, \\sigma^i M ~,\n\\end{align}</math>\n: which can be rewritten in terms of matrix indices as\n:: <math>2M_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} M_{\\gamma\\gamma} + \\sum_i \\sigma^i_{\\alpha\\beta} \\sigma^i_{\\gamma\\delta} M_{\\delta\\gamma}~,</math>\n: where [[Einstein notation|summation is implied]] over the repeated indices ''γ'' and ''δ''.  Since this is true for any choice of the matrix ''M'', the completeness relation follows as stated above.\n \nAs noted above, it is common to denote the 2 &times; 2 unit matrix by ''σ''<sub>0</sub>, so ''σ''<sup>0</sup><sub>''αβ''</sub> = ''δ''<sub>''αβ''</sub>.  \nThe completeness relation can alternatively be expressed as\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^3 \\sigma^i_{\\alpha\\beta}\\sigma^i_{\\gamma\\delta} = 2 \\delta_{\\alpha\\delta} \\delta_{\\beta\\gamma}~.</math>\n\nThe fact that any {{math|2 × 2}} complex Hermitian matrices can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices also leads to the [[Bloch sphere]] representation of {{math|2 × 2}} [[mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]s' density matrix, ({{math|2 × 2}} positive semidefinite matrices with trace {{math|1}}).  This can be seen by simply first writing an arbitrary  Hermitian matrix as a real linear combination of {{math|{<nowiki/>''σ''<sub>0</sub>, ''σ''<sub>1</sub>, ''σ''<sub>2</sub>, ''σ''<sub>3</sub>}<nowiki/>}} as above, and then imposing the positive-semidefinite and [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] {{math|1}} conditions.\n\n=== Relation with the permutation operator ===\nLet {{math|''P<sub>ij</sub>''}} be the [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] (also known as a permutation) between two spins {{math|''σ''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''σ''<sub>''j''</sub>}} living in the [[tensor product]] space {{math|ℂ<sup>2</sup> &otimes; ℂ<sup>2</sup>}},\n:<math>P_{ij}|\\sigma_i \\sigma_j\\rangle =  |\\sigma_j \\sigma_i\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\nThis operator can also be written more explicitly as [[Exchange interaction#Inclusion of spin|Dirac's spin exchange operator]],\n:<math>P_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\sigma}_i\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}_j + 1)\\,.</math>\n\nIts eigenvalues are therefore<ref>Explicitly, in the convention of \"right-space matrices into elements of left-space matrices\", it is  <math>\\quad\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\  \n  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  \n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)~.</math></ref> 1 or −1.

Direct calculation, as above,  shows that the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{su}_2</math> is the 3-dimensional real algebra [[linear span|spanned]] by the set {{math|{''iσ<sub>j</sub>''}}}. In compact notation,\n:<math> \\mathfrak{su}(2) = \\operatorname{span} \\{ i \\sigma_1, i \\sigma_2 , i \\sigma_3 \\}.</math>\n\nAs a result, each {{math|''iσ<sub>j</sub>''}} can be seen as an [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|infinitesimal generator]] of SU(2). The elements of SU(2) are exponentials of linear combinations of these three generators, and multiply as indicated above in discussing the Pauli vector. Although this suffices to generate SU(2), it is not a proper [[Representation theory of SU(2)|representation of {{math|su(2)}}]], as the Pauli eigenvalues are scaled unconventionally. The conventional normalization is {{math|1=''λ'' =}}&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}, so that\n:<math> \\mathfrak{su}(2) = \\operatorname{span} \\left\\{\\frac{i \\sigma_1}{2}, \\frac{i \\sigma_2}{2}, \\frac{i \\sigma_3}{2} \\right\\}.</math>\n\nAs SU(2) is a compact group, its [[Cartan decomposition]] is trivial.\n\n=== SO(3) ===\nThe Lie algebra {{math|'''su'''(2)}} is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(3)}}, which corresponds to the Lie group [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]], the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[rotation]]s in three-dimensional space.  In other words, one can say that the {{math|''iσ<sub>j</sub>''}} are a realization (and, in fact, the lowest-dimensional realization) of ''infinitesimal'' rotations in three-dimensional space.  However, even though {{math|'''su'''(2)}} and {{math|'''so'''(3)}} are isomorphic as Lie algebras, {{math|SU(2)}} and {{math|SO(3)}} are not isomorphic as Lie groups.  {{math|SU(2)}} is actually a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of {{math|SO(3)}}, meaning that there is a two-to-one group homomorphism from {{math|SU(2)}} to {{math|SO(3)}}, see [[Rotation group SO(3)#Relationship between SO(3) and SU(2)|relationship between SO(3) and SU(2)]].\n\n=== Quaternions ===\nThe real linear span of {{math|{<nowiki/>''I'', ''iσ''<sub>1</sub>, ''iσ''<sub>2</sub>, ''iσ''<sub>3</sub>}<nowiki/>}} is isomorphic to the real algebra of [[quaternions]] {{math|ℍ}}.  The isomorphism from {{math|ℍ}} to this set is given by the following map (notice the reversed signs for the Pauli matrices):\n:<math>\n  1 \\mapsto I, \\quad\n  i \\mapsto - i \\sigma_1, \\quad\n  j \\mapsto - i \\sigma_2, \\quad\n  k \\mapsto - i \\sigma_3.\n</math>\n\nAlternatively, the isomorphism can be achieved by a map using the Pauli matrices in reversed order,<ref>{{Cite book| first=Mikio |last=Nakahara | title=Geometry, topology, and physics | edition=2nd | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-7503-0606-5 | year=2003|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

As an immediate consequence of the Cartan decomposition mentioned above, {{math|''iσ<sub>j</sub>''}} are the generators of a [[projective representation]] ('''spin representation''') of the [[rotation group SO(3)]] acting on [[theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] particles with spin ½.  The [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|states]] of the particles are represented as two-component [[Spinors in three dimensions|spinors]]. In the same way, the Pauli matrices are related to the [[Isospin|isospin operator]].\n\nAn interesting property of spin ½ particles is that they must be rotated by an angle of 4{{mvar|π}} in order to return to their original configuration.  This is due to the two-to-one correspondence between SU(2) and SO(3) mentioned above, and the fact that, although one visualizes spin up/down as the north/south pole on the [[2-sphere]] {{mvar|S}} <sup>2</sup>, they are actually represented by [[orthogonal]] vectors in the two dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]].\n\nFor a spin ½ particle, the spin operator is given by {{math|'''''J''''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}'''''&sigma;'''''}}, the [[fundamental representation]] of [[representation theory of SU(2)|''SU(2)'']]. By taking [[Kronecker product]]s of this representation with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations.  That is, the  resulting [[spin operator]]s for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions,  for arbitrarily large ''j'',  can be calculated using this [[spin operator]] and [[Ladder operator#Angular momentum|ladder operators]]. They can be found in [[Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra]]. The analog formula to the above generalization of Euler's formula for Pauli matrices, the group element in terms of spin matrices, is tractable, but less simple.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3842/SIGMA.2014.084|last = Curtright|last2 = Fairlie|last3 = Zachos |first = T L |first2 = D B |first3 = C K|authorlink=Thomas Curtright|authorlink2=David Fairlie|authorlink3=Cosmas Zachos|year = 2014|title = A compact formula for rotations as spin matrix polynomials| journal =SIGMA| volume=10| page=084|arxiv = 1402.3541 |bibcode = 2014SIGMA..10..084C }}</ref>\n\nAlso useful in the [[quantum mechanics]] of multiparticle systems, the general [[Pauli group]] {{math|''G<sub>n</sub>''}} is defined to consist of all {{mvar|n}}-fold [[tensor]] products of Pauli matrices.\n\n=== Relativistic quantum mechanics ===\nIn [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], the spinors in four dimensions are 4 × 1 (or 1 × 4) matrices. Hence the Pauli matrices or the Sigma matrices operating on these spinors have to be 4 × 4 matrices. They are defined in terms of 2 × 2 Pauli matrices as\n:<math>\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_i = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathsf{\\sigma}_i & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mathsf{\\sigma}_i \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt follows from this definition that <math>\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_i</math> matrices have the same algebraic properties as <math>\\mathsf{\\sigma}_i</math> matrices.\n\nHowever, [[relativistic angular momentum]] is not a three-vector, but a second order [[four-tensor]]. Hence <math>\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_i</math> needs to be replaced by <math>\\Sigma_{\\mu\\nu}</math>, the generator of [[representation theory of the Lorentz group#The (1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2) spin representation|Lorentz transformations on spinors]]. By the antisymmetry of angular momentum, the <math>\\Sigma_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are also antisymmetric. Hence there are only six independent matrices.\n\nThe first three are the <math> \\mathsf{\\Sigma}_{jk}\\equiv \\epsilon_{ijk}\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_i .</math> The remaining three, <math>\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_{0i}\\equiv\\mathsf{\\alpha}_i</math>, are the [[Dirac equation|Dirac <math>\\mathsf{\\alpha}_i</math> matrices]] defined as\n:<math>\\mathsf{\\alpha}_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\mathsf{\\sigma}_i\\\\ \\mathsf{\\sigma}_i & 0\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe relativistic spin matrices <math>\\Sigma_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are written in  compact form in terms of commutator of [[gamma matrices]] as\n:<math>\\Sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu\\right]</math>.\n\n=== Quantum information ===\nIn [[quantum information]], single-[[qubit]] [[quantum gate]]s are ''2'' × ''2'' unitary matrices.  The Pauli matrices are some of the most important single-qubit operations.  In that context, the Cartan decomposition given above is called the ''Z–Y decomposition of a single-qubit gate''.  Choosing a different Cartan pair gives a similar ''X–Y decomposition of a single-qubit gate''.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Spinors in three dimensions]]\n* [[Gamma matrices]]\n** {{section link|Gamma matrices|Dirac basis|nopage=y}}\n* [[Angular momentum]]\n* [[Gell-Mann matrices]]\n* [[Poincaré group]]\n* [[Generalizations of Pauli matrices]]\n* [[Bloch sphere]]\n* [[Euler's four-square identity]]\n* For higher spin generalizations of the Pauli matrices, see {{section link|spin (physics)#Higher spins}}\n\n== Remarks ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | author=[[Liboff, Richard L.]] | title=Introductory Quantum Mechanics | publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=2002 | isbn=0-8053-8714-5}}\n*{{cite book | author=Schiff, Leonard I. | title=Quantum Mechanics | publisher=McGraw-Hill  | year=1968 | isbn= 978-0070552876}}\n*{{cite book | author=Leonhardt, Ulf | title=Essential Quantum Optics | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2010 | isbn=0-521-14505-8}}\n\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Matrices]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Mathematical physics]]"

It maps 2-to-1 to the [[orthogonal group]], just as the [[spin group]] maps 2-to-1 to the [[special orthogonal group]].\n\nIn general the map from the Pin group to the orthogonal group is ''not'' onto or a [[universal covering space]], but if the quadratic form is definite (and dimension is greater than 2), it is both.\n\nThe non-trivial element of the kernel is denoted −1, which should not be confused with the orthogonal transform of [[reflection through the origin]], generally denoted −''I''.\n\n==General definition==\n{{See also|Clifford algebra#Spin_and_Pin_groups}}\n\n==Definite form==\n[[Image:Spin-Pin-SO-O-definite.svg|right]]\n\nThe pin group of a definite form maps onto the orthogonal group, and each component is simply connected: it [[Double covering group|double cover]]s the orthogonal group.

Using the \"+\" sign convention for Clifford algebras (where <math>v^2=Q(v) \\in C\\ell(V,Q)</math>), one writes\n:<math>\\mbox{Pin}_+(n) := \\mbox{Pin}(n,0) \\qquad \\mbox{Pin}_-(n) := \\mbox{Pin}(0,n)</math>\nand these both map onto O(''n'') = O(''n'', 0) = O(0, ''n'').\n\nBy contrast, we have the natural isomorphism<ref group=\"note\">They are included into different algebras <math>C\\ell(n,0) \\not\\cong C\\ell(0,n)</math>, but they are equal as subsets of the vector spaces <math>C\\ell(n,0) = C\\ell(0,n) = \\Lambda^* \\mathbf{R}^n</math>, and carry the same product structure, hence they are naturally identified.</ref> Spin(''n'', 0) ≅ Spin(0, ''n'') and they are both the (unique) non-trivial [[double cover (topology)|double cover]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n''), which is the (unique) [[universal cover]] for ''n'' ≥ 3.\n\n==Indefinite form==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\nThere are as many as eight different double covers of [[generalized orthogonal group|O(''p'', ''q'')]], for ''p'', ''q'' ≠ 0, which correspond to the extensions of the center (which is either ''C''<sub>2</sub> × ''C''<sub>2</sub> or ''C''<sub>4</sub>) by ''C''<sub>2</sub>. Only two of them are pin groups&mdash;those that admit the [[Clifford algebra]] as a representation.

For a disconnected topological group, there is a unique universal cover of the identity component of the group, and one can take the same cover as topological spaces on the other components (which are [[principal homogeneous space]]s for the identity component) but the group structure on other components is not uniquely determined in general.\n\nThe Pin and Spin groups are ''particular'' topological groups associated to the orthogonal and special orthogonal groups, coming from Clifford algebras: there are other similar groups, corresponding to other double covers or to other group structures on the other components, but they are not referred to as Pin or Spin groups, nor studied much.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrzej Trautman]]<ref group=\"note\">{{cite journal|title=Double Covers of Pseudo-orthogonal Groups|author=A.

Explicitly, a reflection has order 2 in O(''V''), ''r''<sup>2</sup> = 1, so the square of the preimage of a reflection (which has determinant one) must be in the kernel of Spin<sub>±</sub>(''V'') → SO(''V''), so <math>\\tilde r^2 = \\pm 1</math>, and either choice determines a pin group (since all reflections are conjugate by an element of SO(''V''), which is connected, all reflections must square to the same value).\n\nConcretely, in Pin<sub>+</sub>, <math>\\tilde r</math> has order 2, and the preimage of a subgroup {1, ''r''} is ''C''<sub>2</sub> × ''C''<sub>2</sub>: if one repeats the same [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] twice, one gets the identity.\n\nIn Pin<sub>−</sub>, <math>\\tilde r</math> has order 4, and the preimage of a subgroup {1, ''r''} is ''C''<sub>4</sub>: if one repeats the same reflection twice, one gets \"a [[rotation]] by 2π\"—the non-trivial element of Spin(''V'') → SO(''V'') can be interpreted as \"rotation by 2π\" (every axis yields the same element).\n\n===Low dimensions===\n\nIn 1 dimension, the pin groups are congruent to the first dihedral and dicyclic groups:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mbox{Pin}_+(1) &\\cong C_2 \\times C_2 = \\mbox{Dih}_1\\\\\n\\mbox{Pin}_-(1) &\\cong C_4 = \\mbox{Dic}_1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn 2 dimensions, the distinction between Pin<sub>+</sub> and Pin<sub>−</sub> mirrors the distinction between the [[dihedral group]] of a 2''n''-gon and the [[dicyclic group]] of the cyclic group ''C''<sub>2''n''</sub>.\n\nIn Pin<sub>+</sub>, the preimage of the dihedral group of an ''n''-gon, considered as a subgroup Dih<sub>''n''</sub> < O(2), is the dihedral group of a 2''n''-gon, Dih<sub>2''n''</sub> < Pin<sub>+</sub>(2), while in Pin<sub>−</sub>, the preimage of the dihedral group is the [[dicyclic group]] <math>\\mbox{Dic}_n < \\mbox{Pin}_-(2)</math>.\n\nThe resulting [[commutative square]] of subgroups for Spin(2), Pin<sub>+</sub>(2), SO(2), O(2) – namely ''C''<sub>2''n''</sub>, Dih<sub>2''n''</sub>, ''C<sub>n</sub>'', Dih<sub>''n''</sub> – is also obtained using the [[projective orthogonal group]] (going down from O by a 2-fold quotient, instead of up by a 2-fold cover) in the square SO(2), O(2), PSO(2), PO(2), though in this case it is also realized geometrically, as \"the projectivization of a 2''n''-gon in the circle is an ''n''-gon in the projective line\".\n\nIn 3 dimensions the situation is as follows.  The Clifford algebra generated by 3 anticommuting square roots of +1 is the algebra of 2×2 complex matrices, and Pin<sub>+</sub>(3) is isomorphic to SO(3) × ''C''<sub>4</sub>.

For example, if everything were postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stop-watch you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything were shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the [[proper length]] of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group.\n\nIn Minkowski space (i.e. ignoring the effects of [[gravity]]), there are ten degrees of freedom of the [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]], which may be thought of as translation through time or space (four degrees, one per dimension); reflection through a plane (three degrees, the freedom in orientation of this plane); or a \"[[Lorentz transformation|boost]]\" in any of the three spatial directions (three degrees). Composition of transformations is the operator of the Poincaré group, with proper rotations being produced as the composition of an even number of reflections.\n\nIn [[classical physics]], the [[Galilean group]] is a comparable ten-parameter group that acts on [[absolute time and space]]. Instead of boosts, it features [[shear mapping]]s to relate co-moving frames of reference.\n\n== Poincaré symmetry ==\n'''Poincaré symmetry''' is the full symmetry of [[special relativity]]. It includes:\n* ''[[Translation (physics)|translation]]s'' (displacements) in time and space ('''''P'''''), forming the [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie group]] of translations on space-time;\n* ''[[rotation]]s'' in space, forming the non-Abelian Lie group of [[three-dimensional rotation]]s ('''''J''''');\n* ''[[Lorentz transformation|boosts]]'', transformations connecting two uniformly moving bodies ('''''K''''').\n\nThe last two symmetries, '''''J''''' and '''''K''''', together make the [[Lorentz group]] (see also [[Lorentz invariance]]); the [[semi-direct product]] of the translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects which are invariant under this group are then said to possess '''Poincaré invariance''' or '''relativistic invariance'''.\n\n== Poincaré group ==\nThe Poincaré group is the group of Minkowski spacetime [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]]. It is a ten-dimensional [[Compact space|noncompact]] [[Lie group]]. The [[abelian group]] of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s is a [[normal subgroup]], while the [[Lorentz group]] is also a subgroup, the [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of the origin. The Poincaré group itself is the minimal subgroup of the [[affine group]] which includes all translations and [[Lorentz transformation]]s. More precisely, it is a [[semidirect product]] of the translations and the Lorentz group, \n:<math>\\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \\rtimes \\mathrm{O}(1,3) \\,,</math>\nwith group multiplication\n:<math>(\\alpha, f) \\cdot (\\beta, g) = (\\alpha + f \\cdot \\beta, \\; f \\cdot g)</math>.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mVovDwAAQBAJ|title=BMS Particles in Three Dimensions|last=Oblak|first=Blagoje|date=2017-08-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319618784|location=|pages=80|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnother way of putting this is that the Poincaré group is a [[group extension]] of the [[Lorentz group]] by a vector [[Group representation|representation]] of it; it is sometimes dubbed, informally, as the '''inhomogeneous Lorentz group'''. In turn, it can also be obtained as a [[group contraction]] of the de Sitter group SO(4,1) ~ Sp(2,2), as the [[de Sitter space|de Sitter radius]] goes to infinity.\n\nIts positive energy unitary irreducible [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] are indexed by [[mass]] (nonnegative number) and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ([[integer]] or half integer) and are associated with particles in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]).\n\nIn accordance with the [[Erlangen program]], the geometry of Minkowski space is defined by the Poincaré group: Minkowski space is considered as a [[homogeneous space]] for the group.\n\nIn [[quantum field theory]], the universal cover of the Poincaré group\n:<math>\\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \\rtimes \\mathrm{SL}(2,C) </math>\nand the double cover\n:<math>\\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \\rtimes \\mathrm{Spin}(1,3) </math>\nare more important, because representations of <math> \\mathrm{SO}(1,3)</math> are not able to describe fields with spin 1/2, i.e. [[fermions]].  Here <math> \\mathrm{SL}(2,C)</math> is the group of complex  <math>(2 \\times 2) </math> matrices with unit determinant.\n\n==Poincaré algebra==\n{{Lie groups |Other}}\nThe '''Poincaré algebra''' is the [[Lie algebra]] of the Poincaré group. It is a [[Lie algebra extension#By semidirect sum|Lie algebra extension]] of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. More specifically, the proper (det''Λ''=1), [[Lorentz group#Connected components|orthochronous]] ({{math|''Λ''<sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>≥1}}) part of the Lorentz subgroup (its [[identity component]]), SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 3),  is connected to the identity and is thus provided by the [[Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)|exponentiation]]  {{math|exp(''ia<sub>μ</sub>P<sup>μ</sup>'') exp(''iω<sub>μν</sub>M<sup>μν</sup>''/2)}} of this [[Lie algebra]].

In this notation, the entire Poincaré algebra is expressible in noncovariant (but more practical) language as\n: <math>[J_m,P_n] = i \\epsilon_{mnk} P_k ~,</math>\n: <math>[J_i,P_0] =  0 ~,</math>\n: <math>[K_i,P_k] = i \\eta_{ik} P_0 ~,</math>\n: <math>[K_i,P_0] = -i P_i ~,</math>\n: <math>[J_m,J_n] = i \\epsilon_{mnk} J_k ~,</math>\n: <math>[J_m,K_n] = i \\epsilon_{mnk} K_k ~,</math>\n: <math>[K_m,K_n] = -i \\epsilon_{mnk} J_k  ~,</math>\nwhere the bottom line commutator of two boosts is often referred to as a \"Wigner rotation\".  Note the important simplification {{math|[''J<sub>m</sub>+i K<sub>m</sub> ,  J<sub>n</sub>−i K<sub>n</sub>''] {{=}} 0}},  which permits reduction of the Lorentz subalgebra to '''su(2)'''⊕'''su(2)''' and efficient treatment of its associated [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representations]].\n\nThe [[Casimir invariant]]s of this algebra are {{math|''P''<sub>''μ''</sub>''P''<sup>''μ''</sup>}} and {{math|''W''<sub>''μ''</sub> ''W''<sup>''μ''</sup>}} where {{math|''W''<sub>''μ''</sub>}} is the [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]; they serve as labels for the representations of the group.\n \nThe Poincaré group is the full symmetry group of any [[relativistic field theory]]. As a result, all [[elementary particle]]s fall in [[Wigner's classification|representations of this group]]. These are usually specified by the ''four-momentum'' squared of each particle (i.e. its mass squared) and the intrinsic [[quantum number]]s {{math|''J<sup>PC</sup>''}}, where {{mvar|J}} is the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] quantum number, {{mvar|P}} is the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and {{mvar|C}} is the [[Charge conjugation|charge-conjugation]] quantum number. In practice, charge conjugation and parity are violated by many [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]]; where this occurs, {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|C}} are forfeited. Since [[CPT symmetry]] is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in quantum field theory, a [[T-parity|time-reversal quantum number]] may be constructed from those given.\n\nAs a [[topological space]], the group has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time-reversed and spatially inverted.\n\n== Other dimensions ==\nThe definitions above can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions in a straightforward manner. The d-dimensional Poincaré group is analogously defined by the semi-direct product\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{IO}(1,d-1) := \\mathbf{R}^{1,d-1} \\rtimes \\mathrm{O}(1,d-1) </math>\n\nwith the analogous multiplication\n\n:<math>(\\alpha, f) \\cdot (\\beta, g) = (\\alpha + f \\cdot \\beta, \\; f \\cdot g)</math>.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Lie algebra retains its form, with indices {{mvar|µ}} and {{mvar|ν}} now taking values between {{math|0}} and {{math|d-1}}. The alternative representation in terms of {{math|''J<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|''K<sub>i</sub>''}} has no analogue in higher dimensions.\n\n==Super-Poincaré algebra==\nA related observation is that the [[representations of the Lorentz group]] include a pair of inequivalent two-dimensional complex [[spinor]] representations <math>2</math> and <math>\\overline{2}</math> whose [[tensor product]] <math>2\\otimes\\overline{2}=3\\oplus1</math> is the [[adjoint representation]]. One may identify this last bit with four-dimensional Minkowski space itself (as opposed to identifying it with a spin-1 particle, as would normally be done for a pair of [[fermion]]s, e.g. a [[pion]] being composed of a [[quark]]-anti-quark pair). This strongly suggests that it might be possible to extend the Poincaré algebra to also include spinors. This leads directly to the notion of the [[super-Poincaré algebra]]. The mathematical appeal of this idea is that one is working with the [[fundamental representation]]s, instead of the adjoint representations.  The physical appeal of this idea is that the fundamental representations correspond to [[fermion]]s, which are seen in nature. So far, however, the implied [[supersymmetry]] here, of a symmetry between spatial and fermionic directions, cannot be seen experimentally in nature.  The experimental issue can roughly be stated as the question: if we live in the adjoint representation (Minkowski spacetime), then where is the fundamental representation hiding?\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Euclidean group]]\n* [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group]]\n* [[Wigner's classification]]\n* [[Symmetry in quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n* [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]\n* [[Particle physics and representation theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{wikibooks|Associative Composition Algebra|Homographies|Poincaré group}}\n* {{cite book |title=Group Theory in Physics |author=Wu-Ki Tung |year=1985 |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |isbn=9971-966-57-3}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Quantum Theory of Fields |volume=1 |last=Weinberg |first=Steven |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-55001-7}}\n* {{cite book |title=Quantum Field Theory |author=L.H.

Then ''UΣ = ΣU'', and it is possible to diagonalise ''U'' with a unitary similarity matrix ''S'' that commutes with ''Σ'', giving ''SUS{{sup|*}}'' = ''Φ<sup>−1</sup>'', where ''Φ'' is a diagonal unitary matrix of phases ''e<sup>iφ</sup>''. Putting ''Q = VS{{sup|*}}'', one can then re-write the polar decomposition as\n\n:<math>A = \\left(Q \\Phi Q^*\\right)\\left(Q \\Sigma Q^*\\right),\\,</math>\n\nso ''A'' then thus also has a [[spectral decomposition]]\n\n:<math>A = Q \\Lambda Q^*</math>\n\nwith complex eigenvalues such that <math>\\Lambda\\Lambda^* = \\Sigma^2</math> and a unitary matrix of complex eigenvectors ''Q''.\n\nThe '''polar decomposition''' of a square invertible real matrix ''A'' is of the form\n\n:<math>A = |A|R</math>\n\nwhere  <math>|A| = \\left(AA^\\textsf{T}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}</math> is a [[positive-semidefinite matrix|positive-definite]] [[Hermitian matrix|matrix]] and <math>R = |A|^{-1}A</math> is an orthogonal matrix.\n\n=== Construction and proofs of existence ===\nThe core idea behind the construction of the polar decomposition is similar to that used to compute the [[singular-value decomposition]].\n\nFor any matrix <math>A</math>, the matrix <math>A^* A</math> is hermitian and positive semi-definite, and therefore unitarily equivalent to a positive semi-definite diagonal matrix. Let then <math>V</math> be the unitary matrix such that <math>A^* A = VDV^*</math>, with <math>D</math> diagonal and positive semi-definite.\n\n==== Case of <math>A</math> normal ====\nIf <math>A</math> is normal, then it is unitarily equivalent to a diagonal matrix: <math>A = V\\Lambda V^*</math> for some unitary <math>V</math> and some diagonal matrix <math>\\Lambda</math>.\n\nThe polar decomposition is in this case obtained by writing \n\n:<math>V^* AV = \\Phi_\\Lambda |\\Lambda|,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|\\Lambda|</math> is the diagonal matrix with the absolute values of the elements of <math>\\Lambda</math>, and <math>\\Phi_\\Lambda</math> is a diagonal matrix with containing the ''phases'' of the elements of <math>\\Lambda</math>. In other words, \n\n:<math>\\left(\\Phi_\\Lambda |\\Lambda|\\right)_{jk} = \\delta_{jk} e^{i\\phi_k}\\left|\\lambda_k\\right| = \\delta_{jk} \\lambda_k.</math>\n\nWhen <math>\\lambda_k = 0</math>, the corresponding phase can be chosen arbitrarily.\n\nGoing back into the original basis, we obtain the polar decomposition of <math>A</math>:\n\n:<math>A = V\\Phi_\\Lambda |\\Lambda|V^* = \\underbrace{\\left(V\\Phi_\\Lambda V^*\\right)}_U \\underbrace{\\left(V |\\Lambda| V^*\\right)}_P.</math>\n\n==== Case of <math>A</math> invertible ====\nUsing for example the [[singular-value decomposition]], it can be readily shown that a matrix <math>A</math> is invertible if and only if <math>A^* A</math> (equivalently, <math>AA^*</math>) is. Moreover, this is true if and only if the eigenvalues of <math>A^* A</math> are all not zero<ref>Note how this implies, by the positivity of <math>A^* A</math>, that the eigenvalues are all real and strictly positive.</ref>.\n\nIn this case, the polar decomposition is directly obtained by writing\n\n:<math>A = A\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(A^* A\\right)^\\frac{1}{2},</math>\n\nand observing that <math>A\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> is unitary. To see this, we can exploit the spectral decomposition of <math>A^* A</math> to write <math>A\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = AVD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}V^*</math>.\n\nIn this expression, <math>V^*</math> is unitary because <math>V</math> is. To show that also <math>AVD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> is unitary, we can use the [[singular-value decomposition|SVD]] to write <math>A = WD^\\frac{1}{2}V^*</math>, so that \n\n:<math>AV D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = WD^\\frac{1}{2}V^* VD^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = W,</math>\n\nwhere again <math>W</math> is unitary by construction.\n\nYet another way to directly show the unitarity of <math>A\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> is to note that, writing the [[singular-value decomposition|SVD]] of <math>A</math> in terms of rank-1 matrices as <math>A = \\sum_k s_k v_k w_k^*</math>, where <math>s_k</math>are the singular values of <math>A</math>, we have <math display=\"block\">A\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(\\sum_j \\lambda_j v_j w_j^*\\right)\\left(\\sum_k |\\lambda_k|^{-1} w_k w_k^*\\right)\n= \\sum_k \\frac{\\lambda_k}{|\\lambda_k|} v_k w_k^*,</math> which directly implies the unitarity of <math>A\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> because a matrix is unitary if and only if its singular values have unitary absolute value.\n\nNote how, from the above construction, it follows that ''the unitary matrix in the polar decomposition of an invertible matrix is uniquely defined''.\n\n==== General case ====\nThe above argument crucially relies on the existence of <math>\\left(A^* A\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math>, and therefore on '''<math>A^* A</math>''' being invertible. Indeed, in the general case, <math>AVD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> is not generally well-defined, due to the possibility of <math>D</math> having vanishing eigenvalues.\n\nLet us denote with <math>V_1</math> the (in general not square) matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of <math>A^* A</math> corresponding to non-vanishing eigenvalues, with <math>D_1</math> the diagonal matrix containing the associated non-zero eigenvalues, and with <math>V_2</math> the matrix with the remaining eigenvectors of <math>A^* A</math>. We can then write the spectral decomposition of <math>A^* A</math> as:\n\n:<math>A^* A =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}V_1 & V_2\\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    D_1 & 0 \\\\\n      0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}V_1^* \\\\ V_2^*\\end{bmatrix} =\n  V_1 D_1 V_1^*.\n</math>\n\nNote that, similarly to the invertible case, <math>AV_1 D_1^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> is well-defined and its columns are orthonormal, although it is not in general square and therefore unitary.\n\nWe now define\n\n:<math>U' = \\left[AV_1 D_1^{-\\frac{1}{2}}, \\Phi\\right],</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi</math> is a matrix whose columns are chosen so that <math>U'</math> is unitary. This is done by finding a set of orthonormal vectors which, together with the columns of <math>AV_1 D_1^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math>, form a complete base for the space, and using these vectors as the columns of <math>\\Phi</math>. Note how the definition of <math>U'</math> is not unique, ''unless'' <math>A^* A</math> (and therefore <math>A</math>) is invertible, in which case <math>AV_1 D_1^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math> is already unitary and uniquely defined.\n\nThe argument now proceeds similarly to the invertible case, with the only difference of using <math>U'</math> in place of <math>AVD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math>. Indeed, we have:\n\n:<math>\n  U\\left(A^*A\\right)^\\frac{1}{2} \\equiv\n  U' \\begin{bmatrix}V_1^* \\\\ V_2^*\\end{bmatrix}\\left(A^* A\\right)^\\frac{1}{2} =\n  \\left(AV_1 D_1^{-\\frac{1}{2}} V_1^* + \\Phi V_2^*\\right) V_1 D_1^\\frac{1}{2} V_1 =\n  A,\n</math>\n\nwhere we used the orthogonality of the columns of <math>V_1</math> and <math>V_2</math>, which is equivalent to <math>V_2^* V_1 = 0</math>, and <math>U</math> is the product of two unitaries, and is therefore also unitary.\n\n==== General case, alternative proof ====\nMaking use of the [[singular-value decomposition|SVD]] of <math>A</math>, a more direct proof can be found.\n\nThe SVD of <math>A</math> reads <math>A = W D^\\frac{1}{2} V^*</math>, with <math>W, V</math> unitary matrices, and <math>D</math> a diagonal, positive semi-definite matrix. By simply inserting an additional pair of <math>W</math>s or <math>V</math>s, we obtain the two forms of the polar decomposition of <math>A</math>: \n\n:<math>\n  A = WD^\\frac{1}{2}V^* =\n  \\underbrace{\\left(W D^\\frac{1}{2} W^*\\right)}_P \\underbrace{\\left(W V^*\\right)}_U =\n  \\underbrace{\\left(W V^*\\right)}_U \\underbrace{\\left(VD^\\frac{1}{2} V^*\\right)}_{P'}.\n</math>\n\n==Bounded operators on Hilbert space==\nThe '''polar decomposition''' of any [[bounded linear operator]] ''A'' between complex [[Hilbert space]]s is a canonical factorization as the product of a [[partial isometry]] and a non-negative operator.\n\nThe polar decomposition for matrices generalizes as follows: if ''A'' is a bounded linear operator then there is a unique factorization of ''A'' as a product ''A'' = ''UP'' where ''U'' is a partial isometry, ''P'' is a non-negative self-adjoint operator and the initial space of ''U'' is the closure of the range of ''P''.\n\nThe operator ''U'' must be weakened to a partial isometry, rather than unitary, because of the following issues. If ''A'' is the [[shift operator|one-sided shift]] on ''l''<sup>2</sup>('''N'''), then |''A''| = {''A{{sup|*}}A''}<sup>½</sup> = ''I''. So if ''A'' = ''U'' |''A''|, ''U'' must be ''A'', which is not unitary.\n\nThe existence of a polar decomposition is a consequence of [[Douglas' lemma]]:\n\n:'''Lemma''' If ''A'', ''B'' are bounded operators on a Hilbert space ''H'', and ''A{{sup|*}}A'' &le; ''B{{sup|*}}B'', then there exists a contraction ''C'' such that ''A = CB''. Furthermore, ''C'' is unique if ''Ker''(''B{{sup|*}}'') &sub; ''Ker''(''C'').\n\nThe operator ''C'' can be defined by ''C(Bh)'' := ''Ah'' for all ''h'' in ''H'', extended by continuity to the closure of ''Ran''(''B''), and by zero on the orthogonal complement to all of ''H''. The lemma then follows since ''A{{sup|*}}A'' ≤ ''B{{sup|*}}B'' implies ''Ker''(''B'') ⊂ ''Ker''(''A'').\n\nIn particular. If ''A{{sup|*}}A'' = ''B{{sup|*}}B'', then ''C'' is a partial isometry, which is unique if ''Ker''(''B{{sup|*}}'') ⊂ ''Ker''(''C'').\nIn general, for any bounded operator ''A'',\n\n:<math>A^*A = \\left(A^*A\\right)^\\frac{1}{2} \\left(A^*A\\right)^\\frac{1}{2},</math>\n\nwhere (''A{{sup|*}}A'')<sup>½</sup> is the unique positive square root of ''A{{sup|*}}A'' given by the usual [[functional calculus]]. So by the lemma, we have\n\n:<math>A = U\\left(A^*A\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}</math>\n\nfor some partial isometry ''U'', which is unique if ''Ker''(''A{{sup|*}}'') ⊂ ''Ker''(''U''). Take ''P'' to be (''A{{sup|*}}A'')<sup>½</sup> and one obtains the polar decomposition ''A'' = ''UP''. Notice that an analogous argument can be used to show ''A = P'U{{'}}'', where ''P' '' is positive and ''U{{'}}'' a partial isometry.\n\nWhen ''H'' is finite-dimensional, ''U'' can be extended to a unitary operator; this is not true in general (see example above). Alternatively, the polar decomposition can be shown using the operator version of [[singular value decomposition#Bounded operators on Hilbert spaces|singular value decomposition]].\n\nBy property of the [[continuous functional calculus]], ''|A|'' is in the [[C*-algebra]] generated by ''A''. A similar but weaker statement holds for the partial isometry: ''U'' is in the [[von Neumann algebra]] generated by ''A''. If ''A'' is invertible, the polar part ''U'' will be in the [[C*-algebra]] as well.\n\n==Unbounded operators==\nIf ''A'' is a closed, densely defined [[unbounded operator]] between complex Hilbert spaces then it still has a (unique) '''polar decomposition'''\n\n:<math>A = U |A|\\,</math>\n\nwhere |''A''| is a (possibly unbounded) non-negative self adjoint operator with the same domain as ''A'', and ''U'' is a partial isometry vanishing on the orthogonal complement of the range ''Ran''(|''A''|).\n\nThe proof uses the same lemma as above, which goes through for unbounded operators in general. If ''Dom''(''A{{sup|*}}A'') = ''Dom''(''B{{sup|*}}B'') and ''A{{sup|*}}Ah'' = ''B{{sup|*}}Bh'' for all ''h'' ∈ ''Dom''(''A{{sup|*}}A''), then there exists a partial isometry ''U'' such that ''A'' = ''UB''. ''U'' is unique if ''Ran''(''B'')<sup>⊥</sup> ⊂ ''Ker''(''U''). The operator ''A'' being closed and densely defined ensures that the operator ''A{{sup|*}}A'' is self-adjoint (with dense domain) and therefore allows one to define (''A{{sup|*}}A'')<sup>½</sup>. Applying the lemma gives polar decomposition.\n\nIf an unbounded operator ''A'' is [[affiliated operator|affiliated]] to a von Neumann algebra '''M''', and ''A'' = ''UP'' is its polar decomposition, then ''U'' is in '''M''' and so is the spectral projection of ''P'', 1<sub>''B''</sub>(''P''), for any Borel set ''B'' in [0, ∞).\n\n==Quaternion polar decomposition==\nThe polar decomposition of [[quaternion]]s '''H''' depends on the sphere <math>\\lbrace x i + y j + z k \\in H : x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 1 \\rbrace</math> of [[quaternion#Square roots of −1|square roots of minus one]]. Given any ''r'' on this sphere, and an angle −π < ''a'' ≤ π, the [[versor]] <math>e^{ar} = \\cos (a) + r\\ \\sin (a) </math> is on the [[3-sphere]] of '''H'''. For ''a'' = 0 and ''a'' = π, the versor is 1 or −1 regardless of which ''r'' is selected. The [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] ''t'' of a quaternion ''q'' is the [[Euclidean distance]] from the origin to ''q''. When a quaternion is not just a real number, then there is a ''unique'' polar decomposition <math>q = t e^{ar}.</math>\n\n==Alternative planar decompositions==\nIn the [[Cartesian plane]], alternative planar [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] decompositions arise as follows:\n{{bulleted list\n| If {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ 0}}, {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''x''(1 + ε(''y''/''x''))}} is a polar decomposition of a [[dual number]] {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''x'' + ''y''ε}}, where {{nowrap|ε<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 0}}; i.e., ε is [[nilpotent]]. In this polar decomposition, the unit circle has been replaced by the line {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 1}}, the polar angle by the [[slope]] ''y/x'', and the radius ''x'' is negative in the left half-plane.\n| If {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> ≠ ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}, then the [[unit hyperbola]] {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}} and its conjugate {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} −1}} can be used to form a polar decomposition based on the branch of the unit hyperbola through {{nowrap|(1, 0)}}. This branch is parametrized by the [[hyperbolic angle]] ''a'' and is written\n: <math>\\cosh(a) + j\\ \\sinh(a) = \\exp(aj) = e^{aj}</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|''j''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} +1}} and the arithmetic<ref>Sobczyk, G.(1995) \"Hyperbolic Number Plane\", ''[[College Mathematics Journal]] 26:268–80</ref> of [[split-complex number]]s is used. The branch through {{nowrap|(−1, 0)}} is traced by −''e''<sup>''aj''</sup>. Since the operation of multiplying by j reflects a point across the line {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}, the second hyperbola has branches traced by ''je''<sup>''aj''</sup> or −''je''<sup>''aj''</sup>. Therefore a point in one of the quadrants has a polar decomposition in one of the forms:\n: <math>r e^{aj}, - re^{aj}, rje^{aj}, -rje^{aj}, \\quad r > 0</math>\n\nThe set {{nowrap|{ 1, −1, j, −j }|}} has products that make it isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]]. Evidently polar decomposition in this case involves an element from that group.\n}}\n\n==Numerical determination of the matrix polar decomposition==\nTo compute an approximation of the polar decomposition ''A'' = ''UP'', usually the unitary factor ''U'' is approximated.<ref name=\"higham1986\" /><ref name=\"byers2008\" /> The iteration is based on [[Heron's method]] for the square root of ''1'' and computes, starting from <math>U_0 = A</math>, the sequence\n:<math>U_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(U_k + \\left(U_k^*\\right )^{-1}\\right),\\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots</math>\n\nThe combination of inversion and Hermite conjugation is chosen so that in the singular value decomposition, the unitary factors remain the same and the iteration reduces to Heron's method on the singular values.\n\nThis basic iteration may be refined to speed up the process:\n{{bulleted list\n| Every step or in regular intervals, the range of the singular values of <math>U_k</math> is estimated and then the matrix is rescaled to <math>\\gamma_k U_k</math> to center the singular values around ''1''. The scaling factor <math>\\gamma_k</math> is computed using matrix norms of the matrix and its inverse. Examples of such scale estimates are:\n: <math>\\gamma_k = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{\\left\\|U_k^{-1}\\right\\|_1 \\left\\|U_k^{-1}\\right\\|_\\infty}{\\left\\|U_k\\right\\|_1 \\left\\|U_k\\right\\|_\\infty} }</math>\n\nusing the row-sum and column-sum [[induced norm|matrix norms]] or\n: <math>\\gamma_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left\\|U_k^{-1}\\right\\|_F}{\\left\\|U_k\\right\\|_F}}</math>\n\nusing the [[Frobenius norm]]. Including the scale factor, the iteration is now\n: <math>U_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\gamma_k U_k + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_k} \\left(U_k^*\\right)^{-1}\\right), \\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots</math>\n| The [[QR decomposition]] can be used in a preparation step to reduce a singular matrix ''A'' to a smaller regular matrix, and inside every step to speed up the computation of the inverse.\n| Heron' method for computing roots of <math>x^2 - 1 = 0</math> can be replaced by higher order methods, for instance based on [[Halley's method]] of third order, resulting in\n: <math>U_{k+1} = U_k\\left(I + 3U_k^* U_k\\right)^{-1}\\left(3I + U_k^* U_k\\right),\\qquad k = 0, 1, 2,  \\ldots</math>\n\nThis iteration can again be combined with rescaling. This particular formula has the benefit that it is also applicable to singular or rectangular matrices ''A''.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cartan decomposition]]\n*[[Matrix decomposition#Algebraic polar decomposition|Algebraic polar decomposition]]\n*[[Complex measure#Variation of a complex measure and polar decomposition|Polar decomposition of a complex measure]]\n\n==References==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"higham1986\">\n{{cite journal\n |last        = Higham\n |first       = Nicholas J.\n |title       = Computing the polar decomposition with applications\n |journal     = SIAM J.

Equivalently, a principal homogeneous space for a group ''G'' is a non-empty set ''X'' on which ''G'' [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] [[Group action (mathematics)#Types_of_actions|freely]] and [[Group action (mathematics)#Types_of_actions|transitively]] (meaning that, for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'', there exists a unique ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x''·''g'' = ''y''}}, where · denotes the (right) action of ''G'' on ''X'').\nAn analogous definition holds in other [[category (mathematics)|categories]], where, for example,\n*''G'' is a [[topological group]], ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and the action is [[continuous (topology)|continuous]],\n*''G'' is a [[Lie group]], ''X'' is a [[smooth manifold]] and the action is [[smooth function|smooth]],\n*''G'' is an [[algebraic group]], ''X'' is an [[algebraic variety]] and the action is [[regular function|regular]].\n\n==Definition==\nIf ''G'' is [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] then one must distinguish between left and right torsors according to whether the action is on the left or right. In this article, we will use right actions. \n\nTo state the definition more explicitly, ''X'' is a ''G''-torsor or ''G''-principal homogeneous space if ''X'' is nonempty and is equipped with a map (in the appropriate category) {{nowrap|''X'' × ''G'' → ''X''}} such that\n:''x''·1 = ''x''\n:''x''·(''gh'') = (''x''·''g'')·''h''\nfor all {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} and all {{nowrap|''g'',''h'' ∈ ''G''}} and such that the map {{nowrap|''X'' × ''G'' → ''X'' × ''X''}} given by\n:<math>(x,g) \\mapsto (x,x\\cdot g)</math>\nis an isomorphism (of sets, or topological spaces or ..., as appropriate, i.e. in the category in question). \n\nNote that this means that ''X'' and ''G'' are isomorphic (in the category in question; not as groups: see the following).  However &mdash;and this is the essential point&mdash;, there is no preferred 'identity' point in ''X''. That is, ''X'' looks exactly like ''G'' except that which point is the identity has been forgotten. (This concept is often used in mathematics as a way of passing to a more intrinsic point of view, under the heading 'throw away the origin'.)\n\nSince ''X'' is not a group, we cannot multiply elements; we can, however, take their \"quotient\". That is, there is a map {{nowrap|''X'' × ''X'' → ''G''}} that sends {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}} to the unique element {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''x'' \\ ''y'' ∈ ''G''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''·''g''}}.\n\nThe composition of the latter operation with the right group action, however, yields a [[ternary operation]] {{nowrap|''X'' × (''X'' × ''X'') → ''X'' × ''G'' → ''X''}}, which serves as an affine generalization of group multiplication and which is sufficient to both characterize a principal homogeneous space algebraically and intrinsically characterize the group it is associated with. If we denote <math>x/y \\cdot z \\,:=\\, x \\cdot (y\\backslash z)</math> the result of this ternary operation, then the following [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]\n:<math>x/y \\cdot y = x = y/y \\cdot x</math>\n:<math>v/w \\cdot (x/y \\cdot z) = (v/w \\cdot x)/y \\cdot z</math>\nwill suffice to define a principal homogeneous space, while the additional property\n:<math>x/y \\cdot z = z/y \\cdot x</math>\nidentifies those spaces that are associated with abelian groups. The group may be defined as formal quotients <math>x \\backslash y</math> subject to the equivalence relation\n:<math>x \\backslash y = u \\backslash v \\quad \\text{iff} \\quad v = u/x \\cdot y</math>,\nwith the group product, identity and inverse defined, respectively, by\n:<math>(x \\backslash y) \\cdot (u \\backslash v) = x \\backslash (y/u \\cdot v) = (u/y \\cdot x)\\backslash v</math>,\n:<math>e = x \\backslash x</math>,\n:<math>(x \\backslash y)^{-1} = y \\backslash x,</math>\nand the group action by\n:<math>x\\cdot (y \\backslash z) = x/y \\cdot z.</math>\n\n==Examples==\n\nEvery group ''G'' can itself be thought of as a left or right ''G''-torsor under the natural action of left or right multiplication.\n\nAnother example is the [[affine space]] concept: the idea of the affine space ''A'' underlying a [[vector space]] ''V'' can be said succinctly by saying that ''A'' is a principal homogeneous space for ''V'' acting as the additive group of translations.\n\nThe [[Flag (geometry)|flags]] of any [[regular polytope]] form a torsor for its symmetry group.\n\nGiven a [[vector space]] ''V'' we can take ''G'' to be the [[general linear group]] GL(''V''), and ''X'' to be the set of all (ordered) [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] of ''V''. Then ''G'' acts on ''X'' in the way that it acts on vectors of ''V''; and it acts [[Group action (mathematics)|transitively]] since any basis can be transformed via ''G'' to any other. What is more, a linear transformation fixing each vector of a basis will fix all ''v'' in ''V'', hence being the neutral element of the general linear group GL(''V'') : so that ''X'' is indeed a ''principal'' homogeneous space. One way to follow basis-dependence in a [[linear algebra]] argument is to track variables ''x'' in ''X''. Similarly, the space of [[orthonormal bases]] (the [[Stiefel manifold]] <math>V_n(\\mathbf{R}^n)</math> of [[k-frame|''n''-frames]]) is a principal homogeneous space for the [[orthogonal group]].\n\nIn [[category theory]], if two objects ''X'' and ''Y'' are isomorphic, then the isomorphisms between them, Iso(''X'',''Y''), form a torsor for the [[automorphism group]] of ''X'', Aut(''X''), and likewise for Aut(''Y''); a choice of isomorphism between the objects gives rise to an isomorphism between these groups and identifies the torsor with these two groups, giving the torsor a group structure (as it has now a [[Base point|base point]]).\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe principal homogeneous space concept is a special case of that of [[principal bundle]]: it means a principal bundle with base a single point. In other words the local theory of principal bundles is that of a family of principal homogeneous spaces depending on some parameters in the base. The 'origin' can be supplied by a [[Fiber bundle#Sections|section]] of the bundle&mdash;such sections are usually assumed to exist ''locally on the base''&mdash;the bundle being ''locally trivial'', so that the local structure is that of a [[cartesian product]]. But sections will often not exist globally. For example a [[differential manifold]] ''M'' has a principal bundle of [[frame bundle|frames]] associated to its [[tangent bundle]]. A global section will exist (by definition) only when ''M'' is [[parallelizable]], which implies strong topological restrictions.\n\nIn [[number theory]] there is a (superficially different) reason to consider principal homogeneous spaces, for [[elliptic curve]]s ''E'' defined over a field ''K'' (and more general [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]]). Once this was understood various other examples were collected under the heading, for other [[algebraic group]]s: [[quadratic form]]s for [[orthogonal group]]s, and [[Severi–Brauer variety|Severi–Brauer varieties]] for [[projective linear group]]s being two.\n\nThe reason of the interest for [[Diophantine equation]]s, in the elliptic curve case, is that ''K'' may not be [[algebraically closed]]. There can exist curves ''C'' that have no point defined over ''K'', and which become isomorphic over a larger field to ''E'', which by definition has a point over ''K'' to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish ''C'' that have [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1, from elliptic curves ''E'' that have a ''K''-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in ''K''). The curves ''C'' turn out to be torsors over ''E'', and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that ''K'' is a [[number field]] (the theory of the [[Selmer group]]). In fact a typical plane cubic curve ''C'' over '''Q''' has no particular reason to have a [[rational point]]; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over ''K'' to put ''C'' into that form ''over'' ''K''.\n\nThis theory has been developed with great attention to [[local analysis]], leading to the definition of the [[Tate-Shafarevich group]]. In general the approach of taking the torsor theory, easy over an [[algebraically closed field]], and trying to get back 'down' to a smaller field is an aspect of [[descent (category theory)|descent]]. It leads at once to questions of [[Galois cohomology]], since the torsors represent classes in [[group cohomology]] ''H''<sup>1</sup>.\n\n==Other usage==\nThe concept of a principal homogeneous space can also be globalized as follows.  Let ''X'' be a \"space\" (a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]/[[manifold]]/[[topological space]] etc.), and let ''G'' be a group over ''X'', i.e., a [[group object]] in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of spaces over ''X''. In this case, a (right, say) ''G''-torsor ''E'' on ''X'' is a space ''E'' (of the same type) over ''X'' with a (right) ''G'' [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] such that the morphism \n\n:<math>E \\times_X G \\rightarrow E \\times_X E </math> \n\ngiven by \n\n:<math>(x,g) \\mapsto (x,xg)</math> \n\nis an [[isomorphism]] in the appropriate [[Category (mathematics)|category]], and such that ''E'' is locally trivial on ''X'', in that {{nowrap|''E'' → ''X''}} acquires a section locally on ''X''. Isomorphism classes of torsors in this sense correspond to classes in the [[cohomology]] group ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''X'',''G'').\n\nWhen we are in the smooth manifold [[Category (mathematics)|category]], then a ''G''-torsor (for ''G'' a [[Lie group]]) is then precisely a principal ''G''-[[principal bundle|bundle]] as defined above.\n\nExample: if ''G'' is a compact Lie group (say), then <math>EG</math> is a ''G''-torsor over the [[classifying space]] <math>BG</math>.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Homogeneous space]]\n*[[Heap (mathematics)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last1=Garibaldi | first1=Skip | authorlink1=Skip Garibaldi | last2=Merkurjev | first2=Alexander | authorlink2=Alexander Merkurjev | last3=Serre | first3=Jean-Pierre | authorlink3=Jean-Pierre Serre | title=Cohomological invariants in Galois cohomology | series=University Lecture Series | volume=28 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-8218-3287-5 | zbl=1159.12311 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Skorobogatov | first=A. | title=Torsors and rational points | series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics | volume=144 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2001 | isbn=0-521-80237-7 | zbl=0972.14015 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html Torsors made easy] by John Baez\n\n[[Category:Group theory]]\n[[Category:Topological groups]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Algebraic homogeneous spaces]]\n[[Category:Diophantine geometry]]\n[[Category:Vector bundles]]"

Explicitly, the projective linear group is the [[quotient group]]\n:PGL(''V'') = GL(''V'')/Z(''V'')\nwhere GL(''V'') is the [[general linear group]] of ''V'' and Z(''V'') is the subgroup of all nonzero [[scalar transformation]]s of ''V''; these are quotiented out because they act [[trivial action|trivially]] on the projective space and they form the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the action, and the notation \"Z\" reflects that the scalar transformations form the [[center of a group|center]] of the general linear group.\n\nThe '''projective special linear group''', PSL, is defined analogously, as the induced action of the [[special linear group]] on the associated projective space. Explicitly:\n:PSL(''V'') = SL(''V'')/SZ(''V'')\nwhere SL(''V'') is the special linear group over ''V'' and SZ(''V'') is the subgroup of scalar transformations with unit [[determinant]]. Here SZ is the center of SL, and is naturally identified with the group of ''n''th [[roots of unity]] in ''K'' (where ''n'' is the dimension of ''V'' and ''K'' is the base field).\n\nPGL and PSL are some of the fundamental groups of study, part of the so-called [[classical groups]], and an element of PGL is called  '''projective linear transformation''', '''projective transformation''' or '''[[homography]]'''.

This is reflected in the notation: PGL(''n'', ''F'') is the group associated to GL(''n'', ''F''), and is the projective linear group of (''n''−1)-dimensional projective space, not ''n''-dimensional projective space.\n\n===Collineations===\n{{main|Collineation}}\nA related group is the [[collineation group]], which is defined axiomatically. A collineation is an invertible (or more generally one-to-one) map which sends [[collinear points]] to collinear points. One can [[Projective space#Axioms for projective space|define a projective space axiomatically]] in terms of an [[incidence structure]] (a set of points ''P,'' lines ''L,'' and an [[incidence relation]] ''I'' specifying which points lie on which lines) satisfying certain axioms – an automorphism of a projective space thus defined then being an automorphism ''f'' of the set of points and an automorphism ''g'' of the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation,<ref group=\"note\">\"Preserving the incidence relation\" means that if point ''p'' is on line ''l'' then ''f''(''p'') is in ''g''(''l''); formally, if (''p'', ''l'') ∈ ''I'' then (''f''(''p''), ''g''(''l'')) ∈ ''I''.</ref> which is exactly a collineation of a space to itself. Projective linear transforms are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transforms map planes to planes, so projective linear transforms map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transforms – PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.\n\nSpecifically, for ''n'' = 2 (a projective line), all points are collinear, so the collineation group is exactly the [[symmetric group]] of the points of the projective line, and except for '''F'''<sub>2</sub> and '''F'''<sub>3</sub> (where PGL is the full symmetric group), PGL is a proper subgroup of the full symmetric group on these points.\n\nFor ''n'' ≥ 3, the collineation group is the [[projective semilinear group]], PΓL – this is PGL, twisted by [[field automorphism]]s; formally, PΓL ≅ PGL ⋊ Gal(''K''/''k''), where ''k'' is the [[prime field]] for ''K;'' this is the [[fundamental theorem of projective geometry]]. Thus for ''K'' a prime field ('''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> or '''Q'''), we have PGL = PΓL, but for ''K'' a field with non-trivial Galois automorphisms (such as <math>\\mathbf{F}_{p^n}</math> for ''n'' ≥ 2 or '''C'''), the projective linear group is a proper subgroup of the collineation group, which can be thought of as \"transforms preserving a projective ''semi''-linear structure\". Correspondingly, the quotient group PΓL/PGL = Gal(''K''/''k'') corresponds to \"choices of linear structure\", with the identity (base point) being the existing linear structure.\n\nOne may also define collineation groups for axiomatically defined projective spaces, where there is no natural notion of a projective ''linear'' transform. However, with the exception of the [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s, all projective spaces are the projectivization of a linear space over a [[division ring]] though, as noted above, there are multiple choices of linear structure, namely a [[torsor]] over Gal(''K''/''k'') (for ''n'' ≥ 3).\n\n==Elements==\nThe elements of the projective linear group can be understood as  \"tilting the plane\" along one of the axes, and then projecting to the original plane, and also have dimension ''n.''\n\n[[File:Riemann sphere1.svg|thumb|Rotation about the ''z'' axes rotates the projective plane, while the projectivization of rotation about lines parallel to the ''x'' or ''y'' axes yield projective rotations of the plane.]]\nA more familiar geometric way to understand the projective transforms is via '''projective rotations''' (the elements of PSO(''n''+1)), which corresponds to the [[stereographic projection]] of rotations of the unit hypersphere, and has dimension <math>\\textstyle{1+2+\\cdots+n=\\binom{n+1}{2}}.</math> Visually, this corresponds to standing at the origin (or placing a camera at the origin), and turning one's angle of view, then projecting onto a flat plane. Rotations in axes perpendicular to the hyperplane preserve the hyperplane and yield a rotation of the hyperplane (an element of SO(''n''), which has dimension <math>\\textstyle{1+2+\\cdots+(n-1) =\\binom{n}{2}}.</math>), while rotations in axes parallel to the hyperplane are proper projective maps, and accounts for the remaining ''n'' dimensions.\n\n==Properties==\n* PGL sends collinear points to collinear points (it preserves projective lines), but it is not the full [[collineation group]], which is instead either PΓL (for ''n'' > 2) or the full [[symmetric group]] for ''n'' = 2 (the projective line).\n* Every ([[biregular]]) algebraic automorphism of a projective space is projective linear. The [[birational automorphism]]s form a larger group, the [[Cremona group]].\n* PGL acts faithfully on projective space: non-identity elements act non-trivially.\n*:Concretely, the kernel of the action of GL on projective space is exactly the scalar maps, which are quotiented out in PGL.\n* PGL acts [[2-transitive group|2-transitively]] on projective space.\n*:This is because 2 distinct points in projective space correspond to 2 vectors that do not lie on a single linear space, and hence are [[linearly independent]], and GL acts transitively on ''k''-element sets of linearly independent vectors.\n* PGL(2, ''K'') acts sharply 3-transitively on the projective line.\n*:3 arbitrary points are conventionally mapped to [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]; in alternative notation, 0, 1, ∞. In fractional linear transformation notation, the function <math>\\frac{x-a}{x-c}\\cdot \\frac{b-c}{b-a}</math> maps ''a'' ↦ 0, ''b'' ↦ 1, ''c'' ↦ ∞, and is the unique such map that does so. This is the [[cross-ratio]] (''x'', ''b''; ''a'', ''c'') – see [[Cross-ratio#Transformational approach|cross-ratio: transformational approach]] for details.\n* For ''n'' ≥ 3, PGL(''n'', ''K'') does not act 3-transitively, because it must send 3 collinear points to 3 other collinear points, not an arbitrary set. For ''n'' = 2 the space is the projective line, so all points are collinear and this is no restriction.\n* PGL(2, ''K'') does not act 4-transitively on the projective line (except for PGL(2, 3), as '''P'''<sup>1</sup>(3) has 3+1=4 points, so 3-transitive implies 4-transitive); the invariant that is preserved is the [[cross ratio]], and this determines where every other point is sent: specifying where 3 points are mapped determines the map. Thus in particular it is not the full collineation group of the projective line (except for '''F'''<sub>2</sub> and '''F'''<sub>3</sub>).\n* PSL(2, ''q'') and PGL(2, ''q'') (for ''q'' > 2, and ''q'' odd for PSL) are two of the four families of [[Zassenhaus group]]s.\n* PGL(''n'', ''K'') is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n''<sup>2</sup>−1 and an open subgroup of the projective space '''P'''<sup>''n''<sup>2</sup>−1</sup>. As defined, the functor PSL(''n'',''K'') does not define an algebraic group, or even an fppf sheaf, and its sheafification in the [[fppf topology]] is in fact PGL(''n'',''K'').\n* PSL and PGL are [[centerless]] – this is because the diagonal matrices are not only the center, but also the [[hypercenter]] (the quotient of a group by its center is not necessarily centerless).<ref group=\"note\">For PSL (except PSL(2, 2) and PSL(2, 3)) this follows by [[Grün's lemma]] because SL is a [[perfect group]] (hence center equals hypercenter), but for PGL and the two exceptional PSLs this requires additional checking.</ref>\n\n===Fractional linear transformations===\n{{details|Möbius transformation#Projective matrix representations}}\nAs for [[Möbius transformation]]s, the group PGL(2, ''K'') can be interpreted as [[fractional linear transformation]]s with coefficients in ''K'', a matrix <math>\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}a & b\\\\c & d\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)</math> corresponding to the [[rational function]]\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{a x + b}{c x + d}</math>\nwhere multiplication of matrices agrees with composition of functions, and quotienting out by scalar matrices corresponding to multiplying the top and bottom of the fraction by a common factor. As with Möbius transformations, these functions can be interpreted as automorphisms of the [[projective line]] over ''K''.\n\n==Finite fields==\nThe projective special linear groups PSL(''n'', '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) for a [[finite field]] '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> are often written as PSL(''n'', ''q'') or ''L<sub>n</sub>''(''q''). They are [[finite simple group]]s whenever ''n'' is at least 2, with two exceptions:<ref>Proof: [http://math.harvard.edu/~elkies/M155.09/ Math 155r 2010], [http://math.harvard.edu/~elkies/M155.09/h4.pdf Handout #4], [[Noam Elkies]]</ref> ''L''<sub>2</sub>(2), which is isomorphic to ''S''<sub>3</sub>, the [[symmetric group]] on 3 letters, and is [[solvable group|solvable]]; and ''L''<sub>2</sub>(3), which is isomorphic to ''A''<sub>4</sub>, the [[alternating group]] on 4 letters, and is also solvable. These exceptional isomorphisms can be understood as arising from the [[#Action on projective line|action on the projective line]].\n\nThe special linear groups SL(''n'', ''q'') are thus [[quasisimple]]: perfect central extensions of a simple group (unless ''n'' = 2 and ''q'' = 2 or 3).\n\n===History===\nThe groups PSL(2, ''p'') were constructed by [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s, and were the second family of finite [[simple group]]s, after the [[alternating group]]s.<ref name=\"raw\">{{Citation | last1=Wilson | first1=Robert A. | authorlink = Robert Arnott Wilson | title=The finite simple groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] 251 | isbn=978-1-84800-987-5 | doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2 | zbl=1203.20012 | year=2009 |chapter = Chapter 1: Introduction |chapterurl=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs_files/intro.ps | postscript =, [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html 2007 preprint]; Chapter {{doi|10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2_1}}. | volume=251}}</ref> Galois constructed them as fractional linear transforms, and observed that they were simple except if ''p'' was 2 or 3; this is contained in his last letter to Chevalier.<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\">{{Citation| last = Galois | first = Évariste| year = 1846 | title = Lettre de Galois à M.

For ''n'' = 2, this is the projective line '''P'''<sup>1</sup>(''q'') which has (''q''<sup>2</sup>−1)/(''q''−1) = ''q''+1 points, so there is a map PGL(2, ''q'') → ''S''<sub>''q''+1</sub>.\n\nTo understand these maps, it is useful to recall these facts:\n* The order of PGL(2, ''q'') is\n::<math>(q^2-1)(q^2-q)/(q-1)=q^3-q=(q-1)q(q+1);</math>\n:the order of PSL(2, ''q'') either equals this (if the characteristic is 2), or is half this (if the characteristic is not 2).\n* The action of the projective linear group on the projective line is sharply 3-transitive ([[faithful group action|faithful]] and 3-[[transitive group action|transitive]]), so the map is one-to-one and has image a 3-transitive subgroup.\nThus the image is a 3-transitive subgroup of known order, which allows it to be identified. This yields the following maps:\n*PSL(2, 2) = PGL(2, 2) → ''S''<sub>3</sub>, of order 6, which is an isomorphism.\n** The inverse map (a projective [[Dihedral group of order 6#Representation theory|representation of ''S''<sub>3</sub>]]) can be realized by the [[anharmonic group]], and more generally yields an embedding ''S''<sub>3</sub> → PGL(2, ''q'') for all fields.\n*PSL(2, 3) < PGL(2, 3) → ''S''<sub>4</sub>, of orders 12 and 24, the latter of which is an isomorphism, with PSL(2, 3) being the alternating group.\n** The anharmonic group gives a partial map in the opposite direction, mapping ''S''<sub>3</sub> → PGL(2, 3) as the stabilizer of the point −1.\n*PSL(2, 4) = PGL(2, 4) → ''S''<sub>5</sub>, of order 60, yielding the alternating group ''A''<sub>5</sub>.\n*PSL(2, 5) < PGL(2, 5) → ''S''<sub>6</sub>, of orders 60 and 120, which yields an embedding of ''S''<sub>5</sub> (respectively, ''A''<sub>5</sub>) as a ''transitive'' subgroup of ''S''<sub>6</sub> (respectively, ''A''<sub>6</sub>). This is an example of an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#Exotic map|exotic map ''S''<sub>5</sub> → ''S''<sub>6</sub>]], and can be used to construct the [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism of ''S''<sub>6</sub>]].<ref>{{citation|title=Small finite sets |work=[http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/ Secret Blogging Seminar] |date=2007-10-27 |first=Scott |last=Carnahan | url=http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/small-finite-sets/ |postscript=, notes on a talk by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]].}}</ref> Note that the isomorphism PGL(2, 5) ≅ ''S''<sub>5</sub> is not transparent from this presentation: there is no particularly natural set of 5 elements on which PGL(2, 5) acts.\n\n====Action on ''p'' points====\nWhile PSL(''n'', ''q'') naturally acts on (''q''<sup>''n''</sup>−1)/(''q''−1) = 1+''q''+...+''q''<sup>''n''−1</sup> points, non-trivial actions on fewer points are rarer.

(The same is true for subgroups of ''L''<sub>2</sub>(7) isomorphic to ''S''<sub>4</sub>, and this also has a biplane geometry.)\n\nGeometrically, this action can be understood via a ''[[biplane geometry]],'' which is defined as follows. A biplane geometry is a [[symmetric design]] (a set of points and an equal number of \"lines\", or rather blocks) such that any set of two points is contained in two lines, while any two lines intersect in two points; this is similar to a finite projective plane, except that rather than two points determining one line (and two lines determining one point), they determine two lines (respectively, points). In this case (the [[Paley biplane]], obtained from the [[Paley digraph]] of order 11), the points are the affine line (the finite field) '''F'''<sub>11</sub>, where the first line is defined to be the five non-zero [[quadratic residue]]s (points which are squares: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9), and the other lines are the affine translates of this (add a constant to all the points). ''L''<sub>2</sub>(11) is then isomorphic to the subgroup of ''S''<sub>11</sub> that preserve this geometry (sends lines to lines), giving a set of 11 points on which it acts – in fact two: the points or the lines, which corresponds to the outer automorphism – while ''L''<sub>2</sub>(5) is the stabilizer of a given line, or dually of a given point.\n\nMore surprisingly, the coset space ''L''<sub>2</sub>(11)/'''Z'''/11'''Z''', which has order 660/11&nbsp;=&nbsp;60 (and on which the icosahedral group acts) naturally has the structure of a [[buckeyball]], which is used in the construction of the [[buckyball surface]].\n\n===Mathieu groups===\n{{details|Mathieu group}}\nThe group PSL(3, 4) can be used to construct the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>24</sub>, one of the [[sporadic simple group]]s; in this context, one refers to PSL(3, 4) as M<sub>21</sub>, though it is not properly a Mathieu group itself. One begins with the projective plane over the field with four elements, which is a [[Steiner system]] of type S(2, 5, 21) – meaning that it has 21 points, each line (\"block\", in Steiner terminology) has 5 points, and any 2 points determine a line – and on which PSL(3, 4) acts. One calls this Steiner system W<sub>21</sub> (\"W\" for [[Ernst Witt|Witt]]), and then expands it to a larger Steiner system W<sub>24</sub>, expanding the symmetry group along the way: to the projective general linear group PGL(3, 4), then to the [[projective semilinear group]] PΓL(3, 4), and finally to the Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub>.\n\nM<sub>24</sub> also contains copies of PSL(2, 11), which is maximal in M<sub>22</sub>, and PSL(2, 23), which is maximal in M<sub>24</sub>, and can be used to construct M<sub>24</sub>.<ref>Conway, Sloane, SPLAG</ref>\n\n===Hurwitz surfaces===\n[[File:3-7 kisrhombille.svg|thumb|Some PSL groups arise as automorphism groups of Hurwitz surfaces, i.e., as quotients of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]], which is the symmetries of the [[order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling]].]]\n{{see|Hurwitz surface}}\nPSL groups arise as [[Hurwitz group]]s (automorphism groups of [[Hurwitz surface]]s – algebraic curves of maximal possibly symmetry group).

For the reals, SL is a 2-fold cover of PSL for ''n'' even, and is a 1-fold cover for ''n'' odd, i.e., an isomorphism:\n:{±1} → SL(2''n'', '''R''') → PSL(2''n'', '''R''')\n:<math>\\operatorname{SL}(2n+1, \\mathbf{R}) \\overset{\\sim}{\\to} \\operatorname{PSL}(2n+1,\\mathbf{R})</math>\nFor the complexes, SL is an ''n''-fold cover of PSL.\n\nFor PGL, for the reals, the fiber is '''R'''* ≅ {±1}, so up to homotopy, GL → PGL is a 2-fold covering space, and all higher homotopy groups agree.\n\nFor PGL over the complexes, the fiber is '''C'''* ≅ '''S'''<sup>1</sup>, so up to homotopy, GL → PGL is a circle bundle. The higher homotopy groups of the circle vanish, so the homotopy groups of GL(''n'', '''C''') and PGL(''n'', '''C''') agree for ''n'' ≥ 3. In fact, π<sub>2</sub> always vanishes for Lie groups, so the homotopy groups agree for ''n'' ≥ 2. For ''n'' = 1, we have that π<sub>1</sub>(GL(''n'', '''C''')) = π<sub>1</sub>('''S'''<sup>1</sup>) = '''Z''' and hence PGL(''n'', '''C''') is simply connected.\n\n=== Covering groups ===\nOver the real and complex numbers, the projective special linear groups are the ''minimal'' ([[centerless]]) Lie group realizations for the special linear Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{sl}(n)\\colon</math> every connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{sl}(n)</math> is a cover of PSL(''n'', ''F'').

Explicitly, the projective orthogonal group is the [[quotient group]]\n:PO(''V'') = O(''V'')/ZO(''V'') = O(''V'')/{±''I''}\nwhere O(''V'') is the orthogonal group of (''V'') and ZO(''V'')={±''I''} is the subgroup of all orthogonal [[scalar transformation]]s of ''V'' – these consist of the identity and [[reflection through the origin]]. These scalars are quotiented out because they act [[trivial action|trivially]] on the projective space and they form the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the action, and the notation \"Z\" is because the scalar transformations are the [[center of a group|center]] of the orthogonal group.\n\nThe '''projective special orthogonal group''', PSO, is defined analogously, as the induced action of the [[special orthogonal group]] on the associated projective space. Explicitly:\n:PSO(''V'') = SO(''V'')/ZSO(''V'')\nwhere SO(''V'') is the special orthogonal group over ''V'' and ZSO(''V'') is the subgroup of orthogonal scalar transformations with unit [[determinant]]. Here ZSO is the center of SO, and is trivial in odd dimension, while it equals {±1} in even dimension – this odd/even distinction occurs throughout the structure of the orthogonal groups. By analogy with GL/SL and GO/SO, the projective orthogonal group is also sometimes called the '''projective ''general'' orthogonal group''' and denoted PGO.\n\nLike the orthogonal group, the projective orthogonal group can be defined over any field and with varied quadratic forms, though, as with the ordinary orthogonal group, the main emphasis is on the ''real'' ''positive definite'' projective orthogonal group; other fields are elaborated in [[#Generalizations|generalizations]], below. Except when mentioned otherwise, in the sequel PO and PSO will refer to the real positive definite groups.\n\nLike the [[spin group]]s and [[pin group]]s, which are covers rather than quotients of the (special) orthogonal groups, the projective (special) orthogonal groups are of interest for (projective) geometric analogs of Euclidean geometry, as related [[Lie group]]s, and in [[representation theory]].\n\nMore intrinsically, the (real positive definite) projective orthogonal group PO can be defined as the [[isometries]] of [[real projective space]], while PSO can be defined as the [[orientation-preserving]] isometries of real projective space (when the space is orientable; otherwise PSO = PO).\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Odd and even dimensions ===\n[[File:SO-O-PSO-PO-2k.svg|right]]\n\nThe structure of PO differs significantly between odd and even dimension, fundamentally because in even dimension, [[reflection through the origin]] is orientation-preserving, while in odd dimension it is orientation-reversing (<math>-I \\in SO(2k)</math> but <math>-I \\not\\in SO(2k+1)</math>). This is reflected in odd-dimensional real projective space being orientable, while even-dimensional real projective space is nonorientable, and at a more abstract level, the [[Lie algebra]]s of odd and even dimensional projective orthogonal groups are in two different families: <math>B_k = \\mathfrak{so}_{2k+1}, D_k = \\mathfrak{so}_{2k}.</math>\n\nThus, <math>O(2k+1) = SO(2k+1) \\times \\{\\pm I\\},</math><ref\ngroup=\"note\">This product is an [[internal direct sum]] – a product of\nsubgroups – not just an abstract [[external direct sum]].</ref>\nwhile <math>O(2k) \\neq SO(2k) \\times \\{\\pm I\\}</math> and is instead a non-trivial [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of PO(2''k'').\n\nBeware that PO(2''k''+1) is isometries of <math>\\mathbf{RP}^{2k} = \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{R}^{2k+1}),</math> while PO(2''k'') is isometries of <math>\\mathbf{RP}^{2k-1} = \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{R}^{2k})</math> – the odd-dimensional (vector) group is isometries of even-dimensional projective space, while the even-dimensional (vector) group is isometries of odd-dimensional projective space.\n\n[[File:SO-O-PSO-PO-2k+1.svg|right]]\nIn odd dimension, <math>SO(2k+1) \\cong PSO(2k+1) = PO(2k+1),</math><ref group=\"note\">The [[isomorphism]]/equality distinction in this equation is because the context is the 2-to-1 quotient map <math>O \\to PO</math> – PSO(2''k''+1) and PO(2''k''+1) are equal subsets of the target (namely, the whole space), hence the equality, while the induced map <math>SO \\to PSO</math> is an isomorphism but the two groups are subsets of different spaces, hence the isomorphism rather than an equality. See {{Harv | Conway | Smith | 2003 | loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=E_HCwwxMbfMC&pg=PA34 p. 34]}} for an example of this distinction being made.</ref> so the group of projective isometries can be identified with the group of rotational isometries.\n\nIn even dimension, SO(2''k'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;PSO(2''k'') and O(2''k'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;PO(2''k'') are both 2-to-1 covers, and PSO(2''k'') < PO(2''k'') is an [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 subgroup.\n\n=== General properties ===\nPSO and PO are [[centerless]], as with PSL and PGL; this is because scalar matrices are not only the center of SO and O, but also the [[hypercenter]] (quotient by the center does not always yield a centerless group).\n\nPSO is the [[maximal compact subgroup]] in the [[projective special linear group]] PSL, while PO is maximal compact in the [[projective general linear group]] PGL. This is analogous to SO being maximal compact in SL and O being maximal compact in GL.\n\n== Representation theory ==\n{{Further|Projective representation}}\nPO is of basic interest in representation theory: a group homomorphism ''G''&nbsp;→&nbsp;PGL is called a '''[[projective representation]]''' of ''G,'' just as a map G&nbsp;→&nbsp;GL is called a '''linear representation''' of G, and just as any linear representation can be reduced to a map ''G''&nbsp;→&nbsp;O (by taking an invariant inner product), any projective representation can be reduced to a map ''G''&nbsp;→&nbsp;PO.\n\nSee [[projective linear group#Representation theory|projective linear group: representation theory]] for further discussion.\n\n== Subgroups ==\n{{See also|Spin group#Discrete subgroups|Binary polyhedral group}}\nSubgroups of the projective orthogonal group correspond to subgroups of the orthogonal group that contain <math>-I</math> (that have [[central symmetry]]). As always with a quotient map (by the [[lattice theorem]]), there is a [[Galois connection]] between subgroups of O and PO, where the adjunction on O (given by taking the image in PO and then the preimage in O) simply adds <math>-I</math> if absent.\n\nOf particular interest are discrete subgroups, which can be realized as symmetries of [[projective polytope]]s – these correspond to the (discrete) point groups that include central symmetry. Compare with [[Spin group#Discrete subgroups|discrete subgroups of the Spin group]], particularly the 3-dimensional case of [[binary polyhedral group]]s.\n\nFor example, in 3 dimensions, 4 of the 5 [[Platonic solid]]s have central symmetry (cube/octahedron, dodecahedron/icosahedron), while the tetrahedron does not – however, the [[stellated octahedron]] has central symmetry, though the resulting symmetry group is the same as that of the cube/octahedron.\n\n== Topology ==\n{{See also|Orthogonal group#Covering and quotient groups}}\nPO and PSO, as centerless topological groups, are at the bottom of a sequence of [[covering group]]s, whose top are the ([[simply connected]]) [[Pin group]]s or [[Spin group]], respectively:\n:Pin<sub>±</sub>(''n'')&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;O(''n'')&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;PO(''n'').\n:Spin(''n'')&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;SO(''n'')&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;PSO(''n'').\nThese groups are all [[compact real form]]s of the same Lie algebra.\n\nThese are all 2-to-1 covers, except for SO(2''k''+1)&nbsp;→&nbsp;PSO(2''k''+1) which is 1-to-1 (an isomorphism).\n\n=== Homotopy groups ===\n[[Homotopy group]]s above <math>\\pi_1</math> do not change under covers, so they agree with those of the orthogonal group. The lower homotopy groups are given as follows.\n:<math>\\pi_0(PSO) \\cong 1</math>\n:<math>\\pi_0\\big(PO(2k)\\big) \\cong \\mathbf{Z}/2, \\pi_0\\big(PO(2k+1)\\big) \\cong 1.</math>\n\nThe fundamental group of (centerless) PSO(''n'') equals the center of (simply connected) Spin(''n''), which is always true about covering groups:\n:<math>\\pi_1\\big(PSO(n)\\big) = \\pi_1 \\big(PO(n)\\big) = Z\\big(Spin(n)\\big).</math>\nUsing the [[Spin group#Center|table of centers of Spin groups]] yields (for <math>k \\geq 1</math>):\n:<math>\\pi_1 \\big(PSO(4k)\\big) = \\mathbf{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}/2,</math>\n:<math>\\pi_1 \\big(PSO(4k+2)\\big) = \\mathbf{Z}/4,</math>\n:<math>\\pi_1 \\big(PSO(2k+1)\\big) = \\pi_1\\big(SO(2k+1)\\big) = \\mathbf{Z}/2,</math>\nIn low dimensions:\n:<math>\\pi_1 \\big(PSO(1)\\big) = 1,</math> as the group is trivial.\n:<math>\\pi_1 \\big(PSO(2)\\big) = \\mathbf{Z},</math> as it is topologically a circle, though note that the preimage of the identity in Spin(2) is <math>\\mathbf{Z}/4,</math> as for other <math>4k+2.</math>\n\n=== Homology groups ===\n{{Empty section|date=May 2010}}\n\n=== Bundles ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nJust as the orthogonal group is the [[structure group]] of [[vector bundle]]s, the projective orthogonal group is the structure group of [[projective bundle]]s, and the corresponding [[classifying space]] is denoted BPO.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nAs with the orthogonal group, the projective orthogonal group can be generalized in two main ways: changing the field or changing the quadratic form. Other than the real numbers, primary interest is in complex numbers or finite fields, while (over the reals) quadratic forms can also be [[indefinite form]]s, and are denoted PO(''p'',''q'') by their signature.\n\nThe complex projective orthogonal group, PO(''n'','''C''') should not be confused with the [[projective unitary group]], PU(''n''): PO preserves a symmetric form, while PU preserves a [[hermitian form]] – PU is the symmetries of complex projective space (preserving the [[Fubini–Study metric]]).\n\nIn fields of characteristic 2 there are added complications: quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms are no longer equivalent, <math>I = -I,</math> and the determinant needs to be replaced by the [[Orthogonal group|Dickson invariant]].\n\n=== Finite fields ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nThe projective orthogonal group over a finite field is used in the construction of a family of finite [[simple group]]s of [[Group of Lie type|Lie type]], namely the [[Chevalley group]]s of type D<sub>''n''</sub>. The orthogonal group over a finite field, O(''n'',''q'') is not simple, since it has SO as a subgroup and a non-trivial center ({±''I''}) (hence PO as quotient). These are both fixed by passing to PSO, but PSO itself is not in general simple, and instead one must use a subgroup (which may be of index 1 or 2), defined by the [[spinor norm]] (in odd characteristic) or the quasideterminant (in even characteristic).<ref>[[ATLAS of Finite Groups|ATLAS]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=38fEMl2-Fp8C&dq=%22projective%20special%20orthogonal%20group%22&pg=PR11 p. xi]</ref> The quasideterminant can be defined as <math>(-1)^D</math> where ''D'' is the [[Orthogonal group|Dickson invariant]] (it is the determinant defined by the Dickson invariant), or in terms of the dimension of the fixed space.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist| group = note}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Projective linear group]]\n* [[Orthogonal group]]\n* [[Spin group]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation\n| publisher = A K Peters, Ltd.\n| isbn = 978-1-56881-134-5\n| last1 = Conway\n| first1 = John Horton\n| authorlink1 = John Horton Conway\n| first2 = Derek Alan | last2 = Smith\n| title = On quaternions and octonions\n| date = 2003-02-07\n| chapter = 3.7 The Projective or Elliptic Groups\n| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=E_HCwwxMbfMC&pg=PA34 34]\n}}\n* Conway, J.

When ''f'': ''X'' → U(''H'') is a continuous mapping of a compact space ''X'' into the unitary group, one can use a finite dimensional approximation of its image and a simple K-theoretic trick\n\n:<math>u \\oplus 1_{\\ell^2} \\sim u \\oplus 1_{\\ell^2} \\oplus 1_{\\ell^2} \\oplus \\cdots \\sim u \\oplus u^{-1} \\oplus u \\oplus u^{-1} \\oplus \\cdots \\sim 1_{\\ell^2} \\oplus 1_{\\ell^2} \\oplus \\cdots, \\qquad u \\in {\\rm U}(H),</math>\n\nto show that it is actually homotopic to the trivial map onto a single point. This means that U(''H'') is weakly contractible, and an additional argument shows that it is actually contractible. Note that this is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, in contrast to the finite-dimensional cousins U(''n'') and their limit U(∞) under the inclusion maps which are not contractible admitting homotopically nontrivial continuous mappings onto U(1) given by the determinant of matrices.\n\nThe center of the infinite-dimensional unitary group <math>\\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal H)</math> is, as in the finite dimensional case, U(1), which again acts on the unitary group via multiplication by a phase. As the unitary group does not contain the zero matrix, this action is free. Thus <math>\\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal H)</math> is a contractible space with a U(1) action, which identifies it as [[EU(1)]] and the space of U(1) orbits as [[BU(1)]], the [[classifying space]] for U(1).\n\n===The homotopy and (co)homology of PU(''H'')===\n\n<math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> is defined precisely to be the space of orbits of the U(1) action on <math>\\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal H)</math>, thus <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> is a realization of the classifying space BU(1). In particular, using the isomorphism\n\n:<math>\\pi_n(X)=\\pi_{n+1}(BX)</math>\n\nbetween the [[homotopy group]]s of a space X and the homotopy groups of its classifying space BX, combined with the homotopy type of the circle U(1)\n\n:<math>\\pi_k (\\mathrm{U}(1)) = \\begin{cases} \\mathbf Z & k= 1 \\\\ 0 & k \\neq 1 \\end{cases}</math>\n\nwe find the homotopy groups of <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math>\n\n:<math>\\pi_k (\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)) = \\begin{cases} \\mathbf Z & k= 2 \\\\ 0 & k \\neq 2 \\end{cases}</math>\n\nthus identifying <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> as a representative of the [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]] K('''Z''', 2).\n\nAs a consequence, <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> must be of the same homotopy type as the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]], which also represents K('''Z''', 2). This means in particular that they have isomorphic [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology]] groups:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm H^{2n}(\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H))   &= \\mathrm H_{2n}(\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H))   = \\mathbf Z \\\\\n\\mathrm H^{2n+1}(\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)) &= \\mathrm H_{2n+1}(\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)) = 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Representations==\n\n===The adjoint representation===\nPU(''n'') in general has no ''n''-dimensional representations, just as SO(3) has no two-dimensional representations.\n\nPU(''n'') has an adjoint action on SU(''n''), thus it has an <math>(n^2-1)</math>-dimensional representation. When ''n'' = 2 this corresponds to the three dimensional representation of SO(3). The adjoint action is defined by thinking of an element of PU(''n'') as an equivalence class of elements of U(''n'') that differ by phases. One can then take the adjoint action with respect to any of these U(''n'') representatives, and the phases commute with everything and so cancel. Thus the action is independent of the choice of representative and so it is well-defined.\n\n===Projective representations===\nIn many applications PU(''n'') does not act in any linear representation, but instead in a [[projective representation]], which is a representation up to a phase which is independent of the vector on which one acts. These are useful in quantum mechanics, as physical states are only defined up to phase. For example, massive fermionic states transform under a projective representation but not under a representation of the little group PU(2) = SO(3).\n\nThe projective representations of a group are classified by its second integral [[cohomology]], which in this case is\n\n:<math>\\mathrm H^2(\\mathrm{PU}(n)) = \\mathbf Z / n</math> \n\nor \n\n:<math>\\mathrm H^2(\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)) = \\mathbf Z.</math>\n\nThe cohomology groups in the finite case can be derived from the [[long exact sequence]] for bundles and the above fact that SU(''n'') is a '''Z'''/''n'' bundle over PU(''n''). The cohomology in the infinite case was argued above from the isomorphism with the cohomology of the infinite complex projective space.\n\nThus PU(''n'') enjoys ''n'' projective representations, of which the first is the fundamental representation of its SU(''n'') cover, while <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> has a countably infinite number. As usual, the projective representations of a group are ordinary representations of a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the group. In this case the central extended group corresponding to the first projective representation of each projective unitary group is just the original [[unitary group]] of which we took the quotient by U(1) in the definition of PU.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Twisted K-theory===\nThe adjoint action of the infinite projective unitary group is useful in geometric definitions of [[twisted K-theory]]. Here the adjoint action of the infinite-dimensional <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> on either the [[Fredholm operator]]s or the infinite [[unitary group]] is used.\n\nIn geometrical constructions of twisted K-theory with twist ''H'', the <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> is the fiber of a bundle, and different twists ''H'' correspond to different fibrations. As seen below, topologically <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> represents the [[Eilenberg–Maclane space]] K('''Z''', 2), therefore the classifying space of <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> bundles is the Eilenberg–Maclane space K('''Z''', 3). K('''Z''', 3) is also the classifying space for the third integral [[cohomology]] group, therefore <math>\\mathrm{PU}(\\mathcal H)</math> bundles are classified by the third integral cohomology. As a result, the possible twists ''H'' of a twisted K-theory are precisely the elements of the third integral cohomology.\n\n===Pure Yang–Mills gauge theory===\nIn the pure Yang–Mills SU(''n'') [[gauge theory]], which is a gauge theory with only [[gluon]]s and no fundamental matter, all fields transform in the adjoint of the gauge group SU(''n''). The '''Z'''/''n'' center of SU(''n'') commutes, being in the center, with SU(''n'')-valued fields and so the adjoint action of the center is trivial. Therefore the gauge symmetry is the quotient of SU(''n'') by '''Z'''/''n'', which is PU(''n'') and it acts on fields using the adjoint action described above.\n\nIn this context, the distinction between SU(''n'') and PU(''n'') has an important physical consequence. SU(''n'') is simply connected, but the fundamental group of PU(''n'') is '''Z'''/''n'', the cyclic group of order ''n''. Therefore a PU(''n'') gauge theory with adjoint scalars will have nontrivial codimension 2 [[vortex|vortices]] in which the expectation values of the scalars wind around PU(''n'')'s nontrivial cycle as one encircles the vortex. These vortices, therefore, also have charges in '''Z'''/''n'', which implies that they attract each other and when ''n'' come into contact they annihilate. An example of such a vortex is the Douglas–Shenker string in SU(''n'') [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory|Seiberg–Witten gauge theories]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{Citation | last1=Grove | first1=Larry C. | title=Classical groups and geometric algebra | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-2019-3 |mr=1859189 | year=2002 | volume=39}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[unitary group]]\n*[[special unitary group]]\n*[[unitary operators]]\n*[[projective orthogonal group]]\n\n[[Category:Lie groups]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Ratner's theorems''' are a group of major theorems in [[ergodic theory]] concerning unipotent flows on [[homogeneous space]]s proved by [[Marina Ratner]] around 1990. The theorems grew out of Ratner's earlier work on [[horocycle flow]]s. The study of the dynamics of unipotent flows played a decisive role in the proof of the [[Oppenheim conjecture]] by [[Grigory Margulis]]. Ratner's theorems have guided key advances in the understanding of the dynamics of unipotent flows. Their later generalizations provide ways to both sharpen the results and extend the theory to the setting of arbitrary [[semisimple algebraic group]]s over a [[local field]].\n\n== Short description ==\nThe '''Ratner orbit closure theorem''' asserts that the closures of orbits of unipotent flows on the quotient of a Lie group by a lattice are nice, geometric subsets. The '''Ratner equidistribution theorem''' further asserts that each such orbit is equidistributed in its closure. The '''Ratner measure classification theorem''' is the weaker statement that every ergodic invariant probability measure is homogeneous, or ''algebraic'': this turns out to be an important step towards proving the more general equidistribution property. There is no universal agreement on the names of these theorems: they are variously known as the \"measure rigidity theorem\", the \"theorem on invariant measures\" and its \"topological version\", and so on.\n\nLet <math> G </math> be a [[Lie group]], <math> \\mathit{\\Gamma} </math> a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in <math> G </math>, and <math> u^t </math> a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of <math> G </math> consisting of [[unipotent]] elements, with the associated [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] <math> \\phi_t </math> on <math> \\mathit{\\Gamma} \\setminus G </math>.

      "title": "Reductive group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductive_group",
      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar|Algebraic}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''reductive group''' is a type of [[linear algebraic group]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. One definition is that a connected linear algebraic group ''G'' over a [[perfect field]] is reductive if it has a [[group representation|representation]] with finite [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] which is a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representation]]s. Reductive groups include some of the most important groups in mathematics, such as the [[general linear group]] ''GL''(''n'') of [[invertible matrices]], the [[special orthogonal group]] ''SO''(''n''), and the [[symplectic group]] ''Sp''(2''n''). '''Simple algebraic groups''' and (more generally) '''semisimple algebraic groups''' are reductive.\n\n[[Claude Chevalley]] showed that the classification of reductive groups is the same over any [[algebraically closed field]]. In particular, the simple algebraic groups are classified by [[Dynkin diagram]]s, as in the theory of [[compact Lie group]]s or [[complex number|complex]] [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. Reductive groups over an arbitrary field are harder to classify, but for many fields such as the [[real number]]s '''R''' or a [[number field]], the classification is well understood. The [[classification of finite simple groups]] says that most finite simple groups arise as the group ''G''(''k'') of ''k''-[[rational point]]s of a simple algebraic group ''G'' over a [[finite field]] ''k'', or as minor variants of that construction.\n\nReductive groups have a rich [[representation theory]] in various contexts. First, one can study the representations of a reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' as an algebraic group, which are actions of ''G'' on ''k''-vector spaces. But also, one can study the complex representations of the group ''G''(''k'') when ''k'' is a finite field, or the infinite-dimensional [[unitary representation]]s of a real reductive group, or the [[automorphic representation]]s of an [[adelic algebraic group]]. The structure theory of reductive groups is used in all these areas.\n\n==Definitions==\n{{main|Linear algebraic group}}\nA [[linear algebraic group]] over a field ''k'' is defined as a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] closed [[group scheme|subgroup scheme]] of ''GL''(''n'') over ''k'', for some positive integer ''n''. Equivalently, a linear algebraic group over ''k'' is a smooth [[affine scheme|affine]] group scheme over ''k''.\n\nA [[connected space|connected]] linear algebraic group ''G'' over an algebraically closed field is called '''semisimple''' if every smooth connected [[solvable group|solvable]] [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'' is trivial. More generally, a connected linear algebraic group ''G'' over an algebraically closed field is called '''reductive''' if every smooth connected [[linear algebraic group#Unipotent groups|unipotent]] normal subgroup of ''G'' is trivial.<ref>SGA 3 (2011), v. 3, Définition XIX.1.6.1.</ref> (Some authors do not require reductive groups to be connected.) A group ''G'' over an arbitrary field ''k'' is called semisimple or reductive if the [[fiber product of schemes|base change]] <math>G_{\\overline k}</math> is semisimple or reductive, where <math>\\overline k</math> is an [[algebraic closure]] of ''k''. (This is equivalent to the definition of reductive groups in the introduction when ''k'' is perfect.<ref>Milne (2017), Proposition 21.60.</ref>) Any [[linear algebraic group#Tori|torus]] over ''k'', such as the [[linear algebraic group#Examples|multiplicative group]] ''G''<sub>''m''</sub>, is reductive.\n\nThe basic example of a non-reductive linear algebraic group is the [[linear algebraic group#Examples|additive group]] ''G''<sub>''a''</sub> over a field.\n\nA linear algebraic group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is called '''simple''' (or ''k''-'''simple''') if it is semisimple, nontrivial, and every smooth connected normal subgroup of ''G'' over ''k'' is trivial or equal to ''G''.<ref>Conrad (2014), after Proposition 5.1.17.</ref> (Some authors call this property \"almost simple\".) This differs slightly from the terminology for abstract groups, in that a simple algebraic group may have nontrivial [[center (group theory)|center]] (although the center must be finite). For example, for any integer ''n'' at least 2 and any field ''k'', the group ''SL''(''n'') over ''k'' is simple, and its center is the [[multiplicative group#Group scheme of roots of unity|group scheme μ<sub>''n''</sub>]] of ''n''th roots of unity.\n\nA '''central isogeny''' of reductive groups is a surjective [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] with kernel a finite [[central subgroup|central]] subgroup scheme. Every reductive group over a field admits a central isogeny from the product of a torus and some simple groups. For example, over any field ''k'',\n:<math>GL(n)\\cong (G_m\\times SL(n))/\\mu_n.</math>\n\nIt is slightly awkward that the definition of a reductive group over a field involves passage to the algebraic closure. For a perfect field ''k'', that can be avoided: a linear algebraic group ''G'' over ''k'' is reductive if and only if every smooth connected unipotent normal ''k''-subgroup of ''G'' is trivial. For an arbitrary field, the latter property defines a [[pseudo-reductive group]], which is somewhat more general.\n\nA reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is called '''split''' if it contains a split maximal torus ''T'' over ''k'' (that is, a [[linear algebraic group#Tori|split torus]] in ''G'' whose base change to <math>\\overline k</math> is a maximal torus in <math>G_{\\overline k}</math>). By [[Alexander Grothendieck]], it is equivalent to say that ''T'' is a split torus in ''G'' that is maximal among all ''k''-tori in ''G''.<ref>Borel (1991), 18.2(i).</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nA fundamental example of a reductive group is the general linear group ''GL''(''n'') of invertible ''n'' × ''n'' matrices over a field ''k'', for a natural number ''n''. In particular, the '''multiplicative group''' ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> is the group ''GL''(1), and so its group ''G''<sub>''m''</sub>(''k'') of ''k''-rational points is the group ''k''* of nonzero elements of ''k'' under multiplication. Another reductive group is the [[special linear group]] ''SL''(''n'') over a field ''k'', the subgroup of matrices with [[determinant]] 1. In fact, ''SL''(''n'') is a simple algebraic group for ''n'' at least 2.\n\nAn important simple group is the [[symplectic group]] ''Sp''(2''n'') over a field ''k'', the subgroup of ''GL''(2''n'') that preserves a nondegenerate alternating [[bilinear form]] on the [[vector space]] ''k''<sup>2''n''</sup>. Likewise, the [[orthogonal group]] ''O''(''q'') is the subgroup of the general linear group that preserves a nondegenerate [[quadratic form]] ''q'' on a vector space over a field ''k''. The algebraic group ''O''(''q'') has two [[connected component (topology)|connected components]], and its [[identity component]] ''SO''(''q'') is reductive, in fact simple for ''q'' of dimension ''n'' at least 3. (For ''k'' of characteristic 2 and ''n'' odd, the group scheme ''O''(''q'') is in fact connected but not smooth over ''k''. The simple group ''SO''(''q'') can always be defined as the maximal smooth connected subgroup of ''O''(''q'') over ''k''.) When ''k'' is algebraically closed, any two (nondegenerate) quadratic forms of the same dimension are isomorphic, and so it is reasonable to call this group ''SO''(''n''). For a general field ''k'', different quadratic forms of dimension ''n'' can yield non-isomorphic simple groups ''SO''(''q'') over ''k'', although they all have the same base change to the algebraic closure <math>\\overline k</math>.\n\n==Other characterizations of reductive groups==\nEvery compact connected Lie group has a [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]], which is a complex reductive algebraic group. In fact, this construction gives a one-to-one correspondence between compact connected Lie groups and complex reductive groups, up to isomorphism. For a compact Lie group ''K'' with complexification ''G'', the inclusion from ''K'' into the complex reductive group ''G''('''C''') is a [[homotopy equivalence]], with respect to the classical topology on ''G''('''C'''). For example, the inclusion from the [[unitary group]] ''U''(''n'') to ''GL''(''n'','''C''') is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nFor a reductive group ''G'' over a field of [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] zero, all representations of ''G'' (as an algebraic group) are completely reducible, that is, they are direct sums of irreducible representations.<ref>Milne (2017), Theorem 22.42.</ref> That is the source of the name \"reductive\". Note, however, that complete reducibility fails for reductive groups in positive characteristic (apart from tori). In more detail: an affine group scheme ''G'' of [[Glossary of scheme theory#finite type (locally)|finite type]] over a field ''k'' is called '''linearly reductive''' if its representations are completely reducible. For ''k'' of characteristic zero, ''G'' is linearly reductive if and only if the identity component ''G''<sup>o</sup> of ''G'' is reductive.<ref>Milne (2017), Corollary 22.43.</ref> For ''k'' of characteristic ''p''>0, however, [[Masayoshi Nagata]] showed that ''G'' is linearly reductive if and only if ''G''<sup>o</sup> is of [[Group scheme#Constructions|multiplicative type]] and ''G''/''G''<sup>o</sup> has order prime to ''p''.<ref>Demazure & Gabriel (1970), Théorème IV.3.3.6.</ref>\n\n==Roots==\nThe classification of reductive algebraic groups is in terms of the associated [[root system]], as in the theories of complex semisimple Lie algebras or compact Lie groups. Here is the way roots appear for reductive groups.\n\nLet ''G'' be a split reductive group over a field ''k'', and let ''T'' be a split maximal torus in ''G''; so ''T'' is isomorphic to (''G''<sub>''m''</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup> for some ''n'', with ''n'' called the '''rank''' of ''G''. Every representation of ''T'' (as an algebraic group) is a direct sum of 1-dimensional representations.<ref>Milne (2017), Theorem 12.12.</ref> A '''weight''' for ''G'' means an isomorphism class of 1-dimensional representations of ''T'', or equivalently a homomorphism ''T'' → ''G''<sub>''m''</sub>. The weights form a group ''X''(''T'') under [[tensor product]] of representations, with ''X''(''T'') isomorphic to the product of ''n'' copies of the [[integer]]s, '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nThe [[adjoint representation]] is the action of ''G'' by conjugation on its [[linear algebraic group#The Lie algebra of an algebraic group|Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. A '''root''' of ''G'' means a nonzero weight that occurs in the action of ''T'' ⊂ ''G'' on <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. The subspace of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> corresponding to each root is 1-dimensional, and the subspace of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> fixed by ''T'' is exactly the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak t</math> of ''T''.<ref name=\"M2111\">Milne (2017), Theorem 21.11.</ref> Therefore, the Lie algebra of ''G'' decomposes into <math>\\mathfrak t</math> together with 1-dimensional subspaces indexed by the set Φ of roots:\n:<math>{\\mathfrak g} = {\\mathfrak t}\\oplus \\oplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi} {\\mathfrak g}_{\\alpha}.</math>\n\nFor example, when ''G'' is the group ''GL''(''n''), its Lie algebra <math>{\\mathfrak gl}(n)</math> is the vector space of all ''n'' × ''n'' matrices over ''k''. Let ''T'' be the subgroup of diagonal matrices in ''G''. Then the root-space decomposition expresses <math>{\\mathfrak gl}(n)</math> as the direct sum of the diagonal matrices and the 1-dimensional subspaces indexed by the off-diagonal positions (''i'', ''j''). Writing ''L''<sub>1</sub>,...,''L''<sub>''n''</sub> for the standard basis for the weight lattice ''X''(''T'') ≅ '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the roots are the elements ''L''<sub>''i''</sub> − ''L''<sub>''j''</sub> for all ''i'' ≠ ''j'' from 1 to ''n''.\n\nThe roots of a semisimple group form a '''root system'''; this is a combinatorial structure which can be completely classified. More generally, the roots of a reductive group form a [[root datum]], a slight variation.<ref>Milne (2017), Corollary 21.12.</ref> The '''[[Weyl group]]''' of a reductive group ''G'' means the [[quotient group]] of the [[normalizer]] of a maximal torus by the torus, ''W'' = ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''T'')/''T''. The Weyl group is in fact a finite group generated by reflections. For example, for the group ''GL''(''n'') (or ''SL''(''n'')), the Weyl group is the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThere are finitely many [[linear algebraic group#Borel subgroups|Borel subgroups]] containing a given maximal torus, and they are permuted [[simply transitively]] by the Weyl group (acting by [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugation]]).<ref>Milne (2017), Proposition 17.53.</ref> A choice of Borel subgroup determines a set of '''positive roots''' Φ<sup>+</sup> ⊂ Φ, with the property that Φ is the disjoint union of Φ<sup>+</sup> and −Φ<sup>+</sup>. Explicitly, the Lie algebra of ''B'' is the direct sum of the Lie algebra of ''T'' and the positive root spaces:\n:<math>{\\mathfrak b}={\\mathfrak t}\\oplus \\oplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi^{+}} {\\mathfrak g}_{\\alpha}.</math>\nFor example, if ''B'' is the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular matrices in ''GL''(''n''), then this is the obvious decomposition of the subspace <math>\\mathfrak b</math> of upper-triangular matrices in <math>{\\mathfrak gl}(n)</math>. The positive roots are ''L''<sub>''i''</sub> − ''L''<sub>''j''</sub> for 1 ≤ ''i'' < ''j'' ≤ ''n''.\n\nA '''simple root''' means a positive root that is not a sum of two other positive roots. Write Δ for the set of simple roots. The number ''r'' of simple roots is equal to the rank of the [[commutator subgroup]] of ''G'', called the '''semisimple rank''' of ''G'' (which is simply the rank of ''G'' if ''G'' is semisimple). For example, the simple roots for ''GL''(''n'') (or ''SL''(''n'')) are ''L''<sub>''i''</sub> − ''L''<sub>''i''+1</sub> for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'' − 1.\n\nRoot systems are classified by the corresponding [[Dynkin diagram]], which is a finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (with some edges directed or multiple). The set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram is the set of simple roots. In short, the Dynkin diagram describes the angles between the simple roots and their relative lengths, with respect to a Weyl group-invariant [[inner product]] on the weight lattice. The connected Dynkin diagrams (corresponding to simple groups) are pictured below.\n\nFor a split reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'', an important point is that a root α determines not just a 1-dimensional subspace of the Lie algebra of ''G'', but also a copy of the additive group ''G''<sub>a</sub> in ''G'' with the given Lie algebra, called a '''root subgroup''' ''U''<sub>α</sub>. The root subgroup is the unique copy of the additive group in ''G'' which is [[normalizer|normalized]] by ''T'' and which has the given Lie algebra.<ref name = \"M2111\" /> The whole group ''G'' is generated (as an algebraic group) by ''T'' and the root subgroups, while the Borel subgroup ''B'' is generated by ''T'' and the positive root subgroups. In fact, a split semisimple group ''G'' is generated by the root subgroups alone.\n\n==Parabolic subgroups==\nFor a split reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'', the smooth connected subgroups of ''G'' that contain a given Borel subgroup ''B'' of ''G'' are in one-to-one correspondence with the subsets of the set Δ of simple roots (or equivalently, the subsets of the set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram). Let ''r'' be the order of Δ, the semisimple rank of ''G''. Every '''[[parabolic subgroup]]''' of ''G'' is  [[conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugate]] to a subgroup containing ''B'' by some element of ''G''(''k''). As a result, there are exactly 2<sup>''r''</sup> conjugacy classes of parabolic subgroups in ''G'' over ''k''.<ref>Borel (1991), Proposition 21.12.</ref> Explicitly, the parabolic subgroup corresponding to a given subset ''S'' of Δ is the group generated by ''B'' together with the root subgroups ''U''<sub>−α</sub> for α in ''S''. For example, the parabolic subgroups of ''GL''(''n'') that contain the Borel subgroup ''B'' above are the groups of invertible matrices with zero entries below a given set of squares along the diagonal, such as:\n:<math>\\left \\{ \\begin{bmatrix}\n * & * & * & *\\\\\n * & * & * & *\\\\\n 0 & 0 & * & *\\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & *\n\\end{bmatrix} \\right \\}</math>\n\nBy definition, a parabolic subgroup ''P'' of a reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is a smooth ''k''-subgroup such that the quotient variety ''G''/''P'' is [[proper scheme|proper]] over ''k'', or equivalently [[projective variety|projective]] over ''k''. Thus the classification of parabolic subgroups amounts to a classification of the [[generalized flag variety|projective homogeneous varieties]] for ''G'' (with smooth stabilizer group; that is no restriction for ''k'' of characteristic zero). For ''GL''(''n''), these are the '''flag varieties''', parametrizing sequences of linear subspaces of given dimensions ''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''i''</sub> contained in a fixed vector space ''V'' of dimension ''n'':\n:<math>0\\subset S_{a_1}\\subset \\cdots \\subset S_{a_i}\\subset V.</math>\nFor the orthogonal group or the symplectic group, the projective homogeneous varieties have a similar description as varieties of [[isotropic subspace|isotropic]] flags with respect to a given quadratic form or symplectic form. For any reductive group ''G'' with a Borel subgroup ''B'', ''G''/''B'' is called the '''flag variety''' or '''flag manifold''' of ''G''.\n\n==Classification of split reductive groups==\n[[File:Finite Dynkin diagrams.svg|480px|thumb|The connected Dynkin diagrams]]\n\nChevalley showed in 1958 that the reductive groups over any algebraically closed field are classified up to isomorphism by root data.<ref>Chevalley (2005); Springer (1998), 9.6.2 and 10.1.1.</ref> In particular, the semisimple groups over an algebraically closed field are classified up to central isogenies by their Dynkin diagram, and the simple groups correspond to the connected diagrams. Thus there are simple groups of types A<sub>''n''</sub>,  B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>,  D<sub>''n''</sub>,  E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>. This result is essentially identical to the classifications of compact Lie groups or complex semisimple Lie algebras, by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Élie Cartan]] in the 1880s and 1890s. In particular, the dimensions, centers, and other properties of the simple algebraic groups can be read from the [[list of simple Lie groups]]. It is remarkable that the classification of reductive groups is independent of the characteristic. For comparison, there are many more simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic than in characteristic zero.\n\nThe [[exceptional group]]s ''G'' of type G<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>6</sub> had been constructed earlier, at least in the form of the abstract group ''G''(''k''), by [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|L. E. Dickson]]. For example, the group ''G''<sub>2</sub> is the [[automorphism group]] of an [[octonion algebra]] over ''k''. By contrast, the Chevalley groups of type F<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub> over a field of positive characteristic were completely new.\n\nMore generally, the classification of ''split'' reductive groups is the same over any field.<ref>Milne (2017), Theorems 23.25 and 23.55.</ref> A semisimple group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is called '''simply connected''' if every central isogeny from a semisimple group to ''G'' is an isomorphism. (For ''G'' semisimple over the complex numbers, being simply connected in this sense is equivalent to ''G''('''C''') being [[simply connected]] in the classical topology.) Chevalley's classification gives that, over any field ''k'', there is a unique simply connected split semisimple group ''G'' with a given Dynkin diagram, with simple groups corresponding to the connected diagrams. At the other extreme, a semisimple group is of '''adjoint type''' if its center is trivial. The split semisimple groups over ''k'' with given Dynkin diagram are exactly the groups ''G''/''A'', where ''G'' is the simply connected group and ''A'' is a ''k''-subgroup scheme of the center of ''G''.\n\nFor example, the simply connected split simple groups over a field ''k'' corresponding to the \"classical\" Dynkin diagrams are as follows:\n*A<sub>''n''</sub>: ''SL''(''n''+1) over ''k'';\n*B<sub>''n''</sub>: the [[spin group]] Spin(2''n''+1) associated to a quadratic form of dimension 2''n''+1 over ''k'' with [[Witt index]] ''n'', for example the form\n::<math>q(x_1,\\ldots,x_{2n+1})=x_1x_2+x_3x_4+\\cdots+x_{2n-1}x_{2n}+x_{2n+1}^2;</math>\n*C<sub>''n''</sub>: the symplectic group ''Sp''(2''n'') over ''k'';\n*D<sub>''n''</sub>: the spin group Spin(2''n'') associated to a quadratic form of dimension 2''n'' over ''k'' with Witt index ''n'', which can be written as:\n::<math>q(x_1,\\ldots,x_{2n})=x_1x_2+x_3x_4+\\cdots+x_{2n-1}x_{2n}.</math>\n\nThe [[outer automorphism group]] of a split reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the root datum of ''G''. Moreover, the automorphism group of ''G'' splits as a [[semidirect product]]:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(G)\\cong \\operatorname{Out}(G)\\ltimes (G/Z)(k),</math>\nwhere ''Z'' is the center of ''G''.<ref>Milne (2017), Corollary 23.47.</ref> For a split semisimple simply connected group ''G'' over a field, the outer automorphism group of ''G'' has a simpler description: it is the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of ''G''.\n\n==Reductive group schemes==\nA group scheme ''G'' over a scheme ''S'' is called '''reductive''' if the morphism ''G'' → ''S'' is [[smooth morphism|smooth]] and affine, and every geometric fiber <math>G_{\\overline k}</math> is reductive. (For a point ''p'' in ''S'', the corresponding geometric fiber means the base change of ''G'' to an algebraic closure <math>\\overline k</math> of the residue field of ''p''.) Extending Chevalley's work, [[Michel Demazure]] and Grothendieck showed that split reductive group schemes over any nonempty scheme ''S'' are classified by root data.<ref>SGA 3 (2011), v. 3, Théorème XXV.1.1; Conrad (2014), Theorems 6.1.16 and 6.1.17.</ref> This statement includes the existence of Chevalley groups as group schemes over '''Z''', and it says that every split reductive group over a scheme ''S'' is isomorphic to the base change of a Chevalley group from '''Z''' to ''S''.\n\n==Real reductive groups==\nIn the context of [[Lie group]]s rather than algebraic groups, a '''real reductive group''' is a Lie group ''G'' such that there is a linear algebraic group ''L'' over '''R''' whose identity component (in the [[Zariski topology]]) is reductive, and a homomorphism ''G'' → ''L''('''R''') whose kernel is finite and whose image is open in ''L''('''R''') (in the classical topology). It is also standard to assume that the image of the adjoint representation Ad(''G'') is contained in Int(''g''<sub>'''C'''</sub>) = Ad(''L''<sup>0</sup>('''C''')) (which is automatic for ''G'' connected).<ref>Springer (1979), section 5.1.</ref>\n\nIn particular, every connected semisimple Lie group (meaning that its Lie algebra is semisimple) is reductive. Also, the Lie group '''R''' is reductive in this sense, since it can be viewed as the identity component of ''GL''(1,'''R''') &cong; '''R'''*. The problem of classifying the real reductive groups largely reduces to classifying the simple Lie groups. These are classified by their [[Satake diagram]]; or one can just refer to the [[list of simple Lie groups]] (up to finite coverings).\n\nUseful theories of [[admissible representation]]s and unitary representations have been developed for real reductive groups in this generality. The main differences between this definition and the definition of a reductive algebraic group have to do with the fact that an algebraic group ''G'' over '''R''' may be connected as an algebraic group while the Lie group ''G''('''R''') is not connected, and likewise for simply connected groups. \n\nFor example, the [[projective linear group]] ''PGL''(2) is connected as an algebraic group over any field, but its group of real points ''PGL''(2,'''R''') has two connected components. The identity component of ''PGL''(2,'''R''') (sometimes called ''PSL''(2,'''R''')) is a real reductive group that cannot be viewed as an algebraic group. Similarly, ''SL''(2) is simply connected as an algebraic group over any field, but the Lie group ''SL''(2,'''R''') has [[fundamental group]] isomorphic to the integers '''Z''', and so ''SL''(2,'''R''') has nontrivial [[covering space]]s. By definition, all finite coverings of ''SL''(2,'''R''') (such as the [[metaplectic group]]) are real reductive groups. On the other hand, the [[universal cover]] of ''SL''(2,'''R''') is not a real reductive group, even though its Lie algebra is [[reductive Lie algebra|reductive]], that is, the product of a semisimple Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra.\n\nFor a connected real reductive group ''G'', the quotient manifold ''G''/''K'' of ''G'' by a [[maximal compact subgroup]] ''K'' is a [[symmetric space]] of non-compact type. In fact, every symmetric space of non-compact type arises this way. These are central examples in [[Riemannian geometry]] of manifolds with nonpositive [[sectional curvature]]. For example, ''SL''(2,'''R''')/''SO''(2) is the [[hyperbolic plane]], and ''SL''(2,'''C''')/''SU''(2) is hyperbolic 3-space.\n\nFor a reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' that is complete with respect to a [[discrete valuation]] (such as the [[p-adic numbers]] '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>), the '''[[building (mathematics)|affine building]]''' ''X'' of ''G'' plays the role of the symmetric space. Namely, ''X'' is a [[simplicial complex]] with an action of ''G''(''k''), and ''G''(''k'') preserves a [[CAT(0)]] metric on ''X'', the analog of a metric with nonpositive curvature. The dimension of the affine building is the ''k''-rank of ''G''. For example, the building of ''SL''(2,'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>) is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]].\n\n==Representations of reductive groups==\nFor a split reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'', the irreducible representations of ''G'' (as an algebraic group) are parametrized by the [[dominant weight]]s, which are defined as the intersection of the weight lattice ''X''(''T'')  ≅ '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> with a convex cone (a [[Weyl chamber]]) in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. In particular, this parametrization is independent of the characteristic of ''k''. In more detail, fix a split maximal torus and a Borel subgroup, ''T'' ⊂ ''B'' ⊂ ''G''. Then ''B'' is the semidirect product of ''T'' with a smooth connected unipotent subgroup ''U''. Define a '''highest weight vector''' in a representation ''V'' of ''G'' over ''k'' to be a nonzero vector ''v'' such that ''B'' maps the line spanned by ''v'' into itself. Then ''B'' acts on that line through its quotient group ''T'', by some element λ of the weight lattice ''X''(''T''). Chevalley showed that every irreducible representation of ''G'' has a unique highest weight vector up to scalars; the corresponding \"highest weight\" λ is dominant; and every dominant weight λ is the highest weight of a unique irreducible representation ''L''(λ) of ''G'', up to isomorphism.<ref>Milne (2017), Theorem 22.2.</ref>\n\nThere remains the problem of describing the irreducible representation with given highest weight. For ''k'' of characteristic zero, there are essentially complete answers. For a dominant weight λ, define the '''Schur module''' ∇(λ) as the ''k''-vector space of sections of the ''G''-equivariant [[invertible sheaf|line bundle]] on the flag manifold ''G''/''B'' associated to λ; this is a representation of ''G''. For ''k'' of characteristic zero, the [[Borel–Weil theorem]] says that the irreducible representation ''L''(λ) is isomorphic to the Schur module ∇(λ). Furthermore, the [[Weyl character formula]] gives the [[character theory|character]] (and in particular the dimension) of this representation.\n\nFor a split reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' of positive characteristic, the situation is far more subtle, because representations of ''G'' are typically not direct sums of irreducibles. For a dominant weight λ, the irreducible representation ''L''(λ) is the unique simple submodule (the [[socle (mathematics)|socle]]) of the Schur module ∇(λ), but it need not be equal to the Schur module. The dimension and character of the Schur module are given by the Weyl character formula (as in characteristic zero), by [[George Kempf]].<ref>Jantzen (2003), Proposition II.4.5 and Corollary II.5.11.</ref> The dimensions and characters of the irreducible representations ''L''(λ) are in general unknown, although a large body of theory has been developed to analyze these representations. One important result is that the dimension and character of ''L''(λ) are known when the characteristic ''p'' of ''k'' is much bigger than the [[Coxeter number]] of ''G'', by [[Henning Haahr Andersen|Henning Andersen]], [[Jens Carsten Jantzen|Jens Jantzen]], and Wolfgang Soergel (proving [[George Lusztig|Lusztig]]'s conjecture in that case). Their character formula for ''p'' large is based on the [[Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial]]s, which are combinatorially complex.<ref>Jantzen (2003), section II.8.22.</ref> For any prime ''p'', Simon Riche and [[Geordie Williamson]] conjectured the irreducible characters of a reductive group in terms of the ''p''-Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which are even more complex, but at least are computable.<ref>Riche & Williamson (2018), section 1.8.</ref>\n\n==Non-split reductive groups==\nAs discussed above, the classification of split reductive groups is the same over any field. By contrast, the classification of arbitrary reductive groups can be hard, depending on the base field. Some examples among the [[classical group]]s are:\n*Every nondegenerate quadratic form ''q'' over a field ''k'' determines a reductive group G = ''SO''(''q''). Here ''G'' is simple if ''q'' has dimension ''n'' at least 3, since <math>G_{\\overline k}</math> is isomorphic to ''SO''(''n'') over an algebraic closure <math>\\overline k</math>. The ''k''-rank of ''G'' is equal to the '''Witt index''' of ''q'' (the maximum dimension of an isotropic subspace over ''k'').<ref name=\"B234\">Borel (1991), section 23.4.</ref> So the simple group ''G'' is split over ''k'' if and only if ''q'' has the maximum possible Witt index, <math>\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor</math>.\n*Every [[central simple algebra]] ''A'' over ''k'' determines a reductive group ''G'' = ''SL''(1,''A''), the kernel of the [[reduced norm]] on the [[group of units]] ''A''* (as an algebraic group over ''k''). The '''degree''' of ''A'' means the square root of the dimension of ''A'' as a ''k''-vector space. Here ''G'' is simple if ''A'' has degree ''n'' at least 2, since <math>G_{\\overline k}</math> is isomorphic to ''SL''(''n'') over <math>\\overline k</math>. If ''A'' has index ''r'' (meaning that ''A'' is isomorphic to the matrix algebra ''M''<sub>''n''/''r''</sub>(''D'') for a [[division algebra]] ''D'' of degree ''r'' over ''k''), then the ''k''-rank of ''G'' is (''n''/''r'') − 1.<ref>Borel (1991), section 23.2.</ref> So the simple group ''G'' is split over ''k'' if and only if ''A'' is a matrix algebra over ''k''.\n\nAs a result, the problem of classifying reductive groups over ''k'' essentially includes the problem of classifying all quadratic forms over ''k'' or all central simple algebras over ''k''. These problems are easy for ''k'' algebraically closed, and they are understood for some other fields such as number fields, but for arbitrary fields there are many open questions.\n\nA reductive group over a field ''k'' is called '''isotropic''' if it has ''k''-rank greater than 0 (that is, if it contains a nontrivial split torus), and otherwise '''anisotropic'''. For a semisimple group ''G'' over a field ''k'', the following conditions are equivalent:\n*''G'' is isotropic (that is, ''G'' contains a copy of the multiplicative group ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> over ''k'');\n*''G'' contains a parabolic subgroup over ''k'' not equal to ''G'';\n*''G'' contains a copy of the additive group ''G''<sub>''a''</sub> over ''k''.\nFor ''k'' perfect, it is also equivalent to say that ''G''(''k'') contains a [[Linear algebraic group#Semisimple and unipotent elements|unipotent]] element other than 1.<ref>Borel & Tits (1971), Corollaire 3.8.</ref>\n\nFor a connected linear algebraic group ''G'' over a local field ''k'' of characteristic zero (such as the real numbers), the group ''G''(''k'') is [[compact space|compact]] in the classical topology (based on the topology of ''k'') if and only if ''G'' is reductive and anisotropic.<ref>Platonov & Rapinchuk (1994), Theorem 3.1.</ref> Example: the orthogonal group [[indefinite orthogonal group|''SO''(''p'',''q'')]] over '''R''' has real rank min(''p'',''q''), and so it is anisotropic if and only if ''p'' or ''q'' is zero.<ref name = \"B234\" />\n\nA reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is called '''quasi-split''' if it contains a Borel subgroup over ''k''. A split reductive group is quasi-split. If ''G'' is quasi-split over ''k'', then any two Borel subgroups of ''G'' are conjugate by some element of ''G''(''k'').<ref>Borel (1991), Theorem 20.9(i).</ref> Example: the orthogonal group ''SO''(''p'',''q'') over '''R''' is split if and only if |''p''−''q''| ≤ 1, and it is quasi-split if and only if |''p''−''q''| ≤ 2.<ref name = \"B234\" />\n\n==Structure of semisimple groups as abstract groups==\nFor a simply connected split semisimple group ''G'' over a field ''k'', [[Robert Steinberg]] gave an explicit [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of the abstract group ''G''(''k'').<ref>Steinberg (2016), Theorem 8.</ref> It is generated by copies of the additive group of ''k'' indexed by the roots of ''G'' (the root subgroups), with relations determined by the Dynkin diagram of ''G''.\n\nFor a simply connected split semisimple group ''G'' over a perfect field ''k'', Steinberg also determined the automorphism group of the abstract group ''G''(''k''). Every automorphism is the product of an [[inner automorphism]], a diagonal automorphism (meaning conjugation by a suitable <math>\\overline k</math>-point of a maximal torus), a graph automorphism (corresponding to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram), and a field automorphism (coming from an automorphism of the field ''k'').<ref>Steinberg (2016), Theorem 30.</ref>\n\nFor a ''k''-simple algebraic group ''G'', '''Tits's simplicity theorem''' says that the abstract group ''G''(''k'') is close to being simple, under mild assumptions. Namely, suppose that ''G'' is isotropic over ''k'', and suppose that the field ''k'' has at least 4 elements. Let ''G''(''k'')<sup>+</sup> be the subgroup of the abstract group ''G''(''k'') generated by ''k''-points of copies of the additive group ''G''<sub>''a''</sub> over ''k'' contained in ''G''. (By the assumption that ''G'' is isotropic over ''k'', the group ''G''(''k'')<sup>+</sup> is nontrivial, and even Zariski dense in ''G'' if ''k'' is infinite.) Then the quotient group of ''G''(''k'')<sup>+</sup> by its center is simple (as an abstract group).<ref>Tits (1964), Main Theorem; Gille (2009), Introduction.</ref> The proof uses [[Jacques Tits]]'s machinery of [[BN-pair]]s.\n\nThe exceptions for fields of order 2 or 3 are well understood. For ''k'' = '''F'''<sub>2</sub>, Tits's simplicity theorem remains valid except when ''G'' is split of type ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>2</sub>, or ''G''<sub>2</sub>, or non-split (that is, unitary) of type ''A''<sub>2</sub>. For ''k'' = '''F'''<sub>3</sub>, the theorem holds except for ''G'' of type ''A''<sub>1</sub>.<ref>Tits (1964), section 1.2.</ref>\n\nFor a ''k''-simple group ''G'', in order to understand the whole group ''G''(''k''), one can consider the '''Whitehead group''' ''W''(''k'',''G'')=''G''(''k'')/''G''(''k'')<sup>+</sup>. For ''G'' simply connected and quasi-split, the Whitehead group is trivial, and so the whole group ''G''(''k'') is simple modulo its center.<ref>Gille (2009), Théorème 6.1.</ref> More generally, the [[Kneser–Tits problem]] asks for which isotropic ''k''-simple groups the Whitehead group is trivial. In all known examples, ''W''(''k'',''G'') is abelian.\n\nFor an anisotropic ''k''-simple group ''G'', the abstract group ''G''(''k'') can be far from simple. For example, let ''D'' be a division algebra with center a ''p''-adic field ''k''. Suppose that the dimension of ''D'' over ''k'' is finite and greater than 1. Then ''G'' = ''SL''(1,''D'') is an anisotropic ''k''-simple group. As mentioned above, ''G''(''k'') is compact in the classical topology. Since it is also [[totally disconnected]], ''G''(''k'') is a [[profinite group]] (but not finite). As a result, ''G''(''k'') contains infinitely many normal subgroups of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].<ref>Platonov & Rapinchuk (1994), section 9.1.</ref>\n\n==Lattices and arithmetic groups==\nLet ''G'' be a linear algebraic group over the [[rational number]]s '''Q'''. Then ''G'' can be extended to an affine group scheme ''G'' over '''Z''', and this determines an abstract group ''G''('''Z'''). An '''[[arithmetic group]]''' means any subgroup of ''G''('''Q''') that is [[commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] with ''G''('''Z'''). (Arithmeticity of a subgroup of ''G''('''Q''') is independent of the choice of '''Z'''-structure.) For example, ''SL''(''n'','''Z''') is an arithmetic subgroup of ''SL''(''n'','''Q''').\n\nFor a Lie group ''G'', a '''[[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]]''' in ''G'' means a discrete subgroup Γ of ''G'' such that the manifold ''G''/Γ has finite volume (with respect to a ''G''-invariant measure). For example, a discrete subgroup Γ is a lattice if ''G''/Γ is compact. The [[arithmetic group#Margulis arithmeticity theorem|Margulis arithmeticity theorem]] says, in particular: for a simple Lie group ''G'' of real rank at least 2, every lattice in ''G'' is an arithmetic group.\n\n==The Galois action on the Dynkin diagram==\n{{Main article|Tits index}}\nIn seeking to classify reductive groups which need not be split, one step is the [[Tits index]], which reduces the problem to the case of anisotropic groups. This reduction generalizes several fundamental theorems in algebra. For example, [[Witt's decomposition theorem]] says that a nondegenerate quadratic form over a field is determined up to isomorphism by its Witt index together with its anisotropic kernel. Likewise, the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] reduces the classification of central simple algebras over a field to the case of division algebras. Generalizing these results, Tits showed that a reductive group over a field ''k'' is determined up to isomorphism by its Tits index together with its anisotropic kernel, an associated anisotropic semisimple ''k''-group.\n\nFor a reductive group ''G'' over a field ''k'', the [[absolute Galois group]] Gal(''k''<sub>''s''</sub>/''k'') acts (continuously) on the \"absolute\" Dynkin diagram of ''G'', that is, the Dynkin diagram of ''G'' over a [[separable closure]] ''k''<sub>s</sub> (which is also the Dynkin diagram of ''G'' over an algebraic closure <math>{\\overline k}</math>). The Tits index of ''G'' consists of the root datum of ''G''<sub>''k''<sub>''s''</sub></sub>, the Galois action on its Dynkin diagram, and a Galois-invariant subset of the vertices of the Dynkin diagram. Traditionally, the Tits index is drawn by circling the Galois orbits in the given subset.\n\nThere is a full classification of quasi-split groups in these terms. Namely, for each action of the absolute Galois group of a field ''k'' on a Dynkin diagram, there is a unique simply connected semisimple quasi-split group ''H'' over ''k'' with the given action. (For a quasi-split group, every Galois orbit in the Dynkin diagram is circled.) Moreover, any other simply connected semisimple group ''G'' over ''k'' with the given action is an [[inner form]] of the quasi-split group ''H'', meaning that ''G'' is the group associated to an element of the [[Galois cohomology]] set ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''H''/''Z''), where ''Z'' is the center of ''H''. In other words, ''G'' is the twist of ''H'' associated to some ''H''/''Z''-torsor over ''k'', as discussed in the next section.\n\nExample: Let ''q'' be a nondegenerate quadratic form of even dimension 2''n'' over a field ''k'' of characteristic not 2, with ''n'' ≥ 5. (These restrictions can be avoided.) Let ''G'' be the simple group ''SO''(''q'') over ''k''. The absolute Dynkin diagram of ''G'' is of type D<sub>''n''</sub>, and so its automorphism group is of order 2, switching the two \"legs\" of the D<sub>''n''</sub> diagram. The action of the absolute Galois group of ''k'' on the Dynkin diagram is trivial if and only if the signed [[discriminant of a quadratic form|discriminant]] ''d'' of ''q'' in ''k''*/(''k''*)<sup>2</sup> is trivial. If ''d'' is nontrivial, then it is encoded in the Galois action on the Dynkin diagram: the index-2 subgroup of the Galois group that acts as the identity is <math>\\operatorname{Gal}(k_s/k(\\sqrt{d}))\\subset \\operatorname{Gal}(k_s/k)</math>. The group ''G'' is split if and only if ''q'' has Witt index ''n'', the maximum possible, and ''G'' is quasi-split if and only if ''q'' has Witt index at least ''n'' − 1.<ref name = \"B234\" />\n\n==Torsors and the Hasse principle==\nA '''[[torsor]]''' for an affine group scheme ''G'' over a field ''k'' means an affine scheme ''X'' over ''k'' with an [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of ''G'' such that <math>X_{\\overline k}</math> is isomorphic to <math>G_{\\overline k}</math> with the action of <math>G_{\\overline k}</math> on itself by left translation. A torsor can also be viewed as a [[principal G-bundle]] over ''k'' with respect to the [[fppf topology]] on ''k'', or the [[étale topology]] if ''G'' is smooth over ''k''. The [[pointed set]] of isomorphism classes of ''G''-torsors over ''k'' is called ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''G''), in the language of Galois cohomology.\n\nTorsors arise whenever one seeks to classify '''forms''' of a given algebraic object ''Y'' over a field ''k'', meaning objects ''X'' over ''k'' which become isomorphic to ''Y'' over the algebraic closure of ''k''. Namely, such forms (up to isomorphism) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',Aut(''Y'')). For example, (nondegenerate) quadratic forms of dimension ''n'' over ''k'' are classified by ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''O''(''n'')), and central simple algebras of degree ''n'' over ''k'' are classified by ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''PGL''(''n'')). Also, ''k''-forms of a given algebraic group ''G'' (sometimes called \"twists\" of ''G'') are classified by ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',Aut(''G'')). These problems motivate the systematic study of ''G''-torsors, especially for reductive groups ''G''.\n\nWhen possible, one hopes to classify ''G''-torsors using [[cohomological invariant]]s, which are invariants taking values in Galois cohomology with ''abelian'' coefficient groups ''M'', ''H''<sup>''a''</sup>(''k'',''M''). In this direction, Steinberg proved [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]'s \"Conjecture I\": for a connected linear algebraic group ''G'' over a perfect field of [[cohomological dimension of a field|cohomological dimension]] at most 1, ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''G'') = 1.<ref>Steinberg (1965), Theorem 1.9.</ref> (The case of a finite field was known earlier, as [[Lang's theorem]].) It follows, for example, that every reductive group over a finite field is quasi-split.\n\n[[Serre's conjecture II (algebra)|Serre's Conjecture II]] predicts that for a simply connected semisimple group ''G'' over a field of cohomological dimension at most 2, ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''G'') = 1. The conjecture is known for a [[totally imaginary number field]] (which has cohomological dimension 2). More generally, for any number field ''k'', [[Martin Kneser]], [[Günter Harder]] and Vladimir Chernousov (1989) proved the [[Hasse principle]]: for a simply connected semisimple group ''G'' over ''k'', the map\n:<math>H^1(k,G)\\to \\prod_{v} H^1(k_v,G)</math>\nis bijective.<ref>Platonov & Rapinchuk (1994), Theorem 6.6.</ref> Here ''v'' runs over all [[place (mathematics)|places]] of ''k'', and ''k''<sub>''v''</sub> is the corresponding local field (possibly '''R''' or '''C'''). Moreover, the pointed set ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k''<sub>''v''</sub>,''G'') is trivial for every nonarchimidean local field ''k''<sub>''v''</sub>, and so only the real places of ''k'' matter. The analogous result for a [[global field]] ''k'' of positive characteristic was proved earlier by Harder (1975): for every simply connected semisimple group ''G'' over ''k'', ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''k'',''G'') is trivial (since ''k'' has no real places).<ref>Platonov & Rapinchuk (1994), section 6.8.</ref>\n\nIn the slightly different case of an adjoint group ''G'' over a number field ''k'', the Hasse principle holds in a weaker form: the natural map\n:<math>H^1(k,G)\\to \\prod_{v} H^1(k_v,G)</math>\nis injective.<ref>Platonov & Rapinchuk (1994), Theorem 6.4.</ref>  For ''G'' = ''PGL''(''n''), this amounts to the [[Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem]], saying that a central simple algebra over a number field is determined by its local invariants.\n\nBuilding on the Hasse principle, the classification of semisimple groups over number fields is well understood. For example, there are exactly three '''Q'''-forms of the exceptional group [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]], corresponding to the three real forms of E<sub>8</sub>.\n\n==See also==\n*The [[Group of Lie type|groups of Lie type]] are the finite simple groups constructed from simple algebraic groups over finite fields.\n*[[Generalized flag variety]], [[Bruhat decomposition]], [[Schubert variety]], [[Schubert calculus]]\n*[[Schur algebra]], [[Deligne–Lusztig theory]]\n*[[Real form (Lie theory)]]\n*[[Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]]\n*[[Langlands classification]], [[Langlands dual group]], [[Langlands program]], [[geometric Langlands program]]\n*[[Special group (algebraic group theory)|Special group]], [[essential dimension]]\n*[[Geometric invariant theory]], [[Luna's slice theorem]], [[Haboush's theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Borel|first=Armand|author-link=Armand Borel|title=Linear Algebraic Groups|edition=2nd|location=New York| publisher=[[Springer Nature]] |isbn=0-387-97370-2 | year=1991 | origyear=1969 | mr=1102012 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0941-6}}\n*{{Citation | author1-last=Borel | author1-first=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | author2-last=Tits | author2-first=Jacques | author2-link=Jacques Tits | title=Éléments unipotents et sous-groupes paraboliques de groupes réductifs.

      "text": "{{Lie groups |Representation}}{{Short description|Group representation}}In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], a '''representation of a [[Lie group]]''' is a linear action of a Lie group on a vector space. Equivalently, a representation is a smooth homomorphism of the group into the group of invertible operators on the vector space. Representations play an important role in the study of continuous [[symmetry]]. A great deal is known about such representations, a basic tool in their study being the use of the corresponding 'infinitesimal' [[representation of Lie algebras|representations of Lie algebras]]. \n\n== Finite-dimensional representations ==\n===Representations===\nLet us first discuss representations of groups acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over the field <math>\\mathbb C</math>. (Occasionally representations regarding spaces over the field of real numbers are also considered.) A '''[[group representation|representation]]''' of the [[Lie group]] ''G'', acting on an ''n''-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' over <math>\\mathbb C</math> is then a smooth [[group homomorphism]] \n:<math>\\Pi:G\\rightarrow\\operatorname{GL}(V)</math>,\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{GL}(V)</math> is the [[general linear group]] of all invertible linear transformations of <math>V</math> under their composition. Since all ''n''-dimensional spaces are isomorphic, the group <math>\\operatorname{GL}(V)</math> can be identified with the group of the invertible, complex {{nowrap|<math>n\\times n</math> matrices,}} generally {{nowrap|called <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n;\\mathbb C).</math>}} Smoothness of the map <math>\\Pi</math> can be regarded as a technicality, in that any  continuous homomorphism will automatically be smooth.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.51</ref> \n\nWe can alternatively describe a representation of a Lie group <math>G</math> as a ''linear action'' of <math>G</math> on a vector space <math>V</math>. Notationally, we would then write <math>g\\cdot v</math> in place of <math>\\Pi(g)v</math> for the way a group element <math>g\\in G</math> acts on the vector <math>v\\in V</math>.\n\nA typical example in which representations arise in physics would be the study of a linear partial differential equation having symmetry group <math>G</math>. Although the individual solutions of the equation may not be invariant under the action of <math>G</math>, the ''space'' <math>V</math> of all solutions is invariant under the action of <math>G</math>. Thus, <math>V</math> constitutes a representation of <math>G</math>. See the example of SO(3), discussed below.\n\n===Basic definitions===\nIf the homomorphism <math>\\Pi</math> is injective (i.e., a [[monomorphism]]), the representation is said to be '''faithful'''.\n\nIf a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the complex vector space ''V'' is chosen, the representation can be expressed as a homomorphism into [[general linear group]] <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n;\\mathbb C)</math>. This is known as a ''matrix representation''. Two representations of ''G'' on vector spaces ''V'', ''W'' are ''equivalent'' if they have the same matrix representations with respect to some choices of bases \nfor ''V'' and ''W''. \n\nGiven a representation <math>\\Pi:G\\rightarrow\\operatorname{GL}(V)</math>, we say that a subspace ''W'' of ''V'' is an '''invariant subspace''' if <math>\\Pi(g)w\\in W</math> for all <math>g\\in G</math> and <math>w\\in W</math>. The representation is said to be '''irreducible''' if the only invariant subspaces of ''V'' are the zero space and ''V'' itself. For certain types of Lie groups, namely compact<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 4.28</ref> and semisimple<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 10.3</ref> groups, every finite-dimensional representation decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations, a property known as complete reducibility. For such groups, a typical goal of representation theory is to classify all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the given group, up to isomorphism. (See the Classification section below.)\n\nA '''[[unitary representation]]''' on a finite-dimensional inner product space is defined in the same way, except that <math>\\Pi</math> is required to map into the group of [[unitary matrix|unitary operators]]. If ''G'' is a [[compact Lie group]], every finite-dimensional representation is equivalent to a unitary one.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 4.28</ref>\n\n===Lie algebra representations===\nEach representation of a Lie group ''G'' gives rise to a representation of its Lie algebra; this correspondence is discussed in detail in subsequent sections. See [[representation of Lie algebras]] for the Lie algebra theory.\n\n==An example: The rotation group SO(3)==\n{{see also|Representation theory of SU(2)}}\nIn quantum mechanics, the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]], <math>\\hat{H}\\psi=E\\psi</math> plays an important role. In the three-dimensional case, if <math>\\hat{H}</math> has rotational symmetry, then the space <math>V_E</math> of solutions to <math>\\hat{H}\\psi=E\\psi</math> will be invariant under the action of SO(3). Thus, <math>V_E</math> will—for each fixed value of <math>E</math>—constitute a representation of SO(3), which is typically finite dimensional. In trying to solve <math>\\hat{H}\\psi=E\\psi</math>, it helps to know what all possible finite-dimensional representations of SO(3) look like. The representation theory of SO(3) plays a key role, for example, in the mathematical analysis of the [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen atom]].\n\nEvery standard textbook on quantum mechanics contains an analysis which essentially classifies finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3), by means of its Lie algebra. (The commutation relations among the angular momentum operators are just the relations for the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3).) One subtlety of this analysis is that the representations of the group and the Lie algebra are not in one-to-one correspondence, a point that is critical in understanding the distinction between [[integer spin]] and [[half-integer spin]].\n\n===Ordinary representations===\nThe [[rotation group SO(3)]] is a compact Lie group and thus every finite-dimensional representation of SO(3) decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The group SO(3) has one irreducible representation in each odd dimension.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.7</ref> For each non-negative integer <math>k</math>, the irreducible representation of dimension <math>2k+1</math> can be realized as the space <math>V_k</math> of homogeneous [[Harmonic function|harmonic]] polynomials on <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> of degree <math>k</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 17.6</ref> Here, SO(3) acts on <math>V_k</math> in the usual way that rotations act on functions on <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>:\n:<math>(\\Pi(R)f)(x)=f(R^{-1}x)\\quad R\\in \\operatorname{SO}(3).</math>\nThe restriction to the unit sphere <math>S^2</math> of the elements of <math>V_k</math> are the [[spherical harmonics]] of degree <math>k</math>.\n\nIf, say, <math>k=1</math>, then all polynomials that are homogeneous of degree one are harmonic, and we obtain a three-dimensional space <math>V_1</math> spanned by the linear polynomials <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math>. If <math>k=2</math>, the space <math>V_2</math> is spanned by the polynomials <math>xy</math>, <math>xz</math>, <math>yz</math>, <math>x^2-y^2</math>, and <math>x^2-z^2</math>. \n\nAs noted above, the finite-dimensional representations of SO(3) arise naturally when studying the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a radial potential, such as the [[hydrogen atom]], as a reflection of the rotational symmetry of the problem. (See the role played by the spherical harmonics in the [[Hydrogen-like atom|mathematical analysis of hydrogen]].)\n\n===Projective representations===\nIf we look at the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> of SO(3), this Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{su}(2)</math> of SU(2). By the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|representation theory of <math>\\mathfrak{su}(2)</math>]], there is then one irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> in ''every'' dimension. The even-dimensional representations, however, do not correspond to representations of the ''group'' SO(3).<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 4.35</ref> These so-called \"fractional spin\" representations do, however, correspond to [[projective representation|''projective'' representations]] of SO(3). These representations arise in the quantum mechanics of particles with fractional spin, such as an electron.\n\n==Operations on representations==\nIn this section, we describe three basic operations on representations.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Section 4.3</ref> See also the [[Lie algebra representation#Basic constructions|corresponding constructions]] for representations of a Lie algebra.\n\n===Direct sums===\nIf we have two representations of a group <math>G</math>, <math>\\Pi_1:G\\rightarrow GL(V_1)</math> and <math>\\Pi_2:G\\rightarrow GL(V_2)</math>, then the '''direct sum''' would have <math>V_1\\oplus V_2</math> as the underlying vector space, with the action of the group given by\n:<math>\\Pi(g)(v_1,v_2)=(\\Pi_1(g)v_1,\\Pi_2(g)v_2),</math>\nfor all <math>v_1\\in V_1,</math> <math>v_2\\in V_2</math>, and <math>g\\in G</math>.\n\nCertain types of Lie groups—notably, compact Lie groups—have the property that ''every'' finite-dimensional representation is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible representations.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 4.28</ref> In such cases, the classification of representations reduces to the classification of irreducible representations. See [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility]].\n\n===Tensor products of representations===\n{{main|Tensor product of representations}}\nIf we have two representations of a group <math>G</math>, <math>\\Pi_1:G\\rightarrow GL(V_1)</math> and <math>\\Pi_2:G\\rightarrow GL(V_2)</math>, then the '''tensor product''' of the representations would have the [[tensor product]] vector space <math>V_1\\otimes V_2</math> as the underlying vector space, with the action of <math>G</math> uniquely determined by the assumption that\n\n:<math>\\Pi(g)(v_1\\otimes v_2)=(\\Pi_1(g)v_1)\\otimes(\\Pi_2(g)v_2)</math>\nfor all <math>v_1\\in V_1</math> and <math>v_2\\in V_2</math>. That is to say, <math>\\Pi(g)=\\Pi_1(g)\\otimes\\Pi_2(g)</math>.\n\nThe Lie algebra representation <math>\\pi</math> associated to the tensor product representation <math>\\Pi</math> is given by the formula:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Proposition 4.18</ref>\n\n:<math>\\pi(X)=\\pi_1(X)\\otimes I+I\\otimes\\pi_2(X).</math>\n\nThe tensor product of two irreducible representations is usually not irreducible; a basic problem in representation theory is then to decompose tensor products of irreducible representations as a direct sum of irreducible subspaces. This problem goes under the name of \"addition of angular momentum\" or \"[[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients|Clebsch–Gordan theory]]\" in the physics literature.\n\n===Dual representations===\n{{main|Dual representation}}\nLet <math>G</math> be a Lie group and <math>\\Pi:G\\rightarrow GL(V)</math> be a representation of G. Let <math>V^*</math> be the dual space, that is, the space of linear functionals on <math>V</math>. Then we can define a representation <math>\\Pi^*:G\\rightarrow GL(V^*)</math> by the formula\n:<math>\\Pi^*(g)=(\\Pi(g^{-1}))^\\operatorname{tr},</math>\nwhere for any operator <math>A:V\\rightarrow V</math>, the transpose operator <math>A^\\operatorname{tr}:V^*\\rightarrow V^*</math> is defined as the \"composition with <math>A</math>\" operator:\n:<math>(A^\\operatorname{tr}\\phi)(v)=\\phi(Av).</math>\n(If we work in a basis, then <math>A^{\\operatorname{tr}}</math> is just the usual matrix transpose of <math>A</math>.) The inverse in the definition of <math>\\Pi^*</math> is needed to ensure that <math>\\Pi^*</math> is actually a representation of <math>G</math>, in light of the identity <math>(AB)^\\operatorname{tr}=B^\\operatorname{tr}A^\\operatorname{tr}</math>.\n\nThe dual of an irreducible representation is always irreducible,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 4.22</ref> but may or may not be isomorphic to the original representation. In the case of the group SU(3), for example, the [[Lie algebra representation#The case of sl(3,C)|irreducible representations]] are labeled by a pair <math>(m_1,m_2)</math> of non-negative integers. The dual of the representation associated to <math>(m_1,m_2)</math> is the representation associated to <math>(m_2,m_1)</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 6, Exercise 3. See also Chapter 10, Exercise 10</ref>\n\n== Lie group versus Lie algebra representations ==\n{{main|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence}}\n===Overview===\nIn many cases, it is convenient to study representations of a Lie group by studying representations of the associated Lie algebra. In general, however, not every representation of the Lie algebra comes from a representation of the group. This fact is, for example, lying behind the distinction between [[integer spin]] and [[half-integer spin]] in quantum mechanics. On the other hand, if ''G'' is a [[Simply connected space|simply connected]] group, then a theorem<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.6</ref> says that we do, in fact, get a one-to-one correspondence between the group and Lie algebra representations.\n\nLet {{mvar|G}} be a Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, and assume that a representation <math>\\pi</math> of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is at hand. The [[Lie correspondence]] may be employed for obtaining group representations of the connected component of the {{mvar|G}}. Roughly speaking, this is effected by taking the [[matrix exponential]] of the matrices of the Lie algebra representation. A subtlety arises if {{mvar|G}} is not [[simply connected]]. This may result in [[projective representation]]s or, in physics parlance, multivalued-valued representations of {{mvar|G}}. These are actually representations of the [[universal covering group]] of {{mvar|G}}.\n\nThese results will be explained more fully below.\n\nThe Lie correspondence gives results only for the connected component of the groups, and thus the other components of the full group are treated separately by giving representatives for matrices representing these components, one for each component. These form (representatives of) the [[Homotopy group|zeroth homotopy group]] of {{mvar|G}}. For example, in the case of the four-component [[Lorentz group]], representatives of [[space inversion symmetry|space inversion]] and [[time reversal symmetry|time reversal]] must be put in [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Space inversion and time reversal|by hand]]. Further illustrations will be drawn from the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] below.\n\n===The exponential mapping===\n[[File:Sophus Lie.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Sophus Lie]], the originator of [[Lie group theory|Lie theory]]. The theory of [[manifolds]] was not discovered in Lie's time, so he worked ''locally'' with subsets of <math>\\R^n.</math> The structure would today be called a '''local group'''.]]\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, then we have the exponential map from <math>\\mathfrak g</math> to <math>G</math>, written as\n:<math>X\\mapsto e^X,\\quad X\\in\\mathfrak g.</math>\nIf <math>G</math> is a matrix Lie group, the expression <math>e^X</math> can be computed by the usual power series for the exponential. In any Lie group, there exist neighborhoods <math>U</math> of the identity in <math>G</math> and <math>V</math> of the origin in <math>\\mathfrak g</math> with the property that every <math>g</math> in <math>U</math> can be written uniquely as <math>g=e^X</math> with <math>X\\in V</math>. That is, the exponential map has a ''local'' inverse. In most groups, this is only local; that is, the exponential map is typically neither one-to-one nor onto. \n\n=== Lie algebra representations from group representations ===\nIt is always possible to pass from a representation of a Lie group {{mvar|G}} to a representation of its Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> If {{math|Π : ''G'' → GL(''V'')}} is a group representation for some vector space {{mvar|V}}, then its [[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] (differential) at the identity, or '''Lie map''', <math>\\pi : \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\text{End} V</math> is a Lie algebra representation. It is explicitly computed using<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Theorem 3.28</ref>\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\pi(X) = \\left .\\frac{d}{dt}\\Pi(e^{tX})\\right|_{t = 0}, \\quad X \\in \\mathfrak{g}.</math>|{{EquationRef|G6|G6}}}}\n\nA basic property relating <math>\\Pi</math> and <math>\\pi</math> involves the exponential map:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Theorem 3.28</ref>\n:<math>\\Pi(e^X)=e^{\\pi(X)}.</math>\n\nThe question we wish to investigate is whether every representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> arises in this way from representations of the group <math>G</math>. As we shall see, this is the case when <math>G</math> is simply connected.\n\n=== Group representations from Lie algebra representations ===\nThe main result of this section is the following:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Theorem 5.6</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': If <math>G</math> is simply connected, then every representation <math>\\pi</math> of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of <math>G</math> comes from a representation <math>\\Pi</math> of <math>G</math> itself.\nFrom this we easily deduce the following:\n:'''Corollary''': If <math>G</math> is connected but not simply connected, every representation <math>\\pi</math> of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> comes from a representation <math>\\Pi</math> of <math>\\tilde G</math>, the universal cover of <math>G</math>. If <math>\\pi</math> is irreducible, then <math>\\Pi</math> descends to a ''[[projective representation]]'' of <math>G</math>. \nA projective representation is one in which each <math>\\Pi(g),\\,g\\in G,</math> is defined only up to multiplication by a constant. In quantum physics, it is natural to allow projective representations in addition to ordinary ones, because states are really defined only up to a constant. (That is to say, if <math>\\psi</math> is a vector in the quantum Hilbert space, then <math>c\\psi</math> represents the same physical state for any constant <math>c</math>.) Every ''finite-dimensional'' projective representation of a connected Lie group <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde G</math> of <math>G</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}}, Section 16.7.3</ref> Conversely, as we will discuss below, every irreducible ordinary representation of <math>\\tilde G</math> descends to a projective representation of <math>G</math>. In the physics literature, projective representations are often described as multi-valued representations (i.e., each <math>\\Pi(g)</math> does not have a single value but a whole family of values). This phenomenon is important to the study of [[Spin-%C2%BD|fractional spin]] in quantum mechanics.\n\n[[File:Lorentz group commutative diagram 2.svg|300px|right|thumb|Here {{mvar|V}} is a finite-dimensional vector space, {{math|GL(''V'')}} is the set of all invertible linear transformations on {{mvar|V}} and <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> is its Lie algebra. The maps {{mvar|π}} and {{math|Π}} are Lie algebra and group representations respectively, and {{math|exp}} is the exponential mapping. The diagram commutes only up to a sign if {{math|Π}} is projective.]]\n\nWe now outline the proof of the main results above. Suppose <math>\\pi : \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> is a representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> on a vector space {{mvar|V}}. If there is going to be an associated Lie group representation <math>\\Pi</math>, it must satisfy the exponential relation of the previous subsection. Now, in light of the local invertibility of the exponential, we can ''define'' a map <math>\\Pi</math> from a neighborhood <math>U</math> of the identity in <math>G</math> by this relation:\n:<math>\\Pi(e^X)=e^{\\pi(X)},\\quad g=e^X\\in U.</math>\nA key question is then this: Is this locally defined map a \"local homomorphism\"? (This question would apply even in the special case where the exponential mapping is globally one-to-one and onto; in that case, <math>\\Pi</math> would be a globally defined map, but it is not obvious why <math>\\Pi</math> would be a homomorphism.) The answer to this question is yes: <math>\\Pi</math> is a local homomorphism, and this can be established using the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Proposition 5.9</ref>\n\nIf <math>G</math> is connected, then every element of <math>G</math> is at least a ''product'' of exponentials of elements of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. Thus, we can tentatively define <math>\\Pi</math> globally as follows.\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Pi(g = e^{X}) &\\equiv e^{\\pi(X)}, && X \\in \\mathfrak g, \\quad g = e^{X} \\in \\operatorname{im}(\\exp),\\\\\n\\Pi(g = g_1g_2\\cdots g_n) &\\equiv \\Pi(g_1)\\Pi(g_2)\\cdots \\Pi(g_n), && g \\notin \\operatorname{im}(\\exp), \\quad g_1 , g_2, \\ldots, g_n \\in \\operatorname{im}(\\exp).\n\\end{align}</math>|{{EquationRef|G2|G2}}}}\nNote, however, that the representation of a given group element as a product of exponentials is very far from unique, so it is very far from clear that <math>\\Pi</math> is actually well defined.\n\nTo address the question of whether <math>\\Pi</math> is well defined, we connect each group element <math>g\\in G</math> to the identity using a continuous path. It is then possible to define <math>\\Pi</math> along the path, and to show that the value of <math>\\Pi(g)</math> is unchanged under continuous deformation of the path with endpoints fixed. If <math>G</math> is simply connected, any path starting at the identity and ending at <math>g</math> can be continuously deformed into any other such path, showing that <math>\\Pi(g)</math> is fully independent of the choice of path. Given that the initial definition of <math>\\Pi</math> near the identity was a local homomorphism, it is not difficult to show that the globally defined map is also a homomorphism satisfying {{EquationNote|G2|(G2)}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Theorem 5.10</ref>\n\nIf <math>G</math> is not simply connected, we may apply the above procedure to the universal cover <math>\\tilde G</math> of <math>G</math>. Let <math>p:\\tilde G\\rightarrow G</math> be the covering map. If it should happen that the kernel of <math>\\Pi:\\tilde G\\rightarrow \\operatorname{GL}(V)</math> contains the kernel of <math>p</math>, then <math>\\Pi</math> descends to a representation of the original group <math>G</math>. Even if this is not the case, note that the kernel of <math>p</math> is a discrete normal subgroup of <math>\\tilde G</math>, which is therefore in the center of <math>\\tilde G</math>. Thus, if <math>\\pi</math> is irreducible, [[Schur's lemma]] implies that the kernel of <math>p</math> will act by scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, <math>\\Pi</math> descends to a ''projective'' representation of <math>G</math>, that is, one that is defined only modulo scalar multiples of the identity.\n\nA pictorial view of how the universal covering group contains ''all'' such homotopy classes, and a technical definition of it (as a set and as a group) is given in [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#A geometric view|geometric view]].\n\nFor example, when this is specialized to the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Fundamental group|doubly connected]] {{math|SO(3, 1)<sup>+</sup>}}, the universal covering group is <math>\\text{SL}(2,\\Complex)</math>, and whether its corresponding representation is [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Faithfulness|faithful]] decides whether {{math|Π}} is [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Projective representations|projective]].\n\n== Classification in the compact case ==\n{{main|Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group}}\nIf ''G'' is a connected [[Compact group#Compact Lie groups|compact]] Lie group, its finite-dimensional representations can be decomposed as [[direct sum of representations|direct sums]] of [[irreducible representation]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorems 4.28</ref> The irreducibles are classified by a \"theorem of the highest [[weight (representation theory)|weight]].\" We give a brief description of this theory here; for more details, see the articles on [[Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|representation theory of a connected compact Lie group]] and the parallel theory [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|classifying representations of semisimple Lie algebras]].\n\nLet ''T'' be a [[maximal torus]] in ''G''. By [[Schur's lemma]], the irreducible representations of ''T'' are one dimensional. These representations can be classified easily and are labeled by certain \"analytically integral elements\" or \"weights.\" If <math>\\Sigma</math> is an irreducible representation of ''G'', the restriction of <math>\\Sigma</math> to ''T'' will usually not be irreducible, but it will decompose as a direct sum of irreducible representations of ''T'', labeled by the associated weights. (The same weight can occur more than once.) For a fixed <math>\\Sigma</math>, one can identify one of the weights as \"highest\" and the representations are then classified by this highest weight.\n\nAn important aspect of the representation theory is the associated theory of [[Character (mathematics)|characters]]. Here, for a representation <math>\\Sigma</math> of ''G'', the character is the function\n:<math>\\chi_G:G\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}</math> \ngiven by\n:<math>\\chi_G(g)=\\operatorname{trace}(\\Sigma(g)).</math>\nTwo representations with the same character turn out to be isomorphic. Furthermore, the [[Weyl character formula]] gives a remarkable formula for the character of a representation in terms of its highest weight. Not only does this formula gives a lot of useful information about the representation, but it plays a crucial role in the proof of the theorem of the highest weight.\n\n== Unitary representations on Hilbert spaces ==\nLet ''V'' be a complex Hilbert space, which may be infinite dimensional, and let <math>U(V)</math> denote the group of unitary operators on ''V''. A '''unitary representation''' of a [[Lie group]] ''G'' on ''V'' is a [[group homomorphism]] <math>\\Pi:G\\rightarrow U(V)</math> with the property that for each fixed <math>v\\in V</math>, the map\n:<math>g\\mapsto \\Pi(g)v</math> \nis a continuous map of ''G'' into ''V''. \n\n=== Finite-dimensional unitary representations ===\nIf the Hilbert space ''V'' is finite-dimensional, there is an associated representation <math>\\pi</math> of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of <math>G</math>. If <math>G</math> is connected, then the representation <math>\\Pi</math> of <math>G</math> is unitary if and only if <math>\\pi(X)</math> is skew-self-adjoint for each <math>X\\in\\mathfrak g</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015|}} Proposition 4.8</ref>\n\nIf <math>G</math> is [[compact group|compact]], then every representation <math>\\Pi</math> of <math>G</math> on a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' is \"unitarizable,\" meaning that it is possible to choose an inner product on ''V'' so that each <math>\\Pi(g),\\, g\\in G</math> is unitary.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015|}} proof of Proposition 4.28</ref>\n\n=== Infinite-dimensional unitary representations ===\nIf the Hilbert space ''V'' is allowed to be infinite dimensional, the study of unitary representations involves a number of interesting features that are not present in the finite dimensional case. For example, the construction of an appropriate representation of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> becomes technically challenging. One setting in which the Lie algebra representation is well understood is that of [[Semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] (or reductive) Lie groups, where the associated Lie algebra representation forms a [[(g,K)-module]]. \n\nExamples of unitary representations arise in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, but also in [[Fourier analysis]] as shown in the following example. Let <math>G=\\mathbb R</math>, and let the complex Hilbert space ''V'' be <math>L^2(\\mathbb R)</math>. We define the representation <math>\\psi:\\mathbb R\\rightarrow U(L^2(\\mathbb R))</math> by\n:<math>[\\psi(a)(f)](x)=f(x-a).</math>\n\nHere are some important examples in which unitary representations of a Lie group have been analyzed. \n* The [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]] can be understood as giving a classification of the irreducible unitary representations of the [[Heisenberg group]]. \n* [[Wigner's classification]] for representations of the [[Poincaré group]] plays a major conceptual role in quantum field theory by showing how the mass and spin of particles can be understood in group-theoretic terms. \n* The [[Representation theory of SL2(R)|representation theory of SL(2,R)]] was worked out by V. Bargmann and serves as the prototype for the study of unitary representations of noncompact semisimple Lie groups.\n\n==Projective representations==\n{{main|Projective representation}}\nIn quantum physics, one is often interested in ''projective'' unitary representations of a Lie group <math>G</math>. The reason for this interest is that states of a quantum system are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space <math>\\mathbf H</math>—but with the understanding that two states differing by a constant are actually the same physical state. The symmetries of the Hilbert space are then described by unitary operators, but a unitary operator that is a multiple of the identity does not change the physical state of the system. Thus, we are interested not in ordinary unitary representations—that is, homomorphisms of <math>G</math> into the unitary group <math>U(\\mathbf H)</math>—but rather in projective unitary representations—that is, homomorphisms of <math>G</math> into the projective unitary group \n:<math>PU(\\mathbf H):=U(\\mathbf H)/\\{e^{i\\theta}I\\}.</math>\n\nTo put it differently, for a projective representation, we construct a family of unitary operators <math>\\rho(g),\\,\\, g\\in G</math>, where it is understood that changing <math>\\rho(g)</math> by a constant of absolute value 1 is counted as \"the same\" operator. The operators <math>\\rho(g)</math> are then required to satisfy the homomorphism property ''up to a constant'':\n:<math>\\rho(g)\\rho(h)=e^{i\\theta_{g,h}}\\rho(gh).</math>\n\nWe have already discussed the irreducible projective unitary representations of the rotation group SO(3) above; considering projective representations allows for fractional spin in addition to integer spin.\n\n[[Projective representation#Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: Bargmann's theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] states that for certain types of Lie groups <math>G</math>, irreducible projective unitary representations of <math>G</math> are in one-to-one correspondence with ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover of <math>G</math>. Important examples where Bargmann's theorem applies are SO(3) (as just mentioned) and the [[Poincaré group]]. The latter case is important to [[Wigner's classification]] of the projective representations of the Poincaré group, with applications to quantum field theory. \n\nOne example where Bargmann's theorem does ''not'' apply is the group <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. The set of translations in position and momentum on <math>L^2(\\mathbb R^n)</math> form a projective unitary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> but they do not come from an ordinary representation of the universal cover of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>—which is just <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> itself. In this case, to get an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the [[Heisenberg group]], which is a one-dimensional central extension of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. (See the discussion [[Projective representation#Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: The Heisenberg case|here]].)\n\n==The commutative case==\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a commutative [[Lie group]], then every irreducible unitary representation of <math>G</math> on complex vector spaces is one dimensional. (This claim follows from [[Schur's lemma]] and holds even if the representations are not assumed ahead of time to be finite dimensional.) Thus, the irreducible unitary representations of <math>G</math> are simply continuous homomorphisms of <math>G</math> into the unit circle group, U(1). For example, if <math>G=\\mathbb R</math>, the irreducible unitary representations have the form \n:<math>\\Pi(x)=[e^{iax}]</math>,\nfor some real number <math>a</math>.\n\nSee also [[Pontryagin duality]] for this case.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Compact group#Representation theory|Representation theory of connected compact groups]]\n* [[Lie algebra representation]]\n* [[Projective representation]]\n* [[Representation theory of SU(2)]]\n* [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group]]\n* [[Representation theory of Hopf algebras]]\n* [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group]]\n* [[List of Lie group topics]]\n* [[Symmetry in quantum mechanics]]\n*[[Wigner D-matrix]]\n\n== Remarks ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Fulton|first1=W.|authorlink1=William Fulton (mathematician)|last2=Harris|first2=J.|authorlink2=Joe Harris (mathematician)|year=1991|title=Representation theory.

      "title": "3D rotation group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rotation_group",
      "text": "{{Short description|Group of rotations in 3 dimensions}}In [[classical mechanics|mechanics]] and [[geometry]], the '''3D rotation group''', often denoted '''[[special orthogonal group|SO]](3)''', is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[rotation]]s about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>3</sup> under the operation of [[function composition|composition]].<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 34, Ex. 14.</ref> By definition, a rotation about the origin is a transformation that preserves the origin, [[Euclidean distance]] (so it is an [[isometry]]), and [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] (i.e. ''handedness'' of space). Every non-trivial rotation is determined by its axis of rotation (a line through the origin) and its angle of rotation.  Composing two rotations results in another rotation; every rotation has a unique [[inverse function|inverse]] rotation; and the [[identity map]] satisfies the definition of a rotation. Owing to the above properties (along composite rotations' [[associative property]]), the set of all rotations is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition. Rotations are not commutative (for example, rotating ''R'' 90° in the x-y plane followed by ''S'' 90° in the y-z plane is not the same as ''S'' followed by ''R''), making it a [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian group]]. Moreover, the rotation group has a natural structure as a [[manifold]] for which the group operations are [[smooth function|smoothly differentiable]]; so it is in fact a [[Lie group]]. It is [[compact space|compact]] and has dimension 3.\n\nRotations are [[linear transformation]]s of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> and can therefore be represented by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] once a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> has been chosen. Specifically, if we choose an [[orthonormal basis]] of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, every rotation is described by an [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal 3×3 matrix]] (i.e. a 3×3 matrix with real entries which, when multiplied by its [[transpose]], results in the [[identity matrix]]) with [[determinant]] 1. The group SO(3) can therefore be identified with the group of these matrices under [[matrix multiplication]]. These matrices are known as \"special orthogonal matrices\", explaining the notation SO(3).\n\nThe group SO(3) is used to describe the possible rotational symmetries of an object, as well as the possible orientations of an object in space. Its [[group representation|representation]]s are important in physics, where they give rise to the [[elementary particle]]s of integer [[spin (physics)|spin]].\n\n==Length and angle==\nBesides just preserving length, rotations also preserve the [[angle]]s between vectors. This follows from the fact that the standard [[dot product]] between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' can be written purely in terms of length:\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\|\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 - \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 - \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2\\right).</math>\nIt follows that any length-preserving transformation in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> preserves the dot product, and thus the angle between vectors. Rotations are often defined as linear transformations that preserve the inner product on '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, which is equivalent to requiring them to preserve length. See [[classical group]] for a treatment of this more general approach, where {{math|SO(3)}} appears as a special case.\n\n==Orthogonal and rotation matrices==\n{{Main|Orthogonal matrix|Rotation matrix}}\n\nEvery rotation maps an [[orthonormal basis]] of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} to another orthonormal basis. Like any linear transformation of [[finite-dimensional]] vector spaces, a rotation can always be represented by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. Let {{math|''R''}} be a given rotation. With respect to the [[standard basis]] {{math|'''e'''<sub>1</sub>,'''e'''<sub>2</sub>,'''e'''<sub>3</sub>}} of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} the columns of {{math|''R''}} are given by {{math|(''R'''''e'''<sub>1</sub>,&#8239;''R'''''e'''<sub>2</sub>,&#8239;''R'''''e'''<sub>3</sub>)}}. Since the standard basis is orthonormal, and since {{math|''R''}} preserves angles and length, the columns of {{math|''R''}} form another orthonormal basis. This orthonormality condition can be expressed in the form\n:<math>R^\\mathsf{T}R = RR^\\mathsf{T} = I,</math>\nwhere {{math|''R''<sup>{{sans-serif|T}}</sup>}} denotes the [[transpose]] of {{math|''R''}} and {{mvar|I}} is the {{math|3&#8239;×&#8239;3}} [[identity matrix]]. Matrices for which this property holds are called [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]]. The group of all {{math|3&#8239;×&#8239;3}} orthogonal matrices is denoted {{math|O(3)}}, and consists of all proper and improper rotations.\n\nIn addition to preserving length, proper rotations must also preserve orientation. A matrix will preserve or reverse orientation according to whether the [[determinant]] of the matrix is positive or negative. For an orthogonal matrix {{math|''R''}}, note that {{math|1=det ''R''<sup>{{sans-serif|T}}</sup> = det ''R''}} implies {{math|(det ''R'')<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}, so that {{math|det ''R'' {{=}} ±1}}. The [[subgroup]] of orthogonal matrices with determinant {{math|+1}} is called the ''special [[orthogonal group]]'', denoted {{math|SO(3)}}.\n\nThus every rotation can be represented uniquely by an orthogonal matrix with unit determinant. Moreover, since composition of rotations corresponds to [[matrix multiplication]], the rotation group is [[isomorphic]] to the special orthogonal group {{math|SO(3)}}.\n\nImproper rotations correspond to orthogonal matrices with determinant {{math|−1}}, and they do not form a group because the product of two improper rotations is a proper rotation.\n\n==Group structure==\nThe rotation group is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition]] (or equivalently the [[matrix product|product of linear transformations]]).  It is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] consisting of all [[invertible matrix|invertible]] linear transformations of the [[real coordinate space|real 3-space]] '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.<ref>''n''&#8239;×&#8239;''n'' real matrices are identical to linear transformations of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> expressed in its [[standard basis]].</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the rotation group is [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]]. That is, the order in which rotations are composed makes a difference. For example, a quarter turn around the positive ''x''-axis followed by a quarter turn around the positive ''y''-axis is a different rotation than the one obtained by first rotating around ''y'' and then ''x''.\n\nThe orthogonal group, consisting of all proper and improper rotations, is generated by reflections.  Every proper rotation is the composition of two reflections, a special case of the [[Cartan–Dieudonné theorem]].\n\n==Axis of rotation==\n{{main|Axis–angle representation}}\nEvery nontrivial proper rotation in 3 dimensions fixes a unique 1-dimensional [[linear subspace]] of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> which is called the ''axis of rotation'' (this is [[Euler's rotation theorem]]). Each such rotation acts as an ordinary 2-dimensional rotation in the plane [[orthogonal]] to this axis. Since every 2-dimensional rotation can be represented by an angle ''φ'', an arbitrary 3-dimensional rotation can be specified by an axis of rotation together with an [[angle of rotation]] about this axis. (Technically, one needs to specify an orientation for the axis and whether the rotation is taken to be [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] or [[counterclockwise]] with respect to this orientation).\n\nFor example, counterclockwise rotation about the positive ''z''-axis by angle ''φ'' is given by\n\n:<math>R_z(\\varphi) = \\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\varphi & -\\sin\\varphi & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\varphi & \\cos\\varphi & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nGiven a [[unit vector]] '''n''' in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> and an angle ''φ'', let ''R''(''φ'', '''n''') represent a counterclockwise rotation about the axis through '''n''' (with orientation determined by '''n'''). Then\n* ''R''(0,'''n''') is the identity transformation for any '''n'''\n* ''R''(''φ'','''n''') = ''R''(−''φ'',−'''n''')\n* ''R''({{pi}} + ''φ'','''n''') = ''R''({{pi}} − ''φ'',−'''n''').\n\nUsing these properties one can show that any rotation can be represented by a unique angle ''φ'' in the range 0 ≤ φ ≤ {{pi}} and a unit vector '''n''' such that\n* '''n''' is arbitrary if ''φ'' = 0\n* '''n''' is unique if 0 < ''φ'' < {{pi}}\n* '''n''' is unique up to a [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] if ''φ'' = {{pi}} (that is, the rotations ''R''({{pi}},&#8239;±'''n''') are identical).\nIn the next section, this representation of rotations is used to identify SO(3) topologically with three-dimensional real projective space.\n\n==Topology==\n{{Main|Hypersphere of rotations}}\nThe Lie group SO(3) is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 1.17</ref>\n\nConsider the solid ball in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> of radius {{pi}} (that is, all points of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> of distance {{pi}} or less from the origin). Given the above, for every point in this ball there is a rotation, with axis through the point and the origin, and rotation angle equal to the distance of the point from the origin. The identity rotation corresponds to the point at the center of the ball. Rotation through angles between 0 and −{{pi}} correspond to the point on the same axis and distance from the origin but on the opposite side of the origin. The one remaining issue is that the two rotations through {{pi}} and through −{{pi}} are the same. So we [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] (or \"glue together\") [[antipodal point]]s on the surface of the ball. After this identification, we arrive at a [[topological space]] [[homeomorphic]] to the rotation group.\n\nIndeed, the ball with antipodal surface points identified is a [[smooth manifold]], and this manifold is  [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the rotation group. It is also diffeomorphic to the [[real projective space|real 3-dimensional projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>3</sup>, so the latter can also serve as a topological model for the rotation group.\n\nThese identifications illustrate that SO(3) is [[connectedness|connected]] but not [[simply connected]]. As to the latter, in the ball with antipodal surface points identified, consider the path running from the \"north pole\" straight through the interior down to the south pole. This is a closed loop, since the north pole and the south pole are identified. This loop cannot be shrunk to a point, since no matter how you deform the loop, the start and end point have to remain antipodal, or else the loop will \"break open\". In terms of rotations, this loop represents a continuous sequence of rotations about the ''z''-axis starting and ending at the identity rotation (i.e. a series of rotation through an angle ''φ'' where ''φ'' runs from 0 to [[turn (geometry)|2{{pi}}]]).\n\nSurprisingly, if you run through the path twice, i.e., run from north pole down to south pole, jump back to the north pole (using the fact that north and south poles are identified), and then again run from north pole down to south pole, so that ''φ'' runs from 0 to 4{{pi}}, you get a closed loop which ''can'' be shrunk to a single point: first move the paths continuously to the ball's surface, still connecting north pole to south pole twice. The second half of the path can then be mirrored over to the antipodal side without changing the path at all. Now we have an ordinary closed loop on the surface of the ball, connecting the north pole to itself along a great circle. This circle can be shrunk to the north pole without problems. The [[plate trick]] and similar tricks demonstrate this practically.\n\nThe same argument can be performed in general, and it shows that the [[fundamental group]] of SO(3) is [[cyclic group]] of order 2. In [[physics]] applications, the non-triviality of the fundamental group allows for the existence of objects known as [[spinor]]s, and is an important tool in the development of the [[spin-statistics theorem]].\n\nThe [[universal cover]] of SO(3) is a [[Lie group]] called [[spinor group|Spin(3)]]. The group Spin(3) is isomorphic to the [[special unitary group]] SU(2); it is also diffeomorphic to the unit [[3-sphere]] ''S''<sup>3</sup> and can be understood as the group of [[versor]]s ([[quaternion]]s with [[absolute value]] 1). The connection between quaternions and rotations, commonly exploited in [[computer graphics]], is explained in [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s. The map from ''S''<sup>3</sup> onto SO(3) that identifies antipodal points of ''S''<sup>3</sup> is a [[surjective]] [[homomorphism]] of Lie groups, with [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] {±1}. Topologically, this map is a two-to-one [[covering map]]. (See the [[plate trick]].)\n\n==Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)==\nIn this section, we give two different constructions of a two-to-one and [[onto]] [[homomorphism]] of SU(2) onto SO(3).\n\n===Using quaternions of unit norm ===\n{{main|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\nThe group {{math|SU(2)}} is [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[quaternion]]s of unit norm via a map given by\n:<math>q = a\\mathbf{1} + b\\mathbf{i} + c\\mathbf{j} + d\\mathbf{k} = \\alpha + j\\beta \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha & -\\overline \\beta \\\\ \\beta & \\overline \\alpha\\end{bmatrix} = U, \\quad q \\in \\mathbb{H},\\quad a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\quad \\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C},\\quad U \\in \\mathrm{SU}(2).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} p. 95.</ref> \nLet us now identify <math>\\mathbb R^3</math> with the span of <math>\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}</math>.

The proper sign for {{math|sin ''θ''}} is implied, once the signs of the axis components are fixed.

By composing this action with {{math|''S''}} one obtains a transformation {{math|''S'' ∘ Π<sub>''s''</sub>(''g'') ∘ ''S''<sup>−1</sup>}} of {{mvar|M}},\n:<math>\\zeta=P' \\quad\\mapsto\\quad P \\quad\\mapsto\\quad \\Pi_s(g)P = gP \\quad\\mapsto\\quad S(gP) \\equiv \\Pi_u(g)\\zeta = \\zeta'.</math>\nThus {{math|Π<sub>''u''</sub>(''g'')}} is a transformation of {{math|ℂ}} associated to the transformation {{math|Π<sub>''s''</sub>(''g'')}} of {{math|ℝ<sup>3</sup>}}.\n\nIt turns out that {{math|''g'' ∈ SO(3)}} represented in this way by {{math|Π<sub>''u''</sub>(''g'')}} can be expressed as a matrix {{math|Π<sub>''u''</sub>(''g'') ∈ SU(2)}} (where the notation is recycled to use the same name for the matrix as for the transformation of {{math|ℂ}} it represents). To identify this matrix, consider first a rotation {{math|''g''<sub>''φ''</sub>}} about the {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} through an angle {{mvar|''φ''}},\n:<math>\\begin{align}x' &= x\\cos \\varphi - y \\sin \\varphi,\\\\\n                   y' &= x\\sin \\varphi + y \\cos \\varphi,\\\\\n                   z' &= z.\\end{align}</math>\nHence\n:<math>\\zeta' = \\frac{x' + iy'}{\\frac{1}{2} - z'} = \\frac{e^{i\\varphi}(x + iy)}{\\frac{1}{2} - z} = e^{i\\varphi}\\zeta = \\frac{e^{\\frac{i\\varphi}{2}} \\zeta  + 0 }{0 \\zeta + e^{-\\frac{i\\varphi}{2}}},</math>\nwhich, unsurprisingly, is a rotation in the complex plane. In an analogous way, if {{math|''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>}} is a rotation about the {{nowrap|{{math|''x''}}-axis}} through and angle {{mvar|θ}}, then\n:<math>w' = e^{i\\theta}w, \\quad w = \\frac{y + iz}{\\frac{1}{2} - x},</math>\nwhich, after a little algebra, becomes\n:<math>\\zeta' = \\frac{\\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\zeta +i\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} }{i \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\zeta + \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}}.</math>\nThese two rotations, {{math|''g''<sub>''φ''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>}}, thus correspond to [[bilinear transform]]s of {{math|ℝ<sup>2</sup> ≃ ℂ ≃ ''M''}}, namely, they are examples of [[Möbius transformation]]s.\n\nA general Möbius transformation is given by\n:<math>\\zeta' = \\frac{\\alpha \\zeta + \\beta}{\\gamma \\zeta + \\delta}, \\quad \\alpha\\delta - \\beta\\gamma \\ne 0.</math>.\nThe rotations, {{math|''g''<sub>''φ''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>}} generate all of {{math|SO(3)}} and the composition rules of the Möbius transformations show that any composition of {{math|''g''<sub>''φ''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>}} translates to the corresponding composition of Möbius transformations. The Möbius transformations can be represented by matrices\n:<math>\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\alpha & \\beta\\\\ \\gamma & \\delta\\end{matrix}\\right), \\quad \\quad \\alpha\\delta - \\beta\\gamma = 1,</math>\nsince a common factor of {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} cancels.\n\nFor the same reason, the matrix is ''not'' uniquely defined since multiplication by {{math|−''I''}} has no effect on either the determinant or the Möbius transformation. The composition law of Möbius transformations follow that of the corresponding matrices. The conclusion is that each Möbius transformation corresponds to two matrices {{math|''g'', −''g'' ∈ SL(2, ℂ)}}.\n\nUsing this correspondence one may write\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\Pi_u(g_\\varphi) &= \\Pi_u\\left[\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n\\cos \\varphi & -\\sin \\varphi & 0\\\\\n\\sin \\varphi & \\cos \\varphi & 0\\\\\n0            &            0 & 1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)\\right] = \\pm\n\n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\ne^{i\\frac{\\varphi}{2}} & 0\\\\\n0 & e^{-i\\frac{\\varphi}{2}}\n\\end{matrix}\\right),\\\\\n\n\\Pi_u(g_\\theta) &= \\Pi_u\\left[\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1            &           0 & 0\\\\\n0 & \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta\\\\\n0 & \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{matrix}\\right)\\right] = \\pm\n\n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} & i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\\\\ni\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} & \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}\n\\end{matrix}\\right).\\end{align}</math>\nThese matrices are unitary and thus  {{math|Π<sub>''u''</sub>(SO(3)) ⊂ SU(2) ⊂ SL(2, ℂ)}}. In terms of [[Euler angles]]<ref group=nb>This is effected by first applying a rotation {{math|''g''<sub>''φ''</sub>}} through {{mvar|''φ''}} about the {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} to take the {{nowrap|{{math|''x''}}-axis}} to the line {{math|''L''}}, the intersection between the planes {{math|''xy''}} and {{math|''x´y´''}}, the latter being the rotated {{nowrap|{{math|''xy''}}-plane}}. Then rotate with {{math|''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>}} through {{mvar|θ}} about {{math|''L''}} to obtain the new {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} from the old one, and finally rotate by {{math|''g''<sub>''ψ''</sub>}} through an angle {{mvar|ψ}} about the ''new'' {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}}, where {{mvar|ψ}} is the angle between {{mvar|L}} and the new {{nowrap|{{math|''x''}}-axis}}. In the equation, {{math|''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>}} and {{math|''g''<sub>''ψ''</sub>}} are expressed in a temporary ''rotated basis'' at each step, which is seen from their simple form. To transform these back to the original basis, observe that {{math|'''g'''<sub>''θ''</sub> {{=}}''g''<sub>''φ''</sub>''g''<sub>''θ''</sub>''g''<sub>''φ''</sub><sup>−1</sup>}}.

By taking [[Kronecker product]]s of  {{mvar|''D''<sup>1/2</sup>}} with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations  {{mvar|''D<sup>j</sup>''}}. That is, the resulting generators for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions, for arbitrarily large {{mvar|j}}, can be calculated using these [[spin operator]]s and [[ladder operator]]s.\n\nFor every  unitary irreducible representations {{math|''D''<sup>''j''</sup>}} there is an equivalent one, {{math|''D''<sup>−''j''−1</sup>}}. All \ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations must be non-unitary, since the group is compact.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]],  the Casimir invariant is the \"angular-momentum-squared\" operator;  integer values of spin {{mvar|j}} characterize [[boson|bosonic representation]]s, while half-integer values  [[fermion|fermionic representation]]s, respectively.  The [[Skew-Hermitian matrix|antihermitian]]  matrices used above are utilized as [[spin operator]]s, after they are multiplied by {{mvar|i}}, so they are now [[Hermitian matrix|hermitian]] (like the Pauli matrices).

The Pauli matrices abide by the physicists' convention for Lie algebras. In that convention, Lie algebra elements are multiplied by {{mvar|i}}, the exponential map (below) is defined with an extra factor of {{mvar|i}} in the exponent and the [[structure constant]]s remain the same, but the ''definition'' of them acquires a factor of {{mvar|i}}. Likewise, commutation relations acquire a factor of {{mvar|i}}. The commutation relations for the {{math|''t''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are\n:<math>[t_i, t_j] = \\varepsilon_{ijk}t_k,</math>\nwhere [[Levi-Civita symbol|{{math|''ε''<sub>''ijk''</sub>}}]] is the totally anti-symmetric symbol with {{math|''ε''<sub>123</sub> {{=}} 1}}. The isomorphism between {{math|'''so'''(3)}} and {{math|'''su'''(2)}} can be set up in several ways. For later convenience, {{math|'''so'''(3)}} and {{math|'''su'''(2)}} are identified by mapping\n:<math>L_x \\leftrightarrow t_1, \\quad L_y \\leftrightarrow t_2, \\quad L_z \\leftrightarrow t_3,</math>\nand extending by linearity.\n\n==Exponential map==\nThe exponential map for {{math|SO(3)}}, is, since {{math|SO(3)}} is a matrix Lie group, defined using the standard [[matrix exponential]] series,\n:<math>\n \\exp \\colon \\mathfrak{so}(3) \\to SO(3); \\quad\n                            A \\mapsto e^A = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} A^k\n                              = I + A + \\tfrac{1}{2} A^2 + \\cdots.\n</math>\nFor any [[skew-symmetric matrix]] {{math|''A'' ∈ '''so'''(3)}},  {{math| ''e<sup>A''</sup>}} is always in {{math|SO(3)}}. The proof uses the elementary properties of the matrix exponential\n:<math>\n (e^A)^T e^A = e^{A^T} e^A = e^{A^T + A} = e^{-A+A} =e^{A-A} = e^A (e^A)^T = e^0 = I.\n</math>\nsince the matrices {{math| ''A'' }} and {{math| ''A''<sup>''T''</sup> }} commute, this can be easily proven with the skew-symmetric matrix condition. This is not enough to show that {{math|so(3)}} is the corresponding Lie algebra for {{math|SO(3)}}, and shall be proven separately.\n\nThe level of difficulty of proof depends on how a matrix group Lie algebra is defined. {{harvtxt|Hall|2003}} defines the Lie algebra as the set of matrices {{math|''A'' ∈ ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(ℝ){{!}} e<sup>''tA''</sup> ∈ SO(3) ∀''t''}}, in which case it is trivial. {{harvtxt|Rossmann|2002}} uses for a definition derivatives of smooth curve segments in {{math|SO(3)}} through the identity taken at the identity, in which case it is harder.<ref>See {{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}}, theorem 3, section 2.2.</ref>\n\nFor a fixed {{math|''A'' ≠ 0}}, {{math|''e''<sup>''tA''</sup>, −∞ < ''t'' < ∞}} is a [[one-parameter subgroup]] along a [[geodesic]] in {{math|SO(3)}}. That this gives a one-parameter subgroup follows directly from properties of the exponential map.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} Section 1.1.</ref>\n\nThe exponential map provides a [[diffeomorphism]] between a neighborhood of the origin in the {{math|'''so'''(3)}} and a neighborhood of the identity in the {{math|SO(3)}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2003}} Theorem 2.27.</ref> For a proof, see [[Closed subgroup theorem]].\n\nThe exponential map is [[surjective]]. This follows from the fact that every {{math|''R'' ∈ SO(3)}}, since every rotation leaves an axis fixed ([[Euler's rotation theorem]]), and is conjugate to a [[block diagonal matrix]] of the form\n:<math>D=\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta & 0\\\\\n                     \\sin \\theta &  \\cos \\theta & 0\\\\\n                               0 &            0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right) = e^{\\theta L_z},</math>\nsuch that {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''BDB''<sup>−1</sup>}}, and that \n:<math>Be^{\\theta L_z}B^{-1} = e^{B\\theta L_zB^{-1}},</math>\ntogether with the fact that {{math|'''so'''(3)}} is closed under the [[Adjoint representation|adjoint action]] of {{math|SO(3)}}, meaning that {{math|''BθL<sub>z</sub>B''<sup>−1</sup> ∈ '''so'''(3)}}.\n\nThus, e.g., it is easy to check the popular identity  \n:<math>e^{-\\pi L_x/2}   ~e^{\\theta L_z}~e^{\\pi L_x/2}=e^{\\theta L_y} ~.</math>\n\nAs shown above, every element {{math|''A'' ∈ '''so'''(3)}} is associated with a vector {{math|'''''ω''''' {{=}} ''θ'' '''''u'''''}}, where {{math|'''''u''''' {{=}} (''x'',''y'',''z'')}} is a unit magnitude vector. Since {{math|'''''u'''''}} is in the null space of {{mvar|A}}, if one now rotates to a new basis, through some other orthogonal matrix {{math|''O''}},  with  {{math|'''u'''}} as the {{mvar|z}} axis, the final column and row of the rotation matrix in the new basis will be zero.\n\nThus, we know in advance from the formula for the exponential that {{math|exp(''OAO''<sup>T</sup>)}} must leave {{math|'''''u'''''}} fixed. It is mathematically impossible to supply a straightforward formula for such a basis as a function of {{math|'''''u'''''}}, because its existence would violate the [[hairy ball theorem]]; but direct exponentiation is possible, and [[Axis–angle representation#Exponential map from so(3) to SO(3)|yields]]\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\exp( \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}} )\n &{}= \\exp( \\theta ~(\\boldsymbol{u\\cdot L}) )\n    = \\exp \\left( \\theta \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -z & y \\\\ z & 0 & -x \\\\ -y & x & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)\\\\[4pt]\n &{}= \\boldsymbol{I} + 2cs~(\\boldsymbol{u\\cdot L}) + 2s^2 ~(\\boldsymbol{u\\cdot L} )^2 \\\\[4pt]\n &{}= \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 (x^2 - 1) s^2 + 1 & 2 x y s^2 - 2 z c s & 2 x z s^2 + 2 y c s \\\\\n    2 x y s^2 + 2 z c s & 2 (y^2 - 1) s^2 + 1 & 2 y z s^2 - 2 x c s \\\\\n    2 x z s^2 - 2 y c s & 2 y z s^2 + 2 x c s & 2 (z^2 - 1) s^2 + 1\n  \\end{bmatrix} ,\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere {{math|''c'' {{=}} cos{{frac|''θ''|2}}, ''s'' {{=}} sin{{frac|''θ''|2}}}}.

An actual \"differential rotation\", or ''infinitesimal rotation matrix'' has the form\n:<math> I + A \\, d\\theta ~,</math>\nwhere {{math|''dθ''}} is vanishingly small and {{math|''A'' ∈ '''so'''(3)}}.\n\nThese matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals .<ref>{{Harv|Goldstein|Poole|Safko|2002|loc=§4.8}}</ref> To understand what this means, one considers\n:<math> dA_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -d\\theta \\\\ 0 & d\\theta & 1 \\end{bmatrix}~ . </math>\nFirst, test the orthogonality condition, {{math|''Q<sup>T</sup>Q'' {{=}} ''I''}}. The product is\n:<math> dA_{\\mathbf{x}}^T \\, dA_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1+d\\theta^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1+d\\theta^2 \\end{bmatrix} , </math>\ndiffering from an identity matrix by second order infinitesimals, discarded here. So, to first order, an infinitesimal rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix.\n\nNext, examine the square of the matrix,\n:<math> dA_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1-d\\theta^2 & -2d\\theta \\\\ 0 & 2\\,d\\theta & 1-d\\theta^2 \\end{bmatrix}~. </math>\nAgain discarding second order effects, note that the angle simply doubles. This hints at the most essential difference in behavior, which we can exhibit with the assistance of a second infinitesimal rotation,\n:<math> dA_{\\mathbf{y}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & d\\varphi \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -d\\varphi & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} . </math>\n\nCompare the products {{math|''dA''<sub>'''x'''</sub>&nbsp;''dA''<sub>'''y'''</sub>}} to {{math|''dA''<sub>'''y'''</sub>''dA''<sub>'''x'''</sub>}},\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n dA_{\\mathbf{x}}\\,dA_{\\mathbf{y}} &{}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & d\\varphi \\\\ d\\theta\\,d\\varphi & 1 & -d\\theta \\\\ -d\\varphi & d\\theta & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n dA_{\\mathbf{y}}\\,dA_{\\mathbf{x}} &{}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & d\\theta\\,d\\varphi & d\\varphi \\\\ 0 & 1 & -d\\theta \\\\ -d\\varphi & d\\theta & 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\nSince <math>d\\theta \\, d\\varphi</math> is second-order, we discard it: thus, to first order, multiplication of infinitesimal rotation matrices is ''commutative''. In fact,\n:<math> dA_{\\mathbf{x}}\\,dA_{\\mathbf{y}} = dA_{\\mathbf{y}}\\,dA_{\\mathbf{x}} , \\,\\!</math>\nagain to first order. In other words, '''the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant'''.\n\nThis useful fact makes, for example, derivation of rigid body rotation relatively simple. But one must always be careful to distinguish (the first order treatment of) these infinitesimal rotation matrices from both finite rotation matrices and from Lie algebra elements. When contrasting the behavior of finite rotation matrices in the BCH formula above with that of infinitesimal rotation matrices, where all the commutator terms will be second order infinitesimals one finds a bona fide vector space. Technically, this dismissal of any second order terms amounts to [[Group contraction]].\n\n==Realizations of rotations==\n{{Main|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions}}\n{{see also|Charts on SO(3) }}\n\nWe have seen that there are a variety of ways to represent rotations:\n* as orthogonal matrices with determinant 1,\n* by axis and rotation angle\n* in [[quaternion]] algebra with [[versor]]s and the map [[3-sphere]] ''S''<sup>3</sup> → SO(3) (see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s)\n* in [[geometric algebra]] as a [[Rotor (mathematics)|rotor]]\n* as a sequence of three rotations about three fixed axes; see [[Euler angle]]s.\n\n== Spherical harmonics ==\n{{Main|Spherical harmonics}}\nSee also [[Representation of a Lie group#An example: The rotation group SO.283.29|Representations of SO(3)]]\n\nThe group {{math|SO(3)}} of three-dimensional Euclidean rotations has an infinite-dimensional representation on the Hilbert space\n\n:<math> L^2 (\\mathbf{S}^2) = \\operatorname{span} \\left \\{ Y^\\ell_m, \\ell \\in \\mathbf{N}^+, -\\ell \\leqslant m \\leqslant \\ell \\right \\},</math>\n\nwhere <math>Y^\\ell_m</math> are [[spherical harmonics]].

The group of all proper and improper rotations in ''n'' dimensions is called the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n''), and the subgroup of proper rotations is called the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n''), which is a [[Lie group]] of dimension {{nowrap|''n''(''n'' − 1)/2}}.\n\nIn [[special relativity]], one works in a 4-dimensional vector space, known as [[Minkowski space]] rather than 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Unlike Euclidean space, Minkowski space has an inner product with an indefinite [[metric signature|signature]]. However, one can still define ''generalized rotations'' which preserve this inner product. Such generalized rotations are known as [[Lorentz transformation]]s and the group of all such transformations is called the [[Lorentz group]].\n\nThe rotation group SO(3) can be described as a subgroup of [[SE(3)|E<sup>+</sup>(3)]], the [[Euclidean group]] of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]] of Euclidean '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. This larger group is the group of all motions of a [[rigid body]]: each of these is a combination of a rotation about an arbitrary axis and a translation along the axis, or put differently, a combination of an element of SO(3) and an arbitrary translation.\n\nIn general, the rotation group of an object is the [[symmetry group]] within the group of direct isometries; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries.

Each [[Jordan curve]] not passing through ''p'' divides the Riemann sphere into two pieces, and we call the piece containing ''p'' the \"exterior\" of the curve, and the other piece its \"interior\". Suppose there are 2''g'' disjoint [[Jordan curve]]s ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''A''<sub>''g''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''g''</sub> in the Riemann sphere with disjoint interiors. If there are [[Möbius transformation]]s ''T''<sub>''i''</sub> taking the outside of ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> onto the inside of ''B''<sub>''i''</sub>, then the group generated by these transformations is a [[Kleinian group]]. A '''Schottky group''' is any Kleinian group that can be constructed like this.\n\n==Properties==\n\nBy work of {{harvtxt|Maskit|1967}}, a finitely generated Kleinian group is Schottky if and only if it is [[generating set of a group|finitely generated]], [[free group|free]], has nonempty domain of discontinuity, and all non-trivial elements are [[Möbius transformation#Classification|loxodromic]].\n\nA fundamental domain for the action of a Schottky group ''G'' on its regular points Ω(''G'') in the Riemann sphere is given by the exterior of the Jordan curves defining it. The corresponding quotient space Ω(''G'')/''G'' is given by joining up the Jordan curves in pairs, so is a compact Riemann surface of genus ''g''. This is the boundary of the 3-manifold given by taking the quotient (''H''∪Ω(''G''))/''G'' of 3-dimensional hyperbolic ''H'' space plus the regular set Ω(''G'') by the Schottky group ''G'', which is a handlebody of genus ''g''. Conversely any compact Riemann surface of genus ''g'' can be obtained from some Schottky group of genus ''g''.\n\n==Classical and non-classical Schottky groups==\n\nA Schottky group is called '''classical''' if all the disjoint Jordan curves corresponding to some set of generators can be chosen to be circles.  {{harvs|txt|last=Marden|year1=1974|year2=1977}} gave an indirect and non-constructive proof of the existence of non-classical Schottky groups, and {{harvtxt|Yamamoto|1991}} gave an explicit example of one. It has been shown by  {{harvtxt|Doyle|1988}} that all finitely generated classical Schottky groups have limit sets of Hausdorff dimension bounded above strictly by a universal constant less than 2. Conversely, {{harvtxt|Hou|2010}}  has proved that there exists a universal lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets of all non-classical Schottky groups.\n\n==Limit sets of Schottky groups==\n[[File:Schottky (Kleinian) group limit set in plane.png|thumb|right|Schottky (Kleinian) group limit set in plane]]\nThe [[limit set]] of a Schottky group, the complement of Ω(''G''), always has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero, but can have positive ''d''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] for ''d'' < 2. It is perfect and nowhere dense with positive logarithmic capacity.\n\nThe statement on Lebesgue measures follows for classical Schottky groups from the existence of the [[Poincaré series (modular form)|Poincaré series]]\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{P(z)=\\sum (c_iz+d_i)^{-4}.}</math>\n\n[[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] showed that the series | ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> |<sup>−4</sup> is summable over the non-identity elements of the group. In fact taking a closed disk  in the interior of the fundamental domain, its images under different group elements are disjoint and contained in a fixed disk about 0. So the sums of the areas is finite. By the changes of variables formula, the area is greater than a constant times | ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> |<sup>−4</sup>.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehner|1964|p=159}}</ref>\n\nA similar argument implies that the limit set has Lebesgue measure zero.<ref>{{harvnb|Akaza|1964}}</ref> For it is contained in the complement of union of the images of the fundamental region by group elements with word length bounded by ''n''. This is a finite union of circles so has finite area. That area is bounded above by a constant times the contribution to the Poincaré sum of elements of word length ''n'', so decreases to 0.\n\n==Schottky space==\n\nSchottky space (of some genus ''g'' ≥ 2) is the space of marked Schottky groups of genus ''g'', in other words the space of sets of ''g'' elements of PSL<sub>2</sub>('''C''') that generate a Schottky group, up to equivalence under Möbius transformations {{harv|Bers|1975}}.

It is not [[semisimple Lie algebra|semi-simple]]. In one space dimension, it can be obtained as a semi-direct sum of the Lie algebra sl(2,R) and the Heisenberg algebra; similar constructions apply to higher spatial dimensions.\n\nIt contains a [[Galilean transformation|Galilei algebra]] with central extension.\n\n:<math>[J_a,J_b]=i \\epsilon_{abc} J_c,\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>[J_a,P_b]=i \\epsilon_{abc} P_c,\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>[J_a,K_b]=i \\epsilon_{abc} K_c,\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>[P_a,P_b]=0, [K_a,K_b]=0, [K_a,P_b]=i \\delta_{ab} M,\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>[H,J_a]=0, [H,P_a]=0, [H,K_a]=i P_a.\\,\\!</math>\n\nWhere <math>J_a, P_a, K_a, H</math> are generators of rotations ([[angular momentum operator]]), spatial translations ([[momentum operator]]), Galilean boosts and [[time translation]] ([[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]]) correspondingly (Notes: <math>i</math> is the imaginary unit, <math>i^2=-1</math>.

The [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] ''M'' has an interpretation as non-relativistic [[mass]] and corresponds to the symmetry of [[Schrödinger equation]] under phase transformation (and to the conservation of probability).\n\nThere are two more generators which we shall denote by ''D'' and ''C''.

An explicit representation as time-space transformations is given by, with ''n ∈ ℤ'' and ''m ∈ ℤ+1/2''<ref>M. Henkel, J. Stat. Phys.

In addition, and in analogy with either the [[Virasoro algebra]] or the\n[[Kac-Moody algebra]], further central extensions are possible. However, a non-vanishing result only exists for the commutator\n<math>[X_n, X_{n'}]</math>, where it must be of the familiar Virasoro form, namely \n:<math> [X_n, X_{n'}]= (n-n') X_{n+n'} + {c\\over 12}(n^3-n)\\delta_{n+n',0}</math> \nor for the commutator between the rotations <math>R_n^{(jk)}</math>, where it must have a Kac-Moody form. Any other possible central extension can be absorbed into the Lie algebra generators.\n\n==The role of the Schrödinger group in mathematical physics==\n\nThough the Schrödinger group is defined as symmetry group of the free particle [[Schrödinger equation]], it is realised in some interacting non-relativistic systems (for example cold atoms at criticality).\n\nThe Schrödinger group in d spatial dimensions can be embedded into relativistic [[conformal group]] in d+1 dimensions SO(2,d+2). This embedding is connected with the fact that one can get the [[Schrödinger equation]] from the massless [[Klein–Gordon equation]] through [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein compactification]] along null-like dimensions and Bargmann lift of [[Newton–Cartan theory]]. This embedding can be also be viewed as the extension of the Schrödinger algebra to the maximal [[parabolic Lie algebra|parabolic sub-algebra]] of SO(2,d+2).\n\nThe Schrödinger group also arises as dynamical symmetry in condensed-matter applications: it is the dynamical symmetry of the\n[[Edwards-Wilkinson]] model of kinetic interface growth.<ref>M.

The [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] factors through the [[quotient group|quotient]] '''PSL(2,R)''' (the 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 [[projective special linear group]] over '''R'''). More specifically,\n:PSL(2,'''R''')&nbsp;=&nbsp;SL(2,'''R''')/{±''I''},\nwhere ''I'' denotes the 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 [[identity matrix]]. It contains the [[modular group]] PSL(2,'''Z''').\n\nAlso closely related is the 2-fold [[covering group]], Mp(2,'''R'''), a [[metaplectic group]] (thinking of SL(2,'''R''') as a [[symplectic group]]).\n\nAnother related group is SL<sup>±</sup>(2,'''R''') the group of real 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 matrices with determinant ±1; this is more commonly used in the context of the [[modular group]], however.\n\n==Descriptions==\n\nSL(2,'''R''') is the group of all [[linear transformation]]s of '''R'''<sup>2</sup> that preserve [[Orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[area (geometry)|area]]. It is [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[symplectic group]] Sp(2,'''R''') and the special unitary group [[SU(1,1)]].  It is also isomorphic to the group of unit-length [[split-quaternion|coquaternions]]. The group SL<sup>±</sup>(2,'''R''') preserves unoriented area: it may reverse orientation.\n\nThe quotient PSL(2,'''R''') has several interesting descriptions:\n* It is the group of [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-preserving [[projective transformation]]s of the [[real projective line]] {{nowrap|'''R''' ∪ {∞}.}}\n* It is the group of [[conformal map|conformal]] [[automorphism]]s of the [[unit disc]].\n* It is the group of [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-preserving [[isometry|isometries]] of the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]].\n* It is the restricted [[Lorentz group]] of three-dimensional [[Minkowski space]].  Equivalently, it is isomorphic to the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] SO<sup>+</sup>(1,2).  It follows that SL(2,'''R''') is isomorphic to the [[spin group]] Spin(2,1)<sup>+</sup>.\n\nElements of the modular group PSL(2,'''Z''') have additional interpretations, as do elements of the group SL(2,'''Z''') (as linear transforms of the torus), and these interpretations can also be viewed in light of the general theory of SL(2,'''R''').\n\n===Linear fractional transformations===\nElements of PSL(2,'''R''') act on the [[real projective line]] {{nowrap|'''R''' ∪ {∞}{{null}}}} as [[linear fractional transformation]]s:\n: <math>x \\mapsto \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}. </math>\n\nThis is analogous to the action of PSL(2,'''C''') on the [[Riemann sphere]] by [[Möbius transformation]]s. It is the restriction of the action of PSL(2,'''R''') on the [[hyperbolic plane]] to the boundary at infinity.\n\n===Möbius transformations===\nElements of PSL(2,'''R''') act on the complex plane by Möbius transformations:\n: <math>z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{ (where }a,b,c,d\\in\\mathbf{R}\\mbox{)}.</math>\n\nThis is precisely the set of Möbius transformations that preserve the [[upper half-plane]].  It follows that PSL(2,'''R''') is the group of conformal automorphisms of the upper half-plane.  By the [[Riemann mapping theorem]], it is also the group of conformal automorphisms of the unit disc.\n\nThese Möbius transformations act as the [[isometries]] of the [[Poincaré half-plane model|upper half-plane model]] of hyperbolic space, and the corresponding Möbius transformations of the disc are the hyperbolic isometries of the [[Poincaré disk model]].\n\nThe above formula can be also used to define Möbius transformations of [[dual number|dual]] and [[split-complex number|double (aka split-complex) numbers]]. The corresponding geometries are in non-trivial relations<ref name=\"raw\">{{cite book |last=Kisil |first=Vladimir V. |year=2012 |title=Geometry of Möbius transformations. Elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic actions of SL(2,R) | location=London |publisher=Imperial College Press|page=xiv+192 |isbn=978-1-84816-858-9 | mr=2977041 | doi=10.1142/p835}}</ref> to [[hyperbolic geometry|Lobachevskian geometry]].\n\n===Adjoint representation===\nThe group SL(2,'''R''') acts on its Lie algebra sl(2,'''R''') by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]] (remember that the Lie algebra elements are also 2 by 2 matrices), yielding a faithful 3-dimensional linear [[representation theory|representation]] of PSL(2,'''R''').  This can alternatively be described as the action of PSL(2,'''R''') on the space of [[quadratic forms]] on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.  The result is the following representation:\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{bmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{bmatrix}\na^2 & 2ab & b^2 \\\\\nac & ad+bc & bd \\\\\nc^2 & 2cd & d^2\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe [[Killing form]] on sl(2,'''R''') has [[metric signature|signature]] (2,1), and induces an isomorphism between PSL(2,'''R''') and the [[Lorentz group]] SO<sup>+</sup>(2,1).  This action of PSL(2,'''R''') on [[Minkowski space]] restricts to the isometric action of PSL(2,'''R''') on the [[hyperboloid model]] of the hyperbolic plane.\n\n==Classification of elements==\nThe [[eigenvalue]]s of an element ''A'' ∈ SL(2,'''R''') satisfy the [[characteristic polynomial]]\n:<math> \\lambda^2 \\,-\\, \\mathrm{tr}(A)\\,\\lambda \\,+\\, 1 \\,=\\, 0</math>\n\nand therefore\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac{\\mathrm{tr}(A) \\pm \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tr}(A)^2 - 4}}{2}. </math>\n\nThis leads to the following classification of elements, with corresponding action on the Euclidean plane:\n* If | tr(''A'') | < 2, then ''A'' is called '''elliptic,''' and is conjugate to a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]].\n* If | tr(''A'') | = 2, then ''A'' is called '''parabolic,''' and is a [[shear mapping]].\n* If | tr(''A'') | > 2, then ''A'' is called '''hyperbolic,''' and is a [[squeeze mapping]].\n\nThe names correspond to the classification of [[conic section]]s by [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]: if one defines eccentricity as half the absolute value of the trace (ε = ½ tr; dividing by 2 corrects for the effect of dimension, while absolute value corresponds to ignoring an overall factor of ±1 such as when working in PSL(2, '''R''')), then this yields: <math>\\epsilon < 1</math>, elliptic; <math>\\epsilon = 1</math>, parabolic; <math>\\epsilon > 1</math>, hyperbolic.\n\nThe identity element 1 and negative identity element -1 (in PSL(2,'''R''') they are the same), have trace ±2, and hence by this classification are parabolic elements, though they are often considered separately.\n\n[[Möbius transformation#Classification|The same classification]] is used for SL(2,'''C''') and PSL(2,'''C''') ([[Möbius transformation]]s) and PSL(2,'''R''') (real Möbius transformations), with the addition of \"loxodromic\" transformations corresponding to complex traces; [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|analogous classifications]] are used elsewhere.\n\nA subgroup that is contained with the elliptic (respectively, parabolic, hyperbolic) elements, plus the identity and negative identity, is called an '''elliptic subgroup''' (respectively, '''[[parabolic subgroup]],''' '''hyperbolic subgroup''').\n\nThis is a classification into ''subsets,'' not ''subgroups:'' these sets are not closed under multiplication (the product of two parabolic elements need not be parabolic, and so forth). However, all elements are conjugate into one of 3 standard [[one-parameter subgroup]]s (possibly times ±1), as detailed below.\n\nTopologically, as trace is a continuous map, the elliptic elements (excluding ±1) are an [[open set]], as are the hyperbolic elements (excluding ±1), while the parabolic elements (including ±1) are a [[closed set]].\n\n===Elliptic elements===\nThe [[eigenvalues]] for an elliptic element are both complex, and are [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] values on the [[unit circle]].  Such an element is conjugate to a [[rotation]] of the Euclidean plane – they can be interpreted as rotations in a possibly non-orthogonal basis – and the corresponding element of PSL(2,'''R''') acts as (conjugate to) a [[rotation]] of the hyperbolic plane and of [[Minkowski space]].\n\nElliptic elements of the [[modular group]] must have eigenvalues {ω, ω<sup>−1</sup>}, where ''ω'' is a primitive 3rd, 4th, or 6th [[root of unity]].  These are all the elements of the modular group with finite [[order (group theory)|order]], and they act on the [[torus]] as periodic diffeomorphisms.\n\nElements of trace 0 may be called \"circular elements\" (by analogy with eccentricity) but this is rarely done; they correspond to elements with eigenvalues ±''i'', and are conjugate to rotation by 90°, and square to -''I'': they are the non-identity [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]s in PSL(2).\n\nElliptic elements are conjugate into the subgroup of rotations of the Euclidean plane, the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(2); the angle of rotation is [[Arccos (trigonometry)|arccos]] of half of the trace, with the sign of the rotation determined by orientation. (A rotation and its inverse are conjugate in GL(2) but not SL(2).)\n\n===Parabolic elements===\nA parabolic element has only a single eigenvalue, which is either 1 or -1.  Such an element acts as a  [[shear mapping]] on the Euclidean plane, and the corresponding element of PSL(2,'''R''') acts as a [[limit rotation]] of the hyperbolic plane and as a [[Lorentz group#Conjugacy classes|null rotation]] of [[Minkowski space]].\n\nParabolic elements of the [[modular group]] act as [[Dehn twist]]s of the torus.\n\nParabolic elements are conjugate into the 2 component group of standard shears × ±''I'': <math>\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}1 & \\lambda \\\\ & 1\\end{smallmatrix}\\right) \\times \\{\\pm I\\}</math>. In fact, they are all conjugate (in SL(2)) to one of the four matrices <math>\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}1 & \\pm 1 \\\\ & 1\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)</math>, <math>\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}-1 & \\pm 1 \\\\ & -1\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)</math> (in GL(2) or SL<sup>±</sup>(2), the ± can be omitted, but in SL(2) it cannot).\n\n===Hyperbolic elements===\nThe [[eigenvalues]] for a hyperbolic element are both real, and are reciprocals.  Such an element acts as a [[squeeze mapping]] of the Euclidean plane, and the corresponding element of PSL(2,'''R''') acts as a [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] of the hyperbolic plane and as a [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz boost]] on [[Minkowski space]].\n\nHyperbolic elements of the [[modular group]] act as [[Anosov diffeomorphism]]s of the torus.\n\nHyperbolic elements are conjugate into the 2 component group of standard squeezes × ±''I'': <math>\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}\\lambda \\\\ & \\lambda^{-1}\\end{smallmatrix}\\right) \\times \\{\\pm I\\}</math>; the [[hyperbolic angle]] of the hyperbolic rotation is given by [[arcosh]] of half of the trace, but the sign can be positive or negative: in contrast to the elliptic case, a squeeze and its inverse are conjugate in SL₂ (by a rotation in the axes; for standard axes, a rotation by 90°).\n\n===Conjugacy classes===\nBy [[Jordan normal form]], matrices are classified up to conjugacy (in GL(''n'','''C''')) by eigenvalues and nilpotence (concretely, nilpotence means where 1s occur in the Jordan blocks). Thus elements of SL(2) are classified up to conjugacy in GL(2) (or indeed SL<sup>±</sup>(2)) by trace (since determinant is fixed, and trace and determinant determine eigenvalues), except if the eigenvalues are equal, so ±I and the parabolic elements of trace +2 and trace -2 are not conjugate (the former have no off-diagonal entries in Jordan form, while the latter do).\n\nUp to conjugacy in SL(2) (instead of GL(2)), there is an additional datum, corresponding to orientation: a clockwise and counterclockwise (elliptical) rotation are not conjugate, nor are a positive and negative shear, as detailed above; thus for absolute value of trace less than 2, there are two conjugacy classes for each trace (clockwise and counterclockwise rotations), for absolute value of the trace equal to 2 there are three conjugacy classes for each trace (positive shear, identity, negative shear), and for absolute value of the trace greater than 2 there is one conjugacy class for a given trace.\n\n==Topology and universal cover==\nAs a [[topological space]], PSL(2,'''R''') can be described as the [[unit tangent bundle]] of the hyperbolic plane.  It is a [[circle bundle]], and has a natural [[contact structure]] induced by the [[Symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] on the hyperbolic plane.  SL(2,'''R''') is a 2-fold cover of PSL(2,'''R'''), and can be thought of as the bundle of [[spinor]]s on the hyperbolic plane.\n\nThe fundamental group of SL(2,'''R''') is the infinite [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''.  The [[covering group#Universal covering group|universal covering group]], denoted <math>\\overline{\\mbox{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})}</math>, is an example of a finite-dimensional Lie group that is not a [[matrix group]].  That is, <math>\\overline{\\mbox{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})}</math> admits no [[faithful representation|faithful]], finite-dimensional [[group representation|representation]].\n\nAs a topological space, <math>\\overline{\\mbox{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})}</math> is a line bundle over the hyperbolic plane.  When imbued with a left-invariant [[Riemannian metric|metric]], the [[3-manifold]] <math>\\overline{\\mbox{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})}</math> becomes one of the [[Geometrization conjecture#The eight Thurston geometries|eight Thurston geometries]].  For example, <math>\\overline{\\mbox{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})}</math> is the universal cover of the unit tangent bundle to any [[Riemann surface|hyperbolic surface]].  Any manifold modeled on <math>\\overline{\\mbox{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})}</math> is orientable, and is a [[circle bundle]] over some 2-dimensional hyperbolic [[orbifold]] (a [[Seifert fiber space]]).\n\n[[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|thumb|376px|The [[braid group]] ''B''<sub>3</sub> is the [[universal central extension]] of the [[modular group]].]]\nUnder this covering, the preimage of the modular group PSL(2,'''Z''') is the [[braid group]] on 3 generators, ''B''<sub>3</sub>, which is the [[universal central extension]] of the modular group. These are lattices inside the relevant algebraic groups, and this corresponds algebraically to the universal covering group in topology.\n\nThe 2-fold covering group can be identified as Mp(2,'''R'''), a [[metaplectic group]], thinking of SL(2,'''R''') as the symplectic group Sp(2,'''R''').\n\nThe aforementioned groups together form a sequence:\n:<math>\\overline{\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R})} \\to \\cdots \\to \\mathrm{Mp}(2,\\mathbf{R})\n\\to \\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbf{R}).</math>\nHowever, there are other covering groups of PSL(2,'''R''') corresponding to all ''n'', as ''n'' '''Z''' < '''Z''' ≅ π<sub>1</sub> (PSL(2,'''R''')), which form a [[lattice of covering groups]] by divisibility; these cover SL(2,'''R''') if and only if ''n'' is even.\n\n==Algebraic structure==\nThe [[center (group theory)|center]] of SL(2,'''R''') is the two-element group {±1}, and the [[quotient]] PSL(2,'''R''') is [[simple group|simple]].\n\nDiscrete subgroups of PSL(2,'''R''') are called [[Fuchsian group]]s.  These are the hyperbolic analogue of the Euclidean [[wallpaper group]]s and [[Frieze group]]s.  The most famous of these is the [[modular group]] PSL(2,'''Z'''), which acts on a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by ideal triangles.\n\nThe [[circle group]] [[orthogonal group|SO(2)]] is a [[maximal compact subgroup]] of SL(2,'''R'''), and the circle SO(2)/{±1} is a maximal compact subgroup of PSL(2,'''R''').\n\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] of the discrete group PSL(2,'''R''') is much larger than '''[[integer|Z]]''', and the universal [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] is much larger than the universal covering group. However these large central extensions do not take the topology into account and are somewhat pathological.\n\n==Representation theory==\n{{main article|Representation theory of SL2(R)}}\nSL(2,'''R''') is a real, non-compact [[simple Lie group]], and is the split-real form of the complex Lie group SL(2,'''C''').  The [[Lie algebra]] of SL(2,'''R'''), denoted sl(2,'''R'''), is the algebra of all real, [[trace (linear algebra)|traceless]] 2 × 2 matrices.  It is the [[Bianchi classification|Bianchi algebra]] of type VIII.\n\nThe finite-dimensional representation theory of SL(2,'''R''') is equivalent to the [[representation theory of SU(2)]], which is the compact real form of SL(2,'''C'''). In particular, SL(2,'''R''') has no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations. This is a feature of every connected simple non-compact Lie group. For outline of proof, see [[representation theory of the Lorentz group#Non-unitarity|non-unitarity of representations]].\n\nThe infinite-dimensional representation theory of SL(2,'''R''') is quite interesting. The group has several families of unitary representations, which were worked out in detail by [[Israel Gelfand|Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark|Naimark]] (1946), [[V. Bargmann]] (1947), and [[Harish-Chandra]] (1952).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[linear group]]\n* [[special linear group]]\n* [[projective linear group]]\n* [[modular group]]\n* [[SL(2,C)|SL(2,'''C''') (Möbius transformations)]]\n* [[projective transformation]]\n* [[Fuchsian group]]\n* [[Table of Lie groups]]\n* [[Anosov flow]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Valentine|last=Bargmann|mr=0021942|title=Irreducible Unitary Representations of the Lorentz Group|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]| volume=48 |issue=3 |year=1947 |pages=568–640 |jstor=1969129 |doi=10.2307/1969129}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gelfand | first1=Israel Moiseevich| last2=Neumark |first2=Mark Aronovich |title=Unitary representations of the Lorentz group | journal=Acad.

It could be either a real or complex [[simple Lie group]] of rank 4 and dimension 28.\n\n==Spin(8)==\nLike all special orthogonal groups of <math>n > 2</math>, SO(8) is not [[simply connected]], having a [[fundamental group]] [[isomorphic]] to [[cyclic group|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>]]. The [[universal cover]] of SO(8) is the [[spin group]] '''Spin(8)'''.\n\n==Center==\nThe [[center of a group|center]] of SO(8) is '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>, the diagonal matrices {±I} (as for all SO(2''n'') with 2''n'' ≥ 4), while the center of Spin(8) is '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>&times;'''Z'''<sub>2</sub> (as for all Spin(4''n''), 4''n'' ≥ 4).\n\n==Triality==\n{{main|Triality}}\n\nSO(8) is unique among the [[simple Lie group]]s in that its [[Dynkin diagram]], {{CDD|node|3||node|split1|nodes}} ([[D4 (root system)|D<sub>4</sub>]] under the Dynkin classification), possesses a three-fold [[symmetry]]. This gives rise to peculiar feature of Spin(8) known as [[triality]]. Related to this is the fact that the two [[spinor]] [[group representation|representations]], as well as the [[fundamental representation|fundamental]] vector representation, of Spin(8) are all eight-dimensional (for all other spin groups the spinor representation is either smaller or larger than the vector representation). The triality [[automorphism]] of Spin(8) lives in the [[outer automorphism group]] of Spin(8) which is isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>3</sub> that permutes these three representations. The automorphism group acts on the center '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> x '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> (which also has automorphism group isomorphic to ''S''<sub>3</sub> which may also be considered as the [[general linear group]] over the finite field with two elements,  ''S''<sub>3</sub> ≅GL(2,2)). When one quotients Spin(8) by one central '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>, breaking this symmetry and obtaining SO(8), the remaining [[outer automorphism group]] is only '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>. The triality symmetry acts again on the further quotient SO(8)/'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nSometimes Spin(8) appears naturally in an \"enlarged\" form, as the automorphism group of Spin(8), which breaks up as a [[semidirect product]]: Aut(Spin(8)) ≅ Spin (8) ⋊ ''S''<sub>3</sub>.\n\n==Unit octonions==\nElements of SO(8) can be described with unit [[octonions]], analogously to how elements of SO(2) can be described with [[Circle group|unit complex numbers]] and elements of [[SO(4)]] can be described with [[versor|unit quaternions]]. However the relationship is more complicated, partly due to the [[non-associativity]] of the octonions. A general element in SO(8) can be described as the product of 7 left-multiplications, 7 right-multiplications and also 7 bimultiplications by unit octonions (a bimultiplication being the composition of a left-multiplication and a right-multiplication by the same octonion and is unambiguously defined due to octonions obeying the [[Moufang identities]]).\n\nIt can shown that an element of SO(8) can be constructed with bimultiplications, by first showing that pairs of reflections through the origin in 8-dimensional space correspond to pairs of bimultiplications by unit octonions. The [[triality]] automorphism of Spin(8) described below provides similar constructions with left multiplications and right multiplications.<ref name=\"ConwaySmith2003\">{{cite book|author1=John H.

A triple of maps <math>(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)</math> that preserve this identity, so that <math>x^\\alpha y^\\beta z^\\gamma=1</math> is called an [[Isotopy of loops|isotopy]]. If the three maps of an isotopy are in <math>\\operatorname{SO(8)}</math>, the isotopy is called an orthogonal isotopy. If <math>\\gamma\\in \\operatorname{SO(8)}</math>, then following the above <math>\\gamma</math> can be described as the product of bimultiplications of unit octonions, say <math>\\gamma=B_{u_1}...B_{u_n}</math>.
