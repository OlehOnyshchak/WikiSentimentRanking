He is a [[professor]] of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was Director of the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) from 1997 to 2007. He was reappointed to this office in 2013, and his term has been extended until July 31, 2022.\n\n==Biography==\nEisenbud is the son of mathematical physicist Leonard Eisenbud, student and collaborator of renowned physicist [[Eugene Wigner]] <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1BGvnTyQA</ref>. Eisenbud received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1970 from the [[University of Chicago]], where he was a student of [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and, unofficially, James Christopher Robson.  He then taught at [[Brandeis University]] from 1970 to 1997, during which time he had visiting positions at [[Harvard University]], [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (IHÉS), [[University of Bonn]], and [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS).  He joined the staff at MSRI in 1997, and took a position at Berkeley at the same time.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005 Eisenbud was President of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eisenbud, David|title=Syzygies, degrees, and choices from a life in mathematics.

He has written over 150 papers and books with over 60 co-authors.  Notable contributions include the theory of matrix factorizations for maximal [[Cohen–Macaulay module]]s over [[hypersurface]] rings, the [[Eisenbud–Goto conjecture]] on degrees of generators of [[syzygy module]]s, and the [[Buchsbaum–Eisenbud criterion]] for [[exact sequence|exactness of a complex]]. He also proposed the [[Eisenbud–Evans conjecture]] which was later settled by the [[India]]n mathematician [[Neithalath Mohan Kumar]].<ref name=\"IschebeckRao2005\">{{cite book|author1=Friedrich Ischebeck|author2=Ravi A.

Lodovico settled in [[Bologna, Italy]] and he began his career as the servant of [[Gerolamo Cardano]].  He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics.  Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for [[quadratic equations]] and [[cubic equation]]s, and was mainly responsible for the solution of [[quartic equation]]s that Cardano published. While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him.  Ferrari retired when young at 42 years old, and wealthy. He then moved back to his home town of Bologna where he lived with his widowed sister Maddalena to take up a professorship of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1565. Shortly thereafter, he died of white [[arsenic]] poisoning, according to a legend - because of his sisters.<ref name=\"ShuchatGindikin2007\">Alan Shuchat; Simon Gindikin.

He was also a [[physics|physicist]],  [[Humanism|neohumanist]], general scholar, and publisher. His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties.\n\n==Biography==\nGrassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus Günter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the [[Stettin]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], where Hermann was educated.\n\nGrassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to [[Prussia]]n universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the [[University of Berlin]], also taking classes in [[classics|classical languages]], philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or [[physics]].\n\nAlthough lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper referred to  as '''A1''' (see [[Hermann Grassmann#Citations and references|references]]).\n\nIn 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[mineralogy]] at all secondary school levels.\n\nIn 1847, he was made an \"Oberlehrer\" or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father's position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann's 1846 prize essay (see below) contained \"... commendably good material expressed in a deficient form.\" Kummer's report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann's day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics.\n\nStarting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848–49, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, ''[[Deutsche Wochenschrift für Staat, Kirche und Volksleben]]'', calling for [[German unification]] under a [[constitutional monarchy]]. (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on [[constitutional law]], Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction.\n\nGrassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Giessen]].\n\n==Mathematician==\nOne of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from [[Laplace]]'s ''Mécanique céleste'' and from [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s ''Mécanique analytique'', but expositing this theory making use of the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the ''Collected Works'' of 1894–1911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called [[linear algebra]] and the notion of a [[vector space]]. He went on to develop those methods in his '''A1''' and '''A2''' (see [[Hermann Grassmann#Bibliography|bibliography]]).\n\nIn 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece, his ''Die Lineale<!--sic--> Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik''<ref>''Tr''. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics</ref> [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics], hereinafter denoted '''A1''' and commonly referred to as the ''Ausdehnungslehre,''<ref>''Tr''. Expansion plan teachings</ref> which translates as \"theory of extension\" or \"theory of extensive magnitudes.\" Since '''A1''' proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once [[geometry]] is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial [[dimension]]s; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded.\n\nFearnley-Sander (1979)] describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:<ref>[http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/DesmondFearnleySander.pdf ''Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra'']</ref>\n\n{{cquote|The definition of a [[linear space]] ([[vector space]])... became widely known around 1920, when [[Hermann Weyl]] and others published formal definitions. In fact, such a definition had been given thirty years previously by [[Peano]], who was thoroughly acquainted with Grassmann's mathematical work. Grassmann did not put down a formal definition --- the language was not available --- but there is no doubt that he had the concept.\n\nBeginning with a collection of 'units' ''e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>3</sub>, ...'', he effectively defines the free linear space which they generate; that is to say, he considers formal linear combinations ''a<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>e<sub>2</sub> + a<sub>3</sub>e<sub>3</sub> + ...'' where the ''a<sub>j</sub>'' are real numbers, defines addition and multiplication by real numbers [in what is now the usual way] and formally proves the linear space properties for these operations. ... He then develops the theory of [[linear independence]] in a way which is astonishingly similar to the presentation one finds in modern linear algebra texts. He defines the notions of [[linear subspace|subspace]], [[linear independence]], [[Linear span|span]], [[dimension]], [[join and meet]] of subspaces, and [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]]s of elements onto subspaces.\n\n...few have come closer than Hermann Grassmann to creating, single-handedly, a new subject.}}\n\nFollowing an idea of Grassmann's father, '''A1''' also defined the [[exterior product]], also called \"combinatorial product\" (in German: ''äußeres Produkt''<ref>''Tr''. outer product</ref> or ''kombinatorisches Produkt''<ref>''Tr''. combinatorial product</ref>), the key operation of an algebra now called [[exterior algebra]]. (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann's day, the only [[axiom]]atic theory was [[Euclidean geometry]], and the general notion of an [[Algebra over a field|abstract algebra]] had yet to be defined.) In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] joined this exterior algebra to [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[quaternions]] by replacing Grassmann's rule ''e<sub>p</sub>e<sub>p</sub>'' = 0 by the rule ''e<sub>p</sub>e<sub>p</sub>'' = 1. (For [[quaternions]], we have the rule ''i''<sup>2</sup> = ''j''<sup>2</sup> = ''k''<sup>2</sup> = −1.) For more details, see [[exterior algebra]].\n\n'''A1''' was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked [[Ernst Kummer]] for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 ''Neue Theorie der Elektrodynamik''<ref>''Tr''. New theory of electrodynamics</ref> and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously.\n\nIn 1846, [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed ''analysis situs''). Grassmann's ''Geometrische Analyse geknüpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik'',<ref>''Tr.'' Geometric analysis linked to the geometric characteristics invented by Leibniz</ref> was the winning entry (also the only entry). Möbius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value.\n\nIn 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as [[Grassmann's law (optics)|Grassmann's law]]. Grassmann's work on this subject was inconsistent with that of [[Helmholtz]]. Grassmann also wrote on [[crystallography]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[mechanics]].\n\nGrassmann (1861) set out the first axiomatic presentation of arithmetic, making free use of the principle of induction. [[Peano]] and his followers cited this work freely starting around 1890. Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works in 1995 ({{ISBN|0-8126-9275-6}}. -- {{ISBN|0-8126-9276-4}}).\n\nIn 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of '''A1''', hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his [[linear algebra]]. The result, ''Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet'' [The Theory of Extension, Thoroughly and Rigorously Treated], hereinafter denoted '''A2''', fared no better than '''A1''', even though '''A2''''s manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century.\n\n==Response==\nIn 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann's ideas.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=46}} In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=46}}\n\nOne of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann's ideas during his lifetime was [[Hermann Hankel]], whose 1867 ''Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme''\n:... developed some of Hermann Grassmann's algebras and Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s. Hankel was the first to recognise the significance of Grassmann's long-neglected writings ...<ref>Hankel entry in the ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''. New York: 1970–1990</ref>\n\nIn 1872 [[Victor Schlegel]] published the first part of his ''System der Raumlehre'' which used Grassmann's approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry. [[Felix Klein]] wrote a negative review of Schlegel's book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his ''System'' according to Grassmann, this time developing higher geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his [[Erlangen Program]] which also expanded the scope of geometry.<ref>Rowe 2010</ref>\n\nComprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of [[vector space]]s which then could express the [[multilinear algebra]] of his extension theory.  To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] urged Grassmann's heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published.<ref>[[Lynde Wheeler]] (1951), ''Josiah Willard Gibbs:  The History of a Great Mind'', 1998 reprint, Woodbridge, CT:  Ox Bow, pp. 113-116.</ref>  [[A. N. Whitehead]]'s first monograph, the ''Universal Algebra'' (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the [[exterior algebra]]. With the rise of [[differential geometry]] the exterior algebra was applied to [[differential form]]s.\n\nFor an introduction to the role of Grassmann's work in contemporary [[mathematical physics]] see ''[[The Road to Reality]]''<ref>Penrose ''The Road to Reality'', chapters 11 & 2</ref> by [[Roger Penrose]].\n\n[[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant]] developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832.\n\n==Linguist==\nGrassmann's mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. Thirty years after the publication of '''A1''' the publisher wrote to Grassmann: “Your book ''Die Ausdehnungslehre'' has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library”.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=45}} Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. The last years of his life he turned to historical [[linguistics]] and the study of [[Sanskrit]]. He wrote books on [[German grammar]], collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the [[Rigveda]] (more than 1,000 pages) which earned him a membership of the [[American Orientalists' Society]]. In modern\nRigvedic studies Grassmann's work is often cited. In 1955 the third edition of his dictionary to Rigveda was issued.{{sfn|Prasolov|1994|p=46}}\n\nGrassmann also discovered a sound law of [[Indo-European languages]], which was named ''[[Grassmann's law|Grassmann's Law]]'' in his honor.\n\nThese philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime; he was elected to the [[American Oriental Society]] and in 1876, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Tübingen]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n* '''A1''': 1844.

This group has [[Growth rate (group theory)|growth]] that is faster than polynomial but slower than exponential. Grigorchuk constructed this group in a 1980 paper<ref>R. I. Grigorchuk. ''On Burnside's problem on periodic groups.'' (Russian) Funktsionalnyi Analiz i ego Prilozheniya, vol.  14 (1980), no. 1, pp. 53-54</ref> and proved that it has intermediate growth in a 1984 article.<ref name=\"g1\">R. I. Grigorchuk, ''Degrees of growth of finitely generated groups and the theory of invariant means.'' Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR. Seriya Matematicheskaya. vol. 48 (1984), no. 5, pp. 939-985</ref> This result answered a long-standing open problem posed by [[John Milnor]] in 1968 about the existence of finitely generated groups of intermediate growth. Grigorchuk's group has a number of other remarkable mathematical properties. It is a [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] infinite [[residually finite group|residually finite]] [[p-group|2-group]] (that is, every element of the group has a finite order which is a power of 2). It is also the first example of a finitely generated group that is [[amenable group|amenable]] but not [[Elementary amenable group|elementary amenable]], thus providing an answer to another long-standing problem, posed by [[Mahlon Day]] in 1957.<ref>Mahlon M. Day. ''Amenable semigroups.'' \n[[Illinois Journal of Mathematics]], vol. 1 (1957), pp. 509-544.</ref> Also Grigorchuk's group is ''\"just infinite\"'': that is, it is infinite but every proper [[quotient group|quotient]] of this group is finite.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nGrigorchuk's group is a central object in the study of the so-called branch groups and automata groups. These are finitely generated groups of automorphisms of rooted trees that are given by particularly nice recursive descriptions and that have remarkable self-similar properties. The study of branch, automata and self-similar groups has been particularly active in the 1990s and 2000s and a number of unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics have been discovered there, including [[dynamical systems]], [[differential geometry]], [[Galois theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[random walks]], [[fractal]]s, [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke algebras]],  bounded cohomology, [[functional analysis]], and others. In particular, many of these self-similar groups arise as [[iterated monodromy group]]s of complex polynomials. Important connections have been discovered between the algebraic structure of self-similar groups and the dynamical properties of the polynomials in question, including encoding their [[Julia set]]s.<ref>Volodymyr Nekrashevych. ''Self-similar groups.'' Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 117. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2005. {{isbn|0-8218-3831-8}}</ref>\n\nMuch of Grigorchuk's work in the 1990s and 2000s has been on developing the theory of branch, automata and self-similar groups and on exploring these connections.

He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. He has been described as one of [[The Martians (scientists)|The Martians]].<ref>[http://fizikaiszemle.hu/archivum/fsz9703/marsl.html A marslakók legendája - [[György Marx]] ]</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] into a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family, Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age. He obtained his B.A. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy, still at the [[Champaign-Urbana]] campus; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,<ref>The Legend of John Von Neumann. P. R. Halmos. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 80, No. 4. (Apr., 1973), pp.&nbsp;382–394.</ref> he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. [[Joseph L.

Six months later, he was working under [[John von Neumann]], which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, ''Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces'', which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Paul Halmos: Maverick Mathologist | first=Donald J. | last=Albers | journal=[[Two-Year College Mathematics Journal]] | volume=13 | number=4 | year=1982 | pages=226–242 | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | jstor=3027125 | doi=10.2307/3027125 }}</ref>\n\nHalmos taught at [[Syracuse University]], the [[University of Chicago]] (1946–60), the [[University of Michigan]] (~1961–67), the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] (1976–78), the [[University of Hawaii]], and [[Indiana University]]. From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at [[Santa Clara University]].\n\n==Accomplishments==\nIn a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 ''Algebraic Logic'', Halmos devised [[polyadic algebra]]s, an algebraic version of [[first-order logic]] differing from the better known [[cylindric algebra]]s of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in [[monadic Boolean algebra]].\n\nIn addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics.

In 1983, he received the AMS's Steele Prize for exposition.\n\nIn the ''American Scientist'' 56(4): 375–389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.\n\nHalmos's 1985 \"automathography\" ''I Want to Be a Mathematician'' is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America.  He called the book \"automathography\" rather than \"autobiography\", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life.  The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:\n\n{{quote|Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?}}\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=33%\n|quote=What does it take to be [a mathematician]? I think I know the answer: you have to be born right, you must continually strive to become perfect, you must love mathematics more than anything else, you must work at it hard and without stop, and you must never give up.\n|source= — Paul Halmos, 1985\n}}\n\nIn these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the \"iff\" notation for the words \"[[if and only if]]\" and to have been the first to use the [[tombstone (typography)|\"tombstone\"]] notation to signify the [[Q.E.D.|end of a proof]],<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Halmos\n | first = Paul\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1950\n | title = Measure Theory\n | publisher = Van Nostrand\n | location = New York\n | quote = The symbol ∎ is used throughout the entire book in place of such phrases as \"Q.E.D.\" or \"This completes the proof of the theorem\" to signal the end of a proof.\n | pages = vi\n}}</ref> and this is generally agreed to be the case.  The tombstone symbol ∎ ([[Unicode]] U+220E) is sometimes called a ''halmos''.<ref>\"The symbol is definitely not my invention&nbsp;— it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.\", Halmos (1985) p. 403.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia funded the [[Euler Book Prize]], an annual award given by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of [[Leonhard Euler]]'s birth, to [[John Derbyshire]] for his book about [[Bernhard Riemann]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]: [[Prime Obsession]].<ref name=\"maa\">[http://www.maa.org/awards/eulerbook.html The Mathematical Association of America's Euler Book Prize], retrieved 2011-02-01.</ref>\n\n==Books by Halmos==\n*1942.

Simultaneously with the [[Staatsexamen]] in 1964 in Hamburg, he received his Ph.D. (promotion) under [[Ernst Witt]] with a thesis ''Über die Galoiskohomologie der Tori''.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=21244}}</ref> Two years later he completed his [[habilitation]]. After a one-year postdoc position at [[Princeton University]] and a position as an assistant professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], he became a professor ordinarius at the University of Bonn. With the exception of a six-year stay at the former [[Bergische Universität Wuppertal|Universität-Gesamthochschule Wuppertal]], Harder remained at the University of Bonn until his retirement there in 2003 as professor emeritus. From 1995 to 2006 he was the director of the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]] in Bonn.\n\nHis research deals with arithmetic geometry, [[automorphic form]]s, [[Shimura variety|Shimura varieties]], [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motives]], and algebraic number theory. He made foundational contributions to the [[Waldspurger formula]].\n\nHe was a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], at Princeton's [[Institute for Advanced Study|Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)]] (for the academic years 1966–1967, 1972–1973, 1986–1987, autumn of 1983, autumn of 2006),<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/scholars/günter-harder Günter Harder | Institute for Advanced Study]</ref> at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (I.H.É.S.) in Paris, at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in Mumbai, and at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Harriot devised a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]] to transcribe their Carolina Algonquian language.\n\nHarriot and Manteo spent many days in one another's company; Harriot interrogated Manteo closely about life in the New World and learned much that was to the advantage of the English settlers.{{sfn|Milton|2000|p=73}} In addition, he recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:\n:\"Many things they sawe with us...as mathematical instruments, sea compasses...[and] spring clocks that seemed to goe of themselves - and many other things we had - were so strange unto them, and so farre exceeded their capacities to comprehend the reason and meanes how they should be made and done, that they thought they were rather the works of gods than men.\"{{sfn|Milton|2000|p=73}}\n\nHe made only one expedition, around 1585-86, and spent some time in the New World visiting [[Roanoke Island]] off the coast of [[North Carolina]], expanding his knowledge by improving his understanding of the [[Carolina Algonquian]] language. As the only Englishman who had learned Algonquin prior to the voyage, Harriot was vital to the success of the expedition.{{sfn|Milton|2000|p=89}} Hariot smoked [[tobacco]] before Raleigh, and may have taught him to do so.<ref name=\"ley196512\">{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy  |date=December 1965\n |title=The Healthfull Aromatick Herbe |department=For Your Information |url= |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=88–98 |type=}}</ref>\n\nHis account of the voyage, named ''A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia'', was published in 1588 (probably written a year before). The ''True Report'' contains an early account of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population encountered by the expedition; it proved very influential upon later English explorers and colonists. He wrote: \"Whereby it may be hoped, if means of good government be used, that they may in short time be brought to civility and the embracing of true religion.\"  At the same time, his views of Native Americans' industry and capacity to learn were later largely ignored in favour of the parts of the \"True Report\" about extractable minerals and resources.\n\nAs a scientific adviser during the voyage, Harriot was asked by Raleigh to find the most efficient way to stack cannonballs on the deck of the ship. His ensuing theory about the [[close-packing of spheres]] shows a striking resemblance to [[atomism]] and modern atomic theory, which he was later accused of believing. His correspondence about optics with [[Johannes Kepler]], in which he described some of his ideas, later influenced [[Kepler's conjecture]].\n\n===Later Years===\nHarriot was employed for many years by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]], with whom he resided at [[Syon House]], which was run by Henry Percy's cousin [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Thomas Percy]].\n\nHarriot's sponsors began to fall from favour: Raleigh was the first, and Harriot's other patron [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], the Earl of Northumberland, was imprisoned in 1605 in connection with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] as he was closely connected to one of the conspirators, [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Thomas Percy]].\n\nAround 1605, Harriot was imprisoned for a minimal amount of time due to the crimes involved with the Ninth Earl of Northumberland and the attempted assassination of [[King James I]] of England which was also known as the [[Gunpowder Plot|Jesuit Treason]].<ref name=\"Moran2014\" /> While this was occurring, Harriot continued his work involving mainly astronomy and in 1607, Harriot used his notes from the observations of the [[Halley's Comet]] to elaborate on his understanding of its orbit.<ref name=\"Moran2014\" /> Soon after in 1609 and 1610 respectively, Harriot turned his attention towards the physical aspects of the Moon and his observations of the first sightings of [[Sunspot|sunspots]].<ref name=\"Chapman2008\" />\n\nHarriot himself was interrogated and briefly imprisoned but was soon released. [[Walter Warner]], [[Robert Hues]], [[William Lower]], and other scientists were present around the Earl of Northumberland's mansion as they worked for him and assisted in the teaching of the family's children.<ref name=Stedall />\n\n[[Halley's Comet]] in 1607 turned Harriot's attention towards astronomy.  In early 1609 he bought a \"Dutch trunke\" (telescope), invented in 1608, and his observations were among the first uses of a telescope for astronomy. Harriot is now credited as the first astronomer to draw an astronomical object after viewing it through a telescope: he drew a map of the [[Moon]] on 26 July 1609, preceding [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by several months. By 1613 Harriot had created two maps of the whole Moon, with many identifiable features such as lunar craters depicted in their correct relative positions that were not to be improved upon for several decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7827732.stm |first=Christine |last=McGourty|title=English Galileo' maps on display|date= 14 January 2009|work=BBC}}</ref><ref name=\"VanHelden1995a\">{{Cite web |title=Thomas Harriot's Moon Drawings |last=Van Helden |first=Al |work=The Galileo Project |date=1995 |access-date=14 May 2019 |url= http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/harriot_moon.html |publisher= |quote=}}</ref> He also observed [[sunspot]]s in December 1610.<ref name=\"VanHelden1995b\">{{Cite web |title=Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) |last=Van Helden |first=Al |work=The Galileo Project |date=1995 |access-date=14 May 2019 |url= http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/harriot.html |language= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nIn 1615 or 1616, Harriot wrote to an unknown friend with medical expertise, describing what would have been the reason for the eruption of a cancerous ulcer on his lip. This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on [[Threadneedle Street]], where he died. Sources cited below are among several that describe his condition as a cancer of the nose. In either case, Harriot apparently died from [[skin cancer]]. It was suspected that Harriot's cancer diagnosis was due to excessive tobacco consumption.<ref name=\"Moran2014\" />\n\nHe died on 2 July 1621, three days after writing his will (discovered by [[Henry Stevens (bibliographer)|Henry Stevens]]).<ref name=\"Stevens1900\">{{cite book |last= Stevens |first= Henry|author-link=Henry Stevens (bibliographer) |year= 1900 |title= Thomas Hariot, the Mathematician, the Philosopher and the Scholar |publisher= Privately printed at the Chiswick press |place=London  |url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_I2Ua3f2mXooC#page/n5/mode/2up }}</ref> His executors posthumously published his ''Artis Analyticae Praxis'' on [[algebra]] in 1631; [[Nathaniel Torporley]] was the intended executor of Harriot's wishes, but Walter Warner in the end pulled the book into shape.<ref name=\"Pycior2006\">{{cite book|last=Pycior|first=Helena M. |title=Symbols, Impossible Numbers, and Geometric Entanglements: British Algebra Through the Commentaries on Newton's Universal Arithmetick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AnAcnc-yvIC&pg=PA55|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02740-3|pp=55-56}}</ref> It may be a compendium of some of his works but does not represent all that he left unpublished (more than 400 sheets of annotated writing).

This event, Telescope400,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telescope400.org.uk/|title= Telescope400 – celebrating Thomas Harriot's first ever use of the Telescope in Astronomy}}</ref> included the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Harriot by [[Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont|Lord Egremont]]. The plaque can now be seen by visitors to Syon House, the location of Harriot's historic observations. His drawing made 400 years earlier is believed to be based on the first observations of the Moon through a telescope. The event (sponsored by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]) was run as part of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] (IYA).\n\nThe original documents showing Harriot's Moon map of c. 1611, observations of Jupiter's satellites, and first observations of sunspots were on display at the [[Science Museum, London]], from 23 July 2009 until the end of the IYA.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article6725572.ece |first=Hannah|last= Devlin|title=Galileo was beaten to the Moon by a shy Englishman|newspaper= The Times|date= 24 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[observatory]] in the campus of the [[College of William & Mary]] is named in Harriot's honour. A [[Harriot (crater)|crater on the Moon]] was belatedly named after him in 1970; it is on the Moon's far side and hence unobservable from Earth.\n\nIn July 2014 the [[International Astronomical Union]] launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Harriot for this planet. (55 Cancri in the constellation Cancer). The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the [[Netherlands]]. It honors the astronomer.\n\nThe [[Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences]] at [[East Carolina University]] in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville, NC]] is named in recognition of this Harriot's scientific contributions to the New World such as his work ''A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia''.{{sfn|Milton|2000|p=73}}\n\n== Telescope and Moon Mapping ==\n[[File:Harriot_Lunar_Map.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harriot_Lunar_Map.jpg|thumb|Harriot's illustration of the Moon from 1609.]]\nOn July 26th 2009, Harriot was recognized as the first person to draw his observations of the Moon by the use of his own telescope.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last=Pumfrey |first=Stephen |date=2009 |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=163–168 |jstor=40647255 |title=Harriot's Maps of the Moon: New Interpretations |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2008.0062 }}</ref> The descriptions recorded by Harriot contained easily identifiable errors such as the discrepancy regarding which parts of the Moon were supposed to be dark and light.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Amir|date=1998|title=Lunar Maps and Coastal Outlines: Thomas Hariot's Mapping of the Moon|journal=Stud.

One of his students was [[Henri Poincaré]].\n\nHe was the first to prove that ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'', the base of [[natural logarithm]]s, is a [[transcendental number]].  His methods were used later by [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] to prove that [[pi|π]] is transcendental.\n\nIn a letter to [[Thomas Joannes Stieltjes]], Hermite remarked, \"I turn with terror and horror from this lamentable scourge of [[Weierstrass function|continuous functions with no derivatives]].\"{{Full | date = March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Hermite (crater)|Hermite crater]] near the [[Moon]]'s north pole is named in his honor.\n\n==Life==\nHermite was born in [[Dieuze]], [[Moselle]], on 24 December 1822,{{sfn|Linehan|1910}} with a deformity in his right foot that would impair his [[gait]] throughout his life. He was the sixth of seven children of Ferdinand Hermite and his wife, Madeleine [[née]] Lallemand. Ferdinand worked in the drapery business of Madeleine's family while also pursuing a career as an artist. The drapery business relocated to [[Nancy, France | Nancy]] in 1828, and so did the family.{{sfn|O'Connor|Robertson|2001}}\n\n[[File:Charles Hermite circa 1887.jpg|left|thumb|Charles Hermite circa 1887]]\nHermite obtained his [[secondary education]] at [[Nancy-Université|Collège de Nancy]] and then, in Paris, at [[Lycée Henri-IV | Collège Henri IV]] and at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]].{{sfn|Linehan|1910}} He read some of [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]'s writings on the solution of numerical equations and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s publications on [[number theory]]. \n\nHermite wanted to take his higher education at [[École Polytechnique]], a [[military academy]] renowned for excellence in mathematics, science, and engineering. Tutored by mathematician [[Eugène Charles Catalan]], Hermite devoted a year to preparing for the notoriously difficult [[educational entrance examination | entrance examination]].{{sfn|O'Connor|Robertson|2001}} In 1842 he was admitted to the school.{{sfn|Linehan|1910}} However, after one year the school would not allow Hermite to continue his studies there because of his deformed foot. He struggled to regain his admission to the school, but the administration imposed strict conditions. Hermite did not accept this, and he quit the École Polytechnique without graduating.{{sfn|O'Connor|Robertson|2001}}\n\nIn 1842, ''[[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]]'' published Hermite's first original contribution to mathematics, a simple proof of [[Niels Henrik Abel|Niels Abel]]'s proposition of concerning the impossibility of an algebraic solution to [[equation]]s of the fifth [[Degree of a polynomial | degree]].{{sfn|Linehan|1910}}\n\nA correspondence with [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], begun in 1843 and continued the next year, resulted in the insertion, in the complete edition of Jacobi's works, of two articles by Hermite, one concerning the extension to [[Abelian variety|Abelian function]]s of one of the theorems of Abel on [[elliptic functions]], and the other concerning the transformation of elliptic functions.{{sfn|Linehan|1910}}\n\nAfter spending five years working privately towards his degree, in which he befriended eminent mathematicians [[Joseph Bertrand]], Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and [[Joseph Liouville]], he took and passed the examinations for the [[baccalauréat]], which he was awarded in 1847. He married Joseph Bertrand's sister, Louise Bertrand, in 1848.{{sfn|O'Connor|Robertson|2001}}\n\nIn 1848, Hermite returned to the École Polytechnique as ''répétiteur and examinateur d'admission''. In 1856 he contracted smallpox. Through the influence of [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] and of a nun who nursed him, he resumed the practice of his [[Catholic]] faith.{{sfn|Linehan|1910}} In July 1848, he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. In 1869, he succeeded [[Jean-Marie Duhamel]] as professor of mathematics, both at the École Polytechnique, where he remained until 1876, and at the [[University of Paris]], where he remained until his death. From 1862 to 1873 he was lecturer at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. Upon his 70th birthday, he was promoted to grand officer in the French [[Legion of Honour]].{{sfn|Linehan|1910}} \n\nHermite died in [[Paris]] on 14 January 1901,{{sfn|Linehan|1910}} aged 78.\n\n==Contribution to mathematics==\nAn inspiring teacher, Hermite strove to cultivate admiration for simple beauty and discourage rigorous minutiae. His correspondence with [[Thomas Joannes Stieltjes|Thomas Stieltjes]] testifies to the great aid he gave those beginning scientific life. His published courses of lectures have exercised a great influence. His important original contributions to [[pure mathematics]], published in the major mathematical journals of the world, dealt chiefly with [[Abelian function|Abelian]] and [[elliptic function]]s and the [[Number theory|theory of numbers]]. During 1858 he solved the equation of the fifth degree by elliptic functions; and during 1873 he proved [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], the base of the [[Natural logarithm|natural system of logarithms]], to be [[Transcendental number|transcendental]]. This last was used by [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] to prove during 1882 the same for [[pi|π]].{{sfn|Linehan|1910}}\n\n==Publications==\nThe following is a list of his works:{{sfn|Linehan|1910}}\n* \"Sur quelques applications des fonctions elliptiques\", Paris, 1855; [http://resolver.library.cornell.edu/math/1849277 Page images] from Cornell.\n* \"Cours d'Analyse de l'École Polytechnique.

While at Harvard, he was a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]] in 1960.  He earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1967 from [[Princeton University]], where he wrote a dissertation under [[Goro Shimura]] characterizing the [[spectrum of a ring|prime spectra]] of [[commutative ring]]s.\n\n==Career==\nHe held positions at the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[Purdue University]] before joining the faculty at Michigan in 1977. \n\nHochster's work is primarily in [[commutative algebra]], especially the study of [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s over [[local ring]]s.  He has established classic theorems concerning [[Cohen-Macaulay ring]]s, [[invariant theory]] and [[homological algebra]].  For example, the ''Hochster-Roberts'' theorem states that the [[invariant polynomial|invariant]] [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of a linearly [[reductive group]] acting on a [[regular ring]] is Cohen-Macaulay.  His best-known work is on the [[homological conjectures]], many of which he established for local rings containing a field, thanks to his proof of the existence of [[big Cohen-Macaulay modules]] and his technique of [[reduction to prime characteristic]].  His most recent work on [[tight closure]], introduced in 1986 with [[Craig Huneke]], has found unexpected applications throughout commutative algebra and [[algebraic geometry]].\n\nHe has had more than 40 doctoral students, and the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] has pointed out his outstanding role in mentoring women students pursuing a career in mathematics. He served as the chair of the department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan from 2008 to 2017.\n\n==Awards==\nHochster shared the 1980 [[Cole Prize]] with [[Michael Aschbacher]], received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1981, and has been a member of both the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1992.

He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933-1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County.<ref name=\"gl\"/>\n\nIn 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago.

He introduced the [[Kervaire semi-characteristic]]. He was the first to show the existence of topological ''n''-manifolds with no differentiable structure (using the [[Kervaire invariant]]), and (with [[John Milnor]]) computed the number of [[exotic sphere]]s in dimensions greater than four. He is also well known for fundamental contributions to high-dimensional  [[knot theory]]. The solution of the [[Kervaire invariant|Kervaire invariant problem]] was announced by [[Michael J. Hopkins|Michael Hopkins]] in [[Edinburgh]] on 21 April 2009.\n\nHe was the son of André Kervaire (a French industrialist) and Nelly Derancourt. After completing high school in [[France]], Kervaire pursued his studies at [[ETH Zurich]] (1947–1952), receiving a [[Ph.D.]] in 1955. His thesis, entitled ''Courbure intégrale généralisée et homotopie'', was written under the direction of [[Heinz Hopf]].\n\nHe was a professor at [[New York University]]'s [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|Courant Institute]] from 1959 to 1971, and then at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1971 to 1997, when he retired.<ref>[http://www.unige.ch/math/people/retraite.html Collaborateurs retraités]</ref>  He was an honorary member of the [[Swiss Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.math.ch/members/honorary-members/ Honorary members of the SMS]</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n* {{citation\n |first=M. \n |last=Kervaire \n |title=A manifold which does not admit any differentiable structure \n |journal=[[Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici]] \n |volume=34 \n |year=1960 \n |pages=257&ndash;270 \n |doi=10.1007/BF02565940 \n |mr=0139172\n}}\n*{{cite journal| ref = harv| first1 = Michel A. | last1 = Kervaire | authorlink1 = Michel Kervaire | first2 = John W. | last2 = Milnor | authorlink2 = John Milnor | url = http://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/schick/publ/Groups%20of%20homotopy%20spheres%20I.pdf | title = Groups of homotopy spheres: I | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | publisher = Princeton University Press | volume = 77 | year = 1963 | issue = 3 | pages = 504&ndash;537 | doi = 10.2307/1970128| jstor = 1970128| mr = 0148075}} This paper describes the structure of the group of [[smooth structure]]s on an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] for ''n'' > 4.\n* {{citation\n |first       = M.\n |last        = Kervaire\n |title       = Les nœuds de dimensions supérieures\n |journal     = [[Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France]]\n |volume      = 93\n |year        = 1965\n |pages       = 225&ndash;271\n |url         = http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=BSMF_1965__93__225_0\n |mr          = 189052\n |doi         = 10.24033/bsmf.1624 \n}}\n* {{citation\n|first=M. \n|last=Kervaire\n|title=Smooth homology spheres and their fundamental groups\n|journal=  [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] \n|volume=144  \n|year=1969\n|pages= 67&ndash;72\n|mr=0253347\n|doi=10.2307/1995269\n|jstor=1995269\n}}\n*{{citation|first=Michel A.|last= Kervaire|first2= Shalom|last2= Eliahou |doi= 10.1016/0021-8693(90)90237-I\n|title=Minimal resolutions of some monomial ideals |journal= [[Journal of Algebra]] |volume=129|year=1990|issue= 1 |pages=1&ndash;25|mr= 1037391 }}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Eliahou | first1=Shalom | last2=de la Harpe | first2=Pierre | last3=Hausmann | first3=Jean-Claude | last4=Weber | first4=Claude | title=Michel Kervaire 1927--2007 | url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800960p.pdf | mr=2441527 | year=2008 | journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9920 | volume=55 | issue=8 | pages=960–961}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=121591}}\n*{{HDS|43122}}\n*[http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/slides/kervaire.pdf Michel Kervaire's work in surgery and knot theory] (Slides of lectures given by Andrew Ranicki at the Kervaire Memorial Symposium, Geneva, February 2009)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kervaire, Michel}}\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Swiss mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Topologists]]\n[[Category:Algebraists]]\n[[Category:Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty]]\n[[Category:ETH Zurich alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Częstochowa]]\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2007 deaths]]\n[[Category:University of Geneva faculty]]"

His father, [[Richert Vogt von Koch]] (1838–1913) was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the [[Royal Horse Guards (Sweden)|Royal Horse Guards]] of Sweden. He was enrolled at the newly created [[Stockholm University College]] in 1887 (studying under [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]]), and at [[Uppsala University]] in 1888, where he also received his bachelor's degree (''filosofie kandidat'') since non-governmental college in Stockholm had not yet received the rights to issue degrees. He received his Ph.D. in Uppsala in 1892. He was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm in 1905, succeeding [[Ivar Bendixson]], and became professor of pure mathematics at Stockholm University College in 1911.\n\nVon Koch wrote several papers on [[number theory]]. One of his results was a 1901 theorem proving that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is equivalent to a stronger form of the [[prime number theorem]].\n\nHe described the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]] in a 1904 paper entitled \"On a continuous curve without tangents constructible from elementary geometry\" (''original French title: \"Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire\"'').<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000100114564;view=1up;seq=673|last=von Koch |first=Helge|title=Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire|journal=[[Arkiv för Matematik]]|volume=1|year=1904|pages=681–704 |language=fr |jfm=35.0387.02 }}</ref>\n\nHe was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1900 in [[Paris]] with talk ''Sur la distribution des nombres premiers''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aag4063.0000.001;view=1up;seq=203 |chapter=Sur la distribution des nombres premiers |title=Congrès Int.

He is noted, among other things, for the [[Lambek calculus]], an effort to capture mathematical aspects of natural language syntax in [[logical form]] and a work that has been very influential in [[computational linguistics]], as well as for developing the connections between [[simply typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculus]] and [[cartesian closed categories]] (see [[Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence]]).

In his prime, Lasker was one of the most dominant champions, and he is still generally regarded as one of the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history|strongest players ever]].\n\nHis contemporaries used to say that Lasker used a \"psychological\" approach to the game, and even that he sometimes deliberately played inferior moves to confuse opponents. Recent analysis, however, indicates that he was ahead of his time and used a more flexible approach than his contemporaries, which mystified many of them. Lasker knew contemporary analyses of openings well but disagreed with many of them. He published chess magazines and five chess books, but later players and commentators found it difficult to draw lessons from his methods.\n\nLasker made contributions to the development of other games. He was a first-class [[contract bridge]] player<ref name=\"Laskeratbridge\">A detailed examination of Emanuel Lasker’s involvement in bridge is provided by the chapter ''Nicht nur Schach Emanuel Lasker als Bridgespieler'' by Robert van de Velde on pages 332-363 of ''Emanuel Lasker Denker Weltenbürger Schachweltmeister'' edited by Richard Forster, Stefan Hansen and Michael Negele (Berlin, 2009).</ref> and wrote about bridge, [[Go (game)|Go]], and his own invention, [[Lasca]]. His books about games presented a problem that is still considered notable in the [[Mathematical game|mathematical analysis of card games]]. Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his contributions to [[commutative algebra]], which included proving the [[Lasker–Noether theorem|primary decomposition]] of the [[ideal of a ring|ideal]]s of [[polynomial ring]]s. His philosophical works and a [[drama]] that he co-wrote, however, received little attention.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n=== Early years 1868–1894 ===\n[[Image:Lasker.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lasker as a young man]]\nEmanuel Lasker was born on December 24, 1868 at [[Berlinchen]] in [[Neumark]] (now [[Barlinek]] in [[Poland]]), the son of a [[Hazzan|Jewish cantor]]. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother [[Berthold Lasker|Berthold]], eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s.<ref name=\"chessmetricsProfileBertholdLasker\">{{cite web\n | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S073074000000111000000000017510100\n | title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: Berthold Lasker\n | publisher=Chessmetrics\n | author=[[Jeff Sonas]]\n | accessdate=2008-05-30\n}}</ref> To supplement their income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, especially at the Café&nbsp;Kaiserhof.<ref name=\"UXLEncyclopediaBiography\">{{cite book\n | title=UXL Encyclopedia of World Biography\n | editor=Tyle, L.B.\n | publisher=U·X·L\n | year=2002\n | isbn=0-7876-6465-0\n | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5229/is_2003/ai_n19151908\n | accessdate=2008-05-30\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Fine1952WorldsGreatChessGamesEmLasker\"/>\n\nLasker shot up through the chess rankings in 1889, when he won the Café Kaiserhof's annual Winter tournament 1888/89 and the ''Hauptturnier A'' (\"second division\" tournament) at the sixth [[DSB Congress|DSB&nbsp;Congress]] (German Chess Federation's congress) held in [[Breslau]]. Winning the Hauptturnier earned Lasker the title of \"master\".  The candidates were divided into two groups of ten. The top four in each group competed in a final. Lasker won his section, with 2½ points more than his nearest rival. However, scores were reset to 0 for the final. With two rounds to go, Lasker trailed the leader, Viennese amateur von Feierfeil, by 1½ points. Lasker won both of his final games, while von Feierfeil lost in the penultimate round (being mated in 121 moves after the position was reconstructed incorrectly following an adjournment) and drew in the last round. The two players were now tied. Lasker won a playoff and garnered the master title.

He first faced Marshall in the [[World Chess Championship 1907]], when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).<ref name=\"Giffard396\">Giffard, p.396</ref>\n\nHe then played Tarrasch in the [[World Chess Championship 1908]], first at [[Düsseldorf]] then at [[Munich]]. Tarrasch firmly believed the game of chess was governed by a precise set of principles.<ref name=\"Giffard396\"/> For him the strength of a chess move was in its logic, not in its efficiency. Because of his stubborn principles he considered Lasker as a {{chessgloss|coffeehouse|coffeehouse player}} who won his games only thanks to dubious tricks, while Lasker mocked the arrogance of Tarrasch who, in his opinion, shone more in [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] than at the chessboard.

For example, in the second game after 19 moves arose a situation (see diagram) in which Lasker was a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] down, with a {{chessgloss|bad bishop}} and {{chessgloss|doubled pawns}}. At this point it appeared Tarrasch was winning, but 20 moves later he was forced to [[resign (chess)|resign]].<ref name=\"Giffard398\">Giffard, p.398</ref> Lasker eventually won by 10½−5½ (eight wins, five draws, and three losses).

Lasker accepted and they played a [[World Chess Championship 1910 (Lasker–Janowski)|World Chess Championship match]] in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses).<ref name=\"storiascacchiMatches1900Al1914\"/> Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to [[Edward Lasker]], \"Your [[homonym]] plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am afraid I will not do anything good in this match.\"<ref name=\"Giffard400\"/>\n\n==== Match against Schlechter ====\n{{main|World Chess Championship 1910 (Lasker–Schlechter)}}\n[[Image:Carl Schlechter (profile).png|thumb|upright|Schlechter would have taken Lasker's world title if he had won or drawn the last game of their 1910 match.]]\nBetween his two matches against Janowski, Lasker arranged another [[World Chess Championship 1910 (Lasker–Schlechter)|World Chess Championship]] in January–February 1910 against [[Carl Schlechter]]. Schlechter was a modest gentleman, who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most [[draw (chess)|draw]] [[draw by agreement|offers]] from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw).<ref name=\"Giffard404\">Giffard 1993, p. 404</ref>  According to Isaak and Vladimir Linder, the match was originally to be a 30 game affair and Schlechter would have to win by a two game margin. They note that the Austrian chess historian Micheal Ehn has established, based on the Viennese sources, that Lasker agreed to forgo the plus two provision in view of the match being subsequently reduced to only 10 games. For proof Ehn quoted Schlechter's comment printed in Allgemeine Sportzeitung (ASZ) of December 9, 1909 \"There will be ten games in all. The winner on points will receive the title of world champion. If the points are equal, the decision will be made by the arbiter.\"\n<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Emanuel Lasker, 2nd World Chess Champion\n| author=Isaak and Vladimir Linder\n| publisher=Russel Enterprises Inc.\n| date=2010\n| page=109 }}\n</ref>\n\nAt the beginning, Lasker tried to attack but Schlechter had no difficulty defending, so that the first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at the middle of the match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful [[The exchange (chess)#The exchange sacrifice|exchange sacrifice]] from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost [[chess endgame|ending]]. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing.<ref name=\"Giffard406\">Giffard 1993, p. 406</ref> Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.\n\n==== Abandoned challenges ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Capablanca3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[José Raúl Capablanca]] won the world title from Lasker in 1921]] -->\nIn 1911 Lasker received a challenge for a world title match against the rising star [[José Raúl Capablanca]]. Lasker was unwilling to play the traditional \"first to win ten games\" type of match in the semi-tropical conditions of [[Havana]], especially as drawn games were becoming more frequent and the match might last for over six months. He therefore made a counter-proposal: if neither player had a lead of at least two games by the end of the match, it should be considered a draw; the match should be limited to the best of thirty games, counting draws; except that if either player won six games ''and'' led by at least two games before thirty games were completed, he should be declared the winner; the champion should decide the venue and stakes, and should have the exclusive right to publish the games; the challenger should deposit a forfeit of US $2,000 (equivalent to over $194,000 in 2006 values<ref>Using average incomes as the conversion factor; if prices are used for the conversion, the result is about $45,000—see {{cite web\n | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/\n | title=Six Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to Present\n | publisher=MeasuringWorth\n | accessdate=2008-06-05\n}}</ref>); the time limit should be twelve moves per hour; play should be limited to two sessions of 2½ hours each per day, five days a week. Capablanca objected to the time limit, the short playing times, the thirty-game limit, and especially the requirement that he must win by two games to claim the title, which he regarded as unfair. Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations, and until 1914 Lasker and Capablanca were not on speaking terms. However, at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, Capablanca proposed a set of rules for the conduct of World Championship matches, which were accepted by all the leading players, including Lasker.<ref name=\"graemecree1921WorldChessChampionship\">{{Cite web\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120165616/http://members.aol.com/graemecree/chesschamps/world/world1921.htm\n | title=1921 World Chess Championship\n | accessdate=2008-11-21\n | archivedate=January 20, 2005\n | url=http://members.aol.com/graemecree/chesschamps/world/world1921.htm\n}} This cites: a report of Lasker's concerns about the location and duration of the match, in the ''New York Evening Post'', March 15, 1911; Capablanca's letter of December 20, 1911 to Lasker, stating his objections to Lasker's proposal; Lasker's letter to Capablanca, breaking off negotiations; Lasker's letter of April 27, 1921 to Alberto Ponce of the Havana Chess Club, proposing to resign the 1921 match; and Ponce's reply, accepting the resignation.</ref>\n\nLate in 1912 Lasker entered into negotiations for a world title match with [[Akiba Rubinstein]], whose tournament record for the previous few years had been on a par with Lasker's and a little ahead of Capablanca's.<ref name=\"chessmetricsProfileRubinstein\">{{cite web\n | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=188510SSSSS3S112008189006131000000000026310100\n | title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: Akiba Rubinstein\n | publisher=Chessmetrics\n | author=[[Jeff Sonas]]\n | accessdate=2008-06-04\n}}</ref> The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played.

Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a final clause that allowed him to play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play [[Akiba Rubinstein]] for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein's.<ref name=\"WinterHowCapaBecameChampion\"/>\n\nA report in the ''American Chess Bulletin'' (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had resigned the world title in favor of Capablanca because the conditions of the match were unpopular in the chess world. The ''American Chess Bulletin'' speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match.<ref name=\"WinterHowCapaBecameChampion\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca2.html\n | title=How Capablanca Became World Champion\n | author=Winter, Edward\n | publisher=ChessHistory\n | accessdate=2008-06-05\n | authorlink=Edward Winter (chess historian)\n}} Winter cites: ''American Chess Bulletin'' (July–August 1920 issue) for Lasker's resignation of the title, the ''ACB''{{'s}} theory about Lasker's real motive and Havana's offer of $20,000; [[Amos Burn]] in ''The Field'' of 3 July 1920, the ''British Chess Magazine'' of August 1920 and other sources for protestations that Lasker had no right to nominate a successor; [[Amos Burn]] in ''The Field'' of 3 July 1920 and E.S. Tinsley in ''The Times'' (London) of 26 June 1920 for criticism of the conditions Lasker set for the defense of the title; ''American Chess Bulletin'' September–October 1920 for Lasker's and Capablanca's statements that Capablanca was the champion and Lasker the challenger, for Capablanca's statement that Lasker's contract with Rubinstein had contained a clause allowing him to abdicate in favor of Rubinstein, for Lasker's intention to resign the title if he beat Capablanca and his support for an international organization, preferably based in the Americas, to manage international chess. Winter says that before Lasker's abdication some chess correspondents had been calling for Lasker to be stripped of the title. For a very detailed account given by Capablanca after the match, see {{Cite journal\n | journal=British Chess Magazine\n | author=Capablanca, José Raúl\n | date=October 1922\n | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablancalasker.html\n | title=Capablanca's Reply to Lasker (presented by Edward Winter)\n | accessdate=2008-06-05\n | authorlink=José Raúl Capablanca\n}}</ref> When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in [[Havana]] had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.<ref name=\"WinterHowCapaBecameChampion\"/>\n\nThe match was played in March–April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] with Black in an equal [[chess endgame|ending]]. Capablanca's solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a position with an [[Isolated Queen Pawn|isolated queen pawn]] but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.<ref>{{cite book\n | title=Le guide des échecs\n | author=Giffard, Nicolas\n | language=French\n | year=1993\n | publisher=[[Éditions Robert Laffont]]\n | page=412\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Reuben Fine]] and [[Harry Golombek]] attributed this to Lasker's being in mysteriously poor form.<ref name=\"Fine1952WorldsGreatChessGamesEmLasker\"/><ref>{{cite book\n | author=Golombek, H.\n | chapter=On the Way to the World Championship |page=59\n | title=Capablanca's Hundred Best Games of Chess\n | editor=Golombek, H.\n | publisher=G.

He began inserting a space into his surname because his first wife found it difficult to type the name without a space.<ref>Mac Lane (2005), p. 6.</ref>\nHe was the oldest of three brothers; one of his brothers, Gerald MacLane, also became a mathematics professor at [[Rice University]] and [[Purdue University]]. Another sister died as a baby. His father and grandfather were both ministers; his grandfather had been a [[Presbyterian]], but was kicked out of the church for believing in [[evolution]], and his father was a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]. His mother, née Winifred Saunders, studied at [[Mount Holyoke College]] and taught English, Latin, and mathematics.<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nIn high school, Mac Lane's favorite subject was [[chemistry]]. While in high school, his father died, and he came under his grandfather's care. His half-uncle, a lawyer, was determined to send him to [[Yale University]], where many of his relatives had been educated, and paid his way there beginning in 1926.\nAs a freshman, he became disillusioned with chemistry. His mathematics instructor, [[Lester S. Hill]], coached him for a local mathematics competition which he won, setting the direction for his future work. He went on to study mathematics and physics as a double major, taking courses from [[Jesse Beams]], [[Ernest William Brown]], [[Ernest Lawrence]], [[F. S. C. Northrop]], and [[Øystein Ore]], among others. He graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1930.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> During this period, he published his first scientific paper, in [[physics]] and co-authored with [[Irving Langmuir]].\n\nIn 1929, at a party of Yale football supporters in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], Mac Lane (there to be presented with a prize for having the best grade point average yet recorded at Yale) had met [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], the new president of the [[University of Chicago]], who encouraged him to go there for his graduate studies and soon afterwards offered him a scholarship. Mac Lane neglected to actually apply to the program, but showed up and was admitted anyway. At Chicago, the subjects he studied included [[set theory]] with [[E. H. Moore]], [[number theory]] with [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]], the [[calculus of variations]] with [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]], and logic with [[Mortimer J. Adler]].<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nIn 1931, having earned his master's degree and feeling restless at Chicago, he earned a fellowship from the Institute of International Education and became one of the last Americans to study at the [[University of Göttingen]] prior to its decline under the Nazis. His greatest influences there were [[Paul Bernays]] and [[Hermann Weyl]]. By the time he finished his doctorate in 1934, Bernays had been forced to leave because he was Jewish, and Weyl became his main examiner. At Göttingen, Mac Lane also studied with [[Gustav Herglotz]] and [[Emmy Noether]]. Within days of finishing his degree, he married Dorothy Jones, from Chicago, and soon returned to the U.S.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Mac Lane, Saunders|title=Mathematics at Göttingen under the Nazis|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=Oct 1995|volume=42|issue=10|pages=1134–1138|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199510/maclane.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Notices of the AMS|author=Segal, Sanford L.|authorlink=Sanford L.

He then held a tenure track appointment at Harvard from 1938 to 1947. In 1941, while giving a series of visiting lectures at the [[University of Michigan]], he met [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and began what would become a fruitful collaboration on the interplay between algebra and topology. In 1944 and 1945, he also directed Columbia University's Applied Mathematics Group, which was involved in the war effort as a contractor for the [[Applied Mathematics Panel]]; the mathematics he worked on in this group concerned [[differential equation]]s for [[fire-control system]]s.<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nIn 1947, he accepted an offer to return to Chicago, where (in part because of the university's involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]], and in part because of the administrative efforts of [[Marshall Stone]]) many other famous mathematicians and physicists had also recently moved. He traveled as a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] to [[ETH Zurich]] for the 1947–1948 term, where he worked with [[Heinz Hopf]]. Mac Lane succeeded Stone as department chair in 1952, and served for six years.<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nMac Lane was vice president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]], and president of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. While presiding over the [[Mathematical Association of America]] in the 1950s, he initiated its activities aimed at improving the teaching of modern mathematics. He was a member of the [[National Science Board]], 1974–1980, advising the American government. In 1976, he led a delegation of mathematicians to [[China]] to study the conditions affecting mathematics there. Mac Lane was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1949, and received the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1989.\n\n==Contributions==\nAfter a thesis in [[mathematical logic]], his early work was in [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] and [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation theory]]. He wrote on [[valuation ring]]s and [[Witt vector]]s, and separability in infinite [[field extension]]s. He started writing on [[group extension]]s in 1942, and in 1943 began his research on what are now called [[Eilenberg–Mac Lane space|Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s K(''G'',''n''), having a single non-trivial [[homotopy group]] ''G'' in dimension ''n''. This work opened the way to [[group cohomology]] in general.\n\nAfter introducing, via the [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]], the abstract approach to [[homology theory]], he and Eilenberg originated [[category theory]] in 1945. He is especially known for his work on [[coherence theorem]]s. A recurring feature of category theory, [[abstract algebra]], and of some other mathematics as well, is the use of [[commutative diagram|diagrams]], consisting of arrows ([[morphism]]s) linking objects, such as [[product (category theory)|products]] and [[coproduct]]s. According to McLarty (2005), this diagrammatic approach to contemporary mathematics largely stems from Mac Lane (1948). Mac Lane also coined the term [[Yoneda lemma]] for a lemma which is an essential background to many central concepts of category theory and which was discovered by [[Nobuo Yoneda]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Prof. Nobuo Yoneda passed away|last=Kinoshita|first=Yoshiki|url=http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/yoneda|accessdate=21 December 2013|date=23 April 1996}}</ref>\n\nMac Lane had an exemplary devotion to writing approachable texts, starting with his very influential ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'', coauthored in 1941 with [[Garrett Birkhoff]]. From then on, it was possible to teach elementary modern algebra to undergraduates using an English text. His ''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]'' remains the definitive introduction to category theory.\n\nMac Lane supervised the Ph.Ds of, among many others, [[David Eisenbud]], [[William Alvin Howard|William Howard]], [[Irving Kaplansky]], [[Michael D. Morley|Michael Morley]], [[Anil Nerode]], [[Robert Solovay]], and [[John G. Thompson]].\n\nIn addition to reviewing a fair amount of his mathematical output, the obituary articles McLarty (2005, 2007) clarify Mac Lane's contributions to the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Mac Lane (1986) is an approachable introduction to his views on this subject.\n\n==Selected works==\n* 1997 (1941). ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'' (with [[Garrett Birkhoff]]).

The [[Gauss–Manin connection]] is a basic ingredient of the study of [[cohomology]] in families of [[algebraic varieties]]. He wrote a book on [[cubic surface]]s and [[cubic form]]s, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as [[nonassociative algebra]]. He also indicated the role of the [[Brauer group]], via [[Grothendieck]]'s theory of global [[Azumaya algebra]]s, in accounting for obstructions to the [[Hasse principle]], setting off a generation of further work. He also formulated the [[Manin conjecture]], which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on [[Yang–Mills theory]], [[quantum information]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].\n\nManin had over 40 doctoral students, including [[Vladimir Berkovich]], [[Mariusz Wodzicki]], [[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Ivan Cherednik]], [[Alexei Skorobogatov]], [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], [[Mikhail Kapranov]], [[Vyacheslav Shokurov]], [[Arend Bayer]] and [[Victor Kolyvagin]], as well as foreign students including [[Hà Huy Khoái]].\n\n==Awards==\nHe was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1987, the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] in 1994, the [[Schock Prize]] in 1999 and the [[Cantor Medal]] in 2002, and the [[Bolyai Prize]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 2010.\n\nIn 1990 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4514 |title=Y.I.

After his marriage in 1971, he became a ''[[maggid shiur]]'' at Beis Medrash L'Torah in [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. Afterward, he taught at Yeshivas Brisk (Brisk Rabbinical College) in Chicago, headed for a time by his uncle, Rabbi [[Ahron Soloveichik]].<ref name=mish/> In 1977 he moved to the West Coast and founded the Yeshiva University of Los Angeles (YULA), opening separate high school programs for boys and girls, a [[Yeshiva|yeshivah gedolah]], and a [[kolel]]. He also served as a [[posek]] (arbiter of Jewish law) for the local community.<ref name=mish/>\n\nIn 1982, having built up enrollment to nearly 400 male and female students in YULA's various divisions, Meiselman moved to Israel to open a yeshiva for American students, together with co-rosh yeshiva Rabbi Doniel Lehrfield (Rabbi Lehrfield and several other faculty members subsequently left to start another yeshiva, [[Yeshivas Bais Yisroel|Bais Yisroel]]).

His ''Jewish Woman in Jewish Law'' (1978) sparked much discussion among authors and feminists for his traditional Jewish response to [[feminism]]. Additionally, Meiselman has authored Tiferes Tzvi, a commentary to the Rambam, as well as numerous articles on Talmudic study and thought in Hebrew.\n\n==Philosophies and controversies==\n\n===''Torah, Chazal and Science''===\nMeiselman's 2013 book, ''Torah, Chazal and Science'', promotes the theory that all unqualified scientific statements of the Talmudic sages were divinely inspired and are therefore immutable: \"All of Chazal’s (the Talmudic sages') definitive statements are to be taken as absolute fact [even] outside the realm of [[halakhah]] (Jewish law)\".<ref>''Torah, Chazal and Science'' (Lakewood: 2013), p. 634<!--ISSN/ISBN needed, if any--></ref> The flip side of this thesis, and another major theme of the book, is that modern science is transitory and unreliable compared to the divine wisdom of the sages.\n\n===The Holocaust===\nFollowing the opinion of some Haredi thinkers in the area of [[Holocaust theology]], Meiselman has argued that the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] was the result of Jewish cultural assimilation in Western Europe in the early twentieth century. He writes that \"the turning away from the status of an '''am ha-nivhar'', a chosen people, and the frightening rush toward assimilation were, according to the rules that govern Jewish destiny, the real causes for the Holocaust\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzbAYgEACAAJ|title=Towards a Torah Understanding of the Holocaust|first=Moshe|last=Meiselman|journal=Oraisa: A Journal of Contemporary Jewish Issues|publisher=Yeshivas Toras Moshe|year=1989|volume=1|pages=19–20}}</ref>\n\n===The State of Israel===\nMeiselman subscribes to Haredi views regarding the State of Israel and the [[Israel Defence Forces]].

Moore]], discovered mathematics through a summer job at the [[Cincinnati Observatory]] while in high school. He learned mathematics at [[Yale University]], where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]]<ref name=\"Yaleobit193233\">{{cite web | url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1932-33.pdf | title=Obituary Record of Graduates of Yale University Deceased during the Year 1932–1933 | publisher=Yale University | date=October 15, 1933 | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}</ref>{{rp|47–8}} and obtained a [[B.A.]] in 1883 and the [[Ph.D.]] in 1885 with a thesis, supervised by [[Hubert Anson Newton]], on some work of [[William Kingdon Clifford]] and [[Arthur Cayley]]. Newton encouraged Moore to study in Germany, and thus he spent an academic year at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], attending lectures by [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]].\n\nOn his return to the United States, Moore taught at Yale and at [[Northwestern University]]. When the [[University of Chicago]] opened its doors in 1892, Moore was the first head of its mathematics department, a position he retained until his death in 1931. His first two colleagues were [[Oskar Bolza]] and [[Heinrich Maschke]]. The resulting department was the second research-oriented mathematics department in American history, after [[Johns Hopkins University]]. <!-- Until World War II, many  Americans took doctoral degrees from European universities, especially [[Göttingen University]]. -->\n\n==Accomplishments==\nMoore first worked in [[abstract algebra]], proving in 1893 the classification of the structure of [[finite fields]] (also called [[Galois field]]s). Around 1900, he began working on the foundations of [[geometry]]. He reformulated [[Hilbert's axioms]] for geometry so that [[Point (geometry)|point]]s were the only [[primitive notion]], thus turning [[David Hilbert]]'s primitive lines and planes into defined notions. In 1902, he further showed that one of Hilbert's axioms for geometry was redundant. Independently,<ref name=\"Wilder1976\">{{cite web\n  | last = Wilder\n  | first = R.

Moore heard of the feat, he arranged for a scholarship that would allow R.L. Moore to study for a doctorate at Chicago. E.H. Moore's work on axiom systems is considered one of the starting points for [[metamathematics]] and [[model theory]]. After 1906, he turned to the foundations of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. The concept of a [[closure operator]] first appeared in his 1910 ''Introduction to a form of general analysis''.<ref>T.S.

Birkhoff and Veblen went on to lead departments at Harvard and Princeton, respectively. Dickson became the first great American algebraist and number theorist. Robert Moore founded American topology. According to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]], as of December 2012, E. H. Moore had  over 18,900 known \"descendants.\"\n\nMoore convinced the [[New York Mathematical Society]] to change its name to the [[American Mathematical Society]], whose Chicago branch he led. He presided over the AMS, 1901–02, and edited the ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'', 1899–1907. He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1908 in Rome and in 1912 in Cambridge, England.\n\nThe [[American Mathematical Society]] established a prize in his honor in 2002.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Moore–Penrose inverse]]\n* [[Moore–Smith sequence]]\n* [[Moore matrix]] over a finite field\n* [[Moore determinant of a Hermitian matrix]] over a quaternion algebra\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (2000) ''The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870–1940''.

Sometimes ''Emmy'' is mistakenly reported as a short form for ''Amalie'', or misreported as \"Emily\". e.g. {{Citation | url = http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge52.html | author-link = Lee Smolin | first = Lee | last = Smolin | work = Edge | title = Special Relativity – Why Can't You Go Faster Than Light? | quote = Emily Noether, a great German mathematician}}</ref> ({{IPA-de|ˈnøːtɐ|lang}}; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German [[mathematician]] who made important contributions to [[abstract algebra]] and [[theoretical physics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emmy-noether-theorem-legacy-physics-math |title=Emmy Noether changed the face of physics; Noether linked two important concepts in physics: conservation laws and symmetries |author=Emily Conover |date=12 June 2018 |website=[[Sciencenews.org]] |publisher= |access-date=2 July 2018}}</ref> She invariably used the name \"Emmy Noether\" in her life and publications.<ref name=Rufname group=lower-alpha/> She was described by [[Pavel Alexandrov]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Jean Dieudonné]], [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Norbert Wiener]] as the most important [[List of women in mathematics|woman in the history of mathematics]].<ref name = \"einstein\" />{{sfn|Alexandrov|1981|p=100}} As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. In physics, [[Noether's theorem]] explains the connection between [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]].<ref name=\"neeman_1999\"/>\n\nNoether was born to a [[Jewish family]] in the [[Franconia]]n town of [[Erlangen]]; her father was a mathematician, [[Max Noether]]. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the [[University of Erlangen]], where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of [[Paul Gordan]], she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Felix Klein]] to join the mathematics department at the [[University of Göttingen]], a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her ''[[habilitation]]'' was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of ''[[Privatdozent]]''.\n\nNoether remained a leading member of the [[Göttingen]] mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the \"Noether boys\". In 1924, Dutch mathematician [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. van der Waerden]] joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas: Her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, ''[[Moderne Algebra]]''. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Zürich]], her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an [[ovarian cyst]] and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.\n\nNoether's mathematical work has been divided into three \"epochs\".<ref name=Weyl>{{Harvnb|Weyl|1935}}</ref> In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of [[algebraic invariant]]s and [[field (mathematics)|number fields]]. Her work on differential invariants in the [[calculus of variations]], ''[[Noether's theorem]]'', has been called \"one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics\".{{Sfn |Lederman|Hill|2004|p=73}} In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that \"changed the face of [abstract] algebra\".<ref name=\"weyl_128\"/> In her classic 1921 paper ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen'' (''Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains'') Noether developed the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[commutative ring]]s into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the [[ascending chain condition]], and objects satisfying it are named ''[[Noetherian (disambiguation)|Noetherian]]'' in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on [[noncommutative algebra]]s and [[hypercomplex number]]s and united the [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] with the theory of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as [[algebraic topology]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Erlangen 1916.jpg|thumb|Noether grew up in the Bavarian city of [[Erlangen]], depicted here in a 1916 postcard]]\n[[File:NoetherFamily MFO3120.jpg|thumb|Emmy Noether with her brothers Alfred, [[Fritz Noether|Fritz]], and Robert, before 1918]]\nEmmy's father, [[Max Noether]], was descended from a family of wholesale traders in Germany. At age 14, he had been paralyzed by [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. He regained mobility, but one leg remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1868. After teaching there for seven years, he took a position in the Bavarian city of [[Erlangen]], where he met and married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of a prosperous merchant.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=3–5}}{{Sfn |Osen | 1974 |p=142}}{{Sfn |Lederman|Hill|2004|pp=70–71}}{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp=7–9}}\n\nMax Noether's mathematical contributions were to [[algebraic geometry]] mainly, following in the footsteps of [[Alfred Clebsch]]. His best known results are the [[Brill–Noether theorem]] and the residue, or [[AF+BG theorem]]; several other theorems are associated with him; see [[Max Noether's theorem (disambiguation)|Max Noether's theorem]].\n\nEmmy Noether was born on 23&nbsp;March 1882, the first of four children.<ref>{{cite book |title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians |edition=illustrated |first1=Sooyoung |last1=Chang |publisher=World Scientific |year=2011 |isbn=978-981-4282-29-1 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC&pg=PA21 Extract of p. 21]</ref> Her first name was \"Amalie\", after her mother and paternal grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age.\n\nAs a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was [[near-sighted]] and talked with a minor [[lisp]] during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age.{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp= 9–10}} She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p= 142}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=10–11}}\n\nShe had three younger brothers: The eldest, Alfred, was born in 1883, was awarded a doctorate in [[chemistry]] from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. [[Fritz Noether]], born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments; after studying in [[Munich]] he made a reputation for himself in [[applied mathematics]]. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=25, 45}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|p=5}}\n\n==University education==\n[[File:Paul Albert Gordan.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Gordan]] supervised Noether's doctoral dissertation on [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] of biquadratic forms.]]\nNoether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900, she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of ''sehr gut'' (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the [[University of Erlangen]].\n\nThis was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing [[mixed-sex education]] would \"overthrow all academic order\".{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p=10}} One of only two women in a university of 986&nbsp;students, Noether was only allowed to [[academic audit|audit]] classes rather than participate fully, and required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14&nbsp;July 1903 she passed the graduation exam at a ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' in [[Nuremberg]].{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp=11–12}}{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=8–10}}{{Sfn |Lederman|Hill|2004|p= 71}}\n\nDuring the 1903–1904 winter semester, she studied at the University of Göttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer [[Karl Schwarzschild]] and mathematicians [[Hermann Minkowski]], [[Otto Blumenthal]], [[Felix Klein]], and [[David Hilbert]]. Soon thereafter, restrictions on women's participation in that university were rescinded.\n\nNoether returned to Erlangen. She officially reentered the university in October 1904, and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics. Under the supervision of [[Paul Gordan]] she wrote her dissertation, ''Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form'' (''On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms'', 1907). Gordan was a member of the \"computational\" school of invariant researchers, and Noether's thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert.{{Sfn|Sally|Srinavasan|2012|p=164}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=10–11}} Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as \"crap\".{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=10–11}}{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp=13–17}}<ref group=lower-alpha>{{Harvnb|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=71}} write that she completed her doctorate at Göttingen, but this appears to be an error.</ref>\n\n==Teaching==\n===University of Erlangen===\nFor the next seven years (1908–1915) she taught at the University of Erlangen's Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to ''n'' variables.\n\n[[File:Emmy noether postcard 1915.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Noether sometimes used postcards to discuss abstract algebra with her colleague, [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer|Ernst Fischer]]. This card is postmarked 10&nbsp;April 1915.]]\nGordan retired in the spring of 1910, but continued to teach occasionally with his successor, [[Erhard Schmidt]], who left shortly afterward for a position in [[Breslau]]. Gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when Schmidt's successor [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer|Ernst Fischer]] arrived; Gordan died a year later in December 1912.\n\nAccording to [[Hermann Weyl]], Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of [[David Hilbert]]. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as [[field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[rational function]]s and the [[invariant theory|invariants]] of [[finite group]]s. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with [[abstract algebra]], the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.\n\nNoether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=11–12}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=18–24}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p= 143}}\n\n===University of Göttingen===\nIn the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and [[Felix Klein]]. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the [[Philology|philologists]] and [[historian]]s among the philosophical faculty: Women, they insisted, should not become ''[[privatdozent]]en''. One faculty member protested: \"''What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?''\"{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=14}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=32}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|pp=144–45}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=72}} Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, \"''I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as ''privatdozent''. After all, we are a university, not a bath house.''\"{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=14}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=32}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|pp=144–45}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=72}}\n\n[[File:Hilbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1915 [[David Hilbert]] invited Noether to join the Göttingen mathematics department, challenging the views of some of his colleagues that a woman should not be allowed to teach at a university.]]\nNoether left for Göttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time Noether's father retired and her brother joined the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] to serve in [[World War I]]. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=24–26}}\n\nDuring her first years teaching at Göttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert's name, and Noether would provide \"assistance\".\n\nSoon after arriving at Göttingen, however, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the [[theorem]] now known as [[Noether's theorem]], which shows that a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] is associated with any [[derivative|differentiable]] [[symmetry in physics|symmetry of a physical system]].{{Sfn|Osen|1974|pp=144–45}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=72}} The paper was presented by a colleague, F. Klein on 26 July 1918 to a meeting of the Royal Society of Sciences at Göttingen.{{Sfn|Noether|1918c|p=235}} Noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of the society.{{Sfn|Byers|1996|p=2}} American physicists [[Leon M. Lederman]] and [[Christopher T. Hill]] argue in their book ''Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe'' that Noether's theorem is \"certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of [[modern physics]], possibly on a par with the [[Pythagorean theorem]]\".{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=73}}\n\n[[File:Mathematik Göttingen.jpg|thumb|210px|The mathematics department at the University of Göttingen allowed Noether's ''[[habilitation]]'' in 1919, four years after she had begun lecturing at the school.]]\nWhen World War I ended, the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her ''[[habilitation]]'' (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her ''habilitation'' lecture in June 1919.\n\nThree years later she received a letter from {{ill|Otto Boelitz|de}}, the [[Prussia]]n Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of ''nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor'' (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=188}}). This was an unpaid \"extraordinary\" [[Professor|professorship]], not the higher \"ordinary\" professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of ''Lehrbeauftragte für Algebra'' a year later.{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=14–18}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p=145}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=33–34}}\n\n==Work in abstract algebra==\nAlthough Noether's theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to [[abstract algebra]]. In his introduction to Noether's ''Collected Papers'', [[Nathan Jacobson]] wrote that<blockquote>The development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her – in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries.{{sfn|Noether|1983}}</blockquote> She sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own.{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn |Osen|1974|p=148}}\n\nNoether's work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the [[ideal theory|theory of ideals]] in which they defined [[Ideal (ring theory)|left and right ideals]] in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\nThe following year she published a paper called ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen'', analyzing [[ascending chain condition]]s with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist [[Irving Kaplansky]] called this work \"revolutionary\";{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p=18}} the publication gave rise to the term \"[[Noetherian ring]]\" and the naming of several other mathematical objects as ''[[Noetherian (disambiguation)|Noetherian]]''.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p=18}}{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp= 44–45}}{{Sfn |Osen|1974|pp=145–46}}\n\nIn 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. van der Waerden]], arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\".{{Sfn|van der Waerden|1935|p=100}} In 1931 he published ''Moderne Algebra'', a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition \"based in part on lectures by [[Emil Artin|E. Artin]] and E. Noether\".{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=57–58}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=19}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=74}}\n\nVan der Waerden's visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian [[topology|topologist]] [[Pavel Alexandrov]] lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as ''der Noether'', using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=24–25}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=61–63}} They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether \"the greatest woman mathematician of all time\".{{Sfn|Alexandrov|1981|pp=100, 107}}\n\n==Graduate students and influential lectures==\nIn addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her \"a severe critic\", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=37–49}} A colleague later described her this way:<blockquote>Completely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.{{Sfn|van der Waerden|1935|p= 98}}</blockquote>\n\n===Göttingen===\n[[File:EmmyNoether MFO3096.jpg|thumb|left|Noether c.&nbsp;1930]]\nIn Göttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students; her first was [[Grete Hermann]], who defended her dissertation in February&nbsp;1925. She later spoke reverently of her \"dissertation-mother\".{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=51}} Noether also supervised [[Max Deuring]], who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute significantly to the field of [[arithmetic geometry]]; [[Hans Fitting]], remembered for [[Fitting's theorem]] and the [[Fitting lemma]]; and [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Zeng Jiongzhi]] (also rendered \"Chiungtze C. Tsen\" in English), who proved [[Tsen's theorem]]. She also worked closely with [[Wolfgang Krull]], who greatly advanced [[commutative algebra]] with his [[Krull's principal ideal theorem|''Hauptidealsatz'']] and his [[Krull dimension|dimension theory]] for commutative rings.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp= 53–57}}\n\nHer frugal lifestyle at first was due to being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, [[Gottfried E. Noether]].{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=46–48}}\n\nMostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, biographers suggest she focused on her studies. A distinguished algebraist [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, \"gesticulated wildly\" as she ate and \"spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed\".{{Sfn|Taussky|1981|p=80}} Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=40–41}}\n\nAccording to van der Waerden's obituary of Emmy Noether, she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.<ref>{{cite journal |author-link=Bartel Leendert van der Waerden |last=van der Waerden |first= B.L. |title=Nachruf auf Emmy Noether |trans-title=Obituary of Emmy Noether |journal=Mathematische Annalen |volume= 111 |year=1935 |language=de |pages=469–74 |doi= 10.1007/BF01472233 |url= http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=11&PPN=PPN235181684_0111&DMDID=DMDLOG_0038&L=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903172427/http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=11&PPN=PPN235181684_0111&DMDID=DMDLOG_0038&L=1 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all}} Reprinted in {{harvnb|Dick|1981}}.</ref>\n\nSeveral of her colleagues attended her lectures, and she allowed some of her ideas, such as the [[crossed product]] (''verschränktes Produkt'' in German) of associative algebras, to be published by others. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at Göttingen:<ref name=\"scharlau_49\">Scharlau, W. \"Emmy Noether's Contributions to the Theory of Algebras\" in {{Harvnb|Teicher|1999|p=49}}.</ref>\n* Winter 1924/1925: ''Gruppentheorie und hyperkomplexe Zahlen'' [''Group Theory and Hypercomplex Numbers'']\n* Winter 1927/1928: ''Hyperkomplexe Grössen und Darstellungstheorie'' [''Hypercomplex Quantities and Representation Theory'']\n* Summer 1928: ''Nichtkommutative Algebra'' [''Noncommutative Algebra'']\n* Summer 1929: ''Nichtkommutative Arithmetik'' [''Noncommutative Arithmetic'']\n* Winter 1929/30: ''Algebra der hyperkomplexen Grössen'' [''Algebra of Hypercomplex Quantities'']\n\nThese courses often preceded major publications on the same subjects.\n\nNoether spoke quickly – reflecting the speed of her thoughts, many said – and demanded great concentration from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated.{{sfn|Mac Lane|1981|p=77}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=37}} Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.\n\nShe developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not. \"Outsiders\" who occasionally visited Noether's lectures usually spent only 30&nbsp;minutes in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: \"The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out.\"{{sfn|Dick|1981|pp=38–41}}\n\nNoether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house.{{Sfn |Mac Lane|1981|p=71}} Later, after she had been dismissed by the [[Third Reich]], she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.{{Sfn |Dick|1981|p= 76}}\n\n===Moscow===\n[[File:Paul S Alexandroff 2.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Pavel Alexandrov]]]]\nIn the winter of 1928–1929 Noether accepted an invitation to [[Moscow State University]], where she continued working with [[Pavel Alexandrov|P.S. Alexandrov]]. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and [[algebraic geometry]].

She was especially happy to see [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the [[Bolshevik]] project.

The congress was attended by 800&nbsp;people, including Noether's colleagues [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Edmund Landau]], and [[Wolfgang Krull]]. There were 420&nbsp;official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented.

At the University of Göttingen the German Student Association led the attack on the \"un-German spirit\" attributed to Jews and was aided by a [[privatdozent]] named [[Werner Weber (mathematician)|Werner Weber]], a former student of Noether. [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors.

[[Albert Einstein]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] were appointed by the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal [[immigration]]. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: [[Bryn Mawr College]], in the United States, and [[Somerville College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], in England. After a series of negotiations with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=78–79}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp= 30–31}}\n\nAt Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended [[Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler|Anna Wheeler]], who had studied at Göttingen just before Noether arrived there.

She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways.{{Sfn |Osen|1974|pp=148–49}}{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=11–12}} Her friend and colleague [[Hermann Weyl]] described her scholarly output in three epochs:\n{{Quote |Emmy Noether's scientific production fell into three clearly distinct epochs:\n\n(1) the period of relative dependence, 1907–1919\n\n(2) the investigations grouped around the general theory of ideals 1920–1926\n\n(3) the study of the non-commutative algebras, their representations by linear transformations, and their application to the study of commutative number fields and their arithmetics|{{Harvnb |Weyl| 1935}}}}\n\nIn the first epoch (1907–1919), Noether dealt primarily with [[invariant theory|differential and algebraic invariants]], beginning with her dissertation under [[Paul Gordan]]. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of [[David Hilbert]], through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer]]. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her work for physics, the two [[Noether's theorem]]s.\n\nIn the second epoch (1920–1926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of [[ring (mathematics)|mathematical rings]].{{Sfn |Gilmer|1981|p= 131}}\n\nIn the third epoch (1927–1935), Noether focused on [[noncommutative algebra]], [[linear map|linear transformations]], and commutative number fields.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp= 10–23}}\n\nAlthough the results of Noether's first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B.L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.\n\nIn these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], generalizing earlier work of [[Richard Dedekind]]. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as [[elimination theory]] and the [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] that had been studied by her father.\n\n===Historical context===\nIn the century from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, the field of mathematics – specifically [[algebra]] – underwent a profound revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., [[cubic function|cubic]], [[quartic equation|quartic]], and [[quintic equation]]s, as well as on the [[root of unity|related problem]] of constructing [[regular polygon]]s using [[compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, [[abstract algebra]].<ref name=\"algebra_contributions_paramount\">G.E. {{Harvnb|Noether|1987|p=168}}.</ref>\n\n===Background on abstract algebra and ''begriffliche Mathematik'' (conceptual mathematics)===\nTwo of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]].\n\nA ''group'' consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be [[associativity|associative]], there must be an [[identity element]] (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an [[inverse element]].\n\nA ''ring'' likewise, has a set of elements, but now has ''two'' operations. The first operation must make the set a group, and the second operation is associative and [[distributivity|distributive]] with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be [[commutativity|commutative]]; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first – the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]] (an element ''x'' such that ''a x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;), the ring is called a ''[[division ring]]''. A ''[[field (mathematics)|field]]'' is defined as a commutative division ring.\n\nGroups are frequently studied through ''[[group representation]]s''. In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an ''action'' of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a [[vector space]], and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.\n\nA powerful way of studying rings is through their ''[[module (mathematics)|modules]]''. A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module.\n\nThe underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an ''[[algebra over a field|algebra]]''. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.\n\nWords such as \"element\" and \"combining operation\" are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For example, the elements might be [[Word (data type)|computer data words]], where the first combining operation is [[exclusive or]] and the second is [[logical conjunction]]. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether's gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, her student van&nbsp;der&nbsp;Waerden recalled that\n{{quote |The maxim by which Emmy Noether was guided throughout her work might be formulated as follows: \"''Any relationships between numbers, functions, and operations become transparent, generally applicable, and fully productive only after they have been isolated from their particular objects and been formulated as universally valid concepts.''\"{{sfn|Dick|1981|p=101}} }}\n\nThis is the ''begriffliche Mathematik'' (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra.\n\n===Example: Integers as a ring===\nThe [[integer]]s form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be [[addition|added]] or [[multiplication|multiplied]], always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is [[commutativity|commutative]], i.e., for any elements ''a'' and ''b'' in the ring, ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that ''a'' combined with ''b'' might be different from ''b'' combined with ''a''. Examples of noncommutative rings include [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[quaternion]]s. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer ''a'' such that 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nThe integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into [[prime number]]s. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the ''[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]'', for the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties ''do'' hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.\n\n===First epoch (1908–1919): Algebraic invariant theory===\n[[File:Emmy Noether - Table of invariants 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Table&nbsp;2 from Noether's dissertation {{Sfn|Noether|1908}} on invariant theory. This table collects 202 of the 331&nbsp;invariants of ternary biquadratic forms. These forms are graded in two variables ''x'' and ''u''. The horizontal direction of the table lists the invariants with increasing grades in ''x'', while the vertical direction lists them with increasing grades in ''u''.]]\nMuch of Noether's work in the first epoch of her career was associated with [[invariant theory]], principally [[algebraic invariant theory]]. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid yardstick is rotated, the coordinates (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>) of its endpoints change, but its length ''L'' given by the formula  ''L''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;Δ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;Δ''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;Δ''z''<sup>2</sup> remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century, prompted in part by [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]], according to which different types of [[geometry]] should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the [[cross-ratio]] of [[projective geometry]].\n\nAn example of an ''invariant'' is the [[discriminant]] ''B''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;4 ''A C'' of a binary [[quadratic form]] '''x·'''A '''x'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;'''y·'''B '''x'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;'''y·'''C '''y'''&nbsp;, where '''x''' and '''y''' are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and \"'''·'''\" is the [[dot product]] or \"[[inner product]]\" for the vectors. A, B, and C are [[linear operator]]s on the vectors – typically [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].\n\nThe discriminant is called \"invariant\" because it is not changed by linear substitutions '''''x'''''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''a'' '''''x'''''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b'' '''''y''''', ''y''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''c'' '''x'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d'' '''y''' with determinant ''a'' ''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''b'' ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;. These substitutions form the [[special linear group]] ''SL''<sub>2</sub>.<ref group=lower-alpha>There are no invariants under the [[general linear group]] of all invertible linear transformations because these transformations can be multiplication by a scaling factor. To remedy this, classical invariant theory also considered ''relative invariants'', which were forms invariant up to a scale factor.</ref>\n\nOne can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged by the action of ''SL''<sub>2</sub>; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant.\n\nMore generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A<sub>0</sub> ''x''<sup>r</sup> ''y''<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;A<sub>r</sub> x<sup>0</sup> ''y''<sup>r</sup> of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;A<sub>r</sub>, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.\n\nOne of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the \"''finite basis problem''\". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called ''generators'', and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms.\n\nNoether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the \"king of invariant theory\", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables.{{sfn |Noether|1914|p=11}}{{Sfn |Gordan| 1870}} He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables.{{Sfn | Weyl | 1944|pp = 618–21}}{{Sfn |Hilbert|1890|p= 531}} Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the [[special orthogonal group]].{{Sfn |Hilbert | 1890 | p = 532}}\n\n===First epoch (1908–1919): Galois theory===\n[[Galois theory]] concerns transformations of [[field (mathematics)|number fields]] that [[permutation|permute]] the roots of an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable ''x'' of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] ''n'', in which the coefficients are drawn from some [[ground field]], which might be, for example, the field of [[real number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or the [[integer]]s [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&nbsp;7. There may or may not be choices of ''x'', which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called [[root of a function|roots]]. If the polynomial is ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of ''x'' makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is [[field extension|extended]], however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree.\n\nContinuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, +''i'' and −''i'', where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], that is, ''i''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;−1&nbsp;. More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial.\n\nThe [[Galois group]] of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial. (In mathematical jargon, these transformations are called [[automorphism]]s.) The Galois group of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and [[complex conjugation]], which sends +''i'' to −''i''. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a [[permutation]] of the ''n'' roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the [[subgroup]]s of the Galois group.\n\nIn 1918, Noether published a paper on the [[inverse Galois problem]].<ref>{{harvnb|Noether|1918}}.</ref> Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to \"[[Noether's problem]]\", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup ''G'' of the [[symmetric group|permutation group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> acting on the field  ''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...&nbsp;,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) always is a pure [[transcendental extension]] of the field ''k''. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper,<ref>{{harvnb|Noether|1913}}.</ref> where she attributed the problem to her colleague [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer|Fischer]].) She showed this was true for  ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, 3, or 4. In 1969, [[R.G. Swan]] found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with  ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;47 and ''G'' a [[cyclic group]] of order&nbsp;47<ref>{{harvnb|Swan|1969|p=148}}.</ref> (although this group can be realized as a [[Galois group]] over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.<ref>{{Harvnb|Malle|Matzat|1999}}.</ref>\n\n===First epoch (1908–1919): Physics===\n{{main|Noether's theorem|Conservation law (physics)|Constant of motion}}\n\nNoether was brought to [[Göttingen]] in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding [[general relativity]], a geometrical theory of [[gravitation]] developed mainly by [[Albert Einstein]]. Hilbert had observed that the [[conservation of energy]] seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern [[theoretical physics]], with [[Noether's theorem|Noether's first theorem]], which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Noether|1918b}}</ref> She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for ''every'' system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:{{quote|Yesterday I received from Miss Noether a very interesting paper on invariants. I'm impressed that such things can be understood in such a general way. The old guard at Göttingen should take some lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kimberling|1981|p=13}}</ref>}}\n\nFor illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the [[angular momentum]] of the system must be conserved.<ref name=\"ledhill\">{{Harvnb|Lederman|Hill|2004|pp=97–116}}.</ref> The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space [[Conservation of angular momentum|conserves angular momentum]] despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the ''physical laws'' governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]] of [[momentum|linear momentum]] and [[energy]] within this system, respectively.\n\nNoether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern [[theoretical physics]], both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool.<ref name=\"neeman_1999\">{{citation |author-link=Yuval Ne'eman |last=Ne'eman |first=Yuval |title=The Impact of Emmy Noether's Theorems on XXIst Century Physics}} in Teicher (1999){{Harvnb|Teicher|1999|pp=83–101}}.</ref> Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon:<blockquote>If the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.</blockquote>\n\n===Second epoch (1920–1926): Ascending and descending chain conditions===\nIn this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending (''Teilerkettensatz'') or descending (''Vielfachenkettensatz'') chain conditions. A sequence of [[empty set|non-empty]] [[subset]]s ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ''A''<sub>3</sub>, etc. of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is usually said to be ''ascending'', if each is a subset of the next\n:<math>A_{1} \\subset A_{2} \\subset A_{3} \\subset \\cdots.</math>\n\nConversely, a sequence of subsets of ''S'' is called ''descending'' if each contains the next subset:\n:<math>A_{1} \\supset A_{2} \\supset A_{3} \\supset \\cdots.</math>\n\nA chain ''becomes constant after a finite number of steps'' if there is an ''n'' such that <math>A_n = A_m</math> for all ''m''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''n''. A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps.\n\nAscending and descending chain conditions are general, meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage.\n\nFor example: How to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.\n\nMany types of objects in [[abstract algebra]] can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called ''[[Noetherian (disambiguation)|Noetherian]]'' in her honor. By definition, a [[Noetherian ring]] satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a [[Noetherian group]] is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A [[Noetherian module]] is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A [[Noetherian space]] is a [[topological space]] in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.\n\nThe chain condition often is \"inherited\" by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space, are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are likewise, Noetherian; and, ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'', the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. All quotient rings of a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, but that does not necessarily hold for its subrings. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal [[power series]] over a Noetherian ring.\n\nAnother application of such chain conditions is in [[Noetherian induction]]—also known as [[well-founded induction]]—which is a generalization of [[mathematical induction]]. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that ''S'' is a [[partially ordered set]]. One way of proving a statement about the objects of ''S'' is to assume the existence of a [[counterexample]] and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the [[contrapositive]] of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of ''S'' contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the ''minimal counterexample''. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example.\n\n===Second epoch (1920–1926): Commutative rings, ideals, and modules===\nNoether's paper, ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen'' (''Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains'', 1921),{{Sfn | Noether | 1921}} is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a [[commutative ring]].<ref name=\"Gil133\"/> Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician [[Claude Chevalley]] coined the term, ''[[Noetherian ring]]'', to describe this property.<ref name=\"Gil133\">{{Harvnb|Gilmer|1981|p=133}}.</ref> A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the '''[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]''', which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of [[prime number]]s, and that this decomposition is unique.\n\nNoether's work ''Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern'' (''Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields'', 1927)<ref>{{harvnb|Noether|1927}}.</ref> characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the [[Dedekind domain]]s: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0- or 1-[[Krull dimension|dimensional]], and [[Integrality|integrally closed]] in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the [[isomorphism theorem]]s, which describe some fundamental [[natural isomorphism]]s, and some other basic results on Noetherian and [[Artinian module]]s.\n\n===Second epoch (1920–1926): Elimination theory===\nIn 1923–1924, Noether applied her ideal theory to [[elimination theory]] in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the [[polynomial factorization|factorization of polynomials]] could be carried over directly.{{Sfn |Noether|1923}}{{Sfn |Noether|1923b}}{{sfn |Noether | 1924}} Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of [[resultant]]s.\n\nFor illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form &nbsp; M '''v'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''0''' &nbsp; where a matrix (or [[linear transform]]) &nbsp; M &nbsp; (without the variable ''x'') times a vector '''v''' (that only has non-zero powers of ''x'') is equal to the zero vector, '''0'''. Hence, the [[determinant]] of the matrix &nbsp; M &nbsp; must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable ''x'' has been eliminated.\n\n===Second epoch (1920–1926): Invariant theory of finite groups===\nTechniques such as Hilbert's original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper,{{Sfn | Noether| 1915}} Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations &nbsp; ''G'' &nbsp; acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called '''Noether's bound'''. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether's bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is [[coprime]] to &nbsp; |''G''|! &nbsp; (the [[factorial]] of the order &nbsp; |''G''| &nbsp; of the group ''G''). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether's bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number &nbsp; |''G''|&nbsp;,{{Sfn |Fleischmann | 2000 |p = 24}} but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides &nbsp; |''G''|! &nbsp; but not &nbsp; |''G''|&nbsp;. For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called \"Noether's gap\". It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.{{Sfn |Fleischmann|2000|p=25}}{{Sfn | Fogarty |2001|p=5}}\n\nIn her 1926 paper,{{Sfn |Noether|1926}} Noether extended Hilbert's theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert's work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether's result was later extended by [[William Haboush]] to all reductive groups by his proof of the [[Haboush's theorem|Mumford conjecture]].{{Sfn |Haboush|1975}} In this paper Noether also introduced the ''[[Noether normalization lemma]]'', showing that a finitely generated [[integral domain|domain]] ''A'' over a field ''k'' has a set &nbsp; {&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...&nbsp;,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;} &nbsp; of [[algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] elements such that ''A'' is [[integrality|integral]] over &nbsp; ''k'' [''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;... ,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]&nbsp;.\n\n===Second epoch (1920–1926): Contributions to topology===\n[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|250px|A continuous deformation ([[homotopy]]) of a coffee cup into a doughnut ([[torus]]) and back]]\nAs noted by [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in their obituaries, Noether's contributions to [[topology]] illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their [[connected space|connectedness]]. An old joke is that \"''a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug''\", since they can be continuously deformed into one another.\n\nNoether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of [[algebraic topology]] from the earlier [[combinatorial topology]], specifically, the idea of [[Homology theory#Towards algebraic topology|homology groups]].{{Sfn |Hilton|1988|p=284}} According to the account of Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by [[Heinz Hopf]] and by him in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where \"she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle\"{{Sfn |Dick|1981|p=173}} and he continues that,\n{{quote |When ... she first became acquainted with a systematic construction of combinatorial topology, she immediately observed that it would be worthwhile to study directly the [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of algebraic complexes and cycles of a given polyhedron and the [[subgroup]] of the cycle group consisting of cycles homologous to zero; instead of the usual definition of [[Betti number]]s, she suggested immediately defining the Betti group as the [[quotient group|complementary (quotient) group]] of the group of all cycles by the subgroup of cycles homologous to zero. This observation now seems self-evident. But in those years (1925–1928) this was a completely new point of view.{{Sfn | Dick | 1981|p= 174}}}}\n\nNoether's suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others,{{Sfn | Dick | 1981|p= 174}} and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen.<ref name = Hirzebruch>[[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch, Friedrich]]. \"Emmy Noether and Topology\" in {{Harvnb |Teicher|1999|pp=57–61}}.</ref> Noether observed that her idea of a [[Betti group]] makes the [[Euler characteristic|Euler–Poincaré formula]] simpler to understand, and Hopf's own work on this subject{{Sfn |Hopf|1928}} \"bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether\".{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp = 174–75}} Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication,{{Sfn |Noether | 1926b}} where she cites it as an application of [[group theory]].<ref>{{citation |last=Hirzebruch |first=Friedrich |title=Emmy Noether and Topology}} in {{Harvnb | Teicher|1999|p= 63}}</ref>\n\nThis algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in [[Austria]]. In a 1926–1927 course given in [[Vienna]], [[Leopold Vietoris]] defined a [[homology group]], which was developed by [[Walther Mayer]], into an axiomatic definition in 1928.<ref>Hirzebruch, Friedrich, \"Emmy Noether and Topology\" in {{Harvnb |Teicher|1999 | pp = 61–63}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Helmut Hasse.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Helmut Hasse]] worked with Noether and others to found the theory of [[central simple algebra]]s.]]\n\n===Third epoch (1927–1935): Hypercomplex numbers and representation theory===\nMuch work on [[hypercomplex number]]s and [[group representation]]s was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras.<ref name=\"noether_1929\">{{harvnb|Noether|1929}}.</ref>\n\nBriefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of [[associative algebra]]s and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] satisfying [[ascending chain condition]]s. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.<ref name=\"vdWaerden_1985\" >{{harvnb|van der Waerden|1985|p = 244}}.</ref>\n\n===Third epoch (1927–1935): Noncommutative algebra===\nNoether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With [[Emil Artin]], [[Richard Brauer]], and [[Helmut Hasse]], she founded the theory of [[central simple algebra]]s.{{Sfn |Lam | 1981 | pp= 152–53}}\n\nA paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and [[Richard Brauer]] pertains to [[division algebra]]s,<ref name = \"hasse_1932\">{{harvnb |Brauer|Hasse|Noether|1932}}.</ref> which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a [[Hasse principle|local-global theorem]] stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a [[Algebraic number field|number field]] splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their ''Hauptsatz'' (\"main theorem\"):<blockquote>every finite dimensional [[central simple algebra|central]] [[division algebra]] over an [[algebraic number]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] F splits over a [[Abelian extension|cyclic cyclotomic extension]].</blockquote>These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra ''D'' are [[central simple algebra#Splitting field|splitting fields]].{{Sfn | Noether | 1933}} This paper also contains the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]] which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field ''k'' into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over ''k'', are conjugate. The [[Brauer–Noether theorem]]{{Sfn |Brauer | Noether | 1927}} gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.\n\n==Assessment, recognition, and memorials==\n{{further|List of things named after Emmy Noether#Other}}\n[[File:Emmy-noether-campus siegen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Emmy Noether Campus at the [[University of Siegen]] is home to its mathematics and physics departments.]]\nNoether's work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century.

However, his talent did not remain undetected: Ostrowski's mentor,  [[Dmitry Aleksandrovich Grave|Dmitry Grave]], wrote to [[Edmund Landau|Landau]] and [[Kurt Hensel|Hensel]] for help.\n\nSubsequently, Ostrowski began to study mathematics at [[Marburg University]] under [[Kurt Hensel|Hensel]]'s supervision in 1912. During the [[World War I]] he was interned, but thanks to the intervention of Hensel, the restrictions on his movements were eased somewhat, and he was allowed to use the university library.\n\nAfter the war had ended Ostrowski moved to [[Göttingen]] where he wrote his doctoral dissertation and was influenced by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]] and Landau. In 1920, after having obtained his doctorate, Ostrowski moved to [[Hamburg]] where he worked as [[Erich Hecke|Hecke]]'s assistant and finished his [[habilitation]] in 1922. In 1923 he returned to Göttingen, and in 1928 became Professor of Mathematics at [[Basel]], until retirement in 1958. In 1950 Ostrowski obtained Swiss citizenship.

There is an analogous problem in axiomatic theories, namely deciding whether a given axiom is independent of the other axioms.\n\nThe following description of Padoa's career is included in a biography of Peano:\n:He attended secondary school in Venice, engineering school in Padua, and the [[University of Turin]], from which he received a degree in mathematics in 1895. Although he was never a student of Peano, he was an ardent disciple and, from 1896 on, a collaborator and friend. He taught in secondary schools in Pinerolo, Rome, Cagliari, and (from 1909) at the Technical Institute in Genoa. He also held positions at the Normal School in Aquila and the Naval School in Genoa, and, beginning in 1898, he gave a series of lectures at the Universities of Brussels, Pavia, Berne, Padua, Cagliari, and Geneva. He gave papers at congresses of philosophy and mathematics in Paris, Cambridge, Livorno, Parma, Padua, and Bologna. In 1934 he was awarded the ministerial prize in mathematics by the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] (Rome).<ref>Kennedy (1980), page 86</ref>\n\nThe congresses in [[Paris]] in 1900 were particularly notable. Padoa's addresses at these congresses have been well remembered for their clear and unconfused exposition of the modern [[axiomatic method]] in mathematics. In fact, he is said to be \"the first … to get all the ideas concerning defined and undefined concepts completely straight\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=46–47}}</ref>\n\n==Congressional addresses==\n\n===Philosophers' congress===\nAt the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] Padoa spoke on \"Logical Introduction to Any Deductive Theory\". He says\n:during the period of ''elaboration'' of any deductive theory we choose the ''ideas'' to be represented by the undefined symbols and the ''facts'' to be stated by the unproved propositions; but, when we begin to ''formulate'' the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are ''completely devoid of meaning'' and that the unproved propositions (instead of stating ''facts'', that is, ''relations'' between the ''ideas'' represented by the undefined symbols) are simply ''conditions'' imposed upon undefined symbols.\n:Then, the ''system'' of ''ideas'' that we have initially chosen is simply ''one interpretation'' of the ''system'' of ''undefined symbols''; but from the deductive point of view this interpretation can be ignored by the reader, who is free to replace it in his mind by ''another interpretation'' that satisfies the conditions stated by the ''unproved propositions''. And since the propositions, from the deductive point of view, do not state ''facts'', but ''conditions'', we cannot consider them genuine ''postulates''.\nPadoa went on to say:\n:...what is necessary to the logical development of a deductive theory is not ''the empirical knowledge of the properties of things'', but ''the formal knowledge of relations between symbols''.<ref>van Heijenoort 120,121</ref>\n\n===Mathematicians' congress===\n\nPadoa spoke at the 1900 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] with his title \"A New System of Definitions for Euclidean Geometry\". At the outset he discusses the various selections of [[primitive notion]]s in geometry at the time:\n:The meaning of any of the ''symbols'' that one encounters in ''geometry'' must be presupposed, just as one presupposes that of the symbols which appear in ''pure logic''. As there is an ''arbitrariness'' in the ''choice'' of the ''undefined symbols'', it is necessary to describe the ''chosen system''. We cite only ''three geometers'' who are concerned with this question and who have successively ''reduced'' the ''number of undefined symbols'', and through them (as well as through ''symbols'' that appear in ''pure logic'') it is possible to ''define'' all the ''other symbols''.\n:First, [[Moritz Pasch]] was able to define all the other symbols through the following four:\n::1. '''point''' &nbsp; 2. '''segment''' (of a line)\n::3. '''plane''' &nbsp; 4. '''is superimposable upon'''\n:Then, [[Giuseppe Peano]] was able in 1889 to define ''plane'' through ''point'' and ''segment''. In 1894 he replaced ''is superimposable upon'' with ''motion'' in the system of undefined symbols, thus reducing the system to symbols:\n::1. '''point''' &nbsp; 2. '''segment''' &nbsp; 3. '''motion'''\n:Finally, in 1899 [[Mario Pieri]] was able to define ''segment'' through ''point'' and ''motion''. Consequently, ''all the symbols that one encounters in Euclidean geometry can be defined in terms of only two of them'', namely\n:: 1. '''point''' &nbsp; 2. '''motion'''\nPadoa completed his address by suggesting and demonstrating his own development of geometric concepts.

He added [[astronomy]] to his portfolio in 1842, and remained as Harvard professor until his death. In addition, he was instrumental in the development of Harvard's science curriculum, served as the college  librarian, and was director of the [[U.S. Coast Survey]] from 1867 to 1874.\nHe was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] of London in 1852.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=1&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27peirce%27%29|title= Fellow Details|publisher= [[Royal Society]]|accessdate= 27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nBenjamin Peirce is often regarded as the earliest American scientist whose research was recognized as world class.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Stigler|first=Stephen M.|title=Mathematical Statistics in the Early States\n|journal=Annals of Statistics|year=1978\n|volume=6|pages=239–265\n|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344123\n|doi=10.1214/aos/1176344123 |jstor=2958876\n|issue=2}}\n</ref> He was an apologist for [[slavery]], opining that it should be condoned if it was used to allow an elite to pursue scientific enquiry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Auspitz|first=Josiah Lee|title=The Wasp Leaves the Bottle: Charles Sanders Peirce|journal=The American Scholar|date=Autumn 1994|volume=63|issue=4|pages=602–618|url=http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/auspitz/escape.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Mathematics===\nIn number theory, he proved there is no odd [[perfect number]] with fewer than four [[prime factor]]s.\n\nIn algebra, he was notable for the study of [[associative algebra]]s. He first introduced the terms [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]] and [[nilpotent]] in 1870 to describe elements of these algebras, and he also introduced the [[Peirce decomposition]].\n\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, he became known for the statement that \"Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions\".<ref>First line of ''Linear Associative Algebra''</ref> Peirce's definition of mathematics was credited by his son, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], as helping to initiate the consequence-oriented philosophy of [[pragmatism]].  Like [[George Boole]], Peirce believed that mathematics could be used to study [[logic]]. These ideas were further developed by his son Charles , who noted that logic also includes the study of faulty reasoning.  In contrast, the later [[Logicism|logicist]] program of [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to base mathematics on logic.\n\n===Statistics===\nPeirce proposed what came to be known as [[Peirce's criterion|Peirce's Criterion]] for the statistical treatment of [[outlier]]s, that is, of apparently extreme observations. His ideas were further developed by his son Charles.<ref>Peirce, Charles Sanders (1870/1871/1873).</ref>\n\nPeirce was an [[expert witness]] in the [[Howland will forgery trial]], where he was assisted by his son Charles.

He also held a research position at the [[Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy]], and was elected a Member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1992. \n\nHe is best known for his contributions to [[algebra]] and the theory of [[Abelian categories]]. From 1964 to 2007 he collaborated with [[Pierre Gabriel]] on the characterization of abelian categories; their best-known result is the [[Gabriel–Popescu theorem]].  His areas of expertise were [[category theory]], [[abelian category|abelian categories]] with applications to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], [[adjoint functors]], [[Limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]], the theory of sheaves, the theory of [[ring theory|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[polynomial]]s, and [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation theory]]. He also had interests and published in the following areas: [[algebraic topology]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[commutative algebra]], [[K-theory]], [[class field theory]], and [[functional analysis|algebraic function theory]]. \n\nPopescu published between 1962 and 2008 more than 102 papers in peer-reviewed, mathematics journals, several monographs on the theory of sheaves, and also six books on [[category theory|abelian category theory]] and [[abstract algebra]]. In a [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]]-like, energetic style, he initiated and provided scientific leadership to several seminars on category theory, sheaves and abstract algebra which resulted in a continuous stream of high-quality mathematical publications in international, peer-reviewed mathematics journals by several members participating in his Seminar series. His book ''Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules''<ref>Nicolae Popescu. Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules, Academic Press, L. M. S. Monograph No.3, London, 1973, {{ISBN|0-12-561550-7}}</ref> continues to provide valuable information to mathematicians around the world. \n\n==Biography==\nPopescu was married, and there is a surviving wife, Professor Dr. Elena Liliana Popescu and three children. He earned his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] degree in mathematics in 1964, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in mathematics in 1967, both at the [[University of Bucharest]]. He was awarded a [[D. Phil.]] degree (Doctor Docent) in 1972 by the University of Bucharest.\n\nIn 2009 he carried out mathematics studies at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090207023652/http://imar.ro/prez/prez_algebra.html Algebra research group] and also had international collaborations on three continents. He shared many moral, ethical and religious values with another famous mathematician, [[Alexander Grothendieck]], who visited the School of Mathematics in Bucharest in 1968. Like Grothendieck, he had a long-standing interest in category theory, number theory, practicing Yoga, and supporting promising young mathematicians in his fields of interest. He also supported the early developments of category theory applications in [[mathematical biology|relational biology]] and mathematical biophysics/[[mathematical biology]].\n\n==Academic positions==\nPopescu was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of Bucharest in 1968 where he taught graduate students until 1972. Since 1964, he also held a [http://www.imar.ro/~nipopesc/ Research Professorship] at the [[Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy]]; the institute was closed in 1976 by order of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], for reasons related to his daughter [[Zoia Ceaușescu]], who had been hired at the institute two years before.\n\n==Books published==\n* {{ro}} ''Elemente de teoria algebrică a numerelor'', Universitate București, 1968.

In 1940 he was appointed professor in the [[University of Szeged]] and in 1967 moved to the Mathematical Institute of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Budapest]].\n\nHis mathematical work was in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]], especially [[group theory]]. He proved that every finite [[tournament]] contains an odd number of [[Hamiltonian path]]s. He gave several proofs of the theorem on [[quadratic reciprocity]]. He proved important results concerning the invariants of the [[class group]]s of [[Quadratic field|quadratic number field]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Engstrom, Howard Theodore|title=Review: ''Sur les Classes d'Idéaux dans les Corps Quadratiques'' by S.

He successfully generalized [[Hajós's theorem]]. This led him to the investigations of lacunary polynomials over [[finite field]]s, which he eventually published in a book. This work on lacunary polynomials has had a big influence in the field of [[finite geometry]] where it plays an important role in the theory of [[blocking set]]s. He introduced a very general notion of skew product of groups, both the Schreier-extension and the [[Zappa–Szép product]] are special case of. He explicitly determined those finite noncommutative groups whose all proper subgroups were commutative (1947). This is one of the very early results which eventually led to the classification of all [[list of finite simple groups|finite simple groups]].\n\nHe was the president of the [[János Bolyai Mathematical Society]] (1947&ndash;1949). He was awarded the Kossuth Prize twice. He was elected corresponding member (1949), full member (1955) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].\n\n== His books ==\n* Ladislaus Rédei: ''Algebra.

Among his work was an [[incomplete  proof]] ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512337/Paolo-Ruffini</ref>) that [[Quintic equation|quintic (and higher-order) equations]] cannot be solved by [[Nth root|radicals]] (1799<ref>''Teoria Generale delle Equazioni, in cui si dimostra impossibile la soluzione algebraica delle equazioni generali di grado superiore al quarto.''</ref>), and [[Ruffini's rule]]<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Ruffini}}</ref> which is a quick method for [[polynomial division]]. Ruffini also made contributions to [[group theory]]<ref>http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/periodictable/html/Rf.html</ref> in addition to [[probability]] and [[quadrature of the circle]].\n\nHe practiced as both a professor of mathematics ([[University of Modena]]) and a medical doctor<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13220b.htm Paolo Ruffini] --- [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article.</ref> including scientific work<ref>''Memoria sul tifo contagioso.''</ref> on [[typhus]].\n\n==Group Theory==\nIn 1799 Ruffini marked a major improvement for [[group theory]],   developing [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]'s work on permutation theory (\"Réflexions sur la théorie algébrique des équations\", 1770–1771). Lagrange's work was largely ignored until Ruffini established strong connections between permutations and the solvability of algebraic equations. Ruffini was the first to controversially assert the unsolvability by radicals of algebraic equations higher than [[quartic function|quartics]]. This angered many members of the community such as [[Gian Francesco Malfatti]] (1731–1807). Work in this area was later carried on by those such as [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] and [[Galois]] who succeeded in such a proof.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wussing|first1=Hans|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept|date=2007|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=978-0486458687|edition=Dover}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n[[File:Ruffini - Teoria generale delle equazioni, 1799 - 1366896.jpg|thumb|''Teoria generale delle equazioni'', 1799]]\n\n* 1799: \"Teoria Generale delle Equazioni, in cui si dimostra impossibile la soluzione algebraica delle equazioni generali di grado superiore al quarto\" (General Theory of equations, in which the algebraic solution of general equations of degree higher than four is proven impossible).\n* 1802: \"Riflessioni intorno alla rettificazione ed alla quadratura del circulo\" (Reflections on the rectification and the squaring of the circle)\n* 1802: \"Della soluzione delle equazioni algebraiche determinate particolari di grado superiore al quarto\" (On the solution of certain determined algebraic equations of degree higher than four)\n* 1804: \"Sopra la determinazione delle radici nelle equazioni numeriche di qualunque grado\" (Above the determination of the roots in the numerical equations of any degree)\n* 1806: \"Della immortalità dell’anima\" (On the immortality of the soul)\n* 1807: \"Algebra elementare\" (Elementary algebra)\n* 1820: \"Memoria sul tifo contagioso\" (Essay on contagious typhoid)\n* 1821: \"Riflessioni critiche sopra il saggio filosofico intorno alle probabilità del signor conte Laplace\" (Critical reflections on the philosophical essay about probability by Count Laplace)\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Paolo Ruffini}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[8524 Paoloruffini]], asteroid named after him\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ruffini, Paolo}}\n[[Category:1765 births]]\n[[Category:1822 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Viterbo]]\n[[Category:18th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Algebraists]]\n[[Category:Italian mathematicians]]"

Other books of his covered [[projective geometry]] and [[algebraic number theory]]. \n\n==Career==\nSamuel ran a [[Paris]] seminar during the 1960s, and became Professeur émérite at the [[Université Paris-Sud]] (Orsay). His lectures on unique factorization domains published by the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] played a significant role in computing the [[Picard group]] of a [[Zariski surface]] via the work of  Jeffrey Lang and collaborators. The method was inspired by earlier work of [[Nathan Jacobson]] and [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]] another outstanding member of the [[Bourbaki group]]. [[Nick Katz|Nicholas Katz]] related this to the concept of ''p''-curvature of a connection introduced by [[Alexander Grothendieck]].\n\nHe was a member of the [[Bourbaki group]], and filmed some of their meetings. A French television documentary on Bourbaki broadcast some of this footage in 2000.\n\nSamuel was also active in issues of [[social justice]], including concerns about [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] degradation (where he was influenced by Grothendieck), and [[arms control]].<ref name=\"amsletter\"> Pierre Samuel Letter to the American Mathematical Society [http://www.ams.org/notices/200503/commentary.pdf]</ref> He died in Paris in August 2009.<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\nHis doctoral students include [[Lucien Szpiro]] and [[Daniel Lazard]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1958 he was an invited speaker (''Relations d'équivalence en géométrie algébrique'') at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in [[Edinburgh]].

Kronecker was already in some sense aware of some of its aspects. Dedekind originated a terminology in his study of number fields which he and Weber applied to function fields in one variable [Ded-W 1882]. Hensel-Landsberg then provided a first systematic book treatment of basic facts concerning these function fields [Hen-L 1902], using the Dedekind–Weber approach. Artin in his thesis [Art 1921] translated the Riemann hypothesis to the function field analogue (actually for quadratic fields). Several years later F. K. Schmidt treated general analytic number theory including the functional equation of the zeta function for function fields of arbitrary genus [Schm 1931].<ref>{{cite book|author=Lang, Serge|authorlink=Serge Lang|year=2000|publisher=Springer|title=Collected Papers IV: 1990–1996|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjxhoZgOXa0C&pg=PA178}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MacTutor Biography |id = Schmidt_F-K}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schmidt, Friedrich Karl}}\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1977 deaths]]\n[[Category:Algebraists]]\n[[Category:German mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Number theorists]]\n[[Category:University of Freiburg alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n\n\n{{Germany-mathematician-stub}}"

He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1954 and the inaugural [[Abel Prize]] in 2003.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Personal life===\nBorn in [[Bages, Pyrénées-Orientales|Bages]], [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], [[France]], to pharmacist parents, Serre was educated at the Lycée de Nîmes and then from 1945 to 1948 at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]].<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson ''Serre Biography'' http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Serre.html</ref> He was awarded his doctorate from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1951. From 1948 to 1954 he held positions at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] in [[Paris]]. In 1956 he was elected professor at the [[Collège de France]], a position he held until his retirement in 1994. His wife, Professor Josiane Heulot-Serre, was a chemist; she also was the director of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles. Their daughter is the former French diplomat, historian and writer [[Claudine Monteil]]. The French mathematician [[Denis Serre]] is his nephew.  He practices skiing, table tennis, and rock climbing (in [[Fontainebleau]]).\n\n===Career===\nFrom a very young age he was an outstanding figure in the school of [[Henri Cartan]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Serre | first1 = J. -P. | authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2009.0005 | title = [[Henri Cartan|Henri Paul Cartan]]. 8 July 1904 -- 13 August 2008 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 55 | pages = 37–44 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> working on [[algebraic topology]], [[several complex variables]] and then [[commutative algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], where he introduced [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]] techniques. Serre's thesis concerned the [[Serre spectral sequence|Leray–Serre spectral sequence]] associated to a [[fibration]]. Together with Cartan, Serre established the technique of using [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s for computing [[homotopy groups of spheres]], which at that time was one of  the major problems in topology.\n\nIn his speech at the Fields Medal award ceremony in 1954, [[Hermann Weyl]] gave high praise to Serre, and also made the point that the award was for the first time awarded to a non-analyst. Serre subsequently changed his research focus. \n\n====Algebraic geometry====\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a fruitful collaboration between Serre and the two-years-younger [[Alexander Grothendieck]] led to important foundational work, much of it motivated by the [[Weil conjectures]]. Two major foundational papers by Serre were ''Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents'' (FAC),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Serre | first1 = Jean-Pierre | year = 1955 | title = Faisceaux Algebriques Coherents | url = | journal = The Annals of Mathematics | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 197–278 | doi=10.2307/1969915}}</ref> on [[coherent cohomology]], and ''Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique'' ([[GAGA]]).<ref>{{Citation | last1=Serre | first1=Jean-Pierre | author1-link=Jean-Pierre Serre | title=Géométrie algébrique et géométrie analytique | url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=AIF_1956__6__1_0 | mr=0082175 | year=1956 | journal=[[Annales de l'Institut Fourier|Université de Grenoble. Annales de l'Institut Fourier]] | issn=0373-0956 | volume=6 | pages=1–42 | doi=10.5802/aif.59}}</ref>\n\nEven at an early stage in his work Serre had perceived a need to construct more general and refined [[cohomology]] theories to tackle the Weil conjectures. The problem was that the cohomology of a [[coherent sheaf]] over a [[finite field]] couldn't capture as much topology as [[singular cohomology]] with integer coefficients.  Amongst Serre's early candidate theories of 1954–55 was one based on [[Witt vector]] coefficients.\n\nAround 1958 Serre suggested that isotrivial principal bundles on algebraic varieties – those that become trivial after pullback by a finite [[étale map]] – are important. This acted as one important source of inspiration for Grothendieck to develop [[étale topology]] and the corresponding theory of [[étale cohomology]].<ref>{{fr icon}} http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~illusie/Grothendieck_etale.pdf</ref> These tools, developed in full by Grothendieck and collaborators in [[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]] (SGA) 4 and SGA 5, provided the tools for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures by Pierre Deligne.\n\n====Other work====\n[[File:SERRE Jean-Pierre.jpg|thumb|Serre]]\nFrom 1959 onward Serre's interests turned towards [[group theory]], [[number theory]], in particular [[Galois module|Galois representations]] and [[modular form]]s.\n\nAmongst his most original contributions were: his \"[[Serre's conjecture II (algebra)|Conjecture II]]\" (still open) on Galois cohomology; his use of group actions on [[Bass–Serre theory|trees]] (with [[Hyman Bass]]); the Borel–Serre compactification; results on the number of points of curves over finite fields;  [[Galois representation]]s in [[l-adic cohomology|ℓ-adic cohomology]] and the proof that these representations have often a \"large\" image; the concept of ''p''-adic [[modular form]]; and the [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre conjecture]] (now a theorem) on mod-''p'' representations that made [[Fermat's last theorem]] a connected part of mainstream [[arithmetic geometry]].\n\nIn his paper FAC, Serre asked whether a finitely generated [[projective module]] over a polynomial ring is free. This question led to a great deal of activity in [[commutative algebra]], and was finally answered in the affirmative by [[Daniel Quillen]] and [[Andrei Suslin]] independently in 1976. This result is now known as the [[Quillen–Suslin  theorem]].\n\n==Honors and awards==\nSerre, at twenty-seven in 1954, is the youngest ever to be awarded the [[Fields Medal]]. He went on to win the [[Balzan Prize]] in 1985, the [[Steele Prize]] in 1995, the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] in 2000, and was the first recipient of the [[Abel Prize]] in 2003. He has been awarded other prizes, such as the Gold Medal of the French National Scientific Research Centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS).\n\nHe is a foreign member of several scientific Academies (France, US, Norway, Sweden, Russia, the Royal Society, [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1978)<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4781 |title=J.-P.

He studied at the [[University of Breslau]] and the [[University of Berlin]], receiving his Ph.D. from Breslau in 1894. Subsequently, he took positions at Charlottenberg (now the [[Technical University of Berlin]]), Breslau, and the [[University of Kiel]], Germany, where he died in 1928. Steinitz married Martha Steinitz and had one son.\n\n== Mathematical works ==\nSteinitz's 1894 thesis was on the subject of [[projective configuration]]s; it contained the result that any abstract description of an [[incidence structure]] of three lines per point and three points per line could be realized as a configuration of straight lines in the Euclidean plane with the possible exception of one of the lines. His thesis also contains the proof of [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)|Kőnig's theorem]] for regular bipartite graphs, phrased in the language of configurations.\n\nIn 1910 Steinitz published the very influential paper ''Algebraische Theorie der Körper'' ([[german language|German]]: Algebraic Theory of Fields, ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' (1910), 167–309). In this paper he axiomatically studies the properties of [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and defines important concepts like [[prime field]], [[perfect field]] and the [[transcendence degree]] of a [[field extension]]. Steinitz proved that every field has an [[algebraic closure]]. He also made fundamental contributions to the theory of [[polyhedra]]: [[Steinitz's theorem]] for polyhedra is that the 1-[[skeleton (topology)|skeletons]] of convex polyhedra are exactly the 3-[[k-connected graph|connected]] [[planar graph]]s.

He was an [[Augustinian]] who became an early supporter of [[Martin Luther]]. He was later appointed [[professor of mathematics]] at [[Jena University]].\n\n==Life==\n\nStifel was born in [[Esslingen am Neckar]]. He joined the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] and was ordained a priest in 1511. Tensions in the abbey grew after he published  the poem ''Von der Christförmigen, rechtgegründeten leer Doctoris Martini Luthers'' (1522, i.e. On the Christian, righteous doctrine of Doctor Martin Luther) and came into conflict with [[Thomas Murner]]. Stifel then left for [[Frankfurt]], and soon went to [[Mansfeld]], where he began his mathematical studies. In 1524 upon a recommendation by [[Martin Luther]], Stifel was called to the Jörger on [[w:de:Schloss Tollet|Tollet Palace]] in [[Tollet]] close to Grieskirchen, Upper Austria.<ref>publication of kathpress (2013), [http://www.ordensgemeinschaften.at/aktuelles/kultur-aktuell/875-herzogenburger-abt-ueberraschte-evangelische-pfarrer-mit-luther-handschrift?tmpl=component&layout=default letter of Martin Luther to Countess Dorothea Jörger regarding a request of Michael Stifel (in German)]</ref>  Due to the tightened situation in Austria (execution of Leonhard Kaiser in Schaerding), Stifel returned to [[Wittenberg]] in 1527. At this time Stifel started writing a book collecting letter transcripts of Martin Luther. It was completed in 1534.<ref>Michael Stifel, collection of handwritten transcripts (1534), [http://archive.thulb.uni-jena.de/hisbest/receive/HisBest_cbu_00013730 \"Martin Luther Briefe and Sermone; Michael Stifel Passionsharmonie\" (Latin/German)], Wittenberg, digitized version of University Library Jena</ref>\n\nBy intercession of Martin Luther, Stifel became minister in [[Annaburg|Lochau]] (what is Annaburg now). Luther also confirmed the marriage of Michael Stifel and the widow of his predecessor in the ministry. Michael Stifel was fascinated regarding the properties and possibilities of numbers. At [[Annaburg|Lochau]] he had the opportunity to do mathematical studies on [[arithmetic|number theory]] and [[numerology]]. He also performed the so-called \"Wortrechnung\" (i.e. word-calculation), studying the statistical properties of letters and words in the bible, a common method at that time. In 1532 Stifel published anonymously his \"''Ein Rechenbuchlin vom EndChrist. [[apocalypse|Apocalyps]] in Apocalypsim''\"  (A Book of Arithmetic about the AntiChrist. A Revelation in the Revelation). This predicted that [[Last Judgement|Judgement Day]] the world would end at 8am on October 19, 1533. The German saying \"to talk a Stiefel\" or \"to calculate a Stiefel\" (Stiefel is the German word for boot) meaning to say or calculate something based on an unusual track can be traced back to this incident.<ref>[http://oewb.retti.info/oewb-public/show.cgi?lexnr=x7AQ\\3TKPB9KMyeqsV4u645NFKuv3OfMaLLxfWhH0LKU305vr\\\\vww==&pgm_stat=show Stiefel (einen Stiefel reden / schreiben)] Retrieved 01/11/2012</ref> When this prediction failed, he did not make any other predictions.\n\nIn 1535 he became minister in Holzdorf near Wittenberg and stayed there for 12 years. Stifel now continued with serious mathematical studies.  Worth mentioning were \"the Coss\" (the first algebra book written in German) of [[Christoph Rudolff]], which he did in self study and \"the Elements\" of Euclid in the Latin edition by [[Campanus of Novara]].\nA proposal of [[Jacob Milich]], who supported his scientific development. Milich encouraged Michael Stifel to write a comprehensive work on arithmetic and algebra.<ref>Kurt Vogel (1981), [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830904165.html#smen8  Stifel, Michael] Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. on Encyclopedia.com. 6 Dec. 2014 <http://www.encyclopedia.com>{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

It has the first use of [[multiplication by juxtaposition]] (with no symbol between the terms) in Europe.  He is the first to use the term \"[[Exponentiation|exponent]]\" and also included the following rules for calculating powers: <math>q^m q^n = q^{m+n}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{q^m}{q^n} = q^{m-n}</math>.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = arithmetica integra\n | author = Michael Stifel\n | publisher = Johann Petreium, Nuremberg\n | year = 1544\n | page = 237\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fndPsRv08R0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=arithmetica+integra&hl=en&ei=CJVeTozEMonV0QGQ_LH9AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&sqi=2&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false\n }}</ref> The book contains a table of integers and powers of 2 that some have considered to be an early version of a [[logarithm]]ic table.\nStifel explicitly points out, that multiplication and division operations in the (lower) geometric series can be mapped by addition and subtraction in the (upper) arithmetic series. On the following page 250, he shows  examples also using negative exponents. He also realized that this would create a lot of work. So he wrote, that regarding this issue marvelous books could be written, but he himself will refrain and keep his eyes shut.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = arithmetica integra\n | author = Michael Stifel\n | publisher = Johann Petreium, Nuermberg\n | year = 1544\n | page = 249B\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fndPsRv08R0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=arithmetica+integra&hl=en&ei=CJVeTozEMonV0QGQ_LH9AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&sqi=2&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false\n }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = A short account of the history of mathematics\n | author = Walter William Rouse Ball\n | publisher = Macmillan and Co\n | year = 1908\n | page = 216\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=egY6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA216&dq=%22arithmetica+integra%22+logarithms&hl=en&ei=iG9jTIvnN4P78Aagv8nICg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22arithmetica%20integra%22%20logarithms&f=false\n }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Precalculus mathematics\n | author = Vivian Shaw Groza and Susanne M.

He was able to reduce the different cases  known to one case, because he uses both, positive and negative coefficients. He called his method/rule AMASIAS. The letters A, M, A/S, I, A/S each are representing a single operation step when solving a quadratic equation. Stifel, however avoided to show the negative results.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = arithmetica integra\n | author = Michael Stifel\n | publisher = Johann Petreium, Nuremberg\n | year = 1544\n | page = 240B\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fndPsRv08R0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=arithmetica+integra&hl=en&ei=CJVeTozEMonV0QGQ_LH9AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&sqi=2&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | title = Abhandlung über Leben und Werk Stifels / scientific paper regarding life and work of Michael Stifel (in german)\n | author = Bertram Maurer\n | publisher = Kolping-Kolleg Stuttgart\n | year = 1999\n | url = http://www.kk.s.bw.schule.de/mathge/stifel.htm\n }}</ref>\n\nAnother topic dealt with in the ''Arithmetica integra'' are [[negative number]]s (which Stifel calls ''numeri absurdi''). Negative numbers were refused and considered as preposterous by the authorities at that time. Stifel however, used negative numbers equal to the other numbers. He also discussed the properties of [[irrational number]]s and if the irrationals are real numbers, or only fictitious (AI page 103). Stifel found them very useful for mathematics, and not dispensable. Further issues were a method of calculating roots of higher order by using [[binomial coefficient]]s<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Abhandlung über Leben und Werk Stifels / scientific paper regarding life and work of Michael Stifel (in german)\n | author = Bertram Maurer\n | publisher = Kolping-Kolleg Stuttgart\n | year = 1999\n | url = http://www.kk.s.bw.schule.de/mathge/stifel.htm\n }}</ref> and sequences.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*Stifel, Michael (1544).

He made fundamental contributions to [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]], [[invariant theory]], [[number theory]], [[Integer partition|partition theory]], and [[combinatorics]].  He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and as founder of the [[American Journal of Mathematics]].  At his death, he was a professor at [[Oxford University|Oxford]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJames Joseph was born in [[London]] on 3 September 1814, the son of Abraham Joseph, a merchant.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>  James later adopted the surname Sylvester when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States—a country which at that time required all immigrants to have a given name, a middle name, and a surname. \n\nAt the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of [[Augustus De Morgan]] at the [[University of London]]. His family withdrew him from the University after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the [[Liverpool Royal Institution]].\n\nSylvester began his study of mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1831,<ref name=\"ACAD\">{{acad|id=SLVR831JJ|name=Sylvester, James Joseph}}</ref> where his tutor was [[John Hymers]]. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the [[tripos]], for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], and Sylvester could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a [[Smith's prize]].<ref name=\"MenofMathematics\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Men_of_Mathematics.html? | title=Men of Mathematics | publisher=Simon Schuster | author=Bell, Eric Temple | year=1986}}</ref> In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at [[University College London]] and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an [[Master's degree|MA]] by [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Virginia]], but left after less than four months following a violent encounter with two students he had disciplined. He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry.  However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England.\n\nOn his return to England, he was hired in 1844 by the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society for which he developed successful actuarial models and served as de facto CEO, a position that required a law degree. As a result, he studied for the Bar, meeting a fellow British mathematician studying law, [[Arthur Cayley]], with whom he made significant contributions to invariant theory and also [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]] during a long collaboration.<ref>Parshall</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=May 2018}}  He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of ''[[The Times]]''.\n\nOne of Sylvester's lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement, {{harvtxt|Sylvester|1870}} published a book entitled ''[[The Laws of Verse]]'' in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] in poetry.\n\nIn 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to his being a Jew.<ref name=\"ACAD\" />\n\nIn 1876<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Preliminary Outline of Instructions for the Session Beginning October 3, 1876|last = |first = |date = September 1876|journal = Johns Hopkins University.

His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold.

The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the ''Analyst'', which eventually became the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.\n\nIn 1883, he returned to England to take up the [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]] at [[Oxford University]]. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the University appointed a deputy professor to the same chair. He was on the governing body of [[Abingdon School]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/files/abingdonian/1897_April_V002_N005.pdf#page=13|title=School Notes|publisher=The Abingdonian}}</ref>\n\nSylvester died in London on 15 March 1897.

In 1880, the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] awarded Sylvester the [[Copley Medal]], its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the [[Sylvester Medal]] in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in [[Oxford]].\n\nSylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at [[Johns Hopkins University]], is named in his honor.
