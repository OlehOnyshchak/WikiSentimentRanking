He is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley and was Director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) from 1997 to 2007. He was reappointed to this office in 2013, and his term has been extended until July 31, 2022.\n\nBiography\nEisenbud is the son of mathematical physicist Leonard Eisenbud, student and collaborator of renowned physicist Eugene Wigner https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1BGvnTyQA. Eisenbud received his Ph.D. in 1970 from the University of Chicago, where he was a student of Saunders Mac Lane and, unofficially, James Christopher Robson.  He then taught at Brandeis University from 1970 to 1997, during which time he had visiting positions at Harvard University, Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS), University of Bonn, and Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS).  He joined the staff at MSRI in 1997, and took a position at Berkeley at the same time.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005 Eisenbud was President of the American Mathematical Society.\n\nEisenbud's mathematical interests include commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, topology, and computational methods in these fields.  He has written over 150 papers and books with over 60 co-authors.  Notable contributions include the theory of matrix factorizations for maximal Cohen–Macaulay modules over hypersurface rings, the Eisenbud–Goto conjecture on degrees of generators of syzygy modules, and the Buchsbaum–Eisenbud criterion for exactness of a complex. He also proposed the Eisenbud–Evans conjecture which was later settled by the Indian mathematician Neithalath Mohan Kumar.\n\nHe has had 31 doctoral students, including Craig Huneke, Mircea Mustaţă, Irena Peeva, and Gregory G. Smith (winner of the Aisenstadt Prize in 2007).\n\nEisenbud's hobbies are juggling (he has written two papers on the mathematics of juggling) and music. He has appeared in Brady Haran's Numberphile web series.\n\nEisenbud was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006., retrieved 2016 He was awarded the Leroy P.

Lodovico settled in Bologna, Italy and he began his career as the servant of Gerolamo Cardano.  He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics.  Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for quadratic equations and cubic equations, and was mainly responsible for the solution of quartic equations that Cardano published. While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him.  Ferrari retired when young at 42 years old, and wealthy. He then moved back to his home town of Bologna where he lived with his widowed sister Maddalena to take up a professorship of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1565. Shortly thereafter, he died of white arsenic poisoning, according to a legend - because of his sisters.Alan Shuchat; Simon Gindikin. Tales of Mathematicians and Physicists.

Gordan also served as the thesis advisor for Emmy Noether.\n\nA famous quote attributed to Gordan about David Hilbert's proof of Hilbert's basis theorem, a result which vastly generalized his result on invariants, is \"This is not mathematics; this is theology.\"Hermann Weyl, David Hilbert. 1862-1943, Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society (1944). The proof in question was the (non-constructive) existence of a finite basis for invariants. It is not clear if Gordan really said this since the earliest reference to it is 25 years after the events and after his death, and nor is it clear whether the quote was intended as criticism,  or praise, or a subtle joke. Gordan himself encouraged Hilbert and used Hilbert's results and methods, and the widespread story that he opposed Hilbert's work on invariant theory is a myth (though he did correctly point out in a referee's report that some of the reasoning in Hilbert's paper was incomplete).\n\nPublications\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n, available at DigiZeitschirften.\n, available at DigiZeitschirften.\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:1837 births\nCategory:1912 deaths\nCategory:19th-century German mathematicians\nCategory:20th-century German mathematicians\nCategory:German Jews\nCategory:Algebraists\nCategory:People from Wrocław\nCategory:People from the Province of Silesia\nCategory:University of Breslau alumni\nCategory:University of Königsberg alumni\nCategory:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni\nCategory:University of Giessen faculty\nCategory:University of Erlangen-Nuremberg faculty"

      "title": "Hermann Grassmann",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann",
      "text": "Hermann Günther Grassmann (; 15 April 1809 – 26 September 1877) was a German polymath, known in his day as a linguist and now also as a mathematician. He was also a physicist,  neohumanist, general scholar, and publisher. His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties.\n\nBiography\nGrassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus Günter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the Stettin Gymnasium, where Hermann was educated.\n\nGrassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to Prussian universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the University of Berlin, also taking classes in classical languages, philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or physics.\n\nAlthough lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper referred to  as A1 (see references).\n\nIn 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, and mineralogy at all secondary school levels.\n\nIn 1847, he was made an \"Oberlehrer\" or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father's position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked Kummer for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann's 1846 prize essay (see below) contained \"... commendably good material expressed in a deficient form.\" Kummer's report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann's day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics.\n\nStarting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848–49, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, Deutsche Wochenschrift für Staat, Kirche und Volksleben, calling for German unification under a constitutional monarchy. (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on constitutional law, Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction.\n\nGrassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen.\n\nMathematician\nOne of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from Laplace's Mécanique céleste and from Lagrange's Mécanique analytique, but expositing this theory making use of the vector methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the Collected Works of 1894–1911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called linear algebra and the notion of a vector space. He went on to develop those methods in his A1 and A2 (see bibliography).\n\nIn 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece, his Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der MathematikTr. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics], hereinafter denoted A1 and commonly referred to as the Ausdehnungslehre,Tr. Expansion plan teachings which translates as \"theory of extension\" or \"theory of extensive magnitudes.\" Since A1 proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once geometry is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial dimensions; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded.\n\nFearnley-Sander (1979)] describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra\n\nFollowing an idea of Grassmann's father, A1 also defined the exterior product, also called \"combinatorial product\" (in German: äußeres ProduktTr. outer product or kombinatorisches ProduktTr. combinatorial product), the key operation of an algebra now called exterior algebra. (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann's day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry, and the general notion of an abstract algebra had yet to be defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton's quaternions by replacing Grassmann's rule epep = 0 by the rule epep = 1. (For quaternions, we have the rule i2 = j2 = k2 = −1.) For more details, see exterior algebra.\n\nA1 was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked Ernst Kummer for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 Neue Theorie der ElektrodynamikTr. New theory of electrodynamics and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously.\n\nIn 1846, Möbius invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by Leibniz: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed analysis situs). Grassmann's Geometrische Analyse geknüpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik,Tr. Geometric analysis linked to the geometric characteristics invented by Leibniz was the winning entry (also the only entry). Möbius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value.\n\nIn 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as Grassmann's law. Grassmann's work on this subject was inconsistent with that of Helmholtz. Grassmann also wrote on crystallography, electromagnetism, and mechanics.\n\nGrassmann (1861) set out the first axiomatic presentation of arithmetic, making free use of the principle of induction. Peano and his followers cited this work freely starting around 1890. Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works in 1995 (. -- ).\n\nIn 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of A1, hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his linear algebra. The result, Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet [The Theory of Extension, Thoroughly and Rigorously Treated], hereinafter denoted A2, fared no better than A1, even though A2's manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century.\n\nResponse\nIn 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann's ideas. In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.\n\nOne of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann's ideas during his lifetime was Hermann Hankel, whose 1867 Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme\n... developed some of Hermann Grassmann's algebras and Hamilton's quaternions. Hankel was the first to recognise the significance of Grassmann's long-neglected writings ...Hankel entry in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. New York: 1970–1990\n\nIn 1872 Victor Schlegel published the first part of his System der Raumlehre which used Grassmann's approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry. Felix Klein wrote a negative review of Schlegel's book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his System according to Grassmann, this time developing higher geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his Erlangen Program which also expanded the scope of geometry.Rowe 2010\n\nComprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of vector spaces which then could express the multilinear algebra of his extension theory.  To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, Josiah Willard Gibbs urged Grassmann's heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published.Lynde Wheeler (1951), Josiah Willard Gibbs:  The History of a Great Mind, 1998 reprint, Woodbridge, CT:  Ox Bow, pp. 113-116.  A. N. Whitehead's first monograph, the Universal Algebra (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the exterior algebra. With the rise of differential geometry the exterior algebra was applied to differential forms.\n\nFor an introduction to the role of Grassmann's work in contemporary mathematical physics see The Road to RealityPenrose The Road to Reality, chapters 11 & 2 by Roger Penrose.\n\nAdhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832.\n\nLinguist\nGrassmann's mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. Thirty years after the publication of A1 the publisher wrote to Grassmann: “Your book Die Ausdehnungslehre has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library”. Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. The last years of his life he turned to historical linguistics and the study of Sanskrit. He wrote books on German grammar, collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the Rigveda (more than 1,000 pages) which earned him a membership of the American Orientalists' Society. In modern\nRigvedic studies Grassmann's work is often cited. In 1955 the third edition of his dictionary to Rigveda was issued.\n\nGrassmann also discovered a sound law of Indo-European languages, which was named Grassmann's Law in his honor.\n\nThese philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime; he was elected to the American Oriental Society and in 1876, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Tübingen.\n\nBibliography\n A1: 1844.

This group has growth that is faster than polynomial but slower than exponential. Grigorchuk constructed this group in a 1980 paperR. I. Grigorchuk. On Burnside's problem on periodic groups. (Russian) Funktsionalnyi Analiz i ego Prilozheniya, vol.  14 (1980), no. 1, pp. 53-54 and proved that it has intermediate growth in a 1984 article.R. I. Grigorchuk, Degrees of growth of finitely generated groups and the theory of invariant means. Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR. Seriya Matematicheskaya. vol. 48 (1984), no. 5, pp. 939-985 This result answered a long-standing open problem posed by John Milnor in 1968 about the existence of finitely generated groups of intermediate growth. Grigorchuk's group has a number of other remarkable mathematical properties. It is a finitely generated infinite residually finite 2-group (that is, every element of the group has a finite order which is a power of 2). It is also the first example of a finitely generated group that is amenable but not elementary amenable, thus providing an answer to another long-standing problem, posed by Mahlon Day in 1957.Mahlon M. Day. Amenable semigroups. \nIllinois Journal of Mathematics, vol. 1 (1957), pp. 509-544. Also Grigorchuk's group is \"just infinite\": that is, it is infinite but every proper quotient of this group is finite.\n\nGrigorchuk's group is a central object in the study of the so-called branch groups and automata groups. These are finitely generated groups of automorphisms of rooted trees that are given by particularly nice recursive descriptions and that have remarkable self-similar properties. The study of branch, automata and self-similar groups has been particularly active in the 1990s and 2000s and a number of unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics have been discovered there, including dynamical systems, differential geometry, Galois theory, ergodic theory, random walks, fractals, Hecke algebras,  bounded cohomology, functional analysis, and others. In particular, many of these self-similar groups arise as iterated monodromy groups of complex polynomials. Important connections have been discovered between the algebraic structure of self-similar groups and the dynamical properties of the polynomials in question, including encoding their Julia sets.Volodymyr Nekrashevych. Self-similar groups. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 117. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2005. \n\nMuch of Grigorchuk's work in the 1990s and 2000s has been on developing the theory of branch, automata and self-similar groups and on exploring these connections. For example, Grigorchuk, with co-authors, obtained a counter-example to the conjecture of Michael Atiyah about L2-betti numbers of closed manifolds.R. I. Grigorchuk, and A. Zuk.

He earned a teaching degree from the University of Budapest in 1935. He then took a position at the Technical University of Budapest, where he stayed from 1935 to 1949. While at the Technical University of Budapest, he earned a doctorate in 1938. He became a professor at the Eötvös Loránd University in 1949 and remained there until his death in 1972.  Additionally he was president of the János Bolyai Mathematical Society from 1963 to 1972.\n\nResearch\nHajós's theorem is named after Hajós, and concerns factorizations of Abelian groups into Cartesian products of subsets of their elements.. This result in group theory has consequences also in geometry: Hajós used it to prove a conjecture of Hermann Minkowski that, if a Euclidean space of any dimension is tiled by hypercubes whose positions form a lattice, then some pair of hypercubes must meet face-to-face. Hajós used similar group-theoretic methods to attack Keller's conjecture on whether cube tilings (without the lattice constraint) must have pairs of cubes that meet face to face; his work formed an important step in the eventual disproof of this conjecture..\n\nHajós's conjecture is a conjecture made by Hajós that every graph with chromatic number  contains a subdivision of a complete graph . However, it is now known to be false: in 1979, Paul A. Catlin found a counterexample for ,. and Paul Erdős and Siemion Fajtlowicz later observed that it fails badly for random graphs.. The Hajós construction is a general method for constructing graphs with a given chromatic number, also due to Hajós..

      "text": "Paul Richard Halmos (; March 3, 1916 – October 2, 2006) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician who made fundamental advances in the areas of mathematical logic, probability theory, statistics, operator theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis (in particular, Hilbert spaces). He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. He has been described as one of The Martians.A marslakók legendája - György Marx \n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Hungary into a Jewish family, Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age. He obtained his B.A. from the University of Illinois, majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy, still at the Champaign-Urbana campus; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,The Legend of John Von Neumann. P. R. Halmos. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 80, No. 4. (Apr., 1973), pp. 382–394. he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. Joseph L. Doob supervised his dissertation, titled Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems.Halmos, Paul R. \"Invariants of certain stochastic transformations: The mathematical theory of gambling systems.\" Duke Mathematical Journal 5, no. 2 (1939): 461–478.\n\nCareer\nShortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the Institute for Advanced Study, lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under John von Neumann, which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces, which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.\n\nHalmos taught at Syracuse University, the University of Chicago (1946–60), the University of Michigan (~1961–67), the University of California at Santa Barbara (1976–78), the University of Hawaii, and Indiana University. From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at Santa Clara University.\n\nAccomplishments\nIn a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 Algebraic Logic, Halmos devised polyadic algebras, an algebraic version of first-order logic differing from the better known cylindric algebras of Alfred Tarski and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in monadic Boolean algebra.\n\nIn addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1971 and again in 1977 (shared with W. P. Ziemer, W. H. Wheeler, S. H. Moolgavkar, J. H. Ewing and W. H. Gustafson). Halmos chaired the American Mathematical Society committee that wrote the AMS style guide for academic mathematics, published in 1973. In 1983, he received the AMS's Steele Prize for exposition.\n\nIn the American Scientist 56(4): 375–389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.\n\nHalmos's 1985 \"automathography\" I Want to Be a Mathematician is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America.  He called the book \"automathography\" rather than \"autobiography\", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life.  The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:\n\nIn these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the \"iff\" notation for the words \"if and only if\" and to have been the first to use the \"tombstone\" notation to signify the end of a proof, and this is generally agreed to be the case.  The tombstone symbol ∎ (Unicode U+220E) is sometimes called a halmos.\"The symbol is definitely not my invention — it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.\", Halmos (1985) p. 403.\n\nIn 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia funded the Euler Book Prize, an annual award given by the Mathematical Association of America for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of Leonhard Euler's birth, to John Derbyshire for his book about Bernhard Riemann and the Riemann hypothesis: Prime Obsession.The Mathematical Association of America's Euler Book Prize, retrieved 2011-02-01.\n\nBooks by Halmos\n1942.

      "text": " \n\nThomas Harriot Mathematics Pronunciation Guide (Oxford, c. 1560 – London, 2 July 1621), also spelled Harriott, Hariot or Heriot, was an English astronomer, mathematician, ethnographer and translator who made advances within the scientific field. Thomas Harriot was recognized for his contributions in astronomy, mathematics, and navigational techniques. Harriot worked closely with John White to create advanced maps for navigation.  While Harriot worked extensively on numerous papers on the subjects of astronomy, mathematics, and navigation the amount of work that was actually published was sparse. So sparse, that the only publication that has been produced by Harriot was The Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia. The premise of the book includes descriptions of English settlements and financial issues in Virginia at the time. He is sometimes credited with the introduction of the potato to the British Isles. Harriot was the first person to make a drawing of the Moon through a telescope, on 26 July 1609, over four months before Galileo.\nthumb|Thomas Harriot observing the Moon through his telescope at Syon Park\nAfter graduating from St Mary Hall, Oxford, Harriot travelled to the Americas, accompanying the 1585 expedition to Roanoke island funded by Sir Walter Raleigh and led by Sir Ralph Lane. Harriot was a vital member of the venture, having learned and translating the Carolina Algonquian language from two Native Americans: Wanchese and Manteo. On his return to England, he worked for the 9th Earl of Northumberland. At the Earl's house, he became a prolific mathematician and astronomer to whom the theory of refraction is attributed.\n\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nBorn in 1560 in Oxford, England, Thomas Harriot attended St Mary Hall, Oxford. His name appears in the hall's registry dating from 1577.Stedall, Jacqueline (2003) The Greate Invention of Algebra, Oxford University Press. p.3, .\n\nHarriot started to study navigation shortly after receiving a bachelor's degree from Oxford University. The study of navigation that Harriot studied concentrated on the idea of the open seas and how to cross to the New World from the Atlantic Ocean. He used instruments such as the astrolabe and sextants to aide his studies of navigation. After educating himself by incorporating ideals from his astronomic and nautical studies, Harriot taught other captains his navigational techniques in Raleigh. His findings were recorded in the Articon but was later never found.\n\nRoanoke\nthumb|Title page of A Briefe and True Report of the Newfound Land of Virginia\nright|200px|thumb|Watercolor by John White of Roanoke Indians\nAfter his graduation from Oxford in 1580, Harriot was first hired by Sir Walter Raleigh as a mathematics tutor; he used his knowledge of astronomy/astrology to provide navigational expertise, help design Raleigh's ships, and serve as his accountant. Prior to his expedition with Raleigh, Harriot wrote a treatise on navigation.  He made efforts to communicate with Manteo and Wanchese, two Native Americans who had been brought to England.  Harriot devised a phonetic alphabet to transcribe their Carolina Algonquian language.\n\nHarriot and Manteo spent many days in one another's company; Harriot interrogated Manteo closely about life in the New World and learned much that was to the advantage of the English settlers. In addition, he recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:\n\"Many things they sawe with us...as mathematical instruments, sea compasses...[and] spring clocks that seemed to goe of themselves - and many other things we had - were so strange unto them, and so farre exceeded their capacities to comprehend the reason and meanes how they should be made and done, that they thought they were rather the works of gods than men.\"\n\nHe made only one expedition, around 1585-86, and spent some time in the New World visiting Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina, expanding his knowledge by improving his understanding of the Carolina Algonquian language. As the only Englishman who had learned Algonquin prior to the voyage, Harriot was vital to the success of the expedition. Hariot smoked tobacco before Raleigh, and may have taught him to do so.\n\nHis account of the voyage, named A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, was published in 1588 (probably written a year before). The True Report contains an early account of the Native American population encountered by the expedition; it proved very influential upon later English explorers and colonists. He wrote: \"Whereby it may be hoped, if means of good government be used, that they may in short time be brought to civility and the embracing of true religion.\"  At the same time, his views of Native Americans' industry and capacity to learn were later largely ignored in favour of the parts of the \"True Report\" about extractable minerals and resources.\n\nAs a scientific adviser during the voyage, Harriot was asked by Raleigh to find the most efficient way to stack cannonballs on the deck of the ship. His ensuing theory about the close-packing of spheres shows a striking resemblance to atomism and modern atomic theory, which he was later accused of believing. His correspondence about optics with Johannes Kepler, in which he described some of his ideas, later influenced Kepler's conjecture.\n\nLater Years\nHarriot was employed for many years by Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, with whom he resided at Syon House, which was run by Henry Percy's cousin Thomas Percy.\n\nHarriot's sponsors began to fall from favour: Raleigh was the first, and Harriot's other patron Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was imprisoned in 1605 in connection with the Gunpowder Plot as he was closely connected to one of the conspirators, Thomas Percy.\n\nAround 1605, Harriot was imprisoned for a minimal amount of time due to the crimes involved with the Ninth Earl of Northumberland and the attempted assassination of King James I of England which was also known as the Jesuit Treason. While this was occurring, Harriot continued his work involving mainly astronomy and in 1607, Harriot used his notes from the observations of the Halley's Comet to elaborate on his understanding of its orbit. Soon after in 1609 and 1610 respectively, Harriot turned his attention towards the physical aspects of the Moon and his observations of the first sightings of sunspots.\n\nHarriot himself was interrogated and briefly imprisoned but was soon released. Walter Warner, Robert Hues, William Lower, and other scientists were present around the Earl of Northumberland's mansion as they worked for him and assisted in the teaching of the family's children.\n\nHalley's Comet in 1607 turned Harriot's attention towards astronomy.  In early 1609 he bought a \"Dutch trunke\" (telescope), invented in 1608, and his observations were among the first uses of a telescope for astronomy. Harriot is now credited as the first astronomer to draw an astronomical object after viewing it through a telescope: he drew a map of the Moon on 26 July 1609, preceding Galileo by several months. By 1613 Harriot had created two maps of the whole Moon, with many identifiable features such as lunar craters depicted in their correct relative positions that were not to be improved upon for several decades. He also observed sunspots in December 1610.\n\nDeath\nIn 1615 or 1616, Harriot wrote to an unknown friend with medical expertise, describing what would have been the reason for the eruption of a cancerous ulcer on his lip. This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on Threadneedle Street, where he died. Sources cited below are among several that describe his condition as a cancer of the nose. In either case, Harriot apparently died from skin cancer. It was suspected that Harriot's cancer diagnosis was due to excessive tobacco consumption.\n\nHe died on 2 July 1621, three days after writing his will (discovered by Henry Stevens). His executors posthumously published his Artis Analyticae Praxis on algebra in 1631; Nathaniel Torporley was the intended executor of Harriot's wishes, but Walter Warner in the end pulled the book into shape. It may be a compendium of some of his works but does not represent all that he left unpublished (more than 400 sheets of annotated writing). It is not directed in a way that follows the manuscripts and it fails to give the full significance of Harriot's writings.\n\nThomas Harriot was buried in the church of St Christopher le Stocks in Threadneedle Street, near where he died. The church was subsequently damaged in the Great Fire of London, and demolished in 1781 to enable expansion of the Bank of England.\n\nLegacy\nHe also studied optics and refraction, and apparently discovered Snell's law 20 years before Snellius did, although it was previously discovered by Ibn Sahl; like so many of his works, this remained unpublished. In Virginia he learned the local Algonquian language, which may have had some effect on his mathematical thinking. He founded the \"English school\" of algebra. Around 1600, he introduced an algebraic symbolism close to modern notation, therefore, computation with unknowns became as easy as with numbers.  He is also credited with discovering Girard's theorem, although the formula bears Girard's name as he was the first to publish it.\n\nthumb|Lord Egremont unveils a Plaque commemorating Thomas Harriot at Syon House, West London (July 2009)\nHis algebra book Artis Analyticae Praxis (1631) was published posthumously in Latin. Unfortunately the editors did not understand much of his reasoning and removed the parts they did not comprehend such as the negative and complex roots of equations. Because of the dispersion of Harriot's writings the full annotated English translation of the Praxis was not completed until 2007.\n\nThe first biography of Harriot was written in 1876 by Henry Stevens of Vermont but not published until 1900 fourteen years after his death. The publication was limited to 167 copies and so the work was not widely known until 1972 when a reprint edition appeared. Prominent American poet, novelist and biographer Muriel Rukeyser wrote an extended literary inquiry into the life and significance of Hariot (her preferred spelling), The Traces of Thomas Hariot (1970, 1971). Interest in Harriot continued to revive with the convening of a symposium at the University of Delaware in April, 1971 with the proceedings published by the Oxford University Press in 1974. John W. Shirley the editor (1908-1988) went on to publish A Sourcebook for the Study of Thomas Harriot and his Harriot biography (1983). The papers of John Shirley have been deposited in the University of Delaware Library.\n\nHarriot's accomplishments remain relatively obscure because he did not publish any of his results and also because many of his manuscripts have been lost; those that survive are in the British Museum and in the archives of the Percy family at Petworth House (Sussex) and Alnwick Castle (Northumberland).\n\nthumb|The Thomas Harriot Plaque in the grounds of Syon House (W. London).\nAn event was held at Syon House, West London, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Harriot's first observations of the Moon on 26 July 2009. This event, Telescope400, included the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Harriot by Lord Egremont. The plaque can now be seen by visitors to Syon House, the location of Harriot's historic observations. His drawing made 400 years earlier is believed to be based on the first observations of the Moon through a telescope. The event (sponsored by the Royal Astronomical Society) was run as part of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA).\n\nThe original documents showing Harriot's Moon map of c. 1611, observations of Jupiter's satellites, and first observations of sunspots were on display at the Science Museum, London, from 23 July 2009 until the end of the IYA.\n\nThe observatory in the campus of the College of William & Mary is named in Harriot's honour. A crater on the Moon was belatedly named after him in 1970; it is on the Moon's far side and hence unobservable from Earth.\n\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Harriot for this planet. (55 Cancri in the constellation Cancer). The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors the astronomer.\n\nThe Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences at East Carolina University in Greenville, NC is named in recognition of this Harriot's scientific contributions to the New World such as his work A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.\n\n Telescope and Moon Mapping \nlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harriot_Lunar_Map.jpg|thumb|Harriot's illustration of the Moon from 1609.\nOn July 26th 2009, Harriot was recognized as the first person to draw his observations of the Moon by the use of his own telescope. The descriptions recorded by Harriot contained easily identifiable errors such as the discrepancy regarding which parts of the Moon were supposed to be dark and light. The descriptions of the moon were modified by the more detailed works of Galileo. Harriot also fails to mention or incorporate a description of the Moon that details what one would see during a lunar eclipse. Critics such as Terrie Bloom, accused Harriot of plagiarizing depictions directly from Galileo's works and argued that Harriot's representation of the Moon was an inadequate representation that needed to be improved.  However, both descriptions were also deemed valuable due to the scientists focusing on different specific observations. Galileo describes the arrangement in a topographical way while Harriot used cartographical concepts to illustrate his views of the Moon. Harriot used a 6X Dutch telescope for his observations of the Moon. Harriot's recordings and descriptions were very simple with minimal detail causing his sketches to be difficult to analyze by later scientists. Furthermore, there was controversy regarding Harriot's depiction and position of the craters as well as the terminating line between the dark and light parts of the Moon. While Harriot's contributions were known to precede Galileo's observations by months, Harriot's lack of publication until 1784 caused Galileo to attain a greater amount of recognition. Galileo's competing astronomical observations regarding the Moon were published in his book Sidereus Nuncius in 1610. Harriot's lack of publication is presumed to be connected to the issues with the Ninth Earl of Northumberland and the Gunpowder Plot. Harriot was also known to have read and admired the work of Galileo in Sidereus Nuncius and continued his observations of the Moon until 1612.\n\n Sunspots \nThomas Harriot is recognized as the first person to observe sunspots in 1610 with the use of a telescope. Harriot observed the sunspot with the use of a telescope in a direct and hazardous way. Even though Harriot observed the sun directly through his telescope, there was no recorded injuries to his eyes. Harriot's depiction of the sunspots were documented in 199 drawings that provided details about the solar rotation and its acceleration. Like many of Harriot's other notes, depictions of the sunspots were not published. Similar to the early observation of the Moon, Galileo was also known to contribute his observations of sunspots and published his findings in 1613. The specifics as to how Harriot's telescope was set up remains largely unknown. However, it is known that Harriot used different magnifications of telescopes with 10X and 20X power being used most often. Harriot chose to observe the sunspots after sunrise because it made the vertical easier to analyze. According to Harriot's notes there was a total of 690 observations of sunspots recorded. Harriot's findings challenged the idea of the unchanging heavens by explaining the Sun's axial rotation and provided further support for the heliocentric theory.\n\n Compounding \nAround 1620, Harriot's unpublished papers includes the early basis of continuous compounding. Harriot uses modern mathematical concepts to explain the process behind continuous compounding. The concept of compounded interest occurs when the more times interest is added within the year assuming the rate stays the same then the final interest will be larger. Based on this observation, Harriot created mathematical equations that included logarithms and series calculations to illustrate his concepts.\n\n See also \n The School of Night\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n\n Thomas Harriot: Trumpeter of Roanoke\n Thomas Harriot\n\nWorks by Thomas Harriot\n \n \n \n A Brief and True Report online pdf text edition\n A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia from American Studies at the University of Virginia.\n Annotated Translation of Harriot's Praxis by Ian Bruce\n\nWorks or sites about Thomas Harriot\n \n Harriot, Thomas\n The Englishman who beat Galileo\n The Soft Logic of Thomas Harriot\n The Thomas Harriot Seminar\n Searching for the Lost Colony Blog\n The Harriot Voyages of Discovery Lecture Series at East Carolina University\n The Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC\n Thomas Harriot Quintessential Renaissance Scholar\n Account of the Roanoke settlements Retrieved April 2011\n\nCategory:1560 births\nCategory:1621 deaths\nCategory:16th-century astrologers\nCategory:16th-century English mathematicians\nCategory:17th-century astrologers\nCategory:17th-century English mathematicians\nCategory:17th-century English people\nCategory:Algebraists\nCategory:Alumni of St Mary Hall, Oxford\nCategory:Atomists\nCategory:Creators of writing systems\nCategory:Deaths from cancer in England\nCategory:Deaths from skin cancer\nCategory:English astrologers\nCategory:English astronomers\nCategory:English scientists\nCategory:People from Oxford\nCategory:People of the Elizabethan era\nCategory:People of the Stuart period\nCategory:Scientific instrument makers"

      "text": "Charles Hermite () FRS FRSE MIAS (24 December 1822 – 14 January 1901) was a French mathematician who did research concerning number theory, quadratic forms, invariant theory, orthogonal polynomials, elliptic functions, and algebra.\n\nHermite polynomials, Hermite interpolation, Hermite normal form, Hermitian operators, and cubic Hermite splines are named in his honor.  One of his students was Henri Poincaré.\n\nHe was the first to prove that e, the base of natural logarithms, is a transcendental number.  His methods were used later by Ferdinand von Lindemann to prove that π is transcendental.\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, Hermite remarked, \"I turn with terror and horror from this lamentable scourge of continuous functions with no derivatives.\"\n\nThe Hermite crater near the Moon's north pole is named in his honor.\n\nLife\nHermite was born in Dieuze, Moselle, on 24 December 1822, with a deformity in his right foot that would impair his gait throughout his life. He was the sixth of seven children of Ferdinand Hermite and his wife, Madeleine née Lallemand. Ferdinand worked in the drapery business of Madeleine's family while also pursuing a career as an artist. The drapery business relocated to  Nancy in 1828, and so did the family.\n\nleft|thumb|Charles Hermite circa 1887\nHermite obtained his secondary education at Collège de Nancy and then, in Paris, at  Collège Henri IV and at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. He read some of Joseph-Louis Lagrange's writings on the solution of numerical equations and Carl Friedrich Gauss's publications on number theory. \n\nHermite wanted to take his higher education at École Polytechnique, a military academy renowned for excellence in mathematics, science, and engineering. Tutored by mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan, Hermite devoted a year to preparing for the notoriously difficult  entrance examination. In 1842 he was admitted to the school. However, after one year the school would not allow Hermite to continue his studies there because of his deformed foot. He struggled to regain his admission to the school, but the administration imposed strict conditions. Hermite did not accept this, and he quit the École Polytechnique without graduating.\n\nIn 1842, Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques published Hermite's first original contribution to mathematics, a simple proof of Niels Abel's proposition of concerning the impossibility of an algebraic solution to equations of the fifth  degree.\n\nA correspondence with Carl Jacobi, begun in 1843 and continued the next year, resulted in the insertion, in the complete edition of Jacobi's works, of two articles by Hermite, one concerning the extension to Abelian functions of one of the theorems of Abel on elliptic functions, and the other concerning the transformation of elliptic functions.\n\nAfter spending five years working privately towards his degree, in which he befriended eminent mathematicians Joseph Bertrand, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and Joseph Liouville, he took and passed the examinations for the baccalauréat, which he was awarded in 1847. He married Joseph Bertrand's sister, Louise Bertrand, in 1848.\n\nIn 1848, Hermite returned to the École Polytechnique as répétiteur and examinateur d'admission. In 1856 he contracted smallpox. Through the influence of Augustin-Louis Cauchy and of a nun who nursed him, he resumed the practice of his Catholic faith. In July 1848, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1869, he succeeded Jean-Marie Duhamel as professor of mathematics, both at the École Polytechnique, where he remained until 1876, and at the University of Paris, where he remained until his death. From 1862 to 1873 he was lecturer at the École Normale Supérieure. Upon his 70th birthday, he was promoted to grand officer in the French Legion of Honour. \n\nHermite died in Paris on 14 January 1901, aged 78.\n\nContribution to mathematics\nAn inspiring teacher, Hermite strove to cultivate admiration for simple beauty and discourage rigorous minutiae. His correspondence with Thomas Stieltjes testifies to the great aid he gave those beginning scientific life. His published courses of lectures have exercised a great influence. His important original contributions to pure mathematics, published in the major mathematical journals of the world, dealt chiefly with Abelian and elliptic functions and the theory of numbers. During 1858 he solved the equation of the fifth degree by elliptic functions; and during 1873 he proved e, the base of the natural system of logarithms, to be transcendental. This last was used by Ferdinand von Lindemann to prove during 1882 the same for π.\n\nPublications\nThe following is a list of his works:\n \"Sur quelques applications des fonctions elliptiques\", Paris, 1855; Page images from Cornell.\n \"Cours d'Analyse de l'École Polytechnique.

McLaughlin Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan.\n\nEducation\nHochster attended Stuyvesant High School, where he was captain of the Math Team, and received a B.A. from Harvard University.  While at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow in 1960.  He earned his Ph.D. in 1967 from Princeton University, where he wrote a dissertation under Goro Shimura characterizing the prime spectra of commutative rings.\n\nCareer\nHe held positions at the University of Minnesota and Purdue University before joining the faculty at Michigan in 1977. \n\nHochster's work is primarily in commutative algebra, especially the study of modules over local rings.  He has established classic theorems concerning Cohen-Macaulay rings, invariant theory and homological algebra.  For example, the Hochster-Roberts theorem states that the invariant ring of a linearly reductive group acting on a regular ring is Cohen-Macaulay.  His best-known work is on the homological conjectures, many of which he established for local rings containing a field, thanks to his proof of the existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules and his technique of reduction to prime characteristic.  His most recent work on tight closure, introduced in 1986 with Craig Huneke, has found unexpected applications throughout commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\n\nHe has had more than 40 doctoral students, and the Association for Women in Mathematics has pointed out his outstanding role in mentoring women students pursuing a career in mathematics. He served as the chair of the department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan from 2008 to 2017.\n\nAwards\nHochster shared the 1980 Cole Prize with Michael Aschbacher, received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981, and has been a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1992.

Her tenure at the university, along with that of colleague Goldie Printis Horton, is recognized by an annual lecture series..\n\nWhile at the University of Texas, she met geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, when he asked her for help modeling the mathematics of mutation in flies.. The couple married in 1923. Their son David, who would become a mathematician and computer scientist, was born the following year. Jessie's university appointment was terminated in 1924 against her wishes: her departmental colleagues felt that academia and motherhood were incompatible. Her own teaching career over, Jessie collaborated with her husband in the Drosophila laboratory and co-authored an article with him. Muller would later win a Nobel prize for the research he performed with Jessie's assistance during this period.\n\nThe marriage had grown strained, but in 1933 Jessie joined Hermann Muller in Berlin and then Leningrad for a portion of his Guggenheim fellowship. She divorced her husband in 1935 (first in the Soviet Union, then in Texas) and within a few months remarried Carlos Alberto Offermann. He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933-1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County.\n\nIn 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago.

He came to England in 1938 as a refugee on the Kindertransport. From there he was interned as an enemy alien and deported to a prison work camp in New Brunswick, Canada. There, he began in his spare time a mathematical apprenticeship with Fritz Rothberger, also\ninterned, and wrote the McGill Junior Matriculation in fall of 1941. In the spring of 1942, he was released and settled in Montreal, where he entered studies at McGill University, graduating with an honours mathematics degree in 1945 and an M.Sc. a year later. In 1950, he completed his doctorate under Hans Zassenhaus becoming McGill's first Ph.D. in mathematics. \n\nLambek became assistant professor at McGill; he was made a full professor in 1963. He spent his sabbatical year 1965–66 in at the Institute for Mathematical Research at ETH Zurich, where Beno Eckmann had gathered together a group of researchers interested in algebraic topology and category theory, including Bill Lawvere. There Lambek reoriented his research into category theory.\n\nLambek retired in 1992 but continued his involvement at McGill's mathematics department. In 2000 a festschrift celebrating Lambek's contributions to mathematical structures in computer science was published. On the occasion of Lambek's 90th birthday, a collection Categories and Types in Logic, Language, and Physics was produced in tribute to him.\n\n Scholarly work \nLambek's PhD thesis investigated vector fields using the biquaternion algebra and in Minkowski space, as well as semigroup immersion in a group.

      "text": "Emanuel Lasker (December 24, 1868 – January 11, 1941) was a German chess player, mathematician, and philosopher who was World Chess Champion for 27 years, from 1894 to 1921, the longest reign of any officially recognised World Chess Champion in history. In his prime, Lasker was one of the most dominant champions, and he is still generally regarded as one of the strongest players ever.\n\nHis contemporaries used to say that Lasker used a \"psychological\" approach to the game, and even that he sometimes deliberately played inferior moves to confuse opponents. Recent analysis, however, indicates that he was ahead of his time and used a more flexible approach than his contemporaries, which mystified many of them. Lasker knew contemporary analyses of openings well but disagreed with many of them. He published chess magazines and five chess books, but later players and commentators found it difficult to draw lessons from his methods.\n\nLasker made contributions to the development of other games. He was a first-class contract bridge playerA detailed examination of Emanuel Lasker’s involvement in bridge is provided by the chapter Nicht nur Schach Emanuel Lasker als Bridgespieler by Robert van de Velde on pages 332-363 of Emanuel Lasker Denker Weltenbürger Schachweltmeister edited by Richard Forster, Stefan Hansen and Michael Negele (Berlin, 2009). and wrote about bridge, Go, and his own invention, Lasca. His books about games presented a problem that is still considered notable in the mathematical analysis of card games. Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his contributions to commutative algebra, which included proving the primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings. His philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote, however, received little attention.\n\n Life and career \n\n Early years 1868–1894 \nthumb|left|upright|Lasker as a young man\nEmanuel Lasker was born on December 24, 1868 at Berlinchen in Neumark (now Barlinek in Poland), the son of a Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s. To supplement their income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, especially at the Café Kaiserhof.\n\nLasker shot up through the chess rankings in 1889, when he won the Café Kaiserhof's annual Winter tournament 1888/89 and the Hauptturnier A (\"second division\" tournament) at the sixth DSB Congress (German Chess Federation's congress) held in Breslau. Winning the Hauptturnier earned Lasker the title of \"master\".  The candidates were divided into two groups of ten. The top four in each group competed in a final. Lasker won his section, with 2½ points more than his nearest rival. However, scores were reset to 0 for the final. With two rounds to go, Lasker trailed the leader, Viennese amateur von Feierfeil, by 1½ points. Lasker won both of his final games, while von Feierfeil lost in the penultimate round (being mated in 121 moves after the position was reconstructed incorrectly following an adjournment) and drew in the last round. The two players were now tied. Lasker won a playoff and garnered the master title. This enabled him to play in master-level tournaments and thus launched his chess career.\"The Start of a Chess Career\", from Lasker & His Contemporaries, issue 1, published by Thinkers Press, Inc.\n\nLasker finished second in an international tournament at Amsterdam, ahead of some well-known masters, including Isidore Gunsberg (assessed as the second strongest player in the world at that time by Chessmetrics). In 1890 he finished third in Graz, then shared first prize with his brother Berthold in a tournament in Berlin. In spring 1892, he won two tournaments in London, the second and stronger of these without losing a game. At New York City 1893, he won all thirteen games, one of the few times in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournament.\n\nthumb|right|300px|The players and tournament officials at the New York 1893 tournament\nHis record in matches was equally impressive: at Berlin in 1890 he drew a short play-off match against his brother Berthold; and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893, mostly against top-class opponents: Curt von Bardeleben (1889; ranked 9th best player in the world by Chessmetrics at that time), Jacques Mieses (1889; ranked 11th), Henry Edward Bird (1890; then 60 years old; ranked 29th), Berthold Englisch (1890; ranked 18th), Joseph Henry Blackburne (1892, without losing a game; Blackburne was aged 51 then, but still 9th in the world), Jackson Showalter (1892–93; 22nd) and Celso Golmayo Zúpide (1893; 29th). Chessmetrics calculates that Emanuel Lasker became the world's strongest player in mid-1890, and that he was in the top ten from the very beginning of his recorded career in 1889.\n\nIn 1892 Lasker founded the first of his chess magazines, The London Chess Fortnightly, which was published from August 15, 1892 to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893 there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with the printer. Shortly after its last issue Lasker traveled to the US, where he spent the next two years.\n\nLasker challenged Siegbert Tarrasch, who had won three consecutive strong international tournaments (Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, and Dresden 1892), to a match. Tarrasch haughtily declined, stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle by attempting to win one or two major international events.\n\n Chess competition 1894–1918 \n\n Matches against Steinitz \nthumb|upright|Wilhelm Steinitz, whom Lasker beat in World Championship matches in 1894 and 1896\nRebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker challenged the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to a match for the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 valuesUsing incomes for the adjustment factor, as the outcome depended on a few months' hard work by the players; if prices are used for the conversion, the result is over $99,000—see  However, Lasker later published an analysis showing that the winning player got $1,600 and the losing player $600 out of the $4,000, as the backers who had bet on the winner got the rest: ). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz' part, Note: this article implies that the combined stake was $4,500, but Lasker wrote that it was $4,000:  Steinitz may have desperately needed the money. The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz won the second game, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses in the middle of the match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).\n\n Tournament successes \nthumb|left|upright|Sketch of Lasker, c. 1894\nInfluential players and journalists belittled the 1894 match both before and after it took place. Lasker's difficulty in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match comments from Gunsberg and Leopold Hoffer, who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz. One of the complaints was that Lasker had never played the other two members of the top four, Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin – although Tarrasch had rejected a challenge from Lasker in 1892, publicly telling him to go and win an international tournament first. After the match, some commentators, notably Tarrasch, said Lasker had won mainly because Steinitz was old (58 in 1894).\n\nEmanuel Lasker answered these criticisms by creating an even more impressive playing record. Before World War I broke out, his most serious \"setbacks\" were third place at Hastings 1895 (where he may have been suffering from the after-effects of typhoid fever), a tie for second at Cambridge Springs 1904, and a tie for first at the Chigorin Memorial in St Petersburg 1909. He won first prizes at very strong tournaments in St Petersburg (1895–96, Quadrangular), Nuremberg (1896), London (1899), Paris (1900) and St Petersburg (1914), where he overcame a 1½-point deficit to finish ahead of the rising stars, Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine, who later became the next two World Champions.For good measure he also took first prize in a weaker tournament at Trenton Falls in 1906. For decades chess writers have reported that Tsar Nicholas II of Russia conferred the title of \"Grandmaster of Chess\" upon each of the five finalists at St Petersburg 1914 (Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall), but chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources supporting this story were published in 1940 and 1942.\n\n Matches against Marshall and Tarrasch \n\nLasker's match record was as impressive between his 1896–97 re-match with Steinitz and 1914: he won all but one of his normal matches, and three of those were convincing defenses of his title. He first faced Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907, when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).Giffard, p.396\n\nHe then played Tarrasch in the World Chess Championship 1908, first at Düsseldorf then at Munich. Tarrasch firmly believed the game of chess was governed by a precise set of principles. For him the strength of a chess move was in its logic, not in its efficiency. Because of his stubborn principles he considered Lasker as a  who won his games only thanks to dubious tricks, while Lasker mocked the arrogance of Tarrasch who, in his opinion, shone more in salons than at the chessboard. At the opening ceremony, Tarrasch refused to talk to Lasker, only saying: \"Mr. Lasker, I have only three words to say to you: check and mate!\"Giffard, p.397\n\nLasker gave a brilliant answer on the chessboard, winning four of the first five games, and playing a type of chess Tarrasch could not understand. For example, in the second game after 19 moves arose a situation (see diagram) in which Lasker was a pawn down, with a  and . At this point it appeared Tarrasch was winning, but 20 moves later he was forced to resign.Giffard, p.398 Lasker eventually won by 10½−5½ (eight wins, five draws, and three losses). Tarrasch claimed the wet weather was the cause of his defeat.\n\n Matches against Janowski \n\nIn 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, an all-out attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later they played a longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship.Several authors have considered this match as a World Chess Championship, for instance:\n\nMore recent sources consider it was only an exhibition match: Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski unleashed his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, \"Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am afraid I will not do anything good in this match.\"\n\n Match against Schlechter \n\nthumb|upright|Schlechter would have taken Lasker's world title if he had won or drawn the last game of their 1910 match.\nBetween his two matches against Janowski, Lasker arranged another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was a modest gentleman, who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw).Giffard 1993, p. 404  According to Isaak and Vladimir Linder, the match was originally to be a 30 game affair and Schlechter would have to win by a two game margin. They note that the Austrian chess historian Micheal Ehn has established, based on the Viennese sources, that Lasker agreed to forgo the plus two provision in view of the match being subsequently reduced to only 10 games. For proof Ehn quoted Schlechter's comment printed in Allgemeine Sportzeitung (ASZ) of December 9, 1909 \"There will be ten games in all. The winner on points will receive the title of world champion. If the points are equal, the decision will be made by the arbiter.\"\n\nAt the beginning, Lasker tried to attack but Schlechter had no difficulty defending, so that the first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at the middle of the match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing.Giffard 1993, p. 406 Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.\n\n Abandoned challenges \n\nIn 1911 Lasker received a challenge for a world title match against the rising star José Raúl Capablanca. Lasker was unwilling to play the traditional \"first to win ten games\" type of match in the semi-tropical conditions of Havana, especially as drawn games were becoming more frequent and the match might last for over six months. He therefore made a counter-proposal: if neither player had a lead of at least two games by the end of the match, it should be considered a draw; the match should be limited to the best of thirty games, counting draws; except that if either player won six games and led by at least two games before thirty games were completed, he should be declared the winner; the champion should decide the venue and stakes, and should have the exclusive right to publish the games; the challenger should deposit a forfeit of US $2,000 (equivalent to over $194,000 in 2006 valuesUsing average incomes as the conversion factor; if prices are used for the conversion, the result is about $45,000—see ); the time limit should be twelve moves per hour; play should be limited to two sessions of 2½ hours each per day, five days a week. Capablanca objected to the time limit, the short playing times, the thirty-game limit, and especially the requirement that he must win by two games to claim the title, which he regarded as unfair. Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations, and until 1914 Lasker and Capablanca were not on speaking terms. However, at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, Capablanca proposed a set of rules for the conduct of World Championship matches, which were accepted by all the leading players, including Lasker. This cites: a report of Lasker's concerns about the location and duration of the match, in the New York Evening Post, March 15, 1911; Capablanca's letter of December 20, 1911 to Lasker, stating his objections to Lasker's proposal; Lasker's letter to Capablanca, breaking off negotiations; Lasker's letter of April 27, 1921 to Alberto Ponce of the Havana Chess Club, proposing to resign the 1921 match; and Ponce's reply, accepting the resignation.\n\nLate in 1912 Lasker entered into negotiations for a world title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament record for the previous few years had been on a par with Lasker's and a little ahead of Capablanca's. The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.\nThroughout World War I (1914–1918) Lasker played in only two serious chess events. He convincingly won (5½−½) a non-title match against Tarrasch in 1916. In September–October 1918, shortly before the armistice, he won a quadrangular (four-player) tournament, half a point ahead of Rubinstein.\n\n Academic activities 1894–1918 \nthumb|upright|David Hilbert encouraged Lasker to obtain a Ph.D in mathematics.\nDespite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker's only interest. His parents recognized his intellectual talents, especially for mathematics, and sent the adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where he found he also had a talent for chess). Lasker gained his abitur (high school graduation certificate) at Landsberg an der Warthe, now a Polish town named Gorzów Wielkopolski but then part of Prussia. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, Göttingen (where David Hilbert was one of his doctoral advisors) and Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1895 Lasker published two mathematical articles in Nature. On the advice of David Hilbert he registered for doctoral studies at Erlangen during 1900–1902. In 1901 he presented his doctoral thesis Über Reihen auf der Convergenzgrenze (\"On Series at Convergence Boundaries\") at Erlangen and in the same year it was published by the Royal Society. He was awarded a doctorate in mathematics in 1902. His most significant mathematical article, in 1905, published a theorem of which Emmy Noether developed a more generalized form, which is now regarded as of fundamental importance to modern algebra and algebraic geometry. For the relationship between Lasker's work and Noether's see \n\nLasker held short-term positions as a mathematics lecturer at Tulane University in New Orleans (1893) and Victoria University in Manchester (1901; Victoria University was one of the \"parents\" of the current University of Manchester). However, he was unable to secure a longer-term position, and pursued his scholarly interests independently.; also available at . This refers to .\n\nIn 1906 Lasker published a booklet titled Kampf (Struggle),Many sources say Kampf was published in 1907, but Lasker said 1906 -  in which he attempted to create a general theory of all competitive activities, including chess, business and war. He produced two other books which are generally categorized as philosophy, Das Begreifen der Welt (Comprehending the World; 1913) and Die Philosophie des Unvollendbar (sic; The Philosophy of the Unattainable; 1918).\n\n Other activities 1894–1918 \nIn 1896–97 Lasker published his book Common Sense in Chess, based on lectures he had given in London in 1895.\n\nIn 1903, Lasker played in Ostend against Mikhail Chigorin, a six-game match that was sponsored by the wealthy lawyer and industrialist Isaac Rice in order to test the Rice Gambit. Lasker narrowly lost the match. Three years later Lasker became secretary of the Rice Gambit Association, founded by Rice in order to promote the Rice Gambit, and in 1907 Lasker quoted with approval Rice's views on the convergence of chess and military strategy.\n\nIn November 1904, Lasker founded Lasker's Chess Magazine, which ran until 1909.\n\nFor a short time in 1906 Emanuel Lasker was interested in the strategy game Go, but soon returned to chess. He was introduced to the game by his namesake Edward Lasker, who wrote a successful book Go and Go-Moku in 1934.\n\nAt the age of 42, in July 1911, Lasker married Martha Cohn (née Bamberger), a rich widow who was a year older than Lasker and already a grandmother. They lived in Berlin. Martha Cohn wrote popular stories under the pseudonym \"L. Marco\".\n\nDuring World War I, Lasker invested all of his savings in German war bonds, which lost nearly their entire value with the wartime and post-war inflation. During the war, he wrote a pamphlet which claimed that civilization would be in danger if Germany lost the war.\n\n Match against Capablanca \n\nIn January 1920 Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a final clause that allowed him to play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play Akiba Rubinstein for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein's.\n\nA report in the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had resigned the world title in favor of Capablanca because the conditions of the match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. Winter cites: American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) for Lasker's resignation of the title, the ACB theory about Lasker's real motive and Havana's offer of $20,000; Amos Burn in The Field of 3 July 1920, the British Chess Magazine of August 1920 and other sources for protestations that Lasker had no right to nominate a successor; Amos Burn in The Field of 3 July 1920 and E.S. Tinsley in The Times (London) of 26 June 1920 for criticism of the conditions Lasker set for the defense of the title; American Chess Bulletin September–October 1920 for Lasker's and Capablanca's statements that Capablanca was the champion and Lasker the challenger, for Capablanca's statement that Lasker's contract with Rubinstein had contained a clause allowing him to abdicate in favor of Rubinstein, for Lasker's intention to resign the title if he beat Capablanca and his support for an international organization, preferably based in the Americas, to manage international chess. Winter says that before Lasker's abdication some chess correspondents had been calling for Lasker to be stripped of the title. For a very detailed account given by Capablanca after the match, see  When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.\n\nThe match was played in March–April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending. Capablanca's solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a position with an isolated queen pawn but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.\n\nReuben Fine and Harry Golombek attributed this to Lasker's being in mysteriously poor form. On the other hand, Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an \"even and fascinating fight\" until Lasker blundered in the last game, and explained that Capablanca was 20 years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.\n\n European life and travels \nLasker was in his early 50s when he lost the world championship to Capablanca, and he retired from serious match play afterwards; his only other match was a short exhibition against Frank James Marshall in 1940, which Lasker lost. After winning the Moravská Ostrava 1923 chess tournament (without a single loss), the New York 1924 chess tournament (1½ points ahead of Capablanca) and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 (1½ points behind Efim Bogoljubow, ½ point ahead of Capablanca), he effectively retired from serious chess.\n\nthumb|Emanuel Lasker (left) and his brother Berthold Lasker in 1907\nDuring the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, Emanuel Lasker received a telegram informing him that the drama written by himself and his brother Berthold, Vom Menschen die Geschichte (\"History of Mankind\"), had been accepted for performance at the Lessing theatre in Berlin. Emanuel Lasker was so distracted by this news that he lost badly to Carlos Torre the same day. includes an image of part of the original newspaper report. The play, however, was not a success.\n\nIn 1926, Lasker wrote Lehrbuch des Schachspiels, which he re-wrote in English in 1927 as Lasker's Manual of Chess. He also wrote books on other games of mental skill: Encyclopedia of Games (1929) and Das verständige Kartenspiel (means \"Sensible Card Play\"; 1929; English translation in the same year), both of which posed a problem in the mathematical analysis of card games; Brettspiele der Völker (\"Board Games of the Nations\"; 1931), which includes 30 pages about Go and a section about a game he had invented in 1911, Lasca.\n\nIn 1930, Lasker was a special correspondent for Dutch and German newspapers reporting on the Culbertson-Buller bridge match during which he became a registered teacher of the Culbertson system. He became an expert bridge player, representing Germany at international events in the early 1930s, and wrote Das Bridgespiel (\"The Game of Bridge\") in 1931.\n\nIn October 1928 Emanuel Lasker's brother Berthold died.\n\nIn spring 1933 Adolf Hitler started a campaign of discrimination and intimidation against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship. Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, were forced to leave Germany in the same year. After a short stay in England, in 1935 they were invited to live in the USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice who was responsible for the Moscow show trials and, in his other capacity as Sports Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of chess. In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.\nLasker returned to competitive chess to make some money, finishing fifth in Zürich 1934 and third in Moscow 1935 (undefeated, ½ point behind Mikhail Botvinnik and Salo Flohr; ahead of Capablanca, Rudolf Spielmann and several Soviet masters), sixth in Moscow 1936 and seventh equal in Nottingham 1936. His performance in Moscow 1935 at age 66 was hailed as \"a biological miracle\".\n\nJoseph Stalin's Great Purge started at about the same time the Laskers arrived in the USSR.\n\nReturn to the United States and death\nIn August 1937, Martha and Emanuel Lasker decided to leave the Soviet Union, and they moved, via the Netherlands, to the United States (first Chicago, next New York) in October 1937. The next year Emanuel Lasker's patron, Krylenko, was removed from his office and executed. Meanwhile, in the United States Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions, as he was now too old for serious competition. In 1940 he published his last book, The Community of the Future, in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems, including anti-Semitism and unemployment.\n\nLasker died of a kidney infection in New York on January 11, 1941, at the age of 72, as a charity patient at the Mount Sinai Hospital. He was buried at historic Beth Olom Cemetery, Queens, New York. His wife Martha and his sister, Mrs. Lotta Hirschberg, survived him.\n\n Assessment \n\n Playing strength and style \nLasker was considered to have a \"psychological\" method of play in which he considered the subjective qualities of his opponent, in addition to the objective requirements of his position on the board. Richard Réti published a lengthy analysis of Lasker's play in which he concluded that Lasker deliberately played inferior moves that he knew would make his opponent uncomfortable.Réti wrote, \"In analyzing Lasker's tournament games, I was struck by his lasting and at first seemingly incredible good luck. ... There is no denying the fact that over and over again Lasker's exposition is poor, that he is in a losing position hundreds of times and, nevertheless, wins in the end.\" Réti considered, but rejected as too improbable, the \"hypothesis of lasting luck\", finally concluding that the only explanation for Lasker's repeated success from bad positions is that he \"often plays badly on purpose\". Id. Réti concluded that Lasker studied his opponents' strong and weak points, and that, \"He is not so much interested in making the objectively best moves as he is in making those most disagreeable to his opponent; he turns the game in a direction not suitable to the style of his opponent and on this unaccustomed road leads him to the abyss, often by means of intentionally bad moves, as I have previously described.\" Id. at 133. W. H. K. Pollock commented, \"It is no easy matter to reply correctly to Lasker's bad moves.\"\n\nLasker himself denied the claim that he deliberately played bad moves, and most modern writers agree. According to Grandmaster Andrew Soltis and International Master John L. Watson, the features that made his play mysterious to contemporaries now appear regularly in modern play: the g2–g4 \"Spike\" attack against the Dragon Sicilian; sacrifices to gain positional advantage; playing the \"practical\" move rather than trying to find the best move; counterattacking and complicating the game before a disadvantage became serious. The URL is a review by John L. Watson. Another review, with examples, is at \"Lasker's greatest skill in defense was his ability to render a normal (inferior) position chaotic\": ; review including this quotation at  Former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik said, \"He realized that different types of advantage could be interchangeable: tactical edge could be converted into strategic advantage and vice versa\", which mystified contemporaries who were just becoming used to the theories of Steinitz as codified by Siegbert Tarrasch.\n\nMax Euwe opined that the real reason behind Lasker's success was his \"exceptional defensive technique\" and that \"almost all there is to say about defensive chess can be demonstrated by examples from the games of Steinitz and Lasker\", with the former exemplifying passive defence and the latter an active defence.\n\nThe famous win against José Raúl Capablanca at St. Petersburg in 1914, which Lasker needed in order to retain any chance of catching up with Capablanca, is sometimes offered as evidence of his \"psychological\" approach. Reuben Fine describes Lasker's choice of opening, the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, as \"innocuous but psychologically potent\". However, an analysis of Lasker's use of this variation throughout his career concludes that he had excellent results with it as White against top-class opponents, and sometimes used it in \"must-win\" situations.As White in Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez Lasker scored ten wins, three draws and just one loss, to Steinitz in 1894. Lasker also won the three recorded games in which he played the variation as Black; one was against Alekhine, in the 1914 St. Petersburg Tournament, the day before Lasker beat Capablanca. and  Luděk Pachman writes that Lasker's choice presented his opponent with a dilemma: with only a ½ point lead, Capablanca would have wanted to play safe; but the Exchange Variation's pawn structure gives White an endgame advantage, and Black must use his  aggressively in the middlegame to nullify this. In Kramnik's opinion, Lasker's play in this game demonstrated deep positional understanding, rather than psychology.\n\nFine reckoned Lasker paid little attention to the openings, but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz's favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the Ruy Lopez. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the French Defense and 1.d4 with the Queen's Gambit. Lasker also used the Sicilian Defense fairly often. In Capablanca's opinion, no player surpassed Lasker in the ability to assess a position quickly and accurately, in terms of who had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt. Capablanca also wrote that Lasker was so adaptable that he played in no definite style, and that he was both a tenacious defender and a very efficient finisher of his own attacks.\n\nLasker followed Steinitz's principles, and both demonstrated a completely different chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.\n\nIn addition to his enormous chess skill, Lasker was said to have an excellent competitive temperament: his rival Siegbert Tarrasch once said, \"Lasker occasionally loses a game, but he never loses his head.\" Lasker enjoyed the need to adapt to varying styles and to the shifting fortunes of tournaments. Although very strong in matches, he was even stronger in tournaments. For over 20 years, he always finished ahead of the younger Capablanca: at St. Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1925, and Moscow 1935. Only in 1936 (15 years after their match), when Lasker was 67, did Capablanca finish ahead of him.\n\nIn 1964, Chessworld magazine published an article in which future World Champion Bobby Fischer listed the ten greatest players in history.Bobby Fischer, \"The Ten Greatest Masters in History\", Chessworld, Vol. 1, No. 1 (January–February 1964), pp. 56-61. Fischer did not include Lasker in the list, deriding him as a \"coffee-house player [who] knew nothing about openings and didn't understand positional chess\".Fischer, \"The Ten Greatest Masters in History\", p. 59. In a poll of the world's leading players taken some time after Fischer's list appeared, Tal, Korchnoi, and Robert Byrne all said that Lasker was the greatest player ever. Both Pal Benko and Byrne stated that Fischer later reconsidered and said that Lasker was a great player.Brady 1973, p. 79.\n\nStatistical ranking systems place Lasker high among the greatest players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. See the summary list at  In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players based on their performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca). The URL provides greater detail, covering 47 players whom Elo rated, and notes that Bobby Fischer and Anatoly Karpov would have topped the list if the January 1, 1978, FIDE ratings had been included (FIDE ratings use Elo's system). The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive to the length of the periods being compared, and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years. Its author, the statistician Jeff Sonas, concluded that only Kasparov and Karpov surpassed Lasker's long-term dominance of the game. Part IV gives links to all three earlier parts. By Chessmetrics' reckoning, Lasker was the number 1 player in 292 different months—a total of over 24 years. His first No. 1 rank was in June 1890, and his last in December 1926—a span of 36½ years. Chessmetrics also considers him the strongest 67-year-old in history: in December 1935, at age 67 years and 0 months, his rating was 2691 (number 7 in the world), well above second-place Viktor Korchnoi's rating at that age (2660, number 39 in the world, in March 1998).\n\n Influence on chess \nthumb|upright|Lasker at home in Berlin, in 1933\nLasker founded no school of players who played in a similar style. Max Euwe, World Champion 1935–1937 and a prolific writer of chess manuals, who had a lifetime 0–3 score against Lasker, said, \"It is not possible to learn much from him. One can only stand and wonder.\" However, Lasker's pragmatic, combative approach had a great influence on Soviet players like Mikhail Tal and Viktor Korchnoi.\n\nThere are several \"Lasker Variations\" in the chess openings, including Lasker's Defense to the Queen's Gambit, Lasker's Defense to the Evans Gambit (which effectively ended the use of this gambit in tournament play until a revival in the 1990s),Lasker's Defense:  Revival: and the Lasker Variation in the McCutcheon Variation of the French Defense.\n\nOne of Lasker's most famous games is Lasker–Bauer, Amsterdam 1889, in which he sacrificed both bishops in a maneuver later repeated in a number of games. Similar sacrifices had already been played by Cecil Valentine De Vere and John Owen, but these were not in major events and Lasker probably had not seen them.\n\nLasker was shocked by the poverty in which Wilhelm Steinitz died and did not intend to die in similar circumstances.Lasker wrote \"I who vanquished him must see to it that his great achievement, his theories should find justice, and I must avenge the wrongs he suffered\".  He became notorious for demanding high fees for playing matches and tournaments, and he argued that players should own the copyright in their games rather than let publishers get all the profits. These demands initially angered editors and other players, but helped to pave the way for the rise of full-time chess professionals who earn most of their living from playing, writing and teaching. Copyright in chess games had been contentious at least as far back as the mid-1840s, and Steinitz and Lasker vigorously asserted that players should own the copyright and wrote copyright clauses into their match contracts. However, Lasker's demands that challengers should raise large purses prevented or delayed some eagerly awaited World Championship matches—for example Frank James Marshall challenged him in 1904 to a match for the World Championship but could not raise the stakes demanded by Lasker until 1907. This problem continued throughout the reign of his successor Capablanca.\n\nSome of the controversial conditions that Lasker insisted on for championship matches led Capablanca to attempt twice (1914 and 1922) to publish rules for such matches, to which other top players readily agreed.\n\n Work in other fields \nLasker was also a mathematician. In his 1905 article on commutative algebra, Lasker introduced the theory of primary decomposition of ideals, which has influence in the theory of Noetherian rings.He defined the primary decomposition property of the ideals of some commutative rings when he proved that polynomial rings have the primary decomposition property. Rings having the primary decomposition property are called \"Laskerian rings\" in his honor.\n\nHis attempt to create a general theory of all competitive activities were followed by more consistent efforts from von Neumann on game theory, and his later writings about card games presented a significant issue in the mathematical analysis of card games.\n\nHowever, his dramatic and philosophical works have never been highly regarded.\n\n Friends and relatives \nLasker was a good friend of Albert Einstein, who wrote the introduction to the posthumous biography Emanuel Lasker, The Life of a Chess Master from Dr. Jacques Hannak (1952). In this preface Einstein express his satisfaction at having met Lasker, writing:\n\nPoet Else Lasker-Schüler was his sister-in-law. Edward Lasker, born in Kempen (Kępno), Greater Poland (then Prussia), the German-American chess master, engineer, and author, claimed that he was distantly related to Emanuel Lasker. They both played in the great New York 1924 chess tournament.\n\n Publications \n\n Chess \nthumb|Lasker's Chess Magazine cover from November 1906.\n The London Chess Fortnightly, 1892–93\n Common Sense in Chess, 1896 (an abstract of 12 lectures delivered to a London audience in 1895)\n Lasker's How to Play Chess: An Elementary Text Book for Beginners, Which Teaches Chess By a New, Easy and Comprehensive Method, 1900\n Lasker's Chess Magazine, , 1904–1907.\n The International Chess Congress, St. Petersburg, 1909, 1910\n Lasker's Manual of Chess, 1925, is as famous in chess circles for its philosophical tone as for its content.\"\nEmanuel Lasker's Manual of Chess is the most expressly philosophical chess book ever written\" \n Lehrbuch des Schachspiels, 1926 – English version Lasker's Manual of Chess published in 1927.\n Lasker's Chess Primer, 1934\n\n Other games \n Encyclopedia of Games, 1929.\n Das verständige Kartenspiel (Sensible Card Play), 1929 – English translation published in the same year.\n Brettspiele der Völker (Board Games of the Nations), 1931 – includes sections about Go and Lasca.\n Das Bridgespiel (\"The Game of Bridge\"), 1931.\n\n Mathematics \n\n – Lasker's Ph.D. thesis.\n\n Philosophy \n Kampf (Struggle), 1906.\nDas Begreifen der Welt (Comprehending the World), 1913.\nDie Philosophie des Unvollendbar (sic; The Philosophy of the Unattainable), 1918.\n Vom Menschen die Geschichte (\"History of Mankind\"), 1925 – a play, co-written with his brother Berthold.\nThe Community of the Future, 1940.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n Fiction \nIn Michael Chabon's alternate history mystery novel, The Yiddish Policemen's Union, the murdered man, Mendel Shpilman (born during the 1960s), being a chess enthusiast, uses the name \"Emanuel Lasker\" as an alias.

Not a great game, but the one that saved Lasker from losing his world title in 1910.\nEmanuel Lasker vs. Jose Raul Capablanca, St Petersburg 1914. Lasker, who needed a win here, surprisingly used a  opening, allowing Capablanca to  the game early.

      "text": "Saunders Mac Lane (4 August 1909 – 14 April 2005) was an American mathematician who co-founded category theory with Samuel Eilenberg.\n\nEarly life and education\nMac Lane was born in Norwich, Connecticut, near where his family lived in Taftville.. He was christened \"Leslie Saunders MacLane\", but \"Leslie\" fell into disuse because his parents, Donald MacLane and Winifred Saunders, came to dislike it. He began inserting a space into his surname because his first wife found it difficult to type the name without a space.Mac Lane (2005), p. 6.\nHe was the oldest of three brothers; one of his brothers, Gerald MacLane, also became a mathematics professor at Rice University and Purdue University. Another sister died as a baby. His father and grandfather were both ministers; his grandfather had been a Presbyterian, but was kicked out of the church for believing in evolution, and his father was a Congregationalist. His mother, née Winifred Saunders, studied at Mount Holyoke College and taught English, Latin, and mathematics.\n\nIn high school, Mac Lane's favorite subject was chemistry. While in high school, his father died, and he came under his grandfather's care. His half-uncle, a lawyer, was determined to send him to Yale University, where many of his relatives had been educated, and paid his way there beginning in 1926.\nAs a freshman, he became disillusioned with chemistry. His mathematics instructor, Lester S. Hill, coached him for a local mathematics competition which he won, setting the direction for his future work. He went on to study mathematics and physics as a double major, taking courses from Jesse Beams, Ernest William Brown, Ernest Lawrence, F. S. C. Northrop, and Øystein Ore, among others. He graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1930. During this period, he published his first scientific paper, in physics and co-authored with Irving Langmuir.\n\nIn 1929, at a party of Yale football supporters in Montclair, New Jersey, Mac Lane (there to be presented with a prize for having the best grade point average yet recorded at Yale) had met Robert Maynard Hutchins, the new president of the University of Chicago, who encouraged him to go there for his graduate studies and soon afterwards offered him a scholarship. Mac Lane neglected to actually apply to the program, but showed up and was admitted anyway. At Chicago, the subjects he studied included set theory with E. H. Moore, number theory with Leonard Eugene Dickson, the calculus of variations with Gilbert Ames Bliss, and logic with Mortimer J. Adler.\n\nIn 1931, having earned his master's degree and feeling restless at Chicago, he earned a fellowship from the Institute of International Education and became one of the last Americans to study at the University of Göttingen prior to its decline under the Nazis. His greatest influences there were Paul Bernays and Hermann Weyl. By the time he finished his doctorate in 1934, Bernays had been forced to leave because he was Jewish, and Weyl became his main examiner. At Göttingen, Mac Lane also studied with Gustav Herglotz and Emmy Noether. Within days of finishing his degree, he married Dorothy Jones, from Chicago, and soon returned to the U.S.\n\nCareer\nFrom 1934 through 1938, Mac Lane held short term appointments at Yale University, Harvard University, Cornell University, and the University of Chicago. He then held a tenure track appointment at Harvard from 1938 to 1947. In 1941, while giving a series of visiting lectures at the University of Michigan, he met Samuel Eilenberg and began what would become a fruitful collaboration on the interplay between algebra and topology. In 1944 and 1945, he also directed Columbia University's Applied Mathematics Group, which was involved in the war effort as a contractor for the Applied Mathematics Panel; the mathematics he worked on in this group concerned differential equations for fire-control systems.\n\nIn 1947, he accepted an offer to return to Chicago, where (in part because of the university's involvement in the Manhattan Project, and in part because of the administrative efforts of Marshall Stone) many other famous mathematicians and physicists had also recently moved. He traveled as a Guggenheim Fellow to ETH Zurich for the 1947–1948 term, where he worked with Heinz Hopf. Mac Lane succeeded Stone as department chair in 1952, and served for six years.\n\nMac Lane was vice president of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and president of the American Mathematical Society. While presiding over the Mathematical Association of America in the 1950s, he initiated its activities aimed at improving the teaching of modern mathematics. He was a member of the National Science Board, 1974–1980, advising the American government. In 1976, he led a delegation of mathematicians to China to study the conditions affecting mathematics there. Mac Lane was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1949, and received the National Medal of Science in 1989.\n\nContributions\nAfter a thesis in mathematical logic, his early work was in field theory and valuation theory. He wrote on valuation rings and Witt vectors, and separability in infinite field extensions. He started writing on group extensions in 1942, and in 1943 began his research on what are now called Eilenberg–MacLane spaces K(G,n), having a single non-trivial homotopy group G in dimension n. This work opened the way to group cohomology in general.\n\nAfter introducing, via the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms, the abstract approach to homology theory, he and Eilenberg originated category theory in 1945. He is especially known for his work on coherence theorems. A recurring feature of category theory, abstract algebra, and of some other mathematics as well, is the use of diagrams, consisting of arrows (morphisms) linking objects, such as products and coproducts. According to McLarty (2005), this diagrammatic approach to contemporary mathematics largely stems from Mac Lane (1948). Mac Lane also coined the term Yoneda lemma for a lemma which is an essential background to many central concepts of category theory and which was discovered by Nobuo Yoneda.\n\nMac Lane had an exemplary devotion to writing approachable texts, starting with his very influential A Survey of Modern Algebra, coauthored in 1941 with Garrett Birkhoff. From then on, it was possible to teach elementary modern algebra to undergraduates using an English text. His Categories for the Working Mathematician remains the definitive introduction to category theory.\n\nMac Lane supervised the Ph.Ds of, among many others, David Eisenbud, William Howard, Irving Kaplansky, Michael Morley, Anil Nerode, Robert Solovay, and John G. Thompson.\n\nIn addition to reviewing a fair amount of his mathematical output, the obituary articles McLarty (2005, 2007) clarify Mac Lane's contributions to the philosophy of mathematics. Mac Lane (1986) is an approachable introduction to his views on this subject.\n\nSelected works\n 1997 (1941). A Survey of Modern Algebra (with Garrett Birkhoff).

      "text": "Yuri Ivanovitch Manin (; born February 16, 1937) is a Russian mathematician, known for work in algebraic geometry and diophantine geometry, and many expository works ranging from mathematical logic to theoretical physics. Moreover, Manin was one of the first to propose the idea of a quantum computer in 1980 with his book \"Computable and Uncomputable\".\n\nLife and career\nManin gained a doctorate in 1960 at the Steklov Mathematics Institute as a student of Igor Shafarevich. He is now a Professor at the Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik in Bonn, and a professor emeritus at Northwestern University.\n\nManin's early work included papers on the arithmetic and formal groups of abelian varieties, the Mordell conjecture in the function field case, and algebraic differential equations. The Gauss–Manin connection is a basic ingredient of the study of cohomology in families of algebraic varieties. He wrote a book on cubic surfaces and cubic forms, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as nonassociative algebra. He also indicated the role of the Brauer group, via Grothendieck's theory of global Azumaya algebras, in accounting for obstructions to the Hasse principle, setting off a generation of further work. He also formulated the Manin conjecture, which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on Yang–Mills theory, quantum information, and mirror symmetry.\n\nManin had over 40 doctoral students, including Vladimir Berkovich, Mariusz Wodzicki, Alexander Beilinson, Ivan Cherednik, Alexei Skorobogatov, Vladimir Drinfeld, Mikhail Kapranov, Vyacheslav Shokurov, Arend Bayer and Victor Kolyvagin, as well as foreign students including Hà Huy Khoái.\n\nAwards\nHe was awarded the Brouwer Medal in 1987, the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics in 1994, the Schock Prize in 1999 and the Cantor Medal in 2002, and the Bolyai Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2010.\n\nIn 1990 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nWorks\n Manin: Selected works with commentary, World Scientific 1996\n Manin: Mathematics as metaphor - selected essays, American Mathematical Society 2009\n Manin: Rational points of algebraic curves over function fields.

He was home-schooled until the age of 14, when he began studying mathematics at the local school, later moving to the Franklin Select School a few miles away and then to the Franklin Academy, finishing his formal education at age approximately 20. He worked as a farmer, oil driller, and schoolteacher. In 1881, he declined an invitation to become a professor of mathematics at the Normal School in Missouri. In 1885, he became the librarian for the Survey Office of the United States Coast Guard,. Reprinted from the American Mathematical Monthly 1 (4): 108–111, 1894.. Reprinted from the Boston Post.. and in 1898 he became a computer in the Division of Tides. He died on November 7, 1918..\n\nMathematical work\nMartin was a prolific contributor of problems and solutions to mathematical puzzle columns in popular magazines beginning at the age of 18 in the Pittsburgh Almanac and the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post. From 1870 to 1875, he was editor of the \"Stairway Department\" of Clark's School Visitor, one of the magazines to which he had previously contributed. From 1875 to 1876 Martin moved to the Normal Monthly, where he published 16 articles on diophantine analysis. He subsequently became editor of the Mathematical Visitor in 1877 and of the Mathematical Magazine in 1882. In 1893 in Chicago, his paper On fifth-power numbers whose sum is a fifth power was read (but not by him) at the International Mathematical Congress held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 in Cambridge UK.\n\nMartin maintained an extensive mathematical library, now in the collections of American University..\n\nAwards and societies\nIn 1877 Martin was given an honorary M.A. from Yale University.. In 1882 he was awarded another honorary degree, a Ph.D. from Rutgers University, and his third honorary degree, an LL.D., was given to him in 1885 by Hillsdale College.

He is a descendant of the Lithuanian Jewish Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty.\n\nEarly life and education\nMeiselman was born to Harry Meiselman, a dental surgeon, and Shulamit Soloveitchik, a teacher and Jewish school principal who attended New York University and Radcliffe College.\nOn his mother's side, he is a descendant of the Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty. His maternal grandfather was Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik and his maternal great-grandfather was Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, known as Reb Chaim Brisker. His mother, Shulamit, authored the book The Soloveitchik Heritage: A Daughter's Memoir (1995). Meiselman was a nephew of Rabbi Dr. Joseph B. Soloveitchik, rosh yeshiva of R.I.E.T.S., with whom, according to Meiselman, he had study sessions on a near daily basis from the time he was 18 until he was 29 years old.\n\nMeiselman graduated from high school at the Boston Latin School and then went on to attend Harvard University (the undergraduate school which all three of Soloveitchik's children and his American grandchildren attended) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the latter institution, he studied under Dr. Donald Werner Anderson and earned his doctorate in mathematics in 1967 with the thesis \"The Operation Ring for Connective K-Theory\". While Meiselman's sole formal education (including high school through post-graduate school) took place at secular institutions, rather than yeshivot, Meiselman's students report that he was strong in his haredi viewpoint even at this young age. They report that he would often debate teachers of philosophy on points of religion, stressing his strong religious views in an extremely secular environment.\n\nCareer\nMeiselman began his career teaching mathematics at City University of New York. After his marriage in 1971, he became a maggid shiur at Beis Medrash L'Torah in Skokie. Afterward, he taught at Yeshivas Brisk (Brisk Rabbinical College) in Chicago, headed for a time by his uncle, Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik. In 1977 he moved to the West Coast and founded the Yeshiva University of Los Angeles (YULA), opening separate high school programs for boys and girls, a yeshivah gedolah, and a kolel. He also served as a posek (arbiter of Jewish law) for the local community.\n\nIn 1982, having built up enrollment to nearly 400 male and female students in YULA's various divisions, Meiselman moved to Israel to open a yeshiva for American students, together with co-rosh yeshiva Rabbi Doniel Lehrfield (Rabbi Lehrfield and several other faculty members subsequently left to start another yeshiva, Bais Yisroel). He named the new school Toras Moshe after his grandfather, Moshe. He selected Rabbis Michel Shurkin and Moshe Twersky, both close students of Rabbi  Soloveitchik, to head the teaching staff. In 2011, Meiselman reported about his yeshiva that \"We have 96 boys in the beis medrash and 44 in the kollel, and almost all of our kollel yungerleit are home-grown\".\n\nMeiselman is one of several grandchildren of Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik who have established yeshivas in Israel, perhaps the most famous being Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, son-in-law of Rabbi  Joseph Soloveitchik, who established Yeshivat Har Etzion in the late 1960s. Yeshivat Reshit, a popular yeshiva in Israel for American students in Beit Shemesh, was established by the Rabbis Marcus, also descendants of Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik. Unlike these other two yeshivas, however, Toras Moshe discourages its students from attending Yeshiva University, and in fact virtually none of its students continue on to Yeshiva University.\n\nMeiselman is the author of several books and numerous magazine articles. His Jewish Woman in Jewish Law (1978) sparked much discussion among authors and feminists for his traditional Jewish response to feminism. Additionally, Meiselman has authored Tiferes Tzvi, a commentary to the Rambam, as well as numerous articles on Talmudic study and thought in Hebrew.\n\nPhilosophies and controversies\n\nTorah, Chazal and Science\nMeiselman's 2013 book, Torah, Chazal and Science, promotes the theory that all unqualified scientific statements of the Talmudic sages were divinely inspired and are therefore immutable: \"All of Chazal’s (the Talmudic sages') definitive statements are to be taken as absolute fact [even] outside the realm of halakhah (Jewish law)\".Torah, Chazal and Science (Lakewood: 2013), p. 634 The flip side of this thesis, and another major theme of the book, is that modern science is transitory and unreliable compared to the divine wisdom of the sages.\n\nThe Holocaust\nFollowing the opinion of some Haredi thinkers in the area of Holocaust theology, Meiselman has argued that the Holocaust was the result of Jewish cultural assimilation in Western Europe in the early twentieth century. He writes that \"the turning away from the status of an 'am ha-nivhar, a chosen people, and the frightening rush toward assimilation were, according to the rules that govern Jewish destiny, the real causes for the Holocaust\".\n\nThe State of Israel\nMeiselman subscribes to Haredi views regarding the State of Israel and the Israel Defence Forces. He has stated that it is forbidden for a yeshiva student to join the Israeli army, and has criticized the Nachal Haredi, stating in an interview that Nachal Haredi has \"not been successful in maintaining commitment to Torah.\"\n\nIn 2013, Meiselman sat on the dais at a rally in NY against conscription of yeshiva students into the Israeli army. Both Satmar Rebbes were involved in the planning of, and also sat at the dais at, this rally.\n\nModern Orthodoxy\nIn commenting on Modern Orthodox innovations with regard to women, Meiselman has stated that \"when it comes to the rabbis and the people who are at the forefront of pushing for these changes so that they can 'update' Orthodoxy to conform with today’s 'progressive' cultural norm ... [the] common denominator between nearly all of them is that they are largely ignorant of halacha and devoid of serious Torah scholarship. If your knowledge of Torah and halacha are limited, then you are not limited by halacha. One is never confined by things that one doesn't know and never learned!\"\n\nAs stated by one of its faculty members, \"Toras Moshe strongly opposes Y.U. Yeshiva University and actively tries to dissuade its students to enroll there.\"\n\nPersonal\nMeiselman is married to Rivkah Leah Eichenstein.\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nSelected articles\n \n \n \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"Book Review: 'Torah, Chazal and Science'\", San Diego Jewish World, March 27, 2014\n\nCategory:Algebraists\nCategory:American Orthodox rabbis\nCategory:Harvard University alumni\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni\nCategory:Rosh yeshivas\nCategory:Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty\nCategory:Rabbis from Massachusetts\nCategory:Clergy from Boston\nCategory:1942 births"

Currently Merkurjev is a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nWork\nMerkurjev's work focuses on algebraic groups, quadratic forms, Galois cohomology, algebraic K-theory and central simple algebras. In the early 1980s Merkurjev proved a fundamental result about the structure of central simple algebras of period dividing 2, which relates the 2-torsion of the Brauer group with Milnor K-theory. In subsequent work with Suslin this was extended to higher torsion as the Merkurjev–Suslin theorem. The full statement of  the norm residue isomorphism theorem (also  known as the Bloch-Kato conjecture) was proven by Voevodsky.\n\nIn the late 1990s Merkurjev gave the most general approach to the notion of essential dimension, introduced by Buhler and Reichstein, and made fundamental contributions to that field. In particular Merkurjev determined the essential p-dimension of central simple algebras of degree  (for a prime p) and, in joint work with Karpenko, the essential dimension of finite p-groups.\n\nAwards\nMerkurjev won the Young Mathematician Prize of the Petersburg Mathematical Society for his work on algebraic K-theory. In 1986 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley, California, and his talk was entitled \"Milnor K-theory and Galois cohomology\".

      "text": "Eliakim Hastings Moore (; January 26, 1862 – December 30, 1932), usually cited as E. H. Moore or E. Hastings Moore, was an American mathematician.\n\nLife\nMoore, the son of a Methodist minister and grandson of US Congressman Eliakim H. Moore, discovered mathematics through a summer job at the Cincinnati Observatory while in high school. He learned mathematics at Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and obtained a B.A. in 1883 and the Ph.D. in 1885 with a thesis, supervised by Hubert Anson Newton, on some work of William Kingdon Clifford and Arthur Cayley. Newton encouraged Moore to study in Germany, and thus he spent an academic year at the University of Berlin, attending lectures by Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass.\n\nOn his return to the United States, Moore taught at Yale and at Northwestern University. When the University of Chicago opened its doors in 1892, Moore was the first head of its mathematics department, a position he retained until his death in 1931. His first two colleagues were Oskar Bolza and Heinrich Maschke. The resulting department was the second research-oriented mathematics department in American history, after Johns Hopkins University. \n\nAccomplishments\nMoore first worked in abstract algebra, proving in 1893 the classification of the structure of finite fields (also called Galois fields). Around 1900, he began working on the foundations of geometry. He reformulated Hilbert's axioms for geometry so that points were the only primitive notion, thus turning David Hilbert's primitive lines and planes into defined notions. In 1902, he further showed that one of Hilbert's axioms for geometry was redundant. Independently, during a course taught by G. B. Halsted, the twenty-year-old R.L. Moore (no relation) also proved this, but in a more elegant fashion than E. H. Moore used.  When E. H. Moore heard of the feat, he arranged for a scholarship that would allow R.L. Moore to study for a doctorate at Chicago. E.H. Moore's work on axiom systems is considered one of the starting points for metamathematics and model theory. After 1906, he turned to the foundations of analysis. The concept of a closure operator first appeared in his 1910 Introduction to a form of general analysis.T.S. Blyth, Lattices and Ordered Algebraic Structures, Springer, 2005, , p. 11 He also wrote on algebraic geometry, number theory, and integral equations.\n\nAt Chicago, Moore supervised 31 doctoral dissertations, including those of George Birkhoff, Leonard Dickson, Robert Lee Moore (no relation), and Oswald Veblen. Birkhoff and Veblen went on to lead departments at Harvard and Princeton, respectively. Dickson became the first great American algebraist and number theorist. Robert Moore founded American topology. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, as of December 2012, E. H. Moore had  over 18,900 known \"descendants.\"\n\nMoore convinced the New York Mathematical Society to change its name to the American Mathematical Society, whose Chicago branch he led. He presided over the AMS, 1901–02, and edited the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 1899–1907. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1908 in Rome and in 1912 in Cambridge, England.\n\nThe American Mathematical Society established a prize in his honor in 2002.\n\nSee also\n Moore–Penrose inverse\n Moore–Smith sequence\n Moore matrix over a finite field\n Moore determinant of a Hermitian matrix over a quaternion algebra\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nIvor Grattan-Guinness (2000) The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870–1940.

Cf. for example the résumé submitted by Noether to Erlangen University in 1907 (Erlangen University archive, Promotionsakt Emmy Noether (1907/08, NR. 2988); reproduced in: Emmy Noether, Gesammelte Abhandlungen – Collected Papers, ed. N. Jacobson 1983; online facsimile at physikerinnen.de/noetherlebenslauf.html). Sometimes Emmy is mistakenly reported as a short form for Amalie, or misreported as \"Emily\". e.g.  (; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. She invariably used the name \"Emmy Noether\" in her life and publications. She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed the theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.\n\nNoether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; her father was a mathematician, Max Noether. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.\n\nNoether remained a leading member of the Göttingen mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the \"Noether boys\". In 1924, Dutch mathematician B.L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas: Her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.\n\nNoether's mathematical work has been divided into three \"epochs\". In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on differential invariants in the calculus of variations, Noether's theorem, has been called \"one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics\". In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that \"changed the face of [abstract] algebra\". In her classic 1921 paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains) Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the ascending chain condition, and objects satisfying it are named Noetherian in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation theory of groups with the theory of modules and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology.\n\nPersonal life\nthumb|Noether grew up in the Bavarian city of Erlangen, depicted here in a 1916 postcard\nthumb|Emmy Noether with her brothers Alfred, Fritz, and Robert, before 1918\nEmmy's father, Max Noether, was descended from a family of wholesale traders in Germany. At age 14, he had been paralyzed by polio. He regained mobility, but one leg remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1868. After teaching there for seven years, he took a position in the Bavarian city of Erlangen, where he met and married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of a prosperous merchant.\n\nMax Noether's mathematical contributions were to algebraic geometry mainly, following in the footsteps of Alfred Clebsch. His best known results are the Brill–Noether theorem and the residue, or AF+BG theorem; several other theorems are associated with him; see Max Noether's theorem.\n\nEmmy Noether was born on 23 March 1882, the first of four children. Extract of p. 21 Her first name was \"Amalie\", after her mother and paternal grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age.\n\nAs a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.\n\nShe had three younger brothers: The eldest, Alfred, was born in 1883, was awarded a doctorate in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments; after studying in Munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928.\n\nUniversity education\nthumb|Paul Gordan supervised Noether's doctoral dissertation on invariants of biquadratic forms.\nNoether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900, she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of sehr gut (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the University of Erlangen.\n\nThis was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing mixed-sex education would \"overthrow all academic order\". One of only two women in a university of 986 students, Noether was only allowed to audit classes rather than participate fully, and required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14 July 1903 she passed the graduation exam at a Realgymnasium in Nuremberg.\n\nDuring the 1903–1904 winter semester, she studied at the University of Göttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer Karl Schwarzschild and mathematicians Hermann Minkowski, Otto Blumenthal, Felix Klein, and David Hilbert. Soon thereafter, restrictions on women's participation in that university were rescinded.\n\nNoether returned to Erlangen. She officially reentered the university in October 1904, and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics. Under the supervision of Paul Gordan she wrote her dissertation, Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form (On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms, 1907). Gordan was a member of the \"computational\" school of invariant researchers, and Noether's thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert. Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as \"crap\". write that she completed her doctorate at Göttingen, but this appears to be an error.\n\nTeaching\nUniversity of Erlangen\nFor the next seven years (1908–1915) she taught at the University of Erlangen's Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to n variables.\n\nthumb|250px|upright|Noether sometimes used postcards to discuss abstract algebra with her colleague, Ernst Fischer. This card is postmarked 10 April 1915.\nGordan retired in the spring of 1910, but continued to teach occasionally with his successor, Erhard Schmidt, who left shortly afterward for a position in Breslau. Gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when Schmidt's successor Ernst Fischer arrived; Gordan died a year later in December 1912.\n\nAccording to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.\n\nNoether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.\n\nUniversity of Göttingen\nIn the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the philosophical faculty: Women, they insisted, should not become privatdozenten. One faculty member protested: \"What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?\" Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, \"I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent. After all, we are a university, not a bath house.\"\n\nthumb|left|upright|In 1915 David Hilbert invited Noether to join the Göttingen mathematics department, challenging the views of some of his colleagues that a woman should not be allowed to teach at a university.\nNoether left for Göttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time Noether's father retired and her brother joined the German Army to serve in World War I. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.\n\nDuring her first years teaching at Göttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert's name, and Noether would provide \"assistance\".\n\nSoon after arriving at Göttingen, however, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the theorem now known as Noether's theorem, which shows that a conservation law is associated with any differentiable symmetry of a physical system. The paper was presented by a colleague, F. Klein on 26 July 1918 to a meeting of the Royal Society of Sciences at Göttingen. Noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of the society. American physicists Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill argue in their book Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe that Noether's theorem is \"certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics, possibly on a par with the Pythagorean theorem\".\n\nthumb|210px|The mathematics department at the University of Göttingen allowed Noether's habilitation in 1919, four years after she had begun lecturing at the school.\nWhen World War I ended, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her habilitation (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her habilitation lecture in June 1919.\n\nThree years later she received a letter from , the Prussian Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions). This was an unpaid \"extraordinary\" professorship, not the higher \"ordinary\" professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of Lehrbeauftragte für Algebra a year later.\n\nWork in abstract algebra\nAlthough Noether's theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to abstract algebra. In his introduction to Noether's Collected Papers, Nathan Jacobson wrote thatThe development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her – in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries. She sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own.\n\nNoether's work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring.\n\nThe following year she published a paper called Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen, analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work \"revolutionary\"; the publication gave rise to the term \"Noetherian ring\" and the naming of several other mathematical objects as Noetherian.\n\nIn 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, B.L. van der Waerden, arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\". In 1931 he published Moderne Algebra, a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition \"based in part on lectures by E. Artin and E. Noether\".\n\nVan der Waerden's visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian topologist Pavel Alexandrov lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as der Noether, using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation. They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether \"the greatest woman mathematician of all time\".\n\nGraduate students and influential lectures\nIn addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her \"a severe critic\", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude. A colleague later described her this way:Completely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.\n\nGöttingen\nthumb|left|Noether c. 1930\nIn Göttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students; her first was Grete Hermann, who defended her dissertation in February 1925. She later spoke reverently of her \"dissertation-mother\". Noether also supervised Max Deuring, who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute significantly to the field of arithmetic geometry; Hans Fitting, remembered for Fitting's theorem and the Fitting lemma; and Zeng Jiongzhi (also rendered \"Chiungtze C. Tsen\" in English), who proved Tsen's theorem. She also worked closely with Wolfgang Krull, who greatly advanced commutative algebra with his Hauptidealsatz and his dimension theory for commutative rings.\n\nHer frugal lifestyle at first was due to being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, Gottfried E. Noether.\n\nMostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, biographers suggest she focused on her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, \"gesticulated wildly\" as she ate and \"spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed\". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.\n\nAccording to van der Waerden's obituary of Emmy Noether, she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring. Reprinted in .\n\nSeveral of her colleagues attended her lectures, and she allowed some of her ideas, such as the crossed product (verschränktes Produkt in German) of associative algebras, to be published by others. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at Göttingen:Scharlau, W. \"Emmy Noether's Contributions to the Theory of Algebras\" in .\n Winter 1924/1925: Gruppentheorie und hyperkomplexe Zahlen [Group Theory and Hypercomplex Numbers]\n Winter 1927/1928: Hyperkomplexe Grössen und Darstellungstheorie [Hypercomplex Quantities and Representation Theory]\n Summer 1928: Nichtkommutative Algebra [Noncommutative Algebra]\n Summer 1929: Nichtkommutative Arithmetik [Noncommutative Arithmetic]\n Winter 1929/30: Algebra der hyperkomplexen Grössen [Algebra of Hypercomplex Quantities]\n\nThese courses often preceded major publications on the same subjects.\n\nNoether spoke quickly – reflecting the speed of her thoughts, many said – and demanded great concentration from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.\n\nShe developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not. \"Outsiders\" who occasionally visited Noether's lectures usually spent only 30 minutes in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: \"The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out.\"\n\nNoether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.\n\nMoscow\nthumb|140px|Pavel Alexandrov\nIn the winter of 1928–1929 Noether accepted an invitation to Moscow State University, where she continued working with P.S. Alexandrov. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and algebraic geometry. She worked with the topologists Lev Pontryagin and Nikolai Chebotaryov, who later praised her contributions to the development of Galois theory.\n\nthumb|right|Noether taught at the Moscow State University during the winter of 1928–1929.\nAlthough politics was not central to her life, Noether took a keen interest in political matters and, according to Alexandrov, showed considerable support for the Russian Revolution. She was especially happy to see Soviet advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the Bolshevik project. This attitude caused her problems in Germany, culminating in her eviction from a pension lodging building, after student leaders complained of living with \"a Marxist-leaning Jewess\".\n\nNoether planned to return to Moscow, an effort for which she received support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the Soviet Education Ministry. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans for a return to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, her brother Fritz accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany, and was subsequently executed during the Great Purge.\n\nRecognition\nIn 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin received the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award for their contributions to mathematics. The prize included a monetary reward of 500 Reichsmarks and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).\n\nthumb|left|Noether visited Zürich in 1932 to deliver a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians.\nNoether's colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 1932, in typical mathematicians' style. Helmut Hasse dedicated an article to her in the Mathematische Annalen, wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of noncommutative algebra are simpler than those of commutative algebra, by proving a noncommutative reciprocity law. This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, which he called the \"mμν-riddle of syllables\". She solved immediately, but the riddle has been lost.\n\nIn November of the same year, Noether delivered a plenary address (großer Vortrag) on \"Hyper-complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory\" at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich. The congress was attended by 800 people, including Noether's colleagues Hermann Weyl, Edmund Landau, and Wolfgang Krull. There were 420 official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented. Apparently, Noether's prominent speaking position was a recognition of the importance of her contributions to mathematics. The 1932 congress is sometimes described as the high point of her career.\n\nExpulsion from Göttingen by the Third Reich\nWhen Adolf Hitler became the German Reichskanzler in January 1933, Nazi activity around the country increased dramatically. At the University of Göttingen the German Student Association led the attack on the \"un-German spirit\" attributed to Jews and was aided by a privatdozent named Werner Weber, a former student of Noether. Antisemitic attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors. One young protester reportedly demanded: \"Aryan students want Aryan mathematics and not Jewish mathematics.\".\n\nOne of the first actions of Hitler's administration was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had \"demonstrated their loyalty to Germany\" by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: \"On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from you the right to teach at the University of Göttingen.\" Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked.\n\nNoether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that \"Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace.\" Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.\n\nRefuge at Bryn Mawr and Princeton, in America\nthumb|right|Bryn Mawr College provided a welcoming home for Noether during the last two years of her life.\nAs dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their colleagues in the United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: Bryn Mawr College, in the United States, and Somerville College at the University of Oxford, in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.\n\nAt Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended Anna Wheeler, who had studied at Göttingen just before Noether arrived there. Another source of support at the college was the Bryn Mawr president, Marion Edwards Park, who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in the area to \"see Dr. Noether in action!\" Noether and a small team of students worked quickly through van der Waerden's 1930 book Moderne Algebra I and parts of Erich Hecke's Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen (Theory of algebraic numbers).\n\nIn 1934, Noether began lecturing at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton upon the invitation of Abraham Flexner and Oswald Veblen. She also worked with and supervised Abraham Albert and Harry Vandiver. However, she remarked about Princeton University that she was not welcome at \"the men's university, where nothing female is admitted\".\n\nHer time in the United States was pleasant, surrounded as she was by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects. In the summer of 1934 she briefly returned to Germany to see Emil Artin and her brother Fritz before he left for Tomsk. Although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of the universities, she was able to use the library as a \"foreign scholar\".\n\nDeath\nthumb|250px|right|Noether's remains were placed under the walkway surrounding the cloisters of Bryn Mawr's M. Carey Thomas Library.\nIn April 1935 doctors discovered a tumor in Noether's pelvis. Worried about complications from surgery, they ordered two days of bed rest first. During the operation they discovered an ovarian cyst \"the size of a large cantaloupe\". Two smaller tumors in her uterus appeared to be benign and were not removed, to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a circulatory collapse on the fourth. On 14 April she fell unconscious, her temperature soared to , and she died. \"[I]t is not easy to say what had occurred in Dr. Noether\", one of the physicians wrote. \"It is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection, which struck the base of the brain where the heat centers are supposed to be located.\"\n\nA few days after Noether's death her friends and associates at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.\n\nContributions to mathematics and physics\nNoether's work in abstract algebra and topology was influential in mathematics, while in physics, Noether's theorem has consequences for theoretical physics and dynamical systems. She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways. Her friend and colleague Hermann Weyl described her scholarly output in three epochs:\n\nIn the first epoch (1907–1919), Noether dealt primarily with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her work for physics, the two Noether's theorems.\n\nIn the second epoch (1920–1926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of mathematical rings.\n\nIn the third epoch (1927–1935), Noether focused on noncommutative algebra, linear transformations, and commutative number fields.\n\nAlthough the results of Noether's first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B.L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.\n\nIn these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.\n\nHistorical context\nIn the century from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, the field of mathematics – specifically algebra – underwent a profound revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, as well as on the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, reprinted in  Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846, by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.G.E. .\n\nBackground on abstract algebra and begriffliche Mathematik (conceptual mathematics)\nTwo of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings.\n\nA group consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.\n\nA ring likewise, has a set of elements, but now has two operations. The first operation must make the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first – the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that a x = x a = 1 ), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.\n\nGroups are frequently studied through group representations. In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.\n\nA powerful way of studying rings is through their modules. A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module.\n\nThe underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.\n\nWords such as \"element\" and \"combining operation\" are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For example, the elements might be computer data words, where the first combining operation is exclusive or and the second is logical conjunction. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether's gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, her student van der Waerden recalled that\n\nThis is the begriffliche Mathematik (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra.\n\nExample: Integers as a ring\nThe integers form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be added or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a + b = b + a. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3 × a = 1.\n\nThe integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.\n\nFirst epoch (1908–1919): Algebraic invariant theory\nthumb|250px|right|Table 2 from Noether's dissertation  on invariant theory. This table collects 202 of the 331 invariants of ternary biquadratic forms. These forms are graded in two variables x and u. The horizontal direction of the table lists the invariants with increasing grades in x, while the vertical direction lists them with increasing grades in u.\nMuch of Noether's work in the first epoch of her career was associated with invariant theory, principally algebraic invariant theory. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a group of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid yardstick is rotated, the coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) of its endpoints change, but its length L given by the formula  L2 = Δx2 + Δy2 + Δz2 remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century, prompted in part by Felix Klein's Erlangen program, according to which different types of geometry should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the cross-ratio of projective geometry.\n\nAn example of an invariant is the discriminant B2 − 4 A C of a binary quadratic form x·A x + y·B x + y·C y , where x and y are vectors and \"·\" is the dot product or \"inner product\" for the vectors. A, B, and C are linear operators on the vectors – typically matrices.\n\nThe discriminant is called \"invariant\" because it is not changed by linear substitutions x → a x + b y, y → c x + d y with determinant a d − b c = 1 . These substitutions form the special linear group SL2.There are no invariants under the general linear group of all invertible linear transformations because these transformations can be multiplication by a scaling factor. To remedy this, classical invariant theory also considered relative invariants, which were forms invariant up to a scale factor.\n\nOne can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged by the action of SL2; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant.\n\nMore generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A0 xr y0 + ... + Ar x0 yr of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A0, ..., Ar, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.\n\nOne of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the \"finite basis problem\". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms.\n\nNoether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the \"king of invariant theory\", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group.\n\nFirst epoch (1908–1919): Galois theory\nGalois theory concerns transformations of number fields that permute the roots of an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable x of degree n, in which the coefficients are drawn from some ground field, which might be, for example, the field of real numbers, rational numbers, or the integers modulo 7. There may or may not be choices of x, which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called roots. If the polynomial is x2 + 1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of x makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is extended, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree.\n\nContinuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, +i and −i, where i is the imaginary unit, that is, i 2 = −1 . More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the splitting field of the polynomial.\n\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial. (In mathematical jargon, these transformations are called automorphisms.) The Galois group of  consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and complex conjugation, which sends +i to −i. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a permutation of the n roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the Galois group.\n\nIn 1918, Noether published a paper on the inverse Galois problem.. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to \"Noether's problem\", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup G of the permutation group Sn acting on the field  k(x1, ... , xn) always is a pure transcendental extension of the field k. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper,. where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for  n = 2, 3, or 4. In 1969, R.G. Swan found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with  n = 47 and G a cyclic group of order 47. (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved..\n\nFirst epoch (1908–1919): Physics\n\nNoether was brought to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:\n\nFor illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved.. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.\n\nNoether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. in Teicher (1999). Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon:If the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.\n\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Ascending and descending chain conditions\nIn this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending (Teilerkettensatz) or descending (Vielfachenkettensatz) chain conditions. A sequence of non-empty subsets A1, A2, A3, etc. of a set S is usually said to be ascending, if each is a subset of the next\n\nConversely, a sequence of subsets of S is called descending if each contains the next subset:\n\nA chain becomes constant after a finite number of steps if there is an n such that  for all m ≥ n. A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the ascending chain condition if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps.\n\nAscending and descending chain conditions are general, meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage.\n\nFor example: How to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.\n\nMany types of objects in abstract algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.\n\nThe chain condition often is \"inherited\" by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space, are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are likewise, Noetherian; and, mutatis mutandis, the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. All quotient rings of a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, but that does not necessarily hold for its subrings. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal power series over a Noetherian ring.\n\nAnother application of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume the existence of a counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example.\n\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Commutative rings, ideals, and modules\nNoether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property.. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.\n\nNoether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927). characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0- or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.\n\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Elimination theory\nIn 1923–1924, Noether applied her ideal theory to elimination theory in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the factorization of polynomials could be carried over directly. Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of resultants.\n\nFor illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form   M v = 0   where a matrix (or linear transform)   M   (without the variable x) times a vector v (that only has non-zero powers of x) is equal to the zero vector, 0. Hence, the determinant of the matrix   M   must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable x has been eliminated.\n\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Invariant theory of finite groups\nTechniques such as Hilbert's original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper, Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations   G   acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called Noether's bound. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether's bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is coprime to   |G|!   (the factorial of the order   |G|   of the group G). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether's bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number   |G| , but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides   |G|!   but not   |G| . For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called \"Noether's gap\". It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.\n\nIn her 1926 paper, Noether extended Hilbert's theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert's work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether's result was later extended by William Haboush to all reductive groups by his proof of the Mumford conjecture. In this paper Noether also introduced the Noether normalization lemma, showing that a finitely generated domain A over a field k has a set   { x1, ... , xn }   of algebraically independent elements such that A is integral over   k [x1, ... , xn] .\n\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Contributions to topology\nthumb|right|250px|A continuous deformation (homotopy) of a coffee cup into a doughnut (torus) and back\nAs noted by Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's contributions to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. An old joke is that \"a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug\", since they can be continuously deformed into one another.\n\nNoether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of algebraic topology from the earlier combinatorial topology, specifically, the idea of homology groups. According to the account of Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by Heinz Hopf and by him in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where \"she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle\" and he continues that,\n\nNoether's suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others, and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen.Hirzebruch, Friedrich. \"Emmy Noether and Topology\" in . Noether observed that her idea of a Betti group makes the Euler–Poincaré formula simpler to understand, and Hopf's own work on this subject \"bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether\". Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication, where she cites it as an application of group theory. in \n\nThis algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in Austria. In a 1926–1927 course given in Vienna, Leopold Vietoris defined a homology group, which was developed by Walther Mayer, into an axiomatic definition in 1928.Hirzebruch, Friedrich, \"Emmy Noether and Topology\" in .\n\nthumb|upright|right|Helmut Hasse worked with Noether and others to found the theory of central simple algebras.\n\nThird epoch (1927–1935): Hypercomplex numbers and representation theory\nMuch work on hypercomplex numbers and group representations was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras..\n\nBriefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra..\n\nThird epoch (1927–1935): Noncommutative algebra\nNoether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With Emil Artin, Richard Brauer, and Helmut Hasse, she founded the theory of central simple algebras.\n\nA paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer pertains to division algebras,. which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz (\"main theorem\"):every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension.These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.\n\nAssessment, recognition, and memorials\n\nthumb|250px|right|The Emmy Noether Campus at the University of Siegen is home to its mathematics and physics departments.\nNoether's work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. In his obituary, fellow algebraist BL van der Waerden says that her mathematical originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\", and Hermann Weyl said that Noether \"changed the face of algebra by her work\". During her lifetime and even until today, Noether has been characterized as the greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians such as Pavel Alexandrov, Hermann Weyl, and Jean Dieudonné..\n\nIn a letter to The New York Times, Albert Einstein wrote:.

      "text": "Alexander Markowich Ostrowski (; ; 25 September 1893, in Kiev, Russian Empire – 20 November 1986, in Montagnola, Lugano, Switzerland) was a mathematician.\n\nHis father Mark having been a merchant, Alexander Ostrowski attended the Kiev College of Commerce, not a high school, and thus had an insufficient qualification to be admitted to university. However, his talent did not remain undetected: Ostrowski's mentor,  Dmitry Grave, wrote to Landau and Hensel for help.\n\nSubsequently, Ostrowski began to study mathematics at Marburg University under Hensel's supervision in 1912. During the World War I he was interned, but thanks to the intervention of Hensel, the restrictions on his movements were eased somewhat, and he was allowed to use the university library.\n\nAfter the war had ended Ostrowski moved to Göttingen where he wrote his doctoral dissertation and was influenced by Hilbert, Klein and Landau. In 1920, after having obtained his doctorate, Ostrowski moved to Hamburg where he worked as Hecke's assistant and finished his habilitation in 1922. In 1923 he returned to Göttingen, and in 1928 became Professor of Mathematics at Basel, until retirement in 1958. In 1950 Ostrowski obtained Swiss citizenship. After retirement he still published scientific papers until his late eighties.\n\nSee also\nOstrowski's theorem\nOstrowski–Hadamard gap theorem\nOstrowski numeration\nOstrowski Prize\n\nExternal links\nOstrowski Foundation website: short biography\n\nGautschi, Walter, Alexander M.

      "text": "Alessandro Padoa (14 October 1868 – 25 November 1937) was an Italian mathematician and logician, a contributor to the school of Giuseppe Peano.  He is remembered for a method for deciding whether, given some formal theory, a new primitive notion is truly independent of the other primitive notions. There is an analogous problem in axiomatic theories, namely deciding whether a given axiom is independent of the other axioms.\n\nThe following description of Padoa's career is included in a biography of Peano:\nHe attended secondary school in Venice, engineering school in Padua, and the University of Turin, from which he received a degree in mathematics in 1895. Although he was never a student of Peano, he was an ardent disciple and, from 1896 on, a collaborator and friend. He taught in secondary schools in Pinerolo, Rome, Cagliari, and (from 1909) at the Technical Institute in Genoa. He also held positions at the Normal School in Aquila and the Naval School in Genoa, and, beginning in 1898, he gave a series of lectures at the Universities of Brussels, Pavia, Berne, Padua, Cagliari, and Geneva. He gave papers at congresses of philosophy and mathematics in Paris, Cambridge, Livorno, Parma, Padua, and Bologna. In 1934 he was awarded the ministerial prize in mathematics by the Accademia dei Lincei (Rome).Kennedy (1980), page 86\n\nThe congresses in Paris in 1900 were particularly notable. Padoa's addresses at these congresses have been well remembered for their clear and unconfused exposition of the modern axiomatic method in mathematics. In fact, he is said to be \"the first … to get all the ideas concerning defined and undefined concepts completely straight\".\n\nCongressional addresses\n\nPhilosophers' congress\nAt the International Congress of Philosophy Padoa spoke on \"Logical Introduction to Any Deductive Theory\". He says\nduring the period of elaboration of any deductive theory we choose the ideas to be represented by the undefined symbols and the facts to be stated by the unproved propositions; but, when we begin to formulate the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are completely devoid of meaning and that the unproved propositions (instead of stating facts, that is, relations between the ideas represented by the undefined symbols) are simply conditions imposed upon undefined symbols.\nThen, the system of ideas that we have initially chosen is simply one interpretation of the system of undefined symbols; but from the deductive point of view this interpretation can be ignored by the reader, who is free to replace it in his mind by another interpretation that satisfies the conditions stated by the unproved propositions. And since the propositions, from the deductive point of view, do not state facts, but conditions, we cannot consider them genuine postulates.\nPadoa went on to say:\n...what is necessary to the logical development of a deductive theory is not the empirical knowledge of the properties of things, but the formal knowledge of relations between symbols.van Heijenoort 120,121\n\nMathematicians' congress\n\nPadoa spoke at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians with his title \"A New System of Definitions for Euclidean Geometry\". At the outset he discusses the various selections of primitive notions in geometry at the time:\nThe meaning of any of the symbols that one encounters in geometry must be presupposed, just as one presupposes that of the symbols which appear in pure logic. As there is an arbitrariness in the choice of the undefined symbols, it is necessary to describe the chosen system. We cite only three geometers who are concerned with this question and who have successively reduced the number of undefined symbols, and through them (as well as through symbols that appear in pure logic) it is possible to define all the other symbols.\nFirst, Moritz Pasch was able to define all the other symbols through the following four:\n1. point   2. segment (of a line)\n3. plane   4. is superimposable upon\nThen, Giuseppe Peano was able in 1889 to define plane through point and segment. In 1894 he replaced is superimposable upon with motion in the system of undefined symbols, thus reducing the system to symbols:\n1. point   2. segment   3. motion\nFinally, in 1899 Mario Pieri was able to define segment through point and motion. Consequently, all the symbols that one encounters in Euclidean geometry can be defined in terms of only two of them, namely\n 1. point   2. motion\nPadoa completed his address by suggesting and demonstrating his own development of geometric concepts. In particular, he showed how he and Pieri define a line in terms of \ncollinear points.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n A.

FRSFor HFRSE  April 4, 1809 – October 6, 1880) was an American mathematician who taught at Harvard University for approximately 50 years. He made contributions to celestial mechanics, statistics, number theory, algebra, and the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of Benjamin Peirce (1778–1831), later librarian of Harvard, and Lydia Ropes Nichols Peirce (1781–1868).\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard University in 1829, he taught mathematics for two years at the Round Hill School in Northampton, and in 1831 was appointed professor of mathematics at Harvard. He added astronomy to his portfolio in 1842, and remained as Harvard professor until his death. In addition, he was instrumental in the development of Harvard's science curriculum, served as the college  librarian, and was director of the U.S. Coast Survey from 1867 to 1874.\nHe was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1852.\n\nResearch\nBenjamin Peirce is often regarded as the earliest American scientist whose research was recognized as world class. He was an apologist for slavery, opining that it should be condoned if it was used to allow an elite to pursue scientific enquiry.\n\nMathematics\nIn number theory, he proved there is no odd perfect number with fewer than four prime factors.\n\nIn algebra, he was notable for the study of associative algebras. He first introduced the terms idempotent and nilpotent in 1870 to describe elements of these algebras, and he also introduced the Peirce decomposition.\n\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, he became known for the statement that \"Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions\".First line of Linear Associative Algebra Peirce's definition of mathematics was credited by his son, Charles Sanders Peirce, as helping to initiate the consequence-oriented philosophy of pragmatism.  Like George Boole, Peirce believed that mathematics could be used to study logic. These ideas were further developed by his son Charles , who noted that logic also includes the study of faulty reasoning.  In contrast, the later logicist program of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell attempted to base mathematics on logic.\n\nStatistics\nPeirce proposed what came to be known as Peirce's Criterion for the statistical treatment of outliers, that is, of apparently extreme observations. His ideas were further developed by his son Charles.Peirce, Charles Sanders (1870/1871/1873).\n\nPeirce was an expert witness in the Howland will forgery trial, where he was assisted by his son Charles. Their analysis of the questioned signature showed that it resembled another particular handwriting example so closely that the chances of such a match were statistically extremely remote.\n\nPrivate life\n\nthumb|upright=1.2|With Louis Agassiz \n\nHe was devoutly religious, though he seldom published his theological thoughts.Grattan-Guinness, Ivor and Walsh, Alison (2008), \"Benjamin Peirce\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

He also held a research position at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy, and was elected a Member of the Romanian Academy in 1992. \n\nHe is best known for his contributions to algebra and the theory of Abelian categories. From 1964 to 2007 he collaborated with Pierre Gabriel on the characterization of abelian categories; their best-known result is the Gabriel–Popescu theorem.  His areas of expertise were category theory, abelian categories with applications to rings and modules, adjoint functors, limits and colimits, the theory of sheaves, the theory of rings, fields and polynomials, and valuation theory. He also had interests and published in the following areas: algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, K-theory, class field theory, and algebraic function theory. \n\nPopescu published between 1962 and 2008 more than 102 papers in peer-reviewed, mathematics journals, several monographs on the theory of sheaves, and also six books on abelian category theory and abstract algebra. In a Grothendieck-like, energetic style, he initiated and provided scientific leadership to several seminars on category theory, sheaves and abstract algebra which resulted in a continuous stream of high-quality mathematical publications in international, peer-reviewed mathematics journals by several members participating in his Seminar series.

He shared many moral, ethical and religious values with another famous mathematician, Alexander Grothendieck, who visited the School of Mathematics in Bucharest in 1968. Like Grothendieck, he had a long-standing interest in category theory, number theory, practicing Yoga, and supporting promising young mathematicians in his fields of interest. He also supported the early developments of category theory applications in relational biology and mathematical biophysics/mathematical biology.\n\nAcademic positions\nPopescu was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of Bucharest in 1968 where he taught graduate students until 1972. Since 1964, he also held a Research Professorship at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy; the institute was closed in 1976 by order of Nicolae Ceaușescu, for reasons related to his daughter Zoia Ceaușescu, who had been hired at the institute two years before.\n\nBooks published\n  Elemente de teoria algebrică a numerelor, Universitate București, 1968.

      "text": "thumb|right|Portrait of László Rédei\nLászló Rédei (Rákoskeresztúr, 15 November 1900—Budapest, 21 November 1980) was a Hungarian mathematician.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Budapest and initially worked as a schoolteacher. In 1940 he was appointed professor in the University of Szeged and in 1967 moved to the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest.\n\nHis mathematical work was in algebraic number theory and abstract algebra, especially group theory. He proved that every finite tournament contains an odd number of Hamiltonian paths. He gave several proofs of the theorem on quadratic reciprocity. He proved important results concerning the invariants of the class groups of quadratic number fields. Iyanaga's pamphlet discusses and generalizes one of Rédei's theorems; it gives a \"necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an ideal class (in the restricted sense) of order 4 in a quadratic field k() ...\" In several cases, he determined if the ring of integers of the real quadratic field Q() is Euclidean or not. He successfully generalized Hajós's theorem. This led him to the investigations of lacunary polynomials over finite fields, which he eventually published in a book. This work on lacunary polynomials has had a big influence in the field of finite geometry where it plays an important role in the theory of blocking sets. He introduced a very general notion of skew product of groups, both the Schreier-extension and the Zappa–Szép product are special case of. He explicitly determined those finite noncommutative groups whose all proper subgroups were commutative (1947). This is one of the very early results which eventually led to the classification of all finite simple groups.\n\nHe was the president of the János Bolyai Mathematical Society (1947–1949). He was awarded the Kossuth Prize twice. He was elected corresponding member (1949), full member (1955) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\n His books \n Ladislaus Rédei: Algebra.

Lagrange's work was largely ignored until Ruffini established strong connections between permutations and the solvability of algebraic equations. Ruffini was the first to controversially assert the unsolvability by radicals of algebraic equations higher than quartics.

      "text": "Jean-Pierre Serre (; born 15 September 1926) is a French mathematician who has made contributions to algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and algebraic number theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1954 and the inaugural Abel Prize in 2003.\n\nBiography\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in Bages, Pyrénées-Orientales, France, to pharmacist parents, Serre was educated at the Lycée de Nîmes and then from 1945 to 1948 at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.J J O'Connor and E F Robertson Serre Biography http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Serre.html He was awarded his doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1951. From 1948 to 1954 he held positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris. In 1956 he was elected professor at the Collège de France, a position he held until his retirement in 1994. His wife, Professor Josiane Heulot-Serre, was a chemist; she also was the director of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles. Their daughter is the former French diplomat, historian and writer Claudine Monteil. The French mathematician Denis Serre is his nephew.  He practices skiing, table tennis, and rock climbing (in Fontainebleau).\n\nCareer\nFrom a very young age he was an outstanding figure in the school of Henri Cartan, working on algebraic topology, several complex variables and then commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, where he introduced sheaf theory and homological algebra techniques. Serre's thesis concerned the Leray–Serre spectral sequence associated to a fibration. Together with Cartan, Serre established the technique of using Eilenberg–MacLane spaces for computing homotopy groups of spheres, which at that time was one of  the major problems in topology.\n\nIn his speech at the Fields Medal award ceremony in 1954, Hermann Weyl gave high praise to Serre, and also made the point that the award was for the first time awarded to a non-analyst. Serre subsequently changed his research focus. \n\nAlgebraic geometry\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a fruitful collaboration between Serre and the two-years-younger Alexander Grothendieck led to important foundational work, much of it motivated by the Weil conjectures. Two major foundational papers by Serre were Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents (FAC), on coherent cohomology, and Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique (GAGA).\n\nEven at an early stage in his work Serre had perceived a need to construct more general and refined cohomology theories to tackle the Weil conjectures. The problem was that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf over a finite field couldn't capture as much topology as singular cohomology with integer coefficients.  Amongst Serre's early candidate theories of 1954–55 was one based on Witt vector coefficients.\n\nAround 1958 Serre suggested that isotrivial principal bundles on algebraic varieties – those that become trivial after pullback by a finite étale map – are important. This acted as one important source of inspiration for Grothendieck to develop étale topology and the corresponding theory of étale cohomology. http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~illusie/Grothendieck_etale.pdf These tools, developed in full by Grothendieck and collaborators in Séminaire de géométrie algébrique (SGA) 4 and SGA 5, provided the tools for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures by Pierre Deligne.\n\nOther work\nthumb|Serre\nFrom 1959 onward Serre's interests turned towards group theory, number theory, in particular Galois representations and modular forms.\n\nAmongst his most original contributions were: his \"Conjecture II\" (still open) on Galois cohomology; his use of group actions on trees (with Hyman Bass); the Borel–Serre compactification; results on the number of points of curves over finite fields;  Galois representations in ℓ-adic cohomology and the proof that these representations have often a \"large\" image; the concept of p-adic modular form; and the Serre conjecture (now a theorem) on mod-p representations that made Fermat's last theorem a connected part of mainstream arithmetic geometry.\n\nIn his paper FAC, Serre asked whether a finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free. This question led to a great deal of activity in commutative algebra, and was finally answered in the affirmative by Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin independently in 1976. This result is now known as the Quillen–Suslin  theorem.\n\nHonors and awards\nSerre, at twenty-seven in 1954, is the youngest ever to be awarded the Fields Medal. He went on to win the Balzan Prize in 1985, the Steele Prize in 1995, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2000, and was the first recipient of the Abel Prize in 2003. He has been awarded other prizes, such as the Gold Medal of the French National Scientific Research Centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS).\n\nHe is a foreign member of several scientific Academies (France, US, Norway, Sweden, Russia, the Royal Society, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1978)) and has received many honorary degrees (from Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and others). In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-07-18.\n\nSerre has been awarded the highest honors in France as Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour (Grand Croix de la Légion d'Honneur) and Grand Cross of the Legion of Merit (Grand Croix de l'Ordre National du Mérite).\n\nSee also\n List of things named after Jean-Pierre Serre\n Nicolas Bourbaki\n\nBibliography\nGroupes Algébriques et Corps de Classes (1959), Hermann, translated into English as Algebraic Groups and Class Fields (1988), Springer-Verlag\nCorps Locaux (1962), Hermann, as Local Fields (1980), Springer-Verlag\nCohomologie Galoisienne (1964) Collège de France course 1962–63, as Galois Cohomology (1997), Springer-Verlag\nAlgèbre Locale, Multiplicités (1965) Collège de France course 1957–58, as Local Algebra (2000), Springer-Verlag\n\"Lie algebras and Lie groups\" (1965) Harvard Lectures, Springer-Verlag.\nAlgèbres de Lie Semi-simples Complexes (1966), as Complex Semisimple Lie Algebras (1987), Springer-Verlag\nAbelian ℓ-Adic Representations and Elliptic Curves (1968), CRC Press, \nCours d'arithmétique (1970), PUF, as A Course in Arithmetic (1973), Springer-Verlag\nReprésentations linéaires des groupes finis (1971), Hermann, as Linear Representations of Finite Groups (1977), Springer-Verlag\nArbres, amalgames, SL2 (1977), SMF,  as Trees (1980), Springer-Verlag\nOeuvres/Collected Papers in four volumes (1986) Vol. IV in 2000, Springer-Verlag\nLectures on the Mordell-Weil Theorem (1990), Vieweg\nTopics in Galois Theory (1992), CRC Press\n\"Cohomological Invariants in Galois Cohomology (2003) with Skip Garibaldi and Alexander Merkurjev, AMS\n\"Exposés de séminaires 1950–1999\" (2001), SMFGrothendieck–Serre Correspondence (2003), bilingual edition,  edited with Pierre Colmez, SMF-AMS\n\"Lectures on N_X(p)\" (2012), AK Peters, CRC Press\n Correspondance Serre-Tate'' (2015), edited with Pierre Colmez, SMF\n\"Finite Groups: an Introduction\"  (2016), Higher Education Press & International Press\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n Jean-Pierre Serre, Collège de France, biography and publications.\n Jean-Pierre Serre at the French Academy of Sciences, in French.\n Interview with Jean-Pierre Serre in Notices of the American Mathematical Society.\n An Interview with Jean-Pierre Serre by C.T.

His thesis also contains the proof of Kőnig's theorem for regular bipartite graphs, phrased in the language of configurations.\n\nIn 1910 Steinitz published the very influential paper Algebraische Theorie der Körper (German: Algebraic Theory of Fields, Crelle's Journal (1910), 167–309).

      "text": "thumb|Michael Stifel's Arithmetica Integra (1544), p. 225.\nMichael Stifel or Styfel (1487 – April 19, 1567) was a German monk, Protestant reformer and mathematician. He was an Augustinian who became an early supporter of Martin Luther. He was later appointed professor of mathematics at Jena University.\n\nLife\n\nStifel was born in Esslingen am Neckar. He joined the Order of Saint Augustine and was ordained a priest in 1511. Tensions in the abbey grew after he published  the poem Von der Christförmigen, rechtgegründeten leer Doctoris Martini Luthers (1522, i.e. On the Christian, righteous doctrine of Doctor Martin Luther) and came into conflict with Thomas Murner. Stifel then left for Frankfurt, and soon went to Mansfeld, where he began his mathematical studies. In 1524 upon a recommendation by Martin Luther, Stifel was called to the Jörger on Tollet Palace in Tollet close to Grieskirchen, Upper Austria.publication of kathpress (2013), letter of Martin Luther to Countess Dorothea Jörger regarding a request of Michael Stifel (in German)  Due to the tightened situation in Austria (execution of Leonhard Kaiser in Schaerding), Stifel returned to Wittenberg in 1527. At this time Stifel started writing a book collecting letter transcripts of Martin Luther. It was completed in 1534.Michael Stifel, collection of handwritten transcripts (1534), \"Martin Luther Briefe and Sermone; Michael Stifel Passionsharmonie\" (Latin/German), Wittenberg, digitized version of University Library Jena\n\nBy intercession of Martin Luther, Stifel became minister in Lochau (what is Annaburg now). Luther also confirmed the marriage of Michael Stifel and the widow of his predecessor in the ministry. Michael Stifel was fascinated regarding the properties and possibilities of numbers. At Lochau he had the opportunity to do mathematical studies on number theory and numerology. He also performed the so-called \"Wortrechnung\" (i.e. word-calculation), studying the statistical properties of letters and words in the bible, a common method at that time. In 1532 Stifel published anonymously his \"Ein Rechenbuchlin vom EndChrist. Apocalyps in Apocalypsim\"  (A Book of Arithmetic about the AntiChrist. A Revelation in the Revelation). This predicted that Judgement Day the world would end at 8am on October 19, 1533. The German saying \"to talk a Stiefel\" or \"to calculate a Stiefel\" (Stiefel is the German word for boot) meaning to say or calculate something based on an unusual track can be traced back to this incident.Stiefel (einen Stiefel reden / schreiben) Retrieved 01/11/2012 When this prediction failed, he did not make any other predictions.\n\nIn 1535 he became minister in Holzdorf near Wittenberg and stayed there for 12 years. Stifel now continued with serious mathematical studies.  Worth mentioning were \"the Coss\" (the first algebra book written in German) of Christoph Rudolff, which he did in self study and \"the Elements\" of Euclid in the Latin edition by Campanus of Novara.\nA proposal of Jacob Milich, who supported his scientific development. Milich encouraged Michael Stifel to write a comprehensive work on arithmetic and algebra.Kurt Vogel (1981),  Stifel, Michael Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. on Encyclopedia.com. 6 Dec. 2014 <http://www.encyclopedia.com>.

Jahrhundert\"(German) essay in \"Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik /Literaturzeitung Band 2\" (1857), Digitized version of the Heidelberg University Library\nIn 1541, during his time as minister in Holzdorf, he also registered for mathematics at the University of WittenbergAlbum academiae vitebergensis 1502–1560, Leipzig 1841 to extend his mathematical knowledge. In 1558 Stifel became first professor of mathematics at the new founded University of Jena.Uni Jena, prominent persons. \"Namhafte Hochschullehrer und Studenten aus der Jenaer Universitätsgeschichte\" (selection, in German) on http://www.uni-jena.de\n\nMathematics\nStifel's most important work Arithmetica integra (1544) contained important innovations in mathematical notation.  It has the first use of multiplication by juxtaposition (with no symbol between the terms) in Europe.  He is the first to use the term \"exponent\" and also included the following rules for calculating powers:  and . The book contains a table of integers and powers of 2 that some have considered to be an early version of a logarithmic table.\nStifel explicitly points out, that multiplication and division operations in the (lower) geometric series can be mapped by addition and subtraction in the (upper) arithmetic series. On the following page 250, he shows  examples also using negative exponents. He also realized that this would create a lot of work. So he wrote, that regarding this issue marvelous books could be written, but he himself will refrain and keep his eyes shut.\n\nStifel was the first, who had a standard method to solve quadratic equations. He was able to reduce the different cases  known to one case, because he uses both, positive and negative coefficients. He called his method/rule AMASIAS. The letters A, M, A/S, I, A/S each are representing a single operation step when solving a quadratic equation. Stifel, however avoided to show the negative results.\n\nAnother topic dealt with in the Arithmetica integra are negative numbers (which Stifel calls numeri absurdi). Negative numbers were refused and considered as preposterous by the authorities at that time. Stifel however, used negative numbers equal to the other numbers. He also discussed the properties of irrational numbers and if the irrationals are real numbers, or only fictitious (AI page 103). Stifel found them very useful for mathematics, and not dispensable. Further issues were a method of calculating roots of higher order by using binomial coefficients and sequences.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nStifel, Michael (1544). \"Arithmetica integra\"\nStifel, Michael (1544). \"Arithmetica integra\"/\"Vollständiger Lehrgang der Arithmetik\".

      "text": "James Joseph Sylvester FRS HFRSE LLD (3 September 1814 – 15 March 1897) was an English mathematician. He made fundamental contributions to matrix theory, invariant theory, number theory, partition theory, and combinatorics.  He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University and as founder of the American Journal of Mathematics.  At his death, he was a professor at Oxford.\n\n Biography \nJames Joseph was born in London on 3 September 1814, the son of Abraham Joseph, a merchant.  James later adopted the surname Sylvester when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States—a country which at that time required all immigrants to have a given name, a middle name, and a surname. \n\nAt the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of Augustus De Morgan at the University of London. His family withdrew him from the University after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the Liverpool Royal Institution.\n\nSylvester began his study of mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge in 1831, where his tutor was John Hymers. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the tripos, for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, and Sylvester could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a Smith's prize. In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at University College London and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an MA by Trinity College, Dublin. In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia, but left after less than four months following a violent encounter with two students he had disciplined. He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of Charles Sanders Peirce) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry.  However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England.\n\nOn his return to England, he was hired in 1844 by the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society for which he developed successful actuarial models and served as de facto CEO, a position that required a law degree. As a result, he studied for the Bar, meeting a fellow British mathematician studying law, Arthur Cayley, with whom he made significant contributions to invariant theory and also matrix theory during a long collaboration.Parshall  He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of The Times.\n\nOne of Sylvester's lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, Latin and Greek, and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement,  published a book entitled The Laws of Verse in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for prosody in poetry.\n\nIn 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to his being a Jew.\n\nIn 1876 Sylvester again crossed the Atlantic Ocean to become the inaugural professor of mathematics at the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold.  After negotiation, agreement was reached on a salary that was not paid in gold.  In 1878 he founded the American Journal of Mathematics.  The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the Analyst, which eventually became the Annals of Mathematics.\n\nIn 1883, he returned to England to take up the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the University appointed a deputy professor to the same chair. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School.\n\nSylvester died in London on 15 March 1897. He is buried in Balls Pond Road Jewish Cemetery on Kingsbury Road in London.\n\nLegacy\n\nSylvester invented a great number of mathematical terms such as \"matrix\" (in 1850),Matrices and determinants, The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive \"graph\" (combinatorics)See:\n  J. J. Sylvester (February 7, 1878) \"Chemistry and algebra,\" Nature, 17 :  284.  From page 284:  \"Every invariant and covariant thus becomes expressible by a graph precisely identical with a Kekuléan diagram or chemicograph.\"\n  J. J. Sylvester (1878) \"On an application of the new atomic theory to the graphical representation of the invariants and covariants of binary quantics, — with three appendices,\" American Journal of Mathematics, Pure and Applied, 1 (1) :  64-90.  The term \"graph\" first appears in this paper on page 65. and \"discriminant\".J. J. Sylvester (1851) \"On a remarkable discovery in the theory of canonical forms and of hyperdeterminants,\" Philosophical Magazine, 4th series, 2 :  391–410; Sylvester coined the term \"discriminant\" on page 406.  He coined the term \"totient\" for Euler's totient function φ(n).J. J. Sylvester (1879) \"On certain ternary cubic-form equations,\" American Journal of Mathematics, 2 : 357–393; Sylvester coins the term \"totient\" on page 361:  \"(the so-called Φ function of any number I shall here and hereafter designate as its τ function and call its Totient)\". In Discrete geometry he is remembered for Sylvester's Problem and a result on the orchard problem, and in matrix theory he discovered\nSylvester's determinant identity, which generalizes the Desnanot-Jacobi identityC.G.J. Jacobi, \"De Formatione et Proprietatibus Determinantium\", Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 22, 285-318 (1841) .  His collected scientific work fills four volumes. In 1880, the Royal Society of London awarded Sylvester the Copley Medal, its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the Sylvester Medal in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in Oxford.\n\nSylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at Johns Hopkins University, is named in his honor. Several professorships there are named in his honor also.\n\n Publications \n\n See also \nList of things named after James Joseph Sylvester\n\n Notes \n\n References \n.\n\n External links \n\n \n \n Collected papers – from the University of Michigan Historical Math Collection\n J.J.Sylvester home page\n Selected Poetry of James Joseph Sylvester\n \n\nCategory:1814 births\nCategory:1897 deaths\nCategory:19th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:19th-century English mathematicians\nCategory:Academics of University College London\nCategory:Algebraists\nCategory:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge\nCategory:British actuaries\nCategory:English Jews\nCategory:Combinatorialists\nCategory:Fellows of the Royal Society\nCategory:Jewish American scientists\nCategory:Johns Hopkins University faculty\nCategory:Number theorists\nCategory:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin\nCategory:Recipients of the Copley Medal\nCategory:Royal Medal winners\nCategory:Savilian Professors of Geometry\nCategory:Second Wranglers\nCategory:De Morgan Medallists\nCategory:Governors of Abingdon School"
