      "text": "In the various branches of [[mathematics]] that fall under the heading of [[abstract algebra]], the '''kernel''' of a [[homomorphism]] measures the degree to which the homomorphism fails to be [[injective function|injective]].<ref>See {{harvnb|Dummit|Foote|2004}} and {{harvnb|Lang|2002}}.</ref> An important special case is the [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel of a linear map]]. The [[kernel (matrix)|kernel of a matrix]], also called the ''null space'', is the kernel of the linear map defined by the matrix.\n\nThe definition of kernel takes various forms in various contexts. But in all of them, the kernel of a homomorphism is trivial (in a sense relevant to that context) if and only if the homomorphism is [[injective function|injective]]. The [[fundamental theorem on homomorphisms]] (or [[first isomorphism theorem]]) is a theorem, again taking various forms, that involves the [[quotient object]] (also called [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] in [[universal algebra]], and [[cokernel]] in [[category theory]]) defined by the kernel.\n\nIn this article, we first survey kernels for some important types of [[algebraic structure]]s; then we give general definitions from [[universal algebra]] for generic algebraic structures.\n\n==Survey of examples==\n\n=== Linear maps ===\n{{Main|Kernel (linear algebra)}}\n\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' be [[vector space]]s over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] (or more generally, [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]) and let ''T'' be a [[linear map]] from ''V'' to ''W''. If '''0'''<sub>''W''</sub> is the [[zero vector]] of ''W'', then the kernel of ''T'' is the [[preimage]] of the [[zero space|zero subspace]] {'''0'''<sub>''W''</sub>}; that is, the [[subset]] of ''V'' consisting of all those elements of ''V'' that are mapped by ''T'' to the element '''0'''<sub>''W''</sub>. The kernel is usually denoted as {{math|ker ''T''}}, or some variation thereof:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{ker} T = \\{\\mathbf{v} \\in V : T(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{0}_{W}\\}\\text{.} </math>\n\nSince a linear map preserves zero vectors, the zero vector '''0'''<sub>''V''</sub> of ''V'' must belong to the kernel. The transformation ''T'' is injective if and only if its kernel is reduced to the zero subspace.\n\nThe kernel ker ''T'' is always a [[linear subspace]] of ''V''. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''V''/(ker ''T''). The first isomorphism theorem for vector spaces states that this quotient space is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the [[image (function)|image]] of ''T'' (which is a subspace of ''W''). As a consequence, the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] of ''V'' equals the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image.\n\nIf ''V'' and ''W'' are [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] and [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] have been chosen, then ''T'' can be described by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'', and the kernel can be computed by solving the homogeneous [[system of linear equations]] {{nowrap|1=''M'''''v''' = '''0'''}}. In this case, the kernel of ''T'' may be identified to the [[kernel (matrix)|kernel of the matrix]] ''M'', also called \"null space\" of ''M''. The dimension of the null space, called the nullity of ''M'', is given by the number of columns of ''M'' minus the [[rank (matrix theory)|rank]] of ''M'', as a consequence of the [[rank–nullity theorem]].\n\nSolving [[homogeneous differential equation]]s often amounts to computing the kernel of certain [[differential operator]]s.\nFor instance, in order to find all twice-[[differentiable function]]s ''f'' from the [[real line]] to itself such that\n\n:<math>xf''(x) + 3f'(x) = f(x),</math>\n\nlet ''V'' be the space of all twice differentiable functions, let ''W'' be the space of all functions, and define a linear operator ''T'' from ''V'' to ''W'' by\n\n:<math>(Tf)(x) = xf''(x) + 3f'(x) - f(x)</math>\n\nfor ''f'' in ''V'' and ''x'' an arbitrary [[real number]].\nThen all solutions to the differential equation are in ker ''T''.\n\nOne can define kernels for homomorphisms between modules over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] in an analogous manner. This includes kernels for homomorphisms between [[abelian group]]s as a special case. This example captures the essence of kernels in general [[abelian categories]]; see [[Kernel (category theory)]].\n\n===Group homomorphisms===\nLet ''G'' and ''H'' be [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and let ''f'' be a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' to ''H''.\nIf ''e''<sub>''H''</sub> is the [[identity element]] of ''H'', then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the preimage of the singleton set {''e''<sub>''H''</sub>}; that is, the subset of ''G'' consisting of all those elements of ''G'' that are mapped by ''f'' to the element ''e''<sub>''H''</sub>.\nThe kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).\nIn symbols:\n: <math> \\operatorname{ker} f = \\{g \\in G : f(g) = e_{H}\\}\\mbox{.}</math>\n\nSince a group homomorphism preserves identity elements, the identity element ''e''<sub>''G''</sub> of ''G'' must belong to the kernel.\nThe homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {''e''<sub>''G''</sub>}. This is true because if the homomorphism ''f'' is not injective, then there exists <math>a, b \\in G</math> with <math>a \\neq b</math> such that <math>f(a)=f(b)</math>. This means that <math>f(a)f(b)^{-1} = e_{H}</math>, which is equivalent to stating that <math>f(ab^{-1}) = e_{H}</math> since group homomorphisms carry inverses into inverses and since <math>f(a)f(b^{-1})=f(ab^{-1})</math>. In other words, <math>ab^{-1} \\in \\operatorname{ker} f</math>. Conversely, if there exists an element <math>g \\neq e_G \\in \\operatorname{ker} f</math>, then <math>f(g)=f(e_G)=e_H</math>, thus ''f'' is not injective.\n\nIt turns out that ker ''f'' is not only a [[subgroup]] of ''G'' but in fact a [[normal subgroup]].\nThus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient group]] ''G''/(ker ''f'').\nThe [[isomorphism theorems|first isomorphism theorem]] for groups states that this quotient group is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a subgroup of ''H'').\n\nIn the special case of [[abelian group]]s, this works in exactly the same way as in the previous section.\n\n===Ring homomorphisms===\nLet ''R'' and ''S'' be [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s (assumed [[unital algebra|unital]]) and let ''f'' be a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to ''S''.\nIf 0<sub>''S''</sub> is the [[zero element]] of ''S'', then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is its kernel as linear map over the integers, or, equivalently, as additive groups. It is the preimage of the [[zero ideal]] {0<sub>''S''</sub>}, which is, the subset of ''R'' consisting of all those elements of ''R'' that are mapped by ''f'' to the element 0<sub>''S''</sub>.\nThe kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).\nIn symbols:\n: <math> \\operatorname{ker} f = \\{r \\in R : f(r) = 0_{S}\\}\\mbox{.} </math>\n\nSince a ring homomorphism preserves zero elements, the zero element 0<sub>''R''</sub> of ''R'' must belong to the kernel.\nThe homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {0<sub>''R''</sub>}.\nThis is always the case if ''R'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], and ''S'' is not the [[zero ring]].\n\nSince ker ''f'' contains the multiplicative identity only when ''S'' is the zero ring, it turns out that the kernel is generally not a [[subring]] of ''R.'' The kernel is a sub[[rng (algebra)|rng]], and, more precisely, a two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''R''.\nThus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient ring]] ''R''/(ker ''f'').\nThe first isomorphism theorem for rings states that this quotient ring is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a subring of ''S''). (note that rings need not be unital for the kernel definition).\n\nTo some extent, this can be thought of as a special case of the situation for modules, since these are all [[bimodule]]s over a ring ''R'':\n* ''R'' itself;\n* any two-sided ideal of ''R'' (such as ker ''f'');\n* any quotient ring of ''R'' (such as ''R''/(ker ''f'')); and\n* the [[codomain]] of any ring homomorphism whose domain is ''R'' (such as ''S'', the codomain of ''f'').\nHowever, the isomorphism theorem gives a stronger result, because ring isomorphisms preserve multiplication while module isomorphisms (even between rings) in general do not.\n\nThis example captures the essence of kernels in general [[Mal'cev algebra]]s.\n\n===Monoid homomorphisms===\nLet ''M'' and ''N'' be [[monoid (algebra)|monoid]]s and let ''f'' be a [[monoid homomorphism]] from ''M'' to ''N''.\nThen the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the subset of the [[direct product]] ''M'' &times; ''M'' consisting of all those [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''M'' whose components are both mapped by ''f'' to the same element in ''N''.\nThe kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).\nIn symbols:\n: <math> \\operatorname{ker} f = \\{(m,m') \\in M \\times M : f(m) = f(m')\\}\\mbox{.} </math>\n\nSince ''f'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], the elements of the form (''m'',''m'') must belong to the kernel.\nThe homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the [[Equality (mathematics)|diagonal set]] {(m,m) : ''m'' in ''M''}.\n\nIt turns out that ker ''f'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', and in fact a [[congruence relation]].\nThus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient monoid]] ''M''/(ker ''f'').\nThe first isomorphism theorem for monoids states that this quotient monoid is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a [[submonoid]] of ''N''),(for the congruence relation).\n\nThis is very different in flavour from the above examples.\nIn particular, the preimage of the identity element of ''N'' is ''not'' enough to determine the kernel of ''f''.\n\n==Universal algebra==\nAll the above cases may be unified and generalized in [[universal algebra]].\n\n===General case===\nLet ''A'' and ''B'' be [[algebraic structure]]s of a given type and let ''f'' be a homomorphism of that type from ''A'' to ''B''.\nThen the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the subset of the [[direct product]] ''A'' &times; ''A'' consisting of all those [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''A'' whose components are both mapped by ''f'' to the same element in ''B''.\nThe kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).\nIn symbols:\n: <math> \\operatorname{ker} f = \\{(a,a') \\in A \\times A : f(a) = f(a')\\}\\mbox{.} </math>\n\nSince ''f'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], the elements of the form (''a'',''a'') must belong to the kernel.\n\nThe homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is exactly the diagonal set {(''a'',''a'') : ''a''&isin;''A''}.\n\nIt is easy to see that ker ''f'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''A'', and in fact a [[congruence relation]].\nThus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] ''A''/(ker ''f'').\nThe [[Isomorphism theorem#General|first isomorphism theorem]] in general universal algebra states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a [[subalgebra]] of ''B'').\n\nNote that the definition of kernel here (as in the monoid example) doesn't depend on the algebraic structure; it is a purely [[Set (mathematics)|set]]-theoretic concept.\nFor more on this general concept, outside of abstract algebra, see [[kernel of a function]].\n\n===Mal'cev algebras===\n{{confusing section|small=no|reason=this section cannot be understood, as referring to a structure which is different from [[Malcev algebra]] and is not defined nor linked|date=December 2016}}\nIn the case of Mal'cev algebras, this construction can be simplified. Every Mal'cev algebra has a special [[neutral element]] (the [[zero vector]] in the case of [[vector space]]s, the [[identity element]] in the case of [[commutative group]]s, and the [[zero element]] in the case of [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s or modules). The characteristic feature of a Mal'cev algebra is that we can recover the entire equivalence relation ker ''f'' from the [[equivalence class]] of the neutral element.\n\nTo be specific, let ''A'' and ''B'' be Mal'cev algebraic structures of a given type and let ''f'' be a homomorphism of that type from ''A'' to ''B''. If ''e''<sub>''B''</sub> is the neutral element of ''B'', then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the [[preimage]] of the [[singleton set]] {''e''<sub>''B''</sub>}; that is, the [[subset]] of ''A'' consisting of all those elements of ''A'' that are mapped by ''f'' to the element ''e''<sub>''B''</sub>.\nThe kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation). In symbols:\n: <math> \\operatorname{ker} f = \\{a \\in A : f(a) = e_{B}\\}\\mbox{.} </math>\n\nSince a Mal'cev algebra homomorphism preserves neutral elements, the identity element ''e''<sub>''A''</sub> of ''A'' must belong to the kernel. The homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {''e''<sub>''A''</sub>}.\n\nThe notion of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generalises to any Mal'cev algebra (as [[linear subspace]] in the case of vector spaces, [[normal subgroup]] in the case of groups, two-sided ideals in the case of rings, and [[submodule]] in the case of [[module (algebra)|module]]s). \nIt turns out that ker ''f'' is not a [[subalgebra]] of ''A'', but it is an ideal.\nThen it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] ''G''/(ker ''f'').\nThe first isomorphism theorem for Mal'cev algebras states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a subalgebra of ''B'').\n\nThe connection between this and the congruence relation for more general types of algebras is as follows.\nFirst, the kernel-as-an-ideal is the equivalence class of the neutral element ''e''<sub>''A''</sub> under the kernel-as-a-congruence. For the converse direction, we need the notion of [[quotient]] in the Mal'cev algebra (which is [[division (mathematics)|division]] on either side for groups and [[subtraction]] for vector spaces, modules, and rings).\nUsing this, elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''A'' are equivalent under the kernel-as-a-congruence if and only if their quotient ''a''/''b'' is an element of the kernel-as-an-ideal.\n\n==Algebras with nonalgebraic structure==\nSometimes algebras are equipped with a nonalgebraic structure in addition to their algebraic operations.\nFor example, one may consider [[topological group]]s or [[topological vector space]]s, with are equipped with a [[topology (structure)|topology]].\nIn this case, we would expect the homomorphism ''f'' to preserve this additional structure; in the topological examples, we would want ''f'' to be a [[continuous map]].\nThe process may run into a snag with the quotient algebras, which may not be well-behaved.\nIn the topological examples, we can avoid problems by requiring that topological algebraic structures be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (as is usually done); then the kernel (however it is constructed) will be a [[closed set]] and the [[quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] will work fine (and also be Hausdorff).\n\n==Kernels in category theory==\nThe notion of ''kernel'' in [[category theory]] is a generalisation of the kernels of abelian algebras; see [[Kernel (category theory)]].\nThe categorical generalisation of the kernel as a congruence relation is the ''[[kernel pair]]''.\n(There is also the notion of [[difference kernel]], or binary [[equalizer (mathematics)|equaliser]].)\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Kernel (linear algebra)]]\n* [[Zero set]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Cite book\n | ref = harv\n | last1 = Dummit\n | first1 = David S.\n | last2 = Foote\n | first2 = Richard M.\n | title = Abstract Algebra\n | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]\n | year = 2004\n | edition = 3rd\n | isbn=0-471-43334-9\n}}\n\n*{{Cite book\n | ref = harv\n | last=Lang\n | first=Serge\n | authorlink=Serge Lang\n | title=Algebra\n | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]\n | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]]\n | year=2002\n | isbn=0-387-95385-X\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kernel (Algebra)}}\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n[[Category:Isomorphism theorems]]\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]"

In 1070 he moved to Samarkand, where he was employed by Abu Tahir, governor and chief judge of the city. During this time [[1070]], he wrote his most famous algebraic work, the Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra and Balancing (''Risāla fī’l-barāhīn ˓ala masā’il al-jabr wa’l-muqābala'' ) which was dedicated to his mentor,  judge Abu Tahir <ref name=Rosenfeld>Boris A.

In 1076 Khayyam was invited to [[Isfahan]] by the [[vizier]] and political figure [[Nizam al-Mulk]] to take advantage of the libraries and centers in learning there. It was at this time that he began to study the work of Greek mathematicians [[Euclid]] and [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] much more closely. At the request of vizier Nizam-ul-Mulk, he proceeded to set up an observatory in Isfahan, leading a group of scientists in carrying out precise astronomical observations aimed at the revision of the Persian calendar. In 1079 he and his team concluded their measurements of the length of the year, made with astounding accuracy, reporting it to 14 significant figures as: 365.24219858156 days. In fact, according to the highest precision modern measurements, this is correct in the first eight figures, and the variation from year to year occurs in the eighth figure, making the calendar he devised the most accurately based system ever in use.\n \nAfter the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (murdered, it is thought, by the [[Ismaili]] [[order of Assassins]]), Omar fell from favour at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]].

His surviving mathematical works include: ''A commentary on the difficulties concerning the postulates of Euclid's Elements'' ({{lang|ar|Risāla fī šarḥ mā aškala min muṣādarāt kitāb Uqlīdis}}, completed in December 1077<ref name=\"Iranica Online\" />), ''On the division of a [[Quadrant (circle)|quadrant of a circle]]'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah fī qismah rub‘ al-dā’irah}}, undated but completed prior to the treatise on algebra<ref name=\"Iranica Online\" />), and ''On proofs for problems concerning Algebra'' ({{lang|ar-Latn|Maqāla fi l-jabr wa l-muqābala}}, most likely completed in 1079<ref name=\"Struik\" />{{rp|281}}).

Khayyam refutes the previous attempts by other mathematicians to ''prove'' the proposition, mainly on grounds that each of them had postulated something that was by no means easier to admit than the Fifth Postulate itself.<ref name=\"Iranica Online\" /> Drawing upon [[Aristotle]]'s views, he rejects the usage of movement in geometry and therefore dismisses the different attempt by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Al-Haytham]].<ref name=\"rozenfeld-ch2\">{{harv|Rozenfeld|1988|pp=64–65}}</ref><ref name=\"katz\">{{harv|Katz|1998|p=270}}.

The hypothesis of the acute, obtuse, and that of the right angle are now known to lead respectively to the non-Euclidean [[hyperbolic geometry]] of Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, to that of [[Riemannian geometry]], and to [[Euclidean geometry]].<ref>Rolwing, R. & Levine, M.

[[John Wallis]], professor of geometry at Oxford, translated Tusi's commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometrician [[Girolamo Saccheri]], whose work (''euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'', 1733) is generally considered as the first step in the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics, [[David Eugene Smith]] mentions that Saccheri \"used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose\".

In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of [[irrational number]].<ref name=\"Iranica Online\" /> Displeased with Euclid's definition of equal ratios, he redefined the concept of a number by the use of a continuous fraction as the means of expressing a ratio. Rosenfeld and Youschkevitch (1973) argue that \"by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number.\" Likewise, it was noted by [[Dirk Jan Struik|D.

Princeton Legacy Library: Michael Beard</ref> Hedayat (1923) states that \"while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine.\"<ref>Katouzian, H.

The French translator J. B. Nicolas held that Omar's constant exhortations to drink wine should not be taken literally, but should be regarded rather in the light of Sufi thought where rapturous intoxication by \"wine\" is to be understood as a metaphor for the enlightened state or divine rapture of ''[[baqaa]]''.<ref>Albano, G.

      "text": "{{italic title}}\n'''''Laws of Form''''' (hereinafter '''''LoF''''') is a book by [[G. Spencer-Brown]], published in 1969, that straddles the boundary between [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]]. ''LoF'' describes three distinct [[logical system]]s:\n* The \"primary arithmetic\" (described in Chapter 4 of ''LoF''), whose models include [[Two-element Boolean algebra#Some basic identities|Boolean arithmetic]];\n* The \"primary [[algebra]]\" (Chapter 6 of ''LoF''), whose [[interpretation (logic)|models]] include the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] (hereinafter abbreviated '''2'''), [[Boolean logic]], and the classical [[propositional calculus]];\n* \"Equations of the second degree\" (Chapter 11), whose [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] include [[finite automata]] and [[Alonzo Church]]'s Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA).\n\n\"Boundary algebra\" is Meguire's (2011)<ref>Meguire, P. (2011) Boundary Algebra: A Simpler Approach to Basic Logic and Boolean Algebra. Saarbrücken: VDM Publishing Ltd. 168pp</ref> term for the union of the primary algebra and the primary arithmetic. ''Laws of Form'' sometimes loosely refers to the \"primary algebra\" as well as to ''LoF''.\n\n==The book==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}\n''LoF'' emerged from work in electronic engineering its author did around 1960, and from subsequent lectures on [[mathematical logic]] he gave under the auspices of the [[University of London]]'s extension program. ''LoF'' has appeared in several editions, the most recent being a 1997 German translation, and has never gone out of print.{{when|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe mathematics fills only about 55pp and is rather elementary.{{OR|date=November 2018}} But ''LoF'''s mystical and declamatory prose, and its love of [[paradox]], make it a challenging read for all. Spencer-Brown was influenced by [[Wittgenstein]] and [[R. D. Laing]]. ''LoF'' also echoes a number of themes from the writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]].\n\nThe entire book is written in an operational way, giving instructions to the reader instead of telling them what \"is\". In accordance with G. Spencer-Brown's interest in paradoxes, the only sentence that makes a statement that something is, is the statement, which says no such statements are used in this book.<ref>Felix Lau: ''Die Form der Paradoxie'', 2005 Carl-Auer Verlag, {{ISBN|9783896703521}}</ref> Except for this one sentence the book can be seen as an example of [[E-Prime]].\n\n==Reception==\nOstensibly a work of formal mathematics and philosophy, ''LoF'' became something of a [[cult classic]], praised in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]''. Those who agree point to ''LoF'' as embodying an enigmatic \"mathematics of [[consciousness]],\" its algebraic symbolism capturing an (perhaps even \"the\") implicit root of [[cognition]]:  the ability to \"distinguish\". ''LoF'' argues that primary algebra reveals striking connections among [[logic]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], and arithmetic, and the [[philosophy of language]] and [[Philosophy of mind|mind]].\n\nBanaschewski (1977)<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1093888028 | author=B. Banaschewski | title=On G. Spencer Brown's Laws of Form | journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic | volume=18 | number=3 | pages=507–509 | date=Jul 1977 | doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093888028 }}</ref> argues that the primary algebra is nothing but new notation for Boolean algebra. Indeed, the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] '''2''' can be seen as the intended interpretation of the primary algebra. Yet the notation of the primary algebra:\n* Fully exploits the [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] characterizing not just [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s but all [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s;\n*Highlights how syntactically distinct statements in logic and '''2''' can have identical [[semantics]];\n* Dramatically simplifies Boolean algebra calculations, and proofs in [[sentential logic|sentential]] and [[syllogism|syllogistic]] [[logic]].\nMoreover, the syntax of the primary algebra can be extended to formal systems other than '''2''' and sentential logic, resulting in boundary mathematics (see Related Work below).\n\n''LoF'' has influenced, among others, [[Heinz von Foerster]], [[Louis Kauffman]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]] and [[William Bricken]]. Some of these authors have modified the primary algebra in a variety of interesting ways.\n\n''LoF'' claimed that certain well-known mathematical conjectures of very long standing, such as the [[Four Color Theorem]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], are provable using extensions of the primary algebra. Spencer-Brown eventually circulated a purported proof of the Four Color Theorem, but it met with skepticism.<ref>For a sympathetic evaluation, see [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0112266 Kauffman (2001)].</ref>\n\n==The form (Chapter 1)==\nThe symbol:\n\n:[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]\n\nalso called the \"mark\" or \"cross\", is the essential feature of the Laws of Form. In Spencer-Brown's inimitable and enigmatic fashion, the Mark symbolizes the root of [[cognition]], i.e., the [[duality (mathematics)|dualistic]] Mark indicates the capability of differentiating a \"this\" from \"everything else ''but'' this.\"\n\nIn ''LoF'', a Cross denotes the drawing of a \"distinction\", and can be thought of as signifying the following, all at once:\n* The act of drawing a boundary around something, thus separating it from everything else;\n* That which becomes distinct from everything by drawing the boundary;\n* Crossing from one side of the boundary to the other.\n\nAll three ways imply an action on the part of the cognitive entity (e.g., person) making the distinction.  As ''LoF'' puts it:\n<blockquote>\n\"The first command:\n* Draw a distinction\ncan well be expressed in such ways as:\n* Let there be a distinction,\n* Find a distinction,\n* See a distinction,\n* Describe a distinction,\n* Define a distinction,\nOr:\n* Let a distinction be drawn.\" (''LoF'', Notes to chapter 2)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe counterpoint to the Marked state is the Unmarked state, which is simply nothing, the void, or the un-expressable infinite represented by a blank space. It is simply the absence of a Cross. No distinction has been made and nothing has been crossed. The Marked state and the void are the two primitive values of the Laws of Form.\n\nThe Cross can be seen as denoting the distinction between two states, one \"considered as a symbol\" and another not so considered. From this fact arises a curious resonance with some theories of [[consciousness]] and [[language]]. Paradoxically, the Form is at once Observer and Observed, and is also the creative act of making an observation. ''LoF'' (excluding back matter) closes with the words:\n\n\"...the first distinction, the Mark and the observer are not only interchangeable, but, in the form, identical.\"\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] came to a related insight in the 1890s; see [[#Related work|Related Work]].\n\n==The primary arithmetic (Chapter 4)==\nThe [[syntax]] of the primary arithmetic goes as follows. There are just two [[atomic formula|atomic expressions]]:\n* The empty Cross [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]  ;\n*All or part of the blank page (the \"void\").\nThere are two inductive rules:\n* A Cross [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]  may be written over any expression;\n* Any two expressions may be [[concatenation|concatenated]].\nThe [[semantics]] of the primary arithmetic are perhaps nothing more than the sole explicit [[definition]] in ''LoF'': \"Distinction is perfect continence\".\n\nLet the \"unmarked state\" be a synonym for the void. Let an empty Cross denote the \"marked state\". To cross is to move from one value, the unmarked or marked state, to the other. We can now state the \"arithmetical\" [[axiom]]s A1 and A2, which ground the primary arithmetic (and hence all of the Laws of Form):\n\n\"A1. The law of Calling\". Calling twice from a state is indistinguishable from calling once. To make a distinction twice has the same effect as making it once. For example, saying \"Let there be light\" and then saying \"Let there be light\" again, is the same as saying it once.  Formally:\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] <math>\\ =</math>[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]\n\n\"A2. The law of Crossing.\" After crossing from the unmarked to the marked state, crossing again (\"recrossing\") starting from the marked state returns one to the unmarked state. Hence recrossing annuls crossing. Formally:\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]] <math>\\ =</math>\n\nIn both A1 and A2, the expression to the right of '=' has fewer symbols than the expression to the left of '='. This suggests that every primary arithmetic expression can, by repeated application of A1 and A2, be ''simplified'' to one of two states: the marked or the unmarked state. This is indeed the case, and the result is the expression's \"simplification\". The two fundamental metatheorems of the primary arithmetic state that:\n* Every finite expression has a unique simplification. (T3 in ''LoF'');\n* Starting from an initial marked or unmarked state, \"complicating\" an expression by a finite number of repeated application of A1 and A2 cannot yield an expression whose simplification differs from the initial state. (T4 in ''LoF'').\nThus the [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] of [[logical equivalence]] [[partition of a set|partitions]] all primary arithmetic expressions into two [[equivalence class]]es: those that simplify to the Cross, and those that simplify to the void.\n\nA1 and A2 have loose analogs in the properties of series and parallel electrical circuits, and in other ways of diagramming processes, including flowcharting. A1 corresponds to a parallel connection and A2 to a series connection, with the understanding that making a distinction corresponds to changing how two points in a circuit are connected, and not simply to adding wiring.\n\nThe primary arithmetic is analogous to the following formal languages from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]:\n* A [[Dyck language]] of order 1 with a null alphabet;\n* The simplest [[context-free language]] in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]];\n* A [[rewrite system]] that is [[strongly normalizing]] and [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]].\n\nThe phrase \"calculus of indications\" in ''LoF'' is a synonym for \"primary arithmetic\".\n\n===The notion of canon===\nA concept peculiar to ''LoF'' is that of \"canon\". While ''LoF'' does not define canon, the following two excerpts from the Notes to chpt. 2 are apt:\n\n<blockquote>\"The more important structures of command are sometimes called ''canons''. They are the ways in which the guiding injunctions appear to group themselves in constellations, and are thus by no means independent of each other. A canon bears the distinction of being outside (i.e., describing) the system under construction, but a command to construct (e.g., 'draw a distinction'), even though it may be of central importance, is not a canon. A canon is an order, or set of orders, to permit or allow, but not to construct or create.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"...the primary form of mathematical communication is not description but injunction... Music is a similar art form, the composer does not even attempt to describe the set of sounds he has in mind, much less the set of feelings occasioned through them, but writes down a set of commands which, if they are obeyed by the performer, can result in a reproduction, to the listener, of the composer's original experience.\"</blockquote>\n\nThese excerpts relate to the distinction in [[metalogic]] between the [[object language]], the formal language of the logical system under discussion, and the [[metalanguage]], a language (often a natural language) distinct from the object language, employed to exposit and discuss the object language. The first quote seems to assert that the ''canons'' are part of the metalanguage. The second quote seems to assert that statements in the object language are essentially commands addressed to the reader by the author. Neither assertion holds in standard metalogic.\n\n==The primary algebra (Chapter 6)==\n\n===Syntax===\nGiven any valid primary arithmetic expression, insert into one or more locations any number of Latin letters bearing optional numerical subscripts; the result is a primary algebra [[formula]]. Letters so employed in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] are called [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. A primary algebra variable indicates a location where one can write the primitive value [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] or its complement [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]]. Multiple instances of the same variable denote multiple locations of the same primitive value.\n\n===Rules governing logical equivalence===\nThe sign '=' may link two logically equivalent expressions; the result is an [[equation]]. By \"logically equivalent\" is meant that the two expressions have the same simplification. [[Logical equivalence]] is an [[equivalence relation]] over the set of primary algebra formulas, governed by the rules R1 and R2. Let \"C\" and \"D\" be formulae each containing at least one instance of the subformula ''A'':\n*'''R1''', ''Substitution of equals''. Replace ''one or more'' instances of ''A'' in ''C'' by ''B'', resulting in ''E''. If ''A''=''B'', then ''C''=''E''.\n*'''R2''', ''Uniform replacement''. Replace ''all'' instances of ''A'' in ''C'' and ''D'' with ''B''. ''C'' becomes ''E'' and ''D'' becomes ''F''. If ''C''=''D'', then ''E''=''F''. Note that ''A''=''B'' is not required.\n'''R2''' is employed very frequently in ''primary algebra'' demonstrations (see below), almost always silently. These rules are routinely invoked in [[logic]] and most of mathematics, nearly always unconsciously.\n\nThe ''primary algebra'' consists of [[equations]], i.e., pairs of formulae linked by an infix '='. '''R1''' and '''R2''' enable transforming one equation into another. Hence the ''primary algebra'' is an ''equational''  formal system, like the many [[algebraic structures]], including [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], that are [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]]. Equational logic was common before ''Principia Mathematica'' (e.g., Peirce,<sup>1,2,3</sup> Johnson 1892), and has present-day advocates (Gries and Schneider 1993).\n\nConventional [[mathematical logic]] consists of [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] formulae, signalled by a prefixed [[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]. To denote that the ''primary algebra'' formula ''A'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], simply write \"''A'' =[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] \". If one replaces '=' in '''R1''' and '''R2''' with the [[biconditional]], the resulting rules hold in conventional logic. However, conventional logic relies mainly on the rule [[modus ponens]]; thus conventional logic is ''ponential''. The equational-ponential dichotomy distills much of what distinguishes mathematical logic from the rest of mathematics.\n\n===Initials===\nAn ''initial'' is a ''primary algebra'' equation verifiable by a [[decision procedure]] and as such is ''not'' an [[axiom]]. ''LoF'' lays down the initials:\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n*J1:\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n|\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| A\n|}\n| A\n|}\n|}\n| = .\n|}\nThe absence of anything to the right of the \"=\" above, is deliberate.\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n*J2:\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n|\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| A\n|}\n|\n{|style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| B\n|}\n|}\n|}\n| C\n| =\n|\n{|style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n|\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| A C\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| B C\n|}\n|}\n|}\n|.\n|}\n\n\n'''J2''' is the familiar [[distributive law]] of [[sentential logic]] and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].\n\nAnother set of initials, friendlier to calculations, is:\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n*J0:\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n|\n{|\n|-\n|\n|}\n|}\n|}\n| A\n| =\n| A.\n|}\n\n{|\n|-\n|\n*J1a:\n|\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| A\n|}\n| A\n|}\n| =\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n|\n{|\n|-\n|\n|}\n|}\n|.\n|}\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n*C2:\n| A\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| A B\n|}\n| = \n| A\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|-\n| B\n|}\n|.\n|}\n\nIt is thanks to '''C2''' that the ''primary algebra'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. By virtue of '''J1a''', it is a [[complemented lattice]] whose upper bound is [[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif]]. By '''J0''', [[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif]] is the corresponding lower bound and [[identity element]]. '''J0''' is also an algebraic version of '''A2''' and makes clear the sense in which [[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif]] aliases with the blank page.\n\nT13 in ''LoF'' generalizes '''C2''' as follows. Any ''primary algebra'' (or sentential logic) formula ''B'' can be viewed as an [[ordered tree]] with ''branches''. Then:\n\n'''T13''': A [[formula|subformula]] ''A'' can be copied at will into any depth of ''B'' greater than that of ''A'', as long as ''A'' and its copy are in the same branch of ''B''. Also, given multiple instances of ''A'' in the same branch of ''B'', all instances but the shallowest are redundant.\n\nWhile a proof of T13 would require [[mathematical induction|induction]], the intuition underlying it should be clear.\n\n'''C2''' or its equivalent is named:\n*\"Generation\" in ''LoF'';\n*\"Exclusion\" in Johnson (1892);\n*\"Pervasion\" in the work of William Bricken.\nPerhaps the first instance of an axiom or rule with the power of '''C2''' was the \"Rule of (De)Iteration,\" combining T13 and ''AA=A'', of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]]'s [[existential graph]]s.\n\n''LoF'' asserts that concatenation can be read as [[commutativity|commuting]] and [[associativity|associating]] by default and hence need not be explicitly assumed or demonstrated. (Peirce made a similar assertion about his [[existential graph]]s.) Let a period be a temporary notation to establish grouping. That concatenation commutes and associates may then be demonstrated from the:\n* Initial ''AC.D''=''CD.A'' and the consequence ''AA''=''A'' (Byrne 1946). This result holds for all [[lattice (order)|lattices]], because ''AA''=''A'' is an easy consequence of the [[absorption law]], which holds for all lattices;\n* Initials ''AC.D''=''AD.C'' and '''J0'''. Since '''J0''' holds only for lattices with a lower bound, this method holds only for [[bounded lattice]]s (which include the ''primary algebra'' and '''2'''). Commutativity is trivial; just set ''A''=[[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif]]. Associativity: ''AC.D'' = ''CA.D'' = ''CD.A'' = ''A.CD''.\nHaving demonstrated associativity, the period can be discarded.\n\nThe initials in Meguire (2011) are ''AC.D''=''CD.A'', called '''B1'''; '''B2''', J0 above; '''B3''', J1a above; and '''B4''', C2. By design, these initials are very similar to the axioms for an [[abelian group]], '''G1-G3''' below.\n\n===Proof theory===\nThe ''primary algebra'' contains three kinds of proved assertions:\n* ''Consequence'' is a ''primary algebra'' equation verified by a ''demonstration''. A demonstration consists of a sequence of ''steps'', each step justified by an initial or a previously demonstrated consequence.\n* ''[[Theorem]]'' is a statement in the [[metalanguage]] verified by a ''[[Mathematical proof|proof]]'', i.e., an argument, formulated in the metalanguage, that is accepted by trained mathematicians and logicians.\n* ''Initial'', defined above. Demonstrations and proofs invoke an initial as if it were an axiom.\n\nThe distinction between consequence and [[theorem]] holds for all formal systems, including mathematics and logic, but is usually not made explicit. A demonstration or [[decision procedure]] can be carried out and verified by computer. The [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of a [[theorem]] cannot be.\n\nLet ''A'' and ''B'' be ''primary algebra'' [[formula]]s. A demonstration of ''A''=''B'' may proceed in either of two ways:\n* Modify ''A'' in steps until ''B'' is obtained, or vice versa;\n* Simplify both [[Image:Laws of Form - (A)B.png|50px]] and [[Image:Laws of Form - (B)A.png|50px]] to [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]. This is known as a \"calculation\".\nOnce ''A''=''B'' has been demonstrated, ''A''=''B'' can be invoked to justify steps in subsequent demonstrations. ''primary algebra'' demonstrations and calculations often require no more than '''J1a''', '''J2''', '''C2''', and the consequences [[Image:Laws of Form - ()A=().png|80px]] ('''C3''' in ''LoF''), [[Image:Laws of Form - ((A))=A.png|80px]] ('''C1'''), and ''AA''=''A'' ('''C5''').\n\nThe consequence [[Image:Laws of Form - (((A)B)C)=(AC)((B)C).png|170px]], '''C7''' in ''LoF'', enables an [[algorithm]], sketched in ''LoF''s proof of T14, that transforms an arbitrary ''primary algebra'' formula to an equivalent formula whose depth does not exceed two. The result is a ''normal form'', the ''primary algebra'' analog of the [[conjunctive normal form]]. ''LoF'' (T14-15) proves the ''primary algebra'' analog of the well-known [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] theorem that every formula has a normal form.\n\nLet ''A'' be a [[formula|subformula]] of some [[formula]] ''B''. When paired with '''C3''', '''J1a''' can be viewed as the closure condition for calculations: ''B'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] [[if and only if]] ''A'' and (''A'') both appear in depth 0 of ''B''. A related condition appears in some versions of [[natural deduction]]. A demonstration by calculation is often little more than:\n* Invoking T13 repeatedly to eliminate redundant subformulae;\n* Erasing any subformulae having the form [[Image:Laws of Form - ((A)A).png|50px]].\nThe last step of a calculation always invokes '''J1a'''.\n\n''LoF'' includes elegant new proofs of the following standard [[metatheory]]:\n* ''[[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]'': all ''primary algebra'' consequences are demonstrable from the initials (T17).\n* ''[[axiom|Independence]]'': '''J1''' cannot be demonstrated from '''J2''' and vice versa (T18).\nThat [[sentential logic]] is complete is taught in every first university course in [[mathematical logic]]. But university courses in Boolean algebra seldom mention the completeness of '''2'''.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIf the Marked and Unmarked states are read as the [[two-element Boolean algebra|Boolean]] values 1 and 0 (or '''True''' and '''False'''), the ''primary algebra'' [[interpretation (logic)|interprets]] '''[[two-element Boolean algebra|2]]''' (or [[sentential logic]]). ''LoF'' shows how the ''primary algebra'' can interpret the [[syllogism]]. Each of these [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] is discussed in a subsection below. Extending the ''primary algebra'' so that it could [[interpretation (logic)|interpret]] standard [[first-order logic]] has yet to be done, but [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s ''beta'' [[existential graph]]s suggest that this extension is feasible.\n\n====Two-element Boolean algebra 2====\nThe ''primary algebra'' is an elegant minimalist notation for the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] '''2'''. Let:\n* One of Boolean [[join (mathematics)|join]] (+) or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] (×) interpret [[concatenation]];\n* The [[Complement (order theory)|complement]] of ''A'' interpret [[Image:Laws of Form - not a.gif]]\n* 0 (1) interpret the empty Mark if join (meet) interprets [[concatenation]] (because a binary operation applied to zero operands may be regarded as being equal to the [[identity element]] of that operation; or to put it in another way, an operand that is missing could be regarded as acting by default like the identity element). \nIf join (meet) interprets ''AC'', then meet (join) interprets ((''A'')(''C'')). Hence the ''primary algebra'' and '''2''' are isomorphic but for one detail: ''primary algebra'' complementation can be nullary, in which case it denotes a primitive value. Modulo this detail, '''2''' is a [[model theory|model]] of the primary algebra. The primary arithmetic suggests the following arithmetic axiomatization of '''2''': 1+1=1+0=0+1=1=~0, and 0+0=0=~1.\n\nThe [[Set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\\ B=\\{</math>[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] <math>,</math> [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]]<math>\\ \\}</math> is the [[Boolean domain]] or ''carrier''. In the language of [[universal algebra]], the ''primary algebra'' is the [[algebraic structure]] <math>\\lang B,--,(-),() \\rang</math> of type <math>\\lang 2,1,0 \\rang</math>. The [[functional completeness|expressive adequacy]] of the [[Sheffer stroke]] points to the ''primary algebra'' also being a <math>\\lang B,(--),()\\rang</math> algebra of type <math>\\lang 2,0 \\rang</math>. In both cases, the identities are J1a, J0, C2, and ''ACD=CDA''. Since the ''primary algebra'' and '''2''' are [[isomorphic]], '''2''' can be seen as a <math>\\lang B,+,\\lnot,1 \\rang</math> algebra of type <math>\\lang 2,1,0 \\rang</math>. This description of '''2''' is simpler than the conventional one, namely an <math>\\lang B,+,\\times,\\lnot,1,0 \\rang</math> algebra of type <math>\\lang 2,2,1,0,0 \\rang</math>.\n\nThe two possible interpretations are dual to each other in the Boolean sense. (In Boolean algebra, exchanging AND &harr; OR and 1 &harr; 0 throughout an equation yields an equally valid equation.) The identities remain invariant regardless of which interpretation is chosen, so the transformations or modes of calculation remain the same; only the interpretation of each form would be different. Example: J1a is [[Image:Laws of Form - (A)A=().png|80px]]. Interpreting juxtaposition as OR and [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif|30px]] as 1, this translates to <math>\\neg A \\lor A = 1</math> which is true. Interpreting juxtaposition as AND and [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif|30px]] as 0, this translates to <math>\\neg A \\land A = 0</math> which is true as well (and the dual of <math>\\neg A \\lor A = 1</math>).\n\n====Sentential logic====\nLet the blank page denote '''True''' or '''False''', and let a Cross be read as '''Not'''. Then the primary arithmetic has the following sentential reading:\n\n:::&nbsp;= &nbsp; '''False'''\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] &nbsp;= &nbsp;'''True''' &nbsp;= &nbsp;'''not False'''\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]] &nbsp;= &nbsp;'''Not True''' &nbsp;= &nbsp;'''False'''\n\nThe ''primary algebra'' interprets sentential logic as follows. A letter represents any given sentential expression. Thus:\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - not a.gif]] interprets '''Not A'''\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - a or b.gif]] interprets '''A Or B'''\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - if a then b.gif]] interprets '''Not A Or B'''  or   '''If A Then B'''.\n\n::[[Image:Laws of Form - a and b.gif]] interprets '''Not (Not A Or Not B)'''\n:::::or '''Not (If A Then Not B)'''\n:::::or '''A And B'''.\n\n{|\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n| <big><big><big>a\n|}\n| <big><big><big>b\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n| <big><big><big>a\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n| <big><big><big>b\n|}\n|}\n|}\n|,\n|\n{|\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n| <big><big><big>a\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n| <big><big><big>b\n|}\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;\"\n| <big><big><big>a b\n|}\n|}\n| both interpret '''A [[if and only if]] B''' or '''A is [[logical equivalence|equivalent]] to B'''.\n|}\n\nThus any expression in [[sentential logic]] has a ''primary algebra'' translation. Equivalently, the ''primary algebra'' [[interpretation (logic)|interprets]] sentential logic. Given an assignment of every variable to the Marked or Unmarked states, this ''primary algebra'' translation reduces to a primary arithmetic expression, which can be simplified. Repeating this exercise for all possible assignments of the two primitive values to each variable, reveals whether the original expression is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[Satisfiability|satisfiable]]. This is an example of a [[decision procedure]], one more or less in the spirit of conventional truth tables. Given some ''primary algebra'' formula containing ''N'' variables, this decision procedure requires simplifying 2<sup>''N''</sup> primary arithmetic formulae. For a less tedious decision procedure more in the spirit of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s \"truth value analysis,\" see Meguire (2003).\n\nSchwartz (1981) proved that the ''primary algebra'' is equivalent -- [[syntax|syntactically]], [[semantics|semantically]], and [[proof theory|proof theoretically]]—with the [[Propositional calculus|classical propositional calculus]]. Likewise, it can be shown that the ''primary algebra'' is syntactically equivalent with expressions built up in the usual way from the classical [[truth value]]s '''true''' and '''false''', the [[logical connective]]s NOT, OR, and AND, and parentheses.\n\nInterpreting the Unmarked State as '''False''' is wholly arbitrary; that state can equally well be read as '''True'''. All that is required is that the interpretation of [[concatenation]] change from OR to AND. IF A THEN B now translates as [[Image:Laws of Form - (A(B)).png|50px]] instead of [[Image:Laws of Form - (A)B.png|50px]]. More generally, the ''primary algebra'' is \"self-[[Duality (mathematics)|dual]],\" meaning that any ''primary algebra'' formula has two [[sentential logic|sentential]] or [[two-element Boolean algebra|Boolean]] readings, each the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of the other. Another consequence of self-duality is the irrelevance of [[De Morgan's laws]]; those laws are built into the syntax of the ''primary algebra'' from the outset.\n\nThe true nature of the distinction between the ''primary algebra'' on the one hand, and '''2''' and sentential logic on the other, now emerges. In the latter formalisms, [[Logical complement|complementation]]/[[negation]] operating on \"nothing\" is not well-formed. But an empty Cross is a well-formed ''primary algebra'' expression, denoting the Marked state, a primitive value. Hence a nonempty Cross is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]], while an empty Cross is an [[operand]] because it denotes a primitive value. Thus the ''primary algebra'' reveals that the heretofore distinct mathematical concepts of operator and operand are in fact merely different facets of a single fundamental action, the making of a distinction.\n\n====Syllogisms====\nAppendix 2 of ''LoF'' shows how to translate traditional [[syllogism]]s and [[polysyllogism|sorites]] into the ''primary algebra''. A valid syllogism is simply one whose ''primary algebra'' translation simplifies to an empty Cross. Let ''A''* denote a ''literal'', i.e., either ''A'' or (''A''), indifferently. Then every syllogism that does not require that one or more terms be assumed nonempty is one of 24 possible permutations of a generalization of [[syllogism|Barbara]] whose ''primary algebra'' equivalent is (''A''*''B'')((''B'')''C''*)''A''*''C''*. These 24 possible permutations include the 19 syllogistic forms deemed valid in [[Aristotelian logic|Aristotelian]] and [[medieval logic]]. This ''primary algebra'' translation of syllogistic logic also suggests that the ''primary algebra'' can [[interpretation (logic)|interpret]] [[monadic logic|monadic]] and [[term logic]], and that the ''primary algebra'' has affinities to the [[Boolean term schema]]ta of Quine (1982: Part II).\n\n===An example of calculation===\nThe following calculation of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s nontrivial ''Praeclarum Theorema'' exemplifies the demonstrative power of the ''primary algebra''. Let C1 be ((''A''))=''A'', C2 be ''A''(''A'' ''B'')=''A''(''B''), C3 be ()''A''=(), J1a be (''A'')''A''=(), and let OI mean that variables and subformulae have been reordered in a way that commutativity and associativity permit.\n\n{|\n| [(''P''→''R'')∧(''Q''→''S'')]→[(''P''∧''Q'')→(''R''∧''S'')].\n| ''Praeclarum Theorema''.\n|-\n|\n{|\n|\n{| style=\"border-top: 2px solid black;

Hence the seldom-noted fact that Boolean algebras are [[magma (algebra)|magmas]]. (Magmas were called [[groupoid]]s until the latter term was appropriated by [[category theory]].) To see this, note that the ''primary algebra'' is a [[commutative]]:\n*[[Semigroup]] because ''primary algebra'' juxtaposition [[Commutative property|commute]]s and [[associative property|associates]];\n*[[Monoid]] with [[identity element]] [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]], by virtue of '''J0'''.\n\n[[group (mathematics)|Groups]] also require a [[unary operation]], called [[Group (mathematics)#Definition|inverse]], the group counterpart of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean complementation]]. Let [[Image:Laws of Form - (a).png|20px]] denote the inverse of ''a''. Let [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] denote the group [[identity element]]. Then groups and the ''primary algebra'' have the same [[signature (logic)|signatures]], namely they are both 〈--,(-),()〉 algebras of type 〈2,1,0〉. Hence the ''primary algebra'' is a [[list of algebraic structures|boundary algebra]]. The axioms for an [[abelian group]], in boundary notation, are:\n* '''G1'''. ''abc'' = ''acb'' (assuming association from the left);\n* '''G2'''. [[Image:Laws of Form - ()a=a.png|80px]]\n* '''G3'''. [[Image:Laws of Form - (a)a=().png|80px]].\nFrom '''G1''' and '''G2''', the commutativity and associativity of concatenation may be derived, as above. Note that '''G3''' and '''J1a''' are identical. '''G2''' and '''J0''' would be identical if &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif|25px]]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif|20px]]&nbsp;&nbsp; replaced '''A2'''. This is the defining arithmetical identity of group theory, in boundary notation.\n\nThe ''primary algebra'' differs from an [[abelian group]] in two ways:\n*From '''A2''', it follows that [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]] ≠ [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]. If the ''primary algebra'' were a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]] = [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] would hold, and one of &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Laws of Form - (a).png|20px]]&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif|30px]]&nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif|30px]]&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;&nbsp; would have to be a ''primary algebra'' consequence. Note that [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif|20px]] and [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif|25px]] are mutual ''primary algebra'' complements, as group theory requires, so that ((())) = () is true of both group theory and the ''primary algebra'';\n*'''C2''' most clearly demarcates the ''primary algebra'' from other magmas, because '''C2''' enables demonstrating the [[absorption law]] that defines [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and the [[distributive law]] central to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].\nBoth '''A2''' and '''C2''' follow from ''B'' 's being an [[ordered set]].\n\n==Equations of the second degree (Chapter 11)==\nChapter 11 of ''LoF'' introduces ''equations of the second degree'', composed of [[recursion|recursive]] formulae that can be seen as having \"infinite\" depth. Some recursive formulae simplify to the marked or unmarked state. Others \"oscillate\" indefinitely between the two states depending on whether a given depth is even or odd. Specifically, certain recursive formulae can be interpreted as oscillating between '''true''' and '''false''' over successive intervals of time, in which case a formula is deemed to have an \"imaginary\" truth value. Thus the flow of time may be introduced into the ''primary algebra''.\n\nTurney (1986) shows how these recursive formulae can be interpreted via [[Alonzo Church]]'s Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA). Church introduced RRA in 1955 as an axiomatic formalization of [[finite automata]]. Turney (1986) presents a general method for translating equations of the second degree into Church's RRA, illustrating his method using the formulae '''E1''', '''E2''', and '''E4''' in chapter 11 of ''LoF''. This translation into RRA sheds light on the names Spencer-Brown gave to '''E1''' and '''E4''', namely \"memory\" and \"counter\". RRA thus formalizes and clarifies ''LoF'' 's notion of an imaginary truth value.\n\n==Related work==\n[[Gottfried Leibniz]], in memoranda not published before the late 19th and early 20th centuries, invented [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]]. His notation was isomorphic to that of ''LoF'': concatenation read as [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], and \"non-(''X'')\" read as the [[Logical complement|complement]] of ''X''. Leibniz's pioneering role in [[algebraic logic]] was foreshadowed by [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]] (1918) and [[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher]] (1954). But a full appreciation of Leibniz's accomplishments had to await the work of Wolfgang Lenzen, published in the 1980s and reviewed in [https://www.worldcat.org/title/calculus-universalis-studien-zur-logik-von-gw-leibniz/oclc/55653339 Lenzen (2004).]\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) anticipated the ''primary algebra'' in three veins of work:\n#Two papers he wrote in 1886 proposed a logical algebra employing but one symbol, the ''streamer'', nearly identical to the Cross of ''LoF''.  The semantics of the streamer are identical to those of the Cross, except that Peirce never wrote a streamer with nothing under it.

Peirce's [[semiotics]], about which ''LoF'' is silent, may yet shed light on the philosophical aspects of ''LoF''.\n\n[http://www2.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/CHK.pdf Kauffman  (2001)] discusses another notation similar to that of ''LoF'', that of a 1917 article by [[Jean Nicod]], who was a disciple of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s.\n\nThe above formalisms are, like the ''primary algebra'', all instances of ''boundary mathematics'', i.e., mathematics whose syntax is limited to letters and brackets (enclosing devices). A minimalist syntax of this nature is a \"boundary notation.\" Boundary notation is free of [[infix]], [[Polish notation|prefix]], or [[Reverse Polish notation|postfix]] operator symbols. The very well known curly braces ('{', '}') of set theory can be seen as a boundary notation.\n\nThe work of Leibniz, Peirce, and Nicod is innocent of metatheory, as they wrote before [[Emil Post]]'s landmark 1920 paper (which ''LoF'' cites), proving that [[sentential logic]] is complete, and before [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] showed how to prove [[axiom independence]] using [[model theory|model]]s.\n\n[[William Craig (logician)|Craig]] (1979) argued that the world, and how humans perceive and interact with that world, has a rich Boolean structure. Craig was an orthodox logician and an authority on [[algebraic logic]].\n\nSecond-generation [[cognitive science]] emerged in the 1970s, after ''LoF'' was written. On cognitive science and its relevance to Boolean algebra, logic, and [[set theory]], see Lakoff (1987) (see index entries under \"Image schema examples: container\") and Lakoff and Núñez (2001). Neither book cites ''LoF''.\n\nThe biologists and cognitive scientists [[Humberto Maturana]] and his student [[Francisco Varela]] both discuss ''LoF'' in their writings, which identify \"distinction\" as the fundamental cognitive act. The Berkeley psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Eleanor Rosch]] has written extensively on the closely related notion of categorization.\n\nOther formal systems with possible affinities to the primary algebra include:\n*[[Mereology]] which typically has a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] structure very similar to that of Boolean algebra. For a few authors, mereology is simply a [[model theory|model]] of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] and hence of the primary algebra as well.\n*[[Mereotopology]], which is inherently richer than Boolean algebra;\n*The system of  Whitehead (1934), whose fundamental primitive is \"indication.\"\n\nThe primary arithmetic and algebra are a minimalist formalism for [[sentential logic]] and Boolean algebra. Other minimalist formalisms having the power of [[set theory]] include:\n* The [[lambda calculus]];\n* [[Combinatory logic]] with two ('''S''' and '''K''') or even one ('''X''') primitive combinators;\n* [[Mathematical logic]] done with merely three primitive notions: one connective, [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] (whose ''primary algebra'' translation is (''AB'') or, dually, (''A'')(''B'')), universal [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], and one [[binary relation|binary]] [[atomic formula]], denoting [[Set (mathematics)|set]] membership. This is the system of [[Willard Quine|Quine]] (1951).\n* The ''beta'' [[existential graph]]s, with a single [[binary predicate]] denoting set membership. This has yet to be explored. The ''alpha'' graphs mentioned above are a special case of the ''beta'' graphs.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:simple:Boolean algebra|Boolean algebra]] (Simple English Wikipedia)\n*[[Boolean algebra (introduction)]]\n*[[Boolean algebra (logic)]]\n*[[Boolean algebra (structure)]]\n*[[Boolean algebras canonically defined]]\n*[[Boolean logic]]\n*[[Entitative graph]]\n*[[Existential graph]]\n*[[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n*[[Propositional calculus]]\n*[[Two-element Boolean algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Editions of ''Laws of Form'':\n**1969.

One may define a graph from a median algebra by creating a vertex for each algebra element and an edge for each pair <math>(x, z)</math> such that the interval <math>[x, z]</math> contains no other elements.

The English translation of 1949–1950 had the title '''''Modern algebra''''', though a later, extensively revised edition in 1970 had the title '''''Algebra'''''.\n\nThe book was one of the first [[textbook]]s to use an abstract axiomatic approach to [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, and was by far the most successful, becoming the standard reference for [[graduate school|graduate]] algebra for several decades.

In addition the new editions of first and second volumes were issued almost independently and at different times, and the numbering of the English editions does not correspond to the numbering of the German editions. In 1955 the title was changed from \"Moderne Algebra\" to \"Algebra\" following a suggestion of Brandt, with the result that the two volumes of the third German edition do not even have the same title.\n\nFor volume 1, the first German edition was published in 1930, the second in 1937 (with the axiom of choice removed), the third in 1951 (with the [[axiom of choice]] reinstated, and with more on [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]s).<ref>{{Citation | last1=Zelinsky | first1=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Zelinsky | title=Book Review: Moderne Algebra | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1951-09496-3 | year=1951 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages=206–207}}</ref> The fourth edition appeared in 1955 (with the title changed to ''Algebra''), the fifth in 1960, the sixth in 1964, the seventh in 1966, the eighth in 1971, the ninth in 1993.

      "text": "{{Short description|Additve map compatible with the underlying ring}}In algebra, a '''module homomorphism''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between [[module (mathematics)|module]]s that preserves the module structures. Explicitly, if ''M'' and ''N'' are left modules over a ring ''R'', then a function <math>f: M \\to N</math> is called a module homomorphism or an ''R''-linear map if for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' and ''r'' in ''R'',\n\n:<math>f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y),</math>\n:<math>f(rx) = rf(x).</math>\nIf ''M'', ''N'' are right ''R''-modules, then the second condition is replaced with\n:<math>f(xr) = f(x)r.</math>\n\nThe pre-image of the zero element under ''f'' is called the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''f''. The set of all module homomorphisms from ''M'' to ''N'' is denoted by Hom<sub>''R''</sub>(''M'', ''N''). It is an abelian group (under pointwise addition) but is not necessarily a module unless ''R'' is commutative.\n\nThe composition of module homomorphisms is again a module homomorphism. Thus, all the (say left) modules together with all the module homomorphisms between them form the [[category of modules]].\n\n== Terminology ==\nA module homomorphism is called an [[isomorphism]] if it admits an inverse homomorphism; in particular, it is a [[bijection]]. One can show a bijective module homomorphism is an isomorphism; i.e., the inverse is a module homomorphism. In particular, a module homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is an isomorphism between the underlying abelian groups.\n\nThe [[isomorphism theorem]]s hold for module homomorphisms.\n\nA module homomorphism from a module ''M'' to itself is called an [[endomorphism]] and an isomorphism from ''M'' to itself an [[automorphism]]. One writes <math>\\operatorname{End}_R(M) = \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, M)</math> for the set of all endomorphisms between a module ''M''. It is not only an abelian group but is also a ring with multiplication given by [[function composition]], called the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''M''. The [[group of units]] of this ring is the [[automorphism group]] of ''M''. \n\n[[Schur's lemma]] says that a homomorphism between [[simple module]]s (a module having only two submodules) must be either zero or an isomorphism. In particular, the endomorphism ring of a simple module is a [[division ring]].\n\nIn the language of the [[category theory]], an injective homomorphism is also called a [[monomorphism]] and a surjective homomorphism an [[epimorphism]].\n\n== Examples ==\n*The [[zero map]] ''M'' → ''N'' that maps every element to zero.\n*A [[linear transformation]] between vector spaces.\n*<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(\\mathbb{Z}/n, \\mathbb{Z}/m) = \\mathbb{Z}/\\operatorname{gcd}(n,m)</math>.\n*For a commutative ring ''R'' and ideals ''I'', ''J'', there is the canonical identification\n*:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(R/I, R/J) = \\{ r \\in R | r I \\subset J \\}/J</math>\n:given by <math>f \\mapsto f(1)</math>. In particular, <math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(R/I, R)</math> is the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of ''I''.\n*Given a ring ''R'' and an element ''r'', let <math>l_r: R \\to R</math> denote the left multiplication by ''r''. Then for any ''s'', ''t'' in ''R'',\n*:<math>l_r(st) = rst = l_r(s)t</math>.\n:That is, <math>l_r</math> is ''right'' ''R''-linear.\n*For any ring ''R'',\n**<math>\\operatorname{End}_R(R) = R</math> as rings when ''R'' is viewed as a right module over itself. Explicitly, this isomorphism is given by the [[left regular representation]] <math>R \\overset{\\sim}\\to \\operatorname{End}_R(R), \\, r \\mapsto l_r</math>.\n**<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(R, M) = M</math> through <math>f \\mapsto f(1)</math> for any left module ''M''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|loc=§ 1.14}}</ref> (The module structure on Hom here comes from the right ''R''-action on ''R''; see [[#Module structures on Hom]] below.)\n**<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, R)</math> is called the [[dual module]] of ''M''; it is a left (resp. right) module if ''M'' is a right (resp. left) module over ''R'' with the module structure coming from the ''R''-action on ''R''. It is denoted by <math>M^*</math>.\n*Given a ring homomorphism ''R'' → ''S'' of commutative rings and an ''S''-module ''M'', an ''R''-linear map θ: ''S'' → ''M'' is called a [[derivation (algebra)|derivation]] if for any ''f'', ''g'' in ''S'', {{nowrap|θ(''f g'') <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''f'' θ(''g'') + θ(''f'') ''g''}}.\n*If ''S'', ''T'' are unital [[associative algebra]]s over a ring ''R'', then an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''S'' to ''T'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] that is also an ''R''-module homomorphism.\n\n== Module structures on Hom ==\nIn short, Hom inherits a ring action that was not ''used up'' to form Hom. More precise, let ''M'', ''N'' be left ''R''-modules. Suppose ''M'' has a right action of a ring ''S'' that commutes with the ''R''-action; i.e., ''M'' is an (''R'', ''S'')-module. Then\n:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, N)</math>\nhas the structure of a left ''S''-module defined by: for ''s'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''M'',\n:<math>(s \\cdot f)(x) = f(xs).</math>\nIt is well-defined (i.e., <math>s \\cdot f</math> is ''R''-linear) since\n:<math>(s \\cdot f)(rx) = f(rxs) = rf(xs) = r (s \\cdot f)(x).</math>\nSimilarly, <math>s \\cdot f</math> is a ring action since\n:<math>(st \\cdot f)(x) = f(xst) = (t \\cdot f)(xs) = s \\cdot (t \\cdot f)(x)</math>.\n\nNote: the above verification would \"fail\" if one used the left ''R''-action in place of the right ''S''-action. In this sense, Hom is often said to \"use up\" the ''R''-action.\n\nSimilarly, if ''M'' is a left ''R''-module and ''N'' is an (''R'', ''S'')-module, then <math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M, N)</math> is a right ''S''-module by <math>(f \\cdot s)(x) = f(x)s</math>.\n\n== A matrix representation ==\nThe relationship between matrices and linear transformations in [[linear algebra]] generalizes in a natural way to module homomorphisms. Precisely, given a right ''R''-module ''U'', there is the [[canonical isomorphism]] of the abelian groups\n:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_R(U^{\\oplus n}, U^{\\oplus m}) \\overset{f \\mapsto [f_{ij}]}\\underset{\\sim}\\to M_{m, n}(\\operatorname{End}_R(U))</math>\nobtained by viewing <math>U^{\\oplus n}</math> consisting of column vectors and then writing ''f'' as an ''m'' × ''n'' matrix. In particular, viewing ''R'' as a right ''R''-module and using <math>\\operatorname{End}_R(R) \\simeq R</math>, one has\n:<math>\\operatorname{End}_R(R^n) \\simeq M_n(R)</math>,\nwhich turns out to be a ring isomorphism (as a composition corresponds to a [[matrix multiplication]]).\n\nNote the above isomorphism is canonical; no choice is involved. On the other hand, if one is given a module homomorphism between finite-rank [[free module]]s, then a choice of an ordered basis corresponds to a choice of an isomorphism <math>F \\simeq R^n</math>. The above procedure then gives the matrix representation with respect to such choices of the bases. For more general modules, matrix representations may either lack uniqueness or not exist.\n\n== Defining ==\nIn practice, one often defines a module homomorphism by specifying its values on a [[generating set of a module|generating set]]. More precisely, let ''M'' and ''N'' be left ''R''-modules. Suppose a subset ''S'' generates ''M''; i.e., there is a surjection <math>F \\to M</math> with a free module ''F'' with a basis indexed by ''S'' and kernel ''K'' (i.e., one has a [[free presentation]]). Then to give a module homomorphism <math>M \\to N</math> is to give a module homomorphism <math>F \\to N</math> that kills ''K'' (i.e., maps ''K'' to zero).\n\n== Operations ==\nIf <math>f: M \\to N</math> and <math>g: M' \\to N'</math> are module homomorphisms, then their direct sum is\n:<math>f \\oplus g: M \\oplus M' \\to N \\oplus N', \\, (x, y) \\mapsto (f(x), g(y))</math>\nand their tensor product is\n:<math>f \\otimes g: M \\otimes M' \\to N \\otimes N', \\, x \\otimes y \\mapsto f(x) \\otimes g(y).</math>\n\nLet <math>f: M \\to N</math> be a module homomorphism between left modules. The [[graph of a function|graph]] Γ<sub>''f''</sub> of ''f'' is the submodule of ''M'' ⊕ ''N'' given by\n:<math>\\Gamma_f = \\{ (x, f(x)) | x \\in M \\}</math>,\nwhich is the image of the module homomorphism {{nowrap|''M'' → ''M'' ⊕ ''N'', ''x'' → (''x'', ''f''(''x'')).<!-- how to write mapsto in html? -->}}\n\nThe [[transpose]] of ''f'' is\n:<math>f^*: N^* \\to M^*, \\, f^*(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\circ f.</math>\nIf ''f'' is an isomorphism, then the transpose of the inverse of ''f'' is called the '''contragredient''' of ''f''.\n\n== Exact sequences ==\n{{main|exact sequences}}\n\nA short sequence of modules \n:<math>0 \\to A \\overset{f}\\to B \\overset{g}\\to C \\to 0</math>\nconsists of modules {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C''}}, and homomorphisms {{math|''f'', ''g''}}. It is exact if the image of any arrow is the kernel of the next one; that is, {{math|''f''}} is injective, the kernel of {{math|''g''}} is the image of {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} is surjective. A longer exact sequence is defined in a similar way. A sequence of modules is exact if and only if it is exact as a sequence of abelian groups. \n\nAny module homomorphism {{math|''f''}} defines an exact sequence\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to M \\overset{f}\\to N \\to C \\to 0,</math>\nwhere {{math|''K''}} is the kernel of {{math|''f''}}, and {{math|''C''}} is the cokernel, that is the quotient of {{math|''N''}} by the image of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nIn the case of modules over a [[commutative ring]], a sequence is exact if and only if it is exact at all the [[maximal ideal]]s; that is all sequences \n:<math>0 \\to A_{\\mathfrak{m}} \\overset{f}\\to B_{\\mathfrak{m}} \\overset{g}\\to C_{\\mathfrak{m}} \\to 0</math>\nare exact, where the subscript <math>{\\mathfrak{m}}</math> means the [[localization of a module|localization]] at a maximal ideal <math>{\\mathfrak{m}}</math>.\n\nIf <math>f : M \\to B, g: N \\to B</math> are module homomorphisms, then they are said to form a '''fiber square''' (or '''[[pullback square]]'''), denoted by ''M'' ×<sub>''B''</sub> ''N'', if it fits into\n:<math>0 \\to M \\times_{B} N \\to M \\times N \\overset{\\phi}\\to B \\to 0</math>\nwhere <math>\\phi(x, y) = f(x) - g(x)</math>.\n\nExample: Let <math>B \\subset A</math> be commutative rings, and let ''I'' be the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of the quotient ''B''-module ''A''/''B'' (which is an ideal of ''A''). Then canonical maps <math>A \\to A/I, B/I \\to A/I</math> form a fiber square with <math>B = A \\times_{A/I} B/I.</math>\n\n== Endomorphisms of finitely generated modules ==\nLet <math>\\phi: M \\to M</math> be an endomorphism between finitely generated ''R''-modules for a commutative ring ''R''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''monomial''' is, roughly speaking, a [[polynomial]] which has only one term. Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:\n*(1): A monomial, also called '''power product''', is a product of powers of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] with [[nonnegative integer]] exponents, or, in other words, a product of variables, possibly with repetitions. The constant 1 is a monomial, being equal to the [[empty product]] and {{mvar|x}}<sup>0</sup> for any variable {{mvar|x}}. If only a single variable {{mvar|x}} is considered, this means that a monomial is either 1 or a power {{math|''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}} of {{mvar|x}}, with {{mvar|n}} a positive integer. If several variables are considered, say, <math>x, y, z,</math> then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form <math>x^a y^b z^c</math> with <math>a,b,c</math> non-negative integers (taking note that any exponent 0 makes the corresponding factor equal to 1).\n*(2): A monomial is a monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant, called the [[coefficient]] of the monomial. A monomial in the first sense is a special case of a monomial in the second sense, where the coefficient is 1. For example, in this interpretation <math>-7x^5</math> and <math>(3-4i)x^4yz^{13}</math> are monomials (in the second example, the variables are <math>x, y, z,</math> and the coefficient is a [[complex number]]).\n\nIn the context of [[Laurent polynomial]]s and [[Laurent series]], the exponents of a monomial may be negative, and in the context of [[Puiseux series]], the exponents may be [[rational number]]s.\n\nSince the word \"monomial\", as well as the word \"polynomial\", comes from the late Latin word \"binomium\" (binomial), by changing the prefix \"bi\" (two in Latin), a monomial should theoretically be called a \"mononomial\". \"Monomial\" is a [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] by [[haplology]] of \"mononomial\".<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 1969.</ref>\n\n== Comparison of the two definitions ==\nWith either definition, the set of monomials is a subset of all polynomials that is closed under multiplication.\n\nBoth uses of this notion can be found, and in many cases the distinction is simply ignored, see for instance examples for the first<ref>{{cite book | last = Cox | first = David | authorlink = |author2=John Little |author3=Donal O'Shea  | title = Using Algebraic Geometry | publisher = Springer Verlag | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 1 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-387-98487-9 }}</ref> and second<ref>{{Springer|id=M/m064760|title=Monomial}}</ref> meaning. In informal discussions the distinction is seldom important, and tendency is towards the broader second meaning. When studying the structure of polynomials however, one often definitely needs a notion with the first meaning. This is for instance the case when considering a [[monomial basis]] of a [[polynomial ring]], or a [[monomial order]]ing of that basis. An argument in favor of the first meaning is also that no obvious other notion is available to designate these values (the term power product is in use, in particular when ''monomial'' is used with the first meaning, but it does not make the absence of constants clear either), while the notion term of a polynomial unambiguously coincides with the second meaning of monomial. \n\n''The remainder of this article assumes the first meaning of \"monomial\".''\n\n==Monomial basis==\n{{main|Monomial basis}}\nThe most obvious fact about monomials (first meaning) is that any polynomial is a [[linear combination]] of them, so they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the [[vector space]] of all polynomials, called the ''monomial basis'' - a fact of constant implicit use in mathematics.\n\n==Number==\nThe number of monomials of degree ''d'' in ''n'' variables is the number of [[multicombination]]s of ''d'' elements chosen among the ''n'' variables (a variable can be chosen more than once, but order does not matter), which is given by the [[multiset coefficient]] <math>\\textstyle{\\left(\\!\\!{n\\choose d}\\!\\!\\right)}</math>. This expression can also be given in the form of a [[binomial coefficient]], as a [[polynomial expression]] in ''d'', or using a [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] of {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}:\n:<math>\\left(\\!\\!{n\\choose d}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+d-1}{d} = \\binom{d+(n-1)}{n-1}\n  = \\frac{(d+1)\\times(d+2)\\times\\cdots\\times(d+n-1)}{1\\times2\\times\\cdots\\times(n-1)} = \\frac{1}{(n-1)!}(d+1)^{\\overline{n-1}}.</math>\nThe latter forms are particularly useful when one fixes the number of variables and lets the degree vary. From these expressions one sees that for fixed ''n'', the number of monomials of degree ''d'' is a polynomial expression in ''d'' of degree <math>n-1</math> with leading coefficient <math>\\tfrac1{(n-1)!}</math>.\n\nFor example, the number of monomials in three variables (<math>n=3</math>) of degree ''d'' is <math>\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)^{\\overline2} = \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)(d+2)</math>; these numbers form the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... of [[triangular number]]s.\n\nThe [[Hilbert series]] is a compact way to express the number of monomials of a given degree: the number of monomials of degree {{mvar|d}} in {{mvar|n}} variables is the coefficient of degree {{mvar|d}} of the [[formal power series]] expansion of\n:<math> \\frac{1}{(1-t)^n}.</math>\n\nThe number of monomials of degree at most {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''}} variables is <math>\\binom{n+d}{n} = \\binom{n+d}{d}.</math> This follows from the one-to-one correspondence between the monomials of degree {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''+1}} variables and the monomials of degree at most {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''}} variables, which consists in substituting by 1 the extra variable.\n\n==Notation==\n\nNotation for monomials is constantly required in fields like [[partial differential equation]]s. If the variables being used form an indexed family like <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, <math>x_3</math>, ..., then ''[[multi-index notation]]'' is helpful: if we write \n\n:<math>\\alpha = (a, b, c)</math>\n\nwe can define \n:<math>x^{\\alpha} = x_1^a\\, x_2^b\\, x_3^c</math>\n\nand save a great deal of space.\n\n==Degree<!-- [[Degree of a monomial]] redirects here -->==\n\nThe degree of a monomial is defined as the sum of all the exponents of the variables, including the implicit exponents of 1 for the variables which appear without exponent; e.g., in the example of the previous section, the degree is <math>a+b+c</math>. The degree of <math>x y z^2</math> is 1+1+2=4. The degree of a nonzero constant is 0. For example, the degree of -7 is 0. \n\nThe degree of a monomial is sometimes called order, mainly in the context of series. It is also called total degree when it is needed to distinguish it from the degree in one of the variables.\n\nMonomial degree is fundamental to the theory of univariate and multivariate polynomials. Explicitly, it is used to define the [[degree of a polynomial]] and the notion of [[homogeneous polynomial]], as well as for graded [[monomial ordering]]s used in formulating and computing [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]]. Implicitly, it is used in grouping the terms of a [[Taylor series#Taylor series in several variables|Taylor series in several variables]].\n\n==Geometry==\n\nIn [[algebraic geometry]] the varieties defined by monomial equations <math>x^{\\alpha} = 0</math> for some set of α have special properties of homogeneity. This can be phrased in the language of [[algebraic group]]s, in terms of the existence of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of an [[algebraic torus]] (equivalently by a multiplicative group of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]]). This area is studied under the name of ''[[Toric geometry|torus embedding]]s''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Monomial representation]]\n* [[Generalized permutation matrix|Monomial matrix]]\n* [[Homogeneous polynomial]]\n* [[Homogeneous function]]\n* [[Multilinear form]]\n* [[Log-log plot]]\n* [[Power law]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{polynomials}}\n\n[[Category:Homogeneous polynomials]]\n[[Category:Algebra]]"

Hence, <math>f</math> will be a sum of multiples of monomial terms for at least one of the <math>m_i</math>.\n\nConversely, let <math>I = (m_1, m_2, \\dotsc, m_k)</math> and let each monomial term in <math>f \\in \\mathbb{K} [x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n]</math> be a multiple of one of the <math>m_i</math> in <math>I</math>. Then each monomial term in <math> I </math> can be factored from each monomial in <math>f</math>.

Suppose <math>I \\in \\mathbb{R}[x, y]</math>, then <math>I</math> can be interpreted in terms of the minimal monomials generators as <math>I = (x^{a_1}y^{b_1}, x^{a_2}y^{b_2},\\dotsc, x^{a_k}y^{b_k})</math>, where <math>a_1 > a_2 > \\dotsm > a_k \\geq 0</math> and <math>b_r > \\dotsm > b_2 > b_1 \\geq 0</math>. The minimal monomial generators of <math>I</math> can be seen as the inner corners of the Young diagram. The minimal generators would determine where we would draw the staircase diagram.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|Sturmfels|2005}}</ref>\nThe monomials not in <math>I</math> lie inside the staircase, and these monomials form a vector space basis for the [[quotient ring]] <math>\\mathbb{R}[x, y]/I</math>.\n\nConsider the following example. \nLet <math>I = (x^3, x^2y, y^3) \\subset \\mathbb{R}[x, y]</math> be a monomial ideal. Then the set of grid points <math>S = {\\{(3, 0), (2, 1),(0, 3)}\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}^2</math> corresponds to the minimal monomial generators <math>x^3y^0, x^2y^1, x^0y^3</math> in <math>I</math>. Then as the figure shows, the pink Young diagram consists of the monomials that are not in <math>I</math>. The points in the inner corners of the Young diagram, allow us to identify the minimal monomials <math>x^0y^3, x^2y^1, x^3y^0</math> in <math>I</math> as seen in the green boxes. Hence, <math>I = (y^3, x^2y, x^3)</math>.\n\n [[File:Wikipic.png|thumb|A Young diagram and its connection with its monomial ideal.]]\nIn general, to any set of grid points, we can associate a Young diagram, so that the monomial ideal is constructed by determining the inner corners that make up the staircase diagram; likewise, given a monomial ideal, we can make up the Young diagram by looking at the <math> (a_i, b_j) </math> and representing them as the inner corners of the Young diagram. The coordinates of the inner corners would represent the powers of the minimal monomials in <math> I </math>. Thus, monomial ideals can be described by Young diagrams of partitions.\n\nMoreover, the [[torus action|<math> (\\mathbb{C}^*)^2 </math>-action]] on the set of  <math> I \\subset \\mathbb{C}[x, y]</math> such that <math> \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathbb{C}[x, y]/I = n </math> as a [[vector space]] over <math> \\mathbb{C} </math> has fixed points corresponding to monomial ideals only, which correspond to [[Partition (number theory)|partitions]] of size ''n'', which are identified by Young diagrams with ''n'' boxes.\n\n==Monomial Ordering and Gröbner Basis==\nA '''monomial ordering''' is a well ordering <math>\\geq</math> on the set of monomials such that if <math>a, m_1, m_2</math> are monomials, then <math>am_1 \\geq am_2</math>.\n\nBy the [[monomial order]], we can state the following definitions for a polynomial in <math> \\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n] </math>. \n\n''Definition''<ref name=Dummit&Foote />\n\n# Consider an ideal <math> I \\subset \\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n] </math>, and a fixed monomial ordering. The '''leading term''' of a nonzero polynomial <math> f \\in \\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n] </math>, denoted by <math> LT(f) </math> is the monomial term of maximal order in <math> f </math> and the leading term of <math> f = 0 </math> is <math> 0 </math>.\n# The '''ideal of leading terms''', denoted by <math> LT(I) </math>, is the ideal generated by the leading terms of every element in the ideal, that is, <math> LT(I) = (LT(f) \\mid f\\in I) </math>.\n# A '''Gröbner basis''' for an ideal <math> I \\subset \\mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n] </math> is a finite set of generators <math> {\\{g_1, g_2, \\dotsc, g_s}\\} </math> for <math> I </math> whose leading terms generate the ideal of all the leading terms in <math> I </math>, i.e., <math> I = (g_1, g_2, \\dotsc, g_s) </math> and <math> LT(I) = (LT(g_1), LT(g_2), \\dotsc, LT(g_s)) </math>.\n\nNote that <math>LT(I)</math> in general depends of the ordering used; for example, if we choose the [[lexicographical order]] on <math>\\mathbb{R}[x, y]</math> subject to ''x'' > ''y'', then <math>LT(2x^3y + 9xy^5 + 19) = 2x^3y</math>, but if we take ''y'' > ''x'' then <math>LT(2x^3y + 9xy^5 + 19) = 9xy^5</math>.\n\nIn addition, monomials are present on [[Gröbner basis]] and to define the division algorithm for polynomials with several variables. \n\nNotice that for a monomial ideal <math>I = (g_1, g_2, \\dotsc, g_s) \\in \\mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n]</math>, the finite set of generators <math>{\\{g_1, g_2, \\dotsc, g_s}\\}</math> is a Gröbner basis for <math>I</math>. To see this, note that any polynomial <math>f \\in I</math> can be expressed as <math>f = a_1g_1 + a_2g_2 + \\dotsm + a_sg_s</math> for <math>a_i \\in \\mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n]</math>. Then the leading term of <math>f</math> is a multiple for some <math>g_i</math>. As a result, <math>LT(I)</math> is generated by the <math>g_i</math> likewise.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Stanley–Reisner ring]]\n*[[Hodge algebra]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first1= Ezra|last1= Miller|first2= Bernd|last2= Sturmfels|title=Combinatorial Commutative Algebra|series=  [[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]]|volume =227|publisher= [[Springer-Verlag]]|place=[[New York City|New York]]|year= 2005|isbn=0-387-22356-8}}\n* {{citation|first1= David S.|last1= Dummit|first2= Richard M.|last2= Foote|title=Abstract Algebra|edition= third|place= [[New York City|New York]]|year= 2004|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-43334-7}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web|first=David|last= Cox|authorlink=David A.

The equation <math>a^2=b^2c+d^2</math> shows that {{math|''{{abs|a}}'' > ''{{abs|b}}''{{sqrt|''c''}}}}. Thus, if the nested radical is real, and denesting is possible, then {{math|''a'' > 0}}.

In the case of three real roots, the square root expression is an imaginary number; here any real root is expressed by defining the first cube root to be any specific complex cube root of the complex radicand, and by defining the second cube root to be the [[complex conjugate]] of the first one. The nested radicals in this solution cannot in general be simplified unless the cubic equation has at least one [[rational number|rational]] solution. Indeed, if the cubic has three irrational but real solutions, we have the ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'', in which all three real solutions are written in terms of cube roots of complex numbers. On the other hand, consider the equation\n\n:<math>x^3-7x+6=0,</math>\n\nwhich has the rational solutions 1, 2, and&nbsp;−3. The general solution formula given above gives the solutions\n\n:<math>x=\\sqrt[3]{-3+\\frac{10\\sqrt{3}i}{9}} + \\sqrt[3]{-3-\\frac{10\\sqrt{3}i}{9}} .</math>\n\nFor any given choice of cube root and its conjugate, this contains nested radicals involving complex numbers, yet it is reducible (even though not obviously so) to one of the solutions 1, 2, or –3.\n\n== Infinitely nested radicals ==\n\n=== Square roots ===\n\nUnder certain conditions infinitely nested square roots such as\n\n:<math> x = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\cdots}}}} </math>\n\nrepresent rational numbers.

(The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)\n\nAn operand, then, is also referred to as \"one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation\".\n\n==Notation==\n\n===Expressions as operands===\nOperands may be complex, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.\n\n:<math>(3 + 5) \\times 2</math>\n\nIn the above expression '(3&nbsp;+&nbsp;5)' is the first operand for the multiplication operator and '2' the second. The operand '(3&nbsp;+&nbsp;5)' is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands '3' and '5'.\n\n===Order of operations===\n{{See also|Order of operations}}\nRules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|accessdate=5 August 2012|at=Section IV&ndash;E&ndash;2&ndash;e}}</ref>\n\n:<math>3 + 5 \\times 2</math>\n\nIn the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has operands of '3' and '5&nbsp;×&nbsp;2'.\n\n===Positioning of operands===\nDepending on the [[mathematical notation]] being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage [[infix notation]] is the most common,<ref name=\"Infix, Postfix and Prefix\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs212/fix.html | title=The Implementation and Power of Programming Languages | accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref> however other notations also exist, such as the [[prefix notation|prefix]] and [[postfix notation|postfix]] notations. These alternate notations are most common within [[computer science]].\n\nBelow is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers '1' and '2'\n\n:<math>1 + 2</math> (infix notation)\n\n:<math>+\\;1\\;2</math> (prefix notation)\n\n:<math>1\\;2\\;+</math> (postfix notation)\n\n===Infix notation and the order of operation===\n{{main|Order of operations}}\n\nIn a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the leftmost value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression\n\n:<math>4 \\times 2^2 - (2 + 2^2)</math>,\n\nthe first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 2<sup>2</sup>. The reader is required to find the value of 2<sup>2</sup> before going any further. The value of 2<sup>2</sup> is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:\n\n:<math>4 \\times 2^2 - (2 + 4)</math>\n\nThe next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;6. Our expression now looks like this:\n\n:<math>4 \\times 2^2 - 6</math>\n\nHaving calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 2<sup>2</sup>.  We find the value of 2<sup>2</sup>, which is 4. What we have left is the expression\n\n:<math>4 \\times 4 - 6</math>.\n\nThe next order of operation is multiplication. 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:\n\n:<math>16 - 6</math>\n\nThe next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16&nbsp;−&nbsp;6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.\n\n:<math>16 - 6 = 10</math>. \n\nSo the correct value for our original expression, 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;(2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>), is 10. \n\nIt is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.\n\n===Arity===\nThe number of operands of an operator is called its [[arity]].<ref name=\"Hazewinkel2001\">{{cite book|author=[[Michiel Hazewinkel]]|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47YC2h295JUC&pg=PA3|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0198-7|page=3}}: \"Each connective has associated with it a natural number, called its ''rank'', or ''arity''.\"</ref> Based on arity, operators are classified as nullary (no operands), [[unary operation|unary]] (1 operand), [[binary operation|binary]] (2 operands), [[ternary operation|ternary]] (3 operands), etc.\n\n==Computer science==\nIn computer [[programming language]]s, the definitions of [[operator (programming)|operator]] and '''operand''' are almost the same as in mathematics.\n\nIn computing, an '''operand''' is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.<ref>{{cite book\n  |author =Nell Dale and John Lewis\n  |title = Computer Science Illuminated, 5th Edition\n  |year = 2012\n  |publisher = Jones and Bartlett\n  |ISBN =978-1449672843\n}}</ref>\nA computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.\n\nAdditionally, in [[assembly language]], an '''operand''' is a value (an argument) on which the [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]], named by [[mnemonic]], operates.

The number of operands is the [[arity]] of the operation. The most commonly studied operations are [[binary operation]]s, (that is, operations of arity&nbsp;2) such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], and [[unary operation]]s (operations of arity&nbsp;1), such as [[additive inverse]] and [[multiplicative inverse]]. An operation of arity zero, or [[nullary operation]], is a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. The [[mixed product]] is an example of an operation of arity&nbsp;3, also called [[ternary operation]]. Generally, the arity is supposed to be finite. However, [[infinitary operation]]s are sometimes considered, in which context the \"usual\" operations of finite arity are called '''finitary operations'''.\n\n==Types of operation==\n[[File:Binary operations as black box.svg|thumb|A binary operation takes two arguments <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> and returns the result <math>x\\circ y</math>]]\nThere are two common types of operations: [[unary operation|unary]] and [[binary operation|binary]]. Unary operations involve only one value, such as [[negation]] and [[trigonometric function]]s. Binary operations, on the other hand, take two values, and include [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], and [[exponentiation]].\n\nOperations can involve mathematical objects other than numbers. The [[Truth value|logical values]] ''true'' and ''false'' can be combined using [[logic operation]]s, such as ''and'', ''or,'' and ''not''. [[vector (geometric)|Vectors]] can be added and subtracted. [[Rotation]]s can be combined using the [[function composition]] operation, performing the first rotation and then the second. Operations on [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] include the binary operations ''[[union (mathematics)|union]]'' and ''[[intersection (mathematics)|intersection]]'' and the unary operation of ''[[complementation (mathematics)|complementation]]''. Operations on [[function (mathematics)|function]]s include [[Function composition|composition]] and [[convolution]].\n\nOperations may not be defined for every possible value. For example, in the real numbers one cannot divide by zero or take square roots of negative numbers. The values for which an operation is defined form a set called its ''[[domain (mathematics)|domain]]''. The set which contains the values produced is called the ''[[codomain]]'', but the set of actual values attained by the operation is its ''[[range (mathematics)|range]]''. For example, in the real numbers, the squaring operation only produces non-negative numbers; the codomain is the set of real numbers, but the range is the non-negative numbers.\n\nOperations can involve dissimilar objects. A vector can be multiplied by a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] to form another vector. And the [[inner product]] operation on two vectors produces a scalar. An operation may or may not have certain properties, for example it may be [[associative]], [[commutative]], [[anticommutative]], [[idempotent]], and so on.\n\nThe values combined are called ''operands'', ''arguments'', or ''inputs'', and the value produced is called the ''value'', ''result'', or ''output''. Operations can have fewer or more than two inputs.\n\nAn operation is like an '''operator''', but the point of view is different. For instance, one often speaks of \"the operation of addition\" or \"addition operation\" when focusing on the operands and result, but one says \"addition operator\" (rarely \"operator of addition\") when focusing on the process, or from the more abstract viewpoint, the function {{nowrap|+ : ''S'' × ''S'' → ''S''}}.\n\n==Definition==\nAn '''operation''' ω is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form {{nowrap|ω : ''V'' → ''Y''}}, where {{nowrap|''V'' ⊂ ''X''<sub>1</sub> × ... × ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The sets ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> are called the ''domains'' of the operation, the set ''Y'' is called the ''codomain'' of the operation, and the fixed non-negative integer ''k'' (the number of arguments) is called the ''type'' or ''[[arity]]'' of the operation. Thus a [[unary operation]] has arity one, and a [[binary operation]] has arity two. An operation of arity zero, called a ''nullary'' operation, is simply an element of the codomain ''Y''. An operation of arity ''k'' is called a ''k''-ary operation. Thus a ''k''-ary operation is a (''k''+1)-ary [[finitary relation|relation]] that is functional on its first ''k'' domains.\n\nThe above describes what is usually called a ''finitary'' operation, referring to the finite number of arguments (the value ''k''). There are obvious extensions where the arity is taken to be an infinite [[ordinal number|ordinal]] or [[cardinal number|cardinal]], or even an arbitrary set indexing the arguments.\n\nOften, use of the term ''operation'' implies that the domain of the function is a power of the codomain (i.e. the [[Cartesian product]] of one or more copies of the codomain),<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter II, Definition 1.1|first=S.

The most common operators are [[linear map]]s, which act on [[vector space]]s.

A [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] ''A'': ''U'' → ''V'' is linear if\n:<math>A(\\alpha \\mathbf{x} + \\beta \\mathbf{y}) = \\alpha A \\mathbf{x} + \\beta A \\mathbf{y}</math>\nfor all '''x''', '''y''' in ''U'' and for all ''α, β'' in ''K''.  \nThis means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are [[morphism]]s between vector spaces.\n\nIn finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in the following way. Let <math>K</math> be a field, and <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> be finite-dimensional vector spaces over <math>K</math>. Let us select a basis <math>\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n</math> in <math>U</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_m</math> in <math>V</math>. Then let <math>\\mathbf{x} = x^i \\mathbf{u}_i</math> be an arbitrary vector in <math>U</math> (assuming [[Einstein convention]]), and <math>A: U \\to V</math> be a linear operator. Then\n: <math>A\\mathbf{x} = x^i A\\mathbf{u}_i = x^i (A\\mathbf{u}_i)^j \\mathbf{v}_j </math>.\nThen <math>a_i^j := (A\\mathbf{u}_i)^j \\in K</math> is the matrix of the operator <math>A</math> in fixed bases. <math>a_i^j</math> does not depend on the choice of <math>x</math>, and <math>A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}</math> if <math>a_i^j x^i = y^j</math>. Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from <math>U</math> to <math>V</math>.\n\nThe important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of [[Matrix rank|rank]], [[determinant]], [[inverse operator]], and [[eigenspace]].\n\nLinear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as [[functional analysis]] (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).\n\nThe space of [[sequence]]s of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as [[sequence space]]s. Operators on these spaces are known as [[sequence transformation]]s.\n\nBounded linear operators over [[Banach space]] form a [[Banach algebra]] in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectra]] that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.\n\n== Bounded operators==\n{{Main|bounded operator|operator norm|Banach algebra}}\n\nLet ''U'' and ''V'' be two vector spaces over the same [[ordered field]] (for example, <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>), and they are equipped with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s. Then a linear operator from ''U'' to ''V'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists ''C > 0'' such that\n:<math>||A\\mathbf{x}||_V \\leq C||\\mathbf{x}||_U</math>\nfor all '''x''' in ''U''.\n\nBounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of ''U'' and ''V'':\n:<math>||A|| = \\inf\\{C: ||A\\mathbf{x}||_V \\leq C||\\mathbf{x}||_U\\}</math>.\n\nIn case of operators from ''U'' to itself it can be shown that\n:<math>||AB|| \\leq ||A||\\cdot||B||</math>.\n\nAny unital [[normed algebra]] with this property is called a [[Banach algebra]]. It is possible to generalize [[spectral theory]] to such algebras. [[C*-algebra]]s, which are [[Banach algebras]] with some additional structure, play an important role in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Geometry ===\n{{Main|general linear group|isometry}}\n\nIn [[geometry]], additional structures on [[vector space]]s are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form [[group (mathematics)|group]]s by composition.\n\nFor example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the [[invertible]] [[linear operator]]s. They form the [[general linear group]] under composition. They ''do not'' form a vector space under the addition of operators, e.g. both ''id'' and ''-id'' are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.\n\nOperators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the [[isometry group]], and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the [[orthogonal group]]. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the [[special orthogonal group]], or the group of rotations.\n\n=== Probability theory ===\n{{Main|Probability theory}}\n\nOperators are also involved in probability theory, such as [[expected value|expectation]], [[variance]],  and [[covariance]]. Indeed, every covariance is basically a dot product; every variance is a dot product of a vector with itself, and thus is a quadratic norm; every standard deviation is a norm (square root of the quadratic norm); the corresponding cosine to this dot product is the [[Pearson correlation coefficient]]; expected value is basically an integral operator (used to measure weighted shapes in the space).\n\n=== Calculus ===\n{{Main|differential operator|integral operator}}\nFrom the point of view of [[functional analysis]], [[calculus]] is the study of two linear operators: the [[differential operator]] <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}</math>, and the [[Volterra operator]] <math>\\int_0^t</math>.\n\n==== Fourier series and Fourier transform ====\n\n{{Main|Fourier series|Fourier transform}}\n\nThe Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively [[invertible]]. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of [[periodic function]]s, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of [[sine wave]]s and cosine waves:\n:<math>f(t) = {a_0 \\over 2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{ a_n \\cos ( \\omega n t ) + b_n \\sin ( \\omega n t ) } </math>\nThe tuple ''(a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, ...)'' is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space [[Sequence space|ℓ<sup>2</sup>]], and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.\n\nWhen dealing with general function '''R''' → '''C''', the transform takes on an [[integral]] form:\n\n:<math>f(t) = {1 \\over \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{- \\infty}^{+ \\infty}{g( \\omega )e^{ i \\omega t } \\,d\\omega }. </math>\n\n==== Laplace transform ====\n\n{{Main|Laplace transform}}\nThe ''Laplace transform'' is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.\n\nGiven ''f'' = ''f''(''s''), it is defined by:\n:<math>F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) =\\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\,dt.</math>\n\n=== Fundamental operators on scalar and vector fields ===\n{{Main|vector calculus|vector field|scalar field|gradient|divergence|curl (mathematics)|l6=curl}}\n\nThree operators are key to [[vector calculus]]:\n* Grad ([[gradient]]), (with operator symbol [[Del|<math>\\nabla</math>]]) assigns a vector at every point in a scalar field that points in the direction of greatest rate of change of that field and whose norm measures the absolute value of that greatest rate of change.\n* Div ([[divergence]]), (with operator symbol [[Del#Divergence|<math>\\nabla \\cdot</math>]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's divergence from or convergence towards a given point.\n* [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]], (with operator symbol [[Del#Curl|<math>\\nabla \\times</math>]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's curling (winding around, rotating around) trend about a given point.\n\nAs an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, Grad, Div and Curl operators also are often associated with [[Tensor calculus]] as well as vector calculus.<ref name=\"Vector and Tensor Operators\">{{cite book |isbn= 0-393-92516-1 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Div-Grad-Curl-All-That/dp/0393925161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1388768941&sr=1-1&keywords=div+grad+curl |title=Div Grad Curl and All that |author=h.m. schey |location=New York|publisher=W W Norton|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Function (mathematics)|Function]]\n* [[Operator algebra]]\n* [[List of operators]]\n* [[Operator (physics)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]"

      "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[computer programming]], the '''order of operations''' (or '''operator precedence''') is a collection of rules that reflect conventions about which procedures to perform first in order to evaluate a given [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]].\n\nFor example, in mathematics and most computer languages, multiplication is granted a higher precedence than addition, and it has been this way since the introduction of modern algebraic notation.<ref name=\"Bronstein_1987\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52582.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date=22 November 2000 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref> Thus, the expression {{nowrap|2 + 3 × 4}} is interpreted to have the value {{nowrap|2 + (3 × 4) {{=}} 14}}, not {{nowrap|(2 + 3) × 4 {{=}} 20}}. With the introduction of exponents in the 16th and 17th centuries, they were given precedence over both addition and multiplication and could be placed only as a superscript to the right of their base.<ref name=\"Bronstein_1987\"/> Thus {{nowrap|3 + 5<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 28}} and {{nowrap|3 × 5<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 75}}.\n\nThese conventions exist to eliminate ambiguity while allowing notation to be as brief as possible. Where it is desired to override the precedence conventions, or even simply to emphasize them, parentheses ( ) (sometimes replaced by brackets [ ] or braces { } for readability) can indicate an alternate order or reinforce the default order to avoid confusion. For example, {{nowrap|(2 + 3) × 4 {{=}} 20}} forces addition to precede multiplication, and {{nowrap|(3 + 5)<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 64}} forces addition to precede exponentiation.\n\n==Definition==\nThe order of operations used throughout mathematics, science, technology and many computer [[programming language]]s is expressed here:<ref name=\"Bronstein_1987\" />\n# [[exponentiation]] and [[root extraction]]\n# [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]]\n# [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]\n\nThis means that if, in a [[mathematical expression]], a subexpression appears between two operators, the operator that is higher in the above list should be applied first.\n\nThe [[Commutative property|commutative]] and [[Associative property|associative]] laws of addition and multiplication allow adding terms in any order, and multiplying factors in any order—but mixed operations must obey the standard order of operations.\n\nIn some contexts, it is helpful to replace a division by multiplication by the reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) and a subtraction by addition of the opposite (additive inverse). For example, in [[computer algebra]], this allows manipulating fewer [[binary operation]]s and makes it easier to use [[commutativity]] and [[associativity]] when simplifying large [[expression (mathematics)| expressions]] – for more details, see {{slink|Computer algebra|Simplification}}.  Thus {{nowrap|3 ÷ 4 {{=}} 3 × {{sfrac|1|4}}}}; in other words, the quotient of 3 and 4 equals the product of 3 and {{sfrac|1|4}}. Also {{nowrap|3 − 4 {{=}} 3 + (−4)}}; in other words the difference of 3 and 4 equals the sum of 3 and −4. Thus, {{nowrap|1 − 3 + 7}} can be thought of as the sum of {{nowrap|1 + (−3) + 7}}, and the three [[summand]]s may be added in any order, in all cases giving 5 as the result. \n\nThe root symbol √ is traditionally prolongated by a bar (called [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]) over the radicand (this allows avoiding parentheses for eliminating the radicand). Other functions use parentheses around the input to avoid ambiguity. The parentheses are sometimes omitted if the input is a [[monomial]]. Thus, {{nowrap|sin 3''x'' {{=}} sin(3''x'')}}, but {{nowrap|sin ''x'' + ''y'' {{=}} sin(''x'') + ''y''}}, because {{nowrap|''x'' + ''y''}} is not a monomial.<ref name=\"Bronstein_1987\">{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Mathematik |author-first1=Ilja Nikolaevič<!-- Nikolajewitsch --> |author-last1=Bronstein<!-- 1903–1976 --> |author-first2=Konstantin Adolfovič<!-- Adolfowitsch --> |author-last2=Semendjajew<!-- 1908–1988 --> |editor-first1=Günter |editor-last1=Grosche |editor-first2=Viktor |editor-last2=Ziegler<!-- 1922–1980--> |editor-first3=Dorothea |editor-last3=Ziegler |others=Weiß, Jürgen<!-- lector --> |translator-first=Viktor |translator-last=Ziegler |volume=1 |date=1987 |edition=23 |orig-year=1945 |publisher=[[Verlag Harri Deutsch]] (and [[B.

In cases where there is the possibility that the notation might be misinterpreted, a binary minus operation can be enforced by explicitly specifying a leading 0 (as in <code>0-2^2</code> instead of just <code>-2^2</code>), or parentheses can be used to clarify the intended meaning.\n\n===Mixed division and multiplication===\nSimilarly, there can be ambiguity in the use of the [[Slash (punctuation)#Arithmetic|slash symbol]] / in expressions such as 1/2''x''.<ref name=\"Ball_1978\">{{cite book |title=Algorithms for RPN calculators |first=John A. |last=Ball |date=1978 |edition=1 |publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]], [[John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |isbn=0-471-03070-8 |page=31}}</ref> If one rewrites this expression as {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2''x''}} and then interprets the division symbol as indicating multiplication by the reciprocal, this becomes:\n: {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2 × ''x'' {{=}} 1 × {{sfrac|1|2}} × ''x'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}} × ''x''}}.\n\nWith this interpretation {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2''x''}} is equal to {{nowrap|(1 ÷ 2)''x''}}.<ref name=\"Bronstein_1987\"/><ref>\"division and multiplication have the same priority\", http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/mc-ty-rules-2009-1.pdf</ref> However, in some of the academic literature, [[multiplication denoted by juxtaposition]] (also known as [[implied multiplication]]) is interpreted as having higher precedence than division, so that {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2''x''}} equals {{nowrap|1 ÷ (2''x'')}}, not {{nowrap|(1 ÷ 2)''x''}}.\n\nFor example, the manuscript submission instructions for the ''[[Physical Review]]'' journals state that multiplication is of higher precedence than division with a slash,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |accessdate=5 August 2012 |at=Section IV&ndash;E&ndash;2&ndash;e}}</ref> and this is also the convention observed in prominent physics textbooks such as the ''[[Course of Theoretical Physics]]'' by [[Lev Landau|Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''.<ref group=lower-alpha>For example, the third edition of ''Mechanics'' by Landau and Lifshitz contains expressions such as ''hP''<sub>''z''</sub>/2{{pi}} (p. 22), and the first volume of the ''Feynman Lectures'' contains expressions such as 1/2{{sqrt|''N''}} [http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html (p. 6–7)].

Nigeria and some other West African countries also use BODMAS. Similarly in the UK, '''''BIDMAS''''' is used, standing for ''B''rackets, ''I''ndices, ''D''ivision/''M''ultiplication, ''A''ddition/''S''ubtraction.\n\nThese mnemonics may be misleading when written this way.<ref name=\"Ball_1978\" /> For example, misinterpreting any of the above rules to mean \"addition first, subtraction afterward\" would incorrectly evaluate the expression<ref name=\"Ball_1978\" />\n: {{nowrap|10 − 3 + 2}}.\n\nThe correct value is 9 (and not 5, as if the addition would be carried out first and the result used with the subtraction afterwards).\n\n==Special cases==\n===Serial exponentiation===\nIf exponentiation is indicated by stacked symbols using superscript notation, the usual rule is to work from the top down:<ref name=\"Bronstein_1987\"/><ref name=\"NIST_2010\">{{cite book |title=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions |title-link=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions |editor-first=Frank W.

Thus <code>4^3^2</code> is evaluated to 4,096 in the first case and to 262,144 in the second case.\n\n===Exponentiation and negation===\nAnother difference between computer systems is <code>-''a''^''b''</code>, which  in Microsoft Excel is evaluated as <code>(-''a'')^''b''</code>, in Google Search as <code>-(''a''^''b'')</code>. For compatibility, the Excel behavior is observed on [[LibreOffice]].\n\n===Serial division===\nA similar ambiguity exists in the case of serial division, for example, the expression {{nowrap| 10 ÷ 5 ÷ 2}} can either be interpreted as \n: {{nowrap| 10 ÷ ( 5 ÷ 2 ) {{=}} 4 }}\nor as\n: {{nowrap|( 10 ÷ 5 ) ÷ 2 {{=}} 1 }}\n\nThe left-to-right operation convention would resolve the ambiguity in favor of the last expression. Further, the mathematical habit of combining factors and representing division as multiplication by a reciprocal both greatly reduce the frequency of ambiguous division. However, when two long expressions are combined by division, the correct order of operations can be lost in the notation.\n\n==Calculators==\n{{main article|Calculator input methods}}\nDifferent calculators follow different orders of operations. Many simple calculators without a stack implement [[chain input]] working left to right without any priority given to different operators, for example typing\n: <code>1 + 2 × 3</code> yields 9,\nwhile more sophisticated calculators will use a more standard priority, for example typing\n: <code>1 + 2 × 3</code> yields 7.\n\nThe ''[[Microsoft Calculator]]'' program uses the former in its standard view and the latter in its scientific and programmer views.\n\nChain input expects two operands and an operator. When the next operator is pressed, the expression is immediately evaluated and the answer becomes the left hand of the next operator. Advanced calculators allow entry of the whole expression, grouped as necessary, and evaluates only when the user uses the equals sign.\n\nCalculators may associate exponents to the left or to the right depending on the model or the evaluation mode. For example, the expression <code>''a''^''b''^''c''</code> is interpreted as ''a''<sup>(''b''<sup>''c''</sup>)</sup> on the [[TI-92]] and the [[TI-30#Models|TI-30XS MultiView]] in \"Mathprint mode\", whereas it is interpreted as (''a''<sup>''b''</sup>)<sup>''c''</sup> on the [[TI-30#Models|TI-30XII]] and the [[TI-30#Models|TI-30XS MultiView]] in \"Classic mode\".\n\nAn expression like <code>1/2''x''</code> is interpreted as 1/(2''x'') by [[TI-82]], but as (1/2)''x'' by [[TI-83]] and every other TI calculator released since 1996,<ref name=\"TI_2011_11773\">{{cite web |title=Implied Multiplication Versus Explicit Multiplication on TI Graphing Calculators |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |date=2011-01-16 |id=11773 |url=http://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=103110 |access-date=2015-08-24 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417214906/https://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=103110 |archive-date=2016-04-17}}</ref> as well as by all [[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators with algebraic notation.

Exceptions exist; for example, languages with operators corresponding to the [[cons]] operation on lists usually make them group right to left (\"right associative\"), e.g. in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], <code>1:2:3:4:[] == 1:(2:(3:(4:[]))) == [1,2,3,4]</code>.\n\nThe [[logical bitwise operator]]s in [[C (programming language)|C]] (and all programming languages that borrow precedence rules from C, for example, [[C++]], [[Perl]] and [[PHP]]) have a precedence level that the creator of the C language considered unsatisfactory.<ref>[[Dennis M.

This amounts to replace \"irreducible\" by \"square-free\" in the preceding description of the outcome.\n\n== Basic principles ==\n\nIf a rational function <math>R(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</math> in one [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] {{math|''x''}} has a [[denominator]] that factors as\n\n:<math> g(x) = P(x) \\cdot Q(x) </math>\n\nover a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}} (we can take this to be [[real number]]s, or [[complex number]]s) and if in addition {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} have no common factor, then by [[Polynomial greatest common divisor#Bézout's identity and extended GCD algorithm|Bézout's identity for polynomials]], there exist polynomials {{math|''C''(''x'')}} and {{math|''D''(''x'')}} such that <math>\\deg(C) < \\deg(Q)</math>, <math>\\deg(D) < \\deg(P)</math>, and\n\n:<math>CP + DQ = 1</math>\n\nThus\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{g(x)} = \\frac{CP+DQ}{PQ} = \\frac{C}{Q}+\\frac{D}{P}</math>\n\nand hence {{math|''R''}} may be written as\n\n:<math> R = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{Df(x)}{P} + \\frac{Cf(x)}{Q},</math>\n\nwhere all numerators are polynomials.\n\nUsing this idea inductively the rational function {{math|''R''(''x'')}} can be written as a sum with denominators being powers of [[irreducible polynomial]]s. To take this further, if required, write:\n\n:<math>\\frac {G(x)}{F(x)^n}</math>\n\nas a sum with denominators powers of {{math|''F''}} and [[numerator]]s of degree lower than the degree of {{math|''F''}}, plus a possible extra polynomial. This can be done by the [[Euclidean algorithm for polynomials]].  The result is the following [[theorem]]:\n\n{{math_theorem|name=Theorem|Let {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} be nonzero polynomials over a field {{math|''K''}}. Write {{math|''g''}} as a product of powers of distinct irreducible polynomials :\n\n: <math>g=\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i}.</math>\n\nThere are (unique) polynomials {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>}} with {{math|deg ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub> < deg ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} such that\n\n: <math>\\frac{f}{g}=b+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\\frac{a_{ij}}{p_i^j}.</math>\n\nIf {{math|deg ''f'' < deg ''g''}}, then {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}}.}}\n\nIf {{math|''K''}} is field of [[complex number]]s, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] implies that all  {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} have degree one, and all numerators <math>a_{ij}</math> are constants. When {{math|''K''}} is the field of [[real number]]s, some of the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} may be quadratic, so, in the partial fraction decomposition, quotients of linear polynomials by powers of quadratic polynomials may also occur.\n\nIn the preceding theorem, one may replace \"distinct irreducible polynomials\" by \"[[pairwise coprime]] polynomials that are coprime with their derivative\". For example, the {{math|''p''<sub>''i''</sub>}} may be the factors of the [[square-free factorization]] of {{math|''g''}}. When {{math|''K''}} is the field of [[rational number]]s, as it is typically the case in [[computer algebra]], this allows to replace factorization by [[polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] computation for computing a partial fraction decomposition.\n\n==Application to symbolic integration==\n\nFor the purpose of [[symbolic integration]], the preceding result may be refined into\n\n{{math_theorem|name=Theorem|Let ''f'' and ''g'' be nonzero polynomials over a field ''K''. Write ''g'' as a product of powers of pairwise coprime polynomials which have no multiple root in an algebraically closed field:\n\n: <math>g=\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i}.</math>\n\nThere are (unique) polynomials ''b'' and ''c''<sub>''ij''</sub> with deg&nbsp;''c''<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;deg&nbsp;''p''<sub>''i''</sub> such that\n\n: <math>\\frac{f}{g}=b+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{j=2}^{n_i}\\left(\\frac{c_{ij}}{p_i^{j-1}}\\right)' + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{c_{i1}}{p_i}.</math>\n\nwhere <math> X'</math> denotes the derivative of <math>X.</math>}}\n\nThis reduces the computation of the [[antiderivative]] of a rational function to the integration of the last sum, which is called the ''logarithmic part'', because its antiderivative is a linear combination of logarithms. In fact, we have\n\n:<math>\\frac{c_{i1}}{p_i}=\\sum_{\\alpha_j:p_i(\\alpha_j)=0}\\frac{c_{i1}(\\alpha_j)}{p'_i(\\alpha_j)}\\frac{1}{x-\\alpha_j}.</math>\n\nThere are various methods to compute above decomposition. The one that is the simplest to describe is probably the so-called [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]]'s method. As the degree of ''c''<sub>''ij''</sub> is bounded by the degree of ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>, and the degree of ''b'' is the difference of the degrees of ''f'' and ''g'' (if this difference is non negative; otherwise, ''b''=0), one may write these unknowns polynomials as polynomials with unknown coefficients. Reducing the two members of above formula to the same denominator and writing that the coefficients of each power of ''x'' are the same in the two numerators, one gets a [[system of linear equations]] which can be solved to obtain the desired values for the unknowns coefficients.\n\n== Procedure ==\n\nGiven two polynomials <math>P(x)</math> and <math>Q(x) = (x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2) \\cdots (x-\\alpha_n)</math>, where the ''α''<sub>''i''</sub> are distinct constants and deg&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'', partial fractions are generally obtained by supposing that\n\n: <math>\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{c_1}{x-\\alpha_1} + \\frac{c_2}{x-\\alpha_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{c_n}{x-\\alpha_n}</math>\n\nand solving for the ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> constants, by substitution, by [[equating the coefficients]] of terms involving the powers of ''x'', or otherwise.  (This is a variant of the [[method of undetermined coefficients]].)\n\nA more direct computation, which is strongly related with [[Lagrange interpolation]] consists of writing\n\n: <math>\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{P(\\alpha_i)}{Q'(\\alpha_i)}\\frac{1}{(x-\\alpha_i)} </math>\n\nwhere <math>Q'</math> is the derivative of the polynomial <math>Q</math>.\n\nThis approach does not account for several other cases, but can be modified accordingly:\n\n* If <math>\\deg P \\geqslant \\deg Q, </math> then it is necessary to perform the [[Polynomial#Divisibility|Euclidean division]] of ''P'' by ''Q'', using [[polynomial long division]], giving ''P''(''x'') = ''E''(''x'') ''Q''(''x'') + ''R''(''x'') with deg&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n''. Dividing by ''Q''(''x'') this gives\n:: <math>\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = E(x) + \\frac{R(x)}{Q(x)},</math>\n:and then seek partial fractions for the remainder fraction (which by definition satisfies deg&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;<&nbsp;deg&nbsp;''Q'').\n* If ''Q''(''x'') contains factors which are irreducible over the given field, then the numerator ''N''(''x'') of each partial fraction with such a factor ''F''(''x'') in the denominator must be sought as a polynomial with deg&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;<&nbsp;deg&nbsp;''F'', rather than as a constant. For example, take the following decomposition over '''R''':\n:: <math>\\frac{x^2 + 1}{(x+2)(x-1)\\color{Blue}(x^2+x+1)} = \\frac{a}{x+2} + \\frac{b}{x-1} + \\frac{\\color{OliveGreen}cx + d}{\\color{Blue}x^2 + x + 1}.</math>\n* Suppose ''Q''(''x'') = (''x'' − ''α'')<sup>''r''</sup>''S''(''x'') and ''S''(''α'')&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0. Then ''Q''(''x'') has a zero ''α'' of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicity]] ''r'', and in the partial fraction decomposition, ''r'' of the partial fractions will involve the powers of (''x'' − ''α''). For illustration, take ''S''(''x'') =&nbsp;1 to get the following decomposition:\n:: <math>\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{P(x)}{(x-\\alpha)^r} = \\frac{c_1}{x-\\alpha} + \\frac{c_2}{(x-\\alpha)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{c_r}{(x-\\alpha)^r}.</math>\n\n=== Illustration ===\n\nIn an example application of this procedure, {{nowrap|(3''x'' + 5)/(1 &minus; 2''x'')<sup>2</sup>}} can be decomposed in the form\n\n: <math>\\frac{3x + 5}{(1-2x)^2} = \\frac{A}{(1-2x)^2} + \\frac{B}{(1-2x)}.</math>\n\n[[Clearing denominators]] shows that {{nowrap|1=3''x'' + 5 = ''A'' + ''B''(1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2''x'')}}. Expanding and equating the coefficients of powers of ''x'' gives\n\n: 5 = ''A'' + ''B'' and  3''x'' = &minus;2''Bx''\n\nSolving for ''A'' and ''B'' yields ''A'' = 13/2 and ''B'' = &minus;3/2.  Hence,\n\n: <math>\\frac{3x + 5}{(1-2x)^2} = \\frac{13/2}{(1-2x)^2} + \\frac{-3/2}{(1-2x)}.</math>\n\n=== Residue method ===\n{{see also|Heaviside cover-up method}}\nOver the complex numbers, suppose ''f''(''x'') is a rational proper fraction, and can be decomposed into\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{a_{i1}}{x - x_i} + \\frac{a_{i2}}{( x - x_i)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{i k_i}}{(x - x_i)^{k_i}} \\right). </math>\n\nLet\n\n: <math> g_{ij}(x)=(x-x_i)^{j-1}f(x),</math>\n\nthen according to the [[Laurent series#Uniqueness|uniqueness of Laurent series]], ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub> is the coefficient of the term (''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>&minus;1</sup> in the Laurent expansion of ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub>(''x'') about the point ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, i.e., its [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]\n\n: <math>a_{ij} = \\operatorname{Res}(g_{ij},x_i).</math>\n\nThis is given directly by the formula\n\n: <math>a_{ij} = \\frac 1 {(k_i-j)!}\\lim_{x\\to x_i}\\frac{d^{k_i-j}}{dx^{k_i-j}} \\left((x-x_i)^{k_i} f(x)\\right),</math>\n\nor in the special case when ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> is a simple root,\n\n: <math>a_{i1}=\\frac{P(x_i)}{Q'(x_i)},</math>\n\nwhen\n\n: <math>f(x)=\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}.</math>\n\n== Over the reals ==\n\nPartial fractions are used in [[real number|real-variable]] [[integral calculus]] to find real-valued [[antiderivative]]s of [[rational function]]s. Partial fraction decomposition of real [[rational function]]s is also used to find their [[Inverse Laplace transform]]s. For applications of '''partial fraction decomposition over the reals''', see\n\n* [[#Application to symbolic integration|Application to symbolic integration]], above\n* [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]]\n\n=== General result ===\n\nLet ''f''(''x'') be any rational function over the [[real number]]s.  In other words, suppose there exist real polynomials functions ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'')≠ 0, such that\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</math>\n\nBy dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the leading coefficient of ''q''(''x''), we may assume [[without loss of generality]] that ''q''(''x'') is [[monic polynomial|monic]]. By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], we can write\n\n: <math>q(x) = (x-a_1)^{j_1}\\cdots(x-a_m)^{j_m}(x^2+b_1x+c_1)^{k_1}\\cdots(x^2+b_nx+c_n)^{k_n}</math>\n\nwhere ''a''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''a''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''c''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> are real numbers with ''b''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>2</sup> − 4''c''<sub>''i''</sub> < 0, and ''j''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''j''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''k''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''k''<sub>''n''</sub> are positive integers.  The terms (''x'' − ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>) are the ''linear factors'' of ''q''(''x'') which correspond to real roots of ''q''(''x''), and the terms (''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sub>''i''</sub>''x'' + ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>) are the ''irreducible quadratic factors'' of ''q''(''x'') which correspond to pairs of [[complex number|complex]] conjugate roots of ''q''(''x'').\n\nThen the partial fraction decomposition of ''f''(''x'') is the following:\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = P(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^m\\sum_{r=1}^{j_i} \\frac{A_{ir}}{(x-a_i)^r} + \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{r=1}^{k_i} \\frac{B_{ir}x+C_{ir}}{(x^2+b_ix+c_i)^r}</math>\n\nHere, ''P''(''x'') is a (possibly zero) polynomial, and the ''A''<sub>''ir''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''ir''</sub>, and ''C''<sub>''ir''</sub> are real constants.  There are a number of ways the constants can be found.\n\nThe most straightforward method is to multiply through by the common denominator ''q''(''x'').  We then obtain an equation of polynomials whose left-hand side is simply ''p''(''x'') and whose right-hand side has coefficients which are linear expressions of the constants ''A''<sub>''ir''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''ir''</sub>, and ''C''<sub>''ir''</sub>.  Since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal, we can equate the coefficients of like terms.  In this way, a system of linear equations is obtained which ''always'' has a unique solution.  This solution can be found using any of the standard methods of [[linear algebra]]. It can also be found with [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] (see [[#Example 5 (limit method)|Example 5]]).\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Example 1 ===\n\n: <math>f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2+2x-3}</math>\n\nHere, the denominator splits into two distinct linear factors:\n\n: <math>q(x)=x^2+2x-3=(x+3)(x-1)</math>\n\nso we have the partial fraction decomposition\n\n: <math>f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2+2x-3} =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}</math>\n\nMultiplying through by the denominator on the left-hand side gives us the polynomial identity\n\n: <math>1=A(x-1)+B(x+3)</math>\n\nSubstituting ''x''  = −3 into this equation gives ''A'' = −1/4, and substituting ''x''  = 1 gives ''B'' = 1/4, so that\n\n: <math>f(x) =\\frac{1}{x^2+2x-3} =\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{-1}{x+3}+\\frac{1}{x-1}\\right)</math>\n\n=== Example 2 ===\n\n: <math>f(x)=\\frac{x^3+16}{x^3-4x^2+8x}</math>\n\nAfter [[Polynomial long division|long-division]], we have\n\n: <math>f(x)=1+\\frac{4x^2-8x+16}{x^3-4x^2+8x}=1+\\frac{4x^2-8x+16}{x(x^2-4x+8)}</math>\n\nThe factor ''x''<sup>2</sup> − 4''x'' + 8 is irreducible over the reals, as its [[discriminant]] {{math|1=(−4)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;4×8 = − 16}} is negative. Thus the partial fraction decomposition over the reals has the shape\n\n: <math>\\frac{4x^2-8x+16}{x(x^2-4x+8)}=\\frac{A}{x}+\\frac{Bx+C}{x^2-4x+8}</math>\n\nMultiplying through by ''x''<sup>3</sup> − 4''x''<sup>2</sup> + 8''x'', we have the polynomial identity\n\n: <math>4x^2-8x+16 = A(x^2-4x+8)+(Bx+C)x</math>\n\nTaking ''x'' = 0, we see that 16 = 8''A'', so ''A'' = 2.  Comparing the ''x''<sup>2</sup> coefficients, we see that 4 = ''A'' + ''B'' = 2 + ''B'', so ''B'' = 2.  Comparing linear coefficients, we see that −8 = −4''A'' + ''C'' = −8 + ''C'', so ''C'' = 0.

Since\n\n:<math> \\deg\\left( P- \\sum_{j=1}^{r}Q_jA_j \\right) < \\deg(Q)</math>\n\nwe then have\n\n:<math>  P- \\sum_{j=1}^{r}Q_jA_j=0,</math>\n\nand we find the partial fraction decomposition dividing by <math>  Q</math>.\n\n== Fractions of integers ==\n\nThe idea of partial fractions can be generalized to other [[integral domain]]s, say the ring of [[integer]]s where [[prime numbers]] take the role of irreducible denominators.

One of the fastest known algorithms is due to [[H. J. Ryser]] ({{harvtxt|Ryser|1963|loc=p. 27}}). [[Ryser's formula|Ryser’s method]] is based on an [[inclusion–exclusion principle|inclusion–exclusion]] formula that can be given<ref>{{harvtxt|van Lint|Wilson|2001}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=5l5ps2JkyT0C&pg=PA108&dq=permanent+ryser&lr=#PPA99,M1 p. 99]</ref> as follows: Let <math>A_k</math> be obtained from ''A'' by deleting ''k'' columns, let <math>P(A_k)</math> be the product of the row-sums of <math>A_k</math>, and  let <math>\\Sigma_k</math> be the sum of the values of <math>P(A_k)</math> over all possible <math>A_k</math>.

While the determinant can be computed in [[polynomial time]] by [[Gaussian elimination]], Gaussian elimination cannot be used to compute the permanent.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''ping-pong lemma''', or '''table-tennis lemma''', is any of several mathematical statements that ensure that several elements in a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on a set freely [[Generating set of a group|generates]] a [[free group|free]] [[subgroup]] of that group.\n\n==History==\n\nThe ping-pong argument goes back to late 19th century and is commonly attributed<ref name=\"DH\"/> to [[Felix Klein]] who used it to study subgroups of [[Kleinian group]]s, that is, of discrete groups of isometries of the [[hyperbolic 3-space]] or, equivalently [[Möbius transformation]]s of the [[Riemann sphere]]. The ping-pong lemma was a key tool used by [[Jacques Tits]] in his 1972 paper<ref name=\"T\">J. Tits.

The following statement appears in<ref>Andrij Olijnyk and Vitaly Suchchansky. [http://www.worldscinet.com/cgi-bin/details.cgi?id=pii:S0218196704001931&type=html Representations of free products by infinite unitriangular matrices over finite fields.] International Journal of Algebra and Computation. Vol. 14 (2004), no. 5&ndash;6, pp. 741&ndash;749; Lemma 2.1</ref>, and the proof is from<ref name=\"DH\"/>.\n\nLet ''G'' be a group acting on a set ''X'' and let ''H''<sub>1</sub>, ''H''<sub>2</sub>,...., ''H''<sub>''k''</sub> be nontrivial subgroups of ''G'' where ''k''≥2, such that at least one of these subgroups has [[order (group theory)|order]] greater than 2.\nSuppose there exist [[Disjoint_sets#Generalizations|pairwise disjoint]] nonempty subsets ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>,....,''X''<sub>''k''</sub> of ''X'' such that the following holds:\n\n*For any ''i''≠''s'' and for any ''h''∈''H''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''h''≠1  we have ''h''(''X''<sub>''s''</sub>)⊆''X''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\nThen\n:<math>\\langle H_1,\\dots, H_k\\rangle=H_1\\ast\\dots \\ast H_k.</math>\n\n====Proof====\nBy the definition of free product, it suffices to check that a given reduced word is nontrivial. Let ''w'' be such a word, and let\n\n:<math> w= \\prod_{i=1}^m w_{\\alpha_i,\\beta_i}. </math>\n\nWhere ''w''<sub>''s'',''β''<sub>''j''</sub></sub>∈ ''H''<sub>''s''</sub> for all such ''β''<sub>''j''</sub>, and since ''w'' is fully reduced ''α''<sub>''i''</sub>≠ α<sub>''i''+1 </sub> for any ''i''. We then let ''w'' act on an element of one of the sets ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>. As we assume for at least one subgroup ''H''<sub>i</sub> has order at least 3, without loss of generality we may assume that ''H''<sub>1</sub> has order at least 3. We first make the assumption that α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>m</sub> are both 1. From here we consider ''w'' acting on ''X''<sub>2</sub>. We get the following chain of containments and note that since the ''X''<sub>i</sub> are disjoint that ''w'' acts nontrivially and is thus not the identity element.\n\n:<math> w(X_2) \\subseteq \\prod_{i=1}^{m-1} w_{\\alpha_i,\\beta_i}(X_1) \\subseteq \\prod_{i=1}^{m-2} w_{\\alpha_i,\\beta_i}(X_{\\alpha_{m-1}})\\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq w_{1,\\beta_1}w_{\\alpha_2,\\beta_2}(X_{\\alpha_3}) \\subseteq </math> <math> w_{1,\\beta_1}(X_{\\alpha_2})\\subseteq X_1 </math>\n\nTo finish the proof we must consider the three cases: \n*If <math> \\alpha_1 = 1;\\alpha_m\\neq 1 </math>, then let <math> h\\in H_1\\setminus \\{w_{1,\\beta_1}^{-1},1\\}. </math> (Such <math>h</math> exists since by assumption ''H''<sub>1</sub> has order at least 3.)\n*If <math>\\alpha_1\\neq 1;\\alpha_m=1</math>, then let <math> h\\in H_1\\setminus \\{w_{1,\\beta_m},1\\} </math>\n*And if <math> \\alpha_1\\neq 1;\\alpha_m\\neq 1</math>, then let <math> h\\in H_1\\setminus \\{1\\} </math>\nIn each case, ''hwh''<sup>−1</sup> is a reduced word with ''α''<sub>1</sub>'  and ''α''<sub>''m'' '</sub>' both 1, and thus is nontrivial. Finally, ''hwh''<sup>−1</sup> is not 1, and so neither is ''w''. This proves the claim.\n\n===The Ping-pong lemma for cyclic subgroups===\n\nLet ''G'' be a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on a set ''X''. Let ''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''k''</sub> be elements of ''G'' of infinite order, where ''k'' ≥ 2. Suppose there exist disjoint nonempty subsets\n\n:''X''<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>,...,''X''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>+</sup> and ''X''<sub>1</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>,...,''X''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>\n\nof ''X'' with the following properties:\n\n*''a''<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''X''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) ⊆ ''X''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>+</sup> for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''k'';\n*''a''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup>(''X''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''X''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>+</sup>) ⊆ ''X''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''k''.\n\nThen the subgroup ''H'' = <''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>> ≤ ''G'' [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> is [[free group|free]] with free basis {''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}.\n\n====Proof====\nThis statement follows as a corollary of the version for general subgroups if we let ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>= ''X''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>+</sup>∪''X''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>−</sup> and let ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> = ⟨''a''<sub>''i''</sub>⟩.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Special linear group example===\nOne can use the ping-pong lemma to prove<ref name=\"DH\"/> that the subgroup ''H'' = <''A'',''B''>≤SL(2,'''Z'''), generated by  the matrices\n\n:<math>\\scriptstyle A=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\ 0 &1 \\end{pmatrix} </math> and <math>\\scriptstyle B=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 2 &1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>\n\nis [[free group|free]] of rank two.\n\n====Proof====\nIndeed, let ''H''<sub>1</sub> = <''A''> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> = <''B''> be [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]]s of SL(2,'''Z''') generated by ''A'' and ''B'' accordingly.   It is not hard to check that A and B are elements of infinite order in SL(2,'''Z''') and that\n\n:<math>H_1=\\{A^n|n\\in \\mathbb Z\\}=\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2n\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} : n\\in\\mathbb Z\\right\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>H_2=\\{B^n|n\\in \\mathbb Z\\}=\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 2n & 1 \\end{pmatrix} : n\\in\\mathbb Z\\right\\}.</math>\n\nConsider the standard action of SL(2,'''Z''') on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by [[linear transformation]]s. Put\n\n:<math>X_1=\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\in \\mathbb R^2 : |x|>|y|\\right\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X_2=\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\in \\mathbb R^2 : |x|<|y|\\right\\}.</math>\n\nIt is not hard to check, using the above explicitly descriptions of ''H''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> that for every nontrivial ''g''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''H''<sub>1</sub> we have ''g''(''X''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''X''<sub>1</sub> and that for every nontrivial ''g''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''H''<sub>2</sub> we have ''g''(''X''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''X''<sub>2</sub>. Using the alternative form of the ping-pong lemma, for two subgroups, given above, we conclude that ''H''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''H''<sub>1</sub>∗''H''<sub>2</sub>. Since the groups ''H''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> are [[infinite cyclic group|infinite cyclic]], it follows that ''H'' is a [[free group]] of rank two.\n\n===Word-hyperbolic group example===\n\nLet ''G'' be a [[word-hyperbolic group]] which is [[torsion-free group|torsion-free]], that is, with no nontrivial elements of finite [[Order (group theory)|order]]. Let ''g'',&nbsp;''h''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G'' be two non-commuting elements, that is such that ''gh''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''hg''. Then there exists ''M''≥1 such that for any integers ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''M'', ''m''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''M'' the subgroup H&nbsp;=&nbsp;<''g''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''h''<sup>''m''</sup>>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''G'' is [[free group|free]] of rank two.\n\n====Sketch of the proof<ref name=\"Gromov\">M.

It is known that if ''a''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G'' is a nontrivial element then ''a'' has exactly two distinct fixed points, ''a''<sup>∞</sup> and ''a''<sup>&minus;∞</sup> in ∂''G'' and that ''a''<sup>∞</sup> is an [[attracting fixed point]] while ''a''<sup>&minus;∞</sup> is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|repelling fixed point]].\n\nSince ''g'' and ''h'' do not commute, the basic facts about [[word-hyperbolic group]]s imply that ''g''<sup>∞</sup>, ''g''<sup>&minus;∞</sup>, ''h''<sup>∞</sup> and ''h''<sup>&minus;∞</sup> are four distinct points in   ∂''G''.

In the Kleinian groups context the ping-pong lemma can be used to show that a particular group of isometries of the [[hyperbolic 3-space]] is not just [[free group|free]] but also [[properly discontinuous]] and [[geometrically finite group|geometrically finite]].\n*Similar Schottky-type arguments are widely used in [[geometric group theory]], particularly for subgroups of [[word-hyperbolic group]]s<ref name=\"Gromov\"/> and for automorphism groups of trees.<ref>[[Alexander Lubotzky]].

      "text": "{{short description|In mathematics, sum of products of variables, power of variables, and coefficients}}\n[[File:Polynomialdeg3.svg|The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a polynomial function of degree 3.|thumb]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''polynomial''' is an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] consisting of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] (also called [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminates]]) and [[coefficient]]s, that involves only the operations of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and non-negative [[integer]] [[exponentiation|exponents]] of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate, {{math|''x''}}, is {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − 4''x'' + 7}}. An example in three variables is {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + 2''xyz''<sup>2</sup> − ''yz'' + 1}}.\n\nPolynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form [[polynomial equation]]s, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problems]] to complicated scientific problems; they are used to define '''polynomial functions''', which appear in settings ranging from basic [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] to [[economics]] and [[social science]]; they are used in [[calculus]] and [[numerical analysis]] to approximate other functions. In advanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct [[polynomial ring]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], central concepts in [[algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''polynomial'' [[hybrid word|joins two diverse roots]]: the Greek ''poly'', meaning \"many,\" and the Latin ''nomen'', or name. It was derived from the term ''[[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]'' by replacing the Latin root ''bi-'' with the Greek ''poly-''. The word ''polynomial'' was first used in the 17th century.<ref>See \"polynomial\" and \"binomial\", ''Compact Oxford English Dictionary''</ref>\n{{anchor|Polynomial notation}}\n\n==Notation and terminology==\nThe ''x'' occurring in a polynomial is commonly called either a ''variable'' or an ''indeterminate''. When the polynomial is considered as an expression, ''x'' is a fixed symbol which does not have any value (its value is \"indeterminate\"). However, when one considers the [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined by the polynomial, then ''x'' represents the argument of the function, and is therefore called a \"variable\". Many authors use these two words interchangeably.\n\nIt is common to use uppercase letters for indeterminates and corresponding lowercase letters for the variables (or arguments) of the associated function {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\nA polynomial ''P'' in the indeterminate ''x'' is commonly denoted either as ''P'' or as ''P''(''x''). Formally, the name of the polynomial is ''P'', not ''P''(''x''), but the use of the [[functional notation]] ''P''(''x'') date from the time where the distinction between a polynomial and the associated function was unclear. Moreover, the functional notation is often useful for specifying, in a single phrase, a polynomial and its indeterminate. For example, \"let ''P''(''x'') be a polynomial\" is a shorthand for \"let ''P'' be a polynomial in the indeterminate ''x''\". On the other hand, when it is not necessary to emphasize the name of the indeterminate, many formulas are much simpler and easier to read if the name(s) of the indeterminate(s) do not appear at each occurrence of the polynomial.\n\nThe ambiguity of having two notations for a single mathematical object may be formally resolved by considering the general meaning of the functional notation for polynomials.\nIf ''a'' denotes a number, a variable, another polynomial, or, more generally any expression, then ''P''(''a'') denotes, by convention, the result of substituting ''a'' for ''x'' in ''P''. Thus, the polynomial ''P'' defines the function\n:<math>a\\mapsto P(a),</math>\nwhich is the ''polynomial function'' associated to ''P''.\nFrequently, when using this notation, one supposes that ''a'' is a number. However one may use it over any domain where addition and multiplication are defined (that is, any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]). In particular, if ''a'' is a polynomial then ''P''(''a'') is also a polynomial.\n \nMore specifically, when ''a'' is the indeterminate ''x'', then the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''x'' by this function is the polynomial ''P'' itself (substituting ''x'' to ''x'' does not change anything). In other words,\n:<math>P(x)=P,</math>\nwhich justifies formally the existence of two notations for the same polynomial.\n\n==Definition==\nA polynomial is an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] that can be built from [[constant (mathematics)|constants]] and symbols called indeterminates or variables by means of [[addition]], [[multiplication]] and [[exponentiation]] to a [[non-negative integer]] power. Two such expressions that may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of [[commutative property|commutativity]], [[associative property|associativity]] and [[distributive property|distributivity]] of addition and multiplication are considered as defining the same polynomial.\n\nA polynomial in a single indeterminate ''x'' can always be written (or rewritten) in the form\n:<math>a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dotsb + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0,</math>\nwhere <math>a_0, \\ldots, a_n</math> are constants and <math>x</math> is the indeterminate. The word \"indeterminate\" means that <math>x</math> represents no particular value, although any value may be substituted for it. The mapping that associates the result of this substitution to the substituted value is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], called a ''polynomial function''.\n\nThis can be expressed more concisely by using [[summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]]:\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k</math>\n\nThat is, a polynomial can either be zero or can be written as the sum of a finite number of non-zero [[term (mathematics)|terms]]. Each term consists of the product of a number—called the [[coefficient]] of the term<ref>The coefficient of a term may be any number from a specified set. If that set is the set of real numbers, we speak of \"polynomials over the reals\". Other common kinds of polynomials are polynomials with integer coefficients, polynomials with complex coefficients, and polynomials with coefficients that are integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] of some [[prime number]] {{math|''p''}}.</ref>—and a finite number of indeterminates, raised to nonnegative integer powers.\n\n==Classification==\n{{further|Degree of a polynomial}}\nThe exponent on an indeterminate in a term is called the degree of that indeterminate in that term; the degree of the term is the sum of the degrees of the indeterminates in that term, and the degree of a polynomial is the largest degree of any one term with nonzero coefficient. Because {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>1</sup>}}, the degree of an indeterminate without a written exponent is one.\n\nA term with no indeterminates and a polynomial with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a [[constant term]] and a constant polynomial.<ref>This terminology dates from the time when the distinction was not clear between a polynomial and the function that it defines: a constant term and a constant polynomial define [[constant function]]s.</ref> The degree of a constant term and of a nonzero constant polynomial is 0. The degree of the zero polynomial, 0, (which has no terms at all) is generally treated as not defined (but see below).<ref name=Barbeau-2003-pp1-2>{{cite book |last=Barbeau |first=E.J. |title=Polynomials |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-387-40627-5 |pages=1–2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CynRMm5qTmQC&pg=PA1}}</ref>\n\nFor example:\n:<math> -5x^2y </math>\n\nis a term. The coefficient is {{math|−5}}, the indeterminates are {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}, the degree of {{math|''x''}} is two, while the degree of {{math|''y''}} is one. The degree of the entire term is the sum of the degrees of each indeterminate in it, so in this example the degree is {{math|2 + 1 {{=}} 3}}.\n\nForming a sum of several terms produces a polynomial. For example, the following is a polynomial:\n:<math>\\underbrace{_\\,3x^2}_{\\begin{smallmatrix}\\mathrm{term}\\\\\\mathrm{1}\\end{smallmatrix}} \\underbrace{-_\\,5x}_{\\begin{smallmatrix}\\mathrm{term}\\\\\\mathrm{2}\\end{smallmatrix}} \\underbrace{+_\\,4}_{\\begin{smallmatrix}\\mathrm{term}\\\\\\mathrm{3}\\end{smallmatrix}}. </math>\n\nIt consists of three terms: the first is degree two, the second is degree one, and the third is degree zero.\n\n{{anchor|linear polynomial}}Polynomials of small degree have been given specific names. A polynomial of degree zero is a ''constant polynomial'' or simply a ''constant''. Polynomials of degree one, two or three are respectively ''linear polynomials,'' ''quadratic polynomials'' and ''cubic polynomials''. For higher degrees the specific names are not commonly used, although ''quartic polynomial'' (for degree four) and ''quintic polynomial'' (for degree five) are sometimes used. The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms. For example, in {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 2''x'' + 1}} the term {{math|2''x''}} is a linear term in a quadratic polynomial.\n\n{{anchor|zero polynomial}}The polynomial 0, which may be considered to have no terms at all, is called the '''zero polynomial'''. Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. Rather the degree of the zero polynomial is either left explicitly undefined, or defined as negative (either −1 or −∞).<ref>{{MathWorld |urlname=ZeroPolynomial |title=Zero Polynomial}}</ref> These conventions are useful when defining [[Euclidean division of polynomials]]. The zero polynomial is also unique in that it is the only polynomial having an infinite number of [[root of a function|roots]]. The graph of the zero polynomial, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}}, is the {{math|''X''}}-axis.\n\nIn the case of polynomials in more than one indeterminate, a polynomial is called ''homogeneous'' of {{nowrap|degree {{math|''n''}}}} if ''all'' its non-zero terms have {{nowrap|degree {{math|''n''}}}}. The zero polynomial is homogeneous, and, as homogeneous polynomial, its degree is undefined.<ref>In fact, as [[homogeneous function]], it is homogeneous of ''every'' degree</ref> For example, {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup> + 7''x''<sup>2</sup>''y''<sup>3</sup> − 3''x''<sup>5</sup>}} is homogeneous of degree 5. For more details, see [[homogeneous polynomial]].\n\nThe [[commutative law]] of addition can be used to rearrange terms into any preferred order. In polynomials with one indeterminate, the terms are usually ordered according to degree, either in \"descending powers of {{math|''x''}}\", with the term of largest degree first, or in \"ascending powers of {{math|''x''}}\". The polynomial in the example above is written in descending powers of {{math|''x''}}. The first term has coefficient {{math|3}}, indeterminate {{math|''x''}}, and exponent {{math|2}}. In the second term, the coefficient {{nowrap|is {{math|−5}}}}. The third term is a constant. Because the ''degree'' of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Harold M. |title=Linear Algebra |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8176-3731-6 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ylFR4h5BIDEC&pg=PA78}}</ref>\n\nTwo terms with the same indeterminates raised to the same powers are called \"similar terms\" or \"like terms\", and they can be combined, using the [[distributive law]], into a single term whose coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of the terms that were combined. It may happen that this makes the coefficient 0.<ref name=\"Edwards-1995-p47\"/> Polynomials can be classified by the number of terms with nonzero coefficients, so that a one-term polynomial is called a [[monomial]],<ref>Some authors use \"monomial\" to mean \"[[monic polynomial|monic]] monomial\". See {{cite book |first=Anthony W. |last=Knapp |title=Advanced Algebra: Along with a Companion Volume Basic Algebra |page=457 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8176-4522-5}}</ref> a two-term polynomial is called a [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]], and a three-term polynomial is called a ''trinomial''. The term \"quadrinomial\" is occasionally used for a four-term polynomial.\n\n{{anchor|real polynomial|complex polynomial|integer polynomial}}A '''real polynomial''' is a polynomial with [[real number|real]] coefficients. The argument of the polynomial is not necessarily so restricted, for instance the [[s-plane]] variable in [[Laplace transform]]s. A '''real polynomial function''' is a function from the reals to the reals that is defined by a real polynomial. Similarly, an '''integer polynomial''' is a polynomial with [[integer]] coefficients, and a '''complex polynomial''' is a polynomial with [[complex number|complex]] coefficients.\n\n{{anchor|univariate|bivariate|Number of variables|Multivariate polynomial}}A polynomial in one indeterminate is called a ''[[univariate]] polynomial'', a polynomial in more than one indeterminate is called a '''multivariate polynomial'''. A polynomial with two indeterminates is called a '''bivariate polynomial'''. These notions refer more to the kind of polynomials one is generally working with than to individual polynomials; for instance when working with univariate polynomials one does not exclude constant polynomials (which may result, for instance, from the subtraction of non-constant polynomials), although strictly speaking constant polynomials do not contain any indeterminates at all. It is possible to further classify multivariate polynomials as ''bivariate'', ''trivariate'', and so on, according to the maximum number of indeterminates allowed. Again, so that the set of objects under consideration be closed under subtraction, a study of trivariate polynomials usually allows bivariate polynomials, and so on. It is common, also, to say simply \"polynomials in {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}}\", listing the indeterminates allowed.\n\n{{anchor|evaluation}}The ''evaluation of a polynomial'' consists of substituting a numerical value to each indeterminate and carrying out the indicated multiplications and additions. For polynomials in one indeterminate, the evaluation is usually more efficient (lower number of arithmetic operations to perform) using [[Horner's method]]:\n:<math>(((\\dotsb((a_n x + a_{n-1})x + a_{n-2})x + \\dotsb + a_3)x + a_2)x + a_1)x + a_0.</math>\n\n==Arithmetic==\nPolynomials can be added using the [[associative law]] of addition (grouping all their terms together into a single sum), possibly followed by reordering, and combining of like terms.<ref name=\"Edwards-1995-p47\">{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Harold M. |title=Linear Algebra |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8176-3731-6 |page=47 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ylFR4h5BIDEC&pg=PA47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Salomon |first=David |title=Coding for Data and Computer Communications |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-387-23804-3 |page=459 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zr9bjEpXKnIC&pg=PA459}}</ref> For example, if\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n P &= 3x^2 - 2x + 5xy - 2 \\\\\n Q &= -3x^2 + 3x + 4y^2 + 8\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nthen\n:<math>P + Q = 3x^2 - 2x + 5xy - 2 - 3x^2 + 3x + 4y^2 + 8 </math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n:<math>P + Q = x + 5xy + 4y^2 + 6 </math>\n\nTo work out the product of two polynomials into a sum of terms, the distributive law is repeatedly applied, which results in each term of one polynomial being multiplied by every term of the other.<ref name=\"Edwards-1995-p47\"/> For example, if\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\color{Red} P &\\color{Red}{= 2x + 3y + 5} \\\\\n \\color{Blue} Q &\\color{Blue}{= 2x + 5y + xy + 1}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nthen\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rccrcrcrcr}\n{\\color{Red}{P}} {\\color{Blue}{Q}} & {{=}}&&({\\color{Red}{2x}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{2x}})\n&+&({\\color{Red}{2x}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{5y}})&+&({\\color{Red}{2x}}\\cdot {\\color{Blue}{xy}})&+&({\\color{Red}{2x}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{1}})\n\\\\&&+&({\\color{Red}{3y}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{2x}})&+&({\\color{Red}{3y}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{5y}})&+&({\\color{Red}{3y}}\\cdot {\\color{Blue}{xy}})&+&\n({\\color{Red}{3y}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{1}})\n\\\\&&+&({\\color{Red}{5}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{2x}})&+&({\\color{Red}{5}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{5y}})&+&\n({\\color{Red}{5}}\\cdot {\\color{Blue}{xy}})&+&({\\color{Red}{5}}\\cdot{\\color{Blue}{1}})\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n:<math>PQ = 4x^2 + 21xy + 2x^2y + 12x + 15y^2 + 3xy^2 + 28y + 5</math>\n\nPolynomial evaluation can be used to compute the remainder of [[Euclidean division of polynomials|polynomial division]] by a polynomial of degree one, because the remainder of the division of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} by {{math|(''x'' − ''a'')}} is {{math|''f''(''a'')}}; see the [[polynomial remainder theorem]].

The ''[[Euclidean division of polynomials]]'' that generalizes the [[Euclidean division]] of the integers. It results in two polynomials, a ''quotient'' and a ''remainder'' that are characterized by the following property of the polynomials: given two polynomials {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} such that {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, there exists a unique pair of polynomials, {{math|''q''}}, the quotient, and {{math|''r''}}, the remainder, such that {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b'' ''q'' + ''r''}} and {{math|degree(''r'') < degree(''b'')}} (here the polynomial zero is supposed to have a negative degree). By hand as well as with a computer, this division can be computed by the [[polynomial long division]] algorithm.<ref>Peter H. Selby, Steve Slavin, ''Practical Algebra: A Self-Teaching Guide, 2nd Edition'', Wiley, {{isbn|0-471-53012-3}} {{isbn|978-0-471-53012-1}}</ref>\n\nAll polynomials with coefficients in a [[unique factorization domain]] (for example, the integers or a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) also have a factored form in which the polynomial is written as a product of [[irreducible polynomial]]s and a constant. This factored form is unique up to the order of the factors and their multiplication by an invertible constant. In the case of the field of [[complex number]]s, the irreducible factors are linear. Over the [[real number]]s, they have the degree either one or two. Over the integers and the [[rational number]]s the irreducible factors may have any degree.<ref name=Barbeau-2003-pp80-82>{{cite book |last=Barbeau |first=E.J. |title=Polynomials |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-387-40627-5 |pages=80–2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CynRMm5qTmQC&pg=PA80}}</ref> For example, the factored form of\n:<math> 5x^3-5</math>\nis\n:<math>5(x - 1)\\left(x^2 + x + 1\\right)</math>\nover the integers and the reals and\n:<math> 5(x - 1)\\left(x + \\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\left(x + \\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)</math>\nover the complex numbers.\n\nThe computation of the factored form, called ''factorization'' is, in general, too difficult to be done by hand-written computation. However, efficient [[factorization of polynomials|polynomial factorization]] [[algorithm]]s are available in most [[computer algebra system]]s.\n\nA formal quotient of polynomials, that is, an [[algebraic fraction]] wherein the numerator and denominator are polynomials, is called a \"[[rational function|rational expression]]\" or \"rational fraction\" and is not, in general, a polynomial. Division of a polynomial by a number, however, yields another polynomial. For example, {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>/12}} is considered a valid term in a polynomial (and a polynomial by itself) because it is equivalent to {{math|(1/12)''x''<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|1/12}} is just a constant. When this expression is used as a term, its coefficient is therefore {{math|1/12}}. For similar reasons, if complex coefficients are allowed, one may have a single term like {{math|(2 + 3''i'') ''x''<sup>3</sup>}}; even though it looks like it should be expanded to two terms, the complex number {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is one complex number, and is the coefficient of that term. The expression {{math|1/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}} is not a polynomial because it includes division by a non-constant polynomial. The expression {{math|(5 + ''y'')<sup>''x''</sup>}} is not a polynomial, because it contains an indeterminate used as exponent.\n\nBecause subtraction can be replaced by addition of the opposite quantity, and because positive integer exponents can be replaced by repeated multiplication, all polynomials can be constructed from constants and indeterminates using only addition and multiplication.\n\n==Polynomial functions==\n<!-- \"Polynomial function\" redirects here -->\n{{See also|Ring of polynomial functions}}\n\nA ''polynomial function'' is a function that can be defined by [[#evaluation|evaluating]] a polynomial. More precisely, a function {{math|''f''}} of one [[argument of a function|argument]] from a given domain is a polynomial function if there exists a polynomial\n:<math>a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 </math>\nthat evaluates to <math>f(x)</math> for all {{mvar|x}} in the [[domain of a function|domain]] of {{mvar|f}} (here, {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative integer and {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>''}} are constant coefficients).\n\nGenerally, unless otherwise specified, polynomial functions have [[complex number|complex]] coefficients, arguments, and values. In particular, a polynomial, restricted to have real coefficients, defines a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers. If the domain of this function is also [[restriction of a function|restricted]] to the reals, the resulting function maps reals to reals.\n\nFor example, the function {{math|''f''}}, defined by\n:<math> f(x) = x^3 - x,</math>\nis a polynomial function of one variable. Polynomial functions of several variables are similarly defined, using polynomials in more than one indeterminate, as in\n:<math>f(x,y)= 2x^3+4x^2y+xy^5+y^2-7.</math>\n\nAccording to the definition of polynomial functions, there may be expressions that obviously are not polynomials but nevertheless define polynomial functions. An example is the expression <math>\\left(\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\right)^2,</math> which takes the same values as the polynomial <math>1-x^2</math> on the interval <math>[-1,1]</math>, and thus both expressions define the same polynomial function on this interval.\n\nEvery polynomial function is [[continuous function|continuous]], [[smooth function|smooth]], and [[entire function|entire]].\n\n===Graphs===\n<div class=\"floatright\">\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Polynomialdeg2.svg|Polynomial of degree 2:<br/><small>{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' − 2}}<br/>{{math|{{=}} (''x'' + 1)(''x'' − 2)}}</small>\nFile:Polynomialdeg3.svg|Polynomial of degree 3:<br/><small>{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup>/4 + 3''x''<sup>2</sup>/4 − 3''x''/2 − 2}}<br/>{{math|{{=}} 1/4 (''x'' + 4)(''x'' + 1)(''x'' − 2)}}</small>\nFile:Polynomialdeg4.svg|Polynomial of degree 4:<br/><small>{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 1/14 (''x'' + 4)(''x'' + 1)(''x'' − 1)(''x'' − 3) <br/>+ 0.5}}</small>\nFile:quintic polynomial.svg|Polynomial of degree 5:<br/><small>{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 1/20 (''x'' + 4)(''x'' + 2)(''x'' + 1 )(''x'' − 1)<br/>(''x'' − 3)}}{{math|+ 2}}</small>\nFile:Sextic Graph.svg|Polynomial of degree 6:<br/><small>{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 1/100 (''x''<sup>6</sup> − 2''x'' <sup>5</sup> − 26''x''<sup>4</sup> + 28''x''<sup>3</sup>}}<br/>{{math|+ 145''x''<sup>2</sup> - 26''x'' - 80)}}</small>\nFile:Septic graph.svg|Polynomial of degree 7:<br/><small>{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} (''x'' − 3)(''x'' − 2)(''x'' − 1)(''x'')(''x'' + 1)(''x'' + 2)}}<br/>{{math|(''x'' + 3)}}</small>\n</gallery>\n</div>\nA polynomial function in one real variable can be represented by a [[graph of a function|graph]].\n*The graph of the zero polynomial\n::{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}}\n:is the {{math|''x''}}-axis.\n\n*The graph of a degree 0 polynomial\n::{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub>}}, where {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub> ≠ 0}},\n:is a horizontal line with {{math|''y''-intercept ''a''<sub>0</sub>}}\n\n*The graph of a degree 1 polynomial (or linear function)\n::{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x''}} , where {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub> ≠ 0}},\n:is an oblique line with {{math|''y''-intercept ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} and [[slope]] {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>}}.\n\n*The graph of a degree 2 polynomial\n::{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''<sub>2</sub> ≠ 0}}\n:is a [[parabola]].\n\n*The graph of a degree 3 polynomial\n::{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''<sub>3</sub>''x''<sup>3</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''<sub>3</sub> ≠ 0}}\n:is a [[cubic equation|cubic curve]].\n\n*The graph of any polynomial with degree 2 or greater\n::{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sup>2</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}} , where {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub> ≠ 0 and ''n'' ≥ 2}}\n:is a continuous non-linear curve.\n\nA non-constant polynomial function [[infinity#Calculus|tends to infinity]] when the variable increases indefinitely (in [[absolute value]]).

There are also formulas for the [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quartic equations]]. For higher degrees, the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] asserts that there can not exist a general formula in radicals. However, [[root-finding algorithm]]s may be used to find [[numerical approximation]]s of the roots of a polynomial expression of any degree.\n\nThe number of real solutions of a polynomial equation with real coefficients may not exceed the degree, and equals the degree when the [[complex number|complex]] solutions are counted with their [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]].

The solutions of this equation are called the ''roots'' of the polynomial, or the zeros of the associated function (they correspond to the points where the graph of the function meets the {{math|''x''}}-axis).\n\nA number {{math|''a''}} is a root of a polynomial {{math|''P''}} if and only if the [[#linear polynomial|linear polynomial]] {{math|''x'' − ''a''}} divides {{math|''P''}}, that is if there is another polynomial {{math|''Q''}} such that {{math|1=''P'' = (''x'' – ''a'') Q}}. It may happen that {{math|''x'' − ''a''}} divides {{math|''P''}} more than once: if {{math|(''x'' − ''a'')<sup>2</sup>}} divides {{math|''P''}} then {{math|''a''}} is called a ''multiple root'' of {{math|''P''}}, and otherwise {{math|''a''}} is called a ''simple root'' of {{math|''P''}}. If {{math|''P''}} is a nonzero polynomial, there is a highest power {{math|''m''}} such that {{math|(''x'' − ''a'')<sup>''m''</sup>}} divides {{math|''P''}}, which is called the ''multiplicity'' of the root {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''P''}}. When {{math|''P''}} is the zero polynomial, the corresponding polynomial equation is trivial, and this case is usually excluded when considering roots, as, with the above definitions, every number is a root of the zero polynomial, with an undefined multiplicity. With this exception made, the number of roots of {{math|''P''}}, even counted with their respective multiplicities, cannot exceed the degree of {{math|''P''}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leung, |first=Kam-tim |title=Polynomials and Equations |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |year=1992 |isbn=9789622092716 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=v5uXkwIUbC8C&pg=PA134|display-authors=etal}}</ref> \nThe relation between the coefficients of a polynomial and its roots is described by [[Vieta's formulas]].\n\nSome polynomials, such as {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}, do not have any roots among the [[real number]]s.

By successively dividing out factors {{math|''x'' − ''a''}}, one sees that any polynomial with complex coefficients can be written as a constant (its leading coefficient) times a product of such polynomial factors of degree&nbsp;1; as a consequence, the number of (complex) roots counted with their multiplicities is exactly equal to the degree of the polynomial.\n\nThere may be several meanings of \"solving an equation\". One may want to express the solutions as explicit numbers; for example, the unique solution of {{math|1=2''x'' – 1 = 0}} is {{math|1/2}}. Unfortunately, this is, in general, impossible for equations of degree greater than one, and, since the ancient times, mathematicians have searched to express the solutions as [[algebraic expression]]; for example the [[golden ratio]] <math>(1+\\sqrt 5)/2</math> is the unique positive solution of <math>x^2-x-1=0.</math> In the ancient times, they succeeded only for degrees one and two. For [[quadratic equation]]s, the [[quadratic formula]] provides such expressions of the solutions. Since the 16th century, similar formulas (using cube roots in addition to square roots), but much more complicated are known for equations of degree three and four (see [[cubic equation]] and [[quartic equation]]). But formulas for degree 5 and higher eluded researchers for several centuries. In 1824, [[Niels Henrik Abel]] proved the striking result that there are equations of degree 5 whose solutions cannot be expressed by a (finite) formula, involving only arithmetic operations and radicals (see [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). In 1830, [[Évariste Galois]] proved that most equations of degree higher than four cannot be solved by radicals, and showed that for each equation, one may decide whether it is solvable by radicals, and, if it is, solve it. This result marked the start of [[Galois theory]] and [[group theory]], two important branches of modern [[algebra]]. Galois himself noted that the computations implied by his method were impracticable. Nevertheless, formulas for solvable equations of degrees 5 and 6 have been published (see [[quintic function]] and [[sextic equation]]).\n\nWhen there is no algebraic expression for the roots, and when such an algebraic expression exists but is too complicated to be useful, the unique way of solving is to compute [[numerical approximation]]s of the solutions.<ref>{{cite book |last=McNamee |first=J.M. |title=Numerical Methods for Roots of Polynomials, Part 1 |publisher=Elsevier |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-08-048947-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4PMqxwG-eqQC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> There are many methods for that; some are restricted to polynomials and others may apply to any [[continuous function]]. The most efficient [[algorithm]]s allow solving easily (on a [[computer]]) polynomial equations of degree higher than 1,000 (see [[Root-finding algorithm]]).\n\nFor polynomials in more than one indeterminate, the combinations of values for the variables for which the polynomial function takes the value zero are generally called ''zeros'' instead of \"roots\". The study of the sets of zeros of polynomials is the object of [[algebraic geometry]]. For a set of polynomial equations in several unknowns, there are [[algorithm]]s to decide whether they have a finite number of [[complex number|complex]] solutions, and, if this number is finite, for computing the solutions. See [[System of polynomial equations]].\n\nThe special case where all the polynomials are of degree one is called a [[system of linear equations]], for which another range of different [[system of linear equations#Solving a linear system|solution methods]] exist, including the classical [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nA polynomial equation for which one is interested only in the solutions which are [[integer]]s is called a [[Diophantine equation]]. Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general [[algorithm]] for solving them, and even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see [[Hilbert's tenth problem]]). Some of the most famous problems that have been solved during the fifty last years are related to Diophantine equations, such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{anchor|Generalizations of polynomials}}<!-- [[Polynomial expression]] redirects to this section -->\nThere are several generalizations of the concept of polynomials.\n\n===Trigonometric polynomials===\n{{main|Trigonometric polynomial}}\nA '''trigonometric polynomial''' is a finite [[linear combination]] of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] sin(''nx'') and cos(''nx'') with ''n'' taking on the values of one or more [[natural number]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Michael J. D. |author1-link=Michael J. D. Powell |title=Approximation Theory and Methods |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-29514-7 |year=1981}}</ref> The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions.\n\nIf sin(''nx'') and cos(''nx'') are expanded in terms of sin(''x'') and cos(''x''), a trigonometric polynomial becomes a polynomial in the two variables sin(''x'') and cos(''x'') (using [[List of trigonometric identities#Multiple-angle formulae]]). Conversely, every polynomial in sin(''x'') and cos(''x'') may be converted, with [[List of trigonometric identities#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|Product-to-sum identities]], into a linear combination of functions sin(''nx'') and cos(''nx''). This equivalence explains why linear combinations are called polynomials.\n\nFor [[complex number|complex coefficients]], there is no difference between such a function and a finite [[Fourier series]].\n\nTrigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in [[trigonometric interpolation]] applied to the [[interpolation]] of [[periodic function]]s. They are used also in the [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\n===Matrix polynomials===\n{{main|Matrix polynomial}}\nA [[matrix polynomial]] is a polynomial with [[square matrix|square matrices]] as variables.<ref>{{cite book |title=Matrix Polynomials |volume=58 |series=Classics in Applied Mathematics |first1=Israel |last1=Gohberg |first2=Peter |last2=Lancaster |first3=Leiba |last3=Rodman |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |location=Lancaster, PA |year=2009 |origyear=1982 |isbn=0-89871-681-0 |zbl=1170.15300}}</ref> Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial\n:<math>P(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n{ a_i x^i} =a_0 + a_1 x+ a_2 x^2 + \\cdots + a_n x^n, </math>\nthis polynomial evaluated at a matrix ''A'' is\n:<math>P(A) = \\sum_{i=0}^n{ a_i A^i} =a_0 I + a_1 A + a_2 A^2 + \\cdots + a_n A^n,</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]].{{sfn|Horn|Johnson|1990|p=36}}\n\nA '''matrix polynomial equation''' is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question. A '''matrix polynomial identity''' is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices ''A'' in a specified [[matrix ring]] ''M<sub>n</sub>''(''R'').\n\n===Laurent polynomials===\n{{main|Laurent polynomial}}\n[[Laurent polynomial]]s are like polynomials, but allow negative powers of the variable(s) to occur.\n\n===Rational functions===\n{{main|Rational function}}\nA [[rational fraction]] is the [[quotient]] ([[algebraic fraction]]) of two polynomials. Any [[algebraic expression]] that can be rewritten as a rational fraction is a [[rational function]].\n\nWhile polynomial functions are defined for all values of the variables, a rational function is defined only for the values of the variables for which the denominator is not zero.\n\nThe rational fractions include the Laurent polynomials, but do not limit denominators to powers of an indeterminate.\n\n===Power series===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n[[Formal power series]] are like polynomials, but allow infinitely many non-zero terms to occur, so that they do not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like [[irrational number]]s cannot), but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same as for polynomials. Non-formal [[power series]] also generalize polynomials, but the multiplication of two power series may not converge.\n\n===Other examples===\n*A bivariate polynomial where the second variable is substituted by an exponential function applied to the first variable, for example {{math|''P''(''x'', ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>)}}, may be called an [[exponential polynomial]].\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Calculus===\n{{Main|Calculus with polynomials}}\n{{See also|Polynomial interpolation}}\nThe simple structure of polynomial functions makes them quite useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in [[calculus]] is [[Taylor's theorem]], which roughly states that every [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] function locally looks like a polynomial function, and the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]], which states that every [[continuous function]] defined on a [[compact space|compact]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial function.\n\nCalculating derivatives and integrals of polynomial functions is particularly simple. For the polynomial function\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i</math>\nthe derivative with respect to ''x'' is\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i i x^{i-1}</math>\nand the indefinite integral is\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^n {a_i\\over i+1} x^{i+1}+c.</math>\n\n===Abstract algebra===\n{{Main|Polynomial ring}}\nIn [[abstract algebra]], one distinguishes between ''polynomials'' and ''polynomial functions''. A ''polynomial'' {{math|''f''}} in one indeterminate {{math|''x''}} over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] {{math|''R''}} is defined as a formal expression of the form\n:<math>f = a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \\cdots + a_1 x^1 + a_0x^0</math>\nwhere {{math|''n''}} is a natural number, the coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, . . ., ''a<sub>n</sub>''}} are elements of {{math|''R''}}, and {{math|''x''}} is a formal symbol, whose powers {{math|''x<sup>i</sup>''}} are just placeholders for the corresponding coefficients {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}}, so that the given formal expression is just a way to encode the sequence {{math|(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, . . .)}}, where there is an {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} 0}} for all {{math|''i'' > ''n''}}. Two polynomials sharing the same value of ''n'' are considered equal if and only if the sequences of their coefficients are equal; furthermore any polynomial is equal to any polynomial with greater value of {{math|''n''}} obtained from it by adding terms in front whose coefficient is zero. These polynomials can be added by simply adding corresponding coefficients (the rule for extending by terms with zero coefficients can be used to make sure such coefficients exist). Thus each polynomial is actually equal to the sum of the terms used in its formal expression, if such a term {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>x<sup>i</sup>''}} is interpreted as a polynomial that has zero coefficients at all powers of {{math|''x''}} other than {{math|''x<sup>i</sup>''}}. Then to define multiplication, it suffices by the [[distributive law]] to describe the product of any two such terms, which is given by the rule\n\n:<div style=\"vertical-align:30%;display:inline\"><math>a x^k \\; b x^l = ab x^{k+l}</math></div>{{nbsp|2}} for all elements ''a'', ''b'' of the ring ''R'' and all [[natural numbers]] ''k'' and ''l''.\n\nThus the set of all polynomials with coefficients in the ring {{math|''R''}} forms itself a ring, the ''ring of polynomials'' over {{math|''R''}}, which is denoted by {{math|''R''[''x'']}}. The map from {{math|''R''}} to {{math|''R''[''x'']}} sending {{math|''r''}} to {{math|''rx''<sup>0</sup>}} is an injective homomorphism of rings, by which {{math|''R''}} is viewed as a subring of {{math|''R''[''x'']}}. If {{math|''R''}} is [[commutative ring|commutative]], then {{math|''R''[''x'']}} is an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] over {{math|''R''}}.\n\nOne can think of the ring {{math|''R''[''x'']}} as arising from {{math|''R''}} by adding one new element ''x'' to ''R'', and extending in a minimal way to a ring in which {{math|''x''}} satisfies no other relations than the obligatory ones, plus commutation with all elements of {{math|''R''}} (that is {{math|''xr'' {{=}} ''rx''}}). To do this, one must add all powers of {{math|''x''}} and their linear combinations as well.\n\nFormation of the polynomial ring, together with forming factor rings by factoring out [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], are important tools for constructing new rings out of known ones. For instance, the ring (in fact field) of complex numbers, which can be constructed from the polynomial ring {{math|''R''[''x'']}} over the real numbers by factoring out the ideal of multiples of the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Another example is the construction of [[finite field]]s, which proceeds similarly, starting out with the field of integers modulo some [[prime number]] as the coefficient ring {{math|''R''}} (see [[modular arithmetic]]).\n\nIf {{math|''R''}} is commutative, then one can associate to every polynomial {{math|''P''}} in {{math|''R''[''x'']}}, a ''polynomial function'' {{math|''f''}} with domain and range equal to {{math|''R''}} (more generally one can take domain and range to be the same [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] over {{math|''R''}}). One obtains the value {{math|''f''(''r'')}} by [[substitution (algebra)|substitution]] of the value {{math|''r''}} for the symbol {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''P''}}. One reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that over some rings different polynomials may give rise to the same polynomial function (see [[Fermat's little theorem]] for an example where {{math|''R''}} is the integers modulo {{math|''p''}}). This is not the case when {{math|''R''}} is the real or complex numbers, whence the two concepts are not always distinguished in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]]. An even more important reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that many operations on polynomials (like [[Euclidean division]]) require looking at what a polynomial is composed of as an expression rather than evaluating it at some constant value for {{math|''x''}}.\n\n====Divisibility====\n{{Main|Polynomial greatest common divisor|Factorization of polynomials}}\nIn [[commutative algebra]], one major focus of study is ''divisibility'' among polynomials. If {{math|''R''}} is an [[integral domain]] and {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are polynomials in {{math|''R''[''x'']}}, it is said that {{math|''f''}} ''divides'' {{math|''g''}} or {{math|''f''}} is a divisor of {{math|''g''}} if there exists a polynomial {{math|''q''}} in {{math|''R''[''x'']}} such that {{math|''f'' ''q'' {{=}} ''g''}}. One can show that every zero gives rise to a linear divisor, or more formally, if {{math|''f''}} is a polynomial in {{math|''R''[''x'']}} and {{math|''r''}} is an element of {{math|''R''}} such that {{math|''f''(''r'') {{=}} 0}}, then the polynomial ({{math|''x'' − ''r''}}) divides {{math|''f''}}. The converse is also true. The quotient can be computed using the [[polynomial long division]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Irving |first=Ronald S. |title=Integers, Polynomials, and Rings: A Course in Algebra |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20172-6 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B4k6ltaxm5YC&pg=PA129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Terrence H. |title=From Polynomials to Sums of Squares |publisher=CRC Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-7503-0329-3 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LCEOri2-doMC&pg=PA143}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are polynomials in {{math|''F''[''x'']}} with {{math|''g'' ≠ 0}}, then there exist unique polynomials {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} in {{math|''F''[''x'']}} with\n:<math> f = q \\, g + r </math>\nand such that the degree of {{math|''r''}} is smaller than the degree of {{math|''g''}} (using the convention that the polynomial 0 has a negative degree). The polynomials {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}}. This is called ''[[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]], division with remainder'' or ''polynomial long division'' and shows that the ring {{math|''F''[''x'']}} is a [[Euclidean domain]].\n\nAnalogously, ''prime polynomials'' (more correctly, ''[[irreducible polynomial]]s'') can be defined as ''non-zero polynomials which cannot be factorized into the product of two non-constant polynomials''. In the case of coefficients in a ring, ''\"non-constant\"'' must be replaced by ''\"non-constant or non-[[unit (ring theory)|unit]]\"'' (both definitions agree in the case of coefficients in a field). Any polynomial may be decomposed into the product of an invertible constant by a product of irreducible polynomials. If the coefficients belong to a field or a [[unique factorization domain]] this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors and the multiplication of any non-unit factor by a unit (and division of the unit factor by the same unit). When the coefficients belong to integers, rational numbers or a finite field, there are algorithms to test irreducibility and to compute the factorization into irreducible polynomials (see [[Factorization of polynomials]]). These algorithms are not practicable for hand-written computation, but are available in any [[computer algebra system]]. [[Eisenstein's criterion]] can also be used in some cases to determine irreducibility.\n\n===Positional notation===\n{{main|Positional notation}}\nIn modern positional numbers systems, such as the [[Decimal|decimal system]], the digits and their positions in the representation of an integer, for example, 45, are a shorthand notation for a polynomial in the [[radix]] or base, in this case, {{nowrap|4 × 10<sup>1</sup> + 5 × 10<sup>0</sup>}}. As another example, in radix 5, a string of digits such as 132 denotes the (decimal) number {{nowrap|1 × 5<sup>2</sup> + 3 × 5<sup>1</sup> + 2 × 5<sup>0</sup>}} = 42. This representation is unique.  Let ''b'' be a positive integer greater than 1.  Then every positive integer ''a'' can be expressed uniquely in the form\n\n:<math>a = r_m b^m + r_{m-1} b^{m-1} + \\dotsb + r_1 b + r_0,</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is a nonnegative integer and the ''r'''s are integers such that\n\n:{{math|0 < ''r''<sub>''m''</sub> < ''b''}} and {{math|0 ≤ ''r''<sub>''i''</sub> < ''b''}} for {{math|1=''i'' = 0, 1, . . . , ''m'' − 1}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=75}}</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\n{{see also|Orthogonal polynomials|B-spline|spline interpolation}}\nPolynomials serve to approximate other [[function (mathematics)|functions]],<ref>{{cite book |last=de Villiers |first=Johann |title=Mathematics of Approximation |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=9789491216503 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l5mIro_6RlUC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> such as the use of [[spline (mathematics)|splines]].\n\nPolynomials are frequently used to encode information about some other object. The [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator's [[eigenvalue]]s. The [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of an [[algebraic element]] records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied by that element. The [[chromatic polynomial]] of a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] counts the number of proper colourings of that graph.\n\nThe term \"polynomial\", as an adjective, can also be used for quantities or functions that can be written in polynomial form. For example, in [[computational complexity theory]] the phrase ''[[polynomial time]]'' means that the time it takes to complete an [[algorithm]] is bounded by a polynomial function of some variable, such as the size of the input.\n\nIn [[computer graphics]] they are used to interpolate between values to evaluate animation of dynamic graphical objects.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Cubic function#History|Quartic function#History|Abel–Ruffini theorem#History}}\nDetermining the roots of polynomials, or \"solving algebraic equations\", is among the oldest problems in mathematics. However, the elegant and practical notation we use today only developed beginning in the 15th century. Before that, equations were written out in words. For example, an algebra problem from the Chinese [[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art|Arithmetic in Nine Sections]], circa 200 BCE, begins \"Three sheafs of good crop, two sheafs of mediocre crop, and one sheaf of bad crop are sold for 29 dou.\" We would write {{math|3''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z'' {{=}}&nbsp;29}}.\n\n===History of the notation===\n{{Main|History of mathematical notation}}\nThe earliest known use of the equal sign is in [[Robert Recorde]]'s ''[[The Whetstone of Witte]]'', 1557. The signs + for addition, − for subtraction, and the use of a letter for an unknown appear in [[Michael Stifel]]'s ''Arithemetica integra'', 1544. [[René Descartes]], in ''La géometrie'', 1637, introduced the concept of the graph of a polynomial equation. He popularized the use of letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote constants and letters from the end of the alphabet to denote variables, as can be seen above, in the general formula for a polynomial in one variable, where the {{math|''a''}}'s denote constants and {{math|''x''}} denotes a variable. Descartes introduced the use of superscripts to denote exponents as well.<ref>Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Sixth Edition, Saunders, {{isbn|0-03-029558-0}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lill's method]]\n*[[List of polynomial topics]]\n*[[Polynomials on vector spaces]]\n*[[Power series]]\n*[[Template:Mathematical expressions|Table of mathematical expressions]]\n*[[Polynomial transformations]]\n*[[Polynomial mapping]]\n*[[Polynomial functor]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- *{{cite book |title= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |url=}} -->\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Barbeau |first=E.J. |title=Polynomials |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-387-40627-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CynRMm5qTmQC&printsec=frontcover}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bronstein |editor-first=Manuel |title=Solving Polynomial Equations: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-27357-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aIlSmBV3yf8C&printsec=frontcover|display-editors=etal}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cahen |first1=Paul-Jean |last2=Chabert |first2=Jean-Luc |title=Integer-Valued Polynomials |publisher=American Mathematical Society |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8218-0388-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AlAluH5is6AC&printsec=frontcover}}\n*{{Lang Algebra}}.

      "text": "'''Polynomial arithmetic''' is a branch of [[algebra]] dealing with some properties of [[Polynomial|polynomials]] which share strong analogies with properties of [[number theory]] relative to integers.\nIt includes basic mathematical operations such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]], as well as more elaborate operations like [[Euclidean division]], and properties related to roots of polynomials. The latter are essentially connected to the fact that the set ''K''[''X''] of [[univariate]] polynomials with coefficients in a [[Field_(mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is a [[commutative ring]], such as the ring of integers <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\n==Elementary operations on polynomials==\nAddition and subtraction of two polynomials are performed by adding or subtracting corresponding [[coefficients]]. If\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i; g(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^m b_ix^i</math>\n\nthen addition is defined as\n\n: <math>f(x)+g(x)= \\sum_{i=0}^m (a_i+b_i)x^i </math>  where m > n\n\nMultiplication is performed much the same way as addition and subtraction, but instead by multiplying the corresponding coefficients. If <math>f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i; g(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^m b_ix^i</math> then multiplication is defined as <math>f(x)\\times g(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{n+m} c_ix^i</math> where <math>c_k=a_0b_k+a_1b_{k-1}+\\cdots+a_{k-1}b_1+a_kb_0</math>. Note that we treat <math>a_i</math> as zero for <math>i>n</math> and that the degree of the product is equal to the [[summation|sum]] of the degrees of the two polynomials.\n\n==Advanced polynomial arithmetics and comparison with number theory==\nMany fascinating properties of polynomials can be found when, thanks to the basic operations that can be performed on two polynomials and the underlying [[commutative ring]] structure of the set they live in, one tries to apply reasonings similar to those known from number theory.\n\nTo see this, one first needs to introduce two concepts: the notion of [[Polynomial_roots|root]] of a polynomial and that of [[Divisibility_(ring_theory)|divisibility]] for pairs of polynomials. \n\nIf one considers a polynomial <math>P</math> of a single variable ''X'' in a field ''K'' (typically <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>), and with coefficients in that field, a root <math>r</math> of <math>P</math> is an element of ''K'' such that\n\n: <math>P(r)=0</math>\n\nThe second concept, divisibility of polynomials, allows to see a first analogy with number theory: a polynomial <math>B</math> is said to divide another polynomial <math>A</math> when the latter can be written as\n\n: <math>A = BC </math>\n\nwith C being ALSO a polynomial. This definition is similar to divisibility for integers, and the fact that <math>B</math> divides <math>A</math> is also denoted <math>B|A</math>.\n\nThe relation between both concepts above arises when noticing the following property: <math>r</math> is a root of <math>P</math> if and only if <math>(X-r)|P</math>. Whereas one logical inclusion (\"if\") is obvious, the other (\"only if\") relies on a more elaborate concept, the [[Polynomial_long_division#Euclidean_division|Euclidean division of polynomials]], here again strongly reminding of the [[Euclidean division]] of integers.\n\nFrom this it follows that one can define [[Prime_polynomial|prime polynomials]], as polynomials that cannot be divided by any other polynomials but 1 and themselves (up to an overall constant factor) - here again the analogously with prime integers is manifest, and allows that some of the main definitions and theorems related to prime numbers and number theory have their counterpart in polynomial algebra. The most important result is the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], allowing for factorization of any polynomial as a product of prime ones. Worth mentioning is also the [[Bézout's_identity#B.C3.A9zout.27s_identity_for_polynomials|Bézout's identity]] in the context of polynomials. It states that two given polynomials P and Q have as [[Polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor (GCD)]] a third polynomial D (D is then unique as GCD of P and Q up to a finite constant factor), if and only if there exists polynomials U and V such that\n: <math> UP+VQ = D </math>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Polynomial long division]]\n* [[Polynomial greatest common divisor]]\n\n==References==\n* Stallings, William; : \"Cryptography And Network Security: Principles and Practice\", pages 121-126.

      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=May 2014}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''polynomial transformation''' consists of computing the polynomial whose [[root of a polynomial|roots]] are a given function of the roots of polynomial. Polynomial transformations such as [[Tschirnhaus transformation]]s are often used to simplify the solution of [[algebraic equation]]s.\n\n==Simple examples==\n\n===Translating the roots===\nLet \n:<math> P(x) = a_0x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n} </math>\nbe a polynomial, and \n:<math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n</math> \nbe its complex roots (not necessarily distinct).\n\nFor any constant {{math|''c''}}, the polynomial whose roots are \n:<math>\\alpha_1+c, \\ldots, \\alpha_n+c</math> \nis \n:<math>Q(y) = P(y-c)= a_0(y-c)^n + a_1 (y-c)^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n}. </math>\n\nIf the coefficients of {{math|''P''}} are [[integer]]s and the constant <math>c=\\frac{p}{q}</math> is a [[rational number]], the coefficients of {{math|''Q''}} may be not integer, but the polynomial {{math|''c''<sup>''n''</sup> ''Q''}} has integers coefficients and has the same roots as {{math|''Q''}}.\n\nA special case is when <math>c=\\frac{a_1}{a_0}.</math> The resulting polynomial {{math|''Q''}} does not have any term in {{math|''y''<sup>''n'' &minus; 1</sup>}}.\n\n===Reciprocals of the roots===\nLet \n:<math> P(x) = a_0x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n} </math>\nbe a polynomial. The polynomial whose roots are the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of the roots of {{math|''P''}} as roots is its [[reciprocal polynomial]]\n:<math> Q(y)= y^nP\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)= a_ny^n + a_{n-1} y^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{0}.</math>\n\n===Scaling the roots===\n\nLet \n:<math> P(x) = a_0x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n} </math>\nbe a polynomial, and {{math|''c''}} be a non-zero constant. A polynomial whose roots are the product by {{math|''c''}} of the roots of {{math|''P''}} is \n:<math>Q(y)=c^nP\\left(\\frac{y}{c} \\right) = a_0y^n + a_1 cy^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n}c^n. </math>\nThe factor {{math|''c''<sup>''n''</sup>}} appears here because, if {{math|''c''}} and the coefficients of {{math|''P''}} are integers or belong to some [[integral domain]], the same is true for the coefficients of {{math|''Q''}}.\n\nIn the special case where <math>c=a_0</math>, all coefficients of {{math|''Q''}} are multiple of {{math|''c''}}, and <math> \\frac{Q}{c}</math> is a [[monic polynomial]], whose coefficients belong to any integral domain containing {{math|''c''}} and the coefficients of {{math|''P''}}. This polynomial transformation is often used to reduce questions on [[algebraic number]]s to questions on [[algebraic integer]]s.\n\nCombining this with a [[#Translating the roots|translation of the roots]] by <math>\\frac{a_1}{a_0}</math>, allows to reduce any question on the roots of a polynomial, such as [[root-finding]], to a similar question on a simpler polynomial, which is monic and does not have a term of degree {{math|''n'' &minus; 1}}. For examples of this, see [[cubic function#Reduction to a depressed cubic|Cubic function § Reduction to a depressed cubic]] or [[Quartic function#Converting to a depressed quartic|Quartic function § Converting to a depressed quartic]].\n\n==Transformation by a rational function==\nAll preceding examples are polynomial transformations by a [[rational function]], also called [[Tschirnhaus transformation]]s. Let \n:<math>f(x)=\\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}</math>\nbe a rational function, where {{math|''g''}} and {{math|''h''}} are [[coprime]] polynomials. The polynomial transformation of a polynomial {{math|''P''}} by {{math|''f''}} is the polynomial {{math|''Q''}} (defined [[up to]] the product by a non-zero constant) whose roots are the images by {{math|''f''}} of the roots of {{math|''P''}}.\n\nSuch a polynomial transformation may be computed as a [[resultant]]. In fact, the roots of the desired polynomial {{math|''Q''}} are exactly the [[complex number]]s {{math|''y''}} such that there is a complex number {{math|''x''}} such one has simultaneously (if the coefficients of {{math|''P'', ''g''}} and {{math|''h''}} are not real or complex numbers, ''\"complex number\"'' has to be replaced by ''\"element of an [[algebraically closed field]] containing the coefficients of the input polynomials\"'')\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP(x)&=0\\\\\ny\\,h(x)-g(x)&=0\\,.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThis is exactly the defining property of the resultant\n:<math>\\operatorname{Res}_x(y\\,h(x)-g(x),P(x))</math>\n\nThis is generally difficult to compute this through a hand-written computation. However, as most [[computer algebra system]]s have a built-in function to compute resultants, it is straightforward to compute it with a [[computer]].\n\n===Properties===\nIf the polynomial {{math|''P''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]], then either the resulting polynomial {{math|''Q''}} is irreducible, or it is a power of an irreducible polynomial. Let <math>\\alpha</math> be a root of {{math|''P''}} and consider {{math|''L''}}, the [[field extension]] generated by <math>\\alpha</math>. The former case means that <math>f(\\alpha)</math> is a [[simple extension|primitive element]] of {{math|''L''}}, which has {{math|''Q''}} as [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. In the latter case, <math>f(\\alpha)</math> belongs to a subfield of {{math|''L''}} and its minimal polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that has {{math|''Q''}} as power.\n\n==Transformation for equation-solving==\n\nPolynomial transformations have been applied to the simplification of polynomial equations for solution, where possible, by radicals.  Descartes introduced the transformation of a polynomial of degree ''d'' which eliminates the term of degree ''d''−1 by a translation of the roots.  Such a polynomial is termed '''depressed'''. this already suffices to solve the quadratic by square roots.   In the case of the cubic, Tschirnhaus transformations replace the variable by a quadratic function, thereby making it possible to eliminate two terms, and so can be used to eliminate the linear term in a depressed cubic to achieve the solution of the cubic by a combination of square and cube roots.  The Bring–Jerrard transformation, which is quartic in the variable, brings a quintic into \"principal\" or [[Bring-Jerrard normal form]] with terms of degree 5,1 and zero.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | last1=Adamchik | first1=Victor S. | last2=Jeffrey | first2=David J. | title=Polynomial transformations of Tschirnhaus, Bring and Jerrard | zbl=1055.65063 | journal=SIGSAM Bull. | volume=37 | number=3 | pages=90–94 | year=2003 | url=http://www.sigsam.org/bulletin/articles/145/Adamchik.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035637/http://www.sigsam.org/bulletin/articles/145/Adamchik.pdf | archivedate=2009-02-26 | df= }}\n\n[[Category:Algebra]]"

This fact, which is the motivation for the notation {{math|2<sup>''S''</sup>}}, may be demonstrated simply as follows,\n: First, order the elements of {{mvar|S}} in any manner. We write any subset of {{mvar|''S''}} in the format {{math|{γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub>, ..., γ<sub>''n''</sub> }}} where {{math|γ<sub>i</sub> , 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}, can take the value of {{math|0}} or {{math|1}}. If {{math|1=γ<sub>''i''</sub> = 1}}, the {{mvar|i}}-th element of {{mvar|''S''}} is in the subset; otherwise, the {{mvar|i}}-th element is not in the subset. Clearly the number of distinct subsets that can be constructed this way is {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}} as {{math|γ<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ {0, 1} }}.\n\n[[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that the power set of a set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself (informally the power set must be larger than the original set). In particular, [[Cantor's theorem]] shows that the power set of a [[countable set|countably infinite]] set is [[uncountable|uncountably]] infinite. The power set of the set of [[natural number]]s can be put in a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cardinality of the continuum]]).\n\nThe power set of a set {{mvar|''S''}}, together with the operations of [[union (set theory)|union]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] can be viewed as the prototypical example of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. In fact, one can show that any ''finite'' Boolean algebra is [[isomorphic]] to the Boolean algebra of the power set of a finite set. For ''infinite'' Boolean algebras this is no longer true, but every infinite Boolean algebra can be represented as a [[subalgebra]] of a power set Boolean algebra (see [[Stone's representation theorem]]).\n\nThe power set of a set {{mvar|''S''}} forms an [[abelian group]] when considered with the operation of [[symmetric difference]] (with the empty set as the identity element and each set being its own inverse) and a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] when considered with the operation of intersection. It can hence be shown (by proving the [[Distributive property|distributive laws]]) that the power set considered together with both of these operations forms a [[Boolean ring]].\n\n==Representing subsets as functions== <!-- this section is referenced forme some other place in this article, do not change its title carelessly -->\nIn set theory, [[Function (mathematics)#Function space|{{math|''X''<sup>''Y''</sup>}}]] is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from {{mvar|Y}} to {{mvar|X}}.  As \"2\" can be defined as {{math|{{mset|0,1}}}} (see [[Natural number#A standard construction|natural number]]), {{math|2<sup>''S''</sup>}} (i.e., {{math|{{mset|0,1}}<sup>''S''</sup>}}) is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from {{mvar|''S''}} to {0,1}.  By identifying a function in {{math|2<sup>''S''</sup>}} with the corresponding [[preimage]] of {{math|1}}, we see that there is a [[bijection]] between {{math|2<sup>''S''</sup>}} and {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}), where each function is the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset in {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) with which it is identified.  Hence {{math|2<sup>''S''</sup>}} and {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) could be considered identical set-theoretically.  (Thus there are two distinct [[set notation#Metaphor in denoting sets|notational motivations]] for denoting the power set by {{math|2<sup>''S''</sup>}}:  the fact that this function-representation of subsets makes it a special case of the {{math|''X''<sup>''Y''</sup>}} notation and the property, [[power set#Properties|mentioned above]], that {{math|1={{abs|2<sup>''S''</sup>}} = 2<sup>{{abs|''S''}}</sup>}}.)\n\nThis notion can be applied to the example [[Power set#Example|above]] in which {{math|1=''S'' = {{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}} to see the isomorphism with the binary numbers\nfrom 0 to {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1}} with {{mvar|n}} being the number of elements in the set.\nIn {{mvar|''S''}}, a \"1\" in the position corresponding to the location in the enumerated set {{math|1={{mset| (''x'', 0), (''y'', 1), (''z'', 2) }}}} indicates the presence of the element. So {{math|1={{mset|''x'', ''y''}} = 011<sub>(2)</sub>}}.\n\nFor the whole power set of {{mvar|''S''}} we get:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Subset\n!scope=\"col\"| Sequence<br /> of digits\n!scope=\"col\"| Binary<br /> interpretation\n!scope=\"col\"| Decimal<br /> equivalent\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset|                     }} }} || {{math|0, 0, 0}} || {{math|000<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|0<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset| ''x''               }} }} || {{math|0, 0, 1}} || {{math|001<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|1<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset|        ''y''        }} }} || {{math|0, 1, 0}} || {{math|010<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|2<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset| ''x'', ''y''        }} }} || {{math|0, 1, 1}} || {{math|011<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|3<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset|               ''z'' }} }} || {{math|1, 0, 0}} || {{math|100<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|4<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset| ''x'',        ''z'' }} }} || {{math|1, 0, 1}} || {{math|101<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|5<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset|        ''y'', ''z'' }} }} || {{math|1, 1, 0}} || {{math|110<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|6<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|-\n| {{math|1={{mset| ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' }} }} || {{math|1, 1, 1}} || {{math|111<sub>(2)</sub>}} || {{math|7<sub>(10)</sub>}}\n|}\n\nSuch bijective mapping of ''S'' to integers is arbitrary, so this representation of subsets of ''S'' is not unique, but the sort order of the enumerated set does not change its cardinality.\n\nHowever, such finite binary representation is only possible if ''S'' can be enumerated (this is possible even if ''S'' has an infinite cardinality, such as the set of integers or rationals, but not for example if ''S'' is the set of real numbers, in which we cannot enumerate all irrational numbers to assign them a defined finite location in an ordered set containing all irrational numbers).\n\n==Relation to binomial theorem==\nThe power set is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]].  The number of subsets with {{mvar|k}} elements in the power set of a set with {{mvar|n}} elements is given by the number of [[combination]]s, {{math|C(''n'', ''k'')}}, also called [[binomial coefficient]]s.\n\nFor example, the power set of a set with three elements, has:\n\n*C(3, 0) = 1 subset with 0 elements (the empty subset),\n*C(3, 1) = 3 subsets with 1 element (the singleton subsets),\n*C(3, 2) = 3 subsets with 2 elements (the complements of the singleton subsets),\n*C(3, 3) = 1 subset with 3 elements (the original set itself).\n\n\nUsing this relationship we can compute <math display=\"inline\">\\left|2^S \\right|</math> using the formula:\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\left|2^S \\right | = \\sum_{k=0}^{|S|} \\binom{|S|}{k} </math>\n\nTherefore one can deduce the following identity, assuming <math display=\"inline\">|S| = n</math>:\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\left |2^S \\right| = 2^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} </math>\n\n==Algorithms==\nIf {{mvar|S}} is a [[finite set]], there is a [[recursive algorithm]] to calculate {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}).\n\nDefine the operation {{math|1={{mathcal|F}} (''e'', ''T'') = {''X'' ∪ {''e''} {{!}} ''X'' ∈ ''T''}}}.\n\nIn English, return the set with the element {{mvar|e}} added to each set {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|T}}.\n\n*If {{math|1=''S'' = { } }}, then {{math|1={{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) = { { } } }} is returned.\n*Otherwise:\n:*Let {{mvar|e}} be any single element of {{mvar|S}}.\n:*Let {{math|1=''T'' = ''S'' \\ {''e''} }}, where {{math|''S'' \\ {''e''} }} denotes the [[Complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of {{mvar|e}} in {{mvar|S}}.\n:*And the result: {{math|1={{mathcal|P}}(''S'') = {{mathcal|P}}(''T'') ∪ {{mathcal|F}} (''e'', {{mathcal|P}}(''T''))}} is returned.\n\nIn other words, the power set of the empty set is the set containing the empty set and the power set of any other set is all the subsets of the set containing some specific element and all the subsets of the set not containing that specific element.\n\n==Subsets of limited cardinality==\nThe set of subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} of [[cardinality]] less than or equal to {{math|κ}} is sometimes denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|P}}<sub>κ</sub>(''S'')}} or {{math|[''S'']<sup>κ</sup>}}, and the set of subsets with cardinality strictly less than {{math|κ}} is sometimes denoted {{math|{{mathcal|P}}<sub>< κ</sub>(''S'')}} or {{math|[''S'']<sup><κ</sup>}}. Similarly, the set of non-empty subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} might be denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|P}}<sub>≥ 1</sub>(''S'')}} or {{math|{{mathcal|P}}<sup>+</sup>(''S'')}}.\n\n==Power object==\nA set can be regarded as an algebra having no nontrivial operations or defining equations.  From this perspective the idea of the power set of {{mvar|''X''}} as the set of subsets of {{mvar|''X''}} generalizes naturally to the subalgebras of an [[algebraic structure]] or algebra.\n\nNow the power set of a set, when ordered by inclusion, is always a complete atomic Boolean algebra, and every complete atomic Boolean algebra arises as the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of all subsets of some set.  The generalization to arbitrary algebras is that the set of subalgebras of an algebra, again ordered by inclusion, is always an [[algebraic lattice]], and every algebraic lattice arises as the lattice of subalgebras of some algebra.  So in that regard subalgebras behave analogously to subsets.\n\nHowever, there are two important properties of subsets that do not carry over to subalgebras in general.  First, although the subsets of a set form a set (as well as a lattice), in some classes it may not be possible to organize the subalgebras of an algebra as itself an algebra in that class, although they can always be organized as a lattice.  Secondly, whereas the subsets of a set are in bijection with the functions from that set to the set {0,1} = 2, there is no guarantee that a class of algebras contains an algebra that can play the role of 2 in this way.\n\nCertain classes of algebras enjoy both of these properties.  The first property is more common, the case of having both is relatively rare.  One class that does have both is that of [[multigraph]]s.  Given two multigraphs {{mvar|''G''}} and {{mvar|''H''}}, a [[homomorphism]] {{math|''h'': ''G'' → ''H''}} consists of two functions, one mapping vertices to vertices and the other mapping edges to edges.  The set {{math|''H''<sup>''G''</sup>}} of homomorphisms from {{mvar|''G''}} to {{mvar|''H''}} can then be organized as the graph whose vertices and edges are respectively the vertex and edge functions appearing in that set.  Furthermore, the subgraphs of a multigraph {{mvar|''G''}} are in bijection with the graph homomorphisms from {{mvar|''G''}} to the multigraph {{math|Ω}} definable as the [[complete graph|complete directed graph]] on two vertices (hence four edges, namely two self-loops and two more edges forming a cycle) augmented with a fifth edge, namely a second self-loop at one of the vertices.  We can therefore organize the subgraphs of {{mvar|''G''}} as the multigraph {{math|Ω<sup>''G''</sup>}}, called the '''power object''' of {{mvar|''G''}}.\n\nWhat is special about a multigraph as an algebra is that its operations are unary.  A multigraph has two sorts of elements forming a set {{mvar|''V''}} of vertices and {{mvar|''E''}} of edges, and has two unary operations {{math|''s'',''t'': ''E'' → ''V''}} giving the source (start) and target (end) vertices of each edge.  An algebra all of whose operations are unary is called a [[presheaf]].  Every class of presheaves contains a presheaf {{math|Ω}} that plays the role for subalgebras that 2 plays for subsets.  Such a class is a special case of the more general notion of elementary [[topos]] as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[closed category|closed]] (and moreover [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]) and has an object {{math|Ω}}, called a [[subobject classifier]].  Although the term \"power object\" is sometimes used synonymously with [[exponential object]] {{math|''Y''<sup>''X''</sup>}}, in topos theory {{mvar|''Y''}} is required to be {{math|Ω}}.\n\n==Functors and quantifiers==\nIn [[category theory]] and the theory of [[elementary topos|elementary topoi]], the [[universal quantifier]] can be understood as the [[right adjoint]] of a [[functor]] between power sets, the [[inverse image]] functor of a function between sets; likewise, the [[existential quantifier]] is the [[left adjoint]].<ref>[[Saunders Mac Lane]], [[Ieke Moerdijk]], (1992) ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic'' Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|0-387-97710-4}} ''See page 58''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Set theory]]\n* [[Axiomatic set theory]]\n* [[Family of sets]]\n* [[Field of sets]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last=Devlin | first=Keith J. | authorlink=Keith Devlin | title=Fundamentals of contemporary set theory | series=Universitext | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1979 | isbn=0-387-90441-7 | zbl=0407.04003 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Halmos | first=Paul R. | authorlink=Paul Halmos | title=Naive set theory | series=The University Series in Undergraduate Mathematics | publisher=van Nostrand Company | year=1960 | zbl=0087.04403 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Puntambekar | first=A.

Hochster); for example, if the ring ''R'' contains an infinite [[Field (mathematics)|field]] or a finite field of sufficiently large cardinality, then the statement follows from a fact in [[linear algebra]] that a [[vector space]] over an infinite field or a finite field of large cardinality is not a finite union of its proper vector subspaces.<ref>Proof of the fact: suppose the vector space is a finite union of proper subspaces. Consider a finite product of [[linear functional]]s, each of which vanishes on a proper subspace that appears in the union; then it is a nonzero [[polynomial]] vanishing identically, a contradiction.</ref>\n\n== Statement and proof ==\nThe following statement and argument are perhaps the most standard.\n\n'''Statement''': Let ''E'' be a subset of ''R'' that is an additive subgroup of ''R'' and is multiplicatively closed. Let <math>I_1, I_2, \\dots, I_n, n \\ge 1</math> be ideals such that <math>I_i</math> are prime ideals for <math>i \\ge 3</math>. If ''E'' is not contained in any of <math>I_i</math>'s, then ''E'' is not contained in the union <math>\\cup I_i</math>.\n\n'''Proof by induction on ''n''''': The idea is to find an element that is in ''E'' and not in any of <math>I_i</math>'s. The basic case ''n'' = 1 is trivial. Next suppose ''n'' ≥ 2. For each ''i'' choose\n:<math>z_i \\in E - \\cup_{j \\ne i} I_j</math>\nwhere the set on the right is nonempty by inductive hypothesis. We can assume <math>z_i \\in I_i</math> for all ''i''; otherwise, some <math>z_i</math> avoids  all the <math>I_i</math>'s and we are done. Put\n:<math>z = z_1 \\dots z_{n-1} + z_n</math>.\nThen ''z'' is in ''E'' but not in any of <math>I_i</math>'s. Indeed, if ''z'' is in <math>I_i</math> for some <math>i \\le n - 1</math>, then <math>z_n</math> is in <math>I_i</math>, a contradiction. Suppose ''z'' is in <math>I_n</math>.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_part_and_content",
      "text": "{{No footnotes|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn [[algebra]], the '''content''' of a [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients (or, more generally,  with coefficients in a [[unique factorization domain]]) is the [[greatest common divisor]] of its coefficients. The '''primitive part''' of such a polynomial is the quotient of the polynomial by its content. Thus a polynomial is the product of its primitive part and its content, and this factorization is unique [[up to]] the multiplication of the content by a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] of the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of the coefficients (and the multiplication of the primitive part by the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the unit).\n\nA polynomial is ''[[Primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive]]'' if its content equals 1. Thus the primitive part of a polynomial is a primitive polynomial.\n\n[[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma for polynomials]] states that the product of primitive polynomials (with coefficients in the same unique factorization domain) also is primitive. This implies that the content and the primitive part of the product of two polynomials are, respectively, the product of the contents and the product of the primitive parts.\n\nAs the computation of greatest common divisors is generally much easier than [[polynomial factorization]], the first step of a polynomial factorization algorithm is generally the computation of its primitive part–content factorization (see {{slink|Factorization of polynomials|Primitive part–content factorization}}). Then the factorization problem is reduced to factorize separately the content and the primitive part.\n\nContent and primitive part may be generalized to polynomials over the [[rational number]]s, and, more generally, to polynomials over the [[field of fractions]] of a unique factorization domain. This makes essentially equivalent the problems of computing greatest common divisors and factorization of polynomials over the integers and of polynomials over the rational numbers.\n\n==Over the integers==\nFor a polynomial with integer coefficients, the content may be either the [[greatest common divisor]] of the coefficients or its [[additive inverse]]. The choice is arbitrary, and may depend on a further convention, which is commonly that the [[leading coefficient]] of the primitive part be positive.\n\nFor example, the content of <math>-12x^3+30x-20</math> may be either 2 or –2, since 2 is the greatest common divisor of –12, 30, and -20. If one chooses 2 as the content, the primitive part of this polynomial is \n:<math>-6x^3+15x-10 = \\frac{-12x^3+30x-20}{2},</math>\nand thus the primitive–part–content factorization is\n:<math>-12x^3+30x-20 = 2 (-6x^3+15x-10).</math>\nFor aesthetic reasons, one often prefers choosing a negative content, here –2, giving the primitive–part–content factorization\n:<math>-12x^3+30x-20 =-2 (6x^3-15x+10).</math>\n\n==Properties==\nIn the remainder of this article, we consider polynomials over a [[unique factorization domain]] {{math|''R''}}, which can typically be the ring of [[integer]]s, or a [[polynomial ring]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In {{math|''R''}}, [[greatest common divisor]]s are well defined, and are unique [[up to]] the multiplication by a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] of {{math|''R''}}.\n\nThe '''content''' {{math|''c''(''P'')}} of a polynomial {{math|''P''}} with coefficients in {{math|''R''}} is the greatest common divisor of its coefficients, and, as such, is defined up to the multiplication by a unit. The '''primitive part''' {{math|pp(''P'')}} of {{math|''P''}} is the quotient {{math|''P''/''c''(''P'')}} of {{math|''P''}} by its content; it is a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''R''}}, which is unique up to the multiplication by a unit. If the content is changed by multiplication by a unit {{math|''u''}}, then the primitive part must be changed by dividing it by the same unit, in order to keep the equality\n:<math>P=c(P)\\operatorname{pp}(P),</math>\nwhich is called the primitive-part-content factorization of {{math|''P''}}.\n\nThe main properties of the content and the primitive part are results of [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], which asserts that the product of two primitive polynomials is primitive, where a polynomial is primitive if 1 is the greatest common divisor of its coefficients. This implies:\n*The content of a product of polynomials is the product of their contents:\n::<math>c(P_1P_2)=c(P_1)c(P_2).</math>\n*The primitive part of a product of polynomials is the product of their primitive parts:\n::<math>\\operatorname{pp}(P_1P_2)=\\operatorname{pp}(P_1)\\operatorname{pp}(P_2).</math>\n*The content of a greatest common divisor of polynomials is the greatest common divisor (in {{math|''R''}}) of their contents:\n::<math>c(\\operatorname{gcd}(P_1, P_2))=\\operatorname{gcd}(c(P_1), c(P_2)).</math>\n*The primitive part of a greatest common divisor of polynomials is the greatest common divisor (in {{math|''R''}}) of their primitive parts:\n::<math>\\operatorname{pp}(\\operatorname{gcd}(P_1, P_2))=\\operatorname{gcd}(\\operatorname{pp}(P_1), \\operatorname{pp}(P_2)).</math>\n*The complete [[factorization of polynomials|factorization]] of a polynomial over {{math|''R''}} is the product of the factorization (in {{math|''R''}}) of the content and of the factorization (in the polynomial ring) of the primitive part.\n\nThe last property implies that the computation of the primitive-part-content factorization of a polynomial reduces the computation of its complete factorization to the separate factorization of the content and the primitive part. This is generally interesting, because the computation of the prime-part-content factorization involves only greatest common divisor computation in {{math|''R''}}, which is usually much easier than factorization.\n\n==Over the rationals==\nThe primitive-part-content factorization may be extended to polynomials with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients as follows.\n\nGiven a polynomial {{math|''P''}} with rational coefficients, by rewriting its coefficients with the same [[common denominator]] {{math|''d''}}, one may rewrite {{math|''P''}} as\n:<math>P=\\frac{Q}{d},</math>\nwhere {{math|Q}} is a polynomial with integer coefficients.\nThe '''content''' of {{math|''P''}} is the quotient by {{math|''d''}} of the content of {{math|''Q''}}, that is \n:<math>c(P)=\\frac{c(Q)}{d},</math>\nand the '''primitive part''' of {{math|''P''}} is the primitive part of {{math|''Q''}}:\n:<math>\\operatorname{pp}(P) = \\operatorname{pp}(Q).</math>\n\nIt is easy to show that this definition does not depend on the choice of the common denominator, and that the primitive-part-content factorization remains valid:\n:<math>P=c(P)\\operatorname{pp}(P).</math>\n\nThis shows that every polynomial over the rationals is [[associate elements|associated]] with a unique primitive polynomial over the integers, and that the [[Euclidean algorithm]] allows the computation of this primitive polynomial.\n\nA consequence is that factoring polynomials over the rationals is equivalent to factoring primitive polynomials over the integers. As polynomials with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] are more common than polynomials with integer coefficients, it may seem that this equivalence may be used for factoring polynomials with integer coefficients. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite: every known efficient algorithm for factoring polynomials with rational coefficient uses this equivalence for reducing the problem [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] some prime number {{math|''p''}} (see [[Factorization of polynomials]]).\n\nThis equivalence is also used for computing [[polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]]s of polynomials, although the [[Euclidean algorithm]] is defined for polynomials with rational coefficients. In fact, in this case, the Euclidean algorithm requires one to compute the [[irreducible fraction|reduced form]] of many fractions, and this makes the Euclidean algorithm less efficient than algorithms which work only with polynomials over the integers (see [[Polynomial greatest common divisor]]).\n\n==Over a field of fractions==\nThe results of the preceding section remain valid if the ring of integers and the field of rationals are respectively replaced by any [[unique factorization domain]] {{math|''R''}} and its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''K''}}.\n\nThis is typically used for factoring [[multivariate polynomial]]s, and for proving that a polynomial ring over a unique factorization domain is also a unique factorization domain.\n\n===Unique factorization property of polynomial rings===\n\nA [[polynomial ring]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a unique factorization domain. The same is true for a polynomial ring over a unique factorization domain. To prove this, it suffices to consider the [[univariate]] case, as the general case may be deduced by a [[mathematical induction|recurrence]] on the number of indeterminates.\n\nThe unique factorization property is a direct consequence of [[Euclid's lemma]]: If an [[irreducible element]] divides a product, then it divides one of the factors.  For univariate polynomials over a field, this results from [[Bézout's identity]], which itself results from [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n\nSo, let {{math|''R''}} be a unique factorization domain, which is not a field, and {{math|''R''[''X'']}} the univariate [[polynomial ring]] over {{math|''R''}}. An irreducible element {{math|''r''}} in {{math|''R''[''X'']}} is either an irreducible element in {{math|''R''}} or an irreducible primitive polynomial.\n\nIf {{math|''r''}} is in {{math|''R''}} and divides a product <math>P_1P_2</math> of two polynomials, then it divides the content <math>c(P_1P_2) = c(P_1)c(P_2).</math> Thus, by Euclid's lemma in {{math|''R''}}, it divides one of the contents, and therefore one of the polynomials.\n\nIf {{math|''r''}} is not {{math|''R''}}, it is a primitive polynomial (because it is irreducible). Then Euclid's lemma in {{math|''R''[''X'']}} results immediately from Euclid's lemma in {{math|''K''[''X'']}}, where {{math|''K''}} is the field of fractions of {{math|''R''}}.\n\n===Factorization of multivariate polynomials===\n{{see also|Factorization of polynomials}}\n\nFor factoring a multivariate polynomial over a field or over the integers, one may consider it as a univariate polynomial with coefficients in a polynomial ring with one less indeterminate. Then the factorization is reduced to factorizing separately the primitive part and the content. As the content has one less indeterminate, it may be factorized by applying the method [[recursion (computer science)|recursively]]. For factorizing the primitive part, the standard method consists of substituting integers to the indeterminates of the coefficients in a way that does not change the degree in the remaining variable, factorizing the resulting univariate polynomial, and lifting the result to a factorization of the primitive part.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rational root theorem]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author=B.

A quotient of two quantities that are measured with ''different'' units is called a [[rate (mathematics)|rate]].<ref>''\"The quotient of two numbers (or quantities); the relative sizes of two numbers (or quantities)\"'', \"The Mathematics Dictionary\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=UyIfgBIwLMQC&lpg=PA349&dq=dictionary%20ratio&pg=PA349#v=onepage&q=dictionary%20ratio&f=false]</ref>\n\n== Notation and terminology ==\nThe ratio of numbers ''A'' and ''B'' can be expressed as:<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>\n*the ratio of ''A'' to ''B''\n*''A'' is to ''B'' (often followed by \"as ''C'' is to ''D''\")\n*''A''∶''B''\n*a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with ''A'' as numerator and ''B'' as denominator, that represents the quotient: ''A'' divided by ''B'': <math>\\tfrac{A}{B}</math>. This can be expressed as a simple or a decimal fraction, or as a percentage, etc.<ref>Decimal fractions are frequently used in technological areas where ratio comparisons are important, such as aspect ratios (imaging), compression ratios (engines or data storage), etc.</ref>\n\nThere are [[parts-per notation|several variants]] in the same vein as ''percentage'', with the meaning of ''per hundred'', equivalent to <math>1\\%=\\tfrac {1}{100};</math> for example, the ''per mill'' from Latin mille, meaning thousand, equivalent to {{math|1}}‰ <math>=\\tfrac {1}{1000}= 0.1\\%,</math> or, especially for particle densities, ''parts per billion'', abbreviated as ''ppb''. There is also a specific [[letterlike symbols|unicode sign]], the ''per'' sign, looking like ⅌, for the use of arbitrary denominators, e.g., ⅌ 12 as ''per dozen''.\n\nThe numbers ''A'' and ''B'' are sometimes called ''terms of the ratio'' with ''A'' being the ''[[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]'' and ''B'' being the ''[[consequent]]''.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/topic/ratio from the Encyclopædia Britannica]</ref>\n\nA statement expressing the equality of two ratios ''A''∶''B'' and ''C''∶''D'' is called a '''proportion'''{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, written as ''A''∶''B'' = ''C''∶''D'' or ''A''∶''B''::''C''∶''D''. This latter form, when spoken or written in the English language, is often expressed as\n:(''A'' is to ''B'') as (''C'' is to ''D'').\n\n''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are called the terms of the proportion. ''A'' and ''D'' are called its ''extremes'', and ''B'' and ''C'' are called its ''means''. The equality of three or more ratios, like ''A''∶''B'' = ''C''∶''D'' = ''E''∶''F'', is called a '''continued proportion'''.<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nRatios are sometimes used with three or even more terms, e.g., the proportion for the edge lengths of a \"[[Dimensional lumber|two by four]]\" that is ten inches long is therefore\n:<math>\\text{thickness : width : length } = 2:4:10;</math>\n:(Note: Unplaned measurements)\n\na good concrete mix (in volume units) is sometimes quoted as\n:<math>\\text{cement : sand : gravel } = 1:2:4.</math><ref>[http://www.bellegroup.com/es/support/mixingHints.html Belle Group concrete mixing hints]</ref>\n\nFor a (rather dry) mixture of 4/1 parts in volume of cement to water, it could be said that the ratio of cement to water is 4∶1, that there is 4 times as much cement as water, or that there is a quarter (1/4) as much water as cement.\n\nThe meaning of such a proportion of ratios with more than two terms is that the ratio of any two terms on the LHS makes up a standard proportion with the corresponding two terms on the RHS. The corresponding terms are called the ''homologues''{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} in the proportion.\n\n==History and etymology==\nIt is impossible to trace the origin of the ''concept'' of ratio because the ideas from which it developed would have been familiar to preliterate cultures. For example, the idea of one village being twice as large as another is so basic that it would have been understood in prehistoric society.<ref>Smith, p. 477</ref> However, it is possible to trace the origin of the word \"ratio\" to the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|λόγος}} (''[[logos]]''). Early translators rendered this into [[Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]}}'' (\"reason\"; as in the word \"rational\"). (A rational number may be expressed as the quotient of two integers.) A more modern interpretation of Euclid's meaning is more akin to computation or reckoning.<ref>Penny Cyclopedia, p. 307</ref> Medieval writers used the word ''{{lang|la|proportio}}'' (\"proportion\") to indicate ratio and ''{{lang|la|proportionalitas}}'' (\"proportionality\") for the equality of ratios.<ref>Smith, p. 478</ref>\n\nEuclid collected the results appearing in the Elements from earlier sources. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] developed a theory of ratio and proportion as applied to numbers.<ref>Heath, p. 112</ref> The Pythagoreans' conception of number included only what would today be called rational numbers, casting doubt on the validity of the theory in geometry where, as the Pythagoreans also discovered, incommensurable ratios (corresponding to irrational numbers) exist. The discovery of a theory of ratios that does not assume commensurability is probably due to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The exposition of the theory of proportions that appears in Book VII of The Elements reflects the earlier theory of ratios of commensurables.<ref>Heath, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe existence of multiple theories seems unnecessarily complex to modern sensibility since ratios are, to a large extent, identified with quotients. This is a comparatively recent development however, as can be seen from the fact that modern geometry textbooks still use distinct terminology and notation for ratios and quotients. The reasons for this are twofold. First, there was the previously mentioned reluctance to accept irrational numbers as true numbers. Second, the lack of a widely used symbolism to replace the already established terminology of ratios delayed the full acceptance of fractions as alternative until the 16th century.<ref>Smith, p. 480</ref>\n\n===Euclid's definitions===\nBook V of [[Euclid's Elements]] has 18 definitions, all of which relate to ratios.<ref>Heath, reference for section</ref> In addition, Euclid uses ideas that were in such common usage that he did not include definitions for them. The first two definitions say that a ''part'' of a quantity is another quantity that \"measures\" it and conversely, a ''multiple'' of a quantity is another quantity that it measures. In modern terminology, this means that a multiple of a quantity is that quantity multiplied by an integer greater than one—and a part of a quantity (meaning [[aliquot part]]) is a part that, when multiplied by an integer greater than one, gives the quantity.\n\nEuclid does not define the term \"measure\" as used here, However, one may infer that if a quantity is taken as a unit of measurement, and a second quantity is given as an integral number of these units, then the first quantity ''measures'' the second. Note that these definitions are repeated, nearly word for word, as definitions 3 and 5 in book VII.\n\nDefinition 3 describes what a ratio is in a general way. It is not rigorous in a mathematical sense and some have ascribed it to Euclid's editors rather than Euclid himself.<ref>\"Geometry, Euclidean\" ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' p682.</ref> Euclid defines a ratio as between two quantities ''of the same type'', so by this definition the ratios of two lengths or of two areas are defined, but not the ratio of a length and an area. Definition 4 makes this more rigorous. It states that a ratio of two quantities exists when there is a multiple of each that exceeds the other. In modern notation, a ratio exists between quantities ''p'' and ''q'' if there exist integers ''m'' and ''n'' so that ''mp''>''q'' and ''nq''>''p''. This condition is known as the [[Archimedes property]].\n\nDefinition 5 is the most complex and difficult. It defines what it means for two ratios to be equal. Today, this can be done by simply stating that ratios are equal when the quotients of the terms are equal, but Euclid did not accept the existence of the quotients of incommensurate, so such a definition would have been meaningless to him. Thus, a more subtle definition is needed where quantities involved are not measured directly to one another. Though it may not be possible to assign a rational value to a ratio, it is possible to compare a ratio with a rational number. Specifically, given two quantities, ''p'' and ''q'', and a rational number ''m''/''n'' we can say that the ratio of ''p'' to ''q'' is less than, equal to, or greater than ''m''/''n'' when ''np'' is less than, equal to, or greater than ''mq'' respectively. Euclid's definition of equality can be stated as that two ratios are equal when they behave identically with respect to being less than, equal to, or greater than any rational number. In modern notation this says that given quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'', then ''p'':''q''::''r'':''s'' if for any positive integers ''m'' and ''n'', ''np''<''mq'', ''np''=''mq'', ''np''>''mq'' according as ''nr''<''ms'', ''nr''=''ms'', ''nr''>''ms'' respectively. There is a remarkable similarity between this definition and the theory of [[Dedekind cut]]s used in the modern definition of irrational numbers.<ref>Heath p. 125</ref>\n\nDefinition 6 says that quantities that have the same ratio are ''proportional'' or ''in proportion''. Euclid uses the Greek ἀναλόγον (analogon), this has the same root as λόγος and is related to the English word \"analog\".\n\nDefinition 7 defines what it means for one ratio to be less than or greater than another and is based on the ideas present in definition 5. In modern notation it says that given quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'', then ''p'':''q''>''r'':''s'' if there are positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' so that ''np''>''mq'' and ''nr''≤''ms''.\n\nAs with definition 3, definition 8 is regarded by some as being a later insertion by Euclid's editors. It defines three terms ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' to be in proportion when ''p'':''q''::''q'':''r''. This is extended to 4 terms ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' as ''p'':''q''::''q'':''r''::''r'':''s'', and so on. Sequences that have the property that the ratios of consecutive terms are equal are called [[geometric progression]]s. Definitions 9 and 10 apply this, saying that if ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' are in proportion then ''p'':''r'' is the ''duplicate ratio'' of ''p'':''q'' and if ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' are in proportion then ''p'':''s'' is the ''triplicate ratio'' of ''p'':''q''. If ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' are in proportion then ''q'' is called a ''mean proportional'' to (or the [[geometric mean]] of) ''p'' and ''r''. Similarly, if ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' are in proportion then ''q'' and ''r'' are called two mean proportionals to ''p'' and ''s''.\n\n==Number of terms and use of fractions==\nIn general, a comparison of the quantities of a two-entity ratio can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] derived from the ratio. For example, in a ratio of 2:3, the amount, size, volume, or quantity of the first entity is <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> that of the second entity.\n\nIf there are 2 oranges and 3 apples, the ratio of oranges to apples is 2:3, and the ratio of oranges to the total number of pieces of fruit is 2:5.  These ratios can also be expressed in fraction form: there are 2/3 as many oranges as apples, and 2/5 of the pieces of fruit are oranges.  If orange juice concentrate is to be diluted with water in the ratio 1:4, then one part of concentrate is mixed with four parts of water, giving five parts total; the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/4 the amount of water, while the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/5 of the total liquid.  In both ratios and fractions, it is important to be clear what is being compared to what, and beginners often make mistakes for this reason.\n\nFractions can also be inferred from ratios with more than two entities; however, a ratio with more than two entities cannot be completely converted into a single fraction, because a fraction can only compare two quantities. A separate fraction can be used to compare the quantities of any two of the entities covered by the ratio: for example, from a ratio of 2:3:7 we can infer that the quantity of the second entity is <math>\\tfrac{3}{7}</math> that of the third entity.\n\n==Proportions and percentage ratios==\nIf we multiply all quantities involved in a ratio by the same number, the ratio remains valid. For example, a ratio of 3:2 is the same as 12:8. It is usual either to reduce terms to the [[lowest common denominator]], or to express them in parts per hundred ([[percent]]).\n\nIf a mixture contains substances A, B, C and D in the ratio 5:9:4:2 then there are 5 parts of A for every 9 parts of B, 4 parts of C and 2 parts of D.  As 5+9+4+2=20, the total mixture contains 5/20 of A (5 parts out of 20), 9/20 of B, 4/20 of C, and 2/20 of D.  If we divide all numbers by the total and multiply by 100, we have converted to [[percentages]]: 25% A, 45% B, 20% C, and 10% D (equivalent to writing the ratio as 25:45:20:10).\n\nIf the two or more ratio quantities encompass all of the quantities in a particular situation, it is said that \"the whole\" contains the sum of the parts: for example, a fruit basket containing two apples and three oranges and no other fruit is made up of two parts apples and three parts oranges. In this case, <math>\\tfrac{2}{5}</math>, or 40% of the whole is apples and <math>\\tfrac{3}{5}</math>, or 60% of the whole is oranges. This comparison of a specific quantity to \"the whole\" is called a proportion.\n\nIf the ratio consists of only two values, it can be represented as a fraction, in particular as a decimal fraction. For example, older [[television]]s have a 4:3 ''[[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]'', which means that the width is 4/3 of the height (this can also be expressed as 1.33:1 or just 1.33 rounded to two decimal places). More recent widescreen TVs have a 16:9 aspect ratio, or 1.78 rounded to two decimal places. One of the popular widescreen movie formats is 2.35:1 or simply 2.35. Representing ratios as decimal fractions simplifies their comparison. When comparing 1.33, 1.78 and 2.35, it is obvious which format offers wider image. Such a comparison works only when values being compared are consistent, like always expressing width in relation to height.\n\n==Reduction==\nRatios can be [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduced]] (as fractions are) by dividing each quantity by the common factors of all the quantities. As for fractions, the simplest form is considered that in which the numbers in the ratio are the smallest possible integers.\n\nThus, the ratio 40:60 is equivalent in meaning to the ratio 2:3, the latter being obtained from the former by dividing both quantities by 20. Mathematically, we write 40:60 = 2:3, or equivalently 40:60::2:3. The verbal equivalent is \"40 is to 60 as 2 is to 3.\"\n\nA ratio that has integers for both quantities and that cannot be reduced any further (using integers) is said to be in [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]] or lowest terms.\n\nSometimes it is useful to write a ratio in the form 1:''x'' or ''x'':1, where ''x'' is not necessarily an integer, to enable comparisons of different ratios. For example, the ratio 4:5 can be written as 1:1.25 (dividing both sides by 4) Alternatively, it can be written as 0.8:1 (dividing both sides by 5).\n\nWhere the context makes the meaning clear, a ratio in this form is sometimes written without the 1 and the colon, though, mathematically, this makes it a [[divisor|factor]] or [[Multiplication|multiplier]].\n\n==Irrational ratios==\nRatios may also be established between [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] quantities (quantities whose ratio, as value of a fraction, amounts to an [[irrational number]]). The earliest discovered example, found by the [[Pythagoreans]], is the ratio of the length of the diagonal {{mvar|d}} to the length of a side {{mvar|s}} of a [[square]], which is the [[square root of 2]], formally <math>a:d = 1:\\sqrt{2}.</math> Another example is the ratio of a [[circle]]'s circumference to its diameter, which is called [[pi|{{pi}}]], and is not just an [[algebraic number|algebraically irrational number]], but a [[transcendental number|transcendental irrational]].\n\nAlso well-known is the [[golden ratio]] of two (mostly) lengths {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, which is defined by the proportion\n: <math>a:b = (a+b):a \\quad</math> or, equivalently <math>\\quad a:b = (1+b/a):1.</math>\nTaking the ratios as fractions and <math>a:b</math> as having the value {{mvar|x}}, yields the equation\n:<math>x=1+\\tfrac 1x \\quad</math> or <math>\\quad x^2-x-1 = 0,</math>\nwhich has the positive, irrational solution <math>x=\\tfrac{a}{b}=\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.</math>\nThus at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' has to be irrational for them to be in the golden ratio. An example of an occurrence of the golden ratio in math is as the limiting value of the ratio of two consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s: even though all these ratios are ratios of two integers and hence are rational, the limit of the sequence of these rational ratios is the irrational golden ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the [[silver ratio]] of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is defined by the proportion\n:<math>a:b = (2a+b):a \\quad (= (2+b/a):1),</math> corresponding to <math>x^2-2x-1 = 0.</math> \nThis equation has the positive, irrational solution <math>x = \\tfrac{a}{b}=1+\\sqrt{2},</math>  so again at least one of the two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' in the silver ratio must be irrational.\n\n==Odds==\n{{Main|Odds}}\n''Odds'' (as in gambling) are expressed as a ratio.  For example, odds of \"7 to 3 against\" (7:3) mean that there are seven chances that the event will not happen to every three chances that it will happen.  The probability of success is 30%.  In every ten trials, there are expected to be three wins and seven losses.\n\n==Units==\nRatios may be [[Dimensionless quantity|unitless]], as in the case they relate quantities in units of the same [[dimensional analysis|dimension]], even if their [[units of measurement]] are initially different.\nFor example, the ratio 1 minute : 40 seconds can be reduced by changing the first value to 60 seconds. Once the units are the same, they can be omitted, and the ratio can be reduced to 3:2.\n\nOn the other hand, there are non-dimensionless ratios, also known as [[rate (mathematics)|rates]].<ref>''\"'Velocity' can be defined as the ratio... 'Population density' is the ratio... 'Gasoline consumption' is measure as the ratio...\"'', \"Ratio and Proportion: Research and Teaching in Mathematics Teachers\"  [https://books.google.com/books?id=eawKLY71xvkC&lpg=PP1&dq=ratio&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=perspective&f=false]</ref><ref>''\"''Ratio as a Rate''. The first type [of ratio] defined by [[Freudenthal]], above, is known as rate, and illustrates a comparison between two variables with difference units. (...) A ratio of this sort produces a unique, new concept with its own entity, and this new concept is usually not considered a ratio, per se, but a rate or density.\"'', \"Ratio and Proportion: Research and Teaching in Mathematics Teachers\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=eawKLY71xvkC&lpg=PP1&dq=ratio&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q=rate&f=false]</ref>\nIn chemistry, [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]] ratios are usually expressed as weight/volume fractions.\nFor example, a concentration of 3% w/v usually means 3&nbsp;g of substance in every 100&nbsp;mL of solution.  This cannot be converted to a dimensionless ratio, as in weight/weight or volume/volume fractions.\n\n==Triangular coordinates==\nThe locations of points relative to a triangle with [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' and sides ''AB'', ''BC'', and ''CA''  are often expressed in extended ratio form as ''triangular coordinates''.\n\nIn [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]], a point with coordinates <math>\\alpha : \\beta : \\gamma</math> is the point upon which a weightless sheet of metal in the shape and size of the triangle would exactly balance if weights were put on the vertices, with the ratio of the weights at ''A'' and ''B'' being <math>\\alpha : \\beta,</math> the ratio of the weights at ''B'' and ''C'' being <math>\\beta : \\gamma,</math> and therefore the ratio of weights at ''A'' and ''C'' being <math>\\alpha : \\gamma.</math>\n\nIn [[trilinear coordinates]], a point with coordinates ''x:y:z'' has [[perpendicular]] distances to side ''BC'' (across from vertex ''A'') and side  ''CA'' (across from vertex ''B'') in the ratio ''x:y'', distances to side ''CA'' and side ''AB'' (across from ''C'') in the ratio ''y:z'', and therefore distances to sides ''BC'' and ''AB'' in the ratio ''x:z''.\n\nSince all information is expressed in terms of ratios (the individual numbers denoted by <math>\\alpha , \\beta , \\gamma, </math> ''x, y,'' and ''z'' have no meaning by themselves), a triangle analysis using barycentric or trilinear coordinates applies regardless of the size of the triangle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dilution ratio]]\n*[[Displacement–length ratio]]\n*[[Dimensionless quantity]]\n*[[Financial ratio]]\n*[[Fold change]]\n*[[Interval (music)]]\n*[[Odds ratio]]\n*[[Parts-per notation]]\n*[[Price–performance ratio]]\n*[[Proportionality (mathematics)]]\n*[[Ratio distribution]]\n*[[Ratio estimator]]\n*[[Rate (mathematics)]]\n*[[Rate ratio]]\n*[[Relative risk]]\n*[[Rule of three (mathematics)]]\n*[[Scale (map)]]\n*[[Sex ratio]]\n*[[Slope]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqsrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 \"Ratio\" ''The Penny Cyclopædia'' vol. 19], The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London pp.&nbsp;307ff\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgAoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA270 \"Proportion\" ''New International Encyclopedia, Vol. 19'' 2nd ed.

      "text": "{{short description|Definition of each term of a sequence as a function of the preceding ones}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Difference equation|differential equation}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''recurrence relation''' is an [[equation]] that [[recursion|recursively]] defines a [[sequence]] or multidimensional array of values, once one or more initial terms are given: each further term of the sequence or array is defined as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the preceding terms.\n\nThe term '''[[#Relationship_to_difference_equations_narrowly_defined|difference equation]]''' sometimes (and for the purposes of this article) refers to a specific type of recurrence relation.  However, \"difference equation\" is frequently used to refer to ''any'' recurrence relation.\n\n==Definition==\nA ''recurrence relation'' is an equation that expresses each element of a [[sequence]] as a function of the preceding ones. More precisely, in the case where only the immediately preceding element is involved, a recurrence relation has the form\n:<math>u_n=\\varphi(n, u_{n-1})\\quad\\text{for}\\quad n>0,</math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\varphi:\\mathbb N\\times X \\to X</math>\nis a function, where {{mvar|X}} is a set to which the elements of a sequence must belong. For any <math>u_0\\in X</math>, this defines a unique sequence with <math>u_0</math> as its first element, called the ''initial value''.<ref>Jacobson, Nathan , Basic Algebra 2 (2nd ed.), § 0.4. pg 16.</ref>\n\nIt is easy to modify the definition for getting sequences starting from the term of index 1 or higher.\n\nThis defines recurrence relation of ''first order''. A recurrence relation of ''order'' {{mvar|k}} has the form \n:<math>u_n=\\varphi(n, u_{n-1}, u_{n-2}, \\ldots, u_{n-k})\\quad\\text{for}\\quad n\\ge k,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varphi: \\mathbb N\\times X^k \\to X</math> is a function that involves {{mvar|k}} consecutive elements of the sequence.\nIn this case, {{mvar|k}} initial values are needed for defining a sequence.\n\n==Examples==\n===Factorial===\nThe [[factorial]] is defined by the recurrence relation\n:<math>n!=n(n-1)!\\quad\\text{for}\\quad n>0,</math>\nand the initial condition\n:<math>0!=1.</math>\n\n===Logistic map===\nAn example of a recurrence relation is the [[logistic map]]:\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n),</math>\n\nwith a given constant ''r''; given the initial term ''x''<sub>0</sub> each subsequent term is determined by this relation.\n\nSolving a recurrence relation means obtaining a [[closed-form solution]]: a non-recursive function of ''n''.\n\n===Fibonacci numbers===\nThe recurrence of order two satisfied by the [[Fibonacci number]]s is the archetype of a homogeneous [[linear recurrence]] relation with constant coefficients (see below).  The Fibonacci sequence is defined using the recurrence\n\n:<math>F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}</math>\n\nwith [[initial condition]]s (seed values)\n\n:<math>F_0 = 0</math>\n:<math>F_1 = 1.</math>\n\nExplicitly, the recurrence yields the equations\n:<math>F_2 = F_1 + F_0</math>\n:<math>F_3 = F_2 + F_1</math>\n:<math>F_4 = F_3 + F_2</math>\netc.\n\nWe obtain the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which begins\n:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n\nThe recurrence can be solved by methods described below yielding [[Binet's formula]], which involves powers of the two roots of the characteristic polynomial ''t''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1; the [[generating function]] of the sequence is the [[rational function]]\n:  <math>\\frac{t}{1-t-t^2}.</math>\n\n===Binomial coefficients===\nA simple example of a multidimensional recurrence relation is given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s <math>\\tbinom{n}{k}</math>, which count the number of ways of selecting ''k'' elements out of a set of ''n'' elements.\nThey can be computed by the recurrence relation\n:<math>\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k},</math>\nwith the base cases <math>\\tbinom{n}{0}=\\tbinom{n}{n}=1</math>. Using this formula to compute the values of all binomial coefficients generates an infinite array called [[Pascal's triangle]]. The same values can also be computed directly by a different formula that is not a recurrence, but that requires multiplication and not just addition to compute:\n<math>\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.</math>\n\n== Relationship to difference equations narrowly defined ==\nGiven an ordered [[sequence]] <math>\\left\\{a_n\\right\\}_{n=1}^\\infty</math> of [[real numbers]]: the '''first difference''' <math>\\Delta(a_n)</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>\\Delta(a_n) = a_{n+1} - a_n.</math>\n\nThe '''second difference''' <math>\\Delta^2(a_n)</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>\\Delta^2(a_n) = \\Delta(a_{n+1}) - \\Delta(a_n),</math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n\n:<math>\\Delta^2(a_n) = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n.</math>\n\nMore generally: the ''' ''k''-th difference''' of the sequence ''a<sub>n</sub>'' written as <math>\\Delta^k(a_n)</math> is defined recursively as\n\n:<math>\\Delta^k(a_n) = \\Delta^{k-1}(a_{n+1}) - \\Delta^{k-1}(a_n)=\\sum_{t=0}^k \\binom{k}{t} (-1)^t a_{n+k-t}.</math>\n\n(The sequence and its differences are related by a [[binomial transform]].) The more restrictive definition of '''difference equation''' is an equation composed of ''a<sub>n</sub>'' and its ''k''<sup>th</sup> differences. (A widely used broader definition treats \"difference equation\" as synonymous with \"recurrence relation\".  See for example [[rational difference equation]] and [[matrix difference equation]].)\n\nActually, it is easily seen that,\n\n:<math>a_{n+k} = \n{k\\choose 0}a_n + {k\\choose 1} \\Delta(a_n)  + \\cdots + {k\\choose k} \\Delta^k(a_n).\n</math>\n\nThus, a difference equation can be defined as an equation that involves \n''a<sub>n</sub>'', ''a<sub>n-1</sub>'', ''a<sub>n-2</sub>'' etc. (or equivalently\n''a<sub>n</sub>'', ''a<sub>n+1</sub>'', ''a<sub>n+2</sub>'' etc.)\n\nSince difference equations are a very common form of recurrence, some authors use the two terms interchangeably. For example, the difference equation\n\n:<math>3\\Delta^2(a_n) + 2\\Delta(a_n) + 7a_n = 0</math>\n\nis equivalent to the recurrence relation\n\n:<math>3a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - 8a_n.</math>\n\nThus one can solve many recurrence relations by rephrasing them as difference equations, and then solving the difference equation, analogously to how one solves [[ordinary differential equations]].  However, the [[Ackermann number]]s are an example of a recurrence relation that do not map to a difference equation, much less points on the solution to a differential equation.\n\nSee [[time scale calculus]] for a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of [[differential equations]].\n\n[[Summation equation]]s relate to difference equations as [[integral equation]]s relate to differential equations.\n\n===From sequences to grids===\nSingle-variable or one-dimensional recurrence relations are about sequences (i.e. functions defined on one-dimensional grids). Multi-variable or n-dimensional recurrence relations are about n-dimensional grids. Functions defined on n-grids can also be studied with '''partial difference equations'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1klnDGelHGEC Partial difference equations], Sui Sun Cheng, CRC Press, 2003, {{isbn|978-0-415-29884-1}}</ref>\n\n== Solving ==\n\n=== Solving homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients ===\n\n{{Main|Constant-recursive sequence|Linear difference equation}}\n\n====Roots of the characteristic polynomial====\nAn order-''d'' '''homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients'''  is an equation of the form\n\n:<math>a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\\cdots+c_da_{n-d},</math>\n\nwhere the ''d'' coefficients ''c<sub>i</sub>'' (for all ''i'') are constants, and <math>c_d\\ne0</math>.\n\nA [[constant-recursive sequence]] is a sequence satisfying a recurrence of this form.  There are ''d'' [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for solutions to this recurrence, i.e., the initial values <math>a_0,\\dots,a_{d-1}</math> can be taken to be any values but then the recurrence determines the sequence uniquely.\n\nThe same coefficients yield the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also \"auxiliary polynomial\")\n\n:<math>p(t)= t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\\cdots-c_{d}</math>\nwhose ''d'' roots play a crucial role in finding and understanding the sequences satisfying the recurrence.

When the same roots occur multiple times, the terms in this formula corresponding to the second and later occurrences of the same root are multiplied by increasing powers of ''n''. For instance, if the characteristic polynomial can be factored as (''x''−''r'')<sup>3</sup>, with the same root ''r'' occurring three times, then the solution would take the form\n:<math>a_n = k_1 r^n + k_2 n r^n + k_3 n^2 r^n.</math><ref>{{citation|contribution=2.1.1 Constant coefficients – A) Homogeneous equations|title=Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms|first1=Daniel H.|last1=Greene|first2=Donald E.|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth| edition=2nd| publisher=Birkhäuser |page=17 | year=1982}}.</ref>\n\nAs well as the [[Fibonacci number]]s, other constant-recursive sequences include the [[Lucas number]]s and [[Lucas sequence]]s, the [[Jacobsthal number]]s, the [[Pell number]]s and more generally the solutions to [[Pell's equation]].\n\nFor order 1, the recurrence\n:<math>a_{n}=r a_{n-1}</math>\nhas the solution ''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r<sup>n</sup>'' with ''a''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and the most general solution is ''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''kr<sup>n</sup>'' with ''a''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''. The  characteristic polynomial equated to zero (the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]) is simply ''t''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nSolutions to such recurrence relations of higher order are found by systematic means, often using the fact that ''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r<sup>n</sup>'' is a solution for the recurrence exactly when ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r'' is a root of the characteristic polynomial. This can be approached directly or using [[generating function]]s ([[formal power series]]) or matrices.\n\nConsider, for example, a recurrence relation of the form\n\n:<math>a_{n}=Aa_{n-1}+Ba_{n-2}.</math>\n\nWhen does it have a solution of the same general form as ''a<sub>n</sub>'' = ''r<sup>n</sup>''?

Solve for ''r'' to obtain the two roots ''λ''<sub>1</sub>, ''λ''<sub>2</sub>: these roots are known as the [[characteristic root]]s or '''eigenvalues''' of the characteristic equation.  Different solutions are obtained depending on the nature of the roots:  If these roots are distinct, we have the general solution\n\n:<math>a_n = C\\lambda_1^n+D\\lambda_2^n</math>\n\nwhile if they are identical (when ''A''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;4''B''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), we have\n\n:<math>a_n = C\\lambda^n+Dn\\lambda^n</math>\n\nThis is the most general solution; the two constants ''C'' and ''D'' can be chosen based on two given initial conditions ''a''<sub>0</sub> and ''a''<sub>1</sub> to produce a specific solution.\n\nIn the case of complex eigenvalues (which also gives rise to complex values for the solution parameters ''C'' and ''D''), the use of complex numbers can be eliminated by rewriting the solution in trigonometric form.

In this second-order case, this condition on the eigenvalues can be shown<ref>Papanicolaou, Vassilis, \"On the asymptotic stability of a class of linear difference equations,\" ''Mathematics Magazine'' 69(1), February 1996, 34&ndash;43.</ref> to be equivalent to |''A''|&nbsp;<&nbsp;1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2, which is equivalent to |''B''|&nbsp;<&nbsp;1 and |''A''|&nbsp;<&nbsp;1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''B''.\n\nThe equation in the above example was [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]], in that there was no constant term.  If one starts with the non-homogeneous recurrence\n\n:<math>b_{n}=Ab_{n-1}+Bb_{n-2}+K</math>\n\nwith constant term ''K'', this can be converted into homogeneous form as follows:  The [[steady state]] is found by setting ''b<sub>n</sub>'' =&nbsp;''b''<sub>''n''−1</sub> =&nbsp;''b''<sub>''n''−2</sub> =&nbsp;''b''* to obtain\n\n:<math> b^{*} = \\frac{K}{1-A-B}.</math>\n\nThen the non-homogeneous recurrence can be rewritten in homogeneous form as\n\n:<math>[b_n - b^*]=A[b_{n-1}-b^*]+B[b_{n-2}-b^*],</math>\n\nwhich can be solved as above.\n\nThe stability condition stated above in terms of eigenvalues for the second-order case remains valid for the general ''n''<sup>th</sup>-order case:  the equation is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the characteristic equation are less than one in absolute value.\n\nGiven a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients of order ''d'', let ''p''(''t'') be the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also \"auxiliary polynomial\")\n\n:<math>t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\\cdots-c_{d} = 0 </math>\n\nsuch that each ''c<sub>i</sub>'' corresponds to each ''c<sub>i</sub>'' in the original recurrence relation (see the general form above). Suppose &lambda; is a root of ''p''(''t'') having [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] ''r''. This is to say that (''t''−λ)<sup>''r''</sup> divides ''p''(''t'').

However, the values ''a<sub>n</sub>'' from the original recurrence relation used do not usually have to be contiguous: excluding exceptional cases, just ''d'' of them are needed (i.e., for an original homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 3 one could use the values ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>4</sub>).  This process will produce a linear system of ''d'' equations with ''d'' unknowns. Solving these equations for the unknown coefficients <math>b_1, b_2, \\dots,b_d </math> of the general solution and plugging these values back into the general solution will produce the particular solution to the original recurrence relation that fits the original recurrence relation's initial conditions (as well as all subsequent values <math>a_0,a_1,a_2,\\dots</math> of the original recurrence relation).\n\nThe method for solving linear [[differential equations]] is similar to the method above—the \"intelligent guess\" ([[ansatz]]) for linear differential equations with constant coefficients is ''e''<sup>λ''x''</sup> where λ is a complex number that is determined by substituting the guess into the differential equation.\n\nThis is not a coincidence.  Considering the [[Taylor series]] of the solution to a linear differential equation:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infin \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n</math>\n\nit can be seen that the coefficients of the series are given by the ''n''<sup>th</sup> derivative of ''f''(''x'') evaluated at the point ''a''.

Another method to solve a non-homogeneous recurrence is the method of ''symbolic differentiation''.  For example, consider the following recurrence:\n\n:<math>a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 1</math>\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous recurrence.  If we substitute ''n'' ↦ ''n''+1, we obtain the recurrence\n\n:<math>a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + 1</math>\n\nSubtracting the original recurrence from this equation yields\n\n:<math>a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_{n}</math>\n\nor equivalently\n\n:<math>a_{n+2} = 2 a_{n+1} - a_n</math>\n\nThis is a homogeneous recurrence, which can be solved by the methods explained above.  In general, if a linear recurrence has the form\n\n:<math> a_{n+k} = \\lambda_{k-1} a_{n+k-1} + \\lambda_{k-2} a_{n+k-2} + \\cdots + \\lambda_1 a_{n+1} + \\lambda_0 a_{n} + p(n) </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_{k-1}</math> are constant coefficients and ''p''(''n'') is the inhomogeneity, then if ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial with degree ''r'', then this non-homogeneous recurrence can be reduced to a homogeneous recurrence by applying the method of symbolic differencing ''r'' times.\n\nIf\n:<math>P(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p_n x^n</math>\nis the generating function of the inhomogeneity, the generating function\n:<math>A(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a(n) x^n</math>\nof the non-homogeneous recurrence \n:<math> a_n = \\sum_{i=1}^s c_i a_{n-i}+p_n,\\quad n\\ge n_r,</math>\nwith constant coefficients {{math|c<sub>i</sub>}} is derived from\n:<math> \\left (1-\\sum_{i=1}^sc_ix^i \\right )A(x)=P(x)+\\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-1}[a_n-p_n]x^n-\\sum_{i=1}^s c_ix^i\\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-i-1}a_nx^n.</math>\nIf ''P''(''x'') is a rational generating function, ''A''(''x'') is also one. The case discussed above, where ''p<sub>n</sub>'' = ''K'' is a constant, emerges as one example of this formula, with ''P''(''x'') = ''K''/(1−''x''). Another example, the recurrence <math>a_n=10 a_{n-1}+n</math> with linear inhomogeneity, arises in the definition of the [[schizophrenic number]]s.

For example, the solution to\n\n:<math>J_{n+1}=\\frac{2n}{z}J_n-J_{n-1}</math>\n\nis given by\n\n:<math>J_n=J_n(z), </math>\n\nthe [[Bessel function]], while\n\n:<math>(b-n)M_{n-1} +(2n-b-z)M_n - nM_{n+1}=0 </math>\n\nis solved by\n\n:<math>M_n=M(n,b;z) </math>\n\nthe [[confluent hypergeometric series]]. Sequences which are the solutions of [[P-recursive equation|linear difference equations with polynomial coefficients]] are called [[Holonomic function|P-recursive]]. For these specific recurrence equations algorithms are known which find [[Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations|polynomial]], [[Abramov's algorithm|rational]] or [[Petkovšek's algorithm|hypergeometric]] solutions.\n\n===Solving first-order rational difference equations===\n{{Main|Rational difference equation}}\n\nA first order rational difference equation has the form <math>w_{t+1} = \\tfrac{aw_t+b}{cw_t+d}</math>. Such an equation can be solved by writing <math>w_t</math> as a nonlinear transformation of another variable <math>x_t</math> which itself evolves linearly.  Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in <math>x_t</math>.\n\n==Stability==\n\n===Stability of linear higher-order recurrences===\nThe linear recurrence of order ''d'',\n\n:<math>a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\\cdots+c_da_{n-d},  </math>\n\nhas the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]\n\n:<math>\\lambda^d - c_1 \\lambda^{d-1} - c_2 \\lambda^{d-2} - \\cdots - c_d \\lambda^0 =0. </math>\n\nThe recurrence is [[Stability theory|stable]], meaning that the iterates converge asymptotically to a fixed value, if and only if the [[eigenvalues]] (i.e., the roots of the characteristic equation), whether real or complex, are all less than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value.\n\n===Stability of linear first-order matrix recurrences===\n{{Main|Matrix difference equation}}\n\nIn the first-order matrix difference equation\n\n:<math>[x_t - x^*] = A[x_{t-1}-x^*]</math>\n\nwith state vector ''x'' and transition matrix ''A'', ''x'' converges asymptotically to the steady state vector ''x''* if and only if all eigenvalues of the transition matrix ''A'' (whether real or complex) have an [[absolute value]] which is less than&nbsp;1.\n\n===Stability of nonlinear first-order recurrences===\nConsider the nonlinear first-order recurrence\n\n:<math>x_n=f(x_{n-1}).</math>\n\nThis recurrence is [[stability theory|locally stable]], meaning that it [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to a fixed point ''x''* from points sufficiently close to ''x''*, if the slope of ''f''  in the neighborhood of ''x''* is smaller than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value:  that is,\n\n: <math>| f' (x^*) | < 1. </math>\n\nA nonlinear recurrence could have multiple fixed points, in which case some fixed points may be locally stable and others locally unstable; for continuous ''f''  two adjacent fixed points cannot both be locally stable.\n\nA nonlinear recurrence relation could also have a cycle of period ''k'' for ''k'' > 1.  Such a cycle is stable, meaning that it attracts a set of initial conditions of positive measure, if the composite function\n\n:<math>g(x) := f \\circ f \\circ \\cdots \\circ f(x)</math>\n\nwith ''f'' appearing ''k'' times is locally stable according to the same criterion:\n\n: <math>| g' (x^*) | < 1,</math>\n\nwhere ''x''* is any point on the cycle.\n\nIn a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] recurrence relation, the variable ''x'' stays in a bounded region but never converges to a fixed point or an attracting cycle; any fixed points or cycles of the equation are unstable.  See also [[logistic map]], [[dyadic transformation]], and [[tent map]].\n\n== Relationship to differential equations ==\nWhen solving an [[ordinary differential equation]] [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerically]], one typically encounters a recurrence relation. For example, when solving the [[initial value problem]]\n\n:<math>y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \\ \\ y(t_0)=y_0,</math>\n\nwith [[Euler's method]] and a step size ''h'', one calculates the values\n\n:<math>y_0=y(t_0), \\ \\ y_1=y(t_0+h), \\ \\ y_2=y(t_0+2h), \\ \\dots</math>\n\nby the recurrence\n\n:<math>\\, y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n). </math>\n\nSystems of linear first order differential equations can be discretized exactly analytically using the methods shown in the [[discretization]] article.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Biology ===\nSome of the best-known difference equations have their origins in the attempt to model [[population]] dynamics. For example, the [[Fibonacci number]]s were once used as a model for the growth of a rabbit population.\n\nThe [[logistic map]] is used either directly to model population growth, or as a starting point for more detailed models of [[population dynamics]]. In this context, coupled difference equations are often used to model the interaction of two or more populations. For example, the Nicholson-Bailey model for a host-[[parasite]] interaction is given by\n\n:<math>N_{t+1} = \\lambda N_t e^{-aP_t} </math>\n:<math>P_{t+1} = N_t(1-e^{-aP_t}), </math>\n\nwith ''N''<sub>''t''</sub> representing the hosts, and ''P''<sub>''t''</sub> the parasites, at time&nbsp;''t''.\n\n[[Integrodifference equation]]s are a form of recurrence relation important to spatial [[ecology]]. These and other difference equations are particularly suited to modeling [[voltinism|univoltine]] populations.\n\n===Computer science===\nRecurrence relations are also of fundamental importance in [[analysis of algorithms]].<ref>Cormen, T. et al, ''Introduction to Algorithms'', MIT Press, 2009</ref><ref>R. Sedgewick, F. Flajolet, ''An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms'', Addison-Wesley, 2013</ref> If an [[algorithm]] is designed so that it will break a problem into smaller subproblems ([[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]), its running time is described by a recurrence relation.\n\nA simple example is the time an algorithm takes to find an element in an ordered vector with <math>n</math> elements,  in the worst case.\n\nA naive algorithm will search from left to right, one element at a time. The worst possible scenario is when the required element is the last, so the number of comparisons is <math>n</math>.\n\nA better algorithm is called [[Binary search algorithm|binary search]]. However, it requires a sorted vector. It will first check if the element is at the middle of the vector. If not, then it will check if the middle element is greater or lesser than the sought element. At this point, half of the vector can be discarded, and the algorithm can be run again on the other half. The number of comparisons will be given by\n\n:<math>c_1=1</math>\n:<math>c_n=1+c_{n/2}</math>\n\nthe [[Time complexity|time complexity]] of which will be <math>O(\\log_2(n))</math>.\n\n=== Digital signal processing ===\nIn [[digital signal processing]], recurrence relations can model feedback in a system, where outputs at one time become inputs for future time. They thus arise in [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) [[digital filter]]s.\n\nFor example, the equation for a \"feedforward\" IIR [[comb filter]] of delay ''T'' is:\n\n:<math>y_t = (1 - \\alpha) x_t + \\alpha y_{t - T}</math>\n\nWhere <math>x_t</math> is the input at time ''t'', <math>y_t</math> is the output at time ''t'', and α controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the output.  From this we can see that\n\n:<math>y_t = (1 - \\alpha) x_t + \\alpha ((1-\\alpha) x_{t-T} + \\alpha y_{t - 2T})</math>\n:<math>y_t = (1 - \\alpha) x_t + (\\alpha-\\alpha^2) x_{t-T}  + \\alpha^2 y_{t - 2T})</math>\n\netc.\n\n===Economics===\nRecurrence relations, especially linear recurrence relations, are used extensively in both theoretical and empirical economics.<ref>{{cite book |first=Nancy L. |last=Stokey |authorlink=Nancy Stokey |first2=Robert E., Jr. |last2=Lucas |authorlink2=Robert Lucas, Jr. |first3=Edward C. |last3=Prescott |authorlink3=Edward C.

      "text": "In [[computer algebra]], a '''regular chain''' is a particular kind of triangular set in a multivariate polynomial ring over a field. It enhances the notion of [[Wu's method of characteristic set|characteristic set]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nGiven a [[System of linear equations|linear system]], one can convert it to a [[Triangular matrix|triangular system]] via [[Gaussian elimination]]. For the non-linear case, given a [[System of polynomial equations|polynomial system]] F over a field, one can convert (decompose or triangularize) it to a finite set of triangular sets, in the sense that the [[algebraic variety]] ''V''(F) is described by these triangular sets.\n\nA triangular set may merely describe the empty set. To fix this degenerated case, the notion of regular chain was introduced, independently by Kalkbrener (1993), Yang and Zhang (1994). Regular chains also appear in Chou and Gao (1992). Regular chains are special triangular sets which are used in different algorithms for computing unmixed-dimensional decompositions of algebraic varieties. Without using factorization, these decompositions have better properties that the ones produced by [[Wu's method|Wu's algorithm]]. Kalkbrener's original definition was based on the following observation: every irreducible variety is uniquely determined by one of its [[generic point]]s and varieties can be represented by describing the generic points of their irreducible components. These generic points are given by regular chains.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nDenote '''Q''' the rational number field. In '''Q'''[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>] with variable ordering x<sub>1</sub> < x<sub>2</sub> < x<sub>3</sub>,\n: <math>T = \\{ x_2^2-x_1^2, x_2(x_3-x_1)\\}</math>\nis a triangular set and also a regular chain. Two generic points given by ''T'' are (a, a, a) and (a, -a, a) where ''a'' is transcendental over '''Q'''.\nThus there are two irreducible components, given by { x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>3</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> } and { x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>3</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> }, respectively.\nNote that: (1) the [[content (algebra)|content]] of the second polynomial is x<sub>2</sub>, which does not contribute to the generic points represented and thus can be removed; (2) the [[dimension]] of each component is 1, the number of free variables in the regular chain.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\n\nThe variables in the polynomial ring \n:<math>R = k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</math> \nare always sorted as x<sub>1</sub> < ... < x<sub>n</sub>. \nA non-constant polynomial ''f'' in  <math>R</math> can be seen as a univariate polynomial in its greatest variable.\nThe greatest variable in ''f'' is called its main variable, denoted by ''mvar''(f). Let ''u'' be \nthe main variable of ''f'' and write it as \n:<math>f = a_eu^e + \\cdots + a_0</math>, \nwhere ''e'' is the degree of ''f'' w.r.t. ''u''  and <math>a_e</math> is \nthe leading coefficient of ''f'' w.r.t. ''u''.  Then the initial of ''f''\nis <math>a_e</math> and ''e'' is its main degree.\n\n*Triangular set\n\nA non-empty subset ''T'' of <math>R</math> is a triangular set, \nif the polynomials in ''T'' are non-constant and have distinct main variables. \nHence, a triangular set is finite, and has cardinality at most ''n''.\n\n*Regular chain\n\nLet T = {t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>s</sub>} be a triangular set such that \n''mvar''(t<sub>1</sub>) < ... < ''mvar''(t<sub>s</sub>), \n<math>h_i</math> be the initial of ''t''<sub>i</sub> and ''h'' be the product of h<sub>i</sub>'s. \nThen ''T'' is a ''regular chain'' if \n: <math>\\mathrm{resultant}(h, T) = \n\\mathrm{resultant}(\\cdots(\\mathrm{resultant}(h, t_s),\\ldots, t_i)\\cdots)\\neq 0</math>, \nwhere each [[resultant]] is computed with respect to the main variable of ''t''<sub>i</sub>, respectively.  \nThis definition is from Yang and Zhang, which is of much algorithmic flavor.\n\n*Quasi-component and saturated ideal of a regular chain\n\nThe ''quasi-component'' ''W''(''T'') described by the regular chain ''T'' is \n:<math>W(T)=V(T)\\setminus V(h)</math>, that is,\nthe set difference of the varieties ''V''(''T'') and ''V''(''h''). \nThe attached algebraic object of a regular chain is its ''saturated ideal'' \n:<math>\\mathrm{sat}(T)=(T):h^\\infty</math>. \nA classic result is that the [[Zariski closure]] of ''W''(''T'') equals the variety defined by sat(''T''), that is,\n:<math>\\overline{W(T)}=V(\\mathrm{sat}(T))</math>,\nand its dimension is n - |T|, the difference of the number of variables and the number of polynomials in ''T''.\n\n*Triangular decompositions\n\nIn general, there are two ways to decompose a polynomial system ''F''. The first one is to decompose lazily, that is, only to represent its [[generic point]]s in the (Kalkbrener) sense,\n: <math>\\sqrt{(F)}=\\cap_{i=1}^{e}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{sat}(T_i)}</math>.\nThe second is to describe all zeroes in the [[Daniel Lazard|Lazard]] sense,\n: <math>V(F)=\\cup_{i=1}^{e}W(T_i)</math>.\nThere are various algorithms available for triangular decompositions in either sense.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nLet ''T'' be a regular chain in the polynomial ring ''R''.\n\n* The saturated ideal sat(''T'') is an ''unmixed ideal'' with dimension n − |''T''|.\n* A regular chain holds a strong elimination property in the sense that:\n: <math> \\mathrm{sat}(T \\cap k[x_1, \\ldots , x_i]) = \\mathrm{sat}(T) \\cap k[x_1,\\ldots , x_i] </math>.\n\n* A polynomial ''p'' is in sat(''T'') if and only if p is pseudo-reduced to zero by ''T'', that is,\n: <math>p\\in\\mathrm{sat}(T)\\iff \\mathrm{prem}(p, T)=0</math>.\n:Hence the membership test for sat(''T'') is algorithmic.\n\n* A polynomial p is a '''[[zero-divisor]]''' modulo sat(''T'') if and only if <math>\\mathrm{prem}(p, T)\\neq0</math> and <math>\\mathrm{resultant}(p, T)=0</math>.\n:Hence the regularity test for sat(''T'') is algorithmic.\n\n* Given a prime ideal ''P'', there exists a regular chain ''C'' such that ''P'' = sat(''C'').\n* If the first element of a regular chain ''C'' is an irreducible polynomial and the others are linear in their main variable, then sat(''C'') is a prime ideal.\n* Conversely, if ''P'' is a prime ideal, then, after almost all linear changes of variables, there exists a regular chain ''C'' of the preceding shape such that ''P'' = sat(''C'').\n* A triangular set is a regular chain if and only if it is a [[Wu's method of characteristic set#Ritt characteristic set|Ritt characteristic set]] of its saturated ideal.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Wu's method of characteristic set]]\n*[[Gröbner basis]]\n*[[Regular semi-algebraic system]]\n*[[Triangular decomposition]]\n\n== Further references ==\n\n* P.

In the general case, one simply has to find the roots of the depressed polynomial {{math|''P''(''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''a''<sub>3</sub>/4)}}. For each root&nbsp;{{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} of this polynomial, {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;−&nbsp;''a''<sub>3</sub>/4}} is a root of&nbsp;{{math|''P''(''x'')}}.\n\n===Factoring quartic polynomials===\nIf a quartic polynomial {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|reducible]] in {{math|''k''[''x'']}}, then it is the product of two quadratic polynomials or the product of a linear polynomial by a cubic polynomial. This second possibility occurs if and only if {{math|''P''(''x'')}} has a root in&nbsp;{{math|''k''}}. In order to determine whether or not {{math|''P''(''x'')}} can be expressed as the product of two quadratic polynomials, let us assume, for simplicity, that {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is a depressed polynomial. Then it was seen [[#Third definition|above]] that if the resolvent cubic {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>(''y'')}} has a non-null root of the form {{math|''α''<sup>2</sup>}}, for some {{math|''α''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''k''}}, then such a decomposition exists.\n\nThis can be used to prove that, in {{math|'''R'''[''x'']}}, every quartic polynomial without real roots can be expressed as the product of two quadratic polynomials. Let {{math|''P''(''x'')}} be such a polynomial. We can assume [[without loss of generality]] that {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is monic. We can also assume without loss of generality that it is a reduced polynomial, because {{math|''P''(''x'')}} can be expressed as the product of two quadratic polynomials if and only if {{math|''P''(''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''a''<sub>3</sub>/4)}} can and this polynomial is a reduced one. Then {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>(''y'')}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|''y''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''a''<sub>2</sub>''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''a''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;4''a''<sub>0</sub>)''y''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>}}. There are two cases:\n* If {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0}} then {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>(0)}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|−''a''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<&nbsp;0}}. Since {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>(''y'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} if {{math|''y''}} is large enough, then, by the [[intermediate value theorem]], {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>(''y'')}} has a root {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>}} with {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}}. So, we can take {{math|''α''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|{{sqrt|''y''<sub>0</sub>}}}}.\n* If {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|0}}, then {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>(''y'')}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{math|''y''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''a''<sub>2</sub>''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''a''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;4''a''<sub>0</sub>)''y''}}. The roots of this polynomial are&nbsp;{{math|0}} and the roots of the quadratic polynomial&nbsp;{{math|''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''a''<sub>2</sub>''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;4''a''<sub>0</sub>}}.

Denote by <math>A_k(n, r)</math> the homogeneous polynomials of degree <math>r</math>. Elements of <math>A_k(n, r)</math> are ''k''-linear combinations of monomials formed by multiplying together <math>r</math> of the generators <math>x_{ij}</math> (allowing repetition). Thus\n\n: <math>k[x_{ij}] = \\bigoplus_{r\\ge 0} A_k(n, r).</math>\n\nNow, <math>k[x_{ij}]</math> has a natural [[coalgebra]] structure with comultiplication <math>\\Delta</math> and counit <math>\\varepsilon</math> the algebra homomorphisms given on generators by\n\n: <math> \\Delta(x_{ij}) = \\textstyle\\sum_l x_{il} \\otimes x_{lj}, \\quad \\varepsilon(x_{ij}) = \\delta_{ij}\\quad</math>  &nbsp;&nbsp;  ([[Kronecker delta|Kronecker's delta]]).\n\nSince comultiplication is an algebra homomorphism, <math>k[x_{ij}]</math> is a [[bialgebra]].

To see this, let \n: <math>\\Delta(a) = \\textstyle \\sum a_i \\otimes b_i</math>\nand, given linear functionals <math>f</math>, <math>g</math> on <math>A</math>, define their product to be the linear functional given by \n: <math>\\textstyle a \\mapsto \\sum f(a_i) g(b_i).</math>\nThe identity element for this multiplication of functionals is the counit in <math>A</math>.\n\n== Main properties ==\n\n* One of the most basic properties expresses <math>S_k(n,r)</math> as a centralizer algebra.

      "text": "A '''spherical design''', part of [[combinatorial design]] theory in [[mathematics]], is a finite set of ''N'' points on the ''d''-dimensional unit [[n-sphere|''d''-sphere]] ''S<sup>d</sup>'' such that the average value of any polynomial ''f'' of degree ''t'' or less on the set equals the average value of ''f'' on the whole sphere (that is, the integral of ''f'' over ''S<sup>d</sup>'' divided by the area or [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] of ''S<sup>d</sup>'').  Such a set is often called a '''spherical''' ''t''-'''design''' to indicate the value of ''t'', which is a fundamental parameter.\n\nSpherical designs can be of value in [[approximation theory]], in [[statistics]] for [[experimental design]] (being usable to construct [[rotatable design]]s), in [[combinatorics]], and in [[geometry]].  The main problem is to find examples, given ''d'' and ''t'', that are not too large; however, such examples may be hard to come by.\nSpherical t-designs have also recently been appropriated in [[quantum mechanics]] in the form of [[quantum t-designs]] with various applications to [[quantum information theory]], [[quantum computing]] and [[POVM]]s.\n\nThe concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel (1977). \n\n== Spherical designs in the circle ==\n\nThe existence and structure of spherical designs with ''d'' = 1 (that is, in a circle) were studied in depth by Hong (1982).\n\n== Spherical designs in any dimension ==\n\nShortly thereafter, Seymour and Zaslavsky (1984) proved that such designs exist of all sufficiently large sizes; that is, given positive integers ''n'' and ''t'', there is a number ''N''(''d'',''t'') such that for every ''N'' &ge; ''N''(''d'',''t'') there exists a spherical ''t''-design of ''N'' points in dimension ''d''.  However, their proof gave no idea of how big ''N''(''d'',''t'') is.  Good estimates for that were found later on.  Besides these \"large\" sizes, there are many sporadic small spherical designs; many of them are related to finite [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]s on the sphere and are of great interest in themselves.\n\nRecently, Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Viazovska obtained the asymptotic upper bound\n<math> N(d,t)<C_d t^d</math> for all positive integers ''d'' and&nbsp;''t''.  This is optimal except that the value of ''C<sub>d</sub>'' is unknown.\n\n== 2-dimensional spherical design ==\n{{main | geodesic grid }}\n\nSpherical designs with ''d'' = 2 (that is, on the surface of a sphere) ...\n\nOne application of spherical designs is for whole-sphere data collection.\nSpherical t-designs meet the \"accurately approximate integrals by sums\" criteria for \"good\" pixelizations of the sphere.<ref>\n[http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-4357/470/2/L81/5407.text.html \"An Icosahedron-based Method for Pixelizing the Celestial Sphere\"]\nby Max Tegmark 1996\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Thomson problem]]\n\n==External links==\n* Spherical t-designs for different values of  ''N'' and ''t'' can be found precomputed at [http://neilsloane.com/sphdesigns/ Neil Sloane's website].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Bondarenko | first1 = Andriy | author1-link = Andriy Bondarenko\n | last2 = Radchenko | first2 = Danylo\n | last3 = Viazovska | first3 = Maryna | author3-link = Maryna Viazovska\n | arxiv = 1009.4407\n | doi = 10.4007/annals.2013.178.2.2\n | issue = 2\n | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]]\n | mr = 3071504\n | pages = 443–452\n | series = Second Series\n | title = Optimal asymptotic bounds for spherical designs\n | volume = 178\n | year = 2013}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Delsarte | first1 = P.\n | last2 = Goethals | first2 = J.

Each block represents one unit, {{math|1&sdot;1}}, and the entire square represents {{math|5&sdot;5}}, or the area of the square.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''square''' is the result of [[multiplication|multiplying]] a [[number]] by itself. The verb \"to square\" is used to denote this operation. Squaring is the same as [[exponentiation|raising to]] the power&nbsp;[[2 (number)|2]], and is denoted by a [[superscript]] 2; for instance, the square of 3 may be written as 3<sup>2</sup>, which is the number 9.\nIn some cases when superscripts are not available, as for instance in [[programming language]]s or [[plain text]] files, the notations <kbd>''x''^2</kbd> or <kbd>''x''**2</kbd> may be used in place of <kbd>''x''<sup>2</sup></kbd>.\n\nThe adjective which corresponds to squaring is ''[[wikt:quadratic|quadratic]]''.\n\nThe square of an [[integer]] may also be called a [[square number]] or a perfect square. In [[algebra]], the operation of squaring is often generalized to [[polynomial]]s, other [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or values in systems of mathematical values other than the numbers. For instance, the square of the [[linear function (calculus)|linear polynomial]] {{math|''x'' + 1}} is the [[quadratic polynomial]] {{math|1=(''x''+1)<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>2</sup> + 2''x'' + 1}}.\n\nOne of the important properties of squaring, for numbers as well as in many other mathematical systems, is that (for all numbers {{mvar|x}}), the square of {{mvar|x}} is the same as the square of its [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''x''}}. That is,  the square function satisfies the identity {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> = (−''x'')<sup>2</sup>}}. This can also be expressed by saying that the square function is an [[even function]].\n\n== In real numbers ==\n[[Image:Parabola2.svg|thumb|240px|The graph of the square function {{math|1=''y'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is a [[parabola]].]]\nThe squaring operation defines a [[real function]] called the '''{{vanchor|square function}}''' or the '''{{vanchor|squaring function}}'''. Its [[domain of a function|domain]] is the whole [[real line]], and its [[image (function)|image]] is the set of nonnegative real numbers.\n\nThe square function preserves the order of positive numbers: larger numbers have larger squares. In other words, the square is a [[monotonic function]] on the interval {{closed-open|0, +∞}}. On the negative numbers, numbers with greater absolute value have greater squares, so the square is a monotonically decreasing function on {{open-closed|−∞,0}}. Hence, [[zero]] is the (global) [[minimum]] of the square function.\nThe square {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}} of a number {{math|''x''}} is less than {{mvar|x}} (that is {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> < ''x''}}) if and only if {{math|0 < ''x'' < 1}}, that is, if {{mvar|x}} belongs to the [[open interval]] {{open-open|0,1}}. This implies that the square of an integer is never less than the original number {{mvar|x}}.\n\nEvery positive [[real number]] is the square of exactly two numbers, one of which is strictly positive and the other of which is strictly negative. Zero is the square of only one number, itself. For this reason, it is possible to define the [[square root]] function, which associates with a non-negative real number the non-negative number whose square is the original number.\n\nNo square root can be taken of a negative number within the system of [[real number]]s, because squares of all real numbers are [[non-negative]]. The lack of real square roots for the negative numbers can be used to expand the real number system to the [[complex number]]s, by postulating the [[imaginary unit]] {{mvar|i}}, which is one of the square roots of&nbsp;&minus;1.\n\nThe property \"every non-negative real number is a square\" has been generalized to the notion of a [[real closed field]], which is an [[ordered field]] such that every non-negative element is a square and every polynomial of odd degree has a root. The real closed fields cannot be distinguished from the field of real numbers by their algebraic properties: every property of the real numbers, which may be expressed in [[first-order logic]] (that is expressed by a formula in which the variables that are quantified by ∀ or ∃ represent elements, not sets), is true for every real closed field, and conversely every property of the first-order logic, which is true for a specific real closed field is also true for the real numbers.\n\n== In geometry ==\nThere are several major uses of the square function in geometry.\n\nThe name of the square function shows its importance in the definition of the [[area]]:  it comes from the fact that the area of a [[square]] with sides of length &nbsp;{{mvar|l}} is equal to {{math|''l''<sup>2</sup>}}. The area depends quadratically on the size: the area of a shape {{mvar|n}}&nbsp;times larger is {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}&nbsp;times greater. This holds for areas in three dimensions as well as in the plane: for instance, the surface area of a [[sphere]] is proportional to the square of its radius, a fact that is manifested physically by the [[inverse-square law]] describing how the strength of physical forces such as gravity varies according to distance.\n\n{{anchor|r²}}[[Image:Zonenplatte Cosinus.png|thumb|right|Fresnel's [[zone plate]]s have rings with [[arithmetic progression|equally spaced]] squared distances to the center]]\nThe square function is related to [[distance]] through the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and its generalization, the [[parallelogram law]]. [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] distance is not a [[smooth function]]: the [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] of distance from a fixed point forms a [[cone]], with a non-smooth point at the tip of the cone. However, the square of the distance (denoted {{math|''d''<sup>2</sup>}} or {{math|''r''<sup>2</sup>}}), which has a [[paraboloid]] as its graph, is a smooth and [[analytic function]]. The [[dot product]] of a [[Euclidean vector]] with itself is equal to the square of its length: {{math|1='''v'''&sdot;'''v''' = v<sup>2</sup>}}. This is further generalised to [[quadratic form]]s in [[linear space]]s. The [[inertia tensor]] in [[mechanics]] is an example of a quadratic form. It demonstrates a quadratic relation of the [[moment of inertia]] to the size ([[length]]).\n\nThere are infinitely many [[Pythagorean triple]]s, sets of three positive integers such that the sum of the squares of the first two equals the square of the third. Each of these triples gives the integer sides of a right triangle.\n\n==In abstract algebra and number theory==\nThe square function is defined in any [[field (mathematics)|field]] or [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. An element in the image of this function is called a ''square'', and the inverse images of a square are called ''[[square root]]s''.\n\nThe notion of squaring is particularly important in the [[finite field]]s  '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' formed by the numbers modulo an odd [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}}. A non-zero element of this field is called a [[quadratic residue]] if it is a square in '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''', and otherwise, it is called a quadratic non-residue. Zero, while a square, is not considered to be a quadratic residue. Every finite field of this type has exactly {{math|(''p'' − 1)/2}} quadratic residues and exactly {{math|(''p'' − 1)/2}} quadratic non-residues. The quadratic residues form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in [[number theory]].\n\nMore generally, in rings, the square function may have different properties that are sometimes used to classify rings.\n\nZero may be the square of some non-zero elements. A [[commutative ring]] such that the square of a non zero element is never zero is called a [[reduced ring]]. More generally, in a commutative ring, a [[radical ideal]] is an ideal&nbsp;{{mvar|I}} such that <math>x^2 \\in I</math> implies <math>x \\in I</math>. Both notions are important in [[algebraic geometry]], because of [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].\n\nAn element of a ring that is equal to its own square is called an [[idempotent]]. In any ring, 0 and 1 are idempotents. {{anchor|integral domains}}There are no other idempotents in fields and more generally in [[integral domain]]s. However, \nthe ring of the integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} has [[power of two|{{math|2<sup>''k''</sup>}}]] idempotents, where {{mvar|k}} is the number of distinct [[integer factorization|prime factors]] of&nbsp;{{mvar|n}}.\nA commutative ring in which every element is equal to its square (every element is idempotent) is called a [[Boolean ring]]; an example from [[computer science]] is the ring whose elements are [[binary number]]s, with [[Bitwise operation|bitwise AND]] as the multiplication operation and bitwise XOR as the addition operation.\n\nIn a [[supercommutative algebra]] ([[away from 2]]), the square of any ''odd'' element equals to zero.\n\nIf ''A'' is a [[commutative property|commutative]] [[semigroup]], then one has\n:<math>\\forall x, y \\isin A \\quad (xy)^2 = xy xy = xx yy = x^2 y^2  .</math>\nIn the language of [[quadratic form]]s, this equality says that the square function is a \"form permitting composition\". In fact, the square function is the foundation upon which other quadratic forms are constructed which also permit composition. The procedure was introduced by [[L. E. Dickson]] to produce the [[octonion]]s out of [[quaternion]]s by doubling. The doubling method was formalized by [[A. A. Albert]] who started with the [[real number]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] ℝ and the square function, doubling it to obtain the [[complex number]] field with quadratic form x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>, and then doubling again to obtain quaternions. The doubling procedure is called the [[Cayley–Dickson process]] and the structures produced are [[composition algebra]]s.\n\nThe square function can be used with ℂ as the start for another use of the Cayley–Dickson process leading to bicomplex, biquaternion, and bioctonion composition algebras.\n\n==In complex numbers and related algebras over the reals==\n{{anchor|In complex analysis}}\n{{see also|Exponentiation #Powers of complex numbers}}\nThe [[complex numbers|complex]] square function&nbsp;{{math|''z''<sup>2</sup>}} is a twofold cover of the [[complex plane]], such that each non-zero complex number has exactly two square roots. This map is related to [[parabolic coordinates]].<!-- unfortunately, incompatible coefficients and orientation conventions hinder a simple explanation such as σ+iτ → (σ,τ)-parabolic -->\n\n== Other uses ==\nSquares are ubiquitous in algebra, more generally, in almost every branch of mathematics, and also in [[physics]] where many [[unit of measurement|units]] are defined using squares and [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] squares: see [[#Related physical quantities|below]].\n\n[[Least squares]] is the standard method used with [[overdetermined system]]s.\n\nSquaring is used in [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]] in determining the [[standard deviation]] of a set of values, or a [[random variable]].

On the other hand, the category '''Ste''' is so wide, and the tools for creating new spaces in '''Ste''' are so diverse, that this suggests the idea that all the results of functional analysis can be reformulated inside the stereotype theory without essential losses. On this way one can even try to completely replace the category of locally convex spaces in analysis (and in related areas) by the category '''Ste''' of stereotype spaces with the view of possible simplifications – this program was announced by S. Akbarov in 2005{{sfn|Akbarov|2005}} and the following results can be considered as evidences of its reasonableness:\n\n:* In the theory of stereotype spaces the approximation property is inherited by the spaces of operators and by tensor products. This allows to reduce the list of counterexamples in comparison with the Banach theory, where as is known the space of operators does not inherit the approximation property.{{sfn|Szankowski|1981}}\n:*\n:* The arising theory of stereotype algebras allows to simplify constructions in the duality theories for non-commutative groups. In particular, the [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|group algebras]] (and their [[Envelope (category theory)|envelopes]] in the necessary cases) in these theories become [[Hopf algebra]]s in the standard algebraic sense.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=278}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} \n:*\n:* This in its turn leads to a family of generalizations of the [[Pontryagin duality]] based on the notion of [[Envelope (category theory)|envelope]]: the  holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous envelopes of stereotype algebras give rise respectively to the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous dualities in ''big geometric disciplines'' – [[complex geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[topology]] – for certain classes of (not necessarily commutative) topological groups considered in these disciplines ([[affine algebraic group]]s, and some classes of [[Lie group]]s and Moore groups).{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stereotype algebra]]\n*[[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|Stereotype group algebra]]\n*[[Reflexive space]]\n*[[Duality (mathematics)]]\n*[[Pontryagin duality]]\n*[[Envelope (category theory)]]\n*[[Refinement (category theory)]]\n*[[Brauner space]]\n*[[Smith space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{nlab|id=stereotype+space|title=Stereotype space}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Onishchik|first=A.L.|title=Pontrjagin duality|journal=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|year=1984|volume=4|pages=481–482|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Pontryagin_duality|isbn=978-1402006098| ref = harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=M.F.|title=The Pontrjagin duality theorem in linear spaces|journal=Annals of Mathematics|year=1952|volume=56|issue=2|pages=248–253|doi=10.2307/1969798|jstor=1969798| ref = harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Brudovski|first=B.S.|title=On k- and c-reflexivity of locally convex vector spaces|journal=Lithuanian Mathematical Journal|year=1967|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17–21| ref = harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Waterhouse|first=W.C.|title=Dual groups of vector spaces|journal=Pac.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-line_program",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[Computer algebra system|computational algebra]], a '''straight-line program''' ('''SLP''') for a finite group ''G'' =&nbsp;&lang;''S''&rang; is a  finite sequence ''L'' of elements of ''G'' such that every element of ''L'' either belongs to ''S'', is the inverse of a preceding element, or the product of two preceding elements. An SLP ''L'' is said to ''compute'' a group element ''g''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G'' if ''g''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''L'', where ''g'' is encoded by a word in ''S'' and its inverses.\n\nIntuitively, an SLP computing some ''g''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G'' is  an ''efficient'' way of storing ''g'' as a group word over ''S''; observe that if ''g'' is constructed in ''i'' steps, the word length of ''g'' may be exponential in ''i'', but the length of the corresponding SLP is linear in&nbsp;''i''. This has important applications in [[computational group theory]], by using SLPs to efficiently encode group elements as words over a given generating set.\n\nStraight-line programs were introduced by Babai and Szemerédi in 1984<ref>Babai, László, and Endre Szemerédi. \"On the complexity of matrix group problems I.\" Foundations of Computer Science, 1984. 25th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, 1984</ref> as a tool for studying the computational complexity of certain matrix group properties. Babai and Szemerédi prove that every element of a finite group ''G'' has an SLP of length ''O''(log<sup>2</sup>|''G''|) in every generating set.\n\nAn efficient solution to the ''constructive membership problem'' is crucial to many group-theoretic algorithms. It can be stated in terms of SLPs as follows. Given a finite group ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lang;''S''&rang; and ''g''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G'', find a straight-line program computing ''g'' over&nbsp;''S''. The constructive membership problem is often studied in the setting of [[black box group]]s. The elements are encoded by bit strings of a fixed length.  Three ''oracles'' are provided for the group-theoretic functions of multiplication, inversion, and checking for equality with the identity. A ''black box algorithm'' is one which uses only these oracles. Hence, straight-line programs for black box groups are black box algorithms.\n\nExplicit straight-line programs are given for a wealth of finite simple groups in the online [[ATLAS of Finite Groups]].\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Informal Definition===\nLet ''G'' be a finite group and let ''S'' be a subset of ''G''.  A  sequence ''L'' = (''g''<sub>1</sub>,…,''g''<sub>''m''</sub>) of elements of ''G'' is a ''straight-line program'' over ''S'' if each ''g''<sub>''i''</sub> can be obtained by one of the following three rules: \n# ''g''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ ''S''\n# ''g''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''g''<sub>''j''</sub> <math>\\cdot</math> ''g''<sub>''k''</sub> for some ''j'',''k'' < ''i'' \n# ''g''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''g''{{su|b=''j''|p=−1}} for some ''j'' < ''i''.\nThe straight-line ''cost'' ''c''(''g''|''S'') of an element ''g'' ∈ ''G'' is the length of a shortest straight-line program over ''S'' computing ''g''. The cost is infinite if ''g'' is not in the subgroup generated by ''S''.\n\nA straight-line program is similar to a derivation in predicate logic. The elements of ''S'' correspond to axioms and the group operations correspond to the rules of inference.\n\n===Formal definition===\n\nLet ''G'' be a finite group and let ''S'' be a subset of ''G''. A ''straight-line program'' of length ''m'' over ''S'' computing some ''g'' ∈ ''G'' is a sequence of expressions (''w''<sub>1</sub>,…,''w''<sub>''m''</sub>) such that for each ''i'', ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> is a symbol for some element of ''S'', or ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> = (''w''<sub>''j''</sub>,-1) for some ''j'' < ''i'', or ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> = (''w''<sub>''j''</sub>,''w''<sub>''k''</sub>) for some ''j'',''k'' < ''i'', such that ''w''<sub>''m''</sub> takes upon the value ''g'' when evaluated in ''G'' in the obvious manner.\n\nThe original definition appearing in <ref name = \"Seress\">Ákos Seress. (2003). Permutation Group Algorithms. [Online]. Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics. (No. 152). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> requires that ''G'' =&lang;''S''&rang;. The definition presented above is a common generalisation of this.\n\nFrom a computational perspective, the formal definition of a straight-line program has some advantages. Firstly, a sequence of abstract expressions requires less memory than terms over the generating set. Secondly, it allows straight-line programs to be constructed in one representation of ''G'' and evaluated in another. This is an important feature of some algorithms.<ref name = \"Seress\"/>\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe [[dihedral group]]  D<sub>12</sub> is  the group of symmetries of a hexagon.

Straight-line programs can be used to study compression of finite groups via  [[first-order logic]]. They provide a tool to construct \"short\" sentences describing ''G'' (i.e. much shorter than |''G''|). In more detail, SLPs are used to prove that every finite simple group has a first-order description of length ''O''(log|''G''|), and every finite group ''G'' has a first-order description of length ''O''(log<sup>3</sup>|''G''|).<ref>Nies, A., & Tent, K.

Mathematics, to appear. https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8390</ref>\n\n''Straight-line programs computing generating sets for maximal subgroups of finite simple groups''. The online ATLAS of Finite Group Representations<ref>http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/</ref> provides abstract straight-line programs for computing generating sets of maximal subgroups for many finite simple groups.\n\n'''Example''': The group Sz(32), belonging to the infinite family of [[Suzuki groups]], has rank 2 via generators ''a'' and ''b'', where ''a'' has order 2, ''b'' has order 4, ''ab'' has order 5, ''ab''<sup>2</sup> has order 25 and ''abab''<sup>2</sup>''ab''<sup>3</sup> has order 25.

This can be understood as a bound on how hard it is to generate a group element from the generators.\n\nHere the function lg(''x'') is an integer-valued version of  the logarithm function: for ''k''≥1 let lg(''k'') = max{''r'' : 2<sup>r</sup> ≤ ''k''}.\n\nThe idea of the proof is to construct a set ''Z'' = {''z''<sub>1</sub>,…,''z''<sub>''s''</sub>} that will work as a new generating set (''s'' will be defined during the process). It is usually larger than ''S'', but any element of ''G'' can be expressed as a word of length at most {{math|2{{mabs|''Z''}}}} over ''Z''. The set ''Z'' is constructed by inductively defining an increasing sequence of sets ''K''(''i'').\n\nLet ''K''(''i'') = {''z''<sub>1</sub><sup>''α''<sub>1</sub></sup>&middot;''z''<sub>2</sub><sup>''α''<sub>2</sub></sup>&middot;…&middot;''z''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''α''<sub>''i''</sub></sup> : ''α''<sub>''j''</sub> ∈ {0,1}}, where ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> is the group element added to ''Z'' at the ''i''-th step. Let ''c''(''i'') denote the length of a shortest straight-line program that contains ''Z''(''i'') = {''z''<sub>1</sub>,…,''z''<sub>''i''</sub>}. Let ''K''(0) = {1<sub>''G''</sub>} and ''c''(0)=0. We define the set ''Z'' recursively:\n* If ''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i'') = ''G'', declare ''s'' to take upon the value ''i'' and stop.\n* Else, choose some ''z''<sub>''i''+1</sub> ∈ ''G''\\''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i'') (which is non-empty) that minimises the \"cost increase\" ''c''(''i''+1) − ''c''(''i'').\n\nBy this process, ''Z'' is defined in a way so that any ''g'' ∈ ''G'' can be written as an element of ''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i''), effectively making it easier to generate from ''Z''.\n\nWe now need to verify the following claim to ensure that the process terminates within lg(|''G''|) many steps:\n\n{{math theorem|name=Claim 1|1= If ''i'' < ''s'' then {{math|1={{mabs|''K''(''i''+1)}} = 2{{mabs|''K''(''i'')}}}}.}}\n\n{{Math proof|1= It is immediate that {{math|1={{mabs|''K''(''i''+1)}} ≤ 2{{mabs|''K''(''i'')}}}}. Now suppose for a contradiction that {{math|1={{mabs|''K''(''i''+1)}} < 2{{mabs|''K''(''i'')}}}}. By the pigeonhole principle there are ''k''<sub>1</sub>,''k''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''K''(''i''+1) with ''k''<sub>1</sub> = ''z''<sub>1</sub><sup>''α''<sub>1</sub></sup>&middot;''z''<sub>2</sub><sup>''α''<sub>2</sub></sup>&middot;…&middot;''z''<sub>''i''+1</sub><sup>''α''<sub>''i''+1</sub></sup> = ''z''<sub>1</sub><sup>''β''<sub>1</sub></sup>&middot;''z''<sub>2</sub><sup>''β''<sub>2</sub></sup>&middot;…&middot;''z''<sub>''i''+1</sub><sup>''β''<sub>''i''+1</sub></sup> = ''k''<sub>2</sub> for some ''α''<sub>''j''</sub>,''β''<sub>''j''</sub> ∈ {0,1}. Let ''r'' be the largest integer such that ''α''<sub>''r''</sub> ≠ ''β''<sub>''r''</sub>. Assume WLOG that ''α''<sub>''r''</sub> = 1. It follows that ''z''<sub>''r''</sub> = ''z''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>−''α''<sub>''p''</sub></sup>&middot;''z''<sub>''p''-1</sub><sup>−''α''<sub>''p''-1</sub></sup>&middot;…&middot;''z''<sub>1</sub><sup>−''α''<sub>1</sub></sup>&middot;''z''<sub>1</sub><sup>''β''<sub>1</sub></sup>&middot;''z''<sub>2</sub><sup>''β''<sub>2</sub></sup>&middot;…&middot;''z''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>''β''<sub>''q''</sub></sup>, with ''p'',''q'' < ''r''. Hence ''z''<sub>''r''</sub> ∈ ''K''(''r''−1)<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''r''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1), a contradiction.}}\n\nThe next claim is used to show that the cost of every group element is within the required bound.\n\n{{math theorem|name=Claim 2| {{math|1=''c''(''i'') ≤ ''i'' <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;''i''}}.}}\n\n{{Math proof|1= Since ''c''(0)=0 it suffices to show that ''c''(''i''+1) - ''c''(''i'') ≤ 2''i''. The [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'' is connected and if ''i'' < ''s'', ''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i'') ≠ ''G'', then there is an element of the form {{math|1=''g''<sub>1</sub>&middot;''g''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''G''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i'')}} with ''g''<sub>1</sub> ∈ ''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i'') and ''g''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''S''.}}\n\nIt takes at most 2''i'' steps to generate ''g''<sub>1</sub> ∈ ''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i''). There is no point in generating the element of maximum length, since it is the identity. Hence {{math|1=2''i''&nbsp;−1}} steps suffice. To generate ''g''<sub>1</sub>&middot;''g''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''G''\\''K''(''i'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''i''), 2''i'' steps  are sufficient.\n\nWe now finish the theorem. Since ''K''(''s'')<sup>−1</sup>''K''(''s'') = ''G'', any ''g'' ∈ ''G'' can be written in the form ''k''{{su|b=1|p=−1}}&middot;''k''<sub>2</sub> with ''k''{{su|b=1|p=−1}},''k''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''K''(''s'').

Indeed this operation occurs so frequently that the notation for polynomials is often adapted to it; instead of designating a polynomial by a name like ''P'', as one would do for other mathematical objects, one could define\n:<math>P(X)=X^5-3X^2+5X-17</math>\nso that substitution for ''X'' can be designated by replacement inside \"''P''(''X'')\", say\n:<math>P(2)=13</math>\nor\n:<math>P(X+1)=X^5+5X^4+10X^3+7X^2+4X-14</math>.\nSubstitution can however also be applied to other kinds of formal objects built from symbols, for instance elements of [[free group]]s. In order for substitution to be defined, one needs an algebraic structure with an appropriate [[universal property]], that asserts the existence of unique homomorphisms that send indeterminates to specific values; the substitution then amounts to finding the image under such a homomorphism.\n\nSubstitution is related to, but not identical to, [[function composition]]; it is also closely related to ''β''-reduction in [[lambda calculus]]. In contrast to these notions, however, the accent in algebra is on the preservation of algebraic structure by the substitution operation, the fact that substitution gives a [[homomorphism]] for the structure at hand (in the case of polynomials, the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Substitution (logic)]] &mdash; about a formal treatment of substitution\n*[[Trigonometric substitution]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n{{algebra-stub}}"

It is based on treating the form as if it were a power of a degree one form, which corresponds to embedding a symmetric power of a vector space into the symmetric elements of a [[tensor product]] of copies of it.\n\n==Symbolic notation==\n\nThe symbolic method uses a compact, but rather confusing and mysterious notation for invariants, depending on the introduction of new symbols ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ...  (from which the symbolic method gets its name) with apparently contradictory properties.\n\n===Example: the discriminant of a binary quadratic form===\nThese symbols can be explained by the following example from {{harv|Gordan|1887|loc=v. 2, p.g. 1-3}}. Suppose that \n:<math>\\displaystyle  f(x) = A_0x_1^2+2A_1x_1x_2+A_2x_2^2</math>\nis a binary quadratic form with an invariant given by the discriminant\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Delta=A_0A_2-A_1^2.</math>\nThe symbolic representation of the discriminant is \n:<math>\\displaystyle 2\\Delta=(ab)^2</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are the symbols. The meaning of  the expression (''ab'')<sup>2</sup> is as follows. First of all, (''ab'') is a shorthand form for the determinant of a matrix whose rows are ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub> and ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>, so \n:<math>\\displaystyle (ab)=a_1b_2-a_2b_1.</math>\nSquaring this we get\n:<math>\\displaystyle (ab)^2=a_1^2b_2^2-2a_1a_2b_1b_2+a_2^2b_1^2.</math>\nNext we pretend that\n:<math>\\displaystyle f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2)^2=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2)^2</math>\nso that\n:<math>\\displaystyle  A_i=a_1^{2-i}a_2^{i}= b_1^{2-i}b_2^{i}</math>\nand we ignore the fact that this does not seem to make sense if ''f'' is not a power of a linear form. \nSubstituting these values gives\n:<math>\\displaystyle (ab)^2= A_2A_0-2A_1A_1+A_0A_2 = 2\\Delta.</math>\n\n===Higher degrees===\nMore generally if \n:<math>\\displaystyle  f(x) = A_0x_1^n+\\binom{n}{1}A_1x_1^{n-1}x_2+\\cdots+A_nx_2^n</math>\nis a binary form of higher degree, then one introduces new variables ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>,  ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, with the properties\n:<math>f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2)^n=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2)^n=(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)^n=\\cdots.</math>\n\nWhat this means is that the following two vector spaces are naturally isomorphic:\n*The  vector space of homogeneous polynomials in ''A''<sub>0</sub>,...''A''<sub>''n''</sub> of degree ''m''\n*The vector space of  polynomials in 2''m'' variables ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>,  ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, ... that have degree ''n'' in each of the ''m'' pairs of variables (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>),  (''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>), (''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>), ... and are symmetric under permutations of the ''m'' symbols ''a'', ''b'', ....,\nThe isomorphism is given by mapping ''a''{{su|p=''n''&minus;''j''|b=1}}''a''{{su|p=''j''|b=2}}, ''b''{{su|p=''n''&minus;''j''|b=1}}''b''{{su|p=''j''|b=2}}, .... to ''A''<sub>''j''</sub>. This mapping does not preserve products of polynomials.\n\n===More variables===\nThe extension to a form ''f'' in more than two variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>,... is similar: one introduces symbols ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>,''a''<sub>3</sub> and so on  with the properties\n:<math>f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+\\cdots)^n=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_3+\\cdots)^n=(c_1x_1+c_2x_2+c_3x_3+\\cdots)^n=\\cdots.</math>\n\n==Symmetric products==\n\nThe rather mysterious formalism of the symbolic method corresponds to embedding a symmetric product S<sup>''n''</sup>(''V'') of a vector space ''V'' into a tensor product of ''n'' copies of ''V'', as the elements preserved by the action of the symmetric group. In fact this is done twice, because the invariants of degree ''n'' of a quantic of degree ''m'' are the invariant elements of S<sup>''n''</sup>S<sup>''m''</sup>(''V''), which gets embedded into a tensor product of ''mn'' copies of ''V'', as the elements invariant under a wreath product of the two symmetric groups. The brackets of the symbolic method are really invariant linear forms on this tensor product, which give invariants of S<sup>''n''</sup>S<sup>''m''</sup>(''V'') by restriction.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Umbral calculus]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Aronhold | first1=Siegfried Heinrich | title=Theorie der homogenen Functionen dritten Grades von drei Veränderlichen. | url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN00215028X | language=German | year=1858 | journal=[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]] | issn=0075-4102 | volume=55 | pages=97–191 | doi=10.1515/crll.1858.55.97}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Cayley | first1=Arthur | author1-link=Arthur Cayley | title=On linear transformations | url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN600493962_0001 | year=1846 | journal=Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal  | pages=104–122}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Clebsch | first1=A. | title=Ueber symbolische Darstellung algebraischer Formen | url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN243919689_0059 | language=German  | year=1861 | journal=Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik | issn=0075-4102 | volume=59 | pages=1–62 | doi=10.1515/crll.1861.59.1}}\n*{{citation|first=Jean|last=Dieudonné|authorlink=Jean Dieudonné|first2=James B.|last2=Carrell|title=Invariant theory, old and new|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W9F-4D7JKM7-1&_user=1495569&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F1970&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000053194&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=1495569&md5=66afdc20312efc67ffb295764befef82&searchtype=a|\njournal=Advances in Mathematics|volume =4|year= 1970|pages=1–80|doi=10.1016/0001-8708(70)90015-0}}{{dead link|date=March 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, pages 32–37, \"Invariants of ''n''-ary forms: the symbolic method.

[[Wolfgang Krull|Krull’s]] famous proof of his [[Krull's principal ideal theorem|principal ideal theorem]] uses them in an essential way. They first arose after [[primary decomposition]]s were proved for [[Noetherian rings]]. [[Oscar Zariski|Zariski]] used symbolic powers in his study of the analytic [[Normal space|normality]] of [[algebraic varieties]]. [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley's]] famous lemma comparing [[topology|topologies]] states that in a [[local ring|complete local domain]] the symbolic powers [[topology]] of any [[prime number|prime]] is [[Comparison of topologies|finer]] than the [[completion (algebra)|''m''-adic topology]]. A crucial step in the vanishing theorem on [[local cohomology]] of Hartshorne and Lichtenbaum uses that for a prime <math>I</math> defining a [[curve]] in a [[local ring|complete local domain]], the powers of <math>I</math> are [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] with the symbolic powers of <math>I</math>. This important property of being [[cofinality|cofinal]] was further developed by Schenzel in the 1970s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== In algebraic geometry ==\nThough [[generator (mathematics)|generators]] for ''ordinary powers'' of <math>I</math> are well understood when <math>I</math> is given in terms of its generators as <math> I = (f_1, \\ldots, f_k)</math>, it is still very difficult in many cases to determine the generators of symbolic powers of <math>I</math>. But in the [[Geometry|geometric]] setting, there is a clear geometric interpretation in the case when <math>I</math> is a [[radical ideal]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]].\n\nIf <math>X</math> is an [[Irreducible component|irreducible]] [[algebraic variety|variety]] whose ideal of vanishing is <math>I</math>, then the ''[[Differential ideal|differential power]]'' of <math>I</math>  consists of all the [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] in <math>R</math> that vanish\nto order ≥ ''n'' on <math>X</math>, i.e.\n\n:<math>I^{\\langle n\\rangle} := \\{ f \\in R \\mid f \\text{ vanishes to order} \\geq n \\text{ on all of }X \\}.</math>\n\nOr equivalently, if <math>\\mathbf{m}_p</math> is the [[maximal ideal]] for a point <math>p\\in X</math>, <math>I^{\\langle n\\rangle}=\\bigcap _{p \\in X} \\mathbf{m}_p^n</math>.\n\n'''Theorem (Nagata, Zariski)'''<ref>David Eisenbud.

In general this is not the case. One example of this is the prime ideal <math>P =(x^4-yz,\\, y^2-xz, \\,x^3y-z^2) \\subseteq K[x,y,z]</math>.

Indeed, the containment <math>I^n\\subseteq I^{(n)}</math>follows from the definition. Further, it is known that <math>I^r\\subseteq I^{(m)}</math> if and only if <math>m\\leq r</math>.

The symmetric difference of the sets ''A'' and ''B'' is commonly denoted by\n:<math>A\\,\\triangle\\,B,</math>\nor\n:<math>A \\ominus B,</math>\nor\n:<math>A \\oplus B.</math>\n\nFor example, the symmetric difference of the sets <math>\\{1,2,3\\}</math> and <math>\\{3,4\\}</math> is <math>\\{1,2,4\\}</math>.\n\nThe [[power set]] of any set becomes an [[abelian group]] under the operation of symmetric difference, with the [[empty set]] as the [[neutral element]] of the group and every element in this group being its own [[inverse element|inverse]]. The power set of any set becomes a [[Boolean ring]] with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] as the multiplication of the ring.\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:Venn 0110 1001.svg|thumb|\nVenn diagram of <math>~A \\triangle B \\triangle C</math>\n\n{{nowrap|[[File:Venn 0110 0110.svg|40px]] <math>~\\triangle~</math> [[File:Venn 0000 1111.svg|40px]]}} <math>~=~</math> [[File:Venn 0110 1001.svg|40px]]\n]]\n\nThe symmetric difference is equivalent to the [[union (set theory)|union]] of both [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]]s, that is:\n\n:<math>A\\,\\triangle\\,B = \\left(A \\setminus B\\right) \\cup \\left(B \\setminus A\\right),</math>\n\nThe symmetric difference can also be expressed using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation ⊕ on the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] describing the two sets in [[set-builder notation]]:\n\n:<math>A\\,\\triangle\\,B = \\{x : (x \\in A) \\oplus (x \\in B)\\}.</math>\n\nThe same fact can be stated as the [[indicator function]] (which we denote here by <math>\\chi</math>) of the symmetric difference being the XOR (or addition [[Modular arithmetic|mod 2]]) of the indicator functions of its two arguments: <math>\\chi_{(A\\,\\triangle\\,B)} = \\chi_A \\oplus \\chi_B</math> or using the [[Iverson bracket]] notation <math>[x \\in A\\,\\triangle\\,B] = [x \\in A] \\oplus [x \\in B]</math>.\n\nThe symmetric difference can also be expressed as the union of the two sets, minus their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]:\n\n:<math>A\\,\\triangle\\,B = (A \\cup B) \\setminus (A \\cap B),</math>\n\nIn particular, <math>A\\triangle B\\subseteq A\\cup B</math>; the equality in this non-strict [[Subset|inclusion]] occurs [[if and only if]] <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are [[disjoint sets]]. Furthermore, if we denote <math>D = A\\triangle B</math> and <math>I = A \\cap B</math>, then <math>D</math> and <math>I</math> are always disjoint, so <math>D</math> and <math>I</math> [[Partition of a set|partition]] <math>A \\cup B</math>. Consequently, assuming intersection and symmetric difference as primitive operations, the union of two sets can be well ''defined'' in terms of symmetric difference by the right-hand side of the equality\n\n:<math>A\\,\\cup\\,B = (A\\,\\triangle\\,B)\\,\\triangle\\,(A \\cap B)</math>.\n\nThe symmetric difference is [[commutativity|commutative]] and [[associativity|associative]] (and consequently the leftmost set of parentheses in the previous expression were thus redundant):\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                  A\\,\\triangle\\,B &= B\\,\\triangle\\,A, \\\\\n  (A\\,\\triangle\\,B)\\,\\triangle\\,C &= A\\,\\triangle\\,(B\\,\\triangle\\,C).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe [[empty set]] is [[identity element|neutral]], and every set is its own inverse:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  A\\,\\triangle\\,\\varnothing &= A, \\\\\n            A\\,\\triangle\\,A &= \\varnothing.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTaken together, we see that the [[power set]] of any set ''X'' becomes an [[abelian group]] if we use the symmetric difference as operation. (More generally, any [[field of sets]] forms a group with the symmetric difference as operation.) A group in which every element is its own inverse (or, equivalently, in which every element has [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2) is sometimes called a [[Boolean group]];<ref name=\"GivantHalmos2009\">{{cite book |last1=Givant |first1=Steven |last2=Halmos |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul Halmos |year=2009 |title=Introduction to Boolean Algebras |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-0-387-40293-2 |page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Humberstone2011\">{{cite book |last=Humberstone |first=Lloyd |year=2011 |title=The Connectives |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01654-4 |page=782}}</ref> the symmetric difference provides a prototypical example of such groups.

Consequently, the group induced by the symmetric difference is in fact a [[vector space]] over the [[finite field|field with 2 elements]] '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>. If ''X'' is finite, then the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of this vector space, and its [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] is therefore equal to the number of elements of ''X''. This construction is used in [[graph theory]], to define the [[cycle space]] of a graph.\n\nFrom the property of the inverses in a Boolean group, it follows that the symmetric difference of two repeated symmetric differences is equivalent to the repeated symmetric difference of the [[Multiset#Operations|join]] of the two multisets, where for each double set both can be removed. In particular:\n\n:<math>(A\\,\\triangle\\,B)\\,\\triangle\\,(B\\,\\triangle\\,C) = A\\,\\triangle\\,C.</math>\n\nThis implies triangle inequality:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rudin |first1=Walter |date=January 1, 1976 |title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0070542358 |page=306}}</ref> the symmetric difference of ''A'' and ''C'' is contained in the union of the symmetric difference of ''A'' and ''B'' and that of ''B'' and ''C''.

Now consider two subsets of ''S'' and set their distance apart as the size of their symmetric difference. This distance is in fact a [[metric  (mathematics)|metric ]] so that the [[power set]] on ''S'' is a [[metric space]]. If ''S'' has ''n'' elements, then the distance from the [[empty set]] to ''S'' is ''n'', and this is the maximum distance for any pair of subsets.<ref>Claude Flament (1963) ''Applications of Graph Theory to Group Structure'', page 16, [[Prentice-Hall]] {{mr|id=0157785}}</ref>\n\nUsing the ideas of [[measure theory]], the separation of measurable sets can be defined to be the measure of their symmetric difference. If μ is a [[sigma-finite|σ-finite]] [[measure space|measure]] defined on a [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] Σ, the function\n:<math>d_\\mu(X, Y) = \\mu(X\\,\\triangle\\,Y)</math>\n\nis a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]] on Σ.  ''d<sub>μ</sub>'' becomes a [[metric space|metric]] if Σ is considered modulo the [[equivalence relation]] ''X'' ~ ''Y'' if and only if <math>\\mu(X\\,\\triangle\\,Y) = 0</math>. It is sometimes called [[Fréchet]]-[[Nikodym]] metric.  The resulting metric space is [[separable space|separable]] if and only if [[L^2|L<sup>2</sup>(μ)]] is separable.\n\nIf <math>\\mu(X), \\mu(Y) < \\infty</math>, we have: <math>|\\mu(X) - \\mu(Y)| \\leq \\mu(X\\,\\triangle\\,Y)</math>.

One may define an equivalence relation on measurable sets by letting ''F'' and ''G'' be related if <math>\\mu\\left(F \\triangle G\\right) = 0</math>.  This relation is denoted <math>F = G\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math>.\n\nGiven <math>\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{E} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}</math>, one writes <math>\\mathcal{D}\\subseteq\\mathcal{E}\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math> if to each <math>D\\in\\mathcal{D}</math> there's some <math>E \\in \\mathcal{E}</math> such that <math>D = E\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math>. The relation \"<math>\\subseteq\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math>\" is a partial order on the family of subsets of <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.\n\nWe write <math>\\mathcal{D} = \\mathcal{E}\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math> if <math>\\mathcal{D}\\subseteq\\mathcal{E}\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math> and <math>\\mathcal{E} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math>.  The relation \"<math>= \\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math>\" is an equivalence relationship between the subsets of <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.\n\nThe ''symmetric closure'' of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> is the collection of all <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>-measurable sets that are <math>= \\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math> to some <math>D \\in \\mathcal{D}</math>. The symmetric closure of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> contains <math>\\mathcal{D}</math>. If <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> is a sub-<math>\\sigma</math>-algebra of <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>, so is the symmetric closure of <math>\\mathcal{D}</math>.\n\n<math>F = G\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math> iff <math>\\left|\\mathbf{1}_F - \\mathbf{1}_G\\right| = 0</math> <math>\\left[\\mathcal{A}, \\mu\\right]</math> [[almost everywhere]].\n\n== Hausdorff distance vs. symmetric difference ==\n[[File:HausdorffVsSymmetric.png|thumb|right]]\nThe [[Hausdorff distance]] and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo-metrics on the set of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, \"Red\" and \"Red ∪ Green\". When the Hausdorff distance between them becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference between them becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance between them converges to 0 and the symmetric distance between them diverges, or vice versa.\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Algebra of sets]]\n* [[Boolean function]]\n* [[Difference (set theory)]]\n* [[Exclusive or]]\n* [[Fuzzy set]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Sigma-algebra#Separable_.CF.83-algebras|Separable sigma algebras]]\n* [[Set theory]]\n* [[Symmetry]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last=Halmos |first=Paul R. |authorlink=Paul Halmos |year=1960 |title=[[Naive Set Theory (book)|Naive set theory]] |series=The University Series in Undergraduate Mathematics |publisher=van Nostrand Company |zbl=0087.04403}}\n* {{planetmath reference|id=916|title=Symmetric difference}}\n* {{MathWorld |title=Symmetric Difference |urlname=SymmetricDifference}}\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Symmetric_difference_of_sets ''Symmetric difference of sets''].

When {{math|''k''}} is the field of [[rational number]]s, {{math|''K''}} is generally assumed to be the field of [[complex number]]s, because each solution belongs to a [[field extension]] of {{math|''k''}}, which is isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers.\n\nThis article is about the methods for solving, that is, finding all solutions or describing them. As these methods are designed for being implemented in a computer, emphasis is given on fields {{math|''k''}} in which computation (including equality testing) is easy and efficient, that is the field of [[rational number]]s and [[finite field]]s.\n\nSearching for solutions that belong to a specific set is a problem which is generally much more difficult, and is outside the scope of this article, except for the case of the solutions in a given finite field. For the case of solutions of which all components are integers or rational numbers, see [[Diophantine equation]].\n\n==Examples and extensions==\n===Trigonometric equations===\nA trigonometric equation is an equation {{math|1=''g'' = 0}} where {{math|''g''}} is a [[trigonometric polynomial]]. Such an equation may be converted into a polynomial system by expanding the sines and cosines in it (using [[trigonometric functions#Sum and difference formulas|sum and difference formulas]]), replacing {{math|sin(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'')}} by two new variables {{math|''s''}} and {{math|''c''}} and adding the new equation {{math|1=''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> – 1 = 0}}.\n\nFor example, because of the identity\n:<math>\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^3(x)+3\\cos(x),</math>\nsolving the equation\n:<math> \\sin^3(x)+\\cos(3x)=0 </math>\nis equivalent to solving the polynomial system\n:<math> \\begin{cases}\ns^3+4c^3-3c&=0\\\\\ns^2+c^2-1&=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFor each solution {{math|(''c''{{sub|0}}, ''s''{{sub|0}})}} of this system, there is a unique solution {{mvar|x}} of the equation such that {{math|0 ≤ ''x'' < 2{{pi}}}}.\n\nIn the case of this simple example, it may be unclear whether the system is, or not, easier to solve than the equation. On more complicated examples, one lacks systematics methods for solving directly the equation, while software are available for automatically solving the corresponding system.\n\n=== Solutions in a finite field ===\nWhen solving a system over a finite field {{math|''k''}} with {{math|''q''}} elements, one is primarily interested in the solutions in {{math|''k''}}. As the elements of {{math|''k''}} are exactly the solutions of the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>''q''</sup> – ''x'' = 0}}, it suffices, for restricting the solutions to {{math|''k''}}, to add the equation {{math|1=''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''q''</sup> – ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0}} for each variable&nbsp;{{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.\n\n=== Coefficients in a number field or in a finite field with non-prime order ===\n\nThe elements of a [[number field]] are usually represented as polynomials in a generator of the field which satisfies some univariate polynomial equation. To work with a polynomial system whose coefficients belong to a number field, it suffices to consider this generator as a new variable and to add the equation of the generator to the equations of the system. Thus solving a polynomial system over a number field is reduced to solving another system over the rational numbers.\n\nFor example, if a system contains <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, a system over the rational numbers is obtained by adding the equation {{math|1=''r''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> – 2 = 0}} and replacing <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> by {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} in the other equations.\n\nIn the case of a finite field, the same transformation allows always to suppose that the field {{math|''k''}} has a prime order.\n\n==Basic properties and definitions==\nA system is [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] if the number of equations is higher than the number of variables. A system is [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]] if it has no solutions. By [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] this means that 1 is a [[linear combination]] (with polynomials as coefficients) of the first members of the equations. Most but not all overdetermined systems, when constructed with random coefficients, are inconsistent. For example, the system &nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 =&nbsp;0, ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is overdetermined (having two equations but only one unknown),  but it is not inconsistent since it has the solution ''x'' =1.\n\nA system is [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] if the number of equations is lower than the number of the variables. An underdetermined system is either inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions in an algebraically closed extension ''K'' of&nbsp;''k''.\n\nA system is [[Zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] if it has a finite number of solutions in an algebraically closed extension ''K'' of&nbsp;''k''. This terminology comes from the fact that the [[algebraic variety]] of the solutions has [[Dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] zero. A system with infinitely many solutions is said to be ''positive-dimensional''.\n\nA zero-dimensional system with as many equations as variables is said to be ''well-behaved''.<ref>Songxin Liang, J. Gerhard, D.J. Jeffrey, G. Moroz, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Stoutemyer/publication/235941679_Unit_normalization_of_multinomials_over_Gaussian_integers/links/02e7e532ddec858b2a000000.pdf#page=2 A Package for Solving Parametric Polynomial Systems]''. Communications in Computer Algebra (2009)</ref>\n[[Bézout's theorem]] asserts that a well-behaved system whose equations have degrees ''d''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> has at most ''d''<sub>1</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub> solutions. This bound is sharp. If all the degrees are equal to ''d'', this bound becomes ''d''<sup>''n''</sup> and is exponential in the number of variables.\n\nThis exponential behavior makes solving polynomial systems difficult and explains why there are few solvers that are able to automatically solve systems with Bézout's bound higher than, say, 25 (three equations of degree 3 or five equations of degree 2 are beyond this bound).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== What is solving? ==\nThe first thing to do in solving a polynomial system is to decide if it is inconsistent, zero-dimensional or positive dimensional. This may be done by the computation of a [[Gröbner basis]] of the left-hand sides of the equations. The system is ''inconsistent'' if this Gröbner basis is reduced to 1. The system is ''zero-dimensional'' if, for every variable there is a [[Gröbner basis|leading monomial]] of some element of the Gröbner basis which is a pure power of this variable. For this test, the best [[monomial order]] is usually the [[monomial order#Graded reverse lexicographic order|graded reverse lexicographic]] one (grevlex).\n\nIf the system is ''positive-dimensional'', it has infinitely many solutions. It is thus not possible to enumerate them. It follows that, in this case, solving may only mean \"finding a description of the solutions from which the relevant properties of the solutions are easy to extract\". There is no commonly accepted such description. In fact there are many different \"relevant properties\", which involve almost every subfield of [[algebraic geometry]].\n\nA natural example of such a question positive-dimensional systems is the following: ''decide if a polynomial system over the [[rational number]]s has a finite number of real solutions and compute them''. A generalization of this question is ''find at least one solution in each [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] of the set of real solutions of a polynomial system''.  The classical algorithm for solving these question is [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], which has a [[double exponential function|doubly exponential]] [[computational complexity]] and therefore cannot be used in practice, except for very small examples.\n\nFor zero-dimensional systems, solving consists of computing all the solutions. There are two different ways of outputting the solutions. The most common, possible for real or complex solutions, consists of outputting numeric approximations of the solutions. Such a solution is called ''numeric''. A solution is ''certified'' if it is provided with a bound on the error of the approximations which separates the different solutions.\n\nThe other way to represent the solutions is said to be ''algebraic''. It uses the fact that, for a zero-dimensional system, the solutions belong to the [[algebraic closure]] of the field ''k'' of the coefficients of the system. There are several ways to represent the solution in an algebraic closure, which are discussed below. All of them allow one to compute a numerical approximation of the solutions by solving one or several univariate equations. For this computation, the representation involving the solving of only one univariate polynomial for each solution is preferable: computing the roots of a polynomial which has approximate coefficients is a highly unstable problem.\n\n== Algebraic representation of the solutions==\n=== Regular chains ===\n{{main|Regular chain}}\nThe usual way of representing the solutions is through zero-dimensional regular chains. Such a chain consists of a sequence of polynomials {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}}, {{math|''f''<sub>2</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}, ..., {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} such that, for every {{math|''i''}} such that {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}\n* {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} only, which has a degree {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> > 0}} in {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}};\n* the coefficient of {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''d''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}} in {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''i'' −1 </sub>}} which does not have any common zero with {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>}}, ..., {{math|''f''<sub>''i'' − 1</sub>}}.\n\nTo such a [[regular chain]] is associated a ''triangular system of equations''\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1(x_1)= 0\\\\\nf_2(x_1,x_2)=0\\\\\n\\quad\\vdots\\\\\nf_n(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe solutions of this system are obtained by solving the first univariate equation, substituting the solutions in the other equations, then solving the second equation which is now univariate, and so on. The definition of regular chains implies that the univariate equation obtained from {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} has degree {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and thus that the system has {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub> ... ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} solutions, provided that there is no multiple root in this resolution process ([[fundamental theorem of algebra]]).\n\nEvery zero-dimensional system of polynomial equations is equivalent (i.e. has the same solutions) to a finite number of regular chains. Several regular chains may be needed, as it is the case for the following system which has three solutions.\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2-1=0\\\\\n(x-1)(y-1)=0\\\\\ny^2-1=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThere are several algorithms for computing a [[triangular decomposition]] of an arbitrary polynomial system (not necessarily zero-dimensional)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aubry | first1 = P. | last2 = Maza | first2 = M.

It consists in computing first the [[Gröbner basis]] for the [[monomial order|graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex)]], then deducing the lexicographical Gröbner basis by FGLM algorithm<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Faugère | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Gianni | first2 = P. | last3 = Lazard | first3 = D. | last4 = Mora | first4 = T. | title = Efficient Computation of Zero-Dimensional Gröbner Basis by Change of Ordering | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717183710515/pdf?md5=96c9dfd7de57f6d6dc799a0c4552192d&pid=1-s2.0-S0747717183710515-main.pdf&_valck=1 | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 16 | issue = | year = 1993 | doi=10.1006/jsco.1993.1051 | pages=329–344}}</ref> and finally applying the Lextriangular algorithm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | title = Solving zero-dimensional algebraic systems | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800867 | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 13 | issue = | year = 1992 | doi=10.1016/S0747-7171(08)80086-7 | pages=117–131}}</ref>\n\nThis representation of the solutions are fully convenient for coefficients in a finite field. However, for rational coefficients, two aspects have to be taken care of:\n* The output may involve huge integers which may make the computation and the use of the result problematic.\n* To deduce the numeric values of the solutions from the output, one has to solve univariate polynomials with approximate coefficients, which is a highly unstable problem.\n\nThe first issue has been solved by Dahan and Schost:<ref>Xavier Dahan and Eric Schost. ''[http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~eschost/publications/DaSc.ps Sharp Estimates for Triangular Sets]''.

This set, called ''equiprojectable decomposition'', depends only on the choice of the coordinates. This allows the use of [[modular arithmetic|modular methods]] for computing efficiently the equiprojectable decomposition.<ref>Changbo Chen and Marc Moreno-Maza.

ISSAC'2011, pages 83-90, ACM Press, 2011 and Journal of Symbolic Computation (to appear)</ref>\n\nThe second issue is generally solved by outputting regular chains of a special form, sometimes called ''shape lemma'', for which all {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} but the first one are equal to {{math|1}}. For getting such regular chains, one may have to add a further variable, called ''separating variable'', which is given the index {{math|0}}. The ''rational univariate representation'', described below,  allows computing such a special regular chain, satisfying Dahan–Schost bound, by starting from either a regular chain or a Gröbner basis.\n\n===Rational univariate representation===\nThe ''rational univariate representation'' or RUR is a representation of the solutions of a zero-dimensional polynomial system over the rational numbers which has been introduced by  F. Rouillier.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| first=Fabrice\n| last=Rouillier\n| title=Solving Zero-Dimensional Systems Through the Rational Univariate Representation\n|journal=Appl. Algebra Eng. Commun.

In particular {{math|''h''}} and the {{math|''g''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are defined independently of any algorithm to compute them.\n* The solutions of the system are in one-to-one correspondence with the roots of {{math|''h''}} and the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of each root of {{math|''h''}} equals the multiplicity of the corresponding solution.\n* The solutions of the system are obtained by substituting the roots of {{math|''h''}} in the other equations.\n* If {{math|''h''}} does not have any multiple root then {{math|''g''<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[formal derivative|derivative]] of {{math|''h''}}.\n\nFor example, for the system in the previous section, every linear combination of the variable, except the multiples of {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x'' + ''y''}}, is a separating variable. If one chooses {{math|1=''t'' = {{sfrac|''x'' – ''y''|2}}}} as a separating variable, then the RUR is\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nt^3-t=0\\\\\nx=\\frac{t^2+2t-1}{3t^2-1}\\\\\ny=\\frac{t^2-2t-1}{3t^2-1}.\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe RUR is uniquely defined for a given separating variable, independently of any algorithm, and it preserves the multiplicities of the roots. This is a notable difference with triangular decompositions (even the equiprojectable decomposition), which, in general, do not preserve multiplicities. The RUR shares with equiprojectable decomposition the property of producing an output with coefficients of relatively small size.\n\nFor zero-dimensional systems, the RUR allows retrieval of the numeric values of the solutions by solving a single univariate polynomial and substituting them in rational functions. This allows production of certified approximations of the solutions to any given precision.\n\nMoreover, the univariate polynomial {{math|''h''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} of the RUR may be factorized, and this gives a RUR for every irreducible factor. This provides the ''prime decomposition'' of the given ideal (that is the [[primary decomposition]] of the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of the ideal). In practice, this provides an output with much smaller coefficients, especially in the case of systems with high multiplicities.\n\nContrarily to triangular decompositions and equiprojectable decompositions, the RUR is not defined in positive dimension.\n\n==Algorithms for numerically solving==\n===General solving algorithms===\nThe general numerical algorithms which are designed for any [[system of nonlinear equations]] work also for polynomial systems. However the specific methods will generally be preferred, as the general methods generally do not allow one to find ''all'' solutions. In particular, when a general method does not find any solution, this is usually not an indication that there is no solution.\n\nNevertheless, two methods deserve to be mentioned here.\n\n*[[Newton's method]] may be used if the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. It does not allow one to find all the solutions nor to prove that there is no solution. But it is very fast when starting from a point which is close to a solution. Therefore, it is a basic tool for the homotopy continuation method described below.\n*[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] is rarely used for solving polynomial systems, but it succeeded, around 1970, in showing that a system of 81 quadratic equations in 56 variables is not inconsistent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = Daniel | year = 2009| title = Thirty years of Polynomial System Solving, and now? | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108001107 | journal = J. Symb. Comput. | volume = 44 | issue = | page = 2009 | doi=10.1016/j.jsc.2008.03.004}}</ref> With the other known methods this remains beyond the possibilities of modern technology. This method consists simply in minimizing the sum of the squares of the equations. If zero is found as a local minimum, then it is attained at a solution. This method works for overdetermined systems, but outputs an empty information if all local minimums which are found are positive.\n\n=== Homotopy continuation method ===\n{{main|Homotopy continuation}}\nThis is a semi-numeric method which supposes that the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. This method is relatively old but it has been dramatically improved in the last decades.<ref name=\"Vers99\">{{cite journal\n| first=Jan | last=Verschelde\n| title=Algorithm 795: PHCpack: A general-purpose solver for polynomial systems by homotopy continuation\n| journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software\n| volume=25\n| year=1999\n| url=http://eaton.math.rpi.edu/csums/papers/homotopy/verschelde.pdf\n| doi=10.1145/317275.317286\n}}</ref>\n\nThis method divides into three steps. First an upper bound on the number of solutions is computed. This bound has to be as sharp as possible. Therefore, it is computed by, at least, four different methods and the best value, say <math>N</math>, is kept.\n\nIn the second step, a system <math>g_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, g_n=0</math> of polynomial equations is generated which has exactly <math>N</math> solutions that are easy to compute. This new system has the same number <math>n</math> of variables and the same number <math>n</math> of equations and the same general structure as the system to solve, <math>f_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, f_n=0</math>.\n\nThen a [[homotopy]] between the two systems is considered. It consists, for example, of the straight line between the two systems, but other paths may be considered, in particular to avoid some singularities, in the system\n\n:<math>(1-t)g_1+t f_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, (1-t)g_n+t f_n=0</math>.\n\nThe homotopy continuation consists in deforming the parameter <math>t</math> from 0 to 1 and ''following'' the <math>N</math> solutions during this deformation. This gives the desired solutions for <math>t = 1</math>. ''Following'' means that, if <math>t_1<t_2</math>, the solutions for <math>t=t_2</math> are deduced from the solutions for <math>t=t_1</math> by Newton's method. The difficulty here is to well choose the value of <math>t_2-t_1:</math> Too large, Newton's convergence may be slow and may even jump from a solution path to another one. Too small, and the number of steps slows down the method.\n\n===Numerically solving from the rational univariate representation===\n\nTo deduce the numeric values of the solutions from a RUR seems easy: it suffices to compute the roots of the univariate polynomial and to substitute them in the other equations. This is not so easy because the evaluation of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial is highly unstable.\n\nThe roots of the univariate polynomial have thus to be computed at a high precision which may not be defined once for all. There are two algorithms which fulfill this requirement.\n\n* [[Aberth method]], implemented in [[MPSolve]] computes all the complex roots to any precision.\n* Uspensky's algorithm of Collins and Akritas,<ref>George E. Collins and Alkiviadis G. Akritas, ''[http://www.inf.uth.gr/~akritas/articles/1.pdf Polynomial Real Root Isolation Using Descarte's Rule of Signs]''. Proceedings of the 1976 ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation</ref> improved by Rouillier and Zimmermann <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rouillier | first1 = F. | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = P. | title = Efficient isolation of polynomial's real roots | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042703007271 | journal = Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume = 162 | issue = | year = 2004 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2003.08.015 | pages=33–50}}</ref> and based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]]. This algorithms computes the real roots, isolated in intervals of arbitrary small width. It is implemented in [[Maple (software)|Maple]] (functions ''fsolve'' and ''RootFinding[Isolate]'').\n\n==Software packages==\nThere are at least four software packages which can solve zero-dimensional systems automatically (by automatically, one means that no human intervention is needed between input and output, and thus that no knowledge of the method by the user is needed). There are also several other software packages which may be useful for solving zero-dimensional systems. Some of them are listed after the automatic solvers.\n\nThe [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''RootFinding[Isolate]'' takes as input any polynomial system over the rational numbers (if some coefficients are [[floating point]] numbers, they are converted to rational numbers) and outputs the real solutions represented either (optionally) as intervals of rational numbers or as floating point approximations of arbitrary precision. If the system is not zero dimensional, this is signaled as an error.\n\nInternally, this solver, designed by F. Rouillier computes first a Gröbner basis and then a Rational Univariate Representation from which the required approximation of the solutions are deduced. It works routinely for systems having up to a few hundred complex solutions.\n\nThe rational univariate representation may be computed with [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''Groebner[RationalUnivariateRepresentation]''.\n\nTo extract all the complex solutions from a rational univariate representation, one may use [[MPSolve]], which computes the complex roots of univariate polynomials to any precision. It is recommended to run [[MPSolve]] several times, doubling the precision each time, until solutions remain stable, as the substitution of the roots in the equations of the input variables can be highly unstable.\n\nThe second solver is PHCpack,<ref name=\"Vers99\" /><ref>[http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html Release 2.3.86 of PHCpack]</ref> written under the direction of J. Verschelde. PHCpack implements the homotopy continuation method. This solver computes the isolated complex solutions of polynomial systems having as many equations as variables.\n\nThe third solver is Bertini,<ref>Bates, D. J., Hauenstein, J. D., Sommese, A. J., & Wampler, C. W. (2013). Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini (Vol. 25). SIAM.</ref><ref>[http://bertini.nd.edu/ Bertini: Software for Numerical Algebraic Geometry]</ref> written by D. J. Bates, J. D. Hauenstein, A. J. Sommese, and C. W. Wampler. Bertini uses numerical homotopy continuation with adaptive precision.  In addition to computing zero-dimensional solution sets, both PHCpack and Bertini are capable of working with positive dimensional solution sets.\n\nThe fourth solver is the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] library ''RegularChains'', written by Marc Moreno-Maza and collaborators. It contains various functions for solving polynomial systems by means of [[regular chain]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Triangular decomposition]]\n*[[Wu's method of characteristic set]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cox|first=David|author2=John Little |author3=Donal O'Shea  |title=Ideals, varieties, and algorithms : an introduction to computational algebraic geometry and commutative algebra|year=1997|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387946801|edition=2nd}}\n*{{cite book|last=Sturmfels|first=Bernd|title=Solving systems of polynomial equations|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|location=Providence, RI|isbn=0821832514}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Systems Of Polynomial Equations}}\n[[Category:Equations]]\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n[[Category:Computer algebra]]\n[[Category:Polynomials]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]"

Moreover, the Author, [[Wu Wenjun|Wen-Tsun Wu]], realized an implementation of this method and reported experimental data in his 1987 pioneer article titled \"A zero structure theorem for polynomial equations solving\".<ref>Wu, W. T. (1987). A zero structure theorem for polynomial equations solving. MM Research Preprints, 1, 2–12</ref> To put this work into context, let us recall what was the common idea of an algebraic set decomposition at the time this article was written.\n\nLet {{math|'''K'''}} be an [[algebraically closed field]] and {{math|'''k'''}} be a subfield of {{math|'''K'''}}. A subset {{math|''V'' ⊂ '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is an (affine) [[algebraic variety]] over {{math|'''k'''}} if there exists a polynomial set {{math|''F'' ⊂ '''k'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'']}} such that the zero set {{math|''V''(''F'') ⊂ '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} of {{mvar|F}} equals {{mvar|V}}.\n\nRecall that {{mvar|V}} is said '''irreducible''' if for all  algebraic varieties {{math|''V''<sub>1</sub>, ''V''<sub>2</sub> ⊂ '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} the relation {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''V''<sub>1</sub> ∪ ''V''<sub>2</sub>}} implies either {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''V''<sub>1</sub>}} or {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''V''<sub>2</sub>}}. A first algebraic variety decomposition result is the famous [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] which implies the following.\n\n:'''Theorem (Lasker - Noether).''' For each algebraic variety {{math|''V'' ⊂ '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} there exist finitely many irreducible algebraic varieties {{math|''V''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''V<sub>e</sub>'' ⊂ '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} such that we have\n::<math>  V = V_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup V_e. </math>\n:Moreover, if  {{math|''V<sub>i</sub>'' ⊈ ''V<sub>j</sub>''}} holds for {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' < ''j'' ≤ ''e''}} then the set {{math|{''V''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''V<sub>e</sub>''} }}is unique and forms the '''irreducible decomposition''' of {{mvar|V}}.\n\nThe varieties {{math|''V''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''V<sub>e</sub>''}} in the above Theorem are called the '''irreducible components''' of {{mvar|V}} and can be regarded as a natural output for a decomposition algorithm, or, in other words, for an algorithm solving a system of equations in {{math|'''k'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'']}}.\n\nIn order to lead to a computer program, this algorithm specification  should prescribe how irreducible components are represented.  Such an encoding is introduced  by [[Joseph Ritt]]<ref>Ritt, J. (1966). Differential Algebra. New York, Dover Publications</ref>  through the following result.\n\n:'''Theorem (Ritt).''' If {{math|''V'' ⊂ '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a non-empty and irreducible variety then one can compute a reduced triangular set {{mvar|C}} contained in the ideal <math>\\langle F \\rangle</math> generated by {{mvar|F}} in {{math|'''k'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'']}} and such that all polynomials {{mvar|g}} in <math>\\langle F \\rangle</math> reduces to zero by pseudo-division w.r.t {{mvar|C}}.\n\nWe call the set {{mvar|C}} in Ritt's Theorem a '''Ritt characteristic set''' of the ideal <math>\\langle F \\rangle</math>. Please refer to [[regular chain]] for the notion of a triangular set.\n\n[[Joseph Ritt]] described  a method for solving polynomial systems  based on polynomial factorization over field extensions and computation of characteristic sets of prime ideals.\n\nDeriving a practical implementation of this method, however,  was and remains a difficult problem. In the 80's, when the [[Wu's method of characteristic set|Characteristic set]] Method was introduced,  polynomial factorization was an active research area and certain fundamental questions on this subject were solved  recently<ref>A. M. Steel Conquering inseparability: Primary decomposition and multivariate factorization over algebraic function fields of positive characteristic</ref>\n\nNowadays, decomposing an algebraic variety into irreducible components is not essential to process most application problems, since weaker notions of decompositions, less costly to compute, are sufficient.\n\nThe '''Characteristic Set Method''' relies on the following variant of Ritt's Theorem.\n\n:'''Theorem (Wen-Tsun Wu).''' For any finite polynomial set {{math|''F'' ⊂ '''k'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'']}}, one can compute a reduced triangular set <math>C \\subset \\langle F \\rangle</math> such that  all polynomial {{mvar|g}} in {{mvar|F}} reduces to zero by pseudo-division w.r.t {{mvar|C}}.\n\nDifferent concepts and algorithms extended the work of [[Wu Wenjun|Wen-Tsun Wu]]. In the early 90's, the notion of a [[regular chain]], introduced independently by Michael Kalkbrener in 1991 in his PhD Thesis and, by Lu Yang and Jingzhong Zhang<ref>Yang, L., Zhang, J. (1994).

Comput. 15(2): 143&ndash;167 (1993)</ref> regular chains are used to represent the generic zeros of the irreducible components of an algebraic variety.  In the original work of Yang and Zhang, they are used to decide whether a hypersurface intersects a quasi-variety (given by a regular chain).  [[Regular chain]]s have, in fact, several interesting properties and are the key notion in many algorithms for decomposing systems of algebraic or differential equations.\n\nRegular chains have been investigated in many papers.<ref>S.C.

Actually, the original formulation of Kalkbrener is quite  different from that of Yang and Zhang.  A bridge between these two notions, the point of view of Kalkbrener and that of Yang and Zhang, appears in Dongming Wang's paper.<ref>D. Wang. Computing Triangular Systems and Regular Systems.

In essence, this method is used to find the value of a unit from the value of a multiple, and hence the value of a multiple.\n\n==Examples==\n\nFor example, to solve the problem: \"A man walks 7 miles in 2 hours. How far does he walk in 7 hours?\", one would first [[calculate]] how far the man walks in 1 hour. One can safely assume that he would walk half the distance in half the time. Therefore, dividing by 2, the man walks 3.5 miles in 1 hour. Multiplying by 7 for 7 hours, the man walks 7x3.5=24.5 miles, or consider the distance travelled by the man be X, then divide it given distance that is 7 (x/7). It is equal to the time taken to travel X distance that is 7 hours divided by the time taken to travel 7 miles, that is 2 hours (7/2), therefore x/7=7/2, hence X=24.5 miles.\n\nThe same method can be applied to the problem: \"A man walks at 4 miles per hour. How long would it take him to cover 5 miles?\". Dividing by 4 shows that the man covers 1 mile in a quarter (0.25) of an hour. Multiplying by 5 shows that the man therefore takes 1 hour and a quarter (1.25 hours) to cover 5 miles. Similarly, by the second method, we can find the value of time taken to cover 5 miles.\nThe fir1st method is preferable and easier.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.math-only-math.com/unitary-method.html\n* http://thesaurus.maths.org/mmkb/entry.html?action=entryById&id=4175{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* http://tutorteddy.com/the_unitary_method.php\n\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]\n[[Category:Algebra]]"

      "text": "{{short description|Symbol that represent an indeterminate value}}\n{{about||variables in computer science|Variable (computer science)|other uses|Variable (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[elementary mathematics]], a '''variable''' is a symbol, commonly a single letter, that represents a number, called the ''value'' of the variable, which is either arbitrary, not fully specified, or unknown. Making [[Algebra#Algebra as a branch of mathematics|algebraic computations]] with variables as if they were explicit numbers allows one to solve a range of problems in a single computation. A typical example is the [[quadratic formula]], which allows one to solve every [[quadratic equation]] by simply substituting the numeric values of the coefficients of the given equation for the variables that represent them.\n\nThe concept of a ''variable'' is also fundamental in [[calculus]].\nTypically, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} involves two variables, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x''}}, representing respectively the [[value (mathematics)|value]] and the [[argument of a function|argument]] of the function. The term \"variable\" comes from the fact that, when the argument (also called the \"variable of the function\") ''varies'', then the value ''varies'' accordingly.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://cstl.syr.edu/fipse/algebra/unit1/..%5Cpart4%5Cappend1.htm | title =Appendix One Review of Constants and Variables | author =''[[Syracuse University]]'' | publisher =cstl.syr.edu | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140116020503/http://cstl.syr.edu/fipse/algebra/part4/append1.htm | archivedate =2014-01-16 | df = }}</ref>\n\nIn more advanced [[mathematics]], a ''variable'' is a symbol that denotes a mathematical object, which could be a [[number]], a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], or even a function.  In this case, the original property of \"variability\" of a variable is not kept (except, sometimes, for informal explanations).\n\nSimilarly, in [[computer science]], a ''[[variable (computer science)|variable]]'' is a name (commonly an alphabetic character or a word) representing some value stored in computer memory. In [[mathematical logic]], a ''variable'' is either a symbol representing an unspecified [[term (logic)|term]] of the theory, or a basic object of the theory, which is manipulated without referring to its possible intuitive interpretation.\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Variable\" comes from a Latin word, ''variābilis'', with \"''vari(us)''\"' meaning \"various\" and \"''-ābilis''\"' meaning \"-able\", meaning \"capable of changing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/variable|title=\"Variable\" Origin|publisher=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Genesis and evolution of the concept==\n\nIn the 7th century [[Brahmagupta]] used different colours to represent the unknowns in algebraic equations in the ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]''.

Viète's convention was to use consonants for known values and vowels for unknowns.<ref name=\"Fraleigh\">{{cite book\n | last = Fraleigh\n | first = John B.\n | authorlink =\n | title = A First Course in Abstract Algebra\n | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition = 4\n | year = 1989\n | location = United States\n | pages = 276\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-201-52821-5\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1637, [[René Descartes]] \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''\".<ref>Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'', (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref> Contrarily to Viète's convention, Descartes' is still commonly in use.\n\nStarting in the 1660s, [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] independently developed the [[infinitesimal calculus]], which essentially consists of studying how an [[infinitesimal]] variation of a ''variable quantity'' induces a corresponding variation of another quantity which is a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'' of the first variable (quantity). Almost a century later [[Leonhard Euler]] fixed the terminology of infinitesimal calculus and introduced the notation {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} for a function {{math|''f''}}, its '''variable''' {{math|''x''}} and its value {{math|''y''}}. Until the end of the 19th century, the word ''variable'' referred almost exclusively to the [[argument of a function|arguments]] and the [[value (mathematics)|values]] of functions.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, it appeared that the foundation of infinitesimal calculus was not formalized enough to deal with apparent paradoxes such as a [[continuous function]] which is nowhere [[differentiable function|differentiable]]. To solve this problem, [[Karl Weierstrass]] introduced a new formalism consisting of replacing the intuitive notion of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] by a formal definition. The older notion of limit was \"when the ''variable'' {{math|''x''}} varies and tends toward {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''(''x'')}} tends toward {{math|''L''}}\", without any accurate definition of \"tends\". Weierstrass replaced this sentence by the formula\n:<math>(\\forall \\epsilon >0) (\\exists \\eta >0) (\\forall x) \\;|x-a|<\\eta \\Rightarrow |L-f(x)|<\\epsilon,</math>\nin which none of the five variables is considered as varying.\n\nThis static formulation led to the modern notion of variable which is simply a symbol representing a [[mathematical object]] which either is unknown or may be replaced by any element of a given [[set (mathematics)|set]]; for example, the set of [[real number]]s.\n\n==Specific kinds of variables==\nIt is common for variables to play different roles in the same mathematical formula and names or qualifiers have been introduced to distinguish them.\nFor example, the general [[cubic equation]]\n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0,</math>\nis interpreted as having five variables: four, {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}}, which are taken to be given numbers and the fifth variable, {{math|''x'',}} is understood to be an ''unknown'' number. To distinguish them, the variable {{math|''x''}} is called ''an unknown'', and the other variables are called ''parameters'' or ''coefficients'', or sometimes ''constants'', although this last terminology is incorrect for an equation and should be reserved for the [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined by the left-hand side of this equation.\n\nIn the context of functions, the term ''variable'' refers commonly to the arguments of the functions. This is typically the case in sentences like \"[[function of a real variable]]\", \"{{math|''x''}} is the variable of the function {{math|1=''f'': ''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x'')}}\", \"{{math|''f''}} is a function of the variable {{math|''x''}}\" (meaning that the argument of the function is referred to by the variable {{math|''x''}}).\n\nIn the same context, variables that are independent of {{math|''x''}} define [[constant function]]s and are therefore called ''constant''. For example, a ''[[constant of integration]]'' is an arbitrary constant function that is added to a particular [[antiderivative]] to obtain the other antiderivatives. Because the strong relationship between [[polynomial]]s and [[polynomial function]], the term \"constant\" is often used to denote the coefficients of a polynomial, which are constant functions of the indeterminates.\n\nThis use of \"constant\" as an abbreviation of \"constant function\" must be distinguished from the normal meaning of the word in mathematics. A '''constant''', or '''[[mathematical constant]]''' is a well and unambiguously defined number or other mathematical object, as, for example, the numbers 0, 1, [[Pi|{{math|''π''}}]] and the [[identity element]] of a [[group (mathematics)|group]].\n\nOther specific names for variables are:\n* An '''unknown''' is a variable in an [[equation]] which has to be solved for.\n* An '''[[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]''' is a symbol, commonly called variable, that appears in a [[polynomial]] or a [[formal power series]]. Formally speaking, an indeterminate is not a variable, but a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] in the [[polynomial ring]] or the ring of [[formal power series]]. However, because of the strong relationship between polynomials or power series and the [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that they define, many authors consider indeterminates as a special kind of variables.\n* A '''[[parameter]]''' is a quantity (usually a number) which is a part of the input of a problem, and remains constant during the whole solution of this problem. For example, in [[mechanics]] the mass and the size of a solid body are ''parameters'' for the study of its movement. In [[computer science]], ''parameter'' has a different meaning and denotes an argument of a function.\n* '''[[Free variables and bound variables]]'''\n* A '''[[random variable]]''' is a kind of variable that is used in [[probability theory]] and its applications.\n\nIt should be emphasized that all these denominations of variables are of [[semantics|semantic]] nature and that the way of computing with them ([[syntax (logic)|syntax]]) is the same for all.\n\n===Dependent and independent variables===\n{{main|Dependent and independent variables}}\nIn [[calculus]] and its application to [[physics]] and other sciences, it is rather common to consider a variable, say {{math|''y''}}, whose possible values depend on the value of another variable, say {{math|''x''}}. In mathematical terms, the ''dependent'' variable {{math|''y''}} represents the value of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of {{math|''x''}}. To simplify formulas, it is often useful to use the same symbol for the dependent variable {{math|''y''}} and the function mapping {{math|''x''}} onto {{math|''y''}}. For example, the state of a physical system depends on measurable quantities such as the [[pressure]], the [[temperature]], the spatial position, ..., and all these quantities vary when the system evolves, that is, they are function of the time. In the formulas describing the system, these quantities are represented by variables which are dependent on the time, and thus considered implicitly as functions of the time.\n\nTherefore, in a formula, a '''dependent variable''' is a variable that is implicitly a function of another (or several other) variables. An '''independent variable''' is a variable that is not dependent.<ref>Edwards Art. 5</ref>\n\nThe property of a variable to be dependent or independent depends often of the point of view and is not intrinsic. For example, in the notation {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, the three variables may be all independent and the notation represents a function of three variables. On the other hand, if {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} depend on {{math|''x''}} (are ''dependent variables'') then the notation represents a function of the single ''independent variable'' {{math|''x''}}.<ref>Edwards Art. 6</ref>\n\n===Examples===\nIf one defines a function ''f'' from the [[real number]]s to the real numbers by\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2+\\sin(x+4)</math>\n\nthen ''x'' is a variable standing for the [[argument of a function|argument]] of the function being defined, which can be any real number. In the identity\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n i = \\frac{n^2+n}2</math>\n\nthe variable ''i'' is a summation variable which designates in turn each of the integers 1, 2, ...,  ''n'' (it is also called '''index''' because its variation is over a discrete set of values) while ''n'' is a parameter (it does not vary within the formula).\n\nIn the theory of [[polynomials]], a polynomial of degree 2 is generally denoted as ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'', where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are called [[coefficient]]s (they are assumed to be fixed, i.e., parameters of the problem considered) while ''x'' is called a variable. When studying this polynomial for its [[polynomial function]] this ''x'' stands for the function argument. When studying the polynomial as an object in itself, ''x'' is taken to be an indeterminate, and would often be written with a capital letter instead to indicate this status.\n\n==Notation==\nIn mathematics, the variables are generally denoted by a single letter. However, this letter is frequently followed by a subscript, as in {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, and this subscript may be a number, another variable ({{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}}), a word or the abbreviation of a word ({{math|''x''<sub>in</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>out</sub>}}), and even a [[mathematical expression]]. Under the influence of [[computer science]], one may encounter in pure mathematics some variable names consisting in several letters and digits.\n\nFollowing the 17th century French philosopher and mathematician, [[René Descartes]], letters at the beginning of the alphabet, e.g.  ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are commonly used for known values and parameters, and letters at the end of the alphabet, e.g. ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are commonly used for unknowns and variables of functions.<ref name=E004>Edwards Art. 4</ref> In printed [[mathematics]], the norm is to set variables and constants in an [[italic type]]face.<ref>William L. Hosch (editor), ''The Britannica Guide to Algebra and Trigonometry'', Britannica Educational Publishing, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, {{ISBN|1-61530-219-0|978-1-61530-219-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ad0P0elU1_0C&pg=PA71 p. 71]</ref>\n\nFor example, a general quadratic function is conventionally written as:\n:<math>a x^2 + b x + c\\, ,</math>\nwhere ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are parameters (also called constants, because they are [[constant function]]s), while ''x'' is the variable of the function. A more explicit way to denote this function is\n:<math>x\\mapsto a x^2 + b x + c \\, ,</math>\nwhich makes the function-argument status of ''x'' clear, and thereby implicitly the constant status of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''. Since ''c'' occurs in a term that is a constant function of ''x'', it is called the [[constant term]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Foerster | first = Paul A. | title = Algebra and Trigonometry: Functions and Applications, Teacher's Edition | edition = Classics | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-13-165711-9 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ}}</ref>{{rp|18}}\n\nSpecific branches and applications of mathematics usually have specific [[naming convention]]s for variables.  Variables with similar roles or meanings are often assigned consecutive letters.  For example, the three axes in 3D [[coordinate space]] are conventionally called ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.  In physics, the names of variables are largely determined by the [[physical quantity]] they describe, but various naming conventions exist.\nA convention often followed in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] is to use ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' for the names of [[random variable]]s, keeping ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' for variables representing corresponding actual values.\n\nThere are many other notational usages. Usually, variables that play a similar role are represented by consecutive letters or by the same letter with different [[subscript]]. Below are some of the most common usages.\n* ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' (sometimes extended to ''e'' and ''f'') often represent parameters or [[coefficient]]s.\n* ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ... play a similar role, when otherwise too many different letters would be needed.\n* ''a<sub>i</sub>'' or ''u<sub>i</sub>'' is often used to denote the ''i''-th term of a [[sequence]] or the ''i''-th coefficient of a [[series (mathematics)|series]].\n* ''f'' and ''g'' (sometimes ''h'') commonly denote [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].\n* ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' (sometimes ''l'' or ''h'') are often used to denote varying [[integer]]s or indices in an [[indexed family]]. They may also be used to denote [[unit vector]]s.\n* ''l'' and ''w'' are often used to represent the length and width of a figure.\n* ''l'' is also used to denote a line.  In number theory, ''l'' often denotes a prime number not equal to ''p''.\n* ''n'' usually denotes a fixed integer, such as a count of objects or the degree of an [[equation]].\n** When two integers are needed, for example for the dimensions of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], one uses commonly ''m'' and ''n''.\n* ''p'' often denotes a [[prime number]]s or a [[probability]].\n* ''q'' often denotes a [[prime power]] or a [[quotient]]\n* ''r'' often denotes a [[radius]], a [[remainder]] or a [[correlation coefficient]].\n* ''t'' often denotes [[time]].\n* ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' usually denote the three [[Cartesian coordinates]] of a point in [[Euclidean geometry]]. By extension, they are used to name the corresponding [[axis (mathematics)|axes]].\n* ''z'' typically denotes a [[complex number]], or, in statistics, a [[normal distribution|normal random variable]].\n* ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''θ'' and ''φ'' commonly denote [[angle]] measures.\n* ''ε'' usually represents an arbitrarily small positive number.\n** ''ε'' and ''δ'' commonly denote two small positives.\n* ''λ'' is used for [[eigenvalues]].\n* ''σ'' often denotes a sum, or, in statistics, the [[standard deviation]].\n<!-- mu mean, pi probability, others? -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coefficient]]\n* [[Constant of integration]]\n* [[Constant term|Constant term of a polynomial]]\n* [[Free variables and bound variables]] (Bound variables are also known as dummy variables)\n* [[Indeterminate (variable)]]\n* [[Lambda calculus]]\n* [[Expression (mathematics)|Mathematical expression]]\n* [[Observable variable]]\n* [[Physical constant]]\n* [[Variable (computer science)]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| author=J.

He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1926, [[Master's degree|Masters]] in 1927, and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1928, at the age of 22.  All degrees were obtained from the [[University of Chicago]].  He married around the same time as his graduation. He spent his postdoctoral year at [[Princeton University]] and then from 1929 to 1931 he was an instructor at [[Columbia University]]. During this period he worked on [[Abelian varieties]] and their endomorphism algebras. He returned to Princeton for the opening year of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1933-34 and spent another year in Princeton in 1961-62 as the first Director of the Communications Research Division of IDA (the Institute for Defense Analyses).\n\nFrom 1931 to 1972, he served on the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago, where he became chair of the Mathematics Department in 1958 and Dean of the Physical Sciences Division in 1961.\n\nAs a research mathematician, he is primarily known for his work as one of the principal developers of the theory of [[linear associative algebra]]s and as a pioneer in the development of [[linear]] non-[[associative]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s, although all of this grew out of his work on [[endomorphism]] algebras of Abelian varieties.\n\nAs an [[applied mathematician]], he also did work for the military during [[World War II]] and thereafter.  One of his most notable achievements was his groundbreaking work on [[cryptography]]. He prepared a manuscript, \"Some Mathematical Aspects of Cryptography,\" for his invited address at a meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in November 1941. The theory that developed from this work can be seen in [[digital communications]] technologies.\n\nAfter WWII, he became a forceful advocate favoring government support for research in mathematics on a par with other physical sciences. He served on policy-making bodies at the [[Office of Naval Research]], the [[United States National Research Council]], and the [[National Science Foundation]] that funneled research grants into mathematics, giving many young mathematicians career opportunities previously unavailable.  Due to his success in helping to give mathematical research a sound financial footing, he earned a reputation as a \"statesman for mathematics.\" Albert was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1968.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n* A.

There he attended lectures of [[F. G. Frobenius]], [[Issai Schur]], and [[Hermann Schwarz]]. Sushkevich studied [[piano]] with L. V. Rostropovich, father of [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. In 1906 he was  a [[cello]] student at [[Stern Conservatory]] (now part of [[Berlin University of the Arts]]). In 1911 he moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], graduating from the Imperial University in 1913.\n\nMoving to [[Kharkov]], Suskevich taught in secondary education while he pursued a graduate degree at [[Kharkov State University]]. His dissertation was ''The theory of operations as the general theory of groups''. Obtaining the degree, he became an assistant professor at the university in 1918, and adjunct professor in 1920.\n[[Voronezh State University]] employed Sushkevich in 1921 a professor of mathematics. He published the first edition of his ''Higher Algebra'' (1923). He published a generalization of [[Cayley's theorem]] for certain finite semigroups in 1926.<ref>A. Sushkevich (1926) \"Über die Darstellung der eindeutig nicht umkehrbaren Gruppen mittels der verallgemeinerten Substitutionen\", [[Matematicheskii Sbornik]] 33: 371–4</ref> The next year he was in Moscow for the Russian Mathematical Congress, and the following year in Bologna for the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].\n\nIn Kharkov, the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics was established in 1929 with Sushkevich as a member. With a rising interest in [[abstract algebra]], he wrote a second book on algebra: ''Foundations of Higher Algebra'' which was published both in Russian and Ukrainian. In 1933 he directed the Algebra & Number Theory section of Kharkov State University's department of mathematics. At that time Stalin caused a [[famine]] in Ukraine, the [[Holodomor]], killing millions especially in rural areas. Suskevich survived to edit new editions of his textbook that included \"new algebra\": [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, [[integral domain]]s, [[ring (mathematics)]]s, [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, and [[quaternion]]s. His original work, ''The Theory of Generalized Groups'' (1937) opened up the area of [[semigroup]]s. According to biographer Hollings, \"He sought to describe his semigroups of interest in terms of certain of their subgroups: from Sushkevich's point of view, [[group (mathematics)|group]]s were objects of known structure.\"(page 46)\n\n==Selected works==\n* 1928: {{Citation |title=Über die endlichen Gruppen ohne das Gesetz der eindeutigen Umkehrbarkeit | doi=10.1007/BF01459084 | mr=1512437  | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | issn=0025-5831 | volume=99 | issue=1 | pages=30–50}}.\n* 1929: \"On a generalization of the associative law\", [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] 31(1):204–14 {{doi|10.1090/S0002-9947-1929-1501476-0}} {{mr|id=1501476}}\n* 1951: \"Materials for the History of Algebra in Russia in the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries\", {{mr|id=00051749}}\n* 1954: ''Theory of Numbers'', second edition 1956 {{mr|id=0091286}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Christopher Hollings (2014) ''Mathematics Across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups'', chapter 3: Anton Kazimirovich Sushkevich, pages 45 to 76, [[American Mathematical Society]], {{ISBN|978-1-4704-1493-1}} {{mr|id=3494795}}\n* {{MacTutor|id=Suschkevich}}\n\n[[Category:20th-century Russian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Textbook writers]]\n[[Category:Algebraists]]"

The [[Arnold conjecture]] on the number of fixed points of [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphism]]s and [[Lagrangian intersection]]s were also a major motivation in the development of [[Floer homology]].\n\nIn 1999 he suffered a serious bike accident in Paris, resulting in [[traumatic brain injury]], and though he regained consciousness after a few weeks, he had amnesia and for some time could not even recognize his own wife at the hospital,<ref>Arnold: Yesterday and Long Ago (2010)</ref> but he went on to make a good recovery.<ref>Polterovich and Scherbak (2011)</ref>\n\nArnold worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in [[Moscow]] and at [[Paris Dauphine University]] up until his death. {{As of|2006}} he was reported to have the highest [[citation index]] among Russian scientists,<ref>[http://www.scientific.ru/whoiswho/gt1000_6.html List of Russian Scientists with High Citation Index]</ref> and [[h-index]] of 40.\n\nTo his students and colleagues Arnold was known also for his sense of humour.

His writings present a fresh, often [[geometric]] approach to traditional mathematical topics like [[ordinary differential equation]]s, and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics. The standard criticism about Arnold's pedagogy is that his books \"are beautiful treatments of their subjects that are appreciated by experts, but too many details are omitted for students to learn the mathematics required to prove the statements that he so effortlessly justifies.\" His defense is that his books are meant to teach the subject to \"those who truly wish to understand it\" (Chicone, 2007).<ref>Carmen Chicone (2007), Book review of \"Ordinary Differential Equations\", by Vladimir I. Arnold. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006. ''SIAM Review'' '''49'''(2):335–336. ''(Chicone mentions the criticism but does not agree with it.)''</ref>\n\nArnold was an outspoken critic of the trend towards high levels of abstraction in mathematics during the middle of the last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] school in France—initially had a negative impact on French [[mathematical education]], and then later on that of other countries as well.<ref>See [http://pauli.uni-muenster.de/~munsteg/arnold.html] and other essays in [http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~arnsem/Arnold/].</ref><ref name=\"interview1\">[http://www.ams.org/notices/199704/arnold.pdf An Interview with Vladimir Arnol'd], by S.

The affirmative answer to this general question was given in 1957 by Vladimir Arnold, then only nineteen years old and a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]. Kolmogorov had shown in the previous year that any function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of three-variable functions. Arnold then expanded on this work to show that only two-variable functions were in fact required, thus answering the Hilbert's question when posed for the class of continuous functions.\n\n=== Dynamical systems ===\n{{see also|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Arnold diffusion}}\n[[Jürgen Moser|Moser]] and Arnold expanded the ideas of [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] (who was inspired by questions of [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]) and gave rise to what is now known as [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] (or \"KAM theory\"), which concerns the persistence of some quasi-periodic motions (nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems) when they are perturbed. KAM theory shows that, despite the perturbations, such systems can be stable over an infinite period of time, and specifies what the conditions for this are.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Poincare's Prize: The Hundred-Year Quest to Solve One of Math's Greatest Puzzles|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iEBOce-4S2EC&pg=PT39|publisher = Penguin|date = 2008-07-29|isbn = 9781440634284|first = George G.|last = Szpiro | authorlink= George Szpiro}}</ref>\n\n===Singularity theory===\nIn 1965, Arnold attended [[René Thom]]'s seminar on [[catastrophe theory]].

Artin was one of the leading mathematicians of the twentieth century. He is best known for his work on [[algebraic number theory]], contributing largely to [[class field theory]] and a new construction of [[L-function]]s. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n===Parents===\nEmil Artin was born in Vienna to parents Emma Maria, née Laura (stage name Clarus), a [[soubrette]] on the operetta stages of [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], and Emil Hadochadus Maria Artin,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Austrian-born of mixed [[Austrians|Austrian]] and [[Armenian people|Armenian]] descent.<ref>[http://reporter.am/index.cfm?objectid=59BE5ED5-E7DA-11E0-8E3F0003FF3452C2 Armenia honors mathematician Dmitry Mirimanoff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124044728/http://reporter.am/index.cfm?objectid=59BE5ED5-E7DA-11E0-8E3F0003FF3452C2 |date=2012-11-24 }}</ref><ref>Ben Yandell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQXoG4pL1-kC&printsec= The honors class: Hilbert’s problems and their solvers], A K Peters, Ltd., 2002, {{ISBN|1568812167}}, 9781568812168</ref><ref name=\"AMS\">[http://www.ams.org/notices/200204/comm-steeleprz.pdf Notices of the AMS. Vol. 49, # 4, April 2002, pp. 469–470]</ref> Several documents, including Emil's birth certificate,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} list the father's occupation as “opera singer” though others list it as “art dealer.” It seems at least plausible that he and Emma had met as colleagues in the theater. They were married in St. Stephen's Parish on July 24, 1895.\n\n===Early education===\nArtin entered school in September 1904, presumably in Vienna. By then, his father was already suffering symptoms of advanced [[syphilis]], among them increasing mental instability, and was eventually institutionalized at the recently established (and imperially sponsored) [[insane asylum]] at Mauer Öhling, 125 kilometers west of Vienna.  It is notable that neither wife nor child contracted this highly infectious disease. Artin's father died there July 20, 1906.  Young Artin was eight.\n\nOn July 15, 1907, Artin's mother remarried to a man named Rudolf Hübner: a prosperous manufacturing entrepreneur in the German-speaking city then called Reichenberg, Bohemia (currently known as [[Liberec]], in the Czech Republic). Documentary evidence suggests that Emma had already been a resident in Reichenberg the previous year, and in deference to her new husband, she had abandoned her vocal career. Hübner deemed a life in the theater unseemly unfit for the wife of a man of his position.\n\nIn September, 1907, Artin entered the Volksschule in Strobnitz, a small town in southern Czechoslovakia near the Austrian border. For that year, he lived away from home, boarding on a local farm.  The following year, he returned to the home of his mother and stepfather, and entered the Realschule in Reichenberg, where he pursued his secondary education until June, 1916.\n\nIn Reichenberg, Artin formed a lifelong friendship with a young neighbor, Arthur Baer, who became an astronomer, teaching for many years at Cambridge University.  Astronomy was an interest the two boys shared already at this time. They each had telescopes. They also rigged a telegraph between their houses, over which once Baer excitedly reported to his friend an astronomical discovery he thought he had made—perhaps a supernova, he thought—and told Artin where in the sky to look. Artin tapped back the terse reply “A-N-D-R-O-M-E-D-A N-E-B-E-L.” ([[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda nebula]])\n\nArtin's academic performance in the first years at the Realschule was spotty. Up to the end of the 1911–1912 school year, for instance, his grade in mathematics was merely “genügend,” (satisfactory). Of his mathematical inclinations at this early period he later wrote, “Meine eigene Vorliebe zur Mathematik zeigte sich erst im sechzehnten Lebensjahr, während vorher von irgendeiner Anlage dazu überhaupt nicht die Rede sein konnte.” (“My own predilection for mathematics manifested itself only in my sixteenth year; before that, one could certainly not speak of any particular aptitude for it.”) His grade in French for 1912 was actually “nicht genügend” (unsatisfactory). He did rather better work in physics and chemistry. But from 1910 to 1912, his grade for “Comportment” was “nicht genügend.”\n\nArtin spent the school year 1912–1913 away from home, in [[France]], a period he spoke of later as one of the happiest of his life. He lived that year with the family of Edmond Fritz, in the vicinity of Paris, and attended a school there. When he returned from France to Reichenberg, his academic work markedly improved, and he began consistently receiving grades of “gut” or “sehr gut” (good or very good) in virtually all subjects—including French and “Comportment.” By the time he completed studies at the Realschule in June, 1916, he was awarded the Reifezeugnis (diploma—not to be confused with the Abitur) that affirmed him “reif mit Auszeichnung” (qualified with distinction) for graduation to a technical university.\n\n===University education===\nNow that it was time to move on to university studies, Artin was no doubt content but to leave Reichenberg, for relations with his stepfather were clouded. According to him, Hübner reproached him “day and night” with being a financial burden, and even when Artin became a university lecturer and then a professor, Hübner deprecated his academic career as self-indulgent and belittled its paltry emolument.\n\nIn October, 1916, Artin matriculated at the [[University of Vienna]], having focused by now on mathematics. He studied there with [[Philipp Furtwängler]], and also took courses in [[astrophysics]] and [[Latin]].\n\nStudies at Vienna were interrupted when Artin was drafted in June, 1918 into the Austrian army (his Army photo ID is dated July 1, 1918). Assigned to the K.u. K. 44th Infantry Regiment, he was stationed northwest of Venice at Primolano, on the [[Italy|Italian]] front in the foothills of the [[Dolomites]].  To his great relief, Artin managed to avoid combat by volunteering for service as a translator—his ignorance of Italian notwithstanding. He did know French, of course, and some Latin, was generally a quick study, and was motivated by a highly rational fear in a theater of that war that had often proven a meat-grinder. In his scramble to learn at least some Italian, Artin had recourse to an encyclopedia, which he once consulted for help in dealing with the cockroaches that infested the Austrian barracks. At some length, the article described a variety of technical methods, concluding finally with—Artin laughingly recalled in later years—“la caccia diretta\" (\"the direct hunt\"). Indeed, “la caccia diretta” was the straightforward method he and his fellow infantrymen adopted.\n\nArtin survived both war and vermin on the Italian front, and returned late in 1918 to the University of Vienna, where he remained through Easter of the following year.\n\nBy June 1919, he had moved to Leipzig and matriculated at the University there as a \"Class 2 Auditor\" (\"Hörer zweiter Ordnung\").  Late the same year, Artin undertook the formality of standing for a qualifying examination by an academic board of the Oberrealschule in [[Leipzig]], which he passed with the grade of “gut” (good), receiving for the second time the Reifezeugnis (diploma attesting the equivalence of satisfactory completion of 6 years at a Realschule). How this Leipzig Reifezeugnis differed technically from the one he had been granted at Reichenberg is unclear from the document, but it apparently qualified him for regular matriculation as a student at the University, which normally required the Abitur.\n\nFrom 1919 to June 1921, Artin pursued mostly mathematical studies at Leipzig.  His principal teacher and dissertation advisor was [[Gustav Herglotz]]. Additionally, Artin took courses in chemistry and various fields of [[physics]], including [[mechanics]], [[atomic theory]], [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwellian theory]], [[radioactivity]], and [[astrophysics]]. In June, 1921 he was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy degree, based on his “excellent” dissertation, “Quadratische Körper im Gebiete der höheren Kongruenzen“ (\"On the Arithmetic of Quadratic Function Fields over Finite Fields\"), and the oral examination which—his diploma affirms—he had passed three days earlier “with extraordinary success.”\n\nIn the fall of 1921, Artin moved to the [[University of Göttingen]], considered the \"Mecca\" of mathematics at the time, where he pursued one year of post-doctoral studies in mathematics and mathematical physics with [[Richard Courant]] and [[David Hilbert]]. While at Göttingen, he worked closely with [[Emmy Noether]] and [[Helmut Hasse]].\n\nAside from consistently good school grades in singing, the first documentary evidence of Artin's deep and lifelong engagement with music comes from the year in Göttingen, where he was regularly invited to join in the chamber music sessions hosted by [[Richard Courant]]. He played all the keyboard instruments, and was an especially accomplished flautist, although it is not known exactly by what instruction he had achieved proficiency on these instruments. He became especially devoted to the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Professorship at Hamburg===\nCourant arranged for Artin to receive a stipend for the summer of 1922 in Göttingen, which occasioned his declining a position offered him at the [[University of Kiel]]. The following October, however, he accepted an equivalent position at [[Hamburg]], where in 1923, he completed the Habilitation thesis (required of aspirants to a professorship in Germany), and on July 24 advanced to the rank of [[Privatdozent]].\n\nOn April 1, 1925, Artin was promoted to Associate Professor (außerordentlicher Professor). In this year also, Artin applied for and was granted German citizenship. He was promoted to full Professor (ordentlicher Professor) on October 15, 1926.\n\nEarly in the summer of 1925, Artin attended the Congress of the Wandervogel youth movement at Wilhelmshausen near [[Kassel]] with the intention of gathering a congenial group to undertake a trek through [[Iceland]] later that summer. Iceland (before the transforming presence of American and British forces stationed there during [[World War II]]) was still a primitive country in 1925, with a thinly scattered population and little transportation infrastructure.  Artin succeeded in finding six young men to join him in this adventure. In the second half of August, 1925, the group set out by steamer from Hamburg, first to [[Norway]], where they boarded a second steamer that took them to Iceland, stopping at several of the small east fjord ports before arriving at their destination, [[Húsavík]] in the north of the island.  Here the Wandervogel group disembarked, their initial goal, trekking down the Laxá River to Lake Mývatn.  They made a circuit of the large, irregular lake, staying in farm houses, barns, and occasionally a tent as they went. When they slept in barns, it was often on piles of wet straw or hay. On those lucky occasions when they slept in beds, it could be nearly as damp on account of the rain trickling through the sod roofs. The tent leaked as well.\n\nArtin kept a meticulous journal of this trip, making daily entries in a neat, minuscule hand. He and several of the young men had brought cameras, so that the trek is documented also by nearly 200 small photographs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Odefey, Alexander |year=2011 |title=Emil Artins Islandreise im Sommer 1925 |journal=Mitt. Math. Ges. Hamb.  |volume=30 |pages=127–180}}</ref>  Artin's journal attests to his overarching interest in the geology of this mid-Atlantic island, situated over the boundary of two tectonic plates whose shifting relation makes it geologically hyperactive.\n\nIn keeping with the Wandervogel ethos, Artin and his companions carried music with them wherever they visited. The young men had packed guitars and violins, and Artin played the harmoniums common in the isolated farmsteads where they found lodging. The group regularly entertained their Icelandic hosts, not in full exchange for board and lodging, to be sure, but for goodwill certainly, and sometimes for a little extra on their plates, or a modestly discounted tariff.\n\nFrom Lake Mývatn, Artin and his companions headed west towards Akureyri, passing the large waterfall Goðafoss on the way. From Akureyri, they trekked west down the Öxnadalur (Ox Valley) intending to rent pack horses and cross the high and barren interior by foot to [[Reykjavík]]. By the time they reached the lower end of Skagafjörður, however, they were persuaded by a local farmer from whom they had hoped to rent the horses that a cross-country trek was by then impracticable; with the approach of winter, highland routes were already snow-bound and impassable.  Instead of turning south, then, they turned north to Siglufjörður, where they boarded another steamer that took them around the western peninsula and down the coast to Reykjavík.  From Reykjavík, they returned via Norway to Hamburg. By Artin's calculation the distance they had covered on foot through Iceland totaled 450 kilometers.\n\nEarly in 1926, the [[University of Münster]] offered Artin a professorial position; however, Hamburg matched the offer financially, and (as noted above) promoted him to full professor, making him (along with his young colleague Helmut Hasse) one of the two youngest professors of mathematics in Germany.\n\nIt was in this period that he acquired his lifelong nickname, “Ma,” short for mathematics, which he came to prefer to his given name, and which virtually everyone who knew him well used. Although the nickname might seem to imply a narrow intellectual focus, quite the reverse was true of Artin. Even his teaching at the University of Hamburg went beyond the strict boundaries of mathematics to include mechanics and relativity theory. He kept up on a serious level with advances in astronomy, chemistry and biology (he owned and used a fine microscope), and the circle of his friends in Hamburg attests to the catholicity of his interests. It included the painter Heinrich Stegemann, and the author and organ-builder Hans Henny Jahn. Stegemann was a particularly close friend, and made portraits of Artin, his wife [[Natascha Artin Brunswick | Natascha]], and their two Hamburg-born children. Music continued to play a central role in his life; he acquired a Neupert double manual [[harpsichord]], and a [[clavichord]] made by the Hamburg builder Walter Ebeloe, as well as a silver [[flute]] made in Hamburg by  G. Urban. Chamber music gatherings became a regular event at the Artin apartment as they had been at the Courants in Göttingen.\n\nOn August 15, 1929, Artin married Natalia Naumovna Jasny (Natascha), a young [[Russians|Russian]] émigré who had been a student in several of his classes. One of their shared interests was photography, and when Artin bought a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] for their joint use (a Leica A, the first commercial model of this legendary camera), Natascha began chronicling the life of the family, as well as the city of Hamburg. For the next decade, she made a series of artful and expressive portraits of Artin that remain by far the best images of him taken at any age. Artin, in turn, took many fine and evocative portraits of Natascha.  Lacking access to a professional darkroom, their films and prints had to be developed in a makeshift darkroom set up each time (and then dismantled again) in the small bathroom of whatever apartment they were occupying.  The makeshift darkroom notwithstanding, the high artistic level of the resulting photographic prints is attested to by the exhibit of Natascha's photographs mounted in 2001 by the [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]], and its accompanying catalogue, “Hamburg—Wie Ich Es Sah.”\n\nIn 1930, Artin was offered a professorship at [[ETH Zurich|ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) in Zürich]], to replace [[Hermann Weyl]], who had moved to Göttingen. He chose to remain at Hamburg, however.  Two years later, in 1932, for contributions leading to the advancement of mathematics, Artin was honored—jointly with [[Emmy Noether]]—with the [[Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award]], which carried a grant of 500 marks.\n\n===Nazi period===\nIn January 1933, Natascha gave birth to their first child, Karin. A year and a half later, in the summer of 1934, son [[Michael Artin|Michael]] was born. The political climate at Hamburg was not so poisonous as that at Göttingen, where by 1935 the mathematics department had been purged of [[Jewish]] and dissident professors. Still, Artin's situation became increasingly precarious, not only because Natascha was half Jewish, but also because Artin made no secret of his distaste for the Hitler regime.  At one point, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], by then a [[Nazi Party]] member, but nonetheless solicitous of the Artins’ well-being, warned Artin discreetly to close his classroom door so his frankly anti-Nazi comments could not be heard by passersby in the hallway.\n\nNatascha recalled going down to the newsstand on the corner one day and being warned in hushed tones by the man from whom she and Artin bought their paper that a man had daily been watching their apartment from across the street. Once tipped off, she and Artin became very aware of the watcher (Natascha liked to refer to him as their “spy”), and even rather enjoyed the idea of his being forced to follow them on the long walks they loved taking in the afternoons to a café far out in the countryside.\n\nToying with their watcher on a fine autumn afternoon was one thing, but the atmosphere was in fact growing inexorably serious. Natascha's Jewish father and her sister, seeing the handwriting on the wall, had already left for the U.S. in the summer of 1933. As half-Jewish, Natascha's status was, if not ultimately quite hopeless, certainly not good. Hasse, like Blaschke a nationalistic supporter of the regime, had applied for Party membership, but was nonetheless no anti-Semite. Besides he was a long-time friend and colleague of Artin's. He suggested that the two Artin children—only one quarter Jewish, or in Nazi terminology, “[[Mischling]]e zweiten Grades”—might, if a few strategic strings could be pulled, be officially “aryanized.” Hasse offered to exert his influence with the Ministry of Education (Kultur- und Schulbehörde, Hochschulwesen), and Artin—not daring to leave any stone unturned, especially with respect to the safety of his children—went along with this effort. He asked his father-in-law, by then resident in [[Washington D.C.]], to draft and have notarized an affidavit attesting to the Christian lineage of his late wife, Natascha's mother. Artin submitted this affidavit to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail.\n\nBy this time, to be precise, on July 15, 1937, because of Natascha's status as “Mischling ersten Grades,” Artin had lost his post at the University—technically, compelled into early retirement—on the grounds of paragraph 6 of the Act to Restore the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums) of April 7, 1933. Ironically, he had applied only some months earlier, on February 8, 1937, for a leave of absence from the University in order to accept a position offered him at Stanford.  On March 15, 1937, the response had come back denying his application for leave on the grounds that his services to the University were indispensable (“Da die Tätigkeit des Professors Dr. Artin an der Universität Hamburg nicht entbehrt werden kann. . .”).\n\nBy July, when he was summarily “retired,” (“in Ruhestand versetzt”) the position at [[Stanford University]] had been filled. However, through the efforts of [[Richard Courant]] (by then at [[New York University]]), and Solomon Lefschetz at [[Princeton University]], a position was found for him at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]].\n\n===Emigration to the U.S.===\nThe family must have worked feverishly to prepare for emigration to the United States, for this entailed among other things packing their entire household for shipment.  Since German law forbade emigrants taking more than a token sum of money out of the country, the Artins sank all the funds at their disposal into shipping their entire household, from beds, tables, chairs and double-manual harpsichord down to the last kitchen knife, cucumber slicer, and potato masher to their new home. This is why each of their residences in the United States bore such a striking resemblance to the rooms photographed so beautifully by Natascha in their Hamburg apartment (see Natascha A. Brunswick, “Hamburg:  Wie Ich Es Sah,” Dokumente der Photographie 6, [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]], 2001, pp.&nbsp;48–53) .\n\nOn the morning they were to board the [[Hamburg-Amerika]] line ship in [[Bremerhaven]], October 21, 1937, daughter Karin woke with a high temperature. Terrified that should this opportunity be missed, the window of escape from [[Nazi Germany]] might close forever, Artin and Natascha chose to risk somehow getting Karin past emigration and customs officials without their noticing her condition. They managed to conceal Karin's feverish state, and without incident boarded the ship, as many left behind were tragically never able to do. When they landed a week later at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], Richard Courant and Natascha's father, the Russian agronomist Naum Jasny (then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture) were on the dock to welcome the family to the United States.\n\n===Bloomington years===\nIt was early November, 1937 by the time they arrived in South Bend, where Artin joined the faculty at Notre Dame, and taught for the rest of that academic year.  He was offered a permanent position the following year 170 miles to the south at Indiana University, in Bloomington. Shortly after the family resettled there, a second son, Thomas, was born on November 12, 1938.\n\nAfter moving to Bloomington, Artin quickly acquired a piano, and soon after that a [[Hammond Organ]], a recently invented electronic instrument that simulated the sound of a pipe organ. He wanted this instrument in order primarily to play the works of J. S. Bach, and because the pedal set that came with the production model had a range of only two octaves (not quite wide enough for all the Bach pieces), he set about extending its range. Music was a constant presence in the Artin household.  Karin played the cello, and then the piano as well, and Michael played the violin. As in Hamburg, the Artin living room was regularly the venue for amateur chamber music performances.\n\nThe circle of the Artins’ University friends reflected Artin's wide cultural and intellectual interests. Notable among them were [[Alfred Kinsey]] and his wife of the Psychology Department, as well as prominent members of the Fine Arts, Art History, Anthropology, German Literature, and Music Departments. For several summer semesters, Artin accepted teaching positions at other universities, viz., Stanford in 1939 and 1940, The [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor in 1941 and 1951, and The University of Colorado, in Boulder, in 1953. On each of these occasions, the family accompanied him.\n\nArtin insisted that only German be spoken in the house. Even Tom, born in the U.S., spoke German as his  first language, acquiring English only from his siblings and his playmates in the neighborhood; for the first four or five years of his life, he spoke English with a pronounced German accent. Consistent with his program of maintaining the family's German cultural heritage, Artin gave high priority to regularly reading German literature aloud to the children.  The text was frequently from Goethe's autobiographical \"Dichtung und Wahrheit,\" or his poems, \"Erlkönig,\" for instance.  Occasionally, he would read from an English text.  Favorites were [[Mark Twain]]'s \"Tom Sawyer,\" [[Charles Dickens]]’s “[[A Christmas Carol]],” and [[Oscar Wilde]]’s “The Canterville Ghost.”  For the Artin children, these readings replaced radio entertainment, which was strictly banned from the house.  There was a radio, but (with the notable exception of Sunday morning broadcasts by [[E. Power Biggs]] from the organ at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, to which Artin and Natascha listened still lounging in bed) it was switched on only to hear news of the war.  Similarly, the Artin household would never in years to come harbor a television set.  Once the war had ended, the radio was retired to the rear of a dark closet.\n\nAs German citizens, Artin and Natascha were technically classified as [[enemy aliens]] for the duration of the war. On April 12, 1945, with the end of the war in Europe only weeks away, they applied for naturalization as American citizens. American citizenship was granted them on February 7, 1946.\n\nOn the orders of a Hamburg doctor whom he had consulted about a chronic cough, Artin had given up smoking years before. He had vowed not to smoke so long as [[Adolf Hitler]] remained in power.  On May 8, 1945, at the news of [[Surrender of Germany|Germany's surrender]] and the fall of the Third Reich, Natascha made the mistake of reminding him of this vow, and in lieu of a champagne toast, he indulged in what was intended to be the smoking of a single, celebratory cigarette. Unfortunately, the single cigarette led to a second, and another after that.  Artin returned to heavy smoking for the rest of his life.\n\n===Princeton years===\nIf Göttingen had been the “Mecca” of mathematics in the 1920s and early ‘30s, Princeton, following the decimation of German mathematics under the Nazis, had become the center of the mathematical world in the 1940s. In April, 1946, Artin was appointed Professor at Princeton, at a yearly salary of $8,000. The family moved there in the fall of 1946.\n\nNotable among his graduate students at Princeton are Serge Lang, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, and Timothy O’Meara. Emil chose also to teach the honors section of Freshman calculus each year.  He was renowned for the elegance of his teaching.  Frei and Roquette write that Artin’s “main medium of communication was teaching and conversation:  in groups, seminars and in smaller circles.  We have many statements of people near to him describing his unpretentious way of communicating with everybody, demanding quick grasp of the essentials but never tired of explaining the necessary. He was open to all kinds of suggestions, and distributed joyfully what he knew.  He liked to teach, also to young students, and his excellent lectures, always well prepared but without written notes, were hailed for their clarity and beauty.”  (Emil Artin and Helmut Hasse:  Their Correspondence 1923–1934, Introduction.)\n\nWhenever he was asked whether mathematics was a science, Artin would reply unhesitatingly, “No. An art.” His elegant elaboration of this idea is often cited, and worth repeating here: “We all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners.  In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements.  Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous.  We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realizing that we have enabled our listeners to see at a glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.”\n\nIt has even been said—only half in jest—that his lectures could be too perfect, lulling a hearer into believing he had understood and assimilated an idea or a proof which, on waking the following day might seem as remote and chimerical as ever.\n\nDuring the Princeton years, Artin built a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} reflecting telescope to plans he found in the magazine ''Sky and Telescope'', which he subscribed to. He spent weeks in the basement attempting to grind the mirror to specifications, without success, and his continued failure to get it right led to increasing frustration.  Then, in California to give a talk, he made a side trip to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he discussed his project with the astronomers. Whether it was their technical advice, or Natascha's intuitive suggestion that it might be too cold in the basement, and that he should try the procedure upstairs in the warmth of his study (which he did), he completed the grinding of the mirror in a matter of days.  With this telescope, he surveyed the night skies over Princeton.\n\nIn September 1955, Artin accepted an invitation to visit [[Japan]]. From his letters, it is clear he was treated like royalty by the Japanese mathematical community, and was charmed by the country. He was interested in learning about the diverse threads of [[Buddhism]], and visiting its holy sites.  In a letter home he describes his visit to the temples at Nara. “Then we were driven to a place nearby, Horiuji [Horyu-ji] where a very beautiful Buddhist temple is. We were received by the abbot, and a priest translated into English. We obtained the first sensible explanation about modern Buddhism. The difficulty of obtaining such an explanation is enormous.  To begin with most Japanese do not know and do not understand our questions. All this is made more complicated by the fact that there are numerous sects and each one has another theory. Since you get your information only piece wise, you cannot put it together.  This results in an absurd picture. I am talking of the present day, not of its original form.”\n\nHis letter goes on to outline at length the general [[eschatological]] framework of Buddhist belief.  Then he adds, “By the way, a problem given by the [[Zen]]s for meditation is the following: If you clap your hands, does the sound come from the left hand or from the right?”\n\n==Return to Hamburg and personal life==\nThe following year, Artin took a leave of absence to return to Germany for the first time since emigration, nearly twenty years earlier. He spent the fall semester at Göttingen, and the next at Hamburg.  For the Christmas holidays, he travelled to his birthplace, Vienna, to visit his mother, Vienna being a city he had not seen in decades.  In a letter home he described the experience of his return in a single, oddly laconic sentence:  “It is kind of amusing to walk through Vienna again.” In 1957, an honorary doctorate was conferred on Artin by the [[University of Freiburg]].  That fall, he returned to Princeton for what would be his final academic year at that institution. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/bookofmembers/ChapterA.pdf|page=19|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nArtin's marriage to Natascha had by this time seriously frayed. Though nominally still husband and wife, resident in the same house, they were for all intents and purposes living separate lives. Artin was offered a professorship at Hamburg, and at the conclusion of Princeton's spring semester, 1958, he moved permanently to Germany.  His decision to leave Princeton University and the United States was complicated, based on multiple factors, prominent among them Princeton's (then operative) mandatory retirement age of 65. Artin had no wish to retire from teaching and direct involvement with students.  Hamburg's offer was open-ended.\n\nArtin and Natascha were divorced in 1959. In Hamburg, Artin had taken an apartment, but soon gave it over to his mother whom he had brought from Vienna to live near him in Hamburg. He in turn moved into the apartment of the mathematician [[Hel Braun]] in the same neighborhood; though they never married, their relationship was equivalent to marriage. On January 4, 1961, he was granted German citizenship. In June, 1962, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the death of [[Blaise Pascal]], the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand]] conferred an honorary doctorate on him. On December 20 of the same year, Artin died at home in Hamburg, aged 64, of a heart attack.\n\nThe University of Hamburg honored his memory on April 26, 2005 by naming one of its newly renovated lecture halls The Emil Artin Lecture Hall.<ref>[http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/opus/volltexte/2008/57/pdf/HamburgUP_HUR09_Artin.pdf Zum Gedenken an Emil Artin (1898–1962)]</ref>\n\n==Influence and work==\nArtin was one of the leading algebraists of the century, with an influence larger than might be guessed from the one volume of his ''Collected Papers'' edited by  [[Serge Lang]] and [[John Tate]]. He worked in [[algebraic number theory]], contributing largely to [[class field theory]] and a new construction of [[L-function]]s. He also contributed to the pure theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. The influential treatment of [[abstract algebra]] by [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] is said to derive in part from Artin's ideas, as well as those of [[Emmy Noether]]. Artin solved [[Hilbert's seventeenth problem]] in 1927. He also developed the [[Braid theory|theory of braids]]{{sfn|Artin|1947}} as a branch of [[algebraic topology]].\n\nIn 1955 Artin was teaching [[foundations of geometry]] at New York University. He used his notes to publish [[Geometric Algebra]] in 1957, where he extended the material to include [[symplectic geometry]].\n\nArtin was also an important expositor of [[Galois theory]], and of the [[group cohomology]] approach to class ring theory{{sfn|Artin|Tate|2009}} (with [[John Tate]]), to mention two theories where his formulations became standard.\n\n==Conjectures==\n\nHe left two conjectures, both known as '''Artin's conjecture'''. The [[Artin conjecture (L-functions)|first]] concerns [[Artin L-function]]s for a [[linear representation]] of a [[Galois group]]; and the [[Artin's conjecture on primitive roots|second]] the frequency with which a given integer ''a'' is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] modulo primes ''p'', when ''a'' is fixed and ''p'' varies. These are unproven; in 1967, [[Christopher Hooley|Hooley]] published a [[conditional proof]] for the second conjecture, assuming certain cases of the [[Generalized Riemann hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hooley, Christopher |year=1967 |title=On Artin's conjecture |journal=J. Reine Angew. Math. |volume=225 |pages=209–220}}</ref>\n\n==Supervision of research==\nArtin advised over thirty doctoral students, including [[Bernard Dwork]], [[Serge Lang]], [[Kollagunta Gopalaiyer Ramanathan|K. G. Ramanathan]], [[John Tate]], Harold N. Shapiro,<ref name=HNShapiroThesis/> [[Hans Zassenhaus]] and [[Max August Zorn|Max Zorn]].  A more complete list of his students can be found at the Mathematics Genealogy Project website (see \"External Links,\" below).\n\n==Family==\nIn 1932 he married [[Natascha Artin Brunswick|Natascha Jasny]], born in Russia to mixed parentage (her mother was Christian, her father, Jewish).<ref>[http://www.memorial2u.com/Biography/id/64/Natascha_Artin-Brunswick,_née_Jasny Natascha Artin–Brunswick, née Jasny | Memorial2U.com]</ref> Artin was not himself Jewish, but, on account of his wife's racial status in Nazi Germany, was dismissed from his university position in 1937. They had three children, one of whom is [[Michael Artin]], an American algebraist currently at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n*{{citation|mr=0165148 \n|last=Artin|first= Emil\n|title=The gamma function. \n|series= Athena Series: Selected Topics in Mathematics |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|place= New York-Toronto-London |year=1964 |origyear=1931}} Reprinted in {{harv|Artin|2007}}\n*{{citation  |last=Artin  |first=Emil  |title=Theory of braids  |journal=Ann. of Math. |series= 2  |volume=48 |year=1947  |pages=101–126  |issn=0003-486X |mr=0019087|jstor=1969218 |doi=10.2307/1969218}}\n* {{citation| first=Emil |last=Artin | title=Galois Theory | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.  | year=1998 | isbn=0-486-62342-4|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndml/1175197041|origyear=1944}}<ref>{{cite journal|author=Albert, A.

His parents were [[Natascha Artin Brunswick|Natalia Naumovna Jasny]] (Natascha) and [[Emil Artin]], preeminent algebraist of the 20th century.

His work on the problem of characterising the [[representable functor]]s in the [[category of schemes]] has led to the [[Artin approximation theorem]], in [[local algebra]]. This work also gave rise to the ideas of an [[algebraic space]] and [[algebraic stack]], and has proved very influential in [[moduli theory]].  Additionally, he has made contributions to the [[deformation theory]] of algebraic varieties. He began to turn his interest from [[algebraic geometry]] to [[noncommutative algebra]] ([[noncommutative ring]] theory), especially geometric aspects, after a talk by [[Shimshon Amitsur]] and an encounter in [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] with [[Claudio Procesi]] and [[Lance W. Small]], \"which prompted [his] first foray into ring theory\".<ref>From the MacTutor biography: \"His main research area changed from algebraic geometry to noncommutative ring theory\".</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Artin won the [[American Mathematical Society]]'s annual [[Leroy P.

He then went to study [[philosophy]] at [[Freiburg]] in 1921. While he was at [[Göttingen]] in 1922 he was influenced by [[Emmy Noether]] and [[Hellmuth Kneser]]. In 1924 he won a scholarship for specially gifted students. Baer wrote up his doctoral dissertation and it was published in [[Crelle's Journal]] in 1927.\n\nBaer accepted a post at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in 1928. There, he published [[Ernst Steinitz]]'s \"Algebraische Theorie der Körper\" with [[Helmut Hasse]], first published in Crelle's Journal in 1910.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id= Baer}}</ref>\n\nWhile Baer was with his wife in [[Austria]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came into power. Both of Baer's parents were Jewish, and he was for this reason informed that his services at Halle were no longer required. [[Louis Mordell]] invited him to go to [[Manchester]] and Baer accepted.\n\nBaer stayed at Princeton University and was a visiting scholar at the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] from 1935 to 1937.<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=7 Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106144411/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=7 |date=2013-01-06 }}</ref>  For a short while he lived in [[North Carolina]].

(See Trigonometry section below.)\n\n===Arithmetic ===\nBhaskara's [[arithmetic]] text ''[[Lilavati|Leelavati]]'' covers the topics of definitions, arithmetical terms, interest computation, arithmetical and geometrical progressions, [[plane (geometry)|plane geometry]], [[solid geometry]], the shadow of the [[gnomon]], methods to solve [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] equations, and [[combination]]s.\n\n''Lilavati'' is divided into 13 chapters and covers many branches of mathematics, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and a little trigonometry and measurement.

His contributions to this topic are particularly important,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} since the rules he gives are (in effect) the same as those given by the [[renaissance]] European mathematicians of the 17th century, yet his work was of the 12th century. Bhaskara's method of solving was an improvement of the methods found in the work of [[Aryabhata]] and subsequent mathematicians.\n\nHis work is outstanding for its systemisation, improved methods and the new topics that he has introduced. Furthermore, the ''Lilavati'' contained excellent recreative problems and it is thought that Bhaskara's intention may have been that a student of 'Lilavati' should concern himself with the mechanical application of the method.{{cn|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Algebra===\nHis ''Bijaganita'' (\"''[[Algebra]]''\") was a work in twelve chapters. It was the first text to recognize that a positive number has two [[square root]]s (a positive and negative square root).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">50 Timeless Scientists von K.Krishna Murty</ref> His work ''Bijaganita'' is effectively a treatise on algebra and contains the following topics:\n\n* Positive and [[negative number]]s.\n* The 'unknown' (includes determining unknown quantities).\n* Determining unknown quantities.\n* [[Nth root#Working with surds|Surd]]s (includes evaluating surds).\n* ''[[Kuṭṭaka]]'' (for solving [[indeterminate equation]]s and [[Diophantine equation]]s).\n* Simple equations (indeterminate of second, third and fourth degree).\n* Simple equations with more than one unknown.\n* Indeterminate [[quadratic equation]]s (of the type ax<sup>2</sup> + b = y<sup>2</sup>).\n* Solutions of indeterminate equations of the second, third and fourth degree.\n* Quadratic equations.\n* Quadratic equations with more than one unknown.\n* Operations with products of several unknowns.\n\nBhaskara derived a cyclic, [[chakravala method|''chakravala'' method]] for solving indeterminate quadratic equations of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = y.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Bhaskara's method for finding the solutions of the problem Nx<sup>2</sup> + 1 = y<sup>2</sup> (the so-called \"[[Pell's equation]]\") is of considerable importance.{{sfn|Stillwell1999|p=74}}\n\n===Trigonometry===\n\nThe ''[[Siddhānta Shiromani]]'' (written in 1150) demonstrates Bhaskara's knowledge of trigonometry, including the sine table and relationships between different trigonometric functions. He also developed [[spherical trigonometry]], along with other interesting [[trigonometry|trigonometrical]] results. In particular Bhaskara seemed more interested in trigonometry for its own sake than his predecessors who saw it only as a tool for calculation. Among the many interesting results given by Bhaskara, results found in his works include computation of sines of angles of 18 and 36 degrees, and the now well known formulae for <math> \\sin\\left(a + b\\right) </math> and <math> \\sin\\left(a - b\\right) </math>.\n\n===Calculus===\nHis work, the ''[[Siddhānta Shiromani]]'', is an astronomical treatise and contains many theories not found in earlier works.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Preliminary concepts of [[Non-standard calculus|infinitesimal calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]], along with a number of results in [[trigonometry]], [[differential calculus]] and [[integral|integral calculus]] that are found in the work are of particular interest.\n\nEvidence suggests Bhaskara was acquainted with some ideas of differential calculus.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Bhaskara also goes deeper into the 'differential calculus' and suggests the differential coefficient vanishes at an extremum value of the function, indicating knowledge of the concept of '[[infinitesimal]]s'.{{sfn|Shukla|1984|pp=95–104}}\n\n* There is evidence of an early form of [[Rolle's theorem]] in his work\n** If <math> f\\left(a\\right) = f\\left(b\\right) = 0 </math> then <math> f'\\left(x\\right) = 0 </math> for some <math>\\ x </math> with <math>\\ a < x < b </math>\n* He gave the result that if <math>x \\approx y</math> then <math>\\sin(y) - \\sin(x) \\approx (y - x)\\cos(y)</math>, thereby finding the derivative of sine, although he never developed the notion of derivatives.{{sfn|Cooke|1997|pp=213–215}}\n** Bhaskara uses this result to work out the position angle of the [[ecliptic]], a quantity required for accurately predicting the time of an eclipse.\n* In computing the instantaneous motion of a planet, the time interval between successive positions of the planets was no greater than a ''[[truti]]'', or a {{Fraction|1|33750}} of a second, and his measure of velocity was expressed in this infinitesimal unit of time.\n* He was aware that when a variable attains the maximum value, its [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] vanishes.\n* He also showed that when a planet is at its farthest from the earth, or at its closest, the equation of the centre (measure of how far a planet is from the position in which it is predicted to be, by assuming it is to move uniformly) vanishes. He therefore concluded that for some intermediate position the differential of the equation of the centre is equal to zero.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In this result, there are traces of the general [[mean value theorem]], one of the most important theorems in analysis, which today is usually derived from Rolle's theorem. The mean value theorem was later found by [[Parameshvara]] in the 15th century in the ''Lilavati Bhasya'', a commentary on Bhaskara's ''Lilavati''.\n\n[[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Madhava]] (1340–1425) and the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala School]] mathematicians (including Parameshvara) from the 14th century to the 16th century expanded on Bhaskara's work and further advanced the development of [[calculus]] in India.\n\n==Astronomy==\nUsing an astronomical model developed by [[Brahmagupta]] in the 7th century, Bhāskara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the [[sidereal year]], the time that is required for the Earth to orbit the Sun, as approximately 365.2588 days which is the same as in Suryasiddhanta. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The modern accepted measurement is 365.25636 [[day]]s, a difference of just 3.5 minutes.<ref name=IERS>[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html IERS EOP PC Useful constants].\nAn SI day or mean solar day equals 86400 [[SI]] [[second]]s.\nFrom the mean longitude referred to the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|mean ecliptic]] and the equinox J2000 given in Simon, J.

This device could vary from a simple stick to V-shaped staffs designed specifically for determining angles with the help of a calibrated scale.{{sfn|Selin|2008|pp=269–273}}\n\n==Legends==\nIn his book ''[[Lilavati]]'', he reasons: \"In this quantity also which has zero as its divisor there is no change even when many quantities have entered into it or come out [of it], just as at the time of destruction and creation when throngs of creatures enter into and come out of [him, there is no change in] the infinite and unchanging [Vishnu]\".{{sfn|Colebrooke|1817|p = }}\n\n===\"Behold!\"===\nIt has been stated, by several authors, that Bhaskara II proved the Pythagorean theorem by drawing a diagram and providing the single word \"Behold!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1990|page=228}}</ref><ref name=Burton>{{harvnb|Burton|2011|page=106}}</ref> Sometimes Bhaskara's name is omitted and this is referred to as the ''Hindu proof'', well known by schoolchildren.<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2005|pages=19–20}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as mathematics historian Kim Plofker points out, after presenting a worked out example, Bhaskara II states the Pythagorean theorem:\n<blockquote>Hence, for the sake of brevity, the square root of the sum of the squares of the arm and upright is the hypotenuse: thus it is demonstrated.<ref name=Plofker1>{{harvnb|Plofker|2007|page=477}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThis is followed by:\n<blockquote>\nAnd otherwise, when one has set down those parts of the figure there [merely] seeing [it is sufficient].<ref name=Plofker1 />\n</blockquote>\nPlofker suggests that this additional statement may be the ultimate source of the widespread \"Behold!\" legend.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Indian mathematicians]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=sbrao1>{{citation | author = S.

(London); M.A. (Cantab.)\n\n==Career==\nHe was a lecturer at [[University of Southampton]], lecturer then reader at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], and Professor of Mathematics at the [[London School of Economics]]. He has been on the [[editorial board]] of a number of journals, including the ''[[Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics]]''. He has been a member of the Council of the [[London Mathematical Society]].\n\nHe has written 12 books and over 100 papers on mathematical topics, many of them in [[algebraic combinatorics]] and its applications. He became [[Emeritus Professor]] in 2006 and continue to teach History of Mathematics in Finance and Economics for undergraduates. He is also Vice-President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics.\n\n==Family==\nBiggs married Christine Mary Farmer in 1975 and has one daughter Clare Juliet born in 1980.\n\n==Interests and Hobbies==\nBiggs' interests include [[computational learning theory]], the [[history of mathematics]] and historical [[metrology]]. Since 2006, he has been an [[Emeritus Professor]] at the London School of Economics.\n\nBiggs hobbies consist of writing about the history of weights and scales. He currently holds the position of Chair of the International Society of Antique Scale Collectors (Europe), and a member of the [[British Numismatic Society]].\n\n==Work==\n\n===Mathematics===\nIn 2002, Biggs wrote the second edition of ''Discrete Mathematics'' breaking down a wide range of topics into a clear and organised style. Biggs organised the book into four major sections; The Language of Mathematics, Techniques, [[Algorithms]] and [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|Graphs]], and Algebraic Methods. This book was an accumulation of ''Discrete Mathematics'', first edition, textbook published in 1985 which dealt with calculations involving a [[finite set|finite number]] of steps rather than limiting processes. The second edition added nine new introductory chapters; Fundamental language of mathematicians, [[Proposition|statements]] and [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], the logical framework, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[functions (mathematics)|functions]], and [[number system]]. This book stresses the significance of simple [[logical reasoning]], shown by the exercises and examples given in the book. Each chapter contains modelled solutions, examples, exercises including hints and answers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Biggs |first=Norman L. |authorlink=Norman L. Biggs |year=2002 |title=Discrete Mathematics |edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n===Algebraic Graph Theory===\nIn 1974, Biggs published ''Algebraic Graph Theory'' which articulates properties of graphs in algebraic terms, then works out theorems regarding them. In the first section, he tackles the applications of [[linear algebra]] and [[matrix theory]]; algebraic constructions such as [[adjacency matrix]] and the [[incidence matrix]] and their applications are discussed in depth. Next, there is and wide-ranging description of the theory of chromatic [[polynomials]]. The last section discusses [[symmetry]] and regularity properties. Biggs makes important connections with other branches of [[algebraic combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/discrete-mathematics-information-theory-and-coding/algebraic-graph-theory-2nd-edition?format=PB| title=Algebraic Graph Theory| publisher=[[Cambridge Mathematical Library]] | location=UK | accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Computational Learning Theory===\nIn 1997, N. Biggs and M. Anthony wrote a book titled ''Computational Learning Theory: an Introduction''. Both Biggs and Anthony focused on the necessary background material from [[logic]], [[probability]], and [[Complex systems|complex theory]]. This book is an introduction to computational learning.\n\n===History of Mathematics===\nBiggs contributed to thirteen journals and books developing topics such as the four-colour conjecture, the roots/history of [[combinatorics]], [[calculus]], Topology on the 19th century, and mathematicians.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/norman/Personal.htm | title=Personal Details | publisher=[[London School of Economics]] | location=UK | accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> In addition, Biggs examined the ideas of [[William Ludlam]], [[Thomas Harriot]], [[John Arbuthnot]], and [[Leonhard Euler]].<ref>{{cite journal| title=Thomas Harriot | doi=10.1080/17498430.2013.721331 | volume=28 |issue = 2| year=2013 | journal=BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics | pages=66–74 | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Norman}}</ref>\n\n==Chip-Firing Game==\n{{main|Chip-firing game}}\n\nThe chip-firing game has been around for less than 20 years.

He is best known for his work in [[lattice theory]].\n\nThe mathematician [[George Birkhoff]] (1884&ndash;1944) was his father.\n\n==Life==\nThe son of the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]], Garrett was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff. [https://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/hs/cos.pdf#page=90 ''A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS: The Institute for Advanced Study Faculty and Members 1930-1980''], p. 90. [[Institute for Advanced Study]], 1980. Accessed November 20, 2015. \"Birkhoff, Garrett 40s M Born 1911 Princeton, NJ.\"</ref> He began the [[Harvard University]] BA course in 1928 after less than seven years of prior formal education. Upon completing his Harvard BA in 1932, he went to [[Cambridge University]] in England to study [[mathematical physics]] but switched to studying [[abstract algebra]] under [[Philip Hall]]. While visiting the [[University of Munich]], he met [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] who pointed him towards two important texts, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|Van der Waerden]] on [[abstract algebra]] and [[Andreas Speiser|Speiser]] on [[group theory]].\n\nBirkhoff held no Ph.D., a qualification British higher education did not emphasize at that time, and did not even bother obtaining an M.A. Nevertheless, after being a member of Harvard's [[Society of Fellows]], 1933&ndash;36, he spent the rest of his career teaching at Harvard. From these facts can be inferred the number and quality of Birkhoff's papers published by his 25th year.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Birkhoff, along with his Harvard colleagues [[Marshall Stone]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], substantially advanced American teaching and research in [[abstract algebra]]. In 1941 he and Mac Lane published ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'', the second undergraduate textbook in English on the subject ([[Cyrus Colton MacDuffee]]'s ''An Introduction to Abstract Algebra'' was published in 1940). Mac Lane and Birkhoff's ''Algebra'' (1967) is a more advanced text on [[abstract algebra]]. A number of papers he wrote in the 1930s, culminating in his monograph, ''Lattice Theory'' (1940; the third edition remains in print), turned [[lattice theory]] into a major branch of [[abstract algebra]]. His 1935 paper, \"On the Structure of Abstract Algebras\" founded a new branch of mathematics, [[universal algebra]]. Birkhoff's approach to this development of universal algebra and lattice theory acknowledged prior ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schröder]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]; in fact, Whitehead had written an 1898 monograph entitled ''Universal Algebra''. Further, in 1935, Birkoff showed that any equivalence between expressions that holds for all possible forms of operator must have a finite proof using certain underlying rules about equality. However, as soon as one introduces actual axioms that constrain the operators this is no longer true—and in general it can be undecidable whether or not a particular equivalence holds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1172|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}</ref>\n\nDuring and after [[World War II]], Birkhoff's interests gravitated towards what he called \"engineering\" mathematics. During the war, he worked on radar aiming and ballistics, including the [[bazooka]]. In the development of weapons, mathematical questions arose, some of which had not yet been addressed by the literature on fluid dynamics. Birkhoff's research was presented in his texts on fluid dynamics, ''Hydrodynamics'' (1950) and ''Jets, Wakes and Cavities'' (1957).\n\nBirkhoff, a friend of [[John von Neumann]], took a close interest in the rise of the electronic computer. Birkhoff supervised the Ph.D. thesis of [[David M. Young, Jr.|David M. Young]] on the numerical solution of [[Poisson's equation|the partial differential equation of Poisson]], in which Young proposed the [[successive over-relaxation]] (SOR) method. Birkhoff then worked with [[Richard S. Varga]], a former student, who was employed at [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]] of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electronic Corporation]] in Pittsburgh and was helping to design nuclear reactors. Extending the results of Young, the Birkhoff-Varga collaboration led to many publications on [[positive operator]]s and [[iterative method]]s for ''p''-cyclic matrices.\n\nBirkhoff's research and consulting work (notably for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]) developed computational methods besides numerical linear algebra, notably the representation of smooth curves via [[cubic spline]]s.\n\nBirkhoff published more than 200 papers and supervised more than 50 Ph.D.s. He was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] for the academic year 1948–1949 and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics#Presidents|president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] for 1966–1968. He won a [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Birkhoff, Garrett|title=Current trends in algebra|journal=Amer. Math.

Crossley, The Emergence of Number (1987), p.95.</ref>}} was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]]. Born in [[Bologna]], he is the author of a treatise on [[algebra]] and is a central figure in the understanding of [[imaginary number]]s.\n\nHe was the one who finally managed to address the problem with imaginary numbers. In his 1572 book, ''L'Algebra'', Bombelli solved equations using the method of [[Scipione del Ferro|del Ferro]]/[[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]]. He introduced the rhetoric that preceded the representative symbols +''i'' and -''i'' and described how they both worked.\n\n==Life==\nRafael Bombelli was baptised on 20 January 1526<ref>http://www.gavagai.de/philosoph/HHP78.htm</ref> in Bologna, [[Papal States]].  He was born to Antonio Mazzoli, a wool merchant, and Diamante Scudieri, a tailor's daughter. The [[Mazzoli]] family was once quite powerful in Bologna.  When [[Pope Julius II]] came to power, in 1506, he exiled the ruling family, the [[Bentivoglios]]. The Bentivoglio family attempted to retake Bologna in 1508, but failed.  Rafael's grandfather participated in the coup attempt, and was captured and executed.  Later, Antonio was able to return to Bologna, having changed his surname to Bombelli to escape the reputation of the Mazzoli family.  Rafael was the oldest of six children.  Rafael received no college education, but was instead taught by an engineer-architect by the name of [[Pier Francesco Clementi]].\n\nRafael Bombelli felt that none of the works on algebra by the leading mathematicians of his day provided a careful and thorough exposition of the subject.  Instead of another convoluted treatise that only mathematicians could comprehend, Rafael decided to write a book on algebra that could be understood by anyone.  His text would be self-contained and easily read by those without higher education.\n\nRafael Bombelli died in 1572 in Rome, Italy.\n\n==Bombelli's ''Algebra''==\n[[Image:Bombelli - Algebra, 1572 - 56656.jpg|thumb|''Algebra'', 1572]]\n\nIn the book that was published in 1572, entitled ''Algebra'', Bombelli gave a comprehensive account of the algebra known at the time.  He was the first European to write down the way of performing computations with negative numbers.  The following is an excerpt from the text:\n\n\t\"Plus times plus makes plus <br />\n\tMinus times minus makes plus <br />\n\tPlus times minus makes minus <br />\n\tMinus times plus makes minus <br />\n\tPlus 8 times plus 8 makes plus 64 <br />\n\tMinus 5 times minus 6 makes plus 30 <br />\n\tMinus 4 times plus 5 makes minus 20 <br />\n\tPlus 5 times minus 4 makes minus 20\"\n\nAs was intended, Bombelli used simple language as can be seen above so that anybody could understand it.  But at the same time, he was thorough.\n\nPerhaps more importantly than his work with algebra, however, the book also includes Bombelli's monumental contributions to [[complex number]] theory.  Before he writes about complex numbers, he points out that they occur in solutions of equations of the form <math>x^3 = ax + b,</math> given that <math>(a/3)^3 > (b/2)^2,</math> which is another way of stating that the discriminant of the cubic is negative.  The solution of this kind of equation requires taking the cube root of the sum of one number and the square root of some negative number.\n\nBefore Bombelli delves into using imaginary numbers practically, he goes into a detailed explanation of the properties of complex numbers.  Right away, he makes it clear that the rules of arithmetic for imaginary numbers are not the same as for real numbers.  This was a big accomplishment, as even numerous subsequent mathematicians were extremely confused on the topic.\n\nBombelli avoided confusion by giving a special name to square roots of negative numbers, instead of just trying to deal with them as regular radicals like other mathematicians did.  This made it clear that these numbers were neither positive nor negative.  This kind of system avoids the confusion that Euler encountered.  Bombelli called the imaginary number ''i'' “plus of minus” and used “minus of minus” for -''i''.\n\nBombelli had the foresight to see that imaginary numbers were crucial and necessary to solving quartic and cubic equations.  At the time, people cared about complex numbers only as tools to solve practical equations.  As such, Bombelli was able to get solutions using [[Scipione del Ferro#The Solution of the Cubic Equation|Scipione del Ferro's rule]], even in the irreducible case, where other mathematicians such as [[Cardano]] had given up.\n\nIn his book, Bombelli explains complex arithmetic as follows:\n\n\t\"Plus by plus of minus, makes plus of minus. <br />\n\tMinus by plus of minus, makes minus of minus. <br />\n\tPlus by minus of minus, makes minus of minus. <br />\n\tMinus by minus of minus, makes plus of minus. <br />\n\tPlus of minus by plus of minus, makes minus. <br />\n\tPlus of minus by minus of minus, makes plus. <br />\n\tMinus of minus by plus of minus, makes plus. <br />\n\tMinus of minus by minus of minus makes minus.\"\n\nAfter dealing with the multiplication of real and imaginary numbers, Bombelli goes on to talk about the rules of addition and subtraction.  He is careful to point out that real parts add to real parts, and imaginary parts add to imaginary parts.\n\n==Reputation==\n\nBombelli is generally regarded as the inventor of complex numbers, as no one before him had made rules for dealing with such numbers, and no one believed that working with imaginary numbers would have useful results.  Upon reading Bombelli's ''Algebra'', [[Leibniz]] praised Bombelli as an \". . . outstanding master of the analytical art.\"  Crossley {{cn|date=October 2016}} writes in his book, \"Thus we have an engineer, Bombelli, making practical use of complex numbers perhaps because they gave him useful results, while Cardan found the square roots of negative numbers useless.  Bombelli is the first to give a treatment of any complex numbers. . . It is remarkable how thorough he is in his presentation of the laws of calculation of complex numbers. . .\"[3]\n\nIn honor of his accomplishments, a moon crater was named  [[Bombelli (crater)|Bombelli]].\n\n==Bombelli's method of calculating square roots==\nBombelli used a method related to [[continued fractions]] to calculate [[square roots]].  His method for finding <math> \\sqrt{n} </math> begins with <math> n=(a\\pm r)^2=a^2\\pm 2ar+r^2\\ </math> with <math> 0<r<1\\ </math>, from which it can be shown that <math> r=\\frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\\pm r}</math>.  Repeated substitution of the expression on the right hand side for <math>r</math> into itself yields a continued fraction\n\n: <math>a\\pm \\frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\\pm \\frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\\pm \\frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\\pm \\cdots }}}</math>\n\nfor the root but Bombelli is more concerned with better approximations for <math>r</math>.  The value chosen for <math>a</math> is either of the whole numbers whose squares <math>n</math> lies between. The method gives the following [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergents]] for <math>\\sqrt{13}\\ </math> while the actual value is 3.605551275... :\n\n: <math> 3\\frac{2}{3},\\ 3\\frac{3}{5},\\ 3\\frac{20}{33},\\ 3\\frac{66}{109},\\ 3\\frac{109}{180},\\ 3\\frac{720}{1189},\\ \\cdots</math>\n\nThe last convergent equals 3.605550883... .  Bombelli's method should be compared with formulas and results used by [[Heron of Alexandria|Heros]] and [[Archimedes]]. The result <math>\\frac{265}{153}<\\sqrt{3}<\\frac{1351}{780}</math> used by Archimedes in his determination of the value of <math>\\pi \\ </math> can be found by using 1 and 0 for the initial values of <math>r</math>.\n\n==References==\n* [[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', 1972, Oxford University Press, New York, {{ISBN|0-19-501496-0}}\n* [[David Eugene Smith]], ''A Source Book in Mathematics'', 1959, Dover Publications, New York, {{ISBN|0-486-64690-4}}\n\n==References==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://mathematica.sns.it/opere/9/ L'Algebra, Libri I, II, III,] [http://a2.lib.uchicago.edu/pip.php?/pres/2005/pres2005-188.pdf IV e V]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, original Italian texts.\n*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Bombelli}}\n*[http://fermatslasttheorem.blogspot.com/2006/11/rafael-bombelli.html Background]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bombelli, Rafael}}\n[[Category:1526 births]]\n[[Category:1572 deaths]]\n[[Category:Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:16th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Algebraists]]\n[[Category:Italian engineers]]"

In 1762 he obtained a position of a reader in history and was promoted to professor in 1779. At Lund he wrote eight volumes of mathematical work in the fields of algebra, geometry, analysis and astronomy, including ''Meletemata quaedam mathematica circa transformationem aequationum algebraicarum'' (1786). This work describes Bring's contribution to the [[algebraic solution]] of equations.\n\nBring had developed an important transformation to simplify a [[quintic equation]] to the form <math>x^5 + px + q = 0</math> (see [[Bring radical]]). In 1832–35 the same transformation was independently derived by [[George Jerrard]]. However, whereas Jerrard knew from the past work by [[Paolo Ruffini]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]] that a general quintic equation can not be solved, this fact was not known to Bring, putting him in a disadvantage.<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bring.html Erland Samuel Bring]</ref>\n\n[[Bring's curve]] is named after him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bring, Erland}}\n[[Category:1736 births]]\n[[Category:1798 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Swedish mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Algebraists]]\n\n\n{{Sweden-mathematician-stub}}"

He went on to [[King's College London]] (at age 15) and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was elected fellow in 1868, after being second [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in 1867 and second Smith's prizeman.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}} <ref>{{acad|id=CLFT863WK|name=Clifford, William Kingdon}}</ref> Being second was a fate he shared with others who became famous mathematicians, including [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. In 1870, he was part of an expedition to Italy to observe the [[solar eclipse of December 22, 1870]]. During that voyage he survived a shipwreck along the Sicilian coast.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Chisholm | first = M. | title = Such Silver Currents | year = 2002 | publisher = The Lutterworth Press | location = Cambridge | page = 26 | isbn = 978-0-7188-3017-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1871, he was appointed professor of mathematics and mechanics at [[University College London]], and in 1874 became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}}  He was also a member of the [[London Mathematical Society]] and the [[Metaphysical Society]].\n\nOn 7 April 1875 Clifford married [[Lucy Clifford|Lucy Lane]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Stephen | first = Leslie | last2 = Pollock | first2 = Frederick | title = Lectures and Essays by the Late William Kingdon Clifford, F.R.S | place = New York | publisher = Macmillan and Company | year = 1901 | volume = 1 | edition = | page = 20 | url = http://www.openlibrary.org/details/lecturesessays01clifiala }}</ref> In 1876, Clifford suffered a breakdown, probably brought on by overwork. He taught and administered by day, and wrote by night. A half-year holiday in Algeria and Spain allowed him to resume his duties for 18 months, after which he collapsed again. He went to the island of Madeira to recover, but died there of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months, leaving a widow with two children.\n\nClifford enjoyed entertaining children and wrote a collection of fairy stories, ''The Little People''.<ref>{{cite book | pages=91&ndash;92 | title=In Mathematical Circles: A Selection of Mathematical Stories and Anecdotes | last=Eves | first=Howard W. | volume=3&ndash;4 | publisher=Prindle, Weber and Schmidt | year=1969 }}</ref>\n\nClifford and his wife are buried in London's [[Highgate Cemetery]] just north of the grave of [[Karl Marx]], and near the graves of [[George Eliot]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].\n\n== Mathematician ==\n\"Clifford was above all and before all a geometer.\" ([[Henry John Stephen Smith|H. J. S. Smith]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}} \nThe discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] opened new possibilities in geometry in Clifford's era. The field of intrinsic [[differential geometry]] was born, with the concept of [[curvature]] broadly applied to [[space]] itself as well as to curved lines and surfaces. Clifford was very much impressed by [[Bernhard Riemann]]’s 1854 essay \"On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry\".<ref>[[Bernhard Riemann]] (1854, 1867) [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/WKCGeom.html On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry], [[Habilitationsschrift]] and posthumous publication, translated by Clifford, link from School of Mathematics, [[Trinity College Dublin]]</ref> In 1870 he reported to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]] on the curved space concepts of Riemann, and included speculation on the bending of space by gravity. Clifford's translation<ref>W. K. Clifford (1873) \"On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry\", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 8:14 to 17, 36, 37; also Paper #9 in ''Mathematical Papers'' (1882), page 55, synopsis pp 70,1</ref> of Riemann's paper was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1873. His report at Cambridge, ''[[s:On the Space-Theory of Matter|On the Space-Theory of Matter]]'', was published in 1876, anticipating [[Albert Einstein]]’s [[general relativity]] by 40 years. Clifford elaborated [[elliptic geometry#Elliptic space|elliptic space geometry]] as a [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] [[metric space]]. Equidistant curves in elliptic space are now said to be [[Clifford parallel]]s.\n[[File:William Kingdon Clifford by John Collier.jpg|right|thumb|<center>Clifford by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]]</center>]]\n\nClifford's contemporaries considered him acute and original, witty and warm. He often worked late into the night, which may have hastened his death. He published papers on a range of topics including [[algebraic form]]s and [[projective geometry]] and the textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. His application of [[graph theory]] to [[invariant theory]] was followed up by [[William Spottiswoode]] and [[Alfred Kempe]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Norman L. Biggs|author2=Edward Keith Lloyd|author3=Robin James Wilson|title=Graph Theory: 1736-1936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqYTk0sXmpoC&pg=PA67|accessdate=30 July 2013|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853916-2|page=67}}</ref>\n\n===Algebras===\nIn 1878 Clifford published a seminal work, building on Grassmann's extensive algebra.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clifford|first=William|title=Applications of Grassmann's extensive algebra|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|year=1878|volume=1|issue=4|pages=350–358|jstor=2369379|doi=10.2307/2369379}}</ref> He had succeeded in unifying the [[quaternions]], developed by [[William Rowan Hamilton]], with Grassmann's outer product (also known as the [[exterior product]]). He understood the geometric nature of Grassmann's creation, and that the quaternions fit cleanly into the algebra Grassmann had developed. The [[versor]]s in quaternions facilitate representation of rotation. Clifford laid the foundation for a geometric product, composed of the sum of the [[inner product]] and Grassmann's outer product. The geometric product was eventually formalized by the Hungarian mathematician [[Marcel Riesz]]. The inner product equips geometric algebra with a metric, fully incorporating distance and angle relationships for lines, planes, and volumes, while the outer product gives those planes and volumes vector-like properties, including a directional bias.\n\nCombining the two brought the operation of division into play. This greatly expanded our qualitative understanding of how objects interact in space. Crucially, it also provided the means for quantitatively calculating the spatial consequences of those interactions. The resulting geometric algebra, as he called it, eventually realized the long sought goal<ref>Gottfried Leibniz, letter to Christian Huygens (8 September 1679) \"''I believe that, so far as geometry is concerned, we need still another analysis which is distinctly geometrical or linear and which will express situation directly as algebra expresses magnitude directly.''\", in Gottfried Leibniz (2nd edition 1976) ''Philosophical Papers and Letters'', Springer</ref> of creating an algebra that mirrors the movements and projections of objects in 3-dimensional space.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hestenes|first=David|title=On the Evolution of Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus|url=http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/Evolution.html}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Clifford's algebraic schema extends to higher dimensions. The algebraic operations have the same symbolic form as they do in 2 or 3-dimensions. The importance of general Clifford algebras has grown over time, while their [[isomorphism]] classes - as real algebras - have been identified in other mathematical systems beyond simply the quaternions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dechant|first=Pierre-Philippe|title=A Clifford algebraic framework for Coxeter group theoretic computations|journal=Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras|date=March 2014|volume=14|issue=1|pages=89–108|doi=10.1007/s00006-013-0422-4|bibcode=2012arXiv1207.5005D|arxiv=1207.5005}}</ref>\n\nThe realms of [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]] have been expanded through the algebra '''H''' of quaternions, thanks to its notion of a [[three-dimensional sphere]] embedded in a four-dimensional space. Quaternion [[versor]]s, which inhabit this 3-sphere, provide a representation of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. Clifford noted that Hamilton’s [[biquaternion]]s were a [[tensor product#Tensor product of algebras|tensor product]] <math>H \\otimes C</math> of known algebras, and proposed instead two other tensor products of '''H''': Clifford argued that the \"scalars\" taken from the [[complex number]]s '''C''' might instead be taken from [[split-complex number]]s '''D''' or from the [[dual number]]s '''N'''. In terms of tensor products, <math>H \\otimes D</math> produces [[split-biquaternion]]s, while <math>H \\otimes N</math> forms [[dual quaternion]]s. The algebra of dual quaternions is used to express [[screw theory#Homography|screw displacement]], a common mapping in kinematics.\n\n==Philosopher==\n\n[[File:Clifford William Kingdon desk.jpg|desk|right|thumb|William Kingdon Clifford]]\n\nAs a philosopher, Clifford's name is chiefly associated with two phrases of his coining, \"mind-stuff\" and the \"tribal self\". The former symbolizes his metaphysical conception, suggested to him by his reading of [[Spinoza]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}} [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] wrote about Clifford as follows:\n\n{{quote|Briefly put, the conception is that mind is the one ultimate reality; not mind as we know it in the complex forms of conscious feeling and thought, but the simpler elements out of which thought and feeling are built up. The hypothetical ultimate element of mind, or [[atom]] of mind-stuff, precisely corresponds to the hypothetical atom of matter, being the ultimate fact of which the material atom is the phenomenon. Matter and the sensible universe are the relations between particular organisms, that is, mind organized into [[consciousness]], and the rest of the world. This leads to results which would in a loose and popular sense be called [[materialism|materialist]]. But the theory must, as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory, be reckoned on the idealist side. To speak technically, it is an idealist [[monism]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}} }}\n\nClifford himself defined \"mind-stuff\" as follows (1878, \"On the Nature of Things-in-Themselves\", ''Mind'', Vol. 3, No. 9, pp.&nbsp;57–67):\n\n<blockquote>That element of which, as we have seen, even the simplest feeling is a complex, I shall call Mind-stuff. A moving molecule of inorganic matter does not possess mind or consciousness ; but it possesses a small piece of mind-stuff. When molecules are so combined together as to form the film on the under side of a jelly-fish, the elements of mind-stuff which go along with them are so combined as to form the faint beginnings of Sentience. When the molecules are so combined as to form the brain and nervous system of a vertebrate, the corresponding elements of mind-stuff are so combined as to form some kind of consciousness; that is to say, changes in the complex which take place at the same time get so linked together that the repetition of one implies the repetition of the other. When matter takes the complex form of a living human brain, the corresponding mind-stuff takes the form of a human consciousness, having intelligence and volition.</blockquote>\n\nThe other phrase, \"tribal self\", gives the key to Clifford's ethical view, which explains conscience and the moral law by the development in each individual of a \"self\", which prescribes the conduct conducive to the welfare of the \"tribe.\" Much of Clifford's contemporary prominence was due to his attitude toward [[religion]]. Animated by an intense love of his conception of truth and devotion to public duty, he waged war on such ecclesiastical systems as seemed to him to favour [[obscurantism]], and to put the claims of sect above those of human society. The alarm was greater, as [[theology]] was still unreconciled with [[Darwinism]]; and Clifford was regarded as a dangerous champion of the antispiritual tendencies then imputed to modern science.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}}  There has also been debate on the extent to which Clifford’s doctrine of \"concomitance\" or \"psychophysical parallelism\" influenced [[John Hughlings Jackson]]'s model of the nervous system and through him the work of Janet, Freud, Ribot, and Ey.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G E | year = 2000 | title = Body and Mind: C K Clifford | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 43| pages = 311–338 | doi=10.1177/0957154x0001104305 | pmid = 11640231 }}</ref>\n\n==Ethics==\n\nIn his essay, “The Ethics of Belief” published in 1877, Clifford argued that it was immoral to believe things for which one lacks evidence. He describes a ship-owner who planned to send to sea an old and not well built ship full of passengers. The ship-owner had doubts suggested to him that the ship might not be seaworthy. “These doubts preyed upon his mind, and made him unhappy.” He considered having the ship refitted even though it would be expensive. At last, “He succeeded in overcoming these melancholy reflections.” He watched the ship depart, “with a light heart… and he got his insurance money when she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.” <ref>Clifford, William, Kingdon, essay “The Ethics of Belief.” published in 1877.</ref>\n\nClifford argued that the ship-owner was guilty of the deaths of the passengers even though he sincerely believed the ship was sound. ''“[H]e had no right to believe on such evidence as was before him.”'' (The italics are in the original.) Clifford famously concludes, “it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.\" <ref>Clifford, William, Kingdon, essay “The Ethics of Belief.” published in 1877.</ref> \n\nAs such, he was arguing in direct opposition to religious thinkers for whom \"blind faith\" (i.e. belief in things in spite of the lack of evidence for them) was a virtue. This paper was famously attacked by [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[William James]] in his \"[[Will to Believe Doctrine|Will to Believe]]\" lecture. Often these two works are read and published together as [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstones]] for the debate over [[evidentialism]], [[faith]], and [[overbelief]].\n\n==Premonition of relativity==\nThough Clifford never constructed a full theory of [[spacetime]] and [[Special relativity|relativity]], there are some remarkable observations he made in print that foreshadowed these modern concepts:\nIn his book [[Elements of Dynamic]] (1878), he introduced \"quasi-harmonic motion in a hyperbola\". He wrote an expression for a [[unit hyperbola#Parametrization|parametrized unit hyperbola]], which other authors later used as a model for relativistic velocity. Elsewhere he states,\n:The geometry of rotors and motors ... forms the basis of the whole modern theory of the relative rest (Static) and the relative motion (Kinematic and Kinetic) of invariable systems.<ref>''Common Sense of the Exact Sciences'' (1885), page 214 (page 193 of the Dover reprint), immediately followed by a section on \"The bending of space\". However, according to the preface (p.vii) this section was written by [[Karl Pearson]]</ref>\nThis passage makes reference to [[biquaternion]]s, though Clifford made these into [[split-biquaternion]]s as his independent development.\nThe book continues with a chapter \"On the bending of space\", the substance of [[general relativity]]. Clifford also discussed his views in ''[[s:On the Space-Theory of Matter|On the Space-Theory of Matter]]'' in 1876.\n\nIn 1910 William Barrett Frankland quoted the ''Space-Theory of Matter'' in his book on parallelism.<ref>William Barrett Frankland (1910) ''Theories of Parallelism'', pp 48,9, [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref> He wrote:\n:The boldness of this speculation is surely unexcelled in the history of thought. Up to the present, however, it presents the appearance of an Icarian flight.\n\nYears later, after [[general relativity]] had been advanced by [[Albert Einstein]], various authors noted that Clifford had anticipated Einstein:\n\nIn 1923 [[Hermann Weyl]] mentioned Clifford<ref>''Raum Zeit Materie'', page 101, [[Springer-Verlag]], Berlin</ref> as one of those who, like [[Bernhard Riemann]], anticipated the geometric ideas of relativity.\n\nIn 1940 [[Eric Temple Bell]] published his ''The Development of Mathematics''. There on pages 359 and 360 he discusses the prescience of Clifford on relativity:\n:Bolder even than Riemann, Clifford confessed his belief (1870) that matter is only a manifestation of curvature in a space-time manifold. This embryonic divination has been acclaimed as an anticipation of Einstein’s (1915–16) relativistic theory of the gravitational field. The actual theory, however, bears but slight resemblance to Clifford’s rather detailed creed. As a rule, those mathematical prophets who never descend to particulars make the top scores. Almost anyone can hit the side of a barn at forty yards with a charge of buckshot.\n\nAlso in 1960, at [[Stanford University]] for the ''International Congress for Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science'', [[John Archibald Wheeler]] introduced his [[geometrodynamics]] formulation of general relativity by crediting Clifford as the initiator.<ref>J. Wheeler (1960) \"Curved empty space as the building material of the physical world: an assessment\", in Ernest Nagel (1962) ''Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science'', Stanford University Press</ref>\n\nIn his ''The Natural Philosophy of Time'' (1961, 1980) [[Gerald James Whitrow]] recalls Clifford's prescience by quoting him to describe the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] in cosmology (1st ed pp 246,7; 2nd ed p 291).\n\nIn 1970 [[Cornelius Lanczos]] summarizes Clifford's premonitions this way:\n:[He] with great ingenuity foresaw in a qualitative fashion that physical matter might be conceived as a curved ripple on a generally flat plane. Many of his ingenious hunches were later realized in Einstein's gravitational theory. Such speculations were automatically premature and could not lead to anything constructive without an intermediate link which demanded the extension of 3-dimensional geometry to the inclusion of time. The theory of curved spaces had to be preceded by the realization that space and time form a single four-dimensional entity.<ref>[[Cornelius Lanczos]] (1970) ''Space through the Ages: The evolution of geometrical ideas from Pythagoras to Hilbert and Einstein'', page 222, [[Academic Press]]</ref>\n\nIn 1973 [[Banesh Hoffmann]] wrote:\n:Riemann, and more specifically Clifford, conjectured that forces and matter might be local irregularities in the curvature of space, and in this they were strikingly prophetic, though for their pains they were dismissed at the time as visionaries.<ref>[[Banesh Hoffmann]] (1973) \"Relativity\" in ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' 4:80, [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]</ref>\n\nIn 1990 [[Ruth Farwell]] and Christopher Knee examined the record on acknowledgement of Clifford's foresight. They conclude \"it was Clifford, not Riemann, who anticipated some of the conceptual ideas of General Relativity\". To explain the lack of recognition of Clifford's prescience, they point out that he was an expert in metric geometry, and \"metric geometry was too challenging to orthodox epistemology to be pursued.\" <ref>Farwell & Knee (1990)''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' 21:91–121</ref>\nIn 1992 Farwell and Knee continued their study with \"The Geometric Challenge of Riemann and Clifford\"<ref>Farwell & Knee (1992) in ''1830–1930: A Century of Geometry'', pages 98 to 106, Lecture Notes in Physics #402, Springer-Verlag {{isbn|3-540-55408-4}}</ref>\nThey \"hold that once tensors had been used in the theory of general relativity, the framework existed in which a geometrical perspective in physics could be developed and allowed the challenging geometrical conceptions of Riemann and Clifford to be rediscovered.\"\n\n== Selected writings ==\n* 1872: ''On the aims and instruments of scientific thought'', 524-41.\n* 1876: ''[[s:On the Space-Theory of Matter|On the Space-Theory of Matter]]''.\n* 1877: [http://www.uta.edu/philosophy/faculty/burgess-jackson/Clifford.pdf \"The Ethics of Belief\"], ''Contemporary Review''.\n* 1878:  [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04370002 Elements of Dynamic, books I, II, III] (1878) London: MacMillan & Co; on-line presentation by [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Mathematical Monographs''.\n* 1878: \"Applications of Grassmann's Extensive Algebra\", [[American Journal of Mathematics]] 1(4): 353 {{doi|10.2307/2369379}}\n* 1879: [https://archive.org/details/seeingandthinki00goog ''Seeing and Thinking''], popular science lectures.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=506}} \n* 1879: [http://www.openlibrary.org/details/lecturesessaysby02clifrich ''Lectures and Essays''], with an introduction by [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]].\n* 1881: [http://www.babordnum.fr/items/show/182 Mathematical fragments, being facsimiles of his unfinished papers relating to the Theory of Graphs], [[Macmillan Publishers]] via [[University of Bordeaux]] \n* 1882: (edited by [[Robert Tucker (mathematician)|Robert Tucker]], with an introduction by [[Henry John Stephen Smith|Henry J.

After her death in October 1925, the family moved to a rented flat in a new building in Lattenkamp, in the [[Winterhude]] quarter. He attended a kindergarten then, in April 1930, moved to Alsterdorfer Straße School. After a while, he had a new teacher, a National Socialist, who picked on him and punished him without cause. Thus in 1931, he moved to the Meerweinstraße School where his mother taught.<ref name=\"Autobiography\"/>\n\nFollowing the rise of the [[Nazi]]s in 1933, his father's business was confiscated and his mother dismissed. He moved to the Talmud-Tora-Schule, a Jewish school. In mid-1937, the family moved to Klosterallee. This was nearer the school, the synagogue and other pupils, being in the Jewish area. His German teacher was Dr. Ernst Loewenberg, the son of the poet [[Jakob Loewenberg]].<ref name=\"Autobiography\"/>\n\nOn the night of 9/10 November 1938 ([[Kristallnacht]]), his father was arrested and sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. He was released after four months but told to emigrate. Cohn went to Britain in May 1939 on the [[Kindertransport]] to work on a chicken farm, and never saw his parents again. He corresponded regularly with them until late 1941. At the end of [[World War II|the War]], he learned that they were deported to [[Riga]] on 6 December 1941 and never returned. At the end of 1941, the farm closed. He trained as a precision engineer, acquired a work permit and worked in a factory for 4½ years. He passed the Cambridge Scholarship Examination, and won an exhibition to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"Independent\"/><ref name=\"Autobiography\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nHe received a B.A in Mathematics from [[Cambridge University]] in 1948 and a Ph.D. (supervised by [[Philip Hall]]) in 1951. He then spent a year as a Chargé de Recherches at the [[University of Nancy]]. On his return, he became a lecturer in mathematics at [[Manchester University]]. He was a visiting professor at [[Yale University]] in 1961–62, and for part of 1962 was at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. On his return, he became Reader at [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]].

He continued to be a visiting professor, for example to the [[University of Alberta]] in 1986 and to [[Bar Ilan University]] in 1987. He retired in 1989, but remained active as [[Professor Emeritus]] and Honorary Research Fellow until his death.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/><ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\nHe was President of the London Mathematical Society, 1982-4, having been its secretary, 1965–67 and a Council member in 1968–71, 1972–75 and 1979–82. He was editor of the Society's Monographs in 1968–77 and 1980–93. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1980 and was on its council, 1985–87. He was a member of the Mathematical Committee of the [[Science Research Council]], 1977–1980.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/> He chaired the National Committee for Mathematics, 1988-9.<ref name=debretts/>\n\n== Mathematical work ==\nIn all, Cohn wrote nearly 200 mathematical papers.<ref name=\"Times\"/> He worked in many areas of algebra, mainly in non-commutative ring theory. His first papers, covering many topics, were published in 1952. He generalised a theorem due to [[Wilhelm Magnus]], and worked on the structure of [[tensor]] spaces. In 1953 he published a joint paper with [[Kurt Mahler]] on pseudo-valuations and in 1954 he published a work on [[Lie algebras]].<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/>\n\nPapers over the next few years covered areas such as [[group theory]], [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[Lie ring]]s, [[semigroup]]s, [[Abelian group]]s and [[ring theory]]. He published his first book, ''[[Lie group]]s'', in 1957. After that, he moved into the areas of [[Jordan algebra]]s, [[Lie division ring]]s, [[skew field]]s, [[free ideal ring]]s and non-commutative [[unique factorisation domain]]s. He published his second book, ''[[Linear equation]]s'', in 1958 and his third, ''[[Solid geometry]]'', in 1961. ''Universal algebra'' appeared in 1965 (second edition 1981). After that, he concentrated on non-commutative ring theory and the theory of algebras.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/>\n\nHis monograph ''Free rings and their relations'' appeared in 1971. It covered the work of Cohn and others on [[free associative algebra]]s and related classes of rings, especially free ideal rings. He included all of his own published results on the embedding of rings into skew fields. The second, enlarged edition appeared in 1985.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/>\n\nCohn also wrote undergraduate textbooks. ''Algebra'' volume I appeared in 1974 and volume II in 1977. The second edition, in three volumes, was published by Wiley between 1982 and 1991.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/> These volumes were in line with the British (rather than American) curricula at the time and include both linear algebra and abstract algebra. Cohn wrote a subsequent revised iteration the first volume as ''Classical Algebra'' (Wiley, 2000) as a more \"user friendly\" version for undergraduates (according to its preface); this book also includes a few selected topics from volumes II and III of ''Algebra''. The final incarnation of Cohn's algebra textbooks appeared in 2003 as two Springer volumes ''Basic Algebra'' and ''Further Algebra and Applications''; the material in ''Basic Algebra'' is (according to its preface) rather more concise and while corresponding roughly with volume I of ''Algebra'' assumes knowledge of linear algebra; the material on basic theories (groups, rings, fields) is pursued in more depth in ''Basic Algebra'' compared to volume I of ''Algebra''. ''Further Algebra and Applications'' roughly corresponds to volumes II and III of ''Algebra'', but reflects the shift of some material from these volumes to ''Basic Algebra''.\n\n== Private life ==\nHis recreation was etymology and language in all its forms.

Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on [[Waring's problem|writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers]], Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]], where he became an avid [[backgammon]] player, spending hours playing the game in the common room.

At times Conway has said he hates the Game of Life–largely because it has come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he has done.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA Does John Conway hate his Game of Life?] (video)</ref> Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of [[cellular automata]].<ref>MacTutor History: The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata.</ref>\n\nThe Game of Life is now known to be [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]].<ref>Rendell (2015)</ref><ref name=case>Case (2014)</ref>\n\n==Conway and Martin Gardner==\nConway's career is intertwined with mathematics popularizer and ''[[Scientific American]]'' columnist [[Martin Gardner]]. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref>[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-top-10-martin-gardner-scientific-american-articles/ The Top 10 Martin Gardner Scientific American Articles]</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H.

''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novel by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], son of [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042704002195 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329–353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.}}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics–[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the '[[Hidden variable theory|no hidden variables]]' principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem]'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">\n[https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners London Mathematical Society Prizewinners]</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[Pólya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Dedekind had three older siblings. As an adult, he never used the names Julius Wilhelm. He was born, lived most of his life, and died in Braunschweig (often called \"Brunswick\" in English).\n\nHe first attended the Collegium Carolinum in 1848 before transferring to the [[University of Göttingen]] in  1850. There, Dedekind was taught [[number theory]] by professor [[Moritz Stern]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] was still teaching, although mostly at an elementary level, and Dedekind became his last student. Dedekind received his doctorate in 1852, for a thesis titled ''Über die Theorie der Eulerschen Integrale'' (\"On the Theory of [[Euler integral|Eulerian integrals]]\"). This thesis did not display the talent evident by Dedekind's subsequent publications.\n\nAt that time, the [[University of Berlin]], not [[Göttingen]], was the main facility for mathematical research in Germany. Thus Dedekind went to Berlin for two years of study, where he and [[Bernhard Riemann]] were contemporaries; they were both awarded the [[habilitation]] in 1854. Dedekind returned to Göttingen to teach as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'', giving courses on [[probability]] and [[geometry]]. He studied for a while with [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], and they became good friends. Because of lingering weaknesses in his mathematical knowledge, he studied [[elliptic function|elliptic]] and [[abelian variety|abelian function]]s. Yet he was also the first at Göttingen to lecture concerning [[Galois theory]]. About this time, he became one of the first people to understand the importance of the notion of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] for [[algebra]] and [[arithmetic]].\n\nIn 1858, he began teaching at the [[ETH Zürich|Polytechnic]] school in  [[Zürich]] (now ETH Zürich). When the Collegium Carolinum was upgraded to a ''[[Technische Hochschule]]'' (Institute of Technology) in 1862, Dedekind returned to his native Braunschweig, where he spent the rest of his life, teaching at the Institute. He retired in 1894, but did occasional teaching and continued to publish. He never married, instead living with his sister Julia.\n\nDedekind was elected to the Academies of Berlin (1880) and Rome, and to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (1900). He received [[honorary doctorate]]s from the universities of [[University of Oslo|Oslo]], [[University of Zurich|Zurich]], and [[Technical University at Brunswick|Braunschweig]].\n\n==Work==\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Dedekind, Julius Wilhelm Richard (1831-1916)-Portrait-Portr 11953.tif (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Dedekind, before 1886]]\nWhile teaching calculus for the first time at the [[ETH Zürich|Polytechnic]] school, Dedekind developed the notion now known as a [[Dedekind cut]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Schnitt''), now a standard definition of the real numbers. The idea of a cut is that an [[irrational number]] divides the [[rational number]]s into two classes ([[Set (mathematics)|sets]]), with all the numbers of one class (greater) being strictly greater than all the numbers of the other (lesser) class. For example, the [[square root of 2]] defines all the nonnegative numbers whose squares are less than 2 and the negative numbers into the lesser class, and the positive numbers whose squares are greater than 2 into the greater class. Every location on the number line continuum contains either a rational or an irrational number. Thus there are no empty locations, gaps, or discontinuities. Dedekind published his thoughts on irrational numbers and Dedekind cuts in his pamphlet \"Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen\" (\"Continuity and irrational numbers\");<ref>Ewald, William B., ed. (1996) \"Continuity and irrational numbers\", p. 766 in ''From Kant to Hilbert: A Source Book in the Foundations of Mathematics'', 2 vols. Oxford University Press. [http://www.math.ru.nl/werkgroepen/gmfw/bronnen/dedekind2.html full text]</ref> in modern terminology, ''Vollständigkeit'', ''[[complete space|completeness]]''.\n\nDedekind's theorem<ref>{{cite book|work=Essays on the Theory of Numbers|publisher=Dover|publication-date=1963|year=1901, Open Court|title=The Nature and Meaning of Numbers|at=Part V, Paragraph 64, October 2011}}</ref> states that if there existed a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between two sets, then the two sets were \"similar\". He invoked similarity to give the first precise definition of an [[Dedekind-infinite set|infinite set]]: a set is infinite when it is \"similar to a proper part of itself,\" in modern terminology, is [[equinumerous]] to one of its [[subset|proper subsets]]. Thus the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s can be shown to be similar to the subset of '''N''' whose members are the [[square (algebra)|square]]s of every member of '''N''', ('''N'''<span  style=\"font-size:140%; color:darkgreen;\"> → </span> '''N'''<sup>2</sup>):\n\n '''N''' &nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8&nbsp; 9  10 ...\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span  style=\"font-size:140%; color:darkgreen;\"> ↓ </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n '''N'''<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; 1&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 9  16 25 36 49 64 81 100 ...\n\nDedekind edited the collected works of [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], and [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Dedekind's study of Lejeune Dirichlet's work led him to his later study of [[algebraic number field]]s and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s. In 1863, he published Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on [[number theory]] as ''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' (\"Lectures on Number Theory\") about which it has been written that:\n\n{{quote|Although the book is assuredly based on Dirichlet's lectures, and although Dedekind himself referred to the book throughout his life as Dirichlet's, the book itself was entirely written by Dedekind, for the most part after Dirichlet's death.|Edwards, 1983}}\n\nThe 1879 and 1894 editions of the ''Vorlesungen'' included supplements introducing the notion of an ideal, fundamental to [[ring (algebra)|ring theory]]. (The word \"Ring\", introduced later by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], does not appear in Dedekind's work.) Dedekind defined an [[ring ideal|ideal]] as a subset of a set of numbers, composed of [[algebraic integer]]s that satisfy polynomial equations with [[integer]] coefficients. The concept underwent further development in the hands of Hilbert and, especially, of [[Emmy Noether]]. Ideals generalize [[Ernst Eduard Kummer]]'s [[ideal number]]s, devised as part of Kummer's 1843 attempt to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. (Thus Dedekind can be said to have been Kummer's most important disciple.) In an 1882 article, Dedekind and [[Heinrich Martin Weber]] applied ideals to [[Riemann surface]]s, giving an algebraic proof of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].\n\nIn 1888, he published a short monograph titled ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'' (\"What are numbers and what are they good for?\" Ewald 1996: 790),<ref>{{cite book | author=Richard Dedekind | title=Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? | location=Braunschweig | publisher=Vieweg | year=1888 }} Online available at: [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?pn=1&url=%2Fmpiwg%2Fonline%2Fpermanent%2Feinstein_exhibition%2Fsources%2F8GPV80UY%2Fpageimg&viewMode=images&tocMode=thumbs&tocPN=1&searchPN=1&mode=imagepath&characterNormalization=reg&queryPageSize=10 MPIWG] [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN23569441X&DMDID=dmdlog55 GDZ] [http://www.digibib.tu-bs.de/?docid=00063941 UBS]</ref> which included his definition of an [[infinite set]]. He also proposed an [[axiom]]atic foundation for the natural numbers, whose primitive notions were the number [[1 (number)|one]] and the [[successor function]]. The next year, [[Giuseppe Peano]], citing Dedekind, formulated an equivalent but simpler [[Peano axioms|set of axioms]], now the standard ones.\n\nDedekind made other contributions to [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. For instance, around 1900, he wrote the first papers on [[modular lattice]]s. In 1872, while on holiday in [[Interlaken]], Dedekind met [[Georg Cantor]]. Thus began an enduring relationship of mutual respect, and Dedekind became one of the very first mathematicians to admire Cantor's work concerning infinite sets, proving a valued ally in Cantor's disputes with [[Leopold Kronecker]], who was philosophically opposed to Cantor's [[transfinite numbers]].<ref>{{citation|title=The Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the Kabbalah, and the Search for Infinity|series=Pocket Books nonfiction|first=Amir D.|last=Aczel|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2001|isbn=9780743422994|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQinWBLQG3UC&pg=PA102}}.</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\nPrimary literature in English:\n*1890. \"Letter to Keferstein\" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967.

He was one of the first American researchers in [[abstract algebra]], in particular the theory of finite [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[classical group]]s, and is also remembered for a three-volume history of [[number theory]], ''[[History of the Theory of Numbers]]''.\n\n==Life==\nDickson considered himself a Texan by virtue of having grown up in [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], where his father was a banker, merchant, and real estate investor. He attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where [[George Bruce Halsted]] encouraged his study of mathematics. Dickson earned a B.S. in 1893 and an M.S. in 1894, under Halsted's supervision. Dickson first specialised in Halsted's own specialty, [[geometry]].<ref name=AAA>[[A. A. Albert]] (1955) [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/dickson-leonard.pdf Leonard Eugene Dickson 1874–1954] from [[National Academy of Sciences]]</ref>\n\nBoth the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Harvard University]] welcomed Dickson as a Ph.D. student, and Dickson initially accepted Harvard's offer, but chose to attend Chicago instead. In 1896, when he was only 22 years of age, he was awarded Chicago's first doctorate in mathematics, for a dissertation titled ''The Analytic Representation of Substitutions on a Power of a Prime Number of Letters with a Discussion of the Linear Group'', supervised by [[E. H. Moore]].\n\nDickson then went to [[Leipzig]] and [[Paris]] to study under [[Sophus Lie]] and [[Camille Jordan]], respectively. On returning to the USA, he became an instructor at the [[University of California]]. In 1899 and at the extraordinarily young age of 25, Dickson was appointed associate professor at the University of Texas. Chicago countered by offering him a position in 1900, and he spent the balance of his career there. At Chicago, he supervised 53 Ph.D. theses; his most accomplished student was probably [[A. A. Albert]]. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of California]] in 1914, 1918, and 1922. In 1939, he returned to Texas to retire.\n\nDickson married Susan McLeod Davis in 1902; they had two children, Campbell and Eleanor.\n\nDickson was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1913, and was also a member of the American Philosophical Society, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[London Mathematical Society]], the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists. Dickson was the first recipient of a prize created in 1924 by The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for his work on the arithmetics of algebras. Harvard (1936) and Princeton (1941) awarded him honorary doctorates.\n\nDickson presided over the  [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1917–1918. His December 1918 presidential address, titled \"Mathematics in War Perspective,\" criticized American mathematics for falling short of those of Britain, France, and Germany:\n\n:\"Let it not again become possible that thousands of young men shall be so seriously handicapped in their Army and Navy work by lack of adequate preparation in mathematics.\"\n\nIn 1928, he was also the first recipient of the [[Cole Prize]] for algebra, awarded annually by the AMS, for his book ''Algebren und ihre Zahlentheorie''.\n\nIt appears that Dickson was a hard man:\n\n:\"A hard-bitten character, Dickson tended to speak his mind bluntly; he was always sparing in his praise for the work of others. ... he indulged his serious passions for bridge and billiards and reportedly did not like to lose at either game.\"<ref>Karen Parshall (1999) \"Leonard Eugene Dickson\" in ''American National Biography'', volume 6, [[Oxford University Press]], pp 578–79</ref>\n\n:\"He delivered terse and unpolished lectures and spoke sternly to his students. ... Given Dickson's intolerance for student weaknesses in mathematics, however, his comments could be harsh, even though not intended to be personal. He did not aim to make students feel good about themselves.\"<ref name=DDF>{{cite journal | last1 = Fenster | first1 = D.

If not the student had to look elsewhere for an advisor.\"<ref name=DDF/>\n\n==Work==\nDickson had a major impact on American mathematics, especially [[abstract algebra]]. His mathematical output consists of 18 books and more than 250 papers. The ''Collected Mathematical Papers of Leonard Eugene Dickson'' fill six large volumes.\n\n==The algebraist==\nIn 1901, Dickson published his first book ''Linear groups with an exposition of the Galois field theory'', a revision and expansion of his Ph.D. thesis. Teubner in Leipzig published the book, as there was no well-established American scientific publisher at the time. Dickson had already published 43 research papers in the preceding five years; all but seven on [[finite linear group]]s. Parshall (1991) described the book as follows:\n\n:\"Dickson presented a unified, complete, and general theory of the [[classical linear group]]s—not merely over the [[prime field]] GF(''p'') as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]] had done—but over the general [[finite field]] GF(''p<sup>n</sup>''), and he did this against the backdrop of a well-developed theory of these underlying [[field (algebra)|field]]s. ... his book represented the first systematic treatment of [[finite field]]s in the mathematical literature.\"\n\nAn appendix in this book lists the non-abelian simple groups then known having order less than 1 billion. He listed 53 of the 56 having order less than 1 million. The remaining three were found in 1960, 1965, and 1967.\n\nDickson worked on [[finite field]]s and extended the theory of [[linear associative algebra]]s initiated by [[Joseph Wedderburn]] and [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]].\n\nHe started the study of [[modular invariants of a group]].\n\nIn 1905, Wedderburn, then at Chicago on a Carnegie Fellowship, published a paper that included three claimed proofs of a theorem stating that all finite [[division algebra]]s were [[commutative]], now known as [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]]. The proofs all made clever use of the interplay between the [[Ring (mathematics)|additive group]] of a finite [[division algebra]] ''A'', and the [[multiplicative group]] ''A''*&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;−&nbsp;{0}. [[Karen Parshall]] noted that the first of these three proofs had a gap not noticed at the time. Dickson also found a proof of this result but, believing Wedderburn's first proof to be correct, Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. But Dickson also noted that Wedderburn constructed his second and third proofs only after having seen Dickson's proof. She concluded that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Parshall | first1 = Karen | authorlink = Karen Parshall | year = 1983 | title = In pursuit of the finite division algebra theorem and beyond: Joseph H M Wedderburn, Leonard Dickson, and Oswald Veblen | url = | journal = Archives of International History of Science | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 274–99 }}</ref>\n\nDickson's search for a counterexample to Wedderburn's theorem led him to investigate [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebras]], and in a series of papers he found all possible three and four-dimensional (nonassociative) [[division algebra]]s over a [[field (algebra)|field]].\n\nIn 1919 Dickson constructed [[Cayley numbers]] by a doubling process starting with [[quaternion]]s ℍ.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Dickson | first1=L.

He proved the [[Waring's problem]] for <math>k\\ge 7</math> under the further condition of\n:<math>(3^k + 1)/(2^k - 1)\\le [1.5^k] + 1</math>\n\nindependently of [[Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai]] who proved it for <math>k\\ge 6</math> ahead of him.<ref>{{cite book|title=Number Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkBSfFjT1BgC&pg=PA95|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=2003|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-454-2|pages=95–}}</ref>\n\nThe three-volume ''[[History of the Theory of Numbers]]'' (1919–23) is still much consulted today, covering divisibility and primality, [[Diophantine analysis]], and [[quadratic form|quadratic]] and higher forms.

Her mathematics teacher at the lycée was a sister of mathematician [[Élie Cartan]], and after passing the baccalaureate she was allowed (through the intervention of a friend's father, the head of the institution) to continue studying mathematics at the [[Collège de Chaptal]]. On her second attempt, she placed second in the entrance examination for the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1926 (tied with [[Claude Chevalley]]), but by a ministerial decree was moved down to 21st position. After the intervention of Fernand Hauser, the editor of the Journal of the ENS, she was admitted to the school. Her teachers there included [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Jacques Hadamard]], and she finished her studies in 1929.<ref name=\"yks\">{{citation|title=Women mathematicians in France in the mid-twentieth century|first=Yvette|last=Kosmann-Schwarzbach|authorlink=Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach|doi=10.1080/17498430.2014.976804|journal=BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics|year=2015|arxiv=1502.07597}}.</ref><ref name=\"mactutor\">{{MacTutor|id=Dubreil-Jacotin}}</ref><ref name=\"mactutor\"/><ref name=\"aae\">[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Dubreil-Jacotin.html Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin], Extract from the ''Annuaire des Anciens Élèves de l'École Normale Supérieure'' (1974) by [[Jean Leray]], translation by Jean O'Connor, November 2002.</ref>\n\nWith the encouragement of ENS director [[Ernest Vessiot]] she traveled to [[Oslo]] to work with [[Vilhelm Bjerknes]], under whose influence she became interested in the mathematics of waves and the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] in this subject. She returned to Paris in 1930, married another mathematician, [[Paul Dubreil]], and joined him on another tour of the mathematics centers of Germany and Italy, including a visit with Levi-Civita.

In 1943 she became a full professor at the [[University of Poitiers]], the first woman to become a full professor of mathematics in France, and in 1955 she was given a chair there in differential and integral calculus.

He avoided military service in [[World War II]] because of his poor eyesight, and received his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in 1945 and his [[Ph.D.]] in 1948. He became an assistant professor at Moscow, but was not awarded a \"chair\" until 1954 because of his political undesirability.

A. Dmitriev, solved a problem on the [[eigenvalue]]s of [[Stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]]. This problem was raised at Kolmogorov's seminar on [[Markov chain]]s, while both Dynkin and Dmitriev were undergraduates.<ref name=p385/>\n\n===Lie Theory===\nWhile Dynkin was a student at Moscow University, he attended [[Israel Gelfand]]'s seminar on [[Lie group]]s. In 1944, Gelfand asked him to prepare a survey on the structure and classification of [[Semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple Lie groups]], based on the papers by [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]]. Dynkin found the papers difficult to read, and in an attempt to better understand the results, he invented the notion of a [[Root system#Positive roots and simple roots|\"simple root\"]] in a [[root system]]. He represented the pairwise angles between these simple roots in the form of a [[Dynkin diagram]]. In this way he obtained a cleaner exposition of the classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dynkin|2000|p=xiii,7}}</ref> Of Dynkin's 1947 paper \"Structure of semisimple Lie algebras\", [[Bertram Kostant]] wrote: {{quote|In this paper, using only elementary mathematics, and starting with almost nothing, Dynkin, brilliantly and elegantly developed the structure and machinery of semisimple Lie algebras. What he accomplished in this paper was to take a hitherto esoteric subject, and to make it into beautiful and powerful mathematics.|[[Bertram Kostant]]|\"Selected papers\", p. 363}}\n\nDynkin's 1952 influential paper \"Semisimple subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras\", contained large tables and lists, and studied the subalgebras of the [[Simple Lie group|exceptional Lie algebras]].\n\n===Probability theory===\nDynkin is considered one of the founders of the modern theory of [[Markov process]]es. The results obtained by Dynkin and other participants of his seminar at Moscow University were summarized in two books. The first of these, \"Theory of Markov Processes\", was published in 1959, and laid the foundations of the theory.\n\nDynkin's one-hour talk at the 1962 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Stockholm]], was delivered by Kolmogorov, since prior to his emigration, Dynkin was never permitted to travel to [[Western world|the West]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Dynkin|2000|p=388}}</ref>  This talk was titled \"Markov processes and problems in analysis\".\n\n==Prizes and awards==\n*Prize of the Moscow Mathematical Society, 1951\n*Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Fellow, 1962\n*American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow, 1978\n*National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Member, 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nas.nasonline.org/site/Dir/38308266?pg=vprof&mbr=1002587&returl=http%3A%2F%2Fnas.nasonline.org%2Fsite%2FDir%2F38308266%3Fpg%3Dsrch%26view%3Dbasic&retmk=search_again_link|title=Eugene Dynkin|publisher=NAS}}</ref>\n*American Mathematical Society, [[Leroy P.
