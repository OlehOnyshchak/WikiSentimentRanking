      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a simple subcubic graph is a finite simple [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which each vertex has degree at most three.  Suppose we have a sequence of simple subcubic graphs ''G''<sub>1</sub>, ''G''<sub>2</sub>, ... such that each graph ''G''<sub>''i''</sub> has at most ''i'' + ''k'' vertices (for some integer ''k'') and for no ''i'' < ''j'' is ''G''<sub>''i''</sub> [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|homeomorphically embeddable]] into (i.e. is a [[graph minor]] of) ''G''<sub>''j''</sub>.\n\nThe [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]] proves that subcubic graphs (simple or not) are well-founded by homeomorphic embeddability, implying such a sequence cannot be infinite. So, for each value of ''k'', there is a sequence with maximal length.

      "title": "Galois connection",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_connection",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''Galois connection''' is a particular correspondence (typically) between two [[partially ordered set]]s (posets). The same notion can also be defined on [[preordered set]]s or [[preordered class|classes]]; this article presents the common case of posets. Galois connections generalize the correspondence between [[subgroup]]s and [[field (mathematics)|subfields]] investigated in [[Galois theory]] (named after the French mathematician [[Évariste Galois]]). They find applications in various mathematical theories.\n\nA Galois connection is rather weak compared to an [[order isomorphism]] between the involved posets, but every Galois connection gives rise to an isomorphism of certain sub-posets, as will be explained below.\n\nThe literature contains two closely related notions of \"Galois connection\". In this article, we will distinguish between the two by referring to the first as '''(monotone) Galois connection''' and to the second as '''antitone Galois connection'''.\n\nThe term '''Galois correspondence''' is sometimes used to mean [[bijective]] ''Galois connection''; this is simply an [[order isomorphism]] (or dual order isomorphism, depending on whether we take monotone or antitone Galois connections).\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n=== (Monotone) Galois connection ===\nLet {{math|(''A'', ≤)}} and {{math|(''B'', ≤)}} be two [[partially ordered set]]s. A ''monotone Galois connection'' between these posets consists of two [[monotone function|monotone]]<ref>Monotonicity follows from the following condition. See the discussion of the [[#Properties|properties]]. It is only explicit in the definition to distinguish it from the alternative ''antitone'' definition. One can also define Galois connections as a pair of monotone functions that satisfy the laxer condition that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''x'' ≤ ''g''(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;(''x''))}} and for all y in B, f(g(y)) ≤ y.</ref> [[function (mathematics)|functions]]: {{math|''F'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} and {{math|''G'' : ''B'' → ''A''}}, such that for all {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}, we have\n\n:{{math|''F''(''a'') ≤ ''b''}} [[if and only if]] {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''(''b'')}}.\n\nIn this situation, {{mvar|F}} is called the '''lower adjoint''' of {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|G}} is called the '''upper adjoint''' of ''F''. Mnemonically, the upper/lower terminology refers to where the function application appears relative to ≤.<ref>Gierz, p. 23</ref> The term \"adjoint\" refers to the fact that monotone Galois connections are special cases of pairs of [[adjoint functor]]s in [[category theory]] as discussed further below. Other terminology encountered here is '''left adjoint''' (respectively '''right adjoint''') for the lower (respectively upper) adjoint.\n\nAn essential property of a Galois connection is that an upper/lower adjoint of a Galois connection ''uniquely'' determines the other:\n\n:{{math|''F''(''a'')}} is the least element {{math|{{overset|~|''b''}} }} with {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''({{overset|~|''b''}})}}, and \n:{{math|''G''(''b'')}} is the largest element {{mvar|{{overset|~|''a''}}}} with {{math|''F''({{overset|~|''a''}}) ≤ ''b''}}.\n\nA consequence of this is that if {{mvar|F}} or {{mvar|G}} is [[Bijection|invertible]], then each is the [[Inverse function|inverse]] of the other, i.e. {{math|1=''F'' = ''G''<sup> −1</sup>}} .\n\nGiven a Galois connection with lower adjoint {{mvar|F}} and upper adjoint {{mvar|G}}, we can consider the compositions {{math|''GF'' : ''A'' → ''A''}}, known as the associated [[closure operator]], and {{math|''FG'' : ''B'' → ''B''}}, known as the associated kernel operator. Both are monotone and idempotent, and we have {{math|''a'' ≤ ''GF''(''a'')}} for all {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''FG''(''b'') ≤ ''b''}} for all {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}.\n\nA '''Galois insertion''' of {{mvar|A}} into {{mvar|B}} is a Galois connection in which the closure operator {{mvar|GF}} is the identity on {{mvar|A}}.<ref>{{cite book | title=Semirings for Soft Constraint Solving and Programming | volume=2962 | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | issn=0302-9743 | first=Stefano | last=Bistarelli | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2004 | isbn=3-540-21181-0 | page=102 }}</ref>\n\n=== Antitone Galois connection ===\nThe above definition is common in many applications today, and prominent in [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and [[domain theory]]. However the original notion in Galois theory is slightly different. In this alternative definition, a Galois connection is a pair of ''antitone'', i.e. order-reversing, functions {{math|''F'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} and {{math|''G'' : ''B'' → ''A''}} between two posets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, such that\n\n:{{math|''b'' ≤ ''F''(''a'')}} if and only if {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''(''b'')}}.\n\nThe symmetry of {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} in this version erases the distinction between upper and lower, and the two functions are then called '''polarities''' rather than adjoints.<ref>Galatos, p. 145</ref> Each polarity uniquely determines the other, since\n\n:{{math|''F''(''a'')}} is the largest element {{mvar|b}} with {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''(''b'')}}, and \n:{{math|''G''(''b'')}} is the largest element {{mvar|a}} with {{math|''b'' ≤ ''F''(''a'')}}.\n\nThe compositions {{math|''GF'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} and {{math|''FG'' : ''B'' → ''B''}} are the associated closure operators; they are monotone idempotent maps with the property {{math|''a'' ≤ ''GF''(''a'')}} for all {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''FG''(''b'')}} for all {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}.\n\nThe implications of the two definitions of Galois connections are very similar, since an antitone Galois connection between {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is just a monotone Galois connection between {{mvar|A}} and the [[duality (order theory)|order dual]] {{math|''B''<sup>op</sup>}} of {{mvar|B}}. All of the below statements on Galois connections can thus easily be converted into statements about antitone Galois connections.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Monotone Galois connections===\n\n====Power set; implication and conjunction====\nFor an order theoretic example, let {{mvar|U}} be some [[Set (mathematics)|set]], and let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} both be the [[power set]] of {{mvar|U}}, ordered by inclusion. Pick a fixed subset {{mvar|L}} of {{mvar|U}}. Then the maps {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}}, where {{math|''F''(''M'') {{=}} ''L'' ∩ ''M''}}, and {{math|''G''(''N'') {{=}} ''N'' ∪ (''U''&thinsp;\\&thinsp;''L'')}}, form a monotone Galois connection, with {{mvar|F}} being the lower adjoint. A similar Galois connection whose lower adjoint is given by the meet (infimum) operation can be found in any [[Heyting algebra]]. Especially, it is present in any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], where the two mappings can be described by {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} (''a'' ∧ ''x'')}} and {{math|''G''(''y'') {{=}} (''y'' ∨ ¬''a'') {{=}} (''a'' ⇒ ''y'')}}. In logical terms: \"implication from {{mvar|a}}\" is the upper adjoint of \"conjunction with {{mvar|a}}\".\n\n====Lattices====\nFurther interesting examples for Galois connections are described in the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]]. Roughly speaking, it turns out that the usual functions ∨ and ∧ are lower and upper adjoints to the diagonal map {{math|''X'' → ''X'' × ''X''}}. The least and greatest elements of a partial order are given by lower and upper adjoints to the unique function {{math|''X'' → {1}.}} Going further, even [[complete lattice]]s can be characterized by the existence of suitable adjoints. These considerations give some impression of the ubiquity of Galois connections in order theory.\n\n====Transitive group actions====\nLet {{mvar|G}} act [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|transitively]] on {{mvar|X}} and pick some point {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}. Consider\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{B} = \\{B \\subseteq X : x \\in B; \\forall g \\in G, gB = B \\ \\mathrm{or} \\ gB \\cap B = \\emptyset\\},</math>\n\nthe set of '''blocks''' containing {{mvar|x}}. Further, let <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> consist of the subgroups of {{mvar|G}} containing the [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of {{mvar|x}}.\n\nThen, the correspondence <math>\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathcal{G}</math>:\n:<math> B \\mapsto H_B = \\{g \\in G : gx \\in B\\}</math>\nis a monotone, one-to-one Galois connection.<ref>See Alperin, Bell, Groups and Representations (GTM 162), p. 32</ref> As a corollary, one can establish that doubly transitive actions have no blocks other than the trivial ones (singletons or the whole of {{mvar|X}}): this follows from the stabilizers being maximal in {{mvar|G}} in that case. See [[2-transitive group|doubly transitive group]] for further discussion.\n\n====Image and inverse image====\nIf {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp; : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], then for any subset {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}} we can form the image {{math|''F''(''M'') {{=}} &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;(''M'') {{=}} {''f''(''m'') {{!}} ''m'' ∈ ''M''} }} and for any subset {{mvar|N}} of {{mvar|Y}} we can form the inverse image {{math|''G''(''N'') {{=}} &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>−1</sup>(''N'') {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''X'' {{!}} &thinsp;''f''&thinsp;(''x'') ∈ ''N''}.}} Then {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of {{mvar|X}} and the power set of {{mvar|Y}}, both ordered by inclusion ⊆. There is a further adjoint pair in this situation: for a subset {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}}, define {{math|''H''(''M'') {{=}} {''y'' ∈ ''Y'' {{!}} &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>−1</sup>({''y''}) ⊆ ''M''}.}} Then {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of {{mvar|Y}} and the power set of {{mvar|X}}. In the first Galois connection, {{mvar|G}} is the upper adjoint, while in the second Galois connection it serves as the lower adjoint.\n\nIn the case of a [[quotient group|quotient map]] between algebraic objects (such as groups), this connection is called the [[lattice theorem]]: subgroups of {{mvar|G}} connect to subgroups of {{math|''G''/''N''}}, and the closure operator on subgroups of {{mvar|G}} is given by {{math|{{overline|''H''}} {{=}} ''HN''}}.\n\n====Span and closure====\nPick some mathematical object {{mvar|X}} that has an underlying set, for instance a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[vector space]], etc. For any subset {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|X}}, let {{math|''F''(''S'')}} be the smallest subobject of {{mvar|X}} that contains {{mvar|S}}, i.e. the [[subgroup]], [[subring]] or [[linear subspace|subspace]] generated by {{mvar|S}}. For any subobject {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|X}}, let {{math|''G''(''U'')}} be the underlying set of {{mvar|U}}. (We can even take {{mvar|X}} to be a [[topological space]], let {{math|''F''(''S'')}} the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of {{mvar|S}}, and take as \"subobjects of {{mvar|X}}\" the closed subsets of {{mvar|X}}.) Now {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} form a monotone Galois connection between subsets of {{mvar|X}} and subobjects of {{mvar|X}}, if both are ordered by inclusion. {{mvar|F}} is the lower adjoint.\n\n====Syntax and semantics====\nA very general comment of [[William Lawvere]]<ref>[[William Lawvere]], Adjointness in foundations, Dialectica, 1969, [http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/16/tr16abs.html available here]. The notation is different nowadays; an easier introduction by Peter Smith [http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Galois.pdf in these lecture notes], which also attribute the concept to the article cited.</ref> is that ''syntax and semantics'' are adjoint: take {{mvar|A}} to be the set of all logical theories (axiomatizations), and {{mvar|B}} the power set of the set of all mathematical structures. For a theory {{math|''T'' ∈ ''A''}}, let {{math|''F''(''T'')}} be the set of all structures that satisfy the axioms {{mvar|T}}; for a set of mathematical structures {{mvar|S}}, let {{math|''G''(''S'')}} be the minimum of the axiomatizations which approximate {{mvar|S}}. We can then say that {{math|''F''(''T'')}} is a subset of {{mvar|S}} if and only if {{mvar|T}} logically implies {{math|''G''(''S'')}}: the \"semantics functor\" {{mvar|F}} and the \"syntax functor\" {{mvar|G}} form a monotone Galois connection, with semantics being the lower adjoint.\n\n===Antitone galois connections===\n\n====Galois theory====\nThe motivating example comes from Galois theory: suppose {{math|''L''/''K''}} is a [[field extension]]. Let {{mvar|A}} be the set of all subfields of {{mvar|L}} that contain {{mvar|K}}, ordered by inclusion ⊆. If {{mvar|E}} is  such a subfield, write {{math|Gal(''L''/''E'')}} for the group of field automorphisms of {{mvar|L}} that hold {{mvar|E}} fixed. Let {{mvar|B}} be the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''L''/''K'')}}, ordered by inclusion ⊆. For such a subgroup {{mvar|G}}, define {{math|Fix(''G'')}} to be the field consisting of all elements of {{mvar|L}} that are held fixed by all elements of {{mvar|G}}. Then the maps {{math|''E'' {{mapsto}} Gal(''L''/''E'')}} and {{math|''G'' {{mapsto}} Fix(''G'')}} form an antitone Galois connection.\n\n====Algebraic topology: covering spaces====\nAnalogously, given a [[path-connected]] [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}, there is an antitone Galois connection between subgroups of the fundamental group {{math|''π''<sub>1</sub>(''X'')}} and [[path-connected]] covering spaces of {{mvar|X}}. In particular, if {{mvar|X}} is [[semi-locally simply connected]], then for every subgroup {{mvar|G}} of {{math|''π''<sub>1</sub>(''X'')}}, there is a covering space with {{mvar|G}} as its fundamental group.\n\n====Linear algebra: annihilators and orthogonal complements====\nGiven an [[inner product space]] {{mvar|V}}, we can form the [[orthogonal complement]] {{math|''F''(''X'')}} of any subspace {{mvar|X}} of {{mvar|V}}. This yields an antitone Galois connection between the set of subspaces of {{mvar|V}} and itself, ordered by inclusion; both polarities are equal to {{mvar|F}}.\n\nGiven a [[vector space]] {{mvar|V}} and a subset {{mvar|X}} of {{mvar|V}} we can define its annihilator {{math|''F''(''X'')}}, consisting of all elements of the [[dual space]] {{math|''V''&thinsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} of {{mvar|V}} that vanish on {{mvar|X}}. Similarly, given a subset {{mvar|Y}} of {{math|''V''&thinsp;<sup>∗</sup>}}, we define its annihilator {{math|''G''(''Y'') {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''V'' {{!}} ''φ''(''x'') {{=}} 0 ∀''φ'' ∈ ''Y''}.}} This gives an antitone Galois connection between the subsets of {{mvar|V}} and the subsets of {{math|''V''&thinsp;<sup>∗</sup>}}.\n\n====Algebraic geometry====\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], the relation between sets of [[polynomial]]s and their zero sets is an antitone Galois connection.\n\nFix a [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}} and a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|K}} and let {{mvar|A}} be the set of all subsets of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''K''[''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X<sub>n</sub>'']}} ordered by inclusion ⊆, and let {{mvar|B}} be the set of all subsets of {{math|''K<sup>n</sup>''}} ordered by inclusion ⊆. If {{mvar|S}} is a set of polynomials, define the [[Algebraic geometry#Affine varieties|variety]] of zeros as\n\n:<math>V(S) = \\{x \\in K^n : f(x) = 0 \\mbox{ for all } f \\in S\\},</math>\n\nthe set of common zeros of the polynomials in {{mvar|S}}. If {{mvar|U}} is a subset of {{math|''K<sup>n</sup>''}}, define {{math|''I''(''U'')}} as an ideal of polynomials vanishing on {{mvar|U}}, that is\n\n:<math>I(U) = \\{ f \\in K[X_1,\\cdots,X_n] : f(x) = 0 \\mbox{ for all } x \\in U\\}.</math>\n\nThen {{mvar|V}} and ''I'' form an antitone Galois connection.\n\nThe closure on {{math|''K<sup>n</sup>''}} is the closure in the [[Zariski topology]], and if the field {{mvar|K}} is [[Algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], then the closure on the polynomial ring is the [[Radical of an ideal|radical]] of ideal generated by {{mvar|S}}.\n\nMore generally, given a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}} (not necessarily a polynomial ring), there is an antitone Galois connection between radical ideals in the ring and subvarieties of the [[Algebraic geometry#Affine varieties|affine variety]] [[Spectrum of a ring|{{math|Spec(''R'')}}]].\n\nMore generally, there is an antitone Galois connection between ideals in the ring and [[subscheme]]s of the corresponding [[Algebraic geometry#Affine varieties|affine variety]].\n\n====Connections on power sets arising from binary relations====\nSuppose {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are arbitrary sets and a [[binary relation]] {{mvar|R}} over {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} is given. For any subset {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}}, we define {{math|''F''(''M'') {{=}} {''y'' ∈ ''Y'' {{!}} ''mRy'' ∀''m'' ∈ ''M''}.}} Similarly, for any subset {{mvar|N}} of {{mvar|Y}}, define {{math|''G''(''N'') {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''X'' {{!}} ''xRn'' ∀''n'' ∈ ''N''}.}} Then {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} yield an antitone Galois connection between the power sets of {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}}, both ordered by inclusion ⊆. <ref> Birkhoff, 1st edition (1940): §32, 3rd edition (1967): Ch. V, §7 and §8</ref>\n\nUp to isomorphism ''all'' antitone Galois connections between power sets arise in this way. This follows from the \"Basic Theorem on Concept Lattices\" <ref>Ganter, B. and Wille, R. ''Formal Concept Analysis -- Mathematical Foundations'', Springer (1999), {{ISBN|978-3-540-627715}}</ref>. Theory and applications of Galois connections arising from binary relations are studied in [[formal concept analysis]]. That field uses Galois connections for mathematical data analysis.  Many algorithms for Galois connections can be found in the respective literature, e.g., in <ref> Ganter, B. and Obiedkov, S. ''Conceptual Exploration'', Springer (2016), {{ISBN|978-3-662-49290-1}}</ref>.\n\n== Properties ==\nIn the following, we consider a (monotone) Galois connection {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp; {{=}} (&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>, &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>)}}, where {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup> : ''A'' → ''B''}} is the lower adjoint as introduced above. Some helpful and instructive basic properties can be obtained immediately. By the defining property of Galois connections, {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'') ≤ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'')}} is equivalent to {{math|''x'' ≤ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x''))}}, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}}. By a similar reasoning (or just by applying the [[duality (order theory)|duality principle for order theory]]), one finds that {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''y'')) ≤ ''y''}}, for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|B}}. These properties can be described by saying the composite {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup> ∘ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}} is ''deflationary'', while {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} is ''inflationary'' (or ''extensive'').\n\nNow consider {{math|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A''}} such that {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}, then using the above one obtains {{math|''x'' ≤ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''y''))}}. Applying the basic property of Galois connections, one can now conclude that {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'') ≤ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''y'')}}. But this just shows that {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} preserves the order of any two elements, i.e. it is monotone. Again, a similar reasoning yields monotonicity of {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}}. Thus monotonicity does not have to be included in the definition explicitly. However, mentioning monotonicity helps to avoid confusion about the two alternative notions of Galois connections.\n\nAnother basic property of Galois connections is the fact that {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x''))) {{=}} &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x'')}}, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|B}}. Clearly we find that\n\n:{{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x''))) ≥ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x'')}}.\n\nbecause {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} is inflationary as shown above. On the other hand, since {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup> ∘ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}} is deflationary, while {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}} is monotonic, one finds that\n\n:{{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x''))) ≤ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x'')}}.\n\nThis shows the desired equality. Furthermore, we can use this property to conclude that\n\n:{{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x'')))) {{=}} &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''x''))}}\n\nand\n\n:{{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'')))) {{=}} &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x''))}}\n\ni.e., {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup> ∘ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}} and {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} are [[idempotent]].\n\nIt can be shown (see Blyth or Erné for proofs) that a function {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;}} is a lower (resp. upper) adjoint if and only if {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;}} is a [[residuated mapping]] (resp. residual mapping). Therefore, the notion of residuated mapping and monotone Galois connection are essentially the same.\n\n== Closure operators and Galois connections ==\nThe above findings can be summarized as follows: for a Galois connection, the composite {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} is monotone (being the composite of monotone functions), inflationary, and idempotent. This states that {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} is in fact a [[closure operator]] on {{mvar|A}}. Dually, {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup> ∘ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}} is monotone, deflationary, and idempotent. Such mappings are sometimes called '''kernel operators'''. In the context of [[frames and locales]], the composite {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} is called the '''nucleus''' induced by {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;}}. Nuclei induce frame homomorphisms; a subset of a locale is called a [[sublocale]] if it is given by a nucleus.\n\nConversely, any closure operator {{mvar|c}} on some poset {{mvar|A}} gives rise to the Galois connection with lower adjoint {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>}} being just the corestriction of {{mvar|c}} to the image of {{mvar|c}} (i.e. as a surjective mapping the closure system {{math|''c''(''A'')}}). The upper adjoint {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}} is then given by the inclusion of {{math|''c''(''A'')}} into {{mvar|A}}, that maps each closed element to itself, considered as an element of {{mvar|A}}. In this way, closure operators and Galois connections are seen to be closely related, each specifying an instance of the other. Similar conclusions hold true for kernel operators.\n\nThe above considerations also show that closed elements of {{mvar|A}} (elements {{mvar|x}} with {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}) are mapped to elements within the range of the kernel operator {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup> ∘ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>}}, and vice versa.\n\n== Existence and uniqueness of Galois connections ==\nAnother important property of Galois connections is that lower adjoints [[limit preserving (order theory)|preserve]] all [[supremum|suprema]] that exist within their [[function domain|domain]]. Dually, upper adjoints preserve all existing [[infimum|infima]]. From these properties, one can also conclude monotonicity of the adjoints immediately. The [[adjoint functor theorem (order theory)|adjoint functor theorem for order theory]] states that the converse implication is also valid in certain cases: especially, any mapping between [[complete lattice]]s that preserves all suprema is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection.\n\nIn this situation, an important feature of Galois connections is that one adjoint uniquely determines the other. Hence one can strengthen the above statement to guarantee that any supremum-preserving map between complete lattices is the lower adjoint of a unique Galois connection. The main property to derive this uniqueness is the following: For every {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'')}} is the least element {{mvar|y}} of {{mvar|B}} such that {{math|''x'' ≤ &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''y'')}}. Dually, for every {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|B}}, {{math|&thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>(''y'')}} is the greatest {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}} such that {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>(''x'') ≤ ''y''}}. The existence of a certain Galois connection now implies the existence of the respective least or greatest elements, no matter whether the corresponding posets satisfy any [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]]. Thus, when one upper adjoint of a Galois connection is given, the other upper adjoint can be defined via this same property.\n\nOn the other hand, some monotone function {{math|&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;}} is a lower adjoint [[if and only if]] each set of the form {{math|{''x'' ∈ ''A'' {{!}} &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;(''x'') ≤ ''b''},}} for {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}, contains a greatest element. Again, this can be dualized for the upper adjoint.\n\n== Galois connections as morphisms ==\nGalois connections also provide an interesting class of mappings between posets which can be used to obtain [[category theory|categories]] of posets. Especially, it is possible to compose Galois connections: given Galois connections {{math|(&thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>, &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub>)}} between posets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} and {{math|(''g''<sup>∗</sup>, ''g''<sub>∗</sub>)}} between {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}}, the composite {{math|(''g''<sup>∗</sup> ∘ &thinsp;''f''&nbsp;<sup>∗</sup>, &thinsp;''f''<sub>∗</sub> ∘ ''g''<sub>∗</sub>)}} is also a Galois connection. When considering categories of complete lattices, this can be simplified to considering just mappings preserving all suprema (or, alternatively, infima). Mapping complete lattices to their duals, this categories display auto [[duality (category theory)|duality]], that are quite fundamental for obtaining other duality theorems. More special kinds of morphisms that induce adjoint mappings in the other direction are the morphisms usually considered for [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] (or locales).\n\n== Connection to category theory ==\nEvery partially ordered set can be viewed as a [[category theory|category]] in a natural way: there is a unique morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' [[if and only if]] {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}. A monotone Galois connection is then nothing but a pair of [[adjoint functors]] between two categories that arise from partially ordered sets. In this context, the upper adjoint is the ''right adjoint'' while the lower adjoint is the ''left adjoint''. However, this terminology is avoided for Galois connections, since there was a time when posets were transformed into categories in a [[dual (category theory)|dual]] fashion, i.e. with arrows pointing in the opposite direction. This led to a complementary notation concerning left and right adjoints, which today is ambiguous.\n\n== Applications in the theory of programming ==\nGalois connections may be used to describe many forms of abstraction in the theory of [[abstract interpretation]] of [[programming language]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Patrick Cousot |author2=Radhia Cousot | chapter=Abstract Interpretation: A Unified Lattice Model for Static Analysis of Programs by Construction or Approximation of Fixpoints| title=Proc. 4th ACM Symp. on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL)|date=Jan 1977| pages=238–252 |url=http://www.di.ens.fr/~cousot/publications.www/CousotCousot-POPL-77-ACM-p238--252-1977.pdf}}<BR>For a counterexample for the false theorem in Sect.7 (p.243 top right), see: {{cite techreport|author1=Jochen Burghardt |author2=Florian Kammüller |author3=Jeff W.

This covers many finite cases of interest; see picture for a negative example. However, unbounded posets can be more complicated.\n\nA candidate rank function, compatible with the ordering, makes a poset into graded poset if and only if, whenever one has ''x''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''z'' with ''z'' of rank ''n''+1, an element ''y'' of rank ''n'' can be found with ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''z''. This condition is sufficient because if ''z'' is taken to be a cover of ''x'', the only possible choice is ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' showing that the ranks of ''x'' and ''z'' differ by 1, and it is necessary because in a graded poset one can take for ''y'' any element of maximal rank with ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''z'', which always exists and is covered by ''z''.\n\nOften a poset comes with a natural candidate for a rank function; for instance if its elements are finite subsets of some base set ''B'', one can take the number of elements of those subsets. Then the criterion just given can be more practical than the definition because it avoids mention of covers. For instance if ''B'' is itself a poset, and ''P'' consists of its finite [[lower set]]s (subsets for which with every one of its elements, all smaller elements are also in the subset), then the criterion is automatically satisfied, since for lower sets ''x''&nbsp;⊂&nbsp;''z'' there is always a [[maximal element]] of ''z'' that is absent from ''x'', and it can be removed from ''z'' to form ''y''.\n\n:In some common posets such as the [[face lattice]] of a [[convex polytope]] there is a natural grading by [[dimension]], which if used as rank function would give the minimal element, the empty face, rank –1. In such cases it might be convenient to bend the definition stated above by adjoining the value –1 to the set of values allowed for the rank function. Allowing arbitrary integers as rank would however give a fundamentally different notion; for instance the existence of a minimal element would no longer be assured.\n\nA graded poset (with positive integer ranks) cannot have any elements ''x'' for which arbitrarily long [[Glossary of order theory#C|chains]] with greatest element ''x'' exist, as otherwise it would have to have elements of arbitrarily small (and eventually negative) rank. For instance, the [[integer]]s (with the usual order) cannot be a graded poset, nor can any interval (with more than one element) of rational or [[real number]]s. (In particular, graded posets are [[well-founded]], meaning that they satisfy the [[descending chain condition]] (DCC): they do not contain any [[infinite descending chain]]s.<ref>Not containing arbitrarily long descending chains starting at a fixed element of course excludes any infinite descending chains. The former condition is strictly stronger though; the set <math>\\N\\cup\\{\\infty\\}</math> has arbitrarily long chains descending from&nbsp;<math>\\infty</math>, but has no infinite descending chains.</ref>) Henceforth we shall therefore only consider posets in which this does not happen. This implies that whenever ''x''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''y'' we can get from ''x'' to ''y'' by repeatedly choosing a cover, finitely many times. It also means that (for positive integer rank functions) compatibility of ρ with the ordering follows from the requirement about covers. As a variant of the definition of a graded poset, Birkhoff<ref>'Lattice Theory', Am. Math. Soc., Colloquium Publications, Vol.25, 1967, p.5</ref> allows rank functions to have arbitrary (rather than only nonnegative) integer values. In this variant, the integers can be graded (by the identity function) in his setting, and the compatibility of ranks with the ordering is not redundant. As a third variant, Brightwell and West<ref>See reference [2], p.722.</ref> define a rank function to be integer-valued, but don't require its compatibility with the ordering; hence this variant can grade even e.g. the real numbers by any function, as the requirement about covers is [[vacuous truth|vacuous]] for this example.\n\nNote that graded posets need not satisfy the [[ascending chain condition]] (ACC): for instance, the natural numbers contain the infinite ascending chain <math>0 < 1 < 2 < \\cdots</math>.\n\nA poset is graded if and only if every connected component of its [[comparability graph]] is graded, so further characterizations will suppose this comparability graph to be connected. On each connected component the rank function is only unique up to a uniform shift (so the rank function can always be chosen so that the elements of minimal rank in their connected component have rank 0).\n\nIf ''P'' has a [[least element]] Ô then being graded is equivalent to the condition that for any element ''x'' all [[Glossary of order theory#M|maximal chains]] in the [[Glossary of order theory#I|interval]] [Ô,''x''] have the same length. This condition is necessary since every step in a maximal chain is a covering relation, which should change the rank by&nbsp;1. The condition is also sufficient, since when it holds, one can use the mentioned length to define the rank of ''x'' (the length of a finite chain is its number of \"steps\", so one less than its number of elements), and whenever ''x'' covers ''y'', adjoining ''x'' to a maximal chain in [Ô,''y''] gives a maximal chain in [Ô,''x''].\n\nIf ''P'' also has a [[greatest element]] Î (so that it is a [[bounded poset]]), then the previous condition can be simplified to the requirement that all maximal chains in ''P'' have the same (finite) length. This suffices, since any pair of maximal chains in [Ô,''x''] can be extended by a maximal chain in [''x'',Î] to give a pair of maximal chains in ''P''.\n\n:''Note'' [[Richard P. Stanley|Stanley]] defines a poset to be '''graded of length''' ''n'' if all its maximal chains have length ''n'' (Stanley 1997, p.99). This definition is given in a context where interest is mostly in finite posets, and although the book subsequently often drops the part \"of length ''n''\", it does not seem appropriate to use this as definition of \"graded\" for general posets, because (1) it says nothing about posets whose maximal chains are infinite, in particular (2) it excludes important posets like [[Young's lattice]]. Also it is not clear why in a graded poset all minimal elements, as well as all maximal elements, should be required to have the same length, even if Stanley gives examples making clear that he does mean to require that  (ibid, pp.216 and 219).\n\n== The usual case ==\nMany authors in [[combinatorics]] define graded posets in such a way that all [[minimal element]]s of ''P'' must have rank 0, and moreover that there is a maximal rank ''r'' which is the rank of any maximal element. Then being graded means that all maximal chains have length ''r'', as is indicated above. In this case one says that ''P'' has rank ''r''.\n\nFurthermore, in this case with the '''rank levels''' are associated  the '''rank numbers''' or '''Whitney numbers''' '''<math>W_0,W_1,W_2,... </math>'''. These [[number]]s are defined by '''<math>W_i</math>  = number of elements of ''P'' having rank ''i'' '''.\n\nThe '''Whitney numbers''' are connected with a lot of important combinatorial [[theorem]]s. The classic example is [[Sperner's theorem]] which can be formulated as follows:\n\n:''For the [[powerset]] <math> \\mathcal P(S) </math> of every [[finite set]]  '''<math>S</math>''' the maximum [[cardinality]] of a [[Sperner family]] equals the [[maximum]] '''Whitney number'''.''\n\nThis means: \n:''Every finite [[powerset]] has the [[Sperner property of a partially ordered set|Sperner property]]''\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Graded (mathematics)]]\n* [[Prewellordering]] – a prewellordering with a norm is analogous to a graded poset, replacing a map to the integers with a map to the ordinals\n* [[Star product]], a method for combining two graded posets\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{cite book | last = Stanley| first = Richard | authorlink=Richard P.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Elements of partially ordered sets that are greater and smaller than each other element, respectively}}\nIn [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], the '''greatest element''' of a subset ''S'' of a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is an element of ''S'' that is greater than every other element of ''S''. The term '''least element''' is defined [[duality (order theory)|dually]], that is, it is an element of ''S'' that is smaller than every other element of ''S''.\n\nFormally, given a partially ordered set (''P'', ≤), an element ''g'' of a subset ''S'' of ''P'' is the greatest element of ''S'' if\n\n: ''s'' ≤ ''g'', for all elements ''s'' of ''S''.\n\nHence, the greatest element of ''S'' is an [[upper bound]] of ''S'' that is contained within this subset. It is necessarily unique. By using ≥ instead of ≤ in the above definition, one defines the least element of ''S''.\n\nLike upper bounds, greatest elements may fail to exist. Even if a set has some upper bounds, it need not have a greatest element, as shown by the example of the negative [[real number]]s.  This example also demonstrates that the existence of a [[least upper bound]] (the number 0 in this case) does not imply the existence of a greatest element either. Similar conclusions hold for least elements. A finite [[chain (order theory)|chain]] always has a greatest and a least element.\n\nThe greatest element of a partially ordered subset must not be confused with ''[[maximal element]]s'' of the set, which are elements that are not smaller than any other elements. A set can have several maximal elements without having a greatest element. However, if it has a greatest element, it can't have any other maximal element.\n\nIn a [[total order|totally ordered set]] both terms coincide; it is also called '''maximum'''; in the case of function values it is also called the '''absolute maximum''', to avoid confusion with a [[local maximum]].<ref>The notion of locality requires the function's domain to be at least a [[topological space]].</ref> The dual terms are '''minimum''' and '''absolute minimum'''. Together they are called the '''[[extreme value|absolute extrema]]'''.\n\nThe least and greatest element of the whole partially ordered set plays a special role and is also called '''bottom''' and '''top''', or '''zero''' (0) and '''unit''' (1), or ⊥ and ⊤, respectively. If both exists, the poset is called a '''bounded poset'''. The notation of 0 and 1 is used preferably when the poset is even a [[complemented lattice]], and when no confusion is likely, i.e. when one is not talking about partial orders of numbers that already contain elements 0 and 1 different from bottom and top. The existence of least and greatest elements is a special [[completeness (order theory)|completeness property]] of a partial order.\n\nFurther introductory information is found in the article on [[order theory]].\n\n==Examples==\n*The subset of [[integer]]s has no upper bound in the set ℝ of [[real number]]s.\n*Let the relation \"≤\" on {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''} be given by ''a'' ≤ ''c'', ''a'' ≤ ''d'', ''b'' ≤ ''c'', ''b'' ≤ ''d''. The set {''a'', ''b''} has upper bounds ''c'' and ''d'', but no least upper bound, and no greatest element.\n*In the [[rational number]]s, the set of numbers with their square less than 2 has upper bounds but no greatest element and no least upper bound.\n*In ℝ, the set of numbers less than 1 has a least upper bound, viz. 1, but no greatest element.\n*In ℝ, the set of numbers less than or equal to 1 has a greatest element, viz. 1, which is also its least upper bound.\n*In ℝ² with the [[product order]], the set of pairs (''x'', ''y'') with 0 < ''x'' < 1 has no upper bound.\n*In ℝ² with the [[lexicographical order]], this set has upper bounds, e.g. (1, 0).

      "text": "{{confuse|Hess diagram}}\n[[File:Inclusion ordering.svg|thumb|The [[power set]] of a 2-element set ordered by [[subset|inclusion]] ]]\nIn [[order theory]], a '''Hasse diagram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhasə|lang}}) is a type of [[mathematical diagram]] used to represent a finite [[partially ordered set]], in the form of a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of its [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, for a partially ordered set ''(S, ≤)'' one represents each element of ''S'' as a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] in the plane and draws a [[line segment]] or curve that goes ''upward'' from ''x'' to ''y'' whenever ''y'' [[Covering relation|covers]] ''x'' (that is, whenever ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y'').\nThese curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its partial order.\n\nHasse diagrams are named after [[Helmut Hasse]] (1898–1979); according to {{harvs|txt|first=Garrett|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff|year=1948}}, they are so called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse was not the first to use these diagrams. One example that predates Hasse can be found in {{harvs|txt|last=Vogt|first=Henri Gustav|year=1895}}. Although Hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using [[graph drawing]] techniques.<ref>E.g., see {{harvtxt|Di Battista|Tamassia|1988}} and {{harvtxt|Freese|2004}}.</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"Hasse diagram\" may also refer to the transitive reduction as an abstract [[directed acyclic graph]], independently of any drawing of that graph, but this usage is eschewed here.<ref>{{citation|title=Graph theory: an algorithmic approach|first=Nicos|last=Christofides|publisher=Academic Press|year=1975|pages=170–174}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Graphs: Theory and Algorithms|first1=K.|last1=Thulasiraman|first2=M.

The reason is that there will in general be many possible ways to draw a Hasse diagram for a given poset. The simple technique of just starting with the [[minimal element]]s of an order and then drawing greater elements incrementally often produces quite poor results: symmetries and internal structure of the order are easily lost.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the issue. Consider the [[power set]] of a 4-element set ordered by inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math>. Below are four different Hasse diagrams for this partial order. Each subset has a node labelled with a binary encoding that shows whether a certain element is in the subset (1) or not (0):\n\n{| style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Hypercubeorder binary.svg|230px|]] ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[File:Hypercubecubes binary.svg|260px|]] ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[File:Hypercubestar binary.svg|240px|]] ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[File:Hypercubematrix binary.svg|180px|]]\n|}\n\nThe first diagram makes clear that the power set is a [[graded poset]]. The second diagram has the same graded structure, but by making some edges longer than others, it emphasizes that the [[tesseract|4-dimensional cube]] is a union of two 3-dimensional cubes. The third diagram shows some of the internal symmetry of the structure. In the fourth diagram the vertices are arranged like the elements of a 4×4 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].\n\n==Upward planarity==\n{{main|Upward planar drawing}}\n[[File:Dih4 subgroups.svg|thumb|This Hasse diagram of the [[lattice of subgroups]] of the [[dihedral group]] [[Dihedral group of order 8|Dih<sub>4</sub>]] has no crossing edges.]]\nIf a partial order can be drawn as a Hasse diagram in which no two edges cross, its covering graph is said to be ''upward planar''. A number of results on upward planarity and on crossing-free Hasse diagram construction are known:\n*If the partial order to be drawn is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then it can be drawn without crossings if and only if it has [[order dimension]] at most two.<ref>{{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995a}}, Theorem 9, p. 118; {{harvtxt|Baker|Fishburn|Roberts|1971}}, theorem 4.1, page 18.</ref> In this case, a non-crossing drawing may be found by deriving Cartesian coordinates for the elements from their positions in the two linear orders realizing the order dimension, and then rotating the drawing counterclockwise by a 45-degree angle.\n*If the partial order has at most one [[minimal element]], or it has at most one [[maximal element]], then it may be tested in [[linear time]] whether it has a non-crossing Hasse diagram.<ref>{{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995a}}, Theorem 15, p. 125; {{harvtxt|Bertolazzi|Di Battista|Mannino|Tamassia|1993}}.</ref>\n*It is [[NP-complete]] to determine whether a partial order with multiple sources and sinks can be drawn as a crossing-free Hasse diagram.<ref>{{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995a}}, Corollary 1, p. 132; {{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995b}}.</ref> However, finding a crossing-free Hasse diagram is [[fixed-parameter tractable]] when parametrized by the number of [[articulation point]]s and [[triconnected component]]s of the transitive reduction of the partial order.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}.</ref>\n*If the ''y''-coordinates of the elements of a partial order are specified, then a crossing-free Hasse diagram respecting those coordinate assignments can be found in linear time, if such a diagram exists.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jünger|Leipert|1999}}.</ref> In particular, if the input poset is a [[graded poset]], it is possible to determine in linear time whether there is a crossing-free Hasse diagram in which the height of each vertex is proportional to its rank.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Helmut Hasse]]\n* [[Order theory]] \n* [[Partially ordered set]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first1=Kirby A.|last1=Baker|first2=Peter C.|last2=Fishburn|author2-link=Peter C.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Hausdorff maximal principle''' is an alternate and earlier formulation of [[Zorn's lemma]] proved by [[Felix Hausdorff]] in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.\n\nThe Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] over ZF ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the '''Hausdorff maximality theorem''' or the '''Kuratowski lemma''' (Kelley 1955:33).\n\n==Statement==\n\nThe Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.\n\nAn equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.\n\nTo prove that it follows from the original form, let ''A'' be a [[poset]]. Then <math>\\varnothing</math> is a totally ordered subset of ''A'', hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing <math>\\varnothing</math>, in particular ''A'' contains a maximal totally ordered subset.\n\nFor the converse direction, let ''A'' be a partially ordered set and ''T'' a totally ordered subset of ''A''. Then\n:<math>\\{S\\mid T\\subseteq S\\subseteq A\\mbox{ and S totally ordered}\\}</math>\nis partially ordered by set inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math>, therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset ''P''. Then the set <math>M=\\bigcup P</math> satisfies the desired properties.\n\nThe proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.\n\n== Examples ==\n'''EXAMPLE 1.'''    If ''A'' is any collection of sets, the relation \"is a proper subset of\" is a [[strict partial order]] on ''A''. Suppose that ''A'' is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of ''A'' consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.\n\n'''EXAMPLE 2.''' If (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) and (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) are two points of the plane ℝ<sup>2</sup>, define (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) < (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)\n\nif y<sub>0</sub> = y<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>0</sub> < x<sub>1</sub>. This is a partial ordering of ℝ<sup>2</sup> under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal totally ordered sets are horizontal lines in ℝ<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==References==\n* [[John L.

In this case, the following equivalent definition can be given:\na subset ''I'' of a lattice (''P'',≤) is an ideal [[if and only if]] it is a lower set that is closed under finite joins ([[suprema]]), i.e., it is nonempty and for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'', the element ''x''<math>\\vee</math>''y'' of ''P'' is also in ''I''.{{sfn|Burris|Sankappanavar|1981|loc=Def. 8.2}}\n\nThe [[duality (order theory)|dual]] notion of an ideal, i.e., the concept obtained by reversing all ≤ and exchanging <math>\\vee</math> with <math>\\wedge</math>, is a '''[[Filter (mathematics)|filter]]'''. \n\nSome authors use the term ideal to mean a lower set, i.e., they include only condition 2 above.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lawson|1998}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=2805q4tFiCkC|page=22|text=is said to be an order ideal if}} p. 22]</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Stanley|2002}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=EvJg1VjIGyMC|page=100|text=order}} p. 100]</ref><ref name=\"DP\"/> With this weaker definition, an ideal of a lattice seen as a poset is not closed under joins, so it is not necessarily an ideal of the lattice.<ref name=\"DP\">Davey & Priestley, ''Introduction to Lattices and Order'' (Second Edition), 2002, p. 20 and 44</ref> Wikipedia uses only \"ideal/filter (of order theory)\" and \"lower/upper set\" to avoid confusion.\n\n[[Frink ideal]]s, [[pseudoideal]]s and [[pseudoideal|Doyle pseudoideals]] are different generalizations of the notion of a lattice ideal.\n\nAn ideal or filter is said to be '''proper''' if it is not equal to the whole set ''P''.{{sfn|Burris|Sankappanavar|1981|loc=Def. 8.2}}\n\nThe smallest ideal that contains a given element ''p'' is a '''principal ideal''' and ''p'' is said to be a '''principal element''' of the ideal in this situation. The principal ideal <math>\\downarrow</math>''p'' for a principal ''p'' is thus given by <math>\\downarrow</math>''p'' = {''x'' in ''P''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''p''}.\n\n== Prime ideals ==\n\nAn important special case of an ideal is constituted by those ideals whose set-theoretic complements are filters, i.e. ideals in the inverse order. Such ideals are called '''prime ideals'''. Also note that, since we require ideals and filters to be non-empty, every '''prime ideal''' is necessarily proper. For lattices, prime ideals can be characterized as follows:\n\nA subset ''I'' of a lattice (''P'',≤) is a prime ideal, if and only if  \n\n# ''I'' is a proper ideal of ''P'', and\n# for all elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''P'', ''x''<math>\\wedge</math>''y'' in ''I'' implies that ''x'' is in ''I'' or ''y'' is in ''I''.\n\nIt is easily checked that this is indeed equivalent to stating that ''P'' \\ ''I'' is a filter (which is then also prime, in the dual sense).\n\nFor a [[complete lattice]] the further notion of a '''completely prime ideal''' \nis meaningful. It is defined to be a proper ideal ''I'' with the additional \nproperty that, whenever the meet ([[infimum]]) of some arbitrary set ''A'' \nis in ''I'', some element of ''A'' is also in ''I''. So this is just a \nspecific prime ideal that extends the above conditions to infinite meets.\n\nThe existence of prime ideals is in general not obvious, and often a satisfactory amount of prime ideals cannot be derived within ZF ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the [[axiom of choice]]). \nThis issue is discussed in various [[Boolean prime ideal theorem|prime ideal theorem]]s, which are necessary for many applications that require prime ideals.\n\n== Maximal ideals ==\n\nAn ideal ''I'' is '''maximal''' if it is proper and there is no ''proper'' ideal ''J'' that is a strictly greater set than ''I''. Likewise, a filter ''F'' is maximal if it is proper and there is no proper filter that is strictly greater.\n\nWhen a poset is a [[distributive lattice]], maximal ideals and filters are necessarily prime, while the converse of this statement is false in general.\n\nMaximal filters are sometimes called [[ultrafilter]]s, but this terminology is often reserved for Boolean algebras, where a maximal filter (ideal) is a filter (ideal) that contains exactly one of the elements {''a'', ¬''a''}, for each element ''a'' of the Boolean algebra. In Boolean algebras, the terms ''prime ideal'' and ''maximal ideal'' coincide, as do the terms ''prime filter'' and ''maximal filter''.\n\nThere is another interesting notion of maximality of ideals: Consider an ideal ''I'' and a filter ''F'' such that ''I'' is [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''F''. We are interested in an ideal ''M'' that is maximal among all ideals that contain ''I'' and are disjoint from ''F''. In the case of distributive lattices such an ''M'' is always a prime ideal. A proof of this statement follows.\n\n::'''Proof.''' Assume the ideal ''M'' is maximal with respect to disjointness from the filter ''F''. Suppose for a contradiction that ''M'' is not prime, i.e. there exists a pair of elements ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a''<math>\\wedge</math>''b'' in ''M'' but neither ''a'' nor ''b'' are in ''M''. Consider the case that for all ''m'' in ''M'', ''m''<math>\\vee</math>''a'' is not in ''F''. One can construct an ideal ''N'' by taking the downward closure of the set of all binary joins of this form, i.e. ''N'' = { ''x'' | ''x''≤ ''m''<math>\\vee</math>''a'' for some ''m'' in ''M''}. It is readily checked that ''N'' is indeed an ideal disjoint from ''F'' which is strictly greater than ''M''. But this contradicts the maximality of ''M'' and thus the assumption that ''M'' is not prime. \n::For the other case, assume that there is some ''m'' in ''M'' with ''m''<math>\\vee</math>''a'' in ''F''. Now if any element ''n'' in ''M'' is such that ''n''<math>\\vee</math>''b'' is in ''F'', one finds that (''m''<math>\\vee</math>''n'')<math>\\vee</math>''b'' and (''m''<math>\\vee</math>''n'')<math>\\vee</math>''a'' are both in ''F''. But then their meet is in ''F'' and, by distributivity, (''m''<math>\\vee</math>''n'') <math>\\vee</math>(''a''<math>\\wedge</math>''b'') is in ''F'' too. On the other hand, this finite join of elements of ''M'' is clearly in ''M'', such that the assumed existence of ''n'' contradicts the disjointness of the two sets. Hence all elements ''n'' of ''M'' have a join with ''b'' that is not in ''F''. Consequently one can apply the above construction with ''b'' in place of ''a'' to obtain an ideal that is strictly greater than ''M'' while being disjoint from ''F''. This finishes the proof.\n\nHowever, in general it is not clear whether there exists any ideal ''M'' that is maximal in this sense. Yet, if we assume the [[Axiom of Choice]] in our set theory, then the existence of ''M'' for every disjoint filter–ideal-pair can be shown. In the special case that the considered order is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], this theorem is called the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]]. It is strictly weaker than the Axiom of Choice and it turns out that nothing more is needed for many order theoretic applications of ideals.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe construction of ideals and filters is an important tool in many applications of order theory.\n* In [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]], the maximal ideals (or, equivalently via the negation map, ultrafilters) are used to obtain the set of points of a [[topological space]], whose [[clopen set]]s are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the original Boolean algebra.\n* Order theory knows many [[completion (order theory)|completion procedures]], to turn posets into posets with additional [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] properties. For example, the [[ideal completion]] of a given partial order ''P'' is the set of all ideals of ''P'' ordered by subset inclusion. This construction yields the [[free object|free]] [[directed complete partial order|dcpo]] generated by ''P''. An ideal is principal if and only if it is [[Compact element|compact]] in the ideal completion, so the original poset can be recovered as the sub-poset consisting of compact elements. Furthermore, every [[algebraic poset|algebraic dcpo]] can be reconstructed as the ideal completion of its set of compact elements.\n\n== History ==\n\nIdeals were introduced first by [[Marshall H. Stone]], who derived their name from the ring ideals of abstract algebra. He adopted this terminology because, using the [[isomorphism of categories|isomorphism of the categories]] of [[Boolean algebra (structure) | Boolean algebras]] and of [[Boolean ring]]s, the two notions do indeed coincide.\n\n== Literature ==\nIdeals and filters are among the most basic concepts of order theory.

      "text": "In [[order theory]], a field of [[mathematics]], an '''incidence algebra''' is an [[associative algebra]], defined for every [[locally finite partially ordered set]]\nand [[commutative ring]] with unity. Subalgebras called '''reduced incidence algebras''' give a natural construction of various types of [[Generating functions|generating function]]<nowiki/>s used in combinatorics and number theory.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''locally finite''' [[poset]] is one in which every closed [[Partially_ordered_set#Interval|interval]]\n:[''a, b''] = {''x'' : ''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''}\nis [[finite set|finite]].\n\nThe members of the incidence algebra are the [[function (mathematics)|function]]s ''f'' assigning to each nonempty interval [''a, b''] a scalar ''f''(''a'', ''b''), which is taken from the ''ring of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]'', a commutative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with unity.  On this underlying set one defines addition and scalar multiplication pointwise, and \"multiplication\" in the incidence algebra is a [[convolution]] defined by\n\n:<math>(f*g)(a, b)=\\sum_{a\\leq x\\leq b}f(a, x)g(x, b).</math>\n\nAn incidence algebra is finite-dimensional if and only if the underlying poset is finite.\n\n===Related concepts===\nAn incidence algebra is analogous to a [[group ring|group algebra]]; indeed, both the group algebra and the incidence algebra are special cases of a [[category algebra]], defined analogously; [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[partially ordered set|posets]] being special kinds of [[category (mathematics)|categories]].\n\n==Special elements==\nThe multiplicative identity element of the incidence algebra is the '''[[Kronecker delta|delta function]]''', defined by\n\n:<math>\n\\delta(a, b) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } a=b, \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } a \\ne b.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe '''zeta function''' of an incidence algebra is the constant function ''ζ''(''a'', ''b'') = 1 for every nonempty interval [''a, b'']. Multiplying by ''ζ'' is analogous to integration.\n\nOne can show that ζ is invertible in the incidence algebra (with respect to the convolution defined above). (Generally, a member ''h'' of the incidence algebra is invertible if and only if ''h''(''x'', ''x'') is invertible for every ''x''.) The multiplicative inverse of the zeta function is the '''Möbius function''' ''μ''(''a, b''); every value of ''μ''(''a, b'') is an integral multiple of 1 in the base ring.\n\nThe Möbius function can also be defined inductively by the following relation:\n:<math>\n\\mu(x,y) = \\begin{cases}\n{}\\qquad 1 & \\text{if } x = y\\\\[6pt]\n\\displaystyle -\\!\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{z\\, :\\,  x\\,\\leq\\, z\\, <\\, y} \\mu(x,z) & \\text{for } x<y \\\\\n{}\\qquad 0 & \\text{otherwise }.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nMultiplying by ''μ'' is analogous to differentiation, and is called [[Möbius inversion]].\n\nThe square of the zeta function counts the number of elements in an interval:\n<blockquote><math>\\textstyle \n\\zeta^2(x,y)\\ =\\ \\sum_{z\\in [x,y]}\\zeta(x,z)\\,\\zeta(z,y) \n\\ =\\ \\sum_{z\\in [x,y]} 1 \\ =\\  \\#[x,y].</math></blockquote>\n\n==Examples==\n*'''Positive integers ordered by [[divisibility]]'''\n:The convolution associated to the incidence algebra for intervals [1, ''n''] becomes the [[Dirichlet convolution]], hence the Möbius function is ''μ''(''a, b'') = ''μ''(''b/a''), where the second \"''μ''\" is the classical [[Möbius function]] introduced into number theory in the 19th century.\n\n*'''Finite [[subset]]s of some set ''E'', ordered by inclusion'''\n:The Möbius function is\n::<math>\\mu(S,T)=(-1)^{\\left|T\\smallsetminus S\\right|}</math>\n:whenever ''S'' and ''T'' are finite subsets of ''E'' with ''S'' ⊆ ''T'', and Möbius inversion is called the [[principle of inclusion-exclusion]].\n:Geometrically, this is a [[hypercube]]: <math>2^E = \\{0,1\\}^E.</math>\n\n*'''Natural numbers with their usual order'''\n:The Möbius function is\n::<math>\\mu(x,y)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}\n1& \\text{if }y=x, \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if }y = x+1, \\\\\n0 & \\text{if }y>x+1,\n\\end{array}\\right.\n</math>\n:and Möbius inversion is called the (backwards) [[difference operator]].\n:Geometrically, this corresponds to the discrete [[number line]].\n:The convolution of functions in the incidence algebra corresponds to multiplication of [[formal power series]]: see the discussion of reduced incidence algebras below. The Möbius function corresponds to the sequence (1, &minus;1, 0, 0, 0, ... ) of coefficients of the formal power series 1 &minus; ''t'', and the zeta function corresponds to the sequence of coefficients (1, 1, 1, 1, ... ) of the formal power series <math>(1 - t)^{-1} = 1 + t + t^2 + t^3 + \\cdots</math>, which is inverse. The delta function in this incidence algebra similarly corresponds to the formal power series 1.\n\n*'''Finite sub-multisets of some [[multiset]] ''E'', ordered by inclusion'''\n:The above three examples can be unified and generalized by considering a multiset ''E,'' and finite sub-multisets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''E''. The Möbius function is\n::<math>\\mu(S,T)=\\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } T\\smallsetminus S \\text{ is a proper multiset (has repeated elements)}\\\\\n(-1)^{\\left|T\\smallsetminus S\\right|} & \\text{if } T\\smallsetminus S \\text{ is a set (has no repeated elements)}.\\end{cases}</math>\n:This generalizes the positive integers ordered by divisibility by a positive integer corresponding to its multiset of prime divisors with multiplicity, e.g., 12 corresponds to the multiset <math>\\{2,2,3\\}.</math>\n:This generalizes the natural numbers with their usual order by a natural number corresponding to a multiset of one underlying element and cardinality equal to that number, e.g., 3 corresponds to the multiset <math>\\{1,1,1\\}.</math>\n\n*'''Subgroups of a finite ''p''-group ''G'', ordered by inclusion'''\n:The Möbius function is\n::<math>\\mu_G(H_1,H_2)=(-1)^{k}p^{\\binom{k}{2}}</math> if <math>H_1</math> is a normal subgroup of <math>H_2</math> and <math>H_2/H_1 \\cong ({\\mathbf Z}/p{\\mathbf Z})^k</math>\n::and it is 0 otherwise.   This is a theorem of Weisner (1935).\n\n*'''Partitions of a set'''\n:Partially order the set of all [[partition of a set|partitions]] of a finite set by saying &sigma; &le; &tau; if &sigma; is a finer partition than &tau;.  In particular, let &tau; have <i>t</i> blocks which respectively split into ''s''<sub>1</sub>, . . . , ''s''<sub>''t''</sub> finer blocks of &sigma;, which has a total of ''s'' = ''s''<sub>1</sub> + &middot;&middot;&middot; + ''s''<sub>''t''</sub> blocks. Then the Möbius function is:\n\n::<math>\\mu(\\sigma,\\tau)=\n(-1)^{s-t}(s_1{-}1)!\\cdots (s_t{-}1)! \n</math>\n\n==Euler characteristic==\n\n{{Further|Euler characteristic}}\nA poset is ''bounded'' if it has smallest and largest elements, which we call 0 and 1 respectively (not to be confused with the 0 and 1 of the ring of scalars).  The '''Euler characteristic''' of a bounded finite poset is ''μ''(0,1).  The reason for this terminology is the following: If ''P'' has a 0 and 1, then ''μ''(0,1) is the reduced [[Euler characteristic]] of the simplicial complex whose faces are chains in ''P''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1}. This can be shown using Philip Hall's theorem, relating the value of ''μ''(0,1) to the number of chains of length i.\n\n==Reduced incidence algebras==\n\nThe '''reduced incidence algebra''' consists of functions which assign the same value to any two intervals which are equivalent in an appropriate sense, usually meaning isomorphic as posets. This is a subalgebra of the incidence algebra, and it clearly contains the incidence algebra's identity element and zeta function. Any element of the reduced incidence algebra that is invertible in the larger incidence algebra has its inverse in the reduced incidence algebra. Thus the Möbius function is also in the reduced incidence algebra. \n\nReduced incidence algebras were introduced by Doubillet, Rota, and Stanley to give a natural construction of various rings of [[generating function]]s.<ref>Peter Doubilet, Gian-Carlo Rota and Richard Stanley: ''On the Foundations of Combinatorics (IV): The Idea of Generating Function'', Berkeley Symp. on Math. Statist. and Prob. Proc. Sixth Berkeley Symp. on Math. Statist. and Prob., Vol. 2 (Univ. of Calif. Press, 1972), 267-318, [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bsmsp/1200514223 available online in open access]</ref>\n\n=== Natural numbers and ordinary generating functions ===\nFor the poset <math>(\\mathbb{N},\\leq),</math> the reduced incidence algebra consists of functions <math>f(a,b)</math> invariant under translation, <math>f(a+k,b+k) = f(a,b)</math> for all <math>k\\ge 0,</math> so as to have the same value on isomorphic intervals [a+k, b+k] and [a,b]. Let ''t'' denote the function with ''t''(a, a+1) = 1 and ''t''(a,b) = 0 otherwise, a kind of invariant delta function on isomorphism classes of intervals. Its powers in the incidence algebra are the other invariant delta functions ''t''<sup>n</sup>(a, a+n) = 1 and ''t''<sup>n</sup>(x,y) = 0 otherwise. These form a basis for the reduced incidence algebra, and we may write any invariant function as <math>\\textstyle f = \\sum_{n\\ge 0} f(0,n)t^n</math>. This notation makes clear the isomorphism between the reduced incidence algebra and the ring of formal power series <math>R[[t]]</math> over the scalars ''R,'' also known as the ring of ordinary [[generating function|generating functions]]. We may write the zeta function as <math>\\zeta=1+t+t^2+\\cdots = \\tfrac1{1-t},</math> the reciprocal of the Möbius function <math>\\mu=1-t.</math>\n\n=== Subset poset and exponential generating functions ===\nFor the Boolean poset of finite subsets <math>S\\subset\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}</math> ordered by inclusion <math>S\\subset T</math>, the reduced incidence algebra consists of invariant functions <math>f(S,T),</math> defined to have the same value on isomorphic intervals [S,T] and [S',T'] with |T\\S| = |T'\\S'|.  Again, let ''t'' denote the invariant delta function with ''t''(S,T) = 1 for |T\\S| = 1 and ''t''(S,T) = 0 otherwise. Its powers are:<blockquote><math>t^n(S,T)\\ =\\ \\sum t(T_0,T_1)\\,t(T_1,T_2)\\cdots t(T_{n-1},T_n) \n\\ =\\ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cl} n! & \\text{if }\\ |T{\\setminus}S| = n\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise,}\\end{array}\\right.</math></blockquote> where the sum is over all chains <math>S = T_0\\subset T_1\\subset\\cdots\\subset T_n=T,</math> and the only non-zero terms occur for saturated chains with <math>|T_{i}{\\setminus}T_{i-1}| = 1;</math> since these correspond to permutations of n, we get the unique non-zero value n!. Thus, the invariant delta functions are the divided powers <math>\\tfrac{t^n}{n!},</math> and we may write any invariant function as <math>\\textstyle f = \\sum_{n\\geq0} f(\\emptyset,[n])\\frac{t^n}{n!},</math> where [n] = {1, . . . , n}. This gives a natural isomorphism between the reduced incidence algebra and the ring of [[Generating function#Exponential generating function (EGF)|exponential generating functions]]. The zeta function is <math>\\textstyle \\zeta = \\sum_{n\\geq 0}\\frac{t^n}{n!} = \\exp(t),\n</math> with Möbius function: <blockquote><math>\\textstyle \\mu \\ =\\ \\frac1{\\zeta} \\ =\\ \\exp(-t) \\ = \\ \\sum_{n\\geq 0} (-1)^n \\frac{t^n}{n!}.</math></blockquote> Indeed, this computation with formal power series proves that <math>\\mu(S,T)=(-1)^{|T{\\setminus}S|}.</math> Many combinatorial counting sequences involving subsets or labeled objects can be interpreted in terms of the reduced incidence algebra, and [[Exponential formula|computed]] using exponential generating functions.\n\n=== Divisor poset and Dirichlet series ===\nConsider the poset ''D'' of positive integers ordered by [[divisibility]], denoted <math>a|b.</math> The reduced incidence algebra consists of functions <math>f(a,b)</math> invariant under multiplication, <math>f(ka,kb) = f(a,b)</math> for all <math>k\\ge 1.</math> (This multiplication equivalence of intervals is a much stronger relation than poset isomorphism: for prime p, the two-element intervals [1,p] are all inequivalent.) For an invariant function, ''f''(a,b) depends only on b/a, so a natural basis consists of invariant delta functions <math>\\delta_n</math>  defined by <math>\\delta_n(a,b) = 1</math> if b/a = n and 0 otherwise: any invariant function can be written <math>\\textstyle f \\ = \\ \\sum_{n\\geq 0} f(1,n)\\, \\delta_n.</math>\n\nThe product of two invariant delta functions is:\n<blockquote><math>(\\delta_n \\delta_m)(a,b)\\ =\\ \\sum_{a|c|b} \\delta_n(a,c)\\,\\delta_m(c,b)\\ = \\ \n\\delta_{nm}(a,b),</math></blockquote> \nsince the only non-zero term comes from  c = na  and  b = mc = nma. Thus, we get an isomorphism from the reduced incidence algebra to the ring of formal [[Dirichlet series]] by sending <math>\\delta_n</math> to <math>n^{-s}\\!,</math> so that ''f'' corresponds to <math>\\textstyle\\sum_{n\\geq 1} \\frac{f(1,n)}{n^s}.</math>\n\nThe incidence algebra zeta function ζ''<sub>D</sub>''(a,b) = 1 corresponds to the classical [[Riemann zeta function]] <math>\\zeta(s)=\\textstyle \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{n^s},</math> having reciprocal <math>\\textstyle \\frac{1}{\\zeta(s)}=\\textstyle \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{\\mu(n)}{n^s},</math> where <math>\\mu(n)=\\mu_D(1,n)</math> is the classical [[Möbius function]] of number theory. Many other [[Arithmetic function|arithmetic functions]] arise naturally within the reduced incidence algebra, and equivalently in terms of Dirichlet series. For example, the [[Divisor function|divisor function]] <math>\\sigma_0(n)</math> is the square of the zeta function, <math>\\sigma_0(n) = \\zeta^2\\!(1,n),</math> a special case of the above result that <math>\\zeta^2\\!(x,y)</math> counts the number of elements in the interval [x,y]; equivalenty, <math>\\textstyle\\zeta(s)^2 = \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{\\sigma_0(n)}{n^s}.</math>\n\nThe product structure of the divisor poset facilitates the computation of its Möbius function. [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic|Unique factorization into primes]] implies ''D'' is isomorphic to an infinite Cartesian product <math>\\mathbb{N}\\times \\mathbb{N}\\times \\cdots</math>, with the order given by coordinatewise comparison:  <math>n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots</math>, where <math>p_k</math> is the ''k''<sup>th</sup> prime,  corresponds to its sequence of exponents <math>(e_1,e_2,\\ldots).</math> Now the Möbius function of ''D'' is the product of the Möbius functions for the factor posets, computed above, giving the classical formula: \n<blockquote><math>\\mu(n)\\,=\\,\\mu_D(1,n)\\,=\\,\\prod_{k\\geq 1}\\mu_{\\mathbb{N}}(0,e_k)\n\\,=\\,\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}(-1)^d & \\text{ for } n \\text{ squarefree with } d \\text{ prime factors}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{array}\\right.</math>\n</blockquote>\nThe product structure also explains the classical [[Euler product]] for the zeta function. The zeta function of ''D'' corresponds to a Cartesian product of zeta functions of the factors, computed above as <math>\\tfrac{1}{1-t},</math> so that <math>\\textstyle \\zeta_D \\cong \\prod_{k\\geq 1}\\!\\frac{1}{1-t},</math> where the right side is a Cartesian product. Applying the isomorphism which sends ''t''   in the ''k''<sup>th</sup> factor to <math>p_k^{-s}</math>, we obtain the usual Euler product.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Graph algebra]]\n* [[Incidence coalgebra]]\n* [[Path algebra]]\n\n==Literature==\n\nIncidence algebras of locally finite posets were treated in a number of papers of [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] beginning in 1964, and by many later [[combinatorics|combinatorialists]].

Infima and suprema of [[real number]]s are common special cases that are important in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], and especially in [[Lebesgue integration]].  However, the general definitions remain valid in the more abstract setting of [[order theory]] where arbitrary partially ordered sets are considered.\n\nThe concepts of infimum and supremum are similar to [[minimum]] and [[maximum]], but are more useful in analysis because they better characterize special sets which may have ''no minimum or maximum''.  For instance, the [[positive real numbers]] ℝ<sup>+</sup> (not including 0) does not have a minimum, because any given element of ℝ<sup>+</sup> could simply be divided in half resulting in a smaller number that is still in ℝ<sup>+</sup>.  There is, however, exactly one infimum of the positive real numbers: 0, which is smaller than all the positive real numbers and greater than any other real number which could be used as a lower bound.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|supremum = least upper bound]]\nA ''lower bound'' of a subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) is an element ''a'' of ''P'' such that\n* ''a'' ≤ ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''S''.\nA lower bound ''a'' of ''S'' is called an ''infimum'' (or ''greatest lower bound'', or ''meet'') of ''S'' if\n* for all lower bounds ''y'' of ''S'' in ''P'', ''y'' ≤ ''a'' (''a'' is larger than or equal to any other lower bound).\n\nSimilarly, an ''upper bound'' of a subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) is an element ''b'' of ''P'' such that\n* ''b'' ≥ ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''S''.\nAn upper bound ''b'' of ''S'' is called a ''supremum'' (or ''least upper bound'', or ''join'') of ''S'' if\n* for all upper bounds ''z'' of ''S'' in ''P'', ''z'' ≥ ''b'' (''b'' is less than any other upper bound).\n\n== Existence and uniqueness ==\n\nInfima and suprema do not necessarily exist. Existence of an infimum of a subset ''S'' of ''P'' can fail if ''S'' has no lower bound at all, or if the set of lower bounds does not contain a greatest element. However, if an infimum or supremum does exist, it is unique.\n\nConsequently, partially ordered sets for which certain infima are known to exist become especially interesting. For instance, a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is a partially ordered set in which all {{em|nonempty finite}} subsets have both a supremum and an infimum, and a [[complete lattice]] is a partially ordered set in which {{em|all}} subsets have both a supremum and an infimum. More information on the various classes of partially ordered sets that arise from such considerations are found in the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]].\n\nIf the supremum of a subset ''S'' exists, it is unique.  If ''S'' contains a greatest element, then that element is the supremum; otherwise, the supremum does not belong to ''S'' (or does not exist).  Likewise, if the infimum exists, it is unique.  If ''S'' contains a least element, then that element is the infimum; otherwise, the infimum does not belong to ''S'' (or does not exist).\n\n== Relation to maximum and minimum elements ==\n\nThe infimum of a subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set ''P'', assuming it exists, does not necessarily belong to ''S''. If it does, it is a [[maximal element|minimum or least element]] of ''S''. Similarly, if the supremum of ''S'' belongs to ''S'', it is a [[maximal element|maximum or greatest element]] of ''S''.\n\nFor example, consider the set of negative real numbers (excluding zero).  This set has no greatest element, since for every element of the set, there is another, larger, element.  For instance, for any negative real number ''x'', there is another negative real number <math>\\tfrac{x}{2}</math>, which is greater. On the other hand, every real number greater than or equal to zero is certainly an upper bound on this set.  Hence, 0 is the least upper bound of the negative reals, so the supremum is 0. This set has a supremum but no greatest element.\n\nHowever, the definition of [[maximal element|maximal and minimal elements]] is more general. In particular, a set can have many maximal and minimal elements, whereas infima and suprema are unique.\n\nWhereas maxima and minima must be members of the subset that is under consideration, the infimum and supremum of a subset need not be members of that subset themselves.  \n\n=== Minimal upper bounds ===\nFinally, a partially ordered set may have many minimal upper bounds without having a least upper bound. Minimal upper bounds are those upper bounds for which there is no strictly smaller element that also is an upper bound. This does not say that each minimal upper bound is smaller than all other upper bounds, it merely is not greater. The distinction between \"minimal\" and \"least\" is only possible when the given order is not a [[totally ordered set|total]] one. In a totally ordered set, like the real numbers, the concepts are the same.\n\nAs an example, let ''S'' be the set of all finite subsets of natural numbers and consider the partially ordered set obtained by taking all sets from ''S'' together with the set of [[integer]]s ℤ and the set of positive real numbers ℝ<sup>+</sup>, ordered by subset inclusion as above. Then clearly both ℤ and ℝ<sup>+</sup> are greater than all finite sets of natural numbers. Yet, neither is ℝ<sup>+</sup> smaller than ℤ nor is the converse true: both sets are minimal upper bounds but none is a supremum.\n\n=== Least-upper-bound property ===\n{{main|Least-upper-bound property}}\n\nThe ''least-upper-bound property'' is an example of the aforementioned [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]] which is typical for the set of real numbers. This property is sometimes called ''Dedekind completeness''.\n\nIf an ordered set ''S'' has the property that every nonempty subset of ''S'' having an upper bound also has a least upper bound, then ''S'' is said to have the least-upper-bound property.  As noted above, the set ℝ of all real numbers has the least-upper-bound property.  Similarly, the set ℤ of integers has the least-upper-bound property; if ''S'' is a nonempty subset of ℤ and there is some number ''n'' such that every element ''s'' of ''S'' is less than or equal to ''n'', then there is a least upper bound ''u'' for ''S'', an integer that is an upper bound for ''S'' and is less than or equal to every other upper bound for ''S''. A [[well-order]]ed set also has the least-upper-bound property, and the empty subset has also a least upper bound: the minimum of the whole set.\n\nAn example of a set that ''lacks'' the least-upper-bound property is ℚ, the set of rational numbers.  Let ''S'' be the set of all rational numbers ''q''  such that ''q''<sup>2</sup> < 2. Then ''S'' has an upper bound (1000, for example, or 6) but no least upper bound in ℚ: If we suppose ''p'' ∈ ℚ is the least upper bound, a contradiction is immediately deduced because between any two reals ''x'' and ''y'' (including [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] and ''p'') there exists some rational ''p''′, which itself would have to be the least upper bound (if ''p'' > {{sqrt|2}}) or a member of ''S'' greater than ''p'' (if ''p'' < {{sqrt|2}}). Another example is the [[hyperreals]]; there is no least upper bound of the set of positive infinitesimals.\n\nThere is a corresponding 'greatest-lower-bound property'; an ordered set possesses the greatest-lower-bound property if and only if it also possesses the least-upper-bound property; the least-upper-bound of the set of lower bounds of a set is the greatest-lower-bound, and the greatest-lower-bound of the set of upper bounds of a set is the least-upper-bound of the set.\n\nIf in a partially ordered set ''P'' every bounded subset has a supremum, this applies also, for any set ''X'', in the function space containing all functions from ''X'' to ''P'', where ''f'' ≤ ''g'' if and only if ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. For example, it applies for real functions, and, since these can be considered special cases of functions, for real ''n''-tuples and sequences of real numbers.\n\nThe [[least-upper-bound property]] is an indicator of the suprema.\n\n== Infima and suprema of real numbers ==\n\nIn [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], infima and suprema of subsets ''S'' of the [[real numbers]] are particularly important. For instance, the negative [[real number]]s do not have a greatest element, and their supremum is 0 (which is not a negative real number).<ref name=BabyRudin />\nThe [[completeness of the real numbers]] implies (and is equivalent to) that any bounded nonempty subset ''S'' of the real numbers has an infimum and a supremum. If ''S'' is not bounded below, one often formally writes inf(''S'') = −∞. If ''S'' is [[empty set|empty]], one writes inf(''S'') = +∞.\n\n=== Properties ===\nLet ''A'', ''B'' ⊆ ℝ and suppose the infima and suprema of these sets exist.  Define ''λA'' = { ''λx'' : ''x'' ∈ ''A'' }, ''A'' + ''B'' = { ''x'' + ''y'' : ''x'' ∈ ''A'', ''y'' ∈ ''B'' }, and ''AB'' = { ''xy'' : ''x'' ∈ ''A'', ''y'' ∈ B }.\n* ''p'' = inf ''A'' if and only if for every ''ε'' > 0 there is an ''x'' ∈ ''A'' with ''x'' < ''p'' + ''ε'', and ''x'' ≥ ''p'' for every ''x'' ∈ ''A''.\n* ''p'' = sup ''A'' if and only if for every ''ε'' > 0 there is an ''x'' ∈ ''A'' with ''x'' > ''p'' − ''ε'', and ''x'' ≤ ''p'' for every ''x'' ∈ ''A''.\n* If ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' then inf ''A'' ≥ inf ''B'' and sup ''A'' ≤ sup ''B''.\n* If ''λ'' ≥ 0, then inf ''λA'' = ''λ'' inf ''A'' and sup ''λA'' = ''λ'' sup ''A''.\n* If ''λ'' < 0, then inf ''λA'' = ''λ'' sup ''A'' and sup ''λA'' = ''λ'' inf ''A''.\n* inf ''A'' + ''B'' = inf ''A'' + inf ''B''; similarly for suprema.\n* If ''A'', ''B'' are sets of ''positive'' real numbers then inf ''AB'' = inf ''A'' · inf ''B''; similarly for suprema.<ref = \"zakon\">{{cite book |title=Mathematical Analysis I |first=Elias |last=Zakon |pages=39–42 |publisher=Trillia Group |date=2004  |url=http://www.trillia.com/zakon-analysisI.html}}</ref>\n\n== Duality ==\n\nIf one denotes by ''P''<sup>op</sup> the partially-ordered set ''P'' with the opposite order relation, i.e.\n* ''x'' ≤ ''y'' in ''P''<sup>op</sup> if and only if ''x'' ≥ ''y'' in ''P'',\nthen infimum of a subset ''S'' in ''P'' equals the supremum of ''S'' in ''P''<sup>op</sup> and vice versa.\n\nFor subsets of the real numbers, another kind of duality holds: inf ''S'' = −sup(−''S''), where −''S'' = { −''s'' | ''s'' ∈ ''S'' }.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Infima ===\n\n*The infimum of the set of numbers {{nowrap|{2,3,4}}} is 2. The number 1 is a lower bound, but not the greatest lower bound, and hence not the infimum.\n*More generally, if a set has a smallest element, then the smallest element is the infimum for the set.

[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] gives a lucid account of infinite divisibility in the first few pages of his ''Atomism and its Critics''. There he shows how infinite divisibility involves the idea that there is some [[extended item]], such as an apple, which can be divided infinitely many times, where one never divides down to point, or to atoms of any sort. Many professional philosophers{{who|date=September 2012}} claim that infinite divisibility involves either a collection of ''an infinite number of items'' (since there are infinite divisions, there must be an infinite collection of objects), or (more rarely), ''point-sized items'', or both. Pyle states that the mathematics of infinitely divisible extensions involve neither of these — that there are infinite divisions, but only finite collections of objects and they never are divided down to point extension-less items.\n\nZeno [[Zeno's paradoxes#Arrow paradox|questioned]] how an arrow can move if at one moment it is here and motionless and at a later moment be somewhere else and motionless, like a motion picture.\n{{quote|Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle}}</ref>|Aristotle|''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' VI:9, 239b5}}\nIn reference to Zeno's paradox of the arrow in flight, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] writes that \"an infinite number of acts of becoming may take place in a finite time if each subsequent act is smaller in a convergent series\":<ref name=\"Ross1983\" />\n{{quote|The argument, so far as it is valid, elicits a contradiction from the two premises: (i) that in a becoming something (''res vera'') becomes, and (ii) that every act of becoming is divisible into earlier and later sections which are themselves acts of becoming. Consider, for example, an act of becoming during one second. The act is divisible into two acts, one during the earlier half of the second, the other during the later half of the second. Thus that which becomes during the whole second presupposes that which becomes during the first half-second. Analogously, that which becomes during the first half-second presupposes that which becomes during the first quarter-second, and so on indefinitely. Thus if we consider the process of becoming up to the beginning of the second in question, and ask what then becomes, no answer can be given. For, whatever creature we indicate presupposes an earlier creature which became after the beginning of the second and antecedently to the indicated creature. Therefore there is nothing which becomes, so as to effect a transition into the second in question.<ref name=\"Ross1983\">{{cite book |first=S.D. |last=Ross |year=1983 |title=Perspective in Whitehead's Metaphysics |series=Suny Series in Systematic Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-87395-658-1 |lccn=82008332 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exbYBj8aO8QC&pg=PA182 |pages=182–183}}</ref>|A.N. Whitehead|''[[Process and Reality]]''}}\n\n==In physics==\n\nUntil the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]], no distinction was made between the question of whether matter is infinitely divisible and the question of whether matter can be ''cut'' into smaller parts [[ad infinitum]].\n\nAs a result, the Greek word ''átomos'' (''ἄτομος''), which literally means \"uncuttable\", is usually translated as \"indivisible\". Whereas the modern atom is indeed divisible, it actually is uncuttable: there is no [[Partition of a set|partition]] of space such that its parts correspond to material parts of the atom. In other words, the quantum-mechanical description of matter no longer conforms to the cookie cutter paradigm.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=quant-ph/0009001v2 |title=Quantum Mechanics and the Cookie Cutter Paradigm|author=Ulrich Mohrhoff|year=2000}}</ref> This casts fresh light on the ancient [[Logic|conundrum]] of the divisibility of matter. The multiplicity of a material object&mdash;the number of its parts&mdash;depends on the existence, not of delimiting surfaces, but of internal spatial relations (relative positions between parts), and these lack determinate values. According to the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the particles that make up an atom&mdash;[[quark]]s and [[electron]]s&mdash;are [[point particle]]s: they do not take up space. What makes an atom nevertheless take up space is ''not'' any spatially extended \"stuff\" that \"occupies space\", and that might be cut into smaller and smaller pieces, ''but'' the [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminacy]] of its internal spatial relations.\n\nPhysical space is often regarded as infinitely divisible: it is thought that any region in space, no matter how small, could be further split. [[Time]] is similarly considered as infinitely divisible.\n\nHowever, the pioneering work of [[Max Planck]] (1858&ndash;1947) in the field of quantum physics suggests that there is, in fact, a minimum distance (now called the [[Planck length]], 1.616229(38)×10<sup>−35</sup> metres) and therefore a minimum time interval (the amount of time which light takes to traverse that distance in a vacuum, 5.39116(13)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>&minus;44</sup> seconds, known as the [[Planck time]]) smaller than which meaningful ''measurement'' is impossible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==In economics==\n\nOne [[dollar]], or one [[euro]], is divided into 100 cents; one can only pay in increments of a cent. It is quite commonplace for prices of some commodities such as gasoline to be in increments of a tenth of a cent per gallon or per litre. If gasoline costs $3.979 per gallon and one buys 10 gallons, then the \"extra\" 9/10 of a cent comes to ten times that: an \"extra\" 9 cents, so the cent in that case gets paid. Money is infinitely divisible in the sense that it is based upon the real number system. However, modern day coins are not divisible (in the past some coins were weighed with each transaction, and were considered divisible with no particular limit in mind). There is a point of precision in each transaction that is useless because such small amounts of money are insignificant to humans. The more the price is multiplied the more the precision could matter. For example, when buying a million shares of stock, the buyer and seller might be interested in a tenth of a cent price difference, but it's only a choice. Everything else in business measurement and choice is similarly divisible to the degree that the parties are interested. For example, financial reports may be reported annually, quarterly, or monthly. Some business managers run cash-flow reports more than once per day.\n\nAlthough [[time]] may be infinitely divisible, data on securities prices are reported at discrete times.  For example, if one looks at records of stock prices in the 1920s, one may find the prices at the end of each day, but perhaps not at three-hundredths of a second after 12:47 PM. A new method, however, theoretically, could report at double the rate, which would not prevent further increases of velocity of reporting.  Perhaps paradoxically, technical mathematics applied to financial markets is often simpler if infinitely divisible time is used as an approximation. Even in those cases, a precision is chosen with which to work, and measurements are rounded to that approximation. In terms of human interaction, money and time are divisible, but only to the point where further division is not of value, which point cannot be determined exactly.\n\n==In order theory==\n\nTo say that the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational number]]s is infinitely divisible (i.e. order theoretically [[Dense set|dense]]) means that between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.  By contrast, the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[integer]]s is not infinitely divisible.\n\nInfinite divisibility does not imply gap-less-ness: the rationals do not enjoy the [[supremum|least upper bound property]].  That means that if one were to [[partition of a set|partition]] the rationals into two non-empty sets ''A'' and ''B'' where ''A'' contains all rationals less than some irrational number (''[[Pi|π]]'', say) and ''B'' all rationals greater than it, then ''A'' has no largest member and ''B'' has no smallest member.  The field of [[real number]]s, by contrast, is both infinitely divisible and gapless.  Any [[total order|linearly ordered set]] that is infinitely divisible and gapless, and has more than one member, is [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]].  For a proof, see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]].  Infinite divisibility alone implies infiniteness but not uncountability, as the rational numbers exemplify.\n\n==In probability distributions==\n\n{{Main|infinite divisibility (probability)}}\n\nTo say that a [[probability distribution]] ''F'' on the real line is '''infinitely divisible''' means that if ''X'' is any [[random variable]] whose distribution is ''F'', then for every positive integer ''n'' there exist ''n'' [[statistical independence|independent]] [[identically distributed]] random variables ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> whose sum is equal in distribution to ''X'' (those ''n'' other random variables do not usually have the same probability distribution as ''X'').\n\nThe [[Poisson distribution]], the stuttering Poisson distribution,<ref>{{Cite journal | first= Zhang | last= Huiming |author2=[[Lili Chu]] |author3=[[Yu Diao]]|title=Some Properties of the Generalized Stuttering Poisson Distribution and its Applications |journal=[[Studies in Mathematical Sciences]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2012|pages=11–26 |doi=10.3968/j.sms.1923845220120501.Z0697}}</ref> the [[negative binomial distribution]], and the [[Gamma distribution]] are examples of infinitely divisible distributions — as are the [[normal distribution]], [[Cauchy distribution]] and all other members of the [[stable distribution]] family. The [[skew normal distribution|skew-normal distribution]] is an example of a non-infinitely divisible distribution. (See Domínguez-Molina and Rocha Arteaga (2007).)\n\nEvery infinitely divisible probability distribution corresponds in a natural way to a [[Lévy process]], i.e., a [[stochastic process]] { ''X<sub>t</sub>'' : ''t'' ≥ 0 } with stationary independent increments (''stationary'' means that for ''s'' < ''t'', the [[probability distribution]] of ''X''<sub>''t''</sub> &minus; ''X''<sub>''s''</sub> depends only on ''t'' &minus; ''s''; ''independent increments'' means that that difference is [[statistical independence|independent]] of the corresponding difference on any interval not overlapping with [''s'', ''t''], and similarly for any finite number of intervals).\n\nThis concept of infinite divisibility of probability distributions was introduced in 1929 by [[Bruno de Finetti]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indecomposable distribution]]\n*[[Salami slicing]]\n*[[Zeno's paradoxes]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n* Domínguez-Molina, J.A.; Rocha-Arteaga, A.

All numbers greater than ''x'' and less than ''x'' + ''a'' fall within that open interval.]]In [[mathematics]], a ('''real''') '''interval''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real number]]s with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set.  For example, the set of all numbers {{mvar|x}} satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1}} is an interval which contains {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}, as well as all numbers between them. Other examples of intervals are the set of all real numbers <math>\\R</math>, the set of all negative real numbers, and the [[empty set]].\n\nReal intervals play an important role in the theory of [[Integral|integration]], because they are the simplest sets whose \"size\" or \"measure\" or \"length\" is easy to define.  The concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers, leading to the [[Borel measure]] and eventually to the [[Lebesgue measure]].\n\nIntervals are central to [[interval arithmetic]], a general [[numerical method|numerical computing]] technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas, even in the presence of uncertainties, mathematical approximations, and [[rounding error|arithmetic roundoff]].\n\nIntervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary [[total order|totally ordered]] set, such as [[integers]] or [[rational numbers]]. The notation of integer intervals is considered [[#Integer intervals|in the special section below]].\n\n==Terminology==\nAn '''open interval''' does not include its endpoints, and is indicated with parentheses. For example, {{open-open|0,1}} means greater than {{math|0}} and less than {{math|1}}. A '''closed interval''' is an interval which includes all its limit points, and is denoted with square brackets. For example, {{closed-closed|0,1}} means greater than or equal to {{math|0}} and less than or equal to {{math|1}}. A '''half-open interval''' includes only one of its endpoints, and is denoted by mixing the notations for open and closed intervals. {{open-closed|0,1}} means greater than {{math|0}} and less than or equal to {{math|1}}, while {{closed-open|0,1}} means greater than or equal to {{math|0}} and less than {{math|1}}.\n\nA '''degenerate interval''' is any [[singleton set|set consisting of a single real number]].  Some authors include the empty set in this definition.  A real interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be  '''proper''', and has infinitely many elements.\n\nAn interval is said to be '''left-bounded''' or '''right-bounded''' if there is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements.  An interval is said to be '''bounded''' if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be '''unbounded''' otherwise.  Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be '''half-bounded'''. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends.  Bounded intervals are also commonly known as '''finite intervals'''.\n\nBounded intervals are  [[bounded set]]s, in the sense that their [[diameter]] (which is equal to the [[absolute difference]] between the endpoints) is finite.  The diameter may be called the '''length''', '''width''', '''measure''', '''range''', or '''size''' of the interval.  The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as {{math|+∞}}, and the size of the empty interval may be defined as {{math|0}} or left undefined.\n\nThe '''centre''' ([[midpoint]]) of bounded interval with endpoints {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is {{math|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, and its '''radius''' is the half-length {{math|{{mabs|''a'' − ''b''}}/2}}.  These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals.\n\nAn interval is said to be '''left-open''' if and only if it contains no [[minimum]] (an element that is smaller than all other elements);  '''right-open''' if it contains no [[maximum]]; and '''open''' if it has both properties.  The interval {{math|{{closed-open|0,1}} {{=}} {{mset|''x'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' &lt; 1}}}}, for example, is left-closed and right-open.  The empty set and the set of all reals are open intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, for example, is a right-open but not left-open interval. The open intervals coincide with the [[open set]]s of the real line in its standard [[point-set topology|topology]].\n\nAn interval is said to be '''left-closed''' if it has a minimum element, '''right-closed''' if it has a maximum, and simply '''closed''' if it has both.  These definitions are usually extended to include the empty set and to the (left- or right-) unbounded intervals, so that the closed intervals coincide with [[closed set]]s in that topology.\n\nThe '''interior''' of an interval {{mvar|I}} is the largest open interval that is contained in {{mvar|I}}; it is also the set of points in {{mvar|I}} which are not endpoints of {{mvar|I}}.  The '''closure''' of {{mvar|I}} is the smallest closed interval that contains {{mvar|I}}; which is also the set {{mvar|I}} augmented with its finite endpoints.\n\nFor any set {{mvar|X}} of real numbers, the '''interval enclosure''' or '''interval span''' of {{mvar|X}} is the unique interval that contains {{mvar|X}} and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains {{mvar|X}}.\n\n=== Note on conflicting terminology ===\nThe terms '''''segment''''' and '''''interval''''' have been employed in the literature in two essentially opposite ways, resulting in ambiguity when these terms are used.  The ''Encyclopedia of Mathematics''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|title=Interval and segment - Encyclopedia of Mathematics|website=www.encyclopediaofmath.org|access-date=2016-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226211146/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|archivedate=2014-12-26|df=}}</ref> defines ''interval'' (without a qualifier) to exclude both endpoints (i.e., open interval) and ''segment'' to include both endpoints (i.e., closed interval), while Rudin's ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=31|quote=|via=}}</ref> calls sets of the form [''a'', ''b''] ''intervals'' and sets of the form (''a'', ''b'') ''segments'' throughout.  These terms tend to appear in older works; modern texts increasingly favor the term ''interval'' (qualified by ''open'', ''closed'', or ''half-open''), regardless of whether endpoints are included.\n\n==Notations for intervals==\nThe interval of numbers between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, is often denoted {{closed-closed|''a'', ''b''}}. The two numbers are called the ''endpoints'' of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a [[decimal comma]], a [[semicolon]] may be used as a separator, to avoid ambiguity.\n\n===Including or excluding endpoints===\nTo indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in [[International standard]] [[ISO 31-11]].  Thus, in [[set builder notation]],\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n{\\color{RedOrange}(} a,b{\\color{RedOrange})}  = \\mathopen{\\color{RedOrange}]}a,b\\mathclose{\\color{RedOrange}[} &= \\{x\\in\\R\\mid a{\\color{RedOrange}<}x{\\color{RedOrange}<}b\\}, \\\\{}\n{\\color{OliveGreen}[}a,b{\\color{RedOrange})}  = \\mathopen{\\color{OliveGreen}[} a,b\\mathclose{\\color{RedOrange}[} &= \\{x\\in\\R\\mid a{\\color{OliveGreen}\\le} x{\\color{RedOrange}<}b\\}, \\\\{}\n{\\color{RedOrange}(} a,b{\\color{OliveGreen}]} = \\mathopen{\\color{RedOrange}]}a,b\\mathclose{\\color{OliveGreen}]} &= \\{x\\in\\R\\mid a{\\color{RedOrange}<}x{\\color{OliveGreen}\\le} b\\}, \\\\{}\n{\\color{OliveGreen}[}a,b{\\color{OliveGreen}]} = \\mathopen{\\color{OliveGreen}[} a,b\\mathclose{\\color{OliveGreen}]} &= \\{x\\in\\R\\mid a{\\color{OliveGreen}\\le} x{\\color{OliveGreen}\\le} b\\}.\n\\end{align} </math>\nNote that {{open-open|''a'', ''a''}}, {{closed-open|''a'', ''a''}}, and {{open-closed|''a'', ''a''}} each represents the [[empty set]], whereas {{closed-closed|''a'', ''a''}} denotes the set&nbsp;{{math|{''a''}{{null}}}}.  When {{math|''a'' > ''b''}}, all four notations are usually taken to represent the empty set.\n\nBoth notations may overlap with other uses of parentheses and brackets in mathematics.  For instance, the notation {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is often used to denote an [[tuple|ordered pair]] in set theory, the [[coordinates]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] in [[analytic geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], or (sometimes) a [[complex number]] in [[algebra]].  That is why [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] introduced the notation {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the open interval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/193|title=Why is American and French notation different for open intervals (x, y) vs. ]x, y[?|author=|date=|website=hsm.stackexchange.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The notation {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} too is occasionally used for ordered pairs, especially in [[computer science]].\n\nSome authors use {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the complement of the interval&nbsp;{{open-open|''a'', ''b''}}; namely, the set of all real numbers that are either less than or equal to {{mvar|a}}, or greater than or equal to {{mvar|b}}.\n\n===Infinite endpoints===\nIn some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the [[extended real number line|extended real numbers]], the set of all real numbers augmented with {{math|−∞}} and {{math|+∞}}.\n\nIn this interpretation, the notations {{closed-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{open-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{closed-closed|''a'', +∞}} , and {{closed-open|''a'', +∞}} are all meaningful and distinct.  In particular, {{open-open|−∞, +∞}} denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while {{closed-closed|−∞, +∞}} denotes the extended reals. \n\nEven in the context of the ordinary reals, one may use an [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] endpoint to indicate that there is no bound in that direction.  For example, {{open-open|0, +∞}} is the set of [[positive real numbers]] also written ℝ<sup>+</sup>. The context affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval {{open-open|−∞, +∞}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;<math>\\R</math> is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals.\n\n===Integer intervals===\nThe notation {{closed-closed|''a'' .. ''b''}} when {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are [[integer]]s, or {{math|{''a'' .. ''b''}{{null}}}}, or just {{math|''a'' .. ''b''}} is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all ''integers'' between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including both.  This notation is used in some [[programming language]]s; in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], for example, it is used to formally define a subrange type, most frequently used to specify lower and upper bounds of valid [[Indexed family|indices]] of an [[Array data type|array]].\n\nAn integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint.  Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing {{math|''a'' .. ''b'' − 1}} ,  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b''}} , or  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b'' − 1}}.  Alternate-bracket notations like {{closed-open|''a'' .. ''b''}} or {{math|[''a'' .. ''b''[}} are rarely used for integer intervals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Classification of intervals==\nThe intervals of real numbers can be classified into the eleven different types listed below{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers, and <math>a < b</math>:\n\n: Empty: <math>[b,a] = (b,a) = [b,a) = (b,a] = (a,a) = [a,a) = (a,a] = \\{ \\} = \\emptyset</math>\n: Degenerate: <math>[a,a] = \\{a\\}</math>\n: Proper and bounded:\n:: Open: <math>(a,b) = \\{x\\mid a < x < b\\}</math>\n:: Closed: <math>[a,b] = \\{x\\mid a \\leq x \\leq b\\}</math>\n:: Left-closed, right-open: <math>[a,b) = \\{x\\mid a \\leq x < b\\}</math>\n:: Left-open, right-closed: <math>(a,b] = \\{x\\mid a < x \\leq b\\}</math>\n: Left-bounded and right-unbounded:\n:: Left-open: <math>(a,+\\infty) = \\{x\\mid x > a\\}</math>\n:: Left-closed: <math>[a,+\\infty) = \\{x\\mid x \\geq a\\}</math>\n: Left-unbounded and right-bounded:\n:: Right-open: <math>(-\\infty,b) = \\{x\\mid x < b\\}</math>\n:: Right-closed: <math>(-\\infty,b] = \\{x\\mid x \\leq b\\}</math>\n: Unbounded at both ends (simultaneously open and closed):  <math>(-\\infty,+\\infty) = \\R</math>:\n\n==Properties of intervals==\nThe intervals are precisely the [[connectedness|connected]] subsets of <math>\\R</math>. It follows that the image of an interval by any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] function is also an interval. This is one formulation of the [[intermediate value theorem]].\n\nThe intervals are also the [[convex set|convex subset]]s of <math>\\R</math>.  The interval enclosure of a subset <math>X\\subseteq \\R</math> is also the [[convex hull]] of <math>X</math>.\n\nThe intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval.  The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other (e.g., <math>(a,b) \\cup [b,c] = (a,c]</math>).\n\nIf <math>\\R</math> is viewed as a [[metric space]], its [[open ball]]s are the open bounded sets&nbsp;{{open-open|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}, and its [[closed ball]]s are the closed bounded sets&nbsp;{{closed-closed|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}.\n\nAny element&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} of an interval&nbsp;{{mvar|I}} defines a partition of&nbsp;{{mvar|I}} into three disjoint intervals {{mvar|I}}<sub>1</sub>, {{mvar|I}}<sub>2</sub>, {{mvar|I}}<sub>3</sub>: respectively, the elements of&nbsp;{{mvar|I}} that are less than&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, the singleton&nbsp;<math>[x,x] = \\{x\\}</math>, and the elements that are greater than&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.  The parts {{mvar|I}}<sub>1</sub> and {{mvar|I}}<sub>3</sub> are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors) if and only if {{mvar|x}} is in the interior of&nbsp;{{mvar|I}}.  This is an interval version of the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy principle]].\n\n==Dyadic intervals==\n\nA ''dyadic interval'' is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{j}{2^n}</math> and <math  display=\"inline\">\\frac{j+1}{2^n}</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">j</math> and <math display=\"inline\">n</math> are integers.   Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval.\n\nDyadic intervals have the following properties:\n\n* The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two.\n* Each dyadic interval is contained in exactly one dyadic interval of twice the length.\n* Each dyadic interval is spanned by two dyadic intervals of half the length.\n* If two open dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them is a subset of the other.\n\nThe dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite [[binary tree]].\n\nDyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including [[adaptive mesh refinement]], [[multigrid methods]] and [[wavelet|wavelet analysis]]. Another way to represent such a structure is [[p-adic analysis]] (for {{math|1=''p'' = 2}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozyrev |first1=Sergey |year=2002 |title=Wavelet theory as {{mvar|p}}-adic spectral analysis |journal=[[Izvestiya: Mathematics|Izvestiya RAN.

The '''faces''' of <math>I</math> comprise <math>I</math> itself and all faces of its facets.  The '''corners''' of <math>I</math> are the faces that consist of a single point of <math>\\R^n</math>.\n\n===Complex intervals===\nIntervals of [[complex number]]s can be defined as regions of the [[complex plane]], either [[rectangle|rectangular]] or [[disk (mathematics)|circular]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtqk6WgttzcC Complex interval arithmetic and its applications], Miodrag Petković, Ljiljana Petković, Wiley-VCH, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-527-40134-5}}</ref>\n\n==Topological algebra==\nIntervals can be associated with points of the plane and hence regions of intervals can be associated with [[region (mathematical analysis)|region]]s of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair (''x,y'') taken from the [[direct product]] R × R of real numbers with itself. Often it is assumed that ''y'' > ''x''. For purposes of [[mathematical structure]], this restriction is discarded,<ref>Kaj Madsen (1979) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/586220.pdf Review of \"Interval analysis in the extended interval space\" by Edgar Kaucher]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [[Mathematical Reviews]]</ref> and \"reversed intervals\" where ''y'' &minus; ''x'' < 0 are allowed. Then the collection of all intervals [''x,y''] can be identified with the [[topological ring]] formed by the [[direct sum of modules#Direct sum of algebras|direct sum]] of R with itself where addition and multiplication are defined component-wise.\n\nThe direct sum algebra <math>( R \\oplus R, +, \\times)</math> has two [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, { [''x'',0] : ''x'' ∈ R } and { [0,''y''] : ''y'' ∈ R }. The [[identity element]] of this algebra is the condensed interval [1,1]. If interval [''x,y''] is not in one of the ideals, then it has [[multiplicative inverse]] [1/''x'', 1/''y'']. Endowed with the usual [[topology]], the algebra of intervals forms a [[topological ring]].  The [[group of units]] of this ring consists of four [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]s determined by the axes, or ideals in this case. The [[identity component]] of this group is quadrant I.\n\nEvery interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its [[midpoint]].  In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of \"balanced intervals\" [''x'', &minus;''x''] is used along with the axis of intervals [''x,x''] that reduce to a point.\nInstead of the direct sum <math>R \\oplus R</math>, the ring of intervals has been identified<ref>[[D. H. Lehmer]] (1956) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/81372.pdf Review of \"Calculus of Approximations\"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from Mathematical Reviews</ref> with the [[split-complex number]] plane by M. Warmus and [[D. H. Lehmer]] through the identification\n: ''z'' = (''x'' + ''y'')/2 + j (''x'' &minus; ''y'')/2.\nThis linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a [[ring isomorphism]], provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality]]\n*[[Interval graph]]\n*[[Interval finite element]]\n*[[Interval (statistics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* T.

If <math>i < j</math> and <math>\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)</math>, either the pair of places <math>(i, j)</math>{{sfn|Aigner|2007|pp=27}}{{sfn|Comtet|1974|pp=237}} or the pair of elements <math>\\bigl(\\pi(i), \\pi(j)\\bigr)</math>{{sfn|Knuth|1973|pp=11}}{{sfn|Pemmaraju|Skiena|2003|pp=69}}{{sfn|Vitter|Flajolet|1990|pp=459}} is called an '''inversion''' of <math>\\pi</math>.\n\nThe inversion is usually defined for permutations, but may also be defined for sequences:<br>\nLet <math>S</math> be a [[sequence]] (or [[multiset]] permutation{{sfn|Bóna|2012|pp=57}}). If <math>i < j</math> and <math>S(i) > S(j)</math>, either the pair of places <math>(i, j)</math>{{sfn|Bóna|2012|pp=57}}{{sfn|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001|pp=39}} or the pair of elements <math>\\bigl(S(i), S(j)\\bigr)</math>{{sfn|Barth|Mutzel|2004|pp=183}} is called an inversion of <math>S</math>.\n\nFor sequences inversions according to the element-based definition are not unique, because different pairs of places may have the same pair of values.\n\nThe '''inversion set''' is the set of all inversions. A permutation's inversion set according to the place-based definition is that of the [[Permutation#Product and inverse|inverse]] permutation's inversion set according to the element-based definition, and vice versa,{{sfn|Gratzer|2016|pp=221}} just with the elements of the pairs exchanged.\n\n===Inversion number===\n\nThe '''inversion number''' is the cardinality of inversion set. It is a common measure of the sortedness of a permutation{{sfn|Vitter|Flajolet|1990|pp=459}} or sequence.{{sfn|Barth|Mutzel|2004|pp=183}}\n\nIt is the number of crossings in the arrow diagram of the permutation,{{sfn|Gratzer|2016|pp=221}} its [[Kendall tau distance]] from the identity permutation, and the sum of each of the inversion related vectors defined below.\n\nIt does not matter if the place-based or the element-based definition of inversion is used to define the inversion number, because a permutation and its inverse have the same number of inversions.\n\nOther measures of (pre-)sortedness include the minimum number of elements that can be deleted from the sequence to yield a fully sorted sequence, the number and lengths of sorted \"runs\" within the sequence, the Spearman footrule (sum of distances of each element from its sorted position), and the smallest number of exchanges needed to sort the sequence.{{sfn|Mahmoud|2000|pp=284}} Standard [[comparison sort]]ing algorithms can be adapted to compute the inversion number in time {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}}.\n\n===Inversion related vectors===\n\nThree similar vectors are in use that condense the inversions of a permutation into a vector that uniquely determines it. They are often called ''inversion vector'' or ''[[Lehmer code]]''. (A list of sources is found [[v:Inversion (discrete mathematics)#Sources|here]].)\n\nThis article uses the term ''inversion vector'' (<math>v</math>) like [[Wolfram Mathematica|Wolfram]].<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Inversion Vector}}</ref> The remaining two vectors are sometimes called ''left'' and ''right inversion vector'', but to avoid confusion with the inversion vector this article calls them  ''left inversion count'' (<math>l</math>) and ''right inversion count'' (<math>r</math>). Interpreted as a [[factorial number system|factorial number]] the left inversion count gives the permutations reverse colexicographic,<ref>Reverse colex order of finitary permutations {{OEIS|A055089}}</ref> and the right inversion count gives the lexicographic index.\n\n[[File:Inversion example; Rothe 1.svg|thumb|Rothe diagram]]\n'''Inversion vector <math>v</math>:'''<br>\nWith the ''element-based'' definition <math>v(i)</math> is the number of inversions whose ''smaller'' (right) component is <math>i</math>.{{sfn|Knuth|1973|pp=11}}\n:<math>v(i)</math> is the number of elements in <math>\\pi</math> greater than <math>i</math> before <math>i</math>.\n:<math>v(i) ~~=~~ \\# \\{ k \\mid k > i ~\\land~ \\pi^{-1}(k) < \\pi^{-1}(i) \\}</math>\n\n'''Left inversion count <math>l</math>:'''<br>\nWith the ''place-based'' definition <math>l(i)</math> is the number of inversions whose ''bigger'' (right) component is <math>i</math>.\n:<math>l(i)</math> is the number of elements in <math>\\pi</math> greater than <math>\\pi(i)</math> before <math>\\pi(i)</math>.\n:<math>l(i) ~~=~~ \\# \\left\\{ k \\mid k < i ~\\land~ \\pi(k) > \\pi(i) \\right\\}</math>\n\n'''Right inversion count <math>r</math>, often called ''[[Lehmer code]]'':'''<br>\nWith the ''place-based'' definition <math>r(i)</math> is the number of inversions whose ''smaller'' (left) component is <math>i</math>.\n:<math>r(i)</math> is the number of elements in <math>\\pi</math> smaller than <math>\\pi(i)</math> after <math>\\pi(i)</math>.\n:<math>r(i) ~~=~~ \\# \\{ k \\mid k > i ~\\land~ \\pi(k) < \\pi(i) \\}</math>\n\nBoth <math>v</math> and <math>r</math> can be found with the help of a '''Rothe diagram''', which is a permutation matrix with the 1s represented by dots, and an inversion (often represented by a cross) in every position that has a dot to the right and below it. <math>r(i)</math> is the sum of inversions in row <math>i</math> of the Rothe diagram, while <math>v(i)</math> is the sum of inversions in column <math>i</math>. The permutation matrix of the inverse is the transpose, therefore <math>v</math> of a permutation is <math>r</math> of its inverse, and vice versa.\n\n==Example: All permutations of four elements==\n[[File:2-element subsets of 4 elements; array, hexagonal.svg|thumb|The six possible inversions of a 4-element permutation]]\n\nThe following sortable table shows the 24 permutations of four elements with their place-based inversion sets, inversion related vectors and inversion numbers. (The small columns are reflections of the columns next to them, and can be used to sort them in [[colexicographic order]].)\n\nIt can be seen that <math>v</math> and <math>l</math> always have the same digits, and that <math>l</math> and <math>r</math> are both related to the place-based inversion set. The nontrivial elements of <math>l</math> are the sums of the descending diagonals of the shown triangle, and those of <math>r</math> are the sums of the ascending diagonals. (Pairs in descending diagonals have the right components 2, 3, 4 in common, while pairs in ascending diagonals have the left components 1, 2, 3 in common.)\n\nThe default order of the table is reverse colex order by <math>\\pi</math>, which is the same as colex order by <math>l</math>. Lex order by <math>\\pi</math> is the same as lex order by <math>r</math>.\n\n{| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;\"\n!bgcolor=\"#f2f2f2\"| 3-element permutations for comparison\n|-\n|\n{{3-el perm inversions}}\n|}\n\n{{4-el perm inversions}}\n\n==Weak order of permutations==\n[[File:Symmetric group 4; permutohedron 3D; numbers.svg|thumb|Permutohedron of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>4</sub>]]\nThe set of permutations on ''n'' items can be given the structure of a [[partial order]], called the '''weak order of permutations''', which forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].\n\nThe Hasse diagram of the inversion sets ordered by the [[subset]] relation forms the [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a [[permutohedron]].\n\nIf a permutation is assigned to each inversion set using the place-based definition, the resulting order of permutations is that of the permutohedron, where an edge corresponds to the swapping of two elements with consecutive values. This is the weak order of permutations. The identity is its minimum, and the permutation formed by reversing the identity is its maximum.\n\nIf a permutation were assigned to each inversion set using the element-based definition, the resulting order of permutations would be that of a [[Cayley graph]], where an edge corresponds to the swapping of two elements on consecutive places. This Cayley graph of the symmetric group is similar to its permutohedron, but with each permutation replaced by its inverse.\n\n== See also ==\n{{wikiversity|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n{{Commons category|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n* [[Factorial number system]]\n* [[Permutation graph]]\n* [[Permutation group#Transpositions, simple transpositions, inversions and sorting|Transpositions, simple transpositions, inversions and sorting]]\n* [[Damerau–Levenshtein distance]]\n* [[Parity of a permutation]]\n\n'''Sequences in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]:'''\n* [https://oeis.org/wiki/Index_to_OEIS:_Section_Fa#facbase Sequences related to factorial base representation]\n* Factorial numbers: {{OEIS link|A007623}} and {{OEIS link|A108731}}\n* Inversion numbers: {{OEIS link|A034968}}\n* Inversion sets of finite permutations interpreted as binary numbers: {{OEIS link|A211362}} &nbsp; (related permutation: {{OEIS link|A211363}})\n* Finite permutations that have only 0s and 1s in their inversion vectors: {{OEIS link|A059590}} &nbsp; (their inversion sets: {{OEIS link|A211364}})\n* Numbers of permutations of ''n'' elements with ''k'' inversions; Mahonian numbers: {{OEIS link|A008302}} &nbsp; (their row maxima; Kendall-Mann numbers: {{OEIS link|A000140}})\n* Number of connected labeled graphs with ''n'' edges and ''n'' nodes: {{OEIS link|A057500}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|4|refs=}}\n\n=== Source bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|1}}\n\n* {{cite book | ref = harv \n | last = Aigner | first = Martin \n | title = A course in enumeration \n | chapter = Word Representation\n | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 3642072534}}\n\n* {{cite journal |ref = harv\n | first1 = Wilhelm | last1 = Barth\n | first2 = Petra | last2 = Mutzel |author2-link = Petra Mutzel\n | title = Simple and Efficient Bilayer Cross Counting\n | journal = [[Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 179&ndash;194 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.7155/jgaa.00088}}\n\n* {{cite book |ref = harv\n | last = Bóna | first = Miklós | author-link = Miklós Bóna\n | title = Combinatorics of permutations \n | chapter = 2.2 Inversions in Permutations of Multisets\n | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, FL | year = 2012 | isbn = 1439850518 }}\n\n* {{cite book |ref = harv \n | last = Comtet | first = Louis\n | title = Advanced combinatorics; the art of finite and infinite expansions\n | chapter = 6.4 Inversions of a permutation of [n]\n | publisher = D.

To show that, we prove the following:\n\n:'''Lemma.''' If <math>L</math> is a dcpo with a least element, and <math>f: L \\to L</math> is Scott-continuous, then <math>f^n(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f^{n+1}(\\bot), n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0</math>\n\n:'''Proof.''' We use induction: \n:* Assume n = 0. Then <math>f^0(\\bot) = \\bot \\sqsubseteq f^1(\\bot),</math> since <math>\\bot</math> is the least element.\n:* Assume n > 0. Then we have to show that <math>f^n(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f^{n+1}(\\bot)</math>. By rearranging we get <math>f(f^{n-1}(\\bot)) \\sqsubseteq f(f^n(\\bot))</math>. By inductive assumption, we know that <math>f^{n-1}(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f^n(\\bot)</math> holds, and because f is monotone (property of Scott-continuous functions), the result holds as well.\n\nAs a corollary of the Lemma we have the following directed ω-chain:\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{M} = \\{ \\bot, f(\\bot), f(f(\\bot)), \\ldots\\}.</math>\n\nFrom the definition of a dcpo it follows that <math>\\mathbb{M}</math> has a supremum, call it <math>m.</math> What remains now is to show that <math>m</math> is the least fixed-point.\n\nFirst, we show that <math>m</math> is a fixed point, i.e. that <math>f(m) = m</math>. Because <math>f</math> is [[Scott continuity|Scott-continuous]], <math>f(\\sup(\\mathbb{M})) = \\sup(f(\\mathbb{M}))</math>, that is <math>f(m) = \\sup(f(\\mathbb{M}))</math>. Also, since <math>\\mathbb{M} = f(\\mathbb{M})\\cup\\{\\bot\\}</math> and because <math>\\bot</math> has no influence in determining the supremum we have: <math>\\sup(f(\\mathbb{M})) = \\sup(\\mathbb{M})</math>. It follows that <math>f(m) = m</math>, making <math>m</math> a fixed-point of <math>f</math>.\n\nThe proof that <math>m</math> is in fact the ''least'' fixed point can be done by showing that any element in <math>\\mathbb{M}</math> is smaller than any fixed-point of <math>f</math> (because by property of [[supremum]], if all elements of a set <math>D \\subseteq L</math> are smaller than an element of <math>L</math> then also <math>\\sup(D)</math> is smaller than that same element of <math>L</math>). This is done by induction: Assume <math>k</math> is some fixed-point of <math>f</math>. We now prove by induction over <math>i</math> that <math>\\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}: f^i(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq k</math>. The base of the induction <math>(i = 0)</math> obviously holds: <math>f^0(\\bot) = \\bot \\sqsubseteq k,</math> since <math>\\bot</math> is the least element of <math>L</math>. As the induction hypothesis, we may assume that <math>f^i(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq k</math>. We now do the induction step: From the induction hypothesis and the monotonicity of <math>f</math> (again, implied by the Scott-continuity of <math>f</math>), we may conclude the following: <math>f^i(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq k ~\\implies~ f^{i+1}(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f(k).</math> Now, by the assumption that <math>k</math> is a fixed-point of <math>f,</math> we know that <math>f(k) = k,</math> and from that we get <math>f^{i+1}(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq k.</math>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Knaster–Tarski theorem]]\n* Other [[fixed-point theorem]]s\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Fixed-point theorems]]"

In the Kleene–Brouwer order, the prefix is later than the longer sequence containing it, rather than earlier.\n\nThe Kleene–Brouwer order generalizes the notion of a [[postorder traversal]] from finite trees to trees that are not necessarily finite. For trees over a well-ordered set,  the Kleene–Brouwer order is itself a well-ordering if and only if the tree has no infinite branch. It is named after [[Stephen Cole Kleene]], [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]], [[Nikolai Luzin]], and [[Wacław Sierpiński]].\n\n==Definition==\nIf <math>t</math> and <math>s</math> are finite sequences of elements from <math>X</math>, we say that <math>t <_{KB} s</math> when there is an <math>n</math> such that either:\n* <math>t\\upharpoonright n = s\\upharpoonright n</math> and <math>t(n)</math> is defined but <math>s(n)</math> is undefined (i.e. <math>t</math> properly extends <math>s</math>), or\n* both <math>s(n)</math> and <math>t(n)</math> are defined, <math>t(n)<s(n)</math>, and <math>t\\upharpoonright n = s\\upharpoonright n</math>.\nHere, the notation <math>t\\upharpoonright n</math> refers to the [[Substring|prefix]] of <math>t</math> up to but not including <math>t(n)</math>.\nIn simple terms, <math>t <_{KB} s</math> whenever <math>s</math> is a prefix of <math>t</math> (i.e. <math>s</math> terminates before <math>t</math>, and they are equal up to that point) or <math>t</math> is to the \"left\" of <math>s</math> on the first place they differ.<ref name=\"moschovakis\"/>\n\n==Tree interpretation==\nA [[Tree (descriptive set theory)|tree]], in descriptive set theory, is defined as a set of finite sequences that is closed under prefix operations. The parent in the tree of any sequence is the shorter sequence formed by removing its final element. Thus, any set of finite sequences can be augmented to form a tree, and the Kleene–Brouwer order is a natural ordering that may be given to this tree. It is a generalization to potentially-infinite trees of the [[postorder traversal]] of a finite tree: at every node of the tree, the child subtrees are given their left to right ordering, and the node itself comes after all its children. The fact that the Kleene–Brouwer order is a linear ordering (that is, that it is transitive as well as being total) follows immediately from this, as any three sequences on which transitivity is to be tested form (with their prefixes) a finite tree on which the Kleene–Brouwer order coincides with the postorder.\n\nThe significance of the Kleene–Brouwer ordering comes from the fact that if <math>X</math> is [[well-ordered]], then a tree over  <math>X</math> is [[Well-founded relation|well-founded]] (having no infinitely long branches) if and only if the Kleene–Brouwer ordering is a well-ordering of the elements of the tree.<ref name=\"moschovakis\"/>\n\n==Recursion theory==\nIn [[recursion theory]], the Kleene–Brouwer order may be applied to the [[computation tree]]s of implementations of [[Computable function|total recursive]] [[Higher-order function|functionals]]. A computation tree is well-founded if and only if the computation performed by it is total recursive. Each state <math>x</math> in a computation tree may be assigned an [[ordinal number]] <math>||x||</math>, the supremum of the ordinal numbers <math>1+||y||</math> where <math>y</math> ranges over the children of <math>x</math> in the tree. In this way, the total recursive functionals themselves can be classified into a hierarchy, according to the minimum value of the ordinal at the root of a computation tree, minimized over all computation trees that implement the functional. The Kleene–Brouwer order of a well-founded computation tree is itself a recursive well-ordering, and at least as large as the ordinal assigned to the tree, from which it follows that the levels of this hierarchy are indexed by [[recursive ordinal]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Schwichtenberg | first1 = Helmut\n | last2 = Wainer | first2 = Stanley S.\n | contribution = 2.8 Recursive type-2 functionals and well-foundedness\n | isbn = 978-0-521-51769-0\n | location = Cambridge\n | mr = 2893891\n | pages = 98–101\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | series = Perspectives in Logic\n | title = Proofs and computations\n | year = 2012}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThis ordering was used by {{harvtxt|Lusin|Sierpinski|1923}},<ref>{{citation\n |last1        = Lusin\n |first1       = Nicolas\n |author1-link = Nikolai Luzin\n |last2        = Sierpinski\n |first2       = Waclaw\n |author2-link = Wacław Sierpiński\n |issue        = 2\n |journal      = Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées\n |pages        = 53–72\n |title        = Sur un ensemble non measurable B\n |url          = http://eudml.org/doc/57945\n |volume       = 9\n |year         = 1923\n |deadurl      = yes\n |archiveurl   = https://archive.is/20130414182741/http://eudml.org/doc/57945\n |archivedate  = 2013-04-14\n |df           = \n}}.</ref> and then again by {{harvtxt|Brouwer|1924}}.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Brouwer | first = L.

Then the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of f in L is also a complete lattice.''\n\nIt was Tarski who stated the result in its most general form,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Alfred Tarski | url=http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1103044538 | title=A lattice-theoretical fixpoint theorem and its applications | journal = Pacific Journal of Mathematics | volume=5:2 | year=1955 | pages=285&ndash;309}}</ref> and so the theorem is often known as '''Tarski's fixed point theorem'''. Some time earlier, Knaster and Tarski established the result for the special case where ''L'' is the lattice of subsets of a set, the [[power set]] lattice.<ref>{{cite journal | author=B.

In many practical cases, this is the most important implication of the theorem.\n\nThe [[least fixpoint]] of ''f'' is the least element ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''x'', or, equivalently, such that ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''x''; the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] holds for the [[greatest fixpoint]], the greatest element ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''x''.\n\nIf ''f''(lim ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)=lim ''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) for all ascending sequences ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, then the least fixpoint of ''f'' is lim ''f''<sup>''n''</sup>(0) where 0 is the least element of L, thus giving a more \"constructive\" version of the theorem. (See: [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]].) More generally, if ''f'' is monotonic, then the least fixpoint of ''f'' is the stationary limit of ''f''<sup>α</sup>(0), taking α over the [[ordinal number|ordinals]], where ''f''<sup>α</sup> is defined by [[transfinite induction]]: ''f''<sup>α+1</sup> = ''f'' ( ''f''<sup>α</sup>) and ''f''<sup>γ</sup> for a limit ordinal γ is the [[least upper bound]] of the ''f''<sup>β</sup> for all β ordinals less than γ. The dual theorem holds for the greatest fixpoint.\n\nFor example, in theoretical [[computer science]], [[least fixed point]]s of [[monotone function]]s are used to define [[program semantics]]. Often a more specialized version of the theorem is used, where ''L'' is assumed to be the lattice of all [[subset]]s of a certain set ordered by subset inclusion. This reflects the fact that in many applications only such lattices are considered. One then usually is looking for the smallest set that has the property of being a fixed point of the function ''f''. [[Abstract interpretation]] makes ample use of the Knaster–Tarski theorem and the formulas giving the least and greatest fixpoints.\n\nKnaster–Tarski theorem can be used for a simple proof of the [[Schröder–Bernstein theorem|Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].<ref>Example 3 in R.

For example:\n\n:''Let L be a [[partially ordered set]] with the smallest element (bottom) and let f : L → L be an [[monotonic function|order-preserving]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]. Further, suppose there exists u in L such that f(u) ≤ u and that any [[Total_order#Chains|chain]] in the subset {x in L : x ≤ f(x), x ≤ u} has supremum. Then f admits a least [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]].''\n\nThis can be applied to obtain various theorems on [[invariant set]]s, e.g. the Ok's theorem:\n\n:''For the monotone map F : P(X) → P(X) on the [[powerset|family]] of (closed) nonempty subsets of X the following are equivalent: (o) F admits A in P(X) s.t. <math>A \\subseteq F(A)</math>, (i) F admits invariant set A in P(X) i.e. <math>A = F(A)</math>, (ii) F admits maximal invariant set A, (iii) F admits the greatest invariant set A.''\n\nIn particular, using the Knaster-Tarski principle one can develop the theory of global attractors for noncontractive discontinuous (multivalued) [[iterated function system]]s. For weakly contractive iterated function systems [[Kantorovitch fixpoint theorem]] suffices.\n\nOther applications of fixed point principles for ordered sets come from the theory of differential, integral and operator equations.\n\n==Proof==\n\nLet's restate the theorem.\n\nFor a complete lattice <math>\\langle L, \\le \\rangle</math> and a monotone function <math>f\\colon L \\rightarrow L</math> on ''L'', the set of all fixpoints of ''f'' is also a complete lattice <math>\\langle P, \\le \\rangle</math>, with:\n* <math>\\bigvee P = \\bigvee \\{ x \\in L \\mid x \\le f(x) \\}</math> as the greatest fixpoint of ''f''\n* <math>\\bigwedge P = \\bigwedge \\{ x \\in L \\mid x \\ge f(x) \\}</math> as the least fixpoint of ''f''.\n\n''Proof.'' We begin by showing that ''P'' has least and greatest element. Let ''D'' = { ''x'' | ''x'' ≤ ''f(x)'' } and ''x'' ∈ ''D'' (we know that at least ''0<sub>L</sub>'' belongs to ''D''). Then because ''f'' is monotone we have ''f(x)'' ≤ ''f(f(x))'', that is ''f(x)'' ∈ ''D''.\n\nNow let <math>u = \\bigvee D</math> (u exists because ''D'' ⊆ ''L''). Then for all ''x'' ∈ ''D'' it is true that ''x'' ≤ ''u'' and ''f(x)'' ≤ ''f(u)'', so ''x'' ≤ ''f(x)'' ≤ ''f(u)''. Therefore, ''f(u)'' is an upper bound of ''D'', but ''u'' is the least upper bound, so ''u'' ≤ ''f(u)'', i.e. ''u'' ∈ ''D''. Then ''f(u)'' ∈ ''D'' (because ''f(u)'' ≤ ''f(f(u))'') and so ''f(u)'' ≤ ''u'' from which follows ''f(u)'' = ''u''. Because every fixpoint is in ''D'' we have that ''u'' is the greatest fixpoint of ''f''.\n\nThe function ''f'' is monotone on the dual (complete) lattice <math>\\langle L^{op}, \\ge \\rangle</math>. As we have just proved, its greatest fixpoint there exists. It is the least one on ''L'', so ''P'' has least and greatest elements, or more generally that every monotone function on a complete lattice has least and greatest fixpoints.\n\nIf ''a'' ∈ ''L'' and ''b'' ∈ ''L'', we'll write [''a'', ''b''] for the closed interval with bounds ''a'' and ''b'': { x ∈ ''L'' | ''a'' ≤ x ≤ ''b'' }. If ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then [''a'', ''b''] is a complete lattice.\n\nIt remains to be proven that P is a complete lattice. Let <math>1_L = \\bigvee L</math>, ''W'' ⊆ ''P'' and <math>w = \\bigvee W</math>. We′ll show that ''f''([''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>'']) ⊆ [''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>'']. Indeed, for every ''x'' ∈ ''W'' we have ''x'' = ''f(x)'' ≤ ''f(w)''.  Since ''w'' is the least upper bound of ''W'', ''w'' ≤ ''f(w)''. Then from ''y'' ∈ [''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>''] follows that ''w'' ≤ ''f(w)'' ≤ ''f(y)'', giving ''f(y)'' ∈ [''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>''] or simply ''f''([''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>'']) ⊆ [''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>'']. This allows us to look at ''f'' as a function on the complete lattice [''w'', ''1<sub>L</sub>'']. Then it has a least fixpoint there, giving us the least upper bound of ''W''. We′ve shown that an arbitrary subset of ''P'' has a supremum, which turns ''P'' into a complete lattice.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kleene fixpoint theorem]]\n* [[Kantorovitch fixpoint theorem]] (known also as Tarski-Kantorovitch fixpoint principle)\n* [[Modal μ-calculus]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | author=Andrzej Granas and [[James Dugundji]] | title=Fixed Point Theory | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]], New York | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-387-00173-9}}\n*{{cite book|first=T.|last=Forster|title=Logic, Induction and Sets|isbn=978-0-521-53361-4|date=2003-07-21}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | author=S.

However, like [[Goodstein's theorem]] or the [[Paris–Harrington theorem]], some special cases and variants of the theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first observed by [[Harvey Friedman]] in the early 1980's, an early success of the then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where <math>X</math> has order one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in [[arithmetical transfinite recursion|ATR<sub>0</sub>]],<ref>Simpson 1985, Theorem 1.8</ref> thus giving the first example of a [[impredicativity|predicative]] result with a provably impredicative proof.<ref>Friedman 2002, p.&nbsp;60</ref> This case of the theorem is still provable in Π{{su|p=1|b=1}}-CA<sub>0</sub>, but by adding a \"gap condition\" <ref>Simpson 1985, Definition 4.1</ref> to the definition of the order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem unprovable in this system.<ref>Simpson 1985, Theorem 5.14</ref><ref>Marcone 2001, p.&nbsp;8–9</ref> Much later, the Robertson-Seymour theorem would give another theorem unprovable inside Π{{su|p=1|b=1}}-CA<sub>0</sub>.\n\n[[Ordinal analysis]] confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the [[small Veblen ordinal]] (sometimes confused with the smaller [[Ackermann ordinal]]).\n\n===TREE(3)===\nSuppose that ''P''(''n'') is the statement:\n\n:There is some ''m'' such that if ''T''<sub>1</sub>,...,''T''<sub>''m''</sub> is a finite sequence of unlabeled rooted trees where ''T''<sub>''k''</sub> has ''n''+''k'' vertices, then ''T''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''T''<sub>''j''</sub> for some ''i'' < ''j''.\n\nAll the statements ''P''(''n'') are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and [[Kőnig's lemma]].

The least ''m'' for which ''P''(''n'') holds similarly grows extremely quickly with ''n''.\n\nBy incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far-faster growing function.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-March/010279.html |first=Harvey |last=Friedman |title=273:Sigma01/optimal/size |work=[[Ohio State University]] Department of Maths |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref> For a positive integer ''n'', take ''TREE''(''n''){{ref label|TR|*|^ *}} to be the largest ''m'' so that we have the following:\n\n:There is a sequence ''T''<sub>1</sub>,...,''T''<sub>''m''</sub> of rooted trees labelled from a set of ''n''  labels, where each ''T''<sub>i</sub> has at most ''i'' vertices, such that ''T''<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;&le;&nbsp; ''T''<sub>j</sub> does not hold for any ''i'' < ''j'' &nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''m''.\n\nThe ''TREE'' sequence begins ''TREE''(1) = 1, ''TREE''(2) = 3, then suddenly ''TREE''(3) explodes to a value so enormously large that many other \"large\" combinatorial constants, such as Friedman's ''n''(4),{{ref label|n_k|*|^ *}} are extremely small by comparison.

A function need not have a least fixed point, and cannot have more than one.\n\nFor example, with the usual order on the real numbers, the least fixed point of the real function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''² is ''x'' = 0 (since the only other fixed point is 1 and 0 &lt; 1). In contrast, ''f''(''x'') = ''x''+1 has no fixed point at all, let alone a least one, and ''f''(''x'')=''x'' has infinitely many fixed points, but no least one.\n\n==Applications==\nMany [[fixed-point theorem]]s yield algorithms for locating the least fixed point.

      "text": "[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded, non-empty, [[real number|real]] set has a least upper bound.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''least-upper-bound property''' (sometimes the '''completeness''' or '''supremum property''' or '''l.u.b''')<ref>Bartle and Sherbert (2011) define the \"completeness property\" and say that it is also called the \"supremum property\". (p. 39)</ref> is a fundamental property of the [[real number]]s. More generally, a [[partially ordered set]] {{math|''X''}} has the least-upper-bound property if every non-empty [[set (mathematics)|subset]] of {{math|''X''}} with an [[upper bound]] has a [[least upper bound|''least'' upper bound]] (supremum) in {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe least-upper-bound property is one form of the [[Completeness of the real numbers|completeness axiom]] for the real numbers, and is sometimes referred to as '''Dedekind completeness'''.<ref>Willard says that an ordered space \"X is Dedekind complete if every subset of X having an upper bound has a least upper bound.\" (pp. 124-5, Problem 17E.)</ref> It can be used to prove many of the fundamental results of [[real analysis]], such as the [[intermediate value theorem]], the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], the [[extreme value theorem]], and the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].  It is usually taken as an axiom in synthetic [[construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] (see [[least upper bound axiom]]), and it is also intimately related to the construction of the real numbers using [[Dedekind cut]]s.\n\nIn [[order theory]], this property can be generalized to a notion of [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] for any [[partially ordered set]].   A [[linearly ordered set]] that is [[dense order|dense]] and has the least upper bound property is called a [[linear continuum]].\n\n==Statement of the property==\n\n===Statement for real numbers===\nLet {{math|''S''}} be a non-empty set of [[real number]]s.\n* A real number {{math|''x''}} is called an '''[[upper bound]]''' for {{math|''S''}} if {{math|''x'' ≥ ''s''}} for all {{math|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}.\n* A real number {{math|''x''}} is the '''least upper bound''' (or '''[[supremum]]''') for {{math|''S''}} if {{math|''x''}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} for every upper bound {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''S''}}.\nThe '''least-upper-bound property''' states that any non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound must have a least upper bound in ''real numbers''.\n\n===Generalization to ordered sets===\n[[File:Dedekind cut- square root of two.png|thumb|''Red:'' the set <math>\\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbf{Q} : x^2 \\le 2 \\right\\}</math>. ''Blue:'' the set of its upper bounds in <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math>.]]\n{{main article|Completeness (order theory)}}\nMore generally, one may define upper bound and least upper bound for any [[subset]] of a [[partially ordered set]] {{math|''X''}}, with “real number” replaced by “element of {{math|''X''}}”.  In this case, we say that {{math|''X''}} has the least-upper-bound property if every non-empty subset of {{math|''X''}} with an upper bound has a least upper bound.\n\nFor example, the set {{math|'''Q'''}} of [[rational number]]s does not have the least-upper-bound property under the usual order.  For instance, the set\n\n: <math> \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbf{Q} : x^2 \\le 2 \\right\\} = \\mathbf{Q} \\cap \\left(-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}\\right) </math>\n\nhas an upper bound in {{math|'''Q'''}}, but does not have a least upper bound in {{math|'''Q'''}} (since the square root of two is [[Irrational number|irrational]]).  The [[construction of the real numbers]] using [[Dedekind cut]]s takes advantage of this failure by defining the irrational numbers as the least upper bounds of certain subsets of the rationals.\n\n==Proof==\n\n===Logical status===\nThe least-upper-bound property is equivalent to other forms of the [[completeness axiom]], such as the convergence of [[Cauchy sequence]]s or the [[nested intervals theorem]].  The logical status of the property depends on the [[construction of the real numbers]] used: in the [[Construction of the real numbers#Synthetic approach|synthetic approach]], the property is usually taken as an axiom for the real numbers (see [[least upper bound axiom]]); in a constructive approach, the property must be proved as a [[theorem]], either directly from the construction or as a consequence of some other form of completeness.\n\n===Proof using Cauchy sequences===\nIt is possible to prove the least-upper-bound property using the assumption that every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges.  Let {{math|''S''}} be a [[nonempty]] set of real numbers, and suppose that {{math|''S''}} has an upper bound {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub>}}.  Since {{math|''S''}} is nonempty, there exists a real number {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>}} that is not an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}.  Define sequences {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ''A''<sub>3</sub>, ...}} and {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>2</sub>, ''B''<sub>3</sub>, ...}} recursively as follows:\n# Check whether {{math|(''A<sub>n</sub>'' + ''B<sub>n</sub>'') ⁄ 2}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}.\n# If it is, let {{math|''A''<sub>''n''+1</sub> {{=}} ''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and let {{math|''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub> {{=}} (''A<sub>n</sub>'' + ''B<sub>n</sub>'') ⁄ 2}}.\n# Otherwise there must be an element {{math|''s''}} in {{math|''S''}} so that {{math|''s''>(''A<sub>n</sub>'' + ''B<sub>n</sub>'') ⁄ 2}}.  Let {{math|''A''<sub>''n''+1</sub> {{=}} ''s''}} and let {{math|''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub> {{=}} ''B<sub>n</sub>''}}.\nThen {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''A''<sub>2</sub> ≤ ''A''<sub>3</sub> ≤ ⋯ ≤ ''B''<sub>3</sub> ≤ ''B''<sub>2</sub> ≤ ''B''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|{{!}}''A<sub>n</sub>'' − ''B<sub>n</sub>''{{!}} → 0}} as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}.  It follows that both sequences are Cauchy and have the same limit {{math|''L''}}, which must be the least upper bound for {{math|''S''}}.\n\n==Applications==\nThe least-upper-bound property of {{math|'''R'''}} can be used to prove many of the main foundational theorems in [[real analysis]].\n\n===Intermediate value theorem===\nLet {{math|''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R'''}} be a [[continuous function]], and suppose that {{math|''f'' (''a'') < 0}} and {{math|''f'' (''b'') > 0}}.  In this case, the [[intermediate value theorem]] states that {{math|''f''}} must have a [[Root of a function|root]] in the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.  This theorem can proved by considering the set\n:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  ''f'' (''x'') < 0 for all ''x'' ≤ ''s''} }}.\nThat is, {{math|''S''}} is the initial segment of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} that takes negative values under {{math|''f''}}.  Then {{math|''b''}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}, and the least upper bound must be a root of {{math|''f''}}.\n\n===Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem===\nThe [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]] for {{math|'''R'''}} states that every [[sequence]] {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}} of real numbers in a closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} must have a convergent [[subsequence]].  This theorem can be proved by considering the set\n:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  ''s'' ≤ ''x<sub>n</sub>'' for infinitely many ''n''} }}.\nClearly {{math|''b''}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}, so {{math|''S''}} has a least upper bound {{math|''c''}}.  Then {{math|''c''}} must be a [[limit point]] of the sequence {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, and it follows that {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}} has a subsequence that converges to {{math|''c''}}.\n\n===Extreme value theorem===\nLet {{math|''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R'''}} be a [[continuous function]] and let {{math|''M'' {{=}} sup ''f'' ([''a'', ''b''])}}, where {{math|''M'' {{=}} ∞}} if {{math|''f'' ([''a'', ''b''])}} has no upper bound.  The [[extreme value theorem]] states that {{math|''M''}} is finite and {{math|''f'' (''c'') {{=}} ''M''}} for some {{math|''c'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']}}.  This can be proved by considering the set\n:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  sup ''f'' ([''s'', ''b'']) {{=}} ''M''} }}.\nIf {{math|''c''}} is the least upper bound of this set, then it follows from continuity that {{math|''f'' (''c'') {{=}} ''M''}}.\n\n===Heine–Borel theorem===\nLet {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} be a closed interval in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let {{math|{''U<sub>α</sub>''} }} be a collection of [[open set]]s that [[Cover (topology)|covers]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.  Then the [[Heine–Borel theorem]] states that some finite subcollection of {{math|{''U<sub>α</sub>''} }} covers {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} as well.  This statement can be proved by considering the set\n:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  [''a'', ''s''] can be covered by finitely many ''U<sub>α</sub>''} }}.\nThis set must have a least upper bound {{math|''c''}}.  But {{math|''c''}} is itself an element of some open set {{math|''U<sub>α</sub>''}}, and it follows that {{math|[''a'', ''c'' + ''δ'']}} can be covered by finitely many {{math|''U<sub>α</sub>''}} for some sufficiently small {{math|''δ'' > 0}}.

      "text": "{{Hatnote|For similarly named ordering systems outside mathematics, see [[alphabetical order]], [[natural sort order]], [[lexicographic preferences]], and [[collation]].}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''lexicographic''' or '''lexicographical order''' (also known as '''lexical order''', '''dictionary order''', '''alphabetical order''' or '''lexicographic(al) product''') is a generalization of the way words are [[alphabetical order|alphabetically ordered]] based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. This generalization consists primarily in defining a [[total order]] over the [[sequence]]s (often called [[String_(computer_science)|strings]] in [[computer science]]) of elements of a finite [[totally ordered set]], often called an [[alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]].\n\nThere are several variants and generalizations of the lexicographical ordering. One variant widely used in [[combinatorics]] orders subsets of a given [[finite set]] by assigning a total order to the finite set, and converting subsets into increasing sequences, to which the lexicographical order is applied. Another generalization defines an order on a [[Cartesian product]] of [[partially ordered set]]s; this order is a total order if and only if the factors of the Cartesian product are totally ordered.\n\n==Motivation and definition==\nThe word ''lexicographic'' is derived from [[lexicon]], the set of words that are used in some language and appear in [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s. The lexicographic order has thus been introduced for [[sorting]] the entries of dictionaries and encyclopedias. This has been formalized in the following way.\n\nConsider a [[finite set]] {{math|''A''}}, often called [[alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]], which is [[totally ordered]]. In dictionaries, this is the common alphabet, ordered by the [[alphabetical order]]. In [[Index (publishing)|book indexes]], the alphabet is generally extended to all [[alphanumeric]] characters; it is the object of a specific convention whether a digit is considered as smaller or larger than a letter. The lexicographic order is a [[total order]] on the [[sequence]]s of elements of {{math|''A''}}, often called [[string (computer science)|words]] on {{math|''A''}}, which is defined as follows.\n\nGiven two different sequences of the same length, {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub>...''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub>...''b''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''<''b<sub>i</sub>''}} (for the order of  {{math|''A''}}), for the first {{math|''i''}} where {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|''b<sub>i</sub>''}} differ.\n\nTo compare sequences of different lengths, the shorter sequence is usually padded at the end with enough \"blanks\" (a special symbol that is treated as smaller than every element of {{math|''A''}}). This way of comparing sequences of different lengths is always used in dictionaries. However, in [[combinatorics]], another convention is frequently used, whereby a shorter sequence is always smaller than a longer sequence. This variant of the lexicographical order is sometimes called ''[[shortlex order]]''.\n\nIn dictionary order, the word \"Thomas\" appears before \"Thompson\" because the letter 'a' comes before the letter 'p' in the alphabet. The 5th letter is the first that is different in the two words; the first four letters are \"Thom\" in both. Because it is the first difference, the 5th letter is the most significant difference for the alphabetical ordering.\n\nAn important property of the lexicographical order on words of a fixed length on a finite alphabet is that it is a [[well-order]]; that is, every decreasing sequence of words is finite.<ref name=\"Harzheim\"/><ref name=\"BaaderNipkow1999\">{{cite book|author1=Franz Baader|author2=Tobias Nipkow|title=Term Rewriting and All That|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77920-3|pages=18–19}}</ref>\n\n==Numeral systems and dates==\nThe lexicographical order is used not only in dictionaries, but also commonly for numbers and dates.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the [[Roman numeral system]] is that it is not always immediately obvious which of two numbers is the smaller. On the other hand, with the [[positional notation]] of the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], comparing numbers is easy, because the natural order on [[nonnegative integer]]s is the same as the variant [[shortlex order|shortlex]] of the lexicographic order. In fact, with positional notation, a nonnegative integer is represented by a sequence of [[numerical digit]]s, and an integer is larger than another one if either it has more digits (ignoring leading zeroes) or the number of digits is the same and the first digit which differs is larger.\n\nFor [[real number]]s written in [[decimal notation]], a slightly different variant of the lexicographical order is used: the parts on the left of the decimal point are compared as before; if they are equal, the parts at the right of the decimal point are compared with the lexicographical order.\n\nWhen negative numbers are also considered, one has to reverse the order for comparing negative numbers. This is not usually a problem for humans, but it may be for [[computer]]s (testing the sign takes some time). This is one of the reasons for adopting [[two's complement]] representation for representing [[signed integer]]s in computers.\n\nAnother example of a non-dictionary use of lexicographical ordering appears in the [[ISO 8601]] standard for dates, which expresses a date as YYYY-MM-DD. This formatting scheme has the advantage that the lexicographical order on sequences of characters that represent dates coincides with the [[chronological order]]: an earlier date is smaller in the lexicographical order than a later date. This date ordering makes [[sorting algorithm|computerized sorting]] of dates easier by avoiding the need for a separate sorting algorithm.\n\n==Monoid of words==\nThe ''monoid of words'' over an alphabet {{math|''A''}} is the [[free monoid]] over {{math|''A''}}. That is, the elements of the monoid are the [[finite sequence]]s (words) of elements of {{math|''A''}} (including the empty sequence, of length 0), and the operation (multiplication) is the [[concatenation]] of words. A word {{math|''u''}} is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of another word {{math|''v''}} if there exists a word {{math|''w''}} such that {{math|1=''v'' = ''uw''}}.\n\nWith this terminology, the above definition of the lexicographical order becomes more concise: Given a [[partial order|partially]] or [[total order|totally ordered]] set {{math|''A''}}, and two words {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} over {{math|''A''}}, then one has {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} for the lexicographical order, if \n\n* either {{math|''a''}} is a prefix of {{math|''b''}} \n* or there exists words {{math|''u''}}, {{math|''v''}}, {{math|''w''}} (possibly empty) and elements {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''A''}} such that\n::{{math|''x'' < ''y''}}\n::{{math|1=''a'' = ''uxv''}}\n::{{math|1=''b'' = ''uyw''}}\n\nIf < is a total order on ''A'', then so is the lexicographic order on the words of {{math|''A''}}. However, in general this is not a [[well-order]], even if the alphabet {{math|''A''}} is well-ordered. For instance, if {{math|1=''A'' = {''a'', ''b''}{{void}}}}, the [[Formal language|language]] {{math|{''a''<sup>''n''</sup>''b'' {{!}} ''n'' ≥ 0}{{void}}}} has no least element in the lexicographical order: {{math|... < ''aab'' < ''ab'' < ''b''}}.\n\nSince many applications require well orders, a variant of the lexicographical orders is often used. This well-order, sometimes called ''[[shortlex]]'' or ''quasi-lexicographical order'', consists in considering first the lengths of the words (if {{math|length(''a'') < length(''b'')}}, then {{math|''a'' < ''b''}}), and, if the lengths are equal, using the lexicographical order. If the order on {{math|''A''}} is a well-order, the same is true for the shortlex order.<ref name=\"BaaderNipkow1999\"/><ref>{{cite book | last=Calude | first=Cristian | authorlink=Cristian S. Calude | title=Information and randomness.

An element of a [[Cartesian product]] {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub>× ... ×''E''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a sequence whose {{math|''i''}}th element belongs to {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for every {{math|''i''}}. As evaluating the lexicographical order of sequences compares only elements which have the same rank in the sequences, the lexicographical order extends to Cartesian products of ordered sets.\n\nSpecifically, given two [[partially ordered set]]s {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, the lexicographical order on the Cartesian product {{math|''A'' &times; ''B''}} is defined as\n:{{math|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''a''&prime;,''b''&prime;)}} if and only if {{math|''a'' < ''a''&prime;}} or {{math|1=(''a'' = ''a''&prime; and ''b'' ≤ ''b''&prime;)}}.\n\nThe result is a partial order. If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are each [[total order|totally ordered]], then the result is a total order as well. The lexicographical order of two totally ordered sets is thus a [[linear extension]] of their [[product order]].\n\nOne can define similarly the lexicographic order on the Cartesian product of an infinite family of ordered sets, if the family is indexed by the [[nonnegative integers]], or more generally by a well-ordered set. This generalized lexicographical order is a total order if each factor set is totally ordered.\n\nUnlike the finite case, an infinite product of well-orders is not necessarily well-ordered by the lexicographical order. For instance, the set of [[countably infinite]] binary [[sequence]]s (by definition, the set of functions from [[non-negative integers]] to {{math|{0, 1}{{void}}}}, also known as the [[Cantor space]] {{math|{0, 1}<sup>ω</sup>}}) is not well-ordered; the subset of sequences that have precisely one {{math|1}} (i.e. {{math|{ 100000..., 010000..., 001000..., ... }{{void}}}}) does not have a least element under the lexicographical order induced by {{math|0 < 1}}, because {{math|100000... > 010000... > 001000... > ...}} is an [[infinite descending chain]].<ref name=\"Harzheim\">{{cite book|author=Egbert Harzheim|title=Ordered Sets|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-24222-4|pages=88–89}}</ref> Similarly, the infinite lexicographic product is not [[Noetherian relation|Noetherian]] either because {{math|011111... < 101111... < 110111 ... < ...}} is an infinite ascending chain.\n\n== Functions over a well-ordered set==\nThe functions from a [[well-ordered set]] {{math|''X''}} to a [[totally ordered set]] {{math|''Y''}} may be identified with sequences indexed by {{math|''X''}} of elements of {{math|''Y''}}. They can thus be ordered by the lexicographical order, and for two such functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}}, the lexicographical order is thus determined by their values for the smallest {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''f''(''x'') ≠ ''g''(''x'')}}.\n\nIf {{math|''Y''}} is also well-ordered and {{math|''X''}} is finite, then the resulting order is a well-order. As shown above, if {{math|''X''}} is infinite this is not the case.\n\n==Finite subsets==\n[[File:Orderings; 6 choose 3.svg|thumb|340px|Orderings of the 3-[[subset]]s of {1, ..., 6}, represented as sets of red squares, increasing sequences (in blue), or by their [[indicator function]]s, converted in [[decimal notation]] (in grey). The grey numbers are also the rank of the subsets in all subsets of {1, ..., 6}, numbered in colexicographical order, and starting from 0. The lexicographical (lex) and colexicographical (colex) orders are on the top and the corresponding reverse orders (rev) on the bottom<br>One passes from an order to its reverse order, either by reading bottom-up instead of up-bottom, or by exchanging red and white colors.]]\n\nIn [[combinatorics]], one has often to enumerate, and therefore to order the [[finite subset]]s of a given set {{math|''S''}}. For this, one usually chooses an order on {{math|''S''}}. Then, [[sorting]] a subset of {{math|''S''}} is equivalent to convert it into an [[increasing sequence]]. The lexicographic order on the resulting sequences induces thus an order on the subsets, which is also called the ''lexicographical order''.\n\nIn this context, one generally prefer to sort first the subsets by [[cardinality]], such as in the [[shortlex order]]. Therefore, in the following, we will consider only orders on subsets of fixed cardinal.\n\nFor example, using the natural order of the integers, the lexicographical ordering on the subsets of three elements of {{math|1=''S'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}{{void}}}} is\n\n:{{math|123 < 124 < 125 < 126 < 134 < 135 < 136 < 145 < 146 < 156 <}} \n::{{math|234 < 235 < 236 < 245 < 246 < 256 < 345 < 346 < 356 < 456}}.\n\nFor ordering finite subsets of a given cardinality of the [[natural number]]s, the ''colexicographical'' order (see below) is often more convenient, because all [[initial segment]]s are finite, and thus the colexicographical order defines an [[order isomorphism]] between the natural numbers and the set of sets of {{math|''n''}} natural numbers. This is not the case for the lexicographical order, as, with the lexicographical order, we have, for example, {{math|12''n'' < 134}} for every {{math|''n'' > 2}}.\n\n==Group orders of <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math>==\nLet <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math> be the [[free Abelian group]] of rank {{math|''n''}}, whose elements are sequences of {{math|''n''}} integers, and operation is the [[additive group|addition]]. A [[totally ordered group|group order]] on <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math> is a [[total order]], which is compatible with addition, that is \n:<math>a < b \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad a+c<b+c.</math>\n\nThe lexicographical ordering is a group order on <math>\\mathbb Z^n.</math>\n\nThe lexicographical ordering may also be used to characterize all group orders on <math>\\mathbb Z^n.</math><ref>Robbiano, L.

The [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion vectors]] (in red) of permutations in ''colex'' order are in ''revcolex'' order, and vice versa.]]\n\nThe '''colexicographic''' or '''colex order''' is a variant of the lexicographical order that is obtained by reading finite sequences from the right to the left instead of reading them from the left to the right.  More precisely, whereas the lexicographical order between two sequences is defined by\n\n:{{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub>...''a''<sub>''k''</sub> <<sup>lex</sup> ''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub> ... ''b''<sub>''k''</sub>}} if {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>'' < ''b<sub>i</sub>''}} for the first {{math|''i''}} where {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|''b<sub>i</sub>''}} differ,\nthe colexicographical order is defined by\n\n:{{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub>...''a''<sub>''k''</sub> <<sup>colex</sup> ''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub>...''b''<sub>''k''</sub>}} if {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>'' < ''b<sub>i</sub>''}} for the last {{math|''i''}} where {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|''b<sub>i</sub>''}} differ\n\nIn general, the difference between the colexicographical order and the lexicographical order is not very significant. However, when considering increasing sequences, typically for coding subsets, the two orders differ significantly.\n\nFor example, for ordering the increasing sequences (or the sets) of two natural integers, the lexicographical order begins by\n\n:{{math|12 < 13 < 14 < 15 < ... < 23 < 24 < 25 < ... < 34 < 35 < ... < 45 < ...}}, \n\nand the colexicographic order begins by\n\n:{{math|12 < 13 < 23 < 14 < 24 < 34 < 15 < 25 < 35 < 45 < ...}}.\n\nThe main property of the colexicographical order for increasing sequences of a given length is that every [[initial segment]] is finite. In other words, the colexicographical order for increasing sequences of a given length induces an [[order isomorphism]] with the natural numbers, and allows enumerating these sequences. This is frequently used in [[combinatorics]], for example in the proof of the [[Kruskal-Katona theorem]].\n\n==Monomials==\nWhen considering [[polynomial]]s, the order of the terms does not matter in general, as the addition is commutative. However, some [[algorithm]]s, such as [[polynomial long division]], require the terms to be in a specific order. Many of the main algorithms for [[multivariate polynomial]]s are related with [[Gröbner bases]], concept that requires the choice of a [[monomial order]], that is a [[total order]], which is compatible with the [[monoid]] structure of the [[monomials]]. Here \"compatible\" means that <math>a<b \\implies ac < bc</math>, if the monoid operation is denoted multiplicatively. This compatibility implies that the product of a polynomial by a monomial does not change the order of the terms. For Gröbner bases, a further condition must be satisfied, namely that every non constant monomial is greater than the monomial {{math|1}}. However this condition is not needed for other related algorithms, such as the algorithms for the computation of the [[tangent cone#Definition in algebraic geometry|tangent cone]].\n\nAs Gröbner bases are defined for polynomials in a fixed number of variables, it is common to identify monomials (for example <math>x_1 x_2^3 x_4 x_5^2</math>) with their exponent vectors (here {{math|[1, 3, 0, 1, 2]}}). If {{math|''n''}} is the number of variables, every monomial order is thus the restriction to <math>\\mathbb N^n</math> of a monomial order of <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math> (see above {{slink||Group orders of}} <math>\\mathbb Z^n</math>, for a classification).\n\nOne of these admissible orders is the lexicographical order. It is, historically, the first to have been used for defining Gröbner bases, and is sometimes called ''pure lexicographical order'' for distinguishing it from other orders that are also related to a lexicographical order.\n\nAnother one consists in comparing first the [[total degree]]s, and then resolving the conflicts by using the lexicographical order. This order is not widely used, as either the lexicographical order or the degree reverse lexicographical order have generally better properties.\n\nThe ''degree reverse lexicographical order'' consists also in comparing first the total degrees, and, in case of equality of the total degrees, using the reverse of the colexicographical order. That is, given two exponent vectors, one has \n\n:<math>[a_1, \\ldots, a_n] <[b_1, \\ldots, b_n]</math>\n\nif either \n\n:<math>a_1+ \\cdots+ a_n < b_1+ \\cdots+ b_n,</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>a_1+ \\cdots+ a_n= b_1+\\cdots+ b_n \\quad \\text{and}\\quad a_i>b_i \\text{ for the largest } i \\text{ for which } a_i\\neq b_i.</math>\n\nFor this ordering, the monomials of degree one have the same order as the corresponding indeterminates (this would not be the case if the reverse lexicographical order would be used).  For comparing monomials in two variables of the same total degree, this order is the same as the lexicographic order. This is not the case with more variables. For example, for exponent vectors of monomials of degree two in three variables, one has for the degree reverse lexicographic order:\n\n:<math>[0, 0, 2] < [0, 1, 1] < [1, 0, 1] <[0, 2, 0] < [1, 1, 0] < [2, 0, 0]</math>\n\nFor the lexicographical order, the same exponent vectors are ordered as\n\n:<math>[0, 0, 2] < [0, 1, 1] < [0, 2, 0] < [1, 0, 1] < [1, 1, 0] < [2, 0, 0].</math>\n\nA useful property of the degree reverse lexicographical order is that a [[homogeneous polynomial]] is a multiple of the least indeterminate if and only if its leading monomial (its greater monomial) is a multiple of this least indeterminate.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Collation]]\n* [[Kleene–Brouwer order]]\n* [[Lexicographic preferences]]\n* [[Total order#Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets|Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets]]\n* [[Ordered vector space#Examples|Lexicographic order on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>]]\n* [[Lexicographic order topology on the unit square]]\n* [[Abstract index notation#Braiding|Lexicographic ordering in tensor abstract index notation]]\n* [[Long line (topology)]]\n* [[Lyndon word]]\n* [[Lexicographically minimal string rotation]]\n* [[File:Wikiversity-logo-en.svg|20px]] [[v:Lexicographic and colexicographic order|Lexicographic and colexicographic order]]\n* [[Star product]], a different way of combining partial orders\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Lexicography]]"

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2009}}\nIn the [[mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[order theory]], one often speaks about [[function (mathematics)|function]]s that '''preserve'''  certain limits, i.e. certain [[supremum|suprema]] or [[infimum|infima]]. Roughly speaking, these functions map the supremum/infimum of a set to the supremum/infimum of the image of the set. Depending on the type of sets for which a function satisfies this property, it may preserve finite, directed, non-empty, or just arbitrary suprema or infima. Each of these requirements appears naturally and frequently in many areas of order theory and there are various important relationships among these concepts and other notions such as [[monotonic function|monotonicity]]. If the implication of limit preservation is inverted, such that the existence of limits in the range of a function implies the existence of limits in the domain, then one obtains functions that are '''limit-reflecting'''.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to clarify the definition of these basic concepts, which is necessary since the literature is not always consistent at this point, and to give general results and explanations on these issues.\n\n== Background and motivation ==\n\nIn many specialized areas of order theory, one restricts to classes of [[partially ordered set]]s that are [[completeness (order theory)|complete]] with respect to certain limit constructions. For example, in [[lattice (order)|lattice theory]], one is interested in orders where all finite non-empty sets have both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. In [[domain theory]], on the other hand, one focuses on partially ordered sets in which every [[directed set|directed subset]] has a supremum. Complete lattices and orders with a least element (the \"empty supremum\") provide further examples.\n\nIn all these cases, limits play a central role for the theories, supported by their interpretations in practical applications of each discipline. One also is interested in specifying appropriate mappings between such orders. From an [[universal algebra|algebraic]] viewpoint, this means that one wants to find adequate notions of [[homomorphism]]s for the structures under consideration. This is achieved by considering those functions that are ''compatible'' with the constructions that are characteristic for the respective orders. For example, lattice homomorphisms are those functions that ''preserve'' non-empty finite suprema and infima, i.e. the image of a supremum/infimum of two elements is just the supremum/infimum of their images. In domain theory, one often deals with so-called [[Scott-continuous]] functions that preserve all directed suprema.\n\nThe background for the definitions and terminology given below is to be found in [[category theory]], where  [[limit (category theory)|limits]] (and ''co-limits'') in a more general sense are considered. The categorical concept of '''limit-preserving''' and '''limit-reflecting''' [[functor]]s is in complete harmony with order theory, since orders can be considered as small categories defined as poset categories with defined additional structure.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\nConsider two partially ordered sets ''P'' and ''Q'', and a function ''f'' from ''P'' to ''Q''. Furthermore, let ''S'' be a subset of ''P'' that has a least upper bound ''s''. Then ''f'' '''preserves''' the supremum of ''S'' if the set ''f''(''S'') = {''f''(''x'') | ''x'' in ''S''} has a least upper bound in ''Q'' which is equal to ''f''(''s''), i.e.\n: ''f''(sup ''S'') = sup ''f''(''S'')\n\nNote that this definition consists of two requirements: the supremum of the set ''f''(''S'') ''exists'' and it is equal to ''f''(''s''). This corresponds to the abovementioned parallel to category theory, but is not always required in the literature. In fact, in some cases one weakens the definition to require only existing suprema to be equal to ''f''(''s''). However, Wikipedia works with the common notion given above and states the other condition explicitly if required.\n\nFrom the fundamental definition given above, one can derive a broad range of useful properties. A function ''f'' between [[partially ordered set|posets]] ''P'' and ''Q'' is said to preserve finite, non-empty, directed, or arbitrary suprema if it preserves the suprema of all finite, non-empty, directed, or arbitrary sets, respectively. The preservation of non-empty finite suprema can also be defined by the identity ''f''(''x'' v ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') v ''f''(''y''), holding for all elements ''x'' and ''y'', where we assume v to be a total function on both orders.\n\nIn a [[duality (order theory)|dual]] way, one defines properties for the preservation of infima.\n\nThe \"opposite\" condition to preservation of limits is called reflection. Consider a function ''f'' as above and a subset ''S'' of ''P'', such that sup ''f''(''S'') exists in ''Q'' and is equal to ''f''(''s'') for some element ''s'' of ''P''. Then ''f'' '''reflects''' the supremum of ''S'' if sup ''S'' exists and is equal to ''s''. As already demonstrated for preservation, one obtains many additional properties by considering certain classes of sets ''S'' and by dualizing the definition to infima.\n\n== Special cases ==\n\nSome special cases or properties derived from the above scheme are known under other names or are of particular importance to some areas of order theory. For example, functions that preserve the empty supremum are those that preserve the least element. Furthermore, due to the motivation explained earlier, many limit-preserving functions appear as special homomorphisms for certain order structures. Some other prominent cases are given below.\n\n=== Preservation of ''all'' limits ===\n\nAn interesting situation occurs if a function '''preserves all suprema''' (or infima). More accurately, this is expressed by saying that a function preserves all ''existing'' suprema (or infima), and it may well be that the posets under consideration are not complete lattices. For example, (monotone) [[Galois connection]]s have this property. Conversely, by the order theoretical [[adjoint functor theorem (order theory)|Adjoint Functor Theorem]], mappings that preserve all suprema/infima can be guaranteed to be part of a unique Galois connection as long as some additional requirements are met.\n\n=== Distributivity ===\n\nA [[lattice (order)|lattice]] ''L'' is '''[[distributive lattice|distributive]]''' if, for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''L'', we find\n\n: <math>x \\wedge \\left( y \\vee z \\right)\n= \\left( x \\wedge y \\right) \\vee \\left( x \\wedge z \\right) </math>\n\nBut this just says that the '''meet''' function ^: ''L'' -> ''L'' '''preserves binary suprema'''. It is known in lattice theory, that this condition is equivalent to its dual, i.e. the function v: ''L'' -> ''L'' preserving binary infima. In a similar way, one sees that the infinite distributivity law\n\n: <math>x \\wedge \\bigvee S\n= \\bigvee \\left \\{ x \\wedge s \\mid s \\in S \\right \\}</math>\n\nof [[complete Heyting algebra]]s (see also [[pointless topology]]) is equivalent to the meet function ^ preserving arbitrary suprema. This condition, however, does not imply its dual.\n\n=== Scott-continuity ===\n\nFunctions that preserve directed suprema are called [[Scott-continuous]] or sometimes just ''continuous'', if this does not cause confusions with the according concept of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]]. A similar use of the term ''continuous'' for preservation of limits can also be found in category theory.\n\n== Important properties and results ==\n\nThe above definition of limit preservation is quite strong. Indeed, every function that preserves at least the suprema or infima of two-element chains, i.e. of sets of two comparable elements, is necessarily monotone. Hence, all the special preservation properties stated above induce monotonicity.\n\nBased on the fact that some limits can be expressed in terms of others, one can derive connections between the preservation properties.\nFor example, a function ''f'' preserves directed suprema [[if and only if]] it preserves the suprema of all ideals.\nFurthermore, a mapping ''f'' from a poset in which every non-empty finite supremum exists (a so-called sup-semilattice) preserves arbitrary suprema if and only if it preserves both directed and finite (possibly empty) suprema.\n\nHowever, it is not true that a function that preserves all suprema would also preserve all infima or vice versa.\n\n[[Category:Order theory]]"

      "text": "{{Refimprove\n| date = May 2017\n}}\n\nIn the mathematical field of [[order theory]], a '''continuum''' or '''linear continuum''' is a generalization of the [[real line]].\n \nFormally, a linear continuum is a [[linearly ordered set]] ''S'' of more than one element that is [[Dense order|densely ordered]], i.e., between any two distinct elements there is another (and hence infinitely many others), and which \"lacks gaps\" in the sense that every non-empty subset with an upper bound has a [[least upper bound]]. More symbolically:\n<ol type=a><!--Referred to in text below as \"property a\" and \"property b\"-->\n<li> ''S'' has the [[least-upper-bound property]], and</li>\n<li> For each ''x'' in ''S'' and each ''y'' in ''S'' with ''x'' < ''y'', there exists ''z'' in ''S'' such that ''x'' < ''z'' < ''y''</li>\n</ol>\nA [[Set (mathematics)|set]] has the least upper bound property, if every [[nonempty]] [[subset]] of the set that is bounded above has a [[least upper bound]]. Linear continua are particularly important in the field of [[topology]] where they can be used to verify whether an [[total order|ordered set]] given the [[order topology]] is [[Connected space|connected]] or not.<ref>{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James|title=Topology, 2nd ed.|year=2000|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|isbn=0-13-181629-2|pages=31,153}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the standard real line, a linear continuum may be bounded on either side: for example, any (real) [[closed interval]] is a linear continuum.\n\n==Examples==\n* The ordered set of [[real number]]s, '''R''', with its usual [[Total order|order]] is a linear continuum, and is the archetypal example. Property b) is trivial, and property a) is simply a reformulaton of the [[completeness axiom]].\n\nExamples in addition to the real numbers:\n*sets which are [[Order isomorphism|order-isomorphic]] to the set of real numbers, for example a real open interval, and the same with half-open gaps (note that these are not gaps in the above-mentioned sense)\n*the [[affinely extended real number system]] and order-isomorphic sets, for example the [[unit interval]]\n*the set of real numbers with only +∞ or only −∞ added, and order-isomorphic sets, for example a half-open interval\n*the [[long line (topology)|long line]]\n* The set ''I'' × ''I'' (where × denotes the [[Cartesian product]] and ''I'' = [0, 1]) in the [[lexicographic order]] is a linear continuum. Property b) is trivial. To check property a), we define a map, π<sub>1</sub> : ''I'' × ''I'' → ''I'' by:\n\n:''π''<sub>1</sub> (''x'', ''y'') = ''x''\n\nThis map is known as the [[projection map]]. The projection map is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] (with respect to the product topology on ''I'' × ''I'') and is [[surjective]]. Let ''A'' be a nonempty subset of ''I'' × ''I'' which is bounded above. Consider ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A''). Since ''A'' is bounded above, ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A'') must also be bounded above. Since, ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A'') is a subset of ''I'', it must have a least [[upper bound]] (since ''I'' has the [[least upper bound property]]). Therefore, we may let ''b'' be the least upper bound of ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A''). If ''b'' belongs to ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A''), then ''b'' × ''I'' will intersect ''A'' at say ''b'' × ''c'' for some ''c'' ∈ ''I''. Notice that since ''b'' × ''I'' has the same [[order type]] of ''I'', the set (''b'' × ''I'') ∩ ''A'' will indeed have a least upper bound ''b'' × ''c''', which is the desired least upper bound for ''A''.\n\nIf ''b'' does not belong to ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A''), then ''b'' × 0 is the least upper bound of ''A'', for if ''d'' < ''b'', and ''d'' × ''e'' is an upper bound of ''A'', then ''d'' would be a smaller upper bound of ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''A'') than ''b'', contradicting the unique property of ''b''.\n\n==Non-examples==\n* The set of [[rational number]]s is not a linear continuum. Even though property b) is satisfied, property a) is not. Consider the subset:\n\n::''A'' = { ''x'' | ''x'' < {{radic|2}} }\n\n: of the set of rational numbers. Even though this set is bounded above by any rational number greater than {{radic|2}} (for instance 3), it has no [[least upper bound]] in the rational numbers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=G.H.|title=A Course of Pure Mathematics, 10th ed.|year=1952|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-09227-2|pages=11–15, 24–31}}</ref>  (Specifically, for any rational upper bound ''r'' > {{radic|2}}, ''r''/2 + 1/''r''  is a closer rational upper bound; details at {{section link|Methods of computing square roots|Babylonian method}}.)\n\n* The set of non-negative [[integer]]s with its usual order is not a linear continuum. Property a) is satisfied (let ''A'' be a subset of the set of non-negative integers that is bounded above. Then ''A'' is [[Finite set|finite]] so that it has a maximum. This maximum is the desired least upper bound of ''A''). On the other hand, property b) is not. Indeed, 5 is a non-negative integer and so is 6, but there exists no non-negative integer that lies strictly between them.\n* The [[total order|ordered set]] ''A'' of nonzero real numbers:\n\n::''A'' = (−∞, 0) ∪ (0, +∞)\n\n: is not a linear continuum. Property b) is trivially satisfied. However, if ''B'' is the set of negative real numbers:\n\n::''B'' = (−∞, 0)\n\n: then ''B'' is a subset of ''A'' which is bounded above (by any element of ''A'' greater than 0; for instance 1), but has no least upper bound in ''B''. Notice that 0 is not a bound for ''B'' since 0 is not an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A''.\n\n* Let Z<sub>−</sub> denote the set of negative integers and let A = (0,5) ∪ (5,+∞). Let:\n\n::S = Z<sub>−</sub> ∪ A\n\n: Then S satisfies neither property a) nor property b). The proof is similar to the previous examples.\n\n==Topological properties==\nEven though linear continua are important in the study of [[total order|ordered sets]], they do have applications in the mathematical field of [[topology]]. In fact, we will prove that an [[total order|ordered set]] in the [[order topology]] is [[Connected space|connected]] if and only if it is a linear continuum (notice the 'if and only if' part). We will prove one implication, and leave the other one as an exercise. (Munkres explains the second part of the proof <ref>{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James|title=Topology, 2nd ed.|year=2000|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-181629-2|pages=153–154}}</ref>)\n\n'''Theorem'''\n\nLet ''X'' be an ordered set in the [[order topology]]. If ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]], then ''X'' is a linear continuum.\n\n''Proof:''\n\nSuppose, x is in X and y is in X where x < y. If there exists no z in X such that x < z < y, consider the sets:\n\nA = (−∞, y)\n\nB = (x, +∞)\n\nThese sets are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] (If a is in A, a < y so that if a is in B, a > x and a < y which is impossible by hypothesis), [[nonempty]] (x is in A and y is in B) and open (in the [[order topology]]) and their union is X. This contradicts the connectedness of X.\n\nNow we prove the least upper bound property. If C is a subset of X that is bounded above and has no least upper bound, let D be the union of all [[order topology|open rays]] of the form (b, +∞) where b is an upper bound for C. Then D is [[open set|open]] (since it is the union of open sets), and [[Closed set|closed]] (if 'a' is not in D, then a &lt; b for all upper bounds b of C so that we may choose q &gt; a such that q is in C (if no such q exists, a is the least upper bound of C), then an [[order topology|open interval]] containing a, may be chosen that doesn't intersect D). Since D is nonempty (there is more than one upper bound of D for if there was exactly one upper bound s, s would be the least upper bound. Then if b<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>2</sub> are two upper bounds of D with b<sub>1</sub> < b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> will belong to D), D and its complement together form a [[separated sets|separation]] on X. This contradicts the [[connectedness]] of X.\n\n===Applications of the theorem===\n1. Since the [[total order|ordered set]]:\n\nA = (−∞, 0) U (0,+∞)\n\nis not a linear continuum, it is disconnected.\n\n2. By applying the theorem just proved, the fact that R is [[Connected space|connected]] follows. In fact any interval (or ray) in R is also connected.\n\n3. The set of [[integers]] is not a linear continuum and therefore cannot be connected.\n\n4. In fact, if an ordered set in the order topology is a linear continuum, it must be connected. Since any interval in this set is also a linear continuum, it follows that this space is [[locally connected space|locally connected]] since it has a [[Basis (topology)|basis]] consisting entirely of connected sets.\n\n5. For an example of a [[topological space]] that is a linear continuum, see [[long line (topology)|long line]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cantor-Dedekind axiom]]\n* [[Order topology]]\n* [[Least upper bound property]]\n* [[Total order]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Topology]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]"

For a vector <math>\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d</math>, we denote by <math>\\mathbf{a}^{\\downarrow}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d</math> the vector with the same components, but sorted in descending order.\nGiven <math>\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d</math>, we say that\n<math> \\mathbf{a} </math> '''weakly majorizes''' (or dominates) <math> \\mathbf{b} </math> '''from below''' written as <math> \\mathbf{a} \\succ_w \\mathbf{b} </math> [[iff]]\n\n: <math> \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i^{\\downarrow} \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^k b_i^{\\downarrow} \\quad \\text{for } k=1,\\dots,d,</math>\n\nEquivalently, we say that <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is '''weakly majorized''' (or dominated) by <math>\\mathbf{a}</math> '''from below''', written as <math> \\mathbf{b} \\prec_w \\mathbf{a} </math>.\n\nIf <math> \\mathbf{a} \\succ_w \\mathbf{b} </math>  and in addition <math>\\sum_{i=1}^d a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^d b_i</math>, we say that <math> \\mathbf{a} </math> '''majorizes''' (or dominates) <math> \\mathbf{b} </math>, written as <math> \\mathbf{a} \\succ \\mathbf{b} </math>. Equivalently, we say that <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is '''majorized''' (or dominated) by <math>\\mathbf{a}</math>, written as <math> \\mathbf{b} \\prec \\mathbf{a} </math>.\n\nNote that the majorization order does not depend on the order of the components of the vectors <math> \\mathbf{a} </math> or <math> \\mathbf{b} </math>. Majorization is not a [[partially ordered set|partial order]], since <math> \\mathbf{a} \\succ \\mathbf{b} </math> and <math> \\mathbf{b} \\succ \\mathbf{a} </math> do not imply <math> \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b} </math>, it only implies that the components of each vector are equal, but not necessarily in the same order.\n\nNote that the notation is inconsistent in the mathematical literature: some use the reverse notation, e.g., <math>\\succ</math> is replaced with  <math>\\prec</math>.\n\nA function <math>f:\\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> is said to be [[Schur-convex function|Schur convex]] when <math>\\mathbf{a} \\succ \\mathbf{b}</math> implies <math>f(\\mathbf{a}) \\geq  f(\\mathbf{b})</math>.  Similarly, <math>f(\\mathbf{a})</math> is '''Schur concave''' when <math>\\mathbf{a} \\succ \\mathbf{b}</math> implies <math>f(\\mathbf{a}) \\leq f(\\mathbf{b}).</math>\n\nThe majorization partial order on finite sets, described here, can be generalized to the [[Lorenz ordering]], a partial order on [[cumulative distribution function|distribution functions]]. For example, a [[Income distribution|wealth distribution]] is Lorenz-greater than another iff its [[Lorenz curve]] lies '''below''' the other. As such, a Lorenz-greater wealth distribution has a higher [[Gini coefficient]], and has more [[income inequality]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe order of the entries does not affect the majorization, e.g., the statement <math>(1,2)\\prec (0,3)</math> is simply \nequivalent to <math>(2,1)\\prec (3,0)</math>.\n\n(Strong) majorization: <math>(1,2,3)\\prec (0,3,3)\\prec (0,0,6)</math>.

Then <math>m\\in S</math> is a maximal element of <math>S</math> if\n\nfor all <math>s\\in S</math>, <math>m \\leq s </math> implies <math> m = s. </math>\n\nThe definition for minimal elements is obtained by using ≥ instead of ≤.\n\n==Existence and uniqueness==\n[[File:Zigzag poset.svg|thumb|x100px|A [[Fence (mathematics)|fence]] consists of minimal and maximal elements only (Example 3).]]\nMaximal elements need not exist.\n\n: '''Example 1:''' Let  ''S'' = [1,∞) ⊂ [[real number|ℝ]], for all ''m''∈''S'' we have ''s''=''m''+1∈''S'' but ''m''<''s'' (that is, ''m''≤''s'' but not ''m''=''s'').\n\n: '''Example 2:''' Let ''S'' = {''s''∈[[rational number|ℚ]]: 1≤''s''<sup>2</sup>≤2} ⊂ ℚ and recall that [[Square_root_of_2#Proofs_of_irrationality|<math>\\sqrt{2}</math>∉ℚ]].\n\nIn general ≤ is only a partial order on ''S''. If ''m'' is a maximal element and ''s''∈''S'', it remains the possibility that neither ''s''≤''m'' nor ''m''≤''s''. This leaves open the possibility that there are many maximal elements.\n\n: '''Example 3:''' In the [[Fence (mathematics)|fence]] ''a''<sub>1</sub> < ''b''<sub>1</sub> > ''a''<sub>2</sub> < ''b''<sub>2</sub> > ''a''<sub>3</sub> < ''b''<sub>3</sub> > ..., all the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> are minimal, and all the ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> are maximal, see picture.\n: '''Example 4:''' Let ''A'' be a set with at least two elements and let ''S''={{''a''}: ''a''∈''A''} be the subset of the [[power set]] ''P''(''A'') consisting of [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]], partially ordered by ⊂. This is the discrete poset—no two elements are comparable—and thus every element {''a''}∈''S'' is maximal (and minimal) and for any distinct ''a''&prime;,''a''&Prime; neither {''a''&prime;} ⊂ {''a''&Prime;} nor {''a''&Prime;} ⊂ {''a''&prime;}.\n\n==Maximal elements and the greatest element==\n[[File:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|x100px|Power set of {''x'',''y'',''z''}, partially ordered by ⊂. Its greatest element, {''x'',''y'',''z''}, is its only maximal element.]]\nA maximal element need not be a [[greatest element]] or [[maximum]], since the definition of a maximal element is weaker than that of a greatest element. If <math>s\\in S</math> with <math>\\max S\\leq s</math>, then, by the definition of greatest element, <math>s\\leq \\max S</math> so that <math>s=\\max S</math>. In other words, a maximum, if it exists, is the (unique) maximal element.\n\nThe converse is not true: there can be maximal elements despite there being no maximum. Example 3 is an instance of this since there exist many maximal elements and no maximum. This is due, again, to the fact that in general <math>\\leq </math> is only a partial order on <math>S</math>. If <math>m</math> is a maximal element and <math>s\\in S</math>, the possibility remains that neither <math>s\\leq m</math> nor <math>m\\leq s</math>.\n\nIf there are many maximal elements, there are contexts in which they are called '''frontiers''', as in the '''[[Pareto frontier]].'''\n\nWhen the restriction of <math>\\leq </math> to <math>S</math> is a [[total order]], the notions of maximal element and greatest element coincide. Let <math>m\\in S</math> be a maximal element, for any <math>s\\in S</math> either <math>s\\leq m</math> or <math>m\\leq s</math>. In the second case, the definition of maximal element requires that <math>m=s</math>, so it follows that <math>s\\leq m</math>. In other words, <math>m</math> is a greatest element.\n\n<math>S</math> being totally ordered is sufficient to ensure that a maximal element is a greatest element, but this is not a necessary condition.\nFor example, every power set ''P''(''S'') of a set ''S'' has only one maximal element, viz. ''S'' itself, which is also the unique greatest element; but almost no power set is totally ordered, cf. picture.\n\n==Directed sets==\nIn a [[totally ordered set]], the terms maximal element and greatest element coincide, which is why both terms are used interchangeably in fields like [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] where only total orders are considered. This observation applies not only to totally ordered subsets of any poset, but also to their order theoretic generalization via [[directed set]]s. In a directed set, every pair of elements (particularly pairs of incomparable elements) has a common upper bound within the set. Any maximal element of such a subset will be unique (unlike in a poset).  Furthermore, this unique maximal element will also be the greatest element.\n\nSimilar conclusions are true for minimal elements.\n\nFurther introductory information is found in the article on [[order theory]].\n\n==Examples==\n* In [[Pareto efficiency]], a '''Pareto optimum''' is a maximal element with respect to the partial order of Pareto improvement, and the set of maximal elements is called the '''Pareto frontier.'''\n* In [[decision theory]], an '''[[admissible decision rule]]''' is a maximal element with respect to the partial order of ''[[dominating decision rule]].''\n* In [[modern portfolio theory]], the set of maximal elements with respect to the [[product order]] on risk and return is called '''the [[efficient frontier]].'''\n* In [[set theory]], a set is [[finite set|finite]] if and only if every non-empty [[family of sets|family]] of [[subset]]s has a minimal element when ordered by the [[inclusion relation]].\n* In [[abstract algebra]], the concept of a [[maximal common divisor]] is needed to generalize [[greatest common divisor]]s to number systems in which the common divisors of a set of elements may have more than one maximal element.\n* In [[computational geometry]], the [[maxima of a point set]] are maximal with respect to the partial order of coordinatewise domination.\n\n===Consumer theory===\nIn economics, one may relax the axiom of antisymmetry, using preorders (generally [[total preorder]]s) instead of partial orders; the notion analogous to maximal element is very similar, but different terminology is used, as detailed below.\n\nIn [[consumer theory]] the consumption space is some set <math>X</math>, usually the positive orthant of some vector space so that each <math>x\\in X</math> represents a quantity of consumption specified for each existing commodity in the\neconomy. [[Preferences]] of a consumer are usually represented by a [[total preorder]] <math>\\preceq </math> so that <math>x,y\\in X</math> and <math>x\\preceq y</math> reads: <math>x</math> is at most as preferred as <math>y</math>. When <math>x\\preceq y</math> and <math>y\\preceq x</math> it is interpreted that the consumer is indifferent between <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> but is no reason to conclude that <math>x=y</math>, preference relations are never assumed to be antisymmetric. In this context, for any <math>B\\subset X</math>, we call <math>x\\in B</math> a '''maximal element''' if\n\n: <math>y\\in B</math> implies <math> y\\preceq x</math>\n\nand it is interpreted as a consumption bundle that is not dominated by any other bundle in the sense that <math>x\\prec y</math>, that is <math>x\\preceq y</math> and not <math> y\\preceq x</math>.\n\nIt should be remarked that the formal definition looks very much like that of a greatest element for an ordered set. However, when <math>\\preceq </math> is only a preorder, an element <math>x</math> with the property above behaves very much like a maximal element in an ordering. For instance, a maximal element <math>x\\in B</math> is not unique for <math> y\\preceq x</math> does not preclude the possibility that <math> x\\preceq y</math> (while <math> y\\preceq x</math> and <math> x\\preceq y</math> do not imply <math> x = y</math> but simply indifference <math>x\\sim y</math>). The notion of greatest element for a preference preorder would be that of '''most preferred''' choice. That is, some <math>x\\in B</math> with\n\n: <math>y\\in B</math> implies <math> y\\prec x.</math>\n\nAn obvious application is to the definition of demand correspondence. Let <math>P</math> be the class of functionals on <math>X</math>. An element <math>p\\in P</math> is called a '''price functional''' or '''price system''' and maps every consumption bundle <math>x\\in X</math> into its market value <math>p(x)\\in \\mathbb{R}_+</math>. The '''budget correspondence''' is a correspondence <math>\\Gamma \\colon P\\times \\mathbb{R}_+ \\rightarrow X</math> mapping any price system and any level of income into a subset\n\n: <math>\\Gamma (p,m)=\\{x\\in X \\mid p(x)\\leq m\\}.</math>\n\nThe '''demand correspondence''' maps any price <math>p</math> and any level of income <math>m</math> into the set of <math>\\preceq </math>-maximal elements of <math>\\Gamma (p,m)</math>.\n\n: <math>D(p,m)=\\big\\{x\\in X \\mid x</math> is a maximal element of <math>\\Gamma (p,m)\\big\\}</math>.\n\nIt is called demand correspondence because the theory predicts that for <math>p</math> and <math>m</math> given, the [[rational choice]] of a consumer <math>x^*</math> will be some element <math>x^*\\in D(p,m)</math>.\n\n== Related notions ==\nA subset <math>Q</math> of a partially ordered set <math>P</math> is said to be [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] if for every <math>x \\in P</math> there exists some <math>y \\in Q</math> such that <math>x \\le y</math>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], in the areas of [[order theory]] and [[combinatorics]], '''Mirsky's theorem''' characterizes the height of any finite [[partially ordered set]] in terms of a partition of the order into a minimum number of [[antichain]]s. It is named for {{harvs|first=Leon|last=Mirsky|authorlink=Leon Mirsky|year=1971|txt}} and is closely related to [[Dilworth's theorem]] on the widths of partial orders, to the [[perfect graph|perfection]] of [[comparability graph]]s, to the [[Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem]] relating [[longest path problem|longest paths]] and [[graph coloring|colorings]] in graphs, and to the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]] on monotonic subsequences.\n\n==The theorem==\nThe height of a partially ordered set is defined to be the maximum cardinality of a [[antichain|chain]], a [[total order|totally ordered]] subset of the given partial order. For instance, in the set of positive integers from 1 to ''N'', ordered by [[divisibility]], one of the largest chains consists of the [[power of two|powers of two]] that lie within that range, from which it follows that the height of this partial order is <math>1+\\lfloor\\log_2 N\\rfloor</math>.\n\nMirsky's theorem states that, for every finite partially ordered set, the height also equals the minimum number of antichains (subsets in which no pair of elements are ordered) into which the set may be partitioned. In such a partition, every two elements of the longest chain must go into two different antichains, so the number of antichains is always greater than or equal to the height; another formulation of Mirsky's theorem is that there always exists a partition for which the number of antichains equals the height. Again, in the example of positive integers ordered by divisibility, the numbers can be partitioned into the antichains {1}, {2,3}, {4,5,6,7}, etc. There are <math>1+\\lfloor\\log_2 N\\rfloor</math> sets in this partition, and within each of these sets, every pair of numbers forms a ratio less than two, so no two numbers within one of these sets can be divisible.\n\nTo prove the existence of a partition into a small number of antichains for an arbitrary finite partially ordered set, consider for every element ''x'' the chains that have ''x'' as their largest element, and let ''N''(''x'') denote the size of the largest of these ''x''-maximal chains. Then each set ''N''<sup>−1</sup>(''i''), consisting of elements that have equal values of ''N'', is an antichain, and these antichains partition the partial order into a number of antichains equal to the size of the largest chain. In his original proof, Mirsky constructs the same partition inductively, by choosing an antichain of the maximal elements of longest chains, and showing that the length of the longest chain among the remaining elements is reduced by one.\n\n==Related results==\n===Dilworth's theorem===\nMirsky was inspired by [[Dilworth's theorem]], stating that, for every partially ordered set, the maximum size of an antichain equals the minimum number of chains in a partition of the set into chains. For sets of [[order dimension]] two, the two theorems coincide (a chain in the [[majorization]] ordering of points in general position in the plane is an antichain in the set of points formed by a 90° rotation from the original set, and vice versa) but for more general partial orders the two theorems differ, and (as Mirsky observes) Dilworth's theorem is more difficult to prove.\n\nMirsky's theorem and Dilworth's theorem are also related to each other through the theory of [[perfect graph]]s. An undirected graph is [[Perfect graph|perfect]] if, in every [[induced subgraph]], the [[chromatic number]] equals the size of the largest clique. In the [[comparability graph]] of a partially ordered set, a clique represents a chain and a coloring represents a partition into antichains, and induced subgraphs of comparability graphs are themselves comparability graphs, so Mirsky's theorem states that comparability graphs are perfect. Analogously, Dilworth's theorem states that every [[complement graph]] of a comparability graph is perfect. The [[perfect graph theorem]] of {{harvtxt|Lovász|1972}} states that the complements of perfect graphs are always perfect, and can be used to deduce Dilworth's theorem from Mirsky's theorem and vice versa {{harv|Golumbic|1980}}.\n\n===Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem===\nMirsky's theorem can be restated in terms of [[directed acyclic graph]]s (representing a partially ordered set by [[reachability]] of their vertices), as the statement that there exists a [[graph homomorphism]] from a given directed acyclic graph ''G'' to a ''k''-vertex [[Tournament (graph theory)|transitive tournament]] if and only if there does not exist a homomorphism from a (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-vertex [[path graph]] to ''G''. For, the largest path graph that has a homomorphism to ''G'' gives the longest chain in the reachability ordering, and the sets of vertices with the same image in a homomorphism to a transitive tournament form a partition into antichains. This statement generalizes to the case that ''G'' is not acyclic, and is a form of the [[Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem]] on [[graph coloring]]s and [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientations]] {{harv|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}.\n\n===Erdős–Szekeres theorem===\nIt follows from either Dilworth's theorem or Mirsky's theorem that, in every partially ordered set of ''rs''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 elements, there must exist either a chain of ''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 elements or an antichain of ''s''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 elements. {{harvtxt|Mirsky|1971}} uses this observation, applied to a partial order of order dimension two, to prove the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]] that in every sequence of ''rs''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 totally ordered elements there must exist either a monotonically increasing subsequence of ''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 elements or a monotonically decreasing subsequence of ''s''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 elements.\n\n==Extensions==\nMirsky's theorem extends immediately to infinite partially ordered sets with finite height. However, the relation between the length of a chain and the number of antichains in a partition into antichains does not extend to infinite cardinalities: for every infinite [[cardinal number]] &kappa;, there exist partially ordered sets that have no infinite chain and that do not have an antichain partition with &kappa; or fewer antichains {{harv|Schmerl|2002}}.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last = Dilworth | first = Robert P.\n | authorlink = Robert P.

      "text": "{{redirect-distinguish|Möbius transform|Möbius transformation}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the classic '''Möbius inversion formula''' was introduced into [[number theory]] on 1832 by [[August Ferdinand Möbius]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Möbius|1832|pp=105-123}}</ref>\n\nA large generalization of this formula applies to summation over an arbitrary [[Locally finite poset|locally finite partially ordered set]], with Möbius' classical formula applying to the set of the natural numbers ordered by divisibility: see [[incidence algebra]].\n\n==Statement of the formula==\nThe classic version states that if {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|f}} are [[arithmetic function]]s satisfying\n\n: <math>g(n)=\\sum_{d \\mid n}f(d)\\quad\\text{for every integer }n\\ge 1</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>f(n)=\\sum_{d \\mid n}\\mu(d)g\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)\\quad\\text{for every integer }n\\ge 1</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|μ}} is the [[Möbius function]] and the sums extend over all positive [[divisor]]s {{mvar|d}} of {{mvar|n}} (indicated by <math>d \\mid n</math> in the above formulae). In effect, the original {{math|''f''(''n'')}} can be determined given {{math|''g''(''n'')}} by using the inversion formula. The two sequences are said to be '''Möbius transforms''' of each other.\n\nThe formula is also correct if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are functions from the positive integers into some [[abelian group]] (viewed as a {{math|ℤ}}-[[module (mathematics)|module]]).\n\nIn the language of [[Dirichlet convolution]]s, the first formula may be written as\n\n:<math>g=f*\\mathit{1}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|∗}} denotes the Dirichlet convolution, and {{math|''1''}} is the [[constant function]] {{math|''1''(''n'') {{=}} 1}}. The second formula is then written as\n\n:<math>f=\\mu * g.</math>\n\nMany specific examples are given in the article on [[multiplicative function]]s.\n\nThe theorem follows because {{math|∗}} is (commutative and) associative, and {{math|''1'' ∗ ''μ'' {{=}} ''ε''}}, where {{mvar|ε}} is the identity function for the Dirichlet convolution, taking values {{math|''ε''(1) {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''ε''(''n'') {{=}} 0}} for all {{math|''n'' > 1}}. Thus\n:<math>\\mu * g = \\mu * (\\mathit{1} * f) = (\\mu * \\mathit{1}) * f = \\varepsilon * f = f</math>.\n\n==Series relations==\nLet\n\n:<math>a_n=\\sum_{d\\mid n} b_d</math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math>b_n=\\sum_{d\\mid n} \\mu\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)a_d</math>\n\nis its transform. The transforms are related by means of series: the [[Lambert series]]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n x^n = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n \\frac{x^n}{1-x^n}</math>\n\nand the [[Dirichlet series]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac {a_n} {n^s} = \\zeta(s)\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{b_n}{n^s}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]].\n\n==Repeated transformations==\nGiven an arithmetic function, one can generate a bi-infinite sequence of other arithmetic functions by repeatedly applying the first summation. \n\nFor example, if one starts with [[Euler's totient function]] {{mvar|φ}}, and repeatedly applies the transformation process, one obtains:\n\n#{{mvar|φ}} the totient function\n#{{math|''φ'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''I''}}, where {{math|''I''(''n'') {{=}} ''n''}} is the [[identity function]]\n#{{math|''I'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''σ''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''σ''}}, the [[divisor function]]\n\nIf the starting function is the Möbius function itself, the list of functions is:\n#{{mvar|μ}}, the Möbius function\n#{{math|''μ'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''ε''}} where\n#::<math>\\varepsilon(n) = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\mbox{if }n=1 \\\\ 0, & \\mbox{if }n>1 \\end{cases} </math>\n#:is the [[unit function]]\n#{{math|''ε'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''1''}}, the [[constant function]]\n#{{math|''1'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''σ''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} d {{=}} ''τ''}}, where {{math|d {{=}} ''τ''}} is the number of divisors of {{mvar|n}}, (see [[divisor function]]).\n\nBoth of these lists of functions extend infinitely in both directions.  The Möbius inversion formula enables these lists to be traversed backwards.\n\nAs an example the sequence starting with {{mvar|φ}} is:\n\n:<math>f_n =\n  \\begin{cases}\n   \\underbrace{\\mu * \\ldots * \\mu}_{-n \\text{ factors}} * \\varphi & \\text{if } n < 0 \\\\[8px]\n   \\varphi & \\text{if } n = 0 \\\\[8px]\n   \\varphi * \\underbrace{\\mathit{1}* \\ldots * \\mathit{1}}_{n \\text{ factors}} & \\text{if } n > 0\n  \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe generated sequences can perhaps be more easily understood by considering the corresponding [[Dirichlet series]]: each repeated application of the transform corresponds to multiplication by the [[Riemann zeta function]].\n\n==Generalizations==\nA related inversion formula more useful in [[combinatorics]] is as follows: suppose {{math|''F''(''x'')}} and {{math|''G''(''x'')}} are [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[1,∞)}} such that\n\n:<math>G(x) = \\sum_{1 \\le n \\le x}F\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)\\quad\\mbox{ for all }x\\ge 1</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>F(x) = \\sum_{1 \\le n \\le x}\\mu(n)G\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)\\quad\\mbox{ for all }x\\ge 1.</math>\n\nHere the sums extend over all positive integers {{mvar|n}} which are less than or equal to {{mvar|x}}.\n\nThis in turn is a special case of a more general form. If {{math|''α''(''n'')}} is an [[arithmetic function]] possessing a [[Dirichlet inverse]] {{math|''α''<sup>−1</sup>(''n'')}}, then if one defines\n\n:<math>G(x) = \\sum_{1 \\le n \\le x}\\alpha (n) F\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)\\quad\\mbox{ for all }x\\ge 1</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>F(x) = \\sum_{1 \\le n \\le x}\\alpha^{-1}(n)G\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)\\quad\\mbox{ for all }x\\ge 1.</math>\n\nThe previous formula arises in the special case of the constant function {{math|''α''(''n'') {{=}} 1}}, whose [[Dirichlet inverse]] is {{math|''α''<sup>−1</sup>(''n'') {{=}} ''μ''(''n'')}}.\n\nA particular application of the first of these extensions arises if we have (complex-valued) functions {{math|''f''(''n'')}} and {{math|''g''(''n'')}} defined on the positive integers, with\n\n:<math>g(n) = \\sum_{1 \\le m \\le n}f\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{m}\\right\\rfloor\\right)\\quad\\mbox{ for all } n\\ge 1.</math>\n\nBy defining {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(⌊''x''⌋)}} and {{math|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''g''(⌊''x''⌋)}}, we deduce that\n\n:<math>f(n) = \\sum_{1 \\le m \\le n}\\mu(m)g\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{m}\\right\\rfloor\\right)\\quad\\mbox{ for all } n\\ge 1.</math>\n\nA simple example of the use of this formula is counting the number of [[reduced fraction]]s {{math|0 < {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} < 1}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are coprime and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''n''}}. If we let {{math|''f''(''n'')}} be this number, then {{math|''g''(''n'')}} is the total number of fractions {{math|0 < {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} < 1}} with {{math|''b'' ≤ ''n''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are not necessarily coprime.  (This is because every fraction {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} with {{math|gcd(''a'',''b'') {{=}} ''d''}} and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''n''}} can be reduced to the fraction {{math|{{sfrac|''a''/''d''|''b''/''d''}}}} with {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''d''}} ≤ {{sfrac|''n''|''d''}}}}, and vice versa.)  Here it is straightforward to determine {{math|''g''(''n'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''n''(''n'' − 1)|2}}}}, but {{math|''f''(''n'')}} is harder to compute.\n\nAnother inversion formula is (where we assume that the series involved are absolutely convergent):\n\n:<math>g(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{f(mx)}{m^s}\\quad\\mbox{ for all } x\\ge 1\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nf(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\mu(m)\\frac{g(mx)}{m^s}\\quad\\mbox{ for all } x\\ge 1.</math>\n\nAs above, this generalises to the case where {{math|''α''(''n'')}} is an arithmetic function possessing a Dirichlet inverse {{math|''α''<sup>−1</sup>(''n'')}}:\n\n:<math>g(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\alpha(m)\\frac{f(mx)}{m^s}\\quad\\mbox{ for all } x\\ge 1\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nf(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\alpha^{-1}(m)\\frac{g(mx)}{m^s}\\quad\\mbox{ for all } x\\ge 1.</math>\n\n==Multiplicative notation==\nAs Möbius inversion applies to any abelian group, it makes no difference whether the group operation is written as addition or as multiplication. This gives rise to the following notational variant of the inversion formula:\n\n:<math>\\mbox{if } F(n) = \\prod_{d|n} f(d),\\mbox{ then } f(n) = \\prod_{d|n} F\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)^{\\mu(d)}.</math>\n\n==Proofs of generalizations==\n\nThe first generalization can be proved as follows.  We use [[Iverson's convention]] that [condition] is the indicator function of the condition, being 1 if the condition is true and 0 if false.  We use the result that\n:<math>\\sum_{d|n}\\mu(d)=i(n),</math>\nthat is, {{math|''1'' ∗ ''μ'' {{=}} ''i''}}.\n\nWe have the following:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{1\\le n\\le x}\\mu(n)g\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)\n &= \\sum_{1\\le n\\le x} \\mu(n) \\sum_{1\\le m\\le \\frac{x}{n}} f\\left(\\frac{x}{mn}\\right)\\\\\n &= \\sum_{1\\le n\\le x} \\mu(n) \\sum_{1\\le m\\le \\frac{x}{n}} \\sum_{1\\le r\\le x} [r=mn] f\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right)\\\\\n &= \\sum_{1\\le r\\le x} f\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right) \\sum_{1\\le n\\le x} \\mu(n) \\sum_{1\\le m\\le \\frac{x}{n}} \\left[m=\\frac{r}{n}\\right] \\qquad\\text{rearranging the summation order}\\\\\n &= \\sum_{1\\le r\\le x} f\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right) \\sum_{n|r} \\mu(n) \\\\\n &= \\sum_{1\\le r\\le x} f\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right) i(r) \\\\\n &= f(x) \\qquad\\text{since }i(r)=0\\text{ except when }r=1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe proof in the more general case where {{math|''α''(''n'')}} replaces 1 is essentially identical, as is the second generalisation.\n\n==On posets==\n{{See also|Incidence algebra}}For a poset {{mvar|P}}, a set endowed with a partial order relation <math>\\leq</math>, define the Möbius function <math>\\mu</math> of {{mvar|P}} recursively by \n\n:<math>\\mu(s,s) = 1 \\text{ for } s \\in P, \\qquad \\mu(s,u) = - \\sum_{s \\leq t < u} \\mu(s,t), \\quad \\text{ for } s < u \\text{ in } P.</math>\n\n(Here one assumes the summations are finite.) Then for <math>f,g: P \\to K</math>, where {{mvar|K}} is a field, we have \n\n:<math>g(t) = \\sum_{s \\leq t} f(s) \\qquad \\text{ for all } t \\in P</math>\n\nif and only if \n\n:<math>f(t) = \\sum_{s \\leq t} g(s)\\mu(s,t) \\qquad \\text{ for all }t \\in P.</math>\n\n(See Stanley's ''Enumerative Combinatorics'', Vol 1, Section 3.7.)\n\n==Contributions of Weisner, Hall, and Rota==\n{{Quotation|\nThe statement of the general Möbius inversion formula [for partially ordered sets] was first given independently by [[Louis Weisner|Weisner]] (1935) and [[Philip Hall]] (1936); both authors were motivated by group theory problems. Neither author seems to have been aware of the combinatorial implications of his work and neither developed the theory of Möbius functions. In a fundamental paper on Möbius functions, [[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]] showed the importance of this theory in combinatorial mathematics and gave a deep treatment of it. He noted the relation between such topics as inclusion-exclusion, classical number theoretic Möbius inversion, coloring problems and flows in networks. Since then, under the strong influence of Rota, the theory of Möbius inversion and related topics has become an active area of combinatorics.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bender|Goldman|1975|pp=789–803}}</ref>\n |sign=|source=}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Farey sequence]]\n*[[Inclusion–exclusion principle]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Apostol IANT}}\n* {{citation|last1=Bender|first1=Edward A.|last2=Goldman|first2=J.&nbsp;R.|title=On the applications of Möbius inversion in combinatorial analysis|journal=Amer.

This concept first arose in [[calculus]], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of [[order theory]].\n\n== Monotonicity in calculus and analysis ==\nIn [[calculus]], a function <math>f</math> defined on a [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] with real values is called '''monotonic''' if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing.<ref name=\":1\" /> That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.\n\nA function is called '''monotonically increasing''' (also '''increasing''' or '''non-decreasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />), if for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> such that <math>x \\leq y</math> one has  <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\leq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so <math>f</math> preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called '''monotonically decreasing''' (also '''decreasing''' or '''non-increasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />) if, whenever <math>x \\leq y</math>, then <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\geq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so it ''reverses'' the order (see Figure 2).\n\nIf the order <math>\\leq</math> in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order <math><</math>, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called '''strictly increasing'''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called '''strictly decreasing'''.<ref name=\":0\" />  Functions that are strictly increasing or decreasing are [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] (because for <math>x</math> not equal to <math>y</math>, either <math>x < y</math> or <math>x > y</math> and so, by monotonicity, either <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) < f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math> or <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) > f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, thus <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right)</math> is not equal to <math>f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>.)\n\nIf it is not clear that \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are taken to include the possibility of repeating the same value at successive arguments, one may use the terms '''weakly increasing''' and '''weakly decreasing''' to stress this possibility.\n\nThe terms \"non-decreasing\" and \"non-increasing\" should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications \"not decreasing\" and \"not increasing\". For example, the function of figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.\n\nA function <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right)</math> is said to be '''absolutely monotonic''' over an interval <math>\\left(a, b\\right)</math> if the derivatives of all orders of <math>f</math> are [[nonnegative]] or all [[nonpositive]] at all points on the interval.\n\n=== Monotonic transformation ===\n\nThe term '''monotonic transformation''' (or '''monotone transformation''') can also possibly cause some confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a [[utility function]] being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also [[monotone preferences]]).<ref>See the section on Cardinal Versus Ordinal Utility in {{harvtxt|Simon|Blume|1994}}.</ref> In this context, what we are calling a \"monotonic transformation\" is, more accurately, called a \"positive monotonic transformation\", in order to distinguish it from a “negative monotonic transformation,” which reverses the order of the numbers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Varian |first=Hal R. |title=Intermediate Microeconomics |edition=8th |year=2010 |publisher=W.

Norton & Company |page=56 |isbn=9780393934243}}</ref>\n\n=== Some basic applications and results ===\nThe following properties are true for a monotonic function <math>f\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>:\n*<math>f</math> has [[limit of a function|limits]] from the right and from the left at every point of its [[Domain of a function|domain]];\n*<math>f</math> has a limit at positive or negative infinity (&thinsp;<math>\\pm\\infty</math>&thinsp;) of either a real number, <math>\\infty</math>, or <math>\\left(-\\infty\\right)</math>.\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[jump discontinuity|jump discontinuities]];\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[countable|countably]] many [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in its domain.  The discontinuities, however, do not necessarily consist of isolated points and may even be dense in an interval (''a'',''b'').\n\nThese properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Two facts about these functions are:\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>I</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[derivative|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]] on <math>I</math>, i.e. the set <math>\\left\\{x : x \\in I\\right\\}</math> of numbers <math>x</math> in <math>I</math> such that <math>f</math> is not differentiable in <math>x</math> has [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measure zero]]. In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see [[Cantor function]].\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an interval <math>\\left[a, b\\right]</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]].\n\nAn important application of monotonic functions is in [[probability theory]]. If <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]], its [[cumulative distribution function]] <math>F_X\\!\\left(x\\right) = \\text{Prob}\\!\\left(X \\leq x\\right)</math> is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nA function is ''[[unimodal function|unimodal]]'' if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the ''[[Mode (statistics)|mode]]'') and then monotonically decreasing.\n\nWhen <math>f</math> is a ''strictly monotonic'' function, then <math>f</math> is [[injective]] on its domain, and if <math>T</math> is the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of <math>f</math>, then there is an [[inverse function]] on <math>T</math> for <math>f</math>.\n\n== Monotonicity in topology ==\n\nA map ''<math>f: X \\rightarrow Y</math>'' is said to be '''monotone''' if each of its fibers is connected i.e. for each element ''<math>y</math>'' in <math>Y</math> the (possibly empty) set <math>f^{-1}(y)</math> is connected.\n\n== Monotonicity in functional analysis ==\n\nIn [[functional analysis]] on a [[topological vector space]] <math>X</math>, a (possibly non-linear) operator <math>T: X \\rightarrow X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone operator''' if\n\n:<math>(Tu - Tv, u - v) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall u,v \\in X.</math>\n\n[[Kachurovskii's theorem]] shows that [[convex function]]s on [[Banach space]]s have monotonic operators as their derivatives.\n\nA subset <math>G</math> of <math>X \\times X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone set''' if for every pair <math>[u_1, w_1]</math> and <math>[u_2, w_2]</math> in <math>G</math>,\n\n:<math>(w_1 - w_2, u_1 - u_2) \\geq 0.</math>\n\n<math>G</math> is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion.  The graph of a monotone operator <math>G(T)</math> is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if its graph is a '''maximal monotone set'''.\n\n== Monotonicity in order theory ==\n\nOrder theory deals with arbitrary [[partially ordered set]]s and [[preorder|preordered sets]] in addition to real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not [[total order|total]]. Furthermore, the [[strict order|strict]] relations < and > are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.\n\nA monotone function is also called '''isotone''', or '''{{visible anchor|order-preserving}}'''. The [[duality (order theory)|dual]] notion is often called '''antitone''', '''anti-monotone''', or '''order-reversing'''. Hence, an antitone function ''f'' satisfies the property\n\n: ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') ≥ ''f''(''y''),\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.\n\nA [[constant function]] is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if ''f'' is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of ''f'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then ''f'' must be constant.\n\nMonotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are [[order embedding]]s (functions for which ''x'' ≤ ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y'')) and [[order isomorphism]]s ([[surjective]] order embeddings).\n\n== Monotonicity in the context of search algorithms ==\nIn the context of [[search algorithm]]s monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to [[heuristic function]]s.  A heuristic ''h(n)'' is monotonic if, for every node ''n'' and every successor ''n''' of ''n'' generated by any action ''a'', the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''n'' is no greater than the step cost of getting to '' n' '' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from '' n' '',\n\n:<math>h(n) \\leq c(n, a, n') + h(n').</math>\n\nThis is a form of [[triangle inequality]], with ''n'', ''n''', and the goal ''G<sub>n</sub>'' closest to ''n''.  Because every monotonic heuristic is also [[admissible heuristic|admissible]], monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility.  Some [[heuristic algorithm]]s such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can be proven [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|optimal]] provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.<ref>Conditions for optimality:  Admissibility and consistency pg. 94-95 {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2010}}.</ref>\n\n== Boolean functions ==\nIn [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a monotonic function is one such that for all ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> in {0,1}, if ''a''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> (i.e. the Cartesian product {0, 1}<sup>''n''</sup> is ordered [[Coordinatewise order|coordinatewise]]), then f(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) ≤ f(''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>). In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that a Boolean function is monotonic when in its [[Hasse diagram]] ([[Duality (mathematics)#Dimension-reversing dualities|dual]] of its [[Venn diagram]]), there is no 1 connected to a higher 0.\n\nThe monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' and ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (in particular ''[[negation|not]]'' is forbidden). For instance \"at least two of ''a'',''b'',''c'' hold\" is a monotonic function of ''a'',''b'',''c'', since it can be written for instance as ((''a'' and ''b'') or (''a'' and ''c'') or (''b'' and ''c'')).\n\nThe number of such functions on ''n'' variables is known as the [[Dedekind number]] of ''n''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Monotone cubic interpolation]]\n* [[Pseudo-monotone operator]]\n* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] - measure of how monotonic a set of data\n* [[Total monotonicity]]\n* [[Injective function]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n | last = Bartle\n | first = Robert G.\n | title = The elements of real analysis\n | edition = second\n | year = 1976\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Grätzer\n | first = George\n | title = Lattice theory: first concepts and distributive lattices\n | year = 1971\n | isbn = 0-7167-0442-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last       = Pemberton\n | first      = Malcolm\n |author2=Rau, Nicholas\n | title      = Mathematics for economists: an introductory textbook\n | publisher  = Manchester University Press\n | year       = 2001\n | pages      =\n | isbn       = 0-7190-3341-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Renardy, Michael  |author2=Rogers, Robert C.\n |lastauthoramp=yes |    title = An introduction to partial differential equations\n|   series = Texts in Applied Mathematics 13\n|  edition = Second\n|publisher = Springer-Verlag\n| location = New York\n|     year = 2004\n|    pages = 356\n|       isbn = 0-387-00444-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n |author1=Riesz, Frigyes  |author2=Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy\n  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Functional Analysis\n | year = 1990\n| publisher = Courier Dover Publications\n| isbn = 978-0-486-66289-3\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last=Russell |first=Stuart J. |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |ref=harv\n | title = Artificial Intelligence:  A Modern Approach\n | year = 2010\n | edition = 3rd\n | publisher = Prentice Hall\n | publication-place = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n | isbn = 978-0-13-604259-4\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Simon |first=Carl P. |first2=Lawrence |last2=Blume |ref=harv\n | title = Mathematics for Economists\n | edition = first\n | date = April 1994\n | isbn = 978-0-393-95733-4\n}} (Definition 9.31)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Monotone function|id=p/m064830}}\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ConvergenceOfAMonotonicSequence/ Convergence of a Monotonic Sequence] by Anik Debnath and Thomas Roxlo (The Harker School), [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* {{MathWorld |title=Monotonic Function |id=MonotonicFunction}}\n\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Types of functions]]"

      "text": "[[Image:Order dimension.svg|thumb|240px|A partial order of dimension 4 (shown as a [[Hasse diagram]]) and four total orderings that form a realizer for this partial order.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''dimension''' of a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is the smallest number of [[total order]]s the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of which gives rise to the partial order.\nThis concept is also sometimes called the '''order dimension''' or the '''Dushnik–Miller dimension''' of the partial order.\n{{harvtxt|Dushnik|Miller|1941}} first studied order dimension; for a more detailed treatment of this subject than provided here, see {{harvtxt|Trotter|1992}}.\n\n==Formal definition==\nThe dimension of a poset ''P'' is the least integer ''t'' for which there exists a family \n\n:<math>\\mathcal R=(<_1,\\dots,<_t)</math>\n\nof [[linear extension]]s of ''P'' so that, for every ''x'' and ''y'' in ''P'', ''x'' precedes ''y'' in ''P'' if and only if it precedes ''y'' in each of the linear extensions. That is,\n\n:<math>P=\\bigcap\\mathcal R=\\bigcap_{i=1}^t <_i.</math>\n\nAn alternative definition of order dimension is as the minimal number of [[total order]]s such that ''P'' [[order-embedding|embeds]] to the product of these total orders for the [[componentwise order]]ing, in which <math>x \\leq y</math> if and only if <math>x_i \\leq y_i</math> for all ''i'' ({{harvnb|Hiraguti|1955}}, {{harvnb|Milner|Pouzet|1990}}).\n\n==Realizers==\nA family <math>\\mathcal R=(<_1,\\dots,<_t)</math> of linear orders on ''X'' is called a '''realizer''' of a poset ''P'' = (''X'', &lt;<sub>''P''</sub>) if \n:<math><_P = \\bigcap\\mathcal R</math>,\n\nwhich is to say that for any ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'',\n''x'' &lt;<sub>''P''</sub> ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &lt;<sub>1</sub> ''y'', ''x'' &lt;<sub>2</sub> ''y'', ..., and ''x'' &lt;<sub>''t''</sub> ''y''.\nThus, an equivalent definition of the dimension of a poset ''P'' is \"the least [[cardinality]] of a realizer of ''P''.\"\n\nIt can be shown that any nonempty family ''R'' of linear extensions is a realizer of a finite partially ordered set ''P'' if and only if, for every [[Critical pair (order theory)|critical pair]] (''x'',''y'') of ''P'',  ''y'' &lt;<sub>''i''</sub> ''x'' for some order\n&lt;<sub>''i''</sub> in ''R''.\n\n== Example ==\nLet ''n'' be a positive integer, and let ''P'' be the partial order on the elements ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''b<sub>i</sub>'' (for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'') in which ''a<sub>i</sub>'' ≤ ''b<sub>j</sub>'' whenever ''i'' ≠ ''j'', but no other pairs are comparable. In particular, ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''b<sub>i</sub>'' are incomparable in ''P''; ''P'' can be viewed as an oriented form of a [[crown graph]]. The illustration shows an ordering of this type for ''n'' = 4.\n\nThen, for each ''i'', any realizer must contain a linear order that begins with all the ''a<sub>j</sub>'' except ''a<sub>i</sub>'' (in some order), then includes ''b<sub>i</sub>'', then ''a<sub>i</sub>'', and ends with all the remaining ''b<sub>j</sub>''. This is so because if there were a realizer that didn't include such an order, then the intersection of that realizer's orders would have ''a<sub>i</sub>'' preceding ''b<sub>i</sub>'', which would contradict the incomparability  of ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''b<sub>i</sub>'' in ''P''. And conversely, any family of linear orders that includes one order of this type for each ''i'' has ''P'' as its intersection. Thus, ''P'' has dimension exactly ''n''.  In fact, ''P'' is known as the ''standard example'' of a poset of dimension ''n'', and is usually denoted by ''S<sub>n</sub>''.\n\n==Order dimension two==\nThe partial orders with order dimension two may be characterized as the partial orders whose [[comparability graph]] is the [[complement (graph theory)|complement]] of the comparability graph of a different partial order {{harv|Baker|Fishburn|Roberts|1971}}. That is, ''P'' is a partial order with order dimension two if and only if there exists a partial order ''Q'' on the same set of elements, such that every pair ''x'', ''y'' of distinct elements is comparable in exactly one of these two partial orders. If ''P'' is realized by two linear extensions, then partial order ''Q'' complementary to ''P'' may be realized by reversing one of the two linear extensions. Therefore, the comparability graphs of the partial orders of dimension two are exactly the [[permutation graph]]s, graphs that are both themselves comparability graphs and complementary to comparability graphs.\n\nThe partial orders of order dimension two include the [[series-parallel partial order]]s {{harv|Valdes|Tarjan|Lawler|1982}}. They are exactly the partial orders whose [[Hasse diagram]]s have [[dominance drawing]]s, which can be obtained by using the positions in the two permutations of a realizer as Cartesian coordinates.\n\n==Computational complexity==\nIt is possible to determine in [[polynomial time]] whether a given finite partially ordered set has order dimension at most two, for instance, by testing whether the comparability graph of the partial order is a permutation graph. However, for any ''k''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3, it is [[NP-complete]] to test whether the order dimension is at most ''k'' {{harv|Yannakakis|1982}}.\n\n==Incidence posets of graphs==\nThe [[incidence poset]] of any [[undirected graph]] ''G'' has the vertices and edges of ''G'' as its elements; in this poset, ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if either ''x'' = ''y'' or ''x'' is a vertex, ''y'' is an edge, and ''x'' is an endpoint of ''y''. Certain kinds of graphs may be characterized by the order dimensions of their incidence posets: a graph is a [[path graph]] if and only if the order dimension of its incidence poset is at most two, and according to [[Schnyder's theorem]] it is a [[planar graph]] if and only if the order dimension of its incidence poset is at most three {{harv|Schnyder|1989}}.\n\nFor a complete graph on ''n'' vertices, the order dimension of the incidence poset is <math>\\Theta(\\log\\log n)</math> {{harv|Hoşten|Morris|1999}}. It follows that all simple ''n''-vertex graphs have incidence posets with order dimension <math>O(\\log\\log n)</math>.\n\n== k-dimension and 2-dimension ==\n\nA generalization of dimension is the notion of ''k''-dimension (written <math>\\textrm{dim}_k</math>) which is the minimal number of [[chain (order theory)|chains]] of length at most ''k'' in whose product the partial order can be embedded. In particular, the 2-dimension of an order can be seen as the size of the smallest set such that the order embeds in the [[containment order]] on this set.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Interval dimension]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Baker | first1 = K.

As a consequence, any order embedding ''f'' restricts to an isomorphism between its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''S'' and its [[range (mathematics)|range]] ''f''(''S''), which justifies the term \"embedding\".<ref name=\"dp02\"/> On the other hand, it might well be that two (necessarily infinite) posets are mutually embeddable into each other without being isomorphic. An example is provided by the set of [[real number]]s and its [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [&minus;1,1]. Ordering both sets in the natural way, one clearly finds that [&minus;1,1] can be embedded into the reals. On the other hand, one can define a function ''e'' from the real numbers to [&minus;1,1] as<ref>For a very similar example using arctan to order embed the real numbers into an interval, see {{citation|title=Discovering Modern Set Theory: The basics|volume=8|series=Fields Institute Monographs|first1=Winfried|last1=Just|first2=Martin|last2=Weese|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1996|isbn=9780821872475|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPvHr7fcvHoC&pg=PA21}}.</ref>\n\n: <math>e(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan x</math>\n\nThis is the projection of the real number line to (half of) the circle with circumference 4 (see [[trigonometric function]]s for details) and embeds the reals into [&minus;1,1]. Yet, the two posets are not isomorphic: [&minus;1,1] has both a [[least element|least]] and a [[greatest element]], which are not present in the case of the real numbers. This shows that an isomorphism cannot exist.\n\nIn a retract  (a pair of order-preserving maps whose composition is the identity), the first of the two maps (called a coretraction) must be an order embedding.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Duffus | first1 = Dwight\n | last2 = Laflamme | first2 = Claude\n | last3 = Pouzet | first3 = Maurice\n | arxiv = math/0612458\n | doi = 10.1007/s00012-008-2125-6\n | issue = 1-2\n | journal = Algebra Universalis\n | mr = 2453498\n | pages = 243–255\n | title = Retracts of posets: the chain-gap property and the selection property are independent\n | volume = 59\n | year = 2008}}.</ref> However, not every order embedding is a coretraction. As a trivial example of this phenomenon, the unique order embedding from the empty poset to a nonempty poset ''P'' has no retract, because there is no order-preserving map from ''P'' to the empty poset. More illustratively, consider the \"diamond poset\" with elements {00, 01, 10, 11} with 00 < 01 < 11, 00 < 10 < 11 and 01 incomparable to 10. Consider the embedded sub-poset \"V\" consisting of {00, 01, 10} (with 00 < 01 and 00 < 10 and 01 incomparable to 10).  A retract of the embedding V -> diamond would need to send 11 to somewhere in \"V\" above both 01 and 10, but there is no such place.\n\n== Additional Perspectives ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\nPosets can straightforwardly be viewed from many perspectives, and order embeddings are basic enough that they tend to be visible from everywhere. For example:\n* (Model theoretically) A poset is a set equipped with a (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive) binary relation. An order embedding A -> B is an isomorphism from A to an [[elementary substructure]] of B.\n* (Graph theoretically) A poset is a (transitive, acyclic, directed, reflexive) graph. An order embedding A -> B is a [[graph isomorphism]] from A to an [[induced subgraph]] of B.\n* (Category theoretically) A poset is a (small, skeletal) category such that each homset has at most one element. An order embedding A -> B is a full and faithful functor from A to B which is injective on objects, or equivalently an isomorphism from A to a [[full subcategory]] of B.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Order theory]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''order topology''' is a certain [[topology]] that can be defined on any [[totally ordered set]].  It is a natural generalization of the topology of the [[real numbers]] to arbitrary totally ordered sets. <!-- why this restriction to totally ordered sets? Partial order relations generate nice non-Hausdorff counter-examples //-->\n\nIf ''X'' is a totally ordered set, the '''order topology''' on ''X'' is generated by the [[subbase]] of \"open rays\"\n:<math>(a, \\infty) = \\{ x \\mid a < x\\}</math>\n:<math>(-\\infty, b) = \\{x \\mid x < b\\}</math>\nfor all ''a,b'' in ''X''. This is equivalent to saying that the open [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s\n:<math>(a,b) = \\{x \\mid a < x < b\\}</math>\ntogether with the above rays form a [[base (topology)|base]] for the order topology. The open sets in ''X'' are the sets that are a [[union (set theory)|union]] of (possibly infinitely many) such open intervals and rays.\n\nA [[topological space]] ''X'' is called '''orderable''' if there exists a total order on its elements such that the order topology induced by that order and the given topology on ''X'' coincide. The order topology makes ''X'' into a [[completely normal space|completely normal]] [[Hausdorff space]].\n\nThe standard topologies on '''R''', '''Q''', '''Z''', and '''N''' are the order topologies.\n\n== Induced order topology ==\nIf ''Y'' is a subset of ''X'', then ''Y'' inherits a total order from ''X''. The set ''Y'' therefore has an order topology, the '''induced order topology'''.  As a subset of ''X'', ''Y'' also has a [[subspace topology]]. The subspace topology is always at least as [[finer topology|fine]] as the induced order topology, but they are not in general the same.\n\nFor example, consider the subset ''Y'' = {–1} &cup; {1/''n''}<sub>''n''&isin;'''N'''</sub> in the [[rational numbers|rationals]].  Under the subspace topology, the singleton set {–1} is open in ''Y'', but under the induced order topology, any open set containing –1 must contain all but finitely many members of the space.\n\n== An example of a subspace of a linearly ordered space whose topology is not an order topology ==\nThough the subspace topology of ''Y'' = {–1} &cup; {1/''n''}<sub>''n''&isin;'''N'''</sub> in the section above is shown to be not generated by the induced order on ''Y'', it is nonetheless an order topology on ''Y''; indeed, in the subspace topology every point is isolated (i.e., singleton {y} is open in ''Y'' for every y in ''Y''), so the subspace topology is the discrete topology on ''Y'' (the topology in which every subset of ''Y'' is an open set), and the discrete topology on any set is an order topology. To define a total order on ''Y'' that generates the discrete topology on ''Y'', simply modify the induced order on ''Y'' by defining -1 to be the greatest element of ''Y'' and otherwise keeping the same order for the other points, so that in this new order (call it say ''<''<sub>''1''</sub>) we have 1/''n'' ''<''<sub>''1''</sub> –1 for all ''n''&isin;'''N'''. Then, in the order topology on ''Y'' generated by ''<''<sub>''1''</sub>, every point of ''Y'' is isolated in ''Y''.\n\nWe wish to define here a subset ''Z'' of a linearly ordered topological space ''X'' such that no total order on ''Z'' generates the subspace topology on ''Z'', so that the subspace topology will not be an order topology even though it is the subspace topology of a space whose topology is an order topology.\n\nLet <math>Z = \\{-1\\}\\cup (0,1) </math> in the real line. The same argument as before shows that the subspace topology on Z is not equal to the induced order topology on Z, but one can show that the subspace topology on Z cannot be equal to any order topology on Z.\n\nAn argument follows. Suppose by way of contradiction that there is some [[Totally ordered set#Strict total order|strict total order]] < on Z such that the order topology generated by < is equal to the subspace topology on Z (note that we are not assuming that < is the induced order on Z, but rather an arbitrarily given total order on Z that generates the subspace topology).  In the following, interval notation should be interpreted relative to the < relation.  Also, if A and B are sets, <math> A<B </math>shall mean that <math> a<b </math> for each a in A and b in B.\n\nLet M=Z\\{-1}, the unit interval.  M is connected.  If m,n &isin; M and m<-1<n, then <math>(-\\infty, -1)</math> and <math>(-1, \\infty)</math> separate M, a contradiction.  Thus, M<{-1} or {-1}<M.  Assume without loss of generality that {-1}<M. Since {-1} is open in Z, there is some point p in M such that the interval (-1,p) is empty.  Since {-1}<M, -1 is the only element of Z that is less than p, so p is the minimum of M.  Then M\\{p} = A &cup; B, where A and B are nonempty open and disjoint connected subsets of M (removing a point from an open interval yields two open intervals). By connectedness, no point of Z\\B can lie between two points of B, and no point of Z\\A can lie between two points of A. Therefore, either A < B or B < A. Assume without loss of generality that A < B.  If a is any point in A, then p < a and (p,a)<math>\\subseteq</math> A.  Then (-1,a)=[p,a), so [p,a) is open.  {p}&cup;A=[p,a)&cup;A, so {p}&cup;A is an open subset of M and hence M = ({p}&cup;A) &cup; B is the union of two disjoint open subsets of M so M is not connected, a contradiction.\n\n==Left and right order topologies==\nSeveral variants of the order topology can be given:\n\n* The '''right order topology''' on ''X'' is the topology whose open sets consist of intervals of the form (''a'', &infin;) (including (-&infin;, &infin;)).<ref>Steen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkEuGkOtSrUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 74].</ref>\n* The '''left order topology''' on ''X'' is the topology whose open sets consist of intervals of the form (&minus;&infin;, ''b'') (including (-&infin;, &infin;)).\n\nThe left and right order topologies can be used to give counterexamples in general topology.  For example, the left or right order topology on a bounded set provides an example of a [[compact space]] that is not Hausdorff.\n\nThe left order topology is the standard topology used for many set-theoretic purposes on a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].\n\n==Ordinal space==\n\nFor any [[ordinal number]] &lambda; one can consider the spaces of ordinal numbers\n:<math>[0,\\lambda) = \\{\\alpha \\mid \\alpha < \\lambda\\}</math>\n:<math>[0,\\lambda] = \\{\\alpha \\mid \\alpha \\le \\lambda\\}</math>\ntogether with the natural order topology. These spaces are called '''ordinal spaces'''. (Note that in the usual set-theoretic construction of ordinal numbers we have &lambda; = [0,&lambda;) and &lambda; + 1 = [0,&lambda;]). Obviously, these spaces are mostly of interest when &lambda; is an infinite ordinal; otherwise (for finite ordinals), the order topology is simply the [[discrete topology]].\n\nWhen &lambda; = &omega; (the first infinite ordinal), the space [0,&omega;) is just '''N''' with the usual (still discrete) topology, while [0,&omega;] is the [[one-point compactification]] of '''N'''.\n\nOf particular interest is the case when &lambda; = &omega;<sub>1</sub>, the set of all countable ordinals, and the [[first uncountable ordinal]]. The element &omega;<sub>1</sub> is a [[limit point]] of the subset [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>) even though no sequence of elements in [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>) has the element &omega;<sub>1</sub> as its limit. In particular, [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>] is not [[First-countable space|first-countable]]. The subspace [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>) is first-countable however, since the only point without a countable [[local base]] is &omega;<sub>1</sub>. Some further properties include\n*neither [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>) or [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>] is [[separable space|separable]] or [[second-countable]]\n*[0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>] is [[compact space|compact]] while [0,&omega;<sub>1</sub>) is [[Sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]] and [[Countably compact space|countably compact]], but not compact or [[paracompact]]\n\n== Topology and ordinals ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ordinal number]] -->\n\n=== Ordinals as topological spaces ===\nAny [[ordinal number]] can be made into a [[topological space]] by endowing it with the order topology (since, being well-ordered, an ordinal is in particular [[total order|totally ordered]]): in the absence of indication to the contrary, it is always that order topology that is meant when an ordinal is thought of as a topological space.  (Note that if we are willing to accept a proper class as a topological space, then the class of all ordinals is also a topological space for the order topology.)\n\nThe set of [[limit point]]s of an ordinal α is precisely the set of [[limit ordinal]]s less than α.  Successor ordinals (and zero) less than α are [[isolated point]]s in α.  In particular, the finite ordinals and ω are [[discrete space|discrete]] topological spaces, and no ordinal beyond that is discrete.  The ordinal α is [[compact space|compact]] as a topological space if and only if α is a [[successor ordinal]].\n \nThe closed sets of a limit ordinal α are just the closed sets in the sense that we have [[#Closed unbounded sets and classes|already defined]], namely, those that contain a limit ordinal whenever they contain all sufficiently large ordinals below it.\n\nAny ordinal is, of course, an open subset of any further ordinal.  We can also define the topology on the ordinals in the following inductive way: 0 is the empty topological space, α+1 is obtained by taking the [[Compactification (mathematics)|one-point compactification]] of α, and for δ a limit ordinal, δ is equipped with the [[direct limit|inductive limit]] topology. Note that if α is a successor ordinal, then α is compact, in which case its one-point compactification α+1 is the disjoint union of α and a point.\n\nAs topological spaces, all the ordinals are [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and even [[normal space|normal]].  They are also [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] (connected components are points), [[scattered space|scattered]] (every non-empty set has an isolated point; in this case, just take the smallest element), [[zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] (the topology has a clopen basis: here, write an open interval (β,γ) as the union of the clopen intervals (β,γ'+1)=<nowiki>[</nowiki>β+1,γ'<nowiki>]</nowiki> for γ'<γ).  However, they are not [[extremally disconnected space|extremally disconnected]] in general (there are open sets, for example the even numbers from ω, whose closure is not open).\n\nThe topological spaces ω<sub>1</sub> and its successor ω<sub>1</sub>+1 are frequently used as text-book examples of non-countable topological spaces.\nFor example, in the topological space ω<sub>1</sub>+1, the element ω<sub>1</sub> is in the closure of the subset ω<sub>1</sub> even though no sequence of elements in ω<sub>1</sub> has the element ω<sub>1</sub> as its limit: an element in ω<sub>1</sub> is a countable set; for any sequence of such sets, the union of these sets is the union of countably many countable sets, so still countable; this union is an upper bound of the elements of the sequence, and therefore of the limit of the sequence, if it has one.\n\nThe space ω<sub>1</sub> is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], but not [[second-countable space|second-countable]], and ω<sub>1</sub>+1 has neither of these two properties, despite being [[compact space|compact]].  It is also worthy of note that any continuous function from ω<sub>1</sub> to '''R''' (the [[real line]]) is eventually constant: so the [[Compactification (mathematics)|Stone-Čech compactification]] of ω<sub>1</sub> is ω<sub>1</sub>+1, just as its one-point compactification (in sharp contrast to ω, whose Stone-Čech compactification is much ''larger'' than ω).\n\n=== Ordinal-indexed sequences ===\nIf α is a limit ordinal and ''X'' is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' merely means a function from α to ''X''.  This concept, a '''transfinite sequence''' or '''ordinal-indexed sequence''', is a generalization of the concept of a [[sequence]]. An ordinary sequence corresponds to the case α = ω.\n\nIf ''X'' is a topological space, we say that an α-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' ''converges'' to a limit ''x'' when it converges as a [[net (mathematics)|net]], in other words, when given any neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' there is an ordinal β<α such that ''x''<sub>ι</sub> is in ''U'' for all ι≥β.\n\nOrdinal-indexed sequences are more powerful than ordinary (ω-indexed) sequences to determine limits in topology: for example, ω<sub>1</sub> ([[Ordinal number#Initial ordinal of a cardinal|omega-one]], the set of all countable ordinal numbers, and the smallest uncountable ordinal number), is a limit point of ω<sub>1</sub>+1 (because it is a limit ordinal), and, indeed, it is the limit of the ω<sub>1</sub>-indexed sequence which maps any ordinal less than ω<sub>1</sub> to itself: however, it is not the limit of any ordinary (ω-indexed) sequence in ω<sub>1</sub>, since any such limit is less than or equal to the union of its elements, which is a countable union of countable sets, hence itself countable.\n\nHowever, ordinal-indexed sequences are not powerful enough to replace nets (or [[filter (mathematics)|filters]]) in general: for example, on the [[Tychonoff plank]] (the product space <math>(\\omega_1+1)\\times(\\omega+1)</math>), the corner point <math>(\\omega_1,\\omega)</math> is a limit point (it is in the closure) of the open subset <math>\\omega_1\\times\\omega</math>, but it is not the limit of an ordinal-indexed sequence.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lower limit topology]]\n*[[Long line (topology)]]\n*[[Linear continuum]]\n*[[Partially ordered space]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* [[Lynn Arthur Steen|Steen, Lynn A.]] and [[J.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''ordered pair''' (''a'', ''b'') is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair (''a'', ''b'') is different from the ordered pair (''b'', ''a'') unless ''a'' = ''b''.  (In contrast, the [[unordered pair]] {''a'', ''b''} equals the unordered pair {''b'', ''a''}.)\n\nOrdered pairs are also called [[tuple|2-tuples]], or [[sequence]]s (sometimes, lists in a computer science context) of length 2; ordered pairs of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] are also called 2-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]].\nThe entries of an ordered pair can be other ordered pairs, enabling the recursive definition of ordered [[n-tuple|''n''-tuple]]s (ordered lists of ''n'' objects). For example, the ordered triple (''a'',''b'',''c'') can be defined as (''a'', (''b'',''c'')), i.e., as one pair nested in another.\n\nIn the ordered pair (''a'', ''b''), the object ''a'' is called the ''first entry'', and the object ''b'' the ''second entry'' of the pair. Alternatively, the objects are called the first and second ''components'', the first and second ''coordinates'', or the left and right ''projections'' of the ordered pair.\n\n[[Cartesian product]]s and [[binary relation]]s (and hence [[function (mathematics)|functions]]) are defined in terms of ordered pairs.\n\n==Generalities==\nLet <math>(a_1, b_1)</math> and <math>(a_2, b_2)</math> be ordered pairs. Then the ''characteristic'' (or ''defining'') ''property'' of the ordered pair is:\n\n:<math>(a_1, b_1) = (a_2, b_2)\\text{  if and only if  } a_1 = a_2\\text{ and }b_1 = b_2.</math>\n\nThe [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all ordered pairs whose first entry is in some set ''A'' and whose second entry is in some set ''B'' is called the [[Cartesian product]] of ''A'' and ''B'', and written ''A'' × ''B''. A [[binary relation]] between sets ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'' × ''B''.\n\nThe {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} notation may be used for other purposes, most notably as denoting [[open interval]]s on the [[real number line]]. In such situations, the context will usually make it clear which meaning is intended.<ref>{{citation|first=Steven R.|last=Lay|title=Analysis / With an Introduction to Proof|edition=4th|publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-148101-5|year=2005|page=50}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=Sets, Functions and Logic / An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Chapman & Hall / CRC|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1|page=79}}</ref> For additional clarification, the ordered pair may be denoted by the variant notation <math display=\"inline\"> \\langle a,b\\rangle</math>, but this notation also has other uses.\n\n<span id=\"projection\"></span>\nThe left and right projection of a pair ''p'' is usually denoted by {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''p'') and {{pi}}<sub>2</sub>(''p''), or by {{pi}}<sub>''ℓ''</sub>(''p'') and {{pi}}<sub>''r''</sub>(''p''), respectively.\nIn contexts where arbitrary ''n''-tuples are considered, {{pi}}{{su|p=''n''|b=''i''}}(''t'') is a common notation for the ''i''-th component of an ''n''-tuple ''t''.\n\n==Informal and formal definitions==\n\nIn some introductory mathematics textbooks an informal (or intuitive) definition of ordered pair is given, such as\n<blockquote>\nFor any two objects {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, the ordered pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is a notation specifying the two objects {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, in that order.<ref name=Wolf>{{citation|first=Robert S.|last=Wolf|title=Proof, Logic, and Conjecture / The Mathematician's Toolbox|publisher=W.

However, as is sometimes pointed out, no harm will come from relying on this description and almost everyone thinks of ordered pairs in this manner.<ref>{{citation|first1=Peter|last1=Fletcher|first2=C. Wayne|last2=Patty|title=Foundations of Higher Mathematics|publisher=PWS-Kent|year=1988|isbn=0-87150-164-3|page=80}}</ref>\n\nA more satisfactory approach is to observe that the characteristic property of ordered pairs given above is all that is required to understand the role of ordered pairs in mathematics. Hence the ordered pair can be taken as a [[primitive notion]], whose associated axiom is the characteristic property. This was the approach taken by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|N. Bourbaki]] group in its ''Theory of Sets'', published in 1954. However, this approach also has its drawbacks as both the existence of ordered pairs and their characteristic property must be axiomatically assumed.<ref name=Wolf />\n\nAnother way to rigorously deal with ordered pairs is to define them formally in the context of set theory. This can be done in several ways and has the advantage that existence and the characteristic property can be proven from the axioms that define the set theory. One of the most cited versions of this definition is due to Kuratowski (see below) and his definition was used in the second edition of Bourbaki's ''Theory of Sets'', published in 1970. Even those mathematical textbooks that give an informal definition of ordered pairs will often mention the formal definition of Kuratowski in an exercise.\n\n==Defining the ordered pair using set theory==\n\nIf one agrees that [[set theory]] is an appealing [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]], then all mathematical objects must be defined as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of some sort. Hence if the ordered pair is not taken as primitive, it must be defined as a set.<ref>[[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]] has argued that the set-theoretical implementations of the concept of the ordered pair   is a paradigm for the clarification of philosophical  ideas (see  \"[[Word and Object]]\", section 53).\nThe general notion of such definitions or implementations  are discussed in Thomas Forster \"Reasoning about theoretical entities\".\n</ref> Several set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair are given below.\n\n===Wiener's definition===\n[[Norbert Wiener]] proposed the first set theoretical definition of the ordered pair in 1914:<ref>Wiener's paper \"A Simplification of the logic of relations\" is reprinted, together with a valuable commentary on pages 224ff in van Heijenoort, Jean (1967), ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1979–1931'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, {{isbn|0-674-32449-8}} (pbk.). van Heijenoort states the simplification this way: \"By giving a definition of the ordered pair of two elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes\".</ref>\n:<math>\\left( a, b \\right) := \n\\left\\{\\left\\{ \\left\\{a\\right\\},\\, \\emptyset \\right\\},\\,  \\left\\{\\left\\{b\\right\\}\\right\\}\\right\\}.</math>\nHe observed that this definition made it possible to define the [[type theory|types]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' as sets. ''Principia Mathematica'' had taken types, and hence [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] of all arities, as [[primitive notion|primitive]].\n\nWiener used <nowiki>{{</nowiki>''b''}} instead of {''b''} to make the definition compatible with [[type theory]] where all elements in a class must be of the same \"type\".

(However, if ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b'' then the '''short''' version keeps having cardinality 2, which is something one might expect of any \"pair\", including any \"ordered pair\".

McGraw–Hill.</ref> employed a definition of the ordered pair due to [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]] which requires a prior definition of the [[natural number]]s. Let <math>\\N</math> be the set of natural numbers and define first\n:<math>\\sigma(x) := \\begin{cases}\n      x, & \\text{if }x \\not\\in \\N, \\\\\n      x+1, & \\text{if }x \\in \\N.\n    \\end{cases}</math>\n<math>\\sigma</math> increments its argument, if it is a natural number and leaves it as is otherwise. Note: 0 does not appear as functional value of <math>\\sigma</math>.\nAs <math>x \\smallsetminus \\N</math> is the set of the elements of <math>x</math> not in <math>\\N</math> go on with\n:<math>\\varphi(x) := \\sigma[x] = \\{\\sigma(\\alpha)\\mid\\alpha \\in x\\} = (x \\smallsetminus \\N) \\cup \\{n+1 : n \\in (x \\cap \\N) \\}.</math>\nThis is the (elementwise) [[Image (mathematics)#Other terminology|image]] of a set <math>x</math> under <math>\\varphi</math>, sometimes denoted by <math>\\sigma''x</math> as well. Applying this function to a set ''x'' simply increments every natural number in it. In particular, <math>\\varphi(x)</math> does never contain the number 0, so that for any sets ''x'' and ''y'',\n:<math>\\varphi(x) \\neq \\{0\\} \\cup \\varphi(y).</math>\nFurther, define\n:<math>\\psi(x) := \\sigma[x] \\cup \\{0\\} = \\varphi(x) \\cup \\{0\\}.</math>\nBy this, <math>\\psi(x)</math> does always contain the number 0.\n\nFinally, define the ordered pair (''A'', ''B'') as the disjoint union\n:<math>(A, B) := \\varphi[A] \\cup \\psi[B] = \\{\\varphi(a) : a \\in A\\} \\cup \\{\\varphi(b) \\cup \\{0\\} : b \\in B \\}.</math>\n(which is <math>\\varphi''A \\cup \\psi''B</math> in alternate notation).\n\nExtracting all the elements of the pair that do not contain 0 and undoing <math>\\varphi</math> yields ''A''. Likewise, ''B'' can be recovered from the elements of the pair that do contain 0.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ Holmes, M.

Hence this definition has the advantage of enabling a [[function (mathematics)|function]], defined as a set of ordered pairs, to have a type only 1 higher than the type of its arguments. This definition works only if the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is the case in [[New Foundations|NF]], but not in [[type theory]] or in [[New Foundations|NFU]]. [[J. Barkley Rosser]] showed that the existence of such a type-level ordered pair (or even a \"type-raising by 1\" ordered pair) implies the [[axiom of infinity]].

(The Kuratowski definition does not allow this.) He first defined ordered pairs whose projections are sets in Kuratowski's manner. He then ''redefined'' the pair\n\n:<math> (x, y) = (\\{0\\} \\times s(x)) \\cup (\\{1\\} \\times s(y))</math>\n\nwhere the component Cartesian products are Kuratowski pairs of sets and where\n\n:<math> s(x) = \\{\\emptyset \\} \\cup \\{\\{t\\} \\mid t \\in x\\} </math>\n\nThis renders possible pairs whose projections are proper classes. The Quine–Rosser definition above  also admits [[proper class]]es as projections. Similarly the triple is defined as a 3-tuple as follows:\n\n:<math> (x, y, z) = (\\{0\\} \\times s(x)) \\cup (\\{1\\} \\times s(y)) \\cup (\\{2\\} \\times s(z))</math>\n\nThe use of the singleton set <math> s(x) </math> which has an inserted empty set allows tuples to have the uniqueness property that if ''a'' is an ''n''-tuple and b is an ''m''-tuple and ''a'' = ''b'' then ''n'' = ''m''.  Ordered triples which are defined as ordered pairs do not have this property with respect to ordered pairs.\n\n==Category theory==\nA category-theoretic [[Product (category theory)|product]] ''A'' × ''B'' in a [[category of sets]] represents the set of ordered pairs, with the first element coming from ''A'' and the second coming from ''B''. In this context the characteristic property above is a consequence of the [[universal property]] of the product and the fact that elements of a set ''X'' can be identified with morphisms from 1 (a one element set) to ''X''. While different objects may have the universal property, they are all [[naturally isomorphic]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Mathematical logic}}\n\n[[Category:Basic concepts in set theory]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Type theory]]"

To begin with, not every partial cyclic order can be extended to a total cyclic order. An example is the following relation on the first thirteen letters of the alphabet: {''acd, bde, cef, dfg, egh, fha, gac, hcb''} ∪ {''abi, cij, bjk, ikl, jlm, kma, lab, mbc''} ∪ {''hcm, bhm''}. This relation is a partial cyclic order, but it cannot be extended with either ''abc'' or ''cba''; either attempt would result in a contradiction.{{sfn|Megiddo|1976|pp=274–275}}\n\nThe above was a relatively mild example. One can also construct partial cyclic orders with higher-order obstructions such that, for example, any 15 triples can be added but the 16th cannot. In fact, cyclic ordering is [[NP-complete]], since it solves [[3SAT]]. This is in stark contrast with the recognition problem for linear orders, which can be solved in [[linear time]].{{sfn|Megiddo|1976|pp=275–276}}{{sfn|Galil|Megiddo|1977|p=179}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|22em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation |last=Galil |first=Zvi |authorlink=Zvi Galil|last2=Megiddo |first2=Nimrod|author2-link=Nimrod Megiddo |date=October 1977 |title=Cyclic ordering is NP-complete |journal=[[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|Theoretical Computer Science]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=179–182 |doi=10.1016/0304-3975(77)90005-6 |url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~megiddo/pdf/cyc-npc.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2011}}\n*{{Citation |last=Megiddo |first=Nimrod |authorlink=Nimrod Megiddo|date=March 1976 |title=Partial and complete cyclic orders |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=274–276 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14020-7 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1976-82-02/S0002-9904-1976-14020-7/S0002-9904-1976-14020-7.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2011}}\n*{{Citation |last=Novák |first=Vítězslav |year=1982 |title=Cyclically ordered sets |journal=Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=460–473 |hdl=10338.dmlcz/101821 |url=http://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/101821/CzechMathJ_32-1982-3_12.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2011}}\n*{{Citation |last=Novák |first=Vítězslav |last2=Novotný |first2=Miroslav |year=1984a |title=On a power of cyclically ordered sets |journal=Časopis pro pěstování matematiky |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=421–424 |hdl=10338.dmlcz/118209 |url=http://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/118209/CasPestMat_109-1984-4_7.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2011}}\n*{{Citation |last=Novák |first=Vítězslav |last2=Novotný |first2=Miroslav |year=1984b |title=Universal cyclically ordered sets |journal=Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=158–161 |hdl=10338.dmlcz/102004 |url=http://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/102004/CzechMathJ_35-1985-1_11.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2011}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation |last=Alles |first=Peter |last2=Nešetřil |first2=Jaroslav |last3=Poljak |first3=Svatopluck |year=1991 |title=Extendability, Dimensions, and Diagrams of Cyclic Orders |journal=[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=453–471 |doi=10.1137/0404041}}\n*{{Citation |last=Bandelt |first=Hans–Jürgen |last2=Chepoi |first2=Victor |last3=Eppstein |first3=David |author3-link=David Eppstein|year=2010 |title=Combinatorics and geometry of finite and infinite squaregraphs |journal=[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]]  |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=1399–1440 |doi=10.1137/090760301 |url=http://epub.sub.uni-hamburg.de/epub/volltexte/2009/3280/pdf/0905.4537v1.pdf |accessdate=23 May 2011 |arxiv=0905.4537}}\n*{{Citation |last=Chajda |first=Ivan |last2=Novák |first2=Vítězslav |year=1985 |title=On extensions of cyclic orders |journal=Časopis pro pěstování matematiky |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=116–121 |hdl=10338.dmlcz/108597 |url=http://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/108597/CasPestMat_110-1985-2_2.pdf |accessdate=30 April 2011}}\n*{{Citation |last=Fishburn |first=P.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially [[order theory]], a '''prefix ordered set''' generalizes the intuitive concept of a [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] by introducing the possibility of continuous progress and continuous branching. Natural prefix orders often occur when considering [[dynamical systems]] as a set of functions from ''time'' (a [[totally-ordered set]]) to some [[phase space]]. In this case, the elements of the set are usually referred to as ''executions'' of the system.\n\nThe name ''prefix order'' stems from the prefix order on words, which is a special kind of [[substring]] relation and, because of its discrete character, a tree.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\nA '''prefix order''' is a [[binary relation]] \"≤\" over  a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''P'' which is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], and '''downward total''', i.e., for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''P'', we have that:\n\n*''a ≤ a'' (reflexivity);\n*if ''a ≤ b'' and ''b ≤ a'' then ''a'' = ''b'' (antisymmetry);\n*if ''a ≤ b'' and ''b ≤ c'' then ''a ≤ c'' (transitivity);\n*if ''a ≤ c'' and ''b ≤ c'' then ''a ≤ b'' or ''b ≤ a'' (downward totality).\n\n== Functions between prefix orders ==\n\nWhile between partial orders it is usual to consider [[order-preserving function]]s, the most important type of functions between prefix orders are so-called '''history preserving''' functions. Given a prefix ordered set ''P'', a '''history''' of a point ''p∈P'' is the (by definition totally ordered) set ''p- ≜ {q | q ≤ p}''. A function ''f : P → Q'' between prefix orders P and Q is then '''history preserving''' if and only if for every ''p∈P'' we find ''f(p-) = f(p)-''. Similarly, a '''future''' of a point ''p∈P'' is the (prefix ordered) set ''p+ ≜ {q | p ≤ q}'' and ''f'' is future preserving if for all ''p∈P'' we find ''f(p+) = f(p)+''.\n\nEvery history preserving function and every future preserving function is also order preserving, but not vice versa.\nIn the theory of dynamical systems, history preserving maps capture the intuition that the behavior in one system is a ''refinement'' of the behavior in another. Furthermore, functions that are history and future preserving [[surjective function|surjections]] capture the notion of [[bisimulation]] between systems, and thus the intuition that a given refinement is ''correct'' with respect to a specification.\n\nThe [[range (mathematics)|range]] of a history preserving function is always a [[prefix closed]] subset, where a subset ''S ⊆ P'' is '''prefix closed''' if for all ''s,t ∈ P'' with ''t∈S'' and ''s≤t'' we find ''s∈S''.\n\n== Product and union ==\n\nTaking history preserving maps as ''morphisms'' in the [[category theory|category]] of prefix orders leads to a notion of product that is ''not'' the Cartesian product of the two orders since the Cartesian product is not always a prefix order. Instead, it leads to an ''arbitrary interleaving'' of the original prefix orders. The union of two prefix orders is the [[disjoint union]], as it is with partial orders.\n\n== Isomorphism ==\n\nAny bijective history preserving function is an [[order isomorphism]]. Furthermore, if for a given prefix ordered set ''P'' we construct the set ''P- ≜ { p- | p∈ P}'' we find that this set is prefix ordered by the subset relation ⊆, and furthermore, that the function ''max : P- → P'' is an isomorphism, where ''max(S)'' returns for each set ''S∈P-'' the maximum element in terms of the order on P (i.e. ''max(p-) ≜ p'').\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite news|first=Pieter|last=Cuijpers|title=Prefix Orders as a General Model of Dynamics|journal=Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models (DCM)|pages=25–29|year=2013|url=http://www.dcm-workshop.org.uk/2013/dcm-2013-pre-proc.pdf#page=30}}\n* {{cite news|first=Pieter|last=Cuijpers|title=The Categorical Limit of a Sequence of Dynamical Systems|journal=EPTCS 120 : Proceedings EXPRESS/SOS 2013|pages=78–92|year=2013|doi=10.4204/EPTCS.120.7}}\n* {{cite news|last1=Ferlez|first1=James|last2=Cleaveland|first2=Rance|last3=Marcus|first3=Steve|title=Generalized Synchronization Trees|journal=LLNCS 8412: Proceedings of FOSSACS'14|date=2014|pages=304–319|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-54830-7_20}}\n\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Trees (data structures)]]\n[[Category:Dynamical systems]]"

The usual [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy law]] does not hold in the constructive continuum because of its [[indecomposability]], so this condition is weakened. \n\nA pseudo-order is a [[binary relation]] satisfying the following conditions:\n# It is not possible for two elements to each be less than the other. That is, <math>\\forall x,y: \\neg\\;(x < y \\;\\wedge\\; y < x)</math>.\n# For all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}}, if {{math|''x'' < ''y''}} then either {{math|''x'' < ''z''}} or {{math|''z'' < ''y''}}.

That is, <math>\\forall x,y: \\neg\\;(x < y \\;\\vee\\; y < x) \\;\\to\\; x = y</math>\nThis first condition is simply [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]. It follows from the first two conditions that a pseudo-order is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The second condition is often called ''co-transitivity'' or ''comparison'' and is the constructive substitute for trichotomy. In general, given two elements of a pseudo-ordered set, it is not always the case that either one is less than the other or else they are equal, but given any nontrivial interval, any element is either above the lower bound, or below the upper bound.\n\nThe third condition is often taken as the definition of equality. The natural [[apartness relation]] on a pseudo-ordered set is given by\n: <math>x \\# y \\;\\leftrightarrow\\; x < y \\;\\vee\\; y < x</math>\nand equality is defined by the negation of apartness.\n\nThe negation of the pseudo-order is a [[partial order]] which is close to a [[total order]]: if ''x'' ≤ ''y'' is defined as the negation of ''y'' < ''x'', then we have\n: <math> \\neg\\;(\\neg\\;(x \\le y) \\;\\wedge\\; \\neg\\;(y \\le x)) .</math>\nUsing [[classical logic]] one would then conclude that ''x'' ≤ ''y'' or ''y'' ≤ ''x'', so it would be a total order. However, this inference is not valid in the constructive case.\n\nThe prototypical pseudo-order is that of the real numbers: one real number is less than another if [[there exists]] (one can construct) a rational number greater than the former and less than the latter. In other words, ''x'' < ''y'' if there exists a rational number ''z'' such that ''x'' < ''z'' < ''y''.\n\n==References==\n* [[Arend Heyting]] (1966) Intuitionism: An introduction.

      "text": "In mathematics, the concept of a '''residuated mapping''' arises in the theory of [[partially ordered set]]s.  It refines the concept of a [[monotonic function|monotone function]].\n\nIf ''A'', ''B'' are [[Partially ordered sets|posets]], a function ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' is defined to be monotone if it is order-preserving: that is, if ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''y'' implies ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''f''(''y''). This is equivalent to the condition that the [[preimage]] under ''f'' of every [[down-set]] of ''B'' is a down-set of ''A''.  We define a [[principal down-set]] to be one of the form ↓{''b''} = { ''b''<nowiki>'</nowiki> ∈ ''B'' : ''b''<nowiki>'</nowiki> ≤ ''b'' }.  In general the preimage under ''f'' of a principal down-set need not be a principal down-set. If it is, ''f'' is called '''residuated'''.\n\nThe notion of residuated map can be generalized to a [[binary operator]] (or any higher [[arity]]) via component-wise residuation. This approach gives rise to notions of left and right division in a partially ordered [[magma (algebra)|magma]], additionally endowing it with a [[quasigroup]] structure. (One speaks only of residuated algebra for higher arities). A binary (or higher arity) residuated map is usually ''not'' residuated as a unary map.<ref>Denecke, p. 95; Galatos, p. 148</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nIf ''A'', ''B'' are posets, a function ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' is '''residuated''' if and only if the preimage under ''f'' of every principal down-set of ''B'' is a principal down-set of ''A''.\n\n==Consequences==\nWith ''A'', ''B'' posets, the set of functions ''A'' → ''B'' can be ordered by the [[pointwise order]] ''f'' ≤ ''g'' ↔ (∀''x'' ∈ A) ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'').\n\nIt can be shown that ''f'' is residuated if and only if there exists a (necessarily unique) monotone function ''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup>: ''B'' → ''A'' such that ''f''&nbsp;<small>o</small>&nbsp;''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup> ≤ id<sub>B</sub> and ''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup>&nbsp;<small>o</small>&nbsp;''f'' ≥ id<sub>A</sub>, where id is the [[identity function]]. The function ''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup> is the '''residual''' of ''f''. A residuated function and its residual form a [[Galois connection]] under the (more recent) monotone definition of that concept, and for every (monotone) Galois connection the lower adjoints is residuated with the residual being the upper adjoint.<ref>Erné, Proposition 4</ref> Therefore, the notions of monotone Galois connection and residuated mapping essentially coincide.\n\nAdditionally, we have ''f''<sup>&nbsp;-1</sup>(↓{''b''}) = ↓{''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup>(''b'')}. <!-- we need a more complete characterization -->\n\nIf ''B''° denotes the [[order dual]] (opposite poset) to ''B'' then ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is a residuated mapping if and only if ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''° and ''f''<sup>&nbsp;*</sup>: ''B''° → ''A'' form a [[Galois connection]] under the original [[antitone]] definition of this notion.\n\nIf ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' and ''g'' : ''B'' → ''C'' are residuated mappings, then so is the [[function composition]] ''fg'' : ''A'' → ''C'', with residual (''fg'')<sup>&nbsp;+</sup> = ''g''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup>''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup>. The antitone Galois connections do not share this property.\n\nThe set of monotone transformations (functions) over a poset is an [[ordered monoid]] with the pointwise order, and so is the set of residuated transformations.<ref>Blyth, 2005, p. 193</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n* The [[ceiling function]] <math>x \\mapsto \\lceil x \\rceil </math> from '''R''' to '''Z''' (with the usual order in each case) is residuated, with residual mapping the natural embedding of '''Z''' into '''R'''.\n* The embedding of '''Z''' into '''R''' is also residuated.  Its residual is the [[floor function]] <math>x \\mapsto \\lfloor x \\rfloor</math>.\n\n== Residuated binary operators ==\nIf • : ''P'' × ''Q''  → ''R'' is a binary map and ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' are posets, then one may define residuation component-wise for the left and right translations, i.e. multiplication by a fixed element. For an element ''x'' in ''P'' define ''<sub>x</sub>λ''(''y'') = ''x'' • ''y'', and for ''x'' in ''Q'' define ''λ<sub>x</sub>''(''y'') = ''y''  • ''x''. Then • is said to be residuated if and only if ''<sub>x</sub>λ'' and ''λ<sub>x</sub>'' are residuated for all ''x'' (in ''P'' and respectively ''Q''). Left (and resp. right) division are defined by taking the residuals of the left (and resp. right) translations: ''x''\\''y'' = ''(<sub>x</sub>λ)<sup>+</sup>''(''y'') and ''x''/''y'' = ''(λ<sub>x</sub>)<sup>+</sup>''(''y'')\n\nFor example, every [[ordered group]] is residuated, and the division defined by the above coincides with notion of [[Group (mathematics)#Division|division in a group]]. A less trivial example is the set Mat<sub>n</sub>('''''B''''') of square matrices over a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|boolean algebra]] '''''B''''', where the matrices are ordered [[pointwise]]. The pointwise order endows Mat<sub>n</sub>('''''B''''') with pointwise meets, joins and complements. [[Matrix multiplication]] is defined in the usual manner with the \"product\" being a meet, and the \"sum\" a join. It can be shown<ref>Blyth, p. 198</ref> that ''X''\\''Y'' = (Y<sup>t</sup>''X''’)’ and ''X''/''Y'' = (''X''’Y<sup>t</sup>)’, where (X’ is the complement of X, and Y<sup>t</sup> is the [[transposed matrix]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Residuated lattice]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* J.C.

      "text": "In [[graph theory]], '''Schnyder's theorem''' is a characterization of [[planar graph]]s in terms\nof the [[order dimension]] of their [[incidence poset]]s. It is named after Walter Schnyder, who published its proof in [[#{{harvid|Schnyder|1989}}|1989]].\n\nThe incidence poset {{math|''P''(''G'')}} of an [[undirected graph]] {{mvar|G}} with [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] set {{mvar|V}} and [[graph theory|edge]] set {{mvar|E}} is the [[partially ordered set]] of [[Antichain#Height and width|height]] 2 that has {{math|''V'' ∪ ''E''}} as its elements. In this partial order, there is an order relation {{math|''x'' < ''y''}} when {{mvar|x}} is a vertex, {{mvar|y}} is an edge, and {{mvar|x}} is one of the two endpoints of {{mvar|y}}.\n\nThe order dimension of a partial order is the smallest number of total orderings whose intersection is the given partial order; such a set of orderings is called a ''realizer'' of the partial order.\nSchnyder's theorem states that a graph {{mvar|G}} is planar if and only if the order dimension of {{math|''P''(''G'')}} is at most three.\n\n== Extensions ==\nThis theorem has been generalized by {{harvs|last1=Brightwell|last2=Trotter|year=1993|year2=1997|txt}} to a tight bound on the dimension of the height-three partially ordered sets formed analogously from the vertices, edges and faces of a [[convex polyhedron]], or more generally of an embedded planar graph: in both cases, the order dimension of the poset is at most four. However, this result cannot be generalized to higher-dimensional [[convex polytope]]s, as there exist four-dimensional polytopes whose [[face lattice]]s have unbounded order dimension.\n\nEven more generally, for [[abstract simplicial complex]]es, the order dimension of the face poset of the complex is at most {{math|1 + ''d''}}, where {{mvar|d}} is the minimum dimension of a [[Euclidean space]] in which the complex has a geometric realization {{harvs|last=Ossona de Mendez|year=1999|year2=2002}}.\n\n==Other graphs==\nAs Schnyder observes, the incidence poset of a graph ''G'' has order dimension two if and only if the graph is a path or a subgraph of a path. For, in when an incidence poset has order dimension is two, its only possible realizer consists of two total orders that (when restricted to the graph's vertices) are the reverse of each other. Any other two orders would have an intersection that includes an order relation between two vertices, which is not allowed for incidence posets. For these two orders on the vertices, an edge between consecutive vertices can be included in the ordering by placing it immediately following the later of the two edge endpoints, but no other edges can be included.\n\nIf a graph can be [[graph coloring|colored]] with four colors, then its incidence poset has order dimension at most four {{harv|Schnyder|1989}}.\n\nThe incidence poset of a [[complete graph]] on ''n'' vertices has order dimension <math>\\Theta(\\log\\log n)</math> {{harv|Spencer|1971}}.\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|first1=G.|last1=Brightwell|first2=W.

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\nIn the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[order theory|order]] and [[domain theory]], a '''Scott domain''' is an [[algebraic poset|algebraic]], [[bounded complete|bounded-complete]] [[complete partial order|cpo]]. It has been named in honour of [[Dana S. Scott]], who was the first to study these structures at the advent of domain theory. Scott domains are very closely related to [[algebraic lattice]]s, being different only in possibly lacking a [[greatest element]]. They are also closely related to [[Scott information system]]s, which constitute a \"syntactic\" representation of Scott domains.\n\nWhile the term \"Scott domain\" is widely used with the above definition, the term \"domain\" does not have such a generally accepted meaning and different authors will use different definitions; Scott himself used \"domain\" for the structures now called \"Scott domains\". Additionally, Scott domains appear with other names like \"algebraic semilattice\" in some publications.\n\nOriginally, [[Dana Scott]] demanded a [[complete lattice]], and the Russian mathematician [[Yury Yershov]] constructed the isomorphic structure of [[complete partial order|cpo]].  But this was not recognized until after scientific communications improved after the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]].  In honour of their work, a number of mathematical papers now dub this fundamental construction a \"Scott–Ershov\" domain.  \n\n==Definition==\nFormally, a non-empty [[partially ordered set]] (''D'', ≤) is called a ''Scott domain'' if the following hold:\n\n* ''D'' is [[complete partial order|directed complete]], i.e. all [[directed set|directed subsets]] of ''D'' have a [[supremum]].\n* ''D'' is [[bounded complete]], i.e. all subsets of ''D'' that have some [[upper bound]] have a supremum.\n* ''D'' is [[algebraic poset|algebraic]], i.e. every element of ''D'' can be obtained as the supremum of a directed set of [[compact element]]s of ''D''.\n\n==Properties==\nSince the empty set certainly has some upper bound, we can conclude the existence of a [[least element]] <math>\\bot</math> (the supremum of the empty set) from bounded completeness.\n\nThe property of being bounded complete is equivalent to the existence of [[infimum|infima]] of all non-empty subsets of ''D''. It is well known that the existence of all infima implies the existence of all suprema and thus makes a partially ordered set into a [[complete lattice]]. Thus, when a top element (the infimum of the empty set) is adjoined to a Scott domain, one can conclude that:\n# the new top element is compact (since the order was directed complete before) and\n# the resulting poset will be an [[algebraic lattice]] (i.e. a complete lattice that is algebraic). \nConsequently, Scott domains are in a sense \"almost\" algebraic lattices.\n\nScott domains become [[topological space]]s by introducing the [[Scott continuity|Scott topology]].\n\n==Explanation==\nScott domains are intended to represent ''partial algebraic data'', ordered by information content. An element <math>x \\in D</math> is a piece of data that might not be fully defined. The statement <math>x \\sqsubseteq y</math> means \"<math>y</math> contains all the information that <math>x</math> does\".\n\nWith this interpretation we can see that the [[supremum]] <math>\\sqcup X</math> of a subset <math>X \\subseteq D</math> is the element that contains all the information that ''any'' element of <math>X</math> contains, but ''no more''. Obviously such a supremum only exists (i.e., makes sense) provided <math>X</math> does not contain inconsistent information; hence the domain is directed and bounded complete, but not ''all'' suprema necessarily exist. The algebraicity axiom essentially ensures that all elements get all their information from (non-strictly) lower down in the ordering; in particular, the jump from compact or \"finite\" to non-compact or \"infinite\" elements does not covertly introduce any extra information that cannot be reached at some finite stage. The bottom element is the supremum of the empty set, i.e. the element containing no information at all; its existence is implied by bounded completeness, since, vacuously, the empty set has an upper bound in any non-empty poset.\n\nOn the other hand, the infimum <math>\\sqcap X</math> is the element that contains all the information that is shared by ''all'' elements of <math>X</math>, and ''no less''. If <math>X</math> contains no consistent information, then its elements have no information in common and so its infimum is <math>\\bot</math>. In this way all non-empty infima exist, but not all infima are necessarily interesting.\n\nThis definition in terms of partial data allows an algebra to be defined as the limit of a sequence of increasingly more defined partial algebras—in other words a fixed point of an operator that adds progressively more information to the algebra. For more information, see [[Domain theory]].\n\n==Examples==\n* Every finite poset is directed complete and algebraic. Thus any bounded-complete finite poset trivially is a Scott domain.\n* The [[natural numbers]] with an additional top element ω constitute an algebraic lattice, hence a Scott domain. For more examples in this direction, see the article on [[algebraic lattice]]s.\n* Consider the set of all finite and infinite words over the alphabet {0,1}, ordered by the [[prefix order]] on words. Thus, a word ''w'' is smaller than some word ''v'' if ''w'' is a prefix of ''v'', i.e. if there is some (finite or infinite) word ''v' '' such that ''w'' ''v' '' = ''v''. For example, 101 ≤ 10110. The empty word is the bottom element of this ordering, and every directed set (which is always a [[total order|chain]]) is easily seen to have a supremum. Likewise, one immediately verifies bounded completeness. However, the resulting poset is certainly missing a top having many maximal elements instead (like 111... or 000...). It is also algebraic, since every finite word happens to be compact and we certainly can approximate infinite words by chains of finite ones. Thus this is a Scott domain which is not an algebraic lattice.\n* For a negative example, consider the [[real number]]s in the unit interval [0,1], ordered by their natural order. This bounded-complete cpo is not algebraic. In fact its only compact element is 0.\n\n==Literature==\n''See the literature given for [[domain theory]].''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scott Domain}}\n[[Category:Domain theory]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]"

We then see,\n\n:''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' is contained in all [[closed set]]s that contain ''y''.\n:''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''y'' is contained in all [[open set]]s that contain ''x''.\n\nThese restatements help to explain why one speaks of a \"specialization\": ''y'' is more general than ''x'', since it is contained in more open sets. This is particularly intuitive if one views closed sets as properties that a point ''x'' may or may not have. The more closed sets contain a point, the more properties the point has, and the more special it is. The usage is [[consistent]] with the classical logical notions of [[genus]] and [[species]]; and also with the traditional use of [[generic point]]s in [[algebraic geometry]], in which closed points are the most specific, while a generic point of a space is one contained in every nonempty open subset. Specialization as an idea is applied also in [[valuation theory]].\n\nThe intuition of upper elements being more specific is typically found in [[domain theory]], a branch of order theory that has ample applications in computer science.\n\n== Upper and lower sets ==\n\nLet ''X'' be a topological space and let ≤ be the specialization preorder on ''X''. Every [[open set]] is an [[upper set]] with respect to ≤ and every [[closed set]] is a [[lower set]]. The converses are not generally true. In fact, a topological space is an [[Alexandrov-discrete space]] if and only if every upper set is also open (or equivalently every lower set is also closed).\n\nLet ''A'' be a subset of ''X''. The smallest upper set containing ''A'' is denoted ↑''A''\nand the smallest lower set containing ''A'' is denoted ↓''A''. In case ''A'' = {''x''} is a singleton one uses the notation ↑''x'' and ↓''x''. For ''x'' ∈ ''X'' one has:\n\n*↑''x'' = {''y'' ∈ ''X'' : ''x'' ≤ ''y''} = ∩{open sets containing ''x''}.\n*↓''x'' = {''y'' ∈ ''X'' : ''y'' ≤ ''x''} = ∩{closed sets containing ''x''} = cl{''x''}.\n\nThe lower set ↓''x'' is always closed; however, the upper set ↑''x'' need not be open or closed. The closed points of a topological space ''X'' are precisely the [[minimal element]]s of ''X'' with respect to ≤.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* In the [[Sierpinski space]] {0,1} with open sets {∅, {1}, {0,1}} the specialization order is the natural one (0 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ 1, and 1 ≤ 1).\n* If ''p'', ''q'' are elements of Spec(''R'') (the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of a [[commutative ring]] ''R'') then ''p'' ≤ ''q'' if and only if ''q'' ⊆ ''p'' (as [[prime ideal]]s). Thus the closed points of Spec(''R'') are precisely the [[maximal ideal]]s.\n\n== Important properties ==\n\nAs suggested by the name, the specialization preorder is a preorder, i.e. it is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]].\n\nThe [[equivalence relation]] determined by the specialization preorder is just that of [[Topologically indistinguishable|topological indistinguishability]]. That is, ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically indistinguishable if and only if  ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and  ''y'' ≤ ''x''. Therefore, the [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] of ≤ is precisely the T<sub>0</sub> separation axiom: if ''x'' and ''y'' are indistinguishable then ''x'' = ''y''. In this case it is justified to speak of the '''specialization order'''.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[symmetric relation|symmetry]] of specialization preorder is equivalent to the [[R0 space|R<sub>0</sub>]] separation axiom: ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically indistinguishable. It follows that if the underlying topology is T<sub>1</sub>, then the specialization order is discrete, i.e. one has ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' = ''y''. Hence, the specialization order is of little interest for T<sub>1</sub> topologies, especially for all [[Hausdorff space]]s.\n\nAny [[continuity (topology)|continuous function]] between two topological spaces is [[monotonic function|monotone]] with respect to the specialization preorders of these spaces. The converse, however, is not true in general. In the language of [[category theory]], we then have a [[functor]] from the [[category of topological spaces]] to the [[category of preordered sets]] which assigns a topological space its specialization preorder. This functor has a [[left adjoint]] which places the [[Alexandrov topology]] on a preordered set.\n\nThere are spaces that are more specific than T<sub>0</sub> spaces for which this order is interesting: the [[sober space]]s. Their relationship to the specialization order is more subtle:\n\nFor any sober space ''X'' with specialization order ≤, we have\n* (''X'', ≤) is a [[directed complete partial order]], i.e. every [[directed set|directed subset]] ''S'' of (''X'', ≤) has a [[supremum]] sup ''S'',\n* for every directed subset ''S'' of (''X'', ≤) and every open set ''O'', if sup ''S'' is in ''O'', then ''S'' and ''O'' have [[non-empty]] [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]].\n\nOne may describe the second property by saying that open sets are ''inaccessible by directed suprema''. A topology is [[order consistent]] with respect to a certain order ≤ if it induces ≤ as its specialization order and it has the above property of inaccessibility with respect to (existing) suprema of directed sets in ≤.\n\n== Topologies on orders ==\n\nThe specialization order yields a tool to obtain a preorder from every topology. It is natural to ask for the converse too: Is every preorder obtained as a specialization preorder of some topology?\n\nIndeed, the answer to this question is positive and there are in general many topologies on a set ''X'' which induce a given order ≤ as their specialization order. The [[Alexandroff topology]] of the order ≤ plays a special role: it is the finest topology that induces ≤. The other extreme, the coarsest topology that induces ≤, is the [[upper topology]], the least topology within which all complements of sets {''y'' in ''X'' | ''y'' ≤ ''x''} (for some ''x'' in ''X'') are open.\n\nThere are also interesting topologies in between these two extremes. The finest sober topology that is order consistent in the above sense for a given order ≤ is the [[Scott topology]]. The upper topology however is still the coarsest sober order consistent topology. In fact, its open sets are even inaccessible by ''any'' suprema. Hence any [[sober space]] with specialization order ≤ is finer than the upper topology and coarser than the Scott topology. Yet, such a space may fail to exist, that is, there exist partial orders for which there is no sober order consistent topology.

      "text": "{{No footnotes|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], there is an ample supply of [[duality of categories|categorical dualities]] between certain [[category theory|categories]] of [[topological space]]s and categories of [[partially ordered set]]s. Today, these dualities are usually collected under the label '''Stone duality''', since they form a natural generalization of [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]. These concepts are named in honor of [[Marshall Stone]]. Stone-type dualities also provide the foundation for [[pointless topology]] and are exploited in [[theoretical computer science]] for the study of [[Semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]].\n\nThis article gives pointers to special cases of Stone duality and explains a very general instance thereof in detail.\n\n==Overview of Stone-type dualities==\nProbably the most general duality that is classically referred to as \"Stone duality\" is the duality between the category '''Sob''' of [[sober space]]s with [[continuous function]]s and the category '''SFrm''' of spatial [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] with appropriate frame homomorphisms. The [[dual (category theory)|dual category]] of '''SFrm''' is the category of [[complete Heyting algebra|locales]] denoted by '''SLoc'''. The [[equivalence of categories|categorical equivalence]] of '''Sob''' and '''SLoc''' is the basis for the mathematical area of [[pointless topology]], that is devoted to the study of '''Loc''' – the category of all locales of which '''SLoc''' is a full subcategory. The involved constructions are characteristic for this kind of duality, and are detailed below.\n\nNow one can easily obtain a number of other dualities by restricting to certain special classes of sober spaces:\n\n* The category '''CohSp''' of [[Spectral space|coherent]] sober spaces (and coherent maps) is equivalent to the category '''CohLoc''' of [[coherent locale|coherent (or spectral) locales]] (and coherent maps), on the assumption of the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (in fact, this statement is equivalent to that assumption). The significance of this result stems from the fact that '''CohLoc''' in turn is dual to the category '''DLat''' of [[distributivity (order theory)|distributive]] [[lattice (order)|lattices]]. Hence, '''DLat''' is dual to '''CohSp''' – one obtains [[Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices]].\n* When restricting further to coherent sober spaces that are [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], one obtains the category '''Stone''' of so-called [[Stone space]]s. On the side of '''DLat''', the restriction yields the subcategory '''Bool''' of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]]. Thus one obtains [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]].\n* Stone's representation for distributive lattices can be extended via an equivalence of coherent spaces and [[Priestley space]]s (ordered topological spaces, that are [[compact space|compact]] and totally order-disconnected). One obtains a representation of distributive lattices via ordered topologies: [[Priestley's representation theorem for distributive lattice]]s.\n\nMany other Stone-type dualities could be added to these basic dualities.\n\n== Duality of sober spaces and spatial locales ==\n\n=== The lattice of open sets ===\nThe starting point for the theory is the fact that every topological space is characterized by a set of points ''X'' and a system Ω(''X'') of [[open set]]s of elements from ''X'', i.e. a subset of the [[powerset]] of ''X''. It is known that Ω(''X'') has certain special properties: it is a [[complete lattice]] within which [[supremum|suprema]] and finite [[infimum|infima]] are given by set unions and finite set intersections, respectively. Furthermore, it contains both ''X'' and the [[empty set]]. Since the [[order embedding|embedding]] of Ω(''X'') into the powerset lattice of ''X'' [[limit preserving (order theory)|preserves]] finite infima and arbitrary suprema, Ω(''X'') inherits the following distributivity law:\n\n:<math>x \\wedge \\bigvee S = \\bigvee \\{\\, x \\wedge s : s \\in S \\,\\}, </math>\n\nfor every element (open set) ''x'' and every subset ''S'' of Ω(''X''). Hence Ω(''X'') is not an arbitrary complete lattice but a ''complete Heyting algebra'' (also called ''frame'' or ''locale'' – the various names are primarily used to distinguish several categories that have the same class of objects but different morphisms: frame morphisms, locale morphisms and homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras). Now an obvious question is: To what extent is a topological space characterized by its locale of open sets?\n\nAs already hinted at above, one can go even further. The category '''Top''' of topological spaces has as morphisms the continuous functions, where a function ''f'' is continuous if the [[inverse image]] ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(''O'') of any open set in the [[codomain]] of ''f'' is open in the [[domain of a function|domain]] of ''f''. Thus any continuous function ''f'' from a space ''X'' to a space ''Y'' defines an inverse mapping ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup> from Ω(''Y'') to Ω(''X''). Furthermore, it is easy to check that ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup> (like any inverse image map) preserves finite intersections and arbitrary unions and therefore is a ''morphism of frames''. If we define Ω(''f'') = ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup> then Ω becomes a [[contravariant functor]] from the category '''Top''' to the category '''Frm''' of frames and frame morphisms. Using the tools of category theory, the task of finding a characterization of topological spaces in terms of their open set lattices is equivalent to finding a functor from '''Frm''' to '''Top''' which is [[adjoint functors|adjoint]] to Ω.\n\n=== Points of a locale ===\nThe goal of this section is to define a functor pt from '''Frm''' to '''Top''' that in a certain sense \"inverts\" the operation of Ω by assigning to each locale ''L'' a set of points pt(''L'') (hence the notation pt) with a suitable topology. But how can we recover the set of points just from the locale, though it is not given as a lattice of sets? It is certain that one cannot expect in general that pt can reproduce all of the original elements of a topological space just from its lattice of open sets – for example all sets with the [[indiscrete topology]] yield (up to isomorphism) the same locale, such that the information on the specific set is no longer present. However, there is still a reasonable technique for obtaining \"points\" from a locale, which indeed gives an example of a central construction for Stone-type duality theorems.\n\nLet us first look at the points of a topological space ''X''. One is usually tempted to consider a point of ''X'' as an element ''x'' of the set ''X'', but there is in fact a more useful description for our current investigation. Any point ''x'' gives rise to a continuous function ''p''<sub>''x''</sub> from the one element topological space 1 (all subsets of which are open) to the space ''X'' by defining ''p''<sub>''x''</sub>(1) = ''x''. Conversely, any function from 1 to ''X'' clearly determines one point: the element that it \"points\" to. Therefore, the set of points of a topological space is equivalently characterized as the set of functions from 1 to ''X''.\n\nWhen using the functor Ω to pass from '''Top''' to '''Frm''', all set-theoretic elements of a space are lost, but – using a fundamental idea of category theory – one can as well work on the [[function space]]s. Indeed, any \"point\" ''p''<sub>''x''</sub>: 1 → ''X'' in '''Top''' is mapped to a morphism Ω(''p''<sub>''x''</sub>): Ω(''X'') → Ω(1). The open set lattice of the one-element topological space Ω(1) is just (isomorphic to) the two-element locale 2 = { 0, 1 } with 0 < 1. After these observations it appears reasonable to define the set of points of a locale ''L'' to be the set of frame morphisms from ''L'' to 2. Yet, there is no guarantee that every point of the locale Ω(''X'') is in one-to-one correspondence to a point of the topological space ''X'' (consider again the indiscrete topology, for which the open set lattice has only one \"point\").\n\nBefore defining the required topology on pt(''X''), it is worthwhile to clarify the concept of a point of a locale further. The perspective motivated above suggests to consider a point of a locale ''L'' as a frame morphism ''p'' from ''L'' to 2. But these morphisms are characterized equivalently by the inverse images of the two elements of 2. From the properties of frame morphisms, one can derive that ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) is a lower set (since ''p'' is [[Monotonic function|monotone]]), which contains a greatest element ''a''<sub>''p''</sub> = V ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) (since ''p'' preserves arbitrary suprema). In addition, the [[ideal (order theory)|principal ideal]] ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) is a [[ideal (order theory)|prime ideal]] since ''p'' preserves finite infima and thus the principal ''a''<sub>''p''</sub> is a [[prime (order theroy)|meet-prime element]]. Now the set-inverse of ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) given by ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(1) is a [[filter (mathematics)|completely prime filter]] because ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) is a principal prime ideal. It turns out that all of these descriptions uniquely determine the initial frame morphism. We sum up:\n\nA point of a locale ''L'' is equivalently described as:\n* a frame morphism from ''L'' to 2\n* a principal prime ideal of ''L''\n* a meet-prime element of ''L''\n* a completely prime filter of ''L''.\n\nAll of these descriptions have their place within the theory and it is convenient to switch between them as needed.\n\n=== The functor pt ===\nNow that a set of points is available for any locale, it remains to equip this set with an appropriate topology in order to define the object part of the functor pt. This is done by defining the open sets of pt(''L'') as\n\n:φ(''a'') = { ''p'' ∈ pt(''L'') | ''p''(''a'') = 1 },\n\nfor every element ''a'' of ''L''. Here we viewed the points of ''L'' as morphisms, but one can of course state a similar definition for all of the other equivalent characterizations. It can be shown that setting Ω(pt(''L'')) = {φ(''a'') | ''a'' ∈ ''L''} does really yield a topological space (pt(''L''), Ω(pt(''L''))). It is common to abbreviate this space as pt(''L'').\n\nFinally pt can be defined on morphisms of '''Frm''' rather canonically by defining, for a frame morphism ''g'' from ''L'' to ''M'', pt(''g''): pt(''M'') → pt(''L'') as pt(''g'')(''p'') = ''p'' o ''g''. In words, we obtain a morphism from ''L'' to 2 (a point of ''L'') by applying the morphism ''g'' to get from ''L'' to ''M'' before applying the morphism ''p'' that maps from ''M'' to 2. Again, this can be formalized using the other descriptions of points of a locale as well – for example just calculate (''p'' o ''g'')<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0).\n\n=== The adjunction of Top and Loc===\nAs noted several times before, pt and Ω usually are not inverses. In general neither is ''X'' [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to pt(Ω(''X'')) nor is ''L'' [[order isomorphism|order-isomorphic]] to Ω(pt(''L'')). However, when introducing the topology of pt(''L'') above, a mapping φ from ''L'' to Ω(pt(''L'')) was applied. This mapping is indeed a frame morphism. Conversely, we can define a continuous function ψ from ''X'' to pt(Ω(''X'')) by setting ψ(''x'') = Ω(''p''<sub>''x''</sub>), where ''p''<sub>''x''</sub> is just the characteristic function for the point ''x'' from 1 to ''X'' as described above. Another convenient description is given by viewing points of a locale as meet-prime elements. In this case we have ψ(''x'') = ''X'' \\ Cl{''x''}, where Cl{''x''} denotes the topological closure of the set {''x''} and \\ is just set-difference.\n\nAt this point we already have more than enough data to obtain the desired result: the functors Ω and pt define an adjunction between the categories '''Top''' and '''Loc''' = '''Frm'''<sup>op</sup>, where pt is right adjoint to Ω and the [[natural transformation]]s ψ and φ<sup>op</sup> provide the required unit and counit, respectively.\n\n=== The duality theorem ===\nThe above adjunction is not an equivalence of the categories '''Top''' and '''Loc''' (or, equivalently, a duality of '''Top''' and '''Frm'''). For this it is necessary that both ψ and φ are isomorphisms in their respective categories.\n\nFor a space ''X'', ψ: ''X'' → pt(Ω(''X'')) is a homeomorphism [[if and only if]] it is [[bijective]]. Using the characterization via meet-prime elements of the open set lattice, one sees that this is the case if and only if every meet-prime open set is of the form ''X'' \\ Cl{''x''} for a unique ''x''. Alternatively, every join-prime closed set is the closure of a unique point, where \"join-prime\" can be replaced by [[irreducible (order theory)|(join-) irreducible]] since we are in a distributive lattice. Spaces with this property are called '''sober'''.\n\nConversely, for a locale ''L'', φ: ''L'' → Ω(pt(''L'')) is always surjective. It is additionally injective if and only if any two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''L'' for which ''a'' is not less-or-equal to ''b'' can be separated by points of the locale, formally:\n\n: if not ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then there is a point ''p'' in pt(''L'') such that p(''a'') = 1 and p(''b'') = 0.\n\nIf this condition is satisfied for all elements of the locale, then the locale is '''spatial''', or said to have enough points. (See also [[well-pointed category]] for a similar condition in more general categories.)\n\nFinally, one can verify that for every space ''X'', Ω(''X'') is spatial and for every locale ''L'', pt(''L'') is sober. Hence, it follows that the above adjunction of '''Top''' and '''Loc''' restricts to an equivalence of the full subcategories '''Sob''' of sober spaces and '''SLoc''' of spatial locales. This main result is completed by the observation that for the functor pt o Ω, sending each space to the points of its open set lattice is left adjoint to the [[inclusion functor]] from '''Sob''' to '''Top'''. For a space ''X'', pt(Ω(''X'')) is called its '''soberification'''. The case of the functor Ω o pt is symmetric but a special name for this operation is not commonly used.\n\n==References==\n* Burris, Stanley N., and H.P. Sankappanavar, H. P., 1981.

The '''Suslin hypothesis''' says that there are no Suslin lines: that every countable-chain-condition dense complete linear order without endpoints is isomorphic to the real line. An equivalent statement is that every [[tree (set theory)|tree]] of height ω<sub>1</sub> either has a branch of length ω<sub>1</sub> or an [[antichain]] of cardinality <math>\\aleph_1</math>.\n\nThe '''generalized Suslin hypothesis''' says that for every infinite [[regular cardinal]] κ every tree of height κ either has a branch of length κ or an antichain of cardinality κ. The existence of Suslin lines is equivalent to the existence of [[Suslin tree]]s and to [[Suslin algebra]]s.\n\nThe Suslin hypothesis is independent of ZFC.\n{{harvtxt|Jech|1967}} and {{harvtxt|Tennenbaum|1968}} independently used [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing methods]] to construct models of ZFC in which Suslin lines exist. [[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]] later proved that Suslin lines exist if the [[diamond principle]], a consequence of the [[axiom of constructibility]] V&nbsp;=&nbsp;L, is assumed. (Jensen's result was a surprise, as it had previously been conjectured that V&nbsp;=&nbsp;L implies that no Suslin lines exist, on the grounds that V&nbsp;=&nbsp;L implies that there are \"few\" sets.) On the other hand, {{harvtxt|Solovay|Tennenbaum|1971}} used forcing to construct a model of ZFC without Suslin lines; more precisely, they showed that [[Martin's axiom]] plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis implies the Suslin Hypothesis.\n\nThe Suslin hypothesis is also independent of both the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (proved by [[Ronald Jensen]]) and of the negation of the [[continuum hypothesis]]. It is not known whether the generalized Suslin hypothesis is consistent with the generalized continuum hypothesis; however, since the combination implies the negation of the [[square principle]] at a singular strong [[limit cardinal]]—in fact, at all [[singular cardinal]]s and all regular [[successor cardinal]]s—it implies that the [[axiom of determinacy]] holds in L(R) and is believed to imply the existence of an [[inner model]] with a [[superstrong cardinal]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of statements independent of ZFC]]\n* [[AD+]]\n\n==References==\n* K.

Such a function is called a [[2-valued morphism]]. Then ''m'' is [[finitely additive]], and hence a ''[[Content (measure theory)|content]]'' on ℘(''X''), and every property of elements of ''X'' is either true [[almost everywhere]] or false almost everywhere. However, ''m'' is usually not ''countably additive'', and hence does not define a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] in the usual sense.\n\nFor a filter ''F'' that is not an ultrafilter, one would say ''m''(''A'') = 1 if ''A''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''F'' and ''m''(''A'') = 0 if ''X'' \\ ''A''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''F'', leaving ''m'' undefined elsewhere.{{cn|date=July 2016}}{{clarify|reason=A function m can certainly be defined in that way.

The definition implies that the completeness of any powerset ultrafilter is at least [[Aleph-naught|<math>\\aleph_0</math>]]. An ultrafilter whose completeness is ''greater'' than <math>\\aleph_0</math>—that is, the intersection of any countable collection of elements of ''U'' is still in ''U''—is called '''countably complete''' or '''σ-complete'''.\n\nThe completeness of a countably complete [[#Types and existence of ultrafilters|nonprincipal]] ultrafilter on a powerset is always a [[measurable cardinal]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}\n\n== {{vanchor|Types and existence of ultrafilters|Types}} ==\nThere are two very different types of ultrafilter: principal and free. A '''principal''' (or '''fixed''', or '''trivial''') ultrafilter is a filter containing a [[least element]]. Consequently, principal ultrafilters are of the form ''F''<sub>''a''</sub> = {''x'' | ''a'' ≤ ''x''} for some (but not all) elements ''a'' of the given poset. In this case ''a'' is called the ''principal element'' of the ultrafilter. In the above picture, ''F''<sub>{1}</sub> is a principal ultrafilter, while ''F''<sub>{1,4}</sub> is not. Any ultrafilter that is not principal is called a '''free''' (or '''non-principal''') ultrafilter. \n\nFor ultrafilters on a powerset ℘(''S''), a principal ultrafilter consists of all subsets of ''S'' that contain a given element ''s'' of ''S''. Each ultrafilter on ℘(''S'') that is also a [[principal filter]] is of this form.<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.1990\"/>{{rp|187}} Therefore, an ultrafilter ''U'' on ℘(''S'') is principal if and only if it contains a finite set.<ref group=note>To see the \"if\" direction: If {''s''<sub>1</sub>,...,''s''<sub>''n''</sub>} ∈ ''U'', then {''s''<sub>1</sub>} ∈ ''U'', or ..., or {''s''<sub>''n''</sub>} ∈ ''U'' by induction on ''n'', using Nr.2 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem. That is, some {''s''<sub>''i''</sub>} is the principal element of ''U''.</ref> If ''S'' is infinite, an ultrafilter ''U'' on ℘(''S'') is hence non-principal if and only if it contains the [[Fréchet filter]] of [[cofinite subset]]s of ''S''.<ref group=note>''U'' is non-principal iff it contains no finite set, i.e. (by Nr.3 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem) iff it contains every cofinite set, i.e. every member of the Fréchet filter.</ref>{{cn|date=July 2016}} If ''S'' is finite, each ultrafilter is principal.<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.1990\"/>{{rp|187}}\n\nOne can show that every filter of a Boolean algebra (or more generally, any subset with the [[finite intersection property]]) is contained in an ultrafilter (see [[Ultrafilter lemma]]) and that free ultrafilters therefore exist, but the proofs involve the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) in the form of [[Zorn's Lemma]]. On the other hand, the statement that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter does not imply AC. Indeed, it is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (BPIT), a well-known intermediate point between the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and the ZF theory augmented by the axiom of choice (ZFC). In general proofs involving the axiom of choice do not produce explicit examples of free ultrafilters, though it is possible to find explicit examples in some  models of ZFC;  for example, Godel showed that this can be done in the constructible universe where one can write down an explicit global choice function.  <!---commented out: \"almost all\" is vague in absence of a measure, \"all UFs principal on finite sets\" has been said above---Nonetheless, almost all ultrafilters on the powerset of an infinite set are free. By contrast, every ultrafilter of a finite poset (or ''on'' a finite set) is principal, since any finite filter has a least element.---> In ZF without the axiom of choice, it is possible that every ultrafilter is principal.{see p.316, [Halbeisen, L.J.] \"Combinatorial Set Theory\", Springer 2012}\n\n==Applications==\nUltrafilters on powersets are useful in [[topology]], especially in relation to [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] spaces, and in [[model theory]] in the construction of [[ultraproduct|ultraproducts and ultrapowers]]. Every ultrafilter on a compact Hausdorff space converges to exactly one point. Likewise, ultrafilters on Boolean algebras play a central role in [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone's representation theorem]].\n\nThe set ''G'' of all ultrafilters of a poset ''P'' can be topologized in a natural way, that is in fact closely related to the above-mentioned representation theorem. For any element ''a'' of ''P'', let ''D''<sub>''a''</sub> = {''U'' ∈ ''G'' | ''a'' ∈ ''U''}. This is most useful when ''P'' is again a Boolean algebra, since in this situation the set of all ''D''<sub>''a''</sub> is a base for a compact Hausdorff topology on ''G''. Especially, when considering the ultrafilters on a powerset ℘(''S''), the resulting [[topological space]] is the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of a [[discrete space]] of cardinality |''S''|.\n\nThe [[ultraproduct]] construction in [[model theory]] uses ultrafilters to produce [[elementary extension]]s of structures. For example, in constructing [[hyperreal number]]s as an ultraproduct of the [[real numbers]], the [[domain of discourse]] is extended from real numbers to sequences of real numbers. This sequence space is regarded as a [[superset]] of the reals by identifying each real with the corresponding constant sequence. To extend the familiar functions and relations (e.g., + and <) from the reals to the hyperreals, the natural idea is to define them pointwise. But this would lose important logical properties of the reals; for example, pointwise < is not a total ordering. So instead the functions and relations are defined \"[[ultraproduct#Definition|pointwise modulo ''U'']]\", where ''U'' is an ultrafilter on the [[index set]] of the sequences; by [[Łoś' theorem]], this preserves all properties of the reals that can be stated in [[first-order logic]]. If ''U'' is nonprincipal, then the extension thereby obtained is nontrivial.\n\nIn [[geometric group theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define the [[ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of a group. This construction yields a rigorous way to consider ''looking at the group from infinity'', that is the large scale geometry of the group. Asymptotic cones are particular examples of [[ultralimit]]s of [[metric space]]s.\n\n[[Gödel's ontological proof]] of God's existence uses as an axiom that the set of all \"positive properties\" is an ultrafilter.\n\nIn [[social choice theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define a rule (called a ''social welfare function'') for aggregating the preferences of ''infinitely'' many individuals. Contrary to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] for ''finitely'' many individuals, such a rule satisfies the conditions (properties) that Arrow proposes\n(e.g., Kirman and Sondermann, 1972<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Kirman | first1 = A.| last2 = Sondermann | first2 = D.| title = Arrow's theorem, many agents, and invisible dictators| journal = Journal of Economic Theory| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 267–277| year = 1972| doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90106-8}}</ref>).\nMihara (1997,<ref name=mihara97>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mihara | first1 = H.

For partial orders satisfying the [[descending chain condition]] this correspondence between antichains and upper sets is 1-1, but for more general partial orders this is not true.\n\n==Upper closure and lower closure==\nGiven an element ''x'' of a partially ordered set (''X'', ≤), we define the '''upper closure''' of ''x'', denoted by ↑''x'', as ↑''x'' = {''y''∈''X'' : ''x''≤''y''}, and the '''lower closure''' of ''x'', denoted by ↓''x'', as ↓''x'' = {''y''∈''X'' : ''y''≤''x''}. One can show that ↑''x'' and ↓''x'' are the smallest upper and lower sets containing ''x'', respectively. More generally, given a subset ''A'' of ''X'' we define the upper and lower closures of ''A'', denoted by ↑''A'' and ↓''A'' respectively, as <math>\\uparrow\\!A = \\cup_{a \\in A} \\uparrow\\!a</math> and <math>\\downarrow\\!A = \\cup_{a \\in A} \\downarrow\\!a</math>. In this way we have ↑''x'' = ↑{''x''} and ↓''x'' = ↓{''x''}, and upper sets and lower sets of this form are called '''principal'''. Similarly, one can show that the upper and lower closures of a set are the smallest upper and lower sets containing it.\n\nThe upper and lower closures, when viewed as function from the power set of ''X'' to itself, are examples of [[Kuratowski closure axioms#Definition|closure operators]] since they satisfy all of the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]. As a result, the upper closure of a set is equal to the intersection of all upper sets containing it, and similarly for lower sets. Indeed, this is a general phenomenon of closure operators. For example, the [[topological closure]] of a set is the intersection of all [[closed sets]] containing it; the [[Linear span|span]] of a set of vectors is the intersection of all [[Linear subspace|subspaces]] containing it; the [[Generating set of a group|subgroup generated by a subset]] of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] is the intersection of all subgroups containing it; the [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by a subset of a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is the intersection of all ideals containing it; and so on.\n\nOne can also speak of the '''strict upper closure''' of an element ''x'' in ''X'' defined as {''y''∈''X'' : ''x''<''y''}, and more generally, the strict upper closure of a subset ''A'' of ''X'' which is defined as the union of the strict upper closures of its elements, and we can make analogous definitions for strict lower closures. However note that these 'closures' are not actually closure operators, since for example the strict upper closure of a singleton set {''x''} does not contain {''x''}.\n\n==Ordinal numbers==\nAn [[ordinal number]] is usually identified with the set of all smaller ordinal numbers.

Then the set ''P'' contains at least one [[maximal element]].\n|name=Lemma}}\n\nVariants of this formulation are sometimes used, such as requiring that the set ''P''  and the chains be non-empty. See the discussion [[#Alternative formulation|below]].\n\n==Example application==\nZorn's lemma can be used to show that every nontrivial ring ''R'' with [[Unital ring|unity]] contains a [[maximal ideal]]. In the terminology above, the set ''P'' consists of all (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in ''R'' except ''R'' itself.  Since ''R'' is non-trivial, the set ''P'' contains the trivial ideal {0}, and therefore ''P'' is non-empty. This set ''P'' is partially ordered by [[subset|set inclusion]]. Finding a maximal ideal is the same as finding a maximal element in ''P''. The ideal ''R'' was excluded because maximal ideals by definition are not equal to ''R''.\n\nTo apply Zorn's lemma, take a chain ''T'' in ''P'' (that is, ''T'' is a subset of ''P'' that is totally ordered). If ''T'' is the empty set, then the trivial ideal {0} is an upper bound for ''T'' in ''P''. Assume then that ''T'' is non-empty. It is necessary to show that ''T'' has an upper bound, that is, there exists an ideal ''I'' ⊆ ''R'' which is bigger than all members of ''T'' but still smaller than ''R'' (otherwise it would not be in ''P''). Take ''I'' to be the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all the ideals in ''T''. We wish to show that ''I'' is an upper bound for ''T'' in ''P''. We will first show that ''I'' is an ideal of ''R'', and then that it is a proper ideal of ''R'' and so is an element of ''P''. Since every element of ''T'' is contained in ''I'', this will show that ''I'' is an upper bound for ''T'' in ''P'', as required.\n\nBecause ''T'' contains at least one element, and that element contains at least 0, the union ''I'' contains at least 0 and is not empty. To prove that ''I'' is an ideal, note that if ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''I'', then there exist two ideals ''J'', ''K'' ∈ ''T'' such that ''a'' is an element of ''J'' and ''b'' is an element of ''K''. Since ''T'' is totally ordered, we know that ''J'' ⊆ ''K'' or ''K'' ⊆ ''J''. In the first case, both ''a'' and ''b'' are members of the ideal ''K'', therefore their sum ''a'' + ''b'' is a member of ''K'', which shows that ''a'' + ''b'' is a member of ''I''. In the second case, both ''a'' and ''b'' are members of the ideal ''J'', and thus ''a'' + ''b'' ∈ ''I''. Furthermore, if ''r'' ∈ ''R'', then ''ar'' and ''ra'' are elements of ''J'' and hence elements of ''I''. Thus, ''I'' is an ideal in ''R''.\n\nNow, an ideal is equal to ''R'' [[if and only if]] it contains 1. (It is clear that if it is equal to ''R'', then it must contain 1; on the other hand, if it contains 1 and ''r'' is an arbitrary element of ''R'', then ''r1'' = ''r'' is an element of the ideal, and so the ideal is equal to ''R''.) So, if ''I'' were equal to ''R'', then it would contain 1, and that means one of the members of ''T'' would contain 1 and would thus be equal to ''R'' – but ''R'' is explicitly excluded from ''P''.\n\nThe hypothesis of Zorn's lemma has been checked, and thus there is a maximal element in ''P'', in other words a maximal ideal in ''R''.\n\nNote that the proof depends on the fact that our ring ''R'' has a multiplicative unit 1. Without this, the proof wouldn't work and indeed the statement would be false. For example, the ring with <math>\\Q</math> as additive group and trivial multiplication (i.e. <math>a b=0</math> for all <math>a,b</math>) has no maximal ideal (and of course no 1): Its ideals are precisely the additive subgroups. The [[factor group]] <math>\\Q/A</math> by a proper subgroup <math>A</math> is a [[divisible group]], hence certainly not [[finitely generated abelian group|finitely generated]], hence has a proper non-trivial subgroup, which gives rise to a subgroup and ideal containing <math>A</math>.\n\n==Proof sketch==\nA sketch of the proof of Zorn's lemma follows, assuming the [[axiom of choice]]. Suppose the lemma is false. Then there exists a partially ordered set, or poset, ''P'' such that every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, and that for every element in ''P'' there is another element bigger than it. For every totally ordered subset ''T'' we may then define a bigger element ''b''(''T''), because ''T'' has an upper bound, and that upper bound has a bigger element. To actually define the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''b'', we need to employ the axiom of choice.\n\nUsing the function ''b'', we are going to define elements ''a''<sub>0</sub> < ''a''<sub>1</sub> < ''a''<sub>2</sub> < ''a''<sub>3</sub> < ... in ''P''. This sequence is '''really long''': the indices are not just the [[natural number]]s, but all [[ordinal number|ordinals]]. In fact, the sequence is too long for the set ''P''; there are too many ordinals (a [[proper class]]), more than there are elements in any set, and the set ''P'' will be exhausted before long and then we will run into the desired contradiction.\n\nThe ''a<sub>i</sub>'' are defined by [[transfinite recursion]]: we pick ''a''<sub>0</sub> in ''P'' arbitrary (this is possible, since ''P'' contains an upper bound for the empty set and is thus not empty) and for any other ordinal ''w'' we set ''a''<sub>''w''</sub> = ''b''({''a''<sub>''v''</sub> : ''v'' < ''w''}). Because the ''a''<sub>''v''</sub> are totally ordered, this is a well-founded definition.\n\nThis proof shows that actually a slightly stronger version of Zorn's lemma is true:\n{{Quote|If ''P'' is a [[poset]] in which every [[well-order]]ed subset has an upper bound, and if ''x'' is any element of ''P'', then ''P'' has a maximal element greater than or equal to ''x''. That is, there is a maximal element which is comparable to ''x''.}}\n\n==Alternative formulation==\nZorn's lemma is sometimes<ref>For example, {{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Serge|author-link1=Serge Lang|title=Algebra|edition=Revised 3rd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=211|date=2002|isbn=978-0-387-95385-4|page=880}}, {{cite book|last1=Dummit|first1=David S.|last2=Foote|first2=Richard M.|title=Abstract Algebra|edition=2nd|publisher=Prentice Hall|date=1998|isbn=978-0-13-569302-5|page=875}}, and {{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=George M|author-link1=George Bergman|title=An Invitation to General Algebra and Universal Constructions|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=Universitext|date=2015|isbn=978-3-319-11477-4|page=162|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/245/}}.</ref> stated as follows:\n<blockquote>\nSuppose a non-empty partially ordered set ''P'' has the property that every non-empty chain has an upper bound in ''P''. Then the set ''P'' contains at least one maximal element.\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough this formulation appears to be formally weaker (since it places on ''P'' the additional condition of being non-empty, but obtains the same conclusion about ''P''), in fact the two formulations are equivalent. To verify this, suppose first that ''P'' satisfies the condition that every chain in ''P'' has an upper bound in ''P''. Then the empty subset of ''P'' is a chain, as it satisfies the definition [[vacuous truth|vacuously]]; so the hypothesis implies that this subset must have an upper bound in ''P'', and this upper bound shows that ''P'' is in fact non-empty.  Conversely, if ''P'' is assumed to be non-empty and satisfies the hypothesis that every non-empty chain has an upper bound in ''P'', then ''P'' also satisfies the condition that ''every'' chain has an upper bound, as an arbitrary element of ''P'' serves as an upper bound for the empty chain (that is, the empty subset viewed as a chain).\n\nThe difference may seem subtle, but in many proofs that invoke Zorn's lemma one takes unions of some sort to produce an upper bound, and so the case of the empty chain may be overlooked; that is, the verification that all chains have upper bounds may have to deal with empty and non-empty chains separately. So many authors prefer to verify the non-emptiness of the set ''P'' rather than deal with the empty chain in the general argument.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=George M|author-link1=George Bergman|title=An Invitation to General Algebra and Universal Constructions|edition=Second|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=Universitext|date=2015|isbn=978-3-319-11477-4|page=164|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/245/}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Hausdorff maximal principle]] is an early statement similar to Zorn's lemma.\n\n[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] proved in 1922<ref>{{cite journal |first=Casimir |last=Kuratowski |title=Une méthode d'élimination des nombres transfinis des raisonnements mathématiques |trans-title=A method of disposing of transfinite numbers of mathematical reasoning |journal=[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]] |volume=3 |issue= |year=1922 |pages=76–108 |url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm3/fm3114.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-04-24 |language=French}}</ref> a version of the lemma close to its modern formulation (it applies to sets ordered by inclusion and closed under unions of well-ordered chains).

      "text": "In [[topology]], '''approach spaces''' are a generalization of [[metric space]]s, based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point distances. They were introduced by Robert Lowen in 1989.\n\n==Definition==\n\nGiven a metric space (''X'',''d''), or more generally, an [[Metric (mathematics)#Extending_the_range|extended]] [[Pseudometric_space|pseudo]][[quasimetric]] (which will be abbreviated ''∞pq-metric'' here), one can define an induced map '''d''':''X''&times;P(''X'')→[0,∞] by '''d'''(x,''A'') = inf { ''d''(''x'',''a'' ) : ''a'' ∈ ''A'' }.  With this example in mind, a '''distance''' on ''X'' is defined to be a map ''X''&times;P(''X'')→[0,∞] satisfying for all ''x'' in ''X'' and ''A'', ''B'' ⊆ ''X'',\n#'''d'''(''x'',{''x''}) = 0 ;\n#'''d'''(''x'',Ø) = ∞ ;\n#'''d'''(''x'',''A''∪''B'') = min '''d'''(''x'',''A''),'''d'''(''x'',''B'') ;\n#For all ε, 0≤ε≤∞, '''d'''(''x'',''A'') ≤ '''d'''(''x'',''A''<sup>(ε)</sup>) + ε ;\nwhere ''A''<sup>(ε)</sup> = { ''x'' : '''d'''(''x'',''A'') ≤ ε } by definition.\n\n(The \"empty infimum is positive infinity\" convention is like the [[Empty product#Nullary intersection|nullary intersection is everything]] convention.)\n\nAn approach space is defined to be a pair (''X'','''d''') where '''d''' is a distance function on ''X''. Every approach space has a topology, given by treating ''A''&nbsp;→&nbsp; ''A''<sup>(0)</sup> as a [[Kuratowski closure axioms|Kuratowski closure operator]].\n\nThe appropriate maps between approach spaces are the ''contractions''. A map ''f'':(''X'','''d''')→(''Y'','''e''') is a contraction if '''e'''(''f''(''x''),''f''[''A'']) ≤ '''d'''(''x'',''A'') for all ''x'' ∈ ''X'', ''A'' ⊆ ''X''.\n\n==Examples==\n\nEvery ∞pq-metric space (''X'',''d'') can be ''distancized'' to (''X'','''d'''), as described at the beginning of the definition.\n\nGiven a set ''X'', the ''discrete'' distance is given by '''d'''(''x'',''A'') = 0 if ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and = ∞ if ''x'' ∉ ''A''. The induced topology is the discrete topology.\n\nGiven a set ''X'', the ''indiscrete'' distance is given by '''d'''(''x'',''A'') = 0 if ''A'' is non-empty, and = ∞ if ''A'' is empty. The induced topology is the indiscrete topology.\n\nGiven a topological space ''X'', a ''topological'' distance is given by '''d'''(''x'',''A'') = 0 if ''x'' ∈ <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''A''</span>, and = ∞ if not. The induced topology is the original topology. In fact, the only two-valued distances are the topological distances.\n\nLet '''P'''=[0,∞], the extended positive reals. Let '''d'''<sup>+</sup>(''x'',''A'') = max (''x''&minus;sup ''A'',0) for ''x''∈'''P''' and ''A''⊆'''P'''. Given any approach space (''X'','''d'''), the maps (for each ''A''⊆''X'') '''d'''(.,''A'')&nbsp;:&nbsp;(''X'','''d''')&nbsp;→&nbsp;('''P''','''d'''<sup>+</sup>) are contractions.\n\nOn '''P''', let '''e'''(''x'',''A'') = inf { |''x''&minus;''a''| : ''a''∈''A'' } for ''x''<∞, let '''e'''(∞,''A'') = 0 if ''A'' is unbounded, and let '''e'''(∞,''A'') = ∞ if ''A'' is bounded. Then ('''P''','''e''') is an approach space. Topologically, '''P''' is the one-point compactification of <nowiki>[0,∞)</nowiki>.  Note that '''e''' extends the ordinary Euclidean distance. This cannot be done with the ordinary Euclidean metric.\n\nLet β'''N''' be the Stone–Čech compactification of the integers. A point ''U''∈β'''N''' is an ultrafilter on '''N'''. A subset ''A''⊆β'''N''' induces a filter ''F''(''A'')=∩{''U'':''U''∈''A''}. Let '''b'''(''U'',''A'') = sup { inf { |''n''-''j''| : ''n''∈''X'', ''j''∈''E'' } : ''X''∈''U'', ''E''∈''F''(''A'') }. Then (β'''N''','''b''') is an approach space that extends the ordinary Euclidean distance on '''N'''. In contrast, β'''N''' is not metrizable.\n\n==Equivalent definitions==\n\nLowen has offered at least seven equivalent formulations. Two of them are below.\n\nLet XPQ(''X'') denote the set of xpq-metrics on ''X''. A subfamily ''G'' of XPQ(''X'') is called a ''gauge'' if\n#0 ∈ ''G'', where 0 is the zero metric, that is, 0(''x'',''y'')=0, all ''x'',''y'' ;\n#''e'' ≤ ''d'' ∈ ''G'' implies ''e'' ∈ ''G'' ;\n#''d'', ''e'' ∈ ''G'' implies max ''d'',''e'' ∈ ''G'' (the \"max\" here is the pointwise maximum);\n#For all ''d'' ∈ XPQ(''X''), if for all ''x'' ∈ ''X'', ε>0, ''N''<∞ there is ''e'' ∈ ''G'' such that min(''d''(''x'',''y''),''N'') ≤ ''e''(''x'',''y'') + ε for all ''y'', then ''d'' ∈ ''G'' .\n\nIf ''G'' is a gauge on ''X'', then '''d'''(''x'',''A'') = sup { '''e'''(''x'',''a'') } : ''e'' ∈ ''G'' } is a distance function on ''X''. Conversely, given a distance function '''d''' on ''X'', the set of ''e'' ∈ XPQ(''X'') such that '''e''' ≤ '''d''' is a gauge on ''X''. The two operations are inverse to each other.\n\nA contraction ''f'':(''X'','''d''')→(''Y'','''e''') is, in terms of associated gauges ''G'' and ''H'' respectively, a map such that for all ''d''∈''H'', ''d''(''f''(.),''f''(.))∈''G''.\n\nA ''tower'' on ''X'' is a set of maps ''A''→''A''<sup>[ε]</sup> for ''A''⊆''X'', ε≥0, satisfying for all ''A'', ''B''⊆''X'', δ, ε ≥ 0\n#''A'' ⊆ ''A''<sup>[ε]</sup> ;\n#Ø<sup>[ε]</sup> = Ø ;\n#(''A''∪''B'')<sup>[ε]</sup> = ''A''<sup>[ε]</sup>∪''B''<sup>[ε]</sup> ;\n#''A''<sup>[ε][δ]</sup> ⊆ ''A''<sup>[ε+δ]</sup> ;\n#''A''<sup>[ε]</sup> = ∩<sub>δ>ε</sub>''A''<sup>[δ]</sup> .\n\nGiven a distance '''d''', the associated ''A''→''A''<sup>(ε)</sup> is a tower. Conversely, given a tower, the map '''d'''(''x'',''A'') = inf { ε : ''x'' ∈ ''A''<sup>[ε]</sup> } is a distance, and these two operations are inverses of each other.\n\nA contraction ''f'':(''X'','''d''')→(''Y'','''e''') is, in terms of associated towers, a map such that for all ε≥0, ''f''[''A''<sup>[ε]</sup>] ⊆ ''f''[''A'']<sup>[ε]</sup>.\n\n==Categorical properties==\n\nThe main interest in approach spaces and their contractions is that they form a category with good properties, while still being quantitative like metric spaces. One can take arbitrary [[Product (category theory)|products]], [[Coproduct|coproducts]], and quotients, and the results appropriately generalize the corresponding results for topologies. One can even \"distancize\" such badly non-metrizable spaces like β'''N''', the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of the integers.\n\nCertain hyperspaces, measure spaces, and probabilistic metric spaces turn out to be naturally endowed with a distance.

      "text": "{{Other uses|Closure (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''closure''' of a subset ''S'' of points in a [[topological space]] consists of all [[Topology glossary#P|point]]s in ''S'' together with all [[limit points]] of ''S''. The closure of ''S'' may equivalently be defined as the union of ''S'' and its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]], and also as the intersection of all closed sets containing ''S''. Intuitively, the closure can be thought of as all the points that are either in ''S'' or \"near\" ''S''. A point which is in the closure of ''S'' is a [[adherent point|point of closure]] of ''S''. The notion of closure is in many ways [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the notion of [[interior (topology)|interior]].\n\n==Definitions==\n\n=== Point of closure ===\n\nFor ''S'' a subset of a [[Euclidean space]], ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if every [[open ball]] centered at ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' (this point may be ''x'' itself).\n\nThis definition generalises to any subset ''S'' of a [[metric space]] ''X''. Fully expressed, for ''X'' a metric space with metric ''d'', ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if for every ''r'' > 0, there is a ''y'' in ''S'' such that the distance ''d''(''x'', ''y'') < ''r''. (Again, we may have ''x'' = ''y''.) Another way to express this is to say that ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if the distance ''d''(''x'', ''S'') := [[infimum|inf]]{''d''(''x'', ''s'') : ''s'' in ''S''} = 0.\n\nThis definition generalises to [[topological space]]s by replacing \"open ball\" or \"ball\" with \"[[Topology glossary#N|neighbourhood]]\". Let ''S'' be a subset of a topological space ''X''. Then ''x'' is a [[Adherent point|point of closure]] (or ''adherent point'') of ''S'' if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S''.<ref>{{harvnb|Schubert|loc=p. 20}}</ref> Note that this definition does not depend upon whether neighbourhoods are required to be open.\n\n===Limit point===\nThe definition of a point of closure is closely related to the definition of a [[limit point]]. The difference between the two definitions is subtle but important &mdash; namely, in the definition of limit point, every neighbourhood of the point ''x'' in question must contain a point of the set ''other than x itself''.\n\nThus, every limit point is a point of closure, but not every point of closure is a limit point. A point of closure which is not a limit point is an [[isolated point]]. In other words, a point ''x'' is an isolated point of ''S'' if it is an element of ''S'' and if there is a neighbourhood of ''x'' which contains no other points of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuratowski|loc=p. 75}}</ref>\n\nFor a given set ''S'' and point ''x'', ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if and only if ''x'' is an element of ''S'' or ''x'' is a limit point of ''S'' (or both).\n\n===Closure of a set===\n{{See also|Closure (mathematics)}}\n\nThe '''closure''' of a set ''S'' is the set of all points of closure of ''S'', that is, the set ''S'' together with all of its limit points.<ref>{{harvnb|Hocking|Young|loc=p. 4}}</ref> The closure of ''S'' is denoted cl(''S''), Cl(''S''), <math>\\scriptstyle \\bar{S}</math> or <math>\\scriptstyle S^-</math>. The closure of a set has the following properties.<ref>{{harvnb|Croom|loc=p. 104}}</ref>\n\n*cl(''S'') is a [[closed set|closed]] superset of ''S''.\n*cl(''S'') is the intersection of all [[closed set]]s containing ''S''.\n*cl(''S'') is the smallest closed set containing ''S''.\n*cl(''S'') is the union of ''S'' and its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] ∂(''S'').\n*A set ''S'' is closed [[if and only if]] ''S'' = cl(''S'').\n*If ''S'' is a subset of ''T'', then cl(''S'') is a subset of cl(''T'').\n*If ''A'' is a closed set, then ''A'' contains ''S'' if and only if ''A'' contains cl(''S'').\n\nSometimes the second or third property above is taken as the ''definition'' of the topological closure, which still make sense when applied to other types of closures (see below).<ref>{{harvnb|Gemignani|loc=p. 55}}, {{harvnb|Pervin|loc=p. 40}} and {{harvnb|Baker|loc=p. 38}} use the second property as the definition.</ref>\n\nIn a [[first-countable space]] (such as a [[metric space]]), cl(''S'') is the set of all [[limit of a sequence|limits]] of all convergent [[sequence]]s of points in ''S''. For a general topological space, this statement remains true if one replaces \"sequence\" by \"[[net (mathematics)|net]]\" or \"[[filter (mathematics)|filter]]\".\n\nNote that these properties are also satisfied if \"closure\", \"superset\", \"intersection\", \"contains/containing\", \"smallest\" and \"closed\" are replaced by \"interior\", \"subset\", \"union\", \"contained in\", \"largest\", and \"open\". For more on this matter, see [[Closure (topology)#Closure operator|closure operator]] below.\n\n==Examples==\nConsider a sphere in 3 dimensions. Implicitly there are two regions of interest created by this sphere; the sphere itself and its interior (which is called an open 3-ball). It is useful to be able to distinguish between the interior of 3-ball and the surface, so we distinguish between the open 3-ball, and the closed 3-ball - the closure of the 3-ball. The closure of the open 3-ball is the open 3-ball plus the surface.\n\nIn [[topological space]]:\n*In any space, <math>\\varnothing=\\mathrm{cl}(\\varnothing)</math>.\n*In any space ''X'', ''X'' = cl(''X'').\n\nGiving '''R''' and '''C''' the [[Standard topology|standard (metric) topology]]:\n*If ''X'' is the Euclidean space '''R''' of [[real number]]s, then cl((0, 1)) = [0, 1].\n*If ''X'' is the Euclidean space '''R''', then the closure of the set '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s is the whole space '''R'''. We say that '''Q''' is [[dense (topology)|dense]] in '''R'''.\n*If ''X'' is the [[complex number|complex plane]] '''C''' = '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, then cl({''z'' in '''C''' : |''z''| > 1}) = {''z'' in '''C''' : |''z''| ≥ 1}.\n*If ''S'' is a [[finite set|finite]] subset of a Euclidean space, then cl(''S'') = ''S''. (For a general topological space, this property is equivalent to the [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub> axiom]].)\n\nOn the set of real numbers one can put other topologies rather than the standard one.\n*If ''X'' = '''R''', where '''R''' has the [[lower limit topology]], then cl((0, 1)) = <nowiki>[</nowiki>0, 1).\n*If one considers on '''R''' the [[discrete topology]] in which every set is closed (open), then cl((0, 1)) = (0, 1).\n*If one considers on '''R''' the [[trivial topology]] in which the only closed (open) sets are the empty set and '''R''' itself, then cl((0, 1)) = '''R'''.\n\nThese examples show that the closure of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space. The last two examples are special cases of the following.\n\n*In any [[discrete space]], since every set is closed (and also open), every set is equal to its closure.\n*In any [[indiscrete space]] ''X'', since the only closed sets are the empty set and ''X'' itself, we have that the closure of the empty set is the empty set, and for every non-empty subset ''A'' of ''X'', cl(''A'') = ''X''. In other words, every non-empty subset of an indiscrete space is [[Dense set|dense]].\n\nThe closure of a set also depends upon in which space we are taking the closure. For example, if ''X'' is the set of rational numbers, with the usual [[subspace topology|relative topology]] induced by the Euclidean space '''R''', and if ''S'' = {''q'' in '''Q''' : ''q''<sup>2</sup> > 2, ''q'' > 0}, then ''S'' is closed in '''Q''', and the closure of ''S'' in '''Q''' is ''S''; however, the closure of ''S'' in the Euclidean space '''R''' is the set of all ''real numbers'' greater than ''or equal to'' <math>\\sqrt2.</math>\n\n== Closure operator ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Closure (topology)]] -->\n{{See also|Closure operator}}\n\nA '''closure operator''' on a set ''X'' is a [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] of the [[power set]] of ''X'', <math>\\mathcal{P}(X)</math>, into itself which satisfies the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]].\n\nGiven a [[topological space]] <math>(X, \\mathcal{T})</math>, the mapping <sup>&minus;</sup> : ''S'' → ''S''<sup>&minus;</sup> for all {{nowrap|1=''S'' ⊆ ''X''}} is a closure operator on ''X''. Conversely, if '''c''' is a closure operator on a set ''X'', a topological space is obtained by defining the sets ''S'' with '''c'''(''S'') = ''S'' as [[closed set]]s (so their complements are the [[open set]]s of the topology).<ref>{{harvnb|Pervin|loc=p. 41}}</ref>\n \nThe closure operator <sup>&minus;</sup> is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the  [[Interior (topology)|interior]] operator <sup>o</sup>, in the sense that\n\n:''S''<sup>&minus;</sup> = ''X'' \\ (''X'' \\ ''S'')<sup>o</sup>\n\nand also\n\n:''S''<sup>o</sup> = ''X'' \\ (''X'' \\ ''S'')<sup>&minus;</sup>\n\nwhere ''X'' denotes the underlying set of the topological space containing ''S'', and the backslash refers to the [[Complement (set theory)|set-theoretic difference]].\n\nTherefore, the abstract theory of closure operators and the Kuratowski closure axioms can be easily translated into the language of interior operators, by replacing sets with their [[Complement (set theory)|complements]].\n\n==Facts about closures==\nA set <math>S</math> is [[closed set|closed]] if and only if <math>Cl(S)=S</math>. In particular:\n* The closure of the [[empty set]] is the empty set;\n* The closure of <math>X</math> itself is <math>X</math>. \n* The closure of an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of sets is always a [[subset]] of (but need not be equal to) the intersection of the closures of the sets. \n* In a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[finite set|finite]]ly many sets, the closure of the union and the union of the closures are equal; the union of zero sets is the empty set, and so this statement contains the earlier statement about the closure of the empty set as a special case. \n* The closure of the union of infinitely many sets need not equal the union of the closures, but it is always a [[superset]] of the union of the closures.\n\nIf <math>A</math> is a [[topological subspace|subspace]] of <math>X</math> containing <math>S</math>, then the closure of <math>S</math> computed in <math>A</math> is equal to the intersection of <math>A</math> and the closure of <math>S</math> computed in <math>X</math>: <math>Cl_A(S) = A\\cap Cl_X(S)</math>. In particular, <math>S</math> is dense in <math>A</math> [[if and only if]] <math>A</math> is a subset of <math>Cl_X(S)</math>.\n\n==Categorical interpretation==\nOne may elegantly define the closure operator in terms of universal arrows, as follows.\n\nThe [[powerset]] of a set ''X'' may be realized as a [[partial order]] [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''P'' in which the objects are subsets and the morphisms are inclusions <math>A \\to B</math> whenever ''A'' is a subset of ''B''. Furthermore, a topology ''T'' on ''X'' is a subcategory of ''P'' with inclusion functor <math>I: T \\to P</math>. The set of closed subsets containing a fixed subset <math>A \\subseteq X</math> can be identified with the comma category <math> (A \\downarrow I)</math>. This category &mdash; also a partial order &mdash; then has initial object Cl(''A''). Thus there is a universal arrow from ''A'' to ''I'', given by the inclusion <math>A \\to Cl(A)</math>.\n\nSimilarly, since every closed set containing ''X'' \\ ''A'' corresponds with an open set contained in ''A'' we can interpret the category <math> (I \\downarrow X \\setminus A)</math> as the set of open subsets contained in ''A'', with terminal object <math>\\text{int}(A)</math>, the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''A''.\n\nAll properties of the closure can be derived from this definition and a few properties of the above categories.

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''complete lattice''' is a [[partially ordered set]] in which ''all'' subsets have both a [[supremum]] (join) and an [[infimum]] (meet). Complete lattices appear in many applications in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]. Being a special instance of [[lattice (order)|lattices]], they are studied both in [[order theory]] and [[universal algebra]].\n\nComplete lattices must not be confused with [[complete partial order]]s (''cpo''s), which constitute a strictly more general class of partially ordered sets. More specific complete lattices are [[complete Boolean algebra]]s and [[complete Heyting algebra]]s (''locales'').\n\n== Formal definition ==\nA [[partially ordered set]] (''L'', ≤) is a ''complete lattice'' if every [[subset]] ''A'' of ''L'' has both a [[greatest lower bound]] (the [[infimum]], also called the ''meet'') and a [[least upper bound]] (the [[supremum]], also called the ''join'') in (''L'', ≤).\n\nThe ''meet'' is denoted by <math>\\bigwedge A</math>, and the ''join'' by <math>\\bigvee A</math>.\n\nNote that in the special case where ''A'' is the [[empty set]], the meet of ''A'' will be the [[greatest element]] of ''L''. Likewise, the join of the empty set yields the [[least element]]. Since the definition also assures the existence of binary meets and joins, complete lattices thus form a special class of [[bounded lattice]]s.\n\nMore implications of the above definition are discussed in the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]] in order theory.\n\n=== Complete semilattices ===\nIn order theory, arbitrary meets can be expressed in terms of arbitrary joins and vice versa (for details, see [[completeness (order theory)]]). In effect, this means that it is sufficient to require the existence of either all meets or all joins to obtain the class of all complete lattices.\n\nAs a consequence, some authors use the terms ''complete [[meet-semilattice]]'' or ''complete [[join-semilattice]]'' as another way to refer to complete lattices. Though similar on objects, the terms entail different notions of [[homomorphism]], as will be explained in the below section on morphisms.\n\nOn the other hand, some authors have no use for this distinction of morphisms (especially since the emerging concepts of \"complete semilattice morphisms\" can as well be specified in general terms). Consequently, ''complete meet-semilattices'' have also been defined as those [[meet-semilattice]]s that are also [[complete partial order]]s. This concept is arguably the \"most complete\" notion of a meet-semilattice that is not yet a lattice (in fact, only the top element may be missing). This discussion is also found in the article on [[semilattice]]s.\n\n=== Complete sublattices ===\nA sublattice ''M'' of a complete lattice ''L'' is called a ''complete sublattice'' of ''L'' if for every subset ''A'' of ''M'' the elements <math>\\bigwedge A</math> and <math>\\bigvee A</math>, as defined in ''L'', are actually in ''M''.<ref>Burris, Stanley N., and H.P. Sankappanavar, H. P., 1981. ''[http://www.thoralf.uwaterloo.ca/htdocs/ualg.html A Course in Universal Algebra.]''  Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|3-540-90578-2}} (A monograph available free online).</ref>\n\nIf the above requirement is lessened to require only non-empty meet and joins to be in ''L'', the sublattice ''M'' is called a ''closed sublattice'' of ''M''.\n\n== Examples ==\n* Any non-empty finite lattice is trivially complete.\n* The [[power set]] of a given set, ordered by [[subset|inclusion]]. The supremum is given by the [[union (set theory)|union]] and the infimum by the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of subsets.\n* The [[unit interval]] [0,1] and the [[extended real number line]], with the familiar total order and the ordinary [[supremum|suprema]] and [[infimum|infima]].  Indeed, a totally ordered set (with its [[order topology]]) is [[Compact space|compact]] as a [[topological space]] if it is complete as a lattice.\n* The non-negative [[integer]]s, ordered by [[divisibility]]. The least element of this lattice is the number 1, since it divides any other number. Perhaps surprisingly, the greatest element is 0, because it can be divided by any other number. The supremum of finite sets is given by the [[least common multiple]] and the infimum by the [[greatest common divisor]]. For infinite sets, the supremum will always be 0 while the infimum can well be greater than 1. For example, the set of all even numbers has 2 as the greatest common divisor.  If 0 is removed from this structure it remains a lattice but ceases to be complete.\n* The subgroups of any given group under inclusion. (While the [[infimum]] here is the usual set-theoretic intersection, the [[supremum]] of a set of subgroups is the subgroup ''generated by'' the set-theoretic union of the subgroups, not the set-theoretic union itself.) If ''e'' is the identity of ''G'', then the trivial group {''e''} is the [[partial order|minimum]] subgroup of ''G'', while the [[partial order|maximum]] subgroup is the group ''G'' itself.\n* The submodules of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], ordered by inclusion. The supremum is given by the sum of submodules and the infimum by the intersection.\n* The [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], ordered by inclusion. The supremum is given by the sum of ideals and the infimum by the intersection.\n* The open sets of a [[topological space]], ordered by inclusion. The supremum is given by the union of open sets and the infimum by the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the intersection.\n* The [[convex set|convex subset]]s of a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[vector space]], ordered by inclusion. The infimum is given by the intersection of convex sets and the supremum by the [[convex hull]] of the union.\n* The [[topological space|topologies]] on a set, ordered by inclusion. The infimum is given by the intersection of topologies, and the supremum by the topology generated by the union of topologies.\n* The lattice of all [[transitive relation]]s on a set.\n* The lattice of all sub-multisets of a [[multiset]].\n* The lattice of all [[equivalence relation]]s on a set; the equivalence relation ~ is considered to be smaller (or \"finer\") than ≈ if ''x''~''y'' always implies ''x''≈''y''.\n* The lattice of self-adjoint projections (also known as orthogonal projections) of a von Neumann algebra.\n\n==Locally finite complete lattices==\nA complete lattice ''L'' is said to be locally finite if the supremum of any infinite subset is equal to 1, or equivalently, the set <math>\\{y \\in L ~|~ y \\le x\\} \\,\\!</math> is finite for any <math>1 \\ne x \\in L</math>. The lattice ('''N''', |) is locally finite. Note that in this lattice, the element generally denoted \"0\" is actually 1 and vice versa.\n\n== Morphisms of complete lattices ==\nThe traditional morphisms between complete lattices are the ''complete homomorphisms'' (or ''complete lattice homomorphisms''). These are characterized as functions that [[limit preserving (order theory)|preserve]] all joins and all meets. Explicitly, this means that a function ''f: L→M'' between two complete lattices ''L'' and ''M'' is a complete homomorphism if\n\n* <math>f\\left(\\bigwedge A\\right) = \\bigwedge\\{f(a)\\mid a\\in A\\}</math> and\n* <math>f\\left(\\bigvee A\\right) = \\bigvee\\{f(a)\\mid a\\in A\\}</math>,\n\nfor all subsets ''A'' of ''L''. Such functions are automatically [[monotonic]], but the condition of being a complete homomorphism is in fact much more specific. For this reason, it can be useful to consider weaker notions of morphisms, that are only required to preserve all joins (giving a category '''Sup''') or all meets (giving a category '''Inf'''), which are indeed inequivalent conditions.  This notion may be considered as a homomorphism of complete meet-semilattices or complete join-semilattices, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, morphisms that preserve all joins are equivalently characterized as the ''lower adjoint'' part of a unique [[Galois connection]]. Each of these determines a unique ''upper adjoint'' in the inverse direction that preserves all meets. Hence, considering complete lattices with complete semilattice morphisms boils down to considering Galois connections as morphisms. This also yields the insight that the introduced morphisms do basically describe just two different [[category theory|categories]] of complete lattices: one with complete homomorphisms and one with meet-preserving functions (upper adjoints), [[duality (category theory)|dual]] to the one with join-preserving mappings (lower adjoints).\n\n== Free construction and completion ==\n=== Free \"complete semilattices\" ===\nAs usual, the construction of [[free object]]s depends on the chosen class of morphisms. Let us first consider functions that preserve all joins (i.e. lower adjoints of Galois connections), since this case is simpler than the situation for complete homomorphisms. Using the aforementioned terminology, this could be called a ''free complete join-semilattice''.\n\nUsing the standard definition from [[universal algebra]], a free complete lattice over a generating set ''S'' is a complete lattice ''L'' together with a function ''i'':''S''→''L'', such that any function ''f'' from ''S'' to the underlying set of some complete lattice M can be ''factored uniquely'' through a morphism ''f''° from ''L'' to ''M''. Stated differently, for every element ''s'' of ''S'' we find that ''f''(''s'') = ''f''°(''i''(''s'')) and that ''f''° is the only morphism with this property. These conditions basically amount to saying that there is a functor from the category of sets and functions to the category of complete lattices and join-preserving functions which is [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from complete lattices to their underlying sets.\n\nFree complete lattices in this sense can be constructed very easily: the complete lattice generated by some set ''S'' is just the [[powerset]] 2<sup>''S''</sup>, i.e. the set of all subsets of ''S'', ordered by [[subset|subset inclusion]]. The required unit ''i'':''S''→2<sup>''S''</sup> maps any element ''s'' of ''S'' to the singleton set {''s''}. Given a mapping ''f'' as above, the function ''f''°:2<sup>S</sup>→''M'' is defined by\n \n:<math>f^\\circ (X) = \\bigvee \\{ f(s) | s \\in X \\}</math>.\n\nThen ''f''° transforms unions into suprema and thus preserves joins.\n\nOur considerations also yield a free construction for morphisms that do preserve meets instead of joins (i.e. upper adjoints of Galois connections). In fact, we merely have to [[duality (order theory)|dualize]] what was said above: free objects are given as powersets ordered by reverse inclusion, such that set union provides the meet operation, and the function ''f''° is defined in terms of meets instead of joins. The result of this construction could be called a ''free complete meet-semilattice''. One should also note how these free constructions extend those that are used to obtain [[semilattice|free semilattices]], where we only need to consider finite sets.\n\n=== Free complete lattices ===\nThe situation for complete lattices with complete homomorphisms obviously is more intricate. In fact, free complete lattices do generally not exist. Of course, one can formulate a word problem similar to the one for the case of [[lattice (order)|lattices]], but the collection of all possible [[word problem (mathematics)|words]] (or \"terms\") in this case would be a [[proper class]], because arbitrary meets and joins comprise operations for argument-sets of every [[cardinality]].\n\nThis property in itself is not a problem: as the case of free complete semilattices above shows, it can well be that the solution of the word problem leaves only a set of equivalence classes. In other words, it is possible that proper classes of the class of all terms have the same meaning and are thus identified in the free construction. However, the equivalence classes for the word problem of complete lattices are \"too small\", such that the free complete lattice would still be a proper class, which is not allowed.\n\nNow one might still hope that there are some useful cases where the set of generators is sufficiently small for a free complete lattice to exist. Unfortunately, the size limit is very low and we have the following theorem:\n\n: The free complete lattice on three generators does not exist; it is properly a [[proper class]].\n\nA proof of this statement is given by Johnstone;<ref>P. T. Johnstone, ''Stone Spaces'', Cambridge University Press, 1982; ''(see paragraph 4.7)''</ref> the original argument is attributed to [[Alfred W. Hales]];<ref>[[Alfred W. Hales|A. W. Hales]], ''On the non-existence of free complete Boolean algebras'', Fundamenta Mathematicae 54: pp.45-66.</ref> see also the article on [[free lattice]]s.\n\n=== Completion ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Completely distributive lattice]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\n\nIf a complete lattice is freely generated from a given ''poset'' used in place of the set of generators considered above, then one speaks of a ''completion'' of the poset. The definition of the result of this operation is similar to the above definition of free objects, where \"sets\" and \"functions\" are replaced by \"posets\" and \"monotone mappings\". Likewise, one can describe the completion process as a functor from the category of posets with monotone functions to some category of complete lattices with appropriate morphisms that is left adjoint to the forgetful functor in the converse direction.\n\nAs long as one considers meet- or join-preserving functions as morphisms, this can easily be achieved through the so-called [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]]. For this process, elements of the poset are mapped to (Dedekind-) ''cuts'', which can then be mapped to the underlying posets of arbitrary complete lattices in much the same way as done for sets and free complete (semi-) lattices above.\n\nThe aforementioned result that free complete lattices do not exist entails that an according free construction from a poset is not possible either. This is easily seen by considering posets with a discrete order, where every element only relates to itself. These are exactly the free posets on an underlying set. Would there be a free construction of complete lattices from posets, then both constructions could be composed, which contradicts the negative result above.\n\n== Representation ==\nAlready G. Birkhoff's ''Lattice Theory'' book<ref name=\"Birkhoff\">Garrett Birkhoff, ''Lattice Theory'', AMS Colloquium Publications Vol. 25, {{ISBN|978-0821810255}}</ref> contains a very useful representation method. It associates a complete lattice to any binary relation between two sets by constructing a [[Galois connection]] from the relation, which then leads to two dually isomorphic [[closure operator|closure systems]]. Closure systems are intersection-closed families of sets. When ordered by the subset relation &sube;, they are complete lattices.\n\nA special instance of Birkhoff's construction starts from an arbitrary poset ''(P,&le;)'' and constructs the Galois connection from the order relation &le; between ''P'' and itself. The resulting complete lattice is the [[Dedekind-MacNeille completion]]. When this completion is applied to a poset that already is a complete lattice, then the result is [[order-isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the original one. Thus we immediately find that every complete lattice is represented by Birkhoff's method, up to isomorphism.\n\nThe construction is utilized in [[formal concept analysis]], where one represents real-word data by binary relations (called ''formal contexts'') and uses the associated complete lattices (called ''concept lattices'') for data analysis. The mathematics behind formal concept analysis therefore is the theory of complete lattices.\n\nAnother representation is obtained as follows: A subset of a complete lattice is itself a complete lattice (when ordered with the induced order) if and only if it is the image of an [[closure operator|increasing and idempotent]] (but not necessarily extensive) self-map. \nThe identity mapping obviously has these two properties. Thus all complete lattices occur.\n\n== Further results ==\nBesides the previous representation results, there are some other statements that can be made about complete lattices, or that take a particularly simple form in this case. An example is the [[Knaster–Tarski theorem]], which states that the set of [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of a monotone function on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice. This is easily seen to be a generalization of the above observation about the images of increasing and idempotent functions, since these are instances of the theorem.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[lattice (order)]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Complete Lattice}}\n[[Category:Lattice theory]]\n[[Category:Closure operators]]"

Let ''S'' be a subset of a topological space ''X''.  Then ''x'' is an interior point of ''S'' if ''x'' is contained in an open subset of ''X'' which is completely contained in ''S''.   (Equivalently, ''x'' is an interior point of ''S'' if ''S'' is a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x''.)\n\n=== Interior of a set ===\n\nThe '''interior''' of a set ''S'' is the set of all interior points of ''S''. The interior of ''S'' is denoted int(''S''), Int(''S'') or ''S''<sup>o</sup>. The interior of a set has the following properties.\n\n*int(''S'') is an [[Open set|open]] subset of ''S''.\n*int(''S'') is the union of all open sets contained in ''S''.\n*int(''S'') is the largest open set contained in ''S''.\n*A set ''S'' is open [[if and only if]] ''S'' = int(''S'').\n*int(int(''S'')) = int(''S'') ([[idempotent|idempotence]]).\n*If ''S'' is a subset of ''T'', then int(''S'') is a subset of int(''T'').\n*If ''A'' is an open set, then ''A'' is a subset of ''S'' if and only if ''A'' is a subset of int(''S'').\n\nSometimes the second or third property above is taken as the ''definition'' of the topological interior.\n\nNote that these properties are also satisfied if \"interior\", \"subset\", \"union\", \"contained in\", \"largest\" and \"open\" are replaced by \"closure\", \"superset\", \"intersection\", \"which contains\", \"smallest\", and \"closed\", respectively. For more on this matter, see [[Interior (topology)#Interior operator|interior operator]] below.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Set of real numbers with epsilon-neighbourhood.svg|thumb|a is an interior point of M, because there is an ε-neighbourhood of a which is a subset of M.]]\n*In any space, the interior of the empty set is the empty set.\n*In any space ''X'', if <math> A\\subset X </math>, then int(''A'') is contained in ''A''.\n*If ''X'' is the Euclidean space <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> of [[real number]]s, then int([0, 1]) = (0, 1).\n*If ''X'' is the Euclidean space <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>, then the interior of the set <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> of [[rational number]]s is empty.\n*If ''X'' is the [[complex number|complex plane]] <math>\\mathbb{C} = \\mathbb{R}^2</math>, then <math>\\mathrm{int}(\\{z\\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\leq 1\\}) = \\{z\\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| < 1\\}.</math>\n*In any Euclidean space, the interior of any [[finite set|finite]] set is the empty set.\n\nOn the set of real numbers, one can put other topologies rather than the standard one.\n\n*If <math> X = \\mathbb{R}</math>, where <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> has the [[lower limit topology]], then int([0, 1]) = <nowiki>[0, 1)</nowiki>. \n*If one considers on <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> the topology in which every set is open, then int([0, 1]) = [0, 1].\n*If one considers on <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> the topology in which the only open sets are the empty set and <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> itself, then int([0, 1]) is the empty set. \n\nThese examples show that the interior of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space.

It was rediscovered and axiomatized by [[Vadim Arsenyevich Efremovich|V. A. Efremovič]] in 1934 under the name of '''infinitesimal space''', but not published until 1951. In the interim, {{harvs|txt|first=A. D. |last=Wallace|authorlink=A. D. Wallace|year=1941}} discovered a version of the same concept under the name of '''separation space'''.\n\n'''Definition''' A '''proximity space''' (''X'',&nbsp;'''δ''') is a set ''X'' with a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] '''δ''' between subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following properties:\n\nFor all subsets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' of ''X''\n# ''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' ⇒ ''B'' '''δ''' ''A''\n# ''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' ⇒ ''A'' ≠ ø\n# ''A''∩''B'' ≠ ø ⇒ ''A'' '''δ''' ''B''\n# ''A'' '''δ''' (''B''∪''C'') ⇔ (''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' or ''A'' '''δ''' ''C'')\n# (∀''E'', ''A'' '''δ''' ''E'' or ''B'' '''δ''' (''X''&minus;''E'')) ⇒ ''A'' '''δ''' ''B''\nProximity without the first axiom is called '''quasi-proximity''' (but then Axioms 2 and 4 must be stated in a two-sided fashion).\n\nIf ''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' we say ''A'' is near ''B'' or ''A'' and ''B'' are proximal; otherwise we say ''A'' and ''B'' are apart. We say ''B'' is a proximal or '''δ'''-neighborhood of ''A'', written ''A'' « ''B'', if and only if ''A'' and ''X''&minus;''B'' are apart.\n\nThe main properties of this set neighborhood relation, listed below, provide an alternative axiomatic characterization of proximity spaces.\n\nFor all subsets ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' of ''X''\n# ''X'' « ''X''\n# ''A'' « ''B'' ⇒ ''A'' ⊆ ''B''\n# ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' « ''C'' ⊆ ''D'' ⇒ ''A'' « ''D''\n# (''A'' « ''B'' and ''A'' « ''C'') ⇒ ''A'' « ''B''∩''C''\n# ''A'' « ''B'' ⇒ ''X''&minus;''B'' « ''X''&minus;''A''\n# ''A'' « ''B'' ⇒ ∃''E'', ''A'' « ''E'' « ''B''.\n\nA proximity space is called ''separated'' if {''x''} '''δ''' {''y''} implies ''x'' = ''y''.\n\nA ''proximity'' or ''proximal map'' is one that preserves nearness, that is, given ''f'':(''X'','''δ''') → (''X''*,'''δ'''*), if ''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' in ''X'', then ''f''[''A''] '''δ'''* ''f''[''B''] in ''X''*. Equivalently, a map is proximal if the inverse map preserves proximal neighborhoodness. In the same notation, this means if ''C'' «* ''D'' holds in ''X''*, then ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>[''C''] « ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>[''D''] holds in ''X''.\n\nGiven a proximity space, one can define a topology by letting ''A'' ↦ {''x''&nbsp;:&nbsp;{''x''} '''δ''' ''A''} be a [[Kuratowski closure operator]]. If the proximity space is separated, the resulting topology is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. Proximity maps will be continuous between the induced topologies.\n\nThe resulting topology is always [[completely regular]]. This can be proven by imitating the usual proofs of [[Urysohn's lemma]], using the last property of proximal neighborhoods to create the infinite increasing chain used in proving the lemma.\n\nGiven a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique proximity whose corresponding topology is the given topology: ''A'' is near ''B'' if and only if their closures intersect. More generally, proximities classify the [[compactification (mathematics)|compactifications]] of a completely regular Hausdorff space.\n\nA [[uniform space]] X induces a proximity relation by declaring ''A'' is near ''B'' if and only if ''A''&times;''B'' has nonempty intersection with every entourage. [[Uniformly continuous]] maps will then be proximally continuous.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{citation|MR=0040748 |last=Efremovič|first= V.

      "text": "{{for|other radicals|radical of a ring}}\nIn [[commutative ring]] theory, a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''radical of an ideal''' ''I'' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] such that an element ''x'' is in the radical if and only if some power of ''x'' is in ''I''. (Taking the radical is called ''radicalization''.) A '''radical ideal''' (or '''semiprime ideal''') is an ideal that is equal to its own radical. The radical of a [[primary ideal]] is a prime ideal.\n\nThis concept is generalized to noncommutative rings in the [[Semiprime ring]] article.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe '''radical''' of an ideal ''I'' in a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', denoted by Rad(''I'') or <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>, is defined as\n:<math>\\sqrt{I}=\\{r\\in R \\mid r^n\\in I\\ \\hbox{for some positive integer}\\ n\\}.</math>\n\n(Note that <math>I\\subset\\sqrt{I}</math>.)\nIntuitively, <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> is obtained by taking all roots of elements of ''I'' within the ring ''R''. Equivalently, <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> is the pre-image of the ideal of nilpotent elements (the [[nilradical of a ring|nilradical]]) in the [[quotient ring]] <math>R/I</math>.  The latter shows <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> is itself an ideal.<ref group=\"Note\">Here is a direct proof. Start with ''a'', ''b'' &isin; <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> with some powers ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''b''<sup>''m''</sup> &isin; ''I''. To show that ''a''+''b'' &isin; <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>, we use the [[binomial theorem]] (which holds for any commutative ring):\n\n:<math>\\textstyle (a+b)^{n+m-1}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n+m-1}\\binom{n+m-1}{i}a^ib^{n+m-1-i}.</math>\n\nFor each ''i'', we have either ''i'' &ge; ''n'' or ''n''+''m''&minus;1&minus;''i'' &ge; ''m''. Thus, in each term ''a''<sup>''i''</sup>''b''<sup>''n''+''m''&minus;1&minus;''i''</sup>, one of the exponents will be large enough to make that factor lie in ''I''. Since any element of ''I'' times an element of ''R'' lies in ''I'' (as ''I'' is an ideal), this term lies in ''I''. Hence (''a''+''b'')<sup>''n''+''m''&minus;1</sup> &isin; ''I'', and ''a''+''b'' &isin; <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>.\n\nTo finish checking that the radical is an ideal, take ''a'' &isin; <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> with ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> &isin; ''I'', and any ''r'' &isin; ''R''.  Then (''ra'')<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''<sup>''n''</sup>''a''<sup>''n''</sup> &isin; ''I'', so ''ra'' &isin; <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>. Thus the radical is an ideal.</ref>\n\nIf the radical of ''I'' is finitely generated, then some power of <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> is contained in ''I''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Proposition 7.14}}</ref> In particular, if ''I'' and ''J'' are ideals of a [[noetherian ring]], then ''I'' and ''J'' have the same radical if and only if ''I'' contains some power of ''J'' and ''J'' contains some power of ''I''.\n\nIf an ideal ''I'' coincides with its own radical, then ''I'' is called a ''radical ideal'' or ''[[semiprime ideal]]''.\n\n==Examples==\n* Consider the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s.\n# The radical of the ideal 4'''Z''' of integer multiples of 4 is 2'''Z'''.\n# The radical of 5'''Z''' is 5'''Z'''.\n# The radical of 12'''Z''' is 6'''Z'''.\n# In general, the radical of ''m'''''Z''' is ''r'''''Z''', where ''r'' is the product of all distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''m'', the largest [[square-free integer|square-free]] factor of ''m'' (see [[radical of an integer]]). In fact, this generalizes to an arbitrary ideal (see the Properties section).\n\n* Consider the ideal <math>I=(y^4)\\sub\\Complex[x,y].</math> It is trivial to show <math>\\sqrt{I}=(y)</math> (using the basic property <math>\\sqrt{I^n} = \\sqrt{I}</math>), but we give some alternative methods.{{clarify|The following, which is nice, seems to be using the [[Hilbert nullstellensaz]] implicitly.|date=January 2019}} The radical <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> corresponds to the [[nilradical of a ring|nilradical]] <math>\\sqrt{0}</math> of the quotient ring <math>R = \\Complex[x,y]/(y^4),</math> which is the intersection of all prime ideals of the quotient ring. This is contained in the [[Jacobson radical]], which is the intersection of all maximal ideals, which are the kernels of homomorphisms to fields. Any ring morphism <math>R \\to \\Complex</math> must have <math>y</math> in the kernel in order to have a well-defined morphism (if we said, for example, that the kernel should be <math>(x,y-1)</math> the composition of <math>\\Complex[x,y] \\to R \\to \\Complex</math> would be <math>(x, y^4, y-1)</math> which is the same as trying to force <math>1=0</math>). Since <math>\\Complex</math> is algebraically closed, every morphism <math>R \\to \\mathbb{F}</math> must factor through <math>\\Complex,</math> so we only have the compute the intersection of <math>\\{\\ker(\\Phi) : \\Phi \\in \\text{Hom}(R,\\Complex) \\}</math> to compute the radical of <math>(0).</math> We then find that <math>\\sqrt{0} = (y) \\subset R.</math>\n\n==Properties==\nThis section will continue the convention that ''I'' is an ideal of a commutative ring ''R'':\n\n*It is always true that <math>\\sqrt{\\sqrt{I}} = \\sqrt{I}</math>, i.e. radicalization is an [[idempotent]] operation. Moreover, <math>\\sqrt{I}</math> is the smallest radical ideal containing ''I''.\n*<math>\\sqrt{I}</math> is the intersection of all the prime ideals of ''R'' that contain ''I'', and thus the radical of a prime ideal is equal to itself. Proof: On one hand, every prime ideal is radical, and so this intersection contains <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>.  Suppose ''r'' is an element of ''R'' which is not in <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>, and let ''S'' be the set <math>\\{r^n\\mid n=0,1,2,...\\}</math>. By the definition of <math>\\sqrt{I}</math>, ''S'' must be disjoint from ''I''. ''S'' is also [[multiplicatively closed subset|multiplicatively closed]]. Thus, by a variant of [[Krull's theorem]], there exists a prime ideal ''P'' that contains ''I'' and is still disjoint from ''S''. (see [[prime ideal]].) Since ''P'' contains ''I'', but not ''r'', this shows that ''r'' is not in the intersection of prime ideals containing ''I''. This finishes the proof. The statement may be strengthened a bit: the radical of ''I'' is the intersection of all prime ideals of ''R'' that are [[Minimal prime (commutative algebra)|minimal]] among those containing ''I''.\n*Specializing the last point, the nilradical (the set of all nilpotent elements) is equal to the intersection of all prime ideals of ''R''.\n*An ideal ''I'' in a ring ''R'' is radical if and only if the [[quotient ring]] ''R/I'' is [[reduced ring|reduced]].\n*The radical of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.\n*The radical of an intersection of ideals is equal to the intersection of their radicals: <math> \\sqrt{I \\cap J} = \\sqrt{I} \\cap \\sqrt{J}</math>.\n*The radical of a [[primary ideal]] is prime. If the radical of an ideal ''I'' is maximal, then ''I'' is primary.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Proposition 4.2}}</ref>\n*If ''I'' is an ideal, <math>\\sqrt{I^n} = \\sqrt{I}</math>.

      "text": "'''Domain theory''' is a   branch of [[mathematics]] that studies special kinds of [[partially ordered set]]s (posets) commonly called '''domains'''. Consequently, domain theory can be considered as a branch of [[order theory]]. The field has major applications in [[computer science]], where it is used to specify [[denotational semantics]], especially for [[functional programming|functional programming languages]]. Domain theory formalizes the intuitive ideas of approximation and convergence in a very general way and has close relations to [[topology]]. \n\nAn alternative important approach to denotational semantics in computer science is that of [[metric space]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Motivation and intuition ==\n\nThe primary motivation for the study of domains, which was initiated by [[Dana Scott]] in the late 1960s, was the search for a [[denotational semantics]] of the [[lambda calculus]]. In this formalism, one considers \"functions\" specified by certain terms in the language. In a purely [[syntax|syntactic]] way, one can go from simple functions to functions that take other functions as their input arguments. Using again just the syntactic transformations available in this formalism, one can obtain so called [[fixed-point combinator]]s (the best-known of which is the [[Fixed-point combinator#Y combinator|Y combinator]]); these, by definition, have the property that ''f''('''Y'''(''f'')) = '''Y'''(''f'') for all functions ''f''.\n\nTo formulate such a denotational semantics, one might first try to construct a ''model'' for the lambda calculus, in which a genuine (total) function is associated with each lambda term. Such a model would formalize a link between the lambda calculus as a purely syntactic system and the lambda calculus as a notational system for manipulating concrete mathematical functions. The [[combinator calculus]] is such a model. However, the elements of the combinator calculus are functions from functions to functions; in order for the elements of a model of the lambda calculus to be of arbitrary domain and range, they could not be true functions, only [[partial functions]].\n\nScott got around this difficulty by formalizing a notion of \"partial\" or \"incomplete\" information to represent computations that have not yet returned a result. This was modeled by considering, for each domain of computation (e.g. the natural numbers), an additional element that represents an ''undefined'' output, i.e. the \"result\" of a computation that never ends. In addition, the domain of computation is equipped with an ''ordering relation'', in which the \"undefined result\" is the [[least element]].\n\nThe important step to find a model for the lambda calculus is to consider only those functions (on such a partially ordered set) which are guaranteed to have least fixed points. The set of these functions, together with an appropriate ordering, is again a \"domain\" in the sense of the theory. But the restriction to a subset of all available functions has another great benefit: it is possible to obtain domains that contain their own [[function space]]s, i.e. one gets functions that can be applied to themselves.\n\nBeside these desirable properties, domain theory also allows for an appealing intuitive interpretation. As mentioned above, the domains of computation are always partially ordered. This ordering represents a hierarchy of information or knowledge. The higher an element is within the order, the more specific it is and the more information it contains. Lower elements represent incomplete knowledge or intermediate results.\n\nComputation then is modeled by applying [[monotonic|monotone]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s repeatedly on elements of the domain in order to refine a result. Reaching a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] is equivalent to finishing a calculation. Domains provide a superior setting for these ideas since fixed points of monotone functions can be guaranteed to exist and, under additional restrictions, can be approximated from below.\n\n== A guide to the formal definitions ==\n\nIn this section, the central concepts and definitions of domain theory will be introduced. The above intuition of domains being ''information orderings'' will be emphasized to motivate the mathematical formalization of the theory. The precise formal definitions are to be found in the dedicated articles for each concept. A list of general order-theoretic definitions which include domain theoretic notions as well can be found in the [[order theory glossary]]. The most important concepts of domain theory will nonetheless be introduced below.\n\n=== Directed sets as converging specifications ===\n\nAs mentioned before, domain theory deals with [[partially ordered set]]s to model a domain of computation. The goal is to interpret the elements of such an order as ''pieces of information'' or ''(partial) results of a computation'', where elements that are higher in the order extend the information of the elements below them in a consistent way. From this simple intuition it is already clear that domains often do not have a [[greatest element]], since this would mean that there is an element that contains the information of ''all'' other elements—a rather uninteresting situation.\n\nA concept that plays an important role in the theory is that of a '''[[directed set|directed subset]]''' of a domain; a directed subset is a non-empty subset of the order in which any two elements have an [[upper bound]] that is an element of this subset. In view of our intuition about domains, this means that any two pieces of information within the directed subset are ''consistently'' extended by some other element in the subset. Hence we can view directed subsets as ''consistent specifications'', i.e. as sets of partial results in which no two elements are contradictory. This interpretation can be compared with the notion of a [[convergent sequence]] in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], where each element is more specific than the preceding one. Indeed, in the theory of [[metric space]]s, sequences play a role that is in many aspects analogous to the role of directed sets in domain theory.\n\nNow, as in the case of sequences, we are interested in the ''limit'' of a directed set. According to what was said above, this would be an element that is the most general piece of information that extends the information of all elements of the directed set, i.e. the unique element that contains ''exactly'' the information that was present in the directed set, and nothing more. In the formalization of order theory, this is just the '''[[least upper bound]]''' of the directed set. As in the case of limits of sequences, least upper bounds of directed sets do not always exist.\n\nNaturally, one has a special interest in those domains of computations in which all consistent specifications ''converge'', i.e. in orders in which all directed sets have a least upper bound. This property defines the class of '''[[directed complete partial order|directed-complete partial order]]s''', or '''dcpo''' for short. Indeed, most considerations of domain theory do only consider orders that are at least directed complete.\n\nFrom the underlying idea of partially specified results as representing incomplete knowledge, one derives another desirable property: the existence of a '''[[least element]]'''. Such an element models that state of no information—the place where most computations start. It also can be regarded as the output of a computation that does not return any result at all.\n\n=== Computations and domains ===\n\nNow that we have some basic formal descriptions of what a domain of computation should be, we can turn to the computations themselves. Clearly, these have to be functions, taking inputs from some computational domain and returning outputs in  some (possibly different) domain. However, one would also expect that the output of a function will contain more information when the information content of the input is increased. Formally, this means that we want a function to be '''[[monotonic]]'''.\n\nWhen dealing with '''[[complete partial order|dcpos]]''', one might also want computations to be compatible with the formation of limits of a directed set. Formally, this means that, for some function ''f'', the image ''f''(''D'') of a directed set ''D'' (i.e. the set of the images of each element of ''D'') is again directed and has as a least upper bound the image of the least upper bound of ''D''. One could also say that ''f'' ''[[limit-preserving function (order theory)|preserves]] directed suprema''. Also note that, by considering directed sets of two elements, such a function also has to be monotonic. These properties give rise to the notion of a '''[[Scott-continuous]]''' function. Since this often is not ambiguous one also may speak of ''continuous functions''.\n\n=== Approximation and finiteness ===\n\nDomain theory is a purely ''qualitative'' approach to modeling the structure of information states. One can say that something contains more information, but the amount of additional information is not specified. Yet, there are some situations in which one wants to speak about elements that are in a sense much simpler (or much more incomplete) than a given state of information. For example, in the natural subset-inclusion ordering on some [[powerset]], any infinite element (i.e. set) is much more \"informative\" than any of its ''finite'' subsets.\n\nIf one wants to model such a relationship, one may first want to consider the induced strict order < of a domain with order ≤. However, while this is a useful notion in the case of total orders, it does not tell us much in the case of partially ordered sets. Considering again inclusion-orders of sets, a set is already strictly smaller than another, possibly infinite, set if it contains just one less element. One would, however, hardly agree that this captures the notion of being \"much simpler\".\n\n===Way-below relation===\n\nA more elaborate approach leads to the definition of the so-called '''order of approximation''', which is more suggestively also called the '''way-below relation'''. An element ''x'' is ''way below'' an element ''y'', if, for every directed set ''D'' with supremum such that\n\n:<math> y \\sqsubseteq \\sup D </math>,\n\nthere is some element ''d'' in ''D'' such that\n\n:<math> x \\sqsubseteq d </math>.\n\nThen one also says that ''x'' ''approximates'' ''y'' and writes\n\n:<math> x \\ll y </math>.\n\nThis does imply that\n\n:<math> x \\sqsubseteq y </math>,\n\nsince the singleton set {''y''} is directed. For an example, in an ordering of sets, an infinite set is way above any of its finite subsets. On the other hand, consider the directed set (in fact: the chain) of finite sets\n\n:<math> \\{0\\}, \\{0, 1\\}, \\{0, 1, 2\\}, \\ldots </math>\n\nSince the supremum of this chain is the set of all natural numbers '''N''', this shows that no infinite set is way below '''N'''.\n\nHowever, being way below some element is a ''relative'' notion and does not reveal much about an element alone. For example, one would like to characterize finite sets in an order-theoretic way, but even infinite sets can be way below some other set. The special property of these '''finite''' elements ''x'' is that they are way below themselves, i.e.\n\n:<math> x \\ll x</math>.\n\nAn element with this property is also called '''[[compact element|compact]]'''. Yet, such elements do not have to be \"finite\" nor \"compact\" in any other mathematical usage of the terms. The notation is nonetheless motivated by certain parallels to the respective notions in [[set theory]] and [[topology]]. The compact elements of a domain have the important special property that they cannot be obtained as a limit of a directed set in which they did not already occur.\n\nMany other important results about the way-below relation support the claim that this definition is appropriate to capture many important aspects of a domain.\n\n=== Bases of domains ===\n\nThe previous thoughts raise another question: is it possible to guarantee that all elements of a domain can be obtained as a limit of much simpler elements? This is quite relevant in practice, since we cannot compute infinite objects but we may still hope to approximate them arbitrarily closely.\n\nMore generally, we would like to restrict to a certain subset of elements as being sufficient for getting all other elements as least upper bounds. Hence, one defines a '''base''' of a poset ''P'' as being a subset ''B'' of ''P'', such that, for each ''x'' in ''P'', the set of elements in ''B'' that are way below ''x'' contains a directed set with supremum ''x''. The poset ''P'' is a ''continuous poset'' if it has some base. Especially, ''P'' itself is a base in this situation. In many applications, one restricts to continuous (d)cpos as a main object of study.\n\nFinally, an even stronger restriction on a partially ordered set is given by requiring the existence of a base of ''compact'' elements. Such a poset is called '''[[algebraic poset|algebraic]]'''. From the viewpoint of denotational semantics, algebraic posets are particularly well-behaved, since they allow for the approximation of all elements even when restricting to finite ones. As remarked before, not every finite element is \"finite\" in a classical sense and it may well be that the finite elements constitute an [[uncountable]] set.\n\nIn some cases, however, the base for a poset is [[countable]]. In this case, one speaks of an '''ω-continuous''' poset. Accordingly, if the countable base consists entirely of finite elements, we obtain an order that is '''ω-algebraic'''.\n\n=== Special types of domains ===\n\nA simple special case of a domain is known as an '''elementary''' or '''flat domain'''.  This consists of a set of incomparable elements, such as the integers, along with a single \"bottom\" element considered smaller than all other elements.\n\nOne can obtain a number of other interesting special classes of ordered structures that could be suitable as \"domains\". We already mentioned continuous posets and algebraic posets. More special versions of both are continuous and algebraic [[complete partial order|cpos]]. Adding even further [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]] one obtains [[Lattice (order)#Continuity and algebraicity|continuous lattices]] and [[algebraic lattices]], which are just [[complete lattice]]s with the respective properties. For the algebraic case, one finds broader classes of posets which are still worth studying: historically, the [[Scott domain]]s were the first structures to be studied in domain theory. Still wider classes of domains are constituted by [[SFP-domain]]s, [[L-domain]]s, and [[bifinite domain]]s.\n\nAll of these classes of orders can be cast into various [[category theory|categories]] of dcpos, using functions which are monotone, Scott-continuous, or even more specialized as morphisms. Finally, note that the term ''domain'' itself is not exact and thus is only used as an abbreviation when a formal definition has been given before or when the details are irrelevant.\n\n== Important results ==\n\nA poset ''D'' is a dcpo if and only if each chain in ''D'' has a supremum.\n\nIf ''f'' is a continuous function on a domain ''D'' then it has a least fixed point, given as the least upper bound of all finite iterations of ''f'' on the least element ⊥:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{fix}(f) = \\bigsqcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} f^n(\\bot)</math>.\n\nThis is the [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]].

Every complemented distributive lattice has a unique orthocomplementation and is in fact a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].\n\n==Definition and basic properties==\nA '''complemented lattice''' is a bounded lattice (with [[least element]] 0 and [[greatest element]] 1), in which every element ''a'' has a '''complement''', i.e. an element ''b'' such that\n::''a'' ∨ ''b'' = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''a'' ∧ ''b'' = 0.\n\nIn general an element may have more than one complement.

In other words, a relatively complemented lattice is characterized by the property that for every element ''a'' in an interval [''c'', ''d''] there is an element ''b'' such that\n::''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''d'' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''c''.\nSuch an element ''b'' is called a complement of ''a'' relative to the interval. \n\nA distributive lattice is complemented if and only if it is bounded and relatively complemented.<ref>Grätzer (1971), Lemma I.6.2, p. 48.

The lattice of subspaces of an [[inner product space]], and the [[orthogonal complement]] operation, provides an example of an orthocomplemented lattice that is not, in general, distributive.<ref>[http://unapologetic.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/orthogonal-complements-and-the-lattice-of-subspaces/ The Unapologetic Mathematician: Orthogonal Complements and the Lattice of Subspaces].</ref>\n\n<gallery Caption=\"Some complemented lattices\">\nImage:Smallest_nonmodular_lattice_1.svg|In the pentagon lattice ''N''<sub>5</sub>, the node on the right-hand side has two complements.\nImage:Diamond lattice.svg|The diamond lattice ''M''<sub>3</sub> admits no orthocomplementation.\nImage:Lattice M4.svg|The lattice ''M''<sub>4</sub> admits 3 orthocomplementations.\nImage:Hexagon lattice.svg|The hexagon lattice admits a unique orthocomplementation, but it is not uniquely complemented.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are a special case of orthocomplemented lattices, which in turn are a special case of complemented lattices (with extra structure). The ortholattices are most often used in [[quantum logic]], where the [[Closed set|closed]] [[Linear subspace|subspaces]] of a [[Separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] represent quantum propositions and behave as an orthocomplemented lattice.\n\nOrthocomplemented lattices, like Boolean algebras, satisfy [[de Morgan's laws]]:\n\n* (''a'' ∨ ''b'')<sup>⊥</sup> = ''a''<sup>⊥</sup> ∧ ''b''<sup>⊥</sup>\n* (''a'' ∧ ''b'')<sup>⊥</sup> = ''a''<sup>⊥</sup> ∨ ''b''<sup>⊥</sup>.\n\n==Orthomodular lattices==\n\nA lattice is called [[modular lattice|modular]] if for all elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' the implication\n::if ''a'' ≤ ''c'', then ''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ ''c''\nholds. This is weaker than distributivity; e.g. the above-shown lattice ''M''<sub>3</sub> is modular, but not distributive. A natural further weakening of this condition for orthocomplemented lattices, necessary for applications in quantum logic, is to require it only in the special case ''b'' = ''a''<sup>⊥</sup>. An '''orthomodular lattice''' is therefore defined as an orthocomplemented lattice such that for any two elements the implication\n::if ''a'' ≤ ''c'', then ''a'' ∨ (''a''<sup>⊥</sup> ∧ ''c'') = ''c''\nholds.\n\nLattices of this form are of crucial importance for the study of [[quantum logic]], since they are part of the axiomisation of the [[Hilbert space]] [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]] observed that the propositional calculus in quantum logic is \"formally indistinguishable from the calculus of linear subspaces [of a Hilbert space] with respect to set products, linear sums and orthogonal complements\" corresponding to the roles of ''and'', ''or'' and ''not'' in Boolean lattices. This remark has spurred interest in the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space, which form an orthomodular lattice.<ref name=\"PadmanabhanRudeanu2008\">{{cite book|author1=Ranganathan Padmanabhan|author2=Sergiu Rudeanu|title=Axioms for lattices and boolean algebras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlXSlpmlSv4C&pg=PA128|year=2008|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-283-454-6|page=128}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pseudocomplemented lattice]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Birkhoff | first1=Garrett | title=Lattice Theory | publisher=American Mathematical Society | year=1961 }}\n* {{Cite book | last1=Grätzer | first1=George | title=Lattice Theory: First Concepts and Distributive Lattices | publisher=W.
