      "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nA '''logarithmic number system''' ('''LNS''') is an arithmetic system used for representing [[real number]]s in computer and [[Digital electronics|digital hardware]], especially for [[digital signal processing]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nIn an LNS, a number, <math>X</math>, is represented by the [[logarithm]], <math>x</math>, of its [[absolute value]] as follows:\n:<math>X\\rightarrow\\{s,x=\\log_b(|X|)\\},</math>\n\nwhere <math>s</math> is a bit denoting the sign of <math>X</math> (<math>s=0</math> if <math>X>0</math> and <math>s=1</math> if <math>X<0</math>).\n\nThe number <math>x</math> is represented by a binary word which usually is in the [[two's complement]] format. An LNS can be considered as a [[floating-point]] number with the [[significand]] being always equal to 1 and a non-integer [[Exponentiation|exponent]]. This formulation simplifies the operations of multiplication, division, powers and roots, since they are reduced down to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the operations of addition and subtraction are more complicated and they are calculated by the formula:\n:<math>\\log_b(|X|+|Y|)=x+s_b(y-x)</math>\n:<math> \\log_b(||X|-|Y||)=x+d_b(y-x),</math>\n\nwhere the \"sum\" function is defined by <math>s_b(z)=\\log_b(1+b^z)</math>, and the \"difference\" function by <math>d_b(z)=\\log_b(|1-b^z|)</math>. These functions <math>s_b(z)</math> and <math>d_b(z)</math> are also known as [[Gaussian logarithm]]s.\n\nThe simplification of multiplication, division, roots, and powers is counterbalanced by the cost of evaluating these functions for addition and subtraction. This added cost of evaluation may not be critical when using an LNS primarily for increasing the precision of floating-point math operations.\n\n== {{anchor|SLNS|Focus}}History ==\n\nLogarithmic number systems have been [[Multiple discovery|independently invented]] and published at least three times as an alternative to [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] number systems.<ref name=\"Lee_1979_1\"/>\n\nNicholas Kingsbury and Peter Rayner introduced \"logarithmic arithmetic\" for [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) in 1971.<ref name=\"Kingsbury_1971\"/>\n\nA similar LNS named \"signed logarithmic number system\" (SLNS) was described in 1975 by Earl Swartzlander and Aristides Alexopoulos; rather than use two's complement notation for the logarithms, they [[offset binary|offset]] them (scale the numbers being represented) to avoid negative logs.<ref name=\"Swartzlander_1975\"/>\n\nSamuel Lee and Albert Edgar described a similar system, which they called the \"Focus\" number system, in 1977.<ref name=\"Lee_1977_1\"/><ref name=\"Lee_1979_1\"/><ref name=\"Lee_1977_2\"/><ref name=\"Lee_1979_2\"/>\n\nThe mathematical foundations for addition and subtraction in an LNS trace back to [[Zecchini Leonelli]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in the early 1800s.<ref name=\"Leonelli_1802\"/><ref name=\"Leonhardi_1806\"/><ref name=\"Gauss_1808\"/><ref name=\"Theodora\"/><ref name=\"Dunnington_2004\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|GRAPE|ELM}}Applications ==\n\nA LNS has been used in the [[Gravity Pipe]] ([[GRAPE-5]]) special-purpose supercomputer<ref name=\"Makino_1998\"/> that won the [[Gordon Bell Prize]] in 1999.\n\nA substantial effort to explore the applicability of LNSs as a viable alternative to floating point for general-purpose processing of single-precision real numbers is described in the context of the ''European Logarithmic Microprocessor'' (ELM).<ref name=\"Coleman_2001\"/><ref name=\"Coleman_2008\"/> A fabricated prototype of the processor, which has a 32-bit cotransformation-based LNS [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), demonstrated LNSs as a \"more accurate alternative to floating-point\", with improved speed. Further improvement of the LNS design based on the ELM architecture has shown its capability to offer significantly higher speed and accuracy than floating-point as well.<ref name=\"Ismail_2011\"/>\n\nLNSs are sometimes used in [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]-based applications where most arithmetic operations are multiplication or division.<ref name=\"Fu_2006\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Denormal number]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]] (TFP)\n* [[Level-index arithmetic]] (LI) and [[symmetric level-index arithmetic]] (SLI)\n* [[Gaussian logarithm]]\n* [[Zech's logarithm]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Kingsbury_1971\">{{cite journal |author-first1=Nicholas<!-- Nick --> G. |author-last1=Kingsbury |author-first2=Peter J.

      "text": "In [[computational number theory]] and [[computer algebra|computational algebra]], '''Pollard's kangaroo algorithm''' (also '''Pollard's lambda algorithm''', see [[#Naming|Naming]] below) is an [[algorithm]] for solving the [[discrete logarithm]] problem.  The algorithm was introduced in 1978 by the number theorist [[John Pollard (mathematician)|J. M. Pollard]], in the same paper <ref>J. Pollard, ''Monte Carlo methods for index computation mod p'', Mathematics of Computation, Volume 32, 1978</ref> as his better-known [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|ρ algorithm]] for solving the same problem.  Although Pollard described the application of his algorithm to the discrete logarithm problem in the multiplicative group of units modulo a prime ''p'', it is in fact a generic discrete logarithm algorithm—it will work in any finite cyclic group.\n\n==The algorithm==\n\nSuppose <math>G</math> is a finite cyclic group of order <math>n</math> which is generated by the element <math>\\alpha</math>, and we seek to find the discrete logarithm <math>x</math> of the element <math>\\beta</math> to the base <math>\\alpha</math>.  In other words, we seek <math>x \\in Z_n</math> such that <math>\\alpha^x = \\beta</math>.  The lambda algorithm allows us to search for <math>x</math> in some subset <math>\\{a,\\ldots,b\\}\\subset Z_n</math>.  We may search the entire range of possible logarithms by setting <math>a=0</math> and <math>b=n-1</math>, although in this case [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms]] is more efficient.  We proceed as follows:\n\n1. Choose a set <math>S</math> of integers and define a [[pseudorandom]] map <math>f: G \\rightarrow S</math>.\n\n2. Choose an integer <math>N</math> and compute a sequence of group elements <math>\\{x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_N\\}</math> according to:\n* <math>x_0 = \\alpha^b\\,</math>\n* <math>x_{i+1} = x_i\\alpha^{f(x_i)}\\mbox{ for }i=0,1,\\ldots,N-1</math>\n3. Compute\n:<math>d = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}f(x_i)</math>.\nObserve that:\n:<math>x_N = x_0\\alpha^d = \\alpha^{b+d}\\, .</math>\n4. Begin computing a second sequence of group elements <math>\\{y_0,y_1,\\ldots\\}</math> according to:\n* <math>y_0 = \\beta\\,</math>\n* <math>y_{i+1} = y_i\\alpha^{f(y_i)}\\mbox{ for }i=0,1,\\ldots,N-1</math>\nand a corresponding sequence of integers <math>\\{d_0,d_1,\\ldots\\}</math> according to:\n:<math>d_n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(y_i)</math>.\nObserve that:\n:<math>y_i = y_0\\alpha^{d_i} = \\beta\\alpha^{d_i}\\mbox{ for }i=0,1,\\ldots,N-1</math>\n5. Stop computing terms of <math>\\{y_i\\}</math> and <math>\\{d_i\\}</math> when either of the following conditions are met:\n\n:A) <math>y_j = x_N</math> for some <math>j</math>.  If the sequences <math>\\{x_i\\}</math> and <math>\\{y_j\\}</math> \"collide\" in this manner, then we have:\n::<math>x_N = y_j \\Rightarrow \\alpha^{b+d} = \\beta\\alpha^{d_j} \\Rightarrow \\beta = \\alpha^{b+d-d_j} \\Rightarrow \nx \\equiv b+d-d_j \\pmod{n}</math>\n:and so we are done.\n\n:B) <math>d_i > b-a+d</math>.  If this occurs, then the algorithm has failed to find <math>x</math>.  Subsequent attempts can be made by changing the choice of <math>S</math> and/or <math>f</math>.\n\n==Complexity==\n\nPollard gives the time complexity of the algorithm as <math>{\\scriptstyle O(\\sqrt{b-a})}</math>, based on a probabilistic argument which follows from the assumption that ''f'' acts pseudorandomly.  Note that when the size of the set {''a'',&nbsp;…,&nbsp;''b''} to be searched is measured in [[Binary digit|bits]], as is normal in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], the set  has size log(''b''&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;''a''), and so the algorithm's complexity is <math>{\\scriptstyle O(\\sqrt{b-a}) = O(2^{\\frac{1}{2}\\log(b-a)})}</math>, which is exponential in the problem size.  For this reason, Pollard's lambda algorithm is considered an [[exponential time]] algorithm.  For an example of a [[subexponential time]] discrete logarithm algorithm, see the [[index calculus algorithm]].\n\n==Naming==\nThe algorithm is well known by two names.\n\nThe first is \"Pollard's kangaroo algorithm\".  This name is a reference to an analogy used in the paper presenting the algorithm, where the algorithm is explained in terms of using a ''tame'' [[kangaroo]] to trap a ''wild'' kangaroo.  Pollard has explained<ref>J. M. Pollard, ''Kangaroos, Monopoly and Discrete Logarithms'', Journal of Cryptology, Volume 13, pp 437-447, 2000</ref> that this analogy was inspired by a \"fascinating\" article published in the same issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'' as an exposition of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[public key cryptosystem]].  The article<ref>T. J. Dawson, ''Kangaroos'', Scientific American, August 1977, pp. 78-89</ref> described an experiment in which a kangaroo's \"energetic cost of locomotion, measured in terms of oxygen consumption at various speeds, was determined by placing kangaroos on a [[treadmill]]\".\n\nThe second is \"Pollard's lambda algorithm\".  Much like the name of another of Pollard's discrete logarithm algorithms, [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard's rho algorithm]], this name refers to the similarity between a visualisation of the algorithm and the [[Greek letter]] [[lambda]] (<math>\\lambda</math>).  The shorter stroke of the letter lambda corresponds to the sequence <math>\\{x_i\\}</math>, since it starts from the position b to the right of x.  Accordingly, the longer stroke corresponds to the sequence <math>\\{y_i\\}</math>, which \"collides with\" the first sequence (just like the strokes of a lambda intersect) and then follows it subsequently.\n\nPollard has expressed a preference for the name \"kangaroo algorithm\",<ref>http://sites.google.com/site/jmptidcott2/</ref> as this avoids confusion with some parallel versions of his rho algorithm, which have also been called \"lambda algorithms\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow table]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Number-theoretic algorithms}}\n\n[[Category:Number theoretic algorithms]]\n[[Category:Computer algebra]]\n[[Category:Logarithms]]"

      "text": "In [[number theory]], the '''prime number theorem''' ('''PNT''') describes the [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] distribution of the [[prime number]]s among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.  The theorem was proved independently by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin]] in 1896 using ideas introduced by [[Bernhard Riemann]] (in particular, the [[Riemann zeta function]]).\n\nThe first such distribution found is {{math|''π''(''N'') ~ {{sfrac|''N''|log(''N'')}}}}, where {{math|''π''(''N'')}} is the [[prime-counting function]] and {{math|log(''N'')}} is the [[natural logarithm]] of {{mvar|N}}. This means that for large enough {{mvar|N}}, the [[probability]] that a random integer not greater than {{mvar|N}} is prime is very close to {{math|1 / log(''N'')}}. Consequently, a random integer with at most {{math|2''n''}} digits (for large enough {{mvar|n}}) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most {{mvar|n}} digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime ({{math|log(10<sup>1000</sup>) ≈ 2302.6}}), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime ({{math|log(10<sup>2000</sup>) ≈ 4605.2}}).

For example, {{math|''π''(10) {{=}} 4}} because there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that {{math|''x'' / log ''x''}} is a good approximation to {{math|''π''(''x'')}}, in the sense that the [[limit of a function|limit]] of the ''quotient'' of the two functions {{math|''π''(''x'')}} and {{math|''x'' / log ''x''}} as {{mvar|x}} increases without bound is 1:\n\n: <math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\;\\pi(x)\\;}{\\;\\left[ \\frac{x}{\\log(x)}\\right]\\;} = 1,</math>\n\nknown as '''the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers'''.

Instead, the theorem states that {{math|''x'' / log ''x''}} approximates {{math|''π''(''x'')}} in the sense that the [[relative error]] of this approximation approaches 0 as {{mvar|x}} increases without bound.\n\nThe prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the {{mvar|n}}th prime number {{mvar|p<sub>n</sub>}} satisfies\n\n:<math>p_n \\sim n\\log(n),</math>\n\nthe asymptotic notation meaning, again, that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as {{mvar|n}} increases without bound.

In the second edition of his book on number theory (1808) he then made a [[Legendre's constant|more precise conjecture]], with {{math|''A'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''B'' {{=}} −1.08366}}. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] considered the same question at age 15 or 16 \"in the year 1792 or 1793\", according to his own recollection in 1849.<ref>C. F. Gauss. ''Werke'', Bd 2, 1st ed, 444–447. Göttingen 1863.</ref> In 1838 [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] came up with his own approximating function, the [[logarithmic integral]] {{math|li(''x'')}} (under the slightly different form of a series, which he communicated to Gauss). Both Legendre's and Dirichlet's formulas imply the same conjectured asymptotic equivalence of {{math|''π''(''x'')}} and {{math|''x'' / log(''x'')}} stated above, although it turned out that Dirichlet's approximation is considerably better if one considers the differences instead of quotients.\n\nIn two papers from 1848 and 1850, the Russian mathematician [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]] attempted to prove the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. His work is notable for the use of the zeta function {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}}, for real values of the argument \"{{mvar|s}}\", as in works of [[Leonhard Euler]], as early as 1737. Chebyshev's papers predated Riemann's celebrated memoir of 1859, and he succeeded in proving a slightly weaker form of the asymptotic law, namely, that if the limit of {{math|''π''(''x'') / (''x'' / log(''x''))}} as {{mvar|x}} goes to infinity exists at all, then it is necessarily equal to one.<ref>{{cite journal |first=N. |last=Costa Pereira |jstor=2322510 |title=A Short Proof of Chebyshev's Theorem |journal=American Mathematical Monthly|date=August–September 1985|pages=494–495|volume=92|doi=10.2307/2322510|issue=7}}</ref> He was able to prove unconditionally that this ratio is bounded above and below by two explicitly given constants near 1, for all sufficiently large {{mvar|x}}.<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Nair |jstor=2320934 |title=On Chebyshev-Type Inequalities for Primes |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=February 1982 |pages=126–129 |volume=89 |doi=10.2307/2320934 |issue=2}}</ref> Although Chebyshev's paper did not prove the Prime Number Theorem, his estimates for {{math|''π''(''x'')}} were strong enough for him to prove [[Bertrand's postulate]] that there exists a prime number between {{math|''n''}} and {{math|2''n''}} for any integer {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}.\n\nAn important paper concerning the distribution of prime numbers was Riemann's 1859 memoir \"[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]\", the only paper he ever wrote on the subject. Riemann introduced new ideas into the subject, the chief of them being that the distribution of prime numbers is intimately connected with the zeros of the analytically extended Riemann zeta function of a complex variable. In particular, it is in this paper of Riemann that the idea to apply methods of [[complex analysis]] to the study of the real function {{math|''π''(''x'')}} originates. Extending the ideas of Riemann, two proofs of the asymptotic law of the distribution of prime numbers were obtained independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin and appeared in the same year (1896). Both proofs used methods from complex analysis, establishing as a main step of the proof that the Riemann zeta function {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is non-zero for all complex values of the variable {{mvar|s}} that have the form {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1 + ''it''}} with {{math|''t'' > 0}}.<ref>{{cite book |last = Ingham |first = A.

Several different proofs of it were found, including the \"elementary\" proofs of [[Atle Selberg]] and [[Paul Erdős]] (1949). While the original proofs of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin are long and elaborate, later proofs introduced various simplifications through the use of [[Tauberian theorems]] but remained difficult to digest. A short proof was discovered in 1980 by American mathematician [[Donald J. Newman]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Simple analytic proof of the prime number theorem|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=87 |year=1980 |pages=693–696 |first=Donald J. | last=Newman |doi=10.2307/2321853 |jstor=2321853 |issue=9 | mr=0602825}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Newman's short proof of the prime number theorem |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=104 |year=1997 |pages=705–708 |first=Don |last=Zagier |url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/newmans-short-proof-of-the-prime-number-theorem |doi=10.2307/2975232 |jstor=2975232 |issue=8 | mr=1476753}}</ref> Newman's proof is arguably the simplest known proof of the theorem, although it is non-elementary in the sense that it uses [[Cauchy's integral theorem]] from complex analysis.\n\n==Proof sketch==\nHere is a sketch of the proof referred to in one of [[Terence Tao]]'s lectures<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tao |first1=Terence |authorlink = Terence Tao|title=254A, Notes 2: Complex-analytic multiplicative number theory |url=https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/12/09/254a-notes-2-complex-analytic-multiplicative-number-theory/ |website=Terence Tao's blog}}</ref>. Like most proofs of the PNT, it starts out by reformulating the problem in terms of a less intuitive, but better-behaved, prime-counting function. The idea is to count the primes (or a related set such as the set of prime powers) with ''weights'' to arrive at a function with smoother asymptotic behavior. The most common such generalized counting function is the [[Chebyshev function]] {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}}, defined by\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) =\\!\\!\\!\\! \\sum_\\stackrel{p^k \\le x,}{p \\text{ is prime}} \\!\\!\\!\\!\\log p.</math>\n\nThis is sometimes written as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x)=\\sum_{n\\le x} \\Lambda(n),</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''Λ''(''n'')}} is the [[von Mangoldt function]], namely\n\n:<math>\\Lambda(n) = \\begin{cases} \\log p & \\text{if }n=p^k \\text{ for some prime } p \\text{ and integer } k \\ge 1, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIt is now relatively easy to check that the PNT is equivalent to the claim that\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\psi(x)}{x}=1.</math>\nIndeed, this follows from the easy estimates\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\sum_{p\\le x} \\log p \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\log x}{\\log p} \\right\\rfloor \\le \\sum_{p\\le x} \\log x = \\pi(x)\\log x</math>\nand (using [[big O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]) for any {{math|''ε'' > 0}},\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\ge \\!\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{x^{1-\\varepsilon}\\le p\\le x}\\!\\!\\!\\! \\log p\\ge\\!\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{x^{1-\\varepsilon}\\le p\\le x}\\!\\!\\!\\!(1-\\varepsilon)\\log x=(1-\\varepsilon)\\left(\\pi(x)+O\\left(x^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right)\\log x.</math>\n\nThe next step is to find a useful representation for {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}}. Let {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} be the Riemann zeta function. It can be shown that {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is related to the von Mangoldt function {{math|''Λ''(''n'')}}, and hence to {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}}, via the relation\n\n:<math>-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)} = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\Lambda(n) n^{-s}. </math>\n\nA delicate analysis of this equation and related properties of the zeta function, using the [[Mellin transform]] and [[Perron's formula]], shows that for non-integer {{mvar|x}} the equation\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = x - \\sum_\\rho \\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} - \\log(2\\pi)</math>\n\nholds, where the sum is over all zeros (trivial and nontrivial) of the zeta function. This striking formula is one of the so-called [[Explicit formulae (L-function)|explicit formulas of number theory]], and is already suggestive of the result we wish to prove, since the term {{mvar|x}} (claimed to be the correct asymptotic order of {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}}) appears on the right-hand side, followed by (presumably) lower-order asymptotic terms.\n\nThe next step in the proof involves a study of the zeros of the zeta function. The trivial zeros −2, −4, −6, −8, ... can be handled separately:\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2n\\,x^{2n}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\log\\left(1-\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right),</math>\nwhich vanishes for a large {{mvar|x}}. The nontrivial zeros, namely those on the critical strip {{math|0 ≤ Re(''s'') ≤ 1}}, can potentially be of an asymptotic order comparable to the main term {{mvar|x}} if {{math|Re(''ρ'') {{=}} 1}}, so we need to show that all zeros have real part strictly less than 1.\n\nTo do this, we take for granted that {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is meromorphic in the half-plane {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}, and is analytic there except for a simple pole at {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, and that there is a product formula\n:<math>\\zeta(s)=\\prod_p\\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} </math>\nfor {{math|Re(''s'') > 1}}. This product formula follows from the existence of unique prime factorization of integers, and shows that {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is never zero in this region, so that its logarithm is defined there and\n:<math>\\log\\zeta(s)=-\\sum_p\\log \\left(1-p^{-s} \\right)=\\sum_{p,n}\\frac{p^{-ns}}{n}.</math>\n\nWrite {{math|''s'' {{=}} ''x'' + ''iy''}}; then\n\n:<math>\\big|\\zeta(x+iy)\\big|=\\exp\\left(\\sum_{n,p}\\frac{\\cos ny\\log p}{np^{nx}}\\right).</math>\n\nNow observe the identity\n:<math>3+4\\cos\\phi+\\cos2\\phi=2(1+\\cos\\phi)^2\\ge 0,</math>\nso that\n\n:<math>\\left|\\zeta(x)^3\\zeta(x+iy)^4\\zeta(x+2iy)\\right|=\\exp\\left(\\sum_{n,p}\\frac{3+4\\cos(ny\\log p) +\\cos (2ny\\log p)}{np^{nx}}\\right)\\ge 1</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''x'' > 1}}. Suppose now that {{math|''ζ''(1 + ''iy'') {{=}} 0}}. Certainly {{mvar|y}} is not zero, since {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} has a simple pole at {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}}. Suppose that {{math|''x'' > 1}} and let {{mvar|x}} tend to 1 from above. Since <math>\\zeta(s)</math> has a simple pole at {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''ζ''(''x'' + 2''iy'')}} stays analytic, the left hand side in the previous inequality tends to 0, a contradiction.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that the PNT is heuristically true. To rigorously complete the proof there are still serious technicalities to overcome, due to the fact that the summation over zeta zeros in the explicit formula for {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} does not converge absolutely but only conditionally and in a \"principal value\" sense. There are several ways around this problem but many of them require rather delicate complex-analytic estimates that are beyond the scope of this paper. Edwards's book<ref>{{cite book|last = Edwards|first = Harold M.|authorlink = Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title = Riemann's zeta function |publisher = Courier Dover Publications|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-486-41740-0}}</ref> provides the details. Another method is to use [[Ikehara's Tauberian theorem]], though this theorem is itself quite hard to prove. D. J. Newman observed that the full strength of Ikehara's theorem is not needed for the prime number theorem, and one can get away with a special case that is much easier to prove.\n\n==Prime-counting function in terms of the logarithmic integral==\nIn a handwritten note on a reprint of his 1838 paper \"{{lang|fr|Sur l'usage des séries infinies dans la théorie des nombres}}\", which he mailed to Gauss, Dirichlet conjectured (under a slightly different form appealing to a series rather than an integral) that an even better approximation to {{math|''π''(''x'')}} is given by the [[logarithmic integral function|offset logarithmic integral]] function {{math|Li(''x'')}}, defined by\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Li}(x) = \\int_2^x \\frac{dt}{\\log t} = \\operatorname{li}(x) - \\operatorname{li}(2). </math>\n\nIndeed, this integral is strongly suggestive of the notion that the \"density\" of primes around {{mvar|t}} should be {{math|1 / log ''t''}}. This function is related to the logarithm by the [[asymptotic expansion]]\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Li}(x) \\sim \\frac{x}{\\log x} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{k!}{(\\log x)^k} = \\frac{x}{\\log x} + \\frac{x}{(\\log x)^2} + \\frac{2x}{(\\log x)^3} + \\cdots </math>\n\nSo, the prime number theorem can also be written as {{math|''π''(''x'') ~ Li(''x'')}}. In fact, in another paper in 1899 de la Vallée Poussin proved that\n\n:<math> \\pi(x) = \\operatorname{Li} (x) + O \\left(x e^{-a\\sqrt{\\log x}}\\right) \\quad\\text{as } x \\to \\infty</math>\n\nfor some positive constant {{mvar|a}}, where {{math|''O''(...)}} is the [[big O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]. This has been improved to\n\n:<math>\\pi(x) = \\operatorname{li} (x) + O \\left(x \\exp \\left( -\\frac{A(\\log x)^\\frac35}{(\\log \\log x)^\\frac15} \\right) \\right)</math> where <math>A = 0.2098</math>.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite journal |author = Kevin Ford |author-link = Kevin Ford (mathematician) |title=Vinogradov's Integral and Bounds for the Riemann Zeta Function |journal=Proc.

There is no rigorous and widely accepted definition of the notion of [[elementary proof]] in number theory, so it is not clear exactly in what sense their proof is \"elementary\". Although it does not use complex analysis, it is in fact much more technical than the standard proof of PNT. One possible definition of an \"elementary\" proof is \"one that can be carried out in first order [[Peano arithmetic]].\" There are number-theoretic statements (for example, the [[Paris–Harrington theorem]]) provable using [[second order arithmetic|second order]] but not [[first order arithmetic|first order]] methods, but such theorems are rare to date. Erdős and Selberg's proof can certainly be formalized in Peano arithmetic, and in 1994, Charalambos Cornaros and Costas Dimitracopoulos proved that their proof can be formalized in a very weak fragment of PA, namely {{math|''I''Δ<sub>0</sub> + exp}},<ref>.{{cite journal|last1=Cornaros|first1=Charalambos|last2=Dimitracopoulos|first2=Costas|title=The prime number theorem and fragments of ''PA''|year=1994|url=http://mpla.math.uoa.gr/~cdimitr/files/publications/AML_33.pdf|journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic|volume=33|issue=4|pages=265–281|doi=10.1007/BF01270626|mr=1294272|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721083756/http://mpla.math.uoa.gr/~cdimitr/files/publications/AML_33.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}</ref> However, this does not address the question of whether or not the standard proof of PNT can be formalized in PA.\n\n==Computer verifications==\nIn 2005, Avigad ''et al.'' employed the [[Isabelle theorem prover]] to devise a computer-verified variant of the Erdős–Selberg proof of the PNT.<ref name=Avigad>{{cite journal|first1=Jeremy | last1=Avigad |first2=Kevin |last2=Donnelly |first3=David | last3=Gray |first4=Paul | last4=Raff | title=A formally verified proof of the prime number theorem|year=2008 | mr=2371488 | journal=[[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]] | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=2 | doi=10.1145/1297658.1297660 | arxiv=cs/0509025}}</ref> This was the first machine-verified proof of the PNT.

That is, we are looking at polynomials with coefficients chosen from {{mvar|F}}, which cannot be written as products of polynomials of smaller degree. In this setting, these polynomials play the role of the prime numbers, since all other monic polynomials are built up of products of them. One can then prove that\n:<math>N_n \\sim \\frac{q^n}{n}.</math>\nIf we make the substitution {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, then the right hand side is just\n:<math>\\frac{x}{\\log_q x},</math>\nwhich makes the analogy clearer. Since there are precisely {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}} monic polynomials of degree {{mvar|n}} (including the reducible ones), this can be rephrased as follows: if a monic polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} is selected randomly, then the probability of it being irreducible is about&nbsp;{{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''}}}}.\n\nOne can even prove an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, namely that\n:<math>N_n = \\frac{q^n}n + O\\left(\\frac{q^\\frac{n}{2}}{n}\\right).</math>\n\nThe proofs of these statements are far simpler than in the classical case.

      "title": "Log probability",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability",
      "text": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2011}}\nIn [[probability theory]] and [[computer science]], a '''log probability''' is simply a [[logarithm]] of a [[probability]]. The use of log probabilities means representing probabilities on a [[logarithmic scale]], instead of the standard <math>[0, 1]</math> [[unit interval]].\n\nSince the probability of [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[event (probability theory)|events]] multiply, and logarithms convert multiplication to addition, log probabilities of independent events add. Log probabilities are thus practical for computations, and have an intuitive interpretation in terms of [[information theory]]: the negative of the log probability is the [[information content]] of an event. Similarly, [[likelihood]]s are often transformed to the log scale, and the corresponding [[log-likelihood]] can be interpreted as the degree to which an event supports a [[statistical model]]. The log probability is widely used in implementations of computations with probability, and is studied as a concept in its own right in some applications of information theory, such as [[natural language processing]].\n\n==Motivation==\nRepresenting probabilities in this way has several practical advantages:\n\n# '''Speed.''' Since multiplication is more [[time complexity|expensive]] than addition, taking the product of a high number of probabilities is often faster if they are represented in log form. (The conversion to log form is expensive, but is only incurred once.)  Multiplication arises from calculating the probability that multiple independent events occur: the probability that all independent events of interest occur is the product of all these events' probabilities.\n# '''Accuracy.''' The use of log probabilities improves [[numerical stability]], when the probabilities are very small, because of the way in which computers [[Floating point|approximate real numbers]].\n# '''Simplicity.''' Many probability distributions have an exponential form. Taking the log of these distributions eliminates the exponential function, unwrapping the exponent. For example, the log probability of the normal distribution's PDF is <math>-(x-m_x/\\sigma_m)^2+C</math> instead of <math>C_2 \\exp(-(x-m_x/\\sigma_m)^2)</math>. Log probabilities make some mathematical manipulations easier to perform.\n\n== Representation issues ==\nThe logarithm function is not defined for zero, so log probabilities can only represent non-zero probabilities. Since the logarithm of a number in <math>(0, 1)</math> interval is negative, often the negative log probabilities are used. In that case the log probabilities in the following formulas would be [[Additive inverse|inverted]]. \n\nAny base can be selected for the logarithm.\n\n: <math>x' = \\log(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>\n: <math>y' = \\log(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>\n\n== Basic manipulations ==\n{{see|Log semiring}}\nThe product of probabilities <math>x \\cdot y</math> corresponds to addition in logarithmic space.\n\n: <math>\\log(x \\cdot y) = \\log(x) + \\log(y) = x' + y'</math>.\n\nThe [[#Addition in log space|sum of probabilities]] <math>x + y</math> is a bit more involved to compute in logarithmic space, requiring the computation of one exponent and one logarithm.\n\nHowever, in many applications a multiplication of probabilities (giving the probability of all independent events occurring) is used more often than their addition (giving the probability of at least one of them occurring). Additionally, the cost of computing the addition can be avoided in some situations by simply using the highest probability as an approximation. Since probabilities are non-negative this gives a lower bound. This approximation is used in reverse to get a [[LogSumExp|continuous approximation of the max function]].\n\n===Addition in log space===\n\n: <math>\\log(x + y)</math>\n: <math>= \\log(x + x \\cdot y / x)</math>\n: <math>= \\log(x + x \\cdot \\exp(\\log(y / x)))</math>\n: <math>= \\log(x \\cdot (1 + \\exp(\\log(y) - \\log(x))))</math>\n: <math>= \\log(x) + \\log(1 + \\exp(\\log(y) - \\log(x)))</math>\n: <math>= x' + \\log(1 + \\exp(y' - x'))</math>\n\nThe formula above is more accurate than <math> \\log(e^{x'} + e^{y'})</math>, provided one takes advantage of the asymmetry in the addition formula. <math> {x'} </math> should be the larger (least negative) of the two operands. This also produces the correct behavior if one of the operands is floating-point negative infinity, which corresponds to a probability of zero.\n\n: <math>-\\infty + \\log(1 + \\exp(y' - (-\\infty))) = -\\infty + \\infty </math> This quantity is [[Indeterminate form|indeterminate]], and will result in [[NaN]].\n: <math> x' + \\log(1 + \\exp(-\\infty - x')) = x' + 0</math> This is the desired answer.\n\nNote that the above formula alone will incorrectly produce an indeterminate result in the case where both arguments are <math> -\\infty </math>. This should be checked for separately to return <math> -\\infty </math>.\n\nNote also that for numerical reasons, one should use a function that computes <math> \\log(1+x) </math> ([[Natural logarithm#lnp1|log1p]]) directly.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Information content]]\n* [[Log-likelihood]]\n\n[[Category:Logarithms|Probability]]\n[[Category:Mathematics of computing]]"

After reading philosophy in Douai, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] 21 October 1605. His talent was recognized by [[Christopher Clavius]] in Rome. Gregoire was sent to Louvain in 1612, and was ordained a priest 23 March 1613. Gregoire began teaching in association with [[François d'Aguilon]] in [[Antwerp]] from 1617 to 20. Moving to [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]] in 1621, he taught mathematics there until 1625. That year he became obsessed with [[squaring the circle]] and requested permission from [[Mutio Vitelleschi]] to publish his method. But Vitelleschi deferred to [[Christoph Grienberger]], the mathematician in Rome.\n\nOn September 9, 1625, Gregoire set out for Rome to confer with Grienberger, but without avail. He returned to the Netherlands in 1627, and the following year was sent to [[Prague]] to serve in the house of [[Emperor Ferdinand II]].

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_semiring",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[tropical analysis]], the '''log semiring''' is the [[semiring]] structure on the [[logarithmic scale]], obtained by considering the [[extended real numbers]] as [[logarithm]]s. That is, the operations of addition and multiplication are defined by [[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]: [[exponentiate]] the real numbers, obtaining a positive (or zero) number, add or multiply these numbers with the ordinary \"linear\" operations on real numbers, and then take the [[logarithm]] to reverse the initial exponentiation. As usual in tropical analysis, the operations are denoted by ⊕ and ⊗ to distinguish them from the usual addition + and multiplication × (or ⋅). These operations depend on the choice of base {{mvar|''b''}} for the exponent and logarithm ({{math|''b''}} is a choice of [[logarithmic unit]]), which corresponds to a scale factor, and are well-defined for any positive base other than 1; using a base {{math|''b'' < 1}} is equivalent to using a negative sign and using the inverse {{math|1/''b'' > 1}}.{{efn|Since <math>b^{-x} = \\left(b^{-1}\\right)^x=(1/b)^x</math>}} If not qualified, the base is conventionally taken to be {{mvar|''e''}} or {{math|1/''e''}}, which corresponds to {{mvar|''e''}} with a negative.\n\nThe log semiring has the [[tropical semiring]] as limit (\"[[tropicalization]]\", \"dequantization\") as the base goes to infinity {{tmath|b \\to \\infty}} ([[max-plus semiring]]) or to zero {{tmath|b \\to 0}} ([[min-plus semiring]]), and thus can be viewed as a [[deformation theory|deformation]] (\"quantization\") of the tropical semiring. Notably, the addition operation, ''logadd'' (for multiple terms, [[LogSumExp]]) can be viewed as a deformation of [[maximum]] or [[minimum]]. The log semiring has applications in [[mathematical optimization]], since it replaces the non-smooth maximum and minimum by a smooth operation. The log semiring also arises when working with numbers that are logarithms (measured on a [[logarithmic scale]]), such as [[decibel]]s (see {{slink|Decibel|Addition}}), [[log probability]], or [[log-likelihood]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe operations on the log semiring can be defined extrinsically by mapping them to the non-negative real numbers, doing the operations there, and mapping them back. The non-negative real numbers with the usual operations of addition and multiplication form a [[semiring]] (there are no negatives), known as the [[probability semiring]], so the log semiring operations can be viewed as [[pullback]]s of the operations on the probability semiring, and these are [[isomorphic]] as rings.\n\nFormally, given the extended real numbers {{math|'''R''' ∪ {–∞, +∞}}}{{efn|Note that usually only one infinity is included, not both, since <math>\\infty \\otimes -\\infty = \\infty + (-\\infty)</math> is ambiguous, and is best left undefined, as is 0/0 in real numbers.}} and a base {{math|''b'' ≠ 1}}, one defines:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx \\oplus_b y  &= \\log_b\\left(b^x + b^y\\right) \\\\\nx \\otimes_b y &= \\log_b\\left(b^x \\times b^y\\right) = \\log_b\\left(b^{x+y}\\right) = x + y.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nNote that regardless of base, log multiplication is the same as usual addition, <math>x \\otimes_b y = x + y</math>, since logarithms take multiplication to addition; however, log addition depends on base. The units for usual addition and multiplication are 0 and 1; accordingly, the unit for log addition is <math>\\log_b 0 = -\\infty</math> for <math>b > 1</math> and <math>\\log_b 0 = -\\log_{1/b} 0 = +\\infty</math> for <math>b < 1</math>, and the unit for log multiplication is <math>\\log 1 = 0</math>, regardless of base.\n\nMore concisely, the unit log semiring can be defined for base {{mvar|''e''}} as:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx \\oplus y  &= \\log\\left(e^x + e^y\\right) \\\\\nx \\otimes y &= x + y.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwith additive unit {{math|−∞}} and multiplicative unit 0; this corresponds to the max convention.\n\nThe opposite convention is also common, and corresponds to the base {{math|1/''e''}}, the minimum convention:{{sfn|Lothaire|2005|p=211}}\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx \\oplus y  &= -\\log\\left(e^{-x} + e^{-y}\\right) \\\\\nx \\otimes_b y &= x + y.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwith additive unit {{math|+∞}} and multiplicative unit 0.\n\n== Properties ==\nA log semiring is in fact a [[semifield]], since all numbers other than the additive unit {{math|−∞}} (or {{math|+∞}}) has a multiplicative inverse, given by <math>-x,</math> since <math>x \\otimes -x = \\log_b(b^x \\cdot b^{-x}) = \\log_b (1) = 0.</math> Thus log division ⊘ is well-defined, though log subtraction ⊖ is not always defined.\n\nA [[logarithmic mean]] can be defined by log addition and log division (as the [[quasi-arithmetic mean]] corresponding to the logarithm), as\n:<math>M_\\mathrm{lm}(x, y) := (x \\oplus y) \\oslash 2 = \\log_b\\bigl((b^x + b^y)/2\\bigr) = \\log_b (b^x + b^y) - \\log_b 2 = (x \\oplus y) - \\log_b 2.</math>\nNote that this is just addition shifted by <math>- \\log_b 2,</math> since logarithmic division corresponds to linear subtraction.\n\nA log semiring has the usual Euclidean metric, which corresponds to the [[logarithmic scale]] on the [[positive real numbers]].\n\nSimilarly, a log semiring has the usual [[Lebesgue measure]], which is an [[invariant measure]] with respect to log multiplication (usual addition, geometrically translation) with corresponds to the [[logarithmic measure]] on the [[probability semiring]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Logarithmic mean]]\n* [[LogSumExp]]\n* [[Softmax function|Softmax]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | last=Lothaire | first=M. | authorlink=M.

Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines.\n\nSlide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in calculations peculiar to those fields.\n\nAt its simplest, each number to be multiplied is represented by a length on a sliding ruler. As the rulers each have a logarithmic scale, it is possible to align them to read the sum of the logarithms, and hence calculate the product of the two numbers.\n\nThe Reverend [[William Oughtred]] and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on [[logarithms]] by [[John Napier]].

These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More elaborate slide rules allow other calculations, such as [[square root]]s, [[exponential function|exponentials]], logarithms, and [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\nScales may be grouped in decades, which are numbers ranging from 1 to 10 (i.e. 10<sup>n</sup> to 10<sup>n+1</sup>). Thus single decade scales C and D range from 1 to 10 across the entire width of the slide rule while double decade scales A and B range from 1 to 100 over the width of the slide rule.\n\nIn general, mathematical calculations are performed by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with a mark on one of the fixed strips, and then observing the relative positions of other marks on the strips. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the [[product (mathematics)|product]], [[quotient]], or other calculated result.\n\nThe user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. [[Scientific notation]] is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.\n\nMost slide rules consist of three linear strips of the same length, aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.\n\nSome slide rules (\"duplex\" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only (\"simplex\" rules). A sliding [[Wikt:cursor|cursor]] with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:pocket slide rule.jpg|frame|center|This slide rule is positioned to yield several values: From C scale to D scale (multiply by 2), from D scale to C scale (divide by 2), A and B scales (multiply and divide by 4), A and D scales (squares and square roots).]]\n\n===Multiplication===\nA logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules <math>\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)</math> and <math>\\log(x/y) = \\log(x) - \\log(y)</math>.\nMoving the top scale to the right by a distance of <math>\\log(x)</math>, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label <math>x</math> on the bottom, aligns each number <math>y</math>, at position <math>\\log(y)</math> on the top scale, with the number at position <math>\\log(x) + \\log(y)</math> on the bottom scale. Because <math>\\log(x) + \\log(y) = \\log(xy)</math>, this position on the bottom scale gives <math>xy</math>, the product of <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. For example, to calculate 3×2, the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top. This works because the distances from the \"1\" are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values:\n\n[[File:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|550px]]\nOperations may go \"off the scale;\" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2×7. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively dividing by 10 (by subtracting the full length of the C-scale) and then multiplying by 7, as in the illustration below:\n\n[[File:slide rule example3.svg]]\nHere the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2×7, but instead we calculated (2/10)×7=0.2×7=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2×7; some other methods are:\n# Use the double-decade scales A and B.\n# Use the folded scales. In this example, set the left 1 of C opposite the 2 of D. Move the cursor to 7 on CF, and read the result from DF.\n# Use the CI inverted scale. Position the 7 on the CI scale above the 2 on the D scale, and then read the result off of the D scale below the 1 on the CI scale. Since 1 occurs in two places on the CI scale, one of them will always be on-scale.\n# Use both the CI inverted scale and the C scale. Line up the 2 of CI with the 1 of D, and read the result from D, below the 7 on the C scale.\n# Using a circular slide rule.\n\nMethod 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.\n\n===Division===\nThe illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.\n\n[[File:slide rule example4.svg]]\n\n===Other operations===\nIn addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]]s encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular are [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]], usually [[sine]] and [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]], [[common logarithm]] (log{{small|10}}) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), [[natural logarithm]] (ln) and [[exponential function|exponential]] (''e<sup>x</sup>'') scales. Some rules include a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating [[hyperbolic functions]]. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| A, B || two-decade logarithmic scales, used for finding square roots and squares of numbers\n|-\n| C, D || single-decade logarithmic scales\n|-\n| K || three-decade logarithmic scale, used for finding cube roots and cubes of numbers\n|-\n| CF, DF || \"folded\" versions of the C and D scales that start from [[Pi|π]] rather than from unity; these are convenient in two cases. First when the user guesses a product will be close to 10 but is not sure whether it will be slightly less or slightly more than 10, the folded scales avoid the possibility of going off the scale. Second, by making the start π rather than the square root of 10, multiplying or dividing by π (as is common in science and engineering formulas) is simplified.\n|-\n| CI, DI, CIF, DIF || \"inverted\" scales, running from right to left, used to simplify 1/''x'' steps\n|-\n| S || used for finding sines and cosines on the C (or D) scale\n|-\n| T, T1, T2 || used for finding tangents and cotangents on the C and CI (or D and DI) scales\n|-\n| ST, SRT || used for sines and tangents of small angles and degree–radian conversion\n|-\n| L || a linear scale, used along with the C and D scales for finding base-10 logarithms and powers of 10\n|-\n| LLn || a set of log-log scales, used for finding logarithms and exponentials of numbers\n|-\n| Ln || a linear scale, used along with the C and D scales for finding natural (base e) logarithms and <math>e^x</math>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:150px; font-size:90%; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:4px; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"border-collapse: collapse;border-spacing:0;padding:2px;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Slide rule scales front.jpg|300px]]\n| [[File:Slide rule scales back.jpg|300px]]\n|}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | The scales on the front and back of a [[Keuffel and Esser]] (K&E) 4081-3 slide rule\n|}\n\nThe Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/circular-man2.html|title=instruction manual |pages= 7–8|accessdate=March 14, 2007|work=sphere.bc.ca}}</ref>\n\n====Roots and powers====\nThere are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute <math>x^2</math>, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.\n\nFor <math>x^y</math> problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with ''x'' on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find ''y'' on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with ''x'' on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If ''y'' is \"off the scale,\" locate <math>x^{y/2}</math> and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use the rightmost 1 on the C scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning the rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, 3 on the C scale lines up with 8 on the LL3 scale.\n\nTo extract a cube root using a slide rule with only C/D and A/B scales, align 1 on the B cursor with the base number on the A scale (taking care as always to distinguish between the lower and upper halves of the A scale). Slide the slide until the number on the D scale which is against 1 on the C cursor is the same as the number on the B cursor which is against the base number on the A scale. (Examples: A 8, B 2, C 1, D 2; A 27, B 3, C 1, D 3.)\n\n====Trigonometry====\nThe S, T, and ST scales are used for trig functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees.\n\nFor angles from around 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by comparing the S scale with C (or D) scale; though on many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A scale instead, and what follows must be adjusted appropriately. The S scale has a second set of angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as <math>k\\sin x</math> can be read directly from ''x'' on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C-scale index is set at&nbsp;''k''. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/[[radian]]. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.\n\nMany slide rules have S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes (e.g. some Keuffel and Esser models, late-model Teledyne-Post Mannheim-type rules). So-called ''decitrig'' models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.\n\n====Logarithms and exponentials====\nBase-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e. Logarithms to any other base can be calculated by reversing the procedure for calculating powers of a number. For example, log2 values can be determined by lining up either leftmost or rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, finding the number whose logarithm is to be calculated on the corresponding LL scale, and reading the log2 value on the C scale.\n\n====Addition and subtraction====\nSlide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquark.com/2005/01/slide-rule-tricks.html|title=AntiQuark: Slide Rule Tricks|work=antiquark.com}}</ref>\n\nThe first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:\n:<math>x + y = \\left(\\frac{x}{y} + 1\\right) y.</math>\n\nFor subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:\n:<math>x - y = \\left(\\frac{x}{y} - 1\\right) y.</math>\n\nThis method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the [[logarithmic number system]] in specialized computer applications like the [[Gravity Pipe]] (GRAPE) supercomputer and [[hidden Markov models]].\n\nThe second method utilizes a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.\n\n===Generalizations===\n[[File:Cikk-skalak-r-en.gif|thumb|alt=|Quadratic and reciprocal scales]]\nUsing (almost) any strictly [[Monotonic function|monotonic scales]], other calculations can also be made with one movement.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Istvan |first=Szalkai |title=General Two-Variable Functions on the Slide Rule |url=http://www.oughtred.org/jos/pages/JOS_2018_Vol_27_1_TOC.jpg |journal=Journal of the Oughtred Society|volume=27|issue=1|pages=14–18|bibcode=2016arXiv161203955S|year=2016|arxiv=1612.03955}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv |last=Istvan |first=Szalkai |title=General Two-variable Functions on the Slide-rule |eprint=1612.03955 |class=math.HO|year=2016}}</ref> For example, reciprocal scales can be used for the equality <math>\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}=\\frac{1}{z}</math>(calculating [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel_circuits|parallel resistances]], [[harmonic mean]], etc.), and quadratic scales can be used to solve <math>x^2 + y^2 = z^2 </math>.\n\n==Physical design==\n===Standard linear rules===\n[[File:Teaching sliderule comparison.jpg|thumb|A {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} teaching slide rule compared to a normal sized model]]\nThe width of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal width of the scales. Scales on the most common \"10-inch\" models are actually 25&nbsp;cm, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflows. Pocket rules are typically 5&nbsp;inches. Models a couple of metres wide were made to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbullock.com/sliderule.html |title=Slide Rules |publisher=Tbullock.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref>\n\nTypically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two [[significant figures]], and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch model.\n\nVarious other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called \"Darmstadt\" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often \"split\" to get higher accuracy.{{elucidate|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Circular slide rules===\nCircular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors, and another with a free dish and one cursor. The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by holding a fast angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The onefold cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.\n\nThe basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by [[pi|π]]). For example, a 10&nbsp;cm circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a 31.4&nbsp;cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate \"off-scale\" calculations, because the scales were designed to \"wrap around\"; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale width is narrowed to make room for end margins.<ref>At least one circular rule, a 1931 Gilson model, sacrificed some of the scales usually found in slide rules in order to obtain additional resolution in multiplication and division. It functioned through the use of a spiral C scale, which was claimed to be 50 feet and readable to five significant figures. See http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/gilson/gilson-manual2.jpg. A photo can be seen at http://www.hpmuseum.org/srcirc.htm. An instruction manual for the unit marketed by Dietzgen can be found at http://www.sliderulemuseum.com/SR_Library_General.htm. All retrieved March 14, 2007.</ref>\n\nCircular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1&nbsp;mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2&nbsp;mm worst case alignment error. The pivot, however, does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than \"split\" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale. Around 1970, an inexpensive model from B. C. Boykin (Model 510) featured 20 scales, including 50-inch C-D (multiplication) and log scales. The RotaRule featured a friction brake for the cursor.\n\nThe main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.\n\nOne slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the [[E6B]]. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with [[dead reckoning]]. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called \"prayer wheel\" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.\n\nProportion wheels are simple circular slide rules used in graphic design to calculate [[aspect ratio]]s. Lining up the original and desired size values on the inner and outer wheels will display their ratio as a percentage in a small window. They are not as common since the advent of computerized layout, but {{cns|are still made and used.<!-- please add {{as of}} or equivalent when sourcing -->|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1952, Swiss watch company [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a \"navigation computer\", featured [[airspeed]], [[rate of climb|rate]]/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer—[[nautical mile]] and gallon—liter fuel amount conversion functions.\n<gallery>\nFile:Csl.JPG|A simple circular slide rule, made by Concise Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, with only inverse, square, and cubic scales.

In either case, the advantage is a much longer scale, and hence potentially greater precision, than afforded by a straight or circular rule.\n<gallery>\nFile:Otis King Model K (horizontal).jpg|Otis King Model K\nFile:Senator John Heinz History Center - IMG 7824.JPG|Thacher slide rule, circa 1890\n</gallery>\n\n===Materials===\nTraditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.\n\nIn 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/tektid/1933a/0348.html|title=336 (Teknisk Tidskrift / 1933. Allmänna avdelningen)|publisher=Runeberg.org|date=|accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref> and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of [[celluloid]], plastic, or painted aluminium. Later cursors were [[acryl group|acrylics]] or [[polycarbonate]]s sliding on [[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] bearings.\n\nAll premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other [[resin]]. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} For painted slide rules, use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:oughtred.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Oughtred]] (1575–1660), inventor of the slide rule]]\nThe slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after [[John Napier]]'s publication of the concept of the [[logarithm]].

Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over [[Scientific priority|priority]], with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nIn 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a \"sliding rule\" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\n\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a nautical slide rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.<ref>\"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule\", ''The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine'', April 1845, p. 187 and Plate XX-B</ref>\n\n===Modern form===\n[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|Engineer using a slide rule, with mechanical calculator in background, mid 20th century]]\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Amédée Mannheim]], \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around this time that engineering became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe–but not in the United States. There, Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881.

However, there has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3950/is_200401/ai_n9372466|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510072825/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3950/is_200401/ai_n9372466|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-05-10|title=Prosthaphaeretic Slide Rule: A Mechanical Multiplication Device Based On Trigonometric Identities, The &#124; Mathematics And Computer Education &#124; Find Articles At Bnet|publisher=Findarticles.com|date=2009-06-02|accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref>\n\n===Specialized calculators===\nSlide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., but some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone & Sons 1892 catalog lists a \"Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge\", a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements.\n\nThere were many specialized slide rules for photographic applications; for example, the [[actinograph]] of [[Hurter and Driffield]] was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] from time of day, time of year, and latitude.\n\nSpecialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the [[Fisher Controls]] company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natgasedu.com/vm004.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106031649/http://www.natgasedu.com/vm004.html |archivedate=6 January 2010 |title=Fisher sizing rules |accessdate=2009-10-06 |work=natgasedu.com |deadurl=yes |df=}}</ref>\n\nPilot balloon slide rules were used by meteorologists in weather services to determine the upper wind velocities from an ascending hydrogen or helium filled pilot balloon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotballoon.com/slide.htm|title=Pilot Balloon Slide Rules|work=www.pilotballoon.com|accessdate=28 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928041013/http://www.pilotballoon.com/slide.htm|archive-date=2016-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn World War II, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the U.S. Navy actually designed a generic slide rule \"chassis\" with an aluminium body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for aircraft, and then adapted to many other purposes.\n\nThe [[E6B|E6-B]] is a circular slide rule used by pilots and navigators.\n\nCircular slide rules to estimate ovulation dates and fertility are known as ''wheel calculators''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767050412331312200 |pmid=15061314 |title=Circle of time: errors in the use of the pregnancy wheel |journal=Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine |date=2003 |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=370–372 |first=M.

(See [[History of computing hardware (1960s–present)]].)\n\nAnother step away from slide rules was the introduction of relatively inexpensive electronic desktop scientific calculators.

This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.\n\nAs with mainframe computing, the availability of these machines did not significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule until cheap hand held scientific electronic calculators became available in the mid-1970s, at which point, it rapidly declined.\nThe pocket-sized Hewlett-Packard [[HP-35]] scientific calculator was the first handheld device of its type, but it cost [[United States dollar|US$]]395 in 1972. This was justifiable for some engineering professionals but too expensive for most students.\nBy 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for less than $50, and by 1976 the [[TI-30]] scientific calculator was sold for less than $25 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|25|1976|r=2}}|0}} adjusted for inflation).\n\n==Comparison to electronic digital calculators==\n[[File:IBM 150 Extra Engineers 1951.jpg|thumb|upright|December 1951 advertisement for the IBM 604 [[IBM CPC|Electronic Calculating Punch]] explicitly comparing electronic computers to engineers calculating with slide rules]]\nMost people find slide rules difficult to learn and use. Even during their heyday, they never caught on with the general public.<ref>Stoll, Cliff. \"When Slide Rules Ruled,\" ''Scientific American,'' May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. \"The difficulty of learning to use slide rules discouraged their use among the hoi polloi. Yes, the occasional grocery store manager figured discounts on a slipstick, and this author once caught his high school English teacher calculating stats for trifecta horse-race winners on a slide rule during study hall.

Slide rules remained tools for techies.\"</ref> Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on slide rules and doing a calculation on a slide rule tends to be slower than on a calculator.<ref>Watson, George H.

I vividly recall that at the end of 1974, the students who were still using slide rules were given an additional 15 minutes on the final examination to compensate for the computational advantage afforded by the calculator, hardly adequate compensation in the opinions of the remaining slide rule practitioners.\"</ref> This led engineers to use mathematical equations that favored operations that were easy on a slide rule over more accurate but complex functions; these approximations could lead to inaccuracies and mistakes.<ref>Stoll, Cliff. \"When Slide Rules Ruled,\" ''Scientific American,'' May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. \"With computation moving literally at a hand's pace and the lack of precision a given, mathematicians worked to simplify complex problems. Because linear equations were friendlier to slide rules than more complex functions were, scientists struggled to linearize mathematical relations, often sweeping high-order or less significant terms under the computational carpet. So a car designer might calculate gas consumption by looking mainly at an engine's power, while ignoring how air friction varies with speed. Engineers developed shortcuts and rules of thumb. At their best, these measures led to time savings, insight and understanding. On the downside, these approximations could hide mistakes and lead to gross errors.\"</ref> On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of slide rules cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital calculators often lack.<ref>Stoll, Cliff. \"When Slide Rules Ruled\", ''Scientific American'', May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. \"One effect was that users felt close to the numbers, aware of rounding-off errors and systematic inaccuracies, unlike users of today's computer-design programs. Chat with an engineer from the 1950s, and you will most likely hear a lament for the days when calculation went hand-in-hand with deeper comprehension. Instead of plugging numbers into a computer program, an engineer would understand the fine points of loads and stresses, voltages and currents, angles and distances. Numeric answers, crafted by hand, meant problem solving through knowledge and analysis rather than sheer number crunching.\"</ref> A slide rule will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed.\n\nA slide rule requires the user to separately compute the [[order of magnitude]] of the answer in order to position the decimal point in the results. For example, 1.5 × 30 (which equals 45) will show the same result as 1,500,000 × 0.03 (which equals 45,000). This separate calculation is less likely to lead to extreme calculation errors, but forces the user to keep track of magnitude in short-term memory (which is error-prone), keep notes (which is cumbersome) or reason about it in every step (which distracts from the other calculation requirements).\n\nThe typical [[arithmetic precision]] of a slide rule is about three [[significant digits]], compared to many digits on digital calculators. As order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule, users are less likely to make errors of [[false precision]].\n\nWhen performing a sequence of multiplications or divisions by the same number, the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation. This can be especially useful when calculating percentages (e.g. for test scores) or when comparing prices (e.g. in dollars per kilogram). Multiple speed-time-distance calculations can be performed hands-free at a glance with a slide rule. Other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations.\n\nBeing entirely mechanical, a slide rule does not depend on [[grid (electricity)|grid electricity]] or batteries. However, mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.\n\nMany sailors keep slide rules as backups for navigation in case of electric failure or battery depletion on long route segments. Slide rules are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The [[E6B]] circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT is a notable example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenwatch.com/en-us/watches/watch-detail/?model=JY0000-53E#filters=0000-53E|title=Citizen Watch Company – Citizen Eco-Drive / US, Canada, UK, IrelandCitizen Watch<!-- Bot generated title -->|work=citizenwatch.com}}</ref>\n\n==Contemporary usage==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:Faber Castell 6 inch slide rule.JPG|thumb|right|[[Faber-Castell]] slide rule with pouch]]\nEven today, some people prefer a slide rule over an electronic calculator as a practical computing device.

Another prized American model is the eight-inch (20&nbsp;cm) Scientific Instruments circular rule. Of European rules, [[Faber-Castell]]'s high-end models are the most popular among collectors.\n\nAlthough a great many slide rules are circulating on the market, specimens in good condition tend to be expensive. Many rules found for sale on [[:Category:online auction websites|online auction sites]] are damaged or have missing parts, and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information. Replacement parts are scarce, expensive, and generally available only for separate purchase on individual collectors' web sites.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-logarithm",
      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2007}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''super-logarithm''' is one of the two inverse functions of [[tetration]]. Just as [[exponentiation]] has two inverse functions, [[Nth root|roots]] and [[logarithms]], [[tetration]] has two inverse functions, [[super-root]]s and super-logarithms. There are several ways of interpreting super-logarithms:\n\n* As the [[Abel function]] of [[exponential function]]s,\n* As the inverse function of [[tetration]] with respect to the height,\n* As a generalization of Robert Munafo's [http://www.mrob.com/pub/math/largenum.html large number class system],\n\nFor positive integer values, the super-logarithm with base-''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' is equivalent to the number of times a [[logarithm]] must be [[iterated function|iterated]] to get to 1 (the [[Iterated logarithm]]). However, this is not true for negative values and so cannot be considered a full definition.\nThe precise definition of the super-logarithm depends on a precise definition of non-integral [[tetration]] (that is, <math> {^{y} x} </math> for ''y'' not an integer). There is no clear consensus on the definition of non-integral [[tetration]] and so there is likewise no clear consensus on the super-logarithm for non-integer [[range (mathematics)|range]].\n\n==Definitions==\nThe super-logarithm, written <math>\\operatorname{slog}_b(z),</math> is defined implicitly by\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{slog}_b(b^z) = \\operatorname{slog}_b(z) + 1</math> and\n:<math>\\operatorname{slog}_b(1) = 0.</math>\n\nThis definition implies that the super-logarithm can only have integer outputs, and that it is only defined for inputs of the form <math>b, b^b, b^{b^b},</math> and so on. In order to extend the domain of the super-logarithm from this sparse set to the real numbers, several approaches have been pursued. These usually include a third requirement in addition to those listed above, which vary from author to author. These approaches are as follows:\n\n* The linear approximation approach by Rubstov and Romerio,\n* The quadratic approximation approach by Andrew Robbins,\n* The regular Abel function approach by George Szekeres,\n* The iterative functional approach by Peter Walker, and\n* The natural matrix approach by Peter Walker, and later generalized by Andrew Robbins.\n\n== Approximations ==\nUsually, the [[special functions]] are defined not only for the real values of argument(s), but to complex plane, and differential and/or integral representation, as well as expansions in convergent and asymptotic series. Yet, no such representations are available for the '''slog''' function. Nevertheless, the simple approximations below are suggested.\n\n===Linear approximation===\nThe linear approximation to the super-logarithm is:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{slog}_b(z) \\approx \\begin{cases}\n\\operatorname{slog}_b(b^z) - 1 & \\text{if } z \\le 0 \\\\\n-1 + z & \\text{if } 0 < z \\le 1 \\\\\n\\operatorname{slog}_b(\\log_b(z)) + 1 & \\text{if } 1 < z \\\\\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhich is a piecewise-defined function with a linear \"critical piece\". This function has the property that it is continuous for all real ''z'' (<math>C^0</math> continuous). The first authors to recognize this approximation were Rubstov and Romerio, although it is not in [http://forum.wolframscience.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=579 their paper], it can be found in [http://forum.wolframscience.com/showthread.php?threadid=956 their algorithm] that is used in their software prototype. The linear approximation to [[tetration]], on the other hand, had been known before, for example by [[Ioannis Galidakis]]. This is a natural inverse of the linear approximation to [[tetration]].\n\nAuthors like Holmes recognize that the super-logarithm would be a great use to the next evolution of computer floating-point arithmetic, but for this purpose, the function need not be infinitely differentiable. Thus, for the purpose of representing large numbers, the linear approximation approach provides enough continuity (<math>C^0</math> continuity) to ensure that all real numbers can be represented on a super-logarithmic scale.\n\n===Quadratic approximation===\nThe [[quadratic approximation]] to the super-logarithm is:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{slog}_b(z) \\approx \\begin{cases}\n\\operatorname{slog}_b(b^z) - 1 & \\text{if } z \\le 0 \\\\\n-1 + \\frac{2\\log(b)}{1+\\log(b)}z + \n\\frac{1-\\log(b)}{1+\\log(b)}z^2 & \\text{if } 0 < z \\le 1 \\\\\n\\operatorname{slog}_b(\\log_b(z)) + 1 & \\text{if } 1 < z\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhich is a piecewise-defined function with a quadratic \"critical piece\". This function has the property that it is continuous and differentiable for all real ''z'' (<math>C^1</math> continuous).

Due to the identity\n\n: <math>\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b},</math>\n\nthe logarithms of any given number ''a'' to two different bases (here ''b'' and ''c'') differ only by the constant factor log<sub>''c''</sub>&nbsp;''b''.  This constant factor can be considered to represent the conversion factor for converting a numerical representation of the pure (indefinite) logarithmic quantity Log(''a'') from one arbitrary unit of measurement (the [log&nbsp;''c''] unit) to another (the [log&nbsp;''b''] unit), since\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{Log}(a) = (\\log_b a)[\\log b] = (\\log_c a)[\\log c] .</math>\n\nFor example, [[Boltzmann]]'s standard definition of entropy ''S'' = ''k''&nbsp;ln&nbsp;''W'' (where ''W'' is the number of ways of arranging a system and ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]]) can also be written more simply as just ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;Log(''W''), where \"Log\" here denotes the indefinite logarithm, and we let ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[log&nbsp;e]; that is, we identify the physical entropy unit ''k'' with the mathematical unit [log&nbsp;e].  This identity works because\n\n: <math>\\ln W = \\log_e W = \\frac{\\operatorname{Log}(W)}{\\log e}.</math>\n\nThus, we can interpret Boltzmann's constant as being simply the expression (in terms of more standard physical units) of the abstract logarithmic unit [log&nbsp;e] that is needed to convert the dimensionless pure-number quantity ln&nbsp;''W'' (which uses an arbitrary choice of base, namely e) to the more fundamental pure logarithmic quantity Log(''W''), which implies no particular choice of base, and thus no particular choice of physical unit for measuring entropy.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Alexander Graham Bell]]\n* [[Bode plot]]\n* [[John Napier]]\n* [[Level (logarithmic quantity)]]\n* [[Logarithm]]\n* [[Logarithmic mean]]\n* [[Log semiring]]\n* [[Multiplicative calculus]]\n* [[Preferred number]]\n\n===Scale===\n* [[Order of magnitude]]\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Entropy]]\n* [[Entropy (information theory)]]\n* [[pH]]\n* [[Richter magnitude scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |author-first1=Stanislas |author-last1=Dehaene |author-first2=Véronique |author-last2=Izard |author-first3=Elizabeth |author-last3=Spelke |author-link3=Elizabeth Spelke |author-first4=Pierre |author-last4=Pica |author-link4=Pierre Pica |date=2008 |title=Log or linear?

Since the absorbance of a sample is measured as a logarithm, it is directly proportional to the thickness of the sample and to the concentration of the absorbing material in the sample. Some other measures related to absorption, such as transmittance, are measured as a simple ratio so they vary exponentially with the thickness and concentration of the material.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

An instrument must be calibrated and checked against known standards if the readings are to be trusted. Many instruments will become non-linear (fail to follow the Beer–Lambert law) starting at approximately 2 AU (~1% transmission). It is also difficult to accurately measure very small absorbance values (below 10<sup>−4</sup>) with commercially available instruments for chemical analysis. In such cases, [[Laser absorption spectrometry|laser-based absorption techniques]] can be used, since they have demonstrated detection limits that supersede those obtained by conventional non-laser-based instruments by many orders of magnitude (detections have been demonstrated all the way down to 5 × 10<sup>−13</sup>). The theoretical best accuracy for most commercially available non-laser-based instruments is attained in the range near 1 AU. The path length or concentration should then, when possible, be adjusted to achieve readings near this range.\n\n===Method of measurement===\nTypically, absorbance of a dissolved substance is measured using [[absorption spectroscopy]]. This involves shining a light through a solution and recording how much light and what wavelengths were transmitted onto a detector. Using this information, the wavelengths that were absorbed can be determined.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Visible and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/Spectrpy/UV-Vis/spectrum.htm|accessdate=2014-10-29}}</ref> First, measurements on a \"blank\" are taken using just the solvent for reference purposes. This is so that the absorbance of the solvent is known, and then any change in absorbance when measuring the whole solution is made by just the solute of interest. Then measurements of the solution are taken. The transmitted spectral radiant flux that makes it through the solution sample is measured and compared to the incident spectral radiant flux. As stated above, the spectral absorbance at a given wavelength is\n:<math>A_\\lambda = \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{e},\\lambda}^\\mathrm{i}}{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{e},\\lambda}^\\mathrm{t}}\\right)\\!.</math>\n\nThe absorbance spectrum is plotted on a graph of absorbance vs. wavelength.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Empirical Rules for Absorption Wavelengths of Conjugated Systems|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/Spectrpy/UV-Vis/uvspec.htm#uv1|accessdate=2014-10-29}}</ref>\n\nA [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy#Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer|UV-Vis spectrophotometer]] will do all this automatically. To use this machine, solutions are placed in a small [[cuvette]] and inserted into the holder. The machine is controlled through a computer and, once you \"blank\" it, will automatically display the absorbance plotted against wavelength. Getting the absorbance spectrum of a solution is useful for determining the concentration of that solution using the Beer–Lambert law and is used in [[HPLC]].\n\n==Shade number==\nSome filters, notably [[welding]] glass, are rated by shade number, which is 7/3 times the absorbance plus one:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictS.html|author=Russ Rowlett|title=How Many?

The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]].\n\nIn 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is about 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856|bibcode=1856MNRAS..17...12P |doi=10.1093/mnras/17.1.12 }}</ref> The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.\n\nApart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black-body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength, can be computed.<ref>See [https://archive.is/20121204144725/http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html].</ref> Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.\n\nWith the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as the bright planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of −1.4 in the visible. Negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.\n\nAstronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the [[AB magnitude]] system,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J. B.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. E.|title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=March 15, 1983|volume=266|pages=713–717|doi=10.1086/160817|bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O}}</ref> in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant [[Spectral flux density|flux per unit frequency interval]], rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.\n\n== Calculations ==\n[[File:VISTA Magellanic Cloud Survey view of the Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Image of [[30 Doradus]] taken by [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]]. This [[nebula]] has an apparent magnitude of 8.]]\n[[File:Apparent magnitude.svg|thumb|A graph of apparent magnitude against brightness]]\n\nAs the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced by transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], any measurement of apparent magnitude is [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|corrected]] for what it would have been as seen from above the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by\n\n:<math>m_{x}= -5 \\log_{100} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base-10) logarithms]] as\n\n:<math>m_{x} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|F<sub>x</sub>}} is the observed [[flux density]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]]. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} ≈&nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub> − ''m''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} Δ''m''}} implies a brightness factor of\n\n:<math> \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\\frac{\\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \\Delta m} \\approx 2.512^{\\Delta m}.</math>\n\n=== Example: Sun and Moon ===\n''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''\n\nThe apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the [[full moon]] is −12.74 (dimmer).\n\nDifference in magnitude: \n:<math> x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00. </math>\n\nBrightness factor: \n:<math> v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4 \\times 14.00} \\approx 398\\,107.17. </math>\n\nThe Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.\n\n===Magnitude addition===\nSometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>\n:<math> 10^{-m_f \\times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4}. </math>\n\nSolving for <math>m_f</math> yields\n:<math> m_f = -2.5\\log_{10} \\left(10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|m<sub>f</sub>}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\n===Apparent bolometric magnitude===\nWhile apparent magnitude generally refers to a measurement in a particular filter band corresponding to some range of wavelengths, the '''apparent bolometric magnitude''' (m<sub>bol</sub>) is a measure of an object's apparent brightness integrated over all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (also known as the object's [[irradiance]]).

Flux decreases with distance according to an [[inverse-square law]], so the apparent magnitude of a star depends on both its absolute brightness and its distance (and any extinction). For example, a star at one distance will have the same apparent magnitude as a star four times brighter at twice that distance.  In contrast, the intrinsic brightness of an astronomical object, does not depend on the distance of the observer or any [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]].\n\nThe absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s (about 32.6 [[light-year]]s). The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (green) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).<ref name=\"Bband\">{{cite web\n |title=Some Useful Astronomical Definitions\n |publisher=Stony Brook Astronomy Program\n |first=Aaron\n |last=Evans\n |url=http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/aevans/PHY523/classnotes523/useful-definitions-pp.pdf\n |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref>\n\nIn the case of a planet or asteroid, the absolute magnitude {{mvar|H}} rather means the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 1 [[astronomical unit]] from both the observer and the Sun, and fully illuminated (a configuration that is only theoretically achievable, with the observer situated on the surface of the Sun).{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Standard reference values ==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Standard apparent magnitudes and fluxes for typical bands<ref name=\"UTmags\">{{cite web\n |title=Astronomical Magnitude Systems \n |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n |first=John\n |last=Huchra \n |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfabricant/huchra/ay145/mags.html\n |accessdate=2017-07-18\n}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Band\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{mvar|λ}}<br/>(μm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{math|{{sfrac|Δ''λ''|''λ''}}}}<br/>([[full width at half maximum|FWHM]])\n! colspan=\"2\" | Flux at {{math|''m'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}}\n\n|-\n!

For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because [[Apparent magnitude#History|Pogson's Ratio]] raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.\n\nA common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber–Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C. V.|last2=Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|issue=10|page=1003|date=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}</ref>\n\nMagnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as visual magnitude.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nBecause cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nMeasures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nFor objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given absolute magnitude, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be [[K correction|adjusted for redshifts]] and for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] distance measures due to [[general relativity]].<ref name=umeh>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014CQGra..31t5001U|arxiv=1402.1933|title=Nonlinear relativistic corrections to cosmological distances, redshift and gravitational lensing magnification: II.

Twelve-tone [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|equal temperament]] divides the [[octave]] into 12 [[semitones]] of 100 cents each. Typically, cents are used to express small intervals, or to compare the sizes of comparable intervals in different [[tuning system]]s, and in fact the interval of one cent is too small to be heard between successive notes.\n\n[[Alexander J. Ellis]] based the measure on the ''acoustic logarithms'' decimal semitone system developed by [[Gaspard de Prony]] in the 1830s, at [[Robert Holford Macdowell Bosanquet]]'s suggestion. Ellis made extensive measurements of musical instruments from around the world, using cents extensively to report and compare the scales employed,<ref>[[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]]: [http://stuart.sfa.googlepages.com/MSVN00.html On the Musical Scales of Various Nations] HTML transcription of the 1885 article in the Journal of the Society of Arts (Accessed September 2008){{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> and further described and employed the system in his 1875 edition of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s ''On the Sensations of Tone''. It has become the standard method of representing and comparing musical pitches and intervals.<ref>Benson, Dave (2007). ''Music: A Mathematical Offering'', p.166. Cambridge. {{ISBN|9780521853873}}. \"The system most often employed in the modern literature.\"</ref><ref>Renold, Maria (2004). ''Intervals, Scales, Tones and the Concert Pitch C = 128 Hz'', p. 138. Translated from German by Bevis Stevens, edited by Anna Meuss (1998). Temple Lodge. {{ISBN|9781902636467}}. \"Interval proportions can be converted to the cent values which are in common use today.\"</ref>\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Music intervals frequency ratio equal tempered pythagorean comparison.svg|thumb|550px|right|Comparison of [[equal-tempered]] (black) and [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] (green) intervals showing the relationship between frequency ratio and the intervals' values, in cents.]]\n\nLike a [[decibel]]'s relation to intensity, a cent is a ratio between two close frequencies. For the ratio to remain constant over the frequency spectrum, the frequency range encompassed by a cent must be proportional to the two frequencies. An [[equal temperament|equally tempered]] [[semitone]] (the interval between two adjacent piano keys) spans 100 cents by definition. An [[octave]]—two notes that have a frequency ratio of 2:1—spans twelve semitones and therefore 1200 cents. Since a frequency raised by one cent is simply multiplied by this constant cent value, and 1200 cents doubles a frequency, the ratio of frequencies one cent apart is precisely equal to 2{{sup|{{frac|1200}}}} = {{radic|2|1200}}, the [[twelfth root of two|1200th root of 2]], which is approximately {{val|1.0005777895}}.\n\nIf one knows the frequencies ''a'' and ''b'' of two notes, the number of cents measuring the interval from ''a'' to ''b'' may be calculated by the following formula (similar to the definition of a decibel):\n\n:<math>n = 1200 \\cdot \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{b}{a} \\right)</math>\n\nLikewise, if one knows a note ''a'' and the number ''n'' of cents in the interval from ''a'' to ''b'', then ''b'' may be calculated by:\n\n:<math>b = a \\times 2 ^ \\frac{n}{1200}</math>\n\nTo compare different tuning systems, convert the various interval sizes into cents. For example, in [[just intonation]], the major third is represented by the frequency ratio 5:4. Applying the formula at the top shows that this is about 386 cents. The equivalent interval on the equal-tempered piano would be 400 cents. The difference, 14 cents, is about a seventh of a half step, easily audible.\n\n==Piecewise linear approximation==\nAs ''x'' increases from 0 to {{frac|1|12}}, the function 2<sup>''x''</sup> increases almost linearly from {{val|1.00000}} to {{val|1.05946}}. The exponential cent scale can therefore be accurately approximated as a [[piecewise linear function]] that is numerically correct at semitones. That is, ''n'' cents for ''n'' from 0 to 100 may be approximated as 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{val|0.0005946}}''n'' instead of 2{{sup|{{frac|''n''|1200}}}}. The rounded error is zero when ''n'' is 0 or 100, and is about 0.72 cents high when ''n'' is 50, where the correct value of 2{{sup|{{frac|1|24}}}} = {{val|1.02930}} is approximated by 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{val|0.0005946}}&nbsp;×&nbsp;50 = 1.02973.  This error is well below anything humanly audible, making this piecewise linear approximation adequate for most practical purposes.\n\n==Human perception==\n[[File:Unison versus cent waveform.png|thumb|350px|Waveforms of a unison (blue) versus a cent (red), nearly indistinguishable.]]\n\nIt is difficult to establish how many cents are perceptible to humans; this accuracy varies greatly from person to person.  One author stated that humans can distinguish a difference in pitch of about 5–6 cents.<ref>D.B. Loeffler, \"[http://etd.gatech.edu/theses/available/etd-04102006-142310/ Instrument Timbres and Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218232401/http://etd.gatech.edu/theses/available/etd-04102006-142310/ |date=2007-12-18 }}\"  Master's Thesis, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech.

A structure is defined to build a set of numbers that are convenient for use by humans in counting or measuring.\n\n[[National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS) (which was later renamed to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)) defined a set of convenient numbers during the 1970s when it was developing procedures for [[metrication in the United States]]. The NBS technical note describes that system of convenient metric values as the [[1-2-5 series]] in reverse, with assigned preferences for those numbers which are multiples of 5, 2, and 1 (plus their powers of 10), excluding linear dimensions above 100 mm (because such measurements are defined by another set of rules), from which the Schedule of Convenient Numbers Between 10 and 100 below is reproduced.<ref name=\"GOVPUB-C13\"/>\n\nThe NBS technical note also states that \"Basically, integers are more convenient than expressions which include decimal parts [decimal fractions]. Furthermore, where measuring devices are used, values which represent numbered subdivisions on such instruments are more useful than values which have to be interpolated. For example, where a tape or a scale is graduated in intervals of 5, any value that represents a multiple of 5 is more \"convenient\" to measure or verify than one which is not. In addition, where operations involve the subdivision of quantities into two or more equal parts, any number that is highly divisible has an explicit advantage.\"\n\n=== Schedule of convenient numbers between 10 and 100 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!1st preference\n''n'' × 50\n!2nd preference\n''n'' × 20\n!3rd preference\n''n'' × 10\n!4th preference\n''n'' × 5\n!5th preference\n''n'' × 2\n!6th preference\n''n'' × 1\n|-\n| ||\n|colspan=4|10\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|11\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|12\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|13\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|14\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|15\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|16\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|17\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|18\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|19\n|-\n|\n|colspan=5|20\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|21\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|22\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|23\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|24\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|25*\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|26\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|27\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|28\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|29\n|-\n| ||\n|colspan=4|30\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|31\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|32\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|33\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|34\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|35\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|36\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|37\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|38\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|39\n|-\n|\n|colspan=5|40\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|41\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|42\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|43\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|44\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|45\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|46\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|47\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|48\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|49\n|-\n|colspan=6|50\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|51\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|52\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|53\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|54\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|55\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|56\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|57\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|58\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|59\n|-\n|\n|colspan=5|60\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|61\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|62\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|63\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|64\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|65\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|66\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|67\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|68\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|69\n|-\n| ||\n|colspan=4|70\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|71\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|72\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|73\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|74\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|75*\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|76\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|77\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|78\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|79\n|-\n|\n|colspan=5|80\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|81\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|82\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|83\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|84\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|85\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|86\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|87\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|88\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|89\n|-\n| ||\n|colspan=4|90\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|91\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|92\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|93\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|94\n|-\n| || ||\n|colspan=3|95\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|96\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|97\n|-\n| || || ||\n|colspan=2|98\n|-\n| || || || ||\n|99\n|-\n|colspan=6|100\n|}\n\nNotes:\n# Numbers are shown once only, in the highest applicable preference column.

Haldane named the unit after [[Charles Darwin]].\n\n==Equation==\nThe equation for calculating evolutionary change in darwins (<math>r</math>) is:\n\n:<math>r=\\frac{{\\rm ln} X_2 - {\\rm ln} X_1}{\\Delta  t}</math>\n\nwhere <math>X_1</math> and <math>X_2</math> are the initial and final values of the trait and <math>\\Delta t</math> is the change in time in millions of years.  An alternative form of this equation is:\n\n:<math>r=\\frac{{\\rm ln} \\frac{X_2}{X_1}}{\\Delta  t}</math>\n\nSince the difference between two [[natural logarithm]]s is a [[dimension]]less [[ratio]], the trait may be measured in any [[Units of measurement|unit]].  Also for this reason the darwin is a specialist form of the inverse [[mega-annum]] (<math>Ma^{-1}</math>).\n\n==Application==\nThe measure is most useful in [[palaeontology]], where [[macroevolutionary]] changes in the dimensions of [[fossil]]s can be compared.  Where this is used it is an indirect measure as it relies on [[phenotypic]] rather than [[genotypic]] data.  Several data points are required to overcome natural variation within a population.  The darwin only measures the evolution of a particular [[Trait (biology)|trait]] rather than a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]; different traits may evolve at different rates within a lineage.  The evolution of traits can however be used to infer as a [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] the evolution of lineages.\n\nGenetic information cannot be obtained from fossils, but modern (post-Haldane) techniques on extant organisms now rely on genetic data (q.v. [[phylogenetics]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n* [[Evolutionary biology]]\n* [[Microevolution]]\n* [[Macroevolution]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Evolutionary biology]]\n[[Category:Rate of evolution]]\n[[Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement]]"

It is used in radio, microwave and fiber-optical communication networks as a convenient measure of absolute [[power (physics)|power]] because of its capability to express both very large and very small values in a short form compared to [[dBW]], which is referenced to one watt (1,000&nbsp;mW).\n\nSince it is referenced to the [[watt]], it is an absolute unit, used when measuring absolute power. By comparison, the decibel ('''dB''') is a [[dimensionless unit]], used for quantifying the ratio between two values, such as [[signal-to-noise ratio]].\nThe dBm is also dimensionless but since it compares to a fixed reference value the dBm rating is an absolute one. \n\nIn audio and telephony, dBm is typically referenced relative to a 600-ohm impedance,<ref>{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Stephen|title=Understanding Telephone Electronics|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0750671750|pages=16}}</ref> while in radio-frequency work dBm is typically referenced relative to a 50-ohm impedance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Joseph|title=RF Components and Circuits|year=2002|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0750648448|pages=45–46}}</ref>\n\n==Unit conversions==\nA power level of 0&nbsp;dBm corresponds to a power of 1 milliwatt. A 10&nbsp;dB increase in level is equivalent to a 10-fold increase in power. A 3&nbsp;dB increase in level is approximately equivalent to doubling the power, which means that a level of 3&nbsp;dBm corresponds roughly to a power of 2&nbsp;mW. Similarly, for each 3&nbsp;dB decrease in level, the power is reduced by about one half, making −3&nbsp;dBm correspond to a power of about 0.5&nbsp;mW.\n\nTo express an arbitrary power ''P'' in mW as ''x'' in dBm, or vice versa, the following equivalent expressions may be used:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n x &= 10 \\log_{10} \\frac{P}{1~\\text{mW}}, \\\\\n P &= 1~\\text{mW} \\cdot 10^{\\frac{x}{10}},\n\\end{align}</math>\nAlternatively, using 1 W as the reference value instead of 1 mW\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n x &= 30 + 10 \\log_{10} \\frac{P}{1~\\text{W}}, \\\\\n P &= 1~\\text{W} \\cdot 10^{\\frac{x - 30}{10}},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBelow is a table summarizing useful cases:\n\n{{Main|Orders of magnitude (power)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Both the radar reflectivity factor and its logarithmic version are commonly referred to as ''reflectivity'' when the context is clear.\n\n== Principle ==\n\nThe radar reflectivity factor ('''Z''') of [[precipitation]] is dependent on the number ('''N<sub>0</sub>''') and size ('''D''') of reflectors ([[hydrometeor]]s), which includes [[rain]], [[snow]], [[graupel]], and [[hail]]. Very sensitive radars can also measure the reflectivity of cloud drops and ice.

The signal returned to the [[radar]] will be equivalent in both situations, so a group of small hydrometeors is virtually indistinguishable from one large hydrometeor on the resulting radar image. The [[reflectivity]] image is just one type of image produced by a radar.

For example, an [[audio amplifier]] will usually have a frequency band ranging from 20 Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz and representing the entire band using a decade log scale is very convenient. Typically the graph for such a representation would begin at 1 Hz (10<sup>0</sup>) and go up to perhaps 100&nbsp;kHz (10<sup>5</sup>), to comfortably include the full audio band in a standard-sized [[graph paper]], as shown below.  Whereas in the same distance on a linear scale, with 10 as the major step-size, you might only get from 0 to 50.\n\n[[Image:Butterworth filter bode plot.svg|350px|thumb|right|[[Bode plot]] showing the concept of a decade: each major division on the horizontal axis is one decade]]\n\nElectronic frequency responses are often described in terms of \"per decade\".

It can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: [[Field, power, and root-power quantities|power and field (root-power)]]. When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a [[unit of measurement]] for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name 'logit' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

In spite of their widespread use, [[#Suffixes and reference values|suffixes]] (such as in [[A-weighting|dBA]] or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\n\n==Definition==\nISO 80000-3 describes definitions for quantities and units of space and time. The decibel for use in acoustics is defined in {{nowrap|ISO 80000-8}}. The major difference from the article below is that for acoustics the decibel has no absolute value.\n\nThe ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-3:2006]] defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.1 B}}. The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513… Np = 0.11513…}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[…] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times […]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=206 |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[…] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB […]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.  Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written '0.05&nbsp;dB', and not '5 mB'.<ref>Fedor Mitschke, ''Fiber Optics: Physics and Technology'', Springer, 2010 {{ISBN|3642037038}}.</ref>\n\nThe method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a ''power quantity'' or a ''root-power quantity''; see ''[[Field, power, and root-power quantities]]'' for details.\n\n===Power quantities===\nWhen referring to measurements of ''[[Power (physics)|power]]'' quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] in decibels by evaluating ten times the [[base-10 logarithm]] of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref name=\"standardization2006\"/>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Field, power, and root-power quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is ±3.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} ≈ 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than ±6.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB is a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB is the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> ≈ 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' × ''B'' × ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2× power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10× power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W × 10 × 10 × 2 × 1.26 × 1.26  ≈ 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W × 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:<ref>R.

Peters, ''Acoustics and Noise Control'', Routledge, November 12, 2013, 400 pages, p.&nbsp;13</ref> \"if two machines each individually produce a [[sound pressure]] level of, say, 90&nbsp;dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93&nbsp;dB, but certainly not to 180&nbsp;dB!\"; \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87&nbsp;dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83&nbsp;dBA.

The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure|common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure]].

(See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\nThe main instrument used for measuring sound levels in the environment and in the workplace is the [[Sound level meter|Sound Level Meter]]. Most sound level meters provide readings in A, C, and Z-weighted decibels and must{{whom|date=June 2019}} meet international standards such as [[IEC 61672|IEC 61672-2013]].\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;Ω }}≈ 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123–126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to −1&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, \"Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel\", ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]</ref> The proper way, according to the [[IEC 60027-3]],<ref name=\"IEC60027-3\"/> is either as ''L''<sub>''x''</sub> (re ''x''<sub>ref</sub>) or as ''L''<sub>''x''/''x''<sub>ref</sub></sub>, where ''x'' is the quantity symbol and ''x''<sub>ref</sub> is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., ''L''<sub>''E''</sub> (re  1 μV/m) = ''L''<sub>''E''/(1 μV/m)</sub> for the [[electric field strength]] ''E'' relative to 1 μV/m reference value.\n\nOutside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of μV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"λ\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a dash (dB-Hz), with a space (dB HL), with no intervening character (dBm), or enclosed in parentheses (dB(sm)).\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|300px|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600 Ω [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV:dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>) – [[volt]]age relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref> This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer [[Line level|line-level]] of {{nowrap|−10 dBV}}, in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} line-level signal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22#v=onepage&q=pickup&f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}</math>.}} An [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage of 1&nbsp;V is therefore corresponds to <math>20\\cdot\\log_{10}\\left ( \\frac{1\\,V_\\text{RMS}}{\\sqrt{0.6}\\,V} \\right )=2.218\\,\\text{dBu}.</math><ref name=\"clqgmk\" /> Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html|title=3.3 - What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?

      "text": "'''Effective radiated power''' ('''ERP'''), synonymous with '''equivalent radiated power''',  is an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized definition of directional [[radio frequency]] (RF) power, such as that emitted by a [[radio transmitter]].  It is the total [[Power (physics)|power]] in [[watt (unit)|watt]]s that would have to be radiated by a [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole antenna]] to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength in watts per square meter) as the actual source at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam ([[main lobe]]).  ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.   It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the [[antenna gain|gain]] of the antenna.  It is used in electronics and [[telecommunication]]s, particularly in [[broadcasting]] to quantify the apparent power of a [[broadcasting station]] experienced by listeners in its reception area.\n\nAn alternate parameter that measures the same thing is '''effective (or equivalent) isotropic radiated power''' ('''EIRP''').  Effective isotropic radiated power is the total power that would have to be radiated by a hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]] to give the same signal strength as the actual source in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam.  The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna, while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna.  Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64, or 2.15 [[decibel]]s compared to an isotropic radiator, if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is \n:<math>\\mathrm{EIRP(W)} =  1.64 \\cdot \\mathrm{ERP(W)}</math>\nIf they are expressed in decibels\n:<math>\\mathrm{EIRP(dB)} = \\mathrm{ERP(dB)} + 2.15</math>\n\n== Definitions ==\nEffective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of maximum signal strength (the \"[[main lobe]]\") of its radiation pattern.<ref name=\"NAB\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Jones\n | first1 = Graham A.\n | last2  = Layer\n | first2 =  David H.\n | last3  = Osenkowsky\n | first3 = Thomas G.\n | title  = National Association of Broadcasters Engineering Handbook, 10th Ed.\n | publisher = Elsevier\n | date   = 2007\n | location = \n | pages  = 1632\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=K9N1TVhf82YC&pg=PA1632&dq=%22Effective+radiated+power%22+%22effective+isotropic+radiated+power%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1136034102\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Huang\n | first1 = Yi\n | last2  = Boyle\n | first2 = Kevin\n | title  = Antennas: From Theory to Practice\n | publisher = John Wiley and Sons \n | date   = 2008\n | location = \n | pages  = 117–118\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=MoI1T9fOxdIC&pg=PR13&dq=%22Effective+radiated+power%22+%22effective+isotropic+radiated+power%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0470772921\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Seybold\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Seybold\n | first1 = John S. \n | title  = Introduction to RF Propagation\n | publisher = John Wiley and Sons \n | date   = 2005\n | location = \n | pages  = 292\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Effective+radiated+power%22+%22effective+isotropic+radiated+power%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0471743682\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Weik\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Weik\n | first1 = Martin H. \n | title  = Communications Standard Dictionary\n | publisher = Springer Science and Business Media\n | date   = 2012\n | location = \n | pages  = 327\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=lv3xBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA327&dq=%22Effective+radiated+power%22+%22effective+isotropic+radiated+power%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 146156672X\n }}</ref>  This maximum radiated power is dependent on two factors: the total power output and the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna – how much of that power is radiated in the desired direction. The latter factor is quantified by the [[antenna gain]], which is the ratio of the signal strength radiated by an antenna to that radiated by a standard antenna.  For example, a 1,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4 (6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 (0 dBi).  So ERP and EIRP are measures of radiated power that can compare different combinations of transmitters and antennas on an equal basis.\n\nThe difference between ERP and EIRP is that antenna gain has traditionally been measured in two different units, comparing the antenna to two different standard antennas; an [[isotropic antenna]] and a [[half-wave dipole]] antenna:  \n*''Isotropic gain'' is the ratio of the power density <math>S_\\text{max}</math> (signal strength in watts per square meter) received at a point far from the antenna (in the [[far field]]) in the direction of its maximum radiation (main lobe), to the power <math>S_\\text{max,isotropic}</math> received at the same point from a hypothetical lossless [[isotropic antenna]], which radiates equal power in all directions \n::<math>\\mathrm{G}_\\text{i} = {S_\\text{max}  \\over S_\\text{max,isotropic}}</math>\n:Gain is often expressed in logarithmic units of [[decibel]]s (dB).  The decibel gain relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi) is given by\n::<math>\\mathrm{G}\\text{(dBi)} = 10\\log{S_\\text{max}  \\over S_\\text{max,isotropic}}</math>\n*''Dipole gain'' is the ratio of the power density received from the antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation to the power density <math>S_\\text{max,dipole}</math> received from a lossless [[half-wave dipole]] antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation\n::<math>\\mathrm{G}_\\text{d} = {S_\\text{max}  \\over S_\\text{max,dipole}}</math>\n:The decibel gain relative to a dipole (dBd) is given by\n::<math>\\mathrm{G}\\text{(dBd)} = 10\\log{S_\\text{max}  \\over S_\\text{max,dipole}}</math>\nIn contrast to an isotropic antenna, the dipole has a \"donut-shaped\" radiation pattern, its radiated power is maximum in directions perpendicular to the antenna, declining to zero on the antenna axis.  Since the radiation of the dipole is concentrated in horizontal directions,  the gain of a half-wave dipole is greater than that of an isotropic antenna.  The isotropic gain of a half-wave dipole is 1.64, or in decibels 10 log 1.64 = 2.15 dBi, so\n:<math>G_\\text{i} =  1.64G_\\text{d}</math> \nIn decibels\n:<math>G\\text{(dBi)} = G\\text{(dBd)} + 2.15</math>\n\nThe two measures EIRP and ERP are based on the two different standard antennas above:<ref name=\"NAB\" /><ref name=\"Seybold\" /><ref name=\"Huang\" /><ref name=\"Weik\" />\n*EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless [[isotropic antenna]]  to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the isotropic antenna gain\n::<math>\\mathrm{EIRP} = G_\\text{i} P_\\text{in}</math>\n:The ERP and EIRP are also often expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).  The input power in decibels is usually calculated with comparison to a reference level of one [[watt (unit)|watt]] (W): <math>P_\\text{in}\\mathrm{(dBw)} = 10 \\log P_\\text{in}</math>.  Since multiplication of two factors is equivalent to addition of their decibel values\n::<math>\\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} = G\\text{(dBi)} + P_\\text{in}\\mathrm{(dBw)}</math>\n\n*ERP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless [[half-wave dipole]] antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave dipole\n::<math>\\mathrm{ERP} = G_\\text{d} P_\\text{in}</math>\n:In decibels\n::<math>\\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} = G\\text{(dBd)} + P_\\text{in}\\mathrm{(dBw)}</math>\n\nSince the two definitions of gain only differ by a constant factor, so do ERP and EIRP\n:<math>\\mathrm{EIRP(W)} =  1.64 \\cdot \\mathrm{ERP(W)}</math> \nIn decibels\n:<math>\\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =\\mathrm{ERP}\\text{(dBw)} + 2.15</math>\n\n==Relation to transmitter output power==\nThe transmitter is usually connected to the antenna through a [[transmission line]]. Since the transmission line may have significant losses <math>L</math>, the power applied to the antenna is usually less than the output power of the transmitter <math>P_\\text{TX}</math>.  The relation of ERP and EIRP to transmitter output power is\n:<math>\\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =  P_\\text{TX}\\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\\mathrm{(dB)} +  G\\text{(dBi)}</math>\n:<math>\\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} =  P_\\text{TX}\\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\\mathrm{(dB)} +  G\\text{(dBi)} - 2.15</math>\nLosses in the antenna itself are included in the gain.\n\n== Dipole vs. isotropic radiators ==\nBecause ERP is calculated as antenna gain (in a given direction) as compared with the maximum directivity of a half-wave [[dipole antenna]], it creates a mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented in the direction of the receiver.  In other words, a notional receiver in a given direction from the transmitter would receive the same power if the source were replaced with an ideal dipole oriented with maximum directivity and matched [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] towards the receiver and with an antenna input power equal to the ERP.  The receiver would not be able to determine a difference.  Maximum directivity of an ideal half-wave dipole is a constant, i.e., 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi.  Therefore, ERP is always 2.15&nbsp;dB less than EIRP.  The ideal dipole antenna could be further replaced by an isotropic radiator (a purely mathematical device which cannot exist in the real world), and the receiver cannot know the difference so long as the input power is increased by 2.15&nbsp;dB.\n\nUnfortunately, the distinction between dBd and dBi is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used.  For example, a [[Yagi-Uda antenna]] is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create better energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole.  Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dBd, but listed only as dB.  Obviously this ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications.  A Yagi-Uda antenna's maximum directivity is 8.77 dBd = 10.92 dBi.  Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB.  Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dBd or dBi with ERP and EIRP.  Let us assume a 100-watt (20 dBW) transmitter with losses of 6&nbsp;dB prior to the antenna.  ERP < 22.77dBW and EIRP < 24.92dBW, both less than ideal by η in dB.  Assuming that the receiver is in the first side-lobe of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2&nbsp;dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to side-lobe of a Yagi-Uda.  Therefore, anywhere along the side-lobe direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi-Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Field and Wave Electromagnetics, 2nd Ed.|last=Cheng|first=David K.|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=648–650}}</ref>\n\n== Polarization ==\nPolarization has not been taken into account so far, but it must be properly clarified.  When considering the dipole radiator previously we assumed that it was perfectly aligned with the receiver.  Now assume, however, that the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, and there will be a minimum 3&nbsp;dB polarization loss regardless of antenna orientation.  If the receiver is also a dipole, it is possible to align it orthogonally to the transmitter such that theoretically zero energy is received.  However, this polarization loss is not accounted for in the calculation of ERP or EIRP.  Rather, the receiving system designer must account for this loss as appropriate.  For example, a cellular telephone tower has a fixed linear polarization, but the mobile handset must function well at any arbitrary orientation.  Therefore, a handset design might provide dual polarization receive on the handset so that captured energy is maximized regardless of orientation, or the designer might use a circularly polarized antenna and account for the extra 3&nbsp;dB of loss with amplification.\n\n== FM example ==\n[[Image:FM broadcasting antenna Willans Hill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Four bay crossed-dipole antenna of an FM broadcasting station. ]]\nFor example, an [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[radio station]] which [[advertise]]s that it has 100,000 [[watt]]s of power actually has 100,000 watts ERP, and ''not'' an actual 100,000-watt transmitter.  The [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) of such a station typically may be 10,000 to 20,000 watts, with a gain factor of 5 to 10 (5× to 10×, or 7 to 10 [[Decibel|dB]]).  In most antenna designs, gain is realized primarily by concentrating power toward the [[horizontal plane]] and suppressing it at upward and downward angles, through the use of [[phased array]]s of antenna elements.  The distribution of power versus [[elevation angle]] is known as the vertical pattern.  When an antenna is also directional horizontally, gain and ERP will vary with [[azimuth]] ([[compass]] direction).  Rather than the [[average]] power over all directions, it is the apparent power in the direction of the antenna's main lobe that is quoted as a station's ERP (this statement is just another way of stating the definition of ERP).  This is particularly applicable to the huge ERPs reported for [[shortwave]] broadcasting stations, which use very narrow [[beam width]]s to get their signals across [[continent]]s and [[ocean]]s.\n\n=== United States regulatory usage ===\nERP for FM radio in the United States is always relative to a theoretical [[Dipole antenna#Dipole as a reference standard|reference half-wave dipole]] antenna. (That is, when calculating ERP, the most direct approach is to work with antenna gain in dBd). To deal with antenna polarization, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) lists ERP in both the horizontal and vertical [[measurement]]s for FM and TV.  Horizontal is the standard for both, but if the vertical ERP is larger it will be used instead.\n\nThe maximum ERP for US FM broadcasting is usually 100,000 watts (FM Zone II) or 50,000 watts (in the generally more densely populated Zones I and I-A), though exact restrictions vary depending on the class of license and the [[Height above average terrain|antenna height above average terrain (HAAT)]].<ref>47 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 73.211</ref>  Some stations have been [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in or, very infrequently, been given a [[waiver]], and can exceed normal restrictions.\n\n== Microwave band issues ==\nFor most [[microwave]] systems, a completely non-directional [[isotropic antenna]] (one which [[Radiation|radiates]] equally and perfectly well in every direction &ndash; a physical impossibility) is used as a reference antenna, and then one speaks of [[EIRP]] (effective ''isotropic'' radiated power) rather than ERP.  This includes [[satellite]] [[transponder]]s, radar, and other systems which use microwave dishes and reflectors rather than dipole-style antennas.\n\n== Lower-frequency issues ==\nIn the case of [[medium wave]] (AM) stations in the [[United States]], power limits are set to the actual transmitter power output, and ERP is not used in normal calculations. Omnidirectional antennas used by a number of stations radiate the signal equally in all directions. Directional arrays are used to protect co- or adjacent channel stations, usually at night, but some run directionally 24 hours. While antenna efficiency and ground conductivity are taken into account when designing such an array, the FCC database shows the station's transmitter power output, not ERP.\n\n== Related terms ==\n'''Effective monopole radiated power''' (EMRP) may be used in Europe, particularly in relation to [[mediumwave]] broadcasting antennas.  This is the same as ERP, except that a short vertical antenna (i.e. a short [[Monopole antenna|monopole]]) is used as the reference antenna instead of a half-wave [[dipole]].\n\n== HAAT ==\n{{main article|Height above average terrain}}\nThe height above average terrain for VHF and higher frequencies is extremely important when considering ERP, as the signal coverage ([[broadcast range]]) produced by a given ERP dramatically increases with antenna height.  Because of this, it is possible for a station of only a few hundred watts ERP to cover more area than a station of a few thousand watts ERP, if its signal travels above obstructions on the ground.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nominal power]]\n* [[List of broadcast station classes]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Radio spectrum}}\n\n[[Category:ITU Radio Regulations]]\n[[Category:Antennas (radio)]]\n[[Category:Power (physics)]]\n[[Category:Broadcast engineering]]\n[[Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement]]"

It is also known as the '''focal ratio''', '''f-ratio''', or '''f-stop'''.<ref>Smith, Warren ''Modern Lens Design'' 2005 McGraw-Hill</ref> It is the reciprocal of the '''relative aperture'''.<ref>ISO, Photography—Apertures and related properties pertaining to photographic lenses—Designations and measurements, ISO 517:2008</ref> The f-number is commonly indicated using a [[Ƒ|hooked f]] with the format {{f/}}''N'', where ''N'' is the f-number.\n\n== Notation ==\n\nThe f-number ''N'' is given by:\n\n: <math>N = \\frac{f}{D} \\ </math>\n\nwhere <math>f</math> is the [[focal length]], and <math>D</math> is the diameter of the entrance pupil (''effective aperture'').  It is customary to write f-numbers preceded by {{f/}}, which forms a mathematical expression of the entrance pupil diameter in terms of <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:Trebuchet MS,Candara,Georgia,Calibri,Corbel,serif\">f</span> and {{mvar|N}}.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> For example, if a [[Lens (optics)|lens's]] focal length is 10&nbsp;mm and its entrance pupil diameter is 5&nbsp;mm, the f-number is 2, expressed by writing \"{{f/}}2\", and the aperture diameter is equal to <math>f/2</math>, where <math>f</math> is the focal length.\n\nIgnoring differences in light transmission efficiency, a lens with a greater f-number projects darker images.  The brightness of the projected image ([[illuminance]]) relative to the brightness of the scene in the lens's field of view ([[luminance]]) decreases with the square of the f-number. Doubling the f-number decreases the relative brightness by a factor of four.  To maintain the same [[Exposure (photography)|photographic exposure]] when doubling the f-number, the [[shutter speed|exposure time]] would need to be four times as long.\n\nMost lenses have an adjustable [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]], which changes the size of the [[aperture stop]] and thus the entrance pupil size. The entrance pupil diameter is not necessarily equal to the aperture stop diameter, because of the magnifying effect of lens elements in front of the aperture.\n\nA 100&nbsp;mm focal length {{f/}}4 lens  has an entrance pupil diameter of 25&nbsp;mm. A 200&nbsp;mm focal length {{f/}}4 lens has an entrance pupil diameter of 50&nbsp;mm. The 200&nbsp;mm lens's entrance pupil has four times the area of the 100&nbsp;mm lens's entrance pupil, and thus collects four times as much light from each object in the lens's field of view.  But compared to the 100&nbsp;mm lens, the 200&nbsp;mm lens projects an image of each object twice as high and twice as wide, covering four times the area, and so both lenses produce the same illuminance at the focal plane when imaging a scene of a given luminance.\n\nA [[F-number#T-stop|T-stop]] is an f-number adjusted to account for light transmission efficiency.\n\n== Stops, f-stop conventions, and exposure ==\n[[Image:Canon 7 with 50mm f0.95 IMG 0374.JPG|thumb|A [[Canon 7]] mounted with a 50&nbsp;mm lens capable of {{f/}}0.95]]\n[[Image:lens aperture side.jpg|thumb|A 35&nbsp;mm lens set to {{f/}}11, as indicated by the white dot above the f-stop scale on the aperture ring. This lens has an aperture range of {{f/}}2.0 to {{f/}}22.]]\n\nThe word ''stop'' is sometimes confusing due to its multiple meanings. A stop can be a physical object: an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays. The ''[[aperture stop]]'' is the aperture setting that limits the brightness of the image by restricting the input pupil size, while a ''field stop'' is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.\n\nIn photography, stops are also a ''unit'' used to quantify ratios of light or exposure, with each added stop meaning a factor of two, and each subtracted stop meaning a factor of one-half. The one-stop unit is also known as the EV ([[exposure value]]) unit. On a camera, the aperture setting is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps, known as '''''f-stops'''''. Each \"'''stop'''\" is marked with its corresponding f-number, and represents a halving of the light intensity from the previous stop. This corresponds to a decrease of the pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of <math>\\scriptstyle 1/\\sqrt{2}</math> or about 0.7071, and hence a halving of the area of the pupil.\n\nMost modern lenses use a standard f-stop scale, which is an approximately [[geometric sequence]] of numbers that corresponds to the sequence of the [[exponentiation|powers]] of the [[square root of 2]]:  &nbsp; {{f/}}1, {{f/}}1.4, {{f/}}2, {{f/}}2.8, {{f/}}4, {{f/}}5.6, {{f/}}8, {{f/}}11, {{f/}}16, {{f/}}22, {{f/}}32, {{f/}}45, {{f/}}64, {{f/}}90, {{f/}}128, etc. Each element in the sequence is one stop lower than the element to its left, and one stop higher than the element to its right.  The values of the ratios are rounded off to these particular conventional numbers, to make them easier to remember and write down.\nThe sequence above is obtained by approximating the following exact geometric sequence:\n\n: {{tmath|1=f/1 = \\frac{f}{(\\sqrt{2})^0},\\  f/1.4 = \\frac{f}{(\\sqrt{2})^1},\\ f/2 = \\frac{f}{(\\sqrt{2})^2},\\ f/2.8 = \\frac{f}{(\\sqrt{2})^3}\\  \\cdots}}\nIn the same way as one f-stop corresponds to a factor of two in light intensity, [[shutter speed]]s are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of ''[[Reciprocity (photography)|reciprocity]]''. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have [[reciprocity failure]]. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.\n\nPhotographers sometimes express other [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] ratios in terms of 'stops'. Ignoring the f-number markings, the f-stops make a [[logarithmic scale]] of exposure intensity. Given this interpretation, one can then think of taking a half-step along this scale, to make an exposure difference of \"half a stop\".\n\n=== Fractional stops ===\n{{multiple image\n | width = 120\n | image1 = Povray focal blur animation.gif\n | alt1 = Changing a camera's aperture in half-stops\n | image2 = Povray focal blur animation mode tan.gif\n | alt2 = Changing a camera's aperture from zero to infinity\n | footer = Computer simulation showing the effects of changing a camera's aperture in half-stops (at left) and from zero to infinity (at right)\n}}\n\nMost twentieth-century cameras had a continuously variable aperture, using an [[iris diaphragm]], with each full stop marked. Click-stopped aperture came into common use in the 1960s; the aperture scale usually had a click stop at every whole and half stop.\n\nOn modern cameras, especially when aperture is set on the camera body, f-number is often divided more finely than steps of one stop. Steps of one-third stop ({{1/3}} EV) are the most common, since this matches the ISO system of [[film speed]]s. Half-stop steps are used on some cameras. Usually the full stops are marked, and the intermediate positions are clicked. As an example, the aperture that is one-third stop smaller than {{f/}}2.8 is {{f/}}3.2, two-thirds smaller is {{f/}}3.5, and one whole stop smaller is {{f/}}4. The next few f-stops in this sequence are:\n\n: {{f/}}4.5, {{f/}}5, {{f/}}5.6, {{f/}}6.3, {{f/}}7.1, {{f/}}8, etc.\n\nTo calculate the steps in a full stop (1 EV) one could use\n: 2<sup>0×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>1×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>2×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>3×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>4×0.5</sup> etc.\n\nThe steps in a half stop ({{1/2}} EV) series would be\n: 2<sup>0/2×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>1/2×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>2/2×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>3/2×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>4/2×0.5</sup> etc.\n\nThe steps in a third stop ({{1/3}} EV) series would be\n: 2<sup>0/3×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>1/3×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>2/3×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>3/3×0.5</sup>, 2<sup>4/3×0.5</sup> etc.\n\nAs in the earlier DIN and ASA film-speed standards, the ISO speed is defined only in one-third stop increments, and shutter speeds of digital cameras are commonly on the same scale in reciprocal seconds. A portion of the ISO range is the sequence\n: ... 16/13°, 20/14°, 25/15°, 32/16°, 40/17°, 50/18°, 64/19°, 80/20°, 100/21°, 125/22°...\nwhile shutter speeds in reciprocal seconds have a few conventional differences in their numbers ({{frac|15}}, {{frac|30}}, and {{frac|60}} second instead of {{frac|16}}, {{frac|32}}, and {{frac|64}}).\n\nIn practice the maximum aperture of a lens is often not an [[integer|integral]] power of {{sqrt|2}} (i.e., {{sqrt|2}} to the power of a whole number), in which case it is usually a half or third stop above or below an integral power of {{sqrt|2}}.\n\nModern electronically controlled interchangeable lenses, such as those used for SLR cameras, have f-stops specified internally in {{frac|8}}-stop increments, so the cameras' {{1/3}}-stop settings are approximated by the nearest {{frac|8}}-stop setting in the lens.\n\n==== Standard full-stop f-number scale ====\nIncluding [[APEX system|aperture value]] AV:\n:<math>N = \\sqrt{2^{AV}}</math>\n\nConventional and calculated f-numbers, full-stop series:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!AV\n| −2 || −1 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#CCFFCD\"\n!''N''\n| 0.5 || 0.7 || 1.0 || 1.4 || 2 || 2.8 || 4 || 5.6 || 8 || 11 || 16 || 22 || 32 || 45 || 64 || 90 || 128 || 180 || 256\n|-\n!calculated\n| 0.5 || 0.707… || 1.0 || 1.414… || 2.0 || 2.828… || 4.0 || 5.657… || 8.0 || 11.31… || 16.0 || 22.62… || 32.0 || 45.25… || 64.0 || 90.51… || 128.0 || 181.02… || 256.0\n|}\n\n==== Typical one-half-stop f-number scale ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!AV\n| −1 || −0.5 || 0 || 0.5 || 1 || 1.5 || 2 || 2.5 || 3 || 3.5 || 4 || 4.5 || 5 || 5.5 || 6 || 6.5 || 7 || 7.5 || 8 || 8.5 || 9 || 9.5 || 10 || 10.5 || 11 || 11.5 || 12 || 12.5 || 13 || 13.5 || 14\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"\n!''N''\n|style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 0.7 || 0.8 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 1.0 || 1.2 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 1.4 || 1.7 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 2 || 2.4 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 2.8 || 3.3 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 4 || 4.8 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 5.6 || 6.7 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 8 || 9.5 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 11 || 13 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 16 || 19 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 22 || 27 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 32 || 38 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 45 || 54 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 64 || 76 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 90 || 107 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 128\n|}\n\n==== Typical one-third-stop f-number scale ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!AV\n| −1 || −0.7 || −0.3 || 0 || 0.3 || 0.7 || 1 || 1.3 || 1.7 || 2 || 2.3 || 2.7 || 3 || 3.3 || 3.7 || 4 || 4.3 || 4.7 || 5 || 5.3 || 5.7 || 6 || 6.3 || 6.7 || 7 || 7.3 || 7.7 || 8 || 8.3 || 8.7 || 9 || 9.3 || 9.7 || 10 || 10.3 || 10.7 || 11 || 11.3 || 11.7 || 12 || 12.3 || 12.7 || 13\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#e5d1cb\"\n!''N''\n|style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 0.7 || 0.8 || 0.9 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 1.0 || 1.1 || 1.2 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 1.4 || 1.6 || 1.8 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 2 || 2.2 || 2.5 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 2.8 || 3.2 || 3.5 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 4 || 4.5 || 5.0 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 5.6 || 6.3 || 7.1 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 8 || 9 || 10 || style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"|11 || 13 || 14 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 16 || 18 || 20 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 22 || 25 || 29 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 32 || 36 || 40 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 45 || 51 || 57 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 64 || 72 || 80 ||style=\"background:#CCFFCC;\"| 90\n|}\n\nSometimes the same number is included on several scales; for example, an aperture of {{f/}}1.2 may be used in either a half-stop<ref>\n{{cite book\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YjAzP4i1oFcC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136\n | title = Set lighting technician's handbook: film lighting equipment, practice, and electrical distribution\n | author = Harry C.

Cinema camera lenses are typically calibrated in T-stops instead of f-numbers.<ref name=KMPCF/> In still photography, without the need for rigorous consistency of all lenses and cameras used, slight differences in exposure are less important; however, T-stops are still used in some kinds of special-purpose lenses such as [[Smooth Trans Focus]] lenses by [[Minolta]] and [[Sony]].\n\n=== Sunny 16 rule ===\nAn example of the use of f-numbers in photography is the ''[[sunny 16 rule]]'': an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day by using an aperture of {{f/}}16 and the shutter speed closest to the reciprocal of the ISO speed of the film; for example, using ISO 200 film, an aperture of {{f/}}16 and a shutter speed of {{frac|200}} second. The f-number may then be adjusted downwards for situations with lower light. Selecting a lower f-number is \"opening up\" the lens. Selecting a higher f-number is \"closing\" or \"stopping down\" the lens.\n\n== Effects on image sharpness ==\n[[Image:Jonquil flowers merged.jpg|thumb|400px|Comparison of {{f/}}32 (top-left corner) and {{f/}}5 (bottom-right corner)]]\n[[File:Blumen im Sommer.jpg|thumb|400px|Shallow focus with a wide open lens]]\n\n[[Depth of field]] increases with f-number, as illustrated in the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, with the rest of the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for [[nature photography]] and [[portrait photography|portraiture]] because background blur (the aesthetic quality known as '[[bokeh]]') can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The [[depth of field]] of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the [[focal length]], the subject distance, and the [[film format|format]] of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, subject distance, and [[entrance pupil]] diameter (as in [[Moritz von Rohr|von Rohr's method]]). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same [[angle of view]] since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers  (and thus potentially more difficult or complex optics) when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.\n\nImage sharpness is related to f/number through two different optical effects: [[Optical aberration|aberration]], due to imperfect lens design,  and [[diffraction]] which is due to the wave nature of light.<ref>{{cite book | title = Basic Photography | author = Michael John Langford | isbn = 0-240-51592-7 | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Focal Press]]}}</ref> The blur-optimal f-stop varies with the lens design. For modern standard lenses having 6 or 7 elements, the [[sharpness (visual)|sharpest]] image is often obtained around {{f/}}5.6–{{f/}}8, while for older standard lenses having only 4 elements ([[Zeiss Tessar|Tessar formula]]) stopping to {{f/}}11 will give the sharpest image{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. Even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses, [[diffraction]] creates some spreading of the rays causing defocus. To offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible (not the f/ number itself).\n\nLight falloff is also sensitive to f-stop. Many wide-angle lenses will show a significant light falloff ([[vignetting]]) at the edges for large apertures.\n\n[[Photojournalist]]s have a saying, \"[[f/8 and be there|{{f/}}8 and be there]]\", meaning that being on the scene is more important than worrying about technical details. Practically, {{f/}}8 allows adequate depth of field and sufficient lens speed for a decent base exposure in most daylight situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Michael|title=Selecting and Using Classic Cameras: A User's Guide to Evaluating Features, Condition & Usability of Classic Cameras|publisher=Amherst Media, Inc|year=2001|page=163|isbn=978-1-58428-054-5}}</ref>\n\n== Human eye ==\nComputing the f-number of the [[human eye]] involves computing the physical aperture and focal length of the eye. The pupil can be as large as 6–7&nbsp;mm wide open, which translates into the maximal physical aperture.\n\nThe f-number of the human eye varies from about {{f/}}8.3 in a very brightly lit place to about {{f/}}2.1 in the dark.<ref>{{cite book | first=Eugene|last=Hecht|year=1987|title=Optics|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Addison Wesley]]|isbn=0-201-11609-X}} Sect. 5.7.1</ref> Note that computing the focal length requires that the light-refracting properties of the liquids in the eye are taken into account. Treating the eye as an ordinary air-filled camera and lens results in a different focal length, thus yielding an incorrect f-number.\n\nToxic substances and [[poison]]s (like [[atropine]]) can significantly reduce the range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. [[Tropicamide]] and [[phenylephrine]] are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. Atropine is also used in such a way but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces [[cycloplegia]] (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1&nbsp;mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain [[glaucoma]] patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.\n\n== {{anchor|Focal ratio}}Focal ratio in telescopes ==\n[[Image:Focal ratio.svg|right|thumb|250px|Diagram of the [[focal ratio]] of a simple optical system where <math>f</math> is the [[focal length]] and <math>D</math> is the diameter of the [[Objective (optics)|objective]].]]\n\nIn astronomy, the f-number is commonly referred to as the ''focal ratio'' (or ''f-ratio'') notated as <math>N</math>. It is still defined as the [[focal length]] <math>f</math> of an [[Objective (optics)|objective]] divided by its diameter <math>D</math> or by the diameter of an [[aperture]] stop in the system:\n\n: <math>N = \\frac fD \\quad \\xrightarrow {\\times D} \\quad f = ND</math>\n\nEven though the principles of focal ratio are always the same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In [[photography]] the focal ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as [[depth of field]]. When using an [[optical telescope]] in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) is a function of absolute aperture area only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the [[Field of view#Astronomy|field of view]] of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an [[eyepiece]], film plate, or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]].\n\nFor example, the [[Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope|SOAR]] 4-meter telescope has a small field of view (~{{f/|16}}) which is useful for stellar studies. The [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]] 8.4&nbsp;m telescope, which will cover the entire sky every three days has a very large field of view. Its short 10.3&nbsp;m focal length ({{f/|1.2}}) is made possible by an error correction system which includes secondary and tertiary mirrors, a three element refractive system and active mounting and optics.<ref name=RefDesign>{{Cite journal |title=LSST Reference Design |publisher=LSST Corporation |author1=Charles F.

'''FG01''' | isbn=0-8194-5294-7 }} p. 29.</ref> This limitation is typically ignored in photography, where f-number is often used regardless of the distance to the object. In [[optical design]], an alternative is often needed for systems where the object is not far from the lens. In these cases the '''working f-number''' is used. The working f-number ''N<sub>w</sub>'' is given by:<ref name=\"Greivenkamp\"/>\n\n: <math>N_w \\approx {1 \\over 2 \\mathrm{NA}_i} \\approx \\left(1+\\frac{|m|}{P}\\right)N</math>,\n\nwhere ''N'' is the uncorrected f-number, NA<sub>''i''</sub> is the image-space [[numerical aperture]] of the lens, <math>|m|</math> is the [[absolute value]] of the lens's [[magnification]] for an object a particular distance away, and ''P'' is the [[pupil magnification]]. Since the pupil magnification is seldom known it is often assumed to be 1, which is the correct value for all symmetric lenses.\n\nIn photography this means that as one focuses closer, the lens' effective aperture becomes smaller, making the exposure darker. The working f-number is often described in photography as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a [[bellows factor]]. This is of particular importance in [[macro photography]].\n\n== History ==\nThe system of f-numbers for specifying relative apertures evolved in the late nineteenth century, in competition with several other systems of aperture notation.\n\n=== Origins of relative aperture ===\nIn 1867, Sutton and Dawson defined \"apertal ratio\" as essentially the reciprocal of the modern f-number.  In the following quote, an \"apertal ratio\" of \"{{frac|24}}\" is calculated as the ratio of {{convert|6|in|mm}} to {{convert|1/4|in|mm}}, corresponding to an {{f/|24}} f-stop:\n\n<blockquote>In every lens there is, corresponding to a given apertal ratio (that is, the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6 inch focus, with a {{1/4}} in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a fixed star, for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range' of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms 'apertal ratio' and 'focal range' have not come into general use, but it is very desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.<ref name=\"Sutton\">Thomas Sutton and George Dawson, ''A Dictionary of Photography'', London: Sampson Low, Son & Marston, 1867, (p. 122).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1874, [[John Henry Dallmeyer]] called the ratio <math>1/N</math> the \"intensity ratio\" of a lens:\n\n<blockquote>The ''rapidity'' of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus. To ascertain this, divide the ''equivalent focus'' by the diameter of the actual ''working aperture'' of the lens in question; and note down the quotient as the denominator with 1, or unity, for the numerator. Thus to find the ratio of a lens of 2 inches diameter and 6 inches focus, divide the focus by the aperture, or 6 divided by 2 equals 3; i.e., {{1/3}} is the intensity ratio.<ref name=\"Dallmeyer\">John Henry Dallmeyer, ''Photographic Lenses: On Their Choice and Use – Special Edition Edited for American Photographers'', pamphlet, 1874.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough he did not yet have access to [[Ernst Abbe]]'s theory of stops and pupils,<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-r6LPy-nWPwC&pg=RA3-PA537&dq=theory-of-stops | title = The principles and methods of geometrical optics: Especially as applied to the theory of optical instruments | author1 = Southall | first1 = James Powell Cocke | year = 1910}}</ref> which was made widely available by [[Siegfried Czapski]] in 1893,<ref name=\"Czapski\">Siegfried Czapski, ''Theorie der optischen Instrumente, nach Abbe,'' Breslau: Trewendt, 1893.</ref> Dallmeyer knew that his ''working aperture'' was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop:\n\n<blockquote>It must be observed, however, that in order to find the real ''intensity ratio'', the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted ''between'' the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.<ref name=\"Dallmeyer\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis point is further emphasized by Czapski in 1893.<ref name=\"Czapski\"/>  According to an English review of his book, in 1894, \"The necessity of clearly distinguishing between effective aperture and diameter of physical stop is strongly insisted upon.\"<ref>Henry Crew, \"Theory of Optical Instruments by Dr. Czapski,\" in ''Astronomy and Astro-physics'' XIII pp. 241–243, 1894.</ref>\n\nJ. H. Dallmeyer's son, [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer]], inventor of the telephoto lens, followed the ''intensity ratio'' terminology in 1899.<ref>Thomas R. Dallmeyer, ''Telephotography: An elementary treatise on the construction and application of the telephotographic lens'', London: Heinemann, 1899.</ref>\n\n=== Aperture numbering systems ===\n[[File:No1-A Autographic Kodak Jr.jpg|thumb | right | A 1922 Kodak with aperture marked in U.S. stops.  An f-number conversion chart has been added by the user.]]\n\nAt the same time, there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture, rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio. But these systems all involved some arbitrary constant, as opposed to the simple ratio of focal length and diameter.\n\nFor example, the ''Uniform System'' (U.S.) of apertures was adopted as a standard by the [[Royal Photographic Society|Photographic Society of Great Britain]] in the 1880s. Bothamley in 1891 said \"The stops of all the best makers are now arranged according to this system.\"<ref>C. H. Bothamley, ''Ilford Manual of Photography'', London: Britannia Works Co. Ltd., 1891.</ref>  U.S. 16 is the same aperture as {{f/}}16, but apertures that are larger or smaller by a full stop use doubling or halving of the U.S. number, for example {{f/}}11 is U.S. 8 and {{f/}}8 is U.S. 4. The exposure time required is directly proportional to the U.S. number.  [[Eastman Kodak]] used U.S. stops on many of their cameras at least in the 1920s.\n\nBy 1895, Hodges contradicts Bothamley, saying that the f-number system has taken over: \"This is called the {{f/}}''x'' system, and the diaphragms of all modern lenses of good construction are so marked.\"<ref>John A. Hodges, ''Photographic Lenses: How to Choose, and How to Use'', Bradford: Percy Lund & Co., 1895.</ref>\n\nHere is the situation as seen in 1899:\n[[File:Diaphragm Numbers.gif|center|823 px]]\n\nPiper in 1901<ref>C. Welborne Piper, ''A First Book of the Lens: An Elementary Treatise on the Action and Use of the Photographic Lens'', London: Hazell, Watson, and Viney, Ltd., 1901.</ref> discusses five different systems of aperture marking: the old and new [[Carl Zeiss|Zeiss]] systems based on actual intensity (proportional to reciprocal square of the f-number); and the U.S., C.I., and Dallmeyer systems based on exposure (proportional to square of the f-number). He calls the f-number the \"ratio number,\" \"aperture ratio number,\" and \"ratio aperture.\"  He calls expressions like {{f/}}8 the \"fractional diameter\" of the aperture, even though it is literally equal to the \"absolute diameter\" which he distinguishes as a different term. He also sometimes uses expressions like \"an aperture of f 8\" without the division indicated by the slash.\n\nBeck and Andrews in 1902 talk about the Royal Photographic Society standard of {{f/}}4, {{f/}}5.6, {{f/}}8, {{f/}}11.3, etc.<ref>Conrad Beck and Herbert Andrews, ''Photographic Lenses: A Simple Treatise'', second edition, London: R. & J. Beck Ltd., c. 1902.</ref> The R.P.S. had changed their name and moved off of the U.S. system some time between 1895 and 1902.\n\n=== Typographical standardization ===\n[[File:Yashica-D front.jpg|thumb|[[Yashica#TLRs|Yashica-D TLR]] camera front view.  This is one of the few cameras that actually says \"F-NUMBER\" on it.]]\n[[File:Yashica-D top.jpg|thumb|From the top, the Yashica-D's aperture setting window uses the \"f:\" notation. The aperture is continuously variable with no \"stops\".]]\n\nBy 1920, the term ''f-number'' appeared in books both as ''F number'' and ''f/number''. In modern publications, the forms ''f-number'' and ''f number'' are more common, though the earlier forms, as well as ''F-number'' are still found in a few books; not uncommonly, the initial lower-case ''f'' in ''f-number'' or ''f/number'' is set in a hooked italic form: <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:Trebuchet MS,Candara,Calibri,Corbel,serif\">f</span>, or <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:Georgia,serif\">f</span>.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=lens+aperture&num=50&as_epq=f-number Google search]</ref>\n\nNotations for f-numbers were also quite variable in the early part of the twentieth century.

One ban or hartley is the information content of an event if the [[probability]] of that event occurring is {{frac|1|10}}.<ref name=\"IEC\"/> It is therefore equal to the information contained in one [[decimal digit]] (or dit), assuming ''[[A priori probability|a priori]]'' equiprobability of each possible value.\n\nAs a [[bit]] corresponds to a [[binary digit]], a ban corresponds to a [[decimal digit]].  A '''deciban''' is one tenth of a ban; the name is formed from ''ban'' by the [[SI prefix]] ''[[deci-]]''.\n\nOne hartley corresponds to log<sub>2</sub>(10) [[bit]] = ln(10) [[Nat (unit)|nat]], or approximately 3.322 [[shannon (unit)|Sh]],{{efn|This value, approximately {{frac|10|3}}, but slightly less, can be understood simply because <math>10^3 = 1,000 \\lesssim 1,024 = 2^{10}</math>: 3 decimal digits are slightly ''less'' information than 10 binary digits, so 1 decimal digit is slightly ''less'' than {{frac|10|3}} binary digits.}} or 2.303 [[nat (unit)|nat]]. A deciban is about 0.332 Sh.\n\nThough not an [[SI unit]], the hartley is part of the [[International System of Quantities]], defined by International Standard [[IEC 80000-13]] of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].  It is named after [[Ralph Hartley]].\n\n== History ==\nThe term ''hartley'' is named after [[Ralph Hartley]], who suggested in 1928 to measure information using a logarithmic base equal to the number of distinguishable states in its representation, which would be the base 10 for a decimal digit.<ref name=\"Hartley_1928\"/><ref name=\"Reza_1994\"/>\n\nThe ''ban'' and the ''deciban'' were invented by [[Alan Turing]] with [[I. J. Good]] in 1940, to measure the amount of information that could be deduced by the codebreakers at [[Bletchley Park]] using the [[Banburismus]] procedure, towards determining each day's unknown setting of the German naval [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine.  The name was inspired by the enormous sheets of card, printed in the town of [[Banbury]] about 30 miles away, that were used in the process.<ref name=\"Good_1979\"/>\n\n[[I. J. Good|Jack Good]] argued that the sequential summation of ''decibans'' to build up a measure of the weight of evidence in favour of a hypothesis, is essentially [[Bayesian inference]].<ref name=\"Good_1979\"/> [[Donald A. Gillies]], however, argued the ''ban'' is, in effect, the same as [[Karl Popper|Karl Popper's]] measure of the severity of a test.<ref name=\"Gillies_1990\"/>\n\n==Usage as a unit of odds==\nThe deciban is a particularly useful unit for [[log-odds]], notably as a measure of information in [[Bayes factor]]s, [[odds ratio]]s (ratio of odds, so log is difference of log-odds), or [[weight of evidence|weights of evidence]]. 10 decibans corresponds to odds of 10:1; 20 decibans to 100:1 odds, etc. According to [[I. J. Good]], a change in a weight of evidence of 1 deciban (i.e., a change in the odds from evens to about 5:4) is about as finely as humans can reasonably be expected to quantify their degree of belief in a hypothesis.<ref name=\"Good_1985\"/>\n\nOdds corresponding to integer decibans can often be well-approximated by simple integer ratios; these are collated below.

[[Monomial]]s – relationships of the form <math>y=ax^k</math> – appear as straight lines in a log–log graph, with the power term corresponding to the slope, and the constant term corresponding to the intercept of the line. Thus these graphs are very useful for recognizing these relationships and [[estimating parameters]]. Any base can be used for the logarithm, though most common are 10, [[e (mathematical constant)|e]], and&nbsp;2.\n\n==Relation with monomials==\nGiven a monomial equation <math>y=ax^k,</math> taking the logarithm of the equation (with any base) yields:\n:<math>\\log y = k \\log x + \\log a.</math>\nSetting <math>X = \\log x</math> and <math>Y = \\log y,</math> which corresponds to using a log–log graph, yields the equation:\n:<math>Y = mX + b</math>\nwhere ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k'' is the slope of the line ([[Grade (slope)|gradient]]) and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;log&nbsp;''a'' is the intercept on the (log&nbsp;''y'')-axis, meaning where log&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, so, reversing the logs, ''a'' is the ''y'' value corresponding to ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.<ref>[http://www.intmath.com/Exponential-logarithmic-functions/7_Graphs-log-semilog.php M. Bourne ''Graphs on Logarithmic and Semi-Logarithmic Paper'' (www.intmath.com)]</ref>\n\n== Equations ==\n\nThe equation for a line on a log–log scale would be:\n\n:<math> \\log_{10}F(x) = m \\log_{10}x + b, </math>\n:<math> F(x) = x^m\\cdot10^b, </math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the slope and ''b'' is the intercept point on the log plot.\n\n===Slope of a log–log plot===\n\n[[Image:Slope of log-log plot.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Finding the slope of a log–log plot using ratios]]\nTo find the slope of the plot, two points are selected on the ''x''-axis, say ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>.  Using the above equation:\n\n:<math> \\log[F (x_1)] = m \\log (x_1) + b, \\, </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\mathrm {log}[F (x_2)] = m \\log (x_2) + b. \\, </math>\n\nThe slope ''m'' is found taking the difference:\n\n:<math> m = \\frac { \\mathrm {log} (F_2) - \\mathrm {log} (F_1)} { \\log(x_2) - \\log(x_1) } = \\frac {\\log (F_2/F_1)}{\\log(x_2/x_1)}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere ''F''<sub>1</sub> is shorthand for ''F'' ( ''x''<sub>1</sub> ) and ''F''<sub>2</sub> is shorthand for ''F'' ( ''x''<sub>2</sub> ). The figure at right illustrates the formula. Notice that the slope in the example of the figure is ''negative''. The formula also provides a negative slope, as can be seen from the following property of the logarithm:\n\n:<math> \\log(x_1/x_2) = -\\log(x_2/x_1). \\, </math>\n\n===Finding the function from the log–log plot===\n\nThe above procedure now is reversed to find the form of the function ''F''(''x'') using its (assumed) known log–log plot. To find the function ''F'',  pick some ''fixed point'' (''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''F''<sub>0</sub>), where ''F''<sub>0</sub> is shorthand for ''F''(''x''<sub>0</sub>), somewhere on the straight line in the above graph, and further some other ''arbitrary point'' (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''F''<sub>1</sub>) on the same graph.  Then from the slope formula above:\n\n::<math> m = \\frac {\\log (F_1 / F_0)}{\\log(x_1 / x_0)} </math>\n\nwhich leads to\n\n::<math> \\log(F_1 / F_0) = m \\log(x_1 / x_0) = \\log[(x_1 / x_0)^m ]. \\, </math>\n\nNotice that 10<sup>log<sub>10</sub>(''F''<sub>1</sub>)</sup> = ''F''<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, the logs can be inverted to find:\n\n: <math> \\frac{F_1}{F_0} = \\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_0}\\right)^m </math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>F_1 = \\frac{F_0}{x_0^m} \\,\\, x^m, \\, </math>\n\nwhich means that\n\n: <math> F(x) = \\mathrm{constant}\\cdot x^m. </math>\n\nIn other words, ''F'' is proportional to ''x'' to the power of the slope of the straight line of its log–log graph. Specifically, a straight line on a log–log plot containing points (''F''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>) and (''F''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>) will have the function:\n:<math> F(x) = {F_0}\\left(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\right)^\\frac {\\log (F_1/F_0)}{\\log(x_1/x_0)}, </math>\n\nOf course, the inverse is true too: any function of the form\n\n:<math> F(x) = \\mathrm{constant} \\cdot x^m</math>\n\nwill have a straight line as its log–log graph representation, where the slope of the line is&nbsp;''m''.\n\n===Finding the area under a straight-line segment of log–log plot===\n\nTo calculate the area under a continuous, straight-line segment of a log–log plot (or estimating an area of an almost-straight line), take the function defined previously\n\n: <math> F(x) = \\mathrm{constant}\\cdot x^m. </math>\n\nand integrate it.  Since it is only operating on a definite integral (two defined endpoints), the area A under the plot takes the form\n\n: <math> A(x) = \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} F(x) \\, dx = \\frac{\\mathrm{constant}}{m+1}\\cdot x^{m+1}: [x_0,x_1] </math>\n\nRearranging the original equation and plugging in the fixed point values, it is found that\n\n: <math> \\mathrm{constant} = \\frac{F_0}{x_0^m} </math>\n\nSubstituting back into the integral, you find that for A over x<sub>0</sub> to x<sub>1</sub>\n\n: <math> A = \\frac{F_0/x_0^m}{m+1}\\cdot (x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1}) </math>\n\n: <math> \\log A = \\log \\left[\\frac{F_0 / x_0^m}{m+1}\\cdot (x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1})\\right] = \\log \\frac{F_0}{m+1} - \\log \\frac{1}{x_0^m} + \\log (x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1}) </math>\n\n: <math> \\log A = \\log \\frac{F_0}{m+1} + \\log \\left(\\frac{x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1}}{x_0^m}\\right) = \\log \\frac{F_0}{m+1} + \\log \\left(\\frac{x_1^m}{x_0^m}\\cdot x_1 - \\frac{x_0^{m+1}}{x_0^m}\\right) </math>\n\nTherefore: <math> A = \\frac{F_0}{m+1} \\cdot \\left[x_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac {x_1}{x_0}\\right)^m - x_0\\right] </math>\n\nFor ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;−1, the integral becomes <math> A_{(m=-1)} = \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} F(x) = \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\frac {\\mathrm{constant}}{x} = \\frac{F_0}{x_0^{-1}} \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\frac {1}{x} = F_0 \\cdot x_0 \\cdot \\ln x: [x_0,x_1] </math>\n\n: <math> A_{(m=-1)} = F_0 \\cdot x_0 \\cdot \\ln \\frac{x_1}{x_0}</math>\n\n== Applications ==\nThese graphs are useful when the parameters ''a'' and ''b'' need to be estimated from numerical data. Specifications such as this are used frequently in [[economics]].\n\nOne example is the estimation of [[money demand]] functions based on [[Money demand#Inventory theory|inventory theory]], in which it can be assumed that money demand at time ''t'' is given by\n\n:<math>M_t = AR_t^bY_t^cU_t,</math>\n\nwhere ''M'' is the real quantity of [[money]] held by the public, ''R'' is the [[rate of return]] on an alternative, higher yielding asset in excess of that on money, ''Y'' is the public's [[real income]], ''U'' is an error term assumed to be [[lognormal distribution|lognormally distributed]], ''A'' is a scale parameter to be estimated, and ''b'' and ''c'' are [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] parameters to be estimated. Taking logs yields\n\n:<math>m_t = a + br_t + cy_t + u_t,</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' = log ''M'', ''a'' = log ''A'', ''r'' = log ''R'', ''y'' = log ''Y'', and ''u'' = log ''U'' with ''u'' being [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. This equation can be estimated using [[ordinary least squares]].\n\nAnother economic example is the estimation of a firm's [[Cobb–Douglas production function]], which is the right side of the equation\n\n:<math>Q_t=AN_t^{\\alpha}K_t^{\\beta}U_t,</math>\n\nin which ''Q'' is the quantity of output that can be produced per month, ''N'' is the number of hours of labor employed in production per month, ''K'' is the number of hours of physical capital utilized per month, ''U'' is an error term assumed to be lognormally distributed, and ''A'', <math>\\alpha</math>, and <math>\\beta</math> are parameters to be estimated. Taking logs gives the linear regression equation\n\n:<math>q_t = a + \\alpha n_t + \\beta k_t + u_t</math>\n\nwhere ''q'' = log ''Q'', ''a'' = log ''A'', ''n'' = log ''N'', ''k'' = log ''K'', and ''u'' = log ''U''.\n\nLog–log regression can also be used to estimate the [[fractal dimension]] of a naturally occurring [[fractal]].\n\nHowever, going in the other direction – observing that data appears as an approximate line on a log–log scale and concluding that the data follows a power law – is invalid.<ref name=clauset>{{cite journal|author1=Clauset, A. |author2=Shalizi, C.

While simple log–log plots may be instructive in detecting possible power laws, and have been used dating back to [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] in the 1890s, validation as a power laws requires more sophisticated statistics.<ref name=clauset/>\n\nThese graphs are also extremely useful when data are gathered by varying the control variable along an exponential function, in which case the control variable ''x'' is more naturally represented on a log scale, so that the data points are evenly spaced, rather than compressed at the low end. The output variable ''y'' can either be represented linearly, yielding a [[lin–log graph]] (log&nbsp;''x'', ''y''), or its logarithm can also be taken, yielding the log–log graph (log&nbsp;''x'', log&nbsp;''y'').\n\n[[Bode plot]] (a [[plot (graphics)|graph]] of the [[frequency response]] of a system) is also log-log plot.\n\n== See also  ==\n*[[Semi-log plot]] (lin-log or log-lin)\n*[[Multiplicative calculus]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/nonnewtoniancalculus/ Non-Newtonian calculus website]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Log-Log Graph}}\n[[Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement]]\n[[Category:Statistical charts and diagrams]]\n[[Category:Non-Newtonian calculus]]\n\n[[de:Logarithmenpapier#Doppeltlogarithmisches Papier]]"

An imprecise but systematic determination of the magnitude of objects was introduced in ancient times by [[Hipparchus]].\n\nThe scale is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and defined such that each step of one magnitude changes the brightness by a factor of the fifth [[nth root|root]] of 100, or approximately 2.512. For example, a magnitude 1 star is exactly 100 times brighter than a magnitude 6 star. The brighter an object appears, the lower the value of its magnitude, with the brightest objects reaching negative values.\n\nAstronomers use two different definitions of magnitude: [[apparent magnitude]] and [[absolute magnitude]]. The ''apparent'' magnitude ({{mvar|m}}) is the brightness of an object as it appears in the [[night sky]] from [[Earth]].  Apparent magnitude depends on an object's intrinsic [[luminosity]], its [[Cosmic distance ladder|distance]], and the [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] reducing its brightness. The ''absolute'' magnitude ({{mvar|M}}) describes the intrinsic luminosity emitted by an object and is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were placed at a certain distance from Earth, 10 [[parsec]]s for stars. A more complex definition of absolute magnitude is used for [[planet]]s and [[small Solar System bodies]], based on its brightness at one [[astronomical unit]] from the observer and the Sun.\n\nThe [[Sun]] has an apparent magnitude of −27 and [[Sirius]], the brightest visible star in the night sky, −1.46. Apparent magnitudes can also be assigned to [[satellite|artificial objects]] in [[geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]] with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) sometimes reaching a magnitude of −6.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe magnitude system dates back roughly 2000 years to the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] (or the Alexandrian astronomer [[Ptolemy]]—references vary) who classified stars by their apparent brightness, which they saw as size (''[[wikt:magnitude|magnitude]]'' means \"bigness, size\"<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| last = Heifetz\n| first = M.\n| last2 = Tirion\n| first2 = W.\n| title = A Walk Through the Heavens: A Guide to Stars and Constellations and Their Legends\n| date = 2004\n| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n| publication-place = Cambridge\n| page = 6\n}}\n</ref>). To the unaided eye, a more prominent star such as [[Sirius]] or [[Arcturus]] appears larger than a less prominent star such as [[Mizar and Alcor|Mizar]], which in turn appears larger than a truly faint star such as [[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]]. In 1736, the mathematician [[John Keill]] described the ancient naked-eye magnitude system in this way:\n<blockquote>\nThe ''fixed Stars'' appear to be of different Bignesses, not because they really are so, but because they are not all equally distant from us.{{refn|group=note|Today astronomers know that the brightness of stars is a function of both their distance and their own [[luminosity]].}} Those that are nearest will excel in Lustre and Bigness; the more remote ''Stars'' will give a fainter Light, and appear smaller to the Eye. Hence arise the Distribution of ''Stars'', according to their Order and Dignity, into ''Classes''; the first Class containing those which are nearest to us, are called ''Stars'' of the first Magnitude; those that are next to them, are ''Stars'' of the second Magnitude ... and so forth, 'till we come to the ''Stars'' of the sixth Magnitude, which comprehend the smallest ''Stars'' that can be discerned with the bare Eye. For all the other ''Stars'', which are only seen by the Help of a Telescope, and which are called Telescopical, are not reckoned among these six Orders. Altho' the Distinction of ''Stars'' into six Degrees of Magnitude is commonly received by ''Astronomers''; yet we are not to judge, that every particular ''Star'' is exactly to be ranked according to a certain Bigness, which is one of the Six; but rather in reality there are almost as many Orders of ''Stars'', as there are ''Stars'', few of them being exactly of the same Bigness and Lustre. And even among those ''Stars'' which are reckoned of the brightest Class, there appears a Variety of Magnitude; for ''Sirius'' or ''Arcturus'' are each of them brighter than ''Aldebaran'' or the ''Bull's'' Eye, or even than the ''Star'' in ''Spica''; and yet all these ''Stars'' are reckoned among the ''Stars'' of the first Order: And there are some ''Stars'' of such an intermedial Order, that the ''Astronomers'' have differed in classing of them; some putting the same ''Stars'' in one Class, others in another. For Example: The little ''Dog'' was by ''Tycho'' placed among the ''Stars'' of the second Magnitude, which ''Ptolemy'' reckoned among the ''Stars'' of the first Class: And therefore it is not truly either of the first or second Order, but ought to be ranked in a Place between both.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Keill\n| first = J.\n| title = An introduction to the true astronomy\n| edition = 3rd\n| date = 1739\n| pages = 47–48\n| location = London\n}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\nNote that the brighter the star, the smaller the magnitude: Bright \"first magnitude\" stars are \"1st-class\" stars, while stars barely visible to the naked eye are \"sixth magnitude\" or \"6th-class\".\nThe system was a simple delineation of stellar brightness into six distinct groups but made no allowance for the variations in brightness within a group.\n\n[[Tycho Brahe]] attempted to directly measure the \"bigness\" of the stars in terms of angular size, which in theory meant that a star's magnitude could be determined by more than just the subjective judgment described in the above quote. He concluded that first magnitude stars measured 2 [[Minute of arc|arc minutes]] (2′) in apparent diameter ({{frac|1|30}} of a degree, or {{frac|1|15}} the diameter of the full moon), with second through sixth magnitude stars measuring {{frac|1|1|2}}′, {{frac|1|1|12}}′, {{frac|3|4}}′, {{frac|1|2}}′, and {{frac|1|3}}′, respectively.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| last = Thoren\n| first = V.

However, early telescopes produced a spurious disk-like image of a star that was larger for brighter stars and smaller for fainter ones.

Following advances in understanding the [[Airy disk|diffraction of light]] and [[astronomical seeing]], astronomers fully understood both that the apparent sizes of stars were spurious and how those sizes depended on the intensity of light coming from a star (this is the star's apparent brightness, which can be measured in units such as watts/cm<sup>2</sup>) so that brighter stars appeared larger.\n\n=== Modern definition ===\n\nEarly photometric measurements (made, for example, by using a light to project an artificial “star” into a telescope's field of view and adjusting it to match real stars in brightness) demonstrated that first magnitude stars are about 100 times brighter than sixth magnitude stars.\n\nThus in 1856 [[Norman Pogson]] of Oxford proposed that a logarithmic scale of {{radic|100|5}} ≈ 2.512 be adopted between magnitudes, so five magnitude steps corresponded precisely to a factor of 100 in brightness.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| last = Hoskin\n| first = M.\n| title = The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy\n| date = 1999\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| location = Cambridge\n| page = 258\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite book\n| last = Tassoul\n| first = J.

Consequently, a magnitude 1 star is about 2.5 times brighter than a magnitude 2 star, 2.5<sup>2</sup> brighter than a magnitude 3 star, 2.5<sup>3</sup> brighter than a magnitude 4 star, and so on.\n\nThis is the modern magnitude system, which measures the brightness, not the apparent size, of stars. Using this logarithmic scale, it is possible for a star to be brighter than “first class”, so [[Arcturus]] or [[Vega]] are magnitude 0, and [[Sirius]] is magnitude −1.46.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Scale ==\n\nAs mentioned above, the scale appears to work 'in reverse', with objects with a negative magnitude being brighter than those with a positive magnitude. The more negative the value, the brighter the object.\n[[File:Number-line.svg|center]]\nObjects appearing farther to the left on this line are brighter, while objects appearing farther to the right are dimmer. Thus zero appears in the middle, with the brightest objects on the far left, and the dimmest objects on the far right.\n\n== Apparent and absolute magnitude ==\nTwo of the main types of magnitudes distinguished by astronomers are:\n* Apparent magnitude, the brightness of an object as it appears in the night sky. \n* Absolute magnitude, which measures the [[luminosity]] of an object (or reflected light for non-luminous objects like [[asteroid]]s); it is the object's apparent magnitude as seen from a specific distance, conventionally 10 [[parsec]]s (32.6 [[light year]]s). \nThe difference between these concepts can be seen by comparing two stars. [[Betelgeuse]] (apparent magnitude 0.5, absolute magnitude −5.8) appears slightly dimmer in the sky than [[Alpha Centauri]] (apparent magnitude 0.0, absolute magnitude 4.4) even though it emits thousands of times more light, because Betelgeuse is much farther away.\n\n=== Apparent magnitude ===\n{{Main|Apparent magnitude}}\n\nUnder the modern logarithmic magnitude scale, two objects, one of which is used as a reference or baseline, whose [[Intensity (physics)|intensities]] (brightnesses) measured from [[Earth]] in units of power per unit area (such as watts per square metre, W&nbsp;m<sup>−2</sup>) are {{math|''I''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''I''<sub>ref</sub>}}, will have magnitudes {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>ref</sub>}} related by\n\n:<math>m_1-m_{\\rm ref}=-2.5\\log_{10} \\left ( \\frac{I_1}{I_{\\rm ref}} \\right ).</math>\n\nUsing this formula, the magnitude scale can be extended beyond the ancient magnitude 1–6 range, and it becomes a precise measure of brightness rather than simply a classification system. [[Astronomer]]s can now measure differences as small as one-hundredth of a magnitude. Stars that have magnitudes between 1.5 and 2.5 are called second-magnitude; there are some 20 stars brighter than 1.5, which are first-magnitude stars (see the [[list of brightest stars]]). For example, [[Sirius]] is magnitude −1.46, [[Arcturus]] is −0.04, [[Aldebaran]] is 0.85, [[Spica]] is 1.04, and [[Procyon]] is 0.34. Under the ancient magnitude system, all of these stars might have been classified as \"stars of the first magnitude\".\n\nMagnitudes can also be calculated for objects far brighter than stars (such as the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]), and for objects too faint for the human eye to see (such as [[Pluto]]).\n\n===Absolute magnitude===\n{{main|Absolute magnitude}}\nOften, only apparent magnitude is mentioned since it can be measured directly. Absolute magnitude can be calculated from apparent magnitude and distance from:\n:<math>m - M = 5 \\left( \\log_{10}d - 1 \\right).</math>\nThis is known as the [[distance modulus]], where {{mvar|d}} is the distance to the star measured in [[parsec]]s, {{mvar|m}} is the apparent magnitude, and {{mvar|M}} is the absolute magnitude.\n\nIf the line of sight between the object and observer is affected by [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] due to absorption of light by [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust particles]], then the object's apparent magnitude will be correspondingly fainter. For {{mvar|A}} magnitudes of extinction, the relationship between apparent and absolute magnitudes becomes\n:<math>m - M = 5 \\left( \\log_{10}d - 1 \\right) + A.</math>\n\nStellar absolute magnitudes are usually designated with a capital M with a subscript to indicate the passband.  For example, M<sub>V</sub> is the magnitude at 10 parsecs in the [[UBV photometric system|V]] passband.  A [[bolometric magnitude]] (M<sub>bol</sub>) is an absolute magnitude adjusted to take account of radiation across all wavelengths; it is typically smaller (i.e. brighter) than an absolute magnitude in a particular passband, especially for very hot or very cool objects.  Bolometric magnitudes are formally defined based on stellar luminosity in [[watt]]s, and are normalised to be approximately equal to M<sub>V</sub> for  yellow stars.\n\nAbsolute magnitudes for solar system objects are frequently quoted based on a distance of 1 AU.  These are referred to with a capital H symbol.  Since these objects are lit primarily by reflected light from the sun, an H magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude of the object at 1 AU from the sun and 1 AU from the observer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/h.html|title=Glossary|publisher=JPL|accessdate=2017-11-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171125195529/https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/h.html|archivedate=2017-11-25|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\n\nThe following is a table giving [[apparent magnitude]]s for [[celestial object]]s and [[artificial satellites]] ranging from the Sun to the faintest object visible with the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble Space Telescope (HST)]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:none; \"\n!width=60 | Apparent<br>magnitude\n!width=60 |  Brightness<br>relative to<br>magnitude 0\n!width=150 | Example\n!width=30 rowspan=\"21\" style=\"border:none; background-color: white;\"|\n!width=60 |  Apparent<br>magnitude\n!width=60 |  Brightness<br>relative to<br>magnitude 0\n!width=150 | Example\n!width=30 rowspan=\"21\" style=\"border:none; background-color: white;\"|\n!width=60 |  Apparent<br>magnitude\n!width=60 |  Brightness<br>relative to<br>magnitude 0\n!width=150 | Example\n|-\n|style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|−27||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|{{val|6.31|e=10}}||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|[[Sun]]||−7||631||[[SN 1006|SN 1006 supernova]]||13||{{val|6.31|e=−6}}||[[3C 273|3C 273 quasar]] <br> limit of 4.5–6&nbsp;in (11–15&nbsp;cm) telescopes\n|-\n| −26||{{val|2.51|e=10}}||||−6||251||[[International Space Station|ISS]] {{small|(max.)}}||14||{{val|2.51|e=−6}}||[[Pluto]] {{small|(max.)}} <br> limit of 8–10&nbsp;in (20–25&nbsp;cm) telescopes\n|-\n| −25||{{val|1|e=10}}||||−5||100||[[Venus]] {{small|(max.)}}||15||{{val|1|e=−6}}||\n|-\n| −24||{{val|3.98|e=9}}||||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|−4||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|39.8||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|Faintest objects visible during the day with the naked eye when the sun is high<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sky.velp.info/daystars.php|title=Seeing stars and planets in the daylight|author=|date=|website=sky.velp.info|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307165917/http://sky.velp.info/daystars.php|archivedate=7 March 2016|df=}}</ref>||16||{{val|3.98|e=−7}}||[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] {{small|(max.)}}\n|-\n| −23||{{val|1.58|e=9}}||||−3||15.8||[[Jupiter]] {{small|(max.)}}, [[Mars]] {{small|(max.)}}||17||{{val|1.58|e=−7}}||\n|-\n| −22||{{val|6.31|e=8}}||||−2||6.31||[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] {{small|(max.)}}||18||{{val|6.31|e=−8}}||\n|-\n| −21||{{val|2.51|e=8}}||||−1||2.51||[[Sirius]]||19||{{val|2.51|e=−8}}||\n|-\n| −20||{{val|1|e=8}}||||0||1||[[Vega]], [[Saturn]] {{small|(max.)}}||20||{{val|1|e=−8}}||\n|-\n| −19||{{val|3.98|e=7}}||||1||0.398||[[Antares]]||21||{{val|3.98|e=−9}}||[[Callirrhoe (moon)|Callirrhoe]] {{small|(satellite of Jupiter)}}\n|-\n| −18||{{val|1.58|e=7}}||||2||0.158||[[Polaris]]||22||{{val|1.58|e=−9}}||\n|-\n| −17||{{val|6.31|e=6}}||||3||0.0631||[[Cor Caroli]]||23||{{val|6.31|e=−10}}||\n|-\n| −16||{{val|2.51|e=6}}||||4||0.0251||[[Acubens]]||24||{{val|2.51|e=−10}}||\n|-\n| −15||{{val|1|e=6}}||||5||0.01||[[4 Vesta|Vesta]] {{small|(max.)}}, [[Uranus]] {{small|(max.)}}||25||{{val|1|e=−10}}||[[Fenrir (moon)|Fenrir]] {{small|(satellite of Saturn)}}\n|-\n| −14||{{val|3.98|e=5}}||||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|6||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|{{val|3.98|e=−3}}||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|typical limit of naked eye{{refn|group=note|Under very dark skies, such as are found in remote rural areas}}||26||{{val|3.98|e=−11}}||\n|-\n| style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|−13||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|{{val|1.58|e=5}}||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|[[full moon]]||7||{{val|1.58|e=−3}}||[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] {{small|(max.)}}||27||{{val|1.58|e=−11}}||visible light limit of [[Optical telescope#Astronomical research telescopes|8m telescopes]]\n|-\n| −12||{{val|6.31|e=4}}||||8||{{val|6.31|e=−4}}||[[Neptune]] {{small|(max.)}}||28||{{val|6.31|e=−12}}||\n|-\n| −11||{{val|2.51|e=4}}||||9||{{val|2.51|e=−4}}||||29||{{val|2.51|e=−12}}||\n|-\n| −10||{{val|1|e=4}}||||10||{{val|1|e=−4}}||typical limit of 7×50 binoculars||30||{{val|1|e=−12}}||\n|-\n| −9||{{val|3.98|e=3}}||[[Iridium flare]] {{small|(max.)}}||11||{{val|3.98|e=−5}}||[[Proxima Centauri]]||31||{{val|3.98|e=−13}}||\n|-\n| −8||{{val|1.58|e=3}}||||12||{{val|1.58|e=−5}}||||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|32||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|{{val|1.58|e=−13}}||style=\"background:#edf3fe;\"|visible light limit of [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]]\n|}\n\n=== Other scales ===\n\nUnder [[N.

This is why objects brighter than Vega, such as [[Sirius]] (Vega magnitude of −1.46. or −1.5), have negative magnitudes.  However, in the late twentieth century Vega was found to vary in brightness making it unsuitable for an absolute reference, so the reference system was modernized to not depend on any particular star's stability.  This is why the modern value for Vega' magnitude is close to, but no longer exactly zero, but rather 0.03 in the V (visual) band.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| last = Milone\n| first = E.

At greater depths, distances, or magnitudes the surface waves are greatly reduced, and the Local magnitude scale underestimates the magnitude, a problem called ''saturation''. Additional scales were developed<ref>See {{Harvnb|Bormann|Saul|2009}} for an overview.</ref> – a surface-wave magnitude scale ({{m|s|link=y}}) by [[Beno Gutenberg]] in 1945<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|1945a}}.</ref>, a body-wave magnitude scale ({{m|B|link=y}}) by Gutenberg and Richter in 1956,<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|1945b}}, {{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1956b}}.</ref> and a number of variants<ref>See [[Seismic magnitude scales]].</ref> – to overcome the deficiencies of the {{M|l}} scale, but all are subject to saturation. A particular problem was that the {{m|s}} scale (which in the 1970s was the preferred magnitude scale) saturates around {{m|s|8.0}}, and therefore underestimates the energy release of \"great\" earthquakes<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977|p=2981}}.</ref> such as the [[1960 Chilean Earthquake|1960 Chilean]] and [[1964 Alaska earthquake|1964 Alaskan]] earthquakes. These had {{m|s}} magnitudes of 8.5 and 8.4 respectively but were notably more powerful than other M 8 earthquakes; their moment magnitudes were closer to 9.6 and 9.3.<ref>{{short-isc|EHB|879136}}; {{short-isc|EHB|869809}}.</ref>\n\n=== Single couple or double couple ===\nThe study of earthquakes is challenging as the source events cannot be observed directly, and it took many years to develop the mathematics for understanding what the seismic waves from an earthquake can tell us about the source event. An early step was to determine how different systems of forces might generate seismic waves equivalent to those observed from earthquakes.<ref> {{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=112-113}}; {{Harvnb|Stauder|1962|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nThe simplest force system is a single force acting on an object. If it has sufficient strength to overcome any resistance it will cause the object to move (\"translate\"). A pair of forces, acting on the same \"line of action\" but in opposite directions, will cancel; if they cancel (balance) exactly there will be no net translation, though the object will experience stress, either tension or compression. If the pair of forces are offset, acting along parallel but separate lines of action, the object experiences a rotational force, or [[torque]]. In [[mechanics]] (the branch of physics concerned with the interactions of forces) this model is called a ''[[couple (mechanics)|couple]]'', also ''simple couple'' or ''single couple''. If a second couple of equal and opposite magnitude is applied their torques cancel; this is called a ''double couple''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}.</ref> A double couple can be viewed as \"equivalent to a pressure and tension acting simultaneously at right angles\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1995|p=1210}}; {{Harvnb|Maruyama|1963|p=484}}.</ref>\n\nThe single couple and double couple models are important in seismology because each can be used to derive how the seismic waves generated by an earthquake event should appear in the \"far field\" (that is, at distance). Once that relation is understood it can be inverted to use the earthquake's observed seismic waves to determine its other characteristics, including fault geometry and seismic moment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shearer|2009|p=245}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1923 Hiroshi Nakano showed that certain aspects of seismic waves could be explained in terms of a double couple model.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1995|p=1210}}.</ref> This led to a three-decade long controversy over the best way to model the seismic source: as a single couple, or a double couple?<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}.</ref> While Japanese seismologists favored the double couple, most seismologists favored the single couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|p=115}}. See {{Harvnb|Byerly|1960}} for a contemporary account of why many seismologists favored a single couple model.</ref> Although the single couple model had some short-comings, it seemed more intuitive, and there was a belief – mistaken, as it turned out – that the [[elastic rebound theory]] for explaining why earthquakes happen required a single couple model.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=116, 117}}.</ref> In principle these models could be distinguished by differences in the radiation patterns of their [[S-waves]], but the quality of the observational data was inadequate for that.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pujol|2003b|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nThe debate ended when {{Harvtxt|Maruyama|1963}}, Haskell (1964), and {{Harvtxt|Burridge|Knopoff|1964}} showed that if earthquake ruptures are modeled as dislocations the pattern of seismic radiation can always be matched with an equivalent pattern derived from a double couple, but not from a single couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pujol|2003b|p=165}}; {{Harvnb|Miyake|2017|pp=117–118}}.</ref> This was confirmed as better and more plentiful data coming from the [[World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network]] (WWSSN) permitted closer analysis of seismic waves.

Seismic moment is measured in units of [[Newton meters]] (N·m) or [[Joules]], or (in the older [[CGS]] system) dyne-centimeters (dyn-cm).<ref>{{Harvnb|Beroza|Kanamori|2015|p=5}}.</ref>\n\nThe first calculation of an earthquake's seismic moment from its seismic waves was by [[Keiiti Aki]] for the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]].<ref> {{Harvnb|Dziewonski|Chou|Woodhouse|1981|p=2826}}; {{Harvnb|Aki|1966b}}.</ref> He did this two ways.  First, he used data from distant stations of the [[WWSSN]] to analyze long-period (200 second) seismic waves (wavelength of about 1,000 kilometers) to determine the magnitude of the earthquake's equivalent double couple.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966a|pp=24, 36}}.</ref> Second, he drew upon the work of Burridge and Knopoff on dislocation to determine the amount of slip, the energy released, and the stress drop (essentially how much of the potential energy was released).<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966a|p=24}}.</ref> In particular, he derived a now famous equation that relates an earthquake's seismic moment to its physical parameters:\n\n::<big>{{math|''M''{{ssub|0}} {{=}} ''&mu;u&#772;S''}}</big>\n\nwith {{mvar|&mu;}} being the rigidity (or resistance) of moving a fault with a surface areas of {{mvar|S}} over an average dislocation (distance) of {{mvar|u&#772;}}. (Modern formulations replace {{mvar|u&#772;S}} with the equivalent {{mvar|D&#772;A}}, known as the \"geometric moment\" or \"potency\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|p=12}}, equation 3.1.</ref>.) By this equation the ''moment'' determined from the double couple of the seismic waves can be related to the moment calculated from knowledge of the surface area of fault slippage and the amount of slip. In the case of the Niigata earthquake the dislocation estimated from the seismic moment reasonably approximated the observed dislocation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aki|1966b|p=84}}.</ref>\n\nSeismic moment is a measure of the [[work (physics)|work]] (more precisely, the [[torque]]) that results in inelastic (permanent) displacement or distortion of the earth's crust.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|p=14}}; {{Harvnb|Bormann|Di Giacomo|2011|p=412}}.</ref> It is related to the total energy released by an earthquake.

Gutenberg and Richter suggested that radiated energy E<sub>s</sub> could be estimated as\n\n:<math>\\log E_s \\approx 4.8 + 1.5 M_S, </math>\n\n(in Joules). Unfortunately, the duration of many very large earthquakes was longer than 20 seconds, the period of the surface waves used in the measurement of {{M|s}}. This meant that giant earthquakes such as the 1960 Chilean earthquake (M 9.5) were only assigned an {{M|s|8.2}}. [[Caltech]] seismologist [[Hiroo Kanamori]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977}}.</ref> recognized this deficiency and he took the simple but important step of defining a magnitude based on estimates of radiated energy, {{M|w}}, where the \"w\" stood for work (energy):\n \n:<math> M_w = 2/3 \\log E_s - 3.2 </math>\n\nKanamori recognized that measurement of radiated energy is technically difficult since it involves integration of wave energy over the entire frequency band. To simplify this calculation, he noted that the lowest frequency parts of the spectrum can often be used to estimate the rest of the spectrum. The lowest frequency [[asymptote]] of a seismic spectrum is characterized by the [[seismic moment]], {{M|0}}. Using an approximate relation between radiated energy and seismic moment (which assumes stress drop is complete and ignores fracture energy),\n\n:<math>E_s \\approx M_0 / (2 \\times 10^4) </math>\n\n(where '''E''' is in Joules and {{M|0}} is in N<math> \\cdot </math>m), Kanamori approximated {{M|w}} by\n\n:<math> M_w = ( \\log M_0 - 9.1 ) /1.5 </math>\n\n=== Moment magnitude scale ===\n\nThe formula above made it much easier to estimate the energy-based magnitude {{m|w}}, but it changed the fundamental nature of the scale into a moment magnitude scale. [[Caltech]] seismologist [[Thomas C. Hanks]] noted that Kanamori's {{M|w}} scale was very similar to a relationship between {{M|L}} and {{M|0}} that was reported by {{Harvtxt|Thatcher|Hanks|1973}}\n\n:<math> M_L \\approx ( \\log M_0 - 9.0 ) /1.5 </math>\n\n{{Harvtxt|Hanks|Kanamori|1979}} combined their work to define a new magnitude scale based on estimates of seismic moment\n\n:<math> M = ( \\log M_0 - 9.05 ) /1.5 </math>\n\nwhere <math> M_0 </math> is defined in newton meters (N·m).\n\nAlthough the formal definition of moment magnitude is given by this paper and is designated by '''M''', it has been common for many authors to refer to {{M|w}} as moment magnitude. In most of these cases, they are actually referring to moment magnitude '''M''' as defined above. <!-- ** This needs to be examined, and rewritten to avoid confusion.  -->\n\n== Current use ==\n<!-- This section is poorly written mish-mash of un-cited details. I am inclined to delete it. -JJ -->\nMoment magnitude is now the most common measure of earthquake size for medium to large earthquake magnitudes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Boyle|2008|p=}}.</ref>{{scientific citation needed|date=March 2019}} but in practice, seismic moment, the seismological parameter it is based on, is not measured routinely for smaller quakes. For example, the [[United States Geological Survey]] does not use this scale for earthquakes with a magnitude of less than 3.5,{{cn|date=March 2019}} which includes the great majority of quakes.\n\nCurrent practice in official{{who|date=March 2019}} earthquake reports is to adopt moment magnitude as the preferred magnitude, i.e., {{M|w}} is the official magnitude reported whenever it can be computed. Because seismic moment ({{M|0}}, the quantity needed to compute {{M|w}}) is not measured if the earthquake is too small, the reported magnitude for earthquakes smaller than {{M|.|4}} is often Richter's {{M|L}}.\n\nPopular press reports most often deal with significant earthquakes larger than {{M|.|~ 4}}. For these events, the official{{who|date=March 2019}} magnitude is the moment magnitude {{M|w}}, not Richter's local magnitude {{m|l}}.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe symbol for the moment magnitude scale is {{m|w}}, with the subscript \"w\" meaning [[mechanical work]] accomplished. The moment magnitude {{M|w}} is a [[dimensionless number|dimensionless value]] defined by [[Hiroo Kanamori]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|1977|p=}}.</ref> as\n\n:<math>M_\\mathrm{w} = {\\frac{2}{3}}\\log_{10}(M_0) - 10.7,</math>\n\nwhere {{M|0}} is the seismic moment in [[dyne]]⋅cm (10<sup>−7</sup>&nbsp;N⋅m).<ref>{{Harvnb|Hanks|Kanamori|1979|p=}}.</ref> The constant values in the equation are chosen to achieve consistency with the magnitude values produced by earlier scales, such as the Local Magnitude and the Surface Wave magnitude.  Thus, a magnitude zero [[microearthquake]] has a seismic moment of approximately {{val|1.2e9|u=N⋅m}}, while the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]] of 1960, with an estimated moment magnitude of 9.4–9.6, had a seismic moment between {{val|1.4e23|u=N⋅m}} and {{val|2.8e23|u=N⋅m}}. <!-- ** Question whether the second instance of Mw above should be seismic moment {{m|0}}. -->\n\n== Relations between seismic moment, potential energy released and radiated energy ==\nSeismic moment is not a direct measure of energy changes during an earthquake. The relations between seismic moment and the energies involved in an earthquake depend on parameters that have large uncertainties and that may vary between earthquakes. Potential energy is stored in the crust in the form of [[elastic energy]] due to built-up [[Stress (physics)|stress]] and [[gravitational energy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kostrov|1974|p=}}; {{Harvnb|Dahlen|1977|p=}}.</ref> During an earthquake, a portion <math>\\Delta W</math> of this stored energy is transformed into\n* energy dissipated <math>E_f</math>in frictional weakening and inelastic deformation in rocks by processes such as the creation of cracks\n* heat <math>E_h</math>\n* radiated seismic energy <math>E_s</math>.\n\nThe potential energy drop caused by an earthquake is related approximately to its seismic moment by\n\n:<math>\\Delta W \\approx \\frac{\\overline\\sigma}{\\mu} M_0</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> is the average of the ''absolute'' shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., equation 3 of {{Harvnb|Venkataraman|Kanamori|2004|p=}}) and <math>\\mu</math> is the average of the [[shear modulus|shear moduli]] of the rocks that constitute the fault. Currently, there is no technology to measure absolute stresses at all depths of interest, nor method to estimate it accurately, and <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> is thus poorly known. It could vary highly from one earthquake to another. Two earthquakes with identical <math>M_0</math> but different <math>\\overline\\sigma</math> would have released different <math>\\Delta W</math>.\n\nThe radiated energy caused by an earthquake is approximately related to seismic moment by\n\n:<math> E_\\mathrm{s} \\approx \\eta_R \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_s}{2\\mu} M_0 </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta_R = E_s /(E_s+E_f)</math> is radiated efficiency and <math>\\Delta\\sigma_s</math> is the static stress drop, i.e., the difference between shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., from equation 1 of {{Harvnb|Venkataraman|Kanamori|2004|p=}}). These two quantities are far from being constants. For instance, <math>\\eta_R</math> depends on rupture speed; it is close to 1 for regular earthquakes but much smaller for slower earthquakes such as [[tsunami earthquake]]s and [[slow earthquake]]s. Two earthquakes with identical <math>M_0</math> but different <math>\\eta_R</math> or <math>\\Delta\\sigma_s</math> would have radiated different <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math>.\n\nBecause <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> and <math>M_0</math> are fundamentally independent properties of an earthquake source, and since <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> can now be computed more directly and robustly than in the 1970s, introducing a separate magnitude associated to radiated energy was warranted. Choy and Boatwright defined in 1995 the ''energy magnitude''<ref>{{Harvnb|Choy|Boatwright|1995|p=}}</ref>\n\n: <math>M_\\mathrm{E} =  \\textstyle{\\frac{2}{3}}\\log_{10}E_\\mathrm{s} -3.2</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_\\mathrm{s}</math> is in J (N·m).\n\n== Comparative energy released by two earthquakes ==\n\nAssuming the values of {{mvar|&sigma;&#772;/&mu;}} are the same for all earthquakes, one can consider {{M|w}} as a measure of the potential energy change &Delta;''W'' caused by earthquakes. Similarly, if one assumes <math>\\eta_R \\Delta\\sigma_s/2\\mu</math> is the same for all earthquakes, one can consider {{M|w}} as a measure of the energy ''E''<sub>s</sub> radiated by earthquakes.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the following formula, obtained by [[equation solving|solving]] for {{M|0}} the equation defining {{m|w}}, allows one to assess the ratio <math>E_1/E_2</math> of energy release (potential or radiated) between two earthquakes of different moment magnitudes, <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math>:\n:<math> E_1/E_2 \\approx 10^{\\frac{3}{2}(m_1 - m_2)}.</math>\n\nAs with the Richter scale, an increase of one step on the [[logarithmic scale]] of moment magnitude corresponds to a 10<sup>1.5</sup> ≈ 32 times increase in the amount of energy released, and an increase of two steps corresponds to a 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 times increase in energy. Thus, an earthquake of {{M|w}}  of 7.0 contains 1000 times as much energy as one of 5.0 and about 32 times that of 6.0.\n\n== {{anchor|Subtypes}} Subtypes of M<sub>w</sub> ==\nVarious ways of determining moment magnitude have been developed, and several subtypes of the {{m|w}} scale can be used to indicate the basis used.<ref>USGS [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/terms.php Technical Terms used on Event Pages].</ref>\n\n* {{vanchor|'''Mwb'''}} – Based on ''moment tensor inversion'' of long-period (~10 – 100 s) body-waves.\n* {{vanchor|'''Mwr'''}} – From a ''moment tensor inversion'' of complete waveforms at regional distances (~ 1,000 miles).

      "text": "{{about|unit of measurement|other uses|Neper (disambiguation)}}\n\nThe '''neper''' (symbol: Np) is a logarithmic unit for [[ratio]]s of measurements of physical field and power quantities, such as [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] and loss of electronic signals. The unit's name is derived from the name of [[John Napier]], the inventor of logarithms. As is the case for the [[decibel]] and bel, the neper is a unit defined in the [[international standard]] [[ISO 80000]]. It is not part of the [[International System of Units]] (SI), but is accepted for use alongside the SI.<ref name=BIPM>Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (2006), [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf The International System of Units (SI) Brochure, 8th edition], pp. 127–128.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nLike the [[decibel]], the neper is a unit in a [[logarithmic scale]]. While the bel uses the decadic (base-10) [[logarithm]] to compute ratios, the neper uses the [[natural logarithm]], based on [[Euler's number]] ({{nowrap|[[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] ≈ 2.71828}}). The value of a ratio in nepers is given by\n:<math>\nL_{\\rm Np} = \\ln\\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \\ln x_1 - \\ln x_2. \n</math>\n\nwhere <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> are the values of interest (amplitudes), and {{math|ln}} is the natural logarithm.  When the values are quadratic in the amplitude (e.g. power), they are first linearised by taking the square root before the logarithm is taken, or equivalently the result is halved.{{citation needed|reason=It is clear from references (e.g. BIPM brochure) that this is true for amplitudes.  That there is a convention of referring power-like quantities to field-like quantities with the associated halving to determine a quantity in Np (the reverse of the established convention for dB) is not obvious, and I'm not even convinced that this is the case.  We must not assume from electronic texts that this is so.  We should have an authoritative reference.|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the neper is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 Np = 1}}.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/30/5/010/pdf Thor, A. J. (1994). New International Standards for Quantities and Units. Metrologia, 30(5), 517.]</ref>\n\n==Units==\n{{main|Level (logarithmic quantity)}}\n\nThe neper is defined in terms of ratios of [[Field, power, and root-power quantities|field quantities]] — also called ''root-power quantities'' — (for example, [[voltage]] or [[Current (electricity)|current]] amplitudes in electrical circuits, or [[sound pressure|pressure]] in [[acoustics]]), whereas the decibel was originally defined in terms of [[Power (physics)|power]] ratios.  A power ratio 10 log ''r'' dB is equivalent to a field-quantity ratio 20 log ''r'' dB, since power in a linear system is proportional to the square ([[Joule's first law|Joule's laws]]) of the amplitude.  Hence the decibel and the neper have a fixed ratio to each other:\n\n:<math>\n1\\ \\text{Np} = 20 \\log_{10} e\\ \\text{dB} \\approx \\text{8.685889638 dB} \\,\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\n1\\ \\mathrm{dB} = \\frac{1}{20} \\ln(10)\\ \\mathrm{Np} \\approx \\text{0.115129255 Np}. \\,\n</math>\n\nThe (voltage) level ratio is\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & = 10 \\log_{10} \\frac{x_1^2}{x_2^2} & \\text{dB} \\\\\n  & = 10 \\log_{10} {\\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_2}\\right)}^2 & \\text{dB} \\\\\n  & = 20 \\log_{10} \\frac{x_1}{x_2} & \\text{dB} \\\\\n  & = \\ln \\frac{x_1}{x_2} & \\text{Np}. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nLike the decibel, the neper is a dimensionless unit. The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) recognizes both units.  Only the neper is [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] with the SI.<ref>[[ISO 80000]]-3:2007 §0.5</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2018}}\nThe neper is a natural linear unit of [[relative difference]], meaning in nepers (logarithmic units) relative differences add rather than multiply. This property is shared with logarithmic units in other bases, such as the bel.\n\nParticular to the neper, however, is that the derived unit of ''[[centineper]]'' is asymptotically equal to percentage difference for very small differences – since the derivative of the natural log (at 1) is 1; this is not shared with other logarithmic units, which introduce a scaling factor due to the derivative not being unity.

      "text": "The '''Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale''' is a [[logarithmic scale]] used by [[astronomer]]s to rate the potential hazard of impact of a [[Near-Earth object|near-earth object]] (NEO). It combines two types of [[data]]&mdash;[[probability]] of impact and estimated [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] yield&mdash;into a single \"hazard\" value. A rating of 0 means the hazard is equivalent to the '''background hazard''' (defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact).<ref name=\"palermo\"/> A rating of +2 would indicate the hazard is 100 times greater than a random background event.  Scale values less than −2 reflect events for which there are no likely consequences, while Palermo Scale values between −2 and 0 indicate situations that merit careful monitoring.  A similar but less complex scale is the [[Torino Scale]], which is used for simpler descriptions in the non-scientific media.\n\n==Scale==\nThe scale compares the likelihood of the detected potential impact with the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.  This average risk from random impacts is known as the background risk.  The Palermo Scale value, ''P'', is defined by the equation:\n:<math>P \\equiv \\log_{10} \\frac {p_i} {f_B T}</math>\nwhere\n:*''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the impact probability\n:*''T'' is the time interval over which p<sub>i</sub> is considered\n:*''f<sub>B</sub>'' is the background impact frequency\n\nThe background impact frequency is defined for this purpose as:\n:<math>f_B = \\frac{3}{100} E^{-\\frac45} \\text{ yr}^{-1}\\;</math>\nwhere the energy threshold E is measured in [[TNT equivalent|megatons]],  yr is the unit of T divided by one year.\n\n==Positive rating==\nThe near-Earth object {{mpl|(89959) 2002 NT|7}} was the first near-Earth object detected by [[NASA]]'s latest NEO program to be given a positive rating on the scale of 0.06,<ref name=\"BBC-NT7\"/> indicating a higher-than-background threat. The value was subsequently lowered after more measurements were taken. 2002 NT7 is no longer considered to pose any risk and was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 1 August 2002.<ref name=\"removed\"/>\n\nIn September 2002, the highest Palermo rating was that of asteroid [[(29075) 1950 DA]], with a value of 0.17 for a possible collision in the year 2880.<ref name=\"NEO-1950DA_1\"/> By December 2015, the rating had been reduced all the way to −1.42.<ref name=\"SEIM29075\"/>\n\nFor a brief period in late December 2004, with an [[observation arc]] of 190 days, asteroid {{mpl|(99942) Apophis}} (then known only by its [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2004 MN|4}}) held the record for the highest Palermo scale values, with a value of 1.10 for a possible collision in the year 2029.<ref name=\"mirror\"/> The 1.10 value indicated that a collision with this object was considered to be almost 12.6 times as likely as a random background event: 1 in 37<ref name=\"predicting-Apophis\"/> instead of 1 in 472.

For a commonplace example based on the facts that the masses of a mole of water, a mole of hydrogen ions, and a mole of [[hydroxide ion]]s are respectively 18 g, 1 g, and 17 g, a quantity of 10<sup>7</sup> moles of pure (pH 7) water, or 180 tonnes (18&times;10<sup>7</sup> g), contains close to 1 g of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] hydrogen ions (or rather 19 g of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> [[hydronium]] ions) and 17 g of hydroxide ions.\n\nNote that pH depends on temperature. For instance at 0&nbsp;°C the pH of pure water is 7.47. At 25&nbsp;°C it's 7.00, and at 100&nbsp;°C it's 6.14.\n\nThis definition was adopted because [[ion-selective electrode]]s, which are used to measure pH, respond to activity. Ideally, electrode potential, ''E'', follows the [[Nernst equation]], which, for the hydrogen ion can be written as\n\n:<math chem> E = E^0 + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(a_\\ce{H+})=E^0 - \\frac{2.303 RT}{F} \\ce{pH}</math>\n\nwhere ''E'' is a measured potential, ''E''<sup>0</sup> is the standard electrode potential, ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s, ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]]. For H<sup>+</sup> number of electrons transferred is one. It follows that electrode potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity.  Precise measurement of pH is presented in International Standard [[ISO 31-8]] as follows:<ref>Quantities and units – Part 8: Physical chemistry and molecular physics, Annex C (normative): pH. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 1992.</ref> A [[galvanic cell]] is set up to measure the [[electromotive force]] (e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution. The reference electrode may be a [[silver chloride electrode]] or a [[Saturated calomel electrode|calomel electrode]]. The hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a [[standard hydrogen electrode]].\n\n:<span class=\"texhtml\">Reference electrode | concentrated solution of KCl || test solution | H<sub>2</sub> | Pt</span>{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\nFirstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the emf, ''E''<sub>S</sub>, is measured. Then the emf, ''E''<sub>X</sub>, of the same cell containing the solution of unknown pH is measured.\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{pH(X)} = \\ce{pH(S)}+\\frac{E_\\ce{S} - E_\\ce{X} }{z}</math>\n\nThe difference between the two measured emf values is proportional to pH. This method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential. The proportionality constant, 1/''z'' is ideally equal to <math>\\frac{1}{2.303RT/F}\\ </math> the \"Nernstian slope\".\n\nTo apply this process in practice, a [[glass electrode]] is used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode. It is calibrated against [[buffer solution]]s of known hydrogen ion activity. [[IUPAC]] has proposed the use of a set of buffer solutions of known H<sup>+</sup> activity.<ref name=covington/> Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the \"slope\" may differ slightly from ideal. To implement this approach to calibration, the electrode is first immersed in a standard solution and the reading on a [[pH meter]] is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer's value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted, using the \"slope\" control, to be equal to the pH for that solution. Further details, are given in the [[IUPAC]] recommendations.<ref name=covington/> When more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values. Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25&nbsp;°C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures.\n\nThe pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a [[dimensionless quantity]].\n\n===p[H]===\nThis was the original definition of Sørensen,<ref name=\"Sor\" /> which was superseded in favor of pH in 1909. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted [H<sup>+</sup>] in modern chemistry, which appears to have units of concentration. More correctly, the thermodynamic activity of H<sup>+</sup> in dilute solution should be replaced by [H<sup>+</sup>]/c<sub>0</sub>, where the standard state concentration c<sub>0</sub> = 1 mol/L. This ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined.\n\nHowever, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly, if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way to do this, which has been used extensively, is to [[titration|titrate]] a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkaline in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkaline are known, it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a [[Gran plot#Electrode calibration|Gran plot]].<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/ed042p375| last=Rossotti| first=F.J.C.|author2=Rossotti, H.|year=1965|title=Potentiometric titrations using Gran plots: A textbook omission|journal=J. Chem. Educ.|volume=42|pages=375–378| issue=7|bibcode = 1965JChEd..42..375R }}</ref> The calibration yields a value for the standard electrode potential, ''E''<sup>0</sup>, and a slope factor, ''f'', so that the Nernst equation in the form\n:<math chem>E = E^0 + f\\frac{2.303RT}{F} \\log[\\ce{H+}]</math>\ncan be used to derive hydrogen ion concentrations from experimental measurements of ''E''. The slope factor, ''f'', is usually slightly less than one. A slope factor of less than 0.95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly. The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during the titration. As it is constant, its value can be set to one by defining the [[standard state]] as being the solution containing the background electrolyte. Thus, the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration.\n\nThe glass electrode (and other [[ion selective electrode]]s) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below.\n\nThe difference between p[H] and pH is quite small. It has been stated<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}}, Section 13.23, \"Determination of pH\"</ref> that pH = p[H] + 0.04. It is common practice to use the term \"pH\" for both types of measurement.\n\n===pH indicators===\n{{main|Universal indicator}}\n[[Image:Universal indicator paper.jpg|thumb|300px|Chart showing the variation of color of universal indicator paper with pH]]\nIndicators may be used to measure pH, by making use of the fact that their color changes with pH. Visual comparison of the color of a test solution with a standard color chart provides a means to measure pH accurate to the nearest whole number. More precise measurements are possible if the color is measured spectrophotometrically, using a [[Colorimeter (chemistry)|colorimeter]] or [[spectrophotometer]].\n[[Universal indicator]] consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator. Another method of measuring pH is using an electronic [[pH meter]].\n\n===pOH===\n[[Image:PHscalenolang.svg|thumb|300px|Relation between p[OH] and p[H] (red = acidic region, blue = basic region)]]\npOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions. OH<sup>−</sup>. pOH values are derived from pH measurements. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by\n\n:<math chem>[\\ce{OH^-}] = \\frac{K_\\ce{W}}{[\\ce{H^+}]}</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sub>W</sub> is the [[self-ionization of water|self-ionisation]] constant of water. Taking [[logarithm]]s\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{pOH} = \\ce{p}K_\\ce{W} - \\ce{pH}</math>\n\nSo, at room temperature, pOH ≈ 14 − pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of [[Alkaline soils|soil alkalinity]].\n\n===Extremes of pH===\nMeasurement of pH below about 2.5 (ca. 0.003&nbsp;[[mole (unit)|mol]] dm<sup>−3</sup> acid) and above about 10.5 (ca. 0.0003&nbsp;mol dm<sup>−3</sup> alkaline) requires special procedures because, when using the glass electrode, the [[Nernst equation|Nernst law]] breaks down under those conditions. Various factors contribute to this. It cannot be assumed that [[liquid junction potential]]s are independent of pH.<ref name=Feldman>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ac60120a014|title=Use and Abuse of pH measurements|journal=Analytical Chemistry|author=Feldman, Isaac |volume=28|pages=1859–1866|year=1956|issue=12}}</ref> Also, extreme pH implies that the solution is concentrated, so electrode potentials are affected by [[ionic strength]] variation. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by \"alkaline error\", because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in the solution.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}}, Section 13.19 The glass electrode</ref> Specially constructed electrodes are available which partly overcome these problems.\n\nRunoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some very low pH values.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nordstrom |first1=D.

Hydrogen ion activity, ''a<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub>'', can be defined<ref name=\"GoldBook\">{{GoldBookRef|title=activity (relative activity), ''a''|file=A00115}}</ref><ref name=\"GreenBook\">{{GreenBookRef2nd|pages=49–50}}</ref> as:\n:<math chem>a_\\ce{H+} = \\exp\\left (\\frac{\\mu_\\ce{H+} - \\mu^{\\ominus}_\\ce{H+}}{RT}\\right )</math>\nwhere ''μ''<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub> is the [[chemical potential]] of the hydrogen ion, <math chem>\\mu^{\\ominus}_\\ce{H+}</math> is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state, ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature]]. Therefore, pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly due to different solvated proton ions such as lyonium ions, requiring an intersolvent scale which involves the transfer activity coefficient of [[lyonium ion|hydronium/lyonium ion]].\n\npH is an example of an [[acidity function]]. Other acidity functions can be defined. For example, the [[Hammett acidity function]], ''H''<sub>0</sub>, has been developed in connection with [[superacid]]s.\n\n===Unified absolute pH scale===\nThe concept of \"unified pH scale\" has been developed on the basis of the absolute chemical potential of the proton. This model uses the [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid–base]] definition. This scale applies to liquids, gases and even solids.<ref name=\"Krossing\">{{cite journal | last1 = Himmel | first1 = D. | last2 = Goll | first2 = S.

When an [[acid]] is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7 (25&nbsp;°C). When a [[base (chemistry)|base]], or [[alkali]], is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as [[hydrochloric acid]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>−3</sup> has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as [[sodium hydroxide]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>−3</sup>, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration.\n\nThe pH of neutrality is not exactly 7 (25&nbsp;°C), although this is a good approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>−</sup>] (or the activities are equal). Since [[self-ionization of water]] holds the product of these concentration [H<sup>+</sup>]&times;[OH<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>w</sub>, it can be seen that at neutrality [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>−</sup>] = {{radic|K<sub>w</sub>}}, or pH = pK<sub>w</sub>/2. pK<sub>w</sub> is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] in pure water are both neutral, since [[Self-ionization of water|dissociation of water]] produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on [[ionic strength]], so K<sub>w</sub> varies with ionic strength.\n\nIf pure water is exposed to air it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from the air, which is then slowly converted into [[bicarbonate]] and hydrogen ions (essentially creating [[carbonic acid]]).\n:<chem>CO2 + H2O <=> HCO3^- + H+</chem>\n\n===pH in soil===\n\n====Classification of soil pH ranges====\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]], formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows:\n<ref>{{cite web|author=Soil Survey Division Staff|url=http://soils.usda.gov/technical/manual/contents/chapter3.html |title=Soil survey manual.1993.

These solutions have a relatively low [[ionic strength]] (≈0.1) compared to that of seawater (≈0.7), and, as a consequence, are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic strength differences cause changes in [[standard electrode potential|electrode potential]]. To resolve this problem, an alternative series of buffers based on [[artificial seawater]] was developed.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0011-7471(73)90101-0|author=Hansson, I.|year=1973|title=A new set of pH-scales and standard buffers for seawater|journal=Deep-Sea Research|volume=20|pages=479–491|issue=5|bibcode=1973DSROA..20..479H}}</ref> This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred to as the 'total scale', often denoted as pH<sub>T</sub>.

Resulting in the following expression for [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub>:\n\n:[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=−}}] + [HF]\n\nHowever, the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium. In seawater, for instance, sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (>400 times) than those of fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small.\n\nThe following three equations summarise the three scales of pH:\n\n:pH<sub>F</sub> = − log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub>\n:pH<sub>T</sub> = − log ( [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=−}}] ) = − log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>T</sub>\n:pH<sub>SWS</sub> = − log ( [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=−}}] + [HF] ) = − log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub>\n\nIn practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their values by up to 0.12 pH units, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean's [[Total inorganic carbon|carbonate system]].<ref name=zeebe /> Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions, the free scale is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales. Because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion, the total and seawater scales differ only very slightly.\n\n===Living systems===\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+pH in living systems<ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach|last=Boron|first=Walter, F.|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4160-2328-9|author2=Boulpaep, E.L.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The most common disorder in acid-base homeostasis is [[acidosis]], which means an acid overload in the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35. [[Alkalosis]] is the opposite condition, with blood pH being excessively high.\n\nThe pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.365. This value is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. [[Dental plaque|Plaque]] can create a local acidic environment that can result in [[tooth decay]] by demineralization.

The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution. For strong acids and bases no calculations are necessary except in extreme situations. The pH of a solution containing a weak acid requires the solution of a [[quadratic equation]]. The pH of a solution containing a weak base may require the solution of a [[cubic equation]]. The general case requires the solution of a set of [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s.\n\nA complicating factor is that water itself is a weak acid and a weak base (see [[amphoterism]]). It [[self-ionization of water|dissociates]] according to the equilibrium\n:<chem>2H2O <=> H3O+ (aq) + OH^-(aq)</chem>\nwith a [[acid dissociation constant|dissociation constant]], {{mvar|K<sub>w</sub>}} defined as\n:<math chem>K_w = \\ce{[H+][OH^-]}</math>\nwhere [H<sup>+</sup>] stands for the concentration of the aqueous [[hydronium ion]] and [OH<sup>−</sup>] represents the concentration of the [[hydroxide ion]]. This equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is extremely low.\n\n===Strong acids and bases===\n[[Strong acid]]s and [[Strong base|bases]] are compounds that, for practical purposes, are completely dissociated in water. Under normal circumstances this means that the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic solution can be taken to be equal to the concentration of the acid. The pH is then equal to minus the logarithm of the concentration value. [[Hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) is an example of a strong acid. The pH of a 0.01M solution of HCl is equal to −log<sub>10</sub>(0.01), that is, pH = 2. [[Sodium hydroxide]], NaOH, is an example of a strong base. The p[OH] value of a 0.01M solution of NaOH is equal to −log<sub>10</sub>(0.01), that is, p[OH] = 2. From the definition of p[OH] above, this means that the pH is equal to about 12. For solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations the self-ionization equilibrium must be taken into account.\n\nSelf-ionization must also be considered when concentrations are extremely low. Consider, for example, a solution of hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 5×10<sup>−8</sup>M.  The simple procedure given above would suggest that it has a pH of 7.3. This is clearly wrong as an acid solution should have a pH of less than 7. Treating the system as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and the [[amphoteric]] substance water, a pH of 6.89 results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=Chris|title=pH calculation of a very small concentration of a strong acid.|url=http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|accessdate=13 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708062942/http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Weak acids and bases===\n\nA weak acid  or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism.\n:<math chem>\\begin{cases}\n\\ce{Acid:} & \\ce{HA <=> H+ + A^-}\\\\\n\\ce{Base:} & \\ce{HA+ <=> H+ + A}\n\\end{cases}</math>\nFirst, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac \\ce{[H] [A]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nand its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so, there are three unknown concentrations, [HA], [H<sup>+</sup>] and [A<sup>−</sup>] to determine by calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to apply the law of  [[mass conservation]] in terms of the two \"reagents\" H and A.\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{A} = \\ce{[A]}  +  \\ce{[HA]}</math>\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{H} = \\ce{[H]}  +  \\ce{[HA]}</math>\nC stands for [[analytical concentration]]. In some texts, one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below. Together with the equation defining K<sub>a</sub>, there are now three equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water C<sub>A</sub> = C<sub>H</sub> = C<sub>a</sub>, the concentration of the acid, so [A] = [H]. After some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.\n:<math chem>[\\ce H]^2 + K_a[\\ce H] - K_a C_a = 0</math>\nSolution of this [[quadratic equation]] gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p[H] or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an [[ICE table]] which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional  (strong) acid or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when C<sub>A</sub> ≠ C<sub>H</sub>.\n\nFor example, what is the pH of a 0.01M solution of [[benzoic acid]], pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.19?\n\n* Step 1: <math>K_a = 10^{-4.19} = 6.46\\times10^{-5}</math>\n* Step 2: Set up the quadratic equation. <math chem>[\\ce{H}]^2 + 6.46\\times 10^{-5}[\\ce{H}] - 6.46\\times 10^{-7} = 0 </math>\n* Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation. <math chem>[\\ce{H+}] = 7.74\\times 10^{-4};\\quad \\mathrm{pH} = 3.11</math>\nFor alkaline solutions an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation for hydrogen. Since addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-ionization equilibrium to be equal to <math chem>\\frac{K_w}\\ce{[H+]}</math>\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{H} = \\frac{[\\ce H] + [\\ce{HA}] -K_w}\\ce{[H]}</math>\nIn this case the resulting equation in [H] is a cubic equation.\n\n===General method===\nSome systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Billo |first1=E.J. |title= EXCEL for Chemists|edition= 3rd |year= 2011|publisher= Wiley-VCH|isbn= 978-0-470-38123-6}}</ref> With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as A<sub>p</sub>B<sub>q</sub>H<sub>r</sub>,the following general method can be used to calculate the pH of a solution.

Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used.\n\nThere are 3 [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s in the three unknowns, [A], [B] and [H]. Because the equations are non-linear, and because concentrations may range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this formalism, is a key element in the [[determination of equilibrium constants]] by potentiometric titration.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alkaline diet]]\n* [[Arterial blood gas]]\n* [[decibel|Bel]]\n* [[Chemical equilibrium]]\n* [[pCO2]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|pH}}\n*[http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c123/ph.html The pH Scale]\n*[http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/pdf/c1xacid2.pdf Chem1 Virtual Textbook, Acid-base Equilibria and Calculations]\n*[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa012803a.htm Red Cabbage pH Indicator]\n*[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/food-ph-d_403.html Food and Foodstuff – pH Values]\n*[http://www.aqion.onl Online pH Calculator for about 100 inorganic Acids, Bases, and Salts]\n\n{{Wastewater}}{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ph}}\n[[Category:Acid–base chemistry]]\n[[Category:Equilibrium chemistry]]\n[[Category:Units of measurement]]\n[[Category:Water quality indicators]]\n[[Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement]]\n[[Category:General chemistry]]"

While all of these choices are constrained by considerations of functionality, usability, compatibility, safety or cost, there usually remains considerable leeway in the ''exact'' choice for many dimensions.\n\nPreferred numbers serve two purposes:\n# Using them increases the probability of compatibility between objects designed at different times by different people. In other words, it is one tactic among many in [[standardization]], whether within a company or within an industry, and it is usually desirable in industrial contexts (unless the goal is [[vendor lock-in]] or [[planned obsolescence]])\n# They are chosen such that when a product is manufactured in many different sizes, these will end up roughly equally spaced on a [[logarithmic scale]]. They therefore help to minimize the number of different sizes that need to be manufactured or kept in stock.\n\nPreferred numbers represent preferences of simple numbers (such as 1, 2, and 5) multiplied by the powers of a convenient basis, usually 10.<ref name=\"GOVPUB-C13\"/>\n\n==Renard numbers==\n{{Main|Renard series}}\n\nIn 1870 [[Charles Renard]] proposed a set of preferred numbers.<ref name=\"Sizes_2014\"/> His system was adopted in 1952 as international standard [[ISO 3]].<ref name=\"ISO_3_1973\"/> Renard's system divides the interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps, leading to the R5, R10, R20 and R40 scales, respectively. The factor between two consecutive numbers in a [[Renard series]] is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), which leads to a [[geometric sequence]]. This way, the maximum [[relative error]] is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10.\n\n=={{anchor|1-2-5 series}} 1–2–5 series==\nIn applications for which the R5 series provides a too fine graduation, the 1–2–5 series\nis sometimes used as a cruder alternative. It is effectively an R3 series rounded to one significant digit:\n\n:… 0.1 0.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 …\n\nThis series covers a [[decade (log scale)|decade]] (1:10 ratio) in three steps. Adjacent values differ by factors 2 or 2.5. Unlike the Renard series, the 1–2–5 series has not been formally adopted as an [[international standard]]. However, the Renard series R10 can be used to extend the 1–2–5 series to a finer graduation.\n\nThis series is used to define the scales for graphs and for instruments that display in a two-dimensional form with a graticule, such as [[oscilloscope#Graticule|oscilloscopes]].\n\nThe [[denomination (currency)|denominations]] of most modern [[Currency|currencies]], notably the [[euro]] and [[British pound]], follow a 1–2–5 series. The United States and Canada follow the approximate 1–2–5 series 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 (cents), $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100. The {{1/4}}–{{1/2}}–1 series (… 0.1 0.25 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 …) is also used by currencies derived from the former [[Dutch gulden]] ([[Aruban florin]], [[Netherlands Antillean gulden]], [[Surinamese dollar]]), some Middle Eastern currencies ([[Iraqi dinar|Iraqi]] and [[Jordanian dinar|Jordanian]] dinars, [[Lebanese pound]], [[Syrian pound]]), and the [[Seychellois rupee]]. However, newer notes introduced in Lebanon and Syria due to inflation follow the standard 1–2–5 series instead.\n\n==Convenient numbers==\n{{Main|Convenient numbers}}\n\nIn the 1970s the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS) defined a set of convenient numbers to ease [[metrication in the United States]]. This system of metric values was described as [[#1–2–5 series|1–2–5 series]] in reverse, with assigned preferences for those numbers which are multiples of 5, 2, and 1 (plus their powers of 10), excluding linear dimensions above 100&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"GOVPUB-C13\"/>\n\n==E-series==\n{{Main|E-series of preferred numbers}}\nThe E-series is another system of preferred numbers. It consists of the [[E1 series (preferred numbers)|E1]], [[E3 series (preferred numbers)|E3]], [[E6 series (preferred numbers)|E6]], [[E12 series (preferred numbers)|E12]], [[E24 series (preferred numbers)|E24]], [[E48 series (preferred numbers)|E48]], [[E96 series (preferred numbers)|E96]] and [[E192 series (preferred numbers)|E192]] series. Based on some of the existing manufacturing conventions, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) began work on a new international standard in 1948.<ref name=\"IEC_60063_1952\"/> The first version of this [[IEC&nbsp;63]] (renamed into [[IEC&nbsp;60063]] in 2007) was released in 1952.<ref name=\"IEC_60063_1952\"/>\n\nIt works similarly to the Renard series, except that it subdivides the interval from 1 to 10 into 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 or 192 steps. These subdivisions ensure that when some arbitrary value is replaced with the nearest preferred number, the maximum relative error will be on the order of 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, etc.\n\nUse of the E-series is mostly restricted to [[electronics|electronic parts]] like resistors, capacitors, inductors and Zener diodes. Commonly produced dimensions for other types of electrical components are either chosen from the Renard series instead or are defined in relevant product standards (for example [[IEC 60228|wires]]).\n\n== Audio frequencies ==\nISO 266, Acoustics—Preferred frequencies, defines two different series of audio frequencies for use in acoustical measurements. Both series are referred to the standard reference frequency of 1000 Hz, and use the R10 [[Renard series]] from ISO 3, with one using powers of 10, and the other related to the definition of the octave as the frequency ratio 1:2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webshop.ds.dk/Files/Files/Products/18315_attachPV.pdf|title=ISO 266: Acoustics—Preferred frequencies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a set of nominal center frequencies for use in audio tests and audio test equipment is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Frequencies to be used in one-third octave analyzers in the audible range<ref>{{Cite book|title=Software-Based Acoustical Measurements|last=Miyara|first=Federico|publisher=Springer Nature|year=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55870-7|location=|pages=21}}</ref>\n!Nominal Center Frequency (Hz)\n|-\n|20\n|-\n|25\n|-\n|31.5\n|-\n|40\n|-\n|50\n|-\n|63\n|-\n|80\n|-\n|100\n|-\n|125\n|-\n|160\n|-\n|200\n|-\n|250\n|-\n|315\n|-\n|400\n|-\n|500\n|-\n|630\n|-\n|800\n|-\n|1000\n|-\n|1250\n|-\n|1600\n|-\n|2000\n|-\n|2500\n|-\n|3150\n|-\n|4000\n|-\n|5000\n|-\n|6300\n|-\n|8000\n|-\n|10000\n|-\n|12500\n|-\n|16000\n|-\n|20000\n|}\n\n== Computer engineering ==\nWhen dimensioning computer components, the powers of two are frequently used as preferred numbers:\n\n  1    2    4    8   16   32   64  128  256  512  1024 …\n\nWhere a finer grading is needed, additional preferred numbers are obtained by multiplying a power of two with a small odd integer:\n\n      1  2   4   8    16    32    64    128     256     512     1024       …\n (×3)      3   6   12    24    48    96     192     384     768     1536   …\n (×5)         5   10    20    40    80    160     320     640     1280     …\n (×7)           7   14    28    56    112     224     448     896     1792 …\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Preferred aspect ratios\n! !! 16: !! 15: !! 12:\n<!--| (2²)² || 3 × 5 || 2² × 3-->\n|-\n! :8 <!--|| 2³-->\n| 2:1 ||     || 3:2\n|-\n! :9<!--|| 3²-->\n|16:9 || 5:3 || 4:3\n|-\n! :10<!--|| 2 × 5-->\n| 8:5 || 3:2 || <!--not preferred-->\n|-\n! :12<!--|| 2² × 3-->\n| 4:3 || 5:4 || 1:1\n|}\nIn [[computer graphics]], widths and heights of [[Raster graphics|raster images]] are preferred to be multiples of 16, as many compression algorithms ([[JPEG]], [[MPEG]]) divide ''color'' images into square blocks of that size. Black-and-white JPEG images are divided into 8×8 blocks. Screen resolutions often follow the same principle. \nPreferred [[aspect ratio]]s have also an important influence here, e.g., 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:3, 5:4, 8:5, 16:9.\n\n== Paper documents, envelopes, and drawing pens ==\n{{Main|Paper size}}\nStandard metric paper sizes use the [[square root]] of two ({{sqrt|2}}) as factors between neighbouring dimensions rounded to the nearest mm ([[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] series, [[ISO 216]]). An A4 sheet for example has an aspect ratio very close to {{sqrt|2}} and an area very close to 1/16 square metre. An A5 is almost exactly half an A4, and has the same aspect ratio. The {{sqrt|2}} factor also appears between the standard pen thicknesses for technical drawings (0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00, 1.40, and 2.00&nbsp;mm). This way, the right pen size is available to continue a drawing that has been magnified to a different standard paper size.\n\n== Photography ==\nIn photography, aperture, exposure, and film speed generally follow powers of 2:\n\nThe aperture size controls how much light enters the camera. It is measured in [[F-number|f-stop]]s: {{f/|1.4}}, {{f/|2}}, {{f/|2.8}}, {{f/|4}}, etc. Full f-stops are a [[square root of 2]] apart. Digital cameras often subdivide these into thirds, so each f-stop is a sixth root of 2, rounded to two significant digits: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 4.0, etc.\n\nThe [[film speed]] is a measure of the film's sensitivity to light. It is expressed as ISO values such as \"ISO 100\". Measured film speeds are rounded to the nearest preferred number from a modified Renard series including 100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 320, 400, 500, 640, 800… This is the same as the R10′ rounded [[Renard series]], except for the use of 6.4 instead of 6.3, and for having more aggressive rounding below ISO 16. Film marketed to amateurs, however, uses a restricted series including only powers of two multiples of ISO 100: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200. Some low-end cameras can only reliably read these values from [[DX encoding|DX encoded]] film cartridges because they lack the extra electrical contacts that would be needed to read the complete series. Some digital cameras extend this binary series to values like 12800, 25600, etc. instead of the modified Renard values 12500, 25000, etc.\n\nThe [[shutter speed]] controls how long the camera records light. These are expressed as fractions of a second, roughly but not exactly based on powers of 2: 1 second, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|8}}, {{frac|1|15}}, {{frac|1|30}}, {{frac|1|60}}, {{frac|1|125}}, {{frac|1|250}}, {{frac|1|500}}, {{frac|1|1000}} of a second.\n\n==Retail packaging==\nIn some countries, consumer-protection laws restrict the number of different prepackaged sizes in which certain products can be sold, in order to make it easier for consumers to compare prices.\n\nAn example of such a regulation is the European Union directive on the volume of certain prepackaged liquids (75/106/EEC<ref name=\"EEC_106\"/>). It restricts the list of allowed wine-bottle sizes to 0.1, 0.25 ({{frac|1|4}}), 0.375 ({{frac|3|8}}), 0.5 ({{frac|1|2}}), 0.75 ({{frac|3|4}}), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 litres. Similar lists exist for several other types of products. They vary and often deviate significantly from any geometric series in order to accommodate traditional sizes when feasible. Adjacent package sizes in these lists differ typically by factors {{frac|2|3}} or {{frac|3|4}}, in some cases even {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|4|5}}, or some other ratio of two small integers.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Nominal size]]\n* [[Convenient number]]\n* [[Nominal impedance]]\n* [[Preferred metric sizes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"GOVPUB-C13\">{{cite web |author-first=Hans J. |author-last=Milton |id=NBS Technical Note 990 (Code: NBTNAE) |title=The Selection of Preferred Metric Values for Design and Construction |date=December 1978 |location=Washington, USA |publisher=[[The National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS) |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-f5fea679df4c3a1c2e3e1dd63488707c/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-f5fea679df4c3a1c2e3e1dd63488707c.pdf |access-date=2017-11-01 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101233709/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-f5fea679df4c3a1c2e3e1dd63488707c/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-f5fea679df4c3a1c2e3e1dd63488707c.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Sizes_2014\">{{cite web |title=preferred numbers |publisher=Sizes, Inc. |date=2014-06-10 |orig-year=2000 |url=http://sizes.com/numbers/preferred_numbers.htm |access-date=2017-11-01 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101233141/https://sizes.com/numbers/preferred_numbers.htm |archive-date=2017-11-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"EEC_106\">{{cite web |title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 19 December 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making-up by volume of certain prepackaged liquids (75/106/EEC) |date=2004-05-01 |orig-year=1974-12-19 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/consleg/1975/L/01975L0106-20040501-en.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516040109/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/consleg/1975/L/01975L0106-20040501-en.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEC_60063_1952\">{{cite book |title=IEC 60063:1952 - Series of preferred values and their associated tolerances for resistors and capacitors |date=2007 |orig-year=1952-01-01 |edition=1.0 |publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) |url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/12583 |access-date=2017-07-11 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101160911/https://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/xpPublication.xsp?Open&pubid=12583&test&SessionID=EV3AV7TCL8 |archive-date=2017-11-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ISO_3_1973\">{{cite book |title=ISO 3:1973-04 - Preferred numbers - Series of preferred numbers |date=April 1973 |publisher=[[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/3564.html |access-date=2017-11-02 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102224515/https://www.iso.org/standard/3564.html |archive-date=2017-11-02}} (Replaced: {{cite book |title=ISO Recommendation R3-1954 - Preferred Numbers - Series of Preferred Numbers |date=July 1954}} (1953))</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |author-first1=Clarence Floyd |author-last1=Hirshfeld |author-link1=Clarence Floyd Hirshfeld |author-first2=C.

The factor between two consecutive numbers in a Renard series is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), which leads to a [[geometric sequence]]. This way, the maximum [[relative error]] is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. One application of the Renard series of numbers is to current rating of electric fuses.\n\n== Base series ==\n\nThe most basic R5 series consists of these five rounded numbers, which are powers of the fifth root of 10, rounded to two digits. Note that the Renard numbers are not always rounded to the closest three-digit number to the theoretical geometric sequence:\n\n:R5: 1.00 1.60 2.50 4.00 6.30\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* If some design constraints were assumed so that the two screws in the gadget should be placed between 32&nbsp;mm and 55&nbsp;mm apart, the resulting length would be 40&nbsp;mm, because 4 is in the R5 series of preferred numbers.\n* If a set of nails with lengths between roughly 15 and 300&nbsp;mm should be produced, then the application of the R5 series would lead to a product repertoire of 16&nbsp;mm, 25&nbsp;mm, 40&nbsp;mm, 63&nbsp;mm, 100&nbsp;mm, 160&nbsp;mm, and 250&nbsp;mm long nails.\n* If [[English wine cask units|traditional English wine cask sizes]] had been metricated, rundlet (68 liters), barrel (119 liters), tierce (159 liters), hogshead (239 liters), puncheon (318 liters), butt (477 liters) and tun (954 liters) could have become 63 (or 60 by R″5), 100, 160 (or 150), 250, 400, 630 (or 600) and 1000 liters, respectively.\n\n== Alternative series ==\n\nIf a finer resolution is needed, another five numbers are added to the series, one after each of the original R5 numbers, and one ends up with the R10 series. These are rounded to a multiple of 0.05. Where an even finer grading is needed, the R20, R40, and R80 series can be applied. The R20 series is usually rounded to a multiple of 0.05, and the R40 and R80 values interpolate between the R20 values, rather than being powers of the 80th root of 10 rounded correctly. In the table below, the additional R80 values are written to the right of the R40 values in the column named \"R80 add'l\". The R40 numbers 3.00 and 6.00 are higher than they \"should\" be by interpolation, in order to give rounder numbers.\n\nIn some applications more rounded values are desirable, either because the numbers from the normal series would imply an unrealistically high accuracy, or because an integer value is needed (e.g., the number of teeth in a gear). For these needs, more rounded versions of the Renard series have been defined in ISO&nbsp;3. In the table below, rounded values that differ from their less rounded counterparts are shown in bold.\n\n{| class=\"toptextcells\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| least rounded\n|-\n!

It makes no difference whether the Renard numbers are used with [[metre]]s or [[millimetre]]s. But one would need to use an appropriate number base to avoid ending up with two incompatible sets of nicely spaced dimensions, if for instance they were applied with both [[inch]]es and [[foot (unit)|feet]]. In the case of inches and feet a root of 12 would be desirable, that is, {{radic|12|''n''}} where ''n'' is the desired number of divisions within the major step size of twelve. Similarly a base of two, eight, or sixteen would fit nicely with the binary units commonly found in computer science.\n\nEach of the Renard sequences can be reduced to a subset by taking every ''n''th value in a series, which is designated by adding the number ''n'' after a slash.<ref name=\"Sizes_2014\"/> For example, \"R10″/3 (1…1000)\" designates a series consisting of every third value in the R″10 series from 1 to 1000, that is, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120, 250, 500, 1000.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Preferred numbers]]\n*[[Preferred metric sizes]]\n*[[1-2-5 series]]\n*[[E series (preferred numbers)]]\n*[[Logarithm]]\n*[[Decibel]]\n*[[Neper]]\n*[[Phon]]\n*[[Nominal Pipe Size]] (NPS)\n*[[Geometric progression]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"ISO_3_1973\">{{cite book |title=ISO 3:1973-04 - Preferred Numbers - Series of Preferred Numbers |date=April 1973 |publisher=[[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=3564 |access-date=2016-12-18}} (Replaced: {{cite book |title=ISO Recommendation R3-1954 - Preferred Numbers - Series of Preferred Numbers |date=July 1954}} (July 1953))</ref>\n<ref name=\"ISO_17_1973\">{{cite book |title=ISO 17:1973-04 - Guide to the use of preferred numbers and of series of preferred numbers |date=April 1973 |publisher=[[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/3602.html |access-date=2017-11-02 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102224012/https://www.iso.org/standard/3602.html |archive-date=2017-11-02 |quote=[…] Preferred numbers were first utilized in France at the end of the nineteenth century. From 1877 to 1879, Captain Charles Renard, an officer in the engineer corps, made a rational study of the elements necessary in the construction of […] aircraft. He computed the specifications […] according to a grading system […]. Recognizing the advantage to be derived from the geometrical progression, he adopted […] a grading system […] that would yield a tenth multiple of the value […] after every fifth step of the series […] Renard's theory was to substitute […] more rounded but […] practical values […] as a power of 10, positive, nil or negative. He thus obtained […] 10 16 25 40 63 100 […] continued in both directions […] by the symbol R5 […] the R10, R20, R40 series were formed, each adopted ratio being the square root of the preceding one […] The first standardization drafts were drawn up on these bases in Germany by the Normenausschuss der Deutschen Industrie on 13 April 1920, and in France by the Commission permanente de standardisation in document X of 19 December 1921. […] the commission of standardization in the Netherlands proposed their unification […] reached in 1931 […] in June 1932, the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations organized an international meeting in Milan, where the ISA Technical Committee 32, Preferred numbers, was set up and its Secretariat assigned to France. On 19 September 1934, the ISA Technical Committee 32 held a meeting in Stockholm; sixteen nations were represented: Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.S.S.R. With the exception of the Spanish, Hungarian and Italian […] the other delegations accepted the draft […] Japan communicated […] its approval […] the international recommendation was laid down in ISA Bulletin 11 (December 1935).

      "text": "{{about||the American seismologist|Charles Richter|a review of different magnitude scales|seismic magnitude scales}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Earthquakes}}\nThe so-called '''Richter magnitude scale''' – more accurately, ''Richter&#39;s magnitude scale'', or just ''Richter magnitude'' – for measuring the strength (\"size\") of earthquakes refers to the original \"magnitude scale\" developed by [[Charles F. Richter]] and presented in his landmark 1935 paper, and later revised and renamed the '''Local magnitude scale''', denoted as \"ML\" or \"M<sub>L</sub>\". Because of various shortcomings of the ML scale most seismological authorities now use other scales, such as the [[moment magnitude scale]] ({{M|w}}), to report earthquake magnitudes, but much of the news media still refers to these as \"Richter\" magnitudes. All magnitude scales retain the [[logarithm]]ic character of the original, and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:CharlesRichter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Francis Richter]] (circa 1970)]]\nPrior to the development of the magnitude scale the only measure of an earthquake's strength or \"size\" was a subjective assessment of the intensity of shaking observed near the [[epicenter]] of the earthquake, categorized by various [[seismic intensity scales]] such as the [[Rossi-Forel scale]].  In 1883 [[John Milne]] surmised that the shaking of large earthquakes might generate waves detectable around the globe, and in 1899 E. Von Rehbur Paschvitz observed in Germany seismic waves attributable to an earthquake in Tokyo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|p=47}}.</ref> In the 1920s [[Harry O. Wood]] and [[John August Anderson|John A. Anderson]] developed the [[Wood–Anderson seismograph]], one of the first practical instruments for recording seismic waves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2007|p=}};</ref> Wood then built, under the auspices of the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]], a network of seismographs stretching across [[Southern California]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2007|p=57}}.</ref> He also recruited the young and unknown Charles Richter to measure the seismograms and locate the earthquakes generating the seismic waves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2007|pp=57, 116}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1931 [[Kiyoo Wadati]] showed how he had measured, for several strong earthquakes in Japan, the amplitude of the shaking observed at various distances from the epicenter. He then plotted the logarithm of the amplitude against the distance, and found a series of curves that showed a rough correlation with the estimated magnitudes of the earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|p=2}}.</ref> Richter resolved some difficulties with this method,<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|pp=1–5}}.</ref> then, using data collected by his colleague [[Beno Gutenberg]], produced similar curves, confirming that they could be used to compare the relative magnitudes of different earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|pp=2–3}}.</ref>\n\nTo produce a practical method of assigning an absolute measure of magnitude required additional developments. First, to span the wide range of possible values Richter adopted Gutenberg's suggestion of a [[logarithm]]ic scale, where each step represents a tenfold increase of magnitude, similar to the magnitude scale used by astronomers for star brightness.<ref>[pending]</ref> Second, he wanted a magnitude of zero to be around the limit of human perceptibility.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|p=14}}: {{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1936|p=183}}.</ref> Third, he specified the Wood–Anderson seismograph as the standard instrument for producing seismograms. Magnitude was then defined as \"the logarithm of the maximum trace amplitude, expressed in [[microns]]\", measured at a distance of 100&nbsp;km.  The scale was calibrated by defining a magnitude 3 shock as one that produces (at a distance of 100&nbsp;km) a maximum amplitude of 1&nbsp;micron (1&nbsp;µm, or 0.001&nbsp;millimeters) on a seismogram recorded by a Wood–Anderson torsion seismograph.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|p=5}}. See also {{Harvnb|Hutton|Boore|1987|p=1}}; {{Harvnb|Chung|Bernreuter|1980|p=10}}.</ref> Finally, Richter calculated a table of distance corrections,<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|p=6}}, Table I.</ref> in that for distances less than 200 kilometers<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|p=32}}.</ref> the attenuation is strongly affected by the structure and properties of the regional geology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chung|Bernreuter|1980|p=5}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Richter presented the resulting scale in 1935 he called it (at the suggestion of Harry Wood) simply a \"magnitude\" scale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935|p=1}}. His article is titled: \"An Instrumental Earthquake Magnitude Scale\".</ref> \"Richter magnitude\" appears to have originated when Perry Byerly told the press that the scale was Richter's, and \"should be referred to as such.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2007|pp=123–124}}.</ref> In 1956 Gutenberg and Richter, while still referring to \"magnitude scale\", labelled it \"local magnitude\", with the symbol {{M|L}}, to distinguish it from two other scales they had developed, the [[surface wave magnitude]] (M<sub>S</sub>) and [[body wave magnitude]] (M<sub>B</sub>)<!-- These are non-standard: do not use the \"M\" template here. --> scales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gutenberg|Richter|1956b|p=30}}.</ref>\n\n==Details==\nThe Richter scale was defined in 1935 for particular circumstances and instruments; the particular circumstances refer to it being defined for Southern California and \"implicitly incorporates the [[attenuation|attenuative]] properties of Southern California crust and mantle.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/mineblast/definitions.php |title=Explanation of Bulletin Listings, USGS}}</ref> The particular instrument used would become saturated by strong earthquakes and unable to record high values. The scale was replaced in the 1970s by the [[moment magnitude scale]] (MMS, symbol {{M|w}}); for earthquakes adequately measured by the Richter scale, numerical values are approximately the same. Although values measured for earthquakes now are <math>M_w</math> (MMS), they are frequently reported by the press as Richter values, even for earthquakes of magnitude over 8, when the Richter scale becomes meaningless.\n\nThe Richter and MMS scales measure the energy released by an earthquake; another scale, the [[Mercalli intensity scale]], classifies earthquakes by their ''effects'', from detectable by instruments but not noticeable, to catastrophic. The energy and effects are not necessarily strongly correlated; a shallow earthquake in a populated area with soil of certain types can be far more intense in effects than a much more energetic deep earthquake in an isolated area.\n\nSeveral scales have historically been described as the \"Richter scale\", especially the ''local magnitude'' <math>M_\\text{L}</math> and the surface wave <math>M_\\text{s}</math> scale. In addition, the ''body wave magnitude'', <math>m_\\text{b}</math>, and the ''moment magnitude'', <math>M_\\text{w}</math>, abbreviated MMS, have been widely used for decades. A couple of new techniques to measure magnitude are in the development stage by seismologists.\n\nAll magnitude scales have been designed to give numerically similar results. This goal has been achieved well for <math>M_\\text{L}</math>, <math>M_\\text{s}</math>, and <math>M_\\text{w}</math>.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richter|1935}}.</ref><ref>Richter, C.F., \"Elementary Seismology\", ed, Vol., W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1956.</ref> The <math>m_\\text{b}</math> scale gives somewhat different values than the other scales. The reason for so many different ways to measure the same thing is that at different distances, for different [[hypocenter|hypocentral]] depths, and for different earthquake sizes, the amplitudes of different types of elastic waves must be measured.\n\n<math>M_\\text{L}</math> is the scale used for the majority of earthquakes reported (tens of thousands) by local and regional seismological observatories. For large earthquakes worldwide, the moment magnitude scale (MMS) is most common, although <math>M_\\text{s}</math> is also reported frequently.\n\nThe [[seismic moment]], '''''<math>M_o</math>''''', is proportional to the area of the rupture times the average slip that took place in the earthquake, thus it measures the physical size of the event. <math>M_\\text{w}</math> is derived from it empirically as a quantity without units, just a number designed to conform to the <math>M_\\text{s}</math> scale.<ref>Hanks, T. C. and H. Kanamori, 1979, \"Moment magnitude scale\", ''Journal of Geophysical Research,'' 84, B5, 2348.</ref> A spectral analysis is required to obtain <math>M_o</math>, whereas the other magnitudes are derived from a simple measurement of the amplitude of a specifically defined wave.\n\nAll scales, except <math>M_\\text{w}</math>, saturate for large earthquakes, meaning they are based on the amplitudes of waves which have a wavelength shorter than the rupture length of the earthquakes. These short waves (high frequency waves) are too short a yardstick to measure the extent of the event. The resulting effective upper limit of measurement for <math>M_L</math> is about 7 and about 8.5<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov.hk/education/edu02rga/article/ele-EarthquakeMagnetude_e.htm |title=On Earthquake Magnitudes |first=Wang-chun |last=Woo |date=September 2012 |publisher=Hong Kong Observatory |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> for <math>M_\\text{s}</math>.<ref name=\"Local magnitude\">{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/qfaults/glossary.php |title=Richter scale |work=Glossary |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |date=March 31, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nNew techniques to avoid the saturation problem and to measure magnitudes rapidly for very large earthquakes are being developed.

The original formula is:<ref>{{cite journal\n | publisher=USGS\n | last=Ellsworth\n | first=William L.\n | url=http://www.johnmartin.com/earthquakes/eqsafs/safs_693.htm\n | title=The Richter Scale <math>M_\\text{L}</math>, from ''The San Andreas Fault System,'' California (Professional Paper 1515)\n | pages=c6, p177\n | year=1991\n | accessdate=2008-09-14\n}}\n</ref>\n\n:<math>M_\\mathrm{L} = \\log_{10} A - \\log_{10} A_\\mathrm{0}(\\delta) = \\log_{10} [A / A_\\mathrm{0}(\\delta)],\\ </math>\n\nwhere A is the maximum excursion of the Wood–Anderson seismograph, the empirical function A<sub>0</sub> depends only on the [[epicentral distance]] of the station, <math>\\delta</math>. In practice, readings from all observing stations are averaged after adjustment with station-specific corrections to obtain the <math>M_\\text{L}</math> value.\n\nBecause of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude; in terms of energy, each whole number increase corresponds to an increase of about 31.6 times the amount of energy released, and each increase of 0.2 corresponds to approximately a doubling of the energy released.\n\nEvents with magnitudes greater than 4.5 are strong enough to be recorded by a seismograph anywhere in the world, so long as its sensors are not located in the earthquake's [[Seismic shadowing|shadow]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe following describes the typical effects of earthquakes of various magnitudes near the epicenter. The values are typical only. They should be taken with extreme caution, since intensity and thus ground effects depend not only on the magnitude, but also on the distance to the epicenter, the depth of the earthquake's focus beneath the epicenter, the location of the epicenter and geological conditions (certain terrains can amplify seismic signals).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Magnitude\n!Description\n![[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]]\n!Average earthquake effects\n!Average frequency of occurrence globally (estimated)\n|-\n|1.0–1.9\n|[[Microearthquake|Micro]]\n|<span style=\"color:silver\">I</span>\n|Microearthquakes, not felt, or felt rarely.

In other words, the ratios of the [[frequency|frequencies]] of any adjacent pair of notes is the same, and, as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] is perceived roughly as the [[logarithm]] of frequency,<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Michael |title=Perceptual Foundations of Sound |url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~odonnell/Scholar/Work_in_progress/Digital_Sound_Modelling/lectnotes/node4.html |accessdate=2017-03-11}}</ref> equal perceived \"distance\" from every note to its nearest neighbor.\n\nIn equal temperament tunings, the generating interval is often found by dividing some larger desired interval, often the [[octave]] (ratio 2:1), into a number of smaller equal steps (equal frequency ratios between successive notes).\n\nIn [[classical music]] and Western music in general, the most common tuning system since the 18th century has been '''twelve-tone equal temperament''' (also known as '''12 equal temperament''', '''12-TET''' or '''12-ET'''), which divides the octave into 12 parts, all of which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], with a ratio equal to the 12th root of 2 ({{radic|2|12}} ≈ 1.05946). That resulting smallest interval, {{frac|12}} the width of an octave, is called a [[semitone]] or half step. In modern times, 12TET is usually tuned relative to a [[standard pitch]] of 440&nbsp;Hz, called [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], meaning one note, [[A (musical note)|A]], is tuned to 440 [[hertz]] and all other notes are defined as some multiple of semitones apart from it, either higher or lower in [[frequency]]. The standard pitch has not always been 440&nbsp;Hz. It has varied and generally risen over the past few hundred years.<ref>The History of Musical Pitch in Europe p493-511 Herman Helmholtz, Alexander J. Ellis ''On The Sensations of Tone'', Dover Publications, Inc., New York</ref>\n\nOther equal temperaments divide the octave differently. For example, some music has been written in [[19 equal temperament|19-TET]] and [[31 equal temperament|31-TET]].  Arabic music uses [[Arab tone system|24-TET]] as a notational convention. In [[Western world|Western countries]] the term ''equal temperament'', without qualification, generally means 12-TET. To avoid ambiguity between equal temperaments that divide the octave and those that divide some other interval (or that use an arbitrary generator without first dividing a larger interval), the term '''equal division of the octave''', or '''EDO''' is preferred for the former. According to this naming system, ''12-TET'' is called ''12-EDO'', ''31-TET'' is called ''31-EDO'', and so on.\n\nAn example of an equal temperament that finds its smallest interval by dividing an interval other than the octave into equal parts is the equal-tempered version of the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]], which divides the just interval of an octave and a fifth (ratio 3:1), called a \"tritave\" or a \"[[pseudo-octave]]\" in that system, into 13 equal parts.\n\nUnfretted [[string ensemble]]s, which can adjust the tuning of all notes except for [[Open string (music)|open strings]], and vocal groups, who have no mechanical tuning limitations, sometimes use a tuning much closer to [[just intonation]] for acoustic reasons. Other instruments, such as some [[Wind instruments|wind]], [[Keyboard instruments|keyboard]], and [[fret]]ted instruments, often only approximate equal temperament, where technical limitations prevent exact tunings. Some wind instruments that can easily and spontaneously bend their tone, most notably [[trombone]]s, use tuning similar to string ensembles and vocal groups.\n\n{{Wide image|EDO errors.png|700px|A comparison of equal temperaments between 10-TET and 60-TET on each main interval of small prime limits (red: 3/2, green: 5/4, blue: 7/4, yellow: 11/8, cyan: 13/8). Each colored graph shows how much error occurs (in cents) when each EDO approximates the corresponding just interval (the black line on the center). Two black curves surrounding the graph on both sides represent the maximum possible error, while the gray ones inside of them indicate the half of it.|400px|right}}\n\n\n== History ==\nThe two figures frequently credited with the achievement of exact calculation of equal temperament are [[Zhu Zaiyu]] (also romanized as Chu-Tsaiyu.

Among the 17th-century keyboard composers [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]] advocated equal temperament. Some theorists, such as [[Giuseppe Tartini]], were opposed to the adoption of equal temperament; they felt that degrading the purity of each chord degraded the aesthetic appeal of music, although [[Andreas Werckmeister]] emphatically advocated equal temperament in his 1707 treatise published posthumously.<ref>Andreas Werckmeister: Musicalische Paradoxal-Discourse, 1707</ref>\n\n[[J. S. Bach]] wrote ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' to demonstrate the musical possibilities of [[well temperament]], where in some keys the consonances are even more degraded than in equal temperament. It is possible that when composers and theoreticians of earlier times wrote of the moods and \"colors\" of the keys, they each described the subtly different dissonances made available within a particular tuning method. However, it is difficult to determine with any exactness the actual tunings used in different places at different times by any composer. (Correspondingly, there is a great deal of variety in the particular opinions of composers about the moods and colors of particular keys.){{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nTwelve-tone equal temperament took hold for a variety of reasons. It was a convenient fit for the existing keyboard design, and permitted total harmonic freedom at the expense of just a little impurity in every interval. This allowed greater expression through [[Modulation (music)|enharmonic modulation]], which became extremely important in the 18th century in music of such composers as [[Francesco Geminiani]], [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]], [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]] and [[Johann Gottfried Müthel]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe progress of equal temperament from the mid-18th century on is described with detail in quite a few modern scholarly publications: it was already the temperament of choice during the Classical era (second half of the 18th century),{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} and it became standard during the Early Romantic era (first decade of the 19th century),{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} except for organs that switched to it more gradually, completing only in the second decade of the 19th century.

Because the perceived identity of an interval depends on its [[ratio]], this scale in even steps is a [[geometric sequence]] of multiplications. (An [[arithmetic sequence]] of intervals would not sound evenly spaced, and would not permit transposition to different keys.) Specifically, the smallest [[Interval (music)|interval]] in an equal-tempered scale is the ratio:\n\n:<math>r^n = p</math>\n:<math>r = \\sqrt[n]{p}</math>\n\nwhere the ratio ''r'' divides the ratio ''p'' (typically the [[octave]], which is 2:1) into ''n'' equal parts. (''See [[#Twelve-tone equal temperament|Twelve-tone equal temperament]] below.'')\n\nScales are often measured in [[Cent (music)|cents]], which divide the octave into 1200 equal intervals (each called a cent). This [[logarithm]]ic scale makes comparison of different tuning systems easier than comparing ratios, and has considerable use in [[Ethnomusicology]]. The basic step in cents for any equal temperament can be found by taking the width of ''p'' above in cents (usually the octave, which is 1200 cents wide), called below ''w'', and dividing it into ''n'' parts:\n:<math>c = \\frac{w}{n}</math>\n\nIn musical analysis, material belonging to an equal temperament is often given an [[Musical notation#Integer notation|integer notation]], meaning a single integer is used to represent each pitch. This simplifies and generalizes discussion of pitch material within the temperament in the same way that taking the [[logarithm]] of a multiplication reduces it to addition. Furthermore, by applying the [[modular arithmetic]] where the modulus is the number of divisions of the octave (usually 12), these integers can be reduced to [[pitch class]]es, which removes the distinction (or acknowledges the similarity) between pitches of the same name, e.g. ''c'' is 0 regardless of octave register. The [[MIDI]] encoding standard uses integer note designations.\n\n=== General formulas for the equal-tempered interval ===\n{{Missing information|section|the general formulas for the equal-tempered interval|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Twelve-tone equal temperament ==\n{{anchor|12TET}}\n[[File:Monochord ET.png|thumb|One octave of 12-tet on a monochord]]\n\nIn twelve-tone equal temperament, which divides the octave into 12 equal parts, the width of a [[semitone]], i.e. the [[Interval ratio|frequency ratio]] of the interval between two adjacent notes, is the [[twelfth root of two]]:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt[12]{2} = 2^{\\frac{1}{12}} \\approx 1.059463</math>\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>e^{\\frac{1}{12} \\ln 2 } \\approx 1.059463</math>\n\nThis interval is divided into 100 [[cent (music)|cents]].\n\n=== Calculating absolute frequencies ===\n{{See also|Piano key frequencies}}\nTo find the frequency, ''P<sub>n</sub>'', of a note in 12-TET, the following definition may be used:\n\n:<math>P_{n} = P_{a}\\left( \\sqrt[12]{2} \\right)^{(n-a)}</math>\n\nIn this formula ''P<sub>n</sub>'' refers to the pitch, or frequency (usually in [[hertz]]), you are trying to find. ''P<sub>a</sub>'' refers to the frequency of a reference pitch. ''n'' and ''a'' refer to numbers assigned to the desired pitch and the reference pitch, respectively. These two numbers are from a list of consecutive integers assigned to consecutive semitones. For example, A<sub>4</sub> (the reference pitch) is the 49th key from the left end of a piano (tuned to [[A440 (pitch standard)|440Hz]]), and C<sub>4</sub> ([[middle C]]),and F#<sub>4</sub> are the 40th and 46th key respectively. These numbers can be used to find the frequency of C<sub>4</sub> and F#<sub>4</sub> :\n\n:<math>P_{40} = 440\\left( \\sqrt[12]{2} \\right)^{(40-49)} \\approx 261.626 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}</math>\n:<math>P_{46} = 440\\left(\\sqrt[12]{2} \\right)^{(46-49)} \\approx 369.994 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} </math>\n\n=== Historical comparison ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

Because a perfect fifth is in 3:2 relation with its base tone, and this interval is covered in 7 steps, each tone is in the ratio of {{radic|{{frac|3|2}}|7}} to the next (100.28 cents), which provides for a perfect fifth with ratio of 3:2 but a slightly widened octave with a ratio of ≈ 517:258 or ≈ 2.00388:1 rather than the usual 2:1 ratio, because twelve perfect fifths do not equal seven octaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aredem.online.fr/aredem/page_cordier.html |title=Le tempérament égal à quintes justes |last=Cordier |first=Serge |publisher=Association pour la Recherche et le Développement de la Musique |language=French |accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref> During actual play, however, the violinist chooses pitches by ear, and only the four unstopped pitches of the strings are guaranteed to exhibit this 3:2 ratio.\n\n==Other equal temperaments==<!--[[10 equal temperament]], etc. redirect directly here-->\n{{See also|Sonido 13}}\n\n=== 5 and 7 tone temperaments in ethnomusicology ===<!--[[7 equal temperament]] and [[5 equal temperament]] redirect directly here-->\n[[File:7-tet scale on C.png|thumb|300px|Approximation of 7-tet]]\n\nFive and seven tone equal temperament ('''5-TET''' {{audio|5-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} and '''7-TET'''{{audio|7-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} ), with 240 {{Audio|1 step in 5-et on C.mid|Play}} and 171 {{Audio|1 step in 7-et on C.mid|Play}} cent steps respectively, are fairly common.\n\nA [[Thai music|Thai]] xylophone measured by Morton (1974) \"varied only plus or minus 5 cents,\" from 7-TET.

It is now well-accepted that of the two primary tuning systems in gamelan music, [[slendro]] and [[pelog]], only slendro somewhat resembles five-tone equal temperament while pelog is highly unequal; however, Surjodiningrat et al.

Because 24 EDO contains all of the pitches of 12 EDO, plus new pitches halfway between each adjacent pair of 12 EDO pitches, they could employ the additional colors without losing any tactics available in 12-tone harmony. The fact that 24 is a multiple of 12 also made 24 EDO easy to achieve instrumentally by employing two traditional 12 EDO instruments purposely tuned a quarter-tone apart, such as two pianos, which also allowed each performer (or one performer playing a different piano with each hand) to read familiar 12-tone notation. Various composers including Charles Ives experimented with music for quarter-tone pianos.\n\n[[19 equal temperament|19 EDO]]\nis famous and some instruments are tuned in 19 EDO. It has slightly flatter perfect fifth (at 694 cents), but its major sixth are less than a single cent away from just intonation's major sixth (at 884 cents). Its [[perfect fourth]] (at 503 cents), is only 5 cents sharp than just intonation's and 3 cents sharp from 12-tet's.\n\n[[23 equal temperament|23 EDO]] is the largest EDO that fails to approximate the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 11th harmonics (3:2, 5:4, 7:4, 11:8) within 20 cents, making it attractive to microtonalists looking for unusual microtonal harmonic territory.\n\n27 EDO is the smallest EDO that uniquely represents all intervals involving the first eight harmonics. It tempers out the [[septimal comma]] but not the [[syntonic comma]].\n\n[[58 equal temperament|29 EDO]] is the lowest number of equal divisions of the octave that produces a better perfect fifth than 12 EDO. Its major third is roughly as inaccurate as 12-TET; however, it is tuned 14 cents flat rather than 14 cents sharp. It tunes the 7th, 11th, and 13th harmonics flat as well, by roughly the same amount. This means intervals such as 7:5, 11:7, 13:11, etc., are all matched extremely well in 29-TET.\n\n[[31 tone equal temperament|31 EDO]] was advocated by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Adriaan Fokker]]. 31 EDO has a slightly less accurate fifth than 12 EDO, but provides near-just major thirds, and provides decent matches for harmonics up to at least 13, of which the seventh harmonic is particularly accurate.\n\n[[34 equal temperament|34 EDO]] gives slightly less total combined errors of approximation to the 5-limit just ratios 3:2, 5:4, 6:5, and their inversions than 31 EDO does, although the approximation of 5:4 is worse. 34 EDO doesn't approximate ratios involving prime 7 well. It contains a 600-cent tritone, since it is an even-numbered EDO.\n\n[[41 equal temperament|41 EDO]] is the second lowest number of equal divisions that produces a better perfect fifth than 12 EDO. Its major third is more accurate than 12 EDO and 29 EDO, about 6 cents flat. It's not meantone, so it distinguishes 10:9 and 9:8, unlike 31edo. It is more accurate in 13-limit than 31edo.\n\n[[53 equal temperament|53 EDO]] is better at approximating the traditional [[just intonation|just]] consonances than 12, 19 or 31 EDO, but has had only occasional use. Its extremely good [[perfect fifth]]s make it interchangeable with an extended [[Pythagorean tuning]], but it also accommodates [[schismatic temperament]], and is sometimes used in [[Turkish music]] theory. It does not, however, fit the requirements of meantone temperaments, which put good thirds within easy reach via the cycle of fifths. In 53 EDO, the very consonant thirds would be reached instead by using a Pythagorean diminished fourth (C-F{{music|b}}), as it is an example of [[schismatic temperament]], just like 41 EDO. \n\n[[72 equal temperament|72 EDO]] approximates many [[just intonation]] intervals well, even into the 7-limit and 11-limit, such as 7:4, 9:7, 11:5, 11:6 and 11:7. 72 EDO has been taught, written and performed in practice by [[Joe Maneri]] and his students (whose atonal inclinations typically avoid any reference to [[just intonation]] whatsoever). It can be considered an extension of 12 EDO because 72 is a multiple of 12. 72 EDO has a smallest interval that is six times smaller than the smallest interval of 12 EDO and therefore contains six copies of 12 EDO starting on different pitches. It also contains three copies of 24 EDO and two copies of 36 EDO, which are themselves multiples of 12 EDO. 72 EDO has also been criticized for its redundancy by retaining the poor approximations contained in 12 EDO, despite not needing them for any lower limits of just intonation (e.g. 5-limit).\n\n[[96 equal temperament|96 EDO]] approximates all intervals within 6.25 cents, which is barely distinguishable. As an eightfold multiple of 12, it can be used fully like the common 12 EDO. It has been advocated by several composers, especially [[Julián Carrillo]] from 1924 to the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monzo |first1=Joe |title=Equal-Temperament |url=http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx#edo-table |website=Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory |publisher=Joe Monzo |accessdate=26 February 2019 |date=2005}}</ref>\n\nOther equal divisions of the octave that have found occasional use include, [[15 equal temperament|15 EDO]], [[17 equal temperament|17 EDO]], [[19 equal temperament|19 EDO]] and [[22 equal temperament|22 EDO]].\n\n2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665 and 15601 are [[denominator]]s of first [[convergent (continued fraction)|convergents]] of log{{sub|2}}(3), so 2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665 and 15601 [[twelfth (disambiguation)#Music|twelfths]] (and [[fifth (disambiguation)#Music|fifths]]), being in correspondent equal temperaments equal to an integer number of octaves, are better approximation of 2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665 and 15601 [[just intonation|just]] twelfths/fifths than for any equal temperaments with less tones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/665edo |title=665edo |publisher=xenoharmonic (microtonal wiki) |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convergents%28log2%283%29%2C+10%29 |title=convergents(log2(3), 10) |publisher=[[WolframAlpha]] |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref>\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 29, 41, 53, 200... {{OEIS|A060528}} is the sequence of divisions of octave that provide better and better approximations of the perfect fifth.

These were called ''[[alpha scale|alpha]]'', ''[[beta scale|beta]]'', and ''[[gamma scale|gamma]]''. They can be considered as equal divisions of the perfect fifth. Each of them provides a very good approximation of several just intervals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carlos |first1=Wendy |title=Three Asymmetric Divisions of the Octave |url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/resources/pitch.html |website=''wendycarlos.com'' |publisher=Serendip LLC |accessdate=2016-09-01}}</ref> Their step sizes:\n* ''alpha'': {{radic|{{frac|3|2}}|9}}  (78.0 cents) {{audio|Alpha scale step on C.mid|Play}}\n* ''beta'': {{radic|{{frac|3|2}}|11}}  (63.8 cents) {{audio|Beta scale step on C.mid|Play}}\n* ''gamma'': {{radic|{{frac|3|2}}|20}}  (35.1 cents) {{audio|Gamma scale step on C.mid|Play}}\nAlpha and Beta may be heard on the title track of her 1986 album ''[[Beauty in the Beast]]''.\n\n=== Proportions between semitone and whole tone ===\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}\nIn this section, ''semitone'' and ''whole tone'' may not have their usual 12-EDO meanings, as it discusses how they may be tempered in different ways from their just versions to produce desired relationships. Let the number of steps in a semitone be ''s'', and the number of steps in a tone be ''t''.\n\nThere is exactly one family of equal temperaments that fixes the semitone to any [[proper fraction]] of a whole tone, while keeping the notes in the right order (meaning that, for example, C, D, E, F, and F{{music|#}} are in ascending order if they preserve their usual relationships to C). That is, fixing ''q'' to a proper fraction in the relationship ''qt'' = ''s'' also defines a unique family of one equal temperament and its multiples that fulfil this relationship.\n\nFor example, where ''k'' is an integer, 12''k''-EDO sets ''q'' = {{frac|2}}, and 19''k''-EDO sets ''q'' = {{frac|3}}. The smallest multiples in these families (e.g. 12 and 19 above) has the additional property of having no notes outside the [[circle of fifths]]. (This is not true in general; in 24-EDO, the half-sharps and half-flats are not in the circle of fifths generated starting from C.) The extreme cases are 5''k''-EDO, where ''q'' = 0 and the semitone becomes a unison, and 7''k''-EDO, where ''q'' = 1 and the semitone and tone are the same interval.\n\nOnce one knows how many steps a semitone and a tone are in this equal temperament, one can find the number of steps it has in the octave. An equal temperament fulfilling the above properties (including having no notes outside the circle of fifths) divides the octave into 7''t'' − 2''s'' steps, and the perfect fifth into 4''t'' − ''s'' steps. If there are notes outside the circle of fifths, one must then multiply these results by ''n'', which is the number of nonoverlapping circles of fifths required to generate all the notes (e.g. two in 24-EDO, six in 72-EDO). (One must take the small semitone for this purpose: 19-EDO has two semitones, one being {{frac|3}} tone and the other being {{frac|2|3}}.)\n\nThe smallest of these families is 12''k''-EDO, and in particular, 12-EDO is the smallest equal temperament that has the above properties. Additionally, it also makes the semitone exactly half a whole tone, the simplest possible relationship. These are some of the reasons why 12-EDO has become the most commonly used equal temperament. (Another reason is that 12-EDO is the smallest equal temperament to closely approximate 5-limit harmony, the next-smallest being 19-EDO.)\n\nEach choice of fraction ''q'' for the relationship results in exactly one equal temperament family, but the converse is not true: 47-EDO has two different semitones, where one is {{frac|7}} tone and the other is {{frac|8|9}}, which are not complements of each other like in 19-EDO ({{frac|3}} and {{frac|2|3}}). Taking each semitone results in a different choice of perfect fifth.\n\n== Related tuning systems ==\n\n=== Regular diatonic tunings ===\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1}}[[File:Rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Figure 1: The [[regular diatonic tuning]]s continuum, which include many notable \"equal temperament\" tunings (Milne 2007).<ref>Milne, A., Sethares, W.A. and Plamondon, J.,[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 \"Isomorphic Controllers and Dynamic Tuning: Invariant Fingerings Across a Tuning Continuum\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109143142/http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 |date=2016-01-09 }}, ''Computer Music Journal'', Winter 2007, Vol. 31, No. 4, Pages 15-32.</ref>]]\nThe diatonic tuning in twelve equal can be generalized to any regular diatonic tuning dividing the octave as a sequence of steps TTSTTTS (or a rotation of it) with all the T's and all the S's the same size and the S's smaller than the T's. In twelve equal the S is the semitone and is exactly half the size of the tone T. When the S's reduce to zero the result is TTTTT or a five-tone equal temperament, As the semitones get larger, eventually the steps are all the same size, and the result is in seven tone equal temperament. These two endpoints are not included as regular diatonic tunings.\n\nThe notes in a regular diatonic tuning are connected together by a cycle of seven tempered fifths. The twelve-tone system similarly generalizes to a sequence CDCDDCDCDCDD (or a rotation of it) of chromatic and diatonic semitones connected together in a cycle of twelve fifths. In this case, seven equal is obtained in the limit as the size of C tends to zero and five equal is the limit as D tends to zero while twelve equal is of course the case C = D.\n\nSome of the intermediate sizes of tones and semitones can also be generated in equal temperament systems. For instance if the diatonic semitone is double the size of the chromatic semitone, i.e. D = 2*C the result is nineteen equal with one step for the chromatic semitone, two steps for the diatonic semitone and three steps for the tone and the total number of steps 5*T + 2*S = 15 + 4 = 19 steps. The resulting twelve-tone system closely approximates to the historically important 1/3 comma meantone.\n\nIf the chromatic semitone is two-thirds of the size of the diatonic semitone, i.e. C = (2/3)*D, the result is thirty one equal, with two steps for the chromatic semitone, three steps for the diatonic semitone, and five steps for the tone where 5*T + 2*S = 25 + 6 = 31 steps. The resulting twelve-tone system closely approximates to the historically important 1/4 comma meantone.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Just intonation]]\n* [[Musical acoustics]] (the physics of music)\n* [[Music and mathematics]]\n* [[Microtuner]]\n* [[Microtonal music]]\n* [[Piano tuning]]\n* [[List of meantone intervals]]\n* [[Diatonic and chromatic]]\n* [[Electronic tuner]]\n* [[Musical tuning]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Cho, Gene Jinsiong.

Each step represents a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|15}}, or 80 [[cent (music)|cents]] ({{audio|1 step in 15TET on C.mid|Play}}).  Because 15 factors into 3 times 5, it can be seen as being made up of three scales of 5 equal divisions of the octave, each of which resembles the [[Slendro]] scale in [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[gamelan]]. 15 equal temperament is not a [[meantone]] system.\n\n==History and use==\n\nGuitars have been constructed for 15-ET tuning.

The [[perfect fifth]] is more out of tune than in [[12 equal temperament|12-ET]], [[19 equal temperament|19-ET]], or [[22 equal temperament|22-ET]], and the major third in 15-ET is the same as the major third in 12-ET, but the other intervals matched are more in tune.  15-ET is the smallest tuning that matches the 11th harmonic at all and still has a usable perfect fifth, but its match to intervals utilizing the 11th harmonic is poorer than [[22 equal temperament|22-ET]], which also has more in-tune fifths and major thirds.\n\nAlthough it contains a perfect fifth as well as major and minor thirds, the remainder of the harmonic and melodic language of 15-ET is quite different from 12-ET, and thus 15-ET could be described as [[xenharmonic]].  Unlike 12-ET and 19-ET, 15-ET matches the 11:8 and 16:11 ratios.  15-ET also has a [[neutral second]] and [[septimal whole tone]]. To construct a major third in 15-ET, one must stack two intervals of different sizes, whereas one can divide both the minor third and perfect fourth into two equal intervals.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080704060740/http://sonic-arts.org/darreg/dar35.htm Ivor Darreg, \"15-TONE SCALE SYSTEM\" (1991)], ''Sonic-Arts.org''.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121025054304/http://home.comcast.net/~brentishere/15noteequaltempermenttutorial.html Brewt: \"Fifteen note equal temperament tutorial\"].\n* [https://noahjordan.ca/portfolio/the-devil/ Noah Jordan: \"The Devil\" (piano work)].\n\n{{Microtonal music}}\n{{Musical tuning}}\n[[Category:Equal temperaments]]\n[[Category:Microtonality]]"

The ratio of four minor thirds to an octave (648:625 or 62.565&nbsp;cents &ndash; the  “[[diesis|greater diesis]]”) was almost exactly a nineteenth of an octave. Interest in such a tuning system goes back to the 16th&nbsp;century, when composer [[Guillaume Costeley]] used it in his chanson ''Seigneur Dieu ta pitié'' of 1558. Costeley understood and desired the circulating aspect of this tuning.\n\nIn 1577, music theorist [[Francisco de Salinas]] in effect proposed it. Salinas discussed {{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;comma meantone, in which the fifth is of size 694.786&nbsp;cents. The fifth of 19&nbsp;EDO is 694.737&nbsp;cents, which is less than a twentieth of a cent narrower: imperceptible and less than tuning error. Salinas suggested tuning nineteen tones to the octave to this tuning, which fails to close by less than a cent, so that his suggestion is effectively 19&nbsp;EDO.\n\nIn the 19th&nbsp;century, mathematician and music theorist [[Wesley S. B.

      "text": "In music, '''22 equal temperament''', called 22-TET, 22-[[equal division of the octave|EDO]], or 22-ET, is the [[musical temperament|tempered]] scale derived by dividing the octave into 22 equal steps (equal frequency ratios). {{audio|22-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} Each step represents a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|22}}, or 54.55 [[cent (music)|cents]] ({{Audio|1 step in 22-et on C.mid|Play}}).\n\nWhen composing with 22-ET, one needs to take into account different facts. Considering the [[Five-limit tuning|5-limit]], there is a difference between 3 fifths and the sum of 1 fourth + 1 major third. It means that, starting from C, there are two A's - one 16 steps and one 17 steps away. There is also a difference between a major tone and a minor tone. In C major, the second note (D) will be 4 steps away. However, in A minor, where A is 6 steps below C, the fourth note (D) will be 9 steps above A, so 3 steps above C. So when switching from C major to A minor, one need to slightly change the note D. These discrepancies arise because, unlike [[Equal temperament|12-ET]], 22-ET does not temper out the [[syntonic comma]] of 81/80, and in fact exaggerates its size by mapping it to one step.\n\nExtending 22-ET to the [[7-limit tuning|7-limit]], we find the septimal minor seventh (7/4) can be distinguished from the sum of a fifth (3/2) and a minor third (6/5). Also the septimal subminor third (7/6) is different from the minor third (6/5). This mapping tempers out the [[septimal comma]] of 64/63, which allows 22-ET to function as a \"Superpythagorean\" system where four stacked fifths are equated with the [[septimal major third]] (9/7) rather than the usual pental third of 5/4. This system is a \"mirror image\" of [[Septimal meantone temperament|septimal meantone]] in many ways. Instead of tempering the fifth narrow so that intervals of 5 are simple while intervals of 7 are complex, the fifth is tempered wide so that intervals of 7 are simple while intervals of 5 are complex. The enharmonic structure is also reversed: sharps are sharper than flats, similar to Pythagorean tuning, but to a greater degree.\n\nFinally, 22-ET has a good approximation of the 11th harmonic, and is in fact the smallest equal temperament to be consistent in the [[11-limit interval|11-limit]].\n\nThe net effect is that 22-ET allows (and to some extent even forces) the exploration of new musical territory, while still having excellent approximations of common practice consonances.\n\n\n==History and use==\n\nThe idea of dividing the octave into 22 steps of equal size seems to have originated with nineteenth-century music theorist [[RHM Bosanquet]]. Inspired by the division of the octave into 22 unequal parts in the [[music of India|music theory of India]], Bosanquet noted that an equal division was capable of representing [[limit (music)|5-limit]] music with tolerable accuracy.<ref>Bosanquet, R.H.M. [http://www.geocities.com/threesixesinarow/hindoo.htm \"On the Hindoo division of the octave, with additions to the theory of higher orders\"] ([https://www.webcitation.org/5kjJcrhEx Archived] 2009-10-22), ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'' vol. 26 (March 1, 1877, to December 20, 1877) Taylor & Francis, London 1878, pp.&nbsp;372–384. (Reproduced in Tagore, Sourindro Mohun, ''Hindu Music from Various Authors'', Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series, Varanasi, India, 1965).</ref> In this he was followed in the twentieth century by theorist [[José Würschmidt]], who noted it as a possible next step after [[19 equal temperament]], and [[J. Murray Barbour]] in his survey of tuning history, ''Tuning and Temperament''.<ref>Barbour, James Murray, ''Tuning and temperament, a historical survey'',  East Lansing, Michigan State College Press, 1953 [c1951].</ref> Contemporary advocates of 22 equal temperament include music theorist [[Paul Erlich]].\n\n==Notation==\n22-EDO can be notated several ways. The first, '''Up/Down Notation''', uses ups and downs in addition to sharps and flats, chord spellings may change(C, E{{music|down}}, G is C major triad). This yields the following chromatic scale:\n\nC, C{{music|up}}, C{{music|#}}{{music|down}}, C{{music|#}},\n\nD, E{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}{{music|up}}, E{{music|down}}, E,\n\nF, F{{music|up}}, F{{music|#}}{{music|down}}, F{{music|#}},\n\nG, G{{music|up}}/A{{music|b}}, G{{music|#}}{{music|down}}/A{{music|b}}{{music|up}}, G{{music|#}}/A{{music|down}},\n\nA, B{{music|b}}, B{{music|b}}{{music|up}}, B{{music|down}}, B, C\n\nThe second, '''Quarter Tone Notation''', uses quarter tone notation to divide the notes of Up/Down Notation. However, some chord spellings may change(C, E{{music|d}}, G is C major triad). This yields the following chromatic scale:\n\nC, C{{music|t}}, C{{music|#}}/D{{music|b}}, D{{music|d}},\n\nD, D{{music|t}}, D{{music|#}}/E{{music|b}}, E{{music|d}}, E,\n\nF, F{{music|t}}, F{{music|#}}/G{{music|b}}, G{{music|d}},\n\nG, G{{music|t}}, G{{music|#}}/A{{music|b}}, A{{music|d}},\n\nA, A{{music|t}}, A{{music|#}}/B{{music|b}}, B{{music|d}}, B, C\n\nThe third, '''Porcupine Notation,''' introduces no new accidentals, but significantly changes chord spellings(C, E{{music|#}}, G{{music|#}} is C major triad). In addition, enharmonicities from 12-EDO are no longer valid. This yields the following chromatic scale:\n\nC, C{{music|#}}, D{{music|b}},\nD, D{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}},\nE, E{{music|#}}, F{{music|b}},\nF, F{{music|#}}, G{{music|b}},\nG, G{{music|#}}, G{{music|x}}/A{{music|bb}}, A{{music|b}},\nA, A{{music|#}}, B{{music|b}},\nB, B{{music|#}}, C{{music|b}}, C\n\n==Interval size==\nHere are the sizes of some common intervals in this system (intervals

Each step represents a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|23}}, or 52.174 cents. This system is the largest EDO that has an error of at least 20 cents for the 3rd (3:2), 5th (5:4), 7th (7:4), and 11th (11:8) harmonics, which makes it unusual in microtonal music.\n\n==History and use==\n23-EDO was advocated by ethnomusicologist [[Erich von Hornbostel]] in the 1920s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monzo |first1=Joe |title=Equal-Temperament |url=http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx#edo-table |website=Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory |publisher=Joe Monzo |accessdate=20 February 2019 |date=2005}}</ref> as the result of \"a cycle of 'blown' (compressed) fifths\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sethares |first1=William |title=Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale |date=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781852337971 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KChoKKhjOb0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> of about 678 cents that may have resulted from \"overblowing\" a bamboo pipe.

More generally, it is a [[regular diatonic tuning]] in which the tempered perfect fifth is equal to 696.77 cents, as shown in Figure 1. On an [[isomorphic keyboard]], the fingering of music composed in 31-ET is precisely the same as it is in any other syntonic tuning (such as 12-ET), so long as the notes are spelled properly — that is, with no assumption of [[Enharmonic|enharmonicity]].\n\n==History and use==\n\nDivision of the [[octave]] into 31 steps arose naturally out of Renaissance [[music theory]]; the lesser [[diesis]] &mdash; the ratio of an octave to three major thirds, 128:125 or 41.06 cents — was approximately a [[interval (music)|fifth]] of a tone and a third of a [[semitone]]. In 1555, Nicola Vincento proposed an extended-meantone tuning of 31 tones. In 1666,  [[Lemme Rossi]] first proposed an equal temperament of this order. In 1691, having discovered it independently, scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] wrote about it also.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monzo |first1=Joe |title=Equal-Temperament |url=http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx#edo-table |website=Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory |publisher=Joe Monzo |accessdate=28 February 2019 |date=2005}}</ref> Since the standard system of [[musical tuning|tuning]] at that time was [[quarter-comma meantone]], in which the fifth is tuned to {{radic|5|4}}, the appeal of this method was immediate, as the fifth of 31-ET, at 696.77 cents, is only 0.19 cent wider than the fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Huygens not only realized this, he went farther and noted that 31-ET provides an excellent approximation of septimal, or [[limit (music)|7-limit]] harmony. In the twentieth century, physicist, music theorist and composer [[Adriaan Fokker]], after reading Huygens's work, led a revival of interest in this system of tuning which led to a number of compositions, particularly by Dutch composers. Fokker designed the Fokker organ, a 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in [[Teyler's Museum]] in [[Haarlem]] in 1951 and moved to [[Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ]] in 2010 where it has been frequently used in concerts since it moved.\n\n==Interval size==\n\nHere are the sizes of some common intervals:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\" |interval name\n|

approximate fits in [[Equal Temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12 equal temperament]] and only poor fits in [[19 equal temperament]].  The composer [[Joel Mandelbaum]] (born 1932) used this tuning system specifically because of its good matches to the 7th and 11th partials in the harmonic series.<ref>Keislar, Douglas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/833076 \"Six American Composers on Nonstandard Tunnings: Easley Blackwood; John Eaton; Lou Harrison; Ben Johnston; Joel Mandelbaum; William Schottstaedt\"], ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 1. (Winter, 1991), pp. 176-211.</ref>  The tuning has poor matches to both the 9:8 and 10:9 intervals (major and minor tone in just intonation); however, it has a good match for the ''average'' of the two. Practically it is very close to quarter-comma meantone.\n\nThis tuning can be considered a [[meantone temperament]]. It has the necessary property that a chain of its four fifths is equivalent to its major third (the [[syntonic comma]] 81:80 is tempered out), which also means that it contains a \"meantone\" that falls between the sizes of 10:9 and 9:8 as the combination of one of each of its chromatic and diatonic semitones.\n\n==Scale diagram==\n\nThe following are the 31 notes in the scale:\n\n{|

Chords not discussed there include the [[neutral third]]s triad ({{Audio|Neutral thirds triad in 31-tet.mid|Play}}), which might be written C–E{{music|d}}–G, C–D{{music|x}}–G or C–F{{music|bb}}–G, and the [[Orwell temperament|Orwell]] tetrad, which is C–E–F{{music|x}}–B{{music|bb}}.\n\n[[Image:Simple I-IV-V-I isomorphic 31-TET.png|thumb|left|302px|I–IV–V–I [[chord progression]] in 31 tone equal temperament.<ref>Andrew Milne, [[William Sethares]], and James Plamondon (2007). \"Isomorphic Controllers and Dynamic Tuning: Invariant Fingering over a Tuning Continuum\", p.29.

Also, it is possible to play subminor chords (where the first third is [[Subminor_interval|subminor]]) and supermajor chords (where the first third is [[Supermajor_interval|supermajor]]).\n\n[[File:Cmaj7 Gmin 31ET 12ET.ogg|thumb|C major seventh and G minor, twice in 31 equal temperament, then twice in 12 equal temperament]]\nIt is also possible to render nicely the [[harmonic seventh chord]]. For example on C with C–E–G–A{{music|♯}}. The seventh here is different from stacking a fifth and a minor third, which instead yields B{{music|♭}} to make a [[dominant seventh]]. This difference cannot be made in [[12 equal temperament|12-ET]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Archicembalo]], alternate keyboard instrument with 36 keys that was sometimes tuned as 31TET.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.huygens-fokker.org/ The Huygens Fokker foundation for micro-tonal music, in Dutch and English]\n* [http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/fokkerorg.html Fokker, Adriaan Daniël, ''Equal Temperament and the Thirty-one-keyed organ'']\n* [http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/rap31.html Rapoport, Paul, ''About 31-tone Equal Temperament'']\n* [http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/terp31.html Terpstra, Siemen, ''Toward a Theory of Meantone (and 31-et) Harmony'']\n* Barbieri, Patrizio.

      "text": "In musical theory, '''34 equal temperament''', also referred to as 34-TET, 34-[[equal division of the octave|EDO]] or 34-ET, is the [[musical temperament|tempered]] tuning derived by dividing the octave into 34 equal-sized steps (equal frequency ratios). {{audio|34-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} Each step represents a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|34}}, or 35.29 [[cent (music)|cents]] {{audio|1 step in 34-et on C.mid|Play}}.\n\n==History and use==\n\nUnlike divisions of the octave into [[19 equal temperament|19]], [[31 equal temperament|31]] or [[53 equal temperament|53]] steps, which can be considered as being derived from ancient Greek intervals (the greater and lesser [[diesis]] and the [[syntonic comma]]), division into 34 steps did not arise 'naturally' out of older music theory, although [[Cyriakus Schneegass]] proposed a [[meantone]] system with 34 divisions based in effect on half a [[chromatic]] [[semitone]] (the difference between a [[major third]] and a [[minor third]], 25:24 or 70.67 cents).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Wider interest in the tuning was not seen until modern times, when the computer made possible a systematic search of all possible equal temperaments. While Barbour discusses it,<ref>''Tuning and Temperament'', Michigan State College Press, 1951</ref> the first recognition of its potential importance appears to be in an article published in 1979 by the Dutch theorist Dirk de Klerk.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The luthier Larry Hanson had an electric guitar refretted from 12 to 34 and persuaded American guitarist Neil Haverstick to take it up.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAs compared with 31-et, 34-et reduces the combined mistuning from the theoretically ideal just thirds, fifths and sixths from 11.9 to 7.9 cents. Its fifths and sixths are markedly better, and its thirds only slightly further from the theoretical ideal of the 5:4 ratio. Viewed in light of Western diatonic theory, the three extra steps (of 34-et compared to 31-et) in effect widen the intervals between C and D, F and G, and A and B, thus making a distinction between [[major tone]]s, ratio 9:8 and [[minor tone]]s, ratio 10:9. This can be regarded either as a resource or as a problem, making [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] in the contemporary Western sense more complex. As the number of divisions of the octave is even, the exact halving of the octave (600 cents) appears, as in 12-et. Unlike 31-et, 34 does not give an approximation to the harmonic seventh, ratio 7:4.\n\n==Interval size==\n\nThe following table outlines some of the intervals of this tuning system and their match to

      "text": "In music, '''41 equal temperament''', abbreviated 41-TET, 41-[[equal division of the octave|EDO]], or 41-ET, is the [[Musical temperament|tempered]] scale derived by dividing the octave into 41 equally sized steps (equal frequency ratios). {{audio|41-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} Each step represents a frequency ratio of 2<sup>1/41</sup>, or 29.27 [[cent (music)|cents]] ({{Audio|1 step in 41-et on C.mid|Play}}), an interval close in size to the [[septimal comma]].  41-ET can be seen as a tuning of the [[schismatic temperament|schismatic]],<ref>[http://x31eq.com/schismic.htm \"Schismic Temperaments \"], ''Intonation Information''.</ref> [[magic temperament|magic]] and [[miracle temperament|miracle]]<ref>[http://x31eq.com/decimal_lattice.htm \"Lattices with Decimal Notation\"], ''Intonation Information''.</ref> temperaments.  It is the second smallest equal temperament, after [[29 equal temperament|29-ET]], whose [[perfect fifth]] is closer to [[just intonation]] than that of [[12 equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-ET]]. In other words, <math>2^{24/41} \\approx 1.50042</math> is a better approximation to the ratio <math>3/2 = 1.5</math> than either <math>2^{17/29} \\approx 1.50129</math> or <math>2^{7/12} \\approx 1.49831</math>.\n\n==History and use==\n\nAlthough 41-ET has not seen as wide use as other temperaments such as [[19 equal temperament|19-ET]] or [[31 equal temperament|31-ET]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, pianist and engineer [[Paul von Janko]] built a piano using this tuning, which is on display at the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in [[The

series]] up to and including the 10th overtone.  This includes the distinction between the [[major tone]] and [[minor tone]] (thus 41-ET is not a [[meantone]] tuning).  These close fits make 41-ET a good approximation for 5-, 7- and 9-[[limit (music)|limit]] music.\n\n41-ET also closely matches a number of other intervals involving higher harmonics.  It distinguishes between and closely matches all intervals involving up through the 12th overtones, with the exception of the greater undecimal [[neutral second]] (11:10). Although not as accurate, it can be considered a full [[limit (music)|15-limit]] tuning as well.\n\n===Tempering===\nIntervals not tempered out by 41-ET include the [[diesis]] (128:125), [[septimal diesis]] (49:48), [[septimal sixth-tone]] (50:49), [[septimal comma]] (64:63), and the [[syntonic comma]] (81:80).\n\n41-ET tempers out the 100:99 ratio, which is the difference between the greater undecimal neutral second and the minor tone, as well as the [[septimal kleisma]] (225:224), 1029:1024 (the difference between three intervals of 8:7 the interval 3:2), and the small diesis (3125:3072).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Microtonal music}}\n{{Musical tuning}}\n\n[[Category:Equal temperaments]]\n[[Category:Microtonality]]"

These are both 5&nbsp;limit intervals, involving only the primes 2, 3 and 5 in their factorization, and the fact that 53&nbsp;ET tempers out both characterizes it completely as a 5&nbsp;limit temperament: it is the only [[regular temperament]] tempering out both of these intervals, or [[comma (music)|comma]]s, a fact which seems to have first been recognized by Japanese music theorist [[Shohé Tanaka]]. Because it tempers these out, 53-EDO can be used for both [[schismatic temperament]], tempering out the schisma, and [[Hanson temperament]] (also called kleismic), tempering out the kleisma.\n\nThe interval of {{frac|7|4}} is 4.8&nbsp;cents sharp in 53-EDO, and using it for 7&nbsp;limit harmony means that the [[septimal kleisma]], the interval {{frac|225|224}}, is also tempered out.\n\n== History and use ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Pythagorean comma]] -->\nTheoretical interest in this division goes back to antiquity. [[Ching Fang]] (78–37&nbsp;BCE), a Chinese music theorist, observed that a series of 53&nbsp;[[just fifth]]s ([{{frac|3|2}}]<sup>53</sup>) is very nearly equal to 31&nbsp;octaves (2<sup>31</sup>). He calculated this difference with six-digit accuracy to be {{frac|177147|176776}}.<ref>[[Ernest G. McClain|McClain, Ernest]] and Ming Shui Hung. ''Chinese Cyclic Tunings in Late Antiquity'', Ethnomusicology Vol. 23 No. 2, 1979. pp. 205–224.</ref> Later the same observation was made by the mathematician and music theorist [[Nicholas Mercator]] (c. 1620–1687), who calculated this value precisely as {{frac|(3<sup>53</sup>)|(2<sup>84</sup>)}} = {{frac|19383245667680019896796723|19342813113834066795298816}}, which is known as [[Mercator's comma]].<ref>Monzo, Joe (2005). [http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/m/mercator-comma.aspx \"Mercator's Comma\"], ''Tonalsoft''.</ref> Mercator's comma is of such small value to begin with (≈&nbsp;3.615&nbsp;cents), but 53&nbsp;equal temperament flattens each fifth by only {{frac|1|53}} of that comma (≈&nbsp;0.0682&nbsp;cent ≈ {{frac|1|315}}&nbsp;[[syntonic comma]] ≈ {{frac|1|344}}&nbsp;[[pythagorean comma]]). Thus, 53&nbsp;tone equal temperament is for all practical purposes equivalent to an extended [[Pythagorean tuning]].\n\nAfter Mercator, [[William Holder]] published a treatise in 1694 which pointed out that 53&nbsp;equal temperament also very closely approximates the [[just major third]] (to within 1.4&nbsp;cents), and consequently 53&nbsp;equal temperament accommodates the intervals of [[five-limit tuning|5&nbsp;limit]] [[just intonation]] very well.<ref>Holder, William, ''Treatise on the Natural Grounds and Principles of Harmony'', facsimile of the 1694&nbsp;London edition, Broude Brothers, 1967</ref><ref>Stanley, Jerome, ''William Holder and His Position in Seventeenth-Century Philosophy and Music Theory'', The Edwin Mellen Press, 2002</ref> This property of 53-EDO may have been known earlier; [[Isaac Newton]]'s unpublished manuscripts suggest that he had been aware of it as early as 1664–1665.<ref>Barbieri, Patrizio.

(2008) Latina, Il Levante Libreria Editrice, p. 350.</ref>\n=== Music ===\nIn the 19th&nbsp;century, people began devising instruments in 53-EDO, with an eye to their use in playing near-just [[Limit (music)|5-limit]] music. Such instruments were devised by [[Robert Holford Macdowall Bosanquet|RHM Bosanquet]]<ref>Helmholtz, L. F., and Ellis, Alexander, ''On the Sensations of Tone'', second English edition, Dover Publications, 1954. pp.328–329.</ref> and the American tuner [[James Paul White]].<ref>Helmholtz, L. F., and Ellis, Alexander, ''On the Sensations of Tone'', second English edition, Dover Publications, 1954. p.329.</ref> Subsequently, the temperament has seen occasional use by composers in the west, and has been used in [[Music of Turkey|Turkish music]] as well; the Turkish composer [[Erol Sayan]] has employed it, following theoretical use of it by Turkish music theorist [[Kemal Ilerici]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. [[Arabic music]], which for the most part bases its theory on [[quartertone]]s, has also made some use of it; the Syrian violinist and music theorist [[Twfiq Al-Sabagh]] proposed that instead of an equal division of the octave into 24&nbsp;parts a 24&nbsp;note scale in 53-EDO should be used as the master scale for Arabic music{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.\n\nCroatian composer [[Josip Štolcer-Slavenski]] wrote one piece, which has never been published, which uses [[Robert Holford Macdowall Bosanquet|Bosanquet's Enharmonium]] during its first movement, entitled ''Music for Natur-ton-system''.<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:J_Slavenski_Preface_to_53EDO_piece.jpg Facsimile of the 53EDO piece preface by J.

Slavenski.]</ref>\nFurthermore, General Thompson worked in league with the London-based guitar maker Louis Panormo to produce the Enharmonic Guitar (see: James Westbrook,‘General Thompson’s Enharmonic Guitar’, Soundboard: XXXVIII: 4, pp.&nbsp;45–52.).\n\n==Notation==\n[[Image:Comma Line.gif|400px|thumb|Notation used in Ottoman classical music, where the tone is divided into 9 commas]]\nAttempting to use standard notation, seven letter notes plus sharps or flats, can quickly become confusing. This is unlike the case with [[19 equal temperament|19-EDO]] and [[31 equal temperament|31-EDO]] where there is little ambiguity. By not being meantone, it adds some problems that require more attention. Specifically, the major third is different from a ditone, two tones, each of which is two fifths minus an octave. Likewise, the minor third is different from a semiditone. The fact that the [[syntonic comma]] is not tempered out means that notes and intervals need to be defined more precisely. [[Ottoman classical music]] uses a notation of flats and sharps for the 9-comma tone.\n\nIn this article, diatonic notation will be used creating the following chromatic scale, where sharps and flats aren't enharmonic, only E{{music|doublesharp}} and B{{music|doublesharp}} are enharmonic with F{{music|doubleflat}} and C{{music|doubleflat}}. For the other notes, triple and quadruple sharps and flats aren't enharmonic.\n\nC, C{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|doublesharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, C{{music|doublesharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, D{{music|doubleflat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, D{{music|flat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, D{{music|doubleflat}}, D{{music|flat}},\n\nD, D{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|doublesharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, D{{music|doublesharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, E{{music|doubleflat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, E{{music|flat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, E{{music|doubleflat}}, E{{music|flat}},\n\nE, E{{music|sharp}}, E{{music|doublesharp}}/F{{music|doubleflat}}, F{{music|flat}},\n\nF, F{{music|sharp}}, F{{music|doublesharp}}, F{{music|sharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, F{{music|doublesharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, G{{music|doubleflat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, G{{music|flat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, G{{music|doubleflat}}, G{{music|flat}},\n\nG, G{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|doublesharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, G{{music|doublesharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, A{{music|doubleflat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, A{{music|flat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, A{{music|doubleflat}}, A{{music|flat}},\n\nA, A{{music|sharp}}, A{{music|doublesharp}}, A{{music|sharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, A{{music|doublesharp}}{{music|doublesharp}}, B{{music|doubleflat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, B{{music|flat}}{{music|doubleflat}}, B{{music|doubleflat}}, B{{music|flat}},\n\nB, B{{music|sharp}}, B{{music|doublesharp}}/C{{music|doubleflat}}, C{{music|flat}}, C\n===Chords of 53 equal temperament===\nSince 53-EDO is a Pythagorean system, with nearly pure fifths, major and minor triads cannot be spelled in the same manner as in a [[meantone temperament|meantone]] tuning. Instead, the major triads are chords like C-F{{music|b}}-G, where the major third is a diminished fourth; this is the defining characteristic of [[schismatic temperament]]. Likewise, the minor triads are chords like C-D{{music|#}}-G. In 53-EDO, the [[dominant seventh chord]] would be spelled C-F{{music|b}}-G-B{{music|b}}, but the [[otonal]] tetrad is C-F{{music|b}}-G-C{{music|bb}}, and C-F{{music|b}}-G-A{{music|#}} is still another seventh chord. The [[utonal]] tetrad, the inversion of the otonal tetrad, is spelled C-D{{music|#}}-G-G{{music|x}}.\n\nFurther septimal chords are the diminished triad, having the two forms C-D{{music|#}}-G{{music|b}} and C-F{{music|bb}}-G{{music|b}}, the subminor triad, C-F{{music|bb}}-G, the supermajor triad C-D{{music|x}}-G, and corresponding tetrads C-F{{music|bb}}-G-B{{music|bb}} and C-D{{music|x}}-G-A{{music|#}}. Since 53-EDO tempers out the [[septimal kleisma]], the septimal kleisma augmented triad C-F{{music|b}}-B{{music|bb}} in its various inversions is also a chord of the system. So is the Orwell tetrad, C-F{{music|b}}-D{{music|x}}{{music|x}}-G{{music|x}} in its various inversions.\n\nBecause 53-EDO is compatible with both the [[schismatic temperament]] and the [[syntonic temperament]], it can be used as a pivot tuning in a temperament modulation (a musical effect enabled by [[dynamic tonality]]).\n\n== Interval size ==\nBecause a distance of 31&nbsp;steps in this scale is almost precisely equal to a [[Just intonation|just]] [[perfect fifth]], in theory this scale can be considered a slightly tempered form of [[Pythagorean tuning]] that has been extended to 53&nbsp;tones. As such the intervals available can have the same properties as any Pythagorean tuning, such as fifths that are (practically) pure, major thirds that are wide from just (about {{frac|81|64}} opposed to the purer {{frac|5|4}}, and minor thirds that are conversely narrow ({{frac|32|27}} compared to {{frac|6|5}}).\n\nHowever, 53-EDO contains additional intervals that are very close to just intonation. For instance, the interval of 17&nbsp;steps is also a major third, but only 1.4&nbsp;cents narrower than the very pure just interval {{frac|5|4}}. 53-EDO is very good as an approximation to any interval in 5&nbsp;limit just intonation.\n\nThe matches to the just intervals involving the 7th&nbsp;harmonic are slightly less close, but all such intervals are still matched with the highest deviation being the {{frac|7|5}}&nbsp;tritone. The 11th harmonic and intervals involving it are less closely matched, as illustrated with the undecimal neutral seconds and thirds in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|align=center

      "text": "In [[music]], '''58 equal temperament''' (also called 58-ET or 58-[[equal division of the octave|EDO]]) divides the octave into 58 equal parts of approximately 20.69 [[cent (music)|cents]] each. It is notable as the simplest equal division of the octave to faithfully represent the [[limit (music)|17-limit]],<ref name=\"tonalsoft\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/c/consistent.aspx|title=consistency / consistent}}</ref> and the first that distinguishes between all the elements of the 11-limit [[tonality diamond]]. The next-smallest equal temperament to do both these things is [[72 equal temperament]].\n\nCompared to [[72 equal temperament|72-EDO]], which is also consistent in the 17-limit, 58-EDO's approximations of most intervals are not quite as good (although still workable). One obvious exception is the perfect fifth (slightly better in 58-EDO), and another is the tridecimal minor third (11:13), which is significantly better in 58-EDO than in 72-EDO. The two systems temper out different commas; 72-EDO tempers out the comma 169:168, thus equating the 14:13 and 13:12 intervals. On the other hand, 58-EDO tempers out 144:143 instead of 169:168, so 14:13 and 13:12 are left distinct, but 13:12 and 12:11 are equated.\n\n58-EDO, unlike 72-EDO, is not a [[equal temperament|multiple of 12]], so the only interval (up to octave equivalency) that it shares with 12-EDO is the 600-cent [[tritone]] (which functions as both 17:12 and 24:17). On the other hand, 58-EDO has fewer pitches than 72-EDO and is therefore simpler.\n\n==History and use==\nThe medieval Italian music theorist [[Marchetto da Padova]] proposed a system that is approximately 29-EDO, which is a subset of 58-EDO, in 1318.<ref name=\"marchettus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/marchetmf.html|title=Marchettus, the cadential diesis, and neo-Gothic tunings}}</ref>\n\n==Interval size==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\"|interval name\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\"|size (steps)\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\"|size (cents)\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\"|just ratio\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\"|just (cents)\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#ffffb4\"|error\n|-\n|align=center|[[octave]]\n|align=center|58\n|align=center|1200\n|align=center|2:1\n|align=center|1200\n|align=center|0\n|-\n|align=center|[[perfect fifth]]\n|align=center|34\n|align=center|703.45\n|align=center|3:2\n|align=center|701.96\n|align=center|+1.49\n|-\n|align=center|[[tritone|greater septendecimal tritone]]\n|rowspan=2 align=center|29\n|rowspan=2 align=center|600\n|align=center|17:12\n|align=center|603.00\n|align=center|&minus;3.00\n|-\n|align=center|[[tritone|lesser septendecimal tritone]]\n<!--|align=center|29-->\n<!--|align=center|600-->\n|align=center|24:17\n|align=center|597.00\n|align=center|+3.00\n|-\n|align=center|[[septimal tritone]]\n|align=center|28\n|align=center|579.31\n|align=center|7:5\n|align=center|582.51\n|align=center|&minus;3.20\n|-\n|align=center|[[eleventh harmonic]]\n|align=center|27\n|align=center|558.62\n|align=center|11:8\n|align=center|551.32\n|align=center|+7.30\n|-\n|align=center|15:11 wide fourth\n|align=center|26\n|align=center|537.93\n|align=center|15:11\n|align=center|536.95\n|align=center|+0.98\n|-\n|align=center|[[perfect fourth]]\n|align=center|24\n|align=center|496.55\n|align=center|4:3\n|align=center|498.04\n|align=center|&minus;1.49\n|-\n|align=center|septimal narrow fourth\n|align=center|23\n|align=center|475.86\n|align=center|21:16\n|align=center|470.78\n|align=center|+5.08\n|-\n|align=center|tridecimal major third\n|align=center|22\n|align=center|455.17\n|align=center|13:10\n|align=center|454.21\n|align=center|+0.96\n|-\n|align=center|[[septimal major third]]\n|align=center|21\n|align=center|434.48\n|align=center|9:7\n|align=center|435.08\n|align=center|&minus;0.60\n|-\n|align=center|undecimal major third\n|align=center|20\n|align=center|413.79\n|align=center|14:11\n|align=center|417.51\n|align=center|&minus;3.72\n|-\n|align=center|[[major third]]\n|align=center|19\n|align=center|393.10\n|align=center|5:4\n|align=center|386.31\n|align=center|+6.79\n|-\n|align=center|tridecimal [[neutral third]]\n|rowspan=2 align=center|17\n|rowspan=2 align=center|351.72\n|align=center|16:13\n|align=center|359.47\n|align=center|&minus;7.75\n|-\n|align=center|undecimal neutral third\n<!--|align=center|17-->\n<!--|align=center|351.72-->\n|align=center|11:9\n|align=center|347.41\n|align=center|+4.31\n|-\n|align=center|[[minor third]]\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|310.34\n|align=center|6:5\n|align=center|315.64\n|align=center|&minus;5.30\n|-\n|align=center|tridecimal minor third\n|align=center|14\n|align=center|289.66\n|align=center|13:11\n|align=center|289.21\n|align=center|+0.45\n|-\n|align=center|[[septimal minor third]]\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|268.97\n|align=center|7:6\n|align=center|266.87\n|align=center|+2.10\n|-\n|align=center|tridecimal semifourth\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|248.28\n|align=center|15:13\n|align=center|247.74\n|align=center|+0.54\n|-\n|align=center|[[septimal whole tone]]\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|227.59\n|align=center|8:7\n|align=center|231.17\n|align=center|&minus;3.58\n|-\n|align=center|whole tone, [[major tone]]\n|align=center|10\n|align=center|206.90\n|align=center|9:8\n|align=center|203.91\n|align=center|+2.99\n|-\n|align=center|whole tone, [[minor tone]]\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|186.21\n|align=center|10:9\n|align=center|182.40\n|align=center|+3.81\n|-\n|align=center|greater undecimal [[neutral second]]\n|align=center|8\n|align=center|165.52\n|align=center|11:10\n|align=center|165.00\n|align=center|+0.52\n|-\n|align=center|lesser undecimal [[neutral second]]\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|144.83\n|align=center|12:11\n|align=center|150.64\n|align=center|&minus;5.81\n|-\n|align=center|[[septimal diatonic semitone]]\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|124.14\n|align=center|15:14\n|align=center|119.44\n|align=center|+4.70\n|-\n|align=center|septendecimal semitone;

      "text": "In music, '''72 equal temperament''', called '''twelfth-tone''', 72-TET, 72-[[equal division of the octave|EDO]], or 72-ET, is the [[musical temperament|tempered]] scale derived by dividing the octave into twelfth-tones, or in other words 72 equal steps (equal frequency ratios). {{audio|72-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} Each step represents a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|72}}, or {{frac|16|2|3}} [[cent (music)|cents]], which divides the 100 cent \"[[semitone|halftone]]\" into 6 equal parts (100 ÷ {{frac|16|2|3}} = 6) and is thus a \"twelfth-tone\" ({{Audio|1 step in 72-et on C.mid|Play}}). Since 72 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72, 72-EDO includes all those equal temperaments. Since it contains so many temperaments, 72-EDO contains at the same time tempered semitones, third-tones, quartertones and sixth-tones, which makes it a very versatile temperament.\n\nThis division of the octave has attracted much attention from tuning theorists, since on the one hand it subdivides the standard [[equal temperament|12 equal temperament]] and on the other hand it accurately represents overtones up to the twelfth partial tone, and hence can be used for [[limit (music)|11-limit music]]. It was theoreticized in the form of twelfth-tones by [[Alois Hába]]<ref>A. Hába: \"Harmonické základy ctvrttónové soustavy\".

Chryssochoidis, D. Delviniotis and G. Kouroupetroglou, \"A semi-automated tagging methodology for\nOrthodox Ecclesiastic Chant Acoustic corpora\", Proceedings SMC'07, 4th Sound and Music Computing Conference, Lefkada, Greece (11–13 July 2007).</ref> dividing the octave into 72 equal ''moria'', which itself derives from interpretations of the theories of [[Aristoxenos]], who used something similar. Although the 72 equal temperament is based on [[irrational number|irrational]] intervals (see above), as is the 12 tone equal temperament mostly commonly used in Western music (and which is contained as a subset within 72 equal temperament), 72 equal temperament, as a much finer division of the octave, is an excellent tuning for both representing the division of the octave according to the [[diatonic genus|diatonic]] and the [[chromatic genus|chromatic]] genera in which intervals are based on [[ratio]]s between notes, and for representing with great accuracy many rational intervals as well as irrational intervals.\n===Other history and use===\nA number of composers have made use of it, and these represent widely different points of view and types of musical practice. These include [[Alois Hába]], Julián Carrillo, [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]] and [[Iannis Xenakis]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nMany other composers use it freely and intuitively, such as jazz musician [[Joe Maneri]], and classically oriented composers such as [[Julia Werntz]] and others associated with the [[Boston Microtonal Society]]. Others, such as New York composer [[Joseph Pehrson]] are interested in it because it supports the use of [[miracle temperament]], and still others simply because it approximates higher-limit just intonation, such as [[Ezra Sims]] and [[James Tenney]]. There was also an active Soviet school of 72 equal composers, with less familiar names: [[Evgeny Alexandrovich Murzin]], [[Andrei Volkonsky]], [[Nikolai Nikolsky]], [[Eduard Artemiev]], [[Alexander Nemtin]], [[Andrei Eshpai]], [[Gennady Gladkov]], [[Pyotr Meshchianinov]], and [[Stanislav Kreichi]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe [[ANS synthesizer]] uses 72 equal temperament.\n\n==Notation==\n<!--[[Maneri-Sims notation]] redirects directly here.-->\nThe '''Maneri-Sims notation''' system designed for 72-et uses the [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] {{music|down}} and {{music|up}} for {{frac|1|12}}-tone down and up (1 step = {{frac|16|2|3}} cents), {{music|half check down}} and {{music|half check up}} for {{frac|1|6}} down and up (2 steps = {{frac|33|1|3}} cents), and {{music|check}} and {{music|check up}} for [[septimal quarter tone|{{frac|1|4}}]] up and down (3 steps = 50 cents).\n\nThey may be combined with the traditional sharp and flat symbols (6 steps = 100 cents) by being placed before them, for example: {{music|half check down}}{{music|flat}} or {{music|check up}}{{music|b}}, but without the intervening space. A {{frac|1|3}} tone may be one of the following {{music|up}}{{music|check up}}, {{music|down}}{{music|check down}}, {{music|half check down}}{{music|#}}, or {{music|half check up}}{{music|b}} (4 steps = {{frac|66|2|3}}) while 5 steps may be {{music|half check up}}{{music|check up}}, {{music|down}}{{music|sharp}}, or {{music|up}}{{music|b}} ({{frac|83|1|3}} cents).\n\n==Interval size==\n\nBelow are the sizes of some intervals (common and esoteric) in this tuning. For reference, differences of less than 5 cents are melodically imperceptible to most people:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=center|Interval Name\n!align=center|Size

closest matches to most commonly used intervals under 72-ET are distinct from the closest matches under 12-ET. For example, the [[major third]] of 12-ET, which is sharp, exists as the 24-step interval within 72-ET, but the 23-step interval is a much closer match to the 5:4 ratio of the just major third.\n\nAll intervals involving harmonics up through the 11th are matched very closely in this system; no intervals formed as the difference of any two of these intervals are tempered out by this tuning system. Thus 72-ET can be seen as offering an almost perfect approximation to 7-, 9-, and 11-limit music. When it comes to the higher harmonics, a number of intervals are still matched quite well, but some are tempered out. For instance, the comma 169:168 is tempered out, but other intervals involving the 13-th harmonic are distinguished.\n\nUnlike tunings such as [[31 equal temperament|31-ET]] and [[41 equal temperament|41-ET]], 72-ET contains many intervals which do not closely match any small-number (<16) harmonics in the harmonic series.\n\n==Scale diagram==\n[[File:Regular diatonic tunings 72-tone versus 12-tone.png|300px|thumb|12-tone {{audio|Major scale on C.mid|Play}} and 72-tone {{audio|Regular diatonic tunings 72-tone scale.mid|Play}} [[regular diatonic scale]]s notated with the Maneri-Sims system]]\nBecause 72-EDO contains 12-EDO, the scale of 12-EDO is in 72-EDO. However, the true scale can be approximated better by other intervals.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Musical temperament]]\n*[[Equal temperament]]\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/ The Boston Microtonal Society official site]\n* {{Cite web |url=http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/ |title=Wyschnegradsky notation for twelfth-tone |access-date=October 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815070729/http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/ |archive-date=August 15, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}\n** [http://www.sagittal.org/ Sagittal.org]\n** \"[http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Sagittal+notation Sagittal notation]\", ''Xenharmonic''\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.ekmelic-music.org/en/extra/alter.htm |publisher= Ekmelic Music |title= Alterations |date= September 27, 2017 }}—symbols for Maneri-Sims notation and others\n* [http://www.g-culture.org/ioannis/ Byzantine Music Electroacoustic Music]\n\n{{Microtonal music}}\n{{Musical tuning}}\n\n[[Category:Equal temperaments]]\n[[Category:Byzantine music]]\n[[Category:Microtonality]]"

      "text": "In music, '''96 equal temperament''', called 96-TET, 96-[[equal division of the octave|EDO]] (\"Equal Division of the Octave\"), or 96-ET, is the [[musical temperament|tempered]] scale derived by dividing the octave into 96 equal steps (equal frequency ratios). Each step represents a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|96}}, or 12.5 cents. Since 96 factors into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96, it contains all of those temperaments. Most humans can only hear differences of 6 cents on notes played sequentially, and this amount varies according the pitch, so the use of larger divisions of octave can be considered unnecessary. Smaller differences in pitch may be considered [[vibrato]] or stylistic devices.\n\n==History and use==\n96-EDO was first advocated by [[Julián Carrillo]] in 1924, with a 16th-tone piano. It was also advocated more recently by [[Pascale Criton]] and Vincent-Olivier Gagnon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monzo |first1=Joe |title=Equal-Temperament |url=http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx#edo-table |website=Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory |publisher=Joe Monzo |accessdate=26 February 2019 |date=2005}}</ref>\n\n==Notation==\nSince 96 = 24 × 4, quarter-tone notation can be used, and split into four parts.\n\nOne can split it into four parts like this:\n\nC, C{{music|up}}, C{{music|up}}{{music|up}}/C{{music|t}}{{music|down}}{{music|down}}, C{{music|t}}{{music|down}}, C{{music|t}}, ..., C{{music|down}}, C\n\nSince it can get confusing with so many accidentals, [[Julián Carrillo]] proposed referring to notes by step number from C (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 95, 0)\n\nSince the 16th-tone piano has a 97-key layout arranged in 8 conventional piano \"octaves\", music for it is usually notated according to the key the player has to strike.

      "text": "The modern '''Arab tone system''', or system of [[musical tuning]], is based upon the theoretical division of the [[octave]] into twenty-four equal divisions or 24-tone [[equal temperament]] (24-TET), the distance between each successive [[note (music)|note]] being a [[quarter tone]] (50 [[cent (music)|cents]]). Each [[note (music)|tone]] has its own name not repeated in different octaves, unlike systems featuring [[octave equivalency]]. The lowest tone is named ''yakah'' and is determined by the lowest [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in the [[vocal range|range]] of the singer. The next higher octave is ''nawa'' and the second ''tuti''.<ref>[[Habib Hassan Touma|Touma, Habib Hassan]] (1996). ''The Music of the Arabs'', p.17-18, trans. Laurie Schwartz. Portland, Oregon: Amadeus Press. {{ISBN|0-931340-88-8}}.</ref> However, from these twenty-four tones, seven are selected to produce a [[scale (music)|scale]] and thus the interval of a quarter tone is never used and the three-quarter tone or [[neutral second]] should be considered the characteristic interval.<ref>Touma (1996), p.23.</ref>\n\n[[File:Quarter tone scale on C.png|thumb|400px|Quarter tone scale on C ascending and descending. {{audio|Quarter tone scale on C.mid|Play}}]]\nBy contrast, in the European [[equal temperament|equally tempered scale]] the octave is divided into twelve equal divisions, or exactly half as many as the Arab system. Thus the system is written in European [[musical notation]] using a slashed flat for [[quarter flat]] (some systems use a reversed flat sign instead), a flat for half-tone [[flat (music)|flat]], a slashed flat and a flat for [[three-quarter tone flat]], sharp with one vertical line for [[quarter sharp]], sharp (♯) for half-step [[Sharp (music)|sharp]], and a half sharp and a sharp for [[three-quarter sharp]]. A two octave range starting with ''yakah'' arbitrarily on the G below middle C is used.<ref>Touma (1996), p.24.</ref>\n\nIn practice far fewer than twenty-four tones are used in a single performance. All twenty-four tones are individual pitches differentiated into a [[hierarchy]] of important pitches—pillars—which occur more frequently in the [[tone row]]s of traditional music and most often begin tone rows, and scattered less important or seldom occurring pitches (see [[tonality]]).<ref>Touma (1996), p.24-25</ref>\n\nThe specific notes used in a piece will be part of one of more than seventy [[Musical mode|mode]]s or [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] rows named after characteristic tones that are rarely the first tone (unlike in European-influenced music theory where the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] is listed first). The rows are [[heptatonic]] and constructed from [[augmented second|augmented]], [[major second|major]], [[neutral second|neutral]], and [[minor second]]s. Many different but similar ratios are proposed for the frequency ratios of the tones of each row and performance practice, as of 1996, has not been investigated using electronic measurements.<ref>Touma (1996), p.18.</ref>\n\nThe current tone system is derived from the work of [[al-Farabi]] (d. 950 CE) (heptatonic scales constructed from seconds), who used a 25-tone unequal scale (see [[tetrachord]]), and [[Mikha'il Mishaqah]] (1800–1889) who first presented the 24-tone equal-tempered division.<ref>Touma (1996), p.19.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jins]]\n*[[Arabic maqam]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic music|T]]\n[[Category:Equal temperaments]]"

M. S. Boethius, ''De institutione musica'', Book 3, Chap. 8. According to Boethius, Pythagoras' disciple Philolaos would have said that the tone consisted in two diatonic semitones and a comma; the diatonic semitone consisted in two diaschismata, each formed of two commas. See [[J. Murray Barbour]], ''Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey'', 1951, p. 123</ref>) believed that in the Pythagorean tuning the tone could be divided in nine commas, four of which forming the diatonic semitone and five the chromatic semitone. If all these commas are exactly of the same size, there results an octave of 5 tones + 2 diatonic semitones, 5 × 9 + 2 × 4 = 53 equal commas. Holder<ref>W. Holder, ''A Treatise of the Natural Grounds, and Principles of Harmony'', London, 3d edition, 1731, p. 79.</ref> attributes the division of the octave in 53 equal parts to Nicolas Mercator,<ref>\"The late ''Nicholas Mercator'', a Modest Person, and a Learned and Judicious Mathematician, in a Manuscript of his, of which I have had a Sight.\"</ref> who would have named the 1/53 part of the octave the \"Artificial Comma\".\n\n'''Mercator's comma''' is a name often used for a closely related interval because of its association with [[Nicholas Mercator]].<ref>W. Holder, ''A Treatise...'', ''ibid.'', writes that Mersenne had calculated 58¼ commas in the octave; Mercator \"working by the Logarithms, finds out but 55, and a little more.\"</ref> One of these intervals was first described by Ching-Fang in 45 BCE.<ref name=\"Touma\"/>\n\n== Mercator's comma and the Holdrian comma ==<!--[[Mercator's comma]] redirects here-->\nMercator applied logarithms to determine that <math>\\sqrt[55]{2}</math> (≈ 21.8182 cents) was nearly equivalent to a syntonic comma of ≈ 21.5063 cents (a feature of the prevalent [[meantone temperament]] of the time). He also considered that an \"artificial comma\" of <math>\\sqrt[53]{2}</math> might be useful, because 31 octaves could be practically approximated by a cycle of 53 [[just fifth]]s. [[William Holder]], for whom the Holdrian comma is named, favored this latter unit because the intervals of 53 equal temperament are closer to [[Pythagorean tuning]] than that of 55.  Thus '''Mercator's comma''' and the Holdrian comma are two distinct but related intervals.\n\n== Arabian comma ==\nThe name \"Arabian comma\" may be inaccurate; the comma has been employed mainly in Turkish music theory by [[Kemal Ilerici]], and by the Turkish composer [[Erol Sayan]]. The name of this comma is \"Holder koması\" in Turkish.\n\nFor instance, the [[makam]] ''rast'' (similar to the Western [[major scale]]) may be considered in terms of Holdrian commas:\n{|\n|-\n| ''c'' ||  || ''d'' ||  || ''e'' ||  || ''f'' ||  || ''g'' ||  || ''a'' ||  || ''b'' ||  || ''c'''\n|-\n|  || 9 ||  || 8* ||  || 5* ||  || 9 ||  || 9 ||  || 8 ||  || 5 ||  \n|}\n(In common Arabic and Turkish practice, the third note ''e'' in rast is lower than in this theory, almost exactly halfway between western major and minor thirds, i.e. closer to 6,5 commas above ''d'' and 6,5 below ''f'', the third ''c-e'' often referred to as a \"[[neutral third]]\" by musicologists.)\n\nwhile in contrast, the makam ''nihavend'' (similar to the Western [[minor scale]]):\n{|\n|-\n| ''c'' ||  || ''d'' ||  || ''e''{{music|flat}} ||  || ''f'' ||  || ''g'' ||  || ''a''{{music|flat}} ||  || ''b''{{music|flat}} ||  || ''c'''\n|-\n|  || 9 ||  || 4 ||  || 9 ||  || 9 ||  || 4 ||  || 9 ||  || 9 || \n|}\nhas [[medium second]]s between d–e{{music|flat}}, e–f, g–a{{music|flat}}, a{{music|flat}}–b{{music|flat}}, and b{{music|flat}}–c', a medium second being somewhere in between 8 and 9 commas.<ref name=\"Touma\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Holder, William, ''A Treatise on the Natural Grounds, and Principles of Harmony'', facsimile of the 1694 edition, Broude Brothers, New York, 1967.

      "text": "The '''millioctave''' ('''mO''') is a unit of measurement for musical [[interval (music)|intervals]]. As is expected from the prefix [[milli-]], a millioctave is defined as 1/1000 of an [[octave]]. From this it follows that one millioctave is equal to the ratio 2<sup>1/1000</sup>, the 1000th root of 2, or approximately 1.0006934 ({{Audio|Millioctave on C.mid|play}}).\n\nGiven two frequencies ''a'' and ''b'', the measurement of the interval between them in millioctaves can be calculated by\n\n:<math>n = 1000 \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right) \\approx 3322 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right)</math>\n\nLikewise, if you know a note ''b'' and the number ''n'' of millioctaves in the interval, then the other note ''a'' may be calculated by:\n\n:<math>a = b \\times 2 ^ \\frac{n}{1000}</math>\n\nLike the more common [[cent (music)|cent]], the millioctave is a linear measure of intervals, and thus the size of intervals can be calculated by adding their millioctave values, instead of multiplication, which is necessary for calculations of frequencies.\n\nA millioctave is exactly 1.2 cents.\n\n== History and use ==\n\nThe millioctave was introduced by the German physicist [[Arthur von Oettingen]] in his book ''Das duale Harmoniesystem'' (1913).

      "text": "{{For|the French physicist from whom the savart takes its name|Félix Savart}}\n[[Image:Five decades visualization.svg|thumb|1/100 heptaméride (jot), 1/10 heptaméride (decameride), 1 heptamérides, 10 heptamérides, 100 heptamérides, 1,000 heptamérides (decade).]]\n\nThe '''savart''' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɑr}} is a unit of measurement for musical [[list of pitch intervals|pitch intervals]] ({{Audio|Savart on C.mid|play}}). One savart is equal to one thousandth of a [[decade (log scale)|decade]] ([[just major third|10/1]]: 3,986.313714 cents): 3.9863 cents.  Musically, in just intonation, the interval of a decade is precisely a just major twenty-fourth, or, in other words, three octaves and a just major third.  Today the savart has largely been replaced by the [[cent (music)|cent]] and the [[millioctave]]. The savart is practically the same as the earlier '''heptameride''' (eptameride), one seventh of a '''meride'''. [[Powers of 10|One tenth]] of an heptameride is a '''decameride''' and a hundredth of an heptameride (thousandth of a decade) is approximately one '''jot'''.\n\n==Definition==\n\nIf <math>\\frac{f_1}{f_2}</math> is the ratio of [[frequency|frequencies]] of a given interval, the corresponding measure in savarts is given by:\n\n<math>s = 1000 \\log_{10}{\\frac{f_1}{f_2}}</math>\n\nor\n\n<math>\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = 10^{s/1000}</math>\n\nLike the more common cent, the savart is a [[logarithm]]ic measure, and thus intervals can be added by simply adding their savart values, instead of multiplying them as you would frequencies. The number of savarts in an octave is 1000 times the base-10 logarithm of 2, or nearly 301.03. Sometimes this is rounded to 300, which makes the unit more useful for [[equal temperament]].<ref name=\"hf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/measures.html|title=Logarithmic Interval Measures|author=Huygens-Fokker Foundation|authorlink=Huygens-Fokker Foundation|accessdate=2007-06-13 |<!-- archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214012515/http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/measures.html --> <!-- Bot retrieved archive |archivedate = 2007-02-14 -->}}</ref>\n\n==Conversion==\n\nThe conversion from savarts into cents or millioctaves is:\n\n<math>1\\ \\mathrm{savart} = \\frac{1.2}{\\log_{10}{2}}\\ \\mathrm{cent} \\approx 3.9863\\ \\mathrm{cent}</math>\n\n<math>1\\ \\mathrm{savart} = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}{2}}\\ \\mathrm{millioctave} \\approx 3.3219\\ \\mathrm{millioctave}</math>\n\n==History==\n\nThe savart is named after the French physicist and doctor [[Félix Savart]] (1791–1841) who advocated the earlier similar interval of the French acoustician [[Joseph Sauveur]] (1653–1716).  Sauveur proposed the ''méride'', ''eptaméride'' (or ''heptaméride''), and ''decaméride''.  In English these are meride, heptameride, and decameride respectively.  The octave is divided into 43 merides, the meride is divided into seven heptamerides, and the heptameride is divided into ten decamerides. There are thus {{nowrap|43 &times; 7 {{=}} 301}} heptamerides in an octave.<ref>Hermann von Helmholtz (1912). ''On the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music'', p.437. Longmans, Green.</ref> The attraction of this scheme to Sauveur was that log<sub>10</sub>(2) is very close to .301, and thus the number of heptamerides in a given ratio is found to a high degree of accuracy from simply its log times 1000.  This is equivalent to assuming 1000 heptamerides in a decade rather than 301 in an octave, the same as Savart's definition.  The unit was given the name ''savart'' sometime in the 20th century.<ref name=\"hf\"/>  A disadvantage of this scheme is that there are not an exact number of heptamerides/savarts in an [[equal tempered]] semitone.  For this reason Alexander Wood used a modified definition of the savart, with 300 savarts in an octave, and hence 25 savarts in a semitone.<ref>Alexander Wood, ''The Physics of Music'', pages 53-54, Read Books, 2007 {{ISBN|140674493X}} (first published Methuen, 1944 {{OCLC|220112916}}.</ref>\n\nA related unit is the jot, of which there are 30103 in an octave, or approximately 100,000 in a decade.  The jot is defined in a similar way to the savart, but has a more accurate rounding of log<sub>10</sub>(2) because more digits are used.<ref>Joe Monzo, [http://tonalsoft.com/enc/h/heptameride.aspx \"Heptaméride\"] and [http://tonalsoft.com/enc/j/jot.aspx \"Jot\"], ''Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory'', retrieved and [https://www.webcitation.org/6BLS4KwYL archived][https://www.webcitation.org/6BLRsdAeS] 11 October 2012.</ref>  There are approximately 100 jots in a savart.  The unit was first described by [[Augustus de Morgan]] (1806-1871) which he called an ''atom''.  The name ''jot'' was coined by [[John Curwen]] (1816-1880) at the suggestion of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].<ref>Hermann von Helmholtz, (trans. A. J.

De Gruyter. {{ISBN|9783110527834}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early life===\n\nJulián Carrillo was a native of the state of [[San Luis Potosí]] in [[Mexico]]. He attended the [[National Conservatory of Music (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in [[Mexico City]], where he studied Violin, Composition, [[Physics]], [[Acoustics]], and [[Mathematics]]. The laws that define music intervals instantly amazed Carrillo, which led him to conduct experiments on his violin. He began analyzing the way the pitch of a string changed depending on the finger position, concluding that there had to be a way to split the string into an infinite number of parts. One day, Carrillo was able to divide the fourth string of his violin with a [[razor]] into 16 parts in the interval between the notes G and A, thus creating 16 unique sounds. This event was the beginning of Sonido 13 that led Carrillo to study more about physics and the nature of intervals.\n\n===Professional life===\n\nCarrillo became an excellent musician at the Conservatory and received a scholarship to study in Leipzig Royal Conservatory. After Carrillo returned to Mexico in 1918, he became [[Conducting|conductor]] of the National Symphony Orchestra and in 1920 he also became [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of the National Conservatory of Music. It was during this time that he began to invest a significant amount of time on Sonido 13. His achievements in this area were extensive and consisted of writing over 20 books, making more than 40 compositions, patenting fifteen pianos capable of producing small intervals, and organizing the Sonido 13 Symphonic Orchestra that performed in different parts of the world, playing microtonal music composed by Carrillo in different intervals. In 1933, Ahualulco, the town where Julián Carrillo was born, was renamed to Ahualulco del Sonido 13 in honor of Carrillo's work.\n\nCarrillo was, \"closely associated with the [[Díaz regime]],\" and preferred [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classicism]] to [[Musical nationalism|nationalism]].<ref name=\"Cultural\">Bethell, Leslie, ed. (1998). ''A Cultural History of Latin America: Literature, Music and the Visual Arts in the 19th and 20th Centuries'', p.95. {{ISBN|0-521-62626-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Music theory==\n\n===Introduction===\n\nJulián Carrillo was a pioneer of microtonal music in the Western world. Julián Carrillo started dividing [[Major second|whole tones (major seconds)]] into 16 intervals, but he did not stop there. Through experiments, Carrillo noticed that he could divide the string into an infinite number of intervals, or into as many intervals as it is physically possible. Carrillo created intervals of 3 ({{audio|Third-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 4 ({{audio|Quarter tone on C.mid|Play}}), 5 ({{audio|Fifth-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 16 ({{audio|Sixteenth-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 32 ({{audio|Thirty-second tone on C.mid|Play}}), 64 ({{audio|Sixty-fourth tone on C.mid|Play}}), and 128 ({{audio|One-hundred and twenty-eighth tone on C.mid|Play}}) tones within a major second<!--18, 24, 30, 96, 192, 384, 768 tone equal temperaments-->, leaving the formula to create more, if desired. However, as the number of intervals increases it becomes harder to distinguish the notes from each other (see [[just noticeable difference]]).\n\n===Notation===\n\nBecause new sets of sounds were created, it was imperative to make a new notation system. Carrillo developed an easy method for notation, which would help people not familiar with previous forms of notation to quickly learn to read and write music.\n\nTo show how easy the new writing system was, Carrillo gave two [[New York (state)|New York]] [[elementary school]] boys, who had no prior knowledge of Sonido 13, a simple work by [[Bach]] to convert to his notation system. The boys accomplished the task in less than an hour, proving that the new writing method was easy to learn.\n\nThe new writing system is not as graphic as the conventional [[Staff (music)|staff or stave]], and instead of calling the notes by a letter or a syllable (Do, Re, Mi, etc.) they are represented by a number. The numbering system starts with a zero and increments by one until the last note of the octave is reached. Within this system, the number of notes in an octave is dependent on the number of intervals that one wishes to create within a whole tone.\n\n[[File:Sonido13RegularOctave.png|frame|center|From Carrillo's \"Teoría Lógica de la Música\" ({{lang-en|Logical Theory of the Music}}) Converting current notes (above) to the new notation system (below). There are no smaller intervals in this case.]]\n\nCarrillo used many intervals, although mainly in multiples of 4 such as 16, 32, and 64 so that between each of the whole tones, 16, 32, or 64 additional notes were created. Carrillo called these intervals 16hs of a tone, 32nds of a tone, and 64ths of a tone, respectively. As a result, C would be labeled 0, D flat would be labeled 8, D would be labeled 16, E flat would be labeled 24, E would be labeled 32, etc., for 16ths of a tone.\n\n[[File:Sonido13WholeSixteenthTones.png|frame|center|From Carrillo's \"Teoría Lógica de la Música\" ({{lang-en|Logical Theory of the Music}}). Converting current notation (above) to sixteenths of a tone to the new notation system (below). 96-tet]]\n\nWhen notating music, Carrillo used a staff.  However, instead of using lines to signify different notes, he used the lines to distinguish between octaves so that each line on the staff represents a different octave.  For example, if 0 on the second line of the staff denoted what conventional music terms [[middle C]], 0 on the third line would refer to C an octave higher, and 0 on the first line would refer to C an octave lower.\n\n===Musical instruments===\n\nThis system added sounds unexplored by generations of musicians, so new adaptations of current instruments had to be made to support the small intervals, and for this reason the instruments were reduced in the number of octaves they contained. For example, a standard [[piano]] has 88 keys that cover more than 7 octaves, and a piano with 88 keys made for 16ths of a tone would not constitute a full octave. To have the same number of octaves as a conventional piano, a piano for 16ths of a tone would need 704 keys. So, using logic and innovative thoughts of modern [[luthier]]s, a traditional piano will be enriched infinitely. Every existing instrument has to be modified to adapt to the new rules of the Sonido 13 system, but also new instruments have to be designed and created. Thus, modern luthiers have an almost fantastic but still unexplored world in front of them, except by Carrillo's mind.\n\n==Latest news==\n\nNew efforts are being done to resurrect the 13th Sound music and theory. In 2005 Mexican cellist Jimena Gimenez recently recorded the entire Carrillo's Cello Sonatas and Mexican-Quebecer guitarist Angélos Quetzalcóatl (The \"Ambassador\" of the 13th Sound) recorded almost all the guitar repertoire.\n\nBesides these recording efforts, new music is being created using the Sonido 13 teachings and the Official Julián Carrillo Website was created by 13th sound musician Hugo Vargas. The website soon became extremely popular among Sonido 13 researchers and it gained the \"Official\" Status in 2009 thanks to the decision of Angel and Miguel Carrillo, executors of the Julián Carrillo Estate.\n\nThe \"Ambassador of the 13th Sound\" travels around the world promoting the 13th Sound principles which are:\n\n1. To Purify Music.\n\n2. To Enrich Music.\n\n3.

For example, some 17th- and 18th-century theorists used the term to describe the distance between a sharp and enharmonically distinct flat in mean-tone temperaments (e.g., D{{Music|sharp}}–E{{Music|flat}}).<ref name=JR /> In the quarter-tone scale, also called '''24 tone equal temperament''' (24-TET), the quarter tone is 50 [[cent (music)|cents]], or a frequency ratio of {{radic|2|24}} or approximately 1.0293, and divides the octave into 24 equal steps ([[equal temperament]]). In this scale the quarter tone is the smallest [[step (music)|step]]. A semitone is thus made of two steps, and three steps make a '''three-quarter tone''' {{audio|Neutral second on C.mid|play}} or [[neutral second]], half of a [[minor third]]. The 8-TET scale is composed of three-quarter tones ({{audio|8-tet scale on C.mid|Play}}). Four steps make a whole tone {{audio|Major second on C.mid|play}}.\n\nIn [[just intonation]] the quarter tone can be represented by the [[septimal quarter tone]], 36:35 (48.77 cents), or by the undecimal quarter tone, 33:32 (53.27 cents), approximately half the semitone of 16:15 or 25:24. The ratio of 36:35 is only 1.23 cents narrower than a 24-TET quarter tone. This just ratio is also the difference between a [[minor third]] (6:5) and [[septimal minor third]] (7:6).\n\nQuarter tones and intervals close to them also occur in a number of other equally tempered tuning systems. [[22 equal temperament|22-TET]] contains an interval of 54.55 cents, slightly wider than a quarter-tone, whereas [[53 equal temperament|53-TET]] has an interval of 45.28 cents, slightly smaller. [[72 equal temperament|72-TET]] also has equally tempered quarter-tones, and indeed contains three quarter-tone scales, since 72 is divisible by 24. The smallest interval in [[31 equal temperament]] (the \"diesis\" of 38.71 cents) is half a [[chromatic semitone]], one-third of a [[diatonic semitone]] and one-fifth of a whole tone, so it may function as a quarter tone, a fifth-tone ''or'' a sixth-tone.\n\nComposer [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]], to accommodate the [[just interval|just]] septimal quarter tone, uses a small \"7\" ({{music|7}}) as an accidental to indicate a note is lowered 49 cents, or an upside down \"<span style=\"display:inline-block;top:0.5em;-moz-transform: matrix(-1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0);-webkit-transform: matrix(-1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0);-o-transform:matrix(-1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0);transform:matrix(-1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0);\">7</span>\" ({{music|L}}) to indicate a note is raised 49 cents,<ref>Douglas Keislar; Easley Blackwood; John Eaton; Lou Harrison; Ben Johnston; Joel Mandelbaum; William Schottstaedt. p.193. \"Six American Composers on Nonstandard Tunnings\", ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 1.

As this requires neither a special instrument nor special techniques, much quarter toned music is written for pairs of pianos, violins, harps, etc. The retuning of the instrument, and then returning it to its former pitch, is easy for violins, harder for harps, and slow and relatively expensive for pianos.\n\nThe following deals with the ability of single instruments to produce quarter tones. In Western instruments, this means \"in addition to the usual 12-tone system\".\n\nBecause many musical instruments manufactured today (2018) are designed for the 12-tone scale, not all are usable for playing quarter tones. Sometimes special playing techniques must be used.\n\nConventional musical instruments that ''cannot'' play quarter tones (except by using special techniques—see below) include:\n* Most standard or unmodified non-electronic keyboard instruments, such as [[piano]]s, [[Organ (instrument)|organs]], and [[accordion]]s\n* [[Fret]]ted [[string instruments]] such as [[guitars]], [[bass guitars]], and [[ukulele]]s (though on these it is possible to play quarter tones by [[Bend (guitar)|pitch-bending]], with special tunings, or with customized necks)\n* [[Percussion instrument#Definite pitch|Pitched percussion instruments]], if standard techniques are used, and if the instruments are not tunable\n* Western [[wind instruments]] that use keys or valves\n** [[Woodwind instruments]], such as clarinets, saxophones, flutes, and oboes (though with many of these, it is still possible using non-standard techniques such as special fingerings or by the player manipulating their [[embouchure]], to play at least ''some'' quarter tones, if not a whole scale)\n** Valved brass instruments ([[trumpet]], [[tuba]]) (though, as with woodwinds, embouchure manipulation, as well as [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic]] tones that fall closer to quarter-tones than half-tones, make quarter-tone scales possible; the [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] technique of adjusting pitch with the right hand in the bell makes this instrument an exception)\n\nConventional musical instruments that ''can'' play quarter tones include\n* Electronic instruments:\n** [[Synthesizer]]s, using either special keyboard controllers or continuous-pitch controllers such as [[Synthesizer#Fingerboard controller|fingerboard controllers]], or when controlled by a [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] capable of outputting quarter-tone control signals.\n** [[Theremin]]s and other [[:Category:Continuous pitch instruments|continuously pitched instruments]]\n* Fretless string instruments, such as the [[violin family]], [[fretless guitar]]s, fretless electric basses, [[oud]]s, and members of the [[huqin]] family of instruments.\n* String instruments with movable frets (such as the [[sitar]])\n* Specially fretted string instruments (such as the Turkish [[bağlama]]).\n* Fretted string instruments [[guitar tunings|specially tuned]]<!--As in using the normal fret board, but tuning some string(s) a quarter-tone off what one would otherwise normally tune them--> to quarter tones\n* [[Pedal steel guitar]]\n* Wind instruments whose main means of tone-control is a slide, such as [[trombone]]s, the [[P. D. Q. Bach#Tromboon|tromboon]] invented by [[P. D. Q. Bach]], the [[slide trumpet]] and the [[slide whistle]]\n* Specially keyed woodwind instruments. A [[quarter tone clarinet]] was built by Fritz Schüller (1883–1977) of [[Markneukirchen]], and a quarter tone mechanism for flutes by Eva Kingma.\n* Valved brass instruments with extra, quarter-tone valves, and natural brass instruments that play through the [[Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning|11th and 13th partials of the harmonic series]]\n* [[Kazoo]]\n* [[Percussion instrument#Definite pitch|Pitched percussion instruments]], when tuning permits (e.g., timpani), or using special techniques\n\nOther instruments can be used to play quarter tones when using [[audio signal processing]] effects such as [[Pitch shifter (audio processor)|pitch shifting]].\n\nQuarter-tone pianos have been built, which consist essentially of two pianos with two keyboards stacked one above the other in a single case, one tuned a quarter tone higher than the other.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n== Music of the Middle East ==\n{{See also|Persian traditional music|Arabic music|Arab tone system}}\n\nMany Persian [[dastgah]] and Arabic [[Arabic maqam|''maqamat'']] contain intervals of three-quarter tone size; a short list of these follows.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Spector | first = Johanna |date=May 1970 | title = Classical ʿUd Music in Egypt with Special Reference to Maqamat | journal = Ethnomusicology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–257 | jstor = 00141836 | format = | doi = 10.2307/849799}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}<!--Jstor link is dead--></ref>\n\n#[[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] ({{lang|ar|بیاتی}}): D E{{music|d}} F G A B{{music|b}} C D\n#:<score override_ogg=\"Arabic-scale bayati.ogg\">\n\\relative c' {\n\\time 8/4 \\omit Staff.TimeSignature\nd4 eeh f g a bes c d \\bar \"|\"\n}\n</score>\n#[[Rast (maqam)|Rast]] ({{lang|ar|راست}}):\n#:C D E{{music|d}} F G A B{{music|d}} C (ascending)\n#:C B{{music|b}} A G F E{{music|d}} D C (descending)\n#:<score override_ogg=\"Arabic-scale rast.ogg\">\n\\relative c' {\n\\time 8/4 \\omit Staff.TimeSignature\nc4 d eeh f g a beh c \\bar \"|\"\n}\n</score>\n#[[Saba (maqam)|Saba]] ({{lang|ar|صبا}}): D E{{music|d}} F G{{music|b}} A B{{music|b}} C D\n#:<score override_ogg=\"Arabic-scale saba.ogg\">\n\\relative c' {\n\\time 8/4 \\omit Staff.TimeSignature\nd4 eeh f ges a bes c d \\bar \"|\"\n}\n</score>\n#[[Sigah]] ({{lang|ar|سه گاه}}): E{{music|d}} F G A B{{music|d}} C D E{{music|d}}\n#:<score vorbis=1>\n\\relative c' {\n\\time 8/4 \\omit Staff.TimeSignature\neeh f g a beh c d eeh \\bar \"|\"\n}\n</score>\n#[[Ajam (maqam)|‘Ajam]] ({{lang|ar|عجم}})\n#Hoseyni\n\nThe Islamic philosopher and scientist [[Al-Farabi]] described a number of intervals in his work in music, including a number of quarter tones.\n\nAssyrian/Syriac Church Music Scale:<ref>Asaad, Gabriel (1990).

Intervals matched particularly closely include the [[neutral second]], [[neutral third]], and (11:8) ratio, or the 11th harmonic. The [[septimal minor third]] and [[septimal major third]] are approximated rather poorly; the (13:10) and (15:13) ratios, involving the 13th harmonic, are matched very closely. Overall, 24-TET can be viewed as matching the 11th and 13th harmonics more closely than the 7th.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Musical temperament]]\n* [[List of quarter tone pieces]]\n* [[List of meantone intervals]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Bartolozzi, Bruno (1967).

The lesser undecimal neutral second may be derived from the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] as the interval between the [[eleventh harmonic|eleventh]] and twelfth harmonics.

The name derives from the interval being the [[7-limit]] approximation of a [[quarter tone]]. The [[7-limit|septimal]] quarter tone can be viewed either as a musical interval in its own right, or as a [[septimal comma|comma]]; if it is tempered out in a given tuning system, the distinction between the two different types of minor thirds is lost.

      "text": "{{short description|Statistical model for a binary dependent variable}}\n{{distinguish-redirect|Logit model|Logit function}}\nIn [[statistics]], the '''logistic model''' (or '''logit model''') is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.  This can be combined to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc...  Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1 and the sum adding to one.\n\nLogistic regression is a [[statistical model]] that in its basic form uses a [[logistic function]] to model a [[binary variable|binary]] [[dependent variable]], although many more complex [[#Extensions|extensions]] exist. In [[regression analysis]], '''logistic regression''' (or '''logit regression''') is [[estimation theory|estimating]] the parameters of a logistic model (a form of [[binary regression]]). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an [[indicator variable]], where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\". In the logistic model, the [[log-odds]] (the [[logarithm]] of the [[odds]]) for the value labeled \"1\" is a [[linear function (calculus)|linear combination]] of one or more [[independent variable]]s (\"predictors\"); the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a [[continuous variable]] (any real value). The corresponding [[probability]] of the value labeled \"1\" can vary between 0 (certainly the value \"0\") and 1 (certainly the value \"1\"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. The [[unit of measurement]] for the log-odds scale is called a ''[[logit]]'', from '''''log'''istic un'''it''''', hence the alternative names. Analogous models with a different [[sigmoid function]] instead of the logistic function can also be used, such as the [[probit model]]; the defining characteristic of the logistic model is that increasing one of the independent variables multiplicatively scales the odds of the given outcome at a ''constant'' rate, with each dependent variable having its own parameter; for a binary independent variable this generalizes the [[odds ratio]].\n\nThe binary logistic regression model has [[#Extensions|extensions]] to more than two levels of the dependent variable: [[categorical variable|categorical]] outputs with more than two values are modeled by [[multinomial logistic regression]], and if the multiple categories are [[Level of measurement#Ordinal type|ordered]], by [[ordinal logistic regression]], for example the proportional odds ordinal logistic model.<ref name=wal67est /> The model itself simply models probability of output in terms of input, and does not perform [[statistical classification]] (it is not a classifier), though it can be used to make a classifier, for instance by choosing a cutoff value and classifying inputs with probability greater than the cutoff as one class, below the cutoff as the other; this is a common way to make a [[binary classifier]]. The coefficients are generally not computed by a closed-form expression, unlike [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]]; see {{section link||Model fitting}}. The logistic regression as a general statistical model was originally developed and popularized primarily by [[Joseph Berkson]],{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=8}} beginning in {{harvtxt|Berkson|1944}}, where he coined \"logit\"; see {{slink||History}}.\n\n{{Regression bar}}\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Applications==\nLogistic regression is used in various fields, including machine learning, most medical fields, and social sciences.

[[Conditional random field]]s, an extension of logistic regression to sequential data, are used in [[natural language processing]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Logistic model===\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=March 2019|details=do we really need to use <math>b</math> and other not common bases in an example?}}\n\nLet us try to understand logistic regression by considering a logistic model with given parameters, then seeing how the coefficients can be estimated from data. Consider a model with two predictors, <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math>, and one binary (Bernoulli) response variable <math>Y</math>, for which we denote <math>p=P(Y=1)</math>. We assume a [[linear model|linear relationship]] between the predictor variables, and the [[log-odds]] of the event that <math>Y=1</math>. This linear relationship can be written in the following mathematical form (where ''ℓ'' is the log-odds, <math>b</math> is the base of the logarithm, and <math>\\beta_i</math> are parameters of the model):\n\n:<math>\\ell = \\log_b \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2</math>\n\nWe can recover the [[odds]] by exponentiating the log-odds:\n\n:<math>\\frac{p}{1-p} = b^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2}</math>.\n\nBy simple algebraic manipulation, the probability that <math>Y=1</math> is\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{b^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2}}{b^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2} + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + b^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2)}}</math>.\n\nThe above formula shows that once <math>\\beta_i</math> are fixed, we can easily compute either the log-odds that <math>Y=1</math> for a given observation, or the probability that <math>Y=1</math> for a given observation. The main use-case of a logistic model is to be given an observation <math>(x_1,x_2)</math>, and estimate the probability ``<math>p</math>`` that <math>Y=1</math>. In most applications, the base <math>b</math> of the logarithm is usually taken to be ``[[E_(mathematical_constant)|e]]``. However in some cases it can be easier to communicate results by working in base 2, or base 10.\n\nWe consider an example with <math>b=10</math>, and coefficients <math>\\beta_0=-3</math>, <math>\\beta_1=1</math>, and <math>\\beta_2=2</math>. To be concrete, the model is\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}\\frac{p}{1 - p} = \\ell = -3 + x_1 + 2 x_2</math>\n\nwhere <math>p</math> is the probability of the event that <math>Y=1</math>.\n\nThis can be interpreted as follows:\n\n* <math>\\beta_0 = -3</math> is the [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]]. It is the log-odds of the event that <math>Y=1</math>, when the predictors <math>x_1=x_2=0</math>. By exponentiating, we can see that when <math>x_1=x_2=0</math> the odds of the event that <math>Y=1</math> are 1-to-1000, or <math>10^{-3}</math>. Similarly, the probability of the event that <math>Y=1</math> when <math>x_1=x_2=0</math> can be computed as <math> 1/(1000 + 1) = 1/1001</math>.\n* <math>\\beta_1 = 1</math> means that increasing <math>x_1</math> by 1 increases the log-odds by <math>1</math>. So if <math>x_1</math> increases by 1, the odds that <math>Y=1</math> increase by a factor of <math>10^1</math>.\n* <math>\\beta_2 = 2</math> means that increasing <math>x_2</math> by 1 increases the log-odds by <math>2</math>. So if <math>x_2</math> increases by 1, the odds that <math>Y=1</math> increase by a factor of <math>10^2.</math> Note how the effect of <math>x_2</math> on the log-odds is twice as great as the effect of <math>x_1</math>, but the effect on the odds is 10 times greater.\n\nIn order to estimate the parameters <math>\\beta_i</math> from data, one must do logistic regression.\n\n===Probability of passing an exam versus hours of study===\nTo answer the following question:\n<blockquote>\nA group of 20 students spends between 0 and 6 hours studying for an exam. How does the number of hours spent studying effect the probability of the student passing the exam?\n</blockquote>\n\nThe reason for using logistic regression for this problem is that the values of the dependent variable, pass and fail, while represented by \"1\" and \"0\", are not [[cardinal number]]s. If the problem was changed so that pass/fail was replaced with the grade 0–100 (cardinal numbers), then simple [[regression analysis]] could be used.\n\nThe table shows the number of hours each student spent studying, and whether they passed (1) or failed (0).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Hours\n| 0.50|| 0.75|| 1.00|| 1.25|| 1.50|| 1.75|| 1.75|| 2.00|| 2.25|| 2.50|| 2.75|| 3.00|| 3.25|| 3.50|| 4.00|| 4.25|| 4.50|| 4.75|| 5.00 || 5.50\n|-\n!

The output also provides the coefficients for <math>\\text{Intercept} = - 4.0777</math> and <math>\\text{Hours} = 1.5046</math>. These coefficients are entered in the logistic regression equation to estimate the odds (probability) of passing the exam:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Log-odds of passing exam} &= 1.5046 \\cdot \\text{Hours} - 4.0777 = 1.5046 \\cdot (\\text{Hours} - 2.71) \\\\\n\\text{Odds of passing exam} &= \\exp\\left(1.5046 \\cdot \\text{Hours} - 4.0777 \\right)= \\exp\\left(1.5046 \\cdot (\\text{Hours} - 2.71)\\right) \\\\\n\\text{Probability of passing exam} &= \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp \\left( - \\left( 1.5046 \\cdot \\text{Hours} - 4.0777 \\right) \\right) }\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nOne additional hour of study is estimated to increase log-odds of passing by 1.5046, so multiplying odds of passing by <math>\\exp(1.5046) \\approx 4.5.</math> The form with the ''x''-intercept (2.71) shows that this estimates [[even odds]] (log-odds 0, odds 1, probability 1/2) for a student who studies 2.71 hours.\n\nFor example, for a student who studies 2 hours, entering the value <math>\\text{Hours} = 2</math> in the equation gives the estimated probability of passing the exam of 0.26:\n\n: <math>\n\\text{Probability of passing exam} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left( - \\left( 1.5046 \\cdot 2 - 4.0777 \\right) \\right) } = 0.26\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, for a student who studies 4 hours, the estimated probability of passing the exam is 0.87:\n\n: <math>\n\\text{Probability of passing exam} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left( - \\left( 1.5046 \\cdot 4 -  4.0777 \\right) \\right) } = 0.87\n</math>\n\nThis table shows the probability of passing the exam for several values of hours studying.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Hours<br>of study\n! colspan=\"3\" | Passing exam\n|-\n!

Rather than the Wald method, the recommended method {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=January 2017}} to calculate the p-value for logistic regression is the [[likelihood-ratio test]] (LRT), which for this data gives <math>p = 0.0006</math>.\n\n==Discussion==\nLogistic regression can be binomial, ordinal or multinomial. Binomial or binary logistic regression deals with situations in which the observed outcome for a [[dependent variable]] can have only two possible types, \"0\" and \"1\" (which may represent, for example, \"dead\" vs. \"alive\" or \"win\" vs. \"loss\"). [[multinomial logit|Multinomial logistic regression]] deals with situations where the outcome can have three or more possible types (e.g., \"disease A\" vs. \"disease B\" vs. \"disease C\") that are not ordered. [[Ordinal logistic regression]] deals with dependent variables that are ordered.\n\nIn binary logistic regression, the outcome is usually coded as \"0\" or \"1\", as this leads to the most straightforward interpretation.<ref name=Hosmer/>  If a particular observed outcome for the dependent variable is the noteworthy possible outcome (referred to as a \"success\" or a \"case\") it is usually coded as \"1\" and the contrary outcome (referred to as a \"failure\" or a \"noncase\") as \"0\". Binary logistic regression is used to predict the [[odds]] of being a case based on the values of the [[independent variable]]s (predictors). The odds are defined as the probability that a particular outcome is a case divided by the probability that it is a noncase.\n\nLike other forms of [[regression analysis]], logistic regression makes use of one or more predictor variables that may be either continuous or categorical. Unlike ordinary linear regression, however, logistic regression is used for predicting dependent variables that take [[categorical variable|membership in one of a limited number of categories]] (treating the dependent variable in the binomial case as the outcome of a [[Bernoulli trial]]) rather than a continuous outcome. Given this difference, the assumptions of linear regression are violated. In particular, the residuals cannot be normally distributed. In addition, linear regression may make nonsensical predictions for a binary dependent variable. What is needed is a way to convert a binary variable into a continuous one that can take on any real value (negative or positive). To do that, binomial logistic regression first calculates the [[odds]] of the event happening for different levels of each independent variable, and then takes its [[logarithm]] to create a continuous criterion as a transformed version of the dependent variable. The logarithm of the odds is the [[logit]] of the probability, the logit is defined as follows:\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{logit} p = \\ln \\frac p {1-p} \\quad \\text{for } 0<p<1. </math>\n\nAlthough the dependent variable in logistic regression is Bernoulli, the logit is on an unrestricted scale.<ref name=Hosmer/> The logit function is the [[link function]] in this kind of generalized linear model, i.e.\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{logit} \\operatorname E(Y) = \\alpha+\\beta x </math>\n\n''Y'' is the Bernoulli-distributed response variable and ''x'' is the predictor variable.\n\nThe logit of the probability of success is then fitted to the predictors. The predicted value of the logit is converted back into predicted odds via the inverse of the natural logarithm, namely the [[exponential function]]. Thus, although the observed dependent variable in binary logistic regression is a 0-or-1 variable, the logistic regression estimates the odds, as a continuous variable, that the dependent variable is a success (a case). In some applications, the odds are all that is needed. In others, a specific yes-or-no prediction is needed for whether the dependent variable is or is not a case; this categorical prediction can be based on the computed odds of success, with predicted odds above some chosen cutoff value being translated into a prediction of success.\n\nThe assumption of linear predictor effects can easily be relaxed using techniques such as [[Spline (mathematics)|spline functions]].<ref name=rms/>\n\n==Logistic regression vs. other approaches==\nLogistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a [[logistic function]], which is the cumulative [[logistic distribution]]. Thus, it treats the same set of problems as [[probit regression]] using similar techniques, with the latter using a cumulative normal distribution curve instead.  Equivalently, in the latent variable interpretations of these two methods, the first assumes a standard [[logistic distribution]] of errors and the second a standard [[normal distribution]] of errors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lecture Notes on Generalized Linear Models|last=Rodríguez|first=G.|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 3, page 45|quote=|via=http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/notes/}}</ref>\n\nLogistic regression can be seen as a special case of the [[generalized linear model]] and thus analogous to [[linear regression]]. The model of logistic regression, however, is based on quite different assumptions (about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables) from those of linear regression. In particular, the key differences between these two models can be seen in the following two features of logistic regression. First, the conditional distribution <math>y \\mid x</math> is a [[Bernoulli distribution]] rather than a [[Gaussian distribution]], because the dependent variable is binary. Second, the predicted values are probabilities and are therefore restricted to (0,1) through the [[logistic function|logistic distribution function]] because logistic regression predicts the '''probability''' of particular outcomes rather than the outcomes themselves.\n\nLogistic regression is an alternative to Fisher's 1936 method, [[linear discriminant analysis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gareth James |author2=Daniela Witten |author3=Trevor Hastie |author4=Robert Tibshirani |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning |publisher=Springer |year=2013 |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ |page=6}}</ref>  If the assumptions of linear discriminant analysis hold, the conditioning can be reversed to produce logistic regression.  The converse is not true, however, because logistic regression does not require the multivariate normal assumption of discriminant analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pohar|first=Maja|last2=Blas|first2=Mateja|last3=Turk|first3=Sandra|year=2004|title=Comparison of Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis: A Simulation Study|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229021894|journal=Metodološki Zvezki|volume= 1|issue= 1|asin=}}</ref>\n\n==Latent variable interpretation==\nThe logistic regression can be understood simply as finding the <math>\\beta</math> parameters that best fit:\n\n:<math>y = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon > 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{else} \\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon</math> is an error distributed by the standard [[logistic distribution]].  (If the standard normal distribution is used instead, it is a [[probit model]].)\n\nThe associated latent variable is <math>y' = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon</math>. The error term <math>\\varepsilon</math> is not observed, and so the <math>y'</math> is also an unobservable, hence termed \"latent\" (the observed data are values of <math>y</math> and <math>x</math>). Unlike ordinary regression, however, the <math>\\beta</math> parameters cannot be expressed by any direct formula of the <math>y</math> and <math>x</math> values in the observed data.  Instead they are to be found by an iterative search process, usually implemented by a software program, that finds the maximum of a complicated \"likelihood expression\" that is a function of all of the observed <math>y</math> and <math>x</math> values.  The estimation approach is explained below.\n\n==Logistic function, odds, odds ratio, and logit==\n[[Image:Logistic-curve.svg|thumb|320px|right|Figure 1. The standard logistic function <math>\\sigma (t)</math>; note that <math>\\sigma (t) \\in (0,1)</math> for all <math>t</math>.]]\n\n===Definition of the logistic function===\nAn explanation of logistic regression can begin with an explanation of the standard [[logistic function]]. The logistic function is a [[sigmoid function]], which takes any [[Real number|real]] input <math>t</math>, (<math>t\\in \\mathbb R</math>), and outputs a value between zero and one;<ref name=Hosmer/> for the logit, this is interpreted as taking input [[log-odds]] and having output [[probability]]. The ''standard'' logistic function <math>\\sigma:\\mathbb R\\rightarrow (0,1)</math> is defined as follows:\n\n:<math>\\sigma (t) = \\frac{e^t}{e^t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}</math>\n\nA graph of the logistic function on the ''t''-interval (−6,6) is shown in Figure 1.\n\nLet us assume that <math>t</math> is a linear function of a single [[dependent and independent variables|explanatory variable]] <math>x</math> (the case where <math>t</math> is a ''linear combination'' of multiple explanatory variables is treated similarly). We can then express <math>t</math> as follows:\n\n:<math>t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x</math>\n\nAnd the general logistic function <math>p:\\mathbb R \\rightarrow (0,1)</math>can now be written as:\n\n:<math>p(x) = \\sigma(t)= \\frac {1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x)}}</math>\n\nIn the logistic model, <math>p(x)</math> is interpreted as the probability of the dependent variable <math>Y</math> equaling a success/case rather than a failure/non-case. It's clear that the [[Dependent and independent variables|response variables]] <math>Y_i</math> are not identically distributed: <math>P(Y_i = 1\\mid X)</math> differs from one data point <math>X_i</math> to another, though they are independent given [[design matrix]] <math>X</math> and shared parameters <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name = \"Freedman09\" />\n\n===Definition of the inverse of the logistic function===\nWe can now define the [[logit]] (log odds) function as the inverse <math>g = \\sigma^{-1}</math> of the standard logistic function. It is easy to see that it satisfies:\n\n:<math>g(p(x)) = \\sigma^{-1} (p(x)) = \\operatorname{logit} p(x) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x ,</math>\n\nand equivalently, after exponentiating both sides we have the odds:\n\n:<math>\\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}.</math>\n\n===Interpretation of these terms===\nIn the above equations, the terms are as follows:\n\n* <math>g</math> is the logit function. The equation for <math>g(p(x))</math> illustrates that the [[logit]] (i.e., log-odds or natural logarithm of the odds) is equivalent to the linear regression expression.\n* <math>\\ln</math> denotes the [[natural logarithm]].\n* <math>p(x)</math> is the probability that the dependent variable equals a case, given some linear combination of the predictors. The formula for <math>p(x)</math> illustrates that the probability of the dependent variable equaling a case is equal to the value of the logistic function of the linear regression expression. This is important in that it shows that the value of the linear regression expression can vary from negative to positive infinity and yet, after transformation, the resulting expression for the probability <math>p(x)</math> ranges between 0 and 1.\n* <math>\\beta_0</math> is the [[Y-intercept|intercept]] from the linear regression equation (the value of the criterion when the predictor is equal to zero).\n* <math>\\beta_1 x</math> is the regression coefficient multiplied by some value of the predictor.\n* base <math>e</math> denotes the exponential function.\n\n===Definition of the odds===\nThe odds of the dependent variable equaling a case (given some linear combination <math>x</math> of the predictors) is equivalent to the exponential function of the linear regression expression. This illustrates how the [[logit]] serves as a link function between the probability and the linear regression expression. Given that the logit ranges between negative and positive infinity, it provides an adequate criterion upon which to conduct linear regression and the logit is easily converted back into the odds.<ref name=Hosmer/>\n\nSo we define odds of the dependent variable equaling a case (given some linear combination <math>x</math> of the predictors) as follows:\n\n:<math>\\text{odds} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}.</math>\n\n===The odds ratio===\nFor a continuous independent variable the odds ratio can be defined as:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\operatorname{odds}(x+1)}{\\operatorname{odds}(x)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{F(x+1)}{1 - F(x+1)}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{F(x)}{1 - F(x)}\\right)}\n                                        = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)}}{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}} = e^{\\beta_1}</math>\n\nThis exponential relationship provides an interpretation for <math>\\beta_1</math>: The odds multiply by <math>e^{\\beta_1}</math> for every 1-unit increase in x.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/faq/how-do-i-interpret-odds-ratios-in-logistic-regression/|title=How to Interpret Odds Ratio in Logistic Regression?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Institute for Digital Research and Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor a binary independent variable the odds ratio is defined as <math>\\frac{ad}{bc}</math> where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are cells in a 2×2 [[contingency table]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0521593465 }}</ref>\n\n===Multiple explanatory variables===\nIf there are multiple explanatory variables, the above expression <math>\\beta_0+\\beta_1x</math> can be revised to <math>\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\cdots+\\beta_mx_m = \\beta_0+ \\sum_{i=1}^m \\beta_ix_i</math>. Then when this is used in the equation relating the log odds of a success to the values of the predictors, the linear regression will be a [[multiple regression]] with ''m'' explanators; the parameters <math>\\beta_j</math> for all ''j'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''m'' are all estimated.\n\nAgain, the more traditional equations are:\n\n:<math>\\log \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\cdots+\\beta_mx_m</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{1}{1+b^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_mx_m )}}</math>\n\nwhere usually <math>b=e</math>.\n\n==Model fitting==\n{{expand section|date=October 2016}}\n\nLogistic regression is an important [[machine learning]] algorithm.

Thus a study designed to use <math>k</math> explanatory variables for an event (e.g. [[myocardial infarction]]) expected to occur in a proportion <math>p</math> of participants in the study will require a total of <math>10k/p</math> participants. However, there is considerable debate about the reliability of this rule, which is based on simulation studies and lacks a secure theoretical underpinning.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=27881078|pmc=5122171|year=2016|last1=Van Smeden|first1=M.|title=No rationale for 1 variable per 10 events criterion for binary logistic regression analysis|journal=BMC Medical Research Methodology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=163|last2=De Groot|first2=J.

A useful criterion is whether the fitted model will be expected to achieve the same predictive discrimination in a new sample as it appeared to achieve in the model development sample.  For that criterion, 20 events per candidate variable may be required.<ref name=plo14mod/>  Also, one can argue that 96 observations are needed only to estimate the model's intercept precisely enough that the margin of error in predicted probabilities is ±0.1 with an 0.95 confidence level.<ref name=rms/>\n\n===Maximum likelihood estimation===\n\nThe regression coefficients are usually estimated using [[maximum likelihood]] estimation.<ref name=Menard/> Unlike linear regression with normally distributed residuals, it is not possible to find a closed-form expression for the coefficient values that maximize the likelihood function, so that an iterative process must be used instead; for example [[Newton's method]]. This process begins with a tentative solution, revises it slightly to see if it can be improved, and repeats this revision until no more improvement is made, at which point the process is said to have converged.<ref name=\"Menard\" />\n\nIn some instances, the model may not reach convergence. Non-convergence of a model indicates that the coefficients are not meaningful because the iterative process was unable to find appropriate solutions. A failure to converge may occur for a number of reasons: having a large ratio of predictors to cases, [[multicollinearity]], [[sparse matrix|sparseness]], or complete [[Separation (statistics)|separation]].\n* Having a large ratio of variables to cases results in an overly conservative Wald statistic (discussed below) and can lead to non-convergence.\n* Multicollinearity refers to unacceptably high correlations between predictors. As multicollinearity increases, coefficients remain unbiased but standard errors increase and the likelihood of model convergence decreases.<ref name=Menard/> To detect multicollinearity amongst the predictors, one can conduct a linear regression analysis with the predictors of interest for the sole purpose of examining the tolerance statistic <ref name=Menard/>  used to assess whether multicollinearity is unacceptably high.\n* Sparseness in the data refers to having a large proportion of empty cells (cells with zero counts). Zero cell counts are particularly problematic with categorical predictors. With continuous predictors, the model can infer values for the zero cell counts, but this is not the case with categorical predictors. The model will not converge with zero cell counts for categorical predictors because the natural logarithm of zero is an undefined value so that the final solution to the model cannot be reached. To remedy this problem, researchers may collapse categories in a theoretically meaningful way or add a constant to all cells.<ref name=Menard/>\n* Another numerical problem that may lead to a lack of convergence is complete separation, which refers to the instance in which the predictors perfectly predict the criterion&nbsp;– all cases are accurately classified. In such instances, one should reexamine the data, as there is likely some kind of error.<ref name=Hosmer/>{{elucidate|date=May 2017|reason= Why is there likely some kind of error?

In logistic regression analysis, [[Deviance (statistics)|deviance]] is used in lieu of a sum of squares calculations.<ref name=Cohen/> Deviance is analogous to the sum of squares calculations in linear regression<ref name=Hosmer/>  and is a measure of the lack of fit to the data in a logistic regression model.<ref name=Cohen/> When a \"saturated\" model is available (a model with a theoretically perfect fit), deviance is calculated by comparing a given model with the saturated model.<ref name=Hosmer/>  This computation gives the [[likelihood-ratio test]]:<ref name=Hosmer/>\n\n:<math> D = -2\\ln \\frac{\\text{likelihood of the fitted model}} {\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}.</math>\n\nIn the above equation, {{mvar|D}} represents the deviance and ln represents the natural logarithm. The log of this likelihood ratio (the ratio of the fitted model to the saturated model) will produce a negative value, hence the need for a negative sign. {{mvar|D}} can be shown to follow an approximate [[chi-squared distribution]].<ref name=Hosmer/>  Smaller values indicate better fit as the fitted model deviates less from the saturated model. When assessed upon a chi-square distribution, nonsignificant chi-square values indicate very little unexplained variance and thus, good model fit. Conversely, a significant chi-square value indicates that a significant amount of the variance is unexplained.\n\nWhen the saturated model is not available (a common case), deviance is calculated simply as −2·(log likelihood of the fitted model), and the reference to the saturated model's log likelihood can be removed from all that follows without harm.\n\nTwo measures of deviance are particularly important in logistic regression: null deviance and model deviance. The null deviance represents the difference between a model with only the intercept (which means \"no predictors\") and the saturated model. The model deviance represents the difference between a model with at least one predictor and the saturated model.<ref name=Cohen/> In this respect, the null model provides a baseline upon which to compare predictor models. Given that deviance is a measure of the difference between a given model and the saturated model, smaller values indicate better fit. Thus, to assess the contribution of a predictor or set of predictors, one can subtract the model deviance from the null deviance and assess the difference on a <math>\\chi^2_{s-p},</math>  chi-square distribution with [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]<ref name=Hosmer/> equal to the difference in the number of parameters estimated.\n\nLet\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    D_{\\text{null}} &=-2\\ln \\frac{\\text{likelihood of null model}} {\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}\\\\[6pt]\n   D_{\\text{fitted}} &=-2\\ln \\frac{\\text{likelihood of fitted model}} {\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThen the difference of both is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \nD_\\text{null}- D_\\text{fitted} &= -2 \\left(\\ln \\frac{\\text{likelihood of null model}} {\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}-\\ln \\frac{\\text{likelihood of fitted model}} {\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}\\right)\\\\[6pt]\n&= -2 \\ln \\frac{ \\left( \\dfrac{\\text{likelihood of null model}}{\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{\\text{likelihood of fitted model}}{\\text{likelihood of the saturated model}}\\right)}\\\\[6pt]\n&= -2 \\ln \\frac{\\text{likelihood of the null model}}{\\text{likelihood of fitted model}}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf the model deviance is significantly smaller than the null deviance then one can conclude that the predictor or set of predictors significantly improved model fit. This is analogous to the {{mvar|F}}-test used in linear regression analysis to assess the significance of prediction.<ref name=Cohen/>\n\n====Pseudo-''R''<sup>2</sup>s====\nIn linear regression the squared multiple correlation, ''R''<sup>2</sup> is used to assess goodness of fit as it represents the proportion of variance in the criterion that is explained by the predictors.<ref name=Cohen/> In logistic regression analysis, there is no agreed upon analogous measure, but there are several competing measures each with limitations.<ref name=Cohen/><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings14/1485-2014.pdf|title=Measures of Fit for Logistic Regression|last=Allison|first=Paul D.|date=|website=|publisher=Statistical Horizons LLC and the University of Pennsylvania|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFour of the most commonly used indices and one less commonly used one are examined on this page:\n* Likelihood ratio ''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>L</sub>\n* Cox and Snell ''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>CS</sub>\n* Nagelkerke ''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>N</sub>\n* McFadden ''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>McF</sub>\n* Tjur ''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>T</sub>\n\n''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>L</sub> is given by <ref name=Cohen/>\n\n:<math>R^2_\\text{L} = \\frac{D_\\text{null} - D_\\text{fitted}} {D_\\text{null}} .</math>\n\nThis is the most analogous index to the squared multiple correlations in linear regression.<ref name=Menard/> It represents the proportional reduction in the deviance wherein the deviance is treated as a measure of variation analogous but not identical to the [[variance]] in [[linear regression]] analysis.<ref name=Menard/> One limitation of the likelihood ratio ''R''<sup>2</sup> is that it is not monotonically related to the odds ratio,<ref name=Cohen/> meaning that it does not necessarily increase as the odds ratio increases and does not necessarily decrease as the odds ratio decreases.\n\n''R''<sup>2</sup><sub>CS</sub> is an alternative index of goodness of fit related to the ''R''<sup>2</sup> value from linear regression.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nR^2_\\text{CS} & = 1 - \\left(\\frac{L_0}{L_M}\\right)^{2/n} \\\\[5pt]\n& = 1 - e^{2(\\ln(L_0) - \\ln(L_M))/n}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''L''<sub>''M''</sub> and ''L''<sub>0</sub> are the likelihoods for the model being fitted and the null model, respectively.

Logistic regression will always be [[heteroscedastic]] – the error variances differ for each value of the predicted score. For each value of the predicted score there would be a different value of the proportionate reduction in error. Therefore, it is inappropriate to think of ''R''<sup>2</sup> as a proportionate reduction in error in a universal sense in logistic regression.<ref name=Cohen/>\n\n====Hosmer–Lemeshow test====\nThe [[Hosmer–Lemeshow test]] uses a test statistic that asymptotically follows a [[chi-squared distribution|<math>\\chi^2</math> distribution]] to assess whether or not the observed event rates match expected event rates in subgroups of the model population.  This test is considered to be obsolete by some statisticians because of its dependence on arbitrary binning of predicted probabilities and relative low power.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hosmer|first1=D.W.|title=A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model|journal=Stat Med|date=1997|volume=16|issue=9|pages=965–980|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19970515)16:9<965::aid-sim509>3.3.co;2-f}}</ref>\n\n==Coefficients==\nAfter fitting the model, it is likely that researchers will want to examine the contribution of individual predictors. To do so, they will want to examine the regression coefficients. In linear regression, the regression coefficients represent the change in the criterion for each unit change in the predictor.<ref name=Cohen/> In logistic regression, however, the regression coefficients represent the change in the logit for each unit change in the predictor. Given that the logit is not intuitive, researchers are likely to focus on a predictor's effect on the exponential function of the regression coefficient – the odds ratio (see [[logistic regression#Definition|definition]]). In linear regression, the significance of a regression coefficient is assessed by computing a ''t'' test. In logistic regression, there are several different tests designed to assess the significance of an individual predictor, most notably the likelihood ratio test and the Wald statistic.\n\n===Likelihood ratio test===\nThe [[likelihood-ratio test]] discussed above to assess model fit is also the recommended procedure to assess the contribution of individual \"predictors\" to a given model.<ref name=Hosmer/><ref name=Menard/><ref name=Cohen/> In the case of a single predictor model, one simply compares the deviance of the predictor model with that of the null model on a chi-square distribution with a single degree of freedom. If the predictor model has significantly smaller deviance (c.f chi-square using the difference in degrees of freedom of the two models), then one can conclude that there is a significant association between the \"predictor\" and the outcome. Although some common statistical packages (e.g. SPSS) do provide likelihood ratio test statistics, without this computationally intensive test it would be more difficult to assess the contribution of individual predictors in the multiple logistic regression case. To assess the contribution of individual predictors one can enter the predictors hierarchically, comparing each new model with the previous to determine the contribution of each predictor.<ref name=Cohen/> There is some debate among statisticians about the appropriateness of so-called \"stepwise\" procedures. The fear is that they may not preserve nominal statistical properties and may become misleading.[https://www.amazon.com/Regression-Modeling-Strategies-Applications-Statistics/dp/1441929185/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1339171287&sr=8-2]\n\n===Wald statistic===\nAlternatively, when assessing the contribution of individual predictors in a given model, one may examine the significance of the [[Wald test|Wald statistic]]. The Wald statistic, analogous to the ''t''-test in linear regression, is used to assess the significance of coefficients. The Wald statistic is the ratio of the square of the regression coefficient to the square of the standard error of the coefficient and is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square distribution.<ref name=Menard/>\n\n: <math>W_j = \\frac{\\beta^2_j} {SE^2_{\\beta_j}}</math>\n\nAlthough several statistical packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS) report the Wald statistic to assess the contribution of individual predictors, the Wald statistic has limitations. When the regression coefficient is large, the standard error of the regression coefficient also tends to be larger increasing the probability of [[Type I and Type II errors|Type-II error]]. The Wald statistic also tends to be biased when data are sparse.<ref name=Cohen/>\n\n===Case-control sampling===\nSuppose cases are rare. Then we might wish to sample them more frequently than their prevalence in the population. For example, suppose there is a disease that affects 1 person in 10,000 and to collect our data we need to do a complete physical. It may be too expensive to do thousands of physicals of healthy people in order to obtain data for only a few diseased individuals. Thus, we may evaluate more diseased individuals, perhaps all of the rare outcomes. This is also retrospective sampling, or equivalently it is called unbalanced data. As a rule of thumb, sampling controls at a rate of five times the number of cases will produce sufficient control data.<ref name=\"islr\">https://class.stanford.edu/c4x/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/asset/classification.pdf slide 16</ref>\n\nLogistic regression is unique in that it may be estimated on unbalanced data, rather than randomly sampled data, and still yield correct coefficient estimates of the effects of each independent variable on the outcome.  That is to say, if we form a logistic model from such data, if the model is correct in the general population, the <math>\\beta_j</math> parameters are all correct except for <math>\\beta_0</math>. We can correct <math>\\beta_0</math> if we know the true prevalence as follows:<ref name=\"islr\"/>\n\n: <math>\\widehat{\\beta}_0^* = \\widehat{\\beta}_0+\\log \\frac \\pi {1 - \\pi} - \\log{ \\tilde{\\pi} \\over {1 - \\tilde{\\pi}} } </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\pi</math> is the true prevalence and <math>\\tilde{\\pi}</math> is the prevalence in the sample.\n\n==Formal mathematical specification==\nThere are various equivalent specifications of logistic regression, which fit into different types of more general models.  These different specifications allow for different sorts of useful generalizations.\n\n===Setup===\nThe basic setup of logistic regression is as follows. We are given a dataset containing ''N'' points. Each point ''i'' consists of a set of ''m'' input variables ''x''<sub>1,''i''</sub> ... ''x''<sub>''m,i''</sub> (also called [[independent variable]]s, predictor variables, features, or attributes), and a [[binary variable|binary]] outcome variable ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> (also known as a [[dependent variable]], response variable, output variable, or class), i.e. it can assume only the two possible values 0 (often meaning \"no\" or \"failure\") or 1 (often meaning \"yes\" or \"success\"). The goal of logistic regression is to use the dataset to create a predictive model of the outcome variable.\n\nSome examples:\n* The observed outcomes are the presence or absence of a given disease (e.g. diabetes) in a set of patients, and the explanatory variables might be characteristics of the patients thought to be pertinent (sex, race, age, [[blood pressure]], [[body-mass index]], etc.).\n* The observed outcomes are the votes (e.g. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) of a set of people in an election, and the explanatory variables are the demographic characteristics of each person (e.g. sex, race, age, income, etc.).  In such a case, one of the two outcomes is arbitrarily coded as 1, and the other as 0.\n\nAs in linear regression, the outcome variables ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> are assumed to depend on the explanatory variables ''x''<sub>1,''i''</sub> ... ''x''<sub>''m,i''</sub>.\n\n; Explanatory variables\nAs shown above in the above examples, the explanatory variables may be of any [[statistical data type|type]]: [[real-valued]], [[binary variable|binary]], [[categorical variable|categorical]], etc.  The main distinction is between [[continuous variable]]s (such as income, age and [[blood pressure]]) and [[discrete variable]]s (such as sex or race).  Discrete variables referring to more than two possible choices are typically coded using [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables]] (or [[indicator variable]]s), that is, separate explanatory variables taking the value 0 or 1 are created for each possible value of the discrete variable, with a 1 meaning \"variable does have the given value\" and a 0 meaning \"variable does not have that value\".  For example, a four-way discrete variable of [[blood type]] with the possible values \"A, B, AB, O\" can be converted to four separate two-way dummy variables, \"is-A, is-B, is-AB, is-O\", where only one of them has the value 1 and all the rest have the value 0.  This allows for separate regression coefficients to be matched for each possible value of the discrete variable. (In a case like this, only three of the four dummy variables are independent of each other, in the sense that once the values of three of the variables are known, the fourth is automatically determined.  Thus, it is necessary to encode only three of the four possibilities as dummy variables.  This also means that when all four possibilities are encoded, the overall model is not [[identifiable]] in the absence of additional constraints such as a regularization constraint.  Theoretically, this could cause problems, but in reality almost all logistic regression models are fitted with regularization constraints.)\n\n; Outcome variables\nFormally, the outcomes ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> are described as being [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli-distributed]] data, where each outcome is determined by an unobserved probability ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> that is specific to the outcome at hand, but related to the explanatory variables.  This can be expressed in any of the following equivalent forms:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nY_i\\mid x_{1,i},\\ldots,x_{m,i} \\ & \\sim  \\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p_i) \\\\\n\\operatorname{E}[Y_i\\mid x_{1,i},\\ldots,x_{m,i}] &= p_i  \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=y\\mid x_{1,i},\\ldots,x_{m,i}) &=\n\\begin{cases}\np_i & \\text{if }y=1 \\\\\n1-p_i & \\text{if }y=0\n\\end{cases}\n\\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=y\\mid x_{1,i},\\ldots,x_{m,i}) &= p_i^y (1-p_i)^{(1-y)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe meanings of these four lines are:\n# The first line expresses the [[probability distribution]] of each ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>: Conditioned on the explanatory variables, it follows a [[Bernoulli distribution]] with parameters ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>, the probability of the outcome of 1 for trial ''i''. As noted above, each separate trial has its own probability of success, just as each trial has its own explanatory variables.  The probability of success ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> is not observed, only the outcome of an individual Bernoulli trial using that probability.\n# The second line expresses the fact that the [[expected value]] of each ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> is equal to the probability of success ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>, which is a general property of the Bernoulli distribution.  In other words, if we run a large number of Bernoulli trials using the same probability of success ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>, then take the average of all the 1 and 0 outcomes, then the result would be close to ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>.  This is because doing an average this way simply computes the proportion of successes seen, which we expect to converge to the underlying probability of success.\n# The third line writes out the [[probability mass function]] of the Bernoulli distribution, specifying the probability of seeing each of the two possible outcomes.\n# The fourth line is another way of writing the probability mass function, which avoids having to write separate cases and is more convenient for certain types of calculations.  This relies on the fact that ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> can take only the value 0 or 1.  In each case, one of the exponents will be 1, \"choosing\" the value under it, while the other is 0, \"canceling out\" the value under it.  Hence, the outcome is either ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> or 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''p''<sub>''i''</sub>, as in the previous line.\n\n; Linear predictor function\nThe basic idea of logistic regression is to use the mechanism already developed for [[linear regression]] by modeling the probability ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> using a [[linear predictor function]], i.e. a [[linear combination]] of the explanatory variables and a set of [[regression coefficient]]s that are specific to the model at hand but the same for all trials.  The linear predictor function <math>f(i)</math> for a particular data point ''i'' is written as:\n\n:<math>f(i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_m x_{m,i},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\beta_0, \\ldots, \\beta_m</math> are [[regression coefficient]]s indicating the relative effect of a particular explanatory variable on the outcome.\n\nThe model is usually put into a more compact form as follows:\n* The regression coefficients ''β''<sub>0</sub>, ''β''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''β''<sub>''m''</sub> are grouped into a single vector '''''β''''' of size ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n* For each data point ''i'', an additional explanatory pseudo-variable ''x''<sub>0,''i''</sub> is added, with a fixed value of 1, corresponding to the [[Y-intercept|intercept]] coefficient ''β''<sub>0</sub>.\n* The resulting explanatory variables ''x''<sub>0,''i''</sub>, ''x''<sub>1,''i''</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''m,i''</sub> are then grouped into a single vector '''''X<sub>i</sub>''''' of size ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nThis makes it possible to write the linear predictor function as follows:\n\n:<math>f(i)= \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i,</math>\n\nusing the notation for a [[dot product]] between two vectors.\n\n===As a generalized linear model===\nThe particular model used by logistic regression, which distinguishes it from standard [[linear regression]] and from other types of [[regression analysis]] used for [[binary-valued]] outcomes, is the way the probability of a particular outcome is linked to the linear predictor function:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{logit}(\\operatorname E[Y_i\\mid x_{1,i},\\ldots,x_{m,i}]) = \\operatorname{logit}(p_i) = \\ln \\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_m x_{m,i}</math>\n\nWritten using the more compact notation described above, this is:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{logit}(\\operatorname E[Y_i\\mid \\mathbf{X}_i]) = \\operatorname{logit}(p_i)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i</math>\n\nThis formulation expresses logistic regression as a type of [[generalized linear model]], which predicts variables with various types of [[probability distribution]]s by fitting a linear predictor function of the above form to some sort of arbitrary transformation of the expected value of the variable.\n\nThe intuition for transforming using the logit function (the natural log of the odds) was explained above.  It also has the practical effect of converting the probability (which is bounded to be between 0 and 1) to a variable that ranges over <math>(-\\infty,+\\infty)</math> — thereby matching the potential range of the linear prediction function on the right side of the equation.\n\nNote that both the probabilities ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> and the regression coefficients are unobserved, and the means of determining them is not part of the model itself.  They are typically determined by some sort of optimization procedure, e.g. [[maximum likelihood estimation]], that finds values that best fit the observed data (i.e. that give the most accurate predictions for the data already observed), usually subject to [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] conditions that seek to exclude unlikely values, e.g. extremely large values for any of the regression coefficients.  The use of a regularization condition is equivalent to doing [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, an extension of maximum likelihood.  (Regularization is most commonly done using [[Ridge regression|a squared regularizing function]], which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] [[prior distribution]] on the coefficients, but other regularizers are also possible.)  Whether or not regularization is used, it is usually not possible to find a closed-form solution; instead, an iterative numerical method must be used, such as [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] (IRLS) or, more commonly these days, a [[quasi-Newton method]] such as the [[L-BFGS|L-BFGS method]].<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1118871 |title=A comparison of algorithms for maximum entropy parameter estimation |last1=Malouf |first1=Robert |date= 2002|book-title= Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2002) |pages= 49–55 |doi=10.3115/1118853.1118871 }}</ref>\n\nThe interpretation of the ''β''<sub>''j''</sub> parameter estimates is as the additive effect on the log of the [[odds]] for a unit change in the ''j'' the explanatory variable.  In the case of a dichotomous explanatory variable, for instance, gender <math>e^\\beta</math> is the estimate of the odds of having the outcome for, say, males compared with females.\n\nAn equivalent formula uses the inverse of the logit function, which is the [[logistic function]], i.e.:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname E[Y_i\\mid \\mathbf{X}_i] = p_i = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nThe formula can also be written as a [[probability distribution]] (specifically, using a [[probability mass function]]):\n\n: <math>\\Pr(Y_i=y\\mid \\mathbf{X}_i) = {p_i}^y(1-p_i)^{1-y} =\\left(\\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1+e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\\right)^{y} \\left(1-\\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1+e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\\right)^{1-y} = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\cdot y}  }{1+e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\n===As a latent-variable model===\nThe above model has an equivalent formulation as a [[latent-variable model]].  This formulation is common in the theory of [[discrete choice]] models and makes it easier to extend to certain more complicated models with multiple, correlated choices, as well as to compare logistic regression to the closely related [[probit model]].\n\nImagine that, for each trial ''i'', there is a continuous [[latent variable]] ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>*</sup> (i.e. an unobserved [[random variable]]) that is distributed as follows:\n\n: <math> Y_i^\\ast = \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon \\, </math>\nwhere\n: <math>\\varepsilon \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,1) \\, </math>\ni.e. the latent variable can be written directly in terms of the linear predictor function and an additive random [[error variable]] that is distributed according to a standard [[logistic distribution]].\n\nThen ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> can be viewed as an indicator for whether this latent variable is positive:\n: <math> Y_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if }Y_i^\\ast > 0 \\ \\text{ i.e. } - \\varepsilon < \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i, \\\\\n0 &\\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} </math>\n\nThe choice of modeling the error variable specifically with a standard logistic distribution, rather than a general logistic distribution with the location and scale set to arbitrary values, seems restrictive, but in fact, it is not.  It must be kept in mind that we can choose the regression coefficients ourselves, and very often can use them to offset changes in the parameters of the error variable's distribution.  For example, a logistic error-variable distribution with a non-zero location parameter ''μ'' (which sets the mean) is equivalent to a distribution with a zero location parameter, where ''μ'' has been added to the intercept coefficient.  Both situations produce the same value for ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>*</sup> regardless of settings of explanatory variables.  Similarly, an arbitrary scale parameter ''s'' is equivalent to setting the scale parameter to 1 and then dividing all regression coefficients by ''s''.  In the latter case, the resulting value of ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''*''</sup> will be smaller by a factor of ''s'' than in the former case, for all sets of explanatory variables — but critically, it will always remain on the same side of 0, and hence lead to the same ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> choice.\n\n(Note that this predicts that the irrelevancy of the scale parameter may not carry over into more complex models where more than two choices are available.)\n\nIt turns out that this formulation is exactly equivalent to the preceding one, phrased in terms of the [[generalized linear model]] and without any [[latent variable]]s.  This can be shown as follows, using the fact that the [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) of the standard [[logistic distribution]] is the [[logistic function]], which is the inverse of the [[logit function]], i.e.\n\n:<math>\\Pr(\\varepsilon < x) = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(x)</math>\n\nThen:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1\\mid\\mathbf{X}_i) &= \\Pr(Y_i^\\ast > 0\\mid\\mathbf{X}_i) \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\Pr(\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon > 0) \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\Pr(\\varepsilon > -\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\Pr(\\varepsilon < \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) & & \\text{(because the logistic distribution is symmetric)} \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) & \\\\[5pt]\n&= p_i & & \\text{(see above)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis formulation—which is standard in [[discrete choice]] models—makes clear the relationship between logistic regression (the \"logit model\") and the [[probit model]], which uses an error variable distributed according to a standard [[normal distribution]] instead of a standard logistic distribution.  Both the logistic and normal distributions are symmetric with a basic unimodal, \"bell curve\" shape.  The only difference is that the logistic distribution has somewhat [[heavy-tailed distribution|heavier tails]], which means that it is less sensitive to outlying data (and hence somewhat more [[robust statistics|robust]] to model mis-specifications or erroneous data).\n\n===Two-way latent-variable model===\nYet another formulation uses two separate latent variables:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nY_i^{0\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_0 \\, \\\\\nY_i^{1\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 \\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\varepsilon_0 & \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(0,1) \\\\\n\\varepsilon_1 & \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(0,1)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''EV''<sub>1</sub>(0,1) is a standard type-1 [[extreme value distribution]]: i.e.\n\n:<math>\\Pr(\\varepsilon_0=x) = \\Pr(\\varepsilon_1=x) = e^{-x} e^{-e^{-x}}</math>\n\nThen\n\n: <math> Y_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if }Y_i^{1\\ast} > Y_i^{0\\ast}, \\\\\n0 &\\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} </math>\n\nThis model has a separate latent variable and a separate set of regression coefficients for each possible outcome of the dependent variable.  The reason for this separation is that it makes it easy to extend logistic regression to multi-outcome categorical variables, as in the [[multinomial logit]] model. In such a model, it is natural to model each possible outcome using a different set of regression coefficients.  It is also possible to motivate each of the separate latent variables as the theoretical [[utility]] associated with making the associated choice, and thus motivate logistic regression in terms of [[utility theory]]. (In terms of utility theory, a rational actor always chooses the choice with the greatest associated utility.) This is the approach taken by economists when formulating [[discrete choice]] models, because it both provides a theoretically strong foundation and facilitates intuitions about the model, which in turn makes it easy to consider various sorts of extensions. (See the example below.)\n\nThe choice of the type-1 [[extreme value distribution]] seems fairly arbitrary, but it makes the mathematics work out, and it may be possible to justify its use through [[rational choice theory]].\n\nIt turns out that this model is equivalent to the previous model, although this seems non-obvious, since there are now two sets of regression coefficients and error variables, and the error variables have a different distribution.  In fact, this model reduces directly to the previous one with the following substitutions:\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\beta = \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_0</math>\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_1 - \\varepsilon_0</math>\nAn intuition for this comes from the fact that, since we choose based on the maximum of two values, only their difference matters, not the exact values — and this effectively removes one [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]]. Another critical fact is that the difference of two type-1 extreme-value-distributed variables is a logistic distribution, i.e. <math>\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_1 - \\varepsilon_0 \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,1) .</math> We can demonstrate the equivalent as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1\\mid\\mathbf{X}_i) = {} & \\Pr \\left (Y_i^{1\\ast} > Y_i^{0\\ast}\\mid\\mathbf{X}_i \\right ) & \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr \\left (Y_i^{1\\ast} - Y_i^{0\\ast} > 0\\mid\\mathbf{X}_i \\right ) & \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr \\left (\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 - \\left (\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_0 \\right ) > 0 \\right ) & \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr \\left ((\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) + (\\varepsilon_1 - \\varepsilon_0) > 0 \\right ) & \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr((\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_0) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + (\\varepsilon_1 - \\varepsilon_0) > 0) & \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr((\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_0) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon > 0) & & \\text{(substitute } \\varepsilon\\text{ as above)} \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr(\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon > 0) & & \\text{(substitute }\\boldsymbol\\beta\\text{ as above)} \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr(\\varepsilon > -\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) & & \\text{(now, same as above model)}\\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\Pr(\\varepsilon < \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) & \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i) \\\\[5pt]\n= {} & p_i\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n====Example====\nAs an example, consider a province-level election where the choice is between a right-of-center party, a left-of-center party, and a secessionist party (e.g. the [[Parti Québécois]], which wants [[Quebec]] to secede from [[Canada]]).  We would then use three latent variables, one for each choice.  Then, in accordance with [[utility theory]], we can then interpret the latent variables as expressing the [[utility]] that results from making each of the choices.  We can also interpret the regression coefficients as indicating the strength that the associated factor (i.e. explanatory variable) has in contributing to the utility — or more correctly, the amount by which a unit change in an explanatory variable changes the utility of a given choice.  A voter might expect that the right-of-center party would lower taxes, especially on rich people.  This would give low-income people no benefit, i.e. no change in utility (since they usually don't pay taxes); would cause moderate benefit (i.e. somewhat more money, or moderate utility increase) for middle-incoming people; would cause significant benefits for high-income people.  On the other hand, the left-of-center party might be expected to raise taxes and offset it with increased welfare and other assistance for the lower and middle classes.  This would cause significant positive benefit to low-income people, perhaps a weak benefit to middle-income people, and significant negative benefit to high-income people.  Finally, the secessionist party would take no direct actions on the economy, but simply secede. A low-income or middle-income voter might expect basically no clear utility gain or loss from this, but a high-income voter might expect negative utility since he/she is likely to own companies, which will have a harder time doing business in such an environment and probably lose money.\n\nThese intuitions can be expressed as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Estimated strength of regression coefficient for different outcomes (party choices) and different values of explanatory variables\n|-\n! !! Center-right !! Center-left !! Secessionist\n|-\n! High-income\n| strong + || strong − || strong −\n|-\n! Middle-income\n| moderate + || weak + || none\n|-\n! Low-income\n| none || strong + || none\n|-\n|}\n\nThis clearly shows that\n# Separate sets of regression coefficients need to exist for each choice.  When phrased in terms of utility, this can be seen very easily. Different choices have different effects on net utility; furthermore, the effects vary in complex ways that depend on the characteristics of each individual, so there need to be separate sets of coefficients for each characteristic, not simply a single extra per-choice characteristic.\n# Even though income is a continuous variable, its effect on utility is too complex for it to be treated as a single variable.  Either it needs to be directly split up into ranges, or higher powers of income need to be added so that [[polynomial regression]] on income is effectively done.\n\n==={{anchor|log-linear model}}As a \"log-linear\" model===\nYet another formulation combines the two-way latent variable formulation above with the original formulation higher up without latent variables, and in the process provides a link to one of the standard formulations of the [[multinomial logit]].\n\nHere, instead of writing the [[logit]] of the probabilities ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> as a linear predictor, we separate the linear predictor into two, one for each of the two outcomes:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=0) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNote that two separate sets of regression coefficients have been introduced, just as in the two-way latent variable model, and the two equations appear a form that writes the [[logarithm]] of the associated probability as a linear predictor, with an extra term <math>- ln Z</math> at the end.  This term, as it turns out, serves as the [[normalizing factor]] ensuring that the result is a distribution.  This can be seen by exponentiating both sides:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=0) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn this form it is clear that the purpose of ''Z'' is to ensure that the resulting distribution over ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> is in fact a [[probability distribution]], i.e. it sums to 1.  This means that ''Z'' is simply the sum of all un-normalized probabilities, and by dividing each probability by ''Z'', the probabilities become \"[[normalizing constant|normalized]]\".  That is:\n\n:<math> Z = e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}</math>\n\nand the resulting equations are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=0) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr generally:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_h e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_h \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nThis shows clearly how to generalize this formulation to more than two outcomes, as in [[multinomial logit]].\nNote that this general formulation is exactly the [[Softmax function]] as in\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\operatorname{softmax}(c, \\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i, \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i, \\dots) .</math>\n\nIn order to prove that this is equivalent to the previous model, note that the above model is overspecified, in that <math>\\Pr(Y_i=0)</math> and <math>\\Pr(Y_i=1)</math> cannot be independently specified: rather <math>\\Pr(Y_i=0) + \\Pr(Y_i=1) = 1</math> so knowing one automatically determines the other.  As a result, the model is [[nonidentifiable]], in that multiple combinations of '''''β'''''<sub>0</sub> and '''''β'''''<sub>1</sub> will produce the same probabilities for all possible explanatory variables.  In fact, it can be seen that adding any constant vector to both of them will produce the same probabilities:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 +\\mathbf{C}) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_0  +\\mathbf{C})\\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 +\\mathbf{C}) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\mathbf{C} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\mathbf{C} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\mathbf{C} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\frac{e^{\\mathbf{C} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{\\mathbf{C} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}(e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i})} \\\\[5pt]\n&= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs a result, we can simplify matters, and restore identifiability, by picking an arbitrary value for one of the two vectors.  We choose to set <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 = \\mathbf{0} .</math>  Then,\n\n:<math>e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} = e^{\\mathbf{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} = 1</math>\n\nand so\n\n:<math>\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} = p_i</math>\n\nwhich shows that this formulation is indeed equivalent to the previous formulation. (As in the two-way latent variable formulation, any settings where <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta = \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_0</math> will produce equivalent results.)\n\nNote that most treatments of the [[multinomial logit]] model start out either by extending the \"log-linear\" formulation presented here or the two-way latent variable formulation presented above, since both clearly show the way that the model could be extended to multi-way outcomes.  In general, the presentation with latent variables is more common in [[econometrics]] and [[political science]], where [[discrete choice]] models and [[utility theory]] reign, while the \"log-linear\" formulation here is more common in [[computer science]], e.g. [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]].\n\n===As a single-layer perceptron===\nThe model has an equivalent formulation\n\n:<math>p_i = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i})}}. \\, </math>\n\nThis functional form is commonly called a single-layer [[perceptron]] or single-layer [[artificial neural network]]. A single-layer neural network computes a continuous output instead of a [[step function]]. The derivative of ''p<sub>i</sub>'' with respect to  ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>) is computed from the general form:\n\n: <math>y = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-f(X)}}</math>\n\nwhere ''f''(''X'') is an [[analytic function]] in ''X''. With this choice, the single-layer neural network is identical to the logistic regression model. This function has a continuous derivative, which allows it to be used in [[backpropagation]]. This function is also preferred because its derivative is easily calculated:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}X} = y(1-y)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}X}. \\, </math>\n\n===In terms of binomial data===\nA closely related model assumes that each ''i'' is associated not with a single Bernoulli trial but with ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> [[independent identically distributed]] trials, where the observation ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> is the number of successes observed (the sum of the individual Bernoulli-distributed random variables), and hence follows a [[binomial distribution]]:\n\n:<math>Y_i \\ \\sim  \\operatorname{Bin}(n_i,p_i),\\text{ for }i = 1, \\dots , n</math>\n\nAn example of this distribution is the fraction of seeds (''p''<sub>''i''</sub>) that germinate after ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> are planted.\n\nIn terms of [[expected value]]s, this model is expressed as follows:\n\n:<math>p_i = \\operatorname E\\left[\\left.\\frac{Y_i}{n_{i}}\\,\\right|\\,\\mathbf{X}_i \\right], </math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{logit}\\left(\\operatorname E\\left[\\left.\\frac{Y_i}{n_i}\\,\\right|\\,\\mathbf{X}_i \\right]\\right) = \\operatorname{logit}(p_i) = \\ln \\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i,</math>\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=y\\mid \\mathbf{X}_i) = {n_i \\choose y} p_i^y(1-p_i)^{n_i-y} ={n_i \\choose y} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\\right)^y \\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\boldsymbol\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\\right)^{n_i-y}.</math>\n\nThis model can be fit using the same sorts of methods as the above more basic model.\n\n==Bayesian==\n[[File:Logistic-sigmoid-vs-scaled-probit.svg|right|300px|thumb|Comparison of [[logistic function]] with a scaled inverse [[probit function]] (i.e. the [[cumulative distribution function|CDF]] of the [[normal distribution]]), comparing <math>\\sigma(x)</math> vs. <math>\\Phi(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}x)</math>, which makes the slopes the same at the origin.  This shows the [[heavy-tailed distribution|heavier tails]] of the logistic distribution.]]\n\nIn a [[Bayesian statistics]] context, [[prior distribution]]s are normally placed on the regression coefficients, usually in the form of [[Gaussian distribution]]s.  There is no [[conjugate prior]] of the [[likelihood function]] in logistic regression.  When Bayesian inference was performed analytically, this made the [[posterior distribution]] difficult to calculate except in very low dimensions.  Now, though, automatic software such as [[OpenBUGS]], [[Just another Gibbs sampler|JAGS]], [[PyMC3]] or [[Stan (software)|Stan]] allows these posteriors to be computed using simulation, so lack of conjugacy is not a concern.  However, when the sample size or the number of parameters is large, full Bayesian simulation can be slow, and people often use approximate methods such as [[variational Bayesian methods]] and [[expectation propagation]].\n\n==History==\nA detailed history of the logistic regression is given in {{harvtxt|Cramer|2002}}. The logistic function was developed as a model of [[population growth]] and named \"logistic\" by [[Pierre François Verhulst]] in the 1830s and 1840s, under the guidance of [[Adolphe Quetelet]]; see {{slink|Logistic function|History}} for details.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|pp=3–5}} In his earliest paper (1838), Verhulst did not specify how he fit the curves to the data.<ref>{{cite journal|first= Pierre-François |last=Verhulst |year= 1838| title = Notice sur la loi que la population poursuit dans son accroissement | journal = Correspondance Mathématique et Physique |volume = 10| pages = 113–121\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=8GsEAAAAYAAJ | format = PDF| accessdate = 3 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cramer|2002|p=4|ps=, \"He did not say how he fitted the curves.\"}}</ref> In his more detailed paper (1845), Verhulst determined the three parameters of the model by making the curve pass through three observed points, which yielded poor predictions.<ref>{{cite journal|first= Pierre-François |last=Verhulst |year= 1845| title = Recherches mathématiques sur la loi d'accroissement de la population | journal = Nouveaux Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Bruxelles |volume = 18 | url = http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN129323640_0018&DMDID=dmdlog7| accessdate = 2013-02-18|trans-title= Mathematical Researches into the Law of Population Growth Increase}}</ref>{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=4}}\n\nThe logistic function was independently developed in chemistry as a model of [[autocatalysis]] ([[Wilhelm Ostwald]], 1883).{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=7}} An autocatalytic reaction is one in which one of the products is itself a [[catalyst]] for the same reaction, while the supply of one of the reactants is fixed. This naturally gives rise to the logistic equation for the same reason as population growth: the reaction is self-reinforcing but constrained.\n\nThe logistic function was independently rediscovered as a model of population growth in 1920 by [[Raymond Pearl]] and [[Lowell Reed]], published as {{harvtxt|Pearl|Reed|1920}}, which led to its use in modern statistics. They were initially unaware of Verhulst's work and presumably learned about it from [[L. Gustave du Pasquier]], but they gave him little credit and did not adopt his terminology.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=6}} Verhulst's priority was acknowledged and the term \"logistic\" revived by [[Udny Yule]] in 1925 and has been followed since.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=6–7}} Pearl and Reed first applied the model to the population of the United States, and also initially fitted the curve by making it pass through three points; as with Verhulst, this again yielded poor results.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=5}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[probit model]] was developed and systematized by [[Chester Ittner Bliss]], who coined the term \"probit\" in {{harvtxt|Bliss|1934}}, and by [[John Gaddum]] in {{harvtxt|Gaddum|1933}}, and the model fit by [[maximum likelihood estimation]] by [[Ronald A. Fisher]] in {{harvtxt|Fisher|1935}}, as an addendum to Bliss's work. The probit model was principally used in [[bioassay]], and had been preceded by earlier work dating to 1860; see {{slink|Probit model|History}}. The probit model influenced the subsequent development of the logit model and these models competed with each other.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=7–9}}\n\nThe logistic model was likely first used as an alternative to the probit model in bioassay by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] and his student [[Jane Worcester]] in {{harvtxt|Wilson|Worcester|1943}}.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=9}} However, the development of the logistic model as a general alternative to the probit model was principally due to the work of [[Joseph Berkson]] over many decades, beginning in {{harvtxt|Berkson|1944}}, where he coined \"logit\", by analogy with \"probit\", and continuing through {{harvtxt|Berkson|1951}} and following years.<ref>{{harvnb|Cramer|2002|p=8|ps=, \"As far as I can see the introduction of the logistics as an alternative to the normal probability function is the work of a single person, Joseph Berkson (1899–1982), ...\"}}</ref> The logit model was initially dismissed as inferior to the probit model, but \"gradually achieved an equal footing with the logit\",{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=11}} particularly between 1960 and 1970. By 1970, the logit model achieved parity with the probit model in use in statistics journals and thereafter surpassed it. This relative popularity was due to the adoption of the logit outside of bioassay, rather than displacing the probit within bioassay, and its informal use in practice; the logit's popularity is credited to the logit model's computational simplicity, mathematical properties, and generality, allowing its use in varied fields.{{sfn|Cramer|2002|p=10–11}}\n\nVarious refinements occurred during that time, notably by [[David Cox (statistician)|David Cox]], as in {{harvtxt|Cox|1958}}.<ref name=wal67est>{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=SH|last2=Duncan|first2=DB|title=Estimation of the probability of an event as a function of several independent variables|journal=Biometrika|date=1967|volume=54|issue=1/2|pages=167–178|doi=10.2307/2333860|jstor=2333860}}</ref>\n\nThe multinomial logit model was introduced independently in {{harvtxt|Cox|1966}} and {{harvtxt|Thiel|1969}}, which greatly increased the scope of application and the popularity of the logit model.{{sfn|Cramer|p=13}} In 1973 [[Daniel McFadden]] linked the multinomial logit to the theory of [[discrete choice]], specifically [[Luce's choice axiom]], showing that the multinomial logit followed from the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] and interpreting odds of alternatives as relative preferences;<ref>{{cite chapter\n|chapter=Conditional Logit Analysis of Qualitative Choice Behavior\n|chapter-url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/reprints/mcfadden/zarembka.pdf\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110612/https://eml.berkeley.edu/reprints/mcfadden/zarembka.pdf\n|archive-date=2018-11-27\n|access-date=2019-04-20\n|first=Daniel |last=McFadden\n|authorlink=Daniel McFadden\n|editor=P.

      "text": "'''Conditional logistic regression''' is an extension of [[logistic regression]] that allows one to take into account [[stratification (clinical trials)|stratification]] and [[Matching (statistics)|matching]]. Its main field of application is [[observational studies]] and in particular [[epidemiology]]. It was devised in 1978 by [[Norman Breslow]], [[Nick Day|Nicholas Day]], K. T. Halvorsen, [[Ross L. Prentice]] and C. Sabai.<ref name=\"pmid727199\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Breslow NE, Day NE, Halvorsen KT, Prentice RL, Sabai C| title=Estimation of multiple relative risk functions in matched case-control studies. | journal=Am J Epidemiol | year= 1978 | volume= 108 | issue= 4 | pages= 299–307 | pmid=727199 | doi= 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112623| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=727199  }} </ref> It is the most flexible and general procedure for matched data.\n\n==Motivation==\nObservational studies use [[stratification (clinical trials)|stratification]] or [[Matching (statistics)|matching]] as a way to control for [[confounding]]. Several tests existed before conditional logistic regression for matched data as shown in  [[Conditional logistic regression#Related tests|related tests]]. However, they did not allow for the analysis of continuous predictors with arbitrary stratum size. All of those procedures also lack the flexibility of conditional logistic regression and in particular the possibility to control for covariates.\n\nLogistic regression can take into account stratification by having a different constant term for each stratum. Let us denote <math>Y_{i\\ell}\\in\\{0,1\\}</math> the label (e.g. case status) of the <math>\\ell</math>th observation of the <math>i</math>th stratum and <math>X_{i\\ell}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p</math> the values of the corresponding predictors. Then, the likelihood of one observation is\n\n:<math> \\mathbb{P}(Y_{i\\ell}=1|X_{i\\ell})=\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i + \\boldsymbol\\beta^\\top X_{i\\ell})}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i + \\boldsymbol\\beta^\\top X_{i\\ell})}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha_i</math> is the constant term for the <math>i</math>th stratum. While this works satisfactorily for a limited number of strata, pathological behavior occurs when the strata are small. When the strata are pairs, the number of variables grows with the number of observations <math>N</math>  (it equals <math>\\frac{N}{2}+p</math>). The asymptotic results on which [[maximum likelihood estimation]] is based on are therefore not valid and the estimation is biased. In fact, it can be shown that the unconditional analysis of matched pair data results in an estimate of the odds ratio which is the square of the correct, conditional one.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Breslow |first1=N.E. |last2=Day|first2=N.E.|date=1980 |title=Statistical Methods in Cancer Research.

In the case where the strata are pairs, where the first observation is a case and the second is a control, this can be seen as follows\n:<math> \n\\begin{align}\n& \\mathbb{P}(Y_{i1}=1,Y_{i2}=0|X_{i1},X_{i2},Y_{i1}+Y_{i2}=1) \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mathbb{P}(Y_{i1}=1|X_{i1}) \\mathbb{P}(Y_{i2}=0|X_{i2})}{\\mathbb{P}(Y_{i1}=1|X_{i1}) \\mathbb{P}(Y_{i2}=0|X_{i2})+\\mathbb{P}(Y_{i1}=0|X_{i1}) \\mathbb{P}(Y_{i2}=1|X_{i2})}\\\\[6pt]\n\\ & =\\frac{\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})}\\times\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i2})}}{\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})}\\times\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i2})}+\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})}\\times\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i2})}{1+\\exp(\\alpha_i+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i2})}}\\\\[6pt]\n\\ & =\\frac{\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})}{\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i1})+\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{i2})}. \\\\[6pt]\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWith similar computations, the conditional likelihood of a stratum of size <math>m</math>, with the <math>k</math> first observations being the cases, is \n:<math>\n\\mathbb{P}(Y_{ij}=1\\text{ for }j\\leq k,Y_{ij}=0\\text{ for } k<j\\leq m|X_{i1},...,X_{im},\\sum_{j=1}^m Y_{ij}=k)=\\frac{\\exp(\\sum_{j=1}^k \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{ij})}{\\sum_{J\\in \\mathcal{C} _{k}^{m}}  \\exp(\\sum_{j\\in J}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top X_{ij})},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{C} _{k}^{m}</math> is the set of all subsets of size <math>k</math> of the set <math>\\{1,...,m\\}</math>.\n\nThe full conditional log likelihood is then simply the sum of the log likelihoods for each stratum.

      "text": "In [[statistics]] and, in particular, in the fitting of [[linear regression|linear]] or [[logistic regression]] models, the '''elastic net''' is a [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularized]] regression method that [[Linear combination|linearly combines]] the [[Taxicab geometry|L<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|L<sub>2</sub>]] penalties of the [[Lasso (statistics)|lasso]] and [[Tikhonov regularization|ridge]] methods.\n\n==Specification==\n\nThe elastic net method overcomes the limitations of the [[Lasso (statistics)|LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)]] method which uses a penalty function based on\n:<math>\\|\\beta\\|_1 = \\textstyle \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|.</math>\nUse of this penalty function has several limitations.<ref name=ZH>{{cite journal|last1=Zou|first1=Hui|first2=Trevor|last2=Hastie|date=2005|title=Regularization and Variable Selection via the Elastic Net|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B|pages=301–320|citeseerx=10.1.1.124.4696}}</ref> For example, in the \"large ''p'', small ''n''\" case (high-dimensional data with few examples), the LASSO selects at most n variables before it saturates. Also if there is a group of highly correlated variables, then the LASSO tends to select one variable from a group and ignore the others. To overcome these limitations, the elastic net adds a quadratic part to the penalty (<math>\\|\\beta\\|^2</math>), which when used alone is [[ridge regression]] (known also as [[Tikhonov regularization]]). \nThe estimates from the elastic net method are defined by\n\n: <math> \\hat{\\beta} \\equiv \\underset{\\beta}{\\operatorname{argmin}} (\\| y-X \\beta \\|^2 + \\lambda_2 \\|\\beta\\|^2 + \\lambda_1 \\|\\beta\\|_1) .</math>\n\nThe quadratic penalty term makes the loss function strongly convex, and it therefore has a unique minimum. The elastic net method includes the LASSO and ridge regression: in other words, each of them is a special case where <math>\\lambda_1 = \\lambda, \\lambda_2 = 0</math> or <math>\\lambda_1 = 0, \\lambda_2 = \\lambda</math>. Meanwhile, the naive version of elastic net method finds an estimator in a two-stage procedure : first for each fixed <math>\\lambda_2</math> it finds the ridge regression coefficients, and then does a LASSO type shrinkage. This kind of estimation incurs a double amount of shrinkage, which leads to increased bias and poor predictions.

      "text": "{{howto|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe '''Hosmer–Lemeshow test''' is a [[statistical test]] for [[goodness of fit]] for [[logistic regression]] models. It is used frequently in [[Predictive analytics|risk prediction]] models. The test assesses whether or not the observed event rates match expected event rates in subgroups of the model population. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test specifically identifies subgroups as the [[decile]]s of fitted risk values. Models for which expected and observed event rates in subgroups are similar are called well calibrated.\n\n==Introduction==\n===Motivation===\n\nLogistic regression models provide an estimate of the probability of an outcome, usually designated as a \"success\". It is desirable that the estimated probability of success be close to the true probability. Consider the following example.\n\nA researcher wishes to know if caffeine improves performance on a memory test. Volunteers consume different amounts of caffeine from 0 to 500&nbsp;mg, and their score on the memory test is recorded. The results are shown in the table below.\n\n[[File:Caffeine grade table.png|400px|caffeine grade table for logistic regression example]]\n\nThe table has the following columns.\n\n*group: identifier for the 11 treatment groups, each receiving a different dose\n*caffeine: mg of caffeine for volunteers in a treatment group\n*n.volunteers: number of volunteers in a treatment group\n*A.grade: the number of volunteers who achieved an A grade in the memory test (success)\n*proportion.A: the proportion of volunteers who achieved an A grade\n\nThe researcher performs a logistic regression, where \"success\" is a grade of A in the memory test, and the explanatory (x) variable is dose of caffeine. The logistic regression indicates that caffeine dose is significantly associated with the probability of an A grade (p < 0.001). However, the plot of the probability of an A grade versus mg caffeine shows that the logistic model (red line) does not accurately predict the probability seen in the data (black circles).\n\n[[File:Logistic fit caffeine grade A.svg|400px|logistic fit caffeine grade A]]\n\nThe logistic model suggests that the highest proportion of A scores will occur in volunteers who consume zero mg caffeine, when in fact the highest proportion of A scores occurs in volunteer consuming in the range of 100 to 150&nbsp;mg.\n\nThe same information may be presented in another graph that is helpful when there are two or more explanatory (x) variables. This is a graph of observed proportion of successes in the data and the expected proportion as predicted by the logistic model. Ideally all the points fall on the diagonal red line.\n\n[[File:Logistic obs vs exp caffeine.svg|400px|Graph logistic obs vs exp caffeine]]\n\nThe expected probability of success (a grade of A) is given by the equation for the logistic regression model:\n\n:<math>p(success) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(b_0 + b_1 x_{1} )}} </math>\n\nwhere b<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>1</sub> are specified by the logistic regression model:\n* b<sub>0</sub> is the intercept \n* b<sub>1</sub> is the coefficient for x<sub>1</sub>\n\nFor the logistic model of P(success) vs dose of caffeine, both graphs show that, for many doses, the estimated probability is not close to the probability observed in the data. This occurs even though the regression gave a significant p-value for caffeine. It is possible to have a significant p-value, but still have poor predictions of the proportion of successes. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test is useful to determine if the poor predictions (lack of fit) are significant, indicating that there are problems with the model.\n\nThere are many possible reasons that a model may give poor predictions. In this example, the plot of the logistic regression suggests that the probability of an A score does not change monotonically with caffeine dose, as assumed by the model. Instead, it increases (from 0 to 100&nbsp;mg) and then decreases. The current model is P(success) vs caffeine, and appears to be an inadequate model. A better model might be P(success) vs caffeine + caffeine^2. The addition of the quadratic term caffeine^2 to the regression model would allow for the increasing and then decreasing relationship of grade to caffeine dose. The logistic model including the caffeine^2 term indicates that the quadratic caffeine^2 term is significant (p=0.003) while the linear caffeine term is not significant (p=0.21).\n\nThe graph below shows the observed proportion of successes in the data versus the expected proportion as predicted by the logistic model that includes the caffeine^2 term.\n\n[[File:Logistic obs vs exp caffeine quadratic.svg|400px|Graph logistic obs vs exp caffeine quadratic]]\n\nThe Hosmer–Lemeshow test can determine if the differences between observed and expected proportions are significant, indicating model lack of fit.\n\n===Pearson chi-squared goodness of fit test===\n\nThe Pearson chi-squared goodness of fit test provides a method to test if the observed and expected proportions differ significantly. This method is useful if there are many observations for each value of the x variable(s).\n\nFor the caffeine example, the observed number of A grades and non-A grades are known. The expected number (from the logistic model) can be calculated using the equation from the logistic regression. These are shown in the table below.\n\n[[File:Caffeine obs exp table.png|caffeine obs exp table]]\n\nThe null hypothesis is that the observed and expected proportions are the same across all doses. The alternative hypothesis is that the observed and expected proportions are not the same.\n\nThe Pearson chi-squared statistic is the sum of (observed – expected)^2/expected. For the caffeine data, the Pearson chi-squared statistic is 17.46. The number of degrees of freedom is the number of doses (11) minus the number of parameters from the logistic regression (2), giving 11 - 2 = 9 degrees of freedom. The probability that a chi-square statistic with df=9 will be 17.46 or greater is p = 0.042. This result indicates that, for the caffeine example, the observed and expected proportions of A grades differ significantly. The model does not accurately predict the probability of an A grade, given the caffeine dose. This result is consistent with the graphs above.\n\nIn this caffeine example, there are 30 observations for each dose, which makes calculation of the \nPearson chi-squared statistic feasible. Unfortunately, it is common that there are not enough observations for each possible combinations of values of the x variables, so the Pearson chi-squared statistic cannot be readily calculated. A solution to this problem is the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. The key concept of the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic is that, instead of observations being grouped by the values of the x variable(s), the observations are grouped by expected probability. That is, observations with similar expected probability are put into the same group, usually to create approximately 10 groups.\n\n===Calculation of the statistic===\n\nThe Hosmer–Lemeshow test statistic is given by:\n\n:<math> H = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\left(\\frac{(O_{1g} - E_{1g})^2}{E_{1g}}+\\frac{(O_{0g} - E_{0g})^2}{E_{0g}}\\right)  = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\left(\\frac{(O_{1g} - E_{1g})^2}{N_g \\pi_g}+\\frac{(N_g-O_{1g} - (N_g - E_{1g}))^2}{N_g (1-\\pi_{g})}\\right) = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} \\frac{(O_{1g} - E_{1g})^2}{N_g \\pi_g (1-\\pi_{g})} .\\,\\!</math>\n\nHere ''O''<sub>''1g''</sub>, ''E''<sub>''1g''</sub>, ''O''<sub>''0g''</sub>, ''E''<sub>''0g''</sub>, ''N''<sub>''g''</sub>, and ''π''<sub>''g''</sub> denote the observed ''Y=1'' events, expected ''Y=1'' events, observed ''Y=0'' events, expected ''Y=0'' events, total observations, predicted risk for the ''g''<sup>th</sup> risk decile group, and ''G'' is the number of groups. The test statistic asymptotically follows a [[chi-squared distribution|<math>\\chi^2</math> distribution]] with ''G''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2 degrees of freedom. The number of risk groups may be adjusted depending on how many fitted risks are determined by the model. This helps to avoid singular decile groups.\n\n\nThe Pearson chi-squared goodness of fit test cannot be readily applied if there are only one or a few observations for each possible value of an x variable, or for each possible combination of values of x variables. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was developed to address this problem.\n\nSuppose that, in the caffeine study, the researcher was not able to assign 30 volunteers to each dose. Instead, 170 volunteers reported the estimated amount of caffeine they consumed in the previous 24 hours. The data are shown in the table below.\n\n[[File:Caffeine sparse data.png|400px|Table of caffeine sparse data]]\n\nThe table shows that, for many dose levels, there are only one or a few observations. The Pearson chi-squared statistic would not give reliable estimates in this situation.\n\nThe logistic regression model for the caffeine data for 170 volunteers indicates that caffeine dose is significantly associated with an A grade, p < 0.001. The graph shows that there is a downward slope. However, the probability of an A grade as predicted by the logistic model (red line) does not accurately predict the probability estimated from the data for each dose (black circles). Despite the significant p-value for caffeine dose, there is lack of fit of the logistic curve to the observed data.\n\n[[File:Logistic graph 170 volunteers.svg|400px|logistic graph 170 volunteers]]\n\nThis version of the graph can be somewhat misleading, because different numbers of volunteers take each dose. In an alternative graph, the bubble plot, the size of the circle is proportional to the number of volunteers.<ref name=\"BilderLoughin2015\">{{Citation\n|last1=Bilder\n|first1=Christopher R.\n|last2=Loughin\n|first2= Thomas M.\n|title= Analysis of Categorical Data with R\n|edition=First\n|year=2014\n|publisher= Chapman and Hall/CRC\n|isbn= 978-1439855676\n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Bubble plot logistic 170 volunteers.svg|400px|Bubble plot logistic 170 volunteers]]\n\nThe plot of observed versus expected probability also indicates the lack of fit of the model, with much scatter around the ideal diagonal.\n\n[[File:Obs vs exp 170 caffeine.svg|400px|Graph of obs vs exp 170 caffeine logistic example]]\n\nCalculation of the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic proceeds in 6 steps,<ref name=\"KleinbaumKlein2012\">{{Citation\n|last1=Kleinbaum\n|first1=David G.\n|last2=Klein\n|first2= Mitchel\n|title= Survival analysis: A Self-learning text\n|edition=Third\n|year=2012\n|publisher= Springer\n|isbn= 978-1441966452\n}}\n</ref> using the caffeine data for 170 volunteers as an example.\n\n1. Compute p(success) for all n subjects\n\nCompute p(success) for each subject using the coefficients from the logistic regression. Subjects with the same values for the explanatory variables will have the same estimated probability of success. The table below shows the p(success), the expected proportion of volunteers with an A grade, as predicted by the logistic model.\n\n[[File:Caffeine exp table 170.png|400px|Table for caffeine 170 logistic example]]\n\n2. Order p(success) from largest to smallest values\n\nThe table from Step 1 is sorted by p(success), the expected proportion. If every volunteer took a different dose, there would be 170 different values in the table. Because there are only 21 unique dose values, there are only 21 unique values of p(success).\n\n3. Divide the ordered values into Q percentile groups\n\nThe ordered values of p(success) are divided into Q groups. The number of groups, Q, is typically 10. Because of tied values for p(success), the number of subjects in each group may not be identical. Different software implementations of the Hosmer–Lemeshow test use different methods for handling subjects with the same p(success), so the cut points to create the Q groups may differ. In addition, using a different value for Q will produce different cut points. The table in Step 4 shows the Q = 10 intervals for the caffeine data.\n\n4. Create a table of observed and expected counts\n\nThe observed number of successes and failures in each interval are obtained by counting the subjects in that interval. The expected number of successes in an interval is the sum of the probability of success for the subjects in that interval.\n\nThe table below shows the cut points for the p(success) intervals selected by the R function HLTest() from Bilder and Loughin, with the number of observed and expected A and not A.\n\n[[File:Caffeine obs exp table 170.png|caffeine obs exp table 170]]\n\n5. Calculate the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic from the table\n\nThe Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic is calculated using the formula given in the introduction, which for the caffeine example is 17.103.\n\n:<math> H = \\sum_{q=1}^{10} \\left(\\frac{(Observed.A - Expected.A)^2}{Expected.A}+\\frac{(Observed.not.A - Expected.not.A)^2}{Expected.not.A} \\right) </math>\n\n6. Calculate the p-value\n\nCompare the computed Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic to a chi-squared distribution with Q-2 degrees of freedom to calculate the p-value.\n\nThere are Q = 10 groups in the caffeine example, giving 10 – 2 = 8 degrees of freedom. The p-value for a chi-squared statistic of 17.103 with df = 8 is p = 0.029. The p-value is below alpha = 0.05, so the null hypothesis that the observed and expected proportions are the same across all doses is rejected.\n\n===Limitations and alternatives===\n\nThe Hosmer-Lemeshow test has limitations. Harrell describes several: (http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/169438/evaluating-logistic-regression-and-interpretation-of-hosmer-lemeshow-goodness-of)\n\n\n\"The Hosmer-Lemeshow test is for overall calibration error, not for any particular lack of fit such as quadratic effects. It does not properly take overfitting into account, is arbitrary to choice of bins and method of computing quantiles, and often has power that is too low.\"\n\n\"For these reasons the Hosmer-Lemeshow test is no longer recommended. Hosmer et al have a better one d.f. omnibus test of fit, implemented in the R rms package residuals.lrm function.\"\n\n\"But I recommend specifying the model to make it more likely to fit up front (especially with regard to relaxing linearity assumptions using regression splines) and using the bootstrap to estimate overfitting and to get an overfitting-corrected high-resolution smooth calibration curve to check absolute accuracy. These are done using the R rms package.\"\n\nOther alternatives have been developed to address the limitations of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.

The algorithm reduces the training complexity by selecting a small subsample of the original dataset for training. It assumes the availability of a (unreliable) pilot estimation of the parameters. It then performs a single pass over the entire dataset using the pilot estimation to identify the most \"surprising\" samples. In practice, the pilot may come from prior knowledge or training using a subsample of the dataset. The algorithm is most effective when the underlying dataset is imbalanced. It exploits the structures of conditional imbalanced datasets more efficiently than alternative methods, such as [[Logistic regression#Case-control sampling|case control sampling]] and weighted case control sampling.\n\n== Imbalanced datasets == \nIn [[Statistical classification|classification]], a dataset is a set of ''N'' data points <math> (x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^N </math>, where <math> x_i \\in\\mathbb R^d </math> is a feature vector, <math> y_i \\in \\{0,1\\} </math> is a label. Intuitively, a dataset is imbalanced when certain important statistical patterns are rare. The lack of observations of certain patterns does not always imply their irrelevance. For example, in medical studies of rare diseases, the small number of infected patients (cases) conveys the most valuable information for diagnosis and treatments.\n\nFormally, an imbalanced dataset exhibits one or more of the following properties:\n* ''Marginal Imbalance''. A dataset is marginally imbalanced if one class is rare compared to the other class. In other words, <math> \\mathbb{P}(Y=1) \\approx 0 </math>. \n* ''Conditional Imbalance''. A dataset is conditionally imbalanced when it is easy to predict the correct labels in most cases. For example, if <math> X \\in \\{0,1\\} </math>, the dataset is conditionally imbalanced if <math> \\mathbb{P}(Y=1\\mid X=0) \\approx 0 </math> and <math> \\mathbb{P}(Y=1\\mid X=1) \\approx 1 </math>.\n\n== Algorithm outline ==\nIn logistic regression, given the model <math> \\theta = (\\alpha, \\beta) </math>, the prediction is made according to <math> \\mathbb{P}(Y=1\\mid X; \\theta) =  \\tilde{p}_{\\theta}(x) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha+\\beta^T x)}{1+\\exp(\\alpha+\\beta^T x)} </math>. The local-case control sampling algorithm assumes the availability of a pilot model <math>\\tilde{\\theta} =  (\\tilde{\\alpha}, \\tilde{\\beta}) </math>. Given the pilot model, the algorithm performs a single pass over the entire dataset to select the subset of samples to include in training the logistic regression model. For a sample <math> (x,y) </math>, define the acceptance probability as <math> a(x,y) = |y-\\tilde{p}_{\\tilde{\\theta}}(x)| </math>. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n# Generate independent <math> z_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(a(x_i,y_i)) </math> for <math> i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, N\\} </math>.\n# Fit a logistic regression model to the subsample <math> S = \\{(x_i, y_i) : z_i =1 \\} </math>, obtaining the unadjusted estimates <math> \\hat{\\theta}_S = (\\hat{\\alpha}_S, \\hat{\\beta}_S) </math>. \n# The output model is <math> \\hat{\\theta} = (\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}) </math>, where <math>\\hat{\\alpha} \\leftarrow \\hat{\\alpha}_S + \\tilde{\\alpha} </math> and <math>\\hat{\\beta} \\leftarrow \\hat{\\beta}_S + \\tilde{\\beta} </math>.\n\nThe algorithm can be understood as selecting samples that surprises the pilot model. Intuitively these samples are closer to the [[decision boundary]] of the classifier and is thus more informative.\n\n=== Obtaining the pilot model ===\nIn practice, for cases where a pilot model is naturally available, the algorithm can be applied directly to reduce the complexity of training. In cases where a natural pilot is nonexistent, an estimate using a subsample selected through another sampling technique can be used instead. In the original paper describing the algorithm, the authors propose to use weighted case-control sampling with half the assigned sampling budget. For example, if the objective is to use a subsample with size <math> N=1000 </math>, first estimate a model <math>\\tilde{\\theta} </math> using <math> N_h = 500 </math> samples from weighted case control sampling, then collect another <math> N_h = 500 </math> samples using local case-control sampling.\n\n=== Larger or smaller sample size ===\nIt is possible to control the sample size by multiplying the acceptance probability with a constant <math> c </math>. For a larger sample size, pick <math> c>1 </math> and adjust the acceptance probability to <math> \\min(ca(x_i, y_i), 1) </math>. For a smaller sample size, the same strategy applies. In cases where the number of samples desired is precise, a convenient alternative method is to uniformly downsample from a larger subsample selected by local case-control sampling.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe algorithm has the following properties. When the pilot is [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]], the estimates using the samples from local case-control sampling is consistent even under [[Statistical model specification|model misspecification]]. If the model is correct then the algorithm has exactly twice the asymptotic variance of logistic regression on the full data set. For a larger sample size with <math> c>1 </math>, the factor 2 is improved to <math> 1+\\frac{1}{c} </math>.\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Machine learning]]\n[[Category:Logistic regression]]"

It attempts to determine the intensity or magnitude of customers' purchase intentions and translates that into a measure of actual buying behaviour. Logit analysis assumes that an unmet need in the marketplace has already been detected, and that the product has been [[New Product Development|designed]] to meet that need. The purpose of logit analysis is to quantify the potential sales of that product. It takes survey data on consumers' purchase intentions and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.\n\nLogit analysis defines the functional relationship between stated purchase intentions and preferences, and the actual probability of purchase. A [[preference regression (in marketing)|preference regression]] is performed on the survey data. This is then modified with actual historical observations of purchase behavior. The resultant functional relationship defines purchase probability.\n\nThis is the most useful of the purchase intention/rating translations because explicit measures of confidence level and statistical significance can be calculated. Other purchase intention/rating translations include the [[preference-rank translation]] and the [[intent scale translation]].\nThe logit function is the reciprocal function to the sigmoid logistic function.\n==See also==\n* [[marketing research]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[marketing]]\n* [[preference regression (in marketing)|preference regression]]\n* [[logit]]\n* [[Comparison of statistical packages]]\n\n[[Category:Quantitative marketing research]]\n[[Category:Product management]]\n[[Category:Logistic regression]]\n[[Category:Marketing performance measurement]]\n[[Category:Market research]]\n[[Category:Market segmentation]]"

Some examples would be:\n*Which major will a college student choose, given their grades, stated likes and dislikes, etc.?\n*Which blood type does a person have, given the results of various diagnostic tests?\n*In a hands-free mobile phone dialing application, which person's name was spoken, given various properties of the speech signal?\n*Which candidate will a person vote for, given particular demographic characteristics?\n*Which country will a firm locate an office in, given the characteristics of the firm and of the various candidate countries?\nThese are all [[statistical classification]] problems.  They all have in common a [[dependent variable]] to be predicted that comes from one of a limited set of items that cannot be meaningfully ordered, as well as a set of [[independent variable]]s (also known as features, explanators, etc.), which are used to predict the dependent variable.  Multinomial logistic regression is a particular solution to classification problems that use a linear combination of the observed features and some problem-specific parameters to estimate the probability of each particular value of the dependent variable.  The best values of the parameters for a given problem are usually determined from some training data (e.g. some people for whom both the diagnostic test results and blood types are known, or some examples of known words being spoken).\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe multinomial logistic model assumes that data are case specific; that is, each independent variable has a single value for each case. The multinomial logistic model also assumes that the dependent variable cannot be perfectly predicted from the independent variables for any case. As with other types of regression, there is no need for the independent variables to be [[statistically independent]] from each other (unlike, for example, in a [[naive Bayes classifier]]); however, [[multicollinearity|collinearity]] is assumed to be relatively low, as it becomes difficult to differentiate between the impact of several variables if this is not the case.<ref>{{cite book | last = Belsley | first = David | title = Conditioning diagnostics : collinearity and weak data in regression | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780471528890 }}</ref>\n\nIf the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it relies on the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA), which is not always desirable. This assumption states that the odds of preferring one class over another do not depend on the presence or absence of other \"irrelevant\" alternatives. For example, the relative probabilities of taking a car or bus to work do not change if a bicycle is added as an additional possibility. This allows the choice of ''K'' alternatives to be modeled as a set of ''K''-1 independent binary choices, in which one alternative is chosen as a \"pivot\" and the other ''K''-1 compared against it, one at a time. The IIA hypothesis is a core hypothesis in rational choice theory; however numerous studies in psychology show that individuals often violate this assumption when making choices. An example of a problem case arises if choices include a car and a blue bus. Suppose the odds ratio between the two is 1 : 1. Now if the option of a red bus is introduced, a person may be indifferent between a red and a blue bus, and hence may exhibit a car : blue bus : red bus odds ratio of 1 : 0.5 : 0.5, thus maintaining a 1 : 1 ratio of car : any bus while adopting a changed car : blue bus ratio of 1 : 0.5. Here the red bus option was not in fact irrelevant, because a red bus was a [[perfect substitute]] for a blue bus.\n\nIf the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it may in some situations impose too much constraint on the relative preferences between the different alternatives. This point is especially important to take into account if the analysis aims to predict how choices would change if one alternative was to disappear (for instance if one political candidate withdraws from a three candidate race). Other models like the [[nested logit]] or the [[multinomial probit]] may be used in such cases as they allow for violation of the IIA.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baltas |first=G. |last2=Doyle |first2=P. |year=2001 |title=Random Utility Models in Marketing Research: A Survey |journal=[[Journal of Business Research]] |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=115–125 |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(99)00058-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Model==\n{{See also|Logistic regression}}\n\n===Introduction===\nThere are multiple equivalent ways to describe the mathematical model underlying multinomial logistic regression.  This can make it difficult to compare different treatments of the subject in different texts.  The article on [[logistic regression]] presents a number of equivalent formulations of simple logistic regression, and many of these have analogues in the multinomial logit model.\n\nThe idea behind all of them, as in many other [[statistical classification]] techniques, is to construct a [[linear predictor function]] that constructs a score from a set of weights that are [[linear combination|linearly combined]] with the explanatory variables (features) of a given observation using a [[dot product]]:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{score}(\\mathbf{X}_i,k) = \\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i,</math>\n\nwhere '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the vector of explanatory variables describing observation ''i'', '''β'''<sub>''k''</sub> is a vector of weights (or [[regression coefficient]]s) corresponding to outcome ''k'', and score('''X'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''k'') is the score associated with assigning observation ''i'' to category ''k''.  In [[discrete choice]] theory, where observations represent people and outcomes represent choices, the score is considered the [[utility]] associated with person ''i'' choosing outcome ''k''.  The predicted outcome is the one with the highest score.\n\nThe difference between the multinomial logit model and numerous other methods, models, algorithms, etc. with the same basic setup (the [[perceptron]] algorithm, [[support vector machine]]s, [[linear discriminant analysis]], etc.) is the procedure for determining (training) the optimal weights/coefficients and the way that the score is interpreted.  In particular, in the multinomial logit model, the score can directly be converted to a probability value, indicating the [[probability]] of observation ''i'' choosing outcome ''k'' given the measured characteristics of the observation.  This provides a principled way of incorporating the prediction of a particular multinomial logit model into a larger procedure that may involve multiple such predictions, each with a possibility of error.  Without such means of combining predictions, errors tend to multiply.  For example, imagine a large [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] that is broken down into a series of submodels where the prediction of a given submodel is used as the input of another submodel, and that prediction is in turn used as the input into a third submodel, etc.  If each submodel has 90% accuracy in its predictions, and there are five submodels in series, then the overall model has only 0.9<sup>5</sup> = 59% accuracy.  If each submodel has 80% accuracy, then overall accuracy drops to 0.8<sup>5</sup> = 33% accuracy.  This issue is known as [[error propagation]] and is a serious problem in real-world predictive models, which are usually composed of numerous parts.  Predicting probabilities of each possible outcome, rather than simply making a single optimal prediction, is one means of alleviating this issue.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for how exactly the probability estimates of each outcome can help|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Setup===\nThe basic setup is the same as in [[logistic regression]], the only difference being that the [[dependent variable]]s are [[categorical variable|categorical]] rather than [[binary variable|binary]], i.e. there are ''K'' possible outcomes rather than just two.  The following description is somewhat shortened; for more details, consult the [[logistic regression]] article.\n\n====Data points====\nSpecifically, it is assumed that we have a series of ''N'' observed data points.  Each data point ''i'' (ranging from ''1'' to ''N'') consists of a set of ''M'' explanatory variables ''x''<sub>''1,i''</sub> ... ''x''<sub>''M,i''</sub> (aka [[independent variable]]s, predictor variables, features, etc.), and an associated [[categorical variable|categorical]] outcome ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> (aka [[dependent variable]], response variable), which can take on one of ''K'' possible values.  These possible values represent logically separate categories (e.g. different political parties, blood types, etc.), and are often described mathematically by arbitrarily assigning each a number from 1 to ''K''.  The explanatory variables and outcome represent observed properties of the data points, and are often thought of as originating in the observations of ''N'' \"experiments\" — although an \"experiment\" may consist in nothing more than gathering data.  The goal of multinomial logistic regression is to construct a model that explains the relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome, so that the outcome of a new \"experiment\" can be correctly predicted for a new data point for which the explanatory variables, but not the outcome, are available.  In the process, the model attempts to explain the relative effect of differing explanatory variables on the outcome.\n\nSome examples:\n*The observed outcomes are different variants of a disease such as [[hepatitis]] (possibly including \"no disease\" and/or other related diseases) in a set of patients, and the explanatory variables might be characteristics of the patients thought to be pertinent (sex, race, age, [[blood pressure]], outcomes of various liver-function tests, etc.).  The goal is then to predict which disease is causing the observed liver-related symptoms in a new patient.\n*The observed outcomes are the party chosen by a set of people in an election, and the explanatory variables are the demographic characteristics of each person (e.g. sex, race, age, income, etc.).  The goal is then to predict the likely vote of a new voter with given characteristics.\n\n====Linear predictor====\nAs in other forms of linear regression, multinomial logistic regression uses a [[linear predictor function]] <math>f(k,i)</math> to predict the probability that observation ''i'' has outcome ''k'', of the following form:\n\n:<math>f(k,i) = \\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{1,i}  + \\beta_{2,k} x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_{M,k} x_{M,i},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\beta_{m,k}</math> is a [[regression coefficient]] associated with the ''m''th explanatory variable and the ''k''th outcome.  As explained in the [[logistic regression]] article, the regression coefficients and explanatory variables are normally grouped into vectors of size ''M+1'', so that the predictor function can be written more compactly:\n\n:<math>f(k,i) = \\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta_k</math> is the set of regression coefficients associated with outcome ''k'', and <math>\\mathbf{x}_i</math> (a row vector) is the set of explanatory variables associated with observation ''i''.\n\n===As a set of independent binary regressions===\nOne fairly simple way to arrive at the multinomial logit model is to imagine, for ''K'' possible outcomes, running ''K''-1 independent binary logistic regression models, in which one outcome is chosen as a \"pivot\" and then the other ''K''-1 outcomes are separately regressed against the pivot outcome.  This would proceed as follows, if outcome ''K'' (the last outcome) is chosen as the pivot:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=1)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=2)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=K-1)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNote that we have introduced separate sets of regression coefficients, one for each possible outcome.\n\nIf we exponentiate both sides, and solve for the probabilities, we get:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nUsing the fact that all ''K'' of the probabilities must sum to one, we find:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=K) = 1- \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \\Pr (Y_i = k) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\Rightarrow \\Pr(Y_i=K) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nWe can use this to find the other probabilities:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe fact that we run multiple regressions reveals why the model relies on the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] described above.\n\n===Estimating the coefficients===\n\nThe unknown parameters in each vector ''β<sub>k</sub>'' are typically jointly estimated by [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, which is an extension of [[maximum likelihood]] using [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] of the weights to prevent pathological solutions (usually a squared regularizing function, which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] [[prior distribution]] on the weights, but other distributions are also possible).  The solution is typically found using an iterative procedure such as [[generalized iterative scaling]],<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Generalized iterative scaling for log-linear models |author1=Darroch, J.N.  |author2=Ratcliff, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=1470–1480 |year=1972 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177692379 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177692379}}</ref> [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] (IRLS),<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |pages=206–209}}</ref> by means of [[gradient-based optimization]] algorithms such as [[L-BFGS]],<ref name=\"malouf\"/> or by specialized [[coordinate descent]] algorithms.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Hsiang-Fu |last1=Yu |first2=Fang-Lan |last2=Huang |first3=Chih-Jen |last3=Lin |year=2011 |title=Dual coordinate descent methods for logistic regression and maximum entropy models |journal=Machine Learning |volume=85 |issue=1–2 |pages=41–75 |url=http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/maxent_dual.pdf |doi=10.1007/s10994-010-5221-8}}</ref>\n\n===As a log-linear model===\n\nThe formulation of binary logistic regression as a [[Logistic regression#log-linear model|log-linear model]] can be directly extended to multi-way regression.  That is, we model the [[logarithm]] of the probability of seeing a given output using the linear predictor as well as an additional [[normalization factor]], the logarithm of the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs in the binary case, we need an extra term <math>- \\ln Z</math> to ensure that the whole set of probabilities forms a [[probability distribution]], i.e. so that they all sum to one:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Pr(Y_i=k) = 1</math>\n\nThe reason why we need to add a term to ensure normalization, rather than multiply as is usual, is because we have taken the logarithm of the probabilities.  Exponentiating both sides turns the additive term into a multiplicative factor, so that the probability is just the [[Gibbs measure]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe quantity ''Z'' is called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] for the distribution. We can compute the value of the partition function by applying the above constraint that requires all probabilities to sum to 1:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Pr(Y_i=k) &= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>Z = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}</math>\n\nNote that this factor is \"constant\" in the sense that it is not a function of ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>, which is the variable over which the probability distribution is defined.  However, it is definitely not constant with respect to the explanatory variables, or crucially, with respect to the unknown regression coefficients '''''β'''''<sub>''k''</sub>, which we will need to determine through some sort of [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] procedure.\n\nThe resulting equations for the probabilities are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k\n\\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr generally:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nThe following function:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{e^{x_k}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}}</math>\n\nis referred to as the [[softmax function]].  The reason is that the effect of exponentiating the values <math>x_1,\\ldots,x_n</math> is to exaggerate the differences between them.  As a result, <math>\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</math> will return a value close to 0 whenever ''<math>x_k</math>'' is significantly less than the maximum of all the values, and will return a value close to 1 when applied to the maximum value, unless it is extremely close to the next-largest value.  Thus, the softmax function can be used to construct a [[weighted average]] that behaves as a [[smooth function]] (which can be conveniently [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiated]], etc.) and which approximates the [[indicator function]]\n\n:<math>f(k) = \\begin{cases}\n               1 \\; \\textrm{ if } \\; k = \\operatorname{\\arg\\max}(x_1, \\ldots, x_n), \\\\\n               0 \\; \\textrm{ otherwise}.\n              \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThus, we can write the probability equations as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\operatorname{softmax}(c, \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i)</math>\n\nThe softmax function thus serves as the equivalent of the [[logistic function]] in binary logistic regression.\n\nNote that not all of the <math>\\beta_k</math> vectors of coefficients are uniquely [[identifiability|identifiable]].  This is due to the fact that all probabilities must sum to 1, making one of them completely determined once all the rest are known.  As a result, there are only <math>k-1</math> separately specifiable probabilities, and hence <math>k-1</math> separately identifiable vectors of coefficients.  One way to see this is to note that if we add a constant vector to all of the coefficient vectors, the equations are identical:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_c + C) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_k + C) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs a result, it is conventional to set <math>C = -\\boldsymbol\\beta_K</math> (or alternatively, one of the other coefficient vectors).  Essentially, we set the constant so that one of the vectors becomes 0, and all of the other vectors get transformed into the difference between those vectors and the vector we chose.  This is equivalent to \"pivoting\" around one of the ''K'' choices, and examining how much better or worse all of the other ''K''-1 choices are, relative to the choice are pivoting around.  Mathematically, we transform the coefficients as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_1 &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_{K-1} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} - \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_K &= 0\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis leads to the following equations:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOther than the prime symbols on the regression coefficients, this is exactly the same as the form of the model described above, in terms of ''K''-1 independent two-way regressions.\n\n===As a latent-variable model===\n\nIt is also possible to formulate multinomial logistic regression as a latent variable model, following the [[Logistic regression#As a two-way latent-variable model|two-way latent variable model]] described for binary logistic regression.  This formulation is common in the theory of [[discrete choice]] models, and makes it easier to compare multinomial logistic regression to the related [[multinomial probit]] model, as well as to extend it to more complex models.\n\nImagine that, for each data point ''i'' and possible outcome ''k'', there is a continuous [[latent variable]] ''Y''<sub>''i,k''</sub><sup>''*''</sup> (i.e. an unobserved [[random variable]]) that is distributed as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nY_{i,1}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 \\, \\\\\nY_{i,2}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_2 \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\nY_{i,K}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_K \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon_k \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(0,1),</math> i.e. a standard type-1 [[extreme value distribution]].\n\nThis latent variable can be thought of as the [[utility]] associated with data point ''i'' choosing outcome ''k'', where there is some randomness in the actual amount of utility obtained, which accounts for other unmodeled factors that go into the choice.  The value of the actual variable <math>Y_i</math> is then determined in a non-random fashion from these latent variables (i.e. the randomness has been moved from the observed outcomes into the latent variables), where outcome ''k'' is chosen if and only if the associated utility (the value of <math>Y_{i,k}^{\\ast}</math>) is greater than the utilities of all the other choices, i.e. if the utility associated with outcome ''k'' is the maximum of all the utilities. Since the latent variables are [[continuous variable|continuous]], the probability of two having exactly the same value is 0, so we ignore the scenario. That is:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K-1}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,1}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,2}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nLet's look more closely at the first equation, which we can write as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,k}^{\\ast}\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} - Y_{i,k}^{\\ast} > 0\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 - (\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_k) > 0\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr((\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_k) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i > \\varepsilon_k - \\varepsilon_1\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThere are a few things to realize here:\n#In general, if <math>X \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b)</math> and <math>Y \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b)</math> then <math>X - Y \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b).</math> That is, the difference of two [[independent identically distributed]] extreme-value-distributed variables follows the [[logistic distribution]], where the first parameter is unimportant.  This is understandable since the first parameter is a [[location parameter]], i.e. it shifts the mean by a fixed amount, and if two values are both shifted by the same amount, their difference remains the same. This means that all of the relational statements underlying the probability of a given choice involve the logistic distribution, which makes the initial choice of the extreme-value distribution, which seemed rather arbitrary, somewhat more understandable.\n#The second parameter in an extreme-value or logistic distribution is a [[scale parameter]], such that if <math>X \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,1)</math> then <math>bX \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b).</math> This means that the effect of using an error variable with an arbitrary scale parameter in place of scale 1 can be compensated simply by multiplying all regression vectors by the same scale.  Together with the previous point, this shows that the use of a standard extreme-value distribution (location 0, scale 1) for the error variables entails no loss of generality over using an arbitrary extreme-value distribution.  In fact, the model is [[nonidentifiable]] (no single set of optimal coefficients) if the more general distribution is used.\n#Because only differences of vectors of regression coefficients are used, adding an arbitrary constant to all coefficient vectors has no effect on the model.  This means that, just as in the log-linear model, only ''K''-1 of the coefficient vectors are identifiable, and the last one can be set to an arbitrary value (e.g. 0).\n\nActually finding the values of the above probabilities is somewhat difficult, and is a problem of computing a particular [[order statistic]] (the first, i.e. maximum) of a set of values.  However, it can be shown that the resulting expressions are the same as in above formulations, i.e. the two are equivalent.\n\n==Estimation of intercept==\nWhen using multinomial logistic regression, one category of the dependent variable is chosen as the reference category. Separate [[odds ratio]]s are determined for all independent variables for each category of the dependent variable with the exception of the reference category, which is omitted from the analysis. The exponential beta coefficient represents the change in the odds of the dependent variable being in a particular category vis-a-vis the reference category,  associated with a one unit change of the corresponding independent variable.\n\n==Application in natural language processing==\nIn [[natural language processing]], multinomial LR classifiers are commonly used as an alternative to [[naive Bayes classifier]]s because they do not assume [[statistical independence]] of the random variables (commonly known as ''features'') that serve as predictors.  However, learning in such a model is slower than for a naive Bayes classifier, and thus may not be appropriate given a very large number of classes to learn. In particular, learning in a Naive Bayes classifier is a simple matter of counting up the number of co-occurrences of features and classes, while in a maximum entropy classifier the weights, which are typically maximized using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, must be learned using an iterative procedure; see [[#Estimating the coefficients]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Logistic regression]]\n* [[Multinomial probit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Logistic regression]]\n[[Category:Classification algorithms]]\n[[Category:Regression models]]"

It can be thought of as an extension of the [[logistic regression]] model that applies to [[dichotomous]] dependent variables, allowing for more than two (ordered) response categories.\n\n==The model and the proportional odds assumption==\n\nThe model only applies to data that meet the ''proportional odds assumption'', the meaning of which can be exemplified as follows.  Suppose the proportions of members of the statistical population who would answer \"poor\", \"fair\", \"good\", \"very good\", and \"excellent\" are respectively ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ''p''<sub>3</sub>, ''p''<sub>4</sub>, ''p''<sub>5</sub>.  Then the logarithms of the [[odds]] (not the logarithms of the probabilities) of answering in certain ways are:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{array}{rll}\n\\text{poor}, & \\log\\frac{p_1}{p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5}, & 0 \\\\[8pt]\n\\text{poor or fair}, & \\log\\frac{p_1+p_2}{p_3+p_4+p_5}, & 1 \\\\[8pt]\n\\text{poor, fair, or good}, & \\log\\frac{p_1+p_2+p_3}{p_4+p_5}, & 2 \\\\[8pt]\n\\text{poor, fair, good, or very good}, & \\log\\frac{p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4}{p_5}, & 3\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThe '''proportional odds assumption''' is that the number added to each of these logarithms to get the next is the same in every case.  In other words, these logarithms form an arithmetic sequence.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stata Data Analysis Examples: Ordinal Logistic Regression |work= |publisher=UCLA |date= |url=https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/dae/ordered-logistic-regression }}</ref> The model states that the number in the last column of the table—the number of times that that logarithm must be added—is some [[linear combination]] of the other observed variables.\n\nThe coefficients in the linear combination cannot be [[consistency (statistics)|consistently]] estimated using [[ordinary least squares]].  They are usually estimated using [[maximum likelihood]].  The maximum-likelihood estimates are computed by using [[iteratively reweighted least squares]].\n\nExamples of multiple ordered response categories include bond ratings, opinion surveys with responses ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree,\" levels of state spending on government programs (high, medium, or low), the level of insurance coverage chosen (none, partial, or full), and employment status (not employed, employed part-time, or fully employed).<ref>{{cite book |last=Greene |first=William H. |authorlink=William Greene (economist) |title=Econometric Analysis |edition=Seventh |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-273-75356-8 |pages=824–827 }}</ref>\n\nSuppose the underlying process to be characterized is\n\n:<math>y^{*} = \\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\beta + \\varepsilon, \\, </math>\n\nwhere <math>y^{*}</math> is the exact but unobserved dependent variable (perhaps the exact level of agreement with the statement proposed by the pollster); <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> is the vector of independent variables, <math>\\varepsilon</math> is the [[errors and residuals|error term]], and <math>\\beta</math> is the vector of regression coefficients which we wish to estimate.

      "text": "\nIn [[statistics]], '''separation''' is a phenomenon associated with models for [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] or categorical outcomes, including [[logistic regression|logistic]] and [[probit regression]].  Separation occurs if the predictor (or a [[linear combination]] of some subset of the predictors) is associated with only one outcome value when the predictor is greater than some constant.  \n\nFor example, if the predictor ''X'' is continuous, and the outcome ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 for all observed ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2.

It is also sometimes known as '''Varbrul analysis''', after the name of a software package dedicated to carrying out the relevant statistical computations (''Varbrul'', from \"'''var'''ia'''b'''le '''rul'''e\"). The method goes back to a theoretical approach developed by the sociolinguist [[William Labov]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and its mathematical implementation was developed by Henrietta Cedergren and [[David Sankoff]] in 1974.<ref>Cedergren, H.; and Sankoff, D. (1974). Variable rules: Performance as a statistical reflection of competence. ''Language'', ''50'', 333-355.</ref>\n\nA variable rules analysis is designed to provide a quantitative model of a situation where speakers alternate between different forms that have the same meaning and stand in [[free variation]], but in such a way that the probability of choice of either the one or the other form is conditioned by a variety of context factors or social characteristics. Such a situation, where variation is not entirely random but rule-governed, is also known as \"structured variation\". A variable rules analysis computes a [[multivariate analysis|multivariate]] statistical model, on the basis of observed token counts, such that each determining factor is assigned a numerical factor weight that describes how it influences the probabilities of choice of either form. This is done by means of [[stepwise regression|stepwise]] [[logistic regression]], using a [[maximum likelihood]] algorithm.\n\nAlthough the necessary computations required for a variable rules analysis can be carried out with the help of mainstream general-purpose statistics software packages such as [[SPSS]], it is more often done by means of a specialised software dedicated to the needs of linguists, called ''Varbrul''.
