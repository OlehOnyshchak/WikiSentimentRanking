The underlying [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[domino problem]] implies that there exists no systematic [[effective procedure|procedure]] for deciding whether a given set of tiles can tile the plane.\n\n==History==\n[[Polygon]]s are [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] [[Shape|figure]]s which are bounded by straight [[line segment]]s. [[Regular polygon]]s have [[Equilateral polygon|all sides of equal length]] as well as [[Equiangular polygon|all angles of equal measure]]. As early as AD 325, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] knew that only 3 types of regular polygons (the square, equilateral triangle, and hexagon) can fit perfectly together in repeating [[tessellation]]s on a [[Euclidean plane]]. Within that plane, every triangle, irrespective of regularity, will tessellate. In contrast, regular pentagons do not tessellate. However, irregular pentagons, with different sides and angles can tessellate. There are 15 irregular convex pentagons that tile the plane.<ref>https://www.quantamagazine.org/pentagon-tiling-proof-solves-century-old-math-problem-20170711/</ref>\n\n[[Polyhedra]] are the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] correlates of polygons. They are built from [[Face (geometry)|flat faces]] and [[Edge (geometry)|straight edges]] and have sharp corner turns at the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. Although a cube is the only regular polyhedron that admits of tessellation,<!--Aristotle mistakenly thought the tetrahedron tessellates.--> many non-regular 3-dimensional shapes can tessellate, such as the [[truncated octahedron]].\n\nThe second part of [[Hilbert's eighteenth problem]] asked for a single polyhedron tiling [[Three-dimensional space|Euclidean 3-space]], such that no tiling by it is [[isohedral]] (an [[anisohedral tiling|anisohedral]] tile). The problem as stated was solved by [[Karl Reinhardt (mathematician)|Karl Reinhardt]] in 1928, but sets of aperiodic tilies have been considered as a natural extension.<ref>Senechal, pp 22–24.</ref>\nThe specific question of aperiodic sets of tiles first arose in 1961, when logician [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] tried to determine whether the [[Domino Problem]] is decidable — that is, whether there exists an algorithm for deciding if a given finite set of prototiles admits a tiling of the plane. Wang found algorithms to enumerate the tilesets that cannot tile the plane, and the tilesets that tile it periodically; by this he showed that such a decision algorithm exists if every finite set of prototiles that admits a tiling of the plane also admits a periodic tiling.<!--but was it Wang or Berger that proved the other direction?-->\n\n[[File:Wang tiles.svg|thumb|right|250px|These [[Wang tile]]s will yield only non-periodic tilings of the plane and so are aperiodic.]]\n\nHence, when in 1966 [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] found an aperiodic set of prototiles this demonstrated that the tiling problem is in fact not decidable.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Berger | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Berger (mathematician) | year=1966 | title=The undecidability of the domino problem | journal=Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society | issue=66 | pages=1–72}}</ref> (Thus Wang's procedures do not work on all tile sets, although that does not render them useless for practical purposes.) This first such set, used by Berger in his proof of undecidability, required 20,426 Wang tiles. Berger later reduced his set to 104, and [[Hans Läuchli]] subsequently found an aperiodic set requiring only 40 Wang tiles.<ref>Grünbaum and Shephard, section 11.1.</ref> The set of 13 tiles given in the illustration on the right is an aperiodic set published by [[Karel Culik]], II, in 1996.\n\nHowever, a smaller aperiodic set, of six non-Wang tiles, was discovered by [[Raphael M. Robinson]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Robinson | first=Raphael M. | year=1971 | title=Undecidability and Nonperiodicity for Tilings of the Plane | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=177–209 | doi=10.1007/BF01418780 | bibcode=1971InMat..12..177R}}</ref> [[Roger Penrose]] discovered three more sets in 1973 and 1974, reducing the number of tiles needed to two, and [[Robert Ammann]] discovered several new sets in 1977.

Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained in this way is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.\n\nA tiling is called aperiodic if its hull contains only non-periodic tilings. The [[hull (tiling)|hull]] of a tiling <math>T \\in \\R^d</math> contains all translates ''T+x'' of ''T'', together with all tilings that can be approximated by translates of ''T''. Formally this is the closure of the set <math>\\{ T+x \\, : \\, x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\}</math> in the local topology.<ref name=\"tao\">{{cite book | last = Baake|first=M.|last2=Grimm|first2=Uwe|title=Aperiodic Order. Vol 1: A Mathematical Invitation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013}}</ref> In the local topology (resp. the corresponding metric) two tiles are <math>\\varepsilon</math>-close if they agree in a ball of radius <math>1/\\varepsilon</math> around the origin (possibly after shifting one of the tilings by an amount less than <math>\\varepsilon</math>).\n\nTo give an even simpler example than above, consider a one-dimensional tiling ''T'' of the line that looks like {{not a typo|...''aaaaaabaaaaa''...}} where ''a'' represents an interval of length one, ''b'' represents an interval of length two. Thus the tiling ''T'' consists of infinitely many copies of ''a'' and one copy of ''b'' (with centre 0, say). Now all translates of ''T'' are the tilings with one ''b'' somewhere and ''a''s else. The sequence of tilings where ''b'' is centred at <math>1,2,4, \\ldots,2^n,\\ldots</math> converges - in the local topology - to the periodic tiling consisting of ''a''s only. Thus ''T'' is not an aperiodic tiling, since its hull contains the periodic tiling {{not a typo|...''aaaaaa''....}}\n\nFor many well-behaved tilings (e.g. substitution tilings with finitely many local patterns) holds: if a tiling is non-periodic and [[repetitive tiling|repetitive]] (i.e. the each patch occurs [[uniformly dense]] throughout the tiling) then it is aperiodic.<ref name=\"tao\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe first specific occurrence of aperiodic tilings arose in 1961, when logician [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] tried to determine whether the [[Domino Problem]] is decidable — that is, whether there exists an algorithm for deciding if a given finite set of prototiles admits a tiling of the plane.

Despite this, the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[Domino Problem]] ensures that there must be infinitely many distinct principles of construction, and that in fact, there exist aperiodic sets of tiles for which there can be no proof of their aperiodicity.\n\n===Aperiodic hierarchical tilings===\n\nTo date, there is not a formal definition describing when a tiling has a hierarchical structure; nonetheless, it is clear that substitution tilings have them, as do the tilings of Berger, [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]], [[Hans Läuchli|Läuchli]] and [[Raphael Robinson|Robinson]]. As with the term \"aperiodic tiling\" itself, the term \"aperiodic ''hierarchical'' tiling\" is a convenient shorthand, meaning something along the lines of \"a set of tiles admitting only non-periodic tilings with a hierarchical structure\".\n\nEach of these sets of tiles, in any tiling they admit, forces a particular hierarchical structure. (In many later examples, this structure can be described as a substitution tiling system; this is described below). No tiling admitted by such a set of tiles can be periodic, simply because no single translation can leave the entire hierarchical structure invariant. Consider Robinson's 1971 tiles:\n\n[[Image:Robinson tiles.svg|center|thumbnail|200px|The Robinson Tiles]]\n\nAny tiling by these tiles can only exhibit a hierarchy of square lattices: each orange square is at the corner of a larger orange square, ad infinitum. Any translation must be smaller than some size of square, and so cannot leave any such tiling invariant.\n\n[[Image:Robinson tiling.jpg|center|thumbnail|300px|A portion of tiling by the Robinson tiles]]\n\nRobinson proves these tiles must form this structure inductively; in effect, the tiles must form blocks which themselves fit together as larger versions of the original tiles, and so on.\nThis idea — of finding sets of tiles that can only admit hierarchical structures — has been used in the construction of most known aperiodic sets of tiles to date.\n\n===Substitutions===\n\n{{main|Substitution tiling|L-system}}\n\nSubstitution tiling systems provide a rich source of aperiodic tilings. A set of tiles that forces a substitution structure to emerge is said to '''enforce''' the substitution structure. For example, the chair tiles shown below admit a substitution, and a portion of a substitution tiling is shown at right below. These substitution tilings are necessarily non-periodic, in precisely the same manner as described above, but the chair tile itself is not aperiodic—it is easy to find periodic tilings by unmarked chair tiles.\n\n[[Image:L substitution system.jpg|center|thumb|300px|The chair substitution tiling system.]]\n\nHowever, the tiles shown below force the chair substitution structure to emerge, and so are themselves aperiodic.<ref name = \"goodman-strauss (1999a)\">{{cite journal| last = Goodman-Strauss|first = Chaim| title = A small aperiodic set of planar tiles| journal = [[European Journal of Combinatorics]]| year = 1999| volume = 20| issue = 5| pages = 375–384| doi = 10.1006/eujc.1998.0281}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:trilobite and crab.svg|center| thumb|300px|The [[Trilobite and cross tiles|Trilobite and Cross tiles]] enforce the chair substitution structure—they can only admit tilings in which the chair substitution can be discerned and so are aperiodic.]]\n\nThe Penrose tiles, and shortly thereafter Amman's several different sets of tiles,<ref name=\"grunbaum and shephard\">{{cite book | last = Grünbaum | first = Branko | authorlink = Branko Grünbaum |author2=Geoffrey C.

In 1975 [[Robert Ammann]] had already extended the Penrose construction to a three-dimensional icosahedral equivalent. In such cases the term 'tiling' is taken to mean 'filling the space'. Photonic devices are currently built as aperiodical sequences of different layers, being thus aperiodic in one direction and periodic in the other two. Quasicrystal structures of Cd-Te appear to consist of atomic layers in which the atoms are arranged in a planar aperiodic pattern. Sometimes an energetical minimum or a maximum of entropy occur for such aperiodic structures. Steinhardt has shown that Gummelt's overlapping decagons allow the application of an extremal principle and thus provide the link between the mathematics of aperiodic tiling and the structure of quasicrystals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wwwphy.princeton.edu/~steinh/quasi/ | title=A New Paradigm for the Structure of Quasicrystals | accessdate=2007-03-26 | last=Steinhardt | first=Paul J.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070223124748/http://wwwphy.princeton.edu/~steinh/quasi/| archivedate= 23 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Faraday wave]]s have been observed to form large patches of aperiodic patterns.<ref>W.

S., Mercier D., Stable quasicrystals, Acta Phys. Superficierum 8(2006)115</ref>\n\n==Confusion regarding terminology==\n\nThe term ''aperiodic'' has been used in a wide variety of ways in the mathematical literature on tilings (and in other mathematical fields as well, such as dynamical systems or graph theory, with altogether different meanings). With respect to tilings the term aperiodic was sometimes used synonymously with the term non-periodic. A ''non-periodic'' tiling is simply one that is not fixed by any non-trivial translation. Sometimes the term described - implicitly or explicitly - a tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Frequently the term aperiodic was just used vaguely to describe the structures under consideration, referring to physical aperiodic solids, namely quasicrystals, or to something non-periodic with some kind of global order.\n\nThe use of the word \"tiling\" is problematic as well, despite its straightforward definition. There is no single [[Penrose tiling]], for example: the Penrose rhombs admit infinitely many tilings (which cannot be distinguished locally). A common solution is to try to use the terms carefully in technical writing, but recognize the widespread use of the informal terms.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girih tiles]]\n* [[List of aperiodic sets of tiles]]\n* [[Quasicrystal]]\n* [[Zellige]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/tiling.html The Geometry Junkyard]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060830155826/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/aperiod.htm Aperiodic Tilings]\n\n{{Tessellation}}\n\n[[Category:Aperiodic tilings| ]]"

P. M. Beenker]].\nBecause all tilings obtained with the tiles are non-periodic, Ammann–Beenker tilings are considered aperiodic tilings. They are one of the five sets of tilings discovered by Ammann and described in ''Tilings and Patterns''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Branko Grünbaum|B. Grünbaum]] and G.C. Shephard, ''Tilings and Patterns'', Freemann, NY 1986</ref>\n\nThe Ammann–Beenker tilings have many properties similar to the more famous [[Penrose tiling]]s, most notably:\n*They are nonperiodic, which means that they lack any [[translational symmetry]].\n*Their non-periodicity is implied by their hierarchical structure: the tilings are substitution tilings arising from substitution rules for growing larger and larger patches. This substitution structure also implies that:\n*Any finite region (patch) in a tiling appears infinitely many times in that tiling and, in fact, in any other tiling. Thus, the infinite tilings all look similar to one another, if one looks only at finite patches.\n*They are [[quasicrystal]]line: implemented as a physical structure an Ammann–Beenker tiling will produce [[Bragg diffraction]]; the diffractogram reveals both the underlying eightfold symmetry and the long-range order.  This order reflects the fact that the tilings are organized, not through translational symmetry, but rather through a process sometimes called \"deflation\" or \"inflation.\"\n*All of this infinite global structure is forced through local matching rules on a pair of tiles, among the very simplest aperiodic sets of tiles ever found, Ammann's A5 set. <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nVarious methods to describe the tilings have been proposed: matching rules, substitutions, cut and project schemes <ref>Beenker FPM, Algebraic theory of non periodic tilings of the plane by two simple building blocks: a square and a rhombus, TH Report 82-WSK-04 (1982), Technische Hogeschool, Eindhoven</ref> and coverings.<ref>F.

One consists of two squares overlapping on a smaller square, while the other consists of a large square attached to a smaller square. The diagrams below show the pieces and a portion of the tilings.\n\n[[Image:ammannbeenkerreplace2.svg]] This is the substitution rule for the alternate tileset.\n\n[[Image:ammannbeenker.PNG]] The relationship between the two tilesets.\n\nIn addition to the edge arrows in the usual tileset, the matching rules for both tilesets can be expressed by drawing pieces of large arrows at the vertices, and requiring them to piece together into full arrows.\n\nKatz<ref>{{cite book|author =Katz, A|chapter=Matching rules and quasiperiodicity: the octagonal tilings|title=Beyond quasicrystals|publisher=Springer|year=1995|pages=141–189|isbn=978-3-540-59251-8|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03130-8_6|editor1-first=F.|editor1-last=Axel|editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Gratias}}</ref> has studied the additional tilings allowed by dropping the vertex constraints and imposing only the requirement that the edge arrows match. Since this requirement is itself preserved by the substitution rules, any new tiling has an infinite sequence of \"enlarged\" copies obtained by successive applications of the substitution rule. Each tiling in the sequence is indistinguishable from a true Ammann–Beenker tiling on a successively larger scale. Since some of these tilings are periodic, it follows that no decoration of the tiles which does force aperiodicity can be determined by looking at any finite patch of the tiling. The orientation of the vertex arrows which force aperiodicity, then, can only be deduced from the entire infinite tiling.\n\nThe tiling has also an extremal property : among the tilings whose rhombuses ''alternate'' (that is, whenever two rhombuses are adjacent or separated by a row of square, they appear in different orientations), the proportion of squares is found to be minimal in the Ammann–Beenker tilings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bédaride|first1= N.|last2= Fernique|first2= T.|chapter= The Ammann-Beenker Tilings Revisited|arxiv= 1208.3545v1|title=Aperiodic Crystals|publisher=Springer|pages=59–65|editor1-last=Schmid |editor1-first=S.|editor2-last= Withers |editor2-first=R.|editor3-last= Lifshitz|editor3-first= R.|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-6431-6_8|isbn=978-94-007-6430-9|date=2013}}</ref>\n\n==Pell and silver ratio features==\nThe Ammann–Beenker tilings are closely related to the [[silver ratio]] (<math>1 + \\sqrt 2</math>) and the [[Pell number]]s.\n\n*the [[substitution (logic)|substitution]] scheme <math> R \\to RrR; r \\to R </math> introduces the ratio as a scaling factor: its matrix is the Pell substitution matrix, and the series of words produced by the substitution have the property that the number of <math>r</math>s and <math>R</math>s are equal to successive Pell numbers.\n*the [[eigenvalues]] of the substitution matrix are <math>1+\\sqrt 2</math> and <math>1-\\sqrt 2</math>.\n* In the alternate tileset, the long edges have <math>1+\\sqrt 2</math> times longer sides than the short edges.\n* One set of [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] worms, formed by the short and long diagonals of the rhombs, forms the above strings, with r as the short diagonal and R as the long diagonal.

Note that the bars for the asymmetric tile extend partly outside it.\n\n== Cut-and-project construction ==\n\nThe [[tesseractic honeycomb]] has an eightfold rotational symmetry, corresponding to an eightfold rotational symmetry of the [[tesseract]]. A rotation matrix representing this symmetry is:\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nTransforming this matrix to the new coordinates given by \n:<math>B = \\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 & 0 & -1/2 & \\sqrt 2/2 \\\\ 1/2 & \\sqrt 2/2 & -1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 0 & -1/2 & -\\sqrt 2/2 \\\\ -1/2 & \\sqrt 2/2 & 1/2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}</math> will produce:\n:<math>B A B^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt 2/2 & \\sqrt 2/2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\sqrt 2/2 & \\sqrt 2/2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\sqrt 2/2 & \\sqrt 2/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\sqrt 2/2 & -\\sqrt 2/2 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nThis third matrix then corresponds to a rotation both by 45° (in the first two dimensions) and by 135° (in the last two). We can then obtain an Ammann–Beenker tiling by projecting a slab of hypercubes along either the first two or the last two of the new coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, an Ammann–Beenker tiling can be obtained by drawing rhombs and squares around the intersection points of pair of equal-scale square lattices overlaid at a 45-degree angle. These two techniques were developed by Beenker in his paper.\n\nA related high dimensional embedding into the [[tesseractic honeycomb]] is the Klotz construction, as detailed in its application here in the Baake and Joseph paper.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Baake, M  |author2=Joseph, D |title = Ideal and Defective Vertex Configurations in the Planar Octagonal Quasilattice | journal = Physical Review B | year = 1990 | volume = 42 | pages = 8091 ff | doi=10.1103/physrevb.42.8091|bibcode=1990PhRvB..42.8091B }}</ref> The octagonal acceptance domain thus can be further dissected into parts, each of which then give rise for exactly one vertex configuration.

Moreover, the tile is not simply connected.\n\nThe existence of a strongly aperiodic tile set consisting of one connected tile without matching rules is an unsolved problem.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Tessellation}}\n\n[[Category:Aperiodic tilings]]\n[[Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics]]"

Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist [[Roger Penrose]], who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both [[reflection symmetry]] and fivefold [[rotational symmetry]], as in the diagram at the right.\n\nPenrose tiling is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any [[translational symmetry]]. It is [[self-similarity|self-similar]], so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales. Thus, the tiling can be obtained through \"inflation\" (or \"deflation\") and every finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times. It is a [[quasicrystal]]: implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce [[Bragg diffraction]] and its diffractogram reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.\n\nVarious methods to construct Penrose tilings have been discovered, including matching rules, [[substitution tiling|substitutions]] or [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]]s, cut and project schemes and coverings.\n[[File:RogerPenroseTileTAMU2010.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Roger Penrose]] in the foyer of the Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy, [[Texas A&M University]], standing on a floor with a Penrose tiling|alt=]]\n\n==Background and history==\n\n===Periodic and aperiodic tilings===\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1}}[[File:RegularRhombs.svg|right|thumb|150px|Figure 1.

In this approach, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.\n\n==Penrose tilings==\n[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1).svg|thumb|right|200px|A P1 tiling using Penrose's original set of six prototiles|alt=]]\n\nThe three types of Penrose tiling, P1&ndash;P3, are described individually below.<ref name=\"P1-P3\">The P1&ndash;P3 notation is taken from {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}</ref> They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the [[golden ratio]]), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by ''matching rules'' in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces &ndash; alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.<ref name=\"AMSa\" /><ref name=\"GS10.3\">{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}</ref>\n\n===Original pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1)===\nPenrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed \"star\" (a pentagram), a \"boat\" (roughly 3/5 of a star) and a \"diamond\" (a thin rhombus).<ref name=\"P:32\"/> To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.<ref>\"However, as will be explained momentarily, differently colored pentagons will be considered to be different types of tiles.\" {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}; {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=figure 10.3.1}}, shows the edge modifications needed to yield an aperiodic set of prototiles.</ref>\n\n===Kite and dart tiling (P2)===\n\n[[File:Step7wPaper600DPI.png|thumb|Part of the plane covered by Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2 (kite and dart). Created by applying several deflations, see section below.]]\n\nPenrose's second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the \"kite\" and \"dart\", which may be combined to make a rhombus. However, the matching rules prohibit such a combination.<ref>\"The rhombus of course tiles periodically, but we are not allowed to join the pieces in this manner.\" {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=6&ndash;7}}</ref> Both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles, called ''[[Golden triangle (mathematics)#Golden gnomon|Robinson triangles]]'', after 1975 notes by Robinson.<ref name=\"GS-R\">{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=537&ndash; 547}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Kite Dart.svg|image2=Penrose vertex figures.svg|width=225|footer=Kite and dart tiles (top) and the seven possible [[vertex figure]]s in a P2 tiling.}}\n\n*The ''kite'' is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72, 72, 72, and 144 degrees. The kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 72 and 72 degrees).\n*The ''dart'' is a non-convex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. The dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.\n\nThe matching rules can be described in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices.<ref name=\"S:173\">{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=173}}</ref> Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.<ref name=\"G:6\"/>\n\nThese rules often force the placement of certain tiles: for example, the [[concave polygon|concave]] vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites. The corresponding figure (center of the top row in the lower image on the left) is called an \"ace\" by Conway; although it looks like an enlarged kite, it does not tile in the same way.<ref name=\"G:8\">{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=8}}</ref> Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts (bottom right). In fact, there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex; two of these figures &ndash; namely, the \"star\" (top left) and the \"sun\" (top right) &ndash; have 5-fold [[dihedral symmetry]] (by rotations and reflections), while the remainder have a single axis of reflection (vertical in the image).<ref name=\"G:10=11\">{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=10&ndash;11}}</ref> Apart from the ace and the sun, all of these vertex figures force the placement of additional tiles.<ref name=\"G:12\">{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=12}}</ref>\n\n===Rhombus tiling (P3)===\n[[File:Penrose rhombs matching rules.svg|right|thumb|Matching rule for Penrose rhombs using circular arcs or edge modifications|alt=]]\nThe third tiling uses a pair of [[rhombus]]es (often referred to as \"[[wikt:rhomb|rhombs]]\" in this context) with equal sides but different angles.<ref name=\"AMSa\"/> Ordinary rhombus-shaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically, so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled: no two tiles may form a parallelogram, as this would allow a periodic tiling, but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity, as [[#Figure 1|figure 1 above]] shows.\n\nThere are two kinds of tile, both of which can be decomposed into Robinson triangles.<ref name=\"GS-R\"/>\n*The thin rhomb '''t''' has four corners with angles of 36, 144, 36, and 144 degrees. The '''t''' rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles.\n*The thick rhomb '''T''' has angles of 72, 108, 72, and 108 degrees. The '''T''' rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles; in contrast to the P2 tiling, these are larger than the acute triangles.\n\nThe matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.<ref name=\"AMSa\"/>\n\nThere are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex, but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (although one of these arises in two ways).<ref name=\"S:178\">{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=178}}</ref>\n\nThe various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles, such as the ''[http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/BKMM7xpc.htm Penrose chickens]''.\n\nTraditionally, the P3 Penrose tiling is made of thin and thick rhombi. However, by raising the vertices in three dimensions, it is possible to force all of the rhombi to be congruent. The resulting surface is known as a [[Wieringa roof]]. Due to similarities with three-dimensional [[quasicrystals]], you can see [[Rhombic triacontahedron]]s and [[Rhombic hexecontahedron]]s hidden in the tiling. <ref>{{cite web |title=Activities with golden rhombi |url=https://cp4space.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/activities-with-golden-rhombi/ |website=Complex Projective 4-Space}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Penrose Tilings and Wieringa Roofs |url=https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PenroseTilingsAndWieringaRoofs/ |website=WOLFRAM Demonstrations Project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Story of Spikey |url=https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2018/12/the-story-of-spikey/ |website=Stephen Wolfram Blog}}</ref>\n\n==Features and constructions==\n\n===Golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry===\nSeveral properties and common features of the Penrose tilings involve the [[golden ratio]] {{φ}} = (1+{{radic|5}})/2 (approximately 1.618).<ref name=\"GS-R\" /><ref name=\"S:173\"/> This is the ratio of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] lengths to side lengths in a [[regular pentagon]], and satisfies {{φ}} = 1 + 1/{{φ}}.\n\n[[File:Rhomb pentagon.svg|left|thumb|Pentagon with an inscribed thick rhomb (light), acute Robinson triangles (lightly shaded) and a small obtuse Robinson triangle (darker). Dotted lines give additional edges for inscribed kites and darts.|alt=]]\n\nConsequently, the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the ([[isosceles]]) Robinson triangles is {{φ}}:1. It follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also {{φ}}:1, as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb '''t''', and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb '''T'''. In both the P2 and P3 tilings, the ratio of the [[Triangle#Computing the area of a triangle|area]] of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is {{φ}}:1, hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart, and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb. (Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left: the larger triangles at the top &ndash; the halves of the thick rhomb &ndash; have linear dimensions scaled up by {{φ}} compared to the small shaded triangle at the base, and so the ratio of areas is {{φ}}<sup>2</sup>:1.)\n\nAny Penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry, in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold [[rotational symmetry]] about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of [[reflection symmetry]] passing through the point, a [[dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetry [[group (mathematics)|group]].<ref name=\"AMSa\"/> This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.<ref name=\"G:9\">{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry: if there were more than one, then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry, which leads to a mathematical contradiction.<ref name=\"G:27\">{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=27}}</ref> There are only two Penrose tilings (of each type) with global pentagonal symmetry: for the P2 tiling by kites and darts, the center point is either a \"sun\" or \"star\" vertex.<ref name=\"GS:543\">{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=543}}</ref>\n\n===Inflation and deflation===\n[[File:Pentagon with half dodecahedral net.svg|right|thumb|A pentagon decomposed into six smaller pentagons (half a dodecahedral net) with gaps|alt=]]\nMany of the common features of Penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by ''[[Substitution tiling|substitution rules]]'': this is often referred to as ''inflation'' and ''deflation'', or ''composition'' and ''decomposition'', of tilings or (collections of) tiles.<ref name=\"AMSa\"/><ref name=\"G1\"/><ref name=\"GS-Terms\">In {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}}, the term \"inflation\" is used where other authors would use \"deflation\" (followed by rescaling). The terms \"composition\" and \"decomposition\", which many authors also use, are less ambiguous.</ref> The substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling (and thus allow larger tiles to be \"composed\" from smaller ones). This shows that the Penrose tiling has a scaling self-similarity, and so can be thought of as a [[fractal]].<ref>Ramachandrarao P.,\n''On the fractal nature of Penrose tiling'', Current Science '''79'''(2000) p364 [http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/aug102000/rc80.pdf]</ref>\n\nPenrose originally discovered the P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one half of a [[Net (polyhedron)|net]] of a [[dodecahedron]]) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons.<ref name=\"P:32\">{{Harvnb|Penrose|1978|p=32}}</ref> By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.<ref name=\"AMSa\"/><ref name=\"S:171\"/>\n\n====Robinson triangle decompositions====\n[[File:Robinson triangle decompositions.svg|left|thumb|Robinson triangles and their decompositions|alt=]]\nThe substitution method for both P2 and P3 tilings can be described using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles.<ref name=\"GS-R\"/> The smaller A-tile, denoted A<sub>S</sub>, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, A<sub>L</sub>, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted B<sub>S</sub>, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, B<sub>L</sub>, is obtuse.\n\nConcretely, if A<sub>S</sub> has side lengths (1, 1, {{φ}}), then A<sub>L</sub> has side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, 1). B-tiles can be related to such A-tiles in two ways:\n* If B<sub>S</sub> has the same size as A<sub>L</sub> then B<sub>L</sub> is an enlarged version {{φ}}A<sub>S</sub> of A<sub>S</sub>, with side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, {{φ}}<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{φ}}) &ndash; this decomposes into an A<sub>L</sub> tile and A<sub>S</sub> tile joined along a common side of length 1.\n* If instead B<sub>L</sub> is identified with A<sub>S</sub>, then B<sub>S</sub> is a reduced version (1/{{φ}})A<sub>L</sub> of A<sub>L</sub> with side lengths (1/{{φ}},1/{{φ}},1) &ndash; joining a B<sub>S</sub> tile and a B<sub>L</sub> tile along a common side of length 1 then yields (a decomposition of) an A<sub>L</sub> tile.\n\nIn these decompositions, there appears to be an ambiguity: Robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways, which are mirror images of each other in the (isosceles) axis of symmetry of the triangle. In a Penrose tiling, this choice is fixed by the matching rules &ndash; furthermore, the matching rules ''also'' determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones.<ref name=\"GS-R\"/>\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Penrose tilings P2 and P3.svg|image2=Penrose tilings P3 and P2.svg|width=200|footer=Partial inflation of star to yield rhombs, and of a collection of rhombs to yield an ace.}}\nIt follows that the P2 and P3 tilings are ''mutually locally derivable'': a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another &ndash; for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A-tiles, and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B-tiles and hence rhombs.<ref name=\"S:173-174\"/> The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the P1 tiling (see [[#Figure 2|figure 2 above]]).<ref name=\"GS:546\">{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=546}}</ref>\n\nThe decomposition of B-tiles into A-tiles may be written\n: B<sub>S</sub> = A<sub>L</sub>, B<sub>L</sub> = A<sub>L</sub> + A<sub>S</sub>\n(assuming the larger size convention for the B-tiles), which can be summarized in a ''substitution [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'' equation:<ref name=\"S:157-158\">{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=157&ndash;158}}</ref>\n: <math>\\begin{pmatrix} B_L \\\\ B_S\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\\\ A_S \\end{pmatrix}\\, .</math>\nCombining this with the decomposition of enlarged {{φ}}A-tiles into B-tiles yields the substitution\n: <math>\\begin{pmatrix} \\varphi A_L \\\\ \\varphi A_S\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} B_L \\\\ B_S\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\\\ A_S \\end{pmatrix}\\, ,</math>\nso that the enlarged tile {{φ}}A<sub>L</sub> decomposes into two A<sub>L</sub> tiles and one A<sub>S</sub> tiles.

However, any bounded region, no matter how large, will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling. Therefore, no finite patch can uniquely determine a full Penrose tiling, nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown.<ref>\"... any finite patch that we choose in a tiling will lie inside a single inflated tile if we continue moving far enough up in the inflation hierarchy. This means that anywhere that tile occurs at that level in the hierarchy, our original patch must also occur in the original tiling. Therefore, the patch will occur infinitely often in the original tiling and, in fact, in every other tiling as well.\" {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}</ref>\n\nThis shows in particular that the number of distinct Penrose tilings (of any type) is [[uncountably infinite]]. Up-down generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings, but other methods use Ammann bars, pentagrids, or cut and project schemes.<ref name=\"AMSb\"/>\n\n==Related tilings and topics==\n\n===Decagonal coverings and quasicrystals===\n[[File:Gummelt decagon.svg|300px|thumb|right|Gummelt's decagon (left) with the decomposition into kites and darts indicated by dashed lines; the thicker darker lines bound an inscribed ace and thick rhomb; possible overlaps (right) are by one or two red aces.<ref name=\"LR\">{{Harvnb|Lord|Ranganathan|2001}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nIn 1996, German mathematician Petra Gummelt demonstrated that a covering (so called to distinguish it from a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gummelt|1996}}</ref> The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.\n\nThese coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of [[quasicrystals]]: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the [[unit cell]]s from which crystals are constructed, and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.<ref name=\"LR\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Steinhardt|Jeong|1996}}; see also {{cite web|first=Paul J.|last=Steinhardt|title=A New Paradigm for the Structure of Quasicrystals|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/quasi/}}</ref>\n\n===Related tilings===\n[[File:Tie and Navette Tiling.png|300px|left|thumb|Tie and Navette tiling (in red on a Penrose background)]]\nThe three variants of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If the corners of one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by ''1,3,5,2,4'' an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.\nPoints with the same label define a tiling by Robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a Tie-and-Navette tiling.<ref>Luck R., \"Penrose Sublattices\", ''Journal of Non Crystalline Solids'' 117-8 (90)832-5</ref>\n\nThere are also other related unequivalent tilings, such as the hexagon-boat-star and Mikulla&ndash;Roth tilings.

In the project, the tiling pattern is used to create the structural sub-framing for the facades, allowing for the facades to be fabricated off-site, in a factory and later erected to form the facades.  The pinwheel tiling system was based on the single triangular element, composed of zinc, perforated zinc, sandstone or glass (known as a tile), which was joined to 4 other similar tiles on an aluminum frame, to form a \"panel\".  Five panels were affixed to a galvanized steel frame, forming a \"mega-panel\", which were then hoisted onto support frames for the facade.  The rotational positioning of the tiles gives the facades a more random, uncertain compositional quality, even though the process of its construction is based on pre-fabrication and repetition.  The same pinwheel tiling system is used in the development of the structural frame and glazing for the \"Atrium\" at Federation Square, although in this instance, the pin-wheel grid has been made \"3-dimensional\" to form a portal frame structure.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/pinwheel/ Pinwheel] at the Tilings Encyclopedia\n* [http://tube.geogebra.org/m/2199659 Dynamic Pinwheel] made in [http://www.geogebra.org GeoGebra]\n{{Tessellation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pinwheel Tiling}}\n[[Category:Discrete geometry]]\n[[Category:Aperiodic tilings]]"

They are modelled visually by square tiles with a color on each side. A set of such tiles is selected, and copies of the tiles are arranged side by side with matching colors, ''without'' rotating or reflecting them.\n\nThe basic question about a set of Wang tiles is whether it can [[tessellation|tile]] the plane or not, i.e., whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way. The next question is whether this can be done in a periodic pattern.\n\n==Domino problem==\n[[Image:Wang tesselation.svg|thumb|400px|Example of Wang tessellation with 13 tiles.]]\nIn 1961, Wang conjectured that if a finite set of Wang tiles can tile the plane, then there exists also a [[tessellation|''periodic'' tiling]], i.e., a tiling that is invariant under translations by vectors in a 2-dimensional lattice, like a wallpaper pattern.  He also observed that this conjecture would imply the existence of an algorithm to decide whether a given finite set of Wang tiles can tile the plane.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Wang | first = Hao | author-link = Hao Wang (academic)\n | issue = 1\n | journal = [[Bell System Technical Journal]]\n | pages = 1–41\n | title = Proving theorems by pattern recognition—II\n | volume = 40\n | year = 1961\n | doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb03975.x}}.

It consists of deciding, for each domino set, whether or not it is solvable. We say that the Domino Problem is ''decidable'' or ''undecidable'' according to whether there exists or does not exist an algorithm which, given the specifications of an arbitrary domino set, will decide whether or not the set is solvable.\n</blockquote>\nIn other words, the domino problem asks whether there is an [[effective procedure]] that correctly settles the problem for all given domino sets.\n\nIn 1966, Wang's student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] solved the domino problem in the negative. He proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any [[Turing machine]] into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt.  The undecidability of the [[halting problem]] (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang's tiling problem.<ref name=\"berger\">{{citation\n | last = Berger | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Berger (mathematician)\n | journal = Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0216954\n | page = 72\n | title = The undecidability of the domino problem\n | volume = 66\n | year = 1966}}.  Berger coins the term \"Wang tiles\", and demonstrates the first aperiodic set of them.</ref>\n\n==Aperiodic sets of tiles==\nCombining Berger's undecidability result with Wang's observation shows that there must exist a finite set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane, but only ''[[aperiodic tiling|aperiodically]]''.  This is similar to a [[Penrose tiling]], or the arrangement of atoms in a [[quasicrystal]].  Although Berger's original set contained 20,426 tiles, he conjectured that smaller sets would work, including subsets of his set, and in his unpublished Ph.D. thesis, he reduced the number of tiles to 104.

There are three triangles and two squares on each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. It is named as a [[triangular tiling]] [[elongation (geometry)|elongated]] by rows of squares, and given [[Schläfli symbol]] {3,6}:e.\n\n[[John Horton Conway|Conway]] calls it a '''isosnub quadrille'''.<ref name=\"Conway, 2008, p.288 table\">Conway, 2008, p.288 table</ref>\n\nThere are 3 [[List of regular polytopes#Euclidean tilings|regular]] and 8 [[List of uniform tilings|semiregular tilings]] in the plane. This tiling is similar to the [[snub square tiling]] which also has 3 triangles and two squares on a vertex, but in a different order.\n\n== Construction==\nIt is also the only convex [[uniform tiling]] that can't be created as a [[Wythoff construction]]. It can be constructed as alternate layers of [[apeirogonal prism]]s and [[apeirogonal antiprism]]s.\n\n== Uniform colorings ==\n\nThere is one [[uniform coloring]]s of an elongated triangular tiling. Two 2-uniform colorings have a single vertex figure, 11123, with two colors of squares, but are not 1-uniform, repeated either by reflection or glide reflection, or in general each row of squares can be shifted around independently. The 2-uniform tilings are also called [[Archimedean coloring]]s. There are infinite variations of these Archimedean colorings by arbitrary shifts in the square row colorings.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!11122 (1-uniform)\n!colspan=2|11123 (2-uniform or 1-Archimedean)\n|-\n|[[File:Elongated triangular tiling 1.png|150px]] \n|[[File:Elongated triangular tiling 3.png|150px]] \n|[[File:Elongated triangular tiling 2.png|150px]]\n|- align=center\n|cmm (2*22)\n|pmg (22*)\n|pgg (22×)\n|}\n\n== Circle packing ==\nThe elongated triangular tiling can be used as a [[circle packing]], placing equal diameter circles at the center of every point.

      "text": "{{More footnotes|date=March 2011}}\n{{Uniform tiles db|Reg tiling stat table|Uh}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''hexagonal tiling''' or '''hexagonal tessellation''' is a [[regular tiling]] of the [[Euclidean plane]], in which three [[hexagon]]s meet at each vertex. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] of {6,3} or ''t''{3,6} (as a truncated triangular tiling).\n\nEnglish mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] calls it a '''hextille'''.\n\nThe internal angle of the hexagon is 120 degrees so three hexagons at a point make a full 360 degrees. It is one of [[List of regular polytopes#Euclidean tilings|three regular tilings of the plane]]. The other two are the [[triangular tiling]] and the [[square tiling]].\n\n== Applications ==\nThe hexagonal tiling is the densest way to [[sphere packing|arrange circles]] in two dimensions. The [[Honeycomb conjecture]] states that the hexagonal tiling is the best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter. The optimal three-dimensional structure for making honeycomb (or rather, soap bubbles) was investigated by [[Lord Kelvin]], who believed that the [[Kelvin structure]] (or [[body-centered cubic]] lattice) is optimal. However, the less regular [[Weaire–Phelan structure]] is slightly better.\n\nThis structure exists naturally in the form of [[graphite]], where each sheet of [[graphene]] resembles chicken wire, with strong covalent carbon bonds. Tubular graphene sheets have been synthesised; these are known as [[carbon nanotube]]s. They have many potential applications, due to their high [[tensile strength]] and electrical properties. [[Silicene]] is similar.\n\n[[Chicken wire]] consists of a hexagonal lattice (often not regular) of wires.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kissing-2d.svg |The densest [[circle packing]] is arranged like the hexagons in this tiling\nFile:Chicken Wire close-up.jpg |[[Chicken wire]] fencing\nFile:Graphene xyz.jpg |[[Graphene]]\nFile:Carbon nanotube zigzag povray.PNG |A [[carbon nanotube]] can be seen as a hexagon tiling on a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] surface\n</gallery>\n\nThe hexagonal tiling appears in many crystals. In three dimensions, the [[face-centered cubic]] and [[hexagonal close packing]] are common crystal structures. They are the densest known sphere packings in three dimensions, and are believed to be optimal. Structurally, they comprise parallel layers of hexagonal tilings, similar to the structure of graphite. They differ in the way that the layers are staggered from each other, with the face-centered cubic being the more regular of the two. Pure [[copper]], amongst other materials, forms a face-centered cubic lattice.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Uniform colorings ==\nThere are three distinct [[uniform coloring]]s of a hexagonal tiling, all generated from reflective symmetry of [[Wythoff construction]]s. The (''h'',''k'') represent the periodic repeat of one colored tile, counting hexagonal distances as ''h'' first, and ''k'' second. The same counting is used in the [[Goldberg polyhedra]], with a notation {''p''+,3}<sub>''h'',''k''</sub>, and can be applied to hyperbolic tilings for ''p''>6.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=640\n!k-uniform\n!colspan=3|1-uniform\n!colspan=2|2-uniform\n!colspan=2|3-uniform\n|- align=center\n![[List of planar symmetry groups|Symmetry]]\n|colspan=2|p6m, (*632)\n| p3m1, (*333)\n|colspan=2|p6m, (*632)\n|colspan=2|p6, (632)\n|-\n!Picture\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 63-t0.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 63-t12.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 333-t012.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Truncated rhombille tiling.png|100px]]\n|[[File:Hexagonal tiling 4-colors.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Hexagonal tiling 2-1.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Hexagonal tiling 7-colors.svg|100px]]\n|- align=center\n!Colors\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!2\n!4\n!2\n!7\n|- align=center\n!(h,k)\n|(1,0)\n|colspan=2|(1,1)\n|colspan=2|(2,0)\n|colspan=2|(2,1)\n|- align=center\n![[Schläfli symbol|Schläfli]]\n|{6,3}\n|t{3,6}\n|t{3<sup>[3]</sup>}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|- align=center\n![[Wythoff symbol|Wythoff]]\n| 3 &#124; 6 2\n| 2 6 &#124; 3\n| 3 3 3 &#124;\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|- align=center\n![[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram|Coxeter]]\n|{{CDD|node_1|6|node|3|node}}\n|{{CDD|node_1|3|node_1|6|node}}\n|{{CDD|node_1|split1|branch_11}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|- align=center\n![[Conway polyhedron notation|Conway]]\n|H\n|tΔ\n|\n|cH\n|\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n\nThe 3-color tiling is a tessellation generated by the order-3 [[permutohedron]]s.\n\n=== Chamfered hexagonal tiling===\n\nA [[Chamfer (geometry)|chamfer]]red hexagonal tiling replacing edges with new hexagons and transforms into another hexagonal tiling.

The semiregular tilings form new tilings from their duals, each made from one type of irregular face.\n\n[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] calls these uniform duals '''''Catalan tilings''''', in parallel to the [[Catalan solid]] polyhedra.\n\nUniform tilings are listed by their [[vertex configuration]], the sequence of faces that exist on each vertex. For example ''4.8.8'' means one square and two octagons on a vertex.\n\nThese 11 uniform tilings have 32 different ''[[uniform coloring]]s''. A uniform coloring allows identical sided polygons at a vertex to be colored differently, while still maintaining vertex-uniformity and transformational congruence between vertices. (Note: Some of the tiling images shown below are ''not'' color-uniform)\n\nIn addition to the 11 convex uniform tilings, there are also [[Uniform tiling#Expanded lists of uniform tilings|14 nonconvex tilings]], using [[star polygon]]s, and reverse orientation vertex configurations.\n\n== Laves tilings==\nIn the 1987 book, ''Tilings and Patterns'', [[Branko Grünbaum]] calls the vertex-uniform tilings ''Archimedean'' in parallel to the [[Archimedean solid]]s.

Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.\n\n==Topology and symmetry==\nThe Pythagorean tiling is the unique tiling by squares of two different sizes that is both ''unilateral'' (no two squares have a common side) and ''equitransitive'' (each two squares of the same size can be mapped into each other by a symmetry of the tiling).<ref name=\"mms\">{{citation\n | last1 = Martini | first1 = Horst\n | last2 = Makai | first2 = Endre\n | last3 = Soltan | first3 = Valeriu\n | issue = 2\n | journal = Beiträge zur Algebra und Geometrie\n | mr = 1642720\n | pages = 481–495\n | title = Unilateral tilings of the plane with squares of three sizes\n | url = http://www.emis.de/journals/BAG/vol.39/no.2/b39h2mar.ps.gz\n | volume = 39\n | year = 1998}}.</ref>\n\nTopologically, the Pythagorean tiling has the same structure as the [[truncated square tiling]] by squares and regular [[octagon]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Grünbaum | first1 = Branko | author1-link = Branko Grünbaum\n | last2 = Shephard | first2 = G.

However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this can be explained by saying that the truncated square tiling has [[dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetry around the center of each tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller [[cyclic group|cyclic]] set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it [[Wallpaper group#Group p4|p4 symmetry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}}, p. 42.</ref> It is a [[chiral]] pattern, meaning that it is impossible to superpose it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations.\n\nA [[uniform tiling]] is a tiling in which each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a symmetry of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}}, pp. 73–74.</ref>\n\n==Pythagorean theorem and dissections==\n[[File:Pythagorean dissections.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The five-piece dissections used in the proofs by [[Al-Nayrizi]] and [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (left) and by [[Henry Perigal]] (right)]]\nThis tiling is called the Pythagorean tiling because it has been used as the basis of proofs of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] by the ninth-century Islamic mathematicians [[Al-Nayrizi]] and [[Thābit ibn Qurra]], and by the 19th-century British amateur mathematician [[Henry Perigal]].<ref name=\"rbn\">{{citation|title=Paintings, plane tilings, and proofs|first=Roger B.|last=Nelsen|journal=Math Horizons|date=November 2003|pages=5–8|url=http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Publications/Books/CSMC/New%20Problems/paintings.pdf}}.

Then, one chooses a line parallel to the sides of the squares, and forms a sequence of binary values from the sizes of the squares crossed by the line: a 0 corresponds to a crossing of a large square and a 1 corresponds to a crossing of a small square. In this sequence, the relative proportion of 0s and 1s will be in the ratio ''x'':1. This proportion cannot be achieved by a periodic sequence of 0s and 1s, because it is irrational, so the sequence is aperiodic.<ref name=\"cq\"/>\n\nIf ''x'' is chosen as the [[golden ratio]], the sequence of 0s and 1s generated in this way has the same recursive structure as the [[Fibonacci word]]: it can be split into substrings of the form \"01\" and \"0\" (that is, there are no two consecutive ones) and if these two substrings are consistently replaced by the shorter strings \"0\" and \"1\" then another string with the same structure results.<ref name=\"cq\"/>\n\n==Related results==\nAccording to [[Keller's conjecture]], any tiling of the plane by congruent squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge.<ref>The truth of his conjecture for two-dimensional tilings was known already to Keller, but it was since proven false for dimensions eight and above.

(Alternately it can be seen as a bisected [[triangular tiling]] divided into 6 triangles, or as an infinite [[arrangement of lines]] in six parallel families.)\n\nIt is labeled V4.6.12 because each right triangle face has three types of vertices: one with 4 triangles, one with 6 triangles, and one with 12 triangles.\n\n{{Clear}}\n=== Symmetry===\nThe ''kisrhombille tiling'' triangles represent the fundamental domains of p6m, [6,3] (*632 [[orbifold notation]]) [[wallpaper group]] symmetry.

The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of [[girih tiles]] with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as [[stencil|templates]], and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way.\n\nThe 15th century [[Topkapı Scroll]] explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic [[Penrose tiling]]s, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; plasterwork, as at [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s such as Hunat Hatun, [[Kayseri]]; metal, as at [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo]]; and in wood, as at the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Bosra mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|2nd century Roman mosaic in [[Bosra]] with curvilinear knot patterns]]\n\nThe girih style of ornamentation is thought to have been inspired by 2nd century AD [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns.<ref name=\"iranica\">{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=2013-01-01| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}</ref> These had curvilinear interlaced strapwork with three-fold rotational symmetry.

The details of the pattern indicate that girih tiles, rather than compass and straightedge, were used for decorating the shrine. The patterns appear [[aperiodic]]; within the area on the wall where they are displayed, they do not form a regularly repeating pattern; and they are drawn at two different scales. A large-scale pattern is discernible when the building is viewed from a distance, and a smaller-scale pattern forming part of the larger one can be seen from closer up.<ref name=\"Lu and Steinhardt\"/>\n\nAlthough there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]] to draw a two-level pattern, there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times. For example, the pattern used in the spandrel of the Darb-i Imam shrine (see figure) consists only of decagons and bowties, while the subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes. Therefore, this design lacks self-similarity between the two levels.<ref name=\"Lu and Steinhardt\"/>{{-}}\n\n====Aperiodicity====\nA periodic tiling of the plane is the regular repetition of a \"unit cell\", in the manner of a wallpaper, without any gaps. Such tilings can be seen as a two-dimensional crystal, and because of the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is therefore impossible to tile the plane periodically with a figure that has five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These [[quasi-crystalline tiling]]s contain shapes with five-fold symmetry that repeat periodically, in between other shapes that do not repeat.<ref name=\"Lu and Steinhardt\"/>\n\nOne way to create quasi-periodic patterns is to create a [[Penrose tiling]]. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called \"dart\" and \"kite\", but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans.<ref name=\"Lu and Steinhardt\"/> Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two-level design. There would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design, as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues,<ref name=Makovicky>{{cite journal| author=Emil Makovicky| title=Comment on \"Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture\" | journal=Science | volume=318 | issue=5855 | pages=1383a |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1383.1.full | accessdate=2012-02-22| doi=10.1126/science.1146262 | pmid=18048668 | year=2007 }}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns.

The drawings in this pattern book show the girih lines superimposed on the tiles used to generate the pattern, making the construction fully evident.<ref name=\"Lu and Steinhardt\"/>\n\n===Templates===\nOnce a repeating pattern has been constructed, regardless of the method used, the pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it, like the pattern of a wallpaper, as a paper [[stencil|template]]. The pattern can then simply be pricked through on to the surface to be decorated. The Topkapı Scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates.<ref name=Necipoglu/><!--p47--> The ''Anonymous Compendium'' contains square repeat units for many girih patterns.<ref name=Necipoglu/><!--p42--> Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari's ''Compendium of Science and Useful Practice in the Mechanical Arts'' contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors.<ref name=Necipoglu/><!--p44-->\n\n==Girih in varied materials==\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Salim Chishti Tomb-2.jpg|Girih stone screens at the [[tomb of Salim Chishti]], [[Fatehpur Sikri]], 16th century\nFile:Kayseri Hunat Hatun Complex3-Verity Cridland.jpg|Girih in plasterwork of Iwan of Hunat Hatun medersa, [[Kayseri]]\nFile:Flickr - HuTect ShOts - Pattern of The Tomb Gate - Masjid of Sultan Hassan مسجد ومدرسة السلطان حسن - Cairo - Egypt - 28 05 2010.jpg|Girih in metal: 12-pointed star on gate at [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hassan's mosque, Cairo]]\nFile:Lacería.jpg|Girih in wood: grille in the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Girih on various surfaces ==\n\n=== Girih on windows ===\n[[File:Colorful window, Dowlat Abad Garden - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Colourful window of Dowlad Abad Garden]]\nGirih has been widely applied on the architecture. The patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]], as the ornateness of windows indicated the social and economic status of the owner. A good example is Azad Koliji, a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer is the actual garden which people can see when they open the window. And the second layer is the artificial garden as the girih patterns are on the outside of the window is the carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden. The multi-colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. The artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window and gives the audience enough space of imagination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koliji|first=Hooman|date=2015|title=Built on Light: The 'Crafty' Art of Geometric Patterned Windows|journal=International Journal of Islamic Architecture|volume=4|pages=75–108|doi=10.1386/ijia.4.1.75_1}}</ref>\n=== Girih on domes ===\n[[File:Nasr ol Molk mosque vault ceiling.jpg|thumb|Nasr ol Molk mosque vault ceiling]]\nIn addition to plain platforms like the windows, girih patterns on the domes are very popular as well. However, due to the curve shapes of the domes, they need special techniques. One of the most important techniques is called “Dast-Garden” method. This method refers to that the number of star polygons applied to the pattern are highly dependent on the change of the dome curvature. Decreasing the curvature of a dome surface leads to the decreasing of the number of points on a star polygon. Thus, the shapes of the girih pattern are heavily relying on the dome.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohammad|first=Kasraei|date=2016|title=Girih for Domes: Analysis of Three Iranian Domes|journal=Nexus Network Journal|volume=18|pages=311–321|doi=10.1007/s00004-015-0282-4}}</ref> The same method can be applied to other surfaces, even irregular surface.\n\n=== Girih on walls  ===\n[[File:Dome Jame Mosque Yazd.jpg|thumb|Dome of Jams Mosque Yazd]]Girih patterns are very likely to be all over the walls of some [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectures]].

Among all these patterns, a special technique is shared: \"self-similar transformation\".

The differences in the border of some drawings indicate that the Topkapı Scroll consists of two different scrolls fixed together. The fact that it is not worn out suggests that it was not made to be used as a reference document in a craftman's workshop, but rather than as an exhibition work in the palace. It was probably a record of tiling works carried out in the palace.<ref name=\"rogers\">{{cite journal |title= Notes on a recent study of the Topkapı scroll: a review article |author=Rogers, J.M. |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=433–439 |year=1997 |jstor=619536 |doi=10.1017/s0041977x0003247x}}</ref>\n\nThe scroll was made by one person only. Most of the patterns were drawn on two pieces of parchment that were put together, and then pasted on the scroll. The placement of the patterns on the scroll is somewhat disorganized. Patterns of similar [[theme (arts)|theme]]s are fallen apart, and some patterns formed on two parchment pieces are combined imperfectly.<ref name=\"rogers\"/>\n\nThe stamp on the scroll \"H1956\" indicates that it is registered in the inventory of the Topkapı Palace's Treasury department.\n\nAn edition of the scroll was published with an extensive commentary, but it is now out of print.\n\n==History==\nThe Topkapı Scroll was presumably prepared in Iran during the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the end of the 15th century or beginning of the 16th century. A similarity between some of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll and a tile panel in the [[Jame-e Kabir Mosque]] (grand mosque) in [[Yazd]] indicates that this scroll was created in [[Tabriz]]. On the other hand, it is possible that the scroll was made in [[Shiraz]] because it consists of mainly [[muqarnas]] in the form of a hand-held fan referred by [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] as Shirazi. It may have been looted \nby the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s after the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)]].\n\nThe muqarnas on the scroll, which are mostly in the form of a hand-held fan, reflect the architectural style of the Timurid dynasty, [[Turkmen people#Turkmen in Iran and Afghanistan|Turkmen people in Iran and Central Asia]]. In contrast, the muqarnas in [[Cairo]] are in the form of [[seashell]].\n\nThe Topkapı Scroll was discovered in 1986. [[Gülru Necipoğlu]] of [[Harvard University]] published a book, which describes the scroll with copies of its patterns.<ref>Gülru Necipoglu: The Topkapı Scroll: geometry and ornament in Islamic architecture. Palace Museum Topkapı Library MS H. 1956. xiii, 395 pp. Santa Monica, CA: Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, 1995</ref> The book was translated into [[Persian language]] by Mihrdad Kayyumi Bidhind under the title ''Handasa va Tazyin dar Mi‘mari-yi Islami: Tomar-i Topkapı'' (Tahran, Kitabkhana-yi Milli-yi Iran, 1379).\n\n==Content==\n[[File:Topkapi Scroll P290.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Quarter dome muqarnas - in the form of a seashell (top), in the form of a radial, hand-held fan (bottom)]]\n\nThe scroll consists of 114 geometric patterns drawn in ink and dye. It displays decorative ornaments found on the walls and domes of structures built between the  10th and 16th century in the Timurid dynasty. It was a guidebook for architectural designs seen in complex [[muqarnas]], [[girih]], mosaic panels and colorful tiles. The scroll does not mention how those patterns are constructed, and has no date or signature.<ref name=\"necipoglu1\"/>\n\nThe two-dimensional figures make it unclear how they can be employed to three-dimensional ornamental objects.<ref>Artisans and Mathematicians in Medieval Islam.

This script type was seen for the first time in the state of [[Ilkhanate]], and it was presumably created in inspiration from [[Chinese character]]s in rectangular form.<ref name=\"rogers\"/> One of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll, which matches an existing architectural structure, is the Kufic script drawn for [[banna'i]], in which tiles are alternated with plain bricks to create geometric patterns over the surface of a wall.  Almost exactly the same of this pattern is found on the gate of a mosque in [[Varzaneh]].<ref name=\"necipoglu1\"/>\n\n[[File:Topkapi Scroll P325.JPG|thumb|250px|Hexagon with Kufic scripts of six time [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) and three time [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) in rotational symmetry]]\nSome of the patterns show the application of geometric principles to Islamic traditions. For example, the word [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) is repeated six times along the sides of the [[hexagon]], and the word [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) three times in a rotating wise in the inner hexagon.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hacali Necefoğlu |title=Turkish Crystallografic Patterns: From Ancient to Present |url=http://www.crystallography.fr/mathcryst/pdf/istanbul/Necefoglu_text.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nOne pattern on the scroll consists of nine-pointed and eleven-pointed geometric [[star polygon#Star figures|star figures]], and other one thirteen-pointed and sixteen-pointed geometric star figures.

Four [[5-cube]]s meet at each cubic cell, and it is more explicitly called an ''order-4 penteractic honeycomb''.\n\nIt is analogous to the [[square tiling]] of the plane and to the [[cubic honeycomb]] of 3-space, and the [[tesseractic honeycomb]] of 4-space.\n\n== Constructions ==\nThere are many different [[Wythoff construction]]s of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is [[Regular polytope|regular]], with [[Schläfli symbol]] {4,3<sup>3</sup>,4}. Another form has two alternating [[5-cube]] facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3,3<sup>1,1</sup>}. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 32 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞}<sup>5</sup>.\n\n== Related polytopes and honeycombs ==\nThe [4,3<sup>3</sup>,4], {{CDD|node|4|node|3|node|3|node|3|node|4|node}}, Coxeter group generates 63 permutations of uniform tessellations, 35 with unique symmetry and 34 with unique geometry. The [[Expansion (geometry)|expanded]] 5-cubic honeycomb is geometrically identical to the 5-cubic honeycomb.\n\nThe ''5-cubic honeycomb'' can be [[Alternation (geometry)|alternated]] into the [[5-demicubic honeycomb]], replacing the 5-cubes with [[5-demicube]]s, and the alternated gaps are filled by [[5-orthoplex]] facets.\n\nIt is also related to the regular [[6-cube]] which exists in 6-space with ''3'' ''5''-cubes on each cell. This could be considered as a tessellation on the [[N-sphere|5-sphere]], an ''order-3 penteractic honeycomb'', {4,3<sup>4</sup>}.\n\n=== Tritruncated 5-cubic honeycomb ===\nA '''tritruncated 5-cubic honeycomb''', {{CDD|branch_11|3ab|nodes|4a4b|nodes}}, contains all [[bitruncated 5-orthoplex]] facets and is the [[Voronoi tessellation]] of the [[5-demicube honeycomb#D5 lattice|D<sub>5</sub><sup>*</sup> lattice]]. Facets can be identically colored from a doubled <math>{\\tilde{C}}_5</math>×2, <nowiki>[[</nowiki>4,3<sup>3</sup>,4]] symmetry, alternately colored from <math>{\\tilde{C}}_5</math>, [4,3<sup>3</sup>,4] symmetry, three colors from <math>{\\tilde{B}}_5</math>, [4,3,3,3<sup>1,1</sup>] symmetry, and 4 colors from <math>{\\tilde{D}}_5</math>, [3<sup>1,1</sup>,3,3<sup>1,1</sup>] symmetry.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of regular polytopes]]\n\nRegular and uniform honeycombs in 5-space:\n*[[5-demicubic honeycomb]]\n*[[5-simplex honeycomb]]\n*[[Truncated 5-simplex honeycomb]]\n*[[Omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb]]\n\n== References ==\n* [[Coxeter|Coxeter, H.S.M.]] ''[[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]'', (3rd edition, 1973), Dover edition, {{ISBN|0-486-61480-8}} p.&nbsp;296, Table II: Regular honeycombs\n* '''Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings of [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.
