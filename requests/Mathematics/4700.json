The number of balls in the pyramid can be calculated as the fifth square pyramidal number, 55.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''pyramid number''', or '''square pyramidal number''', is a [[figurate number]] that represents the number of stacked spheres in a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] with a square base. Square pyramidal numbers also solve the problem of counting the number of squares in an {{math|''n'' &times; ''n''}} grid.\n\n==Formula==\nThe first few square pyramidal numbers are:\n\n:{{math|[[1 (number)|1]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[14 (number)|14]], [[30 (number)|30]], [[55 (number)|55]], [[91 (number)|91]], [[140 (number)|140]],}} {{math|[[204 (number)|204]], [[280 (number)#285|285]], [[300 (number)#385|385]], 506, 650, 819}}, ... {{OEIS|id=A000330}}.\n\nThese numbers can be expressed in a formula as\n:<math>P_n = \\sum_{k=1}^nk^2 = \\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} = \\frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6} = \\frac{n^3}{3} + \\frac{n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{6}.</math>\nThis is a special case of [[Faulhaber's formula]], and may be proved by a [[mathematical induction]].<ref>Hopcroft, Motwani & Ullman (2007), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=6ytHAQAAIAAJ|page=20|text=principle to prove}} p. 20]</ref> An equivalent formula is given in [[Fibonacci]]'s [[Liber Abaci]] (1202, ch. II.12).\n\nIn modern mathematics, figurate numbers are formalized by the [[Ehrhart polynomial]]s. The Ehrhart polynomial {{math|''L''(''P'',''t'')}} of a polyhedron {{mvar|P}} is a [[polynomial]] that counts the number of integer points in a copy of {{mvar|P}} that is expanded by multiplying all its coordinates by the number {{mvar|t}}. The Ehrhart polynomial of a pyramid whose base is a unit square with integer coordinates, and whose apex is an integer point at height one above the base plane, is {{math|1=(''t'' + 1)(''t'' + 2)(2''t'' + 3)/6 = ''P''<sub>''t'' + 1</sub>}}.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Beck | first1 = M.\n | last2 = De Loera | first2 = J.

Offsetting the larger and adding, we arrive at <math>1,1+3,3+6\\dots</math>, the square numbers.\n\nIn this sum, one of the two tetrahedral numbers counts the number of balls in a stacked pyramid that are directly above or to one side of a diagonal of the base square, and the other tetrahedral number in the sum counts the number of balls that are to the other side of the diagonal. Square pyramidal numbers are also related to tetrahedral numbers in a different way:\n:<math>P_n=\\frac14\\binom{2n+2}{3}.</math>\n\nThe sum of two consecutive square pyramidal numbers is an [[octahedral number]].\n\nAugmenting a pyramid whose base edge has {{mvar|n}} balls by adding to one of its triangular faces a [[tetrahedron]] whose base edge has {{math|''n'' &minus; 1}} balls produces a [[triangular prism]]. Equivalently, a pyramid can be expressed as the result of subtracting a tetrahedron from a prism. This geometric dissection leads to another relation:\n:<math>P_n = n\\binom{n+1}{2}-\\binom{n+1}{3}.</math>\n\nThe [[cannonball problem]] asks which numbers are both square and square pyramidal.\nBesides {{math|1}}, there is only one other number that has this property: {{math|4900}}, which is both the {{math|70}}th square number and the {{math|24}}th square pyramidal number. This fact was proven by [[G. N. Watson]] in 1918.\n\nAnother relationship involves the Pascal Triangle: Whereas the classical Pascal Triangle with sides {{math|(1,1)}} has diagonals with the natural numbers, triangular numbers, and tetrahedral numbers, generating the Fibonacci numbers as sums of samplings across diagonals, the sister Pascal with sides {{math|(2,1)}} has equivalent diagonals with odd numbers, square numbers, and square pyramidal numbers, respectively, and generates (by the same procedure) the Lucas numbers rather than Fibonacci.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the same way that the square pyramidal numbers can be defined as a sum of consecutive squares, the [[squared triangular number]]s can be defined as a sum of consecutive cubes.\n\nAlso,\n\n:<math>P_n = \\binom{n+3}{4}-\\binom{n+1}{4}</math>\n\nwhich is the difference of two [[pentatope number|pentatope numbers]].\n\nThis can be seen by expanding:\n\n:<math>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)-(n-2)(n-1)n(n+1)=n(n+1)(n^2+5n+6-n^2+3n-2)=n(n+1)(8n+4)</math>\n\nand dividing through by <math>24</math>.\n\n==Squares in a square==\n[[File:Squares in a square grid.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|A 5 by 5 square grid, with three of its 55 squares highlighted.]]\nA common [[mathematical puzzle]] involves finding the number of squares in a large {{mvar|n}} by {{mvar|n}} square grid. This number can be derived as follows:\n*The number of {{math|1 &times; 1}} boxes found in the grid is {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n*The number of {{math|2 &times; 2}} boxes found in the grid is {{math|(''n'' &minus; 1)<sup>2</sup>}}. These can be counted by counting all of the possible upper-left corners of {{math|2 &times; 2}} boxes.\n*The number of {{math|''k'' &times; ''k''}} boxes {{math|(1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'')}} found in the grid is {{math|(''n'' &minus; ''k'' + 1)<sup>2</sup>}}. These can be counted by counting all of the possible upper-left corners of {{math|''k'' &times; ''k''}} boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of squares in an {{math|''n'' &times; ''n''}} square grid is:\n:<math>n^2 + (n-1)^2 + (n-2)^2 + (n-3)^2 + \\ldots + 1^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.</math>\nThat is, the solution to the puzzle is given by the square pyramidal numbers.\n\nThe number of rectangles in a square grid is given by the [[squared triangular number]]s.\n\n==Derivation of the summation formula==\n\nThe difference of two consecutive square numbers is always an odd number. More precisely, because of the identity {{math|1=''k''<sup>2</sup> &minus; (''k'' &minus; 1)<sup>2</sup> = 2''k'' &minus; 1}}, the difference between the {{mvar|k}}th and the {{math|(''k'' &minus; 1)}}th square number is {{math|2''k'' &minus; 1}}. This yields the following scheme:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{ccccccccccccccc}\n0&&1&& 4 && 9 && 16 && 25 &\\ldots & (n-1)^2 && n^2 \\\\ \n&1&&3&& 5 &&7 &&9 && \\ldots && 2n-1 & \n\\end{array} \n</math>\n\nHence any square number can be written as a sum of odd numbers, that is <math>n^2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}2i-1</math>. This representation of square numbers can be used to express the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} square numbers by odd numbers arranged in a triangle with the sum of all numbers in the triangle being equal to the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} square numbers:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rcccccccc}\n\\scriptstyle 1^2 \\scriptstyle = &1&&&&&&& \\\\ \n\\scriptstyle 2^2\\scriptstyle = &1&3&&&&&&\\\\\n\\scriptstyle 3^2\\scriptstyle = &1&3&5&&&&&\\\\\n\\scriptstyle 4^2\\scriptstyle = &1&3&5&7&&&&\\\\  \n\\scriptstyle 5^2\\scriptstyle = &1&3&5&7&9&&&\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&&&&&\\ddots&&\\\\\n\\scriptstyle (n-1)^2\\scriptstyle = &1&\\cdots&&&&\\cdots&\\scriptstyle 2n-3& \\\\\n\\scriptstyle n^2\\scriptstyle = &1&\\cdots&&&&\\cdots&\\scriptstyle 2n-3&\\scriptstyle 2n-1\n\\end{array} \n</math>\n\nThe same odd numbers are now arranged in two different ways in congruent triangles.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n\\scriptstyle 2n-1&&&&&& \\\\ \n\\scriptstyle 2n-3&\\scriptstyle 2n-3&&&&& \\\\ \n\\vdots&&\\ddots&&&&\\\\\n9&\\cdots&\\cdots&9&&&&\\\\\n7&\\cdots&\\cdots&7&7&&&\\\\  \n5&\\cdots&\\cdots&5&5&5\\\\\n3&\\cdots&\\cdots&3&3&3&3\\\\\n1&\\cdots&\\cdots&1&1&1&1&1 \\\\ \\hline\n\\scriptstyle =n^2& \\scriptstyle =(n-1)^2&\\cdots& \\scriptstyle =5^2& \\scriptstyle =4^2& \\scriptstyle =3^2& \\scriptstyle =2^2& \\scriptstyle =1^2\n\\end{array} \n</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\n\\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n1&&&&&&& \\\\ \n3&1&&&&&&\\\\\n5&3&1&&&&&\\\\\n7&5&3&1&&&&\\\\  \n9&7&5&3&1&&&\\\\\n\\vdots&&&&&\\ddots&&\\\\\n\\scriptstyle 2n-3&\\cdots&&&&\\cdots&1& \\\\\n\\scriptstyle 2n-1&\\scriptstyle 2n-3&&&&\\cdots&&1 \\\\ \\hline\n\\scriptstyle =n^2& \\scriptstyle =(n-1)^2&\\cdots& \\scriptstyle =5^2& \\scriptstyle =4^2& \\scriptstyle =3^2& \\scriptstyle =2^2& \\scriptstyle =1^2\n\\end{array} \n</math>\n\nStacking the three triangles on top of each other's yields you columns consisting of three numbers, which have the property that their sum is always {{math|2''n'' + 1}}. At each vertex the sum of the column is {{math|1=2''n'' &minus; 1 + 1 + 1 = 2''n'' + 1}}. Now if you move from one column to another then in one triangle the number will increase by two but in a second triangle it decrease by two and remain the same in the third triangle, hence the sum of the column stays constant. There are <math>1+2+\\ldots+n=\\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2}</math> such columns, so the sum of the numbers in all three triangles is <math>\\tfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{2}</math>. This is thrice the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} square numbers, so it yields:\n\n:<math>P_n=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</math>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n | editor1-last = Abramowitz | editor1-first = M. | editor1-link = Milton Abramowitz\n | editor2-last = Stegun | editor2-first = I.

It was first proven by [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], and a short but advanced proof was given by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].<ref>{{Citation |first=S. |last=Ramanujan |title=A proof of Bertrand's postulate |journal=Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society |volume=11 |year=1919 |pages=181–182 |url=http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/CamUnivCpapers/Cpaper24/page1.htm }}</ref> The gist of the following elementary proof is due to [[Paul Erd&#337;s]]. The basic idea of the proof is to show that a certain [[central binomial coefficient]] needs to have a [[prime factor]] within the desired interval in order to be large enough. This is made possible by a careful analysis of the prime factorization of central binomial coefficients.\n\nThe main steps of the proof are as follows. First, one shows that every [[prime power]] factor <math>p^r</math> that enters into the prime decomposition of \nthe central binomial coefficient <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}:=\\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}</math> is at most <math>2n</math>. In particular, every prime larger than <math>\\sqrt{2n}</math> can enter at most once into this decomposition; that is, its exponent <math>r</math> is at most one. The next step is to prove that <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}</math> has no prime factors at all in the gap interval <math>\\left(\\tfrac{2n}{3}, n\\right)</math>.  As a consequence of these two bounds, the contribution to the size of <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}</math> coming from all the prime factors that are at most <math>n</math> [[asymptotic analysis|grows asymptotically]] as <math>O(\\theta^n)</math> for some <math>\\theta<4</math>. Since the \nasymptotic growth of the central binomial coefficient is at least <math>4^n/2n</math>, one concludes that for <math>n</math> large enough the binomial coefficient must have another prime  factor, which can only lie between <math>n</math> and <math>2n</math>.\nIndeed, making these estimates quantitative, one obtains that this argument is valid for all <math>n>468</math>. The remaining smaller values of&nbsp;<math>n</math> are easily settled by direct inspection, completing the proof of Bertrand's postulate. This proof is so short and elegant that it is considered to be one of the [[Proofs from THE BOOK]].\n\n==Lemmas and computation==\n\n==={{anchor|Lemma 1}}Lemma 1: A lower bound on the central binomial coefficients===\n'''Lemma:''' For any integer <math>n>0</math>, we have\n:<math> \\frac{4^n}{2n} \\le \\binom{2n}{n}.</math>\n\n'''Proof:''' Applying the [[binomial theorem]],\n:<math>4^n = (1 + 1)^{2n} = \\sum_{k = 0}^{2n} \\binom{2n}{k}=2+\\sum_{k = 1}^{2n-1} \\binom{2n}{k} \\le 2n\\binom{2n}{n},</math>\nsince <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}</math> is the largest term in the sum in the right-hand side, and the sum has <math>2n</math> terms (including the initial <math>2</math> outside the summation).\n\n==={{anchor|Lemma 2}}Lemma 2: An upper bound on prime powers dividing central binomial coefficients===\nFor a fixed prime <math>p</math>, define <math>R:=R(p,n)</math> to be the largest natural number <math>r</math> such that <math>p^r</math> divides <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}</math>.\n\n'''Lemma:''' For any prime <math>p</math>, <math>p^{R }\\le 2n</math>.\n\n'''Proof:''' The exponent of <math>p</math> in <math>n!</math> is (see [[Factorial#Number theory]]):\n:<math>\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^j} \\right\\rfloor,</math>\nso\n:<math> R \n        =\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2n}{p^j} \\right\\rfloor - 2\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^j} \\right\\rfloor\n        =\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2n}{p^j} \\right\\rfloor - 2\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^j} \\right\\rfloor\\right).\n </math>\nBut each term of the last summation can either be zero (if <math>n/p^j \\bmod 1< 1/2</math>) or 1  (if <math>n/p^j \\bmod 1\\ge  1/2</math>) and all terms with <math>j>\\log_p(2n)</math> are zero.  Therefore,\n:<math>R  \\leq \\log_p(2n),</math>\nand\n:<math>p^{R } \\leq p^{\\log_p{2n}} = 2n.</math>\nThis completes the proof of the lemma.\n\n==={{anchor|Lemma 3}}Lemma 3: Central binomial coefficients have no prime factor in a large interval ===\n'''Claim:''' If <math> p </math> is odd and <math> \\frac{2n}{3} < p \\leq n </math>, then <math>R(p,n) = 0.</math>\n\n'''Proof:''' There are exactly two factors of <math>p</math> in the numerator of the expression <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}=\\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}</math>, coming from the two terms <math>p</math> and <math>2p</math> in <math>(2n)!</math>, and also two factors of <math>p</math> in the denominator from two copies of the term <math>p</math> in <math>n!</math>. These factors all cancel, leaving no factors of <math>p</math> in <math>\\tbinom{2n}{n}</math>. (The bound on <math>p</math> in the preconditions of the lemma ensures that <math>3p</math> is too large to be a term of the numerator, and the assumption that <math>p</math> is odd is needed to ensure that <math>2p</math> contributes only one factor of <math>p</math> to the numerator).\n\n==={{anchor|Lemma 4}}Lemma 4: An upper bound on the primorial===\nWe estimate the [[primorial]] function,\n:<math>x\\# = \\prod_{p \\leq x} p,</math>\nwhere the product is taken over all ''prime'' numbers <math>p</math> less than or equal to the real number <math>x .</math>\n\n'''Lemma:''' For all real numbers <math>x\\ge 3</math>, <math>x\\#<2^{2x-3}.</math>\n'''Proof:'''\nSince <math>  x \\# =  \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\#</math> and <math>2^{2\\lfloor x\\rfloor-3}\\le2^{2x-3}</math>, it suffices to prove the result under the assumption that <math> x = m </math> is an integer, <math>m\\ge3.</math> Since <math>\\binom{2m-1}{m}</math> is an integer and all the primes <math> m+1 \\le p \\le 2m-1   </math> appear in its numerator but not in its denominator,  we have\n:<math>\\frac{(2m-1)\\#}{m\\#} \\le \\binom{2m-1}{m} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\binom{2m-1}{m-1}+\\binom{2m-1}{m}\\right) < \\frac{1}{2}(1+1)^{2m-1} = 2^{2m-2}.</math>\nThe proof proceeds by [[Mathematical induction#Complete (strong) induction|complete induction]] on <math>n.</math> \n* If <math>n = 3</math>, then <math> n\\# = 6 < 8 = 2^{2n-3}.</math>\n* If <math>n = 4</math>, then <math> n\\# = 6 < 32 = 2^{2n-3}.</math>\n* If <math>n\\ge5</math> is odd, <math> n=2m-1 </math>, then by the above estimate and the induction assumption, since <math>m\\ge3</math> and <math>m<n</math>  it is\n:<math>n\\# = (2m-1)\\# < m\\#\\cdot2^{2m-2} < 2^{2m-3}2^{2m-2} = 2^{4m-5} = 2^{2n-3}.</math>\n* If <math> n=2m </math> is even and <math>n\\ge6,</math> then by the above estimate and the induction assumption, since <math>m\\ge3</math> and <math>n-1<n</math> it is\n:<math>n\\# = (2m)\\# = (2m-1)\\#= (n-1)\\# < 2^{2(n-1)-3} < 2^{2n-3}.</math>\nThus the lemma is proven.\n\n==Proof of Bertrand's Postulate==\nAssume there is a [[counterexample]]: an integer ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2 such that there is no prime ''p''  with ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2''n''.\n\nIf 2 ≤ ''n'' &lt; 468, then ''p'' can be chosen from among the prime numbers 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 43, 83, 163, 317, 631 (each being less than twice its predecessor) such that ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2''n''.  Therefore, ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;468.\n\nThere are no prime factors ''p'' of <math>\\textstyle\\binom{2n}{n}</math> such that:\n* 2''n'' < ''p'', because every factor must divide (2''n'')!;\n* ''p'' = 2''n'', because 2''n'' is not prime;\n* ''n'' < ''p'' < 2''n'', because we assumed there is no such prime number;\n* 2''n'' / 3 < ''p'' ≤ ''n'': by [[#Lemma 3|Lemma 3]].\nTherefore, every prime factor ''p'' satisfies ''p''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;2''n''/3.\n\nWhen <math> p > \\sqrt{2n},</math> the number <math>\\textstyle {2n \\choose n} </math> has at most one factor of ''p''. By [[#Lemma 2|Lemma 2]], for any prime ''p'' we have ''p''<sup>''R''(''p'',''n'')</sup> ≤ 2''n'', so the product of the ''p''<sup>''R''(''p'',''n'')</sup> over the primes less than or equal to <math>\\sqrt{2n}</math> is at most <math>(2n)^{\\sqrt{2n}}</math>.  Then, starting with [[#Lemma 1|Lemma 1]] and decomposing the right-hand side into its prime factorization, and finally using [[#Lemma 4|Lemma 4]], these bounds give:\n:<math>\\frac{4^n}{2n }\n       \\le \\binom{2n}{n}\n       = \\left(\\prod_{p \\le \\sqrt{2n}} p^{R(p,n)}\\right) \\left(\\prod_{\\sqrt{2n} < p \\le \\frac{2n}{3}} p^{R(p,n)}\\right)\n       < (2n)^{\\sqrt{2n}}  \\prod_{1 < p \\leq \\frac{2n}{3} } p\n       = (2n)^{\\sqrt{2n}} \\Big( \\frac{2n}{3}\\Big)\\# \\le (2n)^{\\sqrt{2n}} 4^{2n/3}.</math>\nTaking logarithms yields to\n:<math>{\\frac{\\log 4}{3}}n  \\le (\\sqrt{2n}+1)\\log 2n\\; .</math>\nBy concavity of the right-hand side as a function of ''n'', the last inequality is necessarily verified on an interval. Since it holds true for ''n=467'' and it does not for ''n=468'', we obtain\n:<math>n  <  468.</math>\nBut these cases have already been settled, and we conclude that no counterexample to the postulate is possible.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Martin Aigner|Aigner, Martin, G.]], [[Günter M.

This phenomenon was first observed by [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]] in 1853.\n\n==Description==\nLet π(''x'';&nbsp;''n'',&nbsp;''m'') denote the number of primes of the form ''nk''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''m'' up to&nbsp;''x''.

This, however, is not supported by numerical evidence — in fact, π(''x'';&nbsp;4,&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;π(''x'';&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1) occurs much more frequently. Indeed this\ninequality holds for all primes ''x''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;26833 except 5, 17, 41 and 461, for which π(''x'';&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;π(''x'';&nbsp;4,&nbsp;3).

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Cunningham chain''' is a certain sequence of [[prime number]]s. Cunningham chains are named after [[mathematician]] [[Allan Joseph Champneys Cunningham|A. J. C. Cunningham]]. They are also called '''chains of nearly doubled primes'''. \n\nOne application for Cunningham chains is using computing power to identify them, in order to generate virtual currency, similar to how [[Bitcoin]] is mined.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lirmm.fr/~imbert/sujets/cunningham-chains.pdf |title=Cunningham Chains Mining |website=lirmm.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n\nA '''Cunningham chain of the first kind''' of length ''n'' is a sequence of prime numbers (''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>) such that for all 1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'', ''p''<sub>''i''+1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''p''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. (Hence each term of such a chain except the last is a [[Sophie Germain prime]], and each term except the first is a [[safe prime]]).\n\nIt follows that\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\np_2 & = 2p_1+1, \\\\\np_3 & = 4p_1+3, \\\\\np_4 & = 8p_1+7, \\\\\n& {}\\  \\vdots \\\\\np_i & = 2^{i-1}p_1 + (2^{i-1}-1).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr, by setting <math> a = \\frac{p_1 + 1}{2} </math> (the number <math> a </math> is not part of the sequence and need not be a prime number), we have <math> p_i = 2^{i} a - 1 </math>\n\nSimilarly, a '''Cunningham chain of the second kind''' of length ''n'' is a sequence of prime numbers (''p''<sub>1</sub>,...,''p''<sub>''n''</sub>) such that for all 1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'', ''p''<sub>''i''+1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''p''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1.\n\nIt follows that the general term is\n\n: <math> p_i = 2^{i-1}p_1 - (2^{i-1}-1) \\, </math>\n\nNow, by setting <math> a = \\frac{p_1 - 1}{2} </math>, we have <math> p_i = 2^{i} a + 1 </math>.\n\nCunningham chains are also sometimes generalized to sequences of prime numbers (''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>) such that for all 1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n'', ''p''<sub>''i''+1</sub> =&nbsp;''ap''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b'' for fixed [[coprime]] [[integer]]s ''a'',&nbsp;''b''; the resulting chains are called '''generalized Cunningham chains'''.\n\nA Cunningham chain is called '''complete''' if it cannot be further extended, i.e., if the previous and the next terms in the chain are not prime numbers.\n\n==Examples==\n\nExamples of complete Cunningham chains of the first kind include these:\n\n: 2, 5, 11, 23, 47 (The next number would be 95, but that is not prime.)\n: 3, 7 (The next number would be 15, but that is not prime.)\n: 29, 59 (The next number would be 119 = 7*17, but that is not prime.)\n: 41, 83, 167 (The next number would be 335, but that is not prime.)\n: 89, 179, 359, 719, 1439, 2879 (The next number would be 5759 = 13*443, but that is not prime.)\n\nExamples of complete Cunningham chains of the second kind include these:\n\n: 2, 3, 5 (The next number would be 9, but that is not prime.)\n: 7, 13 (The next number would be 25, but that is not prime.)\n: 19, 37, 73 (The next number would be 145, but that is not prime.)\n: 31, 61 (The next number would be 121 = 11<sup>2</sup>, but that is not prime.)\n\nCunningham chains are now considered useful in cryptographic systems since \"they provide two concurrent suitable settings for the [[ElGamal encryption|ElGamal cryptosystem]] ... [which] can be implemented in any field where the discrete logarithm problem is difficult.\"<ref>Joe Buhler, ''Algorithmic Number Theory: Third International Symposium, ANTS-III''. New York: Springer (1998): 290</ref>\n\n== Largest known Cunningham chains ==\n\nIt follows from [[Dickson's conjecture]] and the broader [[Schinzel's hypothesis H]], both widely believed to be true, that for every ''k'' there are infinitely many Cunningham chains of length ''k''.  There are, however, no known direct methods of generating such chains.\n\nThere are computing competitions for the longest Cunningham chain or for the one built up of the largest primes, but unlike the breakthrough of [[Ben J. Green]] and [[Terence Tao]] - the [[Green–Tao theorem]], that there are arithmetic progressions of primes of arbitrary length - there is no general result known on large Cunningham chains to date.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Largest known Cunningham chain of length ''k'' (as of 5 June 2018<ref name=\"records\">Dirk Augustin, [http://primerecords.dk/Cunningham_Chain_records.htm ''Cunningham Chain records''].

The first prime is odd, thus <math>p_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}</math>. Since each successive prime in the chain is <math>p_{i+1} = 2p_i + 1</math> it follows that <math>p_i \\equiv 2^i - 1 \\pmod{2^i}</math>. Thus, <math>p_2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}</math>, <math>p_3 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}</math>, and so forth.\n\nThe above property can be informally observed by considering the primes of a chain in base 2. (Note that, as with all bases, multiplying by the number of the base \"shifts\" the digits to the left.) When we consider <math>p_{i+1} = 2p_i + 1</math> in base 2, we see that, by multiplying <math>p_i</math> by 2, the least significant digit of <math>p_i</math> becomes the secondmost least significant digit of <math>p_{i+1}</math>. Because <math>p_i</math> is odd—that is, the least significant digit is 1 in base 2--we know that the secondmost least significant digit of <math>p_{i+1}</math> is also 1. And, finally, we can see that <math>p_{i+1}</math> will be odd due to the addition of 1 to <math>2p_i</math>. In this way, successive primes in a Cunningham chain are essentially shifted left in binary with ones filling in the least significant digits. For example, here is a complete length 6 chain which starts at 141361469:\n\n{| border=\"1\" align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! Binary || Decimal\n|- align=\"right\"\n| 1000011011010000000100111101 || 141361469\n|- align=\"right\"\n| 10000110110100000001001111011 || 282722939\n|- align=\"right\"\n| 100001101101000000010011110111 || 565445879\n|- align=\"right\"\n| 1000011011010000000100111101111 || 1130891759\n|- align=\"right\"\n| 10000110110100000001001111011111 || 2261783519\n|- align=\"right\"\n| 100001101101000000010011110111111 || 4523567039\n|}\n\nA similar result holds for Cunningham chains of the second kind.  From the observation that <math>p_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}</math> and the relation <math>p_{i+1} = 2 p_i - 1</math> it follows that <math>p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^i}</math>.  In binary notation, the primes in a Cunningham chain of the second kind end with a pattern \"0...01\", where, for each <math>i</math>, the number of zeros in the pattern for <math>p_{i+1}</math> is one more than the number of zeros for <math>p_i</math>.  As with Cunningham chains of the first kind, the bits left of the pattern shift left by one position with each successive prime.\n\nSimilarly, because <math> p_i = 2^{i-1}p_1 + (2^{i-1}-1) \\, </math> it follows that <math>p_i \\equiv 2^{i-1} - 1 \\pmod{p_1}</math>. But, by [[Fermat's little theorem]], <math>2^{p_1-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_1}</math>, so <math>p_1</math> divides <math>p_{p_1}</math> (i.e. with <math> i = p_1 </math>). Thus, no Cunningham chain can be of infinite length.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Löh|first=Günter|title=Long chains of nearly doubled primes|journal=Mathematics of Computation|date=October 1989|volume=53|issue=188|pages=751–759|doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-1989-0979939-8|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1989-53-188/S0025-5718-1989-0979939-8/}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Primecoin]], which uses Cunningham chains as a proof-of-work system\n* [[Bi-twin chain]]\n* [[Primes in arithmetic progression]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=CunninghamChain The Prime Glossary: Cunningham chain]\n* [https://primes.zone/ Primecoin discoveries (primes.zone): online database of primecoin findings with list of records and visualization]\n* [http://primes.utm.edu/links/theory/special_forms/Cunningham_chains/ PrimeLinks++: Cunningham chain]\n* {{OEIS el|1=A005602|2=Smallest prime beginning a complete Cunningham chain of length n (of the first kind)}} -- the first term of the lowest complete Cunningham chains of the first kind of length&nbsp;''n'',&nbsp;for&nbsp;1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;14\n* {{OEIS el|1=A005603|2=Chains of length n of nearly doubled primes}} -- the first term of the lowest complete Cunningham chains of the second kind with length&nbsp;''n'',&nbsp;for&nbsp;1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;15\n\n{{Prime number classes}}\n\n[[Category:Prime numbers]]"

The more digits of <math>f_1</math> that we know, the more primes equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) will generate. For example, we can use 25 terms in the series, using the 25 primes less than 100, to calculate the following more precise approximation:\n: <math>f_1 \\simeq 2.920050977316134712092562917112019.</math>\nThis has enough digits for equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) to yield again the 25 primes less than 100.\n\nAs with Mills' formula and Wright's formula above, in order to generate a longer list of primes, we need to start by knowing more digits of the initial constant, <math>f_1</math>.\n\n==Plouffe's formulas==\nIn 2019 [[Simon Plouffe]] proposed a set of formulas for primes, but without actual proofs. Similarly to the formula of Mills, they are of the form:\n\n:<math>\\left\\{a_0^{r^n}\\right\\}</math>\n\n(The {} symbol means rounding to the nearest integer.) For example, with <math>a_0\\approx 43.80468771580293481</math> and <math>r=5/4</math>, this gives 113, 367, 1607, 10177, 102217... Using <math>a_0=10^{500}+961+\\varepsilon</math> and <math>r=1.01</math> with <math>\\varepsilon</math> a certain number between 0 and one half, Plouffe found that he could generate a sequence of 50 [[probable primes]] (with high probability of being prime). Presumably there exists an ε such that this formula will give an infinite sequence of actual prime numbers. The number of digits starts at 501 and increases by about 1% each time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katie Steckles |title=Mathematician's record-beating formula can generate 50 prime numbers |journal=New Scientist |date=Jan 26, 2019 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132143-200-mathematicians-record-beating-formula-can-generate-50-prime-numbers/}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Simon Plouffe |title=A set of formulas for primes |eprint=1901.01849 |class=math.NT |year=2019 }} As of January 2019, the number he gives in the appendix for the 50th number generated is actually the 48th.</ref>\n\n==Prime formulas and polynomial functions==\n\nIt is known that no non-[[constant term|constant]] [[polynomial]] function ''P''(''n'') with integer coefficients exists that evaluates to a [[prime number]] for all integers ''n''. The proof is as follows: suppose such a polynomial existed. Then ''P''(1) would evaluate to a prime ''p'', so <math>P(1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p</math>. But for any integer ''k'', <math>P(1+kp) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p</math> also, so <math>P(1+kp)</math> cannot also be prime (as it would be divisible by ''p'') unless it were ''p'' itself. But the only way <math>P(1+kp) = P(1) = p</math> for all ''k'' is if the polynomial function is constant.\nThe same reasoning shows an even stronger result: no non-constant polynomial function ''P''(''n'') exists that evaluates to a prime number for [[almost all]] integers ''n''.\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] first noticed (in 1772) that the [[quadratic polynomial]]\n\n:<math>P(n) = n^2 + n + 41</math>\n\nis prime for the 40 integers ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., 39. The primes for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., 39 are 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, ..., 1601.  The differences between the terms are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... For ''n'' = 40, it produces a square number, 1681, which is equal to 41×41, the smallest [[composite number]] for this formula for ''n'' ≥ 0. If 41 divides ''n'', it divides ''P(n)'' too. Furthermore, since ''P''(''n'') can be written as ''n''(''n'' + 1) + 41, if 41 divides ''n'' + 1 instead, it also divides ''P''(''n''). The phenomenon is related to the [[Ulam spiral]], which is also implicitly quadratic, and the [[class number (number theory)|class number]]; this polynomial is related to the [[Heegner number]] <math>163=4\\cdot 41-1</math>. There are analogous polynomials for <math>p=2, 3, 5, 11 \\text{ and } 17</math> (the [[lucky numbers of Euler]]), corresponding to other Heegner numbers.\n\nGiven a positive integer ''S'', there may be infinitely many ''c'' such that the expression ''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''n'' + ''c'' is always coprime to ''S''.  Integer ''c'' may be negative, in which case there is a delay before primes are produced.\n\nIt is known, based on [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], that linear polynomial functions <math>L(n) = an + b</math> produce infinitely many primes as long as ''a'' and ''b'' are [[relatively prime]] (though no such function will assume prime values for all values of ''n''). Moreover, the [[Green–Tao theorem]] says that for any ''k'' there exists a pair of ''a'' and ''b'', with the property that <math>L(n) = an+b</math> is prime for any ''n'' from 0 through ''k''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[number theory]], [[Hillel Furstenberg]]'s proof of the infinitude of primes is a [[topology|topological]] [[Mathematical proof|proof]] that the [[integer]]s contain [[Infinite set|infinitely]] many [[prime number]]s.  When examined closely, the proof is less a statement about topology than a statement about certain properties of [[arithmetic sequence]]s.<ref name=mercer/>  Unlike [[Euclid's Theorem#Euclid's proof|Euclid's classical proof]], Furstenberg's proof is a [[proof by contradiction]].  The proof was published in 1955 in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' while Furstenberg was still an [[undergraduate student]] at [[Yeshiva University]].\n\n==Furstenberg's proof==\nDefine a topology on the integers '''Z''', called the [[evenly spaced integer topology]], by declaring a subset ''U''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;'''Z''' to be an [[open set]] [[if and only if]] it is either the [[empty set]], ∅, or it is a [[union (set theory)|union]] of arithmetic sequences ''S''(''a'',&nbsp;''b'') (for ''a''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0), where\n\n:<math>S(a, b) = \\{ a n  + b \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} = a \\mathbb{Z} + b. </math>\n\nIn other words, ''U'' is open if and only if every ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''U'' admits some non-zero integer ''a'' such that ''S''(''a'',&nbsp;''x'')&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''U''. The [[Topological space|axioms for a topology]] are easily verified:\n\n* By definition, ∅ is open; '''Z''' is just the sequence ''S''(1,&nbsp;0), and so is open as well.\n* Any union of open sets is open: for any collection of open sets ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''x'' in their union ''U'', any of the numbers ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> for which ''S''(''a''<sub>''i''</sub>,&nbsp;''x'')&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''U''<sub>''i''</sub> also shows that ''S''(''a''<sub>''i''</sub>,&nbsp;''x'')&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''U''.\n* The intersection of two (and hence finitely many) open sets is open: let ''U''<sub>1</sub> and ''U''<sub>2</sub> be open sets and let ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''U''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''U''<sub>2</sub> (with numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub> establishing membership). Set ''a'' to be the [[lowest common multiple]] of ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>. Then ''S''(''a'',&nbsp;''x'')&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''S''(''a''<sub>''i''</sub>,&nbsp;''x'')&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''U''<sub>i</sub>.\n\nThis topology has two notable properties:\n\n# Since any non-empty open set contains an infinite sequence, a finite set cannot be open; put another way, the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of a finite set cannot be a [[closed set]].\n# The basis sets ''S''(''a'',&nbsp;''b'') are [[clopen set|both open and closed]]: they are open by definition, and we can write ''S''(''a'',&nbsp;''b'') as the complement of an open set as follows:\n\n::: <math>S(a, b) = \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\bigcup_{j = 1}^{a - 1} S(a, b + j).</math>\n\nThe only integers that are not integer multiples of prime numbers are &minus;1 and +1, i.e.\n\n::: <math>\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{ -1, + 1 \\} = \\bigcup_{p \\mathrm{\\, prime}} S(p, 0).</math>\n\nBy the first property, the set on the left-hand side cannot be closed. On the other hand, by the second property, the sets ''S''(''p'',&nbsp;0) are closed. So, if there were only finitely many prime numbers, then the set on the right-hand side would be a finite union of closed sets, and hence closed. This would be a [[contradiction]], so there must be infinitely many prime numbers.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=mercer>\n{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Mercer | first1 = Idris D.\n| title = On Furstenberg's Proof of the Infinitude of Primes \n| journal = American Mathematical Monthly \n| volume = 116 \n| issue = 4\n| pages = 355–356 \n| year = 2009 \n| doi = 10.4169/193009709X470218\n| url = http://www.idmercer.com/monthly355-356-mercer.pdf\n| citeseerx = 10.1.1.559.9528\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite document | last1=Aigner | first1=Martin|author1-link=Martin Aigner | last2=Ziegler | first2=Günter M. | author2-link=Günter M.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_of_primes",
      "text": "In [[computational number theory]], a variety of [[algorithm]]s make it possible to generate [[prime number]]s efficiently.  These are used in various applications, for example [[hash table|hashing]], [[public-key cryptography]], and search of [[prime factor]]s in large numbers.\n\nFor relatively small numbers, it is possible to just apply [[trial division]] to each successive [[odd number]]. Prime sieves are almost always faster.\n\n== Prime sieves ==\n\nA '''prime sieve''' or '''prime number sieve''' is a fast type of algorithm for finding primes. There are many prime sieves. The simple [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] (250s BCE), the [[sieve of Sundaram]] (1934), the still faster but more complicated [[sieve of Atkin]]{{r|AB}} (2004), and various [[Wheel factorization|wheel sieves]]{{r|Pritchard}} are most common.\n\nA prime sieve works by creating a list of all integers up to a desired limit and progressively removing [[composite number]]s (which it directly generates) until only primes are left. This is the most efficient way to obtain a large range of primes; however, to find individual primes, direct [[primality test]]s are more efficient{{fact|date=January 2016}}. Furthermore, based on the sieve formalisms, some integer sequences {{OEIS|id=A240673}} are constructed which they also could be used for generating primes in certain intervals.\n\n== Large primes ==\nFor the large primes used in cryptography, it is usual to use a modified form of sieving: a randomly chosen range of odd numbers of the desired size is sieved against a number of relatively small primes (typically all primes less than 65,000).  The remaining candidate primes are tested in random order with a standard probabilistic primality test such as the [[Baillie–PSW primality test]] or the [[Miller–Rabin primality test]] for [[probable prime]]s.\n\nAlternatively, a number of techniques exist for efficiently generating [[provable prime]]s.  These include generating prime numbers ''p'' for which the [[prime factorization]] of ''p''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 or ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is known, for example [[Mersenne prime]]s, [[Fermat prime]]s and their generalizations.\n\n==Complexity==\nThe [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] is generally considered the easiest sieve to implement, but it is not the fastest in the sense of the number of operations for a given range for large sieving ranges. In its usual standard implementation (which may include basic wheel factorization for small primes), it can find all the primes up to ''N'' in [[Big O notation|time]] <math>O( N \\log \\log N )</math>, while basic implementations of the [[sieve of Atkin]] and [[Wheel factorization|wheel sieves]] run in linear time <math>O(N)</math>.  Special versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes using wheel sieve principles can have this same linear  <math>O(N)</math> time complexity.  A special version of the Sieve of Atkin and some special versions of wheel sieves which may include sieving using the methods from the Sieve of Eratosthenes can run in [[sublinear]] time complexity of <math>O(N / \\log \\log N)</math>.  Note that just because an algorithm has decreased asymptotic time complexity does not mean that a practical implementation runs faster than an algorithm with a greater asymptotic time complexity:  If in order to achieve that lesser asymptotic complexity the individual operations have a constant factor of increased time complexity that may be many times greater than for the simpler algorithm, it may never be possible within practical sieving ranges for the advantage of the reduced number of operations for reasonably large ranges to make up for this extra cost in time per operation.\n\nSome sieving algorithms, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes with large amounts of wheel factorization, take much less time for smaller ranges than their asymptotic time complexity would indicate because they have large negative constant offsets in their complexity and thus don't reach that asymptotic complexity until far beyond practical ranges.  For instance, the Sieve of Eratosthenes with a combination of wheel factorization and pre-culling using small primes up to 19 uses time of about a factor of two less than that predicted for the total range for a range of 10<sup>19</sup>, which total range takes hundreds of core-years to sieve for the best of sieve algorithms.\n\nThe simple naive \"one large sieving array\" sieves of any of these sieve types take memory space of about <math>O(N)</math>, which means that 1) they are very limited in the sieving ranges they can handle to the amount of [[RAM]] (memory) available and 2) that they are typically quite slow since memory access speed typically becomes the speed bottleneck more than computational speed once the array size grows beyond the size of the CPU caches.  The normally implemented page segmented sieves of both Eratosthenes and Atkin take space <math>O(N / \\log N)</math> plus small sieve segment buffers which are normally sized to fit within the CPU cache; page segmented wheel sieves including special variations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes typically take much more space than this by a significant factor in order to store the required wheel representations; Pritchard's variation of the linear time complexity sieve of Eratosthenes/wheel sieve takes <math>O(N^{1/2} \\log \\log N / \\log N)</math> space.  The better time complexity special version of the Sieve of Atkin takes space <math>N^{1/2+o(1)}</math>. Sorenson{{r|Sorenson}} shows an improvement to the wheel sieve that takes even less space at <math>O(N /((\\log N)^{L} \\log \\log N))</math> for any <math>L > 1</math>.  However, the following is a general observation: the more the amount of memory is reduced, the greater the constant factor increase in the cost in time per operation even though the asymptotic time complexity may remain the same, meaning that the memory-reduced versions may run many times slower than the non-memory-reduced versions by quite a large factor.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Formula for primes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"AB\">{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Atkin |first2=D.

The  Goldbach function is studied in relation to [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. The function <math>g(E)</math> is defined for all even integers <math>E > 2</math> to be the number of different ways in which ''E'' can be expressed as the sum of two primes.  For example, <math>g(22) = 3</math> since 22 can be expressed as the sum of two primes in three different ways (<math>22 = 11+11 = 5+17 = 3+19</math>).\n\n[[Image:goldbachs comet.gif]]\n\nThe coloring of points in the above image is based on the value of <math>E/2</math> [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 3 with red points corresponding to 0 mod 3, blue points corresponding to 1 mod 3 and green points corresponding to 2 mod 3.\n\n== Anatomy of the Goldbach Comet ==\n\nAn illuminating way of presenting the comet data is as a [[histogram]].  The function <math>g(E)</math> can be normalized by dividing by the locally averaged value of ''g'', g<sub>av</sub>, taken over perhaps 1000 neighboring values of the even number ''E''.   The histogram can then be accumulated over a range of up to about 10% either side of a central ''E''. \n[[Image:Gbcomethista1.jpg|400 px|right]]\nSuch a histogram appears on the right.  A series of well-defined peaks is evident.  Each of these peaks can be identified as being formed by a set of values of <math>E/2</math> which have certain smallest factors.  The major peaks correspond to lowest factors of 3, 5, 7 ... as labeled.  As the lowest factors become higher the peaks move left and eventually merge to give the lowest value primary peak.\n\nThere is in fact a hierarchy of peaks; the main peaks are composed of subsidiary peaks, with a succession of second smallest factors of <math>E/2</math>.  This hierarchy continues until all factors are exhausted.  \n[[Image:gbcomethistoga2.jpg|300 px|right]]\n\nThe magnified section shows the succession of subsidiary peaks in more detail. \n\nThe relative location of the peaks follows from the form developed by Hardy and Littlewood:<ref>[[G. H. Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood]], \"Some problems of  'partitio numerorum'; III: on the expression of a number as a sum of primes\", [[Acta Mathematica]], vol. 44, pp. 1-70, 1922.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{g(E)}{g_{av}} = \\Pi_{2}\\prod\\frac{(p-1)}{(p-2)}\\,,\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad(1)</math>\n\nwhere the product is taken over all primes ''p'' that are factors of <math>E/2</math>.  The factor on the right is [[Twin prime#First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|Hardy–Littlewood's twin prime constant]]\n\n:<math>\\Pi_{2} = \\prod_{p>2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(p-1)^{2}}\\right) = 0.6601618...</math>\n\nHere the product is taken over all primes greater than 2.\n[[Image:gbcomethistoga3.jpg|300 px|right]]\nOf particular interest is the peak formed by selecting only values of <math>E/2</math> that are prime.  The product factor in equation (1) is then very close to 1.  The peak is very close to a Gaussian form (shown in gray).  For this range of ''E'' values, the peak location is within 0.03% of the ideal <math>\\Pi_{2}</math>. \n\nWhen histograms are formed for different average values of ''E'', the width of this (primes only) peak is found to be proportional to <math>1/\\sqrt{g_{pav}(E)}</math>.  However, it is a factor of about 1.85 less than the value <math>\\sqrt{2/g_{pav}(E)}</math> that would be expected from a hypothesis of totally [[random]] occurrence of prime-pair matching.  This may be expected, since there are [[correlation]]s that give rise to the separated peaks in the total histogram.  \n\n[[Image:gbcomethistoga4.jpg|300 px|right]]\nReturning to the full range of <math>E/2</math> rather than just primes, it is seen that other peaks associated with specified lowest factors of <math>E/2</math> can also be [[Curve fitting|fitted]] by a [[Gaussian]], but only on their lower shoulder.  The upper shoulder, being formed by an aggregate of subsidiary peaks, lies above the simple Gaussian form.\n\nThe relative heights of the peaks in the total histogram are representative of the populations of various types of <math>E/2</math> having differing factors.  The heights are approximately inversely proportional to <math>\\Pi\\,p</math>, the products of the lowest factors.  Thus the height of the peak marked (3,5) in the overall histogram is about 1/15 of the main peak.  Heights may vary from this by about 20%; their exact value is a complex function of the way in which the peaks are constituted from their components and of their varying width.\n\nIt is interesting to speculate on the possibility of any number ''E'' having zero prime pairs, taking these Gaussian forms as [[probabilities]], and assuming it is legitimate to [[extrapolate]] to the zero-pair point.  If this is done, the probability of zero pairs for any one ''E'', in the range considered here, is of order 10<sup>−3700</sup>. The integrated probability over all ''E'' to infinity, taking into account the narrowing of the peak width, is not much larger.  Any search for violation of the Goldbach conjecture may reasonably be expected to have these odds to contend with.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Prime numbers]]"

Since the bits making up a computer program also represent a number, the plan was for the number to have some special property that would make it archivable and publishable (one method was to print it on a T-shirt). The [[primality]] of a number is a fundamental property of [[number theory]] and is therefore not dependent on legal definitions of any particular jurisdiction.\n\nThe large prime database of The [[Prime Pages]] website records the top 20 primes of various special forms; one of them is proof of primality using the [[elliptic curve primality proving]] (ECPP) [[algorithm]]. Thus, if the number were large enough and proved prime using ECPP, it would be published.\n\n==Discovery==\nSpecifically, Carmody applied [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] to several prime candidates of the form \n''k''·256<sup>''n''</sup> + ''b'',  where ''k'' was the [[decimal]] representation of the original compressed file. Multiplying by a power of 256 adds as many trailing [[null character]]s to the [[gzip]] file as indicated in the [[exponentiation|exponent]] which would still result in the DeCSS C code when unzipped.\n\nOf those prime candidates, several were identified as [[probable prime]] using the [[Open-source software|open source]] program OpenPFGW, and one of them was proved prime using the ECPP algorithm implemented by the Titanix software.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/03/19/dvd_descrambler_encoded_in_illegal/ DVD descrambler encoded in ‘illegal’ prime number] (Thomas C.

Mills]] who proved in 1947 the existence of ''A'' based on results of [[Guido Hoheisel]] and [[Albert Ingham]] on the [[prime gap]]s.\nIts value is unknown, but if the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true, it is approximately 1.3063778838630806904686144926... {{OEIS|id=A051021|name=Decimal expansion of Mills's constant, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis is true}}.\n\n==Mills primes==\nThe primes generated by Mills' constant are known as Mills primes; if the Riemann hypothesis is true, the sequence begins\n:<math>2, 11, 1361, 2521008887, 16022236204009818131831320183, 4113101149215104800030529537915953170486139623539759933135949994882770404074832568499, \\ldots</math> {{OEIS|A051254}}.\n\nIf ''a<sub>i</sub>'' denotes the ''i''<sup>th</sup> prime in this sequence, then ''a<sub>i</sub>'' can be calculated as the smallest prime number larger than <math>a_{i-1}^3</math>.

The Hoheisel–Ingham results guarantee that there exists a prime between any two sufficiently large [[cubic number]]s, which is sufficient to prove this inequality if we start from a sufficiently large first prime <math>a_1</math>.

Finding the prime factors is often harder than to compute gcd and lcm with other algorithms which do not require known prime factorization.\n*''m'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'' (also called ''m'' divides ''n'', or ''n'' is divisible by ''m'') if all prime factors of ''m'' have at least the same multiplicity in ''n''.\nThe divisors of ''n'' are all products of some or all prime factors of ''n'' (including the empty product 1 of no prime factors).\nThe number of divisors can be computed by increasing all multiplicities by 1 and then multiplying them.\nDivisors and properties related to divisors are shown in [[table of divisors]].\n\n== 1 to 100 ==\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1 − 20\n|-\n|[[1 (number)|1]]|| <!-- Please do not put a 1 in this box.

Peaks occur at multiples of 6.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0310148 \"Hidden structure in the randomness of the prime number sequence?\", S. Ares & M. Castro, 2005]</ref>]]\nA '''prime gap''' is the difference between two successive [[prime number]]s. The ''n''-th prime gap, denoted ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> or ''g''(''p''<sub>''n''</sub>) is the difference between the (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-th and the\n''n''-th prime numbers, i.e.\n\n:<math>g_n = p_{n + 1} - p_n.\\ </math>\n\nWe have ''g''<sub>1</sub> = 1, ''g''<sub>2</sub> = ''g''<sub>3</sub> = 2, and ''g''<sub>4</sub> = 4. The [[sequence]] (''g''<sub>''n''</sub>) of prime gaps has been extensively studied; however, many questions and conjectures remain unanswered.\n\nThe first 60 prime gaps are:\n\n:1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 8, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 14, 4, 6, 2, 10, 2, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 2, 10, 2, 4, 2, 12, 12, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 10, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A001223}}.\n\nBy the definition of ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> every prime can be written as\n\n:<math>p_{n+1} = 2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n g_i.</math>\n\n==Simple observations==\nThe first, smallest, and only odd prime gap is the gap of size 1 between 2, the only even prime number, and 3, the first odd prime. All other prime gaps are even. There is only one pair of consecutive gaps having length 2: the gaps ''g''<sub>2</sub> and ''g''<sub>3</sub> between the primes 3, 5, and 7.\n\nFor any integer ''n'', the [[factorial]] ''n''! is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of all positive integers up to and including ''n''. Then in the sequence\n\n: <math>n!+2, n!+3,\\ldots,n!+n</math>\n\nthe first term is divisible by 2, the second term is divisible by 3, and so on.  Thus, this is a sequence of {{math|''n'' − 1}} consecutive composite integers, and it must belong to a gap between primes having length at least ''n''.  It follows that there are gaps between primes that are arbitrarily large, that is, for any integer ''N'', there is an integer ''m'' with {{math|''g''<sub>''m''</sub> ≥ ''N''}}.\n\nIn reality, prime gaps of ''n'' numbers can occur at numbers much smaller than ''n''!. For instance, the first prime gap of size larger than 14 occurs between the primes 523 and 541, while 15! is the vastly larger number 1307674368000.\n\nThe average gap between primes increases as the [[natural logarithm]] of the integer, and therefore the ratio of the prime gap to the integers involved decreases (and is asymptotically zero).  This is a consequence of the [[prime number theorem]]. From a heuristic view, we expect the probability that the ratio of the length of the gap to the natural logarithm is greater than or equal to a fixed positive number ''k'' to be {{math|''e''<sup>−''k''</sup>}}; consequently the ratio can be arbitrarily large. Indeed, the ratio of the gap to the number of digits of the integers involved does increase without bound.  This is a consequence of a result by Westzynthius.\n\nIn the opposite direction, the [[twin prime conjecture]] asserts that {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>''n''</sub> = 2}} for infinitely many integers ''n''.\n\n==Numerical results==\nUsually the [[ratio]] of ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> / ln(''p''<sub>''n''</sub>) is called the ''merit'' of the gap ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;. {{As of|September 2017}}, the largest known prime gap with identified [[probable prime]] gap ends has length 6582144, with 216841-digit probable primes found by Martin Raab.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://trnicely.net/index.html#TPG | title=Thomas R.

      "text": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Prime ''k''-tuple}}\nIn [[number theory]], a '''prime ''k''-tuple''' is a finite collection of values representing a repeatable pattern of differences between [[prime number]]s.  For a ''k''-tuple (''a'', ''b'', ...), the positions where the ''k''-tuple matches a pattern in the prime numbers are given by the set of integers ''n'' such that all of the values (''n'' + ''a'', ''n'' + ''b'', ...) are prime. Typically the first value in the ''k''-tuple is 0 and the rest are distinct positive [[even number]]s.<ref>Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=ktuple \"The Prime Glossary: k-tuple\"] at The [[Prime Pages]].</ref>\n\n==Named patterns==\nSeveral of the shortest ''k''-tuples are known by other common names:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| (0, 2) || [[twin prime]]s\n|-\n| (0, 4) || [[cousin prime]]s\n|-\n| (0, 6) || [[sexy prime]]s\n|-\n| (0, 2, 6), (0, 4, 6) || [[prime triplet]]s\n|-\n| (0, 6, 12) || [[sexy prime#Sexy prime triplets|sexy prime triplets]]\n|-\n| (0, 2, 6, 8) || [[prime quadruplet]]s, [[prime decade]]\n|-\n| (0, 6, 12, 18) || [[sexy prime#Sexy prime quadruplets|sexy prime quadruplets]]\n|-\n| (0, 2, 6, 8, 12), (0, 4, 6, 10, 12) || [[prime quadruplet#Prime quintuplets|quintuplet prime]]s\n|-\n| (0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16) || [[prime quadruplet#Prime quintuplets|sextuplet prime]]s\n|}\n\n[[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] sequence {{OEIS2C|A257124}} covers 7-tuples (''prime septuplets'') and contains an overview of related sequences, e.g. the three sequences corresponding to the three [[#Admissibility|admissible]] 8-tuples (''prime octuplets''), and the union of all 8-tuples. The first term in these sequences corresponds to the first prime in the smallest [[#Prime constellations|prime constellation]] shown below.\n\n==Admissibility==\nIn order for a ''k''-tuple to have infinitely many positions at which all of its values are prime, there cannot exist a prime ''p'' such that the tuple includes every different possible value [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&nbsp;''p''. For, if such a prime ''p'' existed, then no matter which value of ''n'' was chosen, one of the values formed by adding ''n'' to the tuple would be divisible by&nbsp;''p'', so there could only be finitely many prime placements (only those including ''p'' itself).  For example, the numbers in a ''k''-tuple cannot take on all three values 0, 1, and 2 modulo 3; otherwise the resulting numbers would always include a multiple of 3 and therefore could not all be prime unless one of the numbers is 3 itself. A ''k''-tuple that satisfies this condition (i.e. it does not have a ''p'' for which it covers all the different values modulo&nbsp;''p'') is called '''admissible'''.\n\nIt is conjectured that every admissible ''k''-tuple matches infinitely many positions in the sequence of prime numbers. However, there is no admissible tuple for which this has been proven except the ''1''-tuple (0). Nevertheless, by [[Yitang Zhang|Yitang Zhang's]] famous proof of 2013 it follows that there exists at least one ''2''-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Bounded_gaps_between_primes|title=Bounded gaps between primes|last=|first=|date=|website=PolyMath|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===Positions matched by inadmissible patterns===\nAlthough (0, 2, 4) is not admissible it does produce the single set of primes, (3, 5, 7).\n\nSome inadmissible ''k''-tuples have more than one all-prime solution. This cannot happen for a ''k''-tuple that includes all values modulo&nbsp;3, so to have this property a ''k''-tuple must cover all values modulo a larger prime, implying that there are at least five numbers in the tuple. The shortest inadmissible tuple with more than one solution is the 5-tuple (0, 2, 8, 14, 26), which has two solutions:  (3, 5, 11, 17, 29) and (5, 7, 13, 19, 31) where all congruences (mod 5) are included in both cases.\n\n==Prime constellations==\nThe '''diameter''' of a ''k''-tuple is the difference of its largest and smallest elements. An admissible prime ''k''-tuple with the smallest possible diameter ''d'' (among all admissible ''k''-tuples) is a '''prime constellation'''. For all ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''k'' this will always produce consecutive primes.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=PrimeConstellation|title=Prime Constellation}}</ref>\n\nThis means that, for large ''n'':\n\n''p''{{sub|''n+k−1''}} − ''p''{{sub|''n''}} ≥ ''d''\n\nwhere ''p''{{sub|''n''}} is the ''n''th prime.\n\nThe first few prime constellations are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While the conjecture is unproven it is considered likely to be true. If that is the case, it implies that the [[second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture]], in contrast, is false.\n\n==Prime arithmetic progressions==\n{{Main|Primes in arithmetic progression}}\nA prime ''k''-tuple of the form (0, ''n'', 2''n'', ...) is said to be a '''prime arithmetic progression'''.  In order for such a ''k''-tuple to meet the admissibility test, n must be a multiple of the [[primorial]] of ''k''.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=PrimeArithmeticProgression|title=Prime Arithmetic Progression}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Prime number classes}}\n\n[[Category:Prime numbers]]"

This number is therefore equal to\n\n:<math>\\pi(x)-\\pi\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)+1</math>\n\nwhen the numbers <math>p_1, p_2,\\ldots,p_n</math> are the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of <math>x</math>.\n\n=== The Meissel–Lehmer algorithm ===\n\n{{main|Meissel–Lehmer algorithm}}\n\nIn a series of articles published between 1870 and 1885, [[Ernst Meissel]] described (and used) a practical combinatorial way of evaluating <math>\\pi(x)</math>. Let <math>p_1</math>,&nbsp;<math>p_2,\\ldots,p_n</math> be the first <math>n</math> primes and denote by <math>\\Phi(m,n)</math> the number of natural numbers not greater than <math>m</math> which are divisible by no <math>p_i</math>. Then\n\n: <math>\\Phi(m,n)=\\Phi(m,n-1)-\\Phi\\left(\\frac m {p_n},n-1\\right).</math>\n\nGiven a natural number <math>m</math>, if <math>n=\\pi\\left(\\sqrt[3]{m}\\right)</math> and if <math>\\mu=\\pi\\left(\\sqrt{m}\\right)-n</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\pi(m)=\\Phi(m,n)+n(\\mu+1)+\\frac{\\mu^2-\\mu} 2 - 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^\\mu\\pi\\left(\\frac m {p_{n+k}}\\right).</math>\n\nUsing this approach, Meissel computed <math>\\pi(x)</math>, for <math>x</math> equal to 5{{e|5}}, 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, and 10<sup>8</sup>.\n\nIn 1959, [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]] extended and simplified Meissel's method. Define, for real <math>m</math> and for natural numbers <math>n</math> and <math>k</math>, <math>P_k(m,n)</math> as the number of numbers not greater than ''m'' with exactly ''k'' prime factors, all greater than <math>p_n</math>. Furthermore, set <math>P_0(m,n)=1</math>. Then\n\n:<math>\\Phi(m,n)=\\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} P_k(m,n)</math>\n\nwhere the sum actually has only finitely many nonzero terms. Let <math>y</math> denote an integer such that <math>\\sqrt[3]{m}\\le y\\le\\sqrt{m}</math>, and set <math>n=\\pi(y)</math>. Then <math>P_1(m,n)=\\pi(m)-n</math> and <math>P_k(m,n)=0</math> when <math>k</math>&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3. Therefore,\n\n:<math>\\pi(m)=\\Phi(m,n)+n-1-P_2(m,n)</math>\n\nThe computation of <math>P_2(m,n)</math> can be obtained this way:\n\n:<math>P_2(m,n)=\\sum_{y<p\\le\\sqrt{m}}\\left(\\pi\\left(\\frac m p \\right)-\\pi(p)+1\\right)</math>,\n\nwhere the sum is over prime numbers.\n\nOn the other hand, the computation of <math>\\Phi(m,n)</math> can be done using the following rules:\n\n#<math>\\Phi(m,0)=\\lfloor m\\rfloor</math>\n#<math>\\Phi(m,b)=\\Phi(m,b-1)-\\Phi\\left(\\frac m{p_b},b-1\\right)</math>\n\nUsing his method and an [[IBM 701]], Lehmer was able to compute <math>\\pi\\left(10^{10}\\right)</math>.\n\nFurther improvements to this method were made by Lagarias, Miller, Odlyzko, Deléglise and Rivat.<ref name=\"pix_comp\">{{cite web |title=Computing {{pi}}(''x''): The Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias, Miller, Odlyzko method |url=http://www.ams.org/mcom/1996-65-213/S0025-5718-96-00674-6/S0025-5718-96-00674-6.pdf |publisher=Marc Deléglise and Joël Rivat, ''Mathematics of Computation'', vol.&nbsp;'''65''', number 33, January 1996, pages 235–245 |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Other prime-counting functions==\n\nOther prime-counting functions are also used because they are more convenient to work with. One is Riemann's prime-counting function, usually denoted as <math>\\Pi_0(x)</math> or <math>J_0(x)</math>. This has jumps of 1/''n'' for prime powers ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>, with it taking a value halfway between the two sides at discontinuities.

Analytic formulas for prime-counting were the first used to prove the [[prime number theorem]]. They stem from the work of Riemann and [[Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt|von Mangoldt]], and are generally known as [[Explicit formulae (L-function)|explicit formula]]s.<ref name=\"Titchmarsh\">{{cite book |first=E.C. |last=Titchmarsh |year=1960 |title=The Theory of Functions, 2nd ed. |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nWe have the following expression for ''ψ'':\n\n:<math>\\psi_0(x) = x - \\sum_\\rho \\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} - \\ln 2\\pi - \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1-x^{-2}),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\psi_0(x) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\psi(x-\\varepsilon) + \\psi(x+\\varepsilon)}{2}.</math>\n\nHere ρ are the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] in the critical strip, where the real part of ρ is between zero and one. The formula is valid for values of ''x'' greater than one, which is the region of interest. The sum over the roots is conditionally convergent, and should be taken in order of increasing absolute value of the imaginary part. Note that the same sum over the trivial roots gives the last [[subtrahend]] in the formula.\n\nFor <math>\\Pi_0(x)</math> we have a more complicated formula\n\n:<math>\\Pi_0(x) = \\operatorname{li}(x) - \\sum_{\\rho}\\operatorname{li}(x^\\rho) - \\ln 2 + \\int_x^\\infty \\frac{dt}{t(t^2-1) \\ln t}.</math>\n\n[[File:Riemann Explicit Formula.gif|thumb|Riemann's explicit formula using the first 200 non-trivial zeros of the zeta function]]\n\nAgain, the formula is valid for ''x'' > 1, while ''ρ'' are the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function ordered according to their absolute value, and, again, the latter integral, taken with minus sign, is just the same sum, but over the trivial zeros.

It uses the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) platform. PrimeGrid offers a number of subprojects for prime-number sieving and discovery. Some of these are available through the BOINC client, others through the PRPNet client. Some of the work is manual, i.e it requires manually starting work units and uploading results. Different subprojects may run on different operating systems, and may have executables for CPUs, GPUs, or both; while running the [[Lucas–Lehmer–Riesel_test#LLR_software|Lucas–Lehmer–Riesel test]], CPUs with [[Advanced Vector Extensions]] and [[FMA_instruction_set|Fused Multiply-Add]] instruction sets will yield the fastest results for non-GPU accelerated workloads.\n\nPrimeGrid awards badges to users in recognition of achieving certain defined levels of credit for work done. The badges are of no intrinsic value but are valued by many as a sign of achievement. The issuing of badges should also benefit PrimeGrid by evening out the participation in the less popular sub projects. The easiest of the badges can often be obtained in less than a day by a single computer, whereas the most challenging badges will require far more time and computing power. \n\n==History==\nPrimeGrid started in June 2005<ref name=race08/> under the name Message@home and tried to decipher text fragments hashed with [[MD5]]. Message@home was a test to port the BOINC scheduler to Perl to obtain greater portability. After a while the project attempted the [[RSA factoring challenge]] trying to factor RSA-640. After RSA-640 was factored by an outside team in November 2005, the project moved on to RSA-768. With the chance to succeed too small, it discarded the RSA challenges, was renamed to PrimeGrid, and started generating a list of the first prime numbers. At 210,000,000,000<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = https://www.primegrid.com/orig/torrent.php\n |title        = Prime Lists\n |publisher    = PrimeGrid\n |accessdate   = 2011-09-19\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100530071550/http://primegrid.com/orig/torrent.php\n |archive-date = 2010-05-30\n |dead-url     = yes\n |df           = \n}}</ref>\nthe primegen subproject was stopped.\n\nIn June 2006, dialog started with [[Riesel Sieve]] to bring their project to the BOINC community. PrimeGrid provided PerlBOINC support and Riesel Sieve was successful in implementing their sieve as well as a prime finding ([[Lucas–Lehmer–Riesel test|LLR]]) application. With collaboration from Riesel Sieve, PrimeGrid was able to implement the LLR application in partnership with another prime finding project, [[Twin Prime Search]] (TPS). In November 2006, the TPS LLR application was officially released at PrimeGrid. Less than two months later, January 2007, the record twin was found by the original manual project. TPS has since been completed, while the search for [[Sophie_Germain_prime|Sophie Germain primes]] continues.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the [[Cullen prime|Cullen]] and [[Woodall prime|Woodall]] prime searches were launched. In the Fall, more prime searches were added through partnerships with the [[Sierpinski_number#Prime_Sierpiński_problem|Prime Sierpinski Problem]] and [http://www.mersenneforum.org/forumdisplay.php?f=14 3*2^n-1 Search] projects. Additionally, two sieves were added: the Prime Sierpinski Problem combined sieve which includes supporting the [[Seventeen or Bust]] sieve and the combined Cullen/Woodall sieve. In the fall of the same year, PrimeGrid migrated its systems from PerlBOINC to standard [[BOINC]] software.\n\nSince September 2008, PrimeGrid is also running a [[Proth prime]] sieving subproject.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=973\n| title = PrimeGrid forum: PPS Sieve\n| author = John\n| publisher = PrimeGrid\n| accessdate = 2011-09-19\n}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2010 the subproject Seventeen or Bust (for solving the [[Sierpinski problem]]) was added.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=1647\n| title = PrimeGrid forum: Seventeen or Bust and the Sierpinski Problem\n| author = John\n| publisher = PrimeGrid\n| accessdate = 2011-09-19\n}}</ref>\nThe calculations for the [[Riesel problem]] followed in March 2010.\n\n==Projects==\n{{As of|2017|9}}, PrimeGrid is working on or has worked on the following projects:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Continued testing for twin primes in conjunction with the search for a [[Sophie Germain prime]] yielded a new record twin prime on September 2016 upon finding the number {{Math|2996863034895 × 2<sup>1290000</sup> ± 1}} composed of 388,342 digits.\n\n===Woodall prime search===\n{{As of|2010|4|22}}, the project has discovered the three largest [[Woodall number|Woodall primes]] known to date.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=7\n| title = The Top Twenty: Woodall Primes\n| publisher = University of Tennessee Martin\n| accessdate = 2011-09-19\n}}</ref>\nThe largest of these, {{Math|3752948 × 2<sup>3752948</sup> − 1}}, is the first [[mega prime]] discovered by the project and is 1129757 digits long.

      "text": " \nIn [[number theory]], '''primes in arithmetic progression''' are any [[sequence]] of at least three [[prime number]]s that are consecutive terms in an [[arithmetic progression]]. An example is the sequence of primes (3, 7, 11), which is given by <math>a_n = 3 + 4n</math> for <math>0 \\le n \\le 2</math>.\n\nAccording to the [[Green–Tao theorem]], there exist [[arbitrarily large|arbitrarily long]] sequences of primes in arithmetic progression. Sometimes the phrase may also be used about primes which belong to an arithmetic progression which also contains composite numbers. For example, it can be used about primes in an arithmetic progression of the form <math>an + b</math>, where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|coprime]] which according to [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] contains infinitely many primes, along with infinitely many composites.\n\nFor [[integer]] ''k'' ≥ 3, an '''AP-''k''''' (also called '''PAP-''k''''') is any sequence of ''k'' primes in arithmetic progression. An AP-''k'' can be written as ''k'' primes of the form ''a''·''n'' + ''b'', for fixed integers ''a'' (called the common difference) and ''b'', and ''k'' consecutive integer values of ''n''. An AP-''k'' is usually expressed with ''n'' = 0 to ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. This can always be achieved by defining ''b'' to be the first prime in the arithmetic progression.\n\n== Properties ==\nAny given arithmetic progression of primes has a finite length. In 2004, [[Ben J. Green]] and [[Terence Tao]] settled an old [[conjecture]] by proving the [[Green–Tao theorem]]: The primes contain [[arbitrarily large|arbitrarily long]] arithmetic progressions.<ref>{{citation|doi=10.4007/annals.2008.167.481|first1=Ben|last1=Green|author1-link=Ben J. Green|first2=Terence|last2=Tao|author2-link=Terence Tao|arxiv=math.NT/0404188 |title=The primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=167|year=2008|issue=2|pages=481–547|mr=2415379}}</ref> It follows immediately that there are infinitely many AP-''k'' for any ''k''.\n\nIf an AP-''k'' does not begin with the prime ''k'', then the common difference is a multiple of the [[primorial]] ''k''# = 2·3·5·...·''j'', where ''j'' is the largest prime ≤ ''k''.\n:''Proof'': Let the AP-''k'' be ''a''·''n'' + ''b'' for ''k'' consecutive values of ''n''. If a prime ''p'' does not divide ''a'', then [[modular arithmetic]] says that ''p'' will divide every ''p'''th term of the arithmetic progression. (From H.J. Weber, Cor.10 in ``Exceptional Prime Number Twins, Triplets and Multiplets,\" arXiv:1102.3075[math.NT]. See also Theor.2.3 in ``Regularities of Twin, Triplet and Multiplet Prime Numbers,\" arXiv:1103.0447[math.NT],Global J.P.A.Math 8(2012), in press.) If the AP is prime for ''k'' consecutive values, then ''a'' must therefore be divisible by all primes ''p'' &le; ''k''.\nThis also shows that an AP with common difference ''a'' cannot contain more consecutive prime terms than the value of the smallest prime that does not divide ''a''.\n\nIf ''k'' is prime then an AP-''k'' can begin with ''k'' and have a common difference which is only a multiple of (''k''&minus;1)# instead of ''k''#. (From H. J. Weber, ``Less Regular Exceptional and Repeating Prime Number Multiplets,\" arXiv:1105.4092[math.NT], Sect.3.) For example, the AP-3 with primes {3, 5, 7} and common difference 2# = 2, or the AP-5 with primes {5, 11, 17, 23, 29} and common difference 4# = 6. It is conjectured that such examples exist for all primes ''k''. {{As of|2018}}, the largest prime for which this is confirmed is ''k'' = 19, for this AP-19 found by Wojciech Iżykowski in 2013:\n:19 + 4244193265542951705·17#·n, for ''n'' = 0 to 18.<ref name=\"APrecords\" />\n\nIt follows from widely believed conjectures, such as [[Dickson's conjecture]] and some variants of the [[First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|prime k-tuple conjecture]], that if ''p'' > 2 is the smallest prime not dividing ''a'', then there are infinitely many AP-(''p''&minus;1) with common difference ''a''. For example, 5 is the smallest prime not dividing 6, so there is expected to be infinitely many AP-4 with common difference 6, which is called a [[sexy prime]] quadruplet. When ''a'' = 2, ''p'' = 3, it is the [[twin prime conjecture]], with an \"AP-2\" of 2 primes (''b'', ''b'' + 2).\n\n== Smallest primes in AP ==\n\nWe minimize the last term.<ref>[https://oeis.org/A133277 OEIS sequence A133277]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Smallest AP-''k''\n|-\n!

Retrieved 2013-10-20.</ref> and processed by 32/64bit CPUs, [[Nvidia]] [[CUDA]] GPUs, and [[Cell microprocessor]]s around the world.\n\nBefore that, the record was an AP-25 found by Raanan Chermoni and Jarosław Wróblewski on May 17, 2008:<ref name=\"APrecords\" />\n:6171054912832631 + 366384·23#·''n'', for ''n'' = 0 to 24.

Note that the largest known AP-''k'' may be the end of an AP-(''k''+1). Some record setters choose to first compute a large set of primes of form ''c''·''p''#+1 with fixed ''p'', and then search for AP's among the values of ''c'' that produced a prime. This is reflected in the expression for some records. The expression can easily be rewritten as ''a''·''n'' + ''b''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Largest known AP-''k'' {{as of|2019|05|lc=on}}<ref name=\"APrecords\">Jens Kruse Andersen, [http://primerecords.dk/aprecords.htm ''Primes in Arithmetic Progression Records''].

Note that unlike an AP-''k'', all the other numbers between the terms of the progression must be composite. For example, the AP-3 {3, 7, 11} does not qualify, because 5 is also a prime.\n\nFor an integer ''k'' ≥ 3, a '''CPAP-''k''''' is ''k'' consecutive primes in arithmetic progression. It is conjectured there are arbitrarily long CPAP's. This would imply infinitely many CPAP-''k'' for all ''k''. The middle prime in a CPAP-3 is called a [[balanced prime]]. The largest known {{as of|2018|lc=on}} has 10546 digits.\n\nThe first known CPAP-10 was found in 1998 by Manfred Toplic in the [[distributed computing]] project CP10 which was organized by Harvey Dubner, Tony Forbes, Nik Lygeros, Michel Mizony and Paul Zimmermann.<ref>H. Dubner, T. Forbes, N. Lygeros, M. Mizony, H. Nelson, P. Zimmermann, [http://www.ams.org/mcom/2002-71-239/S0025-5718-01-01374-6/home.html ''Ten consecutive primes in arithmetic progression''], [[Mathematics of Computation]] 71 (2002), 1323–1328.</ref> This CPAP-10 has the smallest possible common difference, 7# = 210. The only other known CPAP-10 as of 2018 was found by the same people in 2008.\n\nIf a CPAP-11 exists then it must have a common difference which is a multiple of 11# = 2310. The difference between the first and last of the 11 primes would therefore be a multiple of 23100. The requirement for at least 23090 composite numbers between the 11 primes makes it appear extremely hard to find a CPAP-11. Dubner and Zimmermann estimate it would be at least 10<sup>12</sup> times harder than a CPAP-10.<ref>Manfred Toplic, [http://members.aon.at/toplicm/cp09.html ''The nine and ten primes project''].

The first few such ''k'' are 21, 34, 76, 89, 131, 144, ... However, all these ''k'' < 144 are also trivial ''k'' (i. e. gcd(''k'' − 1, 109 − 1) is not 1). Thus, the smallest Riesel number base 109 is 144. (The Riesel base 109 conjecture is not proven, it has one remaining ''k'', namely 84)\n\nExample 5: If ''k'' is square, then ''k''×49<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 has algebraic factors for all positive integer ''n''. The first few positive squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ... However, all these ''k'' < 36 are also trivial ''k'' (i. e. gcd(''k'' − 1, 49 − 1) is not 1). Thus, the smallest Riesel number base 49 is 36. (The Riesel base 49 conjecture is proven)\n\nWe want to find and proof the smallest Riesel number base ''b'' for every integer ''b'' ≥ 2. It is a conjecture that if ''k'' is a Riesel number base ''b'', then at least one of the three conditions holds:\n# All numbers of the form ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 have a factor in some covering set. (For example, ''b'' = 22, ''k'' = 4461, then all numbers of the form ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 have a factor in the covering set: {5, 23, 97})\n# ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 has algebraic factors. (For example, ''b'' = 9, ''k'' = 4, then ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 can be factored to (2×3<sup>''n''</sup> − 1) × (2×3<sup>''n''</sup> + 1))\n# For some ''n'', numbers of the form ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 have a factor in some covering set; and for all other ''n'', ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 has algebraic factors. (For example, ''b'' = 19, ''k'' = 144, then if ''n'' is odd, then ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 is divisible by 5, if ''n'' is even, then ''k''×''b''<sup>''n''</sup> − 1 can be factored to (12×19<sup>''n''/2</sup> − 1) × (12×19<sup>''n''/2</sup> + 1))\n\nIn the following list, we only consider those positive integers ''k'' such that gcd(''k'' − 1, ''b'' − 1) = 1, and all integer ''n'' must be ≥ 1.\n\nNote: ''k''-values that are a multiple of ''b'' and where ''k''−1 is not prime are included in the conjectures (and included in the remaining ''k'' with {{color|red|red}} color if no primes are known for these ''k''-values) but excluded from testing (Thus, never be the ''k'' of \"largest 5 primes found\"), since such ''k''-values will have the same prime as ''k'' / ''b''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|''b''\n|conjectured smallest Riesel ''k''\n|covering set / algebraic factors\n|remaining ''k'' with no known primes (red indicates the ''k''-values that are a multiple of ''b'' and ''k''−1 is not prime)\n|number of remaining ''k'' with no known primes<br>(excluding the red ''k''s)\n|testing limit of ''n''<br>(excluding the red ''k''s)\n|largest 5 primes found<br>(excluding red ''k''s)\n|-\n|2\n|509203\n|{3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}\n|2293, {{color|red|4586}}, {{color|red|9172}}, 9221, {{color|red|18344}}, {{color|red|18442}}, 23669, 31859, {{color|red|36688}}, {{color|red|36884}}, 38473, 46663, {{color|red|47338}}, {{color|red|63718}}, 67117, {{color|red|73376}}, {{color|red|73768}}, 74699, {{color|red|76946}}, 81041, {{color|red|93326}}, 93839, {{color|red|94676}}, 97139, 107347, 121889, {{color|red|127436}}, 129007, {{color|red|134234}}, 143047, 146561, {{color|red|146752}}, {{color|red|147536}}, {{color|red|149398}}, {{color|red|153892}}, 161669, {{color|red|162082}}, {{color|red|186652}}, {{color|red|187678}}, {{color|red|189352}}, 192971, {{color|red|194278}}, 206039, 206231, {{color|red|214694}}, 215443, 226153, 234343, {{color|red|243778}}, 245561, 250027, {{color|red|254872}}, {{color|red|258014}}, {{color|red|268468}}, {{color|red|286094}}, {{color|red|293122}}, {{color|red|293504}}, {{color|red|295072}}, {{color|red|298796}}, {{color|red|307784}}, 315929, 319511, {{color|red|323338}}, 324011, {{color|red|324164}}, 325123, 327671, 336839, 342847, 344759, 351134, 362609, 363343, 364903, 365159, 368411, 371893, {{color|red|373304}}, {{color|red|375356}}, {{color|red|378704}}, 384539, {{color|red|385942}}, 386801, {{color|red|388556}}, 397027, 409753, {{color|red|412078}}, {{color|red|412462}}, {{color|red|429388}}, {{color|red|430886}}, 444637, {{color|red|452306}}, {{color|red|468686}}, 470173, 474491, 477583, 478214, 485557, {{color|red|487556}}, {{color|red|491122}}, 494743, {{color|red|500054}}\n|49\n|''k'' = 351134 and 478214 at ''n'' = 4.7M, ''k'' = 342847 and 444637 at ''n'' = 10M.

Pomerance was a [[mathematician]] at the [[University of Georgia]] at the time Aaron (a member of the nearby [[Atlanta Braves]]) broke Ruth's record, and the student of one of Pomerance's colleagues noticed that the sums of the prime factors of 714 and 715 were equal.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCq04N9it8U Aaron Numbers -- Numberphile]</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nIf only distinct [[Prime number|prime]] [[divisor|factor]]s are counted, the first few Ruth–Aaron pairs are:\n\n:([[5 (number)|5]], [[6 (number)|6]]), ([[24 (number)|24]], [[25 (number)|25]]), ([[49 (number)|49]], [[50 (number)|50]]), ([[77 (number)|77]], [[78 (number)|78]]), ([[104 (number)|104]], [[105 (number)|105]]), ([[153 (number)|153]], [[154 (number)|154]]), (369, 370), (492, 493), (714, 715), (1682, 1683), (2107, 2108)\n\n(The lesser of each pair is listed in {{OEIS2C|id=A006145}}).\n\nCounting repeated prime factors (e.g., 8 = 2×2×2 and 9 = 3×3 with 2+2+2 = 3+3), the first few Ruth–Aaron pairs are:\n\n:([[5 (number)|5]], [[6 (number)|6]]), ([[8 (number)|8]], [[9 (number)|9]]), ([[15 (number)|15]], [[16 (number)|16]]), (77, 78), ([[125 (number)|125]], [[126 (number)|126]]), (714, 715), (948, 949), (1330, 1331)\n\n(The lesser of each pair is listed in {{OEIS2C|id=A039752}}).\n\nThe intersection of the two lists begins:\n\n:(5, 6), (77, 78), (714, 715), (5405, 5406).\n\n(The lesser of each pair is listed in {{OEIS2C|id=A039753}}).\n\nAny Ruth–Aaron pair of [[square-free integer]]s belongs to both lists with the same sum of prime factors.

In 1960, [[Wacław Sierpiński]] proved that there are [[Infinity|infinitely]] many odd [[integer]]s ''k'' which have this property.\n\nIn other words, when ''k'' is a Sierpiński number, all members of the following [[Set (mathematics)|set]] are composite:\n\n:<math>\\left\\{\\,k\\cdot{}2^n + 1 : n \\in\\mathbb{N}\\,\\right\\}.</math>\n\nNumbers in such a set with odd ''k'' and {{nowrap|''k'' < 2<sup>''n''</sup>}} are [[Proth number]]s. If the form instead is <math>k \\times 2^n  - 1 </math>, then ''k'' is a [[Riesel number]].\n\n==Known Sierpiński numbers==\nThe sequence of currently ''known'' Sierpiński numbers begins with:\n: 78557, 271129, 271577, 322523, 327739, 482719, 575041, 603713, 903983, 934909, 965431, 1259779, 1290677, 1518781, 1624097, 1639459, 1777613, 2131043, 2131099, 2191531, 2510177, 2541601, 2576089, 2931767, 2931991, ... {{OEIS|id=A076336}}.\n\nThe number 78557 was proved to be a Sierpiński number by [[John Selfridge]] in 1962, who showed that all numbers of the form {{nowrap|78557⋅2<sup>''n''</sup> + 1}} have a [[factorization|factor]] in the [[covering set]] {{math|{3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}}}. For another known Sierpiński number, 271129, the covering set is {{math|{3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}}}. Most currently known Sierpiński numbers possess similar covering sets.<ref name=\"PG\">[http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=SierpinskiNumber Sierpinski number at The Prime Glossary]</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1995 A. S. Izotov showed that some fourth powers could be proved to be Sierpiński numbers without establishing a covering set for all values of ''n''. His proof depends on the [[aurifeuillean factorization]] {{math|1=''t''<sup>''4''</sup>⋅2<sup>''4m+2''</sup> + 1 = (''t''<sup>''2''</sup>⋅2<sup>''2m+1''</sup> + ''t''⋅2<sup>''m+1''</sup> + 1)⋅(''t''<sup>''2''</sup>⋅2<sup>''2m+1''</sup> - ''t''⋅2<sup>''m+1''</sup> + 1)}}.

That is, for every odd ''k'' below 78,557 there exists a positive integer ''n'' such that ''k''2<sup>''n''</sup>+1 is prime.<ref name=\"PG\" /> {{As of|2018|11}}, there are only five candidates:\n: ''k'' = 21181, 22699, 24737, 55459, and 67607\nwhich have not been eliminated as possible Sierpiński numbers.<ref>[http://primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=1647 Seventeen or Bust] at [[PrimeGrid]].</ref>\n\n==Prime Sierpiński problem==\n\nIn 1976, Nathan Mendelsohn determined that the second provable Sierpiński number is the prime ''k = 271129''. The '''prime Sierpiński problem''' asks \"what is the smallest prime Sierpiński number\", and there is an ongoing \"Prime Sierpiński search\" which tries to prove that ''271129'' is the first Sierpiński number which is also a prime. The prime values of ''k'' less than ''271129'' for which a prime of the form ''k''2<sup>''n''</sup>+1 is not known {{As of|2018|11}} are:\n: ''k'' = 22699, 67607, 79309, 79817, 152267, 156511, 222113, 225931, 237019.\nThe first two, being less than 78557, are also unsolved cases of the (non-prime) Sierpiński problem described above.\n\n==Extended Sierpiński problem==\n\nSuppose that both preceding Sierpiński problems had finally been solved, showing that 78557 is the smallest Sierpiński number and that 271129 is the smallest prime Sierpiński number. This still leaves unsolved the question of the ''second'' Sierpinski number; there could exist a composite Sierpiński number ''k'' such that <math>78557 < k < 271129</math>. A ongoing search is trying to prove that 271129 is the second Sierpiński number, by testing all ''k'' values between 78557 and 271129, prime or not.\n\nSolving the extended Sierpiński problem, the most demanding of the three posed problems, requires the elimination of 19 remaining candidates <math>k < 271129</math>, of which nine are prime (see above) and ten are composite.

Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines is not unexpected, as lines in the spiral correspond to [[Quadratic function|quadratic polynomials]], and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's [[Formula for primes#Prime formulas and polynomial functions|prime-generating polynomial]] ''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' + 41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers.{{sfn|Stein|Ulam|Wells|1964|p=517}}{{sfn|Gardner|1964|p=124}}  Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with major unsolved problems in [[number theory]] such as [[Landau's problems]].  In particular, no quadratic polynomial has ever been proved to generate infinitely many primes, much less to have a high asymptotic density of them, although there is a well-supported [[#Hardy and Littlewood's Conjecture F|conjecture]] as to what that asymptotic density should be.\n\nIn 1932, more than thirty years prior to Ulam's discovery, the [[herpetologist]] [[Laurence Monroe Klauber|Laurence M. Klauber]] constructed a triangular, non-spiral array containing vertical and diagonal lines exhibiting a similar concentration of prime numbers.  Like Ulam, Klauber noted the connection with prime-generating polynomials, such as Euler's.{{sfn|Daus|1932|p=373}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe Ulam spiral is constructed by writing the positive integers in a [[spiral]] arrangement on a [[square lattice]]:\n[[Image:Ulam spiral howto all numbers.svg|200px|center|Numbers from 1 to 49 placed in spiral order]]\nand then marking the prime numbers:\n[[Image:Ulam spiral howto primes only.svg|200px|center|Small Ulam spiral]]\n\nIn the figure, primes appear to concentrate along certain diagonal lines.  In the 200×200 Ulam spiral shown above, diagonal lines are clearly visible, confirming that the pattern continues. Horizontal and vertical lines with a high density of primes, while less prominent, are also evident.  Most often, the number spiral is started with the number 1 at the center, but it is possible to start with any number, and the same concentration of primes along diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines is observed.  Starting with 41 at the center gives a diagonal containing an unbroken string of 40 primes (from 1523 to 1601), the longest example of its kind{{sfn|Mollin|1996|p=21}}.  Part of this diagonal is shown in the spiral below, with blue background corresponding to primes, green to squares of prime numbers, and red to numbers with 25 or more divisors.\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\n<center>\n{{Ulam spiral|51|41}}\n</center>\n</div>\n\n==History==\nAccording to Gardner, Ulam discovered the spiral in 1963 while doodling during the presentation of \"a long and very boring paper\" at a scientific meeting.{{sfn|Gardner|1964|p=122}}  These hand calculations amounted to \"a few hundred points\".  Shortly afterwards, Ulam, with collaborators Myron Stein and Mark Wells, used [[MANIAC II]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] to extend the calculation to about 100,000 points.  The group also computed the density of primes among numbers up to 10,000,000 along some of the prime-rich lines as well as along some of the prime-poor lines.  Images of the spiral up to 65,000 points were displayed on \"a scope attached to the machine\" and then photographed.{{sfn|Stein|Ulam|Wells|1964|p=520}}  The Ulam spiral was described in Martin Gardner's March 1964 ''Mathematical Games'' column in ''Scientific American''  and featured on the front cover of that issue.  Some of the photographs of Stein, Ulam, and Wells were reproduced in the column.\n\nIn an addendum to the ''Scientific American'' column, Gardner mentioned the earlier paper of Klauber.{{sfn|Gardner|1971|p=88}}<ref>{{citation\n | title = Guide to the Martin Gardner papers\n | last=Hartwig |first = Daniel \n | publisher = The Online Archive of California\n | year = 2013\n | page = 117\n | url = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6s20356s/\n}}.</ref>\nKlauber describes his construction as follows, \"The integers are arranged in triangular order with 1 at the apex, the second line containing numbers 2 to 4, the third 5 to 9, and so forth.  When the primes have been indicated, it is found that there are concentrations in certain vertical and diagonal lines, and amongst these the so-called Euler sequences with high concentrations of primes are discovered.\"{{sfn|Daus|1932|p=373}} \n\n==Explanation==\nDiagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines in the number spiral correspond to polynomials of the form\n: <math>f(n) = 4 n^2 + b n + c</math>\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' are integer constants.  When ''b'' is even, the lines are diagonal, and either all numbers are odd, or all are even, depending on the value of ''c''.  It is therefore no surprise that all primes other than 2 lie in alternate diagonals of the Ulam spiral.  Some  polynomials, such as <math>4 n^2 + 8 n + 3</math>, while producing only odd values, factorize over the integers <math>(4 n^2 + 8 n + 3=(2n+1)(2n+3))</math> and are therefore never prime except possibly when one of the factors equals 1. Such examples correspond to diagonals that are devoid of primes or nearly so.\n\nTo gain insight into why some of the remaining odd diagonals may have a higher concentration of primes than others, consider <math>4 n^2 + 6 n + 1</math> and <math>4 n^2 + 6 n + 5</math>. Compute remainders upon division by 3 as ''n'' takes successive values 0, 1, 2, ….  For the first of these polynomials, the sequence of remainders is 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, …, while for the second, it is 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, …. This implies that in the sequence of values taken by the second polynomial, two out of every three are divisible by 3, and hence certainly not prime, while in the sequence of values taken by the first polynomial, none are divisible by 3. Thus it seems plausible that the first polynomial will produce values with a higher density of primes than will the second. At the very least, this observation gives little reason to believe that the corresponding diagonals will be equally dense with primes. One should, of course, consider divisibility by primes other than 3. Examining divisibility by 5 as well, remainders upon division by 15 repeat with pattern 1, 11, 14, 10, 14, 11, 1, 14, 5, 4, 11, 11, 4, 5, 14 for the first polynomial, and with pattern 5, 0, 3, 14, 3, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 9, 3 for the second, implying that only three out of 15 values in the second sequence are potentially prime (being divisible by neither 3 nor 5), while 12 out of 15 values in the first sequence are potentially prime (since only three are divisible by 5 and none are divisible by 3).\n\nWhile rigorously-proved results about primes in quadratic sequences are scarce, considerations like those above give rise to a plausible conjecture on the asymptotic density of primes in such sequences, which is described in the next section.\n\n==Hardy and Littlewood's Conjecture F==\nIn their 1923 paper on the [[Goldbach's conjecture|Goldbach Conjecture]], [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[John Edensor Littlewood|Littlewood]] stated a series of conjectures, one of which, if true, would explain some of the striking features of the Ulam spiral. This conjecture, which Hardy and Littlewood called \"Conjecture F\", is a special case of the [[Bateman–Horn conjecture]] and asserts an asymptotic formula for the number of primes of the form ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c''. Rays emanating from the central region of the Ulam spiral making angles of 45° with the horizontal and vertical correspond to numbers of the form 4''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' with ''b'' even; horizontal and vertical rays correspond to numbers of the same form with ''b'' odd. Conjecture F provides a formula that can be used to estimate the density of primes along such rays. It implies that there will be considerable variability in the density along different rays. In particular, the density is highly sensitive to the [[discriminant]] of the polynomial, ''b''<sup>2</sup> − 16''c''.\n\n[[Image:Ulam 2.png|250px|thumb|The primes of the form 4''x''<sup>2</sup> − 2''x'' + 41 with ''x'' = 0, 1, 2, ... have been highlighted in purple. The prominent parallel line in the lower half of the figure corresponds to 4''x''<sup>2</sup> + 2''x'' + 41 or, equivalently, to negative values of ''x''.]]\nConjecture F is concerned with polynomials of the form ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are integers and ''a'' is positive. If the coefficients contain a common factor greater than 1 or if the discriminant Δ = ''b''<sup>2</sup> − 4''ac'' is a [[square number|perfect square]], the polynomial factorizes and therefore produces [[composite numbers]] as ''x'' takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... (except possibly for one or two values of ''x'' where one of the factors equals 1). Moreover, if ''a'' + ''b'' and ''c'' are both even, the polynomial produces only even values, and is therefore composite except possibly for the value 2. Hardy and Littlewood assert that, apart from these situations, ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' takes prime values infinitely often as ''x'' takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This statement is a special case of an earlier [[Bunyakovsky conjecture|conjecture of Bunyakovsky]] and remains open. Hardy and Littlewood further assert that, asymptotically, the number ''P''(''n'') of primes of the form ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c'' and less than ''n'' is given by\n\n: <math>P(n)\\sim A\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\log n}</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' depends on ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' but not on ''n''. By the [[prime number theorem]], this formula with ''A'' set equal to one is the asymptotic number of primes less than ''n'' expected in a random set of numbers having the same density as the set of numbers of the form ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c''. But since ''A'' can take values bigger or smaller than 1, some polynomials, according to the conjecture, will be especially rich in primes, and others especially poor. An unusually rich polynomial is 4''x''<sup>2</sup> − 2''x'' + 41 which forms a visible line in the Ulam spiral. The constant ''A'' for this polynomial is approximately 6.6, meaning that the numbers it generates are almost seven times as likely to be prime as random numbers of comparable size, according to the conjecture. This particular polynomial is related to Euler's [[Formula for primes#Prime formulas and polynomial functions|prime-generating polynomial]] ''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' + 41 by replacing ''x'' with 2''x'', or equivalently, by restricting ''x'' to the even numbers. The constant ''A'' is given by a product running over all prime numbers,\n\n: <math> A = \\prod\\limits_{p} \\frac{p-\\omega(p)}{p-1}~</math>,\n\nin which <math>\\omega (p)</math> is number of zeros of the quadratic polynomial [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''p'' and therefore takes one of the values 0, 1, or 2.  Hardy and Littlewood break the product into three factors as\n\n: <math>A = \\varepsilon\\prod_p \\biggl(\\frac{p}{p-1}\\biggr)\\,\\prod_{\\varpi}\\biggl(1-\\frac{1}{\\varpi-1}\\Bigl(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\varpi}\\Bigr)\\biggr)</math>.\n\nHere the factor ε, corresponding to the prime 2, is 1 if ''a'' + ''b'' is odd and 2 if ''a'' + ''b'' is even. The first product index ''p'' runs over the finitely-many odd primes dividing both ''a'' and ''b''.  For these primes <math>\\omega (p)=0</math> since  ''p'' then cannot divide ''c''. The second product index <math>\\varpi</math> runs over the infinitely-many odd primes not dividing ''a''.

As in the Ulam spiral, quadratic polynomials generate numbers that lie in straight lines. Vertical lines correspond to numbers of the form ''k''<sup>2</sup> − ''k'' + ''M''. Vertical and diagonal lines with a high density of prime numbers are evident in the figure.\n\nRobert Sacks devised a variant of the Ulam spiral in 1994. In the Sacks spiral, the non-negative integers are plotted on an [[Archimedean spiral]] rather than the square spiral used by Ulam, and are spaced so that one [[square number|perfect square]] occurs in each full rotation. (In the Ulam spiral, two squares occur in each rotation.) Euler's prime-generating polynomial, ''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''x'' + 41, now appears as a single curve as ''x'' takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This curve asymptotically approaches a horizontal line in the left half of the figure. (In the Ulam spiral, Euler's polynomial forms two diagonal lines, one in the top half of the figure, corresponding to even values of ''x'' in the sequence, the other in the bottom half of the figure corresponding to odd values of ''x'' in the sequence.)\n<!-- [http://www.numberspiral.com Robert Sacks' web site] Don't download software: contains four trojan horses. -->\n<!-- Might be nice to include above as citation, if trojan horse issue is resolved. -->\n\nAdditional structure may be seen when [[composite number]]s are also included in the Ulam spiral. The number 1 has only a single factor, itself; each prime number has two factors, itself and 1; composite numbers are divisible by at least three different factors. Using the size of the dot representing an integer to indicate the number of factors and coloring prime numbers red and composite numbers blue produces the figure shown.\n\nSpirals following other tilings of the plane also generate lines rich in prime numbers, for example hexagonal spirals.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:KlauberTriangle.png|Klauber triangle with prime numbers generated by Euler's polynomial ''x''<sup>2</sup>  −  ''x''  +  41 highlighted.\nImage:Sacks spiral.svg|Sacks spiral.\nFile:Spirale Ulam 150.jpg|Ulam spiral of size 150×150 showing both prime and composite numbers.\nFile:Hexgrid prime number sprial.svg|Hexagonal number spiral with prime numbers in green and more highly composite numbers in darker shades of blue.\nFile:Ulamtriangle.png|Number spiral with 7503 primes visible on regular triangle.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pattern recognition]]\n* [[Prime k-tuple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Daus | first1 = P.

This improves the safety of storing, transporting, and disposing of the weapon. Commonly, firing the munition removes a barrier between two precursors. These react to form the intended agent which is then [[aerosol]]ized and distributed by a bursting charge.\n\nBinary chemical weapons are chemical weapons within the scope of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] and therefore their production, use and stockpiling is forbidden in most countries, as at least one of the individual chemicals is likely to be a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1]] chemical for which large scale production is forbidden.\n\n==Examples==\nOne example of a binary chemical weapon is the [[United States Army]] [[M687]]. In the M687, [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] (military name: DF, a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1]] chemical) and a mixture of two agents held in chambers within the munition, separated by a partition.  When the weapon is fired, [[acceleration]] causes the partition to break, and the precursors are mixed by the rotation of the munition in flight, producing [[sarin]] nerve agent.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] and later [[Russian Federation]] experimented with binary munitions capable of mixing and distributing two agents that would work together in worsening the weapon's effects, an example of which would be the combination of [[nerve agents]] with [[blister agents]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe director of a non-[[Chemical weapon proliferation|proliferation]] research program of the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey]] has stated that the [[death of Kim Jong-nam]] due to poisoning with VX was likely carried out with a binary version of the agent, since VX fumes would otherwise have killed the suspected attackers.<ref>{{cite news|first= Justin |last= McCurry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/what-is-vx-nerve-agent-killed-kim-jong-nam-north-korea |title=What is the VX nerve agent that killed North Korean Kim Jong-nam? |work= [[The Guardian]] |date=2017-02-20 |accessdate=2017-02-25}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nA miniature binary weapon is used in an [[assassination]] in the [[Frederick Forsyth]] novel ''[[The Devil's Alternative]]''.

The substances mix after the halves are assembled and the seal between them is broken, and form [[hydrogen cyanide]]. The surplus acid eats through the capsule walls of the non-resistant half, and after a delay of several hours, the lethal content is released into the [[intestinal tract]] of whoever ingested it.\n\nWhile technically possible, the assassination tool as discussed in the novel is presumably fictional. However, there are claims that in September 2003, the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (Russian Foreign Intelligence Service) prepared to assassinate [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] with a similar device.<ref>Goldfarb & Litvinenko (2007)</ref>\n\nIn the 10th and 11th episodes of the 6th season of TV-series ''[[Dexter_(TV_series)|Dexter]]'' are shown preparation and application of binary weapon consisting of two containers filled with [[Methylphosphonyl difluoride |DF]] and [[isopropyl alcohol]]. When mixed, the two substances form [[sarin]].\n\nThe 2002 movie ''[[xXx (film)|xXx]]'' features a Soviet-made binary chemical weapon codenamed \"Silent Night\", after its supposed ability to render an area silent by killing its inhabitants. In the movie, the chemical was acquired by the terrorist group Anarchy-99, and their leader, Yorgi, plans to launch missiles containing Silent Night from an autonomous solar-powered submarine called Ahab, with the intent to sow chaos among civilized nations as they all blame each other for the attacks.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Binary liquid]]\n*[[QL (chemical)]] (Isopropyl aminoethylmethyl phosphonite)\n*[[Mubtakkar]]\n*[[Binary explosive]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{aut|[[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Goldfarb, Alexander]] & Litvinenko, Marina}} (2007): ''[[Death of a dissident]]: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB''.

The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as [[bit]]s, to each character, instruction, etc. For example, a binary [[string (computer science)|string]] of eight bits can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items.\n\nIn computing and telecommunications, binary codes are used for various methods of [[encoding]] data, such as [[character string]]s, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width or [[variable-length code|variable-width]] strings. In a fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that bit string, interpreted as a [[binary number]], is usually displayed in code tables in [[octal]], [[decimal]] or [[hexadecimal]] notation.

''The Analysis of Music'', p.50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.</ref>]]\n\n'''Binary form''' is a [[musical form]] in 2 related sections, both of which are usually repeated. Binary is also a structure used to choreograph [[dance]]. In music this is usually performed as A-A-B-B.\n\nBinary form was popular during the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], often used to structure movements of [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[sonata (music)|sonatas]]. It was also used for short, one-movement works.  Around the middle of the 18th century, the form largely fell from use as the principal design of entire movements as [[sonata form]] and organic [[musical development|development]] gained prominence. When it is found in later works, it usually takes the form of the theme in a set of [[variation form|variation]]s, or the [[Minuet]], [[Scherzo]], or Trio sections of a \"minuet and trio\" or \"scherzo and trio\" movement in a [[sonata]], [[symphony]], etc. Many larger forms incorporate binary structures, and many more complicated forms (such as the 18th-century [[sonata form]]) share certain characteristics with binary form.\n\n==Structure==\nMost strictly, a piece in binary form is characterized by two complementary, related sections of roughly equal duration, which come up frequently. The first section will start in a certain [[key (music)|key]], and will usually [[Modulation (music)|modulate]] to a [[closely related key|related key]]:\n*compositions in major keys will typically modulate to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]], the fifth scale degree above the [[tonic (music)|tonic]]\n*compositions in minor keys will typically modulate to the [[relative key|relative major]], the major key centered on the third scale degree above the tonic; alternatively the first section could close in the dominant minor, or with an imperfect [[cadence (music)|cadence]] in the original key.\n\nThe second section of the piece begins in the newly established key, where it remains for an indefinite period of time. After some  harmonic activity, the piece will eventually modulate back to its original key before ending. More often than not, especially in 18th-century compositions, the A and B sections are separated by [[bar (music)|double bars]] with repeat signs, meaning both sections were to be repeated.<ref>Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010).  Graduate Review of Tonal Theory.  New York: Oxford University Press, pg 156.  {{ISBN|978-0-19-537698-2}}</ref>\n\nBinary form is usually characterised as having the form ''AB'', though since both sections repeat, a more accurate description would be ''AABB''.  Others, however, prefer to use the label ''AA′''.  This second designation points to the fact that there is no great change in character between the two sections. The [[rhythm]]s and [[melody|melodic]] material used will generally be closely related in each section, and if the piece is written for a [[musical ensemble]], the [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] will generally be the same. This is in contrast to the use of [[verse-chorus form]] in [[popular music]]—the contrast between the two sections is primarily one of the keys used.\n\n==Further distinctions==\nA piece in binary form can be further classified according to a number of characteristics:\n\n===Simple vs. rounded=== <!--[[Minuet form]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Oh, Susannah rounded binary form.png|thumb|400px|\"[[Oh! Susanna|Oh, Susannah]]\": rounded binary form.<ref>Kostka, Stefan and Payne, Dorothy (1995). ''Tonal Harmony'', p.343. 3rd edition, McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-035874-5}}.</ref> {{audio|Oh, Susannah rounded binary form.mid|Play}}]]\n\nOccasionally, the ''B'' section will end with a \"return\" of the opening material from the ''A'' section.  This is referred to as '''rounded binary''', and is labeled as ''ABA''<nowiki>′</nowiki>.  In rounded binary, the beginning of the ''B'' section is sometimes referred to as the \"bridge\", and will usually conclude with a [[cadence (music)|half cadence]] in the original key. Rounded binary is not to be confused with [[ternary form]], also labeled ''ABA''—the difference being that, in ternary form, the ''B'' section contrasts completely with the ''A'' material as in, for example, a [[Minuet|minuet and trio]]. Another important difference between the rounded and ternary form is that in rounded binary, when the \"A\" section returns, it will typically contain only half of the full \"A\" period, whereas ternary form will end with the full \"A\" section.\n\nSometimes, as in the keyboard sonatas of [[Domenico Scarlatti]], the return of the ''A'' theme may include much of the original ''A'' section in the tonic key, so much so that some of his sonatas can be regarded as precursors of sonata form. \n\nRounded binary form is sometimes referred to as small ternary form.<ref name=\"Schoenberg\">Schoenberg, Arnold (1967). ''Fundamentals of Musical Composition'', p.119. {{ISBN|0-571-09276-4}}.</ref>\n\nRounded binary or '''minuet form''':<ref name=\"Rosen\">Rosen, Charles (1988).

(1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p.51-52. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.</ref>\n\n===Sectional vs. continuous===\n[[File:Greensleeves sectional binary form.png|thumb|400px|\"Greensleeves\": sectional binary form (first phrase ends with the tonic).<ref>Kostka and Payne (1995), p.336.<!--ibid.--></ref> {{audio|Greensleeves sectional binary form.mid|Play}}]]. Note:  the example here is in minor mode rather than the more historically accurate Dorian mode.\n\nIf the ''A'' section ends with an Authentic (or Perfect) [[cadence (music)|cadence]] in the original [[tonic (music)|tonic]] key of the piece, the design is referred to as a '''sectional binary'''.  This refers to the fact that the piece is in different tonal sections, each beginning in their own respective keys.\n\nIf the ''A'' section ends with any other kind of cadence, the design is referred to as a '''continuous binary'''.  This refers to the fact that the ''B'' section will \"continue on\" with the new key established by the cadence at the end of ''A''.\n\n===Symmetrical vs. asymmetrical===\nIf the ''A'' and ''B'' sections are roughly equal in length, the design is referred to as '''symmetrical'''.\n\nIf the ''A'' and ''B'' sections are of unequal length, the design is referred to as '''asymmetrical'''.  In such cases, the ''B'' section is usually substantially longer than the ''A'' section.\n\nThe asymmetrical binary form begins to be more common than the symmetrical type from about the time of Beethoven onwards, and is almost routine in the main sections of Minuet and Trio or Scherzo and Trio movements in the works of many composers from Beethoven onwards.  In such cases, occasionally only the first section of the binary structure is marked to be repeated.\n\nAlthough most of [[Chopin nocturnes|Chopin's nocturne]]s are in an overall [[ternary form]], quite often the individual sections (either the A, the B, or both) are in binary form, most often of the asymmetrical variety.  If a section of this binary structure is repeated, in this case it is written out again in full, usually considerably varied, rather than enclosed between repeat signs.\n\n===Balanced binary===\nBalanced binary is when the end of the first section and the end of the second section have analogous material and are\norganized in a parallel way.\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{musical form}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binary Form}}\n[[Category:Musical form]]\n[[Category:2 (number)]]"

In computer science, this identification between a function from ''X'' × ''Y'' to ''Z'' and a function from ''X'' to ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup>, where ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup> is the set of all functions from ''Y'' to ''Z'', is called ''[[currying]]''.\n\n==Generalisations==\nThe various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions.\nFor example, the division example above is ''[[surjective function|surjective]]'' (or ''onto'') because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number.\nThis example is ''[[injective function|injective]]'' in each input separately, because the functions ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup> and ''f'' <sub>''y''</sub> are always injective.\nHowever, it's not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) ''f'' (2,4) = ''f'' (1,2).\n\nOne can also consider ''partial'' binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs.\nFor example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from '''Z''' and '''N''' to '''Q''', where '''N''' is the set of all natural numbers, including zero.\nBut this function is undefined when the second input is zero.\n\nA [[binary operation]] is a binary function where the sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are all equal; binary operations are often used to define [[algebraic structure]]s.\n\nIn [[linear algebra]], a [[bilinear operator|bilinear transformation]] is a binary function where the sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are all [[vector space]]s and the derived functions ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup> and ''f''<sub>''y''</sub> are all [[linear transformation]]s.\nA bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from ''X'' × ''Y'' to ''Z'', but this function in general won't be linear.\nHowever, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the [[tensor product]] <math>X \\otimes Y</math> to ''Z''.\n\n==Generalisations to ternary and other functions==\n{{see also|Multivariate function}}\nThe concept of binary function generalises to ''ternary'' (or ''3-ary'') ''function'', ''quaternary'' (or ''4-ary'') ''function'', or more generally to ''n-ary function'' for any [[natural number]] ''n''.\nA ''0-ary function'' to ''Z'' is simply given by an element of ''Z''.\nOne can also define an ''A-ary function'' where ''A'' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]]; there is one input for each element of ''A''.\n\n==Category theory==\nIn [[category theory]], ''n''-ary functions generalise to ''n''-ary morphisms in a [[multicategory]].\nThe interpretation of an ''n''-ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original ''n''-ary morphism will work in a [[monoidal category]].\nThe construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a [[closed monoidal category]].\nThe category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binary Function}}\n[[Category:Types of functions]]\n[[Category:2 (number)]]"

The color used for the object(s) in the image is the foreground color while the rest of the image is the background color.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.codersource.net/csharp_color_image_to_binary.aspx |title=Conversion of a Color Image to a Binary Image |publisher=CoderSource.net |date=2005-04-18 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610170124/http://www.codersource.net/csharp_color_image_to_binary.aspx |archivedate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In the document-scanning industry, this is often referred to as \"bi-tonal\".\n\nBinary images are also called ''bi-level'' or ''two-level''. This means that each pixel is stored as a single bit—i.e., a 0 or 1. The names ''black-and-white'', ''B&amp;W'', [[monochrome]] or [[monochrome|monochromatic]] are often used for this concept, but may also designate any images that have only one sample per pixel, such as [[Grayscale|grayscale images]]. In [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] parlance, a binary image is the same as an image in \"Bitmap\" mode.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.graphics.com/article-old/photoshop-fundamentals-working-different-color-modes |title= Photoshop Fundamentals: Working With Different Color Modes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.graphics.com/article-old/photoshop-fundamentals-working-different-color-modes|title=Photoshop Fundamentals: Working in Different Color Modes|work=Graphics.com|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBinary images often arise in [[digital image processing]] as [[Mask (computing)#Image masks|masks]] or as the result of certain operations such as [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], [[Thresholding (image processing)|thresholding]], and [[dither]]ing.  Some input/output devices, such as [[laser printer]]s, [[fax|fax machines]], and bilevel [[Visual display unit|computer displays]], can only handle bilevel images.\n\nA binary image can be stored in memory as a [[bitmap]], a packed array of bits. A 640×480 image requires 37.5 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] of storage.  Because of the small size of the image files, fax machine and document management solutions usually use this format. Most binary images also compress well with simple [[Run-length encoding|run-length compression]] schemes.\n\nBinary images can be interpreted as [[subset]]s of the [[square lattice|two-dimensional integer lattice]] ''Z''<sup>2</sup>; the field of [[Mathematical morphology|morphological image processing]] was largely inspired by this view.\n\n== Operations on binary images ==\nAn entire class of operations on binary images operates on a 3×3 window of the image. This contains nine pixels, so 2<sup>9</sup> or 512 possible values. Considering only the central pixel, it is possible to define whether it remains set or unset, based on the surrounding pixels. Examples of such operations are thinning, dilating, finding branch points and endpoints, removing isolated pixels, shifting the image a pixel in any direction, and breaking H-connections. [[Conway's Game of Life]] is also an example of a 3×3 window operation.\n\nAnother class of operations is based on the notion of filtering with a structuring element. The structuring element is binary image, usually small, which is passed over the target image, in a similar manner to a filter in gray scale image processing. Since the pixels can only have two values, the morphological operations are [[mathematical morphology|erosion]] (any unset pixels within the structuring element cause the pixel to be unset) and [[mathematical morphology|dilation]] (any set pixels within the structuring element cause the pixel to be set). Important operations are [[mathematical morphology|morphological opening]] and [[mathematical morphology|morphological closing]] which consist of erosion followed by dilation and dilation followed by erosion, respectively, using the same structuring element. Opening tends to enlarge small holes, remove small objects, and separate objects. Closing retains small objects, removes holes, and joins objects.\n\nA very important characteristic of a binary image is the [[distance transform]]. This gives the distance of every set pixel from the nearest unset pixel. The distance transform can be efficiently calculated. It allows efficient computation of [[Voronoi diagrams]], where each pixel in an image is assigned to the nearest of a set of points. It also allows skeletonization, which differs from thinning in that skeletons allow recovery of the original image. The distance transform is also useful for determining the center of the object, and for matching in image recognition.\n\nAnother class of operations is gathering orientation-free metrics. This is often important in image recognition where the orientation of the camera needs to be removed. Orientation-free metrics of a group of connected or surrounded pixels include the [[Euler number]], the perimeter, the area, the compactness, the area of holes, the minimum radius, the maximum radius.\n\n=== Image segmentation ===\nBinary images are produced from color images by segmentation. Segmentation is the process of assigning each pixel in the source image to two or more classes. If there are more than two classes then the usual result is several binary images. The simplest form of segmentation is probably [[Otsu's method]] which assigns pixels to foreground or background based on greyscale intensity. Another method is the [[watershed algorithm]]. Another approach is the application of Iterative hybrid-threshold algorithms<ref>{{Citation|last=Sokratis|first=Vavilis|title=A Hybrid Binarization Technique for Document Images|date=2011|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22913-8_8|work=Learning Structure and Schemas from Documents|pages=165–179|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642229121|access-date=2019-04-28|last2=Kavallieratou|first2=Ergina|last3=Paredes|first3=Roberto|last4=Sotiropoulos|first4=Kostas}}</ref>. [[Edge detection]] also often creates a binary image with some pixels assigned to edge pixels, and is also a first step in further segmentation.\n\n=== Skeletons ===\nThinning or skeletonization produces binary images which consist of pixel-wide lines. The branchpoints and endpoints can then be extracted, and the image converted to a graph. This is important in image recognition, for example in [[optical character recognition]].\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nThe interpretation of the pixel's binary value is also device-dependent. Some systems interprets the bit value of 0 as black and 1 as white, while others reversed the meaning of the values. In the [[TWAIN]] standard PC interface for [[Image scanner|scanners]] and [[digital camera]]s, the first flavor is called ''[[Vanilla (computing)|vanilla]]'' and the reversed one ''chocolate''.\n\n[[Dither]]ing is often used for displaying [[halftone]] images.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tN5MAQAAIAAJ&q=Dithering+used+for+displaying+binary+images.&dq=Dithering+used+for+displaying+binary+images.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH4-3Z4ZPXAhWIilQKHRiBBJwQ6AEIODAD|title=Selected Papers on Digital Halftoning|last=Allebach|first=Jan P.|last2=Thompson|first2=Brian J.|date=1999|publisher=SPIE Optical Engineering Press|isbn=9780819431370|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Image sensor capture binary images ==\n[[Oversampled binary image sensor]] is a new image sensor that is reminiscent of traditional photographic film.

whether that will or will not happen. If a customer believes the price of an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a set time, the trader buys the binary option, but if he or she believes it will be below that price, they sell the option. In the U.S. exchanges, the price of a binary is always under $100.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\n[[Investopedia]] described the binary options trading process in the U.S. thus:\n\n<blockquote>[A] binary may be trading at $42.50 (bid) and $44.50 (offer) at 1 p.m. If you buy the binary option right then you will pay $44.50, if you decide to sell right then you'll sell at $42.50.\n\nLet's assume you decide to buy at $44.50. If at 1:30 p.m. the price of gold is above $1,250, your option expires and it becomes worth $100. You make a profit of $100 - $44.50 = $55.50 (less fees). This is called being \"in the money.\"\n\nBut if the price of gold is below $1,250 at 1:30 p.m., the option expires at $0. Therefore you lose the $44.50 invested. This is called being \"out of the money.\"\n\nThe bid and offer fluctuate until the option expires. You can close your position at any time before expiry to lock in a profit or a reduce a loss (compared to letting it expire out of the money).<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the U.S., every binary option settles at $100 or $0, $100 if the bet is correct, 0 if it is not.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\nIn the online binary options industry, where the contracts are sold by a broker to a customer in an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] manner, a different option pricing model is used. Brokers sell binary options at a fixed price (e.g., $100) and offer some fixed percentage return in case of in-the-money settlement. Some brokers, also offer a sort of out-of-money reward to a losing customer. For example, with a win reward of 80%, out-of-money reward of 5%, and the option price of $100, two scenarios are possible. In-the-money settlement pays back the option price of $100 and the reward of $80. In case of loss, the option price is not returned but the out-of-money reward of $5 is granted to the customer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broker’s Edge Calculator|url=https://www.binarytrading.com/brokers-edge-calculator/|website=BinaryTrading|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn non-regulated platforms, client money is not necessarily kept in a trust account, as required by government [[financial regulation]], and transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fma.gv.at/download.php?d=2747|title=FMA Focus Binary Options and CFDs|publisher=[[Financial Market Authority (Austria)]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nBinary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they are advertised as requiring little or no knowledge of the markets.

One online binary options site paid $71 for each successful $100 trade. \"If you lose, you get back $15. Let's say you make 1,000 \"trades\" and win 545 of them. Your profit is $38,695.

The Black–Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the [[skewness]] of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset <math>\\sigma</math> across all strikes, incorporating a variable one <math>\\sigma(K)</math> where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the [[volatility skew]] into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.\n\nA binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, ''C'', at strike ''K'', as an infinitesimally tight spread, where <math>C_v</math> is a vanilla European call:<ref name=\"Breeden, D.

Skew is typically negative, so the value of a binary call is higher when taking skew into account.\n:<math> C = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}} - \\mathrm{Vega}_v * \\mathrm{Skew}</math>\n\n===Relationship to vanilla options' Greeks===\nSince a binary call is a mathematical derivative of a vanilla call with respect to strike, the price of a binary call has the same shape as the delta of a vanilla call, and the delta of a binary call has the same shape as the gamma of a vanilla call.\n\n==Regulation and fraud==\n{{further|Securities fraud}}\n\nMany binary option \"brokers\" have been exposed as fraudulent operations.<ref name=\"SEC1\"/> In those cases, there is no real [[brokerage]]; the customer is betting against the broker, who is acting as a [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shop]].

Although specialized [[data structures]] designed for fast searching, such as [[hash tables]], can be searched more efficiently, binary search applies to a wider range of problems.\n\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, [[fractional cascading]] speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in [[computational geometry]] and in numerous other fields. [[Exponential search]] extends binary search to unbounded lists. The [[binary search tree]] and [[B-tree]] data structures are based on binary search.\n\n== Algorithm ==\nBinary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm B\"}}\n\n===Procedure===\nGiven an array <math>A</math> of <math>n</math> elements with values or [[Record (computer science)|records]] <math>A_0,A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_{n-1}</math>sorted such that <math>A_0 \\leq A_1 \\leq A_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq A_{n-1}</math>, and target value <math>T</math>, the following [[subroutine]] uses binary search to find the index of <math>T</math> in <math>A</math>.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm B\"}}\n# Set <math>L</math> to <math>0</math> and <math>R</math> to <math>n-1</math>.\n# If <math>L>R</math>, the search terminates as unsuccessful.\n# Set <math>m</math> (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of <math>\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to <math>\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>.\n# If <math>A_m < T</math>, set <math>L</math> to <math>m+1</math> and go to step 2.\n# If <math>A_m > T</math>, set <math>R</math> to <math>m-1</math> and go to step 2.\n# Now <math>A_m = T</math>, the search is done; return <math>m</math>.\n\nThis iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with the two variables <math>L</math> and <math>R</math>. The procedure may be expressed in [[pseudocode]] as follows, where the variable names and types remain the same as above, <code>floor</code> is the floor function, and <code>unsuccessful</code> refers to a specific value that conveys the failure of the search.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm B\"}}\n\n '''function''' binary_search(A, n, T):\n     L := 0\n     R := n − 1\n     '''while''' L <= R:\n         m := floor((L + R) / 2)\n         '''if''' A[m] < T:\n             L := m + 1\n         '''else if''' A[m] > T:\n             R := m - 1\n         '''else''':\n             '''return''' m\n     '''return''' unsuccessful\n\n==== Alternative procedure ====\nIn the above procedure, the algorithm checks whether the middle element (<math>m</math>) is equal to the target (<math>T</math>) in every iteration. Some implementations leave out this check during each iteration. The algorithm would perform this check only when one element is left (when <math>L=R</math>). This results in a faster comparison loop, as one comparison is eliminated per iteration.

If <math>A_L=T</math>, return <math>L</math>. Otherwise, the search terminates as unsuccessful.\n\n=== Duplicate elements ===\nThe procedure may return any index whose element is equal to the target value, even if there are duplicate elements in the array. For example, if the array to be searched was <math>[1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7]</math> and the target was <math>4</math>, then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4th (index 3) or 5th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4th element (index 3) in this case. It does not always return the first duplicate (consider <math>[1,2,4,4,4,5,6,7]</math> which still returns the 4th element). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element if the target value is duplicated in the array.

The root node of the tree is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search. Starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration. This represents the successive elimination of elements.<ref name=\"FloresMadpis1971\" />{{sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\nIn the worst case, binary search makes <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) + 1 \\rfloor</math> iterations of the comparison loop, where the <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\  \\rfloor</math> notation denotes the [[floor function]] that yields the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument, and <math display=\"inline\">\\log_2</math> is the [[binary logarithm]]. The worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree. This is equivalent to a binary search that has reduced to one element and always eliminates the smaller subarray out of the two in each iteration if they are not of equal size.{{Efn|This happens as binary search will not always divide the array perfectly. Take for example the array {{math|[1, 2, ..., 16]}}. The first iteration will select the midpoint of 8. On the left subarray are eight elements, but on the right are nine. If the search takes the right path, there is a higher chance that the search will make the maximum number of comparisons.{{sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}}}{{sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\nThe worst case may also be reached when the target element is not in the array.

The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely.{{Efn|Any search algorithm based solely on comparisons can be represented using a binary comparison tree. An ''internal path'' is any path from the root to an existing node. Let <math>I</math> be the ''internal path length'', the sum of the lengths of all internal paths. If each element is equally likely to be searched, the average case is <math>1 + \\frac{I}{n}</math> or simply one plus the average of all the internal path lengths of the tree. This is because internal paths represent the elements that the search algorithm compares to the target. The lengths of these internal paths represent the number of iterations ''after'' the root node. Adding the average of these lengths to the one iteration at the root yields the average case. Therefore, to minimize the average number of comparisons, the internal path length <math>I</math> must be minimized. It turns out that the tree for binary search minimizes the internal path length. {{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} proved that the ''external path'' length (the path length over all nodes where both children are present for each already-existing node) is minimized when the external nodes (the nodes with no children) lie within two consecutive levels of the tree. This also applies to internal paths as internal path length <math>I</math> is linearly related to external path length <math>E</math>. For any tree of <math>n</math> nodes, <math>I = E - 2n</math>. When each subtree has a similar number of nodes, or equivalently the array is divided into halves in each iteration, the external nodes as well as their interior parent nodes lie within two levels. It follows that binary search minimizes the number of average comparisons as its comparison tree has the lowest possible internal path length.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}}} Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over ''all'' elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\n=== Derivation of average case ===\nThe average number of iterations performed by binary search depends on the probability of each element being searched. The average case is different for successful searches and unsuccessful searches. It will be assumed that each element is equally likely to be searched for successful searches. For unsuccessful searches, it will be assumed that the [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] between and outside elements are equally likely to be searched. The average case for successful searches is the number of iterations required to search every element exactly once, divided by <math>n</math>, the number of elements. The average case for unsuccessful searches is the number of iterations required to search an element within every interval exactly once, divided by the <math>n + 1</math> intervals.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\n==== Successful searches ====\n<!-- E stands for \"expected\" -->\nIn the binary tree representation, a successful search can be represented by a path from the root to the target node, called an ''internal path''. The length of a path is the number of edges (connections between nodes) that the path passes through. The number of iterations performed by a search, given that the corresponding path has length <math>l</math>, is <math>l + 1</math> counting the initial iteration. The ''internal path length'' is the sum of the lengths of all unique internal paths. Since there is only one path from the root to any single node, each internal path represents a search for a specific element. If there are <math>n</math> elements, which is a positive integer, and the internal path length is <math>I(n)</math>, then the average number of iterations for a successful search <math>T(n) = 1 + \\frac{I(n)}{n}</math>, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\nSince binary search is the optimal algorithm for searching with comparisons, this problem is reduced to calculating the minimum internal path length of all binary trees with <math>n</math> nodes, which is equal to:{{Sfn|Knuth|1997|loc=§2.3.4.5 (\"Path length\")}}\n\n<math>\nI(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left \\lfloor \\log_2(k) \\right \\rfloor\n</math>\n\nFor example, in a 7-element array, the root requires one iteration, the two elements below the root require two iterations, and the four elements below require three iterations.

If an internal node, or a node present in the tree, has fewer than two child nodes, then additional child nodes, called external nodes, are added so that each internal node has two children. By doing so, an unsuccessful search can be represented as a path to an external node, whose parent is the single element that remains during the last iteration. An ''external path'' is a path from the root to an external node. The ''external path length'' is the sum of the lengths of all unique external paths. If there are <math>n</math> elements, which is a positive integer, and the external path length is <math>E(n)</math>, then the average number of iterations for an unsuccessful search <math>T'(n)=\\frac{E(n)}{n+1}</math>. The external path length is divided by <math>n+1</math> instead of <math>n</math> because there are <math>n+1</math> external paths, representing the intervals between and outside the elements of the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\nThis problem can similarly be reduced to determining the minimum external path length of all binary trees with <math>n</math> nodes. For all binary trees, the external path length is equal to the internal path length plus <math>2n</math>.{{Sfn|Knuth|1997|loc=§2.3.4.5 (\"Path length\")}} Substituting the equation for <math>I(n)</math>:{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\n<math>\nE(n) = I(n) + 2n = \\left[(n + 1)\\left \\lfloor \\log_2(n + 1) \\right \\rfloor - 2^{\\left \\lfloor \\log_2(n+1) \\right \\rfloor + 1} + 2\\right] + 2n = (n + 1) (\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 2) - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 1}\n</math>\n\nSubstituting the equation for <math>E(n)</math> into the equation for <math>T'(n)</math>, the average case for unsuccessful searches can be determined:{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\n<math>\nT'(n) = \\frac{(n + 1) (\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 2) - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 1}}{(n+1)} = \\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 2 - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 1}/(n + 1)\n</math>\n\n=== Performance of alternative procedure ===\nEach iteration of the binary search procedure defined above makes one or two comparisons, checking if the middle element is equal to the target in each iteration. Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) + 1 \\rfloor</math> times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but enormous <math display=\"inline\">n</math>.{{Efn|{{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} showed on his [[MIX]] computer model, intended to represent an ordinary computer, that the average running time of this variation for a successful search is <math display=\"inline\">17.5 \\log_2 n + 17</math> units of time compared to <math display=\"inline\">18 \\log_2 n - 16</math> units for regular binary search.

A [[bit array]] is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of [[bit]]s, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only <math display=\"inline\">O(1)</math> time.{{Sfn|Knuth|2011|loc=§7.1.3 (\"Bitwise Tricks and Techniques\")}}  The Judy1 type of [[Judy array]] handles 64-bit keys efficiently.<ref name=\"judyarray\">{{Citation|last1=Silverstein|first1=Alan|title=Judy IV shop manual|publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]]|url=http://judy.sourceforge.net/doc/shop_interm.pdf|pp=80–81|access-date=26 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318031801/http://judy.sourceforge.net/doc/shop_interm.pdf|archive-date=18 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor approximate results, [[Bloom filter]]s, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of keys by encoding the keys using a [[bit array]] and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with <math display=\"inline\">k</math> hash functions, membership queries require only <math display=\"inline\">O(k)</math> time. However, Bloom filters suffer from [[False positives and false negatives|false positives]].{{Efn|This is because simply setting all of the bits which the hash functions point to for a specific key can affect queries for other keys which have a common hash location for one or more of the functions.<ref name=\"cuckoofilter\">{{cite conference|last1=Fan|first1=Bin|last2=Andersen|first2=Dave G.|last3=Kaminsky|first3=Michael|last4=Mitzenmacher|first4=Michael D.|title=Cuckoo filter: practically better than Bloom|conference=Proceedings of the 10th ACM International on Conference on Emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies|date=2014|pages=75–88|doi=10.1145/2674005.2674994}}</ref>}}{{Efn|There exist improvements of the Bloom filter which improve on its complexity or support deletion; for example, the cuckoo filter exploits [[cuckoo hashing]] to gain these advantages.<ref name=\"cuckoofilter\" />}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bloom|first1=Burton H.|title=Space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|date=1970|volume=13|issue=7|pages=422–426|doi=10.1145/362686.362692|url=http://www.ovmj.org/GNUnet/papers/p422-bloom.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104063826/http://ovmj.org/gnunet/papers/p422-bloom.pdf|archivedate=4 November 2004|access-date=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all|bibcode=1985CACM...28...22S|citeseerx=10.1.1.641.9096}}</ref>\n\n=== Other data structures ===\nThere exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as [[van Emde Boas tree]]s, [[fusion tree]]s, [[trie]]s, and [[bit array]]s. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute.<ref name=\"pred\" /> As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.<ref name=\"judyarray\" />\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Uniform binary search===\n[[File:Uniform binary search.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Uniform binary search]] stores the difference between the current and the two next possible middle elements instead of specific bounds.]]\n{{main|Uniform binary search}}\nUniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the index of the middle element and the change in the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. Each step reduces the change by about half. For example, if the array to be searched is <math>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]</math>, the middle element would be <math>6</math>. Uniform binary search works on the basis that the difference between the index of middle element of the array and the left and right subarrays is the same. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray (<math>[1,2,3,4,5]</math>) is <math>3</math> and the middle element of the right subarray (<math>[7,8,9,10,11]</math>) is <math>9</math>. Uniform binary search would store the value of <math>3</math> as both indices differ from <math>6</math> by this same amount.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"An important variation\"}} To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the middle element. The main advantage of uniform binary search is that the procedure can store a table of the differences between indices for each iteration of the procedure. Uniform binary search may be faster on systems where it is inefficient to calculate the midpoint, such as on [[decimal computer]]s.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm U\"}}\n\n===Exponential search{{anchor|One-sided search}}===\n[[File:Exponential search.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Visualization of [[Exponential search|exponential searching]] finding the upper bound for the subsequent binary search]]\n{{main|Exponential search}}\nExponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. It starts by finding the first element with an index that is both a power of two and greater than the target value. Afterwards, it sets that index as the upper bound, and switches to binary search. A search takes <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\log_2 x + 1\\rfloor</math> iterations of the exponential search and at most <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\log_2 x \\rfloor</math> iterations of the binary search, where <math display=\"inline\">x</math> is the position of the target value. Exponential search works on bounded lists, but becomes an improvement over binary search only if the target value lies near the beginning of the array.{{sfn|Moffat|Turpin|2002|p=33}}\n\n===Interpolation search===\n[[File:Interpolation search.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Visualization of [[interpolation search]]. In this case, no searching is needed because the estimate of the target's location within the array is correct. Other implementations may specify another function for estimating the target's location.]]\n{{main|Interpolation search}}\nInstead of calculating the midpoint, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. This is only possible if the array elements are numbers. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Interpolation search\"}} When the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, it makes <math display=\"inline\">O(\\log \\log n)</math> comparisons.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Interpolation search\"}}{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Exercise 22\"}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perl|first1=Yehoshua|last2=Itai|first2=Alon|last3=Avni|first3=Haim|title=Interpolation search—a log log ''n'' search|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|date=1978|volume=21|issue=7|pages=550–553|doi=10.1145/359545.359557|bibcode=1985CACM...28...22S}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, interpolation search is slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation.

These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to [[Energy storage|stored energy]].  An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a [[light switch]]. The switch lever is designed to rest in the \"on\" or \"off\" position, but not between the two.  Bistable behavior can occur in mechanical linkages, electronic circuits, nonlinear optical systems, chemical reactions, and physiological and biological systems.\n\nIn a [[conservative force]] field, bistability stems from the fact that the [[potential energy]] has two [[local minimum|local minima]], which are the stable equilibrium points.<ref name=\"Nazarov\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Nazarov\n | first1 = Yuli V.\n | last2  = Danon\n | first2 = Jeroen\n | title  = Advanced Quantum Mechanics: A Practical Guide\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | date   = 2013\n | pages  = 291\n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=w20gAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&dq=bistability+minimum\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 978-1139619028\n }}</ref>  By mathematical arguments, a [[local maximum]], an unstable equilibrium point, must lie between the two minima.  At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them.\n\nA system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare [[activation energy]] and [[Arrhenius equation]] for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the other minimum state in a time called the [[relaxation time]].\n\nBistability is widely used in [[digital electronics]] devices to store [[binary number|binary]] data. It is the essential characteristic of the [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], a circuit widely used in latches and some types of [[semiconductor memory]].  A bistable device can store one [[binary digit|bit]] of binary data, with one state representing a \"0\" and the other state a \"1\".  It is also used in [[relaxation oscillator]]s, [[multivibrator]]s, and the [[Schmitt trigger]].\n[[Optical bistability]] is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input.\nBistability can also arise in biochemical systems, where it creates digital, switch-like outputs from the constituent chemical concentrations and activities. It is often associated with [[Hysteresis#In biology|hysteresis]] in such systems.\n\n==Mathematical modelling==\n\nIn the mathematical language of [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamic systems analysis]], one of the simplest bistable systems is\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = y (1-y^2).\n</math>\n\nThis system describes a ball rolling down a curve with shape <math>\\frac{y^4}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{2}</math>, and has three steady-states: <math> y = 1 </math>, <math> y = 0 </math>, and <math> y = -1</math>. The middle steady-state <math>y=0</math> is unstable, while the other two states are stable. The direction of change of <math>y(t)</math> over time depends on the initial condition <math>y(0)</math>.  If the initial condition is positive (<math>y(0)>0</math>), then the solution <math>y(t)</math> approaches 1 over time, but if the initial condition is negative (<math>y(0)< 0</math>), then <math>y(t)</math> approaches −1 over time. Thus, the dynamics are \"bistable\". The final state of the system can be either <math> y = 1 </math> or <math> y = -1 </math>, depending on the initial conditions.<ref>For detailed techniques of mathematical modelling of bistability, see the tutorial by Chong et al.

Positive feedback loops, such as the simple X activates Y and Y activates X motif, essentially links output signals to their input signals and have been noted to be an important regulatory motif in cellular signal transduction because positive feedback loops can create switches with an all-or-nothing decision.<ref name=\"O.

Brandman, J. E 2005\"/>\n\nBistability can also arise in a biochemical system only for a particular range of parameter values, where the parameter can often be interpreted as the strength of the feedback. In several typical examples, the system has only one stable fixed point at low values of the parameter. A [[saddle-node bifurcation]] gives rise to a pair of new fixed points emerging, one stable and the other unstable, at a critical value of the parameter. The unstable solution can then form another saddle-node bifurcation with the initial stable solution at a higher value of the parameter, leaving only the higher fixed solution. Thus, at values of the parameter between the two critical values, the system has two stable solutions. An example of a dynamical system that demonstrates similar features is\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = r + \\frac{x^5}{1+x^5} - x\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>x</math> is the output, and <math>r</math> is the parameter, acting as the input.<ref name=\"Angeli 2003\">{{cite journal| author1 = Angeli, David| author2=Ferrell, JE| author3=Sontag, Eduardo D| title=Detection of multistability, bifurcations, and hysteresis in a large calss of biological positive-feedback systems| journal=PNAS| year=2003| volume=101| issue=7| doi=10.1073/pnas.0308265100| pmid=14766974| pmc=357011| pages=1822–7}}</ref>\n\nBistability can be modified to be more robust and to tolerate significant changes in concentrations of reactants, while still maintaining its \"switch-like\" character.  Feedback on both the activator of a system and inhibitor make the system able to tolerate a wide range of concentrations.  An example of this in cell biology is that activated CDK1 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1) activates its activator Cdc25 while at the same time inactivating its inactivator, Wee1, thus allowing for progression of a cell into mitosis.  Without this double feedback, the system would still be bistable, but would not be able to tolerate such a wide range of concentrations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ferrell JE Jr.|title=Feedback regulation of opposing enzymes generates robust, all-or-none bistable responses|journal=Current Biology|year=2008|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&_cid=272099&_user=10&_pii=S0960982208001814&_check=y&_origin=&_coverDate=25-Mar-2008&view=c&wchp=dGLzVlV-zSkzk&md5=68c1e4cd1871b9bbf09f2ade972e0d04/1-s2.0-S0960982208001814-main.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.035|pages=R244–R245|pmid=18364225|pmc=2832910}}</ref>\n\nBistability has also been described in the embryonic development of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' (the fruit fly).

''gli1'' and ''gli2'' transcription is activated by Shh, and their gene products act as transcriptional activators for their own expression and for targets downstream of Shh signaling.<ref>Lai, K., M.J. Robertson, and D.V. Schaffer, The sonic hedgehog signaling system as a bistable genetic switch. Biophys J, 2004. 86(5): p. 2748-57.</ref> Simultaneously, the Shh signaling network is controlled by a negative feedback loop wherein the Gli transcription factors activate the enhanced transcription of a repressor (Ptc). This signaling network illustrates the simultaneous positive and negative feedback loops whose exquisite sensitivity helps create a bistable switch.\n\nBistability can only arise in biological and chemical systems if three necessary conditions are fulfilled: positive [[feedback]], a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent increase without bound.<ref name=Wilhelm/>\n\nBistable chemical systems have been studied extensively to analyze relaxation kinetics, [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], [[stochastic resonance]], as well as [[climate change]].<ref name=Wilhelm/> In bistable spatially extended systems the onset of local correlations and propagation of traveling waves have been analyzed.<ref name=Elf>{{cite journal |last1 = Elf |first1 = J. | last2 = Ehrenberg| first2 = M. |year = 2004 |title = Spontaneous separation of bi-stable biochemical systems into spatial domains of opposite phases |journal = Systems Biology (Stevenage) |volume = 1 |number = 2| pages = 230–236 |pmid = 17051695 | doi=10.1049/sb:20045021}}</ref><ref name=Kochanzyck>{{cite journal |last1 = Kochanczyk |first1 = M. |last2 = Jaruszewicz |first2 = J. |last3 = Lipniacki |first3 = T. |title = Stochastic transitions in a bistable reaction system on the membrane |journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume = 10 |number = 84 |pages = 20130151 |pmid = 23635492 |pmc = 3673150 |doi =  10.1098/rsif.2013.0151 |date=Jul 2013}}</ref>\n\nBistability is often accompanied by [[hysteresis]].

In an ensemble average over the population, the result may simply look like a smooth transition, thus showing the value of single-cell resolution.\n\nA specific type of instability is known as ''modehopping'', which is bi-stability in the frequency space. Here trajectories can shoot between two stable limit cycles, and thus show similar characteristics as normal bi-stability when measured inside a Poincare section.\n== In mechanical systems ==\nBistability is the ability of a material to present in two stable phases that can both exist within a given range of temperatures but above and below that range only one or the other phase exists.\n\nBistability as applied in the design of mechanical systems is more commonly said to be \"over centre\"—that is, work is done on the system to move it just past the peak, at which point the mechanism goes \"over centre\" to its secondary stable position. The result is a toggle-type action- work applied to the system below a threshold sufficient to send it 'over center' results in no change to the mechanism's state.\n\n[[spring (device)|Springs]] are a common method of achieving an \"over centre\" action. A spring attached to a simple two position ratchet-type mechanism can create a button or plunger that is clicked or toggled between two mechanical states. Many [[Ballpoint Pen|ballpoint]] and [[Rollerball Pen|rollerball]] retractable pens employ this type of bistable mechanism.\n\nAn even more common example of an over-center device is an ordinary electric wall switch.  These switches are often designed to snap firmly into the \"on\" or \"off\" position once the toggle handle has been moved a certain distance past the center-point.\n\nA [[ratchet (device)|ratchet-and-pawl]] is an elaboration—a multi-stable \"over center\" system used to create irreversible motion.  The pawl goes over center as it is turned in the forward direction. In this case, \"over center\" refers to the ratchet being stable and \"locked\" in a given position until clicked forward again; it has nothing to do with the ratchet being unable to turn in the reverse direction.\n\n[[File:Ratchet example.gif|thumbnail|A ratchet in action.

      "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\nA '''couplet''' is a pair of successive lines of [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] in poetry.  A couplet usually consists of two successive lines that [[rhyme]] and have the same metre. A couplet may be formal (closed) or run-on (open).  In a formal (or closed) couplet, each of the two lines is end-stopped, implying that there is a grammatical pause at the end of a line of verse.  In a run-on (or open) couplet, the meaning of the first line continues to the second.<ref>\"couplet.\" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 12 Nov. 2013</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe word \"couplet\" comes from the French word meaning \"two pieces of iron riveted or hinged together.\" The term \"couplet\" was first used to describe successive lines of verse in Sir P. Sidney's '' Arcadia '' in 1590: \"In singing some short coplets, whereto the one halfe beginning, the other halfe should answere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=21C3D384C49DB50A2116A667211BE681?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F43139%3Frskey%3DnmXq3u%26result%3D47784|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=oed.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514183041/http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=21C3D384C49DB50A2116A667211BE681?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F43139%3Frskey%3DnmXq3u%26result%3D47784|archivedate=2018-05-14|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile couplets traditionally rhyme, not all do. Poems may use white space to mark out couplets if they do not rhyme. Couplets in [[iambic pentameter]] are called ''[[heroic couplet]]s''. [[John Dryden]] in the 17th century and [[Alexander Pope]] in the 18th century were both well known for their writing in heroic couplets.  The [[Poetic epigram]] is also in the couplet form. Couplets can also appear as part of more complex [[rhyme scheme]]s, such as [[sonnet]]s.\n\nRhyming couplets are one of the simplest rhyme schemes in poetry.  Because the rhyme comes so quickly, it tends to call attention to itself. Good rhyming couplets tend to \"explode\" as both the rhyme and the idea come to a quick close in two lines. Here are some examples of rhyming couplets where the sense as well as the sound \"rhymes\":\n\n:: True wit is nature to advantage dress'd;\n:: What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd.\n:: — Alexander Pope\n\n:: Whether or not we find what we are seeking\n:: Is idle, biologically speaking.\n:: — [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] (at the end of a sonnet)\n\nOn the other hand, because rhyming couplets have such a predictable rhyme scheme, they can feel artificial and plodding. Here is a Pope parody of the predictable rhymes of his era:\n:: Where-e'er you find \"the cooling western breeze,\"\n:: In the next line, it \"whispers through the trees;\"\n:: If crystal streams \"with pleasing murmurs creep,\"\n:: The reader's threatened (not in vain) with \"sleep.\"\n\n==In English poetry==\nRhyming couplets are often used in [[Early Modern English]] poetry, as seen in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.  This work of literature is written almost entirely in rhyming couplets.  Similarly, [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]]s often employ rhyming couplets at the end to emphasize the theme. Take one of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets, [[Sonnet 18]], for example (the rhyming couplet is shown in italics):\n\n:: Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\n:: Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\n:: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n:: And summer's lease hath all too short a date:\n:: Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n:: And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\n:: And every fair from fair sometime declines,\n:: By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\n:: But thy eternal summer shall not fade\n:: Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\n:: Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\n:: When in eternal lines to time thou growest:\n:: ''So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,''\n:: ''So long lives this and this gives life to thee.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/18.html|title=Shakespeare Sonnet 18 - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day|first=Amanda|last=Mabillard|date=|website=www.shakespeare-online.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112213943/http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/18.html|archivedate=2013-11-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n==In Chinese poetry==\n[[File:Chinese Marks Door.JPG|thumb|A Chinese couplet on doorway]]\n[[Chinese couplet]]s or \"contrapuntal couplets\" may be seen on doorways in Chinese communities worldwide. Couplets displayed as part of the [[Chinese New Year]] festival, on the first morning of the New Year, are called ''chunlian'' (春联). These are usually purchased at a market a few days before and glued to the doorframe. The text of the couplets is often traditional and contains hopes for prosperity. Other chunlian reflect more recent concerns. For example, the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]] usually promotes couplets reflecting current political themes in [[mainland China]].\n\nSome Chinese couplets may consist of two lines of four [[Chinese character|characters]] each.  Couplets are read from top to bottom where the first pline starts from the right. But is also a 6 word diagraph with 19 lines\n\n==In Tamil poetry==\n[[File:Kural in Chennai Metro Train.jpg|thumb|A [[Tirukkural|Kural]] couplet on display inside a [[Chennai Metro]] train]]\n[[Tamil literature]] contains some of the best known examples of ancient couplet poetry. The [[Tamil language]] has a rich and refined grammar for couplet poetry, and distichs in Tamil poetry follow the [[venpa]] metre.<ref name=\"Zvelebil1973\">{{cite book|author=Kamil Zvelebil|title=The smile of Murugan: On Tamil literature of South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VF2VMUoY_okC&pg=PA156|accessdate=11 December 2010|year=1973|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03591-1|pages=156–171}}</ref> The most famous example for Tamil couplet poetry is the ancient Tamil moral text of [[Tirukkural]], which contains a total of 1330 couplets written in the [[kural (poetic form)|kural venpa]] metre from which the title of the work was derived centuries later.

For example, 1101001 in binary (the decimal number 105), shifted one place to the right, is 110100 (the decimal number 52): the lowest order bit, a 1, is removed. Similarly, division by any [[power of two]] 2<sup>''k''</sup> may be performed by right-shifting ''k'' positions. Because bit shifts are often much faster operations than division, replacing a division by a shift in this way can be a helpful step in [[program optimization]].<ref name=\"WC00\"/> However, for the sake of [[software portability]] and readability, it is often best to write programs using the division operation and trust in the [[compiler]] to perform this replacement.<ref>{{citation|title=Write portable code: an introduction to developing software for multiple platforms|first=Brian|last=Hook|publisher=No Starch Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59327-056-8|page=133}}.</ref> An example from [[Common Lisp]]:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (setq number #b1101001)   ; #b1101001  —  105\n (ash number -1)           ; #b0110100  —  105 >> 1 ⇒ 52\n (ash number -4)           ; #b0000110  —  105 >> 4 ≡ 105 / 2⁴ ⇒ 6\n</source>\n\nThe above statements, however, are not always true when dealing with dividing [[Signed number representations|signed]] binary numbers. Shifting right by 1 bit will divide by two, always rounding down. However, in some languages, division of signed binary numbers round towards 0 (which, if the result is negative, means it rounds up). For example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] is one such language: in Java, <code>-3 / 2</code> evaluates to <code>-1</code>, whereas <code>-3 >> 1</code> evaluates to <code>-2</code>. So in this case, the compiler ''cannot'' optimize division by two by replacing it by a bit shift, when the dividend could possibly be negative.\n\n==Binary floating point==\nIn binary [[floating-point arithmetic]], division by two can be performed by decreasing the exponent by one (as long as the result is not a [[subnormal number]]). Many programming languages provide functions that can be used to divide a floating point number by a power of two. For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] provides the method <code>java.lang.Math.scalb</code> for scaling by a power of two,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#scalb(double,%20int)\n|title=Math.scalb\n|work=Java Platform Standard Ed. 6\n|accessdate=2009-10-11\n}}</ref> and the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] provides the function <code>ldexp</code> for the same purpose.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Programming languages — C, International Standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999\n}}, Section 7.12.6.6.</ref>\n\n==Decimal==\nThe following [[algorithm]] is for decimal.

Typically one of the meanings is obvious, given the context, whereas the other may require more thought. The [[innuendo]] may convey a message that would be too socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly (the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' describes a double entendre as being used to \"convey an indelicate meaning\", whilst ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' defines it as \"a word or phrase that may be understood in two different ways, one of which is often sexual\").<ref name=\"Longman\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | title=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English online | publisher=Longman | work=Dictionary of Contemporary English | accessdate=29 August 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083027/http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | archivedate=3 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA double entendre may exploit [[pun]]s to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit [[ambiguity]] and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text.  Sometimes a [[homophone]] can be used as a pun.  When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a \"triple entendre\", etc.\n\n== Structure ==\nA person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its [[innuendo]]s, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Perhaps because it is not offensive to those who do not recognise it, innuendo is often used in [[sitcom]]s and other [[comedy]] where the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning.\n\nA triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 [[Rush (band)|Rush]] album ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' which shows a [[moving company]] carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a \"[[moving picture]]\" of the whole scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|title=The Rush Frequently Asked Questions on the Internet File|work=nimitz.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222184534/http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe expression comes from [[French language|French]] ''double'' = \"double\" and ''entendre'' = \"to hear\" (but also \"to understand\"<ref name=\"TLFi\">[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre definition of entendre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429210121/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre |date=29 April 2012 }}, ''sub'' II at www.cnrtl.fr, accessed on 23 March 2012</ref>).

When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other cyclopes that \"No-one has hurt me!\", which leads the other cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.\n\n[[File:Wanderer-Exeter-Book-first-page-Bernard-Muir.jpg|thumb|The first page of the poem \"The Wanderer\" found in the Exeter Book.]]\nSome of the earliest double entendres are found in the [[Exeter Book]], or Codex exoniensis, at [[Exeter Cathedral]] in [[England]]. The book was copied around AD 975. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. The Anglo-Saxons did not reveal the answers to the riddles, but they have been answered by scholars over the years. Some riddles were double-entendres, such as [[Exeter Book#Riddle 25|Riddle 25]] (\"I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall––I stand up in bed––and whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet.\") which suggests the answer \"a [[Human penis|penis]]\" but has the correct answer \"an [[onion]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title = Exeter Book Riddles|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/anglo-saxon/flowers/enigmata.html|website = penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}</ref>\n\nExamples of [[innuendo|sexual innuendo]] and double-entendre occur in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath's Tale is laden with double entendres. These include her use of the word \"queynte\" to describe both domestic duties (from the homonym \"quaint\") and genitalia (\"queynte\" being the root of '[[cunt]]', a [[Vulgarity|vulgar]] English word for [[vulva]]).  \nThe title of [[Sir Thomas More]]'s 1516 fictional work ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is a double entendre because of the [[pun]] between two [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived words that would have identical pronunciation: with his spelling, it means \"no place\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/Utopia|title=Utopia – Definition of utopia by Merriam-Webster|work=webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052252/http://webster.com/dictionary/utopia|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (as echoed later in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s later [[Erewhon]]); spelled as the rare word [[Eutopia]], it is pronounced the same<ref>A.

For example, the character [[Charley Bates]] from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' is frequently referred to as Master Bates. The word \"[[masturbation|masturbate]]\" was in use when the book was written, and Dickens often used colourful names related to the natures of the characters.\n\nThe title of [[Damon Knight]]'s story ''[[To Serve Man]]'' is a double entendre which could mean \"to perform a service to humanity\" or \"to serve a human as food\". An alien [[cookbook]] with the title ''To Serve Man'' is featured in the story which could imply that the aliens eat humans. The story was the basis for [[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|an episode]] of [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|''The Twilight Zone'']]. At the end of the episode the line \"It's a cookbook!\" reveals the truth.\n\n=== Stage performances ===\n[[File:Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl 010.jpg|thumb|right|Flax on a distaff]]\nShakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. [[Sir Toby Belch]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' says of [[Sir Andrew Aguecheek|Sir Andrew's]] hair, that \"it hangs like [[flax]] on a [[distaff]]; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off\"; [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|the Nurse]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' says that her husband had told [[Juliet]] when she was learning to walk that \"Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit\"; or is told the time by [[Mercutio]]: \"for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the [[Prick (slang)|prick]] of noon\";  and in ''[[Hamlet]]'', [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] publicly torments [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] with a series of sexual puns, including \"country matters\" (similar to \"[[cunt]]\"). The title of Shakespeare's play ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' is a pun on the Elizabethan use of \"no-thing\" as slang for [[vagina]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Gordon |year=1997 |title=''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' |publisher=Althone Press  |ISBN= 0-485-12130-1 |page=219}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917011921/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | archivedate=17 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, starting in the 19th century, [[Victorian morality]] disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In [[music hall]] songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. [[Marie Lloyd]]'s song \"She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas\" is an example of this. (Music hall in this context is to be compared with [[Variety show|Variety]], the one common, [[low-class]] and vulgar; the other [[demi-monde]], worldly and sometimes [[Chic (style)|chic]].)  In the 20th century there began to a crackdown on lewdness, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow (in the UK, 'blue' [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] refers to sexual content, as in 'blue jokes', 'blue movies' etc.).\n\n=== Radio and television ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the [[Howard Stern Show]] began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of Radio called \"[[Shock Jock]] Radio\" where DJs will push the limits of what is an \"acceptable\" double entendre to use on over the air as the FCC has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards.\n\nIn Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to [[radio]] and [[film|cinema]] from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the ''[[Carry On (series)|Carry On]]'' series of films and the [[BBC]] radio series ''[[Round the Horne]]'', although some of ''Round the Horne'' appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having 'rude' conversations in [[Polari]] (gay slang). ''Round the Horne'' depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor [[Kenneth Horne]] and those around him, the sailor's expression 'going round the horn' (i.e. [[Cape Horn]]), and the fact that 'horn' is slang for an [[erection]]. [[Spike Milligan]], writer of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', remarked that a lot of 'blue' (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were \"Officer class\".\n\nIn 1968, the office of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ceased to have responsibility for censoring live [[entertainment]], after the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. By the 1970s innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including [[British sitcom|sitcoms]] and [[radio comedy]], such as ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'', Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her \"pussy\", apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as \"It's a wonder I'm here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin' wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left\". Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the [[innuendo]] (\"pussy\" being [[sexual slang]] for [[vulva]]).\n\nModern comedies, such as the US version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] often deploys the phrase \"[[Said the actress to the bishop|that's what she said]]\" after another character's innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun.\n\nOn The Scott Mills Show on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as \"Innuendo Bingo\". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Movies ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDouble entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The [[James Bond]] films are rife with such humour.  For example, in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy \"brushing up on a little Danish\".  Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as \"a cunning linguist\", a play on the word \"[[cunnilingus]]\". In the final scene of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead “round the world one more time”, Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir.” In ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), while in bed with Dr [[Christmas Jones]], Bond tells her “I thought Christmas only comes once a year”. Other obvious examples include [[Pussy Galore]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and [[Holly Goodhead]] in ''Moonraker''. The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series.\n\nBawdy double entendres, such as \"I'm the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night\", and (from the movie ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'') \"I feel like a million tonight — but only one at a time\", are typical of the comedy writing of [[Mae West]], for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDouble entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as \"[[If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me]]\" by The Bellamy Brothers. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking.\n\nSinger and songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], in his somewhat controversial song \"[[Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]\", repeats the line \"Everybody must get stoned\". In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of [[capital punishment|execution]] by [[stoning]], but on another level it means to 'get stoned', a common slang term for being high on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. In their song \"Big Balls\" on the album ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', [[AC/DC]] the chorus \"we've got big balls\" can be read as referring to either [[ball (dance)|formal dances]] or [[testicle]]s.  During the 1940s, [[Benny Bell]] recorded several \"party records\" that contained double entendre including \"Everybody Wants My Fanny\".\n\n=== Social interaction ===\nDouble entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clichéd phrase \"[[that's what she said]]\", as well as \"so to speak\" can be used<ref>{{cite web | title = Fighter Pilot Speak | url = http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | accessdate = 11 February 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010403/http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | archivedate = 23 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual.

      "text": "{{short description|grammatical number in addition to singular and plural}}\n'''Dual''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''du'''}}) is a [[grammatical number]] that some languages use in addition to singular and [[plural]]. When a noun or pronoun appears in dual form, it is interpreted as referring to precisely two of the entities (objects or persons) identified by the noun or pronoun acting as a single unit or in unison. Verbs can also have dual agreement forms in these languages.\n\nThe dual number existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], persisted in many of its [[Indo-European languages|descendants]], such as [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], which have dual forms across nouns, verbs, and adjectives, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], which used dual forms in pronouns and verbs, and [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), which used dual forms in pronouns. It can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Slovene language|Slovenian]], and [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]].\n\nThe majority of modern Indo-European languages, however, have lost dual through their development and only show residual traces of it. In all these languages, its function has been replaced by simple plural, as is evident in the [[English language|English]] distinctions: ''both'' vs. ''all'', ''either'' vs. ''any'', ''neither'' vs. ''none'', and so on. A commonly used sentence to exemplify dual in English is \"''Both go to the same school.''\" where ''both'' refers to two people who had already been determined in the conversation.\n\nMany [[Semitic languages]] also have dual number. For instance, in Arabic, {{lang|ar|ان|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|-ān}}, is added to the end of any noun to indicate that it is dual (regardless of how the plural is being formed).\n\nIt is also present in those [[Khoisan languages]] that have a rich [[inflectional morphology]], particularly [[Khoe languages]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Vossen |first=Rainer |title=The Khoesan Languages |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |edition=1st |pages=58 |isbn=978-0-203-08446-5}}</ref>\n\n== Comparative characteristics ==\n\nMany languages make a distinction between singular and [[plural]]: English, for example, distinguishes between ''man'' and ''men'', or ''house'' and ''houses''.  In some [[language]]s, in addition to such singular and plural forms, there is also a '''dual''' form, which is used when exactly two people or things are meant.  In many languages with dual forms, use of the dual is mandatory as in some Arabic dialects using dual in nouns as in [[Hejazi Arabic]], and the plural is used only for groups greater than two.  However, use of the dual is optional in some languages such as other modern Arabic dialects including [[Egyptian Arabic]].\n\nIn other languages such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the dual exists only for words naming time spans (day, week, etc.), a few [[measure word]]s, and for words that naturally come in pairs and are not used in the plural except in rhetoric: eyes, ears, and so forth.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the use of the dual is mandatory, except for nouns that are natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, ears, lips, hands, arms, legs, feet, kidneys, breasts, lungs, etc., for which the plural form has to be used, unless you want to stress that something is true for both one and the other part. For example, one says \"oči me bolijo\" (my eyes hurt), but if they want to stress that both their eyes hurt, they say \"obe očesi me bolita\". When using the pronoun \"obe/oba\" (both), the dual form that follows is mandatory.\n\nAlthough relatively few languages have the dual number and most have no number or only singular and plural, using different words for groups of two and groups greater than two is not uncommon.  [[English language|English]] has words distinguishing dual vs. plural number, including: ''both/all'', ''either/any'', ''neither/none'', ''between/among'', ''former/first'', and ''latter/last''.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which has no grammatical number, also has words ''dochira'' (which of the two) and ''dore'' (which of the three or more), etc.\n\n== Use in modern languages ==\nAmong living languages, [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has a mandatory dual number, marked on nouns, verbs, adjectives and pronouns. (First-person dual forms, however, do not exist; compare this to the lack of third-person dual forms in the old Germanic languages.) Many of the spoken Arabic dialects have a dual marking for nouns (only), and its use can be mandatory in some dialects, and not mandatory in others. Likewise, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] had a dual number, though its use was confined to standard phrases like \"two hands\", \"two eyes\", and \"two arms\". The dual in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has also atrophied, generally being used for only time, number, and natural pairs even in its [[Biblical Hebrew|most ancient form]].\n\n[[Inuktitut]] and the related [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language]] use dual forms; however, the related [[Greenlandic language]] does not (though it used to have them).\n\n[[Khoekhoegowab]] and other Khoe languages mark dual number in their person-gender-number [[enclitics]], though the [[neuter gender]] does not have a dual form.\n\n[[Austronesian languages]], particularly [[Polynesian languages]] such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Niuean language|Niuean]] and [[Tongan language|Tongan]], possess a dual number for pronouns but not for nouns, as nouns are generally marked for plural syntactically and not morphologically.  Other Austronesian languages, particularly [[Languages of the Philippines|those spoken in the Philippines]], have a dual first-person pronoun; these languages include [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] ({{lang|ilo|data}}), [[Tausug language|Tausug]] ({{lang|tsg|kita}}), and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] ({{lang|pam|ikata}}). These forms mean \"we\", but specifically \"you and I\". This form once existed in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ({{lang|tl|katá}} or sometimes {{lang|tl|kitá}}) but has disappeared from standard usage (save for certain dialects such as in [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]]) since the middle of the 20th century, with ''kitá'' as the only surviving form (e.g. ''Mahál kitá'', loosely \"I love you\").\n\nThe dual was a standard feature of the [[Proto-Uralic language]], and lives on in the [[Samoyedic languages]] and in most [[Sami languages]], while other branches like Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian have lost it. Sami also features dual pronouns, expressing the concept of \"we two here\" as contrasted to \"we\". [[Nenets languages|Nenets]], two closely related [[Samoyedic languages]], features a complete set of dual [[possessive suffix]]es for two systems, the number of possessors and the number of possessed objects (for example, \"two houses of us two\" expressed in one word).\n\nThe dual form is also used in several modern Indo-European languages, such as [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] (see below for details).  The dual was a common feature of all early Slavic languages at the beginning of the second millennium CE.\n\n==Arabic==\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic]], as well as in [[Classical Arabic]], the use of dual is compulsory when describing two units. For this purpose, {{lang|ar|ان|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|-ān}}, is added to the end of any noun or adjective regardless of gender or of how the plural is being formed. In the case of feminine nouns ending with {{lang|ar|ة|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN| ta marbuta}}, this letter becomes a {{lang|ar|ت|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|ta}}. When the dual noun or adjective is rendered in the genitive or accusative forms, the {{lang|ar|ان|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|-ān}} becomes {{lang|ar|ين|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|-ain}}.\n\nBesides the noun and adjective dual, there are also dual verb forms of compulsory use for second and third person, together with their pronouns, but none for the first person.\n\nThe use of dual in [[Varieties of Arabic|spoken Arabic]] varies widely and is mostly rendered a {{lang|ar|ين|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|-ain}} even when in nominative context. Whereas its use is quite common in [[Levantine Arabic]], for instance {{lang|ar|كيلوين|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN| kilowain}} meaning \"two kilograms\", dual forms are generally not used in [[Maghrebi Arabic]], where two units are commonly expressed with the word {{lang|ar|زوج|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN| zuʒ}}, \nas in {{lang|ar| زوج كيلو |rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN| zuʒ kilu}} meaning \"a pair of kilograms\", with the noun appearing in singular.\n\n==Hebrew==\n\n===Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew===\nIn [[Biblical Hebrew|Biblical]], [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]], and [[Medieval Hebrew]], like [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other [[Semitic languages]], all nouns can have singular, plural or dual forms, and there is still a debate whether there are vestiges of dual verbal forms and pronouns.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dual Personal Pronouns and Dual Verbs in Hebrew |author=Gary Rendsburg |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review: New Series |volume=73 |issue=1 |date=July 1982 |pages=38–58 |doi=10.2307/1454459}}</ref> However, in practice, most nouns use only singular and plural forms. Usually {{Hebrew|־ים}} {{transl|he|-īm}} is added to [[grammatical gender#Objects and abstractions|masculine]] words to make them plural for example {{Hebrew|ספר / ספרים}} {{transl|he|sēfer / səfārīm}} \"book / books\", whilst with [[grammatical gender#Objects and abstractions|feminine]] nouns the {{Hebrew|־ה}} {{transl|he|-ā}} is replaced with {{Hebrew|־ות}} {{transl|he|-ōṯ}}. For example, {{Hebrew|פרה / פרות}} {{transl|he|pārā / pārōṯ}} \"cow / cows\". The masculine dual form is shown in pointed text with a pathach; in a purely consonantal text, masculine dual is not indicated at all by the consonants.  The dual for (two) days is {{Hebrew| יוֹמַ֫יִם}} with pathach under the mem.  An example of the dual form is {{Hebrew|יום / יומים / ימים}} {{transl|he|yōm / yomạyim / yāmīm}} \"day / two days / [two or more] days\". Some words occur so often in pairs that the form with the dual suffix {{transl|he|-ạyim}} is used in practice for the general plural, such as {{Hebrew|עין / עינים}} {{transl|he|ʿạyin / ʿēnạyim}} \"eye / eyes\", used even in a sentence like \"The spider has eight eyes.\" Thus words like {{transl|he|ʿēnạyim}} only appear to be dual, but are in fact what is called \"pseudo-dual\", which is a way of making a plural.  Sometimes, words can change meaning depending on whether the dual or plural form is used, for example; {{transl|he|ʿayin}} can mean eye or water spring in the singular, but in the plural eyes will take the dual form of {{transl|he|ʿenayim}} whilst springs are {{transl|he|ʿeynot}}. Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns have only singular and plural, with the plural forms of these being used with dual nouns.\n\n===Modern Hebrew===\nIn [[Modern Hebrew]] as used in [[Israel]], there is also a dual number, but its use is very restricted. The dual form is usually used in expressions of time and number. These nouns have plurals as well, which are used for numbers higher than two, for example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Singular || Double || Triple\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|פעם}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|páʿam}} (\"time\", frequency)\n| {{Hebrew|פעמים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|paʿamáyim}} (\"twice\")\n| {{Hebrew|שלוש פעמים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shalosh pəʿamim}} (\"thrice\")\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|יום}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|yom}} (\"day\")\n| {{Hebrew|יומים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|yomáyim}} (\"two days\")\n| {{Hebrew|שלושה ימים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shəlosha yamim}} (\"three days\")\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|שנה}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shaná}} (\"year\")\n| {{Hebrew|שנתים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shnatáyim}} (\"two years\")\n| {{Hebrew|שלוש שנים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shalosh shanim}} (\"three years\")\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|שבוע}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shavúaʿ}} (\"week\")\n| {{Hebrew|שבועים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shəvuʿáyim}} (\"two weeks\")\n| {{Hebrew|שלושה שבועות}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shəlosha shavuʿot}} (\"three weeks\")\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|מאה}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|meʾa}} (\"one hundred\")\n| {{Hebrew|מאתים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|matáyim}} (\"two hundred\")\n| {{Hebrew|שלוש מאות}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shalosh meʾot}} (\"three hundred\")\n\n|}\n\nThe pseudo-dual is used to form the plural of some body parts, garments, etc., for instance:\n\n: {{Hebrew|רגל}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|régel}} (\"leg\") → {{Hebrew|רגלים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|ragláyim}} (\"legs\")\n: {{Hebrew|אזן}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|ózen}} (\"ear\") → {{Hebrew|אזנים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|oznáyim}} (\"ears\")\n: {{Hebrew|שן}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shen}} (\"tooth\") → {{Hebrew|שנים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shináyim}} (\"teeth\")\n: {{Hebrew|מעי}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|məʿi}} (\"intestine\") → {{Hebrew|מעים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|məʿáyim}} (\"intestines\")\n: {{Hebrew|נעל}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|náʿal}} (\"shoe\") → {{Hebrew|נעלים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|naʿaláyim}} (\"shoes\")\n: {{Hebrew|גרב}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|gérev}} (\"sock\") → {{Hebrew|גרבים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|garbáyim}} (\"socks\")\n\nIn this case, even if there are more than two, the dual is still used, for instance יש לכלב ארבע רגלים {{transl|he|yesh lə-ḵélev arbaʿ '''ragláyim'''}} (\"a dog has four '''legs'''\").\n\nAnother case of the pseudo-dual is ''duale tantum'' (a kind of [[plurale tantum]]) nouns:\n\n: {{Hebrew|נקודתים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|nəkudatáyim}} (\"[[colon (punctuation)|colon]]\", lit. \"two dots\")\n: {{Hebrew|אופנים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|ofanáyim}} (\"bicycle\", lit. \"two wheels\")\n: {{Hebrew|משקפים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|mishkafáyim}} (\"eyeglasses\", lit. \"two lenses\")\n: {{Hebrew|שמים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|shamáyim}} (\"sky\")\n: {{Hebrew|מספרים}} &nbsp; {{transl|he|misparáyim}} (\"scissors\")\n\n==Khoe languages==\nIn [[Nama language|Nama]], nouns have three [[grammatical gender|gender]]s and three [[grammatical number]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haacke |first=Wilfrid H.G. |editor-last=Vossen |editor-first=Rainer |title=The Khoesan Languages |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |pages=141-151 |chapter=3.2.1 Namibian Khoekhoe (Nama/Damara) |isbn=978-0-7007-1289-2}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

The best evidence for the dual among ancient Indo-European languages can be found in Old Indo-Iranian ([[Vedic Sanskrit]] and [[Avestan language|Avestan]]), [[Homeric Greek]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]], where its use was obligatory for all inflected categories including verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns and some numerals. Various traces of dual can also be found in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old Irish]] (see below), and in some fossilized terms in Latin.<ref>For example: {{lang|la|[[wikt:ambo#Latin|ambō]]}} \"both\", and {{lang|la|[[wikt:duo#Latin|duo]]}} \"two\", the latter with Iambic shortening.</ref>\n\nDue to the scarcity of evidence, the reconstruction of dual endings for Proto-Indo-European is difficult, but at least formally according to the [[comparative method]] it can be ascertained that no more than three dual endings are reconstructible for nominal inflection.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ringe|2006|pp=42}}</ref> {{harvtxt|Mallory|Adams|2006}} reconstruct the dual endings as:\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]/[[Accusative case|accusative]]/[[Vocative case|vocative]]: *-h₁(e)\n* [[Genitive case|Genitive]]/[[Ablative case|ablative]]: *-h₁(e) / *-oHs\n* [[Dative case|Dative]]: *-me / *-OH\n* [[Locative case|Locative]]: *-h₁ow\n* [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]: *-bʰih₁\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European category of dual did not only denote two of something: it could also be used as an associative marker, the so-called ''elliptical dual''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clackson|2007|p=101}}</ref> For example, the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] deity [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitrá]], when appearing in dual form ''Mitrā́'', refers to both Mitra and his companion [[Varuna|Varuṇa]]. Homeric dual {{lang|grc|Αἴαντε}} refers to [[Ajax the Great]]er and his fighting companion [[Teucer]], and Latin plural {{lang|la|Castorēs}} is used to denote both the semi-god [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]] and his twin brother [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]].\n\nBeside nominal (nouns, adjectives and pronouns), the dual was also present in verbal inflection where the syncretism was much lower.\n\nOf living Indo-European languages, the dual can be found in dialects of [[Scottish Gaelic]],{{Citation needed|date = April 2012}} but fully functioning as a paradigmatic category only in [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]], some forms of [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] and [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]]{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}. Remnants of the dual can be found in many of the remaining daughter languages, where certain forms of the noun are used with the number two (see below for examples).\n\n===Sanskrit===\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n\nThe dual is widely used in Sanskrit, as noted above. Its use is mandatory when the number of objects is two, and the plural is not permitted in this case, with one exception (see below). It is always indicated by the declensional suffix (and some morphophonemic modifications to the root resulting from addition of the suffix).\n\nFor nouns, the dual forms are the same in the following sets of cases, with examples for the masculine noun  {{IAST|bāla}} (boy):\n* nominative/accusative: bālau\n* instrumental/dative/ablative: bālābhyām\n* genitive/locative: bālayoḥ\n\nIn Sanskrit adjectives are treated the same as nouns as far as case declensions are concerned. As for pronouns, the same rules apply, except for a few special forms used in some cases.\n\nVerbs have distinct dual forms in the three persons in both the ātmanepada and parasmaipada forms of verbs. For instance, the root pac meaning \"to cook\", takes the following forms in the dual number of the present tense, called laṭ lakāra:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Person !! Parasmaipada !! Ātmanepada\n|-\n| 3rd (prathama) || pacataḥ || pacete\n|-\n| 2nd (madhyama) || pacathaḥ || pacethe\n|-\n| 1st (uttama) || pacāvaḥ || pacāvahe\n|}\n(Note that in Sanskrit, the order of the persons is reversed.)\n\nThe one exception to the rigidness about dual number is in the case of the pronoun asmad (I/we): Sanskrit grammar permits one to use the plural number for asmad even if the actual number of objects denoted is one or two (this is similar to the \"royal we\"). For example, while ''ahaṃ bravīmi'', ''āvāṃ brūvaḥ'' and ''vayaṃ brūmaḥ'' are respectively the singular, dual and plural forms of \"I say\" and \"we say\", ''vayaṃ brūmaḥ'' can be used in the singular and dual sense as well.\n\n===Greek===\nThe dual can be found in Ancient Greek Homeric texts such as the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', although its use is only sporadic, owing as much to artistic prerogatives as dictional and metrical requirements within the [[Hexameter|hexametric meter]]. There were only two distinct forms of the dual in Ancient Greek.\n\nIn classical Greek, the dual was all but lost, except in the [[Attic dialect]] of [[Athens]], where it persisted until the fifth century BC. Even in this case, its use depended on the author and certain stock expressions.\n\nIn [[Koine Greek]] and [[Modern Greek]], the only remnant of the dual is the numeral for \"two\", {{lang|el|δύο}}, {{lang|el-Latn|dýo}}, which has lost its genitive and dative cases (both {{lang|el|δυοῖν}}, {{lang|el-Latn|dyoīn}}) and retains its nominative/accusative form.  Thus it appears to be undeclined in all cases.  Nevertheless, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], the foremost authority of his time (early 2nd century BC) on grammar and style, and a staunch defender of \"proper\" High Attic tradition, admonishes those who write ''dysí'' (dative, plural number) rather than the \"correct\" ''dyoīn'' (dative, dual number).{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\n===Latin===\nThe dual was lost in Latin and its sister [[Italic languages]]. However, certain fossilized forms remained, for example, {{lang|la|viginti}} (twenty), but {{lang|la|triginta}} (thirty), the words {{lang|la|ambo}} (both, compare Slavic {{lang|la|oba}}), {{lang|la|duo}} / {{lang|la|duae}} with a dual declension.\n\n===Celtic languages===\nReconstructed [[Common Celtic]] nominal and adjectival declensions contain distinct dual forms; pronouns and verbs do not. In [[Old Irish]], nouns and the definite article still have dual forms, but only when accompanied by the numeral ''{{lang|cel-x-proto|da}}'' \"two\". Traces of the dual remain in [[Middle Welsh]], in nouns denoting pairs of body parts that incorporate the numeral two: e.g. {{lang|wlm|deulin}} (from {{lang|wlm|glin}} \"knee\"), {{lang|wlm|dwyglust}} (from {{lang|wlm|clust}} \"ear\").<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Henry |author2=Holger Pedersen |title=A Concise Comparative Celtic Grammar |location=Göttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=1989 |edition=3rd |pages=§§246, 468 |isbn=3-525-26102-0 }} {{cite book |last=Thurneysen |first=Rudolf |title=A Grammar of Old Irish |others=Trans. by [[D.

As the following table shows, ''dhá'' and ''dà'' combines with a singular noun, which is [[lenition|lenited]]. Masculine nouns take no special inflection, but feminine nouns have a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|slenderized]] dual form, which is in fact identical to the dative singular.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ó Maolalaigh |first=Roibeard |author2=Iain MacAonghuis |title=Scottish Gaelic in Three Months |publisher=Hugo's Language Books |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-85285-234-7}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As mentioned above for Middle Welsh, some nouns can be said to have dual forms, prefixed with a form of the numeral \"two\" (Breton {{lang|br|daou- / div-}}, Welsh {{lang|cy|dau- / deu- / dwy-}}, Cornish {{lang|kw|dew- / diw-}}). This process is not fully productive, however, and the prefixed forms are semantically restricted. For example, Breton {{lang|br|daouarn}} (< {{lang|br|dorn}} \"hand\") can only refer to one person's pair of hands, not any two hands from two different people. Welsh {{lang|cy|deufis}} must refer to a period of two consecutive months, whereas {{lang|cy|dau fis}} can be any two months.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heinecke |first=Johannes |title=Is there a Category of Dual in Breton or Welsh? |journal=Journal of Celtic Linguistics |volume=7 |year=2002 |pages=85–101 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Germanic languages===\nThe dual was present in all the early Germanic languages, as well as in [[Proto-Germanic]]. However, the dual had been entirely lost in nouns by that time, and since verbs agreed with nouns in number, so had the third-person dual form of verbs as a result. The dual therefore remained only in the first- and second-person pronouns and their accompanying verb forms.\n\n[[Gothic language|Gothic]] retained this situation more or less unchanged. It had markings for the first and second person for both the verbs and pronouns, for example {{lang|got|wit}} \"we two\" as compared to {{lang|got|weis}} \"we, more than two\". [[Old English]], [[Old Norse]] and the other old Germanic languages had dual marking only in the personal pronouns, but not in the verbs.\n\nThe dual has disappeared as a productive form in all the living languages, with loss of the dual occurring in [[North Frisian]] dialects only quite recently.<ref>Howe, Stephen. ''The Personal Pronouns in the Germanic Languages. A study of personal pronoun morphology and change in the Germanic languages from the first records to the present day''. [Studia Linguistica Germanica, 43]. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1996. (xxii + 390 pp.) pp. 193–195.</ref> In [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]], the old dual pronouns have replaced the standard plural pronouns, for example, accusative {{lang|bar|enk}}, ''you plural'' (from Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|inkw}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|inkwiz}}). A similar development in the pronoun system can be seen in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. Another remnant of the dual can be found in the use of the pronoun {{lang|da|begge}} (\"both\") in the Scandinavian languages of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], {{lang|sv|bägge}} in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and {{lang|is|báðir / báðar / bæði}} in Faroese and Icelandic. In these languages, in order to state \"all + number\", the constructions are {{lang|da|begge to}} / {{lang|is|báðir tveir / báðar tvær / bæði tvey}} (\"all two\") but {{lang|da|alle tre}} / {{lang|is|allir tríggir / allar tríggjar / øll trý}} (\"all three\"). In German, the expression {{lang|de|beide}} (\"both\") is equivalent to, though more commonly used than, {{lang|de|alle zwei}} (\"all two\").\n\n[[Norwegian Nynorsk]] also retains the conjunction \"korgje\" (\"one of two\") and its inverse \"korkje\" (\"neither of two\").\n\nAnother example of a lost dual exists in the Faroese ordinals first and second, which can be translated two ways: First there is {{lang|fo|fyrri}} and {{lang|fo|seinni}}, which mean the first and second of two respectively, while {{lang|fo|fyrsti}} and {{lang|fo|annar}} mean first and second of more than two.\n\n===Baltic languages===\nAmong the [[Baltic languages]], the dual form existed but is now nearly obsolete in standard [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. The dual form {{lang|lt|Du litu}} was still used on two-[[litas]] coins issued in 1925, but the plural form ({{lang|lt|2 litai}}) is used on later two-litas coins.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Dual was fully operable at the time of [[Old Church Slavonic]] manuscript writings, and it has been subsequently lost in most Slavic dialects in the historical period.\n\nOf the living languages, only [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]], some forms of [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] and [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] have preserved the dual number as a productive form. In all of the remaining languages, its influence is still found in the declension of nouns of which there are commonly only two: eyes, ears, shoulders, in certain fixed expressions, and the agreement of nouns when used with numbers.<ref>Mayer, Gerald L. (1973) \"Common Tendencies in the Syntactic Development of 'Two', 'Three,' and 'Four' in Slavic.\" ''The Slavic and East European Journal'' 17.3:308–314.</ref>\n\nIn all the languages, the words \"two\" and \"both\" preserve characteristics of the dual declension.

In Polish, for animate masculine nouns, the possible nominative forms are {{lang|pl|dwaj}}, or {{lang|pl|dwóch}}.\n# Variant form for the masculine/neuter locative and instrumental in Serbo-Croatian: {{lang|sr-Cyrl|двојим(а)}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|dvоjim(a)}}.\n\nIn Common Slavic, the rules were relatively simple for determining the appropriate case and number form of the noun, when it was used with a numeral. The following rules apply:\n# With the numeral \"one\", both the noun, adjective, and numeral were in the same singular case, with the numeral being declined as an pronoun.\n# With the numeral \"two\", both the noun, adjective, and numeral were in the same dual case. There were separate forms for the masculine and neuter-feminine nouns.\n# With the numerals \"three\" and \"four\", the noun, adjective, and numeral were in the same plural case.\n# With any numeral above \"four\", the numeral was followed by the noun and adjective in the genitive plural case. The numeral itself was actually a numeral noun that was declined according to its syntactic function.\n\nWith the loss of the dual in most of the Slavic languages, the above pattern now is only seen in the forms of the numbers for the tens, hundreds, and rarely thousands. This can be seen by examining the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Language\n! 10 !! 20 !! 30 !! 50\n! 100 !! 200 !! 300 !! 500\n|-\n!

In those Slavic languages that have lost the dual, the system has been simplified and changed in various ways, but many languages have kept traces of the dual in it. In general, Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian have extended the pattern of \"three/four\" to \"two\"; Russian, Belarusian and Serbo-Croatian have, on the contrary, extended the pattern of \"two\" to \"three/four\"; and Bulgarian and Macedonian have extended the pattern of \"two\" to all numerals. The resulting systems are as follows:\n# In Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian, numerals from \"two\" to \"four\" are always followed by a noun in the same plural case, but higher numerals (if in the nominative) are followed by a noun in the genitive plural.<ref>However, Ukrainian is special in that the form used with \"two\", \"three\" and \"form\" has the stress pattern of the genitive singular and thus of the old dual.</ref>\n# In Belarusian and Serbo-Croatian, numerals from \"two\" to \"four\" (if in the nominative) are followed by a noun in a form originating from the Common Slavic nominative dual, which has now completely or almost completely merged with the genitive singular.<ref>Browne, Wayles and Theresa Alt (2004) A Handbook of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian.

As an exception, the form of noun is also genitive plural if the numeral ends in 11 to 14.<ref>Paul V. Cubberley (2002) Russian: a linguistic introduction. p.141</ref> Also, some words (for example, many measure words, such as units) have a special \"[[Russian declension#Count form|count form]]\" (счётная форма) for use in numerical phrases instead of genitive (for some words mandatory, for others optional), for example, восемь мегабайт, пять килограмм and пять килограммов, три ряда́ and три ря́да, and полтора часа́.\n# In Bulgarian and Macedonian, all numerals are followed by a noun in a form originating from the Common Slavic nominative dual, which has now been re-interpreted as a \"count form\" or \"quantitative plural\".<ref>Friedman, Victor (2001) Macedonian. [http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/pdf/compgrammar_macedonian.pdf] P.19</ref>\n\nThese different systems are exemplified in the table below where the word \"wolf\" is used to form nominative noun phrases with various numerals.

Often the plural declension is used to give a figurative meaning. The table below summarizes the key such points.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Language\n| Examples\n|-\n! Czech\n| Certain body parts and their modifying adjectives require in the instrumental and genitive plural cases dual forms: {{lang|cs|se svýma očima}} (instrumental dual: \"with one's own (two) eyes\") or {{lang|cs|u nohou}} (genitive dual: \"at the (two) feet\"). Colloquial Czech will often substitute the dual instrumental for the literary plural instrumental case.\n|-\n! Polish\n| {{lang|pl|Oko}} (\"eye\") and {{lang|pl|ucho}} (\"ear\") have plural stems deriving from old dual forms, and alternative instrumental and genitive plural forms with archaic dual endings: gen. pl. {{lang|pl|oczu/ócz/oczów}}, {{lang|pl|uszu/uszów}}; instr. pl. {{lang|pl|oczami/oczyma}}, {{lang|pl|uszami/uszyma}}. The declension of {{lang|pl|ręka}} (\"hand, arm\") also contains old dual forms (nom./acc./voc. pl {{lang|pl|ręce}}, instr. pl. {{lang|pl|rękami/'''rękoma'''}}, loc. sg./pl. {{lang|pl|rękach/'''ręku'''}}). The historically dual forms are usually used to refer a person's two hands ({{lang|pl|dziecko na ręku}} \"child-in-arms\"), while the regularized plural forms are used elsewhere.  Other archaic dual forms, including dual verbs, can be encountered in older literature and in dialects: {{lang|pl|Jak nie '''chceta''', to nie '''musita'''}} \"If you don't want to, you don't have to\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Swan|first = Oscar E.|title = A Grammar of Contemporary Polish|publisher = Slavica|year = 2002|location = Bloomington, IN|isbn = 0-89357-296-9|pages=57, 199, 216}}</ref>\n|-\n! Slovak\n| In Slovak, the genitive plural and instrumental plural for the words \"eyes\" and \"ears\" has also retained its dual forms: {{lang|sk|očú/očí}} and {{lang|sk|ušú/uší}}.\n|-\n! Ukrainian\n| The words \"eyes\" and \"shoulders\" had dual forms in the instrumental plural case: {{lang|uk|очима }} {{lang|uk-Latn|ochyma}} (\"eyes\") and {{lang|uk|плечима  }} {{lang|uk-Latn|plechyma}} (\"shoulders\"). Furthermore, the nominative plural word {{lang|uk|вуса }} {{lang|uk-Latn|vusa}}, which is the dual of {{lang|uk|вус }} {{lang|uk-Latn|vus}} (\"whisker\"), refers to the moustache, while the true nominative plural word {{lang|uk|вуси }} {{lang|uk-Latn|vusy}} refers to whiskers.\n|-\n! Bulgarian\n| Some words such as {{lang|bg|ръка }} {{lang|bg-Latn|răka}} \"hand\" use the originally dual form as a plural ({{lang|bg|ръце }} {{lang|bg-Latn|rătse}}).\n|-\n! Russian\n| In Russian the word {{lang|ru|колено }} {{lang|ru-Latn|koleno}} (\"knee\", \"tribe (Israelites)\") has different plurals: {{lang|ru|колена }} {{lang|ru-Latn|kolena}} (\"Israelites\") is pure plural and {{lang|ru|колени }} {{lang|ru-Latn|koleni}} (body part) is a dual form. Some cases are different as well: {{lang|ru|коленами }} {{lang|ru-Latn|kolenami}} vs. {{lang|ru|коленями }} {{lang|ru-Latn|kolenyami}} (instr.pl.).\n|}\n\n==== Slovene ====\n{{See also|Slovene grammar}}\nAlong with the [[Sorbian languages]], [[Chakavian dialect]], and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] uses the dual. Although popular sources claim that Slovene has \"preserved full grammatical use of the dual,\"<ref name=\"MLD 2009\">{{cite news |url=http://www.stat.si/eng/novica_prikazi.aspx?id=2177 |title=International Mother Language Day |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Standard Slovene (and, to varying degrees, Slovene dialects) show significant reduction of the dual number system when compared with Common Slavic.<ref name=\"Jakop2008\">{{cite book|last=Jakop|first=Tjaša|title=The Dual in Slovene Dialects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQZ1Y9O7OLAC|year=2008|publisher=Brockmeyer|location=Bochum|isbn=978-3-8196-0705-9}}</ref> In general, dual forms have a tendency to be replaced by plural forms. This tendency is stronger in oblique cases than in the nominative/accusative: in standard Slovene, genitive and locative forms have merged with the plural, and in many dialects, pluralization has extended to dative/instrumental forms. Dual inflection is better preserved in masculine forms than in feminine forms.<ref>Jakop (2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gQZ1Y9O7OLAC&pg=PA104 pp. 104–105])</ref> Natural pairs are usually expressed with the plural in Slovene, not with the dual: e.g. {{lang|sl|roke}} \"hands\", {{lang|sl|ušesa}} ears. The dual forms of such nouns can be used, in conjunction with the quantifiers {{lang|sl|dva}} \"two\" or {{lang|sl|oba}} \"both\", to emphasize the number: e.g. {{lang|sl|Imam samo dve roki}} \"I only have two hands\". The words for \"parents\" and \"twins\" show variation in colloquial Slovene between plural ({{lang|sl|starši}}, {{lang|sl|dvojčki}}) and dual ({{lang|sl|starša}}, {{lang|sl|dvojčka}}).<ref>Jakop (2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gQZ1Y9O7OLAC&pg=PA6 pp. 6ff])</ref> Standard Slovene has replaced the nominative dual pronouns of Common Slavic ({{lang|sla|vě}} \"the two of us\", {{lang|sla|va}} \"the two of you\", {{lang|sla|ja/ji/ji}} \"the two of them\" [m./f./n.]) with new synthetic dual forms: {{lang|sl|midva/midve}} (literally, \"we-two\"), {{lang|sl|vidva/vidve}}, {{lang|sl|onadva/onidve/onidve}}.<ref>Derganc, Aleksandra. 2006.

There is considerable debate surrounding the appropriateness of using a single category for a [[heterogeneous]] group of individuals with complex needs and a varied range of problems. The concept can be used broadly, for example depression and alcoholism, or it can be restricted to specify severe mental illness (e.g. [[psychosis]], [[schizophrenia]]) and substance misuse disorder (e.g. [[cannabis abuse]]), or a person who has a milder mental illness and a drug dependency, such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and is [[opioid dependency|dependent on opioids]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899586899|title=Co-occurring disorders : integrated assessment and treatment of substance use and mental disorders.|last=Charles.|first=Atkins|date=2014|publisher=Pesi Publishing & Media|isbn=1937661520|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=899586899}}</ref> Diagnosing a primary psychiatric illness in substance abusers is challenging as [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]] itself often induces psychiatric symptoms, thus making it necessary to differentiate between substance induced and pre-existing mental illness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infiniterecovery.com/sober-living-austin/|title=Sober Living Austin|last=Austin|first=Infinite Recovery|last2=USA –206-9063|first2=Austin Drug Rehab|date=|website=Infinite Recovery|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThose with co-occurring disorders face complex challenges.

Similar patterns of comorbidity and risk factors in individuals with substance induced disorder and those with independent non-substance induced psychiatric symptoms suggest that the two conditions may share underlying etiologic factors.<ref>Blanco 2012 p. 865-873.</ref>\n\nDrug abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness, which can make it difficult to differentiate between substance induced psychiatric syndromes and pre-existing mental health problems. More often than not psychiatric disorders among drug or alcohol abusers disappear with prolonged abstinence. Substance induced psychiatric symptoms can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during the [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or [[major depression|depression]] after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Abuse of [[hallucinogens]] can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use and [[cannabis]] may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with use it may cause a state similar to [[dysthymia]]. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate sustained use of alcohol may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. A [[protracted withdrawal syndrome]] can also occur with psychiatric and other symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Among the currently prevalent medications, [[benzodiazepines]] are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Katie |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael J. |title=Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvUzR0obihEC |edition=2nd |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-446-8 |pages=75–76}}</ref>\n\nProspective epidemiological studies do not support the hypotheses that comorbidity of substance use disorders with other psychiatric illnesses is primarily a consequence of substance abuse or dependence or that increasing comorbidity is largely attributable to increasing use of substances.<ref>Frisher 2005 p. 847-850.</ref> Yet emphasis is often on the effects of substances on the brain creating the impression that dual disorders are a natural consequence of these substances. However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of [[neuronal]] plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to substance use disorders.\n\nResearch instruments are also often insufficiently sensitive to discriminate between independent, true dual pathology, and substance-induced symptoms. Structured instruments, as Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Short Screener-GAIN-SS and Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders for DSM-IV-PRISM,<ref>Hasin 2006 p. 689-696</ref> have been developed to increase the diagnostic validity. While structured instruments can help organize diagnostic information, clinicians must still make judgments on the origin of symptoms.\n\n==Prevalence==\nComorbidity of addictive disorders and other psychiatric disorders, i.e., dual disorders, is very common<ref>Adamson 2006 p. 164-170; Hasin et al, 2011</ref> and a large body of literature has accumulated demonstrating that mental disorders are strongly associated with substance use disorders. The 2011 USA National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 17.5% of adults with a mental illness had a co-occurring substance use disorder; this works out to 7.98 million people.<ref name=\"SAMHSA 2012\"/> Estimates of co-occurring disorders in Canada are even higher, with an estimated 40-60% of adults with a severe and persistent mental illness experiencing a substance use disorder in their lifetime.<ref name=\"Health Canada\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/adp-apd/bp_disorder-mp_concomitants/bp_concurrent_mental_health-eng.pdf |title=Best Practices: Concurrent Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders |author=Health Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nA study by Kessler et al. in the United States attempting to assess the [[prevalence]] of dual diagnosis found that 47% of clients with schizophrenia had a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder was significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness than in those without a psychotic illness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC |author2=McGonagle KA |author3=Zhao S |author4=Nelson CB |author5=Hughes M |author6=Eshleman S |author7=Wittchen HU |author8=Kendler KS  |year=1994 |title=Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders in the United States.

According to the clinician's ratings, around a third of the sample used [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[street drug]]s, or both during the six months before evaluation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drake RE |author2=Wallach MA |year=1993 |title=Moderate drinking among people with severe mental illness |journal=Hospital & Community Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=780–2 |pmid=8375841}}</ref>\n\nFurther UK studies have shown slightly more moderate rates of substance misuse among mentally ill individuals. One study found that individuals suffering from schizophrenia showed just a 7% prevalence of problematic drug use in the year prior to being interviewed and 21% reported problematic use some time before that.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cantwell |first1=R |author2=Scottish Comorbidity Study Group |year=2003 |title=Substance use and schizophrenia: effects on symptoms, social functioning and service use |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=182 |issue=4 |pages=324–9 |pmid=12668408 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.182.4.324}}</ref>\n\nWright and colleagues identified individuals with psychotic illnesses who had been in contact with services in the London borough of [[Croydon]] over the previous 6 months. Cases of alcohol or substance misuse and dependence were identified through [[structured interview|standardized interviews]] with clients and keyworkers.

There are diagnoses for substance-induced mood disorders and substance-induced anxiety disorders and thus such overlap can be complicated. For this reason, the [[DSM-IV]] advises that diagnoses of primary [[psychiatric]] disorders not be made in the absence of [[sobriety]] (of duration sufficient to allow for any substance-induced [[Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome|post-acute-withdrawal]] symptoms to dissipate) up to 1 year.\n\n==Treatment==\nOnly a small proportion of those with co-occurring disorders actually receive treatment for both disorders. Therefore, it was argued that a new approach is needed to enable clinicians, researchers and managers to offer adequate assessment and evidence-based treatments to patients with dual pathology, who cannot be adequately and efficiently managed by cross-referral between psychiatric and addiction services as currently configured and resourced.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weaver T, Madden P, Charles V, etal| year = 2003 | title = Comorbidity of substance misuse and mental illness in community mental health and substance misuse services | url = | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 183 | issue = 4| pages = 304–313 | doi=10.1192/bjp.183.4.304}}</ref> In 2011, it was estimated that only 12.4% of American adults with co-occurring disorders were receiving both mental health and addictions treatment.<ref name=\"SAMHSA 2012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k11MH_FindingsandDetTables/2K11MHFR/NSDUHmhfr2011.htm |title=Results from the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Mental Health Findings |author=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |year=2012 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> Clients with co-occurring disorders face challenges accessing treatment, as they may be excluded from mental health services if they admit to a substance abuse problem, and vice versa.<ref name=senate/>\n\nThere are multiple approaches to treating concurrent disorders.

These interact with stressful life events and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance abuse may increase it, causing the individual to be more likely to experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances. These individuals, therefore, are \"supersensitive\" to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.\n\nAlthough there are limitations in the research studies conducted in this area, namely that most have focused primarily on schizophrenia, this theory provides an explanation of why relatively low levels of substance misuse often result in negative consequences for individuals with severe mental illness.<ref name=mueser_AB/>\n\n==Avoiding categorical diagnosis==\nCurrent nosological approach does not provide a framework for internal (sub-threshold symptoms) or external (comorbidity) heterogeneity of the different [[diagnostic]] categories.<ref>Szerman N, Martinez-Raga J, Peris L. et al.

A pairing would usually not apply for critical votes, such as no-confidence votes.\n\nThe member abstaining from voting is referred to as a '''pair'''. In the United States, pairing is an informal arrangement between members and the pairs are called '''live pairs'''. An alternative method of maintaining the relative voting positions of parties in a legislative body is [[proxy voting]], which is not commonly used, but is used, for example, in [[New Zealand]].<ref>[[New Zealand House of Representatives]] Standing Orders, sections 155-156.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], following the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]], the [[Gillard Government]] formed a [[minority government]] with the support of a number of votes from minor parties and independents, and the Opposition refused to grant automatic pairing,<ref>news.com.au, 28 Sept 2010: [http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/tony-abbott-gets-tough-on-pair-for-julia-gillard/story-fn5tas5k-1225930463321 Tony Abbott gets tough on pair for Julia Gillard]</ref><ref>The Australian, 29 Sept 2010: [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/tony-abbott-puts-the-whole-house-of-representatives-under-arrest/story-e6frg6n6-1225931409634 Tony Abbott puts federal ministers under virtual house arrest]</ref> leading to some embarrassment and reversals for the Opposition when, for example, a pair was initially not given for a member to care for her sick baby<ref>[https://au.news.yahoo.com/nsw/a/17172646/michelle-rowland-granted-pair-to-care-for-sick-baby/ Michelle Rowland granted pair to care for sick baby]</ref> or to attend at the birth of his baby.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 9 Sept 2011:[http://www.smh.com.au/national/abbott-agrees-to-pair-for-thomson-20110909-1k1k6.html Abbott agrees to pair for Thomson]</ref>\n\nA pair has also been granted to minor party legislators.

NDP MP Ed Broadbent, who planned to vote in support of the government, abstained from voting so that independent MP Chuck Cadman, who planned to vote against the government but was sick, could stay at home. The Liberals narrowly won the vote, with the Speaker breaking the tie.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/civility-thats-the-word/article1330460/</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nPairing in the Swedish [[Riksdag]] is a voluntary agreement run by appointed members of most of the represented political parties, called ''Kvittningspersoner.'' The system is intended to enable MPs to abstain from votes for electorate events, study trips etc, without affecting the likely outcome of the vote.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn 1976, the Conservatives broke off pairing after accusing the Labour whips of bringing in an MP who was supposed to have been paired off. Later in the Commons, Michael Heseltine  removed the House of Commons mace and swung in the chamber, which led to the suspension the session and subsequently of pairing. The aftermath included Labour MP Shirley Williams being recalled from a visit to China moments after landing, turning around and getting back on to the plane. In 1979, the [[Callaghan Ministry|government]] of [[James Callaghan]] [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|fell by one vote]], partially due to Labour [[Whip (politics)|deputy whip]] [[Walter Harrison (politician)|Walter Harrison]] suspending the unspoken obligation of his Conservative counterpart [[Bernard Weatherill]] to pair for the terminally ill Labour backbencher Sir [[Alfred Broughton]] after Weatherill was unable to find an MP in his party willing to pair on such an important vote{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. Pairing in the [[British House of Commons]] was suspended by a decision of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Chief Whips, [[Donald Dewar]] and [[Archy Kirkwood, Baron Kirkwood of Kirkhope|Archy Kirkwood]] on 17 December 1996, following an incident when they claimed to find the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government cheating in a vote by pairing the same three Conservative MPs with three absent Labour MPs as well as three absent Liberal Democrat MPs. The decision came into effect on 13 January 1997.<ref name=\"Pairing called off\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/now-theyre-getting-dirty-1314998.html |title=Now they're getting dirty |publisher=The Independent |first1=Anthony |last1=Bevins |first2=Colin |last2=Brown |date=18 December 1996}}</ref> It is not clear how long this protest lasted. In the 1997 general election, Labour were elected with a huge majority. Pairing is currently practised by both major parties in the British House of Commons and the Liberal Democrats, but only for votes that are not of great importance (one or two line whips).<ref name=\"On pairing\">http://thoughtundermined.com/2011/11/03/on-pairing/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82599.stm |title=Pairing |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nTrust in pairing was shaken again in the 2017 parliament.  In June, Labour MP Naz Shah was controversially pushed through the lobby in a wheelchair, still under the impact of morphine, claiming that pairing was not offered, which was denied by the Conservative government. In July 2018, Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson was paired with Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis due to her being on maternity leave. Lewis missed the first seven votes of the session, but then voted with the government in two votes that were viewed as close, one of which was only won because four Labour members voted against the party. Conservative whip Julian Smith later admitted that Lewis had been asked to vote \"in error\" and Lewis apologised calling it an \"honest mistake\". Swinson, along with other MP's had been pressuring the government to allow MP's who were ill, recently bereaved or on maternity or paternity leave to vote \"by proxy\" (meaning they would be able to nominate someone to vote in their place), which would reduce the need for pairing. Calls for this to be approved gained strength in the immediate aftermath of the event.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], pairing is referred to as a live pair, which is an informal voluntary agreement between members, not specifically authorized or recognized by House or Senate rules. Live pairs are agreements which members make to nullify the effect of absences on the outcome of recorded votes. If a member expects to be absent for a vote, he or she may \"pair off\" with another member who will be present and who would vote on the other side of the question, but who agrees not to vote.

The [[1908 World Figure Skating Championships|ISU World Figure Skating Championships]] introduced pair skating in 1908.\n\nLike the other disciplines, pair skating competitions consist of two segments, the [[Short program (figure skating)|Short program]] and the [[free skating]] program.  There are seven required elements in the short program, which lasts 2 minutes and 40 seconds for both junior and senior pair teams.  Free skating for pairs \"consists of a well balanced program composed and skated to music of the pair's own choice for a specified period of time\".<ref name=\"ISU2018-117\">S&P/ID 2018, p. 117</ref>  It also should contain \"especially typical Pair Skating moves\" such as [[Figure skating spins#Pair skating and ice dance|pair spins]], [[Figure skating lifts#Pair lifts|lifts]], partner assisted [[Figure skating jumps#Jumps in pair skating|jumps]], [[spirals]] and other similar moves, \"linked harmoniously by steps and other movements\".<ref name=\"ISU2018-117\"/>  Its duration, like the other disciplines, is 4 minutes for senior teams, and 3 1/2 minutes for junior teams.  Pair skating required elements include lifts, twist lifts, throw jumps, jumps, spin combinations, [[death spiral (figure skating)|death spirals]], [[step sequence]]s, and [[choreographic sequence]]s.  The elements performed by pairs teams must be \"linked together by connecting steps of a different nature\"<ref name=\"ISU2018-111\"/> and by other comparable movements and with a variety of holds and positions.  Pair skaters must only execute the prescribed elements; if they do not, the extra or unprescribed elements will not be counted in their score. Only the first attempt of an element will be included. Violations in pair skating include falls, time, music, and clothing.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Edgar and Madge Syers.jpg|right|thumb|150px|German pair team [[Madge Syers]] and [[Edgar Syers]] at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G0313-0017-001, Ludmilla Beloussowa, Oleg Protopopow.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Liudmila Belousova]] and [[Oleg Protopopov]] (the \"Protopopovs\"), in 1968]]\n\nThe [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) defines pair skating as \"the skating of two persons in unison who perform their movements in such harmony with each other as to give the impression of genuine Pair Skating as compared with independent Single Skating\".<ref name=\"ISU2018-111\">S&P/ID 2018, p. 111</ref>  The ISU also states that a pairs team must consist of \"one Lady and one Man\"<ref name=\"ISU2018-9\"/> and that \"attention should be paid to the selection of an appropriate partner\".<ref name=\"ISU2018-111\"/>{{refn|group=note|Women are referred to as ladies in ISU regulations and communications.}}\n\nPair skating, along with men's and women's single skating, has been an Olympic discipline since figure skating, the oldest Winter Olympic sport, was introduced at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympic Games]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.olympic.org/figure-skating-equipment-and-history |website=Olympic.org |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref>  The [[1908 World Figure Skating Championships|ISU World Figure Skating Championships]] introduced pair skating, along with women's singles, also in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |title=ISU Archives - History of Figure Skating |url=https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating-ice-dance/figure-skating-other/news-fs/11675-archives-history-of-figure-skating?highlight=WyJoaXN0b3J5Il0=&templateParam=15 |publisher=International Skating Union |accessdate=3 December 2018 |location=Lausanne, Switzerland |date=2 November 2017}}</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the rising popularity of skating during the 19th century led to the development of figure skating techniques, especially the \"various forms of hand-in-hand skating that would become the basis of pair skating.\"<ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 61-62</ref> [[Madge Syers]], the first female figure skater to compete and win internationally, stated that from the beginning of the introduction of pair skating in international competitions, it was a popular sport for audience to watch, and that \"if the pair are well matched and clever performers, it is undoubtedly the most attractive to watch\".<ref name=\"syers-121\">{{cite book |last1=Syers |first1=Edgar |last2=Syers |first2=Madge |title=The Book of Winter Sports |date=1908 |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |page=121 |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofwinterspor00syer |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref>  British pair skater [[Madge Syers]] stated that Viennese skaters were responsible for pair skating's popularity at the beginning of the 20th century.

There are no limits to the numbers of revolutions executed.<ref name=\"ISU2018-118\"/><ref name=\"skatecanada\"/><ref name=\"techpanel-23\">Techn Panel, p. 23</ref>\n\nJudges look for the following when evaluating twist lifts: speed at entry and exit; whether or not the woman performs a split position while on her way to the top of the twist lift; her height once she gets there; clean rotations; a clean catch by the male (accomplished by placing both hands at the woman's waist and without any part of her upper body touching him); and a one-foot exit executed by both partners.  Pair teams can earn more points if the woman executes a split position (each leg is at least 45° from her body axis and her legs are straight or almost straight) before rotating.  They also earn more points when the man's arms are sideways and straight or almost straight after he releases the woman.  They lose points for not having enough rotations, one-half a rotation or more.<ref name=\"skatecanada\"/><ref name=\"techpanel-23\"/>\n\nThe first quadruple twist lift performed in international competition was by Russian pair team [[Marina Cherkasova]] and [[Sergei Shakhrai]] at the European Championship in 1977.<ref>Hines, p. 57</ref>\n\n===Solo jumps and throw jumps===\n{{main|Figure skating jumps#Jumps in pair skating}}\n\n====Solo jumps====\n\nPairs teams, both juniors and seniors, must perform one solo jump during their short programs; it can include a double flip or double axel for juniors, and any kind of double or triple jump for seniors.  In the free skate, both juniors and seniors must perform only one solo jump and only one jump combination or sequence.{{refn|group=note|A jump sequence consists of two jumps, with no limitations on the number of revolutions per jump.  It starts with any type of jump, immediately followed by an axel-type jump.}}  Skaters must, during a jump combination, make sure that they land on the same foot they took off on, and that they execute a full rotation on the ice between the jumps.  They can, however, execute a [[Euler jump|Euler]] between the two jumps.  When the Euler is performed separately, it is considered an unlisted jump.<ref>Tech Panel, p. 14</ref>  Junior pairs, during their short programs, earn no points for the solo jump if they perform a different jump than what is required.  Both junior and senior pairs earn no points if, during their free skating programs, they repeat a jump with over two revolutions.<ref name=\"techpanel-16\">Tech Panel, p. 16</ref>\n\nAll jumps are considered in the order in which they were performed.  If the partners do not execute the same number of revolutions during a solo jump or part of a jump sequence or combination (which can consist of two or three jumps), only the jump with the fewer revolutions will be counted in their score.<ref>S&P/ID 2018, pp. 113, 118</ref>  The double axel and all triple and quadruple jumps, which have more than two revolutions, must be different from one another, although jump sequences and combinations can include the same two jumps.  Extra jumps that do not fulfill the requirements are not counted in the team's score.<ref name=\"ISU2018-118\"/>  They are allowed, however, to execute the same two jumps during a jump combination or sequence.  If they perform any or both jump or jumps incorrectly, only the incorrectly-done jump is not counted and it is not considered a jump sequence or combination.  Both partner can execute two solo jumps during their short programs, but the second jump is worth less points than the first.<ref name=\"techpanel-16\"/>\n\nA jump attempt, in which one or both partners execute a clear preparation for a take-off but step to the entry edge or place their skate's toe pick into the ice and leaves the ice with or without a turn, counts as one jump element. If the partners execute an unequal number of rotations during a solo jump or as part of a jump combination or sequence, the jump with the lesser number of revolutions will be counted. They receive no points if they perform different types of jumps.  A small hop or a jump with up to one-half revolution (considered \"decoration\") is not marked as a jump and called a \"transition\" instead.  Non-listed jumps do not count as jumps, either, but can also be called a transition and can be used as \"a special entrance to the jump\".<ref name=\"techpanel-15\">Tech Panel, p. 15</ref>  If the partners execute a spin and a jump back to back, or vice versa, they are considered separate elements and the team is awarded more points for executing a difficult take-off or entry.<ref name=\"techpanel-15\"/>  They lose points if the partners fall or step out of a jump during a jump sequence or combination.<ref name=\"techpanel-16\"/>\n\n====Throw jumps====\n[[File:John baldwin skater.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Rena Inoue]] and [[John Baldwin (figure skater)|John Baldwin, Jr.]] in 2004]]\n\nThrow jumps are \"partner assisted jumps in which the Lady is thrown into the air by the Man on the take-off and lands without assistance from her partner on a backward outside edge\".<ref name=\"ISU2018-113\"/>  Skate Canada says, \"the male partner assists the female into flight\".<ref name=\"skatecanada\"/>  The types of throw jumps include: the throw axel, the throw [[Salchow jump|salchow]], the throw toe loop, the throw loop, the throw flip, and the throw lutz.

[[wiktionary:Retrogression|Retrogressions]] are not allowed.<ref name=\"techpanel-2\"/>\n\nAll turns and steps must be performed on one foot, and they should have variety, which the ISU defines as at least 9 difficult turns and steps executed by both partners.  The ISU also considers simple variety in step sequences at least seven difficult turns and steps, and minimum variety at least five difficult turns and steps.  The types of turns and steps can only be counted once per sequence.  The team must skate three meters or less near each other while executing the crossing feature of the sequence.<ref>Tech Panel, pp. 2, 3</ref>  They must not separate, with no breaks, for at least 1/2 of the sequence.  Changes of holds, which can include \"a brief moment\" when the partners do not touch, are permitted during the step sequence.<ref>Tech Panel, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe workload between the partners must be even and will help them earn more points.  More points are rewarded to teams when they change places or holds, or when they perform difficult skating moves together.<ref name=\"ISU2018-114\"/>  Teams also earn more points for the following: if they use difficult skating moves together and change holds and places during step sequences; if they execute rotations to either the right or the left, \"with full body rotation covering at least 1/3 of the pattern in total for each rotational direction\";<ref name=\"techpanel-2\"/>{{refn|group=note|\"Full body rotations\" are defined as having one complete rotation, not turning half a revolution back and forth.<ref name=\"techpanel-3\">Tech Panel, p. 3</ref>}} if they use their body movements for at least 1/3 of the pattern; changes in position (defined as \"crossing at least three times while doing steps and turns\"<ref name=\"techpanel-2\"/>) for at least 1/3 of the sequence but not over 1/2 of it; and if the partners execute two different combinations of three difficult turns.<ref name=\"techpanel-2\"/>\n\nBoth partners must execute the combinations of difficult turns at the same time and with a clear rhythm, although they do not have to execute the same kind of turns.  Partners can perform [[Rocker turn|rockers]], [[Counter turn|counters]], [[Bracket turn|brackets]], loops, and [[twizzle]]s during combinations of difficult turns.  [[3 turn|Three turns]], changes of edges, jumps and/or hops, and changes of feet are not allowed, and \"at least one turn in the combination must be of a different type than the others\".<ref name=\"techpanel-3\"/>  Two combinations of difficult turns are the same if they consist of the same turns performed in the same order, on the same foot and on the same edges.<ref name=\"techpanel-3\"/>\n\nRotations to either the right or the left can be accomplished with any listed and unlisted steps and turns, as long as they are done continuously in one direction for at least 1/3 of the sequence and then continuously for at least 1/3 of the sequence in the opposite direction (clockwise and anti-clockwise)\".<ref name=\"techpanel-3\"/>  Rotations can also be performed throughout the length of the sequence the skaters are rotating with any unlisted and listed steps and turns they choose, for at least 1/3 of the total sequence and at least 1/3 of the total sequence in the opposite direction (also clockwise and anti-clockwise).  Use of body movements is defined as the visible use by both partners any movements of the arms, and/or hips and/or legs and/or head and/or torso.

An [[animal]] or [[machine]] that usually moves in a '''bipedal''' manner is known as a '''biped''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|p|ɛ|d}}, meaning \"two feet\" (from the [[Latin]] ''bis'' for \"double\" and ''pes'' for \"foot\"). Types of bipedal movement include [[walking]], [[running]], or [[jumping|hopping]].\n\nFew modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. Within [[mammal]]s, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, [[Dipodomyinae|kangaroo rats and mice]], [[springhare]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heglund | first1 = NC | last2 = Cavagna | first2 = GA | last3 = Taylor | first3 = CR | year = 1982 | title = Energetics and mechanics of terrestrial locomotion.

In the [[Triassic]] period some groups of [[archosaur]]s (a group that includes [[crocodile]]s and [[dinosaur]]s) developed bipedalism; among the [[dinosaur]]s, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the [[bird]]s are members of a clade of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs, the [[Theropod]]s.\n\nA larger number of modern species intermittently or briefly use a bipedal gait. Several [[lizard]] species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment, though there are a few cases where they walk on their hindlimbs only. Several arboreal primate species, such as [[gibbon]]s and [[Indriidae|indriids]], exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''bi(s)'' 'two' and ''ped-'' 'foot', as contrasted with [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] 'four feet'.\n\n==Advantages==\nLimited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages.  Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths.  While upright, non-locomotory [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in giant pangolin), combat (in bears, great apes and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage (in certain species of octopus).  \n\nThe maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – both the [[ostrich]] and the [[red kangaroo]] can reach speeds of {{convert|70|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[cheetah]] can exceed {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Garland_1983_JZL\">{{cite journal|last=Garland|first=T.

Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut — for example, humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary. There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases are a result of conditions such as [[Uner Tan syndrome]] — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior.<ref name=\"HumphreyEtAl2005HumanHandWalkers\">{{cite web | url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf | title=Human Hand-Walkers: Five Siblings Who Never Stood Up | author1=Humphrey, N. | author2=Skoyles, J.R. | author3=Keynes, R. | publisher=Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London School of Economics | year=2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910205939/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf | archivedate=2008-09-10 | df= }}</ref> Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that \"normal\" humans can crawl on hands and knees. This article therefore avoids the terms \"facultative\" and \"obligate\", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion ''normally'' used by various groups of animals. Normal humans may be considered \"obligate\" bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usually only resorted to when walking is impossible.\n\n==Movement==\nThere are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism.\n\n# [[Standing]]. Staying still on both legs. In most bipeds this is an active process, requiring constant adjustment of balance.\n# [[Walking]]. One foot in front of another, with at least one foot on the ground at any time.\n# [[Running]]. One foot in front of another, with periods where both feet are off the ground.\n# [[Jumping]]/hopping. Moving by a series of jumps with both feet moving together.\n\n==Bipedal animals==\nThe great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds, with bipedalism exhibited by only a handful of living groups. Humans, [[gibbon|gibbons]] and large birds [[walking|walk]] by raising one foot at a time.  On the other hand, most macropods, smaller birds, lemurs and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously. [[Tree kangaroo]]s are able to walk or hop, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground.\n\n===Amphibians===\nThere are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians.\n\n===Extant reptiles===\nMany species of [[lizards]] become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus ''[[Ctenosaura]]'').\n\n====Early reptiles and lizards====\nThe first known biped is the [[bolosaurid]] ''[[Eudibamus]]'' whose fossils date from 290 million years ago.<ref>{{cite news | title = Upright lizard leaves dinosaur standing | date=  2000-11-03 | work = cnn.com | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071031005956/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal | author=Berman, David S. | title=Early Permian Bipedal Reptile | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | year=2000 | volume=290 | issue=5493 | pages=969–972 | doi=10.1126/science.290.5493.969 | pmid=11062126 | bibcode=2000Sci...290..969B | display-authors=etal | df= }}</ref> Its long hindlegs, short forelegs, and distinctive joints all suggest bipedalism.

The fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there. The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years.<ref>Shreeve, James, [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/Sunset.Savanna.doc \"Sunset on the savanna\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928010036/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/Sunset.Savanna.doc |date=2017-09-28 }}, ‘’Discover'', 1996</ref>\n\nSome of the fossils found actually showed that there was still an adaptation to arboreal life.

While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach up to grab for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits because they were so convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the ''[[Australopithecus]]'' hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to [[humans]]. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288349918_The_postural_feeding_hypothesis_An_ecological_model_for_the_evolution_of_bipedalism)\n\nA similar study conducted by Thorpe et al. looked at how the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, held onto supporting branches in order to navigate branches that were too flexible or unstable otherwise.  They found that in more than 75% of locomotive instances the orangutans used their hands to stabilize themselves while they navigated thinner branches.   They hypothesized that increased fragmentation of forests where A. afarensis as well as other ancestors of modern humans and other apes resided  could have contributed to this increase of bipedalism in order to navigate the diminishing forests.  Their findings also shed light on a couple of discrepancies observed in the anatomy of A. afarensis, such as the ankle joint, which allowed it to “wobble” and long, highly flexible forelimbs.  The idea that bipedalism started from walking in trees explains both the increased flexibility in the ankle as well as the long limbs which would be used to grab hold of branches.\n\n===Provisioning model===\nOne theory on the origin of bipedalism is the behavioral model presented by [[Owen Lovejoy (anthropologist)|C. Owen Lovejoy]], known as \"male provisioning\".<ref name=\"Price\">{{cite book\n|author1=T. Douglas Price |author2=Gary M.

In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early [[hominids]] engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring. Lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the offspring survivorship and increase the pair's reproductive rate. Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs. This model is supported by the reduction (\"feminization\") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunet|first=Michel|author2=Guy F|author3=Pilbeam D|author4=Mackaye HT|author5=Likius A|title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa|journal=Nature|date=11 July 2002|volume=418|pages=145–151|doi=10.1038/nature00879|pmid=12110880|issue=6894|display-authors=etal|df=}}</ref> and ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suwa|first=Gen|author2=Kono RT |author3=Simpson SW |author4=Asfaw B |author5=Lovejoy CO |author6=White TD |title=Paleobiological implications of the ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' dentition|journal=Science|date=2 October 2009|volume=326|pages=94–99|doi=10.1126/science.1175824|pmid=19810195|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/211460/files/PAL_E4443.pdf|issue=5949|bibcode = 2009Sci...326...94S }}</ref> which along with low body size dimorphism in ''Ardipithecus''<ref>White TD et al.

Science. 2009 326(5949):74e1-8.</ref> In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of [[sexual swelling]]) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHowever, this model has been debated, as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous. Among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size. That is [[sexual dimorphism]] is minimal, and other studies have suggested that [[Australopithecus afarensis]] males were nearly twice the weight of females. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk.<ref>Lovejoy CO. Science. 1981 211(4480):341-50.</ref> Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom<ref>Keith Oatley, Dacher Keltner, Jennifer M. Jenkins. Understanding Emotion (2006) Second Edition. Page 235.</ref> and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as [[gibbon]]s tend to be also territorial, but fossil evidence indicates that ''Australopithecus afarensis'' lived in large groups. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a pair-bonded though group living primate.\n\n===Early bipedalism in homininae model===\nRecent studies of 4.4 million years old  ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' suggest bipedalism. It is thus possible that bipedalism evolved very early in [[homininae]] and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized. According to Richard Dawkins in his book \"[[The Ancestor's Tale]]\",  chimps and bonobos are descended from ''[[Australopithecus]]'' gracile type species while gorillas are descended from [[Paranthropus]]. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins. Early [[homininae]]s such as ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and [[gorilla]]s<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19667206 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901280106 | pmc=2732797 | volume=106 | issue=34 | title=Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor |date=August 2009 | journal=Proc.

It is also proposed that one cause of [[Neanderthal extinction]] was a less efficient running.\n\n===Warning display (aposematic) model===\n[[Joseph Jordania]] from the University of Melbourne recently (2011) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on [[aposematism]], or [[warning display]] and [[intimidation]] of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time. Several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal:  upright bipedal posture, longer legs, long tightly coiled hair on the top of the head, [[body painting]], threatening synchronous body movements, loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing/stomping/drumming on external subjects.<ref>[[Joseph Jordania]]. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011</ref> Slow locomotion and strong body odor (both characteristic for hominids and humans) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators.\n\n===Other behavioural models===\nThere are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski & Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others (''e.g.'' Dart 1925) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins (''e.g.'' 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested (''e.g.'' Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive, as well as increased sexual signaling in upright female posture.<ref name=\"Dean, F 2000\"/>\n\n===Thermoregulatory model===\nThe thermoregulatory model explaining the origin of bipedalism is one of the simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = P.E. | year = 1984 | title = The evolution of bipedality and loss of functional body hair in hominids | url = | journal = J.

During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of [[Ardipithecus]] reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the [[forest]] and [[woodland]] environmental [[preadaptation]] of early-stage [[hominid]] bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of [[natural selection]]. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions [[ecological niche]], rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus. A feedback mechanism from the advantages of bipedality in hot and open habitats would then in turn make a forest preadaptation solidify as a permanent state.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David-Barrett | first1 = T. | last2 = Dunbar | first2 = R. | year = 2016 | title = Bipedality and hair loss in human evolution revisited: The impact of altitude and activity scheduling | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.006 | journal = J.

Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought. Gordon Hewes (1961) suggested that the carrying of meat \"over considerable distances\" (Hewes 1961:689) was the key factor. Isaac (1978) and Sinclair et al. (1986) offered modifications of this idea, as indeed did Lovejoy (1981) with his \"provisioning model\" described above. Others, such as Nancy Tanner (1981), have suggested that infant carrying was key, while others again have suggested stone tools and weapons drove the change.<ref>Tanner, Nancy Makepeace [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1425592 \"On Becoming Human\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522084709/http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1425592 |date=2013-05-22 }} Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981</ref> This stone-tools theory is very unlikely, as though ancient humans were known to hunt, the discovery of tools was not discovered for thousands of years after the origin of bipedalism, chronologically precluding it from being a driving force of evolution. (Wooden tools and spears fossilize poorly and therefore it is difficult to make a judgment about their potential usage.)\n\n===Wading models===\nThe observation that large primates, including especially the great apes, that predominantly move quadrupedally on dry land, tend to switch to bipedal locomotion in waist deep water, has led to the idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments.  This idea, labelled \"the wading hypothesis\",<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuliukas A |title=Wading Hypotheses of the Origin of Human Bipedalism |journal=Human Evolution |volume=28 |issue=3–4 |pages=213–236 |date=2013}}</ref> was originally suggested by the [[Oxford University|Oxford]] [[marine biologist]] [[Alister Hardy]] who said: \"It seems to me likely that Man learnt to stand erect first in water and then, as his balance improved, he found he became better equipped for standing up on the shore when he came out, and indeed also for running.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hardy|first= Alister C. | year=1960 | title=Was man more aquatic in the past? | journal=[[New Scientist]] | volume=7 | issue=174| authorlink=Alister Hardy | pages=642–645 | url=http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/Hardy/Hardy1960.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326175059/http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/Hardy/Hardy1960.pdf | archivedate=26 March 2009 |ref=harv}}</ref> It was then promoted by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]], as part of the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]], who cited bipedalism among a cluster of other human traits unique among primates, including voluntary control of breathing, hairlessness and subcutaneous fat.<ref name = Morgan1997>{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Elaine | authorlink = Elaine Morgan (writer) | title = The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis   | year = 1997 | publisher = Souvenir Press | isbn = 978-0-285-63518-0  }}</ref>  The \"[[aquatic ape hypothesis]]\", as originally formulated, has not been accepted or considered a serious theory within the anthropological scholarly community.<ref name = Meier>{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-02-864421-9 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?doi=r_Wit4KYSmMC&pg=PA57 57–59]}}</ref> Others, however, have sought to promote wading as a factor in the origin of human bipedalism without referring to further (\"aquatic ape\" related) factors.

It has also been thought that consistent water-based food sources had developed early hominid dependency and facilitated dispersal along seas and rivers.<ref>{Verhaegena, M., P. F. Puechb, S. Munro. 2002. Aquaboreal ancestors? Trends in Evolution and Ecology: 212 – 217.}</ref>\n\n=== Consequences ===\nDuring the hominin’s early evolution, brains became larger, due to increased intelligence, and bipedalism became the norm. The consequences of these two changes in particular resulted in painful and difficult labor due to the increased favor of a narrow pelvis for bipedalism being countered by larger heads passing through the constricted birth canal. This phenomenon is commonly known as the [[obstetrical dilemma]].\n\n==Physiology==\nBipedal movement occurs in a number of ways, and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations. Some of these are described below.\n\n===Biomechanics===\n\n====Standing====\nEnergy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid [[feedback|overcorrection]].  The difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly, even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness.\n\n====Shoulder stability====\nShoulder stability would decrease with the evolution of bipedalism.  Shoulder mobility would increase because the need for a stable shoulder is only present in arboreal habitats. Shoulder mobility would support suspensory locomotion behaviors which are present in human bipedalism. The forelimbs are freed from weight-bearing requirements, which makes the shoulder a place of evidence for the evolution of bipedalism.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Sylvester | first1 = Adam D | year = 2006\n | title = Locomotor Coupling and the Origin of Hominin Bipedalism\n | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology\n | volume = 242 | issue = 3| pages = 581–590\n | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.04.016\n| pmid = 16782133 }}\n</ref>\n\n====Walking====\nWalking is characterized by an \"inverted pendulum\" movement in which the [[center of gravity]] vaults over a stiff leg with each step.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1sz5501URh0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=macmahon+muscles#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Muscles, reflexes, and locomotion | isbn = 978-0-691-02376-2 | author1 = McMahon | first1 = Thomas A | year = 1984}}</ref>  [[Force plate]]s can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>  This model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = A moving topic: control and dynamics of animal locomotion | isbn = 978-0-19-850022-3 | author1 = Biewener | first1 = Andrew A | year = 2003 | pmid = 20410030 | last2 = Daniel | first2 = T | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–8 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0294 | pmc = 2880073 | journal = Biology Letters}}</ref>\n\nIn humans, walking is composed of several separate processes:<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n* Vaulting over a stiff stance leg\n* Passive ballistic movement of the swing leg\n* A short 'push' from the ankle prior to toe-off, propelling the swing leg\n* Rotation of the hips about the axis of the spine, to increase stride length\n* Rotation of the hips about the horizontal axis to improve balance during stance\n\n====Running====\nRunning is characterized by a spring-mass movement.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>  Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>  Again, the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Musculature===\nBipedalism requires strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs. Contrast in [[domestication|domesticated]] [[poultry]] the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings.

Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] system is functioning. During a sprint the anaerobic system kicks in and breathing slows until the anaerobic system can no longer sustain a sprint.\n\n==Bipedal robots==\n{{Main|Humanoid robot|Chicken walker}}\n[[Image:Asimo.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[ASIMO]] - a bipedal robot]]\nFor nearly the whole of the 20th century, bipedal [[robot]]s were very difficult to construct and [[robot locomotion]] involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible. Some notable biped robots are [[ASIMO]], [[HUBO]], [[MABEL(robot)|MABEL]] and [[QRIO]].

It is not the same as the [[law of excluded middle]], however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.<ref name=\"Tomassi1999\"/>\n\nThe principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which [[Natural language|natural-language]] statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences which predict events in the future, and sentences which seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.<ref name=\"Tomassi1999\"/> [[Many-valued logic]]s formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the [[Entailment|notion of consequence]] requires the admissibility of premises which, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by [[free logic]]s.<ref name=\"GabbayWoods2007\">{{cite book|author1=Dov M.

The difference between the principle and the law is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.<ref name=\"Tomassi1999\"/> For example, the [[three-valued logic|three-valued]] [[Logic of Paradox]] (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the [[law of non-contradiction]], ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its [[intended interpretation|intended semantics]] is not bivalent.<ref name=\"Priest2008\">{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=An introduction to non-classical logic: from if to is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXVbmAw3YwC&pg=PA124|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85433-7|pages=124–125}}</ref> In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the [[law of non-contradiction]] hold.<ref name=\"Goble2001bis\">{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&pg=PA309|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=309}}</ref>\n\nMany modern [[logic programming]] systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]].  The programmer may wish to add the law of the excluded middle by explicitly asserting it as true; however, it is not assumed ''a priori''.\n\n== Classical logic ==\nThe intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for classical logic. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, \"true\" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and \"false\" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than \"true\" and \"false\". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.\n\nAssigning Boolean semantics to classical [[predicate calculus]] requires that the model be a [[complete Boolean algebra]] because the [[universal quantifier]] maps to the [[infimum]] operation, and the [[existential quantifier]] maps to the [[supremum]];<ref name=\"SørensenUrzyczyn2006\">{{cite book|author1=Morten Heine Sørensen|author2=Paweł Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&pg=PA206|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52077-7|pages=206–207}}</ref> this is called a [[Boolean-valued model]]. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.\n\n== Suszko's thesis ==\nIn order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shramko|first1=Y.|last2=Wansing|first2=H.|title=''Truth Values'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2015|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/suszko-thesis.html}}</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\n===Future contingents===\n{{main|Problem of future contingents}}\nA famous example<ref name=\"Tomassi1999\"/> is the ''contingent sea battle'' case found in [[Aristotle]]'s work, ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', chapter 9:\n\n: Imagine P refers to the statement \"There will be a sea battle tomorrow.\"\n\nThe principle of bivalence here asserts:\n\n: Either it is true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or it is false that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.\n\nAristotle {{clarify|reason=replace with more specific words|text=hesitated|date=March 2016}} to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Chrysippus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.  The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the [[philosophy of time]] and the [[philosophy of logic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nOne of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];<ref name=\"Tomassi1999\"/> see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].\n\nIssues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that \"''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be.\" (Which is true if \"tomorrow\" eventually occurs.)\n\n===Vagueness===\nSuch puzzles as the [[Sorites paradox]] and the related [[continuum fallacy]] have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.  [[Fuzzy logic]] and some other [[multi-valued logic]]s have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:\n\n: This apple is red.<ref>Note the use of the (extremely) definite article: \"This\" as opposed to a more-vague \"The\". If \"The\" is used, it would have to be accompanied with a pointing-gesture to make it definitive. Ff ''Principia Mathematica'' (2nd edition), p. 91. Russell & Whitehead observe that this \" this \" indicates \"something given in sensation\" and as such it shall be considered \"elementary\".</ref>\n\nUpon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is motled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category \" red \" nor \" yellow \", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is \"50% red\". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:\n\n: This apple is red and it is not-red.\n\nIn other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.\n\nHowever, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P [[And (logic)|and]] not-P implies P [[Inclusive or|or]] not-P, since \"or\" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.\n\n'''Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases''': Kleene 1952<ref>Stephen C. Kleene 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', 6th Reprint 1971, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY, {{isbn|0-7294-2130-9}}.</ref> (§64, pp.&nbsp;332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances \"u\" = undecided. He lets \"t\" = \"true\", \"f\" = \"false\", \"u\" = \"undecided\" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:\n\n{{quote|We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.\n\nNow if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded \"third\" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. […] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).\n\nThe third \"truth value\"  u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table\".}}\n\nThe following are his \"strong tables\":<ref>\"Strong tables\" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though \" u \" may appear for the value of Q or R, \" t \" or \" f \" may, in those occasions, appear as a value in \" Q V R \", \" Q & R \" and \" Q → R \". \"Weak tables\" on the other hand, are \"regular\", meaning they have \" u \" appear in all cases when the value \" u \" is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are ''not'' the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that \" u \" can mean any or all of the following: \"undefined\", \"unknown (or value immaterial)\", \"value disregarded for the moment\", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude \" t \" and \" f \" (page 335).</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size:9pt\" align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"\n|style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" Height=\"9.6\" | ~Q\n|style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" width=\"15\" |\n|style=\"font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" |\n| width=\"5.4\" |\n|style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;font-weight:bold\" width=\"25.2\" | QVR\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" width=\"15\" | R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | t\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | f\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | u\n| width=\"6\" |\n|style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;font-weight:bold\" width=\"28.2\" | Q&R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" width=\"15\" | R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | t\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | f\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | u\n| width=\"5.4\" |\n|style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;font-weight:bold\" width=\"32.4\" | Q→R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" width=\"15\" | R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | t\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | f\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | u\n| width=\"4.2\" |\n|style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;font-weight:bold\" width=\"28.2\" | Q=R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" width=\"15\" | R\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | t\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | f\n|style=\"background-color:#CCFFFF;font-weight:bold\" width=\"15\" | u\n|- style=\"font-size:9pt\" align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" Height=\"9.6\" | Q\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | t\n | f\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" | Q\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | t\n | t\n | t\n | t\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" | Q\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | t\n | t\n | f\n | u\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" | Q\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | t\n | t\n | f\n | u\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold;font-style:Italic\" | Q\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | t\n | t\n | f\n | u\n|- style=\"font-size:9pt\" align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"\n| Height=\"9.6\" |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | f\n | t\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | f\n | t\n | f\n | u\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | f\n | f\n | f\n | f\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | f\n | t\n | t\n | t\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | f\n | f\n | t\n | u\n|- style=\"font-size:9pt\" align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"\n| Height=\"9.6\" |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | u\n | u\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | u\n | t\n | u\n | u\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | u\n | u\n | f\n | u\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | u\n | t\n | u\n | u\n |\n |\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99;font-weight:bold\" | u\n | u\n | u\n | u\n|}\n\nFor example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: \" This apple is red \" is \" u \".

It is rarely a term that is used in other sports.\n\nIn [[United States|American]] team sports, the term is usually avoided in official circles, because the team losing in the final round of the postseason playoffs will have had to have won the championship of a lesser entity as a condition for reaching the finals; in [[basketball]], American [[American football|football]] and Ice [[ice hockey|hockey]] this would have been a conference championship, and in [[baseball]] a league championship, or colloquially, the league \"[[pennant (sports)|pennant]]\".  Consequently, the losing finalist will typically be referred to as the champion of its conference (or league in the case of baseball) rather than as a runner-up. Although the team that won the finals will also be a conference (or league in baseball) champion by necessity, it is usually not referred to as such because the title of \"finals champion\" carries more prestige.\n\nIn the [[Olympic Games]], runners-up receive silver medals, and in competitions held at county and state fairs in the [[United States]], a [[red ribbon (award)|red ribbon]] traditionally identifies the runner-up (with a [[blue ribbon]] signifying the winner, and [[white ribbon|white]], [[yellow ribbon|yellow]], [[green ribbon|green]], [[orange ribbon|orange]], [[purple ribbon|purple]], and [[brown ribbon|brown]] being the colors associated with third through eighth places, in that order).\n\nIn [[politics]], runners-up only applies to single member electorates or parties using a [[first past the post]] voting systems, such as Great Britain, the United States of America, or Canada.

It was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=McBee |first1=David Barnett, David Groth, Jim |title=Cabling : the complete guide to network wiring |date=2004 |publisher=SYBEX |location=San Francisco |isbn=9780782143317 |page=11 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AKDSTYu3nl4C&pg=PA11}}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\nIn a [[balanced line]], the two wires carry equal and opposite signals, and the destination detects the difference between the two. This is known as [[differential signaling]]. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a [[common-mode signal]] which can be canceled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken.\n\n[[Differential signaling]] starts to fail when the noise source is close to the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more strongly and the receiver will be unable to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged. Provided the interfering source remains uniform, or nearly so, over the distance of a single twist, the induced noise will remain common-mode.\n\nThe twist rate (also called ''pitch'' of the twist, usually defined in twists per [[meter]]) makes up part of the specification for a given type of cable. When nearby pairs have equal twist rates, the same conductors of the different pairs may repeatedly lie next to each other, partially undoing the benefits of differential mode. For this reason it is commonly specified that, at least for cables containing small numbers of pairs, the twist rates must differ.<ref name=\"dmray\">{{cite web|title=Crosstalk dependence on number of turns/inch for twisted pair versions of the end-cap umbilical cable|url=http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~dmray/pdffiles/TP_umbilical_studies.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to shielded or foiled twisted pair (typically F/UTP or S/FTP [[#Cable shielding|cable shielding]]), UTP (unshielded twisted pair) cable is not surrounded by any shielding. UTP is the primary wire type for [[telephone]] usage and is very common for [[computer networking]].<!--Kvng RTH-->\n\n==History==\n[[File:Wire Transposition.svg|thumb|Wire transposition on top of pole]]\n\nThe earliest telephones used telegraph lines, or open-wire [[single-wire earth return]] circuits. In the 1880s electric [[tram]]s were installed in many cities, which induced noise into these circuits. [[Lawsuit]]s being unavailing, the telephone companies converted to [[balanced circuit]]s, which had the incidental benefit of reducing [[attenuation]], hence increasing range.\n\nAs electrical power distribution became more commonplace, this measure proved inadequate. Two wires, strung on either side of cross bars on [[utility pole]]s, shared the route with electrical [[power line]]s. Within a few years, the growing use of electricity again brought an increase of interference, so engineers devised a method called [[Transposition (telecommunications)|wire transposition]], to cancel out the interference.\n\nIn wire transposition, the wires exchange position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] from power lines. This represented an early implementation of twisting, with a twist rate of about four twists per [[kilometre]], or six per [[mile]]. Such open-wire balanced lines with periodic transpositions still survive today in some rural areas.\n\nTwisted-pair cabling was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1881.<ref>\n{{cite patent\n | inventor1-last = Bell\n | inventor1-first = Alexander Graham\n | title = Telephone-circuit\n | issue-date = 1881\n | patent-number = 244426\n | country-code = US\n}}. See also TIFF format scans for [http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00244426&idkey=NONE USPTO 00244426]\n</ref> By 1900, the entire American [[telephone line]] network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference. Today, most of the millions of kilometres of twisted pairs in the world are [[outside plant|outdoor landlines]], owned by telephone companies, used for voice service, and only handled or even seen by telephone workers.\n\n==Unshielded twisted pair==\n[[File:UTP-cable.svg|thumb|Cross-section of cable with four unshielded twisted pairs]]\n\n'''Unshielded twisted pair''' (UTP) cables are found in many [[Ethernet]] networks and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard [[25-pair color code]] originally developed by [[AT&T Corporation]]. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with [[copper]] wires measured at 22 or 24 [[American Wire Gauge]] (AWG),<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven T. Karris|title=Networks: Design and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWMDf4ciB1AC&pg=SA6-PA2|year=2009|publisher=Orchard Publications|isbn=978-1-934404-15-7|page=6}}</ref> with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as [[polyethylene]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]] and the total package covered in a [[polyethylene]] jacket.\n\nFor urban outdoor telephone cables containing hundreds or thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into small but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of [[crosstalk]]. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable.\n\n[[File:UTP cable.jpg|thumb|Unshielded twisted pair cable with different twist rates]]\nUTP [[electrical cable|cable]] is also the most common cable used in [[computer networking]]. Modern [[Ethernet]], the most common data networking standard, can use UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to [[optical fiber]] and [[coaxial cable]].\n\nUTP is also finding increasing use in [[video]] applications, primarily in [[security camera]]s. Many cameras include a UTP output with [[screw terminal]]s; UTP cable [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] has improved to match the [[baseband]] of [[television]] signals. As UTP is a balanced transmission line, a [[balun]] is needed to connect to unbalanced equipment, for example any using [[BNC connector]]s and designed for coaxial cable.\n\n==Cable shielding==\n{{Main|Electromagnetic shielding}}\n[[File:FTP cable3.jpg|thumb|F/UTP cable]]\n[[File:S-FTP CAT 7.jpg|thumb|S/FTP cable]]\n[[File:10G BASE-T x 3 cables.svg|thumb|U/FTP, F/UTP and F/FTP are used in Cat 6a cables]]\n\nTwisted pair cables often incorporate shielding in an attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Shielding provides an electrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield; and provides a conduction path by which induced currents can be circulated and returned to the source via ground reference connection.\n\nSuch shielding can be applied to individual pairs or quads; or to a collection of pairs. Individual pairs are foil shielded, while an overall cable (of multiple pairs) may use any of braided screen or foil or braiding with foil.\n\nWhen shielding is applied to a collection of pairs, it is usually referred to as screening, but usage among vendors and authors in applying such words as ''screening'', ''shielding'', and ''STP (shielded twisted pair)'' can be subject to variability.<ref name=\"anitech\">[http://www.anitech-systems.com/MP4000/manual/briefs/ICM-4020E_Hub_Switch_Route_Cable_BR120501.pdf Anitech Systems MP 4000 Manual]</ref><ref name=\"siemon1\">[http://www.siemon.com/us/white_papers/06-07-20-grounding.asp Grounding for Screened and Shielded Network Cabling - Siemon]</ref>\n\n[[ISO/IEC 11801]]:2002 (Annex E) attempts to internationally standardize the various designations for shielded cables by using combinations of three letters - U for unshielded, S for braided shielding (in outer layer only), and F for foil shielding - to explicitly indicate the type of screen for overall cable protection and for protecting individual pairs or quads, using a two-part abbreviation in the form of ''x/xTP''.\n\nShielded Cat 5e, Cat 6/6<sub>A</sub>, and Cat 8/8.1 cables typically have F/UTP construction, while shielded Cat 7/7<sub>A</sub> and Cat 8.2 cables use S/FTP construction.<ref name=maguire>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bq/public/jul15/maguire_25gbt_01_0715.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-25|date=2015-07-12 |title=Size of the Category 7A Installed Base|last=Valerie |first=Maguire}}</ref>\n\nBecause the shielding is made of metal, it may also serve as a path to ground; usually a screen shielded, twisted pair cable has an integrally incorporated, grounding wire, called a ''drain wire'', which makes electrical contact with the shield or screen. The purpose of the drain wire is for easy connection of the screen to terminals, which are usually designed for connection of round wires.\n\nCommon shield construction types include:\n; Individual shield (U/FTP): Individual shielding with aluminum foil for each twisted pair or quad. Common names: pair in metal foil, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding protects cable from external EMI entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.\n\n; Overall shield (F/UTP, S/UTP, and SF/UTP): Overall foil, braided shield or braiding with foil across all of the pairs within the 100&nbsp;ohm twisted pair cable. Common names: foiled twisted pair, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable.\n\n; Individual and overall shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual shielding using foil between the twisted pair sets, and also an outer foil or braided shielding. Common names: fully shielded twisted pair, screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened shielded twisted pair, shielded screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.\n\nAn early example of shielded twisted-pair was IBM STP-A, which is a two-pair 150&nbsp;ohm S/FTP cable defined in 1985 by the IBM Cabling System specifications, and used with [[token ring]] or [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI networks]].<ref name=\"anitech\" /><ref>http://www.techfest.com/networking/cabling/ibmcs.htm</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Common industry nomenclature for cable construction types\n|-\n!

Standards were set at a national level.  For instance, in the UK the [[General Post Office]] specified CW1293 and CW1308 cables.  CW1308 was a similar specification to the earlier CW1293 but with an improved color code.  CW1293 used mostly solid colors on the cores making it difficult to identify the pair  it was twisted with without stripping back a large amount of sheath.  CW1308 has narrow rings of the paired color printed over the base color  to solve this problem.  Both cables are a similar standard to category 3 cable.<ref>{{multiref|Stephen Roberts, ''Telephone Installation Handbook'', pp. 32-34, Elsevier, 2001 {{ISBN|0080521487}}.|Barry J.

The overall sheath of this type of cable was usually lead.  This style of cable came into use in the late 19th century shortly after the invention of the telephone.<ref>''Telephony'', vol. 153, p. 118, Telephone Publishing Corporation 1957.</ref>  The cable termination in termination boxes were sealed with molten wax or epoxy resin to prevent the ingress of moisture which would seriously degrade the insulating properties of the paper insulation.<ref>''Paper Maker and British Paper Trade Journal'', vol. 83-84, p. 294, November 1, 1932 {{oclc|10634178}}</ref>  However, such seals made future maintenance and changes more difficult.  These cables are no longer made, but are still occasionally encountered in old buildings and in various external areas, commonly rural villages.\n\n===Building infrastructure===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The added inductors are known as [[load coil]]s and reduce attenuation for [[voiceband]] frequencies but increase it on higher frequencies. Load coils reduce distortion in voiceband on very long lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk801/tk36/technologies_tech_note09186a00800a8663.shtml|website=Cisco.com|title=Understanding Line Impairments|accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> In this context a line without load coils is referred to as an unloaded line.\n\n===Bonded===\nA bonded twisted pair is a construction variant in which the two wires of each pair are bonded together for the length of the cable. Pioneered by [[Belden (electronics company)|Belden]], it is intended to help assure configuration consistency during and after installation.  One key benefit is that the noise immunity performance of the cable can be protected despite potentially rough handling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contractor Field-Testing Survey Reveals Performance-Related Cost Savings Using Bonded-Pair Cables|url=http://www.belden.com/docs/upload/TB67.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref> This may not be necessary and it could have detrimental effects in applications which require flexible cable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonded Pair Cable |publisher=Turck |url=https://www.turck.us/static/media/downloads/WP_Bonded_Pair_Cable.pdf |access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Twisted ribbon cable===\n[[File:Scsi intern hd68 lvd term.jpg|thumb|Twisted ribbon cable used for [[SCSI]] connections]]\n\nA twisted ribbon cable is a variant of standard [[ribbon cable]] in which adjacent pairs of conductors are bonded and twisted together. The twisted pairs are then lightly bonded to each other in a ribbon format. Periodically along the ribbon there are short sections with no twisting to enable connectors and [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] headers to be terminated using the usual ribbon cable [[insulation-displacement connector|IDC]] techniques.<ref>{{cite web|title=3M Twisted Pair Flat Cable|url=http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/22068O/3mtm-twisted-pair-flat-cable-050-28awg-1700-series-ts0115.pdf|publisher=3M|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Solid-core vs. stranded cable===\nA solid-core cable uses one solid wire per conductor and in a four pair cable there would be a total of eight solid wires.<ref name=\"dcuse\">{{cite web|title=Comparison between CAT5, CAT5e, CAT6, CAT7 Cables|url=http://discountcablesusa.com/ethernet-cables100.html}}</ref> Stranded conductor uses multiple wires wrapped around each other in each conductor and in a four pair with seven strands per conductor cable, there would be a total of 56 wires (2 per pair × 4 pairs × 7 strands).<ref name=\"dcuse\" />\n\nSolid core cable is intended for permanently installed runs. It is less flexible than stranded cable and is more prone to failure if repeatedly flexed. Stranded cable is used for fly leads at patch panel and for connections from wall-ports to end devices, as it resists cracking of the conductors.\n\nConnectors are designed differently for solid core than for stranded. Use of a connector with the wrong cable type can lead to unreliable cabling. Plugs designed for solid and stranded core are readily available, and some vendors even offer plugs designed for use with both types. The punch-down blocks on patch-panel and wall-port jacks are designed for use with solid core cable, these work via a method known as insulation-displacement which pierces the sides of the insulation and \"bites\" in to the copper conductor to form a connection.\n\n==Advantages==\n* Electrical noise going into or coming from the cable can be prevented.<ref name=\"cirris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cirris.com/testing/twisted_pair/twist.html|title=Twisted Pair Testing}}</ref>\n* [[Crosstalk]] is minimized.<ref name=\"cirris\" />\n* Cheapest form of cable available for networking purposes.<ref name=\"cirris\"/>\n* Easy to handle and install.<ref name=\"cirris\"/>\n\n==Disadvantages==\n* Deformation: twisted pair's susceptibility to electromagnetic interference greatly depends on the pair twisting schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation. As a result, twisted pair cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius. This fragility of twisted pair cables makes the installation practices an important part of ensuring the cable's performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Impact of Installation Stresses On Cable Performance|url=http://www.belden.com/docs/upload/TB66.pdf|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref>\n* Delay skew: different pairs within the cable have different delays, due to different twist rates used to minimize crosstalk between the pairs.  This can degrade image quality when multiple pairs are used to carry components of a video signal. Low skew cable is available to mitigate this problem.<ref>{{cite web|title= 7987R Technical Data Sheet (Metric)|url=http://www.belden.com/techdatas/metric/7987R.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= 7989R Technical Data Sheet (Metric)|url=http://www.belden.com/techdatas/metric/7989R.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref>\n* Imbalance: differences between the two wires in a pair can cause coupling between the common mode and the differential mode.  Differential to common mode conversion produces common mode currents that can cause external interference and can produce common mode signals in other pairs.  Common mode to differential mode conversion can produce differential mode signals from common mode interference from other pairs or external sources.  Imbalance can be caused by asymmetry between the two conductors of the pair from each other and in relationship to other wires and the shield.  Some sources of asymmetry are differences in conductor diameter and insulation thickness.  In telephone jargon, the common mode is called ''longitudinal'' and the differential mode is called ''metallic''.<ref name=\"Reeve\">{{cite book| last=Reeve | first=Whitman D. | year= 1995|title=Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook - Digital |edition=1st |publisher= IEEE Press | isbn= 0-7803-0440-3 | pp=215–220}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ethernet over twisted pair]]\n* [[Balanced line]]\n* [[Copper wire and cable]]\n* [[Litz wire]]\n* [[Registered jack]]\n* [[Star quad cable]] increases cancellation of interference\n* [[TIA/EIA-568-B]]\n* [[Tip and ring]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Twisted-pair cables}}\n* [http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/sciencePhonesWork.shtml Telecommunications Virtual Museum]\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{UTP Cable Standards}}\n\n[[Category:Communication circuits]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetic compatibility]]\n[[Category:Signal cables]]\n[[Category:Video hardware]]\n[[Category:2 (number)]]"

In [[mathematics]], it is commonly represented by the symbol {{math|ℝ<sup>2</sup>}}. For a generalization of the concept, see [[dimension]].\n\nTwo-dimensional space can be seen as a projection of the physical [[universe]] onto a [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. Usually, it is thought of as a [[Euclidean space]] and the two dimensions are called length and width.\n\n==History==\nBooks I through IV and VI of [[Euclid's Elements]] dealt with two-dimensional geometry, developing such notions as similarity of shapes, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (Proposition 47), equality of angles and [[area]]s, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are \"equal\" (have the same area), among many other topics.\n\nLater, the plane was described in a so-called ''[[Cartesian coordinate system]]'', a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] ''coordinates'', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances from the point to two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, measured in the same [[unit length|unit of length]]. Each reference line is called a ''coordinate axis'' or just ''axis'' of the system, and the point where they meet is its ''[[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]'', usually at ordered pair (0,&#8239;0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the [[orthogonal projection|perpendicular projections]] of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.\n\nThe idea of this system was developed in 1637 in writings by Descartes and independently by [[Pierre de Fermat]], although Fermat also worked in three dimensions, and did not publish the discovery.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Analytic geometry|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2008|edition=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}</ref> Both authors used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' ''[[La Géométrie]]'' was translated into Latin in 1649 by [[Frans van Schooten]] and his students. These commentators  introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes' work.<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|2011|loc=p. 374}}</ref>\n\nLater, the plane was thought of as a [[field (mathematics)|field]], where any two points could be multiplied and, except for 0, divided. This was known as the [[complex plane]]. The complex plane is sometimes called the Argand plane because it is used in Argand diagrams. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Danish-Norwegian land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).<ref>Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806.

Two perpendicular [[coordinate axis|coordinate axes]] are given which cross each other at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].  They are usually labeled ''x'' and ''y''. Relative to these axes, the position of any point in two-dimensional space is given by an ordered pair of real numbers, each number giving the distance of that point from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] measured along the given axis, which is equal to the distance of that point from the other axis.\n\nAnother widely used coordinate system is the [[polar coordinate system]], which specifies a point in terms of its distance from the origin and its angle relative to a rightward reference ray.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Coord XY.svg|[[Cartesian coordinate system]]\nImage:Coord Circular.svg|[[Polar coordinate system]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Polytopes===\n{{main article|Polygon}}\nIn two dimensions, there are infinitely many polytopes: the polygons.

The mathematician [[Archimedes]] used the tools of [[Euclidean geometry]] to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a [[right triangle]] whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]''. (The circumference is 2{{pi}}''r'', and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area {{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with [[Area of a disk#Archimedes' doubling method|his doubling method]], in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular [[hexagon]], then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with [[circumscribed polygon]]s).\n\nSwiss scientist [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in 1761 proved that [[pi|π]], the ratio of a circle's area to its squared radius, is [[irrational number|irrational]], meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers.<ref name=Arndt>{{cite book| last=Arndt |first=Jörg |last2=Haene l|first2=Christoph |title=Pi Unleashed| publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2006| isbn=978-3-540-66572-4 <!--isbn only volume 1--> |url= https://books.google.com/?id=QwwcmweJCDQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref=harv |accessdate=2013-06-05}} English translation by Catriona and David Lischka.</ref> In 1794 French mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] proved that π<sup>2</sup> is irrational; this also proves that π is irrational.<ref>{{citation|first=Howard|last=Eves|title=An Introduction to the History of Mathematics|edition=6th|year=1990|publisher=Saunders|isbn=978-0-03-029558-4|page=121}}</ref> In 1882, German mathematician [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] proved that π is [[transcendental number|transcendental]] (not the solution of any [[polynomial equation]] with rational coefficients), confirming a conjecture made by both [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and Euler.<ref name=Arndt/>{{rp|p. 196}}\n\n===Triangle area===\n\n[[Hero of Alexandria|Heron (or Hero) of Alexandria]] found what is known as [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides, and a proof can be found in his book, ''Metrica'', written around 60 CE.

Given a circle of radius {{math|''r''}}, it is possible to partition the circle into [[Circular sector|sectors]], as shown in the figure to the right.  Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form an approximate parallelogram.  The height of this parallelogram is {{math|''r''}}, and the width is half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or {{math|π''r''}}.  Thus, the total area of the circle is {{math|π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}:<ref name=AF/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} π''r''<sup>2</sup>}} &nbsp;(circle).\nThough the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors.  The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly {{math|π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}, which is the area of the circle.<ref name=Surveyor/>\n\nThis argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of [[calculus]].  In ancient times, the [[method of exhaustion]] was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to [[integral calculus]].  Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a [[definite integral]]:\n:<math>A \\;=\\;2\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx \\;=\\; \\pi r^2.</math>\n\n====Ellipses====\n{{main article|Ellipse#Area}}\nThe formula for the area enclosed by an [[ellipse]] is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with [[semi-major axis|semi-major]] and [[semi-minor axis|semi-minor]] axes {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} the formula is:<ref name=AF/>\n:<math>A = \\pi xy .</math>\n\n====Surface area====\n{{main article|Surface area}}\n[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|right|thumb|alt=A blue sphere inside a cylinder of the same height and radius|[[Archimedes]] showed that the surface area of a [[sphere]] is exactly four times the area of a flat [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of the same radius, and the volume enclosed by the sphere is exactly 2/3 of the volume of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and radius.]]\nMost basic formulas for [[surface area]] can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out.  For example, if the side surface of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (or any [[prism (geometry)|prism]]) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle.  Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]], the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle, and the resulting area computed.\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a [[sphere]] is more difficult to derive: because a sphere has nonzero [[Gaussian curvature]], it cannot be flattened out.  The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.  The formula is:<ref name=MathWorldSurfaceArea/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} 4''πr''<sup>2</sup>}} &nbsp;(sphere), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.  As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to [[calculus]].\n\n===General formulas===\n\n====Areas of 2-dimensional figures====\n* A [[triangle]]: <math>\\tfrac12Bh</math> (where ''B'' is any side, and ''h'' is the distance from the line on which ''B'' lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height ''h'' is known. If the lengths of the three sides are known then ''[[Heron's formula]]'' can be used: <math>\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}</math> where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sides of the triangle, and <math>s = \\tfrac12(a + b + c)</math> is half of its perimeter.<ref name=AF/> If an angle and its two included sides are given, the area is <math>\\tfrac12 a b \\sin(C)</math> where {{math|''C''}} is the given angle and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are its included sides.<ref name=AF/> If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of <math>\\tfrac12(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3)</math>. This formula is also known as the [[shoelace formula]] and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points ''(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)'', ''(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)'', and ''(x<sub>3</sub>,y<sub>3</sub>)''. The shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known. Another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use [[calculus]] to find the area.\n* A [[simple polygon]] constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with [[integer]] coordinates) such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points: <math>i + \\frac{b}{2} - 1</math>, where ''i'' is the number of grid points inside the polygon and ''b'' is the number of boundary points.

perimeter===\n\nThe [[isoperimetric inequality]] states that, for a closed curve of length ''L'' (so the region it encloses has [[perimeter]] ''L'') and for area ''A'' of the region that it encloses,\n\n:<math>4\\pi A \\le L^2,</math>\n\nand  equality holds if and only if the curve is a [[circle]]. Thus a circle has the largest area of any closed figure with a given perimeter.\n\nAt the other extreme, a figure with given perimeter ''L'' could have an arbitrarily small area, as illustrated by a [[rhombus]] that is \"tipped over\" arbitrarily far so that two of its [[angle]]s are arbitrarily close to 0° and the other two are arbitrarily close to 180°.\n\nFor a circle, the ratio of the area to the [[circumference]] (the term for the perimeter of a circle) equals half the [[radius]] ''r''. This can be seen from the area formula ''πr''<sup>2</sup> and the circumference formula 2''πr''.\n\nThe area of a [[regular polygon]] is half its perimeter times the [[apothem]] (where the apothem is the distance from the center to the nearest point on any side).\n\n===Fractals===\n\nDoubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). But if the one-dimensional lengths of a  [[fractal]] drawn in two dimensions are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power of two that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal.\n<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\">\n{{cite book\n |last        = Mandelbrot\n |first       = Benoît B.\n |title       = The fractal geometry of nature <!--Isn't valid anymore: https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC-->\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |accessdate  = 1 February 2012\n |year        = 1983\n |publisher   = Macmillan\n |isbn        = 978-0-7167-1186-5\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170320115652/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |archivedate = 20 March 2017\n |df          =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Area bisectors==\n{{Main article|Bisection#Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors}}\n\nThere are an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle.

Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its [[incircle]]). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.\n\nAny line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area.\n\nAll area bisectors of a circle or other ellipse go through the center, and any [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] through the center bisect the area. In the case of a circle they are the diameters of the circle.\n\n==Optimization==\nGiven a wire contour, the surface of least area spanning (\"filling\") it is a [[minimal surface]].

Prior to Archimedes, [[Hippocrates of Chios]] was the first to show that the area of a disk is proportional to the square of its diameter, as part of his quadrature of the [[lune of Hippocrates]],<ref name=\"heath\">{{citation|first=Thomas L.|last=Heath|authorlink=Thomas Little Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2003|isbn=0-486-43231-9|pages=121–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HZNr_mGFzQC&pg=PA121}}.</ref> but did not identify the [[constant of proportionality]].\n\n==Historical arguments==\nA variety of arguments have been advanced historically to establish the equation <math>A=\\pi r^2</math> to varying degrees of mathematical rigor.  The most famous of these is Archimedes' [[method of exhaustion]], one of the earliest uses of the mathematical concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], as well as the origin of [[Archimedean property|Archimedes' axiom]] which remains part of the standard analytical treatment of the [[real number system]].  The original proof of Archimedes is not rigorous by modern standards, because it assumes that we can compare the length of arc of a circle to the length of a secant and a tangent line, and similar statements about the area, as geometrically evident.\n\n===Using polygons===\nThe area of a [[regular polygon]] is half its perimeter times the [[apothem]].  As the number of sides of the regular polygon increases, the polygon tends to a circle, and the apothem tends to the radius.  This suggests that the area of a disk is half the circumference of its bounding circle times the radius.<ref>Hill, George.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zSMAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA124 Lessons in Geometry: For the Use of Beginners]'', page 124 (1894).</ref>\n\n===Archimedes's proof===\nFollowing Archimedes' argument in ''The Measurement of a Circle'' (c. 260 BCE), compare the area enclosed by a circle to a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius. If the area of the circle is not equal to that of the triangle, then it must be either greater or less. We eliminate each of these by contradiction, leaving equality as the only possibility. We use [[regular polygon]]s in the same way.\n\n====Not greater====\n[[File:Archimedes circle area proof - inscribed polygons.svg|thumb|right|Circle with square and octagon inscribed, showing area gap]]\nSuppose that the area ''C'' enclosed by the circle is greater than the area ''T''&nbsp;= <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>''cr'' of the triangle.  Let ''E'' denote the excess amount. [[Inscribe]] a square in the circle, so that its four corners lie on the circle. Between the square and the circle are four segments. If the total area of those gaps, ''G''<sub>4</sub>, is greater than ''E'', split each arc in half. This makes the inscribed square into an inscribed octagon, and produces eight segments with a smaller total gap, ''G''<sub>8</sub>. Continue splitting until the total gap area, ''G<sub>n</sub>'', is less than ''E''. Now the area of the inscribed polygon, ''P<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;= ''C''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''G<sub>n</sub>'', must be greater than that of the triangle.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n E &{}= C - T \\\\\n   &{}> G_n \\\\\n P_n &{}= C - G_n \\\\\n     &{}> C - E \\\\\n P_n &{}> T\n\\end{align}</math>\nBut this forces a contradiction, as follows. Draw a perpendicular from the center to the midpoint of a side of the polygon; its length, ''h'', is less than the circle radius. Also, let each side of the polygon have length ''s''; then the sum of the sides, ''ns'', is less than the circle circumference. The polygon area consists of ''n'' equal triangles with height ''h'' and base ''s'', thus equals <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>''nhs''. But since ''h''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''r'' and ''ns''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''c'', the polygon area must be less than the triangle area, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>''cr'', a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition that ''C'' might be greater than ''T'' must be wrong.\n\n====Not less====\n[[File:Archimedes circle area proof - circumscribed polygons.svg|thumb|right|Circle with square and octagon circumscribed, showing area gap]]\nSuppose that the area enclosed by the circle is less than the area ''T'' of the triangle.  Let ''D'' denote the deficit amount. Circumscribe a square, so that the midpoint of each edge lies on the circle. If the total area gap between the square and the circle, ''G''<sub>4</sub>, is greater than ''D'', slice off the corners with circle tangents to make a circumscribed octagon, and continue slicing until the gap area is less than ''D''. The area of the polygon, ''P<sub>n</sub>'', must be less than ''T''.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D &{}= T - C \\\\\n   &{}> G_n \\\\\n P_n &{}= C + G_n \\\\\n     &{}< C + D \\\\\n P_n &{}< T\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis, too, forces a contradiction. For, a perpendicular to the midpoint of each polygon side is a radius, of length ''r''. And since the total side length is greater than the circumference, the polygon consists of ''n'' identical triangles with total area greater than ''T''. Again we have a contradiction, so our supposition that ''C'' might be less than ''T'' must be wrong as well.\n\nTherefore, it must be the case that the area enclosed by the circle is precisely the same as the area of the triangle. This concludes the proof.\n\n===Rearrangement proof===\n[[File:CircleArea.svg|thumb|right|Circle area by rearrangement]]\n{{regular_polygon_side_count_graph.svg}}\nFollowing Satō Moshun {{Harv|Smith|Mikami|1914|loc=pp.&nbsp;130–132}} and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] {{Harv|Beckmann|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;19}}, we can use inscribed regular polygons in a different way. Suppose we inscribe a [[hexagon]]. Cut the hexagon into six triangles by splitting it from the center. Two opposite triangles both touch two common diameters; slide them along one so the radial edges are adjacent. They now form a [[parallelogram]], with the hexagon sides making two opposite edges, one of which is the base, ''s''. Two radial edges form slanted sides, and the height, ''h'' is equal to its [[apothem]] (as in the Archimedes proof). In fact, we can assemble all the triangles into one big parallelogram by putting successive pairs next to each other. The same is true if we increase to eight sides and so on. For a polygon with 2''n'' sides, the parallelogram will have a base of length ''ns'', and a height ''h''. As the number of sides increases, the length of the parallelogram base approaches half the circle circumference, and its height approaches the circle radius. In the limit, the parallelogram becomes a rectangle with width {{pi}}''r'' and height ''r''.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" frame=\"vsides\" style=\"text-align:center\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|+ '''''Unit disk area by rearranging n polygons.'''''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | polygon\n| rowspan=\"11\" style=\"padding:1px;\"|\n! colspan=\"3\" | parallelogram\n|-\n!

The conventional definition in pre-calculus geometry is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter:\n:<math>\\pi=\\frac{C}{D}.</math>\nHowever, because the circumference of a circle is not a primitive analytical concept, this definition is not suitable in modern rigorous treatments.  A standard modern definition is that {{pi}} is equal to twice the least positive root of the [[cosine]] function or, equivalently, the half-period of the [[sine]] (or cosine) function.  The cosine function can be defined either as a [[power series]], or as the solution of a certain [[differential equation]].  This avoids any reference to circles in the definition of {{pi}}, so that statements about the relation of {{pi}} to the circumference and area of circles are actually theorems, rather than definitions, that follow from the analytical definitions of concepts like \"area\" and \"circumference\".\n\nThe analytical definitions are seen to be equivalent, if it is agreed that the circumference of the circle is measured as a [[rectifiable curve]] by means of the [[integral]]\n:<math>C = 2\\int_{-R}^R \\frac{R\\,dx}{\\sqrt{R^2-x^2}} = 2R\\int_{-1}^1\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}.</math>\nThe integral appearing on the right is an [[abelian integral]] whose value is a half-period of the [[sine]] function, equal to {{pi}}.  Thus <math>C=2\\pi R=\\pi D</math> is seen to be true as a theorem.\n\nSeveral of the arguments that follow use only concepts from elementary calculus to reproduce the formula <math>A=\\pi r^2</math>, but in many cases to regard these as actual proofs, they rely implicitly on the fact that one can develop trigonometric functions and the fundamental constant {{pi}} in a way that is totally independent of their relation to geometry.  We have indicated where appropriate how each of these proofs can be made totally independent of all trigonometry, but in some cases that requires more sophisticated mathematical ideas than those afforded by elementary calculus.\n\n===Onion proof===\n[[File:Circle area rings.svg|thumb|right|Area of the disk via ring integration]]\nUsing calculus, we can sum the area incrementally, partitioning the disk into thin concentric rings like the layers of an [[onion]]. This is the method of [[shell integration]] in two dimensions. For an infinitesimally thin ring of the \"onion\" of radius ''t'', the accumulated area is 2{{pi}}''t dt'', the circumferential length of the ring times its infinitesimal width (one can approximate this ring by a rectangle with width=2{{pi}}''t'' and height=''dt''). This gives an elementary integral for a disk of radius ''r''.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{Area}(r) &{}= \\int_0^{r} 2 \\pi t \\, dt \\\\\n                  &{}= 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{t^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{r}\\\\\n                  &{}= \\pi r^2.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nIt is rigorously justified by the [[Integration by substitution#Substitution for multiple variables|multivariate substitution rule]] in polar coordinates. Namely, the area is given by a [[double integral]] of the constant function 1 over the disk itself. If ''D'' denotes the disk, then the double integral can be computed in [[polar coordinates]] as follows:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{Area}(r) &{}= \\iint_D 1\\ d(x, y)\\\\\n &{} = \\iint_D t\\ dt\\ d\\theta\\\\\n &{} = \\int_0^r \\int_0^{2\\pi}  t\\ d\\theta\\ dt\\\\\n &{} = \\int_0^r \\left[ t\\theta \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} dt\\\\\n &{}= \\int_0^{r} 2 \\pi t \\, dt \\\\\n \\end{align}</math>\nwhich is the same result as obtained above.\n\nAn equivalent rigorous justification, without relying on the special coordinates of trigonometry, uses the [[coarea formula]].  Define a function <math>\\rho:\\mathbb R^2\\to\\mathbb R</math> by <math>\\rho(x,y)=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math>. Note &rho; is a [[Lipschitz function]] whose [[gradient]] is a unit vector <math>|\\nabla\\rho|=1</math> ([[almost everywhere]]).  Let ''D'' be the disc <math>\\rho<1</math> in <math>\\mathbb R^2</math>.  We will show that <math>\\mathcal L^2(D)=\\pi</math>, where <math>\\mathcal L^2</math> is the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure in <math>\\mathbb R^2</math>.  We shall assume that the one-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] of the circle <math>\\rho=r</math> is <math>2\\pi r</math>, the circumference of the circle of radius ''r''.  (This can be taken as the definition of circumference.)  Then, by the coarea formula, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\\mathcal L^2(D) &= \\iint_D |\\nabla \\rho|\\,d\\mathcal{L}^2\\\\\n&= \\int_{\\mathbb R} \\mathcal H^1(\\rho^{-1}(r)\\cap D)\\,dr\\\\ \n&= \\int_0^1\\mathcal H^1(\\rho^{-1}(r))\\,dr \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 2\\pi r\\, dr= \\pi.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Triangle proof===\n[[File:TriangleFromCircle.gif|thumb|right|Circle unwrapped to form a triangle]]\n[[File:Area of circle and triangle.svg|thumb|The circle and the triangle are equal in area.]]\n\nSimilar to the onion proof outlined above, we could exploit calculus in a different way in order to arrive at the formula for the area of a disk. Consider unwrapping the concentric circles to straight strips. This will form a right angled triangle with r as its height and 2{{pi}}r (being the outer slice of onion) as its base.\n\nFinding the area of this triangle will give the area of the disk\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area} &{}= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height} \\\\\n      &{}= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\pi r \\cdot r \\\\\n      &{}= \\pi r^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe opposite and adjacent angles for this triangle are respectively in degrees 9.0430611..., 80.956939... and in radians 0.1578311... {{OEIS2C|A233527}}, 1.4129651...{{OEIS2C|A233528}}.\n\nExplicitly, we imagine dividing up a circle into triangles, each with a height equal to the circle's radius and a base that is infinitesimally small. The area of each of these triangles is equal to <math>1/2\\cdot r \\cdot du</math>. By summing up (integrating) all of the areas of these triangles, we arrive at the formula for the circle's area:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{Area}(r) &{}= \\int_0^{2\\pi r}  \\frac{1}{2} r \\, du \\\\\n                  &{}= \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} r u \\right]_{0}^{2 \\pi r}\\\\\n                  &{}= \\pi r^2.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nIt too can be justified by a double integral of the constant function 1 over the disk by reversing the [[order of integration (calculus)|order of integration]] and using a change of variables in the above iterated integral:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{Area}(r) &{}= \\iint_D 1\\ d(x, y)\\\\\n &{} = \\iint_D t\\ dt\\ d\\theta\\\\\n &{} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^r  t\\ dt\\ d\\theta\\\\\n &{} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2}r^2\\ d\\theta\\\\\n \\end{align}</math>\nMaking the substitution <math>u = r\\theta,\\ du=r\\ d\\theta</math> converts the integral to\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{2\\pi r} \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{r^2}{r} du = \\int_0^{2\\pi r} \\frac{1}{2} r\\ du \n \\end{align}\n</math>\nwhich is the same as the above result.\n\nThe triangle proof can be reformulated as an application of [[Green's theorem]] in flux-divergence form (i.e. a two-dimensional version of the [[divergence theorem]]), in a way that avoids all mention of trigonometry and the constant {{pi}}.  Consider the [[vector field]] <math>\\mathbf r=x\\mathbf i + y\\mathbf j</math> in the plane.  So the [[divergence]] of '''r''' is equal to two, and hence the area of a disc ''D'' is equal to\n:<math>A = \\frac12\\iint_D \\operatorname{div}\\mathbf r\\, dA.</math>\nBy Green's theorem, this is the same as the outward flux of '''r''' across the circle bounding ''D'':\n:<math>A = \\frac12\\oint_{\\partial D} \\mathbf r\\cdot\\mathbf n\\, ds</math>\nwhere '''n''' is the unit normal and ''ds'' is the arc length measure.  For a circle of radius ''R'' centered at the origin, we have <math>|\\mathbf r|=R</math> and <math>\\mathbf n=\\mathbf r/R</math>, so the above equality is\n:<math>A = \\frac12\\oint_{\\partial D} \\mathbf r\\cdot\\frac{\\mathbf r}{R}\\, ds = \\frac{R}{2}\\oint_{\\partial D} \\,ds.</math>\nThe integral of ''ds'' over the whole circle <math>\\partial D</math> is just the arc length, which is its circumference, so this shows that the area ''A'' enclosed by the circle is equal to <math>R/2</math> times the circumference of the circle.\n\n===Semicircle proof===\n\nNote that the area of a semicircle of radius r can be computed by the integral <math>\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx</math>.\n\n[[Image:semicircle.svg|frame|A semicircle of radius ''r'']]\n\nBy [[trigonometric substitution]], we substitute <math>x=r \\sin\\theta </math>, hence <math>dx=r\\cos \\theta\\, d\\theta.</math>\n::<math>\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx</math>\n\n:<math>=\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\sqrt{r^2(1-\\sin ^2 \\theta)} \\cdot r \\cos \\theta\\, d \\theta</math>\n\n:<math>=2r^2\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos ^2 \\theta\\, d \\theta </math>\n\n:<math>=\\frac{\\pi r^2}{2}.</math>\n\nThe last step follows since the trigonometric identity <math>\\cos(\\theta)=\\sin(\\pi/2-\\theta)</math> implies that <math>\\cos^2\\theta</math> and <math>\\sin^2\\theta</math> have equal integrals over the interval <math>[0,\\pi/2]</math>, using [[integration by substitution]].  But on the other hand, since <math>\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta=1</math>, the sum of the two integrals is the length of that interval, which is <math>\\pi/2</math>.  Consequently, the integral of <math>\\cos^2 \\theta</math> is equal to half the length of that interval, which is <math>\\pi/4</math>.\n\nTherefore, the area of a circle of radius ''r'', which is twice the area of the semi-circle, is equal to <math>2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2} = \\pi r^2</math>.\n\nThis particular proof may appear to beg the question, if the sine and cosine functions involved in the trigonometric substitution are regarded as being defined in relation to circles.  However, as noted earlier, it is possible to define sine, cosine, and {{pi}} in a way that is totally independent of trigonometry, in which case the proof is valid by the [[change of variables formula]] and [[Fubini's theorem]], assuming the basic properties of sine and cosine (which can also be proved without assuming anything about their relation to circles).\n\n==Isoperimetric inequality==\nThe circle is the closed curve of least perimeter that encloses the maximum area.  This is known as the [[isoperimetric inequality]], which states that if a rectifiable Jordan curve in the Euclidean plane has perimeter ''C'' and encloses an area ''A'' (by the [[Jordan curve theorem]]) then\n:<math>4\\pi A\\le C^2.</math>\nMoreover, equality holds in this inequality if and only if the curve is a circle, in which case <math>A=\\pi r^2</math> and <math>C=2\\pi r</math>.\n\n==Fast approximation==\nThe calculations Archimedes used to approximate the area numerically were laborious, and he stopped with a polygon of 96 sides. A faster method uses ideas of [[Willebrord Snell]] (''Cyclometricus''<!--: de circuli dimensione secundum logistarum abacos, &amp; ad mechanicem accuratissima; atque omnium parabilissima: eiusdemque usus in quarumlibet, adscriptarum inventione longe elegantissimus, &amp; quidem ex ratione diametri ad suam peripheriam data--><!--, Lugduni Batavorum: Elzevir-->, 1621), further developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] (''De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa'', 1654), described in {{Harvtxt|Gerretsen|Verdenduin|1983|loc=pp.&nbsp;243–250}}.\n\n===Archimedes' doubling method===\nGiven a circle, let ''u<sub>n</sub>'' be the [[perimeter]] of an inscribed regular ''n-''gon, and let ''U<sub>n</sub>'' be the perimeter of a circumscribed regular ''n-''gon.  Then ''u<sub>n</sub>'' and ''U<sub>n</sub>'' are lower and upper bounds for the circumference of the circle that become sharper and sharper as ''n'' increases, and their average (''u<sub>n</sub>'' + ''U<sub>n</sub>'')/2 is an especially good approximation to the circumference.  To compute ''u<sub>n</sub>'' and ''U<sub>n</sub>'' for large ''n'', Archimedes derived the following doubling formulae:\n\n:<math>u_{2n} = \\sqrt{U_{2n} u_{n}}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;([[geometric mean]]), and\n\n:<math>U_{2n} = \\frac{2 U_{n} u_{n}}{ U_{n} + u_{n}}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp; ([[harmonic mean]]).\n\nStarting from a hexagon, Archimedes doubled ''n'' four times to get a 96-gon, which gave him a good approximation to the circumference of the circle.\n\nIn modern notation, we can reproduce his computation (and go further) as follows.\nFor a unit circle, an inscribed hexagon has ''u''<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;= 6, and a circumscribed hexagon has ''U''<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;= 4{{radic|3}}.\nDoubling seven times yields\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" frame=\"vsides\" style=\"text-align:center\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|+ '''''Archimedes doubling seven times; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;6×2<sup>k</sup>.'''''\n|- style=\"background-color:#eeeeee\"\n!

Let A&prime; be the point opposite A on the circle, so that A&prime;A is a diameter, and A&prime;AB is an inscribed triangle on a diameter. By [[Thales' theorem]], this is a right triangle with right angle at B. Let the length of A&prime;B be ''c<sub>n</sub>'', which we call the complement of ''s<sub>n</sub>''; thus ''c<sub>n</sub>''<sup>2</sup>+''s<sub>n</sub>''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= (2''r'')<sup>2</sup>. Let C bisect the arc from A to B, and let C&prime; be the point opposite C on the circle. Thus the length of CA is ''s''<sub>2''n''</sub>, the length of C&prime;A is ''c''<sub>2''n''</sub>, and C&prime;CA is itself a right triangle on diameter C&prime;C. Because C bisects the arc from A to B, C&prime;C perpendicularly bisects the chord from A to B, say at P. Triangle C&prime;AP is thus a right triangle, and is [[similarity (geometry)#Similar triangles|similar]] to C&prime;CA since they share the angle at C&prime;. Thus all three corresponding sides are in the same proportion; in particular, we have C&prime;A&nbsp;:&nbsp;C&prime;C&nbsp;= C&prime;P&nbsp;:&nbsp;C&prime;A and AP&nbsp;:&nbsp;C&prime;A&nbsp;= CA&nbsp;:&nbsp;C&prime;C. The center of the circle, O, bisects A&prime;A, so we also have triangle OAP similar to A&prime;AB, with OP half the length of A&prime;B. In terms of side lengths, this gives us\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n c_{2n}^2 &{}= \\left( r + \\frac{1}{2} c_n \\right) 2r \\\\\n c_{2n} &{}= \\frac{s_n}{s_{2n}} .\n\\end{align}</math>\nIn the first equation C&prime;P is C&prime;O+OP, length ''r''+<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>''c<sub>n</sub>'', and C&prime;C is the diameter, 2''r''.

Call the circumscribed side ''S<sub>n</sub>''; then this is ''S<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''s<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>''c<sub>n</sub>''. (We have again used that OP is half the length of A&prime;B.) Thus we obtain\n:<math> c_n = 2\\frac{s_n}{S_n} . </math>\nCall the inscribed perimeter ''u<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;= ''ns<sub>n</sub>'', and the circumscribed perimenter ''U<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;= ''nS<sub>n</sub>''. Then combining equations, we have\n:<math> c_{2n} = \\frac{s_n}{s_{2n}} = 2 \\frac{s_{2n}}{S_{2n}} , </math>\nso that\n:<math> u_{2n}^2 = u_n U_{2n} . </math>\nThis gives a [[geometric mean]] equation.\n\nWe can also deduce\n:<math> 2 \\frac{s_{2n}}{S_{2n}} \\frac{s_n}{s_{2n}} = 2 + 2 \\frac{s_n}{S_n} , </math>\nor\n:<math> \\frac{2}{U_{2n}} = \\frac{1}{u_n} + \\frac{1}{U_n} . </math>\nThis gives a [[harmonic mean]] equation.\n\n==Dart approximation==\n[[File:Circle area Monte Carlo integration.svg|thumb|right|Unit circle area Monte Carlo integration. Estimate by these 900 samples is 4×{{sfrac|709|900}}&nbsp;= 3.15111...]]\nWhen more efficient methods of finding areas are not available, we can resort to “throwing darts”. This [[Monte Carlo method]] uses the fact that if random samples are taken uniformly scattered across the surface of a square in which a disk resides, the proportion of samples that hit the disk approximates the ratio of the area of the disk to the area of the square. This should be considered a method of last resort for computing the area of a disk (or any shape), as it requires an enormous number of samples to get useful accuracy; an estimate good to 10<sup>−''n''</sup> requires about 100<sup>''n''</sup> random samples {{Harv|Thijssen|2006|loc=p.&nbsp;273}}.\n\n==Finite rearrangement==\nWe have seen that by partitioning the disk into an infinite number of pieces we can reassemble the pieces into a rectangle. A remarkable fact discovered relatively recently {{Harv|Laczkovich|1990}} is that we can dissect the disk into a large but ''finite'' number of pieces and then reassemble the pieces into a square of equal area. This is called [[Tarski's circle-squaring problem]]. The nature of Laczkovich's proof is such that it proves the existence of such a partition (in fact, of many such partitions) but does not exhibit any particular partition.\n\n==Non-Euclidean circles==\nCircles can be defined in [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and in particular in the [[hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic]] and [[elliptic plane|elliptic]] planes.\n\nFor example, the [[unit sphere]] <math>S^2(1)</math> is a model for the two-dimensional elliptic plane.  It carries an [[intrinsic metric]] that arises by measuring [[geodesic]] length.  The geodesic circles are the parallels in a [[latitude|geodesic coordinate system]].\n\nMore precisely, fix a point <math>\\mathbf z\\in S^2(1)</math> that we place at the zenith.  Associated to that zenith is a geodesic polar coordinate system <math>(\\phi,\\theta)</math>, <math>0\\le\\phi\\le\\pi</math>, <math>0\\le\\theta< 2\\pi</math>, where '''z''' is the point <math>\\phi=0</math>.  In these coordinates, the geodesic distance from '''z''' to any other point <math>\\mathbf x\\in S^2(1)</math> having coordinates <math>(\\phi,\\theta)</math> is the value of <math>\\phi</math> at '''x'''.  A spherical circle is the set of points a geodesic distance ''R'' from the zenith point '''z'''.  Equivalently, with a fixed embedding into <math>\\mathbb R^3</math>, the spherical circle of radius <math>R\\le\\pi</math> centered at '''z''' is the set of '''x''' in <math>S^2(1)</math> such that <math>\\mathbf x\\cdot\\mathbf z = \\cos R</math>.\n\nWe can also measure the area of the spherical disk enclosed within a spherical circle, using the intrinsic surface area measure on the sphere.  The area of the disk of radius ''R'' is then given by\n:<math>A = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^R \\sin(\\phi)d\\phi\\,d\\theta = 2\\pi(1-\\cos R).</math>\n\nMore generally, if a sphere <math>S^2(\\rho)</math> has radius of curvature <math>\\rho</math>, then the area of the disk of radius ''R'' is given by\n:<math>A = 2\\pi\\rho^2(1-\\cos(R/\\rho)).</math>\nObserve that, as an application of [[L'Hôpital's rule]], this tends to the Euclidean area <math>\\pi R^2</math> in the flat limit <math>\\rho\\to\\infty</math>.\n\nThe hyperbolic case is similar, with the area of a disk of intrinsic radius ''R'' in the (constant curvature <math>-1</math>) hyperbolic plane given by\n:<math>A = 2\\pi(1-\\cosh R)</math>\nwhere cosh is the [[hyperbolic cosine]].  More generally, for the constant curvature <math>-k</math> hyperbolic plane, the answer is\n:<math>A = 2\\pi k^{-2}(1-\\cosh(kR)).</math>\n\nThese identities are important for comparison inequalities in geometry.  For example, the area enclosed by a circle of radius ''R'' in a flat space is always greater than the area of a spherical circle and smaller than a hyperbolic circle, provided all three circles have the same (intrinsic) radius.  That is,\n:<math>2\\pi(1-\\cos R) < \\pi R^2 < 2\\pi(1-\\cosh R)</math>\nfor all <math>R>0</math>.  Intuitively, this is because the sphere tends to curve back on itself, yielding circles of smaller area than those in the plane, whilst the hyperbolic plane, when immersed into space, develops fringes that produce additional area.  It is more generally true that the area of the circle of a fixed radius ''R'' is a strictly decreasing function of the curvature.\n\nIn all cases, if <math>k</math> is the curvature (constant, positive or negative), then the [[isoperimetric inequality]] for a domain with area ''A'' and perimeter ''L'' is\n:<math>L^2\\ge 4\\pi A - kA^2</math>\nwhere equality is achieved precisely for the circle.<ref>{{citation|author=Isaac Chavel|title=Isoperimetric inequalities|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Generalizations==\nWe can stretch a disk to form an [[ellipse]]. Because this stretch is a [[linear transformation]] of the plane, it has a distortion factor which will change the area but preserve ''ratios'' of areas. This observation can be used to compute the area of an arbitrary ellipse from the area of a unit circle.\n\nConsider the unit circle circumscribed by a square of side length 2. The transformation sends the circle to an ellipse by stretching or shrinking the horizontal and vertical diameters to the major and minor axes of the ellipse. The square gets sent to a rectangle circumscribing the ellipse. The ratio of the area of the circle to the square is {{pi}}/4, which means the ratio of the ellipse to the rectangle is also {{pi}}/4. Suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse. Since the area of the rectangle is ''ab'', the area of the ellipse is  {{pi}}''ab''/4.\n\nWe can also consider analogous measurements in higher dimensions. For example, we may wish to find the volume inside a sphere. When we have a formula for the surface area, we can use the same kind of “onion” approach we used for the disk.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation\n | author=Archimedes\n |author-link=Archimedes\n |editor-last=Heath\n |editor-first=T.

It is used in [[Quebec]], some areas of the [[United States customary units|United States]] that were part of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], and in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word ''arpent'' is believed to derive from the [[Late Latin]] ''arepennis'' (equal to half a ''[[jugerum]]''), which in turn comes from the [[Gaulish]] *''are-penno''- (\"end, extremity of a field\").\n\n==Unit of length==\n\nThere were various standard arpents. The most common were the arpent used in North America, which was defined as 180 [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Length|French feet]] (''{{lang|fr|pied}}'', of approximately {{convert|32.48|cm|in|disp=or}}), and the arpent used in Paris, which was defined as 220 French feet.\n\n* In North America, 1 arpent = 180 French feet = about 192 [[English foot|English feet]] = about 58.47 [[metre]]s\n* In Paris, 1 arpent = 220 French feet = about 234 English feet = about 71.46 metres\n\n==Unit of area==\n\nHistorically, in North America, 1 (square) arpent (''{{lang|fr|arpent carré}}''), also known as a French acre, was 180 French feet × 180 French feet = 32,400 French square feet = about 3419 [[square metre]]s = about 0.845 English [[acre]]s.

An ''arpent'' is a French measurement of approximately {{convert|192|ft|m}}, and a square arpent (also referred to as an ''arpent'') is about {{convert|0.84|acre|m2}}.\n\nFrench arpent land divisions are long narrow parcels of land, also called [[ribbon farm|ribbon farms]], usually found along the navigable streams of southern Louisiana, and also found along major waterways in other areas. This system of land subdivision was begun by French settlers in the 18th century, according to typical French practice at the time and was continued by both the Spanish and by the American government after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. A typical French arpent land division is 2 to 4 arpents wide along the river by 40 to 60 arpents deep, while the Spanish arpent land divisions tend to be 6 to 8 arpents wide by 40 arpents deep.\n\nThis method of land division provided each land-owner with river frontage as well as land suitable for cultivation and habitation. These areas are given numbers just like standard sections, although the section numbers frequently exceed the normal upper limit of 36.<ref name=\"natlatlas\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html The Public Land Survey System (PLSS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511182116/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Acre]]\n*[[Morgen]]\n* [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution]]\n* [[Voltaire]] famously dismissed Canada as ''[[Quelques arpents de neige]]'', \"a few acres of snow\".\n* [[Weights and Measures Act (Canada)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Units of area]]\n[[Category:Units of length]]\n[[Category:Area]]\n[[Category:Surveying]]\n\n[[hu:Hold (mértékegység)]]\n[[ro:Iugăr]]"

      "text": "In [[physiology]] and [[medicine]], the '''body surface area (BSA)''' is the measured or calculated [[surface area]] of a [[human body]]. For many clinical purposes BSA is a better indicator of metabolic mass than body weight because it is less affected by abnormal adipose mass. Nevertheless, there have been several important critiques of the use of BSA in determining the dosage of medications with a narrow [[therapeutic index]], such as [[chemotherapy]].\n\nTypically there is a 4–10 fold variation in drug clearance between individuals due to differing the activity of drug elimination processes related to genetic and environmental factors. This can lead to significant overdosing and underdosing (and increased risk of disease recurrence). It is also thought to be a distorting factor in Phase I and II trials that may result in potentially helpful medications being prematurely rejected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurney H |title=How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy |journal=Br.

      "text": "In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''[[Brahmagupta]]'s formula''' is used to find the [[area]] of any [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one that can be inscribed in a circle) given the lengths of the sides.\n\n== Formula ==\nBrahmagupta's formula gives the area {{math|''K''}} of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] whose sides have lengths {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''d''}} as\n\n: <math>K=\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''s''}}, the [[semiperimeter]], is defined to be\n\n: <math>s=\\frac{a+b+c+d}{2}.</math>\n\nThis formula generalizes [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a [[triangle]]. A triangle may be regarded as a quadrilateral with one side of length zero. From this perspective, as {{math|''d''}} approaches zero, a cyclic quadrilateral converges into a cyclic triangle (all triangles are cyclic), and Brahmagupta's formula simplifies to Heron's formula.\n\nIf the semiperimeter is not used, Brahmagupta's formula is\n\n: <math>K=\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(-a+b+c+d)(a-b+c+d)(a+b-c+d)(a+b+c-d)}.</math>\n\nAnother equivalent version is\n\n: <math>K=\\frac{\\sqrt{(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)^2+8abcd-2(a^4+b^4+c^4+d^4)}}{4}\\cdot</math>\n\n== Proof ==\n[[File:Brahmagupta's formula Sketch.png|455x455px|Diagram for reference|thumb]]\n\n===Trigonometric proof===\nHere the notations in the figure to the right are used. The area {{math|''K''}} of the cyclic quadrilateral equals the sum of the areas of {{math|△''ADB''}} and {{math|△''BDC''}}:\n\n:<math>= \\frac{1}{2}pq\\sin A + \\frac{1}{2}rs\\sin C.</math>\n\nBut since {{math|''ABCD''}} is a cyclic quadrilateral, {{math|∠''DAB'' {{=}} 180° − ∠''DCB''}}. Hence {{math|sin ''A'' {{=}} sin ''C''}}. Therefore,\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{1}{2}pq\\sin A + \\frac{1}{2}rs\\sin A</math>\n\n:<math>K^2 = \\frac{1}{4} (pq + rs)^2 \\sin^2 A</math>\n\n:<math>4K^2 = (pq + rs)^2 (1 - \\cos^2 A) = (pq + rs)^2 - (pq + rs)^2 \\cos^2 A.</math>\n\nSolving for common side {{math|''DB''}}, in {{math|△''ADB''}} and {{math|△''BDC''}}, the [[law of cosines]] gives\n\n:<math>p^2 + q^2 - 2pq\\cos A = r^2 + s^2 - 2rs\\cos C. </math>\n\nSubstituting {{math|cos ''C'' {{=}} −cos ''A''}} (since angles {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C''}} are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]]) and rearranging, we have\n\n:<math>2 (pq + rs) \\cos A = p^2 + q^2 - r^2 - s^2. </math>\n\nSubstituting this in the equation for the area,\n\n:<math>4K^2 = (pq + rs)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(p^2 + q^2 - r^2 - s^2)^2</math>\n\n:<math>16K^2 = 4(pq + rs)^2 - (p^2 + q^2 - r^2 - s^2)^2.</math>\n\nThe right-hand side is of the form {{math|''a''{{sup|2}} − ''b''{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''a'' − ''b'')(''a'' + ''b'')}} and hence can be written as\n\n:<math>[2(pq + rs) - p^2 - q^2 + r^2 +s^2][2(pq + rs) + p^2 + q^2 -r^2 - s^2] </math>\n\nwhich, upon rearranging the terms in the square brackets, yields\n\n:<math>= [ (r+s)^2 - (p-q)^2 ][ (p+q)^2 - (r-s)^2 ] </math>\n\n:<math>= (q+r+s-p)(p+r+s-q)(p+q+s-r)(p+q+r-s). </math>\n\nIntroducing the semiperimeter {{math|''S'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p'' + ''q'' + ''r'' + ''s''|2}}}},\n\n:<math>16K^2 = 16(S-p)(S-q)(S-r)(S-s). </math>\n\nTaking the square root, we get\n\n:<math>K = \\sqrt{(S-p)(S-q)(S-r)(S-s)}.</math>\n\n===Non-trigonometric proof===\nAn alternative, non-trigonometric proof utilizes two applications of Heron's triangle area formula on similar triangles.<ref>Hess, Albrecht, \"A highway from Heron to Brahmagupta\", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 12 (2012), 191–192.</ref>\n\n== Extension to non-cyclic quadrilaterals ==\nIn the case of non-cyclic quadrilaterals, Brahmagupta's formula can be extended by considering the measures of two opposite angles of the quadrilateral:\n\n: <math>K=\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-abcd\\cos^2\\theta}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''θ''}} is half the sum of any two opposite angles. (The choice of which pair of opposite angles is irrelevant: if the other two angles are taken, half their sum is {{math|180° − ''θ''}}. Since {{math|cos(180° − ''θ'') {{=}} −cos ''θ''}}, we have {{math|cos<sup>2</sup>(180° − ''θ'') {{=}} cos<sup>2</sup> ''θ''}}.) This more general formula is known as [[Bretschneider's formula]].\n\nIt is a property of [[cyclic quadrilateral]]s (and ultimately of [[inscribed angle]]s) that opposite angles of a quadrilateral sum to 180°.  Consequently, in the case of an inscribed quadrilateral, {{math|''θ''}} is 90°, whence the term\n\n:<math>abcd\\cos^2\\theta=abcd\\cos^2 \\left(90^\\circ\\right)=abcd\\cdot0=0, </math>\n\ngiving the basic form of Brahmagupta's formula. It follows from the latter equation that the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is the maximum possible area for any quadrilateral with the given side lengths.\n\nA related formula, which was proved by [[Julian Coolidge|Coolidge]], also gives the area of a general convex quadrilateral. It is<ref>J. L. Coolidge, \"A Historically Interesting Formula for the Area of a Quadrilateral\", ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''46''' (1939) pp. 345-347.</ref>\n\n: <math>K=\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-\\textstyle{1\\over4}(ac+bd+pq)(ac+bd-pq)}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are the lengths of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. In a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], {{math|''pq'' {{=}} ''ac'' + ''bd''}} according to [[Ptolemy's theorem]], and the formula of Coolidge reduces to Brahmagupta's formula.\n\n== Related theorems ==\n* [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a [[triangle]] is the special case obtained by taking {{math|''d'' {{=}} 0}}.\n* The relationship between the general and extended form of Brahmagupta's formula is similar to how the [[law of cosines]] extends the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n* Increasingly complicated closed-form formulas exist for the area of general polygons on circles, as described by Maley et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maley|first1=F.

This can be rewritten as\n:<math>\\frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} = (ad)^2 \\cos^2 \\alpha +(bc)^2 \\cos^2 \\gamma -2 abcd \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\gamma. </math>\n\nAdding this to the above formula for {{math|4''K''{{sup|2}}}} yields\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n4K^2 + \\frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} &= (ad)^2 + (bc)^2 - 2abcd \\cos (\\alpha + \\gamma) \\\\\n                                           &= (ad+bc)^2-2abcd-2abcd\\cos(\\alpha+\\gamma) \\\\\n                                           &= (ad+bc)^2 - 2abcd(\\cos(\\alpha+\\gamma)+1) \\\\\n                                           &= (ad+bc)^2 - 4abcd\\left(\\frac{\\cos(\\alpha+\\gamma)+1}{2}\\right) \\\\\n                                           &= (ad + bc)^2 - 4abcd \\cos^2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\gamma}{2}\\right). \n\\end{align} </math>\n\nNote that: <math>\\cos^2\\frac{\\alpha+\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{1+\\cos(\\alpha+\\gamma)}{2}</math> (a trigonometric identity true for all <math>\\frac{\\alpha+\\gamma}{2}</math>)\n\nFollowing the same steps as in [[Brahmagupta's formula#Trigonometric proof|Brahmagupta's formula]], this can be written as\n:<math>16K^2 = (a+b+c-d)(a+b-c+d)(a-b+c+d)(-a+b+c+d) - 16abcd \\cos^2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\gamma}{2}\\right).</math>\n\nIntroducing the semiperimeter\n:<math>s = \\frac{a+b+c+d}{2},</math> \nthe above becomes\n:<math>16K^2 = 16(s-d)(s-c)(s-b)(s-a) - 16abcd \\cos^2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\gamma}{2}\\right)</math>\n:<math>K^2 = (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - abcd \\cos^2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\gamma}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nand Bretschneider's formula follows after taking the square root of both sides:\n:<math> K = \\sqrt {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - abcd  \\cdot \\cos^2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\gamma}{2}\\right)}</math>\n\n== Related formulas ==\nBretschneider's formula generalizes [[Brahmagupta's formula]] for the area of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], which in turn generalizes [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a [[triangle]].\n\nThe trigonometric adjustment in Bretschneider's formula for non-cyclicality of the quadrilateral can be rewritten non-trigonometrically in terms of the sides and the diagonals {{math|''e''}} and {{math|''f''}} to give<ref>J.

      "text": "{{distinguish|Cavalieri's quadrature formula}}\n[[File:Cavalieri's Principle in Coins.JPG|thumb|250px|Two stacks of British coins with the same volume, illustrating Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], '''Cavalieri's principle''', a modern implementation of the '''method of indivisibles''', named after [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], is as follows:<ref>Howard Eves, \"Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence\", ''The College Mathematics Journal'', volume 22, number 2, March, 1991), pages 118&ndash;124</ref>\n\n* '''2-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in a plane are included between two parallel lines in that plane. If every line parallel to these two lines intersects both regions in line segments of equal length, then the two regions have equal areas.\n* '''3-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes.\n\nToday Cavalieri's principle is seen as an early step towards [[integral calculus]], and while it is used in some forms, such as its generalization in [[Fubini's theorem]], results using Cavalieri's principle can often be shown more directly via integration. In the other direction, Cavalieri's principle grew out of the ancient Greek [[method of exhaustion]], which used limits but did not use [[infinitesimal]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bonaventura Cavalieri.jpeg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], the mathematician the principle is named after.]]\nCavalieri's principle was originally called the method of indivisibles, the name it was known by in [[Renaissance Europe]]. Cavalieri developed a complete theory of indivisibles, elaborated in his ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'' (''Geometry, advanced in a new way by the indivisibles of the continua'', 1635) and his ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (''Six geometrical exercises'', 1647).<ref>[[Victor J. Katz|Katz, Victor J.]] (1998), ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2nd ed.), Addison-Wesley, p. 477.</ref>\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]], using a method resembling Cavalieri's principle,<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593 \"Archimedes' Lost Method\"]</ref> was able to find the volume of a sphere given the volumes of a cone and cylinder in his work ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''. In the 5th century AD, [[Zu Chongzhi]] and his son [[Zu Gengzhi]] established a similar method to find a sphere's volume.<ref>{{cite book |title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |edition=3 |first1=Dennis G. |last1=Zill |first2=Scott |last2=Wright |first3=Warren S. |last3=Wright |publisher=[[Jones & Bartlett Learning]] |year=2009 |isbn=0-7637-5995-3 |page=xxvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C&pg=PR27 Extract of page 27]</ref> The transition from Cavalieri's indivisibles to [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s and [[John Wallis]]'s [[infinitesimal]]s was a major advance in the history of the [[integral calculus|calculus]]. The indivisibles were entities of [[codimension]] 1, so that a plane figure was thought as made out of an infinity of 1-dimensional lines. Meanwhile, infinitesimals were entities of the same dimension as the figure they make up; thus, a plane figure would be made out of \"parallelograms\" of infinitesimal width. Applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, Wallis computed the area of a triangle by partitioning it into infinitesimal parallelograms of width&nbsp;1/∞.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Spheres ===\n[[Image:sphere cavalieri.svg|500px|thumb|The disk-shaped cross-section of the sphere has the same area as the ring-shaped cross-section of that part of the cylinder that lies ''outside'' the cone.]]\n\nIf one knows that the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is <math>\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\right)</math>, then one can use Cavalieri's principle to derive the fact that the volume of a [[sphere]] is <math>\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3</math>, where <math>r</math> is the radius.\n\nThat is done as follows: Consider a sphere of radius <math>r</math> and a cylinder of radius <math>r</math> and height <math>r</math>. Within the cylinder is the cone whose apex is at the center of one base of the cylinder and whose base is the other base of the cylinder. By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the plane located <math>y</math> units above the \"equator\" intersects the sphere in a circle of area <math>\\pi\\left(r^2 - y^2\\right)</math>. The area of the plane's intersection with the part of the cylinder that is ''outside'' of the cone is also <math>\\pi\\left(r^2 - y^2\\right)</math>. As we can see, the area of every intersection of the circle with the horizontal plane located at any height <math>y</math> equals the area of the intersection of the plane with the part of the cylinder that is \"outside\" of the cone; thus, applying Cavalieri's principle, we could say that the volume of the half sphere equals the volume of the part of the cylinder that is \"outside\" the cone. The aforementioned volume of the cone is <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> of the volume of the cylinder, thus the volume ''outside'' of the cone is <math>\\frac{2}{3}</math> the volume of the cylinder. Therefore the volume of the upper half of the sphere is <math>\\frac{2}{3}</math> of the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is\n\n:<math>\\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\pi r^2 \\cdot r = \\pi r^3</math>\n\n(\"Base\" is in units of ''area''; \"height\" is in units of ''distance''. Area&nbsp;×&nbsp;distance&nbsp;=&nbsp;volume.)\n\nTherefore the volume of the upper half-sphere is <math>\\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3</math> and that of the whole sphere is <math>\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3</math>.\n\n=== Cones and pyramids ===\n\nThe fact that the volume of any [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], regardless of the shape of the base, whether circular as in the case of a cone, or square as in the case of the Egyptian pyramids, or any other shape, is (1/3)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;base&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;height, can be established by Cavalieri's principle if one knows only that it is true in one case. One may initially establish it in a single case by partitioning the interior of a triangular prism into three pyramidal components of equal volumes. One may show the equality of those three volumes by means of Cavalieri's principle.\n\nIn fact, Cavalieri's principle or similar infinitesimal argument is ''necessary'' to compute the volume of cones and even pyramids, which is essentially the content of [[Hilbert's third problem]] – polyhedral pyramids and cones cannot be cut and rearranged into a standard shape, and instead must be compared by infinite (infinitesimal) means. The ancient Greeks used various precursor techniques such as Archimedes's mechanical arguments or [[method of exhaustion]] to compute these volumes.\n\n===The napkin ring problem===\n\n{{main|Napkin ring problem}}\n\n[[Image:sphere bands.svg|thumb|400px|If a hole of height ''h'' is drilled straight through the center of a sphere, the volume of the remaining band does not depend on the size of the sphere. For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer.]]\n\nIn what is called the [[napkin ring problem]], one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height ''h'', the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere.  The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is ''π'' times ''r''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''y''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>, where ''r'' is the sphere's radius and ''y'' is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is ''π'' times ''r''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(''h''/2)<sup>2</sup>.  When these are subtracted, the ''r''<sup>&nbsp;2</sup> cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon&nbsp;''r''.\n\n=== Cycloids ===<!-- This section is linked from [[visual calculus]]. -->\n\n[[Image:Folded cycloid.svg|thumb|400px|The horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by two cycloidal arcs traced by a point on the same circle rolling in one case clockwise on the line below it, and in the other counterclockwise on the line above it, has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the circle.]]\n\nN. Reed has shown<ref>N. Reed, \"[[Elementary proof]] of the area under a cycloid\", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'', volume 70, number 454, December, 1986, pages 290&ndash;291</ref> how to find the area bounded by a [[cycloid]] by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius ''r'' can roll in a clockwise direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which it would have turned clockwise and that through which it would have turned counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids.  By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region.\n\nConsider the rectangle bounding a single cycloid arch. From the definition of a cycloid, it has width {{math|2π''r''}} and height {{math|2''r''}}, so its area is four times the area of the circle. Calculate the area within this rectangle that lies above the cycloid arch by bisecting the rectangle at the midpoint where the arch meets the rectangle, rotate one piece by 180° and overlay the other half of the rectangle with it. The new rectangle, of area twice that of the circle, consists of the \"lens\" region between two cycloids, whose area was calculated above to be the same as that of the circle, and the two regions that formed the region above the cycloid arch in the original rectangle. Thus, the area bounded by a rectangle above a single complete arch of the cycloid has area equal to the area of the circle, and so, the area bounded by the arch is three times the area of the circle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fubini's theorem]] (Cavalieri's principle is a particular case of Fubini's theorem)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MathWorld |title=Cavalieri's Principle |urlname=CavalierisPrinciple}}\n* {{de icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20090202060633/http://dividano.de/prinzip-von-cavalieri.html Prinzip von Cavalieri]\n* [http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/5267/1/Grobler5_2011.pdf Cavalieri Integration]\n\n{{Infinitesimals}}\n\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Mathematical principles]]\n[[Category:History of calculus]]\n[[Category:Area]]\n[[Category:Volume]]"

The creation of new dissection puzzles is also considered to be a type of dissection puzzle. Puzzles may include various restraints, such as [[hinged dissection|hinged pieces]], pieces that can fold, or pieces that can twist. Creators of new dissection puzzles emphasize using a minimum number of pieces, or creating novel situations, such as ensuring that every piece connects to another with a hinge.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Stomachion.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Ostomachion]]'' is a dissection puzzle attributed to [[Archimedes]]]]\nDissection puzzles are an early form of geometric puzzle. The earliest known descriptions of dissection puzzles are from the time of [[Plato]] (427–347&nbsp;BCE) in [[Ancient Greece]], and involve the challenge of turning two equal squares into one larger square using four pieces. Other ancient dissection puzzles were used as graphic depictions of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (see [[square trisection]]). A famous ancient Greek dissection puzzle is the [[Ostomachion]], a mathematical treatise attributed to [[Archimedes]]; now the two equal squares are turned into one square in fourteen pieces by subdivision of the previous four pieces.\n\nIn the 10th century, Arabic mathematicians used geometric dissections in their commentaries on [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']]. In the 18th century, [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] scholar [[Tai Chen]] described an elegant dissection for approximating the value of ''[[pi|π]]''.\n\nThe puzzles saw a major increase in general popularity in the late 19th century when newspapers and magazines began running dissection puzzles. Puzzle creators [[Sam Loyd]] in the United States and [[Henry Dudeney]] in the United Kingdom were among the most published. Since then, dissection puzzles have been used for entertainment and [[maths education]], and creation of complex dissection puzzles is considered an exercise of geometric principles by mathematicians and math students.\n\nThe dissections of regular polygons and other simple geometric shapes into another such shape was the subject of [[Martin Gardner]]'s November 1961 \"[[Mathematical Games column]]\" in ''[[Scientific American]]''.  The haberdasher's problem shown in the figure below shows how to divide up a square and rearrange the pieces to make an equilateral triangle.  The column included a table of such best known dissections involving the square, pentagon, hexagon, [[greek cross]], and so on.\n\n== Types of dissection puzzle ==\n\nSome types of dissection puzzle are intended to create a large number of different geometric shapes. The [[tangram]] is a popular dissection puzzle of this type. The seven pieces can be configured into one of a few home shapes, such as the large square and rectangle that the pieces are often stored in, to any number of smaller squares, triangles, [[parallelogram]]s, or esoteric shapes and figures. Some geometric forms are easy to create, while others present an extreme challenge. This variability has ensured the puzzle's popularity.\n\nOther dissections are intended to move between a pair of geometric shapes, such as a triangle to a square, or a square to a five-pointed star. A dissection puzzle of this description is the '''haberdasher's problem''', proposed in 1907 by [[Henry Dudeney]]. The puzzle is a dissection of a triangle to a square, in only four pieces. It is one of the simplest regular polygon to square dissections known, and is now a classic example. It is not known whether a dissection of an equilateral triangle to a square is possible with three pieces.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" heights=\"200px\" widths=\"200px\">\nTangram rectangle.svg|A [[Tangram]] puzzle, with its pieces in the rectangular \"storage\" configuration.\nTriangledissection.svg|The haberdasher's problem, created by [[Henry Dudeney]].\nAnimação ilustrando equidecomponibilidade.gif|Animation illustrating equidecomposition\n</gallery>\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geometry}}\n* [[Ostomachion]]\n* [[Pizza theorem]]\n* [[Puzzle]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Coffin\n  | first = Stewart T.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = The Puzzling World of Polyhedral Dissections\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | year = 1990\n  | location =\n  | url = http://www.johnrausch.com/PuzzlingWorld/default.htm\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-19-853207-5 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Frederickson\n  | first = Greg N.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Dissections: Plane and Fancy\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | year = 1997\n  | location =\n  | url = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gnf/book.html\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-521-57197-9 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Frederickson\n  | first = Greg N.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Hinged Dissections: Swinging and Twisting\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | year = 2002\n  | location =\n  | url = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gnf/book2.html\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-521-81192-9 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Frederickson\n  | first = Greg N.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Piano-hinged Dissections: Time to Fold!\n  | publisher = [[A K Peters]]\n  | year = 2006\n  | location =\n  | url = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gnf/book3.html\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 1-56881-299-X }}\n*{{cite web\n  | last = Weisstein\n  | first = Eric W.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Haberdasher's Problem\n  | work = MathWorld\n  | publisher = Wolfram Web Resources\n  | year = 2006\n  | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HaberdashersProblem.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2006-08-08 }}\n</div>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dissection Puzzle}}\n[[Category:Area]]\n[[Category:Logic puzzles]]\n[[Category:Geometric dissection]]"

The greatest possible number of regions, {{nowrap|1=''r<sub>G</sub>'' = (&thinsp;{{su|p=''n''|b=4}}&thinsp;) + (&thinsp;{{su|p=''n''|b=2}}&thinsp;) + 1}}, giving the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 57, 99, 163, 256, ... ({{oeis|A000127}}). Though the first five terms match the [[geometric progression]] {{nowrap|1=2<sup>''n'' &minus; 1</sup>}}, it diverges at {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, showing the risk of generalising from only a few observations.\n\n== Lemma ==\n\n[[Image:DividingACircleIntoAreas-Box.png|right|150px|Lemma]]\nIf we already have ''n'' points on the circle and add one more point, we draw ''n'' lines from the new point to previously existing points. Two cases are possible. In the first case ('''a'''), the new line passes through a point where two or more old lines (between previously existing points) cross. In the second case ('''b'''), the new line crosses each of the old lines in a different point. It will be useful to know the following fact.\n\n'''Lemma'''. We can choose the new point ''A'' so that case ''b'' occurs for each of the new lines.\n\n'''Proof'''. Notice that, for the case ''a'', three points must be on one line: the new point ''A'', the old point ''O'' to which we draw the line, and the point ''I'' where two of the old lines intersect. Notice that there are ''n'' old points ''O'', and hence finitely many points ''I'' where two of the old lines intersect. For each ''O'' and ''I'', the line ''OI'' crosses the circle in one point other than ''O''.  Since the circle has infinitely many points, it has a point ''A'' which will be on none of the lines ''OI''. Then, for this point ''A'' and all of the old points ''O'', case ''b'' will be true.\n\nThis lemma means that, if there are ''k'' lines crossing ''AO'', then each of them crosses ''AO'' at a different point and ''k+1'' new areas are created by the line ''AO''.\n\n== Solution ==\n\n=== Inductive method ===\n\nThe lemma establishes an important property for solving the problem. By employing an [[mathematical induction|inductive proof]], one can arrive at a formula for ''f''(''n'') in terms of ''f''(''n'' − 1).\n\n[[Image:DividingACircleIntoAreas.svg|right|180px|Proof]]\n\nIn the figure you can see the dark lines connecting\npoints 1 through 4 dividing the circle into 8 total\nregions (i.e., ''f''(4) = 8).  This figure illustrates the inductive\nstep from ''n'' = 4 to ''n'' = 5 with the dashed lines.  When the fifth point is added (i.e., when\ncomputing ''f''(5) using ''f''(4)), this results\nin four new lines (the dashed lines in the diagram) being added, numbered 1 through 4, one for each point that they connect\nto. The number of new regions introduced by the fifth point can\ntherefore be determined by considering the number of regions added by\neach of the 4 lines.  Set ''i'' to count the lines we are adding.\nEach new line can cross a number of existing lines, depending on which\npoint it is to (the value of ''i'').  The new lines will never cross\neach other, except at the new point.\n\nThe number of lines that each new line intersects can be determined by\nconsidering the number of points on the \"left\" of the line and the\nnumber of points on the \"right\" of the line.  Since all existing\npoints already have lines between them, the number of points on the\nleft multiplied by the number of points on the right is the number of\nlines that will be crossing the new line.

This will be the case if the points on the circle are chosen \"[[in general position]]\". Under this assumption of \"generic intersection\", the number of regions can also be determined in a non-inductive way, using the formula for the [[Euler characteristic]] of a [[Connectivity (graph theory)#Definitions of components.2C cuts and connectivity|connected]] [[planar graph]] (viewed here as a graph embedded in the 2-[[sphere]] S<sup> 2</sup>).\n\nA planar graph determines a [[cell decomposition]] of the plane with ''F'' faces (2-dimensional cells), ''E'' edges (1-dimensional cells) and ''V'' vertices (0-dimensional cells). As the graph is connected, the Euler relation for the 2-dimensional sphere S<sup> 2</sup> \n:<math>\\, V-E+F=2 </math>\nholds. View the diagram (the circle together with all the chords) above as a planar graph. If the general formulas for ''V'' and ''E'' can both be found, the formula for ''F'' can also be derived, which will solve the problem.\n\nIts vertices include the ''n'' points on the circle, referred to as the exterior vertices, as well as the interior vertices, the intersections of distinct chords in the interior of the circle. The \"generic intersection\" assumption made above guarantees that each interior vertex is the intersection of no more than two chords.\n\nThus the main task in determining ''V'' is finding the number of interior vertices. As a consequence of the lemma, any two intersecting chords will uniquely determine an interior vertex. These chords are in turn uniquely determined by the four corresponding endpoints of the chords, which are all exterior vertices. Any four exterior vertices determine a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], and all cyclic quadrilaterals are convex [[quadrilateral]]s, so each set of four exterior vertices have exactly one point of intersection formed by their diagonals(chords). Further, by definition ''all'' interior vertices are formed by intersecting chords.\n\nTherefore each interior vertex is uniquely determined by a combination of four exterior vertices, where the number of interior vertices is given by\n:<math>V_{\\text{interior}} = { n \\choose 4 },</math>\nand so\n:<math>V = V_{\\text{exterior}} + V_{\\text{interior}} = n + { n \\choose 4 }.</math>\n\nThe edges include the ''n'' [[circular arc]]s connecting pairs of adjacent exterior vertices, as well as the chordal line segments (described below) created inside the circle by the collection of chords. Since there are two groups of vertices: exterior and interior, the chordal line segments can be further categorized into three groups:\n# Edges directly (not cut by other chords) connecting two exterior vertices. These are chords between adjacent exterior vertices, and form the perimeter of the polygon. There are ''n'' such edges.\n# Edges connecting two interior vertices.\n# Edges connecting an interior and exterior vertex.\n\nTo find the number of edges in groups 2 and 3, consider each interior vertex, which is connected to exactly four edges. This yields\n:<math>4{ n \\choose 4 }</math>\nedges. Since each edge is defined by two endpoint vertices, and we only enumerated the interior vertices, group 2 edges are counted twice while group 3 edges are counted once only.\n\nNotice that every chord that is cut by another (i.e., chords not in group 1) must contain two group 3 edges, its beginning and ending chordal segments. As chords are uniquely determined by two exterior vertices, there are altogether\n:<math>2\\left( { n \\choose 2 } - n \\right)</math>\ngroup 3 edges. This is twice the total number of chords that are not themselves members of group 1.\n\nThe sum of these results divided by two gives the combined number of edges in groups 2 and 3. Adding the ''n'' edges from group 1, and the ''n'' circular arc edges brings the total to\n:<math>E = \\frac{4{ n \\choose 4 } + 2\\left( { n \\choose 2 } - n \\right)}{2} + n + n = 2{ n \\choose 4 } + { n \\choose 2 } + n.</math>\n\nSubstituting ''V'' and ''E'' into the Euler relation solved for ''F'', <math>\\, F = E - V + 2, </math> one then obtains\n:<math> F = { n \\choose 4 } + { n \\choose 2 } + 2.</math>\n\nSince one of these faces is the exterior of the circle, the number of regions ''r''<sub>''G''</sub> inside the circle is ''F'' − 1, or\n\n:<math> r_G={n \\choose 4}+{n \\choose 2}+1,</math>\n\nwhich resolves to\n\n:<math>r_G=\\frac{n!}{(n-4)! 4!}+\\frac{n!}{(n-2)! 2!}+1</math>\n\nwhich yields the same quartic polynomial obtained by using the inductive method\n\n:<math>r_G=\\frac{1}{24}n(n^3-6n^2+23n-18)+1</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lazy caterer's sequence]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*[[John Horton Conway|Conway, J.

For example, on a closed curve <math> C </math> of length {{math|2''L''}}, for each point {{math|''x''}} of the curve there is a unique other point of the curve (called the '''antipodal''' of {{math|''x''}}) at distance {{math|''L''}} from {{math|''x''}}.\n\nA [[compact space|compact]] surface {{math|''M''}} '''fills''' a closed curve {{math|C}} if its border (also called [[Manifold#Manifold with boundary|boundary]], denoted {{math|∂''M''}}) is the curve {{math|C}}. The filling {{math|''M''}} is said '''isometric''' if for any two points {{math|''x'',''y''}} of the boundary curve {{math|''C''}}, the distance {{math|''d''<sub>''M''</sub>(''x'',''y'')}} between them along {{math|''M''}} is the same (not less) than the distance {{math|''d''<sub>''C''</sub>(''x'',''y'')}} along the boundary. In other words, to fill a curve isometrically is to fill it without introducing shortcuts.\n\n'''Question:''' ''How small can be the area of a surface that isometrically fills its boundary curve, of given length?''\n\nFor example, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, the circle\n\n:<math> C = \\{(x,y,0):\\ x^2+y^2=1\\} </math>\n\n(of length 2{{pi}}) is filled by the flat disk\n\n:<math> D = \\{(x,y,0):\\ x^2+y^2\\leq 1\\} </math>\n\nwhich is not an isometric filling, because any straight chord along it is a shortcut. In contrast, the hemisphere\n\n:<math> H = \\{(x,y,z):\\ x^2+y^2+z^2=1\\text{ and }z\\geq 0\\}</math>\n\nis an isometric filling of the same circle {{math|''C''}}, which has [[On the Sphere and Cylinder|twice the area of the flat disk]]. Is this the minimum possible area?\n\nThe surface can be imagined as made of a flexible but non-stretchable material, that allows it to be moved around and bended in Euclidean space. None of these transformations modifies the area of the surface nor the length of the curves drawn on it, which are the magnitudes relevant to the problem. The surface can be removed from Euclidean space altogether, obtaining a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian surface]], which is an abstract [[differentiable manifold|smooth surface]] with a [[Riemannian metric]] that encodes the lengths and area. Reciprocally, according to the [[Nash-Kuiper theorem]], any Riemannian surface with boundary can be embedded in Euclidean space preserving the lengths and area specified by the Riemannian metric. Thus the filling problem can be stated equivalently as a question about [[differential geometry of surfaces|Riemannian surfaces]], that are not placed in Euclidean space in any particular way.\n\n:'''Conjecture''' (Gromov's filling area conjecture, 1983): ''The hemisphere has minimum area among the [[orientable]] compact Riemannian surfaces that fill isometrically their boundary curve, of given length.''<ref name=gromov1983filling>{{cite journal| last = Gromov | first = Mikhail | year = 1983 | title = Filling Riemannian Manifolds | journal = J.

Glue each point <math> x\\in \\partial M</math> with its antipodal point <math> -x </math>, defined as the unique point of <math> \\partial M </math> that is at the maximum possible distance <math> L </math> from <math> x </math>. Gluing in this way we obtain a closed Riemannian surface <math> M' </math> that is homeomorphic to the [[real projective plane]] and whose [[Systolic geometry#The notion of systole|systole]] (the length of the shortest non-contractible curve) is equal to <math> L </math>. (And reciprocally, if we cut open a projective plane along a shortest noncontractible loop of length <math> L </math>, we obtain a disk that fills isometrically its boundary of length <math> 2L </math>.) Thus the minimum area that the isometric filling <math> M </math> can have is equal to the minimum area that a Riemannian projective plane of systole <math> L </math> can have. But then [[Pu's inequality|Pu's systolic inequality]] asserts precisely that a Riemannian projective plane of given systole has minimum area if and only if it is round (that is, obtained from a Euclidean sphere by identifying each point with its opposite). The area of this round projective plane equals the area of the hemisphere (because each of them has half the area of the sphere).\n\nThe proof of Pu's inequality relies, in turn, on the [[uniformization theorem]].\n\n== Fillings with Finsler metrics ==\n\nIn 2001, Sergei Ivanov presented another way to prove that the hemisphere has smallest area among isometric fillings homeomorphic to a disk.<ref>{{cite journal | title= On two-dimensional minimal fillings |  language = Russian | first = Sergei V. | last = Ivanov | journal = Algebra I Analiz | volume = 13 | number = 1 | pages = 26–38 | year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title= On two-dimensional minimal fillings | language = english | first = Sergei V. | last = Ivanov | journal = St. Petersburg Math.

Moreover, Ivanov's proof applies more generally to disks with [[Finsler manifold|Finsler metrics]], which differ from Riemannian metrics in that they need not satisfy the [[Pythagorean equation]] at the infinitesimal level. The area of a Finsler surface can be defined in various inequivalent ways, and the one employed here is the [[Holmes–Thompson volume|Holmes–Thompson area]], which coincides with the usual area when the metric is Riemannian. What Ivanov proved is that\n\n:''The hemisphere has minimum Holmes–Thompson area among Finsler disks that isometrically fill a closed curve of given length.''\n\n{{collapse top| title = Proof of Ivanov's theorem}}\nLet {{math|(''M'',''F'')}} be a Finsler disk that isometrically fills its boundary of length {{math|2''L''}}.

For each point <math> p_i </math>, we define on ''M'' the scalar function <math> f_i(x)=\\mathrm{dist}_F(p_i,x)</math>. These functions have the following properties:\n* Each function <math> f_i:M\\to\\mathbb R </math> is Lipschitz on ''M'' and therefore (by [[Rademacher's theorem]]) differentiable at [[almost every]] point <math> x\\in M </math>.\n* If <math> f_i </math> is differentiable at an interior point <math> x\\in M^\\circ </math>, then there is a unique shortest curve from <math> p_i </math> to ''x'' (parametrized with unit speed), that arrives  at ''x'' with a speed <math> v_i </math>.

Indeed, they must be distinct because different geodesics cannot arrive at <math> x </math> with the same speed. Also, if three of these covectors <math> \\mathrm d_xf_i, \\mathrm d_xf_j,\\mathrm d_xf_k  </math> (for some <math> 0\\leq i<j<k<n </math>) appeared in inverted order, then two of the three shortest curves from the points <math> p_i, p_j, p_k \\in\\partial M </math> to <math> x </math> would cross each other, which is not possible.\n\nIn summary, for almost every interior point <math> x\\in M^\\circ </math>, the covectors <math> \\mathrm d_xf_i </math> are vertices, listed in counterclockwise order, of a convex polygon inscribed in the dual unit ball <math> B_x^* </math>. The area of this polygon is <math> \\sum_i \\frac 12 \\mathrm d_xf_i\\wedge\\mathrm d_xf_{i+1} </math> (where the index ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is computed modulo ''n''). Therefore we have a lower bound\n\n::<math> c_P:=\\int_M \\sum_i \\frac 12 \\mathrm df_i\\wedge\\mathrm df_{i+1} \\leq \\pi\\, \\operatorname{Area}_{\\mathrm{HT}}(M,F), </math>\n\nfor the area of the filling. If we define the 1-form <math> \\theta_P = \\sum_i \\frac 12 f_i\\,\\mathrm df_{i+1} </math>, then we can rewrite this lower bound using the [[Stokes' theorem|Stokes formula]] as\n\n::<math> c_P = \\int_M \\mathrm d\\theta_P = \\int_{\\partial M} \\theta_P = \\dots = 2L^2 - \\sum_i \\delta_i^2\\ \\xrightarrow{P\\ \\text{dense}}\\ 2L^2 </math>.\n\nThe boundary integral that appears here is defined in terms of the distance functions <math> f_i </math> restricted to the boundary, which ''do not depend on the isometric filling''. The result of the integral therefore depends only on the placement of the points <math> p_i </math> on the circle of length ''2L''. We omitted the computation, and expressed the result in terms of the lengths <math> \\delta_i </math> of each counterclockwise boundary arc from a point <math> p_i </math> to the following point <math> p_{i+1} </math>. The computation is valid only if <math> \\delta_i < \\frac L 2 </math>.\n\nIn summary, our lower bound for the area of the Finsler isometric filling converges to <math> \\frac 1\\pi 2L^2 </math> as the collection <math> P\\subseteq \\partial M </math> is densified. This implies that\n\n::<math> \\operatorname{Area}_{\\mathrm{HT}}(M,F) \\geq \\frac 1\\pi\\,2L^2 = \\operatorname{Area}(\\text{hemisphere})</math>,\n\nas we had to prove.\n\n<!-- he formula <math> \\operatorname{Area}_{\\mathrm{HT}}(M,F)\\simeq \\int_M \\mathrm d\\theta_P </math> can be thought of as a finite-sum approximation of [[Holmes–Thompson volume#Santaló's formula|Santalo’s formula]] for computing the area of a Riemannian (or Finslerian) disk with no conjugate points in terms of boundary distances.

The non-orientable closed surface obtained in this way has an [[Orientability#Orientable double cover|orientable double cover]] of genus two, and is therefore [[hyperelliptic curve|hyperelliptic]]. The proof then exploits a formula by J.&nbsp;Hersch from integral geometry. Namely, consider the family of figure-8 loops on a football, with the self-intersection point at the equator. Hersch's formula expresses the area of a metric in the conformal class of the football, as an average of the energies of the figure-8 loops from the family.  An application of Hersch's formula to the hyperelliptic quotient of the Riemann surface proves the filling area conjecture in this case.\n\n== Almost flat manifolds are minimal fillings of their boundary distances ==\n\nIf a Riemannian manifold {{math|''M''}} (of any dimension) is '''almost flat''' (more precisely, {{math|''M''}} is a region of <math> \\mathbb R^n </math> with a Riemannian metric that is <math> C^2 </math>-near the standard Euclidean metric), then {{math|''M''}} is a '''volume minimizer''': it cannot be replaced by an orientable Riemannian manifold that fills the same boundary and has less volume without reducing the distance between some boundary points.<ref name=\"burago2010boundary\">{{ cite journal | title = Boundary rigidity and filling volume minimality of metrics close to a flat one | first = Dmitri | last = Burago | first2 = Sergei V. | last2 = Ivanov | journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2 | volume = 171 | number = 2 | year = 2010 | pages = 1183–1211 | doi = 10.4007/annals.2010.171.1183 | mr = 2630062 }}</ref> This implies that if a piece of sphere is sufficiently small (and therefore, nearly flat), then it is a volume minimizer.

Now we extend the segment ''q'' to its left by ''p'' (using arc ''AE'' centered on ''D'') and draw a half circle with endpoints ''A'' and ''B'' with the new segment ''p+q'' as its diameter. Then we erect a perpendicular line to the diameter in ''D'' that intersects the half circle in ''C''. Due to [[Thales' theorem]] ''C'' and the diameter form a [[right triangle]] with the line segment ''DC'' as its altitude, hence ''DC'' is the side of a square with the area of the rectangle. The method also allows for the construction of square roots (see [[constructible number]]), since starting with a rectangle that has a width of 1 the constructed square will have a side length that equals the square root of the rectangle's length.\n\n[[File:Sehnensatz hoehensatz.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|geometric mean theorem as a special case of the [[intersecting chords theorem|chord theorem]]:<br/><math>|CD||DE|=|AD||DB| \\Leftrightarrow h^2=pq</math>]]\nThe converse statement is true as well. Any triangle, in which the altitude equals the geometric mean of the two line segments created by it, is a right triangle.\n\nThe geometric mean theorem can also be thought of a special case of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] for a circle, since the converse of [[Thales' theorem]] ensures that the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle is the diameter of its [[circumcircle]].\n\nHistorically the theorem is attributed to [[Euclid]] (ca. 360–280 BC), who stated it as a corollary to proposition 8 in book VI of his [[Euclid's elements|Elements]]. In proposition 14 of book II Euclid gives a method for squaring a rectangle, which essentially matches the method given here. Euclid however provides  a different slightly more complicated proof for the correctness of the construction rather than relying on the geometric mean theorem.\n\n==Proof==\n===Based on similarity===\n[[File:Hoehensatz.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|{{center|<math>\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ADC \\sim \\triangle DBC</math>}}]]\n'''Proof of theorem''':\n\nThe triangles <math>\\triangle ADC </math> and <math>\\triangle BCD</math> are [[Similar triangle#Similar triangles|similar]], since:\n* consider triangles <math>\\triangle ABC, \\triangle ACD</math>, here we have <math>\\angle ACB=\\angle ADC=90^\\circ</math> and <math>\\angle BAC=\\angle CAD</math>, therefore by the [[AA postulate]] <math>\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ACD </math>\n* further, consider triangles <math>\\triangle ABC, \\triangle BCD</math>, here we have <math>\\angle ACB=\\angle BDC= 90^\\circ</math> and <math>\\angle ABC=\\angle CBD</math>, therefore by the AA postulate <math>\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle BCD</math>\n\nTherefore, both triangles <math>\\triangle ACD</math> and <math>\\triangle BCD</math> are similar to <math>\\triangle ABC</math> and themselves, i.e. <math>\\triangle ACD \\sim \\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle BCD</math>.\n\nBecause of the similarity we get the following equality of ratios and its algebraic rearrangement yields the theorem:\n:<math> \\frac{h}{p}=\\frac{q}{h}\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,h^2=pq\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,h=\\sqrt{pq}\\qquad (h,p,q> 0)</math>\n\n'''Proof of converse:'''\n\nFor the converse we have a triangle <math>\\triangle ABC </math> in which <math>h^2=pq</math> holds and need to show that the angle at ''C'' is a right angle. Now because of <math>h^2=pq</math> we also have <math>\\tfrac{h}{p}=\\tfrac{q}{h} </math>. Together with <math>\\angle ADC=\\angle CDB </math> the triangles <math>\\triangle ADC </math> and <math>\\triangle BDC </math> have an angle of equal size and have corresponding pairs of legs with the same ratio. This means the triangles are similar, which yields:\n::<math>\\angle ACB=\\angle ACD +\\angle DCB=\\angle ACD+(90^\\circ-\\angle DBC)=\\angle ACD+(90^\\circ-\\angle ACD)=90^\\circ</math>\n\n===Based on the Pythagorean theorem===\n[[File:Hoehensatz beweis pythagoras.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|Proof with the Pythagorean theorem]]\nIn the setting of the geometric mean theorem there are three right triangles <math>\\triangle ABC </math>, <math>\\triangle ADC </math> and <math>\\triangle DBC </math>, in which the Pythagorean theorem yields:\n:<math>h^2=a^2-q^2</math>, <math>h^2=b^2-p^2</math> and <math>c^2=a^2+b^2</math>\nAdding the first 2 two equations and then using the third then leads to:\n:<math>2h^2=a^2+b^2-p^2-q^2=c^2-p^2-q^2=(p+q)^2-p^2-q^2=2pq</math>.\nA division by two finally yields the formula of the geometric mean theorem.\n\n===Based on dissection and rearrangement===\n[[File:Geometrischer Höhensatzbeweis.svg]]\n\nDissecting the right triangle along its altitude ''h'' yields two similar triangles, which can be augmented and arranged in two alternative ways into a larger right triangle with perpendicular sides of lengths ''p+h'' and ''q+h''. One such arrangement requires a square of area ''h<sup>2</sup>'' to complete it, the other a rectangle of area ''pq''. Since both arrangements yield the same triangle, the areas of the square and the rectangle must be identical.\n\n===Based on shear mappings===\nThe square of the altitude can be transformed into an rectangle of equal area with sides ''p'' and ''q'' with the help of three [[shear mapping]]s (shear mappings preserve the area):\n\n[[File:Scherungen alle2.svg|thumb|center|upright=4.0|Shear mappings with their associated fixed lines (dotted), starting with the original square as preimage each parallelogram displays the image of a shear mapping of the figure left of it]]\n\n==References==\n*Claudi Alsina, Roger B.
