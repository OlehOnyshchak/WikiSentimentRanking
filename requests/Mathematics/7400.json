The central pentagon region can be considered interior or exterior depending on how interior is defined.

The image is flipped laterally by the prism.]]\nA '''pentaprism''' is a five-sided reflecting [[prism (optics)|prism]] used to deviate a beam of [[light]] by a constant 90°, even if the entry beam is not at 90° to the prism.\nThe beam reflects inside the prism ''twice'',<ref name=darkside/> allowing the transmission of an image through a right angle without inverting it (that is, without changing the image's [[Chirality (electromagnetism)|handedness]]) as an ordinary right-angle prism or mirror would.\n\nThe reflections inside the prism are not caused by [[total internal reflection]], since the beams are incident at an angle less than the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] (the minimum angle for total internal reflection). Instead, the two faces are coated to provide [[mirror]] surfaces. The two opposite transmitting faces are often coated with an [[anti-reflective coating|antireflection coating]] to reduce spurious reflections. The fifth face of the prism is not used optically but truncates what would otherwise be an awkward angle joining the two mirrored faces.\n\n== In cameras ==\n[[Image:Roof pentaprism example.jpg|thumb|left|An image as seen through a roof pentaprism.

In this case, the image needs to be reflected left-to-right as the prism transmits the image formed on the [[camera]]'s [[focusing screen]]. This lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a \"[[roof prism|roof]]\" section, with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90°, which laterally reverses the image back to normal. [[Reflex camera]]s with waist-level finders (viewed from above), including many [[medium format camera]]s, display a laterally reversed image directly from the focusing screen which is viewed from above.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Compared to the Pentamirror ===\n\nThe same optical paths can be realized with three mirrors, in an arrangement called the [[Pentamirror]].  While substantially lighter, the light enters and exits the mirrors' glass several times, each time losing brightness and instead scattering.  The pentaprism is typically much heavier, but only has one entrance and one exit, providing a notably superior optical performance.  Additionally, pentamirrors can conceivably go out of alignment while a pentaprism's facets are perfectly aligned until it is destroyed.  <ref>David D. Busch.

All [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] parallel to the bases are translations of the bases. Prisms are named for their bases, so a prism with a [[pentagonal]] base is called a pentagonal prism. The prisms are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.\n\n==General, right and uniform prisms==\nA '''right prism''' is a prism in which the joining edges and faces are [[perpendicular]] to the base faces.<ref>William F. Kern, James R Bland,''Solid Mensuration with proofs'', 1938, p.28</ref> This applies if the joining faces are [[rectangular]]. If the joining edges and faces are not perpendicular to the base faces, it is called an '''oblique prism'''. \n\nFor example a [[parallelepiped]] is an ''oblique prism'' of which the base is a [[parallelogram]], or equivalently a polyhedron with six faces which are all parallelograms.\n[[File:TruncatedTriangularPrism.png|thumb|left|100px|A truncated triangular prism with its top face truncated at an oblique angle]]\nA '''truncated prism''' is a prism with nonparallel top and bottom faces.<ref>William F. Kern, James R Bland,''Solid Mensuration with proofs'', 1938, p.81</ref>\n\nSome texts may apply the term '''rectangular prism''' or '''square prism''' to both a right rectangular-sided prism and a right square-sided prism.  A ''right p-gonal prism'' with rectangular sides has a Schläfli symbol { } × {p}.\n\nA right rectangular prism is also called a ''[[cuboid]]'', or informally a ''rectangular box''. A right square prism is simply a ''square box'', and may also be called a ''square cuboid''. A ''right rectangular prism'' has [[Schläfli symbol]] { }×{ }×{ }.\n\nAn ''n''-prism, having [[regular polygon]] ends and [[rectangular]] sides, approaches a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] solid as ''n'' approaches [[infinity]].\n\nThe term '''uniform prism''' or ''semiregular prism'' can be used for a ''right prism'' with [[square]] sides, since such prisms are in the set of [[uniform polyhedra]]. A ''uniform p-gonal prism'' has a [[Schläfli symbol]] t{2,p}. Right prisms with regular bases and equal edge lengths form one of the two infinite series of [[semiregular polyhedra]], the other series being the [[antiprism]]s.\n\nThe [[dual polyhedron|dual]] of a ''right prism'' is a [[bipyramid]].\n\n==Volume==\nThe [[volume]] of a prism is the product of the [[area]] of the base and the distance between the two base faces, or the height (in the case of a non-right prism, note that this means the perpendicular distance).\n\nThe volume is therefore:\n:<math>V = Bh</math>\n\nwhere ''B'' is the base area and ''h'' is the height. The volume of a prism whose base is a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] with side length ''s'' is therefore:\n:<math>V = \\frac{n}{4}hs^2 \\cot(\\frac{\\pi}{n})</math>\n\n==Surface area==\nThe surface [[area]] of a right prism is:\n:<math>2B + Ph</math>\nwhere ''B'' is the area of the base, ''h'' the height, and ''P'' the base [[perimeter]].\n\nThe surface area of a right prism whose base is a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] with side length ''s'' and height ''h'' is therefore:\n\n:<math>A = \\frac{n}{2} s^2 \\cot{\\frac{\\pi}{n}} + n s h</math>\n\n== [[Schlegel diagram]]s ==\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Triangular prismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>P3\n|[[File:Cubical graph.png|100px]]<BR>P4\n|[[File:Pentagonal prismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>P5\n|[[File:Hexagonal prismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>P6\n|[[File:Heptagonal prismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>P7\n|[[File:Octagonal prismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>P8\n|}\n\n==Symmetry==\nThe [[symmetry group]] of a right ''n''-sided prism with regular base is [[dihedral group|D<sub>''n''h</sub>]] of order 4''n'', except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group [[octahedral symmetry|O<sub>h</sub>]] of order 48, which has three versions of D<sub>4h</sub> as [[subgroup]]s. The [[Point groups in three dimensions#Rotation groups|rotation group]] is D<sub>''n''</sub> of order 2''n'', except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D<sub>4</sub> as subgroups.\n\nThe symmetry group D<sub>''n''h</sub> contains [[Point reflection|inversion]] [[If and only if|iff]] ''n'' is even.\n\nThe [[Hosohedron|hosohedra]] and [[Dihedron|dihedra]] also possess dihedral symmetry, and a n-gonal prism can be constructed via [[Truncation (geometry)|the geometrical truncation]] of a n-gonal hosohedron, as well as through the [[cantellation]] or [[Expansion (geometry)|expansion]] of a n-gonal dihedron<!--do hosohedra work with expansion?-->.\n\n==Prismatic polytope==\nA ''prismatic [[polytope]]'' is a higher-dimensional generalization of a prism. An ''n''-dimensional prismatic polytope is constructed from two ({{nowrap|''n'' − 1}})-dimensional polytopes, translated into the next dimension.\n\nThe prismatic ''n''-polytope elements are doubled from the ({{nowrap|''n'' − 1}})-polytope elements and then creating new elements from the next lower element.\n\nTake an ''n''-polytope with ''f<sub>i</sub>'' [[Face|''i''-face]] elements ({{nowrap|''i'' {{=}} 0, ..., ''n''}}). Its ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-polytope prism will have {{nowrap|2''f''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''f''<sub>''i''−1</sub>}} ''i''-face elements. (With {{nowrap|''f''<sub>−1</sub> {{=}} 0}}, {{nowrap|''f''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} 1}}.)\n\nBy dimension:\n*Take a [[polygon]] with ''n'' vertices, ''n'' edges. Its prism has 2''n'' vertices, 3''n'' edges, and {{nowrap|2 + ''n''}} faces.\n*Take a [[polyhedron]] with ''v'' vertices, ''e'' edges, and ''f'' faces.

The dimension of a polytope is the product of the dimensions of the elements. The first example of these exist in 4-dimensional space are called [[duoprism]]s as the product of two polygons. Regular duoprisms are represented as {''p''}×{''q''}.\n\n{{UniformPrisms}}\n\n== Twisted prism==\nA '''twisted prism''' is a nonconvex prism polyhedron constructed by a uniform ''q''-prism with the side faces bisected on the square diagonal, and twisting the top, usually by {{sfrac|{{pi}}|''q''}} radians ({{sfrac|180|''q''}} degrees) in the same direction, causing side triangles to be concave.<ref>The facts on file: Geometry handbook, Catherine A.

They exist in two infinite families, the uniform [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]] and the uniform [[antiprism]]s. All have their vertices in parallel planes and are therefore [[prismatoid]]s.\n\n== Vertex configuration and symmetry groups ==\n\nBecause they are [ figure|isogonal]] (vertex-transitive), their [[vertex arrangement]] uniquely corresponds to a [[Point groups in three dimensions|symmetry group]]. \n\nThe difference between the prismatic and antiprismatic symmetry groups is that  '''D<sub>''p''h</sub>''' has the vertices lined up in both planes, which gives it a reflection plane perpendicular to its ''p''-fold axis (parallel to the {p/q} polygon); while '''D<sub>''p''d</sub>''' has the vertices twisted relative to the other plane, which gives it a rotatory reflection.  Each has ''p'' reflection planes which contain the ''p''-fold axis.\n\nThe '''D<sub>''p''h</sub>''' symmetry group contains [[Inversion in a point|inversion]] if and only if ''p'' is even, while '''D<sub>''p''d</sub>''' contains inversion symmetry if and only if ''p'' is odd.\nthe uniform prism\n\n== Enumeration ==\n\nThere are:\n\n* [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s, for each rational number ''p/q'' &gt; 2, with symmetry group '''D<sub>''p''h</sub>''';\n* [[antiprism]]s, for each rational number ''p/q'' &gt; 3/2, with symmetry group '''D<sub>''p''d</sub>''' if ''q'' is odd, '''D<sub>''p''h</sub>''' if ''q'' is even.\n\nIf ''p/q'' is an integer, i.e. if ''q'' = 1, the prism or antiprism is convex.  (The fraction is always assumed to be stated in lowest terms.)\n\nAn antiprism with ''p/q'' &lt; 2 is ''crossed'' or ''retrograde''; its [[vertex figure]] resembles a bowtie.

The qualifier \"globally\" is to contrast with ''locally'' projective polyhedra, which are [[#Generalizations|defined]] in the theory of [[abstract polyhedra]].\n\nNon-overlapping projective polyhedra ([[density (polytope)|density]] 1) correspond to [[spherical polyhedra]] (equivalently, [[convex polyhedra]]) with [[central symmetry]].

See [[#Relation with spherical polyhedra|relation with spherical polyhedra]] below on how the tetrahedron is treated.\n\n=== Hemipolyhedra ===\n[[File:Tetrahemihexahedron.png|thumb|The [[tetrahemihexahedron]] is a projective polyhedron, and the only uniform projective polyhedron that [[immersion (mathematics)|immerses]] in Euclidean 3-space.]]\n{{see|Hemipolyhedron}}\nNote that the prefix \"hemi-\" is also used to refer to [[hemipolyhedra]], which are [[uniform polyhedra]] having some faces that pass through the center of symmetry. As these do not define spherical polyhedra (because they pass through the center, which does not map to a defined point on the sphere), they do not define projective polyhedra by the quotient map from 3-space (minus the origin) to the projective plane.\n\nOf these uniform hemipolyhedra, only the [[tetrahemihexahedron]] is topologically a projective polyhedron, as can be verified by its [[Euler characteristic]] and visually obvious connection to the [[Roman surface]]. It is 2-covered by the [[cuboctahedron]], and can be realized as the quotient of the spherical cuboctahedron by the antipodal map. It is the only uniform (traditional) polyhedron that is projective – that is, the only uniform projective polyhedron that [[immersion (mathematics)|immerses]] in Euclidean three-space as a uniform traditional polyhedron.\n\n== Relation with spherical polyhedra ==\nThere is a 2-to-1 [[covering map]] <math>S^2 \\to \\mathbf{RP}^2</math> of the sphere to the projective plane, and under this map, projective polyhedra correspond to spherical polyhedra with [[central symmetry]] – the 2-fold cover of a projective polyhedron is a centrally symmetric spherical polyhedron. Further, because a [[covering map]] is a [[local homeomorphism]] (in this case a [[local isometry]]), both the spherical and the corresponding projective polyhedra have the same [[abstract vertex figure]].\n\nFor example, the 2-fold cover of the (projective) [[hemicube (geometry)|hemi-cube]] is the (spherical) cube. The hemi-cube has 4 vertices, 3 faces, and 6 edges, each of which is covered by 2 copies in the sphere, and accordingly the cube has 8 vertices, 6 faces, and 12 edges, while both these polyhedra have a 4.4.4 vertex figure (3 squares meeting at a vertex).\n\nFurther, the [[#Symmetry group|symmetry group]] (of [[isometries]]) of a projective polyhedron and covering spherical polyhedron are related: the symmetries of the projective polyhedron are naturally identified with the ''rotation'' symmetries of the spherical polyhedron, while the full symmetry group of the spherical polyhedron is the product of its rotation group (the symmetry group of the projective polyhedron) and the cyclic group of order 2, {±''I''}. See [[#Symmetry group|symmetry group]] below for elaboration and other dimensions.\n\nSpherical polyhedra without central symmetry do not define a projective polyhedron, as the images of vertices, edges, and faces will overlap. In the language of tilings, the image in the projective plane is a degree 2 tiling, meaning that it covers the projective plane twice – rather than 2 faces in the sphere corresponding to 1 face in the projective plane, covering it twice, each face in the sphere corresponds to a single face in the projective plane, accordingly covering it twice.\n\nThe correspondence between projective polyhedra and centrally symmetric spherical polyhedra can be extended to a [[Galois connection]] including all spherical polyhedra (not necessarily centrally symmetric) if the classes are extended to include degree 2 tilings of the projective plane, whose covers are not polyhedra but rather the [[polyhedral compound]] of a non-centrally symmetric polyhedron, together with its central inverse (a compound of 2 polyhedra). This geometrizes the Galois connection at the level of finite subgroups of O(3) and PO(3), under which the adjunction is \"union with central inverse\". For example, the tetrahedron is not centrally symmetric, and has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces, and vertex figure 3.3.3 (3 triangles meeting at each vertex). Its image in the projective plane has 4 vertices, 6 edges (which intersect), and 4 faces (which overlap), covering the projective plane twice. The cover of this is the [[stellated octahedron]] – equivalently, the compound of two tetrahedra – which has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, and vertex figure 3.3.3.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nIn the context of [[abstract polytope]]s, one instead refers to \"''locally'' projective polytopes\" – see [[Abstract polytope#Local topology|Abstract polytope: Local topology]]. For example, the [[11-cell]] is a \"locally projective polytope\", but is not a globally projective polyhedron, nor indeed tessellates ''any'' manifold, as it not locally Euclidean, but rather locally projective, as the name indicates.\n\nProjective polytopes can be defined in higher dimension as tessellations of projective space in one less dimension. Defining ''k''-dimensional projective polytopes in ''n''-dimensional projective space is somewhat trickier, because the usual definition of polytopes in Euclidean space requires taking [[convex combination]]s of points, which is not a projective concept, and is infrequently addressed in the literature, but has been defined, such as in {{Harv|Vives|Mayo|1991}}.\n\n== Symmetry group ==\nThe symmetry group of a projective polytope is a finite (hence discrete)<ref group=\"note\">Since PO is [[compact space|compact]], finite and discrete sets are identical – infinite sets have an [[accumulation point]].</ref> subgroup of the [[projective orthogonal group]], PO, and conversely every finite subgroup of PO is the symmetry group of a projective polytope by taking the polytope given by images of a [[fundamental domain]] for the group.\n\nThe relevant dimensions are as follows: ''n''-dimensional real projective space is the projectivization of (''n''+1)-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], <math>\\mathbf{RP}^n = \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{R}^{n+1}),</math> so the projective orthogonal group of an ''n''-dimensional projective space is denoted\n:PO(''n''+1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;P(O(''n''+1))&nbsp;=&nbsp;O(''n''+1)/{±''I''}.\n\nIf ''n''=2''k'' is even (so ''n''+1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''k''+1 is odd), then O(2''k''+1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;SO(2''k''+1)&times;{±''I''} decomposes as a product, and thus <math>PO(2k+1) = PSO(2k+1) \\cong SO(2k+1)</math><ref group=\"note\">The [[isomorphism]]/equality distinction in this equation is because the context is the 2-to-1 quotient map <math>O \\to PO</math> – PSO(2''k''+1) and PO(2''k''+1) are equal subsets of the target (namely, the whole space), hence the equality, while the induced map <math>SO \\to PSO</math> is an isomorphism but the two groups are subsets of different spaces, hence the isomorphism rather than an equality.\n\nSee {{Harv | Conway | Smith | 2003 | loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=E_HCwwxMbfMC&pg=PA34 p. 34]}} for an example of this distinction being made.</ref> so the group of projective isometries can be identified with the group of rotational isometries.\n\nThus in particular the symmetry group of a projective polyhedron is the ''rotational'' symmetry group of the covering spherical polyhedron; the full symmetry group of the spherical polyhedron is then just the direct product with [[reflection through the origin]], which is the kernel on passage to projective space. The projective plane is non-orientable, and thus there is no distinct notion of \"orientation-preserving isometries of a projective polyhedron\", which is reflected in the equality PSO(3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;PO(3).\n\nIf ''n''=2''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is odd, then O(''n''+1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;O(2''k''+2) does not decompose as a product, and thus the symmetry group of the projective polytope is not simply the rotational symmetries of the spherical polytope, but rather a 2-to-1 quotient of the full symmetry group of the corresponding spherical polytope (the spherical group is a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of the projective group). Further, in odd projective dimension (even vector dimension) <math>PSO(2k) \\neq PO(2k)</math> and is instead a proper (index 2) subgroup, so there is a distinct notion of orientation-preserving isometries.\n\nFor example, in ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 (polygons), the symmetries of a 2''r''-gon is the [[dihedral group]] Dih<sub>2''r''</sub> (of order 4''r''), with rotational group the cyclic group ''C''<sub>2''r''</sub>, these being subgroups of O(2) and SO(2), respectively. The projectivization of a 2''r''-gon (in the circle) is an ''r''-gon (in the projective line), and accordingly the quotient groups, subgroups of PO(2) and PSO(2) are Dih<sub>''r''</sub> and ''C''<sub>''r''</sub>. Note that the same [[commutative square]] of subgroups occurs for the square of [[Spin group]] and [[Pin group]] – Spin(2), Pin<sub>+</sub>(2), SO(2), O(2) –  here going up to a 2-fold cover, rather than down to a 2-fold quotient.\n\nLastly, by the [[lattice theorem]] there is a [[Galois connection]] between subgroups of O(''n'') and subgroups of PO(''n''), in particular of finite subgroups. Under this connection, symmetry groups of centrally symmetric polytopes correspond to symmetry groups of the corresponding projective polytope, while symmetry groups of spherical polytopes without central symmetry correspond to symmetry groups of degree 2 projective polytopes (tilings that cover projective space twice), whose cover (corresponding to the adjunction of the connection) is a compound of two polytopes – the original polytope and its central inverse.\n\nThese symmetry groups should be compared and contrasted with [[binary polyhedral group]]s – just as Pin<sub>±</sub>(''n'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;O(''n'') is a 2-to-1 cover, and hence there is a Galois connection between binary polyhedral groups and polyhedral groups, O(''n'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;PO(''n'') is a 2-to-1-cover, and hence has an analogous Galois connection between subgroups. However, while discrete subgroups of O(''n'') and PO(''n'') correspond to symmetry groups of spherical and projective polytopes, corresponding geometrically to the covering map <math>S^n \\to \\mathbf{RP}^n,</math> there is no covering space of <math>S^n</math> (for <math>n \\geq 2</math>) as the sphere is [[simply connected]], and thus there is no corresponding \"binary polytope\" for which subgroups of Pin are symmetry groups.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Spherical polyhedron]]\n*[[Toroidal polyhedron]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist | group = note}}\n\n== References ==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n| volume = 59\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 122–131\n| last1 = Archdeacon\n| first1 = Dan\n| first2 = Seiya | last2 = Negami\n| title = The construction of self-dual projective polyhedra\n| journal = J.

It is also a [[Johnson solid]] (J<sub>37</sub>) and can also be called the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]]. Its dual is the [[pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron]]. As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a [[square gyrobicupola]] (''J''<sub>29</sub>) and inserting an [[octagon]]al [[prism (geometry)|prism]] between its two halves. The resulting solid is locally vertex-regular &mdash; the arrangement of the four faces incident on any vertex is the same for all vertices; this is unique among the Johnson solids. However, it is not [[vertex-transitive]], and consequently not one of the [[Archimedean solid]]s, as there are pairs of vertices such that there is no isometry of the solid which maps one into the other. Essentially, the two types of vertices can be distinguished by their \"neighbors of neighbors.\" Another way to see that the polyhedron is not vertex-regular is to note that there is exactly one belt of eight squares around its equator, which distinguishes vertices on the belt from vertices on either side.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[Image:Small rhombicuboctahedron.png|120px]]<BR>Rhombicuboctahedron\n|[[Image:Exploded rhombicuboctahedron.png|120px]]<BR>Exploded sections\n|[[Image:Pseudorhombicuboctahedron.png|120px]]<BR>Pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron\n|}\n\nThe solid can also be seen as the result of twisting one of the [[square cupola]]e (''J''<sub>4</sub>) on a [[rhombicuboctahedron]] (one of the [[Archimedean solid]]s; a.k.a. the elongated square orthobicupola) by 45&nbsp;degrees.

      "text": "{{other uses|Honeycomb (disambiguation)}}\n[[Image:cubic honeycomb.png|thumb|150px|[[cubic honeycomb]]]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''honeycomb''' is a ''space filling'' or ''[[close packing]]'' of [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] or higher-dimensional ''cells'', so that there are no gaps. It is an example of the more general mathematical ''tiling'' or ''[[tessellation]]'' in any number of dimensions. Its dimension can be clarified as ''n''-honeycomb for a honeycomb of ''n''-dimensional space.\n\nHoneycombs are usually constructed in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] (\"flat\") space. They may also be constructed in [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean spaces]], such as [[#Hyperbolic honeycombs|hyperbolic honeycombs]].  Any finite [[uniform polytope]] can be projected to its [[circumsphere]] to form a uniform honeycomb in spherical space.\n\n[[Image:Wallpaper group-cmm-1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|It is possible to fill the plane with [[polygon]]s which do not meet at their corners, for example using [[rectangle]]s, as in a [[brick]] wall pattern: this is not a proper tiling because corners lie part way along the edge of a neighbouring polygon. Similarly, in a proper honeycomb, there must be no edges or vertices lying part way along the face of a neighbouring cell. Interpreting each brick face as a [[hexagon]] having two interior angles of 180 degrees allows the pattern to be considered as a proper tiling. However, not all geometers accept such hexagons.]]\n\n==Classification==\nThere are infinitely many honeycombs, which have only been partially classified. The more regular ones have attracted the most interest, while a rich and varied assortment of others continue to be discovered.\n\nThe simplest honeycombs to build are formed from stacked layers or ''slabs'' of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] based on some [[tessellation]]s of the plane. In particular, for every [[parallelepiped]], copies can fill space, with the [[cubic honeycomb]] being special because it is the only ''regular'' honeycomb in ordinary (Euclidean) space.  Another interesting family is the [[Hill tetrahedron|Hill tetrahedra]] and their generalizations, which can also tile the space.\n\n===Uniform 3-honeycombs===\nA 3-dimensional '''uniform honeycomb''' is a honeycomb in [[Three-dimensional space|3-space]] composed of [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] [[Cell (geometry)|cells]], and having all vertices the same (i.e., the group of [isometries of 3-space that preserve the tiling] is ''[[vertex-transitive|transitive on vertices]]''). There are 28 [[Convex polytope|convex]] examples in Euclidean 3-space,<ref>Grünbaum (1994). \"Uniform tilings of 3-space\". ''Geombinatorics'' 4(2)</ref> also called the '''[[convex uniform honeycomb|Archimedean honeycombs]]'''.\n\nA honeycomb is called '''regular''' if the group of isometries preserving the tiling acts transitively on flags, where a '''flag''' is a vertex lying on an edge lying on a face lying on a cell.  Every regular honeycomb is automatically uniform.  However, there is just one regular honeycomb in Euclidean 3-space, the [[cubic honeycomb]]. Two are ''quasiregular'' (made from two types of regular cells):\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!Type\n![[Regular cubic honeycomb]]\n!Quasiregular honeycombs\n|-\n!Cells\n![[Cube|Cubic]]\n![[Octahedron|Octahedra]] and [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]]\n|-\n!Slab layer\n|[[File:Cubic semicheck.png|240px]]\n|[[File:Tetroctahedric semicheck.png|240px]]\n|}\nThe [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]] and [[gyrated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]]s are generated by 3 or 2 positions of slab layer of cells, each alternating tetrahedra and octahedra. An infinite number of unique honeycombs can be created by higher order of patterns of repeating these slab layers.\n\n===Space-filling polyhedra===\n{{See also|Stereohedron|Plesiohedron|Parallelohedron}}\nA honeycomb having all cells identical within its symmetries is said to be '''[[cell-transitive]]''' or '''isochoric'''.

The gyrobifastigium is first in a series of [[gyrobicupola]], so this solid can also be called an ''elongated digonal gyrobicupola''. Geometrically it can also be constructed as the dual of a digonal [[gyrobianticupola]]. This construction is space-filling.\n\nThe second name, ''gabled [[rhombohedron]]'', is from Michael Goldberg's paper on space-filling octahedra, model 8-VI, the 6th of at least 49 space-filling octahedra.<ref>Goldberg, Michael, ''On the space-filling octahedra'', Geometriae Dedicata, January 1981, Volume 10, Issue 1, pp 323–335 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01447431] [http://documents.mx/documents/on-the-space-filling-octahedra.html PDF]</ref> A [[gable]] is the triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches.\n\nThe highest symmetry forms are D<sub>2d</sub>, order 8, while if the underlying [[rectangular cuboid]] is distorted into a [[rhombohedron]], the symmetry is reduced to 2-fold rotational symmetry, C<sub>2</sub>, order 2.\n\nIt has all 3-valence vertices and its [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] has all triangular faces, including the [[snub disphenoid]] as a [[deltahedron]] with all equilateral triangles.<ref>[http://www.software3d.com/J84Dual.php Dual of Snub Disphenoid (J84)]</ref> However the dual of the [[snub disphenoid]] is not space-filling because the pentagons are not right-angled.\n\n== Variations ==\nA topologically distinct ''[[Johnson_solid#Elongated bicupolae|elongated gyrobifastigium]]'' has square and equilateral triangle faces, seen as 2 [[triangular prism]]s augmented to a central [[cube]].

Although it is convex, it is not a [[Johnson solid]] because its faces are not composed entirely of regular polygons. Michael Goldberg references it by the [[playing card]] name, ''ten-of-diamonds'', as a 10-faced polyhedron with two opposite [[rhombus|rhombic]] (diamond-shaped) faces. He catalogued it in a 1982 paper as 10-II, the second in a list of 26 known space-filling decahedra.<ref>Goldberg, Michael. ''On the Space-filling Decahedra''. Structural Topology, 1982, num.

It can be seen as a [[triakis tetrahedron]], with two pairs of coplanar triangles merged into rhombic faces. The dual is similar to a [[truncated tetrahedron]], except two edges from the original tetrahedron are reduced to zero length making pentagonal faces. The dual polyhedra can be called a skew-truncated tetragonal disphenoid, where 2 edges along the symmetry axis completely truncated down to the edge midpoint.\n{| class=wikitable width=400\n|+ Symmetric projection\n|-\n!colspan=2|Ten of diamonds\n!Related\n!colspan=2|Dual\n!Related\n|- align=center valign=top\n|[[File:Ten-of-diamonds_decahedron_solid.png|120px]]<BR>Solid faces\n|[[File:Ten-of-diamonds_decahedron_frame.png|120px]]<BR>Edges\n|[[File:Dual tetrahedron t01.png|120px]]<BR>[[triakis tetrahedron]]\n|[[File:Dual-ten-of-diamonds-solid.png|120px]]<BR>Solid faces\n|[[File:Dual-ten-of-diamonds-frame.png|120px]]<BR>Edges\n|[[File:3-simplex t01.svg|120px]]<BR>[[Truncated tetrahedron]]\n|- align=center\n|colspan=2|v=8, e=16, f=10\n|v=8, e=18, f=12\n|colspan=2|v=10, e=16, f=8\n|v=12, e=18, f=8\n|}\n\n== Honeycomb==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" width=\"240\"\n!bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2|Ten-of-diamonds honeycomb\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Schläfli symbol]]||dht<sub>1,2</sub>{4,3,4}\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram|Coxeter diagram]]||{{CDD||node|4|node_fh|3|node_fh|4|node}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Cell type||Ten-of-diamonds<BR>[[File:Ten-of-diamonds decahedron skew.png|60px]]\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Space group|Space]]<BR>[[Fibrifold notation|Fibrifold]]<BR>[[Coxeter notation#Space groups|Coxeter]]||[[Cubic crystal system|I{{overline|3}} (204)]]<BR>8<sup>−o</sup><BR><nowiki>[[</nowiki>4,3<sup>+</sup>,4]]\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Dual||[[Alternated bitruncated cubic honeycomb]]\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Properties||Cell-transitive\n|}\nThe ''ten-of-diamonds'' is used in the honeycomb with [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node|4|node_fh|3|node_fh|4|node}}, being the dual of an [[alternated bitruncated cubic honeycomb]], {{CDD|node|4|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}}.

It has ''D''<sub>''3h''</sub> symmetry.\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThis polyhedron could be constructed by taking a tall uniform [[hexagonal prism]], and making 3 angled cuts on the top and bottom. The trapezoids represent what remains of the original prism sides, and the 6 rhombi a result of the top and bottom cuts.\n\n== Space-filling tessellation ==\nA [[Honeycomb (geometry)|space-filling tessellation]], the [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]], can be made by translated copies of this cell.

      "text": "{{Semireg polyhedra db|Semireg polyhedron stat table|tO}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''truncated octahedron''' is an [[Archimedean solid]]. It has 14 faces (8 regular [[hexagon]]al and 6 [[Square (geometry)|square]]), 36 edges, and 24 vertices. Since each of its faces has [[point symmetry]] the truncated octahedron is a [[zonohedron]]. It is also the [[Goldberg polyhedron]] G<sub>IV</sub>(1,1), containing square and hexagonal faces. Like the cube, it can tessellate (or \"pack\") 3-dimensional space, as a [[permutohedron]].\n\nIts [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[tetrakis hexahedron]].\n\nIf the original truncated octahedron has unit edge length, its dual [[tetrakis cube]] has edge lengths {{sfrac|9|8}}{{sqrt|2}} and {{sfrac|3|2}}{{sqrt|2}}.\n\n==Construction==\n{| align=center\n|[[image:Truncated Octahedron with Construction.svg]]\n|width=50px|&nbsp;\n|[[image:Square Pyramid.svg]]\n|}\n\nA truncated octahedron is constructed from a regular [[octahedron]] with side length 3''a'' by the removal of six right [[square pyramid]]s, one from each point. These pyramids have both base side length (''a'') and lateral side length (''e'') of ''a'', to form [[equilateral triangle]]s. The base area is then ''a''<sup>2</sup>. Note that this shape is exactly similar to half an octahedron or [[Johnson solid]] J<sub>1</sub>.\n\nFrom the properties of square pyramids, we can now find the slant height, ''s'', and the height, ''h'', of the pyramid:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nh &= \\sqrt{e^2 - \\tfrac{1}{2}a^2} &&= \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}a \\\\\ns &= \\sqrt{h^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}a^2} &&= \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}a^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}a^2} &&= \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe volume, ''V'', of the pyramid is given by:\n:<math>V = \\tfrac{1}{3}a^2h = \\tfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{6}a^3</math>\n\nBecause six pyramids are removed by truncation, there is a total lost volume of {{sqrt|2}}''a''<sup>3</sup>.\n\n==Orthogonal projections==\nThe ''truncated octahedron'' has five special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: Hexagon, and square.

C. Escher]] ]]\n\nA '''tessellation''' of a flat surface is the tiling of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] using one or more [[geometric shape]]s, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [[mathematics]], tessellations can be generalized to [[high-dimensional spaces|higher dimensions]] and a variety of geometries.\n\nA periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|regular tilings]] with [[regular polygon]]al tiles all of the same shape, and [[semiregular tiling]]s with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 [[wallpaper groups]]. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called \"non-periodic\". An [[aperiodic tiling]] uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] is also called a ''tessellation of space''.\n\nA real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as [[cement]]ed [[ceramic]] squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative [[patterns]], or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant [[pavement (architecture)|pavement]], floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in [[Ancient Rome]] and in [[Islamic art]] such as in the [[Islamic geometric patterns|decorative geometric tiling]] of the [[Alhambra]] palace. In the twentieth century, the work of [[M. C. Escher]] often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]] and in [[hyperbolic geometry]], for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in [[quilting]]. Tessellations form a class of [[patterns in nature]], for example in the arrays of [[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal cells]] found in [[honeycomb]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stone-Cone Temple mosaics, Pergamon Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A temple mosaic from the ancient Sumerian city of [[Uruk]] IV (3400–3100 BC), showing a tessellation pattern in coloured tiles]]\n\nTessellations were used by the [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Sumerians]] (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.<ref name=\"Pickover2009\">{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |year=2009 |publisher=[[Sterling Publishing|Sterling]] |isbn=9781402757969 |page=372}}</ref>\n\nDecorative [[mosaic]] tilings made of small squared blocks called [[tessera]]e were widely employed in [[classical antiquity]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dunbabin | first1=Katherine M.

These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Conway, R. |author2=Burgiel, H. |author3=Goodman-Strauss, G. | title=The Symmetries of Things | publisher=Peters | date=2008}}</ref> The tessellations created by [[Bond (brick)|bonded brickwork]] do not obey this rule.

These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes.{{efn|The tiles are usually required to be [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[closed disk]], which means bizarre shapes with holes, dangling line segments or infinite areas are excluded.{{sfn|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=59}}}} Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of [[prototile]]s in which all tiles in the tessellation are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to ''tessellate'' or to ''tile the plane''. The [[Conway criterion]] is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Will It Tile?

These are the analogues to polygons and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the [[Schläfli symbol]] notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWvXsVInpgMC&lpg=PP1 | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] | author=Coxeter, H.

A ''[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]'' is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an ''isogonal'' or [[vertex-transitive]] tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of [[polygon]]s about each vertex is the same.{{sfn|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=59}} The [[fundamental domain|fundamental region]] is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation.<ref name=\"EmmerSchattschneider2007\">{{cite book |last1=Emmer |first1=Michele |last2=Schattschneider |first2=Doris |title=M.C.

Try the Conway Criterion!'' by Doris Schattschneider Mathematics Magazine Vol. 53, No. 4 (Sep., 1980), pp. 224-233</ref>   The tile must be a [[Topological disc#Topological balls|closed topological disk]]  with six consecutive points A, B, C, D, E, and F on the boundary such that: \n* the boundary part from A to B is congruent by translation to the boundary part from E to D\n* each of the boundary parts BC, CD, EF, and FA is [[Centrosymmetry|centrosymmetric]]—that is, each one is congruent to itself when rotated by 180-degrees around its midpoint\n* some of the six points may coincide but at least three of them must be distinct.<ref>[http://grahamshawcross.com/2012/10/12/periodic-and-non-periodic-tiling/ Periodic Tiling:  Polygons in General]</ref>\n\nAny prototile satisfying Conway's criterion admits a [[periodic tiling]] of the plane—and does so using only translation and 180-degree rotations. The Conway criterion is a sufficient condition to prove that a prototile tiles the plane but not a necessary one; there are tiles that fail the criterion and still tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042704002195 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329–353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Isohedral tiling p6-7.png|thumb|A [[hexagonal tiling#Topologically identical tilings|hexagonal tiling]] with centrosymmetric hexagons]]\n[[File:Conway criterion false negative nonominoes.svg|thumb|The two nonominoes not satisfying the Conway criterion but able to tile the plane]]\nIn its simplest form the criterion states that any [[hexagon]] with a pair of opposite sides that are parallel and congruent will tessellate the plane by translation, called hexagonal [[parallelogon]]s.<ref>''Polyominoes: A Guide to Puzzles and Problems in Tiling'', by George Martin, Mathematical Association of America, Washington, DC, 1991, p. 152, {{ISBN|0883855011}}</ref>  But when some of the points coincide, the criterion can apply to other polygons and even to shapes with curved perimeters.<ref>[http://www.mathforamerica.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=11&name=DLFE-103.pdf The five types of Conway Criterion polygon tile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706175448/http://www.mathforamerica.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=11&name=DLFE-103.pdf |date=2012-07-06 }}, PDF file</ref>\n\nThe Conway criterion discriminates many shapes, especially [[polyforms]]: except the two tiling [[nonomino]]es on the right, all tiling [[polyomino]]s up to the nonominoes can form a patch of at least one tile which satisfies the criterion.<ref name=rhoads/> These figures also show that the criterion is a sufficient but not necessary condition for a prototile to tile the plane.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~guttmann@unimelb/articles/ch1ind.pdf History and introduction to polygon models, polyominoes and polyhedra, by Anthony J Guttmann]\n* G C Rhoads (2005) Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, V 174 p 329-353\n\n{{Tessellation}}\n\n[[Category:Tessellation]]"

      "text": "[[Image:TwoCells.png|thumb|A trivial example of a Corner-point grid with only two cells.]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''corner-point grid''' is a [[tessellation]] of a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] 3D volume where the base cell has 6 [[Face (geometry)|faces]] ([[hexahedron]]).\n\nA set of straight lines defined by their end points define the ''pillars'' of the corner-point grid. The pillars have a lexicographical ordering that determines neighbouring pillars. On each pillar, a constant number of nodes (corner-points) is defined. A corner-point cell is now the volume between 4 neighbouring pillars and two neighbouring points on each pillar. \n\nEach cell can be identified by integer coordinates <math>(i,j,k)</math>, where the <math>k</math> coordinate runs along the pillars, and <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> span each layer. The cells are ordered naturally, where the index <math>i</math> runs the fastest and <math>k</math> the slowest.\n\nData within the interior of such cells can be computed by [[trilinear interpolation]] from the boundary values at the 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces.\n\nIn the special case of all pillars being vertical, the top and bottom face of each corner-point cell are described by [[Bilinear interpolation|bilinear surfaces]] and the side faces are [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s.\n\nCorner-point grids are supported by most [[reservoir simulation]] software, and has become an industry standard.\n\n==Degeneracy==\n\nA main feature of the format is the ability to define [[erosion surface]]s in [[geological modelling]], effectively done by collapsing nodes along each pillar. This means that the corner-point cells degenerate and may have less than 6 faces.\n\nFor the corner-point grids non-neighboring connections are supported, meaning that grid cells that are not neighboring in ijk-space can be defined as neighboring. This feature allows for representation of faults with significant throw/displacement. Moreover, the neighboring grid cells do not need to have matching cell faces (just overlap).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Corner Point Grid.

This means that, for every pair of flags, there is a symmetry operation mapping the first flag to the second.

There are 20 2-uniform tilings, 61 3-uniform tilings, 151 4-uniform tilings, 332 5-uniform tilings and 673 6-uniform tilings.

For example, notice that the 2-uniform [[3-4-3-12 tiling|[3.12.12; 3.4.3.12]]] tiling has a square lattice, the 4(3-1)-uniform [343.12; (3.12<sup>2</sup>)3] tiling has a snub square lattice, and the 5(3-1-1)-uniform [334.12; 343.12; (3.12.12)3] tiling has an elongated triangular lattice. These higher-order uniform tilings use the same lattice but possess greater complexity. The fractalizing basis for theses tilings is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align:center;\"\n!\n!Triangle\n!Square\n!Hexagon\n!Dissected<BR>Dodecagon\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! valign=\"center\" |Shape\n|[[File:The Triangle.png|alt=|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:A Square Tile.png|alt=|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:A Hexagon Tile.png|center|frameless|120x120px]]\n|[[File:A Dissected Dodecagon.png|center|frameless|158x158px]]\n|-\n!Fractalizing\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Fractal Triangle.png|center|frameless|160x160px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Fractal Square.png|center|frameless|160x160px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Fractal Hexagon.png|center|frameless|180x180px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Fractal Dissected Dodecagon.png|center|frameless|200x200px]]\n|-\n!Fractalizing<BR>(Dual)\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Dual Fractal Triangle.png|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Dual Fractal Square.png|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Dual Fractal Hexagon.png|center|frameless|120x120px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Hexagonal Dual Fractal Dissected Dodecagon.png|center|frameless|158x158px]]\n|}\nThe side lengths are dilated by a factor of <math>2+\\sqrt{3}</math>.\n\nThis can similarly be done with the truncated trihexagonal tiling as a basis, with corresponding dilation of <math>3+\\sqrt{3}</math>.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align:center;\"\n!\n!Triangle\n!Square\n!Hexagon\n!Dissected<BR>Dodecagon\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! valign=\"center\" |Shape\n|[[File:The Triangle.png|alt=|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:A Square Tile.png|alt=|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:A Hexagon Tile.png|center|frameless|120x120px]]\n|[[File:A Dissected Dodecagon.png|center|frameless|158x158px]]\n|-\n!Fractalizing\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Fractal Triangle.png|center|frameless|143x143px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Fractal Square.png|center|frameless|143x143px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Fractal Hexagon.png|center|frameless|167x167px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Fractal Dissected Dodecagon.png|center|frameless|191x191px]]\n|-\n!Fractalizing<BR>(Dual)\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Dual Fractal Triangle.png|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Dual Fractal Square.png|center|frameless|80x80px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Dual Fractal Hexagon.png|center|frameless|120x120px]]\n|[[File:Truncated Trihexagonal Dual Fractal Dissected Dodecagon.png|center|frameless|158x158px]]\n|}\n\n==== Fractalizing Examples:  ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align:center;\"\n!\n!Truncated Hexagonal Tiling\n!Truncated Trihexagonal Tiling\n|-\n!Fractalizing\n|[[File:Planar Fractalizing Truncated Hexagonal Tiling II.png|alt=|center|frameless|400x400px]]\n|[[File:Planar Tiling Fractalizing the Truncated Trihexagonal Tiling.png|center|frameless|400x400px]]\n|-\n!Fractalizing<BR>(Dual)\n|[[File:Dual of Planar Fractalizing Truncated Hexagonal Tiling II.png|alt=|frameless|400x400px]]\n|[[File:Dual of Planar Tiling Fractalizing the Truncated Trihexagonal Tiling (Arms Variant).png|alt=|center|frameless|400x400px]]\n|}\n=== 2-uniform tilings ===\nThere are twenty (20) '''2-uniform tilings''' of the Euclidean plane.

The girih are piece-wise straight lines that cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile that are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.\n\n== Mathematics of girih tilings ==\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu|Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt|Paul J. Steinhardt]] suggested that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with [[self-similar]] [[fractal]] [[quasicrystalline]] tilings such as [[Penrose tiling]]s, predating them by five centuries.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peter J.

However, we have no indication of how much more the architects may have known about the mathematics involved. It is generally believed that such designs were constructed by drafting zigzag outlines with only a straightedge and a compass. Templates found on scrolls such as the 97-foot- (29.5 metres) long [[Topkapi Scroll]] may have been consulted. Found in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire and believed to date from the late 15th century, the scroll shows a succession of two- and three- dimensional geometric patterns. There is no text, but there is a grid pattern and color-coding used to highlight symmetries and distinguish three-dimensional projections. Drawings such as shown on this scroll would have served as pattern-books for the artisans who fabricated the tiles, and the shapes of the girih tiles dictated how they could be combined into large patterns. In this way, craftsmen could make highly complex designs without resorting to mathematics and without necessarily understanding their underlying principles.<ref name=\"Topkapi\">{{cite book | author = Gulru Necipoglu  | year = 1995 | title = The Topkapi Scroll: Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture | publisher = Getty Research Institute}}</ref>\n\nThis use of repeating patterns created from a limited number of geometric shapes available to craftsmen of the day is similar to the practice of contemporary European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artisans. Designers of both styles were concerned with using their inventories of geometrical shapes to create the maximum diversity of forms. This demanded a skill and practice very different from mathematics.<ref name=\"Topkapi\"/>\n\n=== Geometric construction of an interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design ===\nFirstly, divide the right angle A into five parts with same degree by creating four rays that start from A. Find an arbitrary point C on the second ray and drop perpendiculars from C to the sides of angle A counter-clockwise. This step creates the rectangle ABCD along with four segments that each has an endpoint at A and other endpoints are the intersections of the four rays with the two sides of BC and DC of rectangle ABCD. Then, find the midpoint of the fourth segment created from the fourth ray point E. Construct an arc with center A and radius AE to intersect AB at point F and the second ray at point G. The second segment is now a part of the rectangle's diagonal. Make a line, parallel to AD and passing through point G, that intersects the first ray at point H and the third ray at point I. The line HF passes through point E and intersects the third ray at L and line AD at J. Construct a line, passing through J which is parallel to the third ray. Also construct line EI and find M which is the intersection of this line with AD. From the point F make a parallel line to the third ray to meet the first ray at K. Construct segments GK, GL, and EM. Find the point N such that GI = IN by constructing a circle with center I and radius IG.

'''Heesch's problem''' is the problem of determining the set of numbers that can be Heesch numbers. Both are named for geometer [[Heinrich Heesch]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Heesch|1968}}, as cited by {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}} and {{harvtxt|Fontaine|1991}}.</ref> who found a tile with Heesch number 1 (the union of a square, equilateral triangle, and 30-60-90 right triangle)<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = The Heesch Tile: An Interesting Non-Tiler\n  | url = http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/heesch.htm\n  | last = Dutch | first = Steven\n  | publisher = Natural and Applied Sciences, [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]]\n  | accessdate = 2008-12-22\n  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825072326/http://www.uwgb.edu:80/dutchs/symmetry/heesch.htm|archivedate=2017-08-25\n  }}</ref> and proposed the more general problem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987| pages = 155–156|loc=Heesch's Problem}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a square may be surrounded by infinitely many layers of [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] squares in the [[square tiling]], while a circle cannot be surrounded by even a single layer of congruent circles without leaving some gaps. The Heesch number of the square is infinite and the Heesch number of the circle is zero.  In more complicated examples, such as the one shown in the illustration, a [[polygon]]al tile can be surrounded by several layers, but not by infinitely many; the maximum number of layers is the tile's Heesch number.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\n\nA [[tessellation]] of the plane is a partition of the plane into smaller regions called '''tiles'''.  The zeroth corona of a tile is defined as the tile itself, and for ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 the ''k''th corona is the set of tiles sharing a boundary point with the (''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)th corona. The '''Heesch number''' of a figure ''S'' is the maximum value ''k'' such that there exists a tiling of the plane, and tile ''t'' within that tiling, for which that all tiles in the zeroth through ''k''th coronas of ''t'' are congruent to ''S''. In some work on this problem this definition is modified to additionally require that the union of the zeroth through ''k''th coronas of ''t'' is a [[simply connected]] region.<ref name=\"mann\"/>\n\nIf there is no upper bound on the number of layers by which a tile may be surrounded, its Heesch number is said to be infinite. In this case, an argument based on [[Kőnig's lemma]] can be used to show that there exists a tessellation of the whole plane by congruent copies of the tile.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc= 3.8.1 The Extension Theorem| p=151}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Amman-Heesch-4.svg|thumb|240px|[[Robert Ammann|Ammann]]'s example of a polygon with Heesch number 4]]\n== Example ==\nConsider the non-convex polygon ''P'' shown in the figure to the right, which is formed from a regular hexagon by adding projections on two of its sides and matching indentations on three sides. The figure shows a tessellation consisting of 61 copies of ''P'', one large infinite region, and four small diamond-shaped polygons within the fourth layer. The first through fourth coronas of the central polygon consist entirely of congruent copies of ''P'', so its Heesch number is at least four. One cannot rearrange the copies of the polygon in this figure to avoid creating the small diamond-shaped polygons, because the 61 copies of ''P'' have too many indentations relative to the number of projections that could fill them. By formalizing this argument, one can prove that the Heesch number of ''P'' is exactly four. According to the modified definition that requires that coronas be simply connected, the Heesch number is three. This example was discovered by [[Robert Ammann]].<ref name=\"mann\"/>\n\n== Known results ==\nIt is unknown whether all positive integers can be Heesch numbers.

      "text": "'''Hilbert's eighteenth problem''' is one of the 23 [[Hilbert problems]] set out in a celebrated list compiled in 1900 by mathematician [[David Hilbert]].  It asks three separate questions about lattices and sphere packing in Euclidean space.{{sfn|Milnor|1976}}\n\n==Symmetry groups in <math>n</math> dimensions==\nThe first part of the problem asks whether there are only finitely many essentially different [[space group]]s in <math>n</math>-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  This was answered affirmatively by [[Ludwig Bieberbach|Bieberbach]].\n\n==Anisohedral tiling in 3 dimensions==\nThe second part of the problem asks whether there exists a [[polyhedron]] which [[tessellation of space|tiles]] 3-dimensional Euclidean space but is not the [[fundamental region]] of any space group; that is, which tiles but does not admit an isohedral (tile-[[Group action (mathematics)|transitive]]) tiling.  Such tiles are now known as [[anisohedral tiling|anisohedral]].  In asking the problem in three dimensions, Hilbert was probably assuming that no such tile exists in two dimensions; this assumption later turned out to be incorrect.\n\nThe first such tile in three dimensions was found by [[Karl Reinhardt (mathematician)|Karl Reinhardt]] in 1928.  The first example in two dimensions was found by [[Heinrich Heesch|Heesch]] in 1935.{{sfn|Edwards|2003}} The related [[einstein problem]]<!-- Note: do not capitalize einstein. The name of this problem is a pun on \"one stone\" and Einstein's name. --> asks for a shape that can tile space but not with an [[infinite cyclic group]] of symmetries.\n\n==Sphere packing==\nThe third part of the problem asks for the densest [[sphere packing]] or packing of other specified shapes.  Although it expressly includes shapes other than spheres, it is generally taken as equivalent to the [[Kepler conjecture]].\n\nIn 1998 American mathematician [[Thomas Callister Hales]] gave a [[computer-aided proof]] of the Kepler conjecture.

These freedoms include variations of [[internal angle]]s and edge lengths. In the limit, edges may have lengths that approach zero or angles that approach 180°. Types 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 13 allow parametric possibilities with nonconvex prototiles.\n\nPeriodic tilings are characterised by their [[wallpaper group]] symmetry, for example [[Wallpaper group#Group p2 (2222)|p2 (2222)]] is defined by four 2-fold gyration points. This nomenclature is used in the diagrams below, where the tiles are also colored by their [[isohedral#K-isohedral|''k''-isohedral]] positions within the symmetry.\n\nA ''[[primitive unit]]'' is a section of the tiling that generates the whole tiling using only translations, and is as small as possible.\n\n=== Reinhardt (1918) ===\n\n{{harvtxt|Reinhardt|1918}} found the first five types of pentagonal tile. All five can create [[isohedral]] tilings, meaning that the symmetries of the tiling can take any tile to any other tile (more formally, the [[automorphism group]] [[Group action (mathematics)|acts transitively]] on the tiles).\n\nB. Grünbaum and G. C. Shephard have shown that there are exactly twenty-four distinct \"types\" of isohedral tilings of the plane by pentagons according to their classification scheme.{{sfn|Grünbaum; Shephard|1978}} All use Reinhardt's tiles, usually with additional conditions necessary for the tiling. There are two tilings by all type 2 tiles, and one by all of each of the other four types. Fifteen of the other eighteen tilings are by special cases of type 1 tiles. Nine of the twenty-four tilings are edge-to-edge.{{sfn|Schattschneider|1978}}\n\nThere are also 2-isohedral tilings by special cases of type 1, type 2, and type 4 tiles, and 3-isohedral tilings, all edge-to-edge, by special cases of type 1 tiles.

As demonstrated graphically below, some types of hexagons can be subdivided into pentagons. For example, a regular hexagon bisects into two type 1 pentagons. Subdivision of convex hexagons is also possible with three (type 3), four (type 4) and nine (type 3) pentagons.\n\nBy extension of this relation, a plane can be tessellated by a single pentagonal prototile shape in ways that generate hexagonal overlays.

An example is the [[sphinx tiling]], an [[aperiodic tiling]] formed by a pentagonal [[rep-tile]].{{sfn|Godrèche|1989}} The sphinx may also tile the plane periodically, by fitting two sphinx tiles together to form a [[parallelogram]] and then tiling the plane by translates of this parallelogram,{{sfn|Godrèche|1989}} a pattern that can be extended to any non-convex pentagon that has two consecutive angles adding to 2{{pi}}, thus satisfying the condition(s) of convex [[#Type 1|Type 1]] above.\n\nIt is possible to divide an [[equilateral triangle]] into three congruent non-convex pentagons, meeting at the center of the triangle, and to tile the plane with the resulting three-pentagon unit.{{sfn|Gerver|2003}}\nA similar method can be used to subdivide [[square]]s into four congruent non-convex pentagons, or [[regular hexagon]]s into six congruent non-convex pentagons, and then tile the plane with the resulting unit.\n\n== Regular pentagonal tilings in non-Euclidean geometry ==\nA [[dodecahedron]] can be considered a regular tiling of 12 pentagons on the surface of a [[sphere]], with [[Schläfli symbol]] {5,3}, having three pentagons around each vertex.\n\nIn the [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]], there are tilings of regular pentagons, for instance [[order-4 pentagonal tiling]], {5,4}, having four pentagons around each vertex.

A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks [[translational symmetry]]. While crystals, according to the classical [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], can possess only two, three, four, and six-fold [[rotational symmetries]], the [[Bragg diffraction]] pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other [[symmetry]] orders, for instance five-fold.\n\n[[Aperiodic tiling]]s were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s, and, some twenty years later, they were found to apply to the study of natural quasicrystals. The discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a [[paradigm shift]] in the fields of [[crystallography]]. Quasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Steurer W.|journal= Z. Kristallogr. |volume=219 |year=2004|pages= 391–446|doi=10.1524/zkri.219.7.391.35643|title=Twenty years of structure research on quasicrystals. Part I. Pentagonal, octagonal, decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals|issue=7–2004|bibcode = 2004ZK....219..391S }}</ref> but, until the 1980s, they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter. In 2009, after a dedicated search, a mineralogical finding, [[icosahedrite]], offered evidence for the existence of natural quasicrystals.<ref name=r5/>\n\nRoughly, an ordering is non-periodic if it lacks [[translational symmetry]], which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original. The more precise mathematical definition is that there is never translational symmetry in more than ''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;1 [[linear independence|linearly independent]] directions, where ''n'' is the dimension of the space filled, e.g., the three-dimensional tiling displayed in a quasicrystal may have translational symmetry in two directions. Symmetrical diffraction patterns result from the existence of an indefinitely large number of elements with a regular spacing, a property loosely described as [[long-range order]]. Experimentally, the aperiodicity is revealed in the unusual symmetry of the diffraction pattern, that is, symmetry of orders other than two, three, four, or six. \nIn 1982 [[materials science|materials scientist]] [[Dan Shechtman]] observed that certain [[aluminium]]-[[manganese]] alloys produced the unusual diffractograms which today are seen as revelatory of quasicrystal structures. Due to fear of the scientific community's reaction, it took him two years to publish the results<ref name=bloomberg/><ref name=s/> for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.<ref name=nobel/>\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|thumb|A [[Penrose tiling]]]]\nIn 1961, [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] asked whether determining if a set of tiles admits a tiling of the plane is an [[algorithmically unsolvable problem]] or not. He conjectured that it is solvable, relying on the hypothesis that every set of tiles that can tile the plane can do it ''periodically'' (hence, it would suffice to try to tile bigger and bigger patterns until obtaining one that tiles periodically). Nevertheless, two years later, his student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] constructed a set of some 20,000 square tiles (now called [[Wang tiles]]) that can tile the plane but not in a periodic fashion. As further aperiodic sets of tiles were discovered, sets with fewer and fewer shapes were found. In 1976 [[Roger Penrose]] discovered a set of just two tiles, now referred to as [[Penrose tiling|Penrose tiles]], that produced only non-periodic tilings of the plane. These tilings displayed instances of fivefold symmetry. One year later [[Alan Lindsay Mackay|Alan Mackay]] showed experimentally that the diffraction pattern from the Penrose tiling had a two-dimensional [[Fourier transform]] consisting of sharp 'delta' peaks arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern.<ref name=r2/> Around the same time [[Robert Ammann]] created a set of aperiodic tiles that produced eightfold symmetry.\n\nMathematically, quasicrystals have been shown to be derivable from a general method that treats them as projections of a higher-dimensional lattice. Just as circles, ellipses, and hyperbolic curves in the plane can be obtained as [[conic section|section]]s from a three-dimensional double cone, so too various (aperiodic or periodic) arrangements in two and three dimensions can be obtained from postulated hyperlattices with four or more dimensions. Icosahedral quasicrystals in three dimensions were projected from a six-dimensional hypercubic lattice by [[Peter Kramer (physicist)|Peter Kramer]] and Roberto Neri in 1984.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108767384001203|title=On periodic and non-periodic space fillings of E<sup>m</sup> obtained by projection|year=1984|last1=Kramer|first1=P.|last2=Neri|first2=R.|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica A]] |volume=40|pages=580–587|issue=5}}</ref> The tiling is formed by two tiles with [[rhombohedral]] shape.\n\nShechtman first observed ten-fold [[electron diffraction]] patterns in 1982, as described in his notebook.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007225727/http://www.quasi.iastate.edu/discovery.html | title=QC Hot News}}</ref>  The observation was made during a routine investigation, by electron microscopy, of a rapidly cooled [[alloy of aluminium and manganese]] prepared at the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] (later NIST).\n\nIn the summer of the same year Shechtman visited Ilan Blech and related his observation to him. Blech responded that such diffractions had been seen before.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=C. Y.|journal=J. Cryst. Growth|year=1979|volume=47|pages=274–282|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(79)90252-5|title=Crystallography of decahedral and icosahedral particles|issue=2|bibcode = 1979JCrGr..47..274Y }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=C.

Shechtman quoted Cahn as saying: \"Danny, this material is telling us something and I challenge you to find out what it is\".\n\nThe observation of the ten-fold diffraction pattern lay unexplained for two years until the spring of 1984, when Blech asked Shechtman to show him his results again. A quick study of Shechtman's results showed that the common explanation for a ten-fold symmetrical diffraction pattern, the existence of twins, was ruled out by his experiments. Since periodicity and twins were ruled out, Blech, unaware of the two-dimensional tiling work, was looking for another possibility: a completely new structure containing cells connected to each other by defined angles and distances but without translational periodicity. Blech decided to use a computer simulation to calculate the diffraction intensity from a cluster of such a material without long-range translational order but still not random. He termed this new structure multiple [[polyhedral symmetry|polyhedral]].<!-- may be Polyhedral group? -->\n\nThe idea of a new structure was the necessary paradigm shift to break the impasse. The “Eureka moment” came when the computer simulation showed sharp ten-fold diffraction patterns, similar to the observed ones, emanating from the three-dimensional structure devoid of periodicity. The multiple polyhedral structure was termed later by many researchers as icosahedral glass but in effect it embraces ''any arrangement of polyhedra connected with definite angles and distances'' (this general definition includes tiling, for example).\n\nShechtman accepted Blech's discovery of a new type of material and it gave him the courage to publish his experimental observation.  Shechtman and Blech jointly wrote a paper entitled \"The Microstructure of Rapidly Solidified Al<sub>6</sub>Mn\" <ref name=\"first paper\">{{cite journal|last=Shechtman|first=Dan|author2=I. A. Blech |title=The Microstructure of Rapidly Solidified Al<sub>6</sub>Mn|journal=[[Metall Mater Trans A]]|year=1985|volume=16A|pages=1005–1012|doi=10.1007/BF02811670|issue=6|bibcode = 1985MTA....16.1005S }}</ref> and sent it for publication around June 1984 to the ''[[Journal of Applied Physics]]'' (JAP). The JAP editor promptly rejected the paper as being better fit for a metallurgical readership. As a result, the same paper was re-submitted for publication to the ''[[Metallurgical Transactions A]]'', where it was accepted. Although not noted in the body of the published text, the published paper was slightly revised prior to publication.\n\nMeanwhile, on seeing the draft of the Shechtman–Blech paper in the summer of 1984, John Cahn suggested that Shechtman's experimental results merit a fast publication in a more appropriate scientific journal. Shechtman agreed and, in hindsight, called this fast publication \"a winning move”. This paper, published in the ''Physical Review Letters'' (PRL),<ref name=\"s\" /> repeated Shechtman's observation and used the same illustrations as the original Shechtman–Blech paper in the ''Metallurgical Transactions A''.  The PRL paper,  the first to appear in print, caused considerable excitement in the scientific community.\n\nNext year Ishimasa ''et al.'' reported twelvefold symmetry in Ni-Cr particles.<ref name=r3/> Soon, eightfold diffraction patterns were recorded in V-Ni-Si and Cr-Ni-Si alloys.<ref name=r4/> Over the years, hundreds of quasicrystals with various compositions and different symmetries have been discovered. The first quasicrystalline materials were thermodynamically unstable—when heated, they formed regular crystals. However, in 1987, the first of many stable quasicrystals were discovered, making it possible to produce large samples for study and opening the door to potential applications. In 2009, following a 10-year systematic search, scientists reported the first natural quasicrystal, a mineral found in the [[Khatyrka]] River in eastern [[Russia]].<ref name=r5/> This natural quasicrystal exhibits high crystalline quality, equalling the best artificial examples.<ref name=j1/> The natural quasicrystal phase, with a composition of Al<sub>63</sub>Cu<sub>24</sub>Fe<sub>13</sub>, was named [[icosahedrite]] and it was approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] in 2010.

In his popular book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is life?]]'' in 1944, Schrödinger sought to explain how hereditary information is stored: molecules were deemed too small, amorphous solids were plainly chaotic, so it had to be a kind of crystal; as a periodic structure could encode very little information, it had to be aperiodic. [[DNA]] was later discovered, and, although not crystalline, it possesses properties predicted by Schrödinger—it is a regular but aperiodic molecule.</ref> Now, the symmetries compatible with translations are defined as \"crystallographic\", leaving room for other \"non-crystallographic\" symmetries. Therefore, aperiodic or [[quasiperiodic function|quasiperiodic]] structures can be divided into two main classes: those with crystallographic point-group symmetry, to which the incommensurately modulated structures and composite structures belong, and those with non-crystallographic point-group symmetry, to which quasicrystal structures belong.\n\nOriginally, the new form of matter was dubbed \"Shechtmanite\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Impossible' Form of Matter Takes Spotlight In Study of Solids|newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/05/science/impossible-form-of-matter-takes-spotlight-in-study-of-solids.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|date=1989-09-05}}</ref> The term \"quasicrystal\" was first used in print by [[Paul Steinhardt|Steinhardt]] and Levine<ref name=r9/> shortly after Shechtman's paper was published.\nThe adjective ''quasicrystalline'' had already been in use, but now it came to be applied to any pattern with unusual symmetry.<ref name=\"adj\" group=\"notes\"/> 'Quasiperiodical' structures were claimed to be observed in some decorative tilings devised by medieval Islamic architects.<ref name=r11/><ref name=Lu/> For example, [[Girih tiles]] in a medieval Islamic mosque in [[Isfahan]], Iran, are arranged in a two-dimensional quasicrystalline pattern.<ref name=r12/> These claims have, however, been under some debate.<ref name=\"Makovicky\"/>\n\nShechtman was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2011 for his work on quasicrystals. \"His discovery of quasicrystals revealed a new principle for packing of atoms and molecules,\" stated the Nobel Committee and pointed that \"this led to a paradigm shift within chemistry.\"<ref name=bloomberg>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/technion-s-shechtman-wins-chemistry-nobel-for-discovery-of-quasicrystals.html|title=Tecnion's Shechtman Wins Nobel in Chemistry for Quasicrystals Discovery|last=Gerlin|first=Andrea|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205014945/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/technion-s-shechtman-wins-chemistry-nobel-for-discovery-of-quasicrystals.html|archivedate=December 5, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15181187|title=Nobel win for crystal discovery|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2011-10-05|date=2011-10-05}}</ref> In 2014, Post of Israel issued a stamp dedicated to quasicrystals and the 2011 Nobel Prize.<ref>[https://www.iycr2014.org/countries/events-by-country/israel/iycr-philately-day Crystallography matters ... more!] iycr2014.org</ref>\n\nEarlier in 2009, it was found that thin-film quasicrystals can be formed by [[self-assembly]] of uniformly shaped, nano-sized molecular units at an air-liquid interface.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature08439|pmid=19829378|title=Quasicrystalline order in self-assembled binary nanoparticle superlattices|journal=Nature|volume=461|issue=7266|pages=964–967|year=2009|last1=Talapin|first1=Dmitri V.|last2=Shevchenko|first2=Elena V.|last3=Bodnarchuk|first3=Maryna I.|last4=Ye|first4=Xingchen|last5=Chen|first5=Jun|last6=Murray|first6=Christopher B.|bibcode=2009Natur.461..964T}}</ref> It was later demonstrated that those units can be not only inorganic, but also organic.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.aav0790 |title=Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule |journal=Science |volume=362 |issue=6421 |pages=1396–1400 |year=2018 |last1=Nagaoka |first1=Yasutaka |last2=Zhu |first2=Hua |last3=Eggert |first3=Dennis |last4=Chen |first4=Ou }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, chemists from Brown University announced the successful creation of a self-constructing lattice structure based on a strangely shaped quantum dot.

This is used to understand the aperiodic [[Icosahedron|icosahedral]] structure of quasicrystals.]]\nThere are several ways to mathematically define quasicrystalline patterns. One definition, the \"cut and project\" construction, is based on the work of [[Harald Bohr]] (mathematician brother of [[Niels Bohr]]). The concept of an almost periodic function (also called a quasiperiodic function) was studied by Bohr, including work of Bohl and Escanglon.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02395468|title=Zur Theorie fastperiodischer Funktionen I|year=1925|last1=Bohr|first1=H.|journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=45|page=580}}</ref>\nHe introduced the notion of a superspace. Bohr showed that quasiperiodic functions arise as restrictions of high-dimensional periodic functions to an irrational slice (an intersection with one or more [[hyperplane]]s), and discussed their Fourier point spectrum. These functions are not exactly periodic, but they are arbitrarily close in some sense, as well as being a projection of an exactly periodic function.\n\nIn order that the quasicrystal itself be aperiodic, this slice must avoid any [[lattice plane]] of the higher-dimensional lattice. [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] showed that [[Penrose tilings]] can be viewed as two-dimensional slices of five-dimensional [[hypercubic]] structures.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Algebraic theory of Penrose's non-periodic tilings of the plane|year=1981|last1=de Bruijn|first1=N.|journal=Nederl. Akad. Wetensch. Proc|volume=A84|page=39}}</ref> Equivalently, the [[Fourier transform]] of such a quasicrystal is nonzero only at a dense set of points [[linear span|spanned]] by integer multiples of a finite set of [[basis vectors]] (the projections of the primitive [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors of the higher-dimensional lattice).<ref name=Suck04/>\nThe intuitive considerations obtained from simple model aperiodic tilings are formally expressed in the concepts of [[Meyer set|Meyer]] and [[Delone set]]s. The mathematical counterpart of physical diffraction is the [[Fourier transform]] and the qualitative description of a diffraction picture as 'clear cut' or 'sharp' means that singularities are present in the Fourier [[spectrum]]. There are different methods to construct model quasicrystals. These are the same methods that produce aperiodic tilings with the additional constraint for the diffractive property. Thus, for a [[substitution tiling]] the [[eigenvalues]] of the substitution matrix should be [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number|Pisot numbers]]. The aperiodic structures obtained by the cut-and-project method are made diffractive by choosing a suitable orientation for the construction; this is a geometric approach that has also a great appeal for physicists.\n\nClassical theory of crystals reduces crystals to point lattices where each point is the center of mass of one of the identical units of the crystal. The structure of crystals can be analyzed by defining an associated [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Quasicrystals, on the other hand, are composed of more than one type of unit, so, instead of lattices, quasilattices must be used. Instead of groups, [[groupoids]], the mathematical generalization of groups in [[category theory]], is the appropriate tool for studying quasicrystals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paterson|first=Alan L.

Computer modeling, based on the existing theories of quasicrystals, however, greatly facilitated this task. Advanced programs have been developed<ref name=\"comp\"/> allowing one to construct, visualize and analyze quasicrystal structures and their diffraction patterns.\n\nStudy of quasicrystals may shed light on the most basic notions related to [[quantum critical point]] observed in [[heavy fermion]] metals.

Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminium alloys (Al-Li-Cu, Al-Mn-Si, Al-Ni-Co, Al-Pd-Mn, Al-Cu-Fe, Al-Cu-V, etc.), but numerous other compositions are also known (Cd-Yb, Ti-Zr-Ni, Zn-Mg-Ho, Zn-Mg-Sc, In-Ag-Yb, Pd-U-Si, etc.).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/69/2/R03|title=The role of aperiodic order in science and technology|year=2006|last1=MacIá|first1=Enrique|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=69|pages=397–441|bibcode = 2006RPPh...69..397M|issue=2 }}</ref>\n\nTwo types of quasicrystals are known.<ref name=\"comp\"/> The first type, polygonal (dihedral) quasicrystals, have an axis of 8, 10, or 12-fold local symmetry (octagonal, decagonal, or dodecagonal quasicrystals, respectively). They are periodic along this axis and quasiperiodic in planes normal to it. The second type, icosahedral quasicrystals, are aperiodic in all directions.\n\nQuasicrystals fall into three groups of different thermal stability:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/013008|pmc=5099795|title=Icosahedral clusters, icosaheral order and stability of quasicrystals—a view of metallurgy|year=2008|last1=Tsai|first1=An Pang|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|issue=1|page=013008|bibcode = 2008STAdM...9a3008T|pmid=27877926}}</ref>\n*Stable quasicrystals grown by slow cooling or [[casting (metalworking)|casting]] with subsequent [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]],\n*Metastable quasicrystals prepared by [[melt spinning]], and\n*Metastable quasicrystals formed by the [[crystallization]] of the [[amorphous]] phase.\n\nExcept for the Al–Li–Cu system, all the stable quasicrystals are almost free of defects and disorder, as evidenced by [[X-ray diffraction|X-ray]] and [[electron diffraction]] revealing peak widths as sharp as those of perfect crystals such as Si. Diffraction patterns exhibit fivefold, threefold, and twofold symmetries, and reflections are arranged quasiperiodically in three dimensions.\n\nThe origin of the stabilization mechanism is different for the stable and metastable quasicrystals. Nevertheless, there is a common feature observed in most quasicrystal-forming liquid alloys or their undercooled liquids: a local icosahedral order. The icosahedral order is in equilibrium in the ''liquid state'' for the stable quasicrystals, whereas the icosahedral order prevails in the ''undercooled liquid state'' for the metastable quasicrystals.\n\nA nanoscale icosahedral phase was formed in Zr-, Cu- and Hf-based bulk metallic glasses alloyed with noble metals.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.matsci.38.060407.130318| title = Formation and Properties of Quasicrystals| journal = Annual Review of Materials Research| volume = 38| pages = 403–423| year = 2008| last1 = Louzguine-Luzgin | first1 = D.

However, cooking with a lot of salt would etch the quasicrystalline coating used, and the pans were eventually withdrawn from production. Shechtman had one of these pans.<ref name=mitrev>{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/425729/the-quasicrystal-laureate/ |title=The Quasicrystal Laureate |newspaper=MIT Technology Review|date=12 October 2011  |author=Kalman, Matthew |accessdate= 12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Nobel citation said that quasicrystals, while brittle, could reinforce steel \"like armor\". When Shechtman was asked about potential applications of quasicrystals he said that a precipitation-hardened stainless steel is produced that is strengthened by small quasicrystalline particles. It does not corrode and is extremely strong, suitable for razor blades and surgery instruments. The small quasicrystalline particles impede the motion of dislocation in the material.<ref name=mitrev/>\n\nQuasicrystals were also being used to develop heat insulation, [[LED]]s, diesel engines, and new materials that convert heat to electricity. Shechtman suggested new applications taking advantage of the low coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials, for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong, hard-wearing, low-friction plastic gears. The low heat conductivity of some quasicrystals makes them good for heat insulating coatings.<ref name=mitrev/>\n\nOther potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion, broad-wavelength reflectors, and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility, low friction and corrosion resistance are required. Magnetron sputtering can be readily applied to other stable quasicrystalline alloys such as Al-Pd-Mn.<ref name=mrs/>\n\nWhile saying that the discovery of icosahedrite, the first quasicrystal found in nature, was important, Shechtman saw no practical applications.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Archimedean solid]]\n*[[Disordered hyperuniformity]]\n*[[Fibonacci quasicrystal]]\n*[[Phason]]\n*[[Tessellation]]\n*[[Time crystal]]\n*[[Icosahedral twins]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=notes|refs=\n\n<ref name=adj>The use of the adjective 'quasicrystalline' for qualifying a structure can be traced back to the mid-1940–50s, e.g. in {{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0095-8522(49)90032-X|title=Diffuse small-angle scattering of x-rays in colloid systems|year=1949|last1=Kratky|first1=O|last2=Porod|first2=G|journal=Journal of Colloid Science|volume=4|pages=35–70|pmid=18110601|issue=1 }}; {{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0095-8522(55)90081-7|title=The statistical electrification of aerosols by ionic diffusion|year=1955|last1=Gunn|first1=R|journal=Journal of Colloid Science|volume=10|pages=107–119}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Kleinert\">\n{{cite journal\n| title = Lattice Textures in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\n| author = [[Hagen Kleinert|Kleinert H.]] and Maki K.\n| journal = Fortschritte der Physik\n| volume = 29\n| issue = 5\n| pages = 219–259\n| year = 1981\n| doi = 10.1002/prop.19810290503\n| url = http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/75/75.pdf|bibcode = 1981ForPh..29..219K }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=r2>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(82)90359-4|title=Crystallography and the Penrose Pattern|year=1982|last1=Mackay|first1=A.L.|journal=Physica A|volume=114|issue=1|pages=609–613|bibcode = 1982PhyA..114..609M }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=r3>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.511|pmid=10032372|title=New ordered state between crystalline and amorphous in Ni-Cr particles|year=1985|last1=Ishimasa|first1=T.|last2=Nissen|first2=H.-U.|last3=Fukano|first3=Y.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=55|issue=5|pages=511–513|bibcode=1985PhRvL..55..511I}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=r4>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.1010|pmid=10035936|title=Two-dimensional quasicrystal with eightfold rotational symmetry|year=1987|last1=Wang|first1=N.|last2=Chen|first2=H.|last3=Kuo|first3=K.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=59|issue=9|pages=1010–1013|bibcode=1987PhRvL..59.1010W|url=http://repository.ust.hk/ir/bitstream/1783.1-50899/1/PhysRevLett.59.1010.pdf}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=r5>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1170827|pmid=19498165|title=Natural Quasicrystals|year=2009|last1=Bindi|first1=L.|last2=Steinhardt|first2=P.

By [[Pythagoras' theorem]], the [[hypotenuse]], or sloping side of the rep-5 triangle, has a length of {{radic|5}}.\n\nThe international standard [[ISO 216]] defines sizes of paper sheets using the {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}, in which the long side of a rectangular sheet of paper is the [[square root of two]] times the short side of the paper. Rectangles in this shape are rep-2. A rectangle (or parallelogram) is rep-''n'' if its [[aspect ratio]] is {{radic|''n''}}:1. An [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] right triangle is also rep-2.\n\n==Rep-tiles and symmetry==\n\nSome rep-tiles, like the [[square]] and [[equilateral triangle]], are [[symmetry|symmetrical]] and remain identical when [[mirror reflection|reflected in a mirror]]. Others, like the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]], are [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]] and exist in [[chirality|two distinct forms]] related by mirror-reflection. Dissection of the sphinx and some other asymmetric rep-tiles requires use of both the original shape and its mirror-image.\n\n==Rep-tiles and polyforms==\n\nSome rep-tiles are based on [[polyform]]s like [[polyiamond]]s and [[polyomino]]es, or shapes created by laying [[equilateral triangle]]s and [[square]]s edge-to-edge.\n\n===Squares===\n\nIf a polyomino is rectifiable, that is, able to tile a [[rectangle]], then it will also be a rep-tile, because the rectangle will then tile a [[square]]. This can be seen clearly in the [[octomino]]es, which are created from eight squares. Two copies of some octominoes will tile a square; therefore these octominoes are also rep-16 rep-tiles.\n\n[[File:Rep-tiles constructed from rectifiable octominoes.gif|thumb|350px|none|Rep-tiles based on rectifiable [[octomino]]es]]\n\nFour copies of some [[nonomino]]es and [[polyking|nonakings]] will tile a square, therefore these [[polyform]]s are also rep-36 rep-tiles.\n\n[[File:Nonominoes.gif|700px|thumb|none|Rep-tiles created from rectifiable [[nonomino]]es and [[polyking|9-polykings]] (nonakings)]]\n\n===Equilateral triangles===\n\nSimilarly, if a [[polyiamond]] tiles an equilateral triangle, it will also be a rep-tile.\n\n[[File:Equilateral triangle reptiles.gif|thumb|700px|none|Rep-tiles created from equilateral triangles]]\n\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:Equilateral triangle fish rep-tile.gif|thumb|285px|none|A fish-like rep-tile based on three equilateral triangles]]\n| [[File:Equilateral triangle rocket.gif|thumb|none|A rocket-like rep-tile created from a dodeciamond, or twelve equilateral triangles laid edge-to-edge (and corner-to-corner)]]\n|}\n\n===Right triangles===\n\nA [[right triangle]] is a triangle containing one right angle of 90°. Two particular forms of right triangle have attracted the attention of rep-tile researchers, the 45°-90°-45° triangle and the 30°-60°-90° triangle.\n\n====45°-90°-45° triangles====\n\nPolyforms based on [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] [[right triangle]]s, with sides in the ratio 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;:&nbsp;[[Square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]], are known as [[polyabolo]]s. An infinite number of them are rep-tiles. Indeed, the simplest of all rep-tiles is a single isosceles right triangle. It is rep-2 when divided by a single line bisecting the right angle to the [[hypotenuse]]. Rep-2 rep-tiles are also rep-2<sup>n</sup> and the rep-4,8,16+ triangles yield further rep-tiles. These are found by discarding half of the sub-copies and permutating the remainder until they are [[mirror image|mirror-symmetrical]] within a right triangle. In other words, two copies will tile a right triangle. One of these new rep-tiles is reminiscent of the fish formed from three [[equilateral triangle]]s.\n\n[[File:Rep-tiles based on right triangles.gif|thumb|none|600px|Rep-tiles based on right triangles]]\n\n[[File:Right triangle fish rep-tile.gif|thumb|220px|none|A fish-like rep-tile based on four isosceles right triangles]]\n\n====30°-60°-90° triangles====\n\nPolyforms based on 30°-60°-90° right triangles, with sides in the ratio 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;[[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]]&nbsp;:&nbsp;2, are known as [[polydrafter]]s.

In particular this is true for three [[trapezoid]]s including the one formed from three equilateral triangles, for three axis-parallel hexagons (the L-tromino, L-tetromino, and P-pentomino), and the sphinx hexiamond.{{sfnp|Niţică|2003}} In addition, many rep-tiles, particularly those with higher rep-''n'', can be self-tiled in different ways. For example, the rep-9 L-tetramino has at least fourteen different rep-tilings. The rep-9 sphinx hexiamond can also be tiled in different ways. \n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n[[File:L-tetrominoes rep9.gif|thumb|500px|Variant rep-tilings of the rep-9 L-tetromino]]\n|[[File:Sphinx rep9 various.gif|thumb|300px|Variant rep-tilings of the rep-9 sphinx hexiamond]]\n|}\n\n==Rep-tiles with infinite sides==\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n[[File:Horned triangle or teragonic triangle.gif|thumb|Horned triangle or teragonic triangle]]\n|} \n\nThe most familiar rep-tiles are polygons with a finite number of sides, but some shapes with an infinite number of sides can also be rep-tiles. For example, the [[teragon|teragonic]] triangle, or horned triangle, is rep-4. It is also an example of a [[#Fractals as rep-tiles|fractal rep-tile]].\n\n==Pentagonal rep-tiles==\n\nTriangular and quadrilateral (four-sided) rep-tiles are common, but pentagonal rep-tiles are rare. For a long time, the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]] was widely believed to be the only example known, but the [[Germany|German]]/[[New Zealand|New-Zealand]] mathematician [http://karlscherer.com Karl Scherer] and the American mathematician [[Sicherman dice|George Sicherman]] have found more examples, including a double-pyramid and an elongated version of the sphinx. These pentagonal rep-tiles are illustrated on the [http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/1002.html Math Magic] pages overseen by the American mathematician [[Friedman number|Erich Friedman]].<ref name=pentagonal>[http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/1002.html Math Magic, Problem of the Month (October 2002)]</ref> However, the sphinx and its extended versions are the only known pentagons that can be rep-tiled with equal copies.\nSee Clarke's [http://www.recmath.com/PolyPages/PolyPages/Reptiles.htm Reptile pages].\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:Scherer double-pyramid.gif|thumb|A pentagonal rep-tile discovered by Karl Scherer]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rep-tiles and fractals==\n\n===Rep-tiles as fractals===\n\nRep-tiles can be used to create [[fractal]]s, or shapes that are [[self-similarity|self-similar]] at smaller and smaller scales. A rep-tile fractal is formed by subdividing the rep-tile, removing one or more copies of the subdivided shape, and then continuing [[recursion|recursively]]. For instance, the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is formed in this way from a rep-tiling of a square into 27 smaller squares, and the [[Sierpinski triangle]] is formed  from a rep-tiling of an equilateral triangle into four smaller triangles. When one sub-copy is discarded, a rep-4 L-[[triomino]] can be used to create four fractals, two of which are identical except for [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]].\n{|\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:Geometrical dissection of an L-triomino (rep-4).gif|250px|thumb|left|Geometrical dissection of an L-triomino (rep-4)]] \n| [[File:A fractal based on an L-triomino (rep-4).gif|250px|thumb|right|A fractal based on an L-triomino (rep-4)]]\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:A fractal based on an L-triomino (rep-4)-2.gif|250px|thumb|left|Another fractal based on an L-triomino]] \n| [[File:A fractal based on an L-triomino (rep-4)-3.gif|250px|thumb|right|Another fractal based on an L-triomino]]\n|}\n\n===Fractals as rep-tiles===\n\nBecause [[fractal]]s are self-similar on smaller and smaller scales, many may be decomposed into copies of themselves like a rep-tile. However, if the fractal has an empty [[Interior (topology)|interior]], this decomposition may not lead to a tiling of the entire plane. For example, the [[Sierpinski triangle]] is rep-3, tiled with three copies of itself, and the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is rep-8, tiled with eight copies of itself, but repetition of these decompositions does not form a tiling. On the other hand, the [[dragon curve]] is a [[space-filling curve]] with a non-empty interior; it is rep-4, and does form a tiling. Similarly, the [[Gosper curve|Gosper island]] is rep-7, formed from the space-filling Gosper curve, and again forms a tiling.\n\nBy construction, any fractal defined by an [[iterated function system]] of n contracting maps of the same ratio is rep-n.\n{|\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:Sierpinski triangle tiling.gif|thumb|left|A Sierpinski triangle based on three smaller copies of a Sierpinski triangle]]\n| [[File:Sierpinski carpet tiling.gif|thumb|right|A Sierpinski carpet based on eight smaller copies of a Sierpinski carpet]]\n| [[File:Dragon tiling dragon.svg|thumb|right|A dragon curve based on 4 smaller copies of a dragon curve]]\n|}\n\n==Infinite tiling==\n\nAmong regular polygons, only the triangle and square can be dissected into smaller equally sized copies of themselves. However, a regular [[hexagon]] can be dissected into six equilateral triangles, each of which can be dissected into a regular hexagon and three more equilateral triangles. This is the basis for an infinite [[tessellation|tiling]] of the hexagon with hexagons. The hexagon is therefore an [[Infinity symbol|irrep-&infin;]] or irrep-infinity irreptile.\n\n[[File:Regular hexagon tiled with infinite copies of itself.gif|300px|thumb|none|Regular hexagon tiled with infinite copies of itself]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mosaic]]\n* [[Self-replication]]\n* [[Self-tiling tile set]]\n* [[Reptiles (M.

That is, the ''n'' shapes can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves, where the increase in scale is the same in each case. Figure 1 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 using distinctly shaped [[decominoes]]. The concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension. The name setisets was coined by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2012,<ref name=mathmag>{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] |date=December 2012 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=323–333 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.85.5.323}}</ref><ref name=erickson>[http://alejandroerickson.com/home/blog/blog.php?entry=15 Alejandro Erickson on Self-tiling tile sets]</ref> but the problem of finding such sets for ''n'' = 4 was asked decades previously by C.

Figure 2 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 which is ''imperfect'' because two of the component shapes are the same.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe shapes employed in a setiset need not be ''connected'' regions. Disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted. Such pieces are described as ''disconnected'', or ''weakly-connected'' (when islands join only at a point), as seen in the setiset shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe fewest number of pieces in a setiset is two. Figure 4 encapsulates an infinite family of order 2 setisets each composed of two triangles, ''P'' and ''Q''. As shown, the latter can be hinged together to produce a compound triangle that has the same shape as ''P'' or ''Q'', depending upon whether the hinge is fully open or fully closed. This unusual specimen thus provides an example of a [[hinged dissection]].\n\n[[File:A setiset showing weakly-connected pieces.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 3:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset showing weakly-connected pieces.]]\n[[File:An infinite family of order 2 setisets.png|thumb|300px|Figure 4:  {{pad|.2em}}  An infinite family of order 2 setisets.]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Inflation and Deflation==\n[[File:A setiset of order 4 showing two stages of inflation.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 5:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset of order 4 using octominoes. Two stages of inflation are shown.]]\n\nThe properties of setisets mean that their pieces form [[substitution tiling]]s, or [[tessellations]] in which the [[prototile]]s can be dissected or combined so as to yield smaller or larger duplicates of themselves. Clearly, the twin actions of forming still larger and larger copies (known as inflation), or still smaller and smaller dissections (deflation), can be repeated indefinitely. In this way, setisets can produce non-periodic tilings. However, none of the non-periodic tilings thus far discovered qualify as [[Aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]], because the prototiles can always be rearranged so as to yield a periodic tiling. Figure 5 shows the first two stages of inflation of an order 4 set leading to a non-periodic tiling.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Loops==\n[[File:A loop of length 2 using decominoes.png|thumb|300px|Figure 6:  {{pad|.2em}}  A loop of length 2 using decominoes.]]\nBesides self-tiling tile sets, which can be interpreted as loops of length 1, there exist longer loops, or closed chains of sets, in which every set tiles its successor.<ref name=delahaye>[http://www.scilogs.fr/complexites/pepites-geometriques-cachees/ ''Geometric Hidden Gems'' by Jean-Paul Delahaye in Scilogs], April 07, 2013</ref> Figure 6 shows a pair of mutually tiling sets of [[decominoes]], in other words, a loop of length 2. Sallows and Schotel did an exhaustive search of order 4 sets that are composed of [[octominoes]]. In addition to seven ordinary setisets (i.e., loops of length 1) they found a bewildering variety of loops of every length up to a maximum of 14. The total number of loops identified was nearly one and a half million. More research in this area remains to be done, but it seems safe to suppose that other shapes may also entail loops.<ref>[http://www.leesallows.com/index.php?page_menu=Self-Tiling%20Tile%20Sets Self-Tiling Tile Sets website]</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Methods of construction==\nTo date, two methods have been used for producing setisets. In the case of sets composed of shapes such as [[polyomino]]es, which entail integral piece sizes, a brute force search by computer is possible, so long as ''n'', the number of pieces involved, is not prohibitive. It is easily shown that ''n'' must then be a [[Square number|perfect square]].<ref name=mathmag2/> Figures 1,2,3,5 and 6 are all examples found by this method.\n\nAlternatively, there exists a method whereby multiple copies of a rep-tile can be dissected in certain ways so as to yield shapes that create setisets. Figures 7 and 8 show setisets produced by this means, in which each piece is the union of 2 and 3 rep-tiles, respectively. In Figure 8 can be seen how the 9 pieces above together tile the 3 rep-tile shapes below, while each of the 9 pieces is itself formed by the union of 3 such rep-tile shapes. Hence each shape can be tiled with smaller duplicates of the entire set of 9.<ref name=mathmag2/>\n\n[[File:A rep-tile-based setiset of order 4.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 7:  {{pad|.2em}}   A rep-tile-based setiset of order 4.]]\n[[File:A rep-tile-based setiset of order 9.png|thumb|300px|Figure 8:  {{pad|.2em}}   A rep-tile-based setiset of order 9.]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://leesallows.com/index.php?page_menu=Self-Tiling%20Tile%20Sets Self-Tiling Tile Sets website]\n\n{{Tessellation}}\n\n[[Category:Tessellation]]\n[[Category:Self-replication]]"

(An '''integral square''' is a [[square (geometry)|square]] whose sides have [[integer]] length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with [[squaring the circle]]. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set.  The most studied restriction is that the squaring be '''perfect''', meaning the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is '''squaring the plane''', which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.\n\n== Perfect squared squares ==\n\n[[File:Smith diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|Smith diagram of a rectangle]]\n\nA \"perfect\" squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.\n\nIt is first recorded as being studied by  [[R. Leonard Brooks|R. L. Brooks]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C. A. B. Smith]], [[Arthur Harold Stone|A. H. Stone]] and [[W. T. Tutte]] at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938.\nThey transformed the square tiling into an equivalent [[electrical circuit]] — they called it a \"Smith diagram\" — by considering the squares as [[resistor]]s that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and [[circuit decomposition]] techniques to that circuit.  The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.\n\nThe first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by [[Roland Sprague]] in 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-games5 |title=5.

This problem was later publicized by Martin Gardner in his [[Scientific American]] column and appeared in several books, but it defied solution for over 30 years.\n\nIn ''Tilings and Patterns'', published in 1987, [[Branko Grünbaum]] and G. C. Shephard stated that in all perfect integral tilings of the plane known at that time, the sizes of the squares [[exponential growth|grew exponentially]]. For example, the plane can be tiled with different integral squares, but not for every integer, by recursively taking any perfect squared square and enlarging it so that the formerly smallest tile now has the size of the original squared square, then replacing this tile with a copy of the original squared square.\n\nIn 2008 James Henle and Frederick Henle proved that this, in fact, can be done.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = Frederick V. | last2 = Henle | first2 = James M. | year = 2008 | title = Squaring the plane | journal = American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 3–12 | jstor=27642387}}</ref>  Their proof is constructive and proceeds by \"puffing up\" an L-shaped region formed by two side-by-side and horizontally flush squares of different sizes to a perfect tiling of a larger rectangular region, then adjoining the square of the smallest size not yet used to get another, larger L-shaped region. The squares added during the puffing up procedure have sizes that have not yet appeared in the construction and the procedure is set up so that the resulting rectangular regions are expanding in all four directions, which leads to a tiling of the whole plane.\n\n== Cubing the cube ==\n\n'''Cubing the cube''' is the analogue in three dimensions of squaring the square: that is, given a [[cube]] ''C'', the problem of dividing it into finitely many smaller cubes, no two congruent.\n\nUnlike the case of squaring the square, a hard yet solvable problem, there is no perfect cubed cube and, more generally, no dissection of a [[Cuboid#Rectangular cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] ''C'' into a finite number of unequal cubes.\n\nSuppose that there is such a dissection. Make a face of ''C'' its horizontal base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle ''R'' by the cubes which rest on it. Each corner square of ''R'' has a smaller adjacent edge square, and ''R'''s smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge. Therefore, the smallest square ''s''<sub>1</sub> in ''R'' is surrounded by ''larger'', and therefore ''higher'', cubes on all four sides. Hence the upper face of the cube on ''s''<sub>1</sub> is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let ''s''<sub>2</sub> be the smallest square in this dissection. The sequence of squares ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number. This contradicts our original supposition.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brooks |first1=R. L.|last2=Smith|first2=C. A. B. |last3=Stone |first3=A. H. |last4=Tutte |first4=W.

      "text": "In geometry, a '''tile substitution''' is a method for constructing highly ordered [[Tessellation|tiling]]s.  Most importantly, some tile substitutions generate [[aperiodic tiling]]s, which are tilings whose [[prototile]]s do not admit any tiling with [[translational symmetry]]. The most famous of these are the [[Penrose tiling]]s. Substitution tilings are special cases of [[finite subdivision rules]], which do not require the tiles to be geometrically rigid.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nA tile substitution is described by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of '''prototiles''' (tile shapes) <math>T_1,T_2,\\dots, T_m</math>, an '''expanding map''' <math>Q</math> and a '''dissection rule''' showing how to dissect the expanded prototiles <math>Q T_i</math> to form copies of some prototiles <math>T_j</math>.  Intuitively, higher and higher iterations of tile substitution produce a tiling of the plane called a '''substitution tiling'''.  Some substitution tilings are [[Periodic function|periodic]], defined as having [[translational symmetry]].  \nEvery substitution tiling (up to mild conditions) can be \"enforced by matching rules\"—that is, there exist a set of marked tiles that can only form exactly the substitution tilings generated by the system. The tilings by these marked tiles are necessarily  [[aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]].<ref>C. Goodman-Strauss, [http://lipn.fr/~fernique/qc/goodman_strauss.pdf Matching Rules and Substitution Tilings], Annals Math., 147 (1998), 181-223.</ref><ref>Th. Fernique and N. Ollinger,  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.5167 Combinatorial substitutions and sofic tilings], Journees Automates Cellulaires 2010, J. Kari ed., TUCS Lecture Notes 13 (2010), 100-110.</ref>\n\nA simple example that produces a periodic tiling has only one prototile, namely a square:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Image:subst-square.png]]\n</blockquote>\n\nBy iterating this tile substitution, larger and larger regions of the plane are covered with a square grid. A more sophisticated example with two prototiles is shown below, with the two steps of blowing up and dissecting merged into one step.\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Image:subst-haus.png]]\n</blockquote>\n\nOne may intuitively get an idea how this procedure yields a substitution tiling of the entire [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. A mathematically rigorous definition is given below. Substitution tilings are notably useful as ways of defining [[aperiodic tiling]]s, which are objects of interest in many fields of [[mathematics]], including [[automata theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[discrete geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[group theory]], [[harmonic analysis]] and [[number theory]], as well as [[crystallography]] and [[chemistry]]. In particular, the celebrated [[Penrose tiling]] is an example of an aperiodic substitution tiling.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, [[Roger Penrose]] discovered a family of aperiodic tilings, now called [[Penrose tiling]]s. The first description was given in terms of 'matching rules' treating the prototiles as [[jigsaw puzzle]] pieces. The proof that copies of these prototiles can be put together to form a [[tessellation|tiling]] of the plane, but cannot do so periodically, uses a construction that can be cast as a substitution tiling of the prototiles. In 1977 [[Robert Ammann]] discovered a number of sets of aperiodic prototiles, i.e., prototiles with matching rules forcing nonperiodic tilings; in particular, he rediscovered Penrose's first example. This work gave an impact to scientists working in [[crystallography]], eventually leading to the discovery of [[quasicrystals]]. In turn, the interest in quasicrystals led to the discovery of several well-ordered aperiodic tilings. Many of them can be easily described as substitution tilings.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\n\nWe will consider '''regions''' in <math>{\\mathbb R}^d</math> that are [[well-behaved]], in the sense that a region is a nonempty compact subset that is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of its [[Interior (topology)|interior]].\n\nWe take a set of regions <math>\\mathbf{P} = \\{ T_1, T_2,\\dots, T_m \\}</math> as prototiles.  A '''placement''' of a prototile <math>T_i</math> is a pair <math>( T_i, \\varphi )</math> where <math>\\varphi</math>is an [[isometry]] of <math>{\\mathbb R}^d</math>.  The image <math>\\varphi(T_i)</math> is called the placement's region.  A '''tiling T''' is a set of prototile placements whose regions have pairwise disjoint interiors.  We say that the tiling '''T''' is a '''tiling of W''' where '''W''' is the union of the regions of the placements in '''T'''.\n\nA tile substitution is often loosely defined in the literature. A precise definition is as follows.<ref>\nD. Frettlöh, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0601064 Duality of Model Sets Generated by Substitutions], Romanian Journal of Pure and Applied Math. 50, 2005</ref>\n\nA '''tile substitution''' with respect to the prototiles '''P''' is a pair <math>(Q, \\sigma)</math>, where  <math>Q: {\\mathbb R}^d \\to {\\mathbb R}^d</math> is a [[linear map]], all of whose [[eigenvalues]] are larger than one in modulus,  together with a '''substitution rule''' <math>\\sigma</math> that maps each <math>T_i</math> to a tiling of <math>Q T_i</math>.  The substitution rule <math>\\sigma</math> induces a map from any tiling '''T''' of a region '''W''' to a tiling <math>\\sigma(\\mathbf{T})</math> of <math>Q_\\sigma(\\mathbf{W})</math>, defined by\n: <math>\\sigma(\\mathbf{T}) = \\bigcup_{(T_i,\\varphi) \\in \\mathbf{T}} \\{ ( T_j, Q \\circ \\varphi \\circ Q^{-1} \\circ \\rho ) : (T_j, \\rho) \\in \\sigma(T_i) \\} .</math>\n\nNote, that the prototiles can be deduced from the tile substitution. Therefore it is not necessary to include them in the tile substitution <math>(Q,\\sigma)</math>.<ref>A. Vince, Digit Tiling of Euclidean Space, in: Directions in Mathematical Quasicrystals, eds: M. Baake, R.V. Moody, AMS, 2000</ref>\n\nEvery tiling of <math>{\\mathbb R}^d</math>, where any finite part of it is congruent to a subset\nof some <math>\\sigma^k(T_i)</math> is called a substitution tiling (for the tile substitution <math>(Q, \\sigma)</math>).\n\n<!--Consider a tiling <math>\\mathbf{T}_0 = \\{ (T_j, \\varphi_0) \\}</math>, and suppose that ''k'' iterations of an expanding map <math>\\sigma</math> map <math>\\mathbf{T}_0</math> to a tiling that contains a placement <math>(T_j,\\rho_0)</math> whose region is interior to the region of <math>\\sigma^k(\\mathbf{T_0})</math>.  This allows us to define sequence of tilings <math>\\mathbf{T}_1, \\mathbf{T}_2, \\mathbf{T}_3, \\cdots</math> where\n: <math>\\mathbf{T}_{i+1} = \\{ (T_j, \\varphi_0 \\circ \\rho_0^{-1} \\circ \\rho ) : (T_j, \\rho) \\in \\sigma^k(\\mathbf{T}_i) \\} .</math>\n\nThen each <math>\\mathbf{T}_i</math> is a subset of <math>\\mathbf{T}_{i+1}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{T} = \\bigcup_i \\mathbf{T}_i</math> is a tiling of <math>{\\mathbb R}^d</math>.
