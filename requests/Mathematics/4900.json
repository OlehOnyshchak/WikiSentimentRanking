It was introduced by [[Anton Karl Grünwald]] (1838–1920) from [[Prague]], in 1867, and by [[Aleksey Letnikov|Aleksey Vasilievich Letnikov]] (1837–1888) in [[Moscow]] in 1868.\n\n==Constructing the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative==\n\nThe formula \n:<math>f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</math>\nfor the derivative can be applied recursively to get higher-order derivatives.  For example, the second-order derivative would be:\n\n:<math>f''(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}</math>\n\n:<math> = \\lim_{h_1 \\to 0} \\frac{\\lim_{h_2 \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h_1+h_2)-f(x+h_1)}{h_2}-\\lim_{h_2 \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h_2)-f(x)}{h_2}}{h_1}</math>\n\nAssuming that the ''h'' 's converge synchronously, this simplifies to:\n\n:<math> = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+2h)-2f(x+h)+f(x)}{h^2},</math>\n\nwhich can be justified rigorously by the [[mean value theorem]]. In general, we have (see [[binomial coefficient]]):\n\n:<math>f^{(n)}(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\sum_{0 \\le m \\le n}(-1)^m {n \\choose m}f(x+(n-m)h)}{h^n}.</math>\n\nRemoving the restriction that ''n'' be a positive integer, it is reasonable to define:\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{1}{h^q}\\sum_{0 \\le m < \\infty}(-1)^m {q \\choose m}f(x+(q-m)h).</math>\n\nThis defines the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative.\n\nTo simplify notation, we set:\n\n:<math>\\Delta^q_h f(x) = \\sum_{0 \\le m < \\infty}(-1)^m {q \\choose m}f(x+(q-m)h).</math>\n\nSo the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative may be succinctly written as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) =  \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{\\Delta^q_h f(x)}{h^q}.</math>\n\n===An alternative definition===\n\nIn the preceding section, the general first principles equation for integer order derivatives was derived. It can be shown that the equation may also be written as\n\n:<math>f^{(n)}(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(-1)^n}{h^n}\\sum_{0 \\le m \\le n}(-1)^m {n \\choose m}f(x+mh).</math>\n\nor removing the restriction that ''n'' must be a positive integer:\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(-1)^q}{h^q}\\sum_{0 \\le m < \\infty}(-1)^m {q \\choose m}f(x+mh).</math>\n\nThis equation is called the reverse Grünwald–Letnikov derivative.

The integral is a manner of generalization of the repeated [[antiderivative]] of ''&fnof;'' in the sense that for positive integer values of α, ''I''<sup>α</sup>''&fnof;'' is an iterated antiderivative of ''&fnof;'' of order α.  The Riemann–Liouville integral is named for [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Joseph Liouville]], the latter of whom was the first to consider the possibility of [[fractional calculus]] in 1832.<ref name=\"Lizorkin\">{{harvnb|Lizorkin|2001}}</ref>  The operator agrees with the '''[[Euler transform]]''', after [[Leonhard Euler]], when applied to [[analytic function]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Brychkov|Prudnikov|2001}}</ref>  It was generalized to arbitrary dimensions by [[Marcel Riesz]], who introduced the [[Riesz potential]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe Riemann–Liouville integral is defined by\n:<math>I^\\alpha f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\int_a^xf(t)(x-t)^{\\alpha-1}\\,dt</math>\nwhere Γ is the [[Gamma function]] and ''a'' is an arbitrary but fixed base point.  The integral is well-defined provided ''&fnof;'' is a [[locally integrable function]], and α is a [[complex number]] in the [[half-plane]] re(α)&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  The dependence on the base-point ''a'' is often suppressed, and represents a freedom in [[constant of integration]]. Clearly ''I''<sup>1</sup>ƒ is an antiderivative of ƒ (of first order), and for positive integer values of α, ''I''<sup>α</sup>ƒ is an antiderivative of order α by [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]].  Another notation, which emphasizes the basepoint, is<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|Ross|1993|p=21}}</ref>\n\n:<math>{}_aD_x^{-\\alpha}f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\int_a^x f(t)(x-t)^{\\alpha-1}\\,dt.</math>\n\nThis also makes sense if ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;∞, with suitable restrictions on ''&fnof;''.\n\nThe fundamental relations hold\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}I^{\\alpha+1} f(x) =  I^\\alpha f(x),\\quad I^\\alpha(I^\\beta f) = I^{\\alpha+\\beta}f,</math>\nthe latter of which is a [[semigroup]] property.<ref name=\"Lizorkin\" />  These properties make possible not only the definition of fractional integration, but also of fractional differentiation, by taking enough derivatives of ''I''<sup>α</sup>''&fnof;''.\n\n==Properties==\nFix a bounded interval (''a'',''b'').  The operator ''I''<sup>α</sup> associates to each [[integrable function]] ''&fnof;'' on (''a'',''b'') the function ''I''<sup>α</sup>''&fnof;'' on (''a'',''b'') which is also integrable by [[Fubini's theorem]].  Thus ''I''<sup>α</sup> defines a [[linear operator]] on [[Lp space|L<sup>1</sup>(''a'',''b'')]]:\n:<math>I^\\alpha : L^1(a,b) \\to L^1(a,b).</math>\nFubini's theorem also shows that this operator is [[continuous linear operator|continuous]] with respect to the [[Banach space]] structure on L<sup>1</sup>, and that the following inequality holds:\n:<math>\\|I^\\alpha f\\|_1 \\le \\frac{|b-a|^{\\operatorname{re}(\\alpha)}}{\\operatorname{re}(\\alpha)|\\Gamma(\\alpha)|}\\|f\\|_1.</math>\nHere <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_1</math> denotes the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on L<sup>1</sup>(''a'',''b'').\n\nMore generally, by [[Hölder's inequality]], it follows that if ''&fnof;''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;L<sup>''p''</sup>(''a'',''b''), then ''I''<sup>α</sup>''&fnof;''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;L<sup>''p''</sup>(''a'',''b'') as well, and the analogous inequality holds\n\n:<math>\\|I^\\alpha f\\|_p \\le \\frac{|b-a|^{\\operatorname{re}(\\alpha)/p}}{\\operatorname{re}(\\alpha)|\\Gamma(\\alpha)|}\\|f\\|_p</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_p</math> is the [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup> norm]] on the interval (''a'',''b''). Thus ''I''<sup>α</sup> defines a bounded linear operator from ''L''<sup>''p''</sup>(''a'',''b'') to itself.  Furthermore, ''I''<sup>α</sup>''&fnof;'' tends to ''&fnof;'' in the ''L''<sup>''p''</sup> sense as α&nbsp;→&nbsp;0 along the real axis.  That is\n:<math>\\underset{\\alpha > 0}{\\lim_{\\alpha\\to 0}} \\|I^\\alpha f-f\\|_p = 0</math>\nfor all ''p''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1.  Moreover, by estimating the [[maximal function]] of ''I'', one can show that the limit ''I''<sup>α</sup>''&fnof;''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''&fnof;'' holds pointwise [[almost everywhere]].\n\nThe operator ''I''<sup>α</sup> is well-defined on the set of locally integrable function on the whole real line '''R'''.  It defines a bounded transformation on any of the [[Banach space]]s of functions of [[exponential type]]  ''X''<sub>σ</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''L''<sup>1</sup>(''e''<sup>−σ|''t''|</sup>d''t''), consisting of locally integrable functions for which the norm\n:<math>\\|f\\| = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |f(t)|e^{-\\sigma|t|}\\,dt</math>\nis finite. For ƒ in ''X''<sub>σ</sub>, the [[Laplace transform]] of ''I<sup>&alpha;</sup>&fnof;'' takes the particularly simple form\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}I^\\alpha f)(s) = s^{-\\alpha}F(s)</math>\nfor re(''s'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;σ.  Here ''F''(''s'') denotes the Laplace transform of ''&fnof;'', and this property expresses that ''I''<sup>α</sup> is a [[Fourier multiplier]].\n\n==Fractional derivatives==\nOne can define fractional-order derivatives of ''&fnof;'' as well by\n:<math>\\frac{d^\\alpha}{dx^\\alpha} f \\overset{def}{=} \\frac{d^{\\lceil\\alpha\\rceil}}{dx^{\\lceil\\alpha\\rceil}} I^{\\lceil\\alpha\\rceil-\\alpha}f</math>\nwhere <math>\\lceil\\cdot\\rceil</math> denotes the [[ceiling function]].  One also obtains a [[differintegral]] interpolating between differentiation and integration by defining\n:<math>D^\\alpha_x f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d^{\\lceil\\alpha\\rceil}}{dx^{\\lceil\\alpha\\rceil}} I^{\\lceil\\alpha\\rceil-\\alpha}f(x)& \\alpha>0\\\\\nf(x) & \\alpha=0\\\\\nI^{-\\alpha}f(x) & \\alpha<0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nAn alternative fractional derivative was introduced by Caputo in 1967, and produces a derivative that has different properties: it produces zero from constant functions and, more importantly, the initial value terms of the [[Laplace Transform]] are expressed by means of the  values of that function and of its derivative of integer order rather than the derivatives of fractional order as in the Riemann–Liouville derivative.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051029113800/http://www.nd.edu/~msen/Teaching/UnderRes/FracCalc.pdf]  The Caputo fractional derivative with base point <math>x</math>, is then:\n\n:<math>D_x^{\\alpha}f(y)=\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-\\alpha)}\\int_x^y f'(y-u)(u-x)^{-\\alpha}du.</math>\n\nAnother representation is:\n\n:<math>{}_a\\tilde{D}^\\alpha_x f(x)=I^{\\lceil \\alpha\\rceil-\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{d^{\\lceil \\alpha\\rceil}f}{dx^{\\lceil \\alpha\\rceil}}\\right).</math>\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{springer|title=Euler transformation|id=e/e036620|first1=Yu.A.|last1=Brychkov|first2=A.P.|last2=Prudnikov}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Hille | first1=Einar | last2=Phillips | first2=Ralph S. | title=Functional analysis and semi-groups | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | mr=0423094  | year=1974}}.\n*{{springer|title=Fractional integration and differentiation|id=f/f041230|first=P.I.|last=Lizorkin}}.\n*{{citation|title=An Introduction to the Fractional Calculus and Fractional Differential Equations|first1=Kenneth S.|last1=Miller|first2=Bertram|last2=Ross|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1993|isbn=0-471-58884-9}}.\n*{{Citation | doi=10.1007/BF02395016 | last1=Riesz | first1=Marcel | author1-link=Marcel Riesz | title=L'intégrale de Riemann-Liouville et le problème de Cauchy | mr=0030102  | year=1949 | journal=[[Acta Mathematica]] | issn=0001-5962 | volume=81 | issue=1 | pages=1–223}}.\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|author=Alan Beardon|url=http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1369|title=Fractional calculus II|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2000}}\n*{{cite web|author=Alan Beardon|url=http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1371|title=Fractional calculus III|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2000}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riemann-Liouville integral}}\n[[Category:Fractional calculus]]\n[[Category:Integral transforms]]\n[[Category:Bernhard Riemann]]"

In this connection, the Riesz potential of a positive [[Borel measure]] &mu; with [[support (measure theory)|compact support]] is chiefly of interest in [[potential theory]] because ''I''<sub>&alpha;</sub>&mu; is then a (continuous) [[subharmonic function]] off the support of &mu;, and is [[lower semicontinuous]] on all of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nConsideration of the [[Fourier transform]] reveals that the Riesz potential is a [[Fourier multiplier]].<ref>{{harvnb|Samko|1998|loc=section II}}.</ref>\nIn fact, one has\n:<math>\\widehat{K_\\alpha}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} K_{\\alpha}(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi }\\, \\mathrm{d}x = |2\\pi\\xi|^{-\\alpha}</math>\nand so, by the [[convolution theorem]],\n:<math>\\widehat{I_\\alpha f}(\\xi) = |2\\pi\\xi|^{-\\alpha} \\hat{f}(\\xi).</math>\n\nThe Riesz potentials satisfy the following [[semigroup]] property on, for instance, [[rapidly decreasing]] [[continuous function]]s\n:<math>I_\\alpha I_\\beta = I_{\\alpha+\\beta}\\ </math>\nprovided\n:<math>0 < \\operatorname{Re\\,} \\alpha, \\operatorname{Re\\,} \\beta < n,\\quad 0 < \\operatorname{Re\\,} (\\alpha+\\beta) < n.</math>\nFurthermore, if 2&nbsp;<&nbsp;Re&nbsp;&alpha;&nbsp;<''n'', then\n:<math>\\Delta I_{\\alpha+2} = -I_\\alpha.\\ </math>\nOne also has, for this class of functions,\n:<math>\\lim_{\\alpha\\to 0^+} (I_\\alpha f)(x) = f(x).</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bessel potential]]\n* [[Fractional integration]]\n* [[Sobolev space]]\n* [[Fractional Schrödinger equation]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Landkof | first1=N.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Sobolev space''' is a [[vector space]] of functions equipped with a [[normed space|norm]] that is a combination of [[Lp norm|''L<sup>p</sup>''-norms]] of the function itself and its derivatives up to a given order. The derivatives are understood in a suitable [[weak derivative|weak sense]] to make the space [[Complete metric space|complete]], thus a [[Banach space]]. Intuitively, a Sobolev space is a space of functions with sufficiently many derivatives for some application domain, such as [[partial differential equation]]s, and equipped with a norm that measures both the size and regularity of a function.\n\nSobolev spaces are named after the Russian [[mathematician]] [[Sergei Lvovich Sobolev|Sergei Sobolev]]. Their importance comes from the fact that solutions of partial differential equations are naturally found in Sobolev spaces, rather than in spaces of [[continuous function]]s and with the [[derivative]]s understood in the classical sense.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nIn this section and throughout the article <math>\\Omega</math> is an [[open subset]] of <math>\\R^n.</math>\n\nThere are many criteria for smoothness of [[mathematical function]]s. The most basic criterion may be that of [[continuous function|continuity]]. A stronger notion of smoothness is that of [[differentiability]] (because functions that are differentiable are also continuous) and a yet stronger notion of smoothness is that the derivative also be continuous (these functions are said to be of class ''C''<sup>1</sup> &mdash; see [[Differentiability classes]]). Differentiable functions are important in many areas, and in particular for [[differential equation]]s. In the twentieth century, however, it was observed that the space ''C''<sup>1</sup> (or ''C''<sup>2</sup>, etc.) was not exactly the right space to study solutions of differential equations. The Sobolev spaces are the modern replacement for these spaces in which to look for solutions of partial differential equations.\n\nQuantities or properties of the underlying model of the differential equation are usually expressed in terms of integral norms, rather than the [[uniform norm]]. A typical example is measuring the energy of a temperature or velocity distribution by an ''L''<sup>2</sup>-norm. It is therefore important to develop a tool for differentiating [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]] functions.\n\nThe [[integration by parts]] formula yields that for every ''u'' ∈ ''C<sup>k</sup>''(Ω), where ''k'' is a [[natural number]], and for all infinitely differentiable functions with [[compact support]] <math>\\varphi \\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\Omega),</math>\n\n:<math> \\int_\\Omega uD^\\alpha\\varphi\\;dx=(-1)^{|\\alpha|}\\int_\\Omega \\varphi D^\\alpha u\\;dx,</math>\n\nwhere ''α'' a [[multi-index]] of order |''α''|&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k'' and we are using the notation:\n\n:<math>D^{\\alpha}f = \\frac{\\partial^{| \\alpha |} f}{\\partial x_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\dots \\partial x_{n}^{\\alpha_{n}}}.</math>\n\nThe left-hand side of this equation still makes sense if we only assume ''u'' to be [[locally integrable]]. If there exists a locally integrable function ''v'', such that\n\n:<math> \\int_\\Omega uD^\\alpha\\varphi\\;dx=(-1)^{|\\alpha|}\\int_\\Omega \\varphi v \\;dx, \\qquad\\varphi\\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega),</math>\n\nwe call ''v'' the [[weak derivative|weak ''α''-th partial derivative]] of ''u''. If there exists a weak ''α''-th partial derivative of ''u'', then it is uniquely defined [[almost everywhere]], and thus it is uniquely determined as an element of a [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]]. On the other hand, if ''u''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''C<sup>k</sup>''(Ω), then the classical and the weak derivative coincide. Thus, if ''v'' is a weak ''α''-th partial derivative of ''u'', we may denote it by ''D<sup>α</sup>u''&nbsp;:=&nbsp;''v''.\n\nFor example, the function\n\n:<math>u(x)=\\begin{cases}\n1+x & -1<x<0 \\\\\n10 & x=0\\\\\n1-x & 0<x<1\\\\\n0 & \\text{else}\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis not continuous at zero, and not differentiable at −1, 0, or 1. Yet the function\n\n:<math>v(x)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & -1<x<0 \\\\\n-1 &  0<x<1\\\\\n0 & \\text{else}\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nsatisfies the definition for being the weak derivative of <math>u(x),</math> which then qualifies as being in the Sobolev space <math>W^{1,p}</math> (for any allowed ''p'', see definition below).\n\nThe Sobolev spaces <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> combine the concepts of weak differentiability and [[Lp norm|Lebesgue norms]].\n\n==Sobolev spaces with integer ''k''==\n\n===One-dimensional case===\nIn the one-dimensional case the Sobolev space <math>W^{k,p}(\\R)</math> for <math>1 \\leqslant p \\leqslant \\infty</math> is defined as the subset of functions <math>f</math> in [[Lp space|<math>L^p(\\R)</math>]] such that <math>f</math> and its [[weak derivative]]s up to order <math>k</math> have a finite [[Lp norm|{{math|''L<sup>p</sup>''}} norm]]. As mentioned above, some care must be taken to define derivatives in the proper sense. In the one-dimensional problem it is enough to assume that <math>f^{(k-1)},</math> the <math>(k-1)</math>–th derivative of the function <math>f,</math> is differentiable almost everywhere and is equal almost everywhere to the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] of its derivative (this gets rid of examples such as [[Cantor function|Cantor's function]] which are irrelevant to what the definition is trying to accomplish).\n\nWith this definition, the Sobolev spaces admit a natural [[Normed vector space|norm]],\n\n:<math>\\|f\\|_{k,p} = \\left (\\sum_{i=0}^k \\left \\|f^{(i)} \\right \\|_p^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} = \\left (\\sum_{i=0}^k \\int \\left |f^{(i)}(t) \\right |^p\\,dt \\right )^{\\frac{1}{p}}.</math>\n\nEquipped with the norm <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_{k,p}, W^{k,p}</math> becomes a [[Banach space]]. It turns out that it is enough to take only the first and last in the sequence, i.e., the norm defined by\n\n:<math>\\left \\|f^{(k)} \\right \\|_p + \\|f\\|_p</math>\n\nis equivalent to the norm above (i.e. the [[Normed vector space#Topological structure|induced topologies]] of the norms are the same).\n\n====The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}====\nSobolev spaces with {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} are especially important because of their connection with [[Fourier series]] and because they form a [[Hilbert space]]. A special notation has arisen to cover this case, since the space is a Hilbert space:\n\n:<math>H^k = W^{k,2}.</math>\n\nThe space <math>H^k</math> can be defined naturally in terms of [[Fourier series]] whose coefficients decay sufficiently rapidly, namely,\n\n:<math>H^k(\\mathbb{T}) = \\left \\{ f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{T}) : \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\left (1+n^2 + n^4 + \\dots + n^{2k} \\right ) \\left |\\widehat{f}(n) \\right |^2 < \\infty \\right \\}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{f}</math> is the Fourier series of <math>f,</math> and <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> denotes the 1-torus. As above, one can use the equivalent norm\n\n:<math>\\|f\\|^2_{k,2}=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\left (1 + |n|^{2} \\right )^k \\left |\\widehat{f}(n) \\right |^2.</math>\n\nBoth representations follow easily from [[Parseval's theorem]] and the fact that differentiation is equivalent to multiplying the Fourier coefficient by ''in''.\n\nFurthermore, the space <math>H^k</math> admits an [[inner product space|inner product]], like the space <math>H^0 = L^2.</math> In fact, the <math>H^k</math> inner product is defined in terms of the <math>L^2</math> inner product:\n\n:<math>\\langle u,v\\rangle_{H^k} = \\sum_{i=0}^k \\left \\langle D^i u,D^i v \\right \\rangle_{L^2}.</math>\n\nThe space <math>H^k</math> becomes a Hilbert space with this inner product.\n\n====Other examples====\nSome other Sobolev spaces permit a simpler description. For example, <math>W^{1,1}(0,1)</math> is the space of [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous functions]] on {{math|(0, 1)}} (or rather, equivalence classes of functions that are equal almost everywhere to such), while <math>W^{1,\\infty}(I)</math> is the space of [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz functions]] on {{mvar|I}}, for every interval {{mvar|I}}. All spaces <math>W^{k,\\infty}</math> are (normed) [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s, i.e. the product of two elements is once again a function of this Sobolev space, which is not the case for <math>p<\\infty.</math> (E.g., functions behaving like |''x''|<sup>−1/3</sup> at the origin are in <math>L^2,</math> but the product of two such functions is not in <math>L^2</math>).\n\n===Multidimensional case===\nThe transition to multiple dimensions brings more difficulties, starting from the very definition. The requirement that <math>f^{(k-1)}</math> be the integral of <math>f^{(k)}</math> does not generalize, and the simplest solution is to consider derivatives in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]].\n\nA formal definition now follows. Let <math>k \\in \\N, 1 \\leqslant p \\leqslant \\infty.</math> The Sobolev space <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> is defined to be the set of all functions <math>f</math> on <math>\\Omega</math> such that for every [[multi-index]] <math>\\alpha</math> with <math>|\\alpha|\\leqslant k,</math> the mixed [[partial derivative]]\n\n:<math>f^{(\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\partial^{| \\alpha |} f}{\\partial x_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\dots \\partial x_{n}^{\\alpha_{n}}}</math>\n\nexists in the [[weak derivative|weak]] sense and is in <math>L^p(\\Omega),</math> i.e.\n\n:<math>\\left \\|f^{(\\alpha)} \\right \\|_{L^{p}} < \\infty.</math>\n\nThat is, the Sobolev space <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega) = \\left \\{ u \\in L^p(\\Omega) : D^{\\alpha}u \\in L^p(\\Omega) \\,\\, \\forall |\\alpha| \\leqslant k \\right \\}. </math>\n\nThe [[natural number]] <math>k</math> is called the order of the Sobolev space <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega).</math>\n\nThere are several choices for a norm for <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega).</math> The following two are common and are equivalent in the sense of [[Norm (mathematics)#Properties|equivalence of norms]]:\n\n:<math>\\| u \\|_{W^{k, p}(\\Omega)} := \\begin{cases} \n\\left( \\sum_{|\\alpha | \\leqslant k} \\left \\| D^{\\alpha}u \\right \\|_{L^p(\\Omega)}^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} & 1 \\leqslant p < \\infty; \\\\ \n\\max_{| \\alpha | \\leqslant k} \\left \\| D^{\\alpha}u \\right \\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)} & p = \\infty; \n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\| u \\|'_{W^{k, p}(\\Omega)} := \\begin{cases} \n\\sum_{| \\alpha | \\leqslant k} \\left \\| D^{\\alpha}u \\right \\|_{L^{p}(\\Omega)}  & 1 \\leqslant p < \\infty; \\\\ \n\\sum_{| \\alpha | \\leqslant k} \\left \\| D^{\\alpha}u \\right \\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)} & p = \\infty. \n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nWith respect to either of these norms, <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> is a Banach space. For <math>p<\\infty, W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> is also a [[separable space]]. It is conventional to denote <math>W^{k,2}(\\Omega)</math> by <math>H^k(\\Omega)</math> for it is a [[Hilbert space]] with the norm <math>\\| \\cdot \\|_{W^{k, 2}(\\Omega)}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1998|loc=Chapter 5.2}}</ref>\n\n====Approximation by smooth functions====\nIt is rather hard to work with Sobolev spaces relying only on their definition. It is therefore interesting to know that by theorem of [[Norman George Meyers|Meyers]] and [[James Serrin|Serrin]] a function <math>u \\in W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> can be approximated by [[smooth functions]]. This fact often allows us to translate properties of smooth functions to Sobolev functions. If <math>p</math> is finite and <math>\\Omega</math> is open, then there exists for any <math>u \\in W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> an approximating sequence of functions <math>u_m \\in C^{\\infty}(\\Omega)</math> such that:\n\n:<math> \\left \\| u_m - u \\right \\|_{W^{k,p}(\\Omega)} \\to 0.</math>\n\nIf <math>\\Omega</math> has [[Lipschitz boundary]], we may even assume that the <math>u_m</math> are the restriction of smooth functions with compact support on all of <math>\\R^n.</math><ref name=\"Adams1975\">{{harvnb|Adams|1975}}</ref>\n\n====Examples====\n\nIn higher dimensions, it is no longer true that, for example, <math>W^{1,1}</math> contains only continuous functions. For example, <math>|x|^{-1} \\in W^{1,1}(\\mathbb{B}^3)</math> where <math>\\mathbb{B}^3</math> is the [[unit ball]] in three dimensions. For ''k'' > ''n''/''p'' the space <math>W^{k,p}(\\Omega)</math> will contain only continuous functions, but for which ''k'' this is already true depends both on ''p'' and on the dimension. For example, as can be easily checked using [[spherical polar coordinates]] for the function <math>f : \\mathbb{B}^n \\to \\R \\cup \\{\\infty \\}</math> defined on the ''n''-dimensional ball we have:\n\n:<math>f(x) = | x |^{-\\alpha} \\in W^{k,p}(\\mathbb{B}^n) \\Longleftrightarrow \\alpha < \\tfrac{n}{p} - k.</math>\n\nIntuitively, the blow-up of ''f'' at 0 \"counts for less\" when ''n'' is large since the unit ball has \"more outside and less inside\" in higher dimensions.\n\n====Absolutely continuous on lines (ACL) characterization of Sobolev functions====\nLet <math>1\\leqslant p \\leqslant \\infty.</math> If a function is in <math>W^{1,p}(\\Omega),</math> then, possibly after modifying the function on a set of measure zero, the restriction to [[almost every]] line parallel to the coordinate directions in <math>\\R^n</math> is [[absolutely continuous]]; what's more, the classical derivative along the lines that are parallel to the coordinate directions are in <math>L^p(\\Omega).</math> Conversely, if the restriction of <math>f</math> to almost every line parallel to the coordinate directions is absolutely continuous, then the pointwise gradient <math>\\nabla f</math> exists [[almost everywhere]], and <math>f</math> is in <math>W^{1,p}(\\Omega)</math> provided <math>f, |\\nabla f| \\in L^p(\\Omega).</math> In particular, in this case the weak partial derivatives of <math>f</math> and pointwise partial derivatives of <math>f</math> agree almost everywhere. The ACL characterization of the Sobolev spaces was established by [[Otto M. Nikodym]] ([[#CITEREFNikodym1933|1933]]); see {{harv|Maz'ya|1985|loc=§1.1.3}}.\n\nA stronger result holds when <math>p>n.</math> A function in <math>W^{1,p}(\\Omega)</math> is, after modifying on a set of measure zero, [[Hölder continuous]] of exponent <math>\\gamma = 1 - \\tfrac{n}{p},</math> by [[Sobolev inequality#Morrey's inequality|Morrey's inequality]]. In particular, if <math>p=\\infty,</math> then the function is [[Lipschitz continuous]].\n\n==== Functions vanishing at the boundary ====\n{{See also|Trace operator}}\n\nThe Sobolev space <math>W^{1,2}(\\Omega)</math> is also denoted by <math>H^1(\\Omega).</math> It is a Hilbert space, with an important subspace <math>H^1_0(\\Omega)</math> defined to be the closure of the infinitely differentiable functions compactly supported in <math>\\Omega</math> in <math>H^1(\\Omega).</math> The Sobolev norm defined above reduces here to\n\n:<math>\\|f\\|_{H^1} = \\left ( \\int_\\Omega \\left ( |f|^2 + |\\nabla f|^2 \\right) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}.</math>\n\nWhen <math>\\Omega</math> has a regular boundary, <math>H^1_0(\\Omega)</math> can be described as the space of functions in <math>H^1(\\Omega)</math> that vanish at the boundary, in the sense of traces ([[Sobolev space#Extension by zero|see below]]). When <math>n=1,</math> if <math>\\Omega = (a,b)</math> is a bounded interval, then <math>H^1_0(a,b)</math> consists of continuous functions on <math>[a,b]</math> of the form\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\int_a^x f'(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t, \\qquad x \\in [a, b]</math>\n\nwhere the generalized derivative <math>f'</math> is in <math>L^2(a,b)</math> and has 0 integral, so that <math>f(b) = f(a) = 0.</math>\n\nWhen <math>\\Omega</math> is bounded, the [[Poincaré inequality]] states that there is a constant <math>C= C(\\Omega)</math> such that:\n\n:<math>\\int_\\Omega | f|^2 \\leqslant C^2 \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla f|^2, \\qquad f \\in H^1_0(\\Omega).</math>\n\nWhen <math>\\Omega</math> is bounded, the injection from <math>H^1_0(\\Omega)</math> to <math>L^2(\\Omega),</math> is [[Compact operator|compact]]. This fact plays a role in the study of the [[Dirichlet problem]], and in the fact that there exists an [[orthonormal basis]] of <math>L^2(\\Omega)</math> consisting of eigenvectors of the [[Laplace operator]] (with [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]).\n\n==Traces==\n{{See also|Trace operator}}\n\nSobolev spaces are often considered when investigating partial differential equations. It is essential to consider boundary values of Sobolev functions. If ''u''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''C''(Ω), those boundary values are described by the restriction <math>u|_{\\partial\\Omega}</math>. However, it is not clear how to describe values at the boundary for ''u''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''W<sup>k,p</sup>''(Ω), as the ''n''-dimensional measure of the boundary is zero. The following theorem<ref name=\"Adams1975\" /> resolves the problem:\n\n:'''Trace Theorem.''' Assume Ω is bounded with [[Lipschitz boundary]]. Then there exists a bounded linear operator <math>T: W^{1,p}(\\Omega)\\to L^p(\\partial\\Omega)</math> such that\n::<math>\\begin{align}\nTu &= u|_{\\partial\\Omega} && u\\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega)\\cap C(\\overline{\\Omega}) \\\\\n\\|Tu\\|_{L^p(\\partial\\Omega)}&\\leqslant c(p,\\Omega)\\|u\\|_{W^{1,p}(\\Omega)} && u\\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n''Tu'' is called the trace of ''u''. Roughly speaking, this theorem extends the restriction operator to the Sobolev space <math>W^{1,p}(\\Omega)</math> for well-behaved Ω. Note that the [[trace operator]] ''T'' is in general not surjective, but for 1 < ''p'' < ∞ it maps continuously onto the Sobolev-Slobodeckij space <math>W^{1-\\frac{1}{p},p}(\\partial\\Omega).</math>\n\nIntuitively, taking the trace costs 1/''p'' of a derivative. The functions ''u'' in ''W''<sup>1,p</sup>(Ω) with zero trace, i.e. ''Tu''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, can be characterized by the equality\n\n:<math> W_0^{1,p}(\\Omega)= \\left \\{u\\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega): Tu=0 \\right \\},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> W_0^{1,p}(\\Omega):= \\left \\{u\\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega): \\exists \\{u_m\\}_{m=1}^\\infty\\subset C_c^\\infty(\\Omega), \\ \\text{such that} \\ u_m\\to u \\ \\textrm{in} \\ W^{1,p}(\\Omega) \\right \\}.</math>\n\nIn other words, for Ω bounded with Lipschitz boundary, trace-zero functions in <math>W^{1,p}(\\Omega)</math> can be approximated by smooth functions with compact support.\n\n==Sobolev spaces with non-integer ''k''==\n\n===Bessel potential spaces===\nFor a natural number ''k'' and {{math|1 < ''p'' < ∞}} one can show (by using [[Multiplier (Fourier analysis)|Fourier multipliers]]<ref>{{harvnb|Bergh|Löfström|1976}}</ref><ref name=\"Triebel1995\">{{harvnb|Triebel|1995}}</ref>) that the space <math>W^{k,p}(\\R^n)</math> can equivalently be defined as\n\n:<math> W^{k,p}(\\R^n) = H^{k,p}(\\R^n) := \\left \\{f \\in L^p(\\R^n) : \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\left [(1+ |\\xi|^2)^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\mathcal{F}f \\right ] \\in L^p(\\R^n) \\right \\},</math>\n\nwith the norm\n\n:<math>\\|f\\|_{H^{k,p}(\\R^n)} := \\left \\|\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\left [\\left (1+ |\\xi|^2 \\right )^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\mathcal{F}f \\right ]  \\right \\|_{L^p(\\R^n)}.</math>\n\nThis motivates Sobolev spaces with non-integer order since in the above definition we can replace ''k'' by any real number ''s''. The resulting spaces\n\n:<math>H^{s,p}(\\R^n) := \\left \\{f \\in L^p(\\R^n) : \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\left [\\left (1+ |\\xi|^2 \\right )^{\\frac{s}{2}}\\mathcal{F}f \\right ] \\in L^p(\\R^n) \\right \\} </math>\n\nare called Bessel potential spaces<ref>Bessel potential spaces with variable integrability have been independently introduced by Almeida & Samko (A.

Roughly speaking, sufficiently many weak derivatives or large ''p'' result in a classical derivative. This idea is generalized and made precise in the [[Sobolev inequality|Sobolev embedding theorem]].\n\nWrite <math>W^{k,p}</math> for the Sobolev space of some compact Riemannian manifold of dimension ''n''. Here ''k'' can be any real number, and 1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;∞. (For ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;∞ the Sobolev space <math>W^{k,\\infty}</math> is defined to be the [[Hölder space]] ''C''<sup>''n'',α</sup> where ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;α and 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;α&nbsp;≤&nbsp;1.) The Sobolev embedding theorem states that if <math>k \\geqslant m</math> and <math>k - \\tfrac{n}{p} \\geqslant m - \\tfrac{n}{q}</math> then\n\n:<math>W^{k,p}\\subseteq W^{m,q}</math>\n\nand the embedding is continuous. Moreover, if <math>k > m</math> and <math>k - \\tfrac{n}{p} > m - \\tfrac{n}{q}</math> then the embedding is completely continuous (this is sometimes called '''Kondrachov's theorem''' or the '''Rellich-Kondrachov theorem'''). Functions in <math>W^{m,\\infty}</math> have all derivatives of order less than ''m'' continuous, so in particular this gives conditions on Sobolev spaces for various derivatives to be continuous. Informally these embeddings say that to convert an ''L<sup>p</sup>'' estimate to a boundedness estimate costs 1/''p'' derivatives per dimension.\n\nThere are similar variations of the embedding theorem for non-compact manifolds such as <math>\\R^n</math> {{harv|Stein|1970}}. Sobolev embeddings on <math>\\R^n</math> that are not compact often have a related, but weaker,  property of [[Cocompact embedding|cocompactness]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n| last1=Adams\n| first1=Robert A.\n| last2=Fournier\n| first2=John \n| title=Sobolev Spaces\n| series=Pure and Applied Mathematics\n| volume=140\n| edition=2nd\n| publisher=[[Academic Press]]\n| location=Boston, MA\n| isbn=978-0-12-044143-3\n| year=2003\n| origyear=1975}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Aubin | first1=Thierry | title=Nonlinear analysis on manifolds.

In the parlance of [[differential form]]s, this is saying that {{math|''f''(''x'')&thinsp;''dx''}} is the [[exterior derivative]] of the 0-form, i.e. function, {{mvar|F}}: in other words, that {{math|1=''dF'' = ''f''&thinsp;''dx''}}. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms {{mvar|ω}} instead of just 0-forms such as {{mvar|F}}.\n* A closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a simple example of a one-dimensional [[manifold with boundary]].  Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. Integrating {{mvar|f}} over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be [[orientable]], and the form has to be [[compact support|compactly supported]] in order to give a well-defined integral.\n* The two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds {{mvar|M}} with boundary. The boundary {{math|∂''M''}} of {{mvar|M}} is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of {{mvar|M}}. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, {{mvar|a}} inherits the opposite orientation as {{mvar|b}}, as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, \"integrating\" {{mvar|F}} over two boundary points {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} is taking the difference {{math|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}}.\nIn even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral ({{math|1=''f''&thinsp;''dx'' = ''dF''}}) over a 1-dimensional manifold ({{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}) by considering the anti-derivative ({{mvar|F}}) at the 0-dimensional boundaries ({{math|{''a'', ''b''}|}}), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals ({{mvar|dω}}) over {{mvar|n}}-dimensional manifolds ({{math|Ω}}) by considering the antiderivative ({{mvar|ω}}) at the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional boundaries ({{math|∂Ω}}) of the manifold.\n\nSo the fundamental theorem reads:\n:<math>\\int_{[a, b]} f(x)\\,dx = \\int_{[a, b]} dF = \\int_{\\{a\\}^- \\cup \\{b\\}^+} F = F(b) - F(a)\\,.</math>\n\n==Formulation for smooth manifolds with boundary==\nLet {{math|Ω}} be an oriented [[smooth manifold]] with boundary of [[dimension]] {{mvar|n}} and let {{mvar|α}} be a [[smooth function|smooth]] {{mvar|n}}-[[differential form]] that is [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|compactly supported]] on {{math|Ω}}. First, suppose that {{mvar|α}} is compactly supported in the domain of a single, [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[coordinate chart]] {{math|{''U'', ''φ''}|}}. In this case, we define the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} as\n\n:<math>\\int_\\Omega \\alpha = \\int_{\\varphi(U)} \\left(\\varphi^{-1}\\right)^* \\alpha\\,,</math>\n\ni.e., via the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of {{mvar|α}} to {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nMore generally, the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} is defined as follows: Let {{math|{''ψ<sub>i</sub>''}|}} be a [[partition of unity]] associated with a [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] [[cover (topology)|cover]] {{math|{''U<sub>i</sub>'', ''φ<sub>i</sub>''}|}} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral\n\n:<math>\\int_\\Omega \\alpha \\equiv \\sum_i \\int_{U_i} \\psi_i \\alpha\\,,</math>\n\nwhere each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} as described above.  This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.\n\nThe generalized Stokes theorem reads:\n\n{{quotebox|align=center|quote='''Theorem.''' ''(Stokes–Cartan) If <math>\\omega</math> is a [[infinitely differentiable|smooth]] <math>(n-1)</math>-[[differential form|form]] with [[compact support]] on smooth <math>n</math>-dimensional [[manifold|manifold-with-boundary]] <math>\\Omega</math>, <math>\\partial\\Omega</math> denotes the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of <math>\\Omega</math> given the induced [[orientation (mathematics)#Geometric algebra|orientation]], and <math>i:\\partial \\Omega\\hookrightarrow \\Omega</math> is the [[inclusion map]], then\n\n:<math>\\int_\\Omega d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} i^*\\omega</math>.''}}\n\nConventionally, <math display=\"inline\">\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} i^*\\omega</math> is abbreviated as <math display=\"inline\">\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\omega</math>, since the pullback of a differential form by the inclusion map is simply its restriction to its domain: <math>i^*\\omega=\\omega|_{\\partial\\Omega}</math>.

That is, in a thermodynamic application, where {{mvar|U}} is a function of the temperature {{math|''α''<sub>1</sub> :{{=}} ''T''}}, the volume {{math|''α''<sub>2</sub> :{{=}} ''V''}}, and the electrical polarization {{math|''α''<sub>3</sub> :{{=}} ''P''}} of the sample, one has\n:<math>\\{d_\\text{total}U\\}=\\sum_{i=1}^3\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial\\alpha_i}\\,d\\alpha_i\\,,</math>\nand the circle is really necessary, e.g. if one considers the ''differential'' consequences of the ''integral'' postulate\n:<math>\\oint_W\\,\\{d_\\text{total}U\\}\\, \\stackrel{!}{=}\\,0\\,.</math></ref> (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>\\Omega</math>, application of the theorem twice gives <math display=\"inline\">\\int_{\\partial(\\partial \\Omega)}\\omega=\\int_\\Omega d(d\\omega)=0</math> for any <math>(n-2)</math>-form <math>\\omega</math>, which implies that <math>\\partial(\\partial\\Omega)=\\emptyset</math>.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate ''integral'' laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent ''differential'' formulations (see below).\n\nThe theorem is often used in situations where <math>\\Omega</math> is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often <math>\\mathbf{R}^k</math>, on which the form <math>\\omega</math> is defined.\n\n==Topological preliminaries; integration over chains==\n\nLet {{mvar|M}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A (smooth) singular [[Simplex|{{mvar|k}}-simplex]] in {{mvar|M}} is defined as a [[smooth map]] from the standard simplex in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>}} to {{mvar|M}}. The group {{math|''C''<sub>''k''</sub>(''M'', '''Z''')}} of singular {{mvar|k}}-[[chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] on {{mvar|M}} is defined to be the [[free abelian group]] on the set of singular {{mvar|k}}-simplices in {{mvar|M}}. These groups, together with the boundary map, {{math|∂}}, define a [[chain complex]]. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual [[singular homology]] group {{math|''H''<sub>''k''</sub>(''M'', '''Z''')}} (resp. the [[singular cohomology]] group {{math|''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'', '''Z''')}}), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in {{mvar|M}}.\n\nOn the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the [[de Rham cohomology]] groups {{math|''H''{{su|p=''k''|b=''dR''}}(''M'', '''R''')}}.\n\nDifferential {{mvar|k}}-forms can be integrated over a {{mvar|k}}-simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>}}. Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of {{mvar|k}}-forms to the {{mvar|k}}th group of singular cochains, {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''(''M'', '''Z''')}}, the linear functionals on {{math|''C<sub>k</sub>''(''M'', '''Z''')}}. In other words, a {{mvar|k}}-form {{mvar|ω}} defines a functional\n\n:<math>I(\\omega)(c) = \\oint_c \\omega</math>\n\non the {{mvar|k}}-chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, behaves like the ''dual'' of {{math|∂}} on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:\n\n#closed forms, i.e., {{math|''dω'' {{=}} 0}}, have zero integral over ''boundaries'', i.e. over manifolds that can be written as {{math|∂∑<sub>''c''</sub> ''M<sub>c</sub>''}}, and\n#exact forms, i.e., {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ''dσ''}}, have zero integral over ''cycles'', i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: {{math|∑<sub>''c''</sub> ''M<sub>c</sub>'' {{=}} ∅}}.\n\n[[De Rham's theorem]] shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if {{math|{''c<sub>i</sub>''}|}} are cycles generating the {{mvar|k}}th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, {{math|{''a<sub>i</sub>''}|}}, there exist a closed form, {{mvar|ω}}, such that\n\n:<math>\\oint_{c_i} \\omega = a_i\\,,</math>\n\nand this form is unique up to exact forms.\n\nStokes' theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes' theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manifolds, Tensors, and Forms|last=Renteln|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107324893|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=158–175}}</ref>  Formally stated, the latter reads:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Smooth Manifolds|last=Lee|first=John M.|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781441999818|location=New York|pages=481}}</ref>\n\n{{quotebox|quote='''Theorem.'''

The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, [[simplex|simplices]]), which usually is not difficult.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Generalization to rough sets==\n[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|upright|180px|A region (here called {{mvar|D}} instead of {{math|Ω}}) with piecewise smooth boundary.  This is a [[manifold with corners]], so its boundary is not a smooth manifold.]]\n\nThe formulation above, in which {{math|Ω}} is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications.  For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two {{mvar|x}}-coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners.  In such a case, the corner points mean that {{math|Ω}} is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply.  Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true.  This is because {{math|Ω}} and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a [[measure zero]] set).\n\nA version of Stokes' theorem that extends to rough domains was proved by Whitney.<ref>Whitney, ''Geometric Integration Theory,'' III.14.</ref>  Assume that {{mvar|D}} is a connected bounded open subset of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.  Call {{mvar|D}} a ''standard domain'' if it satisfies the following property: There exists a subset {{mvar|P}} of {{math|∂''D''}}, open in {{math|∂''D''}}, whose complement in {{math|∂''D''}} has [[Hausdorff measure|Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure]] zero; and such that every point of {{mvar|P}} has a ''generalized normal vector''.  This is a vector {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around {{mvar|x}}, there exists a smooth function {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} such that {{mvar|P}} is the graph {{math|{ ''x''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) }|}} and {{mvar|D}} is the region {{math|{ ''x''<sub>1</sub> < ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) }|}}.  Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure and a finite or countable union of smooth {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side.  He then proves that if {{mvar|D}} is a standard domain in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, {{mvar|ω}} is an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on {{math|''D'' ∪ ''P''}}, smooth on {{mvar|D}}, integrable on {{mvar|P}}, and such that {{mvar|dω}} is integrable on {{mvar|D}}, then Stokes' theorem holds, that is,\n:<math>\\int_P \\omega = \\int_D d\\omega\\,.</math>\n\nThe study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to [[geometric measure theory]].  Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=J.|title=Stokes' theorem for nonsmooth chains|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |series=New Series|volume=29|issue=2|date=October 1993}}</ref>\n\n==Special cases==\nThe general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using [[Cartesian coordinates]] without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.\n\n===Kelvin–Stokes theorem===\n[[Image:Stokes' Theorem.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, with surface {{math|Σ}}, its boundary {{math|∂Σ}} and the \"normal\" vector {{mvar|n}}.]]\n\nThis is a (dualized) (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about [[vector field]]s). This special case is often just referred to as ''Stokes' theorem'' in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the '''[[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]''' theorem.\n\nThe classical [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] over a surface {{math|Σ}} in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, {{math|∂Σ}}, must have positive [[curve orientation|orientation]], meaning that {{math|∂Σ}} points counterclockwise when the [[normal (geometry)|surface normal]], {{math|'''n'''}}, points toward the viewer.\n\nOne consequence of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem is that the [[field line]]s of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as:\n\n<div align=left>\n<div class=\"messagebox standard-talk NavFrame\"><div align=left>\nSuppose {{math|1='''F'''=(''P''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''Q''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''R''(''x'',''y'',''z''))}} is defined in region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}} and has first-order continuous [[partial derivatives]].

      "title": "Volume form",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=Ω<sup>''n''</sup>(''M'') = &#x22C0;<sup>''n''</sup>(''T''<sup>∗</sup>''M'')}}.  A manifold admits a nowhere vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].\n\nA volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.\n\n[[Kähler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the ''n''th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.\n\n== Orientation ==\nA manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on ''M''.  A volume form ''ω'' on ''M'' gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on ''M'' that send ''ω'' to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math>.\n\nA volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on ''M''. Call a basis of tangent vectors (''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>) right-handed if\n\n:<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) > 0.</math>\n\nThe collection of all right-handed frames is [[Group action (mathematics)|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'') of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in ''n'' dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'') sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of ''M'', and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of ''M'' to a sub-bundle with structure group GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'').  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structure]] on ''M''.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) = 1.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nThus a volume form gives rise to an SL(''n'')-structure as well.  Conversely, given an SL(''n'')-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required ''n''-form ''ω'' by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.\n\nA manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, {{nowrap|SL(''n'') → GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')}} is a [[deformation retract]] since {{nowrap|1=GL<sup>+</sup> = SL × '''R'''<sup>+</sup>}}, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structure is reducible to an SL(''n'')-structure, and GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structures coincide with orientations on ''M''.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle <math>\\Omega^n(M)</math> is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.\n\n== Relation to measures ==\n{{See also|Density on a manifold}}\nGiven a volume form ''ω'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''ω''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.\n\nAny volume pseudo-form ''ω'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by\n:<math>\\mu_\\omega(U)=\\int_U\\omega .</math>\n\nThe difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing <math>\\int_b^a f\\,dx = -\\int_a^b f\\,dx</math> considers <math>dx</math> as a volume form, not simply a measure, and <math>\\int_b^a</math> indicates \"integrate over the cell <math>[a,b]</math> with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted <math>\\overline{[a,b]}</math>\".\n\nFurther, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].\n\n==Divergence==\nGiven a volume form ''ω'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&nbsp;''X'', satisfying\n\n:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>\n\nwhere ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies\n\n:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>\n\nwhich is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].\n\nThe [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.\n\n==Special cases==\n\n=== Lie groups ===\n\nFor any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].\n\n=== Symplectic manifolds ===\n\nAny [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].\n\n=== Riemannian volume form ===\n\nAny [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.\n\nThe volume form is denoted variously by\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\mathrm{vol}_n = \\varepsilon = {\\star}(1) .</math>\n\nHere, the {{math|⋆}} is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, {{math|⋆(1)}}, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''ε''.\n\nAlthough the Greek letter ''ω'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''ω'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).\n\n==Invariants of a volume form==\nVolume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form <math>\\omega</math>, \n<math>f\\omega</math> is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms <math>\\omega, \\omega'</math>, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).\n\nIn coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of <math>\\omega'</math> with respect to <math>\\omega</math>.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].\n\n===No local structure===\nA volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math> along ''&phi;''.\n\nAs a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms <math>\\omega_M, \\omega_N</math>, then for any points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math>, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map <math>f\\colon U \\to V</math> such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': <math>f^*\\omega_N\\vert_V = \\omega_M\\vert_U</math>.\n\nIn one dimension, one can prove it thus:\ngiven a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>, define\n:<math>f(x) := \\int_0^x \\omega.</math>\nThen the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>dx</math> [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to <math>\\omega</math> under ''f'': <math>\\omega = f^*dx</math>. Concretely, <math>\\omega = f'\\,dx</math>.  In higher dimensions, given any point <math>m \\in M</math>, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{R}\\times\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}</math>, and one can apply the same procedure.\n\n===Global structure: volume===\nA volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted <math>\\mu(M)</math>), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.\n\nIn symbols, if <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back <math>\\omega_N</math> to <math>\\omega_M</math>, then\n\n: <math>\\mu(N)=\\int_N \\omega_N = \\int_{f(M)} \\omega_N = \\int_M f^*\\omega_N = \\int_M \\omega_M=\\mu(M)\\,</math>\n\nand the manifolds have the same volume.\n\nVolume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to S^1</math>), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.\n\n==See also==\n* {{section link|Cylindrical coordinate system|Line and volume elements}}\n* [[Measure (mathematics)]]\n* [[Poincaré metric]] provides a review of the volume form on the [[complex plane]]\n* {{section link|Spherical coordinate system|Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | first = S. | last = Kobayashi | title = Transformation Groups in Differential Geometry | series = Classics in Mathematics | publisher = Springer | year = 1972 | isbn = 3-540-58659-8 | oclc = 31374337}}.\n* {{citation|first=Michael|last=Spivak|authorlink=Michael Spivak|title=Calculus on Manifolds|year=1965|publisher=W.A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Choquet theory''', named after [[Gustave Choquet]], is an area of [[functional analysis]] and [[convex analysis]] concerned with [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] which have [[support (mathematics)|support]] on the [[extreme points]] of a [[convex set]] ''C''. Roughly speaking, every [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of ''C'' should appear as a weighted average of extreme points, a concept made more precise by generalizing the notion of weighted average from a [[convex combination]] to an [[integral]] taken over the set ''E'' of extreme points. Here ''C'' is a subset of a [[real vector space]] ''V'', and the main thrust of the theory is to treat the cases where ''V'' is an infinite-dimensional (locally convex Hausdorff) [[topological vector space]] along lines similar to the finite-dimensional case. The main concerns of Gustave Choquet were in [[potential theory]]. Choquet theory has become a general paradigm, particularly for treating [[convex cone]]s as determined by their extreme [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]], and so for many different notions of ''positivity'' in mathematics.\n\nThe two ends of a [[line segment]] determine the points in between: in vector terms the segment from ''v'' to ''w'' consists of the λ''v'' + (1 &minus; λ)''w'' with 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. The classical result of [[Hermann Minkowski]] says that in [[Euclidean space]], a [[bounded set|bounded]], [[closed set|closed]] [[convex set]] ''C'' is the [[convex hull]] of its extreme point set ''E'', so that any ''c'' in ''C'' is a (finite) [[convex combination]] of points ''e'' of ''E''. Here ''E'' may be a finite or an [[infinite set]]. In vector terms, by assigning non-negative weights ''w''(''e'') to the ''e'' in ''E'', [[almost all]] 0, we can represent any ''c'' in ''C'' as\n\n:<math> c = \\sum_{e\\in E} w(e) e\\ </math>\n\nwith \n\n:<math> \\sum_{e\\in E} w(e) = 1.\\ </math>\n\nIn any case the ''w''(''e'') give a [[probability measure]] supported on a finite subset of ''E''. For any [[affine function]] ''f'' on ''C'', its value at the point ''c'' is \n\n:<math>f (c) = \\int f(e) d w(e).</math>\n\nIn the infinite dimensional setting, one would like to make a similar statement.\n\n'''Choquet's theorem''' states that for a [[compact set|compact]] convex subset ''C'' of a [[normed space]] ''V'', given ''c'' in ''C'' there exists a [[probability measure]] ''w'' supported on the set ''E'' of extreme points of ''C'' such that, for any affine function ''f'' on ''C,'' \n\n:<math>f (c) = \\int f(e) d w(e).</math> \n\nIn practice ''V'' will be a [[Banach space]]. The original [[Krein–Milman theorem]] follows from Choquet's result. Another corollary is the [[Riesz representation theorem]] for [[state (functional analysis)|states]] on the continuous functions on a metrizable compact Hausdorff space.\n\nMore generally, for ''V'' a [[locally convex topological vector space]], the '''Choquet–Bishop–de Leeuw theorem'''<ref>[[Errett Bishop]]; [[Karel deLeeuw|Karl de Leeuw]]. [http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/AIF/AIF_1959__9_/AIF_1959__9__305_0/AIF_1959__9__305_0.pdf \"The representations of linear functionals by measures on sets of extreme points\"]. Annales de l'institut Fourier, 9 (1959), pp. 305–331.</ref> gives the same formal statement.\n\nIn addition to the existence of a probability measure supported on the extreme boundary that represents a given point ''c'', one might also consider the uniqueness of such measures. It is easy to see that uniqueness does not hold even in the finite dimensional setting. One can take, for counterexamples, the convex set to be a [[cube]] or a ball in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Uniqueness does hold, however, when the convex set is a finite dimensional [[simplex]]. A finite dimensional simplex is a special case of a '''Choquet simplex'''. Any point in a Choquet simplex is represented by a unique probability measure on the extreme points.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)|Carathéodory's theorem]]\n* [[Shapley–Folkman lemma]]\n* [[Krein–Milman theorem]]\n* [[Helly's theorem]]\n* [[List of convexity topics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite book|last1=Asimow|first1=L.|last2=Ellis|first2=A.

De Finetti's theorem explains a mathematical relationship between independence and exchangeability.<ref>See the Oxford lecture notes of Steffen Lauritzen  http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~steffen/teaching/grad/definetti.pdf</ref>\n\nAn infinite sequence\n\n:<math>X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots </math>\n\nof random variables is said to be exchangeable if for any finite [[cardinal number]] ''n'' and any two finite sequences ''i''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''i''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''j''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''j''<sub>''n''</sub> (with each of the ''i''s distinct, and each of the ''j''s distinct), the two sequences\n\n:<math>X_{i_1},\\dots,X_{i_n} \\text{ and } X_{j_1},\\dots,X_{j_n} </math>\n\nboth have the same [[joint probability distribution]].\n\nIf an identically distributed sequence is [[statistical independence|independent]], then the sequence is exchangeable; however, the converse is false—there exist exchangeable random variables that are not statistically independent, for example the [[Pólya urn model]].\n\n== Statement of the theorem ==\n\nA [[random variable]] ''X'' has a [[Bernoulli distribution]] if Pr(''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and Pr(''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''p'' for some ''p''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;1).\n\nDe Finetti's theorem states that the probability distribution of any infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables is a \"mixture\" of the probability distributions of independent and identically distributed sequences of Bernoulli random variables.  \"Mixture\", in this sense, means a weighted average, but this need not mean a finite or countably infinite (i.e., discrete) weighted average: it can be an integral rather than a sum.\n\nMore precisely, suppose ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... is an infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli-distributed random variables.  Then there is some probability distribution ''m'' on the interval [0,&nbsp;1] and some random variable ''Y'' such that\n* The probability distribution of ''Y'' is ''m'', and\n* The [[conditional probability distribution]] of the whole sequence ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... given the value of ''Y'' is described by saying that\n** ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... are [[conditional independence|conditionally independent]] given ''Y'', and\n** For any ''i'' ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...}, the conditional probability that ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1, given the value of ''Y'', is ''Y''.\n\n=== Another way of stating the theorem ===\n\nSuppose <math>X_1,X_2,X_3,\\ldots</math> is an infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables.  Then <math>X_1,X_2,X_3,\\ldots</math> are conditionally independent and identically distributed given the [[exchangeable sigma-algebra]] (i.e., the sigma-algebra of events measurable with respect to <math>X_1,X_2,\\ldots</math> and invariant under finite permutations of the indices).\n\n== Example ==\n\nHere is a concrete example. We construct a sequence\n\n:<math>X_1, X_2, X_3, \\dots </math>\n\nof random variables, by \"mixing\" two i.i.d. sequences as follows.\n\nWe assume ''p'' = 2/3 with probability 1/2 and ''p'' = 9/10 with probability 1/2. Given the event ''p'' = 2/3, the conditional distribution of the sequence is that the ''X''<sub>i</sub> are independent and identically distributed and ''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 with probability 2/3 and ''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with probability 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2/3.  Given the event  ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;9/10, the conditional distribution of the sequence is that the ''X''<sub>i</sub> are independent and identically distributed and ''X''<sub>1</sub> = 1 with probability 9/10 and ''X''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with probability 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;9/10.  \n\nThe independence asserted here is ''conditional'' independence, i.e. the Bernoulli random variables in the sequence are conditionally independent given the event that ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2/3, and are conditionally independent given the event that ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;9/10. But they are not unconditionally independent; they are positively [[correlation|correlated]]. \n\nIn view of the [[law of large numbers|strong law of large numbers]], we can say that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{X_1+\\cdots+X_n}{n} = \\begin{cases}\n2/3 & \\text{with probability }1/2, \\\\\n9/10 & \\text{with probability }1/2.\n\\end{cases} </math>\n\nRather than concentrating probability 1/2 at each of two points between 0 and 1, the \"mixing distribution\" can be any [[probability distribution]] supported on the interval from 0 to 1; which one it is depends on the joint distribution of the infinite sequence of Bernoulli random variables.\n\nThe definition of exchangeability, and the statement of the theorem, also makes sense for finite length sequences\n\n:<math>X_1,\\dots, X_n,</math>\n\nbut the theorem is not generally true in that case.  It is true if the sequence can be extended to an exchangeable sequence that is infinitely long.  The simplest example of an exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables that cannot be so extended is the one in which ''X''<sub>1</sub> = 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''X''<sub>2</sub> and ''X''<sub>1</sub> is either 0 or 1, each with probability 1/2.  This sequence is exchangeable, but cannot be extended to an exchangeable sequence of length 3, let alone an infinitely long one.\n\n== Extensions ==\nVersions of de&nbsp;Finetti's theorem for  ''finite'' exchangeable sequences,<ref>{{cite journal\n |first=P. |last=Diaconis |authorlink=Persi Diaconis\n |first2=D. |last2=Freedman |authorlink2=David A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]] (specifically in [[measure theory]]), a '''Radon measure''', named after [[Johann Radon]], is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the [[sigma algebra|&sigma;-algebra]] of [[Borel set]]s of a [[Hausdorff topological space]] ''X'' that is finite on all compact sets, [[Outer regular measure|outer regular]] on all Borel sets, and [[Inner regular measure|inner regular]] on open sets.<ref>{{cite book |last=Folland |first=Gerald |date=1999 |title=Real Analysis: Modern techniques and their applications |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-31716-0 |page=212 }}</ref> These conditions guarantee that the measure is  \"compatible\" with the topology of the space, and most measures used in [[mathematical analysis]] and in [[number theory]] are indeed Radon measures.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nA common problem is to find a good notion of a measure on a [[topological space]] that is compatible with the topology in some sense. One way to do this is to define a measure on the [[Borel set]]s of the topological space. In general there are several problems with this: for example, such a measure may not have a well defined [[support (measure theory)|support]]. Another approach to measure theory is to restrict to [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s, and only consider the measures that correspond to positive [[linear functional]]s on the space of [[continuous function]]s with compact support (some authors use this as the definition of a Radon measure). This produces a good theory with no pathological problems, but does not apply to spaces that are not locally compact. If there is no restriction to non-negative measures and complex measures are allowed, then Radon measures can be defined as the continuous dual space on the space of [[continuous function]]s with compact support. If such a Radon measure is real then it can be decomposed into the difference of two positive measures. Furthermore, an arbitrary Radon measure can be decomposed into four positive Radon measures, where the real and imaginary parts of the functional are each the differences of two positive Radon measures.\n\nThe theory of Radon measures has most of the good properties of the usual theory for locally compact spaces, but applies to all Hausdorff topological spaces. The idea of the definition of a Radon measure is to find some properties that characterize the measures on locally compact spaces corresponding to positive functionals, and use these properties as the definition of a Radon measure on an arbitrary Hausdorff space.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nLet ''m'' be a measure on the ''&sigma;''-algebra of Borel sets of a Hausdorff topological space ''X''.\n\nThe measure ''m'' is called '''[[inner regular measure|inner regular]]''' or '''tight''' if, for any open set ''U'', ''m''(''U'') is the [[supremum]] of ''m''(''K'') over all compact subsets ''K'' of ''U''.\n\nThe measure ''m'' is called '''[[regular measure|outer regular]]''' if, for any Borel set ''B'', ''m''(''B'') is the [[infimum]] of ''m''(''U'') over all open sets ''U'' containing ''B''.\n\nThe measure ''m'' is called '''[[locally finite measure|locally finite]]''' if every point of ''X'' has a neighborhood ''U'' for which ''m''(''U'') is finite.\n\nIf ''m'' is locally finite, then it follows that ''m'' is finite on compact sets, and for locally compact Hausdorff spaces, the converse holds, too.<br>\nThus, in this case, local finiteness may be equivalently replaced by finiteness on compact subsets.\n\nThe measure ''m'' is called a '''Radon measure''' if it is inner regular, outer regular and locally finite.\n\n(It is possible to extend the theory of Radon measures to non-Hausdorff spaces, essentially by replacing the word \"compact\" by \"closed compact\" everywhere. However, there seem to be almost no applications of this extension.)\n\n==Radon measures on locally compact spaces==\n\nWhen the underlying measure space is a [[locally compact]] topological space, the definition of a Radon measure can be expressed in terms of [[continuous function|continuous]] [[linear map|linear]] functionals on the space of [[continuous function]]s  with [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]]. This makes it possible to develop measure and integration in terms of [[functional analysis]], an approach taken by {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|2004}} and a number of other authors.\n\n===Measures===\n\nIn what follows ''X'' denotes a locally compact topological space. The continuous [[real-valued function]]s with [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]] on ''X'' form a [[vector space]] <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)=C_C(X)</math>, which can be given a natural [[locally convex space|locally convex]] topology. Indeed, <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math> is the union of the spaces <math>\\mathcal{K}(X,K)</math> of continuous functions with support contained in [[compact space|compact]] sets ''K''. Each of the spaces <math>\\mathcal{K}(X,K)</math> carries naturally the topology of [[uniform convergence]], which makes it into a [[Banach space]]. But as a union of topological spaces is a special case of a [[direct limit]] of topological spaces, the space <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math> can be equipped with the direct limit [[Locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] topology induced by the spaces <math>\\mathcal{K}(X,K)</math>; this topology is finer than the topology of uniform convergence.\n\nIf ''m'' is a Radon measure on <math>X,</math> then the mapping\n\n:: <math> I : f \\mapsto \\int f\\, dm </math>\n\nis a ''continuous'' positive linear map from <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math> to '''R'''.  Positivity means that ''I''(''f'')&nbsp;≥&nbsp;0 whenever ''f'' is a non-negative function.  Continuity with respect to the direct limit topology defined above is equivalent to the following condition: for every compact subset ''K'' of ''X'' there exists a constant ''M''<sub>''K''</sub> such that, for every continuous real-valued function ''f'' on ''X'' with ''support contained in K'',\n\n:: <math> |I(f)| \\leq M_K  \\sup_{x\\in X} |f(x)|. </math>\n \nConversely, by the [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]], each ''positive'' linear form on <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math> arises as integration with respect to a unique regular Borel measure.\n\nA '''real-valued Radon measure''' is defined to be ''any'' continuous linear form on <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math>; they are precisely the differences of  two Radon measures. This gives an identification of real-valued Radon measures with the [[dual space]] of the [[locally convex space]] <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math>. These real-valued Radon measures need not be [[signed measure]]s. For example, sin(''x'')d''x'' is a real-valued Radon measure,  but is not even an extended signed measure as it cannot be written as the difference of two measures at least one of which is finite.\n\nSome authors use the preceding approach to define (positive) Radon measures to be the positive linear forms on <math>\\mathcal{K}(X)</math>; see {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|2004}}, {{harvtxt|Hewitt|Stromberg|1965}} or {{harvtxt|Dieudonné|1970}}. In this set-up it is common to use a terminology in which Radon measures in the above sense are called ''positive'' measures and real-valued Radon measures as above are called (real) measures.\n\n===Integration===\n\nTo complete the buildup of measure theory for locally compact spaces from the functional-analytic viewpoint, it is necessary to extend measure (integral) from compactly supported continuous functions. This can be done for real or complex-valued functions in several steps as follows:\n# Definition of the '''upper integral''' ''μ''*(''g'') of a [[lower semicontinuous]] positive (real-valued) function ''g'' as the [[supremum]] (possibly infinite) of the positive numbers ''μ''(''h'') for compactly supported continuous functions ''h''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''g''\n# Definition of the upper integral ''μ''*(''f'') for an arbitrary positive (real-valued) function ''f'' as the infimum of upper integrals ''μ''*(''g'') for lower semi-continuous functions ''g''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''f''\n# Definition of the vector space ''F'' =&nbsp;''F''(''X'',&nbsp;''μ'') as the space of all functions ''f'' on X for which the upper integral ''μ''*(|''f''|) of the absolute value is finite; the upper integral of the absolute value defines a [[semi-norm]] on ''F'', and ''F'' is a [[complete space]] with respect to the topology defined by the semi-norm\n# Definition of the space ''L''<sup>1</sup>(''X'',&nbsp;''μ'') of '''integrable functions''' as the [[closure (topology)|closure]] inside ''F'' of the space of continuous compactly supported functions\n# Definition of the '''integral''' for functions in ''L''<sup>1</sup>(''X'',&nbsp;''μ'') as extension by continuity (after verifying that ''μ'' is continuous with respect to the topology of ''L''<sup>1</sup>(''X'',&nbsp;''μ''))\n# Definition of the measure of a set as the integral (when it exists) of the [[indicator function]] of the set.\n\nIt is possible to verify that these steps produce a theory identical with the one that starts from a Radon measure defined as a function that assigns a number to each [[Borel set]] of&nbsp;''X''.\n\nThe [[Lebesgue measure]] on '''R''' can be introduced by a few ways in this functional-analytic set-up. First, it is possibly to rely on an \"elementary\" integral such as the [[Daniell integral]] or the [[Riemann integral]] for integrals of continuous functions with compact support, as these are integrable for all the elementary definitions of integrals. The measure (in the sense defined above) defined by elementary integration is precisely the Lebesgue measure. Second, if one wants to avoid reliance on Riemann or Daniell integral or other similar theories, it is possible to develop first the general theory of [[Haar measure]]s and define the Lebesgue measure as the Haar measure ''λ'' on '''R''' that satisfies the normalisation condition&nbsp;''λ''([0,1])&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe following are all examples of Radon measures:\n* [[Lebesgue measure]] on Euclidean space (restricted to the Borel subsets);\n* [[Haar measure]] on any [[locally compact topological group]];\n* [[Dirac measure]] on any topological space;\n* [[Gaussian measure]] on [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> with its Borel sigma algebra;\n* [[Probability measure]]s on the σ-algebra of [[Borel set]]s of any [[Polish space]]. This example not only generalizes the previous example, but includes many measures on non-locally compact spaces, such as [[Wiener measure]] on the space of real-valued continuous functions on the interval [0,1].\n* A measure on <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is a Radon measure if and only if it is a [[Locally finite measure|locally finite]] [[Borel measure]].\n\nThe following are not examples of Radon measures:\n*[[Counting measure]] on Euclidean space is an example of a measure that is not a Radon measure, since it is not locally finite.\n*The space of [[ordinal number|ordinals]] at most equal to the [[first uncountable ordinal]] with the [[order topology]] is a compact topological space.  The measure which equals 1 on any set that contains an uncountable closed set, and 0 otherwise, is Borel but not Radon.\n* Let ''X'' be the interval [0,&nbsp;1) equipped with the topology generated by the collection of half open intervals <math>\\{ [a,b): 0\\leq a< b\\leq 1\\}</math>. This topology is sometimes called [[Sorgenfrey line]]. On this topological space, standard Lebesgue measure is not Radon since it is not inner regular, since compact sets are at most countable.\n* Let ''Z'' be a [[Bernstein set]] in <math>[0,1]</math> (or any Polish space). Then no measure which vanishes at points on ''Z'' is a Radon measure, since any compact set in ''Z'' is countable.\n* Standard [[product measure]] on <math>(0,1)^\\kappa</math> for uncountable <math>\\kappa</math> is not a Radon measure, since any compact set is contained within a product of uncountably many closed intervals, each of which is shorter than 1.\n\n==Basic properties==\n\n===Moderated Radon measures===\nGiven a Radon measure ''m'' on a space ''X'', we can define another measure ''M'' (on the Borel sets) by putting\n\n:<math>M(B) = \\inf\\{ m(V) \\mid V \\text{ is an open set with } B \\subseteq V \\subseteq X \\} .</math>\n\nThe measure ''M'' is outer regular, and locally finite, and inner regular for open sets. It coincides with ''m'' on compact and open sets, and ''m'' can be reconstructed from ''M'' as the unique inner regular measure that is the same as ''M'' on compact sets. The measure ''m'' is called '''moderated''' if ''M'' is &sigma;-finite; in this case the measures ''m'' and ''M'' are the same. (If ''m'' is &sigma;-finite this does not imply that ''M'' is &sigma;-finite, so being moderated is stronger than being &sigma;-finite.)\n\nOn a [[strongly Lindelöf space]] every Radon measure is moderated.\n\nAn example of a measure ''m'' that is σ-finite but not moderated is given by {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|2004|loc=Exercise 5 of section 1}} as follows. The topological space ''X'' has as underlying set the subset of the real plane given by the ''y''-axis of points (0,''y'') together with the points (1/''n'',''m''/''n''<sup>2</sup>) with ''m'',''n'' positive integers. The topology is given as follows. The single points (1/''n'',''m''/''n''<sup>2</sup>) are all open sets. A base of neighborhoods of the point (0,''y'') is given by wedges consisting of  all points in ''X'' of the form (''u'',''v'') with |''v''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''y''|&nbsp;≤&nbsp;|''u''|&nbsp;≤&nbsp;1/''n'' for a positive integer ''n''. This space ''X'' is locally compact. The measure ''m'' is given by letting the ''y''-axis have measure 0 and letting the point (1/''n'',''m''/''n''<sup>2</sup>) have measure 1/''n''<sup>3</sup>. This measure is inner regular and locally finite, but is not outer regular as any open set containing the ''y''-axis has measure infinity. In particular the ''y''-axis has ''m''-measure 0 but ''M''-measure infinity.\n\n===Radon spaces===\n{{main|Radon space}}\nA topological space is called a '''Radon space''' if every finite Borel measure is a Radon measure, and '''strongly Radon''' if every locally finite Borel measure is a Radon measure. Any [[Suslin space]] is strongly Radon, and moreover every Radon measure is moderated.\n\n===Duality===\n\nOn a locally compact Hausdorff space, Radon measures correspond to positive linear functionals on the space of continuous functions with compact support. This is not surprising as this property is the main motivation for the definition of Radon measure.\n\n===Metric space structure===\n\nThe [[Cone (linear algebra)|pointed cone]] <math>\\mathcal{M}_{+} (X)</math> of all (positive) Radon measures on <math>X</math> can be given the structure of a [[Complete space|complete]] [[metric space]] by defining the '''Radon distance''' between two measures <math>m_1, m_2 \\in \\mathcal{M}_{+} (X)</math> to be\n:<math>\\rho (m_{1}, m_{2}) := \\sup \\left\\{ \\left. \\int_{X} f(x) \\, d (m_1 - m_2) (x) \\ \\right| \\mathrm{continuous\\,} f : X \\to [-1, 1] \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThis metric has some limitations.

All [[Hilbert space]]s have the Radon–Nikodym property.\n\n==Radon–Nikodym derivative==\nThe function {{math| ''f'' }} satisfying the above equality is ''uniquely defined [[up to]] a {{mvar|μ}}-[[null set]]'', that is, if {{mvar|g}} is another function which satisfies the same property, then {{math| ''f'' {{=}} ''g'' }} {{mvar|μ}}-[[almost everywhere]]. {{math| ''f'' }} is commonly written <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}</math> and is called the '''Radon–Nikodym derivative'''. The choice of notation and the name of the function reflects the fact that the function is analogous to a [[derivative]] in [[calculus]] in the sense that it describes the rate of change of density of one measure with respect to another (the way the [[Jacobian determinant]] is used in multivariable integration). A similar theorem can be proven for [[signed measure|signed]] and [[complex measure]]s: namely, that if {{mvar|μ}} is a nonnegative σ-finite measure, and {{mvar|ν}} is a finite-valued signed or complex measure such that {{math|''ν'' ≪ ''μ''}}, i.e. {{mvar|ν}} is [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to {{mvar|μ}}, then there is a {{mvar|μ}}-integrable real- or complex-valued function {{mvar|g}} on {{mvar|X}} such that for every measurable set {{mvar|A}},\n:<math>\\nu(A) = \\int_A g \\, d\\mu.</math>\n\n== Examples ==\nIn the following examples, the set {{mvar|X}} is the real interval [0,1], and <math>\\mathit\\Sigma</math> is the Borel sigma-algebra on {{mvar|X}}.\n# <math>\\mu</math> is the length measure on {{mvar|X}}. <math>\\nu</math> assigns to each subset {{mvar|Y}} of {{mvar|X}}, twice the length of {{mvar|Y}}. Then, <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu} = 2</math>.\n# <math>\\mu</math> is the length measure on {{mvar|X}}. <math>\\nu</math> assigns to each subset {{mvar|Y}} of {{mvar|X}}, the number of points from the set {0.1, ..., 0.9} that are contained in {{mvar|Y}}. Then, <math>\\nu</math> is not absolutely-continuous with respect to <math>\\mu</math> since it assigns non-zero measure to zero-length points. Indeed, there is no derivative <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}</math>: there is no finite function that, when integrated e.g. from <math>(0.1 - \\epsilon)</math> to <math>(0.1 + \\epsilon)</math>, gives <math>1</math> for all <math>\\epsilon > 0</math>.\n# <math>\\mu = \\nu + \\delta_0</math>, where <math>\\nu</math> is the length measure on X and <math>\\delta_0</math> is the [[Dirac measure]] on 0 (it assigns a measure of 1 to any set containing 0 and a measure of 0 to any other set). Then, <math>\\nu</math> is absolutely continuous with respect to <math>\\mu</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu} = 1_{X\\setminus \\{0\\}}</math> – the derivative is 0 at <math>x = 0</math> and 1 at <math>x > 0</math>.<ref>{{cite web |title=Calculating Radon Nikodym derivative |date=April 7, 2018 |work=[[Stack Exchange]] |url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/588442/29780 }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe theorem is very important in extending the ideas of [[probability theory]] from probability masses and probability densities defined over real numbers to [[probability measure]]s defined over arbitrary sets. It tells if and how it is possible to change from one probability measure to another. Specifically, the [[probability density function]] of a [[random variable]] is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the induced measure with respect to some base measure (usually the [[Lebesgue measure]] for [[continuous random variable]]s).\n\nFor example, it can be used to prove the existence of [[conditional expectation]] for probability measures. The latter itself is a key concept in [[probability theory]], as [[conditional probability]] is just a special case of it.\n\nAmongst other fields, [[financial mathematics]] uses the theorem extensively. Such changes of probability measure are the cornerstone of the [[rational pricing]] of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and are used for converting actual probabilities into those of the [[risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probabilities]].\n\n==Properties==\n* Let ''ν'', ''μ'', and ''λ'' be σ-finite measures on the same measure space. If ''ν'' ≪ ''λ'' and ''μ'' ≪ ''λ'' (''ν'' and ''μ'' are both  [[Absolutely continuous#Absolute continuity of measures|absolutely continuous]] with respect to ''λ''), then\n*: <math> \\frac{d(\\nu+\\mu)}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\lambda}+\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\lambda} \\quad \\lambda\\text{-almost everywhere}.</math>\n* If ''ν ≪ μ ≪ λ'', then\n*: <math>\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\lambda}=\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\lambda}\\quad\\lambda\\text{-almost everywhere}.</math>\n* In particular, if ''μ'' ≪ ''ν'' and ''ν'' ≪ ''μ'', then\n*: <math> \\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}=\\left(\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\right)^{-1}\\quad\\nu\\text{-almost everywhere}.</math>\n* If ''μ'' ≪ ''λ'' and {{mvar|g}} is a ''μ''-integrable function, then\n*: <math> \\int_X g\\,d\\mu = \\int_X g\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\lambda}\\,d\\lambda.</math>\n* If ''ν'' is a finite signed or complex measure, then\n*: <math> {d|\\nu|\\over d\\mu} = \\left|{d\\nu\\over d\\mu}\\right|. </math>\n\n==Further applications==\n\n===Information divergences===\nIf ''μ'' and ''ν'' are measures over {{mvar|X}}, and ''μ ≪ ν''\n\n* The [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] from ''μ'' to ''ν'' is defined to be\n*: <math> D_\\text{KL}(\\mu \\parallel \\nu) = \\int_X \\log \\left( \\frac{d \\mu}{d \\nu} \\right) \\; d\\mu.</math>\n* For ''α > 0'', ''α ≠ 1'' the [[Renyi divergence|Rényi divergence]] of order ''α'' from ''μ'' to ''ν'' is defined to be\n*: <math>D_\\alpha(\\mu \\parallel \\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1} \\log\\left(\\int_X\\left(\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\right)^{\\alpha-1}\\; d\\mu\\right).</math>\n\n==The assumption of σ-finiteness==\nThe Radon–Nikodym theorem makes the assumption that the measure ''μ'' with respect to which one computes the rate of change of ''ν'' is σ-finite. Here is an example when ''μ'' is not σ-finite and the Radon–Nikodym theorem fails to hold.\n\nConsider the [[Borel algebra|Borel σ-algebra]] on the [[real line]]. Let the [[counting measure]], {{mvar|μ}}, of a Borel set {{mvar|A}} be defined as the number of elements of {{mvar|A}} if {{mvar|A}} is finite, and {{math|∞}} otherwise. One can check that {{mvar|μ}} is indeed a measure. It is not {{mvar|σ}}-finite, as not every Borel set is at most a countable union of finite sets. Let {{mvar|ν}} be the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on this Borel algebra. Then, {{mvar|ν}} is absolutely continuous with respect to {{mvar|μ}}, since for a set {{mvar|A}} one has {{math|''μ''(''A'') {{=}} 0}} only if {{mvar|A}} is the [[empty set]], and then {{math|''ν''(''A'')}} is also zero.\n\nAssume that the Radon–Nikodym theorem holds, that is, for some measurable function {{math| ''f'' }} one has\n:<math>\\nu(A) = \\int_A f \\,d\\mu</math>\n\nfor all Borel sets. Taking {{mvar|A}} to be a [[singleton set]], {{math|''A'' {{=}} {''a''},}} and using the above equality, one finds\n:<math> 0 = f(a)</math>\n\nfor all real numbers {{mvar|a}}. This implies that the function {{math| ''f'' }}, and therefore the Lebesgue measure {{mvar|ν}}, is zero, which is a contradiction.\n\n==Proof==\nThis section gives a measure-theoretic proof of the theorem. There is also a functional-analytic proof, using Hilbert space methods, that was first given by [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]].\n\nFor finite measures {{mvar|μ}} and {{mvar|ν}}, the idea is to consider functions {{math| ''f'' }} with {{math| ''f dμ'' ≤ ''dν''}}. The supremum of all such functions, along with the [[monotone convergence theorem]], then furnishes the Radon–Nikodym derivative. The fact that the remaining part of {{mvar|μ}} is singular with respect to {{mvar|ν}} follows from a technical fact about finite measures. Once the result is established for finite measures, extending to {{mvar|σ}}-finite, signed, and complex measures can be done naturally. The details are given below.\n\n===For finite measures===\nFirst, suppose {{mvar|μ}} and {{mvar|ν}} are both finite-valued nonnegative measures. Let {{mvar|F}} be the set of those measurable functions {{math| ''f''  : ''X'' → [0, ∞)}} such that:\n:<math>\\forall A \\in \\mathit\\Sigma:\\qquad \\int_A f\\,d\\mu \\leq \\nu(A)</math>\n\n{{math|''F'' ≠ ∅}}, since it contains at least the zero function. Now let {{math| ''f''<sub>1</sub>,  ''f''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''F''}}, and suppose {{mvar|A}} is an arbitrary measurable set, and define:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  A_1 &= \\left\\{ x \\in A : f_1(x) > f_2(x) \\right\\}, \\\\\n  A_2 &= \\left\\{ x \\in A : f_2(x) \\geq f_1(x) \\right\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThen one has\n:<math>\\int_A\\max\\left\\{f_1, f_2\\right\\}\\,d\\mu = \\int_{A_1} f_1\\,d\\mu + \\int_{A_2} f_2\\,d\\mu \\leq \\nu\\left(A_1\\right) + \\nu\\left(A_2\\right) = \\nu(A),</math>\n\nand therefore, {{math|max{ ''f'' <sub>1</sub>,  ''f'' <sub>2</sub>} ∈ ''F''}}.\n\nNow, let {{math|{ ''f<sub>n</sub>'' } }}be a sequence of functions in {{mvar|F}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_X f_n\\,d\\mu = \\sup_{f\\in F} \\int_X f\\,d\\mu.</math>\n\nBy replacing {{math| ''f<sub>n</sub>'' }} with the maximum of the first {{mvar|n}} functions, one can assume that the sequence {{math|{ ''f<sub>n</sub>'' } }} is increasing. Let {{mvar|g}} be an extended-valued function defined as\n:<math>g(x) := \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f_n(x).</math>\n\nBy Lebesgue's [[monotone convergence theorem]], one has\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_A f_n\\,d\\mu = \\int_A \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(x)\\,d\\mu(x) = \\int_A g\\,d\\mu \\leq \\nu(A)</math>\n\nfor each {{math|''A'' ∈ ''Σ''}}, and hence, {{math|''g'' ∈ ''F''}}. Also, by the construction of {{mvar|g}},\n:<math>\\int_X g\\,d\\mu = \\sup_{f\\in F}\\int_X f\\,d\\mu.</math>\n\nNow, since {{math|''g'' ∈ ''F''}},\n:<math>\\nu_0(A) := \\nu(A) - \\int_A g\\,d\\mu</math>\n\ndefines a nonnegative measure on {{mvar|Σ}}. Suppose {{math|ν<sub>0</sub> ≠ 0}}; then, since {{mvar|μ}} is finite, there is an {{math|''ε'' > 0}} such that {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub>(''X'') > ''ε μ''(''X'')}}. Let (''P'',&nbsp;''N'') be a [[Hahn decomposition theorem|Hahn decomposition]] for the signed measure {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub> − ''ε μ''}}. Note that for every {{math|''A'' ∈ ''Σ''}} one has {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub>(''A'' ∩ ''P'') ≥ ''ε μ''(''A'' ∩ ''P'')}}, and hence,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\nu(A) &=    \\int_A g\\,d\\mu + \\nu_0(A) \\\\\n         &\\geq \\int_A g\\,d\\mu + \\nu_0(A\\cap P)\\\\\n         &\\geq \\int_A g\\,d\\mu + \\varepsilon\\mu(A\\cap P) \\\\\n         &=    \\int_A\\left(g + \\varepsilon1_P\\right)\\,d\\mu,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|1<sub>''P''</sub>}} is the [[indicator function]] of {{mvar|P}}. Also, note that {{math|''μ''(''P'') > 0}}; for if {{math|''μ''(''P'') {{=}} 0}}, then (since {{mvar|ν}} is absolutely continuous in relation to {{mvar|μ}}) {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub>(''P'') ≤ ''ν''(''P'') {{=}} 0}}, so {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub>(''P'') {{=}} 0}} and\n:<math>\\nu_0(X) - \\varepsilon\\mu(X) = \\left(\\nu_0 - \\varepsilon\\mu\\right)(N) \\leq 0,</math>\n\ncontradicting the fact that {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub>(''X'') > ''εμ''(''X'')}}.\n\nThen, since\n:<math>\\int_X\\left(g + \\varepsilon1_P\\right)\\,d\\mu \\leq \\nu(X) < +\\infty,</math>\n\n{{math|''g'' + ''ε'' 1<sub>''P''</sub> ∈ ''F''}} and satisfies\n:<math>\\int_X\\left(g + \\varepsilon 1_P\\right)\\,d\\mu > \\int_X g\\,d\\mu = \\sup_{f\\in F}\\int_X f\\,d\\mu.</math>\n\nThis is [[reductio ad absurdum|impossible]]; therefore, the initial assumption that {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub> ≠ 0}} must be false. Hence, {{math|''ν''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}}, as desired.\n\nNow, since {{mvar|g}} is {{mvar|μ}}-integrable, the set {{math|{''x'' ∈ ''X'' : ''g''(''x'') {{=}} ∞} }}is {{mvar|μ}}-[[null set|null]]. Therefore, if a {{math| ''f'' }} is defined as\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n  g(x) & \\text{if }g(x) < \\infty \\\\\n  0    & \\text{otherwise,}\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nthen {{math| ''f'' }} has the desired properties.\n\nAs for the uniqueness, let {{math| ''f'', ''g'' : ''X'' → [0, ∞)}} be measurable functions satisfying\n:<math>\\nu(A) = \\int_A f\\,d\\mu = \\int_A g\\,d\\mu</math>\n\nfor every measurable set {{mvar|A}}. Then, {{math|''g'' − ''f'' }} is {{mvar|μ}}-integrable, and\n:<math>\\int_A(g - f)\\,d\\mu = 0.</math>\n\nIn particular, for {{math|''A'' {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''X'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''g''(''x'')},}} or {{math|{''x'' ∈ ''X'' : ''f''(''x'') < ''g''(''x'')}.}} It follows that\n:<math>\\int_X(g - f)^+\\,d\\mu = 0 = \\int_X(g - f)^-\\,d\\mu,</math>\n\nand so, that {{math|(''g'' − ''f'' )<sup>+</sup> {{=}} 0}} {{mvar|μ}}-almost everywhere; the same is true for {{math|(''g'' − ''f'' )<sup>−</sup>}}, and thus, {{math| ''f''  {{=}} ''g''}} {{mvar|μ}}-almost everywhere, as desired.\n\n===For {{mvar|σ}}-finite positive measures===\nIf {{mvar|μ}} and {{mvar|ν}} are {{mvar|σ}}-finite, then {{mvar|X}} can be written as the union of a sequence {{math|{''B<sub>n</sub>''}<sub>''n''</sub>}} of [[disjoint sets]] in {{mvar|Σ}}, each of which has finite measure under both {{mvar|μ}} and {{mvar|ν}}. For each {{mvar|n}}, by the finite case, there is a {{math|Σ}}-measurable function {{math| ''f<sub>n</sub>''  : ''B<sub>n</sub>'' → [0, ∞)}} such that\n:<math>\\nu_n(A) = \\int_A f_n\\,d\\mu</math>\n\nfor each {{math|Σ}}-measurable subset {{mvar|A}} of {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}}. The sum <math>\\left(\\sum_n f_n \\right) = f</math>of those functions is then the required function such that <math>\\nu(A)=\\int_A f d\\mu</math>. \n\nAs for the uniqueness, since each of the {{math| ''f<sub>n</sub>'' }} is {{mvar|μ}}-almost everywhere unique, then so is {{math| ''f'' }}.\n\n===For signed and complex measures===\nIf {{mvar|ν}} is a {{mvar|σ}}-finite signed measure, then it can be Hahn–Jordan decomposed as {{math|''ν'' {{=}} ''ν''<sup>+</sup> − ''ν''<sup>−</sup>}} where one of the measures is finite. Applying the previous result to those two measures, one obtains two functions, {{math|''g'', ''h'' : ''X'' → [0, ∞)}}, satisfying the Radon–Nikodym theorem for {{math|''ν''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{math|''ν''<sup>−</sup>}} respectively, at least one of which is {{mvar|μ}}-integrable (i.e., its integral with respect to {{mvar|μ}} is finite). It is clear then that {{math| ''f'' {{=}} ''g'' − ''h''}} satisfies the required properties, including uniqueness, since both {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}} are unique up to {{mvar|μ}}-almost everywhere equality.\n\nIf {{mvar|ν}} is a [[complex measure]], it can be decomposed as {{math|''ν'' {{=}} ''ν''<sub>1</sub> + ''iν''<sub>2</sub>}}, where both {{math|''ν''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ν''<sub>2</sub>}} are finite-valued signed measures. Applying the above argument, one obtains two functions, {{math|''g'', ''h'' : ''X'' → [0, ∞)}}, satisfying the required properties for {{math|''ν''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ν''<sub>2</sub>}}, respectively. Clearly, {{math| ''f''  {{=}} ''g'' + ''ih''}} is the required function.\n\n==Generalisation==\nIf the condition that <math>\\nu</math> is absolutely continuous with respect to <math>\\mu</math> is dropped, then the following is true. Given a σ-finite measure <math>\\mu</math> on the measure space <math>(X,\\mathit\\Sigma)</math> and a σ-finite, signed measure <math>\\nu</math> on <math>\\mathit\\Sigma</math>, there exist unique signed measures <math>\\nu_a</math> and <math>\\nu_s</math> on <math>\\mathit\\Sigma</math> such that <math>\\nu=\\nu_a+\\nu_s</math>, <math>\\nu_a\\ll\\mu</math>, and <math>\\nu_s\\perp\\mu</math>. Moreover, there exists some extended <math>\\mu</math>-integrable function <math>f</math> such that\n:<math>\\nu_a(E) = \\int_E f\\,d\\mu</math>. We write <math>f = \\frac{dv_a}{d\\mu}</math>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Girsanov theorem]]\n*[[Radon–Nikodym set]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Lang |first=Serge |year=1969 |title=Analysis II: Real analysis |author-link= Serge Lang |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn= }} Contains a proof for vector measures assuming values in a Banach space.\n* {{cite book |last1=Royden |first1=H.

''' Let <math>H</math> be a Hilbert space and <math>\\varphi\\in H^*</math>. Then there exists <math>f\\in H</math> such that for any <math>x\\in H</math>, <math>\\varphi(x)=\\langle f,x\\rangle</math>. Moreover <math>\\|f\\|_H=\\|\\varphi\\|_{H*}</math>\n\n'''Proof'''. Let <math>M=\\{u\\in H\\ | \\ \\varphi(u)=0\\}</math>. Clearly <math>M</math> is closed subspace of <math>H</math>. If <math>M=H</math>, then we can trivially choose <math>v=0</math>. Now assume <math>M\\ne H</math>. Then <math>M^{\\perp}</math> is one-dimensional. Indeed, let <math>v_1,v_2</math> be nonzero vectors in <math>M^{\\perp}</math>. Then there is nonzero real number <math>\\lambda</math>, such that <math>\\lambda \\varphi(v_1)=\\varphi(v_2)</math>. Observe that <math>\\lambda v_1-v_2\\in M^{\\perp}</math> and <math>\\varphi(\\lambda v_1-v_2)=0</math>, so <math>\\lambda v_1-v_2\\in M</math>. This means that <math>\\lambda v_1-v_2=0</math>. Now let <math>g</math> be unit vector in <math>M^{\\perp}</math>. For arbitrary <math>x\\in H</math>, let <math>v</math> be the orthogonal projections of <math>x</math> onto <math>M^{\\perp}</math> respectively. Then <math>v=\\langle g,v\\rangle g</math> and  <math>\\langle g,x-v\\rangle=0</math> (from the properties of orthogonal projections), so that <math>x-v\\in M</math> and <math>\\langle g,x\\rangle=\\langle g,v\\rangle</math>. Thus <math>\\varphi(x)=\\varphi(v+x-v)=\\varphi(\\langle g,v\\rangle g)+\\varphi(x-v)=\\langle g,v\\rangle \\varphi(g)=\\langle g,x\\rangle \\varphi(g)</math>. Hence <math>f=\\varphi(g)g</math>. We also see <math>\\|f\\|_H=\\varphi(g)</math>. From the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwartz inequality <math>\\varphi(x)\\le \\|g\\|\\|x\\|\\varphi(g)</math>, thus for <math>x</math> with unit norm <math>\\varphi(x)\\le \\varphi(g)</math>. This implies that <math>\\|\\varphi\\|_{H*}=\\varphi(g)</math>.\n \nGiven any continuous linear functional ''g'' in ''H*'', the corresponding element <math>x_g \\in H</math>  can be constructed uniquely by <math>x_g = g(e_1)e_1 + g(e_2)e_2 + ...</math>, where <math>\\{e_i\\}</math> is an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''H'', and the value of <math>x_g</math> does not vary by choice of basis. Thus, if <math>y \\in H, y = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + ...</math>, then <math>g(y) = a_1g(e_1) + a_2g(e_2) + ... = \\langle x_g, y\\rangle. </math> \n\n'''Theorem'''. The mapping <math>\\Phi</math>: ''H'' → ''H*'' defined by <math>\\Phi(x)</math> = <math>\\varphi_x</math> is an isometric (anti-) isomorphism, meaning that:\n* <math>\\Phi</math> is [[bijective]].\n* The [[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] of <math>x</math> and <math>\\varphi_x</math> agree: <math>\\Vert x \\Vert = \\Vert\\Phi(x)\\Vert</math>.\n* <math>\\Phi</math> is [[Additive map|additive]]: <math>\\Phi( x_1 + x_2 ) = \\Phi( x_1 ) + \\Phi( x_2 )</math>.\n* If the base field is <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>, then <math>\\Phi(\\lambda x) = \\lambda \\Phi(x)</math> for all real numbers λ.\n* If the base field is <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, then <math>\\Phi(\\lambda x) = \\bar{\\lambda} \\Phi(x)</math> for all complex numbers λ, where <math>\\bar{\\lambda}</math> denotes the [[complex conjugation]] of <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\nThe [[Inverse operator|inverse map]] of <math>\\Phi</math> can be described as follows. Given a non-zero element <math>\\varphi</math> of ''H*'', the [[orthogonal complement]] of the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of <math>\\varphi</math> is a one-dimensional subspace of ''H''. Take a non-zero element ''z'' in that subspace, and set <math>x = \\overline{\\varphi(z)} \\cdot z /{\\left\\Vert z \\right\\Vert}^2</math>. Then <math>\\Phi(x)</math> = <math>\\varphi</math>.\n\nHistorically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]] and [[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]] in 1907 (see references).\n\nIn the mathematical treatment of [[quantum mechanics]], the theorem can be seen as a justification for the popular [[bra–ket notation]].

The theorem is named for {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Frigyes Riesz|first=Frigyes |last=Riesz|year=1909}} who introduced it for [[Continuous function|continuous functions]] on the [[unit interval]], {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Andrey Markov, Jr.| first=Andrey |last=Markov|year=1938}} who extended the result to some non-compact spaces, and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Shizuo Kakutani|first=Shizuo |last=Kakutani|year=1941}} who extended the result to [[Compact Hausdorff space|compact Hausdorff spaces]].\n\nThere are many closely related variations of the theorem, as the linear functionals can be complex, real, or [[Positive linear functional|positive]], the space they are defined on may be the unit interval or a compact space or a [[locally compact space]],  the continuous functions may be [[Vanish at infinity|vanishing at infinity]] or have [[compact support]], and the measures can be [[Baire measure]]s or regular [[Borel measure]]s or [[Radon measure]]s or [[signed measure]]s or [[complex measure]]s.\n\n== The representation theorem for positive linear functionals on ''C<sub>c</sub>''(''X'') ==\n\nThe following theorem represents positive [[linear functionals]] on ''C<sub>c</sub>''(''X''), the space of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[compact space|compactly]] [[support (mathematics)|supported]] complex-valued functions on a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] ''X''. The [[Borel set]]s in the following statement refer to the [[σ-algebra]] generated by the [[Open set|''open'' sets]].\n\nA non-negative countably additive Borel measure μ on a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] ''X'' is '''regular''' [[if and only if]]\n\n* μ(''K'') < ∞ for every compact ''K'';\n* For every Borel set ''E'',\n:: <math> \\mu(E) = \\inf \\{\\mu(U): E \\subseteq U, U \\mbox{ open}\\} </math>\n*  The relation\n:: <math> \\mu(E) = \\sup \\{\\mu(K): K \\subseteq E, K \\mbox{ compact}\\} </math>\nholds whenever ''E'' is open or when ''E'' is Borel and ''μ''(''E'') < ∞ .\n\n'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]].  For any [[positive linear functional]] <math> \\psi </math> on ''C''<sub>''c''</sub>(''X''), there is a unique [[regular Borel measure]] μ on ''X'' such that\n:<math> \\psi(f) = \\int_X f(x) \\, d \\mu(x) \\quad </math>\nfor all ''f'' in C<sub>c</sub>(''X'').\n\nOne approach to [[measure theory]] is to start with a [[Radon measure]], defined as a positive linear functional on ''C''<sub>''c''</sub>(''X''). This is the way adopted by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]; it does of course assume that ''X'' starts life as a [[topological space]], rather than simply as a set. For locally compact spaces an integration theory is then recovered.\n\nWithout the condition of [[Regular measure|regularity]] the Borel measure need not be unique. For example, let ''X'' be the set of ordinals at most equal to the [[first uncountable ordinal]] Ω, with the topology generated by \"[[Open interval|open intervals]]\". The linear functional taking a continuous function to its value at Ω corresponds to the regular Borel measure with a point mass at Ω. However it also corresponds to the (non-regular) Borel measure that assigns measure 1 to any Borel set <math>B\\subseteq [0,\\Omega]</math> if there is [[club set|closed and unbounded set]] <math>C\\subseteq [0,\\Omega[</math> with <math>C\\subseteq B</math>, and assigns measure 0 to other Borel sets. (In particular the singleton {Ω} gets measure 0, contrary to the point mass measure.)\n\n==Historical remark==\nIn its original form by F. Riesz  (1909) the theorem states that every continuous linear functional ''A''[''f''] over the space ''C''([0, 1]) of continuous functions in the interval [0,1] can be represented in the form\n\n:<math>A[f] = \\int_0^1 f(x)\\,d\\alpha(x),</math>\n\nwhere ''α''(''x'') is a function of [[bounded variation]] on the interval [0, 1], and the integral is a [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]]. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between Borel regular measures in the interval and functions of bounded variation (that assigns to each function of bounded variation the corresponding Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, and the integral with respect to the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure agrees with the Riemann–Stieltjes integral for continuous functions), the above stated theorem generalizes the original statement of F. Riesz. (See Gray(1984), for a historical discussion).\n\n== The representation theorem for the continuous dual of ''C''<sub>0</sub>(''X'') ==\n\nThe following theorem, also referred to as the ''Riesz–Markov theorem'', gives a concrete realisation of the [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|topological dual space]] of ''C''<sub>0</sub>(''X''), the set of [[continuous function]]s on ''X'' which [[vanish at infinity]].  The [[Borel set]]s in the statement of the theorem also refers to the σ-algebra generated by the ''open'' sets.\n\nIf μ is a complex-valued countably additive Borel measure, μ is called regular if the non-negative countably additive measure |μ| is regular as defined above.\n\n'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a locally compact Hausdorff space.  For any continuous [[linear functional]] ψ on ''C''<sub>0</sub>(''X''), there is a unique ''regular'' countably additive complex [[Borel measure]] μ on ''X'' such that\n:<math> \\psi(f) = \\int_X f(x) \\, d \\mu(x) \\quad </math>\nfor all ''f'' in ''C''<sub>0</sub>(''X''). The norm of ψ as a linear functional is the [[total variation]] of μ, that is\n:<math> \\|\\psi\\| = |\\mu|(X).</math>\nFinally, ψ is [[positive linear functional|positive]] if and only if the measure μ is non-negative.\n\nOne can deduce this statement about linear functionals from the statement about positive linear functionals by first showing that a bounded linear functional can be written as a finite linear combination of positive ones.\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Fréchet | first1 = M. | year = 1907 | title = Sur les ensembles de fonctions et les opérations linéaires | url = | journal = [[Les Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|C.

      "text": "[[File:ScagnosticsBase.svg|thumb|400px|Convex hull, alpha shape and minimal spanning tree of a bivariate data set.]]\n\nIn [[computational geometry]], an '''alpha shape''', or '''α-shape''', is a family of piecewise linear simple curves in the [[Euclidean plane]] associated with the shape of a finite set of points.  They were first defined by {{harvtxt|Edelsbrunner|Kirkpatrick|Seidel|1983}}.  The alpha-shape associated with a set of points is a generalization of the concept of the [[convex hull]], i.e. every convex hull is an alpha-shape but not every alpha shape is a convex hull.\n\n== Characterization ==\nFor each [[real number]] ''α'', define the concept of a ''generalized disk of radius''&nbsp;1/''α'' as follows:\n* If ''α''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, it is a closed [[half-plane]];\n* If ''α''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, it is closed disk of radius&nbsp;1/''α'';\n* If ''α''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, it is the closure of the complement of a disk of radius&nbsp;&minus;1/''α''.\nThen an edge of the alpha-shape is drawn between two members of the finite point set whenever there exists a generalized disk of radius&nbsp;1/''α'' containing the entire point set and which has the property that the two points lie on its boundary.\n\nIf ''α''&nbsp;= 0, then the alpha-shape associated with the finite point set is its ordinary convex hull.\n\n== Alpha complex ==\nAlpha shapes are closely related to alpha complexes, subcomplexes of the [[Delaunay triangulation]] of the point set.\n\nEach edge or triangle of the [[Delaunay triangulation]] may be associated with a characteristic radius, the radius of the smallest empty circle containing the edge or triangle. For each [[real number]] ''α'', the  ''α''-complex of the given set of points is the [[simplicial complex]] formed by the set of edges and triangles whose radii are at most 1/''α''.\n\nThe union of the edges and triangles in the ''α''-complex forms a shape closely resembling the ''α''-shape; however it differs in that it has polygonal edges rather than edges formed from arcs of circles. More specifically, {{harvtxt|Edelsbrunner|1995}} showed that the two shapes are [[homotopy equivalent]]. (In this later work, Edelsbrunner used the name \"''α''-shape\" to refer to the union of the cells in the ''α''-complex, and instead called the related curvilinear shape an ''α''-body.)\n\n== Examples ==\nThis technique can be employed to reconstruct a [[Fermi surface]] from the electronic Bloch spectral function evaluated at the [[Fermi level]], as obtained from the [[Green's function|Green function]] in a generalised ab-initio study of the problem. The Fermi surface is then defined as the set of reciprocal space points within the first [[Brillouin zone]], where the signal is highest. \nThe definition has the advantage of covering also cases of various forms of disorder.\n[[File:Bulk Ag, Fermi surface.png|thumb|Fermi surface of bulk silver: alpha-shape reconstruction from [[Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker method|KKR]] Bloch spectral function reconstruction]]\n\n<!-- Please add the value of alpha used. -->\n\n{{expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Beta skeleton]]\n\n== References ==\n* N.

For example, the interval <math>[0,1]</math> is convex but generates the real-number line under linear combinations.

The coefficients ([[weight function|weights]]) in a weighted mean are not required to sum to 1; instead the weighted linear combination is explicitly divided by the sum of the weights.\n*[[Affine combination]]s are like convex combinations, but the coefficients are not required to be non-negative.

      "text": "{{Short description|Notion in topological vector spaces}}[[File:Extreme points.svg|thumb|right|The convex hull of the red set is the blue and red [[convex set]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''convex hull''' or '''convex envelope''' or '''convex closure''' of a set ''X'' of points in the [[Euclidean plane]] or in a [[Euclidean space]] (or, more generally, in an [[affine space]] over the reals) is the smallest [[convex set]] that contains ''X''. For instance, when ''X'' is a [[Bounded set|bounded]] subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around ''X''.<ref name=\"rubber band\">{{harvtxt|de Berg|van Kreveld|Overmars|Schwarzkopf|2000}}, p. 3.</ref>\n\nFormally, the convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X'', or as the set of all [[convex combination]]s of points in&nbsp;''X''. With the latter definition, convex hulls may be extended from Euclidean spaces to arbitrary [[real vector space]]s; they may also be generalized further, to [[oriented matroid]]s.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992}}\n\nThe [[algorithm]]ic problem of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane or other low-dimensional Euclidean spaces is one of the fundamental problems of [[computational geometry]].\n\n==Definitions==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right  | width = 200\n | image1 = Truncated cuboctahedron, ball-and-stick, triangles.png\n | image2 = Truncated cuboctahedron, ball-and-stick.png\n | footer = Convex hull calculated by [[SciPy]]<ref>[[SciPy]] class [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html spatial.ConvexHull] using the [[quickhull]] algorithm</ref> (left) for the coordinates of the [[truncated cuboctahedron]] (right), containing 92 triangular simplices (some of them [[coplanarity|coplanar]])\n}}\n\nA set of points is defined to be [[convex set|convex]] if it contains the line segments connecting each pair of its points. The convex hull of a given set ''X'' may be defined as\n#The (unique) minimal convex set containing ''X''\n#The intersection of all convex sets containing ''X''\n#The set of all [[convex combination]]s of points in ''X''.\n#The union of all [[simplex|simplices]] with vertices in ''X''.\n\nIt is not obvious that the first definition makes sense: why should there exist a unique minimal convex set containing ''X'', for every ''X''? However, the second definition, the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X'', is well-defined, and it is a subset of every other convex set ''Y'' that contains ''X'', because ''Y'' is included among the sets being intersected. Thus, it is exactly the unique minimal convex set containing ''X''. Each convex set containing ''X'' must (by the assumption that it is convex) contain all convex combinations of points in ''X'', so the set of all convex combinations is contained in the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X''. Conversely, the set of all convex combinations is itself a convex set containing ''X'', so it also contains the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X'', and therefore the sets given by these two definitions must be equal.\nIn fact, according to [[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)|Carathéodory's theorem]], if ''X'' is a subset of an ''N''-dimensional vector space, convex combinations of at most ''N''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points are sufficient in the definition above. Therefore, the convex hull of a set ''X'' of three or more points in the plane is the union of all the [[triangle]]s determined by triples of points from ''X'', and more generally in ''N''-dimensional space the convex hull is the union of the [[simplex|simplices]] determined by at most ''N''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 vertices from X.\n\nIf the convex hull of ''X'' is a [[closed set]] (as happens, for instance, if ''X'' is a [[finite set]] or more generally a [[compact set]]), then it is the intersection of all closed [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s containing ''X''. The [[hyperplane separation theorem]] proves that in this case, each point not in the convex hull can be separated from the convex hull by a half-space. However, there exist convex sets, and convex hulls of sets, that cannot be represented in this way. Open halfspaces are such examples.\n\nMore abstractly, the convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a [[closure operator]]:\n*It is ''extensive'', meaning that the convex hull of every set ''X'' is a superset of ''X''.\n*It is ''[[Monotone function#Monotonicity in order theory|non-decreasing]]'', meaning that, for every two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' with ''X''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''Y'', the convex hull of ''X'' is a subset of the convex hull of&nbsp;''Y''.\n*It is ''[[idempotence|idempotent]]'', meaning that for every ''X'', the convex hull of the convex hull of ''X'' is the same as the convex hull of&nbsp;''X''.\n\n==Convex hull of a finite point set==\n[[File:Convex hull.png|thumb|Convex hull of some points in the plane]]\n\nThe convex hull of a [[finite set|finite]] point set <math>S</math> is the set of all [[convex combination]]s of its points. In a convex combination, each point <math>x_i</math> in <math>S</math> is assigned a weight or coefficient <math>\\alpha_i</math> in such a way that the coefficients are all non-negative and sum to one,  and these weights are used to compute a [[weighted average]] of the points. For each choice of coefficients, the resulting convex combination is a point in the convex hull, and the whole convex hull can be formed by choosing coefficients in all possible ways. Expressing this as a single formula, the convex hull is the set:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Conv}(S)=\\left\\{\\left.\\sum_{i=1}^{|S|} \\alpha_i x_i\\  \\right| (\\forall i: \\alpha_i\\ge 0)\\wedge \\sum_{i=1}^{|S|} \\alpha_i=1 \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe convex hull of a finite point set <math>S \\subsetneq \\R^n</math> forms a [[convex polygon]] when ''n'' = 2, or more generally a [[convex polytope]] in <math>\\R^n</math>. Each point <math>x_i</math> in <math>S</math> that is not in the convex hull of the other points (that is, such that <math>x_i \\notin \\operatorname{Conv}(S\\setminus\\{x_i\\})</math>) is called a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of <math>\\operatorname{Conv}(S)</math>. In fact, every convex polytope in <math>\\R^n</math> is the convex hull of its vertices.\n\n[[File:ConvexHull.svg|thumb|Convex hull of a finite set: elastic-band analogy]]\n[[File:3D_Convex_Hull.tiff|thumb|3D convex hull of 120 point cloud]]\n\nIf the points of <math>S</math> are all on a [[Line (geometry)|line]], the convex hull is the [[line segment]] joining the outermost two points. When the set <math>S</math> is a [[empty set|nonempty]] [[finite set|finite subset]] of the [[Euclidean geometry|plane]] (that is, [[two-dimensional]]), we may imagine stretching a [[rubber band]] so that it surrounds the entire set <math>S</math> and then releasing it, allowing it to contract; when it becomes taut, it encloses the convex hull of <math>S</math>.<ref name=\"rubber band\"/>\n\nIn two dimensions, the convex hull is sometimes partitioned into two polygonal chains, the upper hull and the lower hull, stretching between the leftmost and rightmost points of the hull. More generally, for points in any dimension in general position, each [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] of the convex hull is either oriented upwards (separating the hull from points directly above it) or downwards; the union of the upward-facing facets forms a topological disk, the upper hull, and similarly the union of the downward-facing facets forms the lower hull.<ref>{{harvtxt|de Berg|van Kreveld|Overmars|Schwarzkopf|2000}}, p. 6. The idea of partitioning the hull into two chains comes from an efficient variant of [[Graham scan]] by {{harvtxt|Andrew|1979}}.</ref>\n\n==Computation of convex hulls==\n{{Main article|Convex hull algorithms}}\n\nIn computational geometry, a number of algorithms are known for computing the convex hull for a finite set of points and for other geometric objects.\n\nComputing the convex hull means constructing an unambiguous, efficient [[data structure|representation]] of the required convex shape. The complexity of the corresponding algorithms is usually estimated in terms  of '''''n''''', the number of input points, and '''''h''''', the number of points on the convex hull.\n\nFor points in two and three dimensions, [[output-sensitive algorithm]]s are known that compute the convex hull in time O(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''h''). For dimensions&nbsp;''d'' higher than 3, the time for computing the convex hull is <math>O(n^{\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor})</math>, matching the worst-case output complexity of the problem.{{sfnp|Chazelle|1993}}\n\n==Minkowski addition and convex hulls==\n{{See also|Minkowski addition|Shapley–Folkman lemma}}\n[[File:Minkowski sum graph - vector version.svg|thumb|alt=Three squares are shown in the nonnegative quadrant of the Cartesian plane.

Two points in the Cartesian plane can be ''[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|added]]'' coordinate-wise\n: (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) + (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) = (''x''<sub>1</sub>+''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>+''y''<sub>2</sub>);\nfurther, a point can be ''[[scalar multiplication|multiplied]]'' by each real number ''λ'' coordinate-wise \n: ''λ'' (''x'', ''y'') = (''λx'', ''λy'').\n\nMore generally, any real vector space of (finite) dimension ''D'' can be viewed as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible lists of ''D'' real numbers {{nowrap|{ (''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, . . . , ''v''<sub>D</sub>)}}&nbsp;} together with two [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s: [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication|multiplication by a real number]]. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vector addition and real-number multiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the Cartesian plane.\n\n===Convex sets===\n[[File:Extreme points.svg|thumb|right|alt=A picture of a smoothed triangle, like a triangular tortilla-chip or a triangular road-sign. Each of the three rounded corners is drawn with a red curve. The remaining interior points of the triangular shape are shaded with blue.|In the [[convex hull]] of the red set, each blue point is a [[convex combination]] of some red points.]]\nIn a real vector space, a set is defined to be ''[[convex set|convex]]'' if, for each pair of its points, every point on the [[line segment]] that joins them is [[cover (mathematics)|covered]] by the set. For example, a solid [[cube (geometry)|cube]] is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a [[crescent]] shape, is non‑convex. [[Vacuous truth|Trivially]], the [[empty set]] is convex.\n\nMore formally, a set ''Q'' is convex if, for all points ''v''<sub>0</sub> and ''v''<sub>1</sub> in ''Q'' and for every real number ''λ'' in the [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}}, the point \n: (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''λ'')&nbsp;''v''<sub>0</sub> + ''λv''<sub>1</sub>\nis a [[element (mathematics)|member]] of&nbsp;''Q''.\n\nBy [[mathematical induction]], a set ''Q'' is convex if and only if every [[convex combination]] of members of ''Q'' also belongs to ''Q''. By definition, a ''convex combination'' of an indexed subset&nbsp;{''v''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''v''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&nbsp;''v''<sub>D</sub>} of a vector space is any [[weighted mean|weighted average]]&nbsp;{{nowrap|''λ''<sub>0</sub>''v''<sub>0</sub> + ''λ''<sub>1</sub>''v''<sub>1</sub> + .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. + ''λ''<sub>D</sub>''v''<sub>D</sub>,}} for some indexed set of non‑negative real numbers {''λ''<sub>d</sub>} satisfying the [[affine combination|equation]] {{nowrap|''λ''<sub>0</sub> + ''λ''<sub>1</sub> + . . . + ''λ''<sub>D</sub>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nThe definition of a convex set implies that the ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' of two convex sets is a convex set. More generally, the intersection of a family of convex sets is a convex set. <!-- In this proposition, the family can be empty, finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite. -->\n\n===Convex hull===\nFor every subset ''Q'' of a real vector space, its {{nowrap|''[[convex hull]]'' Conv(''Q'')}} is the [[minimal element|minimal]] convex set that contains ''Q''. Thus Conv(''Q'') is the intersection of all the convex sets that [[cover (mathematics)|cover]] ''Q''. The convex hull of a set can be equivalently defined to be the set of all convex combinations of points in&nbsp;''Q''.\n\n==Duality: Intersecting half-spaces==\n\n[[File:Supporting hyperplane1.svg|right|thumb|A [[convex set]] <math>S</math> (in pink), a supporting hyperplane of <math>S</math> (the dashed line), and the half-space delimited by the hyperplane that contains <math>S</math> (in light blue). ]]\n''Supporting hyperplane'' is a concept in [[geometry]]. A [[hyperplane]] divides a space into two [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s. A hyperplane is said to '''support''' a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] <math>S</math> in the [[real coordinate space|real ''n''-space]] <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> if it meets both of the following:\n* <math>S</math> is entirely contained in one of the two [[closed set|closed]] half-spaces determined by the hyperplane\n* <math>S</math> has at least one point on the hyperplane.\nHere, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the hyperplane.\n\n===Supporting hyperplane theorem===\n[[File:Supporting hyperplane2.svg|right|thumb|A convex set can have more than one supporting hyperplane at a given point on its boundary.]]\nThis [[theorem]] states that if <math>S</math> is a closed [[convex set]] in <math>\\mathbb R^n,</math> and <math>x</math> is a point on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of <math>S,</math> then there exists a supporting hyperplane containing <math>x.</math>\n\nThe hyperplane in the theorem may not be unique, as noticed in the second picture on the right.

If the preference set is convex, then the consumer's set of optimal decisions is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket (or even a line segment of optimal baskets).\n\nFor simplicity, we shall assume that the preferences of a consumer can be described by a [[utility function]] that is a [[continuous function]], which implies that the [[convex preferences|preference set]]s are [[closed set|closed]]. (The meanings of \"closed set\" is explained below, in the subsection on optimization applications.)\n\n==Non‑convexity==\n{{Main|Non-convexity (economics)}}\n{{See also|Shapley–Folkman lemma}}\n[[File:NonConvex.gif|thumb|right|When consumer preferences have concavities, then the linear budgets need not support equilibria: Consumers can jump between allocations.]]\nIf a preference set is non‑convex, then some prices produce a budget supporting two different optimal consumption decisions. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase a half an eagle and a {{nowrap|half a lion}} (or a [[griffin]])!

Thus, an extreme point is also a 0-extreme point.  If ''S'' is a polytope, then the ''k''-extreme points are exactly the interior points of the ''k''-dimensional faces of ''S''.  More generally, for any convex set ''S'', the ''k''-extreme points are partitioned into ''k''-dimensional open faces.\n\nThe finite-dimensional Krein-Milman theorem, which is due to Minkowski, can be quickly proved using the concept of ''k''-extreme points.  If ''S'' is closed, bounded, and ''n''-dimensional, and if ''p'' is a point in ''S'', then ''p'' is ''k''-extreme for some ''k'' < ''n''.  The theorem asserts that ''p'' is a convex combination of extreme points.  If ''k'' = 0, then it's trivially true.  Otherwise ''p'' lies on a line segment in ''S'' which can be maximally extended (because ''S'' is closed and bounded).  If the endpoints of the segment are ''q'' and ''r'', then their extreme rank must be less than that of ''p'', and the theorem follows by induction.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Choquet theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite web | editor=Paul E.

A particular case of this [[theorem]], which can be easily visualized, states that given a convex [[polygon]], one only needs the corners of the polygon to recover the polygon shape. The statement of the theorem is false if the polygon is not convex, as then there can be many ways of drawing a polygon having given points as corners.\n\nFormally, let <math>X</math> be a [[locally convex topological vector space]] (assumed to be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]), and let <math>K</math> be a [[compact set|compact]] convex [[subset]] of <math>X</math>. Then, the theorem states that <math>K</math> is the closed [[convex hull]] of its [[extreme point]]s.\n\nThe closed convex hull above is defined as the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all closed convex subsets of <math>X</math> that contain <math>K.</math> This turns out to be the same as the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the convex hull in the topological vector space. One direction in the theorem is easy; the main burden is to show that there are 'enough' extreme points.\n\nThe original statement proved by [[Mark Krein]] and [[David Milman]] was somewhat less general than this.\n\n[[Hermann Minkowski]] had already proved that if <math>X</math> is [[3-dimensional]] then <math>K</math> equals the convex hull of the set of its extreme points. This assertion was expanded to the case of any finite dimension by Ernst Steinitz. The Krein–Milman theorem generalizes this to arbitrary locally convex <math>X</math>, with a [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]: the closure may be needed.\n\n==Relation to the axiom of choice==\nThe [[axiom of choice]], or some weaker version of it, is needed to prove this theorem in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].  Conversely, this theorem together with the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] can prove the axiom of choice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=J. |last2=Fremlin |first2=David |title=A geometric form of the axiom of choice |journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae |date=1972 |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=167-170 |url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm77/fm77116.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2018 |quote=Theorem 1.2.

However, Theo Buehler proved in 2006 that the Krein–Milman theorem does hold for ''metrically'' compact CAT(0) spaces.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=math/0604187 |title=The Krein-Mil'man Theorem for Metric Spaces with a Convex Bicombing|last1=Buehler|first1=Theo|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)]]\n* [[Shapley–Folkman lemma]]\n* [[Helly's theorem]]\n* [[Radon's theorem]]\n* [[Choquet theory]]\n* [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* M.

For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion. Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.\n[[File:NonConvex.gif|thumb|right|When consumer preferences have concavities, then the linear budgets need not support an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]: Consumers can jump between two separate allocations (of equal [[utility function|utility]]).]]\n\nWhen the consumer's preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer's demand is not [[connected space|connected]]; A disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer, as discussed by [[Harold Hotelling]]:\n<blockquote>\nIf indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others are essentially unobservable.

But, while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth.

      "text": "{{Short description|Notion in geometry}}[[Image:Orthogonal-convex-hull.svg|thumb|The orthogonal convex hull of a point set]]\nIn [[geometry]], a set {{math|''K'' ⊂ [[real coordinate space|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>]]}} is defined to be '''orthogonally convex''' if, for every [[line (geometry)|line]] {{mvar|L}} that is parallel to one of [[standard basis]] vectors, the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of {{mvar|K}} with {{mvar|L}} is empty, a point, or a single [[line segment|segment]]. The term \"orthogonal\" refers to corresponding [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] basis and coordinates in [[Euclidean space]], where different basis vectors are [[perpendicularity|perpendicular]], as well as corresponding lines. Unlike ordinary [[convex set]]s, an orthogonally convex set is not necessarily [[connectedness|connected]].\n\nThe '''orthogonal convex hull''' of a set {{math|''S'' ⊂ '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the intersection of all connected orthogonally convex supersets of {{mvar|S}}.\n\nThese definitions are made by analogy with the classical theory of convexity, in which {{mvar|K}} is [[convex set|convex]] if, for every line {{mvar|L}}, the intersection of {{mvar|K}} with {{mvar|L}} is empty, a point, or a single segment (interval). Orthogonal convexity restricts the lines for which this property is required to hold, so every convex set is orthogonally convex but not vice versa.  For the same reason, the orthogonal convex hull itself is a subset of the [[convex hull]] of the same point set.  A point {{mvar|p}} belongs to the orthogonal convex hull of {{mvar|S}} if and only if each of the closed axis-aligned [[orthant]]s having {{mvar|p}} as apex has a nonempty intersection with {{mvar|S}}.\n\nThe orthogonal convex hull is also known as the '''rectilinear convex hull''', or, in [[two-dimensional space|two dimensions]], the '''{{mvar|x}}-{{mvar|y}} convex hull'''.\n\n==Example==\nThe figure shows a set of 16 points in the plane and the orthogonal convex hull of these points. As can be seen in the figure, the orthogonal convex hull is a [[polygon]] with some degenerate edges connecting extreme vertices in each coordinate direction. For a discrete point set such as this one, all orthogonal convex hull edges are horizontal or vertical. In this example, the orthogonal convex hull is connected.\n\n==Algorithms==\nSeveral authors have studied algorithms for constructing orthogonal convex hulls: {{harvtxt|Montuno|Fournier|1982}}; {{harvtxt|Nicholl|Lee|Liao|Wong|1983}}; {{harvtxt|Ottmann|Soisalon-Soininen|Wood|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Karlsson|Overmars|1988}}. By the results of these authors, the orthogonal convex hull of {{mvar|k}} points in the plane may be constructed in time {{math|[[big O notation|O]](''k'' [[logarithm|log]] ''k'')}}, or possibly faster using integer searching data structures for points with [[integer]] coordinates.\n\n==Related concepts==\nIt is natural to generalize orthogonal convexity to ''restricted-orientation convexity'', in which a set {{mvar|K}} is defined to be convex if all lines having one of a finite set of slopes must intersect {{mvar|K}} in connected subsets; see e.g. {{harvtxt|Rawlins|1987}}, {{harvs|last1=Rawlins|last2=Wood|year=1987|year2=1988|txt}}, or {{harvs|last1=Fink|last2=Wood|year=1996|year2=1998|txt}}.\n\nIn addition, the [[tight span]] of a finite metric space is closely related to the orthogonal convex hull. If a finite point set in the plane has a connected orthogonal convex hull, that hull is the tight span for the [[Manhattan distance]] on the point set. However, orthogonal hulls and tight spans differ for point sets with disconnected orthogonal hulls, or in higher-dimensional [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]].\n\n{{harvtxt|O'Rourke|1993}} describes several other results about orthogonal convexity and orthogonal [[visibility (geometry)|visibility]].\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation\n| last1 = Biswas   | first1 = Arindam\n| last2 = Bhowmick | first2 = Partha | \n| last3 = Sarkar   | first3 = Moumita |\n| last4 = Bhattacharya | first4 = Bhargab B. | \n| doi =  10.1016/j.ins.2012.05.029\n| journal = Information Sciences\n| pages = 176–195\n| title = A Linear-time Combinatorial Algorithm to Find the Orthogonal Hull of an Object on the Digital Plane\n| url = http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/%7Epb/research/ohull/ohull.html\n| volume = 216\n| year = 2012}}.\n*{{citation\n| last1 = Fink | first1 = Eugene\n| last2 = Wood | first2 = Derick | author2-link = Derick Wood\n| doi = 10.1016/0020-0255(96)00056-4\n| issue = 1–4\n| journal = Information Sciences\n| pages = 175–196\n| title = Fundamentals of restricted-orientation convexity\n| url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eugene/research/full/restricted-convexity.pdf\n| volume = 92\n| year = 1996}}.\n*{{citation\n| last1 = Fink | first1 = Eugene\n| last2 = Wood | first2 = Derick | author2-link = Derick Wood\n| doi = 10.1007/BF01237603\n| journal = Journal of Geometry\n| pages = 99–120\n| title = Generalized halfspaces in restricted-orientation convexity\n| url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eugene/research/full/restricted-halfspaces.pdf\n| volume = 62\n| year = 1998}}.\n*{{citation\n| last1 = Karlsson | first1 = Rolf G.\n| last2 = Overmars | first2 = Mark H. | author2-link = Mark Overmars\n| doi = 10.1007/BF01934088\n| issue = 2\n| journal = BIT\n| pages = 227–241\n| title = Scanline algorithms on a grid\n| volume = 28\n| year = 1988}}.\n*{{citation\n| last1 = Montuno | first1 = D.

      "text": "In [[geometry]], '''Radon's theorem''' on [[convex set]]s, published by [[Johann Radon]] in 1921, states that any set of ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points in '''[[real number|R]]'''<sup>''d''</sup> can be [[partition of a set|partitioned]] into two [[disjoint sets]] whose [[convex hull]]s intersect. A point in the intersection of these convex hulls is called a '''Radon point''' of the set.\n\nFor example, in the case ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, any set of four points in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be partitioned in one of two ways. It may form a triple and a singleton, where the convex hull of the triple (a triangle) contains the singleton; alternatively, it may form two pairs of points that form the endpoints of two intersecting [[line segment]]s.\n\n==Proof and construction==\n[[File:Radon coefficients.svg|thumb|300px|Two sets of four points in the plane (the vertices of a square and an equilateral triangle with its centroid), the multipliers solving the system of three linear equations for these points, and the Radon partitions formed by separating the points with positive multipliers from the points with negative multipliers.]]\nConsider any set <math>X=\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_{d+2}\\}\\subset \\mathbf{R}^d</math> of ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points in ''d''-dimensional space.

Fix some particular nonzero solution ''a''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''a''<sub>''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub>. Let <math>I\\subseteq X</math> be the set of points with positive multipliers, and let <math>J=X\\setminus I</math> be the set of points with multipliers that are negative or zero.

In the case where ''K'' is a simplex, the two simplex faces formed by the maximum and minimum points of ''g'' must then be two disjoint faces whose images have a nonempty intersection.

There exist sets of ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points (for instance, the points of a regular simplex) such that every two nonempty subsets can be separated from each other by a hyperplane. However, no matter which set of ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points is given, the two subsets of a Radon partition cannot be linearly separated. Therefore, the VC dimension of this system is exactly ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722030339/http://ilex.iit.cnr.it/pellegrini/DispenseCorsoRandAlgPisa04/lez9-epsilonnet-draft.ps Epsilon-nets and VC-dimension], Lecture Notes by Marco Pellegrini, 2004.</ref>\n\nA [[randomized algorithm]] that repeatedly replaces sets of ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points by their Radon point can be used to compute an [[approximation algorithm|approximation]] to a [[Centerpoint (geometry)|centerpoint]] of any point set, in an amount of time that is polynomial in both the number of points and the dimension.<ref name=\"cemst\"/>\n\n==Related concepts==\nThe Radon point of three points in a one-dimensional space is just their [[median]]. The [[geometric median]] of a set of points is the point minimizing the sum of distances to the points in the set; it generalizes the one-dimensional median and has been studied both from the point of view of [[facility location]] and [[robust statistics]]. For sets of four points in the plane, the geometric median coincides with the Radon point.\n\nAnother generalization for partition into ''r'' sets was given by {{harvs|first=Helge|last=Tverberg|authorlink=Helge Tverberg|year=1966|txt}} and is now known as [[Tverberg's theorem]]. It states that for any set of\n:<math>(d + 1)(r - 1) + 1\\ </math>\npoints in Euclidean ''d''-space, there is a partition into ''r'' subsets whose convex hulls intersect in at least one common point.\n\n[[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)|Carathéodory's theorem]] states that any point in the convex hull of some set of points is also within the convex hull of a subset of at most ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 of the points; that is, that the given point is part of a Radon partition in which it is a singleton. One proof of Carathéodory's theorem uses a technique of examining solutions to systems of linear equations, similar to the proof of Radon's theorem, to eliminate one point at a time until at most ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 remain.\n\nConcepts related to Radon's theorem have also been considered for [[antimatroid|convex geometries]], families of finite sets with the properties that the intersection of any two sets in the family remains in the family, and that the [[empty set]] and the union of all the sets belongs to the family. In this more general context, the convex hull of a set ''S'' is the intersection of the family members that contain ''S'', and the Radon number of a space is the smallest ''r'' such that any ''r'' points have two subsets whose convex hulls intersect. Similarly, one can define the Helly number ''h'' and the Carathéodory number ''c'' by analogy to their definitions for convex sets in Euclidean spaces, and it can be shown that these numbers satisfy the inequalities ''h''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''ch''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|Womble|1971}}.</ref>\n\nIn an arbitrary [[undirected graph]], one may define a convex set to be a set of vertices that includes every [[induced subgraph|induced]] [[path graph|path]] connecting a pair of vertices in the set. With this definition, every set of ω&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 vertices in the graph can be partitioned into two subsets whose convex hulls intersect, and ω&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is the minimum number for which this is possible, where ω is the [[clique number]] of the given graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Duchet|1987}}.</ref> For related results involving [[shortest path]]s instead of induced paths see {{harvtxt|Chepoi|1986}} and {{harvtxt|Bandelt|Pesch|1989}}.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Bajmóczy | first1 = E.

The right-hand pane displays the Minkowski sum of the sets, which is the union of the sums having exactly one point from each summand-set; for the displayed sets, the sixteen sums are distinct points, which are displayed in red: The right-hand red sum-points are the sums of the left-hand red summand-points. The convex hull of the sixteen red-points is shaded in pink. In the pink interior of the right-hand sumset lies exactly one plus-symbol, which is the (unique) sum of the plus-symbols from the right-hand side.

Each basket is represented as a non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an ''[[indifference curve]]'' is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's ''preference set'' (relative to an indifference curve) is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's ''preferences'' are ''convex'' if all such preference sets are convex.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mas-Colell|1985|pp=58–61}} and {{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=76–79}}</ref>\n\nAn optimal basket of goods occurs where the budget-line [[supporting hyperplane|supports]] a consumer's preference set, as shown in the diagram. This means that an optimal basket is on the highest possible indifference curve given the budget-line, which is defined in terms of a price vector and the consumer's income (endowment vector). Thus, the set of optimal baskets is a <!--  set valued function, or multifunction, or correspondence or relation-->[[function (mathematics)|function]] of the <!-- relative --> prices, and this function is called the consumer's ''[[demand]]''. If the preference set is convex, then at every price the consumer's demand is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket or a line-segment of baskets.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=79–81}}</ref>\n\n====Non-convex preferences====\n[[File:NonConvex.gif|right|thumb|300px|alt=Image of a non-convex preference set with a concavity un-supported by the budget line|When the consumer's preferences have concavities, the consumer may jump between two separate optimal baskets.]]\n{{See also|Non-convexity (economics)}}\nHowever, if a preference set is ''non-convex'', then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two ''separate'' optimal-baskets. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a [[griffin]])!

In the convexified economy, at each price, the <!-- not necessarily closed -->[[aggregate demand]] was the sum of convex hulls of the consumers' demands. Starr's ideas interested the mathematicians [[Lloyd Shapley]] and [[Jon Folkman]], who proved their [[eponym]]ous <!-- Shapley–Folkman --> lemma and <!-- the Shapley–Folkman --> theorem in \"private correspondence\", <!-- entitled \"Starr's problem\" (1966), --> which was reported by Starr's published paper of 1969.<ref name=\"s69\"/>\n\nIn his 1969 publication, Starr applied the Shapley–Folkman–Starr theorem. Starr proved that the \"convexified\" economy has general equilibria that can be closely approximated by \"''quasi-equilibria''\" of the original economy, when the number of agents exceeds the dimension of the goods: Concretely, Starr proved that there exists at least one quasi-equilibrium of prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub> with the following properties:\n\n* For each quasi-equilibrium's prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub>, all consumers can choose optimal baskets (maximally preferred and meeting their budget constraints).\n* At quasi-equilibrium prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub> in the convexified economy, every good's market is in equilibrium: Its supply equals its demand.\n* For each quasi-equilibrium, the prices \"nearly clear\" the markets for the original economy: an [[upper bound]] on the [[Hausdorff distance|distance]] between the set of equilibria of the  \"convexified\" economy and the set of quasi-equilibria of the original economy followed from Starr's corollary to the Shapley–Folkman theorem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=169–182}}. {{harvtxt|Starr|1969|pp=27–33}}\n</ref>\n\nStarr established that\n<blockquote>\n\"in the aggregate, the discrepancy between an allocation in the fictitious economy generated by [taking the convex hulls of all of the consumption&nbsp;and&nbsp;production sets] and some allocation in the real economy is bounded in a way that is independent of the number of economic agents. Therefore, the average&nbsp;agent experiences a deviation from intended actions that vanishes in significance as the number&nbsp;of&nbsp;agents goes to infinity\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Green|Heller|1981|p=44}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nFollowing Starr's&nbsp;1969 paper, the Shapley–Folkman–Starr results have been widely used in economic theory. [[Roger&nbsp;Guesnerie]] summarized their economic implications: \"<!-- [s] -->Some key results obtained under the convexity assumption remain (approximately) relevant in circumstances where convexity fails.

However, the [[sine|sine&nbsp;function]] (pictured) is non-convex on the [[interval (mathematics)#Terminology|interval]]&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;π).\n\n====Additive optimization problems====\nIn many optimization problems, the [[optimization (mathematics)#objective function|objective function]]&nbsp;f is ''separable'': that is, ''f'' is the sum of ''many'' summand-functions, each of which has its own argument:\n\n: ''f''(''x'') = ''f''<big>(</big>&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>)<big>&nbsp;)</big> = <big>∑</big>&nbsp;''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nFor example, problems of [[linear programming|linear optimization]] are separable. Given a separable problem with an optimal solution, we fix an optimal solution\n\n: ''x''<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''N''</sub>)<sub>min</sub>\n\nwith the minimum value&nbsp;{{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>).}}  For this separable problem, we also consider an optimal solution  <big>(</big>''x''<sub>min</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>) <big>)</big>\nto the \"''convexified problem''\", where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of  the summand functions. Such an optimal solution is the [[limit of a sequence]] of points in the convexified problem\n: <big>(</big>''x''<sub>''j''</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>j</sub>) <big>)</big><big>&nbsp;∈&nbsp;</big> <big>∑</big> Conv <big>(</big>Graph( ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> ) <big>)</big>.<ref name=\"Ekeland76\"/><ref>\nThe [[limit of a sequence]] is a member of the [[closure (topology)|closure of the original set]], which is the smallest [[closed set]] that contains the original set. The Minkowski sum of two [[closed set]]s need not be closed, so the following [[subset#inclusion|inclusion]] can be strict\n: Clos(P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;Clos(Q) ⊆ Clos(&nbsp;Clos(P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;Clos(Q)&nbsp;);\nthe inclusion can be strict even for two ''convex'' closed summand-sets, according to {{harvtxt|Rockafellar|1997|pp=49 and&nbsp;75}}. Ensuring that the Minkowski&nbsp;sum of sets be closed requires the closure operation, which appends limits of convergent sequences.</ref>\nOf course, the given optimal-point  is a sum of points in the graphs of the original summands and of a small number of convexified summands, by the Shapley–Folkman lemma.\n\nThis analysis was published by [[Ivar Ekeland]] in&nbsp;1974 to explain the apparent convexity of separable problems with many summands, despite the non-convexity of the summand problems. In 1973, the young mathematician [[Claude Lemaréchal]] was surprised by his success with [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] [[iterative method|method]]s on problems that were known to be non-convex; for [[nonlinear programming|minimizing nonlinear]] problems, a solution of the [[dual problem]] problem need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem, unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a [[constraint qualification]]. Lemaréchal's problem was additively separable, and each summand function was non-convex; nonetheless, a solution to the dual problem provided a close approximation to the primal problem's optimal value.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lemaréchal|1973|p=38}}: {{citation|last=Lemaréchal|first=Claude|authorlink=Claude Lemaréchal|title=Utilisation de la dualité dans les problémes non&nbsp;convexes [Use of duality for non–convex problems]|language=French| date=April 1973 |issue=16|location=Domaine de&nbsp;Voluceau, [[Rocquencourt]],&nbsp;78150 [[Le Chesnay|Le&nbsp;Chesnay]], France|publisher=[[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|IRIA (now&nbsp;INRIA)]], Laboratoire de recherche en informatique et automatique|page=41|ref=harv}}. <!-- Ekeland cites this report in the ''[[Comptes Rendus|CRAS]]'' announcement of the results of his Appendix&nbsp;I -->\nLemaréchal's experiments were discussed in later publications: <p>{{harvtxt|Aardal|1995|pp=2–3}}: {{cite journal|first=Karen|last=Aardal|authorlink=Karen Aardal|title=''Optima'' interview <!--sic., neither colon nor m-dash appear -->Claude  Lemaréchal|journal=Optima: Mathematical Programming Society newsletter|pages=2–4|date=March 1995|volume=45|url=http://www.mathprog.org/Old-Optima-Issues/optima45.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2011|ref=harv}}</p><p>{{harvtxt|Hiriart-Urruty|Lemaréchal|1993|pp=143–145, 151, 153, and&nbsp;156}}: {{cite book|last1=Hiriart-Urruty|first1=Jean-Baptiste|last2=Lemaréchal|first2=Claude|authorlink2=Claude Lemaréchal|ref=harv|chapter=XII Abstract duality for practitioners|title=Convex analysis and minimization algorithms, Volume&nbsp;'''II''': Advanced theory and bundle methods|series=Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences]|volume=306|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1993|pages=136–193 (and bibliographical comments on pp.&nbsp;334–335)|isbn=3-540-56852-2|mr=1295240}}</p>\n</ref><ref name=\"Ekeland76\" >{{harv|Ekeland|1999|pp=357–359}}: Published in the first English edition of 1976, Ekeland's appendix proves the Shapley–Folkman lemma, also acknowledging [[Claude Lemaréchal|Lemaréchal]]'s experiments on page&nbsp;373.</ref><ref name=\"Ekeland74\" >{{cite journal|last=Ekeland|first=Ivar|<!-- authorlink=Ivar Ekeland -->|title=Une estimation ''a&nbsp;priori'' en programmation non&nbsp;convexe|journal=Comptes&nbsp;Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences|series=Séries&nbsp;A et&nbsp;B|language=French|issn=0151-0509<!-- Not archived on CRAS site, and CRAS's title has changed multiple times -->|volume=279|year=1974|pages=149–151|MR=395844|ref=harv}}<!-- Ekeland sole author; cites Lemaréchal by title whereas the 1976 appendix acknowledges but does not cite Lemaréchal (1973)--></ref> Ekeland's analysis explained the success of methods of convex&nbsp;minimization on ''large'' and ''separable'' problems, despite the non-convexities of the summand functions.

Specifically, for any set of\n:<math>(d + 1)(r - 1) + 1\\ </math>\npoints there exists a point ''x'' (not necessarily one of the given points) and a partition of the given points into ''r'' subsets, such that ''x'' belongs to the convex hull of all of the subsets. The partition resulting from this theorem is known as a '''Tverberg partition'''.\n\n==Examples==\nFor ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, Tverberg's theorem states that any ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points may be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls; this special case is known as [[Radon's theorem]]. In this case, for points in general position, there is a unique partition.\n\nThe case ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 and ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 states that any seven points in the plane may be partitioned into three subsets with intersecting convex hulls. The illustration shows an example in which the seven points are the vertices of a regular [[heptagon]].

Assume such a value is fixed (in practice, <math>h</math> is not known beforehand and multiple passes with increasing values of <math>m</math> will be used, see below).\n\nThe algorithm starts by arbitrarily partitioning the set of points <math>P</math> into <math>K\\leq 1+n/m</math> subsets <math>(Q_k)_{k=1,2,...K}</math> with at most <math>m</math> points each; notice that <math>K=O(n/m)</math>.\n\nFor each subset <math>Q_k</math>, it computes the convex hull, <math>C_k</math>, using an <math>O(p \\log p)</math> algorithm (for example, [[Graham scan]]), where <math>p</math> is the number of points in the subset. As there are <math>K</math> subsets of <math>O(m)</math> points each, this phase takes <math>K\\cdot O(m \\log m) = O(n \\log m)</math> time.\n\nDuring the second phase, [[Gift wrapping algorithm|Jarvis's march]] is executed, making use of the precomputed (mini) convex hulls, <math>(C_k)_{k=1,2,...K}</math>. At each step in this Jarvis's march algorithm, we have a point <math>p_{i}</math> in the convex hull (at the beginning, <math>p_{i}</math> may be the point in <math>P</math> with the lowest y coordinate, which is guaranted to be in the convex hull of <math>P</math>), and need to find a point <math>p_{i+1} = f(p_{i},P)</math> such that all other points of <math>P</math> are to the right of the line <math>p_{i}p_{i+1}</math>{{clarify|reason=Why to the right and not to the left?|date=March 2018}}, where the notation <math>p_{i+1} = f(p_{i},P)</math> simply means that the next point, that is <math>p_{i+1}</math>, is determined as a function of <math>p_{i}</math> and <math>P</math>. The convex hull of the set <math>Q_k</math>, <math>C_k</math>, is known and contains at most <math>m</math> points (listed in a clockwise or counter-clockwise order), which allows to compute <math>f(p_{i},Q_k)</math> in <math>O(\\log m)</math> time by [[binary search]]{{how|date=March 2018}}. Hence, the computation of <math>f(p_{i},Q_k)</math> for all the <math>K</math> subsets can be done in <math>O(K \\log m)</math> time. Then, we can determine <math>f(p_{i},P)</math> using the same technique as normally used in Jarvis's march, but only considering the points <math>(f(p_{i},Q_k))_{1\\leq k\\leq K}</math> (i.e. the points in the mini convex hulls) instead of the whole set <math>P</math>. For those points, one iteration of Jarvis's march is <math>O(K)</math> which is negligible compared to the computation for all subsets. Jarvis's march completes when the process has been repeated <math>O(h)</math> times (because, in the way Jarvis march works, after at most <math>h</math> iterations of its outermost loop, where <math>h</math> is the number of points in the convex hull of <math>P</math>, we must have found the convex hull), hence the second phase takes <math>O(Kh \\log m)</math> time, equivalent to <math>O(n \\log h)</math> time if <math>m</math> is close to <math>h</math> (see below the description of a strategy to choose <math>m</math> such that this is the case).\n\nBy running the two phases described above, the convex hull of <math>n</math> points is computed in <math>O(n \\log h)</math> time.\n\n===Choosing the parameter <math>m</math>===\nIf an arbitrary value is chosen for <math>m</math>, it may happen that <math>m<h</math>. In that case, after <math>m</math> steps in the second phase, we interrupt the [[Gift wrapping algorithm|Jarvis's march]] as running it to the end would take too much time.\nAt that moment, a <math>O(n \\log m)</math> time will have been spent, and the convex hull will not have been calculated.\n\nThe idea is to make multiple passes of the algorithm with increasing values of <math>m</math>; each pass terminates (successfully or unsuccessfully) in <math>O(n \\log m)</math> time. If <math>m</math> increases too slowly between passes, the number of iterations may be large; on the other hand, if it rises too quickly, the first <math>m</math> for which the algorithm terminates successfully may be much larger than <math>h</math>, and produce a complexity <math>O(n \\log m) > O(n \\log h)</math>.\n\n==== Squaring Strategy ====\n\nOne possible strategy is to ''square'' the value of <math>m</math> at each iteration, up to a maximum value of <math>n</math> (corresponding to a partition in singleton sets).<ref>B.

      "text": "Algorithms that construct [[convex hull]]s of various objects have a [[Convex hull#Applications|broad range of applications]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].\n\nIn [[computational geometry]], numerous algorithms are proposed for computing the convex hull of a finite set of points, with various [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexities]].\n\nComputing the convex hull means that a non-ambiguous and efficient [[data structure|representation]] of the required convex shape is constructed. The complexity of the corresponding algorithms is usually estimated in terms  of ''n'', the number of input points, and sometimes also in terms of ''h'', the number of points on the convex hull.\n\n== Planar case ==\nConsider the general case when the input to the algorithm is a finite unordered set of points on a Cartesian plane. An important special case, in which the points are given in the order of traversal of a simple polygon's boundary, is described later in a separate subsection.\n\nIf not all points are on the same line, then their convex hull is a [[convex polygon]] whose vertices are some of the points in the input set. Its most common representation is the list of its vertices ordered along its boundary clockwise or counterclockwise. In some applications it is convenient to represent a convex polygon as an intersection of a set of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-planes]].\n\n===Lower bound on computational complexity===\nFor a finite set of points in the plane the lower bound on the computational complexity of finding the convex hull represented as a convex polygon is easily shown to be the same as for [[sorting]] using the following [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]]. For the set <math>x_1,\\dots,x_n</math> numbers to sort consider the set of points <math>(x_1, x^2_1),\\dots,(x_n, x^2_n)</math> of points in the plane. Since they lie on a [[parabola]], which is a [[convex function|convex curve]] it is easy to see that the vertices of the convex hull, when traversed along the  boundary, produce the sorted order of the numbers <math>x_1,\\dots,x_n</math>. Clearly, [[linear time]] is required for the described transformation of numbers into points and then extracting their sorted order. Therefore, in the general case the convex hull of ''n'' points cannot be computed more quickly than sorting.\n\nThe standard &Omega;(''n'' log ''n'') lower bound for sorting is proven in the [[decision tree model]] of computing, in which only numerical comparisons but not arithmetic operations can be performed; however, in this model, convex hulls cannot be computed at all. Sorting also requires &Omega;(''n'' log ''n'') time in the [[algebraic decision tree]] model of computation, a model that is more suitable for convex hulls, and in this model convex hulls also require &Omega;(''n'' log ''n'') time.<ref name=ps>Preparata, Shamos, ''Computational Geometry'', Chapter \"Convex Hulls: Basic Algorithms\"</ref> However, in models of computer arithmetic that allow numbers to be sorted more quickly than ''O''(''n'' log ''n'') time, for instance by using [[integer sorting]] algorithms, planar convex hulls can also be computed more quickly: the [[Graham scan]] algorithm for convex hulls consists of a single sorting step followed by a linear amount of additional work.\n\n=== Optimal output-sensitive algorithms ===\nAs stated above, the complexity of finding a convex hull as a function of the input size ''n'' is lower bounded by &Omega;(''n'' log ''n''). However, the complexity of some convex hull algorithms can be characterized in terms of both input size ''n'' and the output size ''h'' (the number of points in the hull). Such algorithms are called [[output-sensitive algorithm]]s. They may be asymptotically more efficient than &Theta;(''n'' log ''n'') algorithms in cases when ''h'' = ''o''(''n'').\n\nThe lower bound on worst-case running time of output-sensitive convex hull algorithms was established to be &Omega;(''n'' log ''h'') in the planar case.<ref name=\"ps\" /> There are several algorithms which attain this optimal [[Analysis of algorithms|time complexity]]. The earliest one was introduced by [[David G. Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] and [[Raimund Seidel|Seidel]] in 1986 (who called it \"the [[ultimate convex hull algorithm]]\"). A much simpler algorithm was developed by [[Timothy M. Chan|Chan]] in 1996, and is called [[Chan's algorithm]].\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nKnown convex hull algorithms are listed below, ordered by the date of first publication. Time complexity of each algorithm is stated in terms of the number of inputs points ''n'' and the number of points on the hull ''h''. Note that in the worst case ''h'' may be as large as ''n''.\n\n* '''[[Gift wrapping algorithm|Gift wrapping]]''', a.k.a. '''Jarvis march''' — ''O''(''nh'') <br/> One of the simplest (although not the most time efficient in the worst case) planar algorithms. Created independently by Chand & Kapur in 1970 and R. A. Jarvis in 1973. It has [[Big O notation|O]](''nh'') [[Analysis of algorithms|time complexity]], where ''n'' is the number of points in the set, and ''h'' is the number of points in the hull. In the worst case the complexity is [[Big O notation|&Theta;]](''n<sup>2</sup>'').\n* '''[[Graham scan]]''' — ''O''(''n'' log ''n'') <br/> A slightly more sophisticated, but much more efficient algorithm, published by [[Ronald Graham]] in 1972. If the points are already sorted by one of the coordinates or by the angle to a fixed vector, then the algorithm takes O(''n'') time.\n* '''[[Quickhull]]''' <br/> Created independently in 1977 by W. Eddy and in 1978 by A. Bykat. Just like the [[quicksort]] algorithm, it has the expected time complexity of ''O''(''n'' log ''n''), but may degenerate to ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.\n* '''[[Divide and conquer (Convex Hull)|Divide and conquer]]''' — ''O''(''n'' log ''n'') <br/> Another O(''n'' log ''n'') algorithm, published in 1977 by [[Franco P. Preparata|Preparata]] and Hong.

'''Andrew's algorithm'''— ''O''(''n'' log ''n'') <br/> Published in 1979 by A. M. Andrew. The algorithm can be seen as a variant of Graham scan which sorts the points lexicographically by their coordinates. When the input is already sorted, the algorithm takes ''O''(''n'') time.\n* '''Incremental convex hull algorithm''' — ''O''(''n'' log ''n'') <br/> Published in 1984 by Michael Kallay.\n* '''[[Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm|The ultimate planar convex hull algorithm]]''' — ''O''(''n'' log ''h'') <br/> The first optimal output-sensitive algorithm, it uses the technique of marriage-before-conquest. Published by [[David G. Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] and [[Raimund Seidel|Seidel]] in 1986.\n* '''[[Chan's algorithm]]''' — ''O''(''n'' log ''h'') <br/> A simpler optimal output-sensitive algorithm created by [[Timothy M. Chan|Chan]] in 1996.\n\n=== Akl–Toussaint heuristic <!--linked from 'Godfried Toussaint'-->===\nThe following simple heuristic is often used as the first step in implementations of convex hull algorithms to improve their performance. It is based on the efficient convex hull algorithm by [[Selim Akl]] and [[G. T. Toussaint]], 1978. The idea is to quickly  exclude many points that would not be part of the convex hull anyway.  This method is based on the following idea.  Find the two points with the lowest and highest x-coordinates, and the two points with the lowest and highest y-coordinates. (Each of these operations takes [[Big O notation|O]](''n'').) These four points form a [[quadrilateral|convex quadrilateral]], and all points that lie in this quadrilateral (except for the four initially chosen vertices) are not part of the convex hull.  Finding all of these points that lie in this quadrilateral is also O(''n''), and thus, the entire operation is O(''n''). Optionally, the points with smallest and largest sums of x- and y-coordinates as well as those with smallest and largest differences of x- and y-coordinates can also be added to the quadrilateral, thus forming an irregular convex octagon, whose insides can be safely discarded. If the points are random variables, then for a narrow but commonly encountered class of probability density functions, this ''throw-away'' pre-processing step will make a convex hull algorithm run in linear expected time, even if the worst-case complexity of the convex hull algorithm is quadratic in ''n''.<ref>[[Luc Devroye]] and [[Godfried Toussaint]], \"A note on linear expected time algorithms for finding convex hulls,\" ''Computing'', Vol. 26, 1981, pp. 361-366.</ref>\n\n===On-line and dynamic convex hull problems===\nThe discussion above considers the case when all input points are known in advance. One may consider two other settings.<ref name=ps/>\n* '''Online convex hull problem''': Input points are obtained sequentially one by one. After each point arrives on input, the convex hull for the pointset obtained so far must be efficiently computed.\n* '''[[Dynamic convex hull]] maintenance''': The input points may be sequentially inserted or deleted, and the convex hull must be updated after each insert/delete operation.\n\nInsertion of a point may increase the number of vertices of a convex hull at most by 1, while deletion may convert an ''n''-vertex convex hull into an ''n-1''-vertex one.\n\nThe online version may be handled with O(log ''n'') per point, which is asymptotically optimal. The dynamic version may be handled with O(log<sup>2</sup> ''n'') per operation.<ref name=ps/>\n\n=== Simple polygon ===\nMcCallum and Avis were first to provide a correct algorithm to construct the convex hull of a [[simple polygon]] <math>v_1, ..., v_n</math> in <math>\\ O(n)</math> time. The basic idea is very simple: the leftmost vertex is on the convex hull and we denote it <math>h_1</math>. The second point is assumed to be a candidate convex hull vertex as well. At each step one looks at three consecutive vertices of the polygon, with two first ones tentatively assigned to the growing convex hull and the third one is a new unprocessed vertex of the polygon, say, we denote this as <math>h_{k-1}, h_k, v_i</math>. If the angle is convex, then <math>h_{k+1} = v_i</math> and the whole triple is shifted by one vertex along the polygon. If the resulting angle is concave, then the middle point (<math>h_k</math>) is deleted and the test is repeated for the triple <math>h_{k-2}, h_{k-1}, v_i</math>, etc. until we backtrack either to a convex angle or to point <math>h_1</math>.  After that the next (along the polygon) vertex is added to the triple to be tested, and the process repeats.  However several previously published articles overlooked a possibility that deletion of a vertex from a polygon may result in a self-intersecting polygon, rendering further flow of the algorithm invalid. Fortunately, this case may also be handled efficiently.  Later Tor and Middleditch (1984, \"Convex Decomposition of Simple Polygons\") and independently Melkman (1985, \"Online Construction of the convex hull of a simple polyline\") suggested a simpler approach with the same time complexity.\n\n== Higher dimensions  ==\nA number of algorithms are known for the three-dimensional case, as well as for arbitrary dimensions.<ref>See [[David Mount]]'s [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/754/Lects/754lects.pdf Lecture Notes], including Lecture 4 for recent developments, including\n[[Chan's algorithm]].</ref> [[Chan's algorithm]] is used for dimensions 2 and 3, and [[Quickhull]] is used for computation of the convex hull in higher dimensions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=C.

In higher dimensions, even if the vertices of a convex polytope are known, construction of its [[face (geometry)|face]]s is a non-trivial task, as is the dual problem of constructing the vertices given the faces. The size of the output face information may be exponentially larger than the size of the input vertices, and even in cases where the input and output are both of comparable size the known algorithms for high-dimensional convex hulls are not [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] due both to issues with degenerate inputs and with intermediate results of high complexity.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Avis | first1 = David | author1-link = David Avis\n | last2 = Bremner | first2 = David\n | last3 = Seidel | first3 = Raimund | author3-link = Raimund Seidel\n | doi = 10.1016/S0925-7721(96)00023-5\n | issue = 5–6\n | journal = [[Computational Geometry (journal)|Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications]]\n | pages = 265–301\n | title = How good are convex hull algorithms?\n | volume = 7\n | year = 1997}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Orthogonal convex hull]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Thomas H.

      "text": "The '''dynamic convex hull problem''' is a class of [[dynamic problem (algorithms)|dynamic problem]]s in [[computational geometry]]. The problem consists in the maintenance, i.e., keeping track, of the [[convex hull]] for the dynamically changing input data, i.e., when input data elements may be inserted, deleted, or modified. Problems of this class may be distinguished by the types of the input data and the allowed types of modification of the input data.\n\n==Planar point set==\n\nIt is easy to construct an example for which the convex hull contains all input points, but after the insertion of a single point the convex hull becomes a triangle. And conversely, the deletion of a single point may produce the opposite drastic change of the size of the output. Therefore if the convex hull is required to be reported in traditional way as a polygon,  the [[lower bound]] for the worst-case [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of the recomputation of the convex hull is <math>\\Omega(N)</math>, since this time is required for a mere reporting of the output. This lower bound is attainable, because several general-purpose convex hull algorithms run in linear time when input points are [[sorting|ordered]] in some way and logarithmic-time methods for dynamic maintenance of ordered data are well-known.\n\nThis problem may be overcome by eliminating the restriction on the output representation. There are data structures that can maintain representations of the convex hull in an amount of time per update that is much smaller than linear. For many years the best algorithm of this type was that of Overmars and van Leeuwen (1981), which took time O(log<sup>2</sup> ''n'') per update, but it has since been improved by [[Timothy M. Chan]] and others.\n\nIn a number of applications finding the convex hull is a step in an algorithm for the solution of the overall problem. The selected representation of the convex hull may influence on the computational complexity of further operations of the overall algorithm. For example, the [[point in polygon]] query for a convex polygon represented by the ordered set of its vertices may be answered in logarithmic time, which would be impossible for convex hulls reported by the set of it vertices without any additional information. Therefore some research of dynamic convex hull algorithms involves the  computational complexity of various [[geometric search problems]] with convex hulls stored in specific kinds of data structures. The mentioned approach of Overmars and van Leeuwen allows for logarithmic complexity of various common queries.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Overmars | first1 = M.

The red lines are already placed lines, the Black line is the current best guess for the new line, and the green line is the next guess]]\n\nIn [[computational geometry]], the '''gift wrapping algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for computing the [[convex hull]] of a given set of points.\n\n==Planar case==\nIn the two-dimensional case the algorithm is also known as '''Jarvis march''', after R. A. Jarvis, who published it in 1973; it has [[Big O notation|O]](''nh'') [[time complexity]], where ''n'' is the number of points and ''h'' is the number of points on the convex hull. Its real-life performance compared with other convex hull algorithms is favorable when n is small or h is expected to be very small with respect to n{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. In general cases, the algorithm is outperformed by many others {{examples|date=March 2018}} {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\n==Algorithm==\nFor the sake of simplicity, the description below assumes that the points are in [[general position]], i.e., no three points are [[collinear]]. The algorithm may be easily modified to deal with collinearity, including the choice whether it should report only  [[extreme point]]s (vertices of the convex hull) or all points that lie on the convex hull{{citation needed|reason=Link to a resource describing the details for these degenerate cases required.|date=March 2018}}. Also, the complete implementation must deal{{how|date=March 2018}} with [[degenerate case]]s when the convex hull has only 1 or 2 vertices, as well as with the issues of limited [[arithmetic precision]], both of computer computations and input data.\n \nThe gift wrapping algorithm begins with ''i''=0 and a point ''p<sub>0</sub>'' known to be on the convex hull, e.g., the leftmost point, and selects the point ''p<sub>i+1</sub>'' such that all points are to the right of the line ''p<sub>i</sub> p<sub>i+1</sub>''. This point may be found in O(''n'') time by comparing [[Polar coordinate system|polar angle]]s of all points with respect to point ''p<sub>i</sub>'' taken for the center of [[polar coordinates]]. Letting ''i''=''i''+1, and repeating with until one reaches ''p<sub>h</sub>''=''p<sub>0</sub>'' again yields the convex hull in ''h'' steps.  In two dimensions, the gift wrapping algorithm is similar to the process of winding a string (or wrapping paper) around the set of points.\n\nThe approach can be extended to higher dimensions.\n\n==Pseudocode==\n[[File:Jarvis march convex hull algorithm diagram.svg|thumb|280px|right|Jarvis's march computing the convex hull.]]\n<pre>\njarvis(S)\n  // S is the set of points\n  pointOnHull = leftmost point in S // which is guaranteed to be part of the CH(S)\n  i = 0\n  repeat\n    P[i] = pointOnHull\n    endpoint = S[0]      // initial endpoint for a candidate edge on the hull\n    for j from 1 to |S|\n      if (endpoint == pointOnHull) or (S[j] is on left of line from P[i] to endpoint)\n          endpoint = S[j]   // found greater left turn, update endpoint\n    i = i+1\n    pointOnHull = endpoint\n  until endpoint == P[0]      // wrapped around to first hull point\n</pre>\n\n==Complexity==\nThe inner loop checks every point in the set ''S'', and the outer loop repeats for each point on the hull.  Hence the total run time is <math>O(nh)</math>.  The run time depends on the size of the output, so Jarvis's march is an [[output-sensitive algorithm]].\n\nHowever, because the running time depends [[linear time|linearly]] on the number of hull vertices, it is only faster than  <math>O(n \\log n)</math> algorithms such as [[Graham scan]] when the number ''h'' of hull vertices is smaller than log&nbsp;''n''. [[Chan's algorithm]], another convex hull algorithm, combines the logarithmic dependence of Graham scan with the output sensitivity of the gift wrapping algorithm, achieving an asymptotic running time  <math>O(n \\log h)</math>  that improves on both Graham scan and gift wrapping.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Convex hull algorithms]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Introduction to Algorithms|2|chapter=33.3: Finding the convex hull|pages= 955&ndash;956}}\n*{{cite journal\n | author = Jarvis, R.

It uses a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] to detect and remove concavities in the boundary efficiently.\n\n== Algorithm ==\n[[Image:Graham Scan.svg|frame|right|As one can see, PAB and ABC are counterclockwise, but BCD isn't. The algorithm detects this situation and discards previously chosen segments until the turn taken is counterclockwise (ABD in this case.)]]\nThe first step in this algorithm is to find the point with the lowest y-coordinate. If the lowest y-coordinate exists in more than one point in the set, the point with the lowest x-coordinate out of the candidates should be chosen. Call this point ''P''. This step takes [[Big O notation|O]](''n''), where ''n'' is the number of points in question.\n\nNext, the set of points must be sorted in increasing order of the angle they and the point ''P'' make with the x-axis. Any general-purpose [[sorting algorithm]] is appropriate for this, for example [[heapsort]] (which is O(''n'' log ''n'')).\n\nSorting in order of angle does not require computing the angle.  It is possible to use any function of the angle which is monotonic in the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>[0,\\pi]</math> .  The cosine is easily computed using the [[dot product]], or the slope of the line may be used. If numeric precision is at stake, the comparison function used by the sorting algorithm can use the sign of the [[cross product]] to determine relative angles.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by considering each of the points in the sorted array in sequence. For each point, it is first determined whether traveling from the two points immediately preceding this point constitutes making a left turn or a right turn. If a right turn, the second-to-last point is not part of the convex hull, and lies 'inside' it. The same determination is then made for the set of the latest point and the two points that immediately precede the point found to have been inside the hull, and is repeated until a \"left turn\" set is encountered, at which point the algorithm moves on to the next point in the set of points in the sorted array minus any points that were found to be inside the hull; there is no need to consider these points again. (If at any stage the three points are collinear, one may opt either to discard or to report it, since in some applications it is required to find all points on the boundary of the convex hull.)\n\nAgain, determining whether three points constitute a \"left turn\" or a \"right turn\" does not require computing the actual angle between the two line segments, and can actually be achieved with simple arithmetic only. For three points <math>P_1 = (x_1,y_1)</math>, <math>P_2 = (x_2,y_2)</math> and <math>P_3 = (x_3,y_3)</math>, compute the ''z''-coordinate of the [[cross product]] of the two [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] <math>\\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}</math> and <math>\\overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</math>, which is given by the expression <math>(x_2-x_1)(y_3-y_1)-(y_2-y_1)(x_3-x_1)</math>. If the result is 0, the points are collinear; if it is positive, the three points constitute a \"left turn\" or counter-clockwise orientation, otherwise a \"right turn\" or clockwise orientation (for counter-clockwise numbered points).\n\nThis process will eventually return to the point at which it started, at which point the algorithm is completed and the stack now contains the points on the convex hull in counterclockwise order.\n\n== Time complexity ==\nSorting the points has time complexity O(''n'' log ''n''). \nWhile it may seem that the time complexity of the loop is O(''n''<sup>2</sup>), because for each point it goes back to check if any of the previous points make a \"right turn\", it is actually O(''n''), because each point is considered at most twice in some sense.\nEach point can appear only once as a point <math>(x_2,y_2)</math> in a \"left turn\" (because the algorithm advances to the next point <math>(x_3,y_3)</math> after that),\nand as a point <math>(x_2,y_2)</math> in a \"right turn\" (because the point <math>(x_2,y_2)</math> is removed). The overall time complexity is therefore O(''n'' log ''n''), since the time to sort dominates the time to actually compute the convex hull.\n\n== Pseudocode ==\nThe code below uses a function ccw: ccw > 0 if three points make a counter-clockwise turn, clockwise if ccw < 0, and collinear if ccw = 0. (In real applications, if the coordinates are arbitrary real numbers, the function requires exact comparison of floating-point numbers, and one has to beware of numeric singularities for \"nearly\" collinear points.)\n\nThen let the result be stored in the <code>stack</code>.\n\n '''let''' points '''be''' the list of points\n '''let''' stack = empty_stack()\n \n '''find''' the lowest y-coordinate and leftmost point, called P0\n '''sort''' points by polar angle with P0, if several points have the same polar angle then only keep the farthest\n \n '''for''' point '''in''' points:\n     # pop the last point from the stack if we turn clockwise to reach this point\n     '''while''' '''count''' stack > 1 and '''ccw'''(next_to_top(stack), top(stack), point) < 0:\n         '''pop''' stack\n     '''push''' point '''to''' stack\n '''end'''\n\nNow the stack contains the convex hull, where the points are oriented counter-clockwise and P0 is the first point.\n\nHere, <code>next_to_top()</code> is a function for returning the item one entry below the top of stack, without changing the stack, and similarly, <code>top()</code> for returning the topmost element.\n\nThis pseudocode is adapted from ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]''.\n\n== Notes ==\nThe same basic idea works also if the input is sorted on x-coordinate instead of angle, and the hull is computed in two steps producing the upper and the lower parts of the hull respectively. This modification was devised by A. M. Andrew<ref>{{cite journal|title=Another efficient algorithm for convex hulls in two dimensions|first=A.

Therefore, maintaining the upper and lower envelopes of a set of moving lines is equivalent to maintaining the convex hull of a set of moving points. Computing upper and lower envelopes are equivalent problems, so computing the upper envelope of a set of lines is equivalent to computing the convex hull of a set of moving points.\nThe upper envelope of a set of static lines can be computed using a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] which partitions the lines into two sets of equal size, calls itself recursively on the two sets to find their upper envelopes, and then merges the two resulting upper envelopes. The merge step is performed using a [[Sweep line algorithm|vertical line sweep]]. Call the first set of points blue and the second set of points red.\n\nThe standard line sweep algorithm for merging upper envelopes sweeps though all of vertices of the red and blue upper envelopes, from left to right. The most recently encountered red and blue points are maintained as the line sweeps. When a point is encountered, the algorithm checks if the point is above or below the segment following the last encountered point of the opposite color. If it is above, that point is added to the merged upper envelope. If it is of a different color than the last added point, the red and blue envelopes have crossed, so the intersection point is also added to the merged upper envelope.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=John |last=Hershberger |title=Finding the upper envelope of ''n'' line segments in O(''n'' log ''n'') time |journal=Information Processing Letters |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=21 December 1989 |pages=169–174 |doi=10.1016/0020-0190(89)90136-1}}</ref>\n\nThe sequence of edges and vertices resulting from this algorithm is only dependent on the ordering of points, and the results of the line-point comparisons. Thus, the result can be certified with the following certificates:\n*x-certificates (<math><_x</math>) are used to certify the order the vertices of the red and blue envelopes. They are the certificates for a [[kinetic sorted list]] on the set of vertices. Since each point involves 2 lines, and the certificate involves 2 points, each certificate involves 4 lines.\n*y-certificates (<math><_y</math>) are used to certify that a vertex is above or below an edge. The certificates appear for all comparisons that would occur during the algorithm.\nAs long as all of these certificates hold, the merge steps will be executed identically, so the resulting upper envelope will be the same. A kinetic data structure for upper envelopes can be created by using these certificates to certify the static upper envelope algorithm.

Preparata|Preparata]] and Hong, dubbed \"marriage-before-conquest\" by the authors. \n\nThe traditional divide-and-conquer algorithm splits the input points into two equal parts, e.g., by a vertical line, [[recursively]] finds convex hulls for the left and right subsets of the input, and then merges the two hulls into one by finding the \"bridge edges\", [[bitangent]]s that connect the two hulls from above and below.\n\nThe Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm splits the input as before, by finding the [[median]] of the ''x''-coordinates of the input points. However, the algorithm reverses the order of the subsequent steps: its next step is to find the edges of the convex hull that intersect the vertical line defined by this median x-coordinate, which turns out to require linear time <ref>Original paper by Kirkpatrick / Seidel (1986), p. 10, theorem 3.1</ref>. The points on the left and right sides of the splitting line that cannot contribute to the eventual hull are discarded, and the algorithm proceeds recursively on the remaining points. In more detail, the algorithm performs a separate recursion for the upper and lower parts of the convex hull; in the recursion for the upper hull, the noncontributing points to be discarded are those below the bridge edge vertically, while in the recursion for the lower hull the points above the bridge edge vertically are discarded.\n\nAt the <math>i</math>th level of the recursion, the algorithm solves at most <math>2^i</math> subproblems, each of size at most <math>\\frac{n}{2^i}</math>. The total number of subproblems considered is at most <math>h</math>, since each subproblem finds a new convex hull edge. The worst case occurs when no points can be discarded and the subproblems are as large as possible; that is, when there are exactly <math>2^i</math> subproblems in each level of recursion up to level <math>\\log_2 h</math> . For this worst case, there are <math>\\mathcal{O}(\\log h)</math> levels of recursion and <math>\\mathcal{O}(n)</math> points considered within each level, so the total running time is <math>\\mathcal{O}(n \\log h)</math> as stated.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Convex hull algorithms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm}}\n[[Category:Convex hull algorithms]]"

It was discovered by [[Eduard Helly]] in 1913,<ref>{{harvtxt|Danzer|Grünbaum|Klee|1963}}.</ref> but not published by him until 1923, by which time alternative proofs by {{harvtxt|Radon|1921}} and {{harvtxt|König|1922}} had already appeared. Helly's theorem gave rise to the notion of a [[Helly family]].\n\n==Statement==\nLet {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X<sub>n</sub>''}} be a finite collection of convex subsets of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>}}, with {{math|''n'' > ''d''}}. If the intersection of every {{math|''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}} of these sets is nonempty, then the whole collection has a nonempty intersection; that is,\n\n:<math>\\bigcap_{j=1}^n X_j\\ne\\varnothing.</math>\n\nFor infinite collections one has to assume compactness: \n\nLet {{math|{''X<sub>α</sub>''} }} be a collection of [[compact set|compact]] convex subsets of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>}}, such that every subcollection of [[cardinality]] at most {{math|''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}} has nonempty intersection. Then the whole collection has nonempty intersection.\n\n==Proof==\nWe prove the finite version, using [[Radon's theorem]] as in the proof by {{harvtxt|Radon|1921}}. The infinite version then follows by the [[finite intersection property]] characterization of [[Compact space|compactness]]: a collection of closed subsets of a compact space has a non-empty intersection if and only if every finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection (once you fix a single set, the intersection of all others with it are closed subsets of a fixed compact space).\n\nThe proof is by [[mathematical induction|induction]]:\n\n'''Base case:''' Let {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2}}. By our assumptions, for every {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n''}} there is a point {{math|''x<sub>j</sub>''}} that is in the common intersection of all {{math|''X<sub>i</sub>''}} with the possible exception of {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>''}}. Now we apply [[Radon's theorem]] to the set {{math|''A'' {{=}} {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''},}} which furnishes us with disjoint subsets {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>}} of {{mvar|A}} such that the [[convex hull]] of {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>}} intersects the convex hull of {{math|''A''<sub>2</sub>}}. Suppose that {{mvar|p}} is a point in the intersection of these two convex hulls. We claim that \n\n:<math>p\\in\\bigcap_{j=1}^n X_j.</math>\n\nIndeed, consider any {{math|''j'' ∈ {1, ..., ''n''}.}} We shall prove that {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X<sub>j</sub>''.}} Note that the only element of {{mvar|A}} that may not be in {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>''}} is {{math|''x<sub>j</sub>''}}. If {{math|''x<sub>j</sub>'' ∈ ''A''<sub>1</sub>}}, then {{math|''x<sub>j</sub>'' ∉ ''A''<sub>2</sub>}}, and therefore {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>'' ⊃ ''A''<sub>2</sub>}}. Since {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>''}} is convex, it then also contains the convex hull of {{math|''A''<sub>2</sub>}} and therefore also {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X<sub>j</sub>''}}. Likewise, if {{math|''x<sub>j</sub>'' ∉ ''A''<sub>1</sub>}}, then {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>'' ⊃ ''A''<sub>1</sub>}}, and by the same reasoning {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X<sub>j</sub>''}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is in every {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>''}}, it must also be in the intersection.\n\nAbove, we have assumed that the points {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''}} are all distinct. If this is not the case, say {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} ''x<sub>k</sub>''}} for some {{math|''i'' ≠ ''k''}}, then {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} is in every one of the sets {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>''}}, and again we conclude that the intersection is nonempty. This completes the proof in the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2}}.\n\n'''Inductive Step:''' Suppose {{math|''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2}} and that the statement is true for {{math|''n''−1}}. The argument above shows that any subcollection of {{math|''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2}} sets will have nonempty intersection. We may then consider the collection where we replace the two sets {{math|''X''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}} and {{math|''X<sub>n</sub>''}} with the single set {{math|''X''<sub>''n''−1</sub> ∩ ''X<sub>n</sub>''}}. In this new collection, every subcollection of {{math|''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}} sets will have nonempty intersection. The inductive hypothesis therefore applies, and shows that this new collection has nonempty intersection. This implies the same for the original collection, and completes the proof.\n\n== See also == \n* [[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)|Carathéodory's theorem]]\n* [[Shapley–Folkman lemma]]\n* [[Krein–Milman theorem]]\n* [[Choquet theory]]\n* [[Radon's theorem]], and its generalization, [[Tverberg's theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last = Bollobás | first = B. | author-link = Béla Bollobás\n | contribution = Problem 29, Intersecting Convex Sets: Helly's Theorem\n | isbn = 0-521-69395-0\n | pages = 90–91\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | title = The Art of Mathematics: Coffee Time in Memphis\n | year = 2006}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Danzer | first1 = L.\n | last2 = Grünbaum | first2 = B. | author2-link = Branko Grünbaum\n | last3 = Klee | first3 = V. | author3-link = Victor Klee\n | contribution = Helly's theorem and its relatives\n | pages = 101–180\n | publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]]\n | series = Proc.

Integration is one of the two main operations of [[calculus]], with its inverse operation, [[derivative|differentiation]], being the other. Given a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} of a [[Real number|real]] [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] {{mvar|x}} and an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} of the [[real line]], the '''definite integral'''\n\n: <math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nis defined informally as the signed [[area (geometry)|area]] of the region in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane that is bounded by the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of {{mvar|f}}, the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the vertical lines {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}}. The area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis adds to the total and that below the {{mvar|x}}-axis subtracts from the total.\n\nThe operation of integration, up to an additive constant, is the inverse of the operation of differentiation. For this reason, the term ''integral'' may also refer to the related notion of the [[antiderivative]], a function {{mvar|F}} whose derivative is the given function {{mvar|f}}. In this case, it is called an indefinite integral and is written:\n:<math>F(x) = \\int f(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nThe integrals discussed in this article are those termed ''definite integrals''. It is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if {{mvar|f}} is a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then, once an antiderivative {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|f}} is known, the definite integral of {{mvar|f}} over that interval is given by\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\, f(x) dx = \\left[ F(x) \\right]_{a}^{b} = F(b) - F(a) \\, .</math>\n\nThe principles of integration were formulated independently by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of [[infinitesimal]] width. [[Bernhard Riemann]] gave a rigorous mathematical definition of integrals. It is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear]] region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the 19th century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the [[Domain of a function|domain]] over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A [[line integral]] is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is replaced by a [[curve]] connecting the two endpoints. In a [[surface integral]], the curve is replaced by a piece of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] in [[three-dimensional space]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of calculus}}\n\n===Pre-calculus integration===\nThe first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the [[method of exhaustion]] of the [[ancient Greek]] astronomer [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (''ca.'' 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for [[parabola]]s and an approximation to the [[area of a circle]].\n\nA similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by [[Liu Hui]], who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians [[Zu Chongzhi]] and [[Zu Geng (mathematician)|Zu Geng]] to find the volume of a sphere ({{harvnb|Shea | 2007}}; {{harvnb|Katz|2004|pp=125–126}}).\n\nIn the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as [[Alhazen]] ({{c.|lk=no|965|1040}}&nbsp;{{sc|ce}}) derived a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s. He used the results to carry out what would now be called an integration of this function, where the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].<ref name=katz>Katz, V.J. 1995. \"Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India.\" ''Mathematics Magazine'' (Mathematical Association of America), 68(3):163–174.</ref>\n\nThe next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] with his [[method of Indivisibles]], and work by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of {{math|''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}} up to degree {{math|''n'' {{=}} 9}} in [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. Further steps were made in the early 17th century by [[Isaac Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and [[Differential calculus|differentiation]]. Barrow provided the first proof of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. [[John Wallis|Wallis]] generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of {{mvar|x}} to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.\n\n===Newton and Leibniz===\nThe major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern [[calculus]], whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.\n<!--- Please, do not remove: helpful for verification\nThe last sentence originally said 'work of Newton and Leibniz', but for integrals, only Leibniz's notation is used. --->\n\n===Formalization===\nWhile Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of [[Rigor#Mathematical rigour|rigour]]. [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them \"[[The Analyst#Content|ghosts of departed quantities]]\". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]]. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of [[Fourier analysis]]—to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] formulated a [[#Lebesgue integral|different definition of integral]], founded in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] (a subfield of [[real analysis]]). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the [[standard part]] of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the [[hyperreal number]] system.\n\n===Historical notation===\n[[Isaac Newton]] used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with {{math|{{overset|'''.'''|''x''}}}} or {{math|''x''′}}, which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.\n\nThe modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 ({{Harvnb|Burton|1988|loc=p.&nbsp;359}}; {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1899|loc=p.&nbsp;154}}). He adapted the [[integral symbol]], '''∫''', from the letter ''ſ'' ([[long s]]), standing for ''summa'' (written as ''ſumma''; Latin for \"sum\" or \"total\"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by [[Joseph Fourier]] in ''Mémoires'' of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in his book of 1822 ({{Harvnb|Cajori|1929|loc=pp.&nbsp;249–250}}; {{Harvnb|Fourier|1822|loc=§231}}).\n\n==Applications==\nIntegrals are used extensively in many areas of mathematics as well as in many other areas that rely on mathematics.\n\nFor example, in [[probability theory]], integrals are used to determine the probability of some [[random variable]] falling within a certain range. Moreover, the integral under an entire [[probability density function]] must equal 1, which provides a test of whether a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with no negative values could be a density function or not.\n\nIntegrals can be used for computing the [[area]] of a two-dimensional region that has a curved boundary, as well as [[Volume integral|computing the volume]] of a three-dimensional object that has a curved boundary. The area of a two-dimensional region can be calculated using the aforementioned definite integral.\n\nThe volume of a three-dimensional object such as a disc or washer, as outlined in [[Disc integration]] can be computed using the equation for the volume of a cylinder, <math>\\pi r^2 h </math>, where <math>r</math> is the radius, which in this case would be the distance from the curve of a function to the line about which it is being rotated. For a simple disc, the radius will be the equation of the function minus the given <math>x</math>-value or <math>y</math>-value of the line. For instance, the radius of a disc created by rotating a quadratic <math>y = -x^2 + 4</math> around the line <math>y = -1</math> would be given by the expression <math>-x^2 + 4 -(-1)</math>or <math>-x^2 + 5</math>. In order to find the volume for this same shape, an integral with bounds <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> such that <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are intersections of the line <math>y = -x^2 + 4</math> and <math>y = -1</math> would be used as follows:<math display=\"block\">\\pi \\int_{a}^{b} (-x^2 + 5)^2 dx</math>The components of the above integral represent the variables in the equation for the volume of a cylinder, <math>\\pi r^2 h </math>. The constant pi is factored out, while the radius, <math>-x^2 + 5</math>, is squared within the integral. The height, represented in the volume formula by <math>h</math>, is given in this integral by the infinitesimally small (in order to approximate the volume with the greatest possible accuracy) term <math>dx</math>.\n\nIntegrals are also used in physics, in areas like [[kinematics]] to find quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[time]], and [[velocity]]. For example, in rectilinear motion, the displacement of an object over the time interval <math>[a,b]</math> is given by:\n\n:<math>x(b)-x(a) = \\int_a^b v(t) \\,dt,</math>\n\nwhere <math>v(t)</math> is the velocity expressed as a function of time. The work done by a force <math>F(x)</math> (given as a function of position) from an initial position <math>A</math> to a final position <math>B</math> is:\n\n:<math>W_{A\\rightarrow B} = \\int_A^B F(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nIntegrals are also used in [[thermodynamics]], where [[thermodynamic integration]] is used to calculate the difference in free energy between two given states.\n\n==Terminology and notation==\n\n===Standard===\nThe integral with respect to {{mvar|x}} of a [[real-valued function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} of a real variable {{mvar|x}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is written as\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx</math>.\n\nThe integral sign {{math|∫}} represents integration. The symbol {{mvar|dx}}, called the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] of the variable {{mvar|x}}, indicates that the variable of integration is {{mvar|x}}. The function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} to be integrated is called the integrand. The symbol {{mvar|dx}} is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown). If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b|}} are called the limits of the integral. An integral where the limits are specified is called a definite integral. The integral is said to be over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n\nIf the integral goes from a finite value ''a'' to the upper limit infinity, the integral expresses the limit of the integral from ''a'' to a value ''b'' as ''b'' goes to infinity. If the value of the integral gets closer and closer to a finite value, the integral is said to [[convergence (mathematics)|converge]] to that value. If not, the integral is said to diverge.\n\nWhen the limits are omitted, as in\n:<math>\\int f(x) \\,dx,</math>\nthe integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the [[antiderivative]]) whose derivative is the integrand. The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. Occasionally, limits of integration are omitted for definite integrals when the same limits occur repeatedly in a particular context. Usually, the author will make this convention clear at the beginning of the relevant text.\n\nThere are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article).\n\n=== Meaning of the symbol ''dx'' ===\nHistorically, the symbol ''dx'' was taken to represent an infinitesimally \"small piece\" of the independent variable ''x'' to be multiplied by the integrand and summed up in an infinite sense. While this notion is still heuristically useful, later mathematicians have deemed infinitesimal quantities to be untenable from the standpoint of the real number system.<ref>In the 20th century, [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard analysis]] was developed as a new approach to calculus that incorporates a rigorous concept of infinitesimals by using an expanded number system called the [[hyperreal number]]s. Though placed on a sound axiomatic footing and of interest in its own right as a new area of investigation, nonstandard analysis remains somewhat controversial from a pedagogical standpoint, with proponents pointing out the intuitive nature of infinitesimals for beginning students of calculus and opponents criticizing the logical complexity of the system as a whole.</ref> In introductory calculus, the expression ''dx'' is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is viewed as part of the symbol for integration and serves as its delimiter on the right side of the expression being integrated.\n\nIn more sophisticated contexts, ''dx'' can have its own significance, the meaning of which depending on the particular area of mathematics being discussed. When used in one of these ways, the original Leibnitz notation is co-opted to apply to a generalization of the original definition of the integral. Some common interpretations of ''dx'' include: an integrator function in [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral|Riemann-Stieltjes integration]] (indicated by ''dα''(''x'') in general), a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] in Lebesgue theory (indicated by ''dμ'' in general), or a [[differential form]] in exterior calculus (indicated by <math>dx^{i_1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_k}</math> in general). In the last case, even the letter ''d'' has an independent meaning — as the [[exterior derivative]] operator on differential forms.\n\nConversely, in advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out ''dx'' when only the simple Riemann integral is being used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write <math display=\"inline\">\\int_a^b (c_1f+c_2g) = c_1\\int_a^b f + c_2\\int_a^b g </math> to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof.\n\n===Variants===\nIn [[modern Arabic mathematical notation]], a reflected integral symbol [[File:ArabicIntegralSign.svg|16px]] is used instead of the symbol {{math|∫}}, since the Arabic script and mathematical expressions go right to left.<ref>{{Harv|W3C|2006}}.</ref>\n\nSome authors, particularly of European origin, use an upright \"d\" to indicate the variable of integration (i.e., {{math|d''x''}} instead of {{math|''dx''}}), since properly speaking, \"d\" is not a variable.\n\nThe symbol {{mvar|dx}} is not always placed after {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, as for instance in\n:<math>\\int\\limits_0^1 \\frac{3\\ dx}{x^2+1}\\quad</math> or <math>\\quad\\int_{0}^{1} dx \\int_{0}^{1} dy\\ e^{-(x^2+y^2)} </math>.\nIn the first expression, the differential is treated as an infinitesimal \"multiplicative\" factor, formally following a \"commutative property\" when \"multiplied\" by the expression 3/(''x''<sup>2</sup>+1). In the second expression, showing the differentials first highlights and clarifies the variables that are being integrated with respect to, a practice particularly popular with physicists.\n\n==Interpretations of the integral==\nIntegrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but [[precision engineering]] (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.\n\n[[File:Integral approximations.svg|thumb|right|Approximations to integral of {{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} from 0 to 1, with 5 <span style=\"color:#fec200\">■</span>&nbsp; (yellow) right endpoint partitions and 12 <span style=\"color:#009246\">■</span>&nbsp; (green) left endpoint partitions|alt=Integral approximation example]]\nTo start off, consider the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} between {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} with {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} (see figure). We ask:\n:What is the area under the function {{mvar|f}}, in the interval from 0 to 1?\nand call this (yet unknown) area the (definite) '''integral''' of {{mvar|f}}. The notation for this integral will be\n:<math>\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{x}\\ dx.</math>\n\nAs a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} to {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(0) {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(1) {{=}} 1}}. Its area is exactly 1. Actually, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles gives a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus {{math|{{sqrt|1/5}}}}, {{math|{{sqrt|2/5}}}}, and so on to {{math|{{sqrt|1}} {{=}} 1}}. Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely\n:<math>\\textstyle \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}-0\\right)+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}\\left(\\frac{2}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)+\\cdots+\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{5}}\\left(\\frac{5}{5}-\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\approx 0.7497.</math>\n\nWe are taking a sum of finitely many function values of {{mvar|f}}, multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will always be too high and will never be exact. Alternatively, replacing these subintervals by ones with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximation that is too low: for example, with twelve such subintervals we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203.\n\nThe key idea is the transition from adding ''finitely many'' differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or ''[[infinitesimal]]'' steps. When this transition is completed in the above example, it turns out that the area under the curve within the stated bounds is 2/3.\n\nThe notation\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\ dx</math>\nconceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated {{mvar|s}}, of function values, {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called ''differentials'', denoted by {{mvar|dx}}.\n\n<!-- Note: Today's limits of integration were not part of the notation until much later, due to Fourier. -->Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of weighted sums, so that the {{mvar|dx}} suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann's dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]], which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of \"measure\" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation\n:<math>\\int_A f(x)\\ d\\mu</math>\nrefers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with {{mvar|μ}} measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here {{mvar|A}} denotes the region of integration.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 300\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header = Darboux sums\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align =\n| footer_background =\n| background color =\n\n|image1=Riemann Integration and Darboux Upper Sums.gif\n|width1=300\n|caption1=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux upper sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}</div>\n|alt1=Upper Darboux sum example\n\n|image2=Riemann Integration and Darboux Lower Sums.gif\n|width2=300\n|caption2=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux lower sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}</div>\n|alt2=Lower Darboux sum example\n}}\n\n==Formal definitions==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n\n| image = Integral Riemann sum.png\n| alt1 = Riemann integral approximation example\n| caption1 = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Integral example with irregular partitions (largest marked in red)</div>\n\n| image2 = Riemann sum convergence.png\n| alt2 = Riemann sum convergence\n| caption2 = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Riemann sums converging</div>\n}}\n\nThere are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.\n\n===Riemann integral===\n{{Main|Riemann integral}}\n\nThe Riemann integral is defined in terms of [[Riemann sum]]s of functions with respect to ''tagged partitions'' of an interval.<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Riemann Sum |id=RiemannSum}}</ref> Let {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} be a [[Interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] of the real line; then a ''tagged partition'' of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a finite sequence\n\n:<math> a = x_0 \\le t_1 \\le x_1 \\le t_2 \\le x_2 \\le \\cdots \\le x_{n-1} \\le t_n \\le x_n = b . \\,\\!</math>\n\nThis partitions the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into {{mvar|n}} sub-intervals {{math|[''x''<sub>''i''−1</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>]}} indexed by {{mvar|i}}, each of which is \"tagged\" with a distinguished point {{math|''t''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ [''x''<sub>''i''−1</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>]}}. A ''Riemann sum'' of a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i) \\Delta_i ; </math>\nthus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let {{math|Δ<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>−''x''<sub>''i''−1</sub>}} be the width of sub-interval {{mvar|i}}; then the ''mesh'' of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, {{math|max<sub>''i''{{=}}1...''n''</sub> Δ<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The ''Riemann integral'' of a function {{mvar|f}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is equal to {{mvar|S}} if:\n:For all {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}} there exists {{math|''δ'' &gt; 0}} such that, for any tagged partition {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} with mesh less than {{mvar|δ}}, we have\n::<math>\\left| S - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i)\\Delta_i \\right| < \\varepsilon.</math>\nWhen the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower) [[Darboux integral|Darboux sum]], suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the [[Darboux integral]].\n\n===Lebesgue integral===\n{{Main|Lebesgue integration}}\n[[Image:RandLintegrals.svg|thumb|250px|Riemann–Darboux's integration (top) and Lebesgue integration (bottom)|alt=Comparison of Riemann and Lebesgue integrals]]\n\nIt is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated {{Harv|Rudin|1987}}.\n\nSuch an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus [[Henri Lebesgue]] introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to [[Paul Montel]]:\n{{quote|I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.|{{harvtxt|Siegmund-Schultze|2008}}}}\n\nAs {{Harvtxt|Folland|1984|loc=p.&nbsp;56}} puts it, \"To compute the Riemann integral of {{mvar|f}}, one partitions the domain {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into subintervals\", while in the Lebesgue integral, \"one is in effect partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}} \". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]], μ. In the simplest case, the [[Lebesgue measure]] {{math|''μ''(''A'')}} of an interval {{math|''A'' {{=}} [''a'', ''b'']}} is its width, {{math|''b'' − ''a''}}, so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.\n\nUsing the \"partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}} \" philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function {{math|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} should be the sum over {{mvar|t}} of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between {{math|1=''y'' = ''t''}} and {{math|1=''y'' = ''t'' + ''dt''}}. This area is just {{math|''μ''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''t''} ''dt''}}. Let {{math|1=''f''<sup>∗</sup>(''t'') = ''μ''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''t''}}}. The Lebesgue integral of {{mvar|f}} is then defined by {{harv|Lieb|Loss|2001}}\n:<math>\\int f = \\int_0^\\infty f^*(t)\\,dt</math>\nwhere the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral ({{math|''f''<sup>∗</sup>}} is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a [[well-defined]] improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the [[measurable function]]s) this defines the Lebesgue integral.\n\nA general measurable function {{mvar|f}} is Lebesgue-integrable if the sum of the absolute values of the areas of the regions between the graph of {{mvar|f}} and the {{mvar|x}}-axis is finite:\n:<math>\\int_E |f|\\,d\\mu < + \\infty.</math>\nIn that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the area below the {{mvar|x}}-axis:\n:<math>\\int_E f \\,d\\mu = \\int_E f^+ \\,d\\mu - \\int_E f^- \\,d\\mu</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{3}\n & f^+(x) &&{}={} \\max \\{f(x),0\\} &&{}={} \\begin{cases}\n               f(x), & \\text{if } f(x) > 0, \\\\\n               0, & \\text{otherwise,}\n             \\end{cases}\\\\\n & f^-(x) &&{}={} \\max \\{-f(x),0\\} &&{}={} \\begin{cases}\n               -f(x), & \\text{if } f(x) < 0, \\\\\n               0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n             \\end{cases}\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\n===Other integrals===\nAlthough the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including:\n* The [[Darboux integral]], which is constructed using Darboux sums and is equivalent to a [[Riemann integral]], meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable. Darboux integrals have the advantage of being simpler to define than Riemann integrals.\n* The [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]], an extension of the Riemann integral.\n* The [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]], further developed by [[Johann Radon]], which generalizes the [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral|Riemann–Stieltjes]] and [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrals]].\n* The [[Daniell integral]], which subsumes the Lebesgue integral and [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]] without the dependence on [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s.\n* The [[Haar integral]], used for integration on locally compact topological groups, introduced by [[Alfréd Haar]] in 1933.\n* The [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]], variously defined by [[Arnaud Denjoy]], [[Oskar Perron]], and (most elegantly, as the gauge integral) [[Jaroslav Kurzweil]], and developed by [[Ralph Henstock]].\n* The [[Itô integral]] and [[Stratonovich integral]], which define integration with respect to [[semimartingale]]s such as [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]].\n<!--* The [[Darboux integral]], equivalent to the Riemann integral.-->\n<!--* The [[Haar integral]], which is the Lebesgue integral with [[Haar measure]].-->\n* The [[Young integral]], which is a kind of Riemann–Stieltjes integral with respect to certain functions of [[Bounded variation|unbounded variation]].\n* The [[rough path]] integral, which is defined for functions equipped with some additional \"rough path\" structure and generalizes stochastic integration against both [[semimartingale]]s and processes such as the [[fractional Brownian motion]].\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Linearity===\nThe collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} forms a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration\n:<math> f \\mapsto \\int_a^b f(x) \\; dx</math>\n<!--- redundant\nfor an integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}\n--->\nis a [[linear functional]] on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking [[linear combination]]s; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals,\n\n<!--- leftover from the past text; redundant\nFor example, in Riemann integration, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are [[real number|real-valued]] integrable functions on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} are real numbers, then the function {{math|''αf'' + ''βg''}} defined by {{math|(''αf'' + ''βg'')(''x'') {{=}} ''αf''(''x'') + ''βg''(''x'')}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is integrable, with\n--->\n:<math> \\int_a^b (\\alpha f + \\beta g)(x) \\, dx = \\alpha \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx + \\beta \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. \\,</math>\n\nSimilarly, the set of [[real number|real]]-valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given [[Measure (mathematics)|measure space]] {{mvar|E}} with measure {{mvar|μ}} is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral\n\n: <math> f\\mapsto \\int_E f \\, d\\mu </math>\n\nis a linear functional on this vector space, so that\n\n:<math> \\int_E (\\alpha f + \\beta g) \\, d\\mu = \\alpha \\int_E f \\, d\\mu + \\beta \\int_E g \\, d\\mu. </math>\n\nMore generally, consider the vector space of all [[measurable function]]s on a measure space {{math|(''E'',''μ'')}}, taking values in a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[complete metric space|complete]] [[topological vector space]] {{mvar|V}} over a locally compact [[Topological ring|topological field]] {{math|''K'', ''f'' : ''E'' → ''V''}}. Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function {{mvar|f}} an element of {{mvar|V}} or the symbol {{math|''∞''}},\n:<math> f\\mapsto\\int_E f \\,d\\mu, \\,</math>\nthat is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of {{mvar|V}} (i.e. \"finite\"). The most important special cases arise when {{mvar|K}} is {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}}, or a finite extension of the field {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} of [[p-adic number]]s, and {{mvar|V}} is a finite-dimensional vector space over {{mvar|K}}, and when {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''C'''}} and {{mvar|V}} is a complex [[Hilbert space]].\n\nLinearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of \"simple\" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of [[Daniell integral|Daniell]] for the case of real-valued functions on a set {{mvar|X}}, generalized by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See {{Harv|Hildebrandt|1953}} for an axiomatic characterisation of the integral.\n\n===Inequalities===\nA number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).\n\n* ''Upper and lower bounds.'' An integrable function {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, is necessarily [[bounded function|bounded]] on that interval. Thus there are [[real number]]s {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|M}} so that {{math|''m'' ≤ ''f'' (''x'') ≤ ''M''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Since the lower and upper sums of {{mvar|f}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} are therefore bounded by, respectively, {{math|''m''(''b'' − ''a'')}} and {{math|''M''(''b'' − ''a'')}}, it follows that\n:: <math> m(b - a) \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq M(b - a). </math>\n\n* ''Inequalities between functions.'' If {{math|''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then each of the upper and lower sums of {{mvar|f}} is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of {{mvar|g}}. Thus\n:: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. </math>\n:This is a generalization of the above inequalities, as {{math|''M''(''b'' − ''a'')}} is the integral of the constant function with value {{mvar|M}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n:In addition, if the inequality between functions is strict, then the inequality between integrals is also strict. That is, if {{math|''f''(''x'') < ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then\n:: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx < \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. </math>\n\n* ''Subintervals.'' If {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}} is a subinterval of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is non-negative for all {{mvar|x}}, then\n:: <math> \\int_c^d f(x) \\, dx \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx. </math>\n\n* ''Products and absolute values of functions.'' If {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two functions, then we may consider their [[pointwise product]]s and powers, and [[absolute value]]s:\n:: <math>\n (fg)(x)= f(x) g(x), \\; f^2 (x) = (f(x))^2, \\; |f| (x) = |f(x)|.\\,</math>\n:If {{mvar|f}} is Riemann-integrable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then the same is true for {{math|{{abs|''f''}}}}, and\n:: <math>\\left| \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\right| \\leq \\int_a^b | f(x) | \\, dx. </math>\n:Moreover, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are both Riemann-integrable then {{math|''fg''}} is also Riemann-integrable, and\n:: <math>\\left( \\int_a^b (fg)(x) \\, dx \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\int_a^b f(x)^2 \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_a^b g(x)^2 \\, dx \\right). </math>\n:This inequality, known as the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], plays a prominent role in [[Hilbert space]] theory, where the left hand side is interpreted as the [[Inner product space|inner product]] of two [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n\n* ''Hölder's inequality''. Suppose that {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are two real numbers, {{math|1 ≤ ''p'', ''q'' ≤ ∞}} with {{math|{{sfrac|1|''p''}} + {{sfrac|1|''q''}} {{=}} 1}}, and {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two Riemann-integrable functions. Then the functions {{math|{{abs|''f''}}<sup>''p''</sup>}} and {{math|{{abs|''g''}}<sup>''q''</sup>}} are also integrable and the following [[Hölder's inequality]] holds:\n::<math>\\left|\\int f(x)g(x)\\,dx\\right| \\leq\n\\left(\\int \\left|f(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p} \\left(\\int\\left|g(x)\\right|^q\\,dx\\right)^{1/q}.</math>\n:For {{mvar|p}} = {{mvar|q}} = 2, Hölder's inequality becomes the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\n\n* ''Minkowski inequality''. Suppose that {{math|''p'' ≥ 1}} is a real number and {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are Riemann-integrable functions. Then {{math|{{abs| ''f'' }}<sup>''p''</sup>, {{abs| ''g'' }}<sup>''p''</sup>}} and {{math|{{abs| ''f'' + ''g'' }}<sup>''p''</sup>}} are also Riemann-integrable and the following [[Minkowski inequality]] holds:\n::<math>\\left(\\int \\left|f(x)+g(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p} \\leq\n\\left(\\int \\left|f(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p} +\n\\left(\\int \\left|g(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p}.</math>\n: An analogue of this inequality for Lebesgue integral is used in construction of [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup> spaces]].\n\n===Conventions===\nIn this section, {{mvar|f}} is a [[real number|real-]]valued Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The integral\n:<math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math>\nover an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is defined if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}. This means that the upper and lower sums of the function {{mvar|f}} are evaluated on a partition {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''x''<sub>0</sub> ≤ ''x''<sub>1</sub> ≤ . . . ≤ ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} ''b''}} whose values {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place \"left to right\", evaluating {{mvar|f}} within intervals {{math|[''x''<sub> ''i''</sub> , ''x''<sub> ''i'' +1</sub>]}} where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, the end-points of the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], are called the [[limits of integration]] of {{mvar|f}}. Integrals can also be defined if {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}}:\n\n* ''Reversing limits of integration.'' If {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}} then define\n:: <math>\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = - \\int_b^a f(x) \\, dx. </math>\nThis, with {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}}, implies:\n* ''Integrals over intervals of length zero.'' If {{mvar|a}} is a [[real number]] then\n:: <math>\\int_a^a f(x) \\, dx = 0. </math>\n\nThe first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a [[Point (geometry)|point]], should be [[0 (number)|zero]]. One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of {{mvar|f}} on an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} implies that {{mvar|f}} is integrable on any subinterval {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}}, but in particular integrals have the property that:\n\n* ''Additivity of integration on intervals.'' If {{mvar|c}} is any [[element (mathematics)|element]] of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then\n:: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx + \\int_c^b f(x) \\, dx.</math>\nWith the first convention, the resulting relation\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n \\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx &{}= \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx - \\int_c^b f(x) \\, dx \\\\\n &{} = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx + \\int_b^c f(x) \\, dx\n\\end{align}</math>\nis then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}.\n\n==Fundamental theorem of calculus==\n{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\n\nThe ''fundamental theorem of calculus'' is the statement that [[derivative|differentiation]] and integration are inverse operations: if a [[continuous function]] is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved. An important consequence, sometimes called the ''second fundamental theorem of calculus'', allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated.\n\n===Statements of theorems===\n\n====Fundamental theorem of calculus====\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Let {{mvar|F}} be the function defined, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, by\n:<math>F(x) = \\int_a^x f(t)\\, dt.</math>\nThen, {{mvar|F}} is continuous on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, differentiable on the open interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, and\n\n:<math>F'(x) = f(x)</math>\n\nfor all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}.\n\n====Second fundamental theorem of calculus====\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] [{{math|''a'', ''b''}}] that admits an [[antiderivative]] {{mvar|F}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. That is, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|F}} are functions such that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}},\n\n:<math>f(x) = F'(x).</math>\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is integrable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\n===Calculating integrals===\nThe second fundamental theorem allows many integrals to be calculated explicitly. For example, to calculate the integral\n:<math>\\int_0^1x^{1/2}\\,dx,</math>\nof the square root function {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/2</sup>}} between 0 and 1, it is sufficient to find an antiderivative, that is, a function {{math|''F''(''x'')}} whose derivative equals {{math|''f''(''x'')}}:\n:<math>F'(x)=f(x).</math>\nOne such function is {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|2|3}}''x''<sup>3/2</sup>}}. Then the value of the integral in question is\n:<math>\\int_0^1x^{1/2}\\,dx = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3} (0)^{3/2}=\\frac{2}{3}.</math>\n\nThis is a case of a general rule, that for {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>''q''</sup>}}, with {{math|''q'' ≠ −1}}, the related function, the so-called antiderivative is {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>''q'' + 1</sup>/(''q'' + 1).}} Tables of this and similar antiderivatives can be used to calculate integrals explicitly, in much the same way that tables of derivatives can be used.\n\n==Extensions==\n\n===Improper integrals===\n{{Main|Improper integral}}\n[[File:Improper integral.svg|right|thumb|The [[improper integral]]<br/><math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{(x+1)\\sqrt{x}} = \\pi</math><br/> has unbounded intervals for both domain and range.]]\nA \"proper\" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of proper [[Riemann integral]]s on progressively larger intervals.\n\nIf the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity.\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx</math>\nIf the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance {{math|<nowiki>(</nowiki>''a'', ''b''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}, then again a limit may provide a finite result.\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_{a+\\epsilon}^{b} f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nThat is, the improper integral is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified [[real number]], or {{math|∞}}, or {{math|−∞}}. In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points.\n\n===Multiple integration===\n{{Main|Multiple integral}}\n[[File:Volume under surface.png|right|thumb|Double integral as volume under a surface]]\nJust as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the [[area]] of the region between the graph of the function and the ''x''-axis, the ''double integral'' of a positive function of two variables represents the [[volume]] of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane that contains its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]. For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables, ''x'' and ''y'', and the integral of a function ''f'' over the rectangle ''R'' given as the [[Cartesian product]] of two intervals <math>R=[a,b]\\times [c,d]</math> can be written\n\n:<math>\\int_R f(x,y)\\,dA</math>\n\nwhere the differential {{math|''dA''}} indicates that integration is taken with respect to area. This [[double integral]] can be defined using [[Riemann sum]]s, and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'',''y'')}} over the domain ''R''. Under suitable conditions (e.g., if ''f'' is continuous), then [[Fubini's theorem]] guarantees that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b\\left[\\int_c^d f(x,y)\\,dy\\right]\\,dx.</math>\n\nThis reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because of this, another notation for the integral over ''R'' uses a double integral sign:\n:<math>\\iint_R f(x,y) dA.</math>\n\nIntegration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function ''f'', with respect to volume, over a subset ''D'' of ℝ<sup>n</sup> is denoted by notation such as\n\n:<math>\\int_D f(\\mathbf x)d^n\\mathbf x,\\quad \\int_D f\\,dV</math>\n\nor similar. See [[volume integral]].\n\n===Line integrals===\n{{Main|Line integral}}\n[[File:Line-Integral.gif|right|thumb|A line integral sums together elements along a curve.]]\nThe concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with [[vector field]]s.\n\nA ''line integral'' (sometimes called a ''path integral'') is an integral where the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be integrated is evaluated along a [[curve]]. Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a ''contour integral''.\n\nThe function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly [[arc length]] or, for a vector field, the [[Inner product space|scalar product]] of the vector field with a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s. Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that [[Mechanical work|work]] is equal to [[force]], {{math|'''F'''}}, multiplied by displacement, {{math|'''s'''}}, may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as:\n:<math>W=\\mathbf F\\cdot\\mathbf s.</math>\nFor an object moving along a path {{mvar|''C''}} in a [[vector field]] {{math|'''F'''}} such as an [[electric field]] or [[gravitational field]], the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from {{math|'''s'''}} to {{math|'''s''' + ''d'''''s'''}}. This gives the line integral\n:<math>W=\\int_C \\mathbf F\\cdot d\\mathbf s.</math>\n\n===Surface integrals===\n{{Main|Surface integral}}\n[[File:Surface integral illustration.svg|right|thumb|The definition of surface integral relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements.]]\nA ''surface integral'' is a definite integral taken over a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] (which may be a curved set in [[space]]); it can be thought of as the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] analog of the [[line integral]]. The function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.\n\nFor an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field {{math|'''v'''}} on a surface {{math|''S''}}; that is, for each point {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''S''}}, {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}}, such that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} determines the velocity of the fluid at {{mvar|x}}. The [[flux]] is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}} in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the [[dot product]] of {{math|'''v'''}} with the unit [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] to {{math|''S''}} at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface:\n:<math>\\int_S {\\mathbf v}\\cdot \\,d{\\mathbf {S}}.</math>\nThe fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the [[classical theory]] of [[electromagnetism]].\n\n===Contour integrals===\n{{Main|Contour integration}}\nIn [[complex analysis]], the integrand is a [[complex-valued function]] of a complex variable {{mvar|z}} instead of a real function of a real variable {{mvar|x}}. When a complex function is integrated along a curve <math>\\gamma</math> in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\gamma} f(z)\\,dz</math>.\n\nThis is known as a [[contour integral]].\n\n===Integrals of differential forms===\n{{Main|Differential form}}\nA [[differential form]] is a mathematical concept in the fields of [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential topology]], and [[tensor]]s. Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as:\n:<math>E(x,y,z)\\,dx + F(x,y,z)\\,dy + G(x,y,z)\\, dz</math>\nwhere ''E'', ''F'', ''G'' are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'' measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes.\n\nA differential two-form is a sum of the form\n:<math>G(x,y,z)dx\\wedge dy + E(x,y,z)dy\\wedge dz + F(x,y,z)dz\\wedge dx.</math>\nHere the basic two-forms <math>dx\\wedge dy, dz\\wedge dx, dy\\wedge dz</math> measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes. The symbol <math>\\wedge</math> denotes the [[wedge product]], which is similar to the [[cross product]] in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of <math>E\\mathbf i+F\\mathbf j+G\\mathbf k</math>.\n\nUnlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The [[exterior derivative]] plays the role of the [[gradient]] and [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of vector calculus, and [[Stokes' theorem]] simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and the [[Kelvin-Stokes theorem]].\n\n===Summations===\n{{Main|Summation#Approximation by definite integrals}}\nThe discrete equivalent of integration is [[summation]]. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of [[Lebesgue integral]]s or [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==Computation==\n\n===Analytical===\nThe most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. Let {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be the function of {{mvar|x}} to be integrated over a given interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Then, find an antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}; that is, a function {{mvar|F}} such that {{math|''F''′ {{=}} ''f''}} on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx=F(b)-F(a).</math>\n\nThe integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals.\n\nThe most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}. It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include:\n* [[Integration by substitution]]\n* [[Integration by parts]]\n* [[Inverse function integration]]\n* [[Order of integration (calculus)|Changing the order of integration]]\n* [[trigonometric substitution|Integration by trigonometric substitution]]\n* [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]\n* [[Partial fractions in integration|Integration by partial fractions]]\n* [[Integration by reduction formulae]]\n* [[Integration using parametric derivatives]]\n* [[Integration using Euler's formula]]\n* [[Euler substitution]]\n* [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]\n* [[Methods of contour integration|Contour integration]]\nAlternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many [[nonelementary integral]]s can be expanded in a [[Taylor series]] and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using [[Meijer G-function]]s can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, [[Parseval's identity]] can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see [[Gaussian integral]].\n\nComputations of volumes of [[solid of revolution|solids of revolution]] can usually be done with [[disk integration]] or [[shell integration]].\n\nSpecific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the [[Lists of integrals|list of integrals]].\n\n===Symbolic===\n{{Main|Symbolic integration}}\n\nMany problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive [[Lists of integrals|tables of integrals]] have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to [[computer algebra system]]s that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like [[Macsyma]].\n\nA major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions {{math|exp(''x''<sup>2</sup>), ''x''<sup>''x''</sup>}} and {{math|(sin ''x'')/''x''}} cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only [[rational function|rational]] and [[exponential function|exponential]] functions, [[logarithm]], [[trigonometric functions]] and [[inverse trigonometric functions]], and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in [[elementary function]]s, which are the functions which may be built from rational functions, [[Root of a function|roots of a polynomial]], logarithm, and exponential functions. The [[Risch algorithm]] provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The [[Risch algorithm]], implemented in [[Mathematica]] and other [[computer algebra system]]s, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions, [[Nth root|radicals]], logarithm, and exponential functions.\n\nSome special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the [[special functions]] (like the [[Legendre function]]s, the [[hypergeometric function]], the [[gamma function]], the [[incomplete gamma function]] and so on&nbsp;— see [[Symbolic integration]] for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.\n\nMore recently a new approach has emerged, using [[D-finite function|''D''-finite functions]], which are the solutions of [[linear differential equation]]s with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are ''D''-finite, and the integral of a ''D''-finite function is also a ''D''-finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a ''D''-finite function as the solution of a differential equation.\n\nThis theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a ''D''-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.<ref>[http://algo.inria.fr/chyzak/mgfun.html Frédéric Chyzak's Mgfun Project: Introduction to the Package Mgfun and Related Packages]</ref>\n\n===Numerical===\n{{Main|Numerical integration}}\n\nSome integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives. Others are not so accommodating. Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called ''numerical integration'' or ''numerical quadrature'', arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures ({{Harvnb|Dahlquist|Björck|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Kahaner|Moler|Nash|1989}}; {{Harvnb|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002}}).\n\nConsider, for example, the integral\n:<math> \\int_{-2}^{2} \\tfrac{1}{5} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{100}(322 + 3 x (98 + x (37 + x))) - 24 \\frac{x}{1+x^2} \\right) dx </math>\nwhich has the exact answer {{nowrap|94/25 {{=}} 3.76}}. (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task&nbsp;— not explored here&nbsp;— is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.\n:{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:white\"\n|+ Spaced function values\n|-\n!

The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2<sup>18</sup> pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.\n\nA better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The [[trapezoid rule]] is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2<sup>10</sup> pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. [[Simpson's rule]] approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called [[Newton–Cotes formulas]]. The degree {{math|''n''}} Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree {{math|''n''}} polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to [[Runge's phenomenon]]. One solution to this problem is [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]], in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of [[Chebyshev polynomials]]. This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function.\n\n[[Romberg's method]] builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by {{math|''T''(''h''<sub>0</sub>), ''T''(''h''<sub>1</sub>)}}, and so on, where {{math|''h''<sub>''k''+1</sub>}} is half of {{math|''h''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to [[Interpolation|interpolate]] a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to {{math|''T''(0)}}. With this method a numerically ''exact'' answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The [[Lagrange polynomial]] interpolating {{math|{''h''<sub>''k''</sub>,''T''(''h''<sub>''k''</sub>)}<sub>''k'' {{=}} 0...2</sub> {{=}}}} {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148{{math|''h''<sup>2</sup>}}, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\n[[Gaussian quadrature]] often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two {{mvar|x}} positions, {{math|±2 ⁄ {{sqrt|3}}}}, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton–Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of [[orthogonal polynomials]]. An {{mvar|n}}-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to {{math|2''n'' − 1}}. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)\n\nIn practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular [[Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula]]e. More broadly, [[adaptive quadrature]] partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most.\n\nThe computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as [[Monte Carlo integration]].\n\nA calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage. For example, the integral <math>\\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} e^{-x}\\,dx</math> is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}. However, the substitution {{math|1=''u'' = {{radic|''x''}}}} transforms the integral into <math>2\\int_0^1 e^{-u^2}\\,du</math>, which has no singularities at all.\n\n===Mechanical===\nThe area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called [[planimeter]].

      "text": "{{about|mostly indefinite integrals in calculus|a list of definite integrals|List of definite integrals}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2013}}\n{{Calculus |Integral}}\n\n[[Integral|Integration]] is the basic operation in [[integral calculus]].  While [[derivative|differentiation]] has [[Differentiation rules|easy rules]] by which the derivative of a complicated [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions, integration does not, so tables of known integrals are often useful. This page lists some of the most common [[antiderivative]]s.\n\n==Historical development of integrals==\nA compilation of a list of integrals (Integraltafeln) and techniques of integral calculus was published by the German mathematician {{Interlanguage link multi|Meier Hirsch|de}} (aka {{Interlanguage link multi|Meyer Hirsch|de}}) in 1810. These tables were republished in the United Kingdom in 1823. More extensive tables were compiled in 1858 by the Dutch mathematician [[David Bierens de Haan]] for his ''[[Tables d'intégrales définies]]'', supplemented by ''[[Supplément aux tables d'intégrales définies]]'' in ca. 1864<!-- no visible date indication by itself. Google books entry states 1864, foreword states 1861, English WP article formely stated 1862 -->. A new edition was published in 1867 under the title ''[[Nouvelles tables d'intégrales définies]]''. These tables, which contain mainly integrals of elementary functions, remained in use until the middle of the 20th century. They were then replaced by the much more extensive tables of [[Gradshteyn and Ryzhik]]. In Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, integrals originating from the book by Bierens de Haan are denoted by BI.\n\nNot all [[closed-form expression]]s have closed-form antiderivatives; this study forms the subject of [[differential Galois theory]], which was initially developed by [[Joseph Liouville]] in the 1830s and 1840s, leading to [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]] which classifies which expressions have closed form antiderivatives. A simple example of a function without a closed form antiderivative is {{math|''e''<sup>−''x''<sup>2</sup></sup>}}, whose antiderivative is (up to constants) the [[error function]].\n\nSince 1968 there is the [[Risch algorithm]] for determining indefinite integrals that can be expressed in term of [[elementary function]]s, typically using a [[computer algebra system]]. Integrals that cannot be expressed using elementary functions can be manipulated symbolically using general functions such as the [[Meijer G-function]].\n\n==Lists of integrals==\nMore detail may be found on the following pages for the '''lists of [[integral]]s''':\n\n* [[List of integrals of rational functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of irrational functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of trigonometric functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of inverse trigonometric functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of hyperbolic functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of inverse hyperbolic functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of exponential functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of logarithmic functions]]\n* [[List of integrals of Gaussian functions]]\n\n{{anchor|Prudnikov-Brychkov-Marichev}}[[Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn|Gradshteyn]], [[Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik|Ryzhik]], [[Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus|Geronimus]], [[Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin|Tseytlin]], Jeffrey, Zwillinger, Moll's (GR) ''[[Table of Integrals, Series, and Products]]'' contains a large collection of results. An even larger, multivolume table is the ''Integrals and Series'' by [[Anatoli Prudnikov|Prudnikov]], Brychkov, and [[Oleg Igorevich Marichev|Marichev]] (with volumes 1–3 listing integrals and series of [[elementary function|elementary]] and [[special functions]], volume 4–5 are tables of [[Laplace transform]]s). More compact collections can be found in e.g. Brychkov, Marichev, Prudnikov's ''Tables of Indefinite Integrals'', or as chapters in Zwillinger's ''CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae'' or [[Bronshtein and Semendyayev]]'s ''[[A Guide Book to Mathematics|Guide Book to Mathematics]]'', ''[[Handbook of Mathematics]]'' or ''[[Oxford Users' Guide to Mathematics|Users' Guide to Mathematics]]'', and other mathematical handbooks.\n\nOther useful resources include [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] and the [[Bateman Manuscript Project]]. Both works contain many identities concerning specific integrals, which are organized with the most relevant topic instead of being collected into a separate table. Two volumes of the Bateman Manuscript are specific to integral transforms.\n\nThere are several web sites which have tables of integrals and integrals on demand. [[Wolfram Alpha]] can show results, and for some simpler expressions, also the intermediate steps of the integration. [[Wolfram Research]] also operates another online service, the [http://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/ Wolfram Mathematica Online Integrator].\n\n==Integrals of simple functions==\n''C'' is used for an [[arbitrary constant of integration]] that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus, each function has an infinite number of [[Antiderivative|antiderivatives]].\n\nThese formulas only state in another form the assertions in the [[table of derivatives]].\n\n===Integrals with a singularity===\nWhen there is a [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularity]] in the function being integrated such that the antiderivative becomes undefined or at some point (the singularity), then ''C'' does not need to be the same on both sides of the singularity. The forms below normally assume the [[Cauchy principal value]] around a singularity in the value of ''C'' but this is not in general necessary. For instance in\n\n:<math>\\int {1 \\over x}\\,dx = \\ln \\left|x \\right| + C</math>\n\nthere is a singularity at 0 and the [[antiderivative]] becomes infinite there. If the integral above were to be used to compute a definite integral between −1 and 1, one would get the wrong answer 0. This however is the Cauchy principal value of the integral around the singularity. If the integration is done in the complex plane the result depends on the path around the origin, in this case the singularity contributes −''i''{{pi}} when using a path above the origin and ''i''{{pi}} for a path below the origin.

In [[Lebesgue integration]], this is exactly the requirement for ''f'' itself to be considered integrable (with the integral then equaling <math>\\int f^+(x)dx-\\int f^-(x)dx</math>), so that in fact \"absolutely integrable\" means the same thing as \"Lebesgue integrable\".\n\nThe same thing goes for a complex-valued function. Let us define\n:<math>f^+(x)=\\max(\\Re f(x),0)</math>\n:<math>f^-(x)=\\max(-\\Re f(x),0)</math>\n:<math>f^{+i}(x)=\\max(\\Im f(x),0)</math>\n:<math>f^{-i}(x)=\\max(-\\Im f(x),0)</math>\nwhere <math>\\Re f(x)</math> and <math>\\Im f(x)</math> are the real and imaginary parts of <math>f(x)</math>.

So having a finite integral of the absolute value is equivalent to the conditions for the function to be \"Lebesgue integrable\".\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Absolutely_integrable_function|title=Absolutely integrable function – Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=9 October 2015}}\n\n[[Category:Integrals]]"

Therefore, this map defines, as it is obviously linear, a continuous functional on the [[Schwartz space]] and therefore a [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]].\n\nNote that the proof needs <math> u</math> merely to be continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of <math> 0</math> and <math> xu</math> to be bounded towards infinity.

If <math> K </math> has an isolated singularity at the origin, but is an otherwise \"nice\" function, then the principal-value distribution is defined on compactly supported smooth functions by\n:<math> [\\operatorname{p.\\!v.} (K)](f) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus B_{\\varepsilon(0)}} f(x) K(x) \\, \\mathrm{d} x. </math>\nSuch a limit may not be well defined, or, being well-defined, it may not necessarily define a distribution. It is, however, well-defined if <math> K </math> is a continuous [[homogeneous function]] of degree <math> -n </math> whose integral over any sphere centered at the origin vanishes. This is the case, for instance, with the [[Riesz transform]]s.\n\n==Examples==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nConsider the difference in values of two limits:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{a\\rightarrow 0+}\\left(\\int_{-1}^{-a}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x} + \\int_a^1\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x}\\right)=0,</math>\n\n:<math>\\lim_{a\\rightarrow 0+}\\left(\\int_{-1}^{-2 a}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x}+\\int_{a}^1\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x}\\right)=\\ln 2.</math>\n\nThe former is the Cauchy principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x}, \\text{ (which gives } {-\\infty}+\\infty \\text{)}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, we have\n\n:<math>\\lim_{a\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_{-a}^a\\frac{2x\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+1}=0,</math>\n\nbut\n\n:<math>\\lim_{a\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_{-2a}^a\\frac{2x\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+1}=-\\ln 4.</math>\n\nThe former is the principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{2x\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+1} \\text{ (which gives } {-\\infty}+\\infty \\text{)}.</math>\n\n==Notation==\n\nDifferent authors use different notations for the Cauchy principal value of a function <math>f</math>, among others:\n\n: <math>PV \\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x,</math>\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{p.v.} \\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x,</math>\n\n: <math>\\int_L^*  f(z)\\, \\mathrm{d}z,</math>\n\n: <math> -\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x,</math>\n\n: as well as <math>P,</math> P.V., <math>\\mathcal{P},</math> <math>P_v,</math> <math>(CPV),</math> and&nbsp;V.P.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Hadamard finite part integral]]\n*[[Hilbert transform]]\n*[[Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Mathematical analysis]]\n[[Category:Generalized functions]]\n[[Category:Integrals]]\n[[Category:Summability methods]]"

This is the [[definite integral]] form; the [[indefinite integral]] form is:\n\n:<math>\\int x^n\\,dx = \\tfrac{1}{n+1}\\, x^{n+1} + C \\qquad n \\neq -1.</math>\n\nThere are additional [[#Forms|forms]], listed below. Together with the [[linearity]] of the integral, this formula allows one to compute the integrals of all polynomials.\n\nThe term \"[[Numerical integration|quadrature]]\" is a traditional term for [[area]]; the integral is geometrically interpreted as the area under the curve ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>''n''</sup>. Traditionally important cases are ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>, the quadrature of the [[parabola]], known in antiquity, and ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/''x'', the quadrature of the hyperbola, whose value is a [[logarithm]].\n\n== Forms ==\n=== Negative ''n'' ===\nFor negative values of ''n'' (negative powers of ''x''), there is a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] at ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and thus the definite integral is based at 1, rather than 0, yielding:\n\n:<math>\\int_1^a x^n\\,dx = \\frac{1}{n+1} (a^{n+1} - 1) \\qquad n \\neq -1.</math>\n\nFurther, for negative fractional (non-integer) values of ''n,'' the power ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> is not [[well-defined]], hence the indefinite integral is only defined for positive ''x.'' However, for ''n'' a negative integer the power ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> is defined for all non-zero ''x,'' and the indefinite integrals and definite integrals are defined, and can be computed via a symmetry argument, replacing ''x'' by &minus;''x,'' and basing the negative definite integral at&nbsp;&minus;1.\n\nOver the complex numbers the definite integral (for negative values of ''n'' and ''x'') can be defined via [[contour integration]], but then depends on choice of path, specifically [[winding number]] – the geometric issue is that the function defines a [[covering space]] with a singularity at&nbsp;0.\n\n=== ''n'' = &minus;1 ===\nThere is also the exceptional case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1, yielding a [[logarithm]] instead of a power of&nbsp;''x:''\n\n:<math>\\int_1^a \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx = \\ln a,</math>\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx = \\ln x + C, \\qquad x > 0</math>\n\n(where \"ln\" means the [[natural logarithm]], i.e. the logarithm to the base ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.71828...).\n\nThe improper integral is often extended to negative values of ''x'' via the conventional choice:\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx = \\ln |x| + C, \\qquad x \\neq 0.</math>\n\nNote the use of the [[absolute value]] in the indefinite integral; this is to provide a unified form for the integral, and means that the integral of this odd function is an even function, though the logarithm is only defined for positive inputs, and in fact, different constant values of ''C'' can be chosen on either side of 0, since these do not change the derivative. The more general form is thus:<ref>\"[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/03/reader_survey_logx_c.html Reader Survey: log|''x''| + ''C'']\", Tom Leinster, ''The ''n''-category Café'', March 19, 2012</ref>\n:<math>\\int\\frac{1}{x} \\, dx= \\begin{cases}\n\\ln |x| + C^- & x < 0 \\\\\n\\ln |x| + C^+ & x > 0\n\\end{cases}</math>\nOver the complex numbers there is not a global antiderivative for 1/''x'', due this function defining a non-trivial [[covering space]]; this form is special to the real numbers.\n\nNote that the definite integral starting from 1 is not defined for negative values of ''a,'' since it passes through a singularity, though since 1/''x'' is an [[odd function]], one can base the definite integral for negative powers at&nbsp;&minus;1. If one is willing to use [[improper integral]]s and compute the [[Cauchy principal value]], one obtains <math>\\int_{-c}^c \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx = 0,</math> which can also be argued by symmetry (since the logarithm is odd), so <math>\\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx = 0,</math> so it makes no difference if the definite integral is based at 1 or&nbsp;&minus;1. As with the indefinite integral, this is special to the real numbers, and does not extend over the complex numbers.\n\n=== Alternative forms ===\nThe integral can also be written with indexes shifted, which simplify the result and make the relation to ''n''-dimensional differentiation and the ''n''-cube clearer:\n:<math>\\int_0^a x^{n-1}\\,dx = \\tfrac{1}{n} a^n \\qquad n \\geq 1.</math>\n:<math>\\int x^{n-1}\\,dx = \\tfrac{1}{n} x^n + C \\qquad n \\neq 0.</math>\n\nMore generally, these formulae may be given as:\n:<math>\\int (ax + b)^n dx= \\frac{(ax + b)^{n+1}}{a(n + 1)} + C \\qquad\\mbox{(for } n\\neq -1\\mbox{)}\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>\\int\\frac{1}{ax + b} dx= \\frac{1}{a}\\ln\\left|ax + b\\right| + C</math>\n:More generally:\n::<math>\\int\\frac{1}{ax + b} \\, dx= \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{a}\\ln\\left|ax + b\\right| + C^- & x < -b/a \\\\\n\\frac{1}{a}\\ln\\left|ax + b\\right| + C^+ & x > -b/a\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n== Proof ==\nThe modern proof is to use an antiderivative: the derivative of ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> is shown to be ''nx''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> – for non-negative integers. This is shown from the [[binomial formula]] and the [[definition of the derivative]] – and thus by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] the [[antiderivative]] is the integral. This method fails for <math>\\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx,</math> as the [[candidate solution|candidate]] antiderivative is <math>\\frac{1}{0} \\cdot x^0</math>, which is undefined due to division by zero. The [[logarithm]] function, which is the actual antiderivative of 1/''x'', must be introduced and examined separately.\n\n[[Image:BinomialTheorem.png|right|315px|thumb|The derivative <math>(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}</math> can be geometrized as the infinitesimal change in volume of the ''n''-cube, which is the area of ''n'' faces, each of dimension ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.<br />\nIntegrating this picture – stacking the faces – geometrizes the fundamental theorem of calculus, yielding a decomposition of the ''n''-cube into ''n'' pyramids, which is a geometric proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula.]]\nFor positive integers, this proof can be geometrized:<ref>{{Harv|Barth|2004}}, {{Harv|Carter|Champanerkar|2006}}</ref> if one considers the quantity ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> as the volume of the ''n''-cube (the [[hypercube]] in ''n'' dimensions), then the derivative is the change in the volume as the side length is changed – this is ''x''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>, which can be interpreted as the area of ''n'' faces, each of dimension ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 (fixing one vertex at the origin, these are the ''n'' faces not touching the vertex), corresponding to the cube increasing in size by growing in the direction of these faces – in the 3-dimensional case, adding 3 infinitesimally thin squares, one to each of these faces. Conversely, geometrizing the fundamental theorem of calculus, stacking up these infinitesimal (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) cubes yields a (hyper)-pyramid, and ''n'' of these pyramids form the ''n''-cube, which yields the formula. Further, there is an ''n''-fold cyclic symmetry of the ''n''-cube around the diagonal cycling these pyramids (for which a pyramid is a [[fundamental domain]]). In the case of the cube (3-cube), this is how the volume of a pyramid was originally rigorously established: the cube has 3-fold symmetry, with fundamental domain a pyramids, dividing the cube into 3 pyramids, corresponding to the fact that the volume of a pyramid is one third of the base times the height. This illustrates geometrically the equivalence between the quadrature of the parabola and the volume of a pyramid, which were computed classically by different means.\n\nAlternative proofs exist – for example, [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] computed the area via an algebraic trick of dividing the domain into certain intervals of unequal length;<ref>See Rickey.</ref> alternatively, one can prove this by recognizing a symmetry of the graph ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>''n''</sup> under inhomogeneous dilation (by ''d'' in the ''x'' direction and ''d''<sup>''n''</sup> in the ''y'' direction, algebraicizing the ''n'' dimensions of the ''y'' direction),<ref>{{Harv|Wildberger|2002}}</ref> or deriving the formula for all integer values by expanding the result for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1 and comparing coefficients.<ref>{{Harv|Bradley|2003}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Parabolic Segment.svg|thumb|Archimedes computed the area of parabolic segments in his ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.]]\nA detailed discussion of the history, with original sources, is given in {{Harv|Laubenbacher|Pengelley|1998|loc=Chapter 3, Analysis: Calculating Areas and Volumes}}; see also [[history of calculus]] and [[Integral#History|history of integration]].\n\nThe case of the parabola was proven in antiquity by the ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]] in his ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' (3rd century BC), via the [[method of exhaustion]]. Of note is that Archimedes computed the area ''inside'' a parabola – a so-called \"parabolic segment\" – rather than the area under the graph ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>, which is instead the perspective of [[Cartesian geometry]]. These are equivalent computations, but reflect a difference in perspective. The Ancient Greeks, among others, also computed the volume of a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] or [[cone (geometry)|cone]], which is mathematically equivalent.\n\nIn the 11th century, the [[Islamic mathematics|Islamic mathematician]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known as ''Alhazen'' in Europe) computed the integrals of [[cubic polynomial|cubics]] and [[quartic polynomial|quartics]] (degree three and four) via [[mathematical induction]], in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.<ref name=Katz>Victor J. Katz (1995), \"Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India\", ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3): 163–174 [165–9 & 173–4]</ref>\n\nThe case of higher integers was computed by Cavalieri for ''n'' up to 9, using his method of indivisibles ([[Cavalieri's principle]]).<ref>{{Harv|Struik|1986|loc=pp. 215–216}}</ref> He interpreted these as higher integrals as computing higher-dimensional volumes, though only informally, as higher-dimensional objects were as yet unfamiliar.<ref>{{Harv|Laubenbacher|Pengelley|1998}} – see [http://www.math.nmsu.edu/~history/book/analysissynopsis.html Informal pedagogical synopsis of the Analysis chapter] for brief form</ref> This method of quadrature was then extended by Italian mathematician [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to other curves such as the [[cycloid]], then the formula was generalized to fractional and negative powers by English mathematician [[John Wallis]], in his ''[[Arithmetica Infinitorum]]'' (1656), which also standardized the notion and notation of rational powers – though Wallis incorrectly interpreted the exceptional case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1 (quadrature of the hyperbola) – before finally being put on rigorous ground with the development of [[integral calculus]].\n\nPrior to Wallis's formalization of fractional and negative powers, which allowed ''explicit'' functions <math>y=x^{p/q},</math> these curves were handled ''implicitly,'' via the equations <math>x^p=ky^q</math> and <math>x^py^q=k</math> (''p'' and ''q'' always positive integers) and referred to respectively as '''higher parabolae''' and '''higher hyperbolae''' (or \"higher parabolas\" and \"higher hyperbolas\"). [[Pierre de Fermat]] also computed these areas (except for the exceptional case of &minus;1) by an algebraic trick – he computed the quadrature of the higher hyperbolae via dividing the line into equal intervals, and then computed the quadrature of the higher parabolae by using a division into ''unequal'' intervals, presumably by inverting the divisions he used for hyperbolae.<ref>See Rickey reference for discussion and further references.</ref> However, as in the rest of his work, Fermat's techniques were more ad hoc tricks than systematic treatments, and he is not considered to have played a significant part in the subsequent development of calculus.\n\nOf note is that Cavalieri only compared areas to areas and volumes to volumes – these always having ''dimensions,'' while the notion of considering an area as consisting of ''units'' of area (relative to a standard unit), hence being unitless, appears to have originated with Wallis;<ref>Ball, 281</ref><ref>Britannica, 171</ref> Wallis studied fractional and negative powers, and the alternative to treating the computed values as unitless numbers was to interpret fractional and negative dimensions.\n\nThe exceptional case of &minus;1 (the standard hyperbola) was first successfully treated by [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] in his ''Opus geometricum quadrature circuli et sectionum coni'' (1647), though a formal treatment had to wait for the development of the [[natural logarithm]], which was accomplished by [[Nicholas Mercator]] in his ''Logarithmotechnia'' (1668).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== History ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Cavalieri, ''Geometria indivisibilibus (continuorum nova quadam ratione promota)'' (Geometry, exposed in a new manner with the aid of indivisibles of the continuous), 1635.\n* Cavalieri, ''Exercitationes Geometricae Sex'' (\"Six Geometrical Exercises\"), 1647\n** in [[Dirk Jan Struik]], editor, ''A source book in mathematics, 1200–1800'' (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1986). {{ISBN|0-691-08404-1}}, {{ISBN|0-691-02397-2}} (pbk).\n* ''Mathematical expeditions: chronicles by the explorers,'' Reinhard Laubenbacher, David Pengelley, 1998, Section 3.4: \"Cavalieri Calculates Areas of Higher Parabolas\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=ubFg7DI83JoC&pg=PA125 pp. 123–127/128]\n* ''A short account of the history of mathematics,'' Walter William Rouse Ball, \"Cavalieri\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=_sT_psl3uYkC&pg=PA278 p. 278–281]\n* \"[http://eom.springer.de/i/i050950.htm Infinitesimal calculus]\", ''Encyclopaedia of Mathematics''\n* ''The Britannica Guide to Analysis and Calculus,'' by Educational Britannica Educational, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ML5Uuo16D58C&pg=PA171 p. 171] – discusses Wallace primarily\n{{refend}}\n\n=== Proofs ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720101905/http://www.math.usma.edu/people/rickey/hm/CalcNotes/Fermat-Integration.pdf Fermat's Integration of Powers]\", in ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720102613/http://www.math.usma.edu/people/rickey/hm/CalcNotes/default.htm Historical Notes for Calculus Teachers]'' by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720102654/http://www.math.usma.edu/people/rickey/ V.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_integral",
      "text": "{{Short description|type of integral of functions of multiple variables}}\nIn [[calculus]] an '''iterated integral''' is the result of applying integrals to a function of more than one variable (for example <math>f(x,y)</math> or <math>f(x,y,z)</math>) in a way that each of the integrals considers some of the variables as given constants. For example, the function <math>f(x,y)</math>, if <math>y</math> is considered a given [[parameter]], can be integrated with respect to <math>x</math>, <math>\\int f(x,y)dx</math>. The result is a function of <math>y</math> and therefore its integral can be considered. If this is done, the result is the iterated integral \n\n:<math>\\int\\left(\\int f(x,y)\\,dx\\right)\\,dy.</math>\nIt is key for the notion of iterated integral that this is different, in principle, from the [[multiple integral]]\n:<math>\\iint f(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy.</math>\n\nAlthough in general these two can be different, there is a theorem that, under very mild conditions, gives the equality of the two. This is [[Fubini's theorem]].\n\nThe alternative notation for iterated integrals\n:<math>\\int dy \\int dx \\, f(x,y)</math>\nis also used.\n\nIn the notation that uses parentheses, iterated integrals are computed following the operational order indicated by the parentheses starting from the most inner integral outside. In the alternative notation, writing <math display=\"inline\">\\int dy \\, \\int dx \\, f(x, y)</math>, the nestedmost integrand is computed first.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===A simple computation===\n\nFor the iterated integral\n\n:<math>\\int\\left(\\int (x+y) \\, dx\\right) \\, dy</math>\n\nthe integral\n\n:<math>\\int (x+y) \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + yx</math>\n\nis computed first and then the result is used to compute the integral with respect to&nbsp;''y''.\n\n:<math>\\int \\left(\\frac{x^2}{2} + yx\\right) \\, dy = \\frac{yx^2}{2} + \\frac{xy^2}{2} </math>\n\nIt should be noted, however, that this example omits the constants of integration.  After the first integration with respect to&nbsp;''x'', we would rigorously need to introduce a \"constant\" function of&nbsp;''y''.  That is, If we were to differentiate this function with respect to x, any terms containing only&nbsp;''y'' would vanish, leaving the original integrand.  Similarly for the second integral, we would introduce a \"constant\" function of&nbsp;''x'', because we have integrated with respect to&nbsp;''y''.  In this way, indefinite integration does not make very much sense for functions of several variables.\n\n===The order is important===\nThe order in which the integrals are computed is important in iterated integrals, particularly when the integrand is not continuous on the domain of integration. Examples in which the different orders lead to different results are usually for complicated functions as the one that follows.\n\nLet a sequence <math>0<a_1<a_2<\\cdots</math>, such that <math>a_n\\rightarrow1</math>. Let <math>g_n</math> be a continuous functions not vanishing in the interval <math>(a_n,a_{n+1})</math> and zero elsewhere, such that <math>\\int_{0}^{1}g_n=1</math> for every <math>n</math>. Define\n:<math>f(x,y)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (g_n(x)-g_{n+1}(x))g_n(y).</math>\nIn the previous sum, at each specific <math>(x,y)</math>, at most one term is different from zero.\nFor this function it happens that\n:<math>\\int_0^1 \\left(\\int_0^1 f(x,y) \\,dy\\right)\\,dx = 1\\neq0 = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\int_0^1 f(x,y)\\, dx\\right)\\,dy</math><ref>Rudin, W., ''Real and complex analysis'', 1970</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Integrals]]"

      "title": "Path integral formulation",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation",
      "text": "{{about|a formulation of quantum mechanics|integrals along a path, also known as line or contour integrals|line integral}}\n{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Formulations}}\nThe '''path integral formulation''' of [[quantum mechanics]] is a description of quantum theory that generalizes the [[action (physics)|action principle]] of [[classical mechanics]].  It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or [[functional integral]], over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a [[probability amplitude|quantum amplitude]].\n\nThis formulation has proven crucial to the subsequent development of [[theoretical physics]], because manifest [[Lorentz covariance]] (time and space components of quantities enter equations in the same way) is easier to achieve than in the operator formalism of [[canonical quantization]]. Unlike previous methods, the path integral allows one to easily change [[coordinates]] between very different [[canonical coordinates|canonical]] descriptions of the same quantum system. Another advantage is that it is in practice easier to guess the correct form of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a theory, which naturally enters the path integrals (for interactions of a certain type, these are ''coordinate space'' or ''Feynman path integrals''), than the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. Possible downsides of the approach include that [[unitarity]] (this is related to conservation of probability; the probabilities of all physically possible outcomes must add up to one) of the [[S-matrix]] is obscure in the formulation. The path-integral approach has been proved to be equivalent to the other formalisms of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Thus, by ''deriving'' either approach from the other, problems associated with one or the other approach (as exemplified by Lorentz covariance or unitarity) go away.<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|loc=Chapter 9.}}</ref>\n\nThe path integral also relates quantum and [[stochastic]] processes, and this provided the basis for the grand synthesis of the 1970s, which unified [[quantum field theory]] with the [[statistical mechanics|statistical field theory]] of a fluctuating field near a [[second-order phase transition]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] is a [[diffusion equation]] with an imaginary diffusion constant, and the path integral is an [[analytic continuation]] of a method for summing up all possible [[random walk]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Vinokur|2015}}<br>PDF:[https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/ITS/Vinokur_Spring2015.pdf Dynamic Vortex Mott Transition]</ref>\n\nThe basic idea of the path integral formulation can be traced back to [[Norbert Wiener]], who introduced the [[Wiener integral]] for solving problems in diffusion and [[Brownian motion]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chaichian|Demichev|2001}}</ref> This idea was extended to the use of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] in quantum mechanics by [[P. A. M. Dirac]] in his 1933 article.<ref>{{harvnb|Dirac|1933}}<br>PDF:[http://www.hep.anl.gov/czachos/soysoy/Dirac33.pdf The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics]</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Van Vleck|1928}}</ref> The complete method was developed in 1948 by [[Richard Feynman]]. Some preliminaries were worked out earlier in his doctoral work under the supervision of [[John Archibald Wheeler]]. The original motivation stemmed from the desire to obtain a quantum-mechanical formulation for the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] using a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] (rather than a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]) as a starting point.\n\n[[File:Three paths from A to B.png|thumbnail|250px|These are just three of the paths that contribute to the quantum amplitude for a particle moving from point A at some time {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}} to point B at some other time {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}.]]\n\n== Quantum action principle ==\n\nIn quantum mechanics, as in classical mechanics, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is the generator of time translations. This means that the state at a slightly later time differs from the state at the current time by the result of acting with the Hamiltonian operator (multiplied by the negative [[imaginary unit]], {{math|−''i''}}). For states with a definite energy, this is a statement of the [[de Broglie relation]] between frequency and energy, and the general relation is consistent with that plus the [[superposition principle]].\n\nThe Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is derived from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], which is a more fundamental quantity relative to [[special relativity]]. The Hamiltonian indicates how to march forward in time, but the time is different in different [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. The Lagrangian is a [[Lorentz scalar]], while the Hamiltonian is the time component of a [[four-vector]]. So the Hamiltonian is different in different frames, and this type of symmetry is not apparent in the original formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is a function of the position and momentum at one time, and it determines the position and momentum a little later. The Lagrangian is a function of the position now and the position a little later (or, equivalently for infinitesimal time separations, it is a function of the position and velocity). The relation between the two is by a [[Legendre transformation]], and the condition that determines the classical equations of motion (the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s) is that the [[action (physics)|action]] has an extremum.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the Legendre transform is hard to interpret, because the motion is not over a definite trajectory. In classical mechanics, with [[discretization]] in time, the Legendre transform becomes\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon H = p(t)\\big(q(t + \\varepsilon) - q(t)\\big) - \\varepsilon L</math>\nand\n:<math> p = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}},</math>\n\nwhere the partial derivative with respect to <math>\\dot q</math> holds {{math|''q''(''t'' + ''ε'')}} fixed. The inverse Legendre transform is\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon L = \\varepsilon p \\dot{q} - \\varepsilon H,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\dot q = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p},</math>\n\nand the partial derivative now is with respect to {{mvar|p}} at fixed {{mvar|q}}.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the state is a [[quantum superposition|superposition of different states]] with different values of {{mvar|q}}, or different values of {{mvar|p}}, and the quantities {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} can be interpreted as noncommuting operators. The operator {{mvar|p}} is only definite on states that are indefinite with respect to {{mvar|q}}. So consider two states separated in time and act with the operator corresponding to the Lagrangian:\n\n:<math> e^{i\\big[p \\big(q(t + \\varepsilon) - q(t)\\big) - \\varepsilon H(p, q) \\big]}.</math>\n\nIf the multiplications implicit in this formula are reinterpreted as ''matrix'' multiplications, the first factor is\n\n:<math> e^{-ip q(t)},</math>\n\nand if this is also interpreted as a matrix multiplication, the sum over all states integrates over all {{math|''q''(''t'')}}, and so it takes the [[Fourier transform]] in {{math|''q''(''t'')}} to change basis to {{math|''p''(''t'')}}. That is the action on the Hilbert space – '''change basis to {{mvar|p}} at time {{mvar|t}}'''.\n\nNext comes\n\n:<math>e^{-i\\varepsilon H(p,q)},</math>\n\nor '''evolve an infinitesimal time into the future'''.\n\nFinally, the last factor in this interpretation is\n\n:<math>e^{i p q(t + \\varepsilon)},</math>\n\nwhich means '''change basis back to {{mvar|q}} at a later time'''.\n\nThis is not very different from just ordinary time evolution: the {{mvar|H}} factor contains all the dynamical information – it pushes the state forward in time. The first part and the last part are just Fourier transforms to change to a pure {{mvar|q}} basis from an intermediate {{mvar|p}} basis.\n{{quote box|align=right|width=42em|quote=...we see that the integrand in (11) must be of the form {{math|''e''<sup>''iF''/''h''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|F}} is a function of {{math|''q''<sub>''T''</sub>, ''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, … ''q''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''q''<sub>''t''</sub>}}, which remains finite as {{mvar|h}} tends to zero. Let us now picture one of the intermediate {{mvar|q}}s, say {{mvar|q<sub>k</sub>}}, as varying continuously while the other ones are fixed. Owing to the smallness of {{mvar|h}}, we shall then in general have ''F''/''h'' varying extremely rapidly. This means that {{math|''e''<sup>''iF''/''h''</sup>}} will vary periodically with a very high frequency about the value zero, as a result of which its integral will be practically zero. The only important part in the domain of integration of {{mvar|q<sub>k</sub>}} is thus that for which a comparatively large variation in {{mvar|q<sub>k</sub>}} produces only a very small variation in {{mvar|F}}. This part is the neighbourhood of a point for which {{mvar|F}} is stationary with respect to small variations in {{mvar|q<sub>k</sub>}}. We can apply this argument to each of the variables of integration ... and obtain the result that the only important part in the domain of integration is that for which {{mvar|F}} is stationary for small variations in all intermediate {{mvar|q}}s. ... We see that {{mvar|F}} has for its classical analogue {{math|{{intmath|int|''T''|''t''}} ''L dt''}}, which is just the action function, which classical mechanics requires to be stationary for small variations in all the intermediate {{mvar|q}}s. This shows the way in which equation (11) goes over into classical results when {{mvar|h}} becomes extremely small. |source=Dirac (1933), p. 69}}\n\nAnother way of saying this is that since the Hamiltonian is naturally a function of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}, exponentiating this quantity and changing basis from {{mvar|p}} to {{mvar|q}} at each step allows the matrix element of {{mvar|H}} to be expressed as a simple function along each path. This function is the quantum analog of the classical action. This observation is due to [[Paul Dirac]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dirac|1933}}</ref>\n\nDirac further noted that one could square the time-evolution operator in the {{mvar|S}} representation:\n\n:<math> e^{i\\varepsilon S},</math>\n\nand this gives the time-evolution operator between time {{mvar|t}} and time {{math|''t'' + 2''ε''}}. While in the {{mvar|H}} representation the quantity that is being summed over the intermediate states is an obscure matrix element, in the {{mvar|S}} representation it is reinterpreted as a quantity associated to the path. In the limit that one takes a large power of this operator, one reconstructs the full quantum evolution between two states, the early one with a fixed value of {{math|''q''(0)}} and the later one with a fixed value of {{math|''q''(''t'')}}. The result is a sum over paths with a phase, which is the quantum action. Crucially, Dirac identified in this article the deep quantum-mechanical reason for the [[principle of least action]] controlling the classical limit (see quotation box).\n\n== Feynman's interpretation ==\n\nDirac's work did not provide a precise prescription to calculate the sum over paths, and he did not show that one could recover the Schrödinger equation or the [[canonical commutation relation]]s from this rule. This was done by Feynman.<ref group=nb>Both noted that in the limit of action that is large compared to the reduced [[Planck's constant]] {{mvar|ħ}} (using [[natural units]], {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}}), or the classical limit, the path integral is dominated by solutions which are in the neighborhood of [[stationary point]]s of the action.</ref> That is, the classical path arises naturally in the classical limit.\n\nFeynman showed that Dirac's quantum action was, for most cases of interest, simply equal to the classical action, appropriately discretized. This means that the classical action is the phase acquired by quantum evolution between two fixed endpoints. He proposed to recover all of quantum mechanics from the following postulates:\n# The [[probability]] for an event is given by the squared modulus of a complex number called the \"probability amplitude\".\n# The [[probability amplitude]] is given by adding together the contributions of all paths in configuration space.\n# The contribution of a path is proportional to {{math|''e''<sup>''iS''/''ħ''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|S}} is the [[Action (physics)|action]] given by the [[time integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] along the path.\n\nIn order to find the overall probability amplitude for a given process, then, one adds up, or [[integral|integrates]], the amplitude of the 3rd postulate over the space of ''all'' possible paths of the system in between the initial and final states, including those that are absurd by classical standards. In calculating the probability amplitude for a single particle to go from one space-time coordinate to another, it is correct to include paths in which the particle describes elaborate [[curlicues]], curves in which the particle shoots off into outer space and flies back again, and so forth. The '''path integral''' assigns to all these amplitudes ''equal weight'' but varying [[phase (waves)|phase]], or argument of the [[complex number]]. Contributions from paths wildly different from the classical trajectory may be suppressed by [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] (see below).\n\nFeynman showed that this formulation of quantum mechanics is equivalent to the [[Quantization (physics)|canonical approach to quantum mechanics]] when the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momentum.  An amplitude computed according to Feynman's principles will also obey the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] corresponding to the given action.\n\nThe path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the [[transition amplitude]] (corresponding to the classical [[correlation function]]) as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state. A [[Feynman diagram]] is a graphical representation of a [[perturbative]] contribution to the transition amplitude.\n\n== Path integral in quantum mechanics ==\n\n=== Time-slicing derivation ===\n{{main|Relation between Schrödinger%27s equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics}}\nOne common approach to deriving the path integral formula is to divide the time interval into small pieces. Once this is done, the [[Lie product formula|Trotter product formula]] tells us that the noncommutativity of the kinetic and potential energy operators can be ignored.\n\nFor a particle in a smooth potential, the path integral is approximated by [[zigzag]] paths, which in one dimension is a product of ordinary integrals. For the motion of the particle from position {{mvar|x<sub>a</sub>}} at time {{mvar|t<sub>a</sub>}} to {{mvar|x<sub>b</sub>}} at time {{mvar|t<sub>b</sub>}}, the time sequence\n:<math>t_a = t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots < t_{n-1} < t_n < t_{n+1} = t_b</math>\ncan be divided up into {{math|''n'' + 1}} smaller segments {{math|''t<sub>j</sub>'' − ''t''<sub>''j'' − 1</sub>}}, where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n'' + 1}}, of fixed duration\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\Delta t = \\frac{t_b - t_a}{n + 1}.</math>\n\nThis process is called ''time-slicing''.\n\nAn approximation for the path integral can be computed as proportional to\n\n:<math>\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\cdots \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\n \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_a}^{t_b} L\\big(x(t), v(t)\\big) \\,dt\\right) \\,dx_0 \\, \\cdots \\, dx_n, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''L''(''x'', ''v'')}} is the Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system with position variable {{math|''x''(''t'')}} and velocity {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''ẋ''(''t'')}} considered (see below), and {{mvar|dx<sub>j</sub>}} corresponds to the position at the {{mvar|j}}th time step, if the time integral is approximated by a sum of {{mvar|n}} terms.<ref group=nb>For a simplified, step-by-step derivation of the above relation, see [http://www.quantumfieldtheory.info/website_Chap18.pdf Path Integrals in Quantum Theories: A Pedagogic 1st Step].</ref>\n\nIn the limit {{mvar|''n'' → ∞}}, this becomes a [[functional integral]], which, apart from a nonessential factor, is directly the product of the probability amplitudes {{math|{{bra-ket|''x<sub>b</sub>'', ''t<sub>b</sub>''|''x<sub>a</sub>'', ''t<sub>a</sub>''}}}} (more precisely, since one must work with a continuous spectrum, the respective densities) to find the quantum mechanical particle at {{mvar|t<sub>a</sub>}} in the initial state {{mvar|x<sub>a</sub>}} and at {{mvar|t<sub>b</sub>}} in the final state {{mvar|x<sub>b</sub>}}.\n\nActually {{mvar|L}} is the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of the one-dimensional system considered,\n:<math> L(x, \\dot x) = T-V=\\frac{1}{2}m|\\dot{x}|^2-V(x)</math>\nand the abovementioned \"zigzagging\" corresponds to the appearance of the terms\n\n:<math>\\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\varepsilon \\sum_{j=1}^{n+1} L \\left(\\tilde x_j, \\frac{x_j - x_{j-1}}{\\varepsilon}, j \\right)\\right)</math>\n\nin the [[Riemann sum]] approximating the time integral, which are finally integrated over {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{mvar|x<sub>n</sub>}} with the integration measure {{math|''dx''<sub>1</sub>...''dx<sub>n</sub>''}}, {{mvar|x̃<sub>j</sub>}} is an arbitrary value of the interval corresponding to {{mvar|j}}, e.g. its center, {{math|{{sfrac|''x<sub>j</sub>'' + ''x''<sub>''j''−1</sub>|2}}}}.\n\nThus, in contrast to classical mechanics, not only does the stationary path contribute, but actually all virtual paths between the initial and the final point also contribute.\n\n===Path integral formula===\n\nIn terms of the wave function in the position representation, the path integral formula reads as follows:\n:<math>\\psi(x,t)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\int_{\\mathbf{x}(0)=x}\\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}\\, e^{iS[\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}]}\\psi_0(\\mathbf{x}(t))\\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}</math> denotes integration over all paths <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> with <math>\\mathbf{x}(0)=x</math> and where <math>Z</math> is a normalization factor. Here <math>S</math> is the action, given by\n:<math>S[\\mathbf{x},\\dot\\mathbf{x}]=\\int dt\\, L(\\mathbf{x}(t),\\dot\\mathbf{x}(t))</math>\n\n[[File:Path integral example.webm|thumb|The diagram shows the contribution to the path integral of a free particle for a set of paths.]]\n\n=== Free particle ===\n\nThe path integral representation gives the quantum amplitude to go from point {{mvar|x}} to point {{mvar|y}} as an integral over all paths. For a free-particle action (for simplicity let {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}})\n:<math>S = \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{2}\\, dt,</math>\n\nthe integral can be evaluated explicitly.\n\nTo do this, it is convenient to start without the factor {{mvar|i}} in the exponential, so that large deviations are suppressed by small numbers, not by cancelling oscillatory contributions. The amplitude (or Kernel) reads:\n:<math>K(x - y; T) = \\int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^T \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{2} \\,dt\\right) \\,Dx.</math>\n\nSplitting the integral into time slices:\n:<math>K(x, y; T) = \\int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \\prod_t \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\left(\\frac{x(t + \\varepsilon) - x(t)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^2 \\varepsilon \\right) \\,Dx,</math>\n\nwhere the {{mvar|Dx}} is interpreted as a finite collection of integrations at each integer multiple of {{mvar|ε}}. Each factor in the product is a Gaussian as a function of {{math|''x''(''t'' + ''ε'')}} centered at {{math|''x''(''t'')}} with variance {{mvar|ε}}. The multiple integrals are a repeated [[convolution]] of this Gaussian {{mvar|G<sub>ε</sub>}} with copies of itself at adjacent times:\n:<math>K(x - y; T) = G_\\varepsilon * G_\\varepsilon * \\cdots * G_\\varepsilon,</math>\n\nwhere the number of convolutions is {{math|{{sfrac|''T''|''ε''}}}}. The result is easy to evaluate by taking the Fourier transform of both sides, so that the convolutions become multiplications:\n:<math>\\tilde{K}(p; T) = \\tilde{G}_\\varepsilon(p)^{T/\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nThe Fourier transform of the Gaussian {{mvar|G}} is another Gaussian of reciprocal variance:\n\n:<math>\\tilde{G}_\\varepsilon(p) = e^{-\\frac{\\varepsilon p^2}{2}},</math>\n\nand the result is\n:<math>\\tilde{K}(p; T) = e^{-\\frac{T p^2}{2}}.</math>\n\nThe Fourier transform gives {{mvar|K}}, and it is a Gaussian again with reciprocal variance:\n:<math>K(x - y; T) \\propto e^{ -\\frac{(x - y)^2}{2T}}.</math>\n\nThe proportionality constant is not really determined by the time-slicing approach, only the ratio of values for different endpoint choices is determined. The proportionality constant should be chosen to ensure that between each two time slices the time evolution is quantum-mechanically unitary, but a more illuminating way to fix the normalization is to consider the path integral as a description of a stochastic process.\n\nThe result has a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths of the exponential factor can be seen as the sum over each path of the probability of selecting that path. The probability is the product over each segment of the probability of selecting that segment, so that each segment is probabilistically independently chosen. The fact that the answer is a Gaussian spreading linearly in time is the [[central limit theorem]], which can be interpreted as the first historical evaluation of a statistical path integral.\n\nThe probability interpretation gives a natural normalization choice. The path integral should be defined so that\n:<math>\\int K(x - y; T) \\,dy = 1.</math>\n\nThis condition normalizes the Gaussian and produces a kernel that obeys the diffusion equation:\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = \\frac{\\nabla^2}{2} K.</math>\n\nFor oscillatory path integrals, ones with an {{mvar|i}} in the numerator, the time slicing produces convolved Gaussians, just as before. Now, however, the convolution product is marginally singular, since it requires careful limits to evaluate the oscillating integrals. To make the factors well defined, the easiest way is to add a small imaginary part to the time increment {{mvar|ε}}. This is closely related to [[Wick rotation]]. Then the same convolution argument as before gives the propagation kernel:\n:<math>K(x - y; T) \\propto e^\\frac{i(x - y)^2}{2T},</math>\n\nwhich, with the same normalization as before (not the sum-squares normalization – this function has a divergent norm), obeys a free Schrödinger equation:\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = i \\frac{\\nabla^2}{2} K.</math>\n\nThis means that any superposition of {{mvar|K}}s will also obey the same equation, by linearity. Defining\n:<math>\\psi_t(y) = \\int \\psi_0(x) K(x - y; t) \\,dx = \\int \\psi_0(x) \\int_{x(0) = x}^{x(t) = y} e^{iS} \\,Dx,</math>\n\nthen {{mvar|ψ<sub>t</sub>}} obeys the free Schrödinger equation just as {{mvar|K}} does:\n:<math>i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi_t = -\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2} \\psi_t.</math>\n\n=== Simple harmonic oscillator ===\nThe Lagrangian for the simple harmonic oscillator is\n:<math>\\mathcal{L} = \\tfrac12 m \\dot{x}^2 - \\tfrac12 m \\omega^2 x^2.</math>\n\nWrite its trajectory {{math|''x''(''t'')}} as the classical trajectory plus some perturbation, {{math|''x''(''t'') {{=}} ''x''<sub>c</sub>(''t'') + ''δx''(''t'')}} and the action as {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''<sub>c</sub> + ''δS''}}. The classical trajectory can be written as\n\n:<math>x_\\text{c}(t) = x_i \\frac{\\sin\\omega(t_f - t)}{\\sin\\omega(t_f - t_i)} + x_f \\frac{\\sin\\omega(t - t_i)}{\\sin\\omega(t_f - t_i)}.</math>\n\n\nThis trajectory yields the classical action\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nS_\\text{c} & = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\mathcal{L} \\,dt = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\left(\\tfrac12 m\\dot{x}^2 - \\tfrac12 m\\omega^2 x^2 \\right) \\,dt \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac 1 2 m\\omega \\left( \\frac{(x_i^2 + x_f^2) \\cos\\omega(t_f - t_i) - 2 x_i x_f}{\\sin\\omega(t_f - t_i)} \\right)~.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNext, expand the non-classical contribution to the action {{mvar|δS}} as a Fourier series, which gives\n:<math>S = S_\\text{c} + \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\tfrac12 a_n^2 \\frac{m}{2} \\left( \\frac{(n \\pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \\omega^2(t_f - t_i) \\right).</math>\n\nThis means that the propagator is\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nK(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) & = Q e^\\frac{i S_\\text{c}}{\\hbar} \\prod_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{j \\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} \\int da_j \\exp{\\left( \\frac{i}{2\\hbar}a_j^2 \\frac{m}{2} \\left( \\frac{(j \\pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \\omega^2(t_f - t_i) \\right) \\right)} \\\\[6pt]\n& = e^\\frac{i S_\\text{c}}{\\hbar} Q \\prod_{j=1}^\\infty \\left( 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\omega(t_f - t_i)}{j \\pi} \\right)^2 \\right)^{-\\frac12}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nfor some normalization\n:<math> Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi i \\hbar (t_f - t_i)}}~. </math>\n\nUsing the infinite-product representation of the [[sinc function]],\n:<math>\\prod_{j=1}^\\infty \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^2}{j^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sin\\pi x}{\\pi x}, </math>\nthe propagator can be written as\n:<math> K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = Q e^\\frac{i S_\\text{c}}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\omega(t_f - t_i)}{\\sin\\omega(t_f - t_i)} } = e^\\frac{i S_c}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{ \\frac{m\\omega}{2\\pi i \\hbar \\sin\\omega(t_f - t_i)}}.</math>\n\nLet {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''t<sub>f</sub>'' − ''t<sub>i</sub>''}}.

Only after replacing the time {{mvar|t}} by another path-dependent pseudo-time parameter\n:<math>s = \\int \\frac{dt}{r(t)}</math>\nthe singularity is removed and a time-sliced approximation exists, which is exactly integrable, since it can be made harmonic by a simple coordinate transformation, as discovered in 1979 by [[İsmail Hakkı Duru]] and [[Hagen Kleinert]].<ref>{{harvnb|Duru|Kleinert|1979|loc=Chapter 13.}}</ref> The combination of a path-dependent time transformation and a coordinate transformation is an important tool to solve many path integrals and is called generically the [[Duru–Kleinert transformation]].\n\n=== The Schrödinger equation ===\n\n{{Main|Relation between Schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe path integral reproduces the Schrödinger equation for the initial and final state even when a potential is present. This is easiest to see by taking a path-integral over infinitesimally separated times.\n:<math>\\psi(y;t+\\varepsilon) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi(x;t)\\int_{x(t)=x}^{x(t+\\varepsilon)=y} e^{i\\int\\limits_t^{t+\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{2} - V(x)\\right)\\, dt}\\, Dx(t) \\, dx\\qquad (1)</math>\n\nSince the time separation is infinitesimal and the cancelling oscillations become severe for large values of {{mvar|ẋ}}, the path integral has most weight for {{mvar|y}} close to {{mvar|x}}. In this case, to lowest order the potential energy is constant, and only the kinetic energy contribution is nontrivial. (This separation of the kinetic and potential energy terms in the exponent is essentially the [[Lie product formula|Trotter product formula]].) The exponential of the action is\n:<math>e^{-i\\varepsilon V(x)} e^{i\\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{2}\\varepsilon}</math>\n\nThe first term rotates the phase of {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} locally by an amount proportional to the potential energy. The second term is the free particle propagator, corresponding to {{mvar|i}} times a diffusion process. To lowest order in {{mvar|ε}} they are additive; in any case one has with (1):\n\n:<math>\\psi(y;t+\\varepsilon) \\approx \\int \\psi(x;t) e^{-i\\varepsilon V(x)} e^\\frac{i(x-y)^2 }{ 2\\varepsilon} \\,dx\\,.</math>\n\nAs mentioned, the spread in {{mvar|ψ}} is diffusive from the free particle propagation, with an extra infinitesimal rotation in phase which slowly varies from point to point from the potential:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t} = i\\cdot \\left(\\tfrac12\\nabla^2 - V(x)\\right)\\psi\\,</math>\n\nand this is the Schrödinger equation. Note that the normalization of the path integral needs to be fixed in exactly the same way as in the free particle case. An arbitrary continuous potential does not affect the normalization, although singular potentials require careful treatment.\n\n=== Equations of motion ===\n\nSince the states obey the Schrödinger equation, the path integral must reproduce the Heisenberg equations of motion for the averages of {{mvar|x}} and  {{mvar|ẋ}} variables, but it is instructive to see this directly. The direct approach shows that the expectation values calculated from the path integral reproduce the usual ones of quantum mechanics.\n\nStart by considering the path integral with some fixed initial state\n:<math>\\int \\psi_0(x) \\int_{x(0)=x} e^{iS(x,\\dot{x})}\\, Dx\\,</math>\n\nNow note that {{mvar|''x''(''t'')}} at each separate time is a separate integration variable. So it is legitimate to change variables in the integral by shifting: {{math|''x''(''t'') {{=}} ''u''(''t'') + ''ε''(''t'')}} where {{math|''ε''(''t'')}} is a different shift at each time but {{math|''ε''(0) {{=}} ''ε''(''T'') {{=}} 0}}, since the endpoints are not integrated:\n:<math>\\int \\psi_0(x) \\int_{u(0)=x} e^{iS(u+\\varepsilon,\\dot{u}+\\dot{\\varepsilon})}\\, Du\\,</math>\n\nThe change in the integral from the shift is, to first infinitesimal order in {{mvar|ε}}:\n:<math>\\int \\psi_0(x) \\int_{u(0)=x} \\left( \\int \\frac{\\partial S }{ \\partial u } \\varepsilon + \\frac{ \\partial S }{ \\partial \\dot{u} } \\dot{\\varepsilon}\\, dt \\right) e^{iS} \\,Du\\,</math>\n\nwhich, integrating by parts in {{mvar|t}}, gives:\n:<math>\\int \\psi_0(x) \\int_{u(0)=x} -\\left( \\int \\left(\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\dot{u}} - \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial u}\\right)\\varepsilon(t)\\, dt \\right) e^{iS}\\, Du\\,</math>\n\nBut this was just a shift of integration variables, which doesn't change the value of the integral for any choice of {{mvar|''ε''(''t'')}}. The conclusion is that this first order variation is zero for an arbitrary initial state and at any arbitrary point in time:\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\psi_0\\left| \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}(t) \\right|\\psi_0 \\right\\rangle = 0</math>\nthis is the Heisenberg equation of motion.\n\nIf the action contains terms which multiply {{mvar|ẋ}} and {{mvar|x}}, at the same moment in time, the manipulations above are only heuristic, because the multiplication rules for these quantities is just as noncommuting in the path integral as it is in the operator formalism.\n\n=== Stationary-phase approximation ===\n\nIf the variation in the action exceeds {{mvar|ħ}} by many orders of magnitude, we typically have destructive interference other than in the vicinity of those trajectories satisfying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]], which is now reinterpreted as the condition for constructive interference. This can be shown using the method of stationary phase applied to the propagator. As {{mvar|ħ}} decreases, the exponential in the integral oscillates rapidly in the complex domain for any change in the action. Thus, in the limit that {{mvar|ħ}} goes to zero, only points where the classical action does not vary contribute to the propagator.\n\n=== Canonical commutation relations ===\n\nThe formulation of the path integral does not make it clear at first sight that the quantities {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|p}} do not commute. In the path integral, these are just integration variables and they have no obvious ordering. Feynman discovered that the non-commutativity is still present.<ref>{{harvnb|Feynman|1948}}</ref>\n\nTo see this, consider the simplest path integral, the brownian walk. This is not yet quantum mechanics, so in the path-integral the action is not multiplied by {{mvar|i}}:\n\n:<math>S=  \\int \\left( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2\\, dt</math>\n\nThe quantity {{mvar|''x''(''t'')}} is fluctuating, and the derivative is defined as the limit of a discrete difference.\n\n:<math>\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{x(t+\\varepsilon) - x(t)} \\varepsilon </math>\n\nNote that the distance that a random walk moves is proportional to {{math|{{sqrt|''t''}}}}, so that:\n:<math>x(t+\\varepsilon) - x(t) \\approx \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}</math>\nThis shows that the random walk is not differentiable, since the ratio that defines the derivative diverges with probability one.\n\nThe quantity {{mvar|xẋ}} is ambiguous, with two possible meanings:\n\n:<math>[1] = x \\frac{dx}{dt}  = x(t) \\frac{x(t+\\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\\varepsilon } </math>\n\n:<math>[2] = x \\frac{dx}{dt} = x(t+\\varepsilon) \\frac{x(t+\\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\\varepsilon} </math>\n\nIn elementary calculus, the two are only different by an amount which goes to 0 as {{mvar|ε}} goes to 0. But in this case, the difference between the two is not 0:\n\n:<math>[2] - [1] =  \\frac{\\big( x(t + \\varepsilon) - x(t)\\big )^2}{\\varepsilon} \\approx \\frac \\varepsilon \\varepsilon</math>\n\ngive a name to the value of the difference for any one random walk:\n:<math>\\frac{\\big(x(t+\\varepsilon)- x(t)\\big)^2 }{\\varepsilon} = f(t)</math>\n\nand note that {{math|''f''(''t'')}} is a rapidly fluctuating statistical quantity, whose average value is 1, i.e. a normalized \"Gaussian process\". The fluctuations of such a quantity can be described by a statistical Lagrangian\n:<math>\\mathcal L =  (f(t)-1)^2 \\,,</math>\nand the equations of motion for {{mvar|f}} derived from extremizing the action {{mvar|S}} corresponding to {{mathcal|L}} just set it equal to 1. In physics, such a quantity is \"equal to 1 as an operator identity\". In mathematics, it \"weakly converges to 1\". In either case, it is 1 in any expectation value, or when averaged over any interval, or for all practical purpose.\n\nDefining the time order to ''be'' the operator order:\n:<math>[x, \\dot x] = x \\frac{dx}{dt} - \\frac{dx}{dt} x = 1</math>\n\nThis is called the [[Itō lemma]] in [[stochastic calculus]], and the (euclideanized) canonical commutation relations in physics.\n\nFor a general statistical action, a similar argument shows that\n:<math>\\left[x , \\frac{\\partial S }{ \\partial \\dot x} \\right] = 1</math>\nand in quantum mechanics, the extra imaginary unit in the action converts this to the canonical commutation relation,\n:<math>[x,p ] = i</math>\n\n=== Particle in curved space ===\n\nFor a particle in curved space the kinetic term depends on the position, and the above time slicing cannot be applied, this being a manifestation of the notorious [[operator ordering problem]] in Schrödinger quantum mechanics. One may, however, solve this problem by transforming the time-sliced flat-space path integral to curved space using a multivalued coordinate transformation ([[nonholonomic mapping]] explained [http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/b5/psfiles/pthic10.pdf here]).\n\n=== Measure-theoretic factors ===\nSometimes (e.g. a particle moving in curved space) we also have measure-theoretic factors in the functional integral:\n:<math>\\int \\mu[x] e^{iS[x]} \\,\\mathcal{D}x.</math>\nThis factor is needed to restore unitarity.\n\nFor instance, if\n:<math>S = \\int \\left( \\frac{m}{2} g_{ij} \\dot{x}^i \\dot{x}^j - V(x) \\right) \\,dt,</math>\nthen it means that each spatial slice is multiplied by the measure {{math|{{sqrt|''g''}}}}. This measure cannot be expressed as a functional multiplying the {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''x''}} measure because they belong to entirely different classes.\n\n==Euclidean path integrals==\nIt is very common in path integrals to perform a [[Wick rotation]] from real to imaginary times. In the setting of quantum field theory, the Wick rotation changes the geometry of space-time from Lorentzian to Euclidean; as a result, Wick-rotated path integrals are often called Euclidean path integrals.\n\n===Wick rotation and the Feynman–Kac formula===\nIf we replace <math>t</math> by <math>-it</math>, the time-evolution operator <math>e^{-it\\hat{H}/\\hbar}</math> is replaced by <math>e^{-t\\hat{H}/\\hbar}</math>. (This change is known as a [[Wick rotation]].) If we repeat the derivation of the path-integral formula in this setting, we obtain<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013|loc=Section 20.3.}}</ref>\n:<math>\\psi(x,t)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\int_{\\mathbf{x}(0)=x} e^{-S_{\\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{x}})/\\hbar}\\psi_0(\\mathbf{x}(t))\\, \\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}\\,</math>,\nwhere <math>S_{\\mathrm{Euclidean}}</math> is the Euclidean action, given by\n:<math>S_{\\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{x}})=\\int\\left[ \\frac{m}{2}|\\dot\\mathbf{x}(t)|^2+V(\\mathbf{x}(t))\\right] \\,dt</math>.\nNote the sign change between this and the normal action, where the potential energy term is negative. (The term ''Euclidean'' is from the context of quantum field theory, where the change from real to imaginary time changes the space-time geometry from Lorentzian to Euclidean.)\n\nNow, the contribution of the kinetic energy to the path integral is as follows:\n:<math>\\frac{1}{Z}\\int_{\\mathbf{x}(0)=x} f(\\mathbf{x})e^{-\\frac{m}{2}\\int |\\dot\\mathbf{x}|^2dt}\\, \\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}\\,</math>\nwhere <math>f(\\mathbf{x})</math> includes all the remaining dependence of the integrand on the path. This integral has a rigorous mathematical interpretation as integration against the [[Wiener process|Wiener measure]], denoted <math>\\mu_{x}</math>. The Wiener measure, constructed by [[Norbert Wiener]] gives a rigorous foundation to [[Brownian motion#Einstein.27s theory|Einstein's mathematical model of Brownian motion]]. The subscript <math>x</math> indicates that the measure <math>\\mu_x</math> is supported on paths <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> with <math>\\mathbf{x}(0)=x</math>.\n\nWe then have a rigorous version of the Feynman path integral, known as the [[Feynman–Kac formula]]:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013|loc=Theorem 20.3.}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\psi(x,t)=\\int e^{-\\int V(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,dt/\\hbar}\\,\\psi_0(\\mathbf{x}(t)) \\,d\\mu_x(\\mathbf{x})</math>,\n\nwhere now <math>\\psi(x,t)</math> satisfies the Wick-rotated version of the Schrödinger equation,\n:<math>\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi(x,t) = -\\hat H \\psi(x,t)</math>.\nAlthough the Wick-rotated Schrödinger equation does not have a direct physical meaning, interesting properties of the Schrödinger operator <math>\\hat{H}</math> can be extracted by studying it.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|1979}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the study of quantum field theories from the path-integral perspective, in both the mathematics and physics literatures, is done in the Euclidean setting, that is, after a Wick rotation. In particular, there are various results showing that if a Euclidean field theory with suitable properties can be constructed, one can then undo the Wick rotation to recover the physical, Lorentzian theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Glimm|Jaffe|1981|loc=Chapter 19.}}</ref> On the other hand, it is much more difficult to give a meaning to path integrals (even Euclidean path integrals) in quantum field theory than in quantum mechanics.<ref>For a brief account of the origins of these difficulties, see {{harvtxt|Hall|2013|loc=Section 20.6.}}</ref>\n\n=== The path integral and the partition function ===\n\nThe path integral is just the generalization of the integral above to all quantum mechanical problems—\n:<math>Z = \\int  e^\\frac{i\\mathcal{S}[\\mathbf{x}]}{\\hbar}\\, \\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x} \\quad\\text{where }\\mathcal{S}[\\mathbf{x}]=\\int_0^T L[\\mathbf{x}(t),\\dot\\mathbf{x}(t)]\\, dt</math>\nis the [[action (physics)|action]] of the classical problem in which one investigates the path starting at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} and ending at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''T''}}, and <math>\\mathcal{D}\\mathbf{x}</math> denotes integration over all paths. In the classical limit, <math>\\mathcal{S}[\\mathbf{x}]\\gg\\hbar</math>, the path of minimum action dominates the integral, because the phase of any path away from this fluctuates rapidly and different contributions cancel.<ref name=\"Feynman-Hibbs\">{{harvnb|Feynman|Hibbs|Styer|2010|pp=29–31}}</ref>\n\nThe connection with [[statistical mechanics]] follows. Considering only paths which begin and end in the same configuration, perform the [[Wick rotation]] {{math|''it'' {{=}} ''τ''}}, i.e., make time imaginary, and integrate over all possible beginning-ending configurations. The Wick-rotated path integral—described in the previous subsection, with the ordinary action replaced by its \"Euclidean\" counterpart—now resembles the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of statistical mechanics defined in a [[canonical ensemble]] with inverse temperature proportional to imaginary time, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''<sub>B</sub>''τ''|''ħ''}}}}. Strictly speaking, though, this is the partition function for a [[statistical field theory]].\n\nClearly, such a deep analogy between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics cannot be dependent on the formulation. In the canonical formulation, one sees that the unitary evolution operator of a state is given by\n\n:<math>|\\alpha;t\\rangle=e^{-\\frac{iHt}{\\hbar}}|\\alpha;0\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere the state {{mvar|α}} is evolved from time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. If one makes a Wick rotation here, and finds the amplitude to go from any state, back to the same state in (imaginary) time {{mvar|iT}} is given by\n\n: <math>Z = \\operatorname{Tr} \\left[e^\\frac{-HT}{\\hbar}\\right]</math>\n\nwhich is precisely the partition function of statistical mechanics for the same system at temperature quoted earlier. One aspect of this equivalence was also known to [[Erwin Schrödinger]] who remarked that the equation named after him looked like the [[diffusion equation]] after Wick rotation. Note, however, that the Euclidean path integral is actually in the form of a ''classical'' statistical mechanics model.\n\n== Quantum field theory ==\n{{Quantum field theory}}\nBoth the Schrödinger and Heisenberg approaches to quantum mechanics single out time and are not in the spirit of relativity. For example, the Heisenberg approach requires that scalar field operators obey the commutation relation\n\n:<math>[\\varphi(x), \\partial_t \\varphi(y)] = i \\delta^3(x - y)</math>\n\nfor two simultaneous spatial positions {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, and this is not a relativistically invariant concept. The results of a calculation ''are'' covariant, but the symmetry is not apparent in intermediate stages. If naive field-theory calculations did not produce infinite answers in the continuum limit, this would not have been such a big problem – it would just have been a bad choice of coordinates. But the lack of symmetry means that the infinite quantities must be cut off, and the bad coordinates make it nearly impossible to cut off the theory without spoiling the symmetry. This makes it difficult to extract the physical predictions, which require a [[renormalization|careful limiting procedure]].\n\nThe problem of lost symmetry also appears in classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian formulation also superficially singles out time. The Lagrangian formulation makes the relativistic invariance apparent. In the same way, the path integral is manifestly relativistic. It reproduces the Schrödinger equation, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the canonical commutation relations and shows that they are compatible with relativity. It extends the Heisenberg-type operator algebra to [[operator product expansion|operator product rules]], which are new relations difficult to see in the old formalism.\n\nFurther, different choices of canonical variables lead to very different-seeming formulations of the same theory. The transformations between the variables can be very complicated, but the path integral makes them into reasonably straightforward changes of integration variables. For these reasons, the Feynman path integral has made earlier formalisms largely obsolete.\n\nThe price of a path integral representation is that the unitarity of a theory is no longer self-evident, but it can be proven by changing variables to some canonical representation. The path integral itself also deals with larger mathematical spaces than is usual, which requires more careful mathematics, not all of which has been fully worked out. The path integral historically was not immediately accepted, partly because it took many years to incorporate fermions properly. This required physicists to invent an entirely new mathematical object – the [[Grassmann variable]] – which also allowed changes of variables to be done naturally, as well as allowing [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|constrained quantization]].\n\nThe integration variables in the path integral are subtly non-commuting. The value of the product of two field operators at what looks like the same point depends on how the two points are ordered in space and time. This makes some naive identities [[Anomaly (physics)|fail]].\n\n=== The propagator ===\n\nIn relativistic theories, there is both a particle and field representation for every theory. The field representation is a sum over all field configurations, and the particle representation is a sum over different particle paths.\n\nThe nonrelativistic formulation is traditionally given in terms of particle paths, not fields. There, the path integral in the usual variables, with fixed boundary conditions, gives the probability amplitude for a particle to go from point {{mvar|x}} to point {{mvar|y}} in time {{mvar|T}}:\n\n:<math>K(x, y; T) = \\langle y; T \\mid x; 0 \\rangle = \\int_{x(0)=x}^{x(T)=y} e^{i S[x]} \\,Dx.</math>\n\nThis is called the [[propagator]]. Superposing different values of the initial position {{mvar|x}} with an arbitrary initial state {{math|''ψ''<sub>0</sub>(''x'')}} constructs the final state:\n:<math>\\psi_T(y) = \\int_x \\psi_0(x) K(x, y; T) \\,dx = \\int^{x(T)=y} \\psi_0(x(0)) e^{i S[x]} \\,Dx.</math>\n\nFor a spatially homogeneous system, where {{math|''K''(''x'', ''y'')}} is only a function of {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}}, the integral is a [[convolution]], the final state is the initial state convolved with the propagator:\n:<math>\\psi_T = \\psi_0 * K(;T).</math>\n\nFor a free particle of mass {{mvar|m}}, the propagator can be evaluated either explicitly from the path integral or by noting that the Schrödinger equation is a diffusion equation in imaginary time, and the solution must be a normalized Gaussian:\n:<math>K(x, y; T) \\propto e^\\frac{i m(x - y)^2}{2T}.</math>\n\nTaking the Fourier transform in {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}} produces another Gaussian:\n\n:<math>K(p; T) = e^\\frac{i T p^2}{2m},</math>\n\nand in {{mvar|p}}-space the proportionality factor here is constant in time, as will be verified in a moment. The Fourier transform in time, extending {{math|''K''(''p''; ''T'')}} to be zero for negative times, gives Green's function, or the frequency-space propagator:\n:<math>G_\\text{F}(p, E) = \\frac{-i}{E - \\frac{\\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\\varepsilon},</math>\n\nwhich is the reciprocal of the operator that annihilates the wavefunction in the Schrödinger equation, which wouldn't have come out right if the proportionality factor weren't constant in the {{mvar|p}}-space representation.\n\nThe infinitesimal term in the denominator is a small positive number, which guarantees that the inverse Fourier transform in {{mvar|E}} will be nonzero only for future times. For past times, the inverse Fourier transform contour closes toward values of {{mvar|E}} where there is no singularity. This guarantees that {{mvar|K}} propagates the particle into the future and is the reason for the subscript \"F\" on {{mvar|G}}. The infinitesimal term can be interpreted as an infinitesimal rotation toward imaginary time.\n\nIt is also possible to reexpress the nonrelativistic time evolution in terms of propagators going toward the past, since the Schrödinger equation is time-reversible. The past propagator is the same as the future propagator except for the obvious difference that it vanishes in the future, and in the Gaussian {{mvar|t}} is replaced by {{math|−''t''}}. In this case, the interpretation is that these are the quantities to convolve the final wavefunction so as to get the initial wavefunction:\n:<math>G_\\text{B}(p, E) = \\frac{-i}{-E - \\frac{i\\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\\varepsilon}.</math>\nGiven the nearly identical only change is the sign of {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|ε}}, the parameter {{mvar|E}} in Green's function can either be the energy if the paths are going toward the future, or the negative of the energy if the paths are going toward the past.\n\nFor a nonrelativistic theory, the time as measured along the path of a moving particle and the time as measured by an outside observer are the same. In relativity, this is no longer true. For a relativistic theory the propagator should be defined as the sum over all paths that travel between two points in a fixed proper time, as measured along the path (these paths describe the trajectory of a particle in space and in time):\n\n:<math>K(x - y, \\Tau) = \\int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\\Tau)=y} e^{i \\int_0^\\Tau \\sqrt{{\\dot x}^2} - \\alpha \\,d\\tau}.</math>\n\nThe integral above is not trivial to interpret because of the square root. Fortunately, there is a heuristic trick. The sum is over the relativistic arc length of the path of an oscillating quantity, and like the nonrelativistic path integral should be interpreted as slightly rotated into imaginary time. The function {{math|''K''(''x'' − ''y'', ''τ'')}} can be evaluated when the sum is over paths in Euclidean space:\n:<math>K(x - y, \\Tau) = e^{-\\alpha \\Tau} \\int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\\Tau)=y} e^{-L}.</math>\n\nThis describes a sum over all paths of length {{math|Τ}} of the exponential of minus the length. This can be given a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths is a probability average over a path constructed step by step. The total number of steps is proportional to {{math|Τ}}, and each step is less likely the longer it is. By the [[central limit theorem]], the result of many independent steps is a Gaussian of variance proportional to {{math|Τ}}:\n:<math>K(x - y,\\Tau) = e^{-\\alpha \\Tau} e^{-\\frac{(x - y)^2}{\\Tau}}.</math>\n\nThe usual definition of the relativistic propagator only asks for the amplitude is to travel from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|y}}, after summing over all the possible proper times it could take:\n:<math>K(x - y) = \\int_0^\\infty K(x - y, \\Tau) W(\\Tau) \\,d\\Tau,</math>\nwhere {{math|''W''(Τ)}} is a weight factor, the relative importance of paths of different proper time. By the translation symmetry in proper time, this weight can only be an exponential factor and can be absorbed into the constant {{mvar|α}}:\n:<math>K(x - y) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\frac{(x - y)^2}{\\Tau} -\\alpha \\Tau} \\,d\\Tau.</math>\n\nThis is the [[Feynman diagram#Schwinger representation|Schwinger representation]]. Taking a Fourier transform over the variable {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}} can be done for each value of {{math|Τ}} separately, and because each separate {{math|Τ}} contribution is a Gaussian, gives whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian with reciprocal width. So in {{mvar|p}}-space, the propagator can be reexpressed simply:\n:<math>K(p) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\Tau p^2 - \\Tau \\alpha} \\,d\\Tau = \\frac{1}{p^2 + \\alpha},</math>\n\nwhich is the Euclidean propagator for a scalar particle. Rotating {{math|''p''<sub>0</sub>}} to be imaginary gives the usual relativistic propagator, up to a factor of {{math|−''i''}} and an ambiguity, which will be clarified below:\n:<math>K(p) = \\frac{i}{p_0^2 - \\vec{p}^2 - m^2}.</math>\n\nThis expression can be interpreted in the nonrelativistic limit, where it is convenient to split it by [[partial fractions]]:\n\n:<math>2 p_0 K(p) = \\frac{i}{p_0 - \\sqrt{\\vec{p}^2 + m^2}} + \\frac{i}{p_0 + \\sqrt{\\vec{p}^2 + m^2}}.</math>\n\nFor states where one nonrelativistic particle is present, the initial wavefunction has a frequency distribution concentrated near {{math|''p''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''m''}}. When convolving with the propagator, which in {{mvar|p}} space just means multiplying by the propagator, the second term is suppressed and the first term is enhanced. For frequencies near {{math|''p''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''m''}}, the dominant first term has the form\n\n:<math>2m K_\\text{NR}(p) = \\frac{i}{(p_0 - m) - \\frac{\\vec{p}^2}{2m}}.</math>\n\nThis is the expression for the nonrelativistic [[Green's function]] of a free Schrödinger particle.\n\nThe second term has a nonrelativistic limit also, but this limit is concentrated on frequencies that are negative. The second pole is dominated by contributions from paths where the proper time and the coordinate time are ticking in an opposite sense, which means that the second term is to be interpreted as the antiparticle. The nonrelativistic analysis shows that with this form the antiparticle still has positive energy.\n\nThe proper way to express this mathematically is that, adding a small suppression factor in proper time, the limit where {{math|''t'' → −∞}} of the first term must vanish, while the {{math|''t'' → +∞}} limit of the second term must vanish. In the Fourier transform, this means shifting the pole in {{math|''p''<sub>0</sub>}} slightly, so that the inverse Fourier transform will pick up a small decay factor in one of the time directions:\n\n:<math>K(p) = \\frac{i}{p_0 - \\sqrt{\\vec{p}^2 + m^2} + i\\varepsilon} + \\frac{i}{p_0 - \\sqrt{\\vec{p}^2+m^2} - i\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nWithout these terms, the pole contribution could not be unambiguously evaluated when taking the inverse Fourier transform of {{math|''p''<sub>0</sub>}}. The terms can be recombined:\n\n:<math>K(p) = \\frac{i}{p^2 - m^2 + i\\varepsilon},</math>\n\nwhich when factored, produces opposite-sign infinitesimal terms in each factor. This is the mathematically precise form of the relativistic particle propagator, free of any ambiguities. The {{mvar|ε}} term introduces a small imaginary part to the {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}, which in the Minkowski version is a small exponential suppression of long paths.\n\nSo in the relativistic case, the Feynman path-integral representation of the propagator includes paths going backwards in time, which describe antiparticles. The paths that contribute to the relativistic propagator go forward and backwards in time, and the [[Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation|interpretation]] of this is that the amplitude for a free particle to travel between two points includes amplitudes for the particle to fluctuate into an antiparticle, travel back in time, then forward again.\n\nUnlike the nonrelativistic case, it is impossible to produce a relativistic theory of local particle propagation without including antiparticles. All local differential operators have inverses that are nonzero outside the light cone, meaning that it is impossible to keep a particle from travelling faster than light. Such a particle cannot have a Green's function which is only nonzero in the future in a relativistically invariant theory.\n\n=== Functionals of fields ===\n\nHowever, the path integral formulation is also extremely important in ''direct'' application to quantum field theory, in which the \"paths\" or histories being considered are not the motions of a single particle, but the possible time evolutions of a [[field (physics)|field]] over all space.  The action is referred to technically as a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the field: {{math|''S''[''ϕ'']}}, where the field {{math|''ϕ''(''x<sup>μ</sup>'')}} is itself a function of space and time, and the square brackets are a reminder that the action depends on all the field's values everywhere, not just some particular value. ''One'' such given function {{math|''ϕ''(''x<sup>μ</sup>'')}} of [[spacetime]] is called a ''field configuration''. In principle, one integrates Feynman's amplitude over the class of all possible field configurations.\n\nMuch of the formal study of QFT is devoted to the properties of the resulting functional integral, and much effort (not yet entirely successful) has been made toward making these [[functional integral]]s mathematically precise.\n\nSuch a functional integral is extremely similar to the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] in [[statistical mechanics]].  Indeed, it is sometimes ''called'' a [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]], and the two are essentially mathematically identical except for the factor of {{mvar|i}} in the exponent in Feynman's postulate 3. [[Analytic continuation|Analytically continuing]] the integral to an imaginary time variable (called a [[Wick rotation]]) makes the functional integral even more like a statistical partition function and also tames some of the mathematical difficulties of working with these integrals.\n\n=== Expectation values ===\n\nIn [[quantum field theory]], if the [[action (physics)|action]] is given by the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{mathcal|S}} of field configurations (which only depends locally on the fields), then the [[time-ordered]] [[vacuum expectation value]] of [[polynomially bounded]] functional {{mvar|F}}, {{math|{{angbr|''F''}}}}, is given by\n\n:<math>\\langle F \\rangle = \\frac{\\int\\mathcal{D}\\varphi F[\\varphi]e^{i\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]}}{\\int\\mathcal{D}\\varphi e^{i\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]}}.</math>\n\nThe symbol {{math|∫{{mathcal|D}}''ϕ''}} here is a concise way to represent the infinite-dimensional integral over all possible field configurations on all of space-time. As stated above, the unadorned path integral in the denominator ensures proper normalization.\n\n=== As a probability ===\nStrictly speaking, the only question that can be asked in physics is: ''What fraction of states satisfying condition {{mvar|A}} also satisfy condition {{mvar|B}}?'' The answer to this is a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a [[conditional probability]], written as {{math|P(''B''{{!}}''A'')}}. In terms of path integration, since {{math|P(''B''{{!}}''A'') {{=}} {{sfrac|P(''A''∩''B'')&nbsp;|&nbsp;P(''A'')}}}}, this means\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}(B\\mid A) = \\frac\n{\\sum_{F \\subset A \\cap B}\\left| \\int\\mathcal{D}\\varphi O_\\text{in}[\\varphi]e^{i\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]}  F[\\varphi]\\right|^2}\n{\\sum_{F \\subset A} \\left|\\int\\mathcal{D}\\varphi O_\\text{in}[\\varphi] e^{i\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]} F[\\varphi]\\right|^2},</math>\n\nwhere the functional {{math|''O''<sub>in</sub>[''ϕ'']}} is the superposition of all incoming states that could lead to the states we are interested in. In particular, this could be a state corresponding to the state of the Universe just after the [[Big Bang]], although for actual calculation this can be simplified using heuristic methods. Since this expression is a quotient of path integrals, it is naturally normalised.\n\n=== Schwinger–Dyson equations ===\n{{Main|Schwinger–Dyson equation}}\n\nSince this formulation of quantum mechanics is analogous to classical action principle, one might expect that identities concerning the action in classical mechanics would have quantum counterparts derivable from a functional integral. This is often the case.\n\nIn the language of functional analysis, we can write the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s as\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]}{\\delta \\varphi} = 0</math>\n(the left-hand side is a [[functional derivative]]; the equation means that the action is stationary under small changes in the field configuration).  The quantum analogues of these equations are called the [[Schwinger–Dyson equation]]s.\n\nIf the [[functional measure]] {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''ϕ''}} turns out to be [[Translational symmetry|translationally invariant]] (we'll assume this for the rest of this article, although this does not hold for, let's say [[nonlinear sigma model]]s), and if we assume that after a [[Wick rotation]]\n\n:<math>e^{i\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]},</math>\n\nwhich now becomes\n:<math>e^{-H[\\varphi]}</math>\nfor some {{mvar|H}}, it goes to zero faster than a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of any [[polynomial]] for large values of {{mvar|φ}}, then we can [[integration by parts|integrate by parts]] (after a Wick rotation, followed by a Wick rotation back) to get the following Schwinger–Dyson equations for the expectation:\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\frac{\\delta F[\\varphi]}{\\delta \\varphi} \\right\\rangle = -i \\left\\langle F[\\varphi]\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{S}[\\varphi]}{\\delta\\varphi} \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nfor any polynomially-bounded functional {{mvar|F}}. In the [[deWitt notation]] this looks like<ref>[http://www.scholarpedia.org/Path_integral Jean Zinn-Justin (2009), ''Scholarpedia'' '''4'''(2):8674 ].</ref>\n:<math>\\left\\langle F_{,i} \\right\\rangle = -i \\left\\langle F \\mathcal{S}_{,i} \\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nThese equations are the analog of the [[on-shell]] EL equations. The time ordering is taken before the time derivatives inside the {{math|{{mathcal|S}}<sub>,''i''</sub>}}.\n\nIf {{mvar|J}} (called the [[source field]]) is an element of the [[dual space]] of the field configurations (which has at least an [[affine structure]] because of the assumption of the [[translational invariance]] for the functional measure), then the [[generating functional]] {{mvar|Z}} of the source fields is '''defined''' to be\n\n:<math>Z[J] = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\varphi e^{i\\left(\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi] + \\langle J,\\varphi \\rangle\\right)}.</math>\n\nNote that\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta^n Z}{\\delta J(x_1) \\cdots \\delta J(x_n)}[J] = i^n \\, Z[J] \\, \\left\\langle \\varphi(x_1)\\cdots \\varphi(x_n)\\right\\rangle_J,</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>Z^{,i_1\\cdots i_n}[J] = i^n Z[J] \\left \\langle \\varphi^{i_1}\\cdots \\varphi^{i_n}\\right\\rangle_J,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\langle F \\rangle_J = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\varphi F[\\varphi]e^{i\\left(\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi] + \\langle J,\\varphi \\rangle\\right)}}{\\int\\mathcal{D}\\varphi e^{i\\left(\\mathcal{S}[\\varphi] + \\langle J,\\varphi \\rangle\\right)}}.</math>\n\nBasically, if {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''φ'' ''e''<sup>''i''{{mathcal|S}}[''φ'']</sup>}} is viewed as a functional distribution (this shouldn't be taken too literally as an interpretation of [[Quantum field theory|QFT]], unlike its Wick-rotated [[statistical mechanics]] analogue, because we have [[time ordering]] complications here!), then {{math|{{angbr|''φ''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) ... ''φ''(''x<sub>n</sub>'')}}}} are its [[moment (mathematics)|moments]], and {{mvar|Z}} is its [[Fourier transform]].\n\nIf {{mvar|F}} is a functional of {{mvar|φ}}, then for an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] {{mvar|K}}, {{math|''F''[''K'']}} is defined to be the operator that substitutes {{mvar|K}} for {{mvar|φ}}. For example, if\n\n:<math>F[\\varphi] = \\frac{\\partial^{k_1}}{\\partial x_1^{k_1}}\\varphi(x_1)\\cdots \\frac{\\partial^{k_n}}{\\partial x_n^{k_n}}\\varphi(x_n),</math>\n\nand {{mvar|G}} is a functional of {{mvar|J}}, then\n\n:<math>F\\left[-i\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right] G[J] = (-i)^n \\frac{\\partial^{k_1}}{\\partial x_1^{k_1}}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J(x_1)} \\cdots \\frac{\\partial^{k_n}}{\\partial x_n^{k_n}}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J(x_n)} G[J].</math>\n\nThen, from the properties of the [[functional integral]]s\n\n:<math>\\left \\langle \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{S}}{\\delta \\varphi(x)} [\\varphi] + J(x)\\right\\rangle_J = 0</math>\n\nwe get the \"master\" Schwinger–Dyson equation:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{S}}{\\delta \\varphi(x)}\\left[-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right]Z[J] + J(x)Z[J] = 0,</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{S}_{,i}[-i\\partial]Z + J_i Z = 0.</math>\n\nIf the functional measure is not translationally invariant, it might be possible to express it as the product {{math|''M''[''φ''] {{mathcal|D}}''φ''}}, where {{mvar|M}} is a functional and {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''φ''}} is a translationally invariant measure. This is true, for example, for nonlinear sigma models where the [[target space]] is diffeomorphic to {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. However, if the [[target manifold]] is some topologically nontrivial space, the concept of a translation does not even make any sense.\n\nIn that case, we would have to replace the {{mathcal|S}} in this equation by another functional\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathcal{S}} = \\mathcal{S} - i\\ln M.</math>\n\nIf we expand this equation as a [[Taylor series]] about ''J'' {{=}} 0, we get the entire set of Schwinger–Dyson equations.\n\n== Localization ==\nThe path integrals are usually thought of as being the sum of all paths through an infinite space–time. However, in [[local quantum field theory]] we would restrict everything to lie within a finite ''causally complete'' region, for example inside a double light-cone. This gives a more mathematically precise and physically rigorous definition of quantum field theory.\n\n=== Ward–Takahashi identities ===\n{{main|Ward–Takahashi identity}}\n\nNow how about the [[on shell]] [[Noether's theorem]] for the classical case? Does it have a quantum analog as well? Yes, but with a caveat. The functional measure would have to be invariant under the one parameter group of symmetry transformation as well.\n\nLet's just assume for simplicity here that the symmetry in question is local (not local in the sense of a [[gauge symmetry]], but in the sense that the transformed value of the field at any given point under an infinitesimal transformation would only depend on the field configuration over an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point in question). Let's also assume that the action is local in the sense that it is the integral over spacetime of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], and that\n:<math>Q[\\mathcal{L}(x)]=\\partial_\\mu f^\\mu (x)</math>\nfor some function {{mvar|f}} where {{mvar|f}} only depends locally on {{mvar|φ}} (and possibly the spacetime position).\n\nIf we don't assume any special boundary conditions, this would not be a \"true\" symmetry in the true sense of the term in general unless {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}} or something. Here, {{mvar|Q}} is a [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] which generates the one parameter group in question. We could have [[antiderivation]]s as well, such as [[BRST quantization|BRST]] and [[supersymmetry]].\n\nLet's also assume\n:<math>\\int \\mathcal{D}\\varphi\\, Q[F][\\varphi]=0</math>\nfor any polynomially-bounded functional {{mvar|F}}. This property is called the invariance of the measure. And this does not hold in general. See [[anomaly (physics)]] for more details.\n\nThen,\n:<math>\\int \\mathcal{D}\\varphi\\, Q\\left[F e^{iS}\\right][\\varphi]=0,</math>\n\nwhich implies\n:<math>\\langle Q[F]\\rangle +i\\left\\langle F\\int_{\\partial V} f^\\mu\\, ds_\\mu\\right\\rangle=0</math>\n\nwhere the integral is over the boundary. This is the quantum analog of Noether's theorem.\n\nNow, let's assume even further that {{mvar|Q}} is a local integral\n\n:<math>Q=\\int d^dx\\, q(x)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>q(x)[\\varphi(y)] = \\delta^{(d)}(X-y)Q[\\varphi(y)] \\,</math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math>q(x)[S]=\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu (x) \\,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>j^{\\mu}(x)=f^\\mu(x)-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\partial_\\mu \\varphi)}\\mathcal{L}(x) Q[\\varphi] \\,</math>\n\n(this is assuming the Lagrangian only depends on {{mvar|φ}} and its first partial derivatives! More general Lagrangians would require a modification to this definition!). Note that we're NOT insisting that {{math|''q''(''x'')}} is the generator of a symmetry (i.e. we are ''not'' insisting upon the [[gauge principle]]), but just that {{mvar|Q}} is.  And we also assume the even stronger assumption that the functional measure is locally invariant:\n\n:<math>\\int \\mathcal{D}\\varphi\\, q(x)[F][\\varphi]=0.</math>\n\nThen, we would have\n\n:<math>\\langle q(x)[F] \\rangle +i\\langle F q(x)[S]\\rangle=\\langle q(x)[F]\\rangle +i\\left\\langle F\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu(x)\\right\\rangle=0.</math>\n\nAlternatively,\n\n:<math>q(x)[S]\\left[-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\\varphi(x)]\\left[-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right]Z[J]=\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu(x)\\left[-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\\varphi(x)]\\left[-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right]Z[J]=0.</math>\n\nThe above two equations are the '''Ward–Takahashi identities'''.\n\nNow for the case where {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}}, we can forget about all the boundary conditions and locality assumptions. We'd simply have\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle Q[F]\\right\\rangle =0.</math>\n\nAlternatively,\n\n:<math>\\int d^dx\\, J(x)Q[\\varphi(x)]\\left[-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta J}\\right]Z[J]=0.</math>\n\n== The need for regulators and renormalization ==\n\nPath integrals as they are defined here require the introduction of [[Regularization (physics)|regulators]]. Changing the scale of the regulator leads to the [[renormalization group]]. In fact, renormalization is the major obstruction to making path integrals well-defined.\n\n== The path integral in quantum-mechanical interpretation ==\n\nIn one [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the \"sum over histories\" interpretation, the path integral is taken to be fundamental, and reality is viewed as a single indistinguishable \"class\" of paths that all share the same events.  For this interpretation, it is crucial to understand what exactly an event is. The sum-over-histories method gives identical results to canonical quantum mechanics, and Sinha and Sorkin<ref>{{harvnb|Sinha|Sorkin|1991}}</ref> claim the interpretation explains the [[Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox]] without resorting to [[action at a distance|nonlocality]].\n\nSome{{who|date=August 2014}} advocates of interpretations of quantum mechanics emphasizing [[decoherence]] have attempted to make more rigorous the notion of extracting a classical-like \"coarse-grained\" history from the space of all possible histories.\n\n== Quantum gravity ==\nWhereas in quantum mechanics the path integral formulation is fully equivalent to other formulations, it may be that it can be extended to quantum gravity, which would make it different from the [[Hilbert space]] model. Feynman had some success in this direction, and his work has been extended by [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] and others.<ref>{{harvnb|Gell-Mann|1993}}</ref> Approaches that use this method include [[causal dynamical triangulation]]s and [[spinfoam]] models.\n\n== Quantum tunneling ==\n[[Quantum tunnelling]] can be modeled by using the path integral formation to determine the action of the trajectory through a potential barrier. Using the [[WKB approximation]], the tunneling rate ({{math|Γ}}) can be determined to be of the form\n\n:<math> \\Gamma = A_\\mathrm{o} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{S_\\mathrm{eff}}{\\hbar}\\right) </math>\n\nwith the effective action {{math|''S''<sub>eff</sub>}} and pre-exponential factor {{math|''A''<sub>o</sub>}}. This form is specifically useful in a [[dissipative system]], in which the systems and surroundings must be modeled together. Using the [[Langevin equation]] to model [[Brownian motion]], the path integral formation can be used to determine an effective action and pre-exponential model to see the effect of dissipation on tunnelling.<ref>{{harvnb|Caldeira|Leggett|1983}}</ref> From this model, tunneling rates of macroscopic systems (at finite temperatures) can be predicted.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Theoretical and experimental justification for the Schrödinger equation]]\n* [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange]]\n* [[Feynman checkerboard]]\n* [[Berezin integral]]\n* [[Propagator]]s\n* [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]]\n* [[Feynman–Kac formula]]\n\n== Remarks ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ahmad|first= Ishfaq |authorlink=Ishfaq Ahmad |title=Mathematical Integrals in Quantum Nature |series=The Nucleus |year=1971 |pages=189–209}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Albeverio|first1= S.|last2=Hoegh-Krohn.|first2=R.|last3=Mazzucchi|first3=S|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Mathematical Theory of Feynman Path Integral |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics 523 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008 |isbn=9783540769569}}\n*{{cite journal|ref=harv|first=A.

      "title": "Pettis integral",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pettis_integral",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Pettis integral''' or '''Gelfand&ndash;Pettis integral''', named after [[Israel Gelfand|Israel M. Gelfand]] and [[Billy James Pettis]], extends the definition of the [[Lebesgue integral]] to vector-valued functions on a [[measure space]], by exploiting [[dual space|duality]]. The integral was introduced by Gelfand for the case when the measure space is an interval with [[Lebesgue measure]]. The integral is also called the '''weak integral''' in contrast to the [[Bochner integral]], which is the strong integral.\n\n==Definition==\n\nLet <math>f: X\\to V,</math> where <math>(X,\\Sigma,\\mu)</math> is a measure space and <math>V</math> is a [[topological vector space]]. Suppose that <math>V</math> admits a dual space <math>V^*</math> that separates points, e.g. <math>V</math> is a Banach space or (more generally) is a locally-convex Hausdorff vector space. We write evaluation of a functional as duality pairing: <math>\\langle \\varphi, x \\rangle = \\varphi[x]</math>.\n\nWe say that <math>f</math> is Pettis integrable if <math>\\varphi\\circ f \\in L^1(X,\\Sigma,\\mu)</math> for all <math>\\varphi\\in V^\\ast</math> and there exists a vector <math>e \\in V</math> so that:\n\n:<math>\\forall \\varphi \\in V^*: \\qquad \\langle \\varphi, e\\rangle = \\int_X \\langle \\varphi, f(x) \\rangle \\, d\\mu(x).</math>\n\nIn this case, we call <math>e</math> the Pettis integral of <math>f</math>. Common notations for the Pettis integral <math>e</math> include \n\n:<math>\\int_X f d\\mu, \\qquad \\int_X f(x) \\, d\\mu(x), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu[f].</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* An immediate consequence of the definition is that Pettis integrals are compatible with continuous, linear operators: If <math>\\Phi:V_1\\to V_2</math> is and linear and continuous and <math>f:X\\to V_1</math> is Pettis integrable, then <math>\\Phi\\circ f</math> is Pettis integrable as well and: \n::<math>\\int_X \\Phi(f(x))\\,d\\mu(x) = \\Phi \\left (\\int_X f(x)\\,d\\mu(x) \\right ).</math>\n\n* The standard estimate \n::<math> \\left |\\int_X f(x)\\,d\\mu(x) \\right |\\leqslant \\int_X |f(x)|\\,d\\mu(x)</math> \n:for real- and complex-valued functions generalises to Pettis integrals in the following sense: For all continuous seminorms <math>p:V\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> and all Pettis integrable <math>f:X\\to V,</math> \n::<math>p \\left (\\int_X f(x)\\,d\\mu(x) \\right ) \\leqslant  \\underline{\\int_X} p(f(x)) \\,d\\mu(x)</math> \n:holds. The right hand side is the lower Lebesgue integral of a <math>[0,\\infty]</math>-valued function, i.e. \n::<math>\\underline{\\int_X} g \\,d\\mu := \\sup \\left \\{ \\left. \\int_X h\\,d\\mu \\right | h:X\\to[0,\\infty] \\text{ is measurable and } 0\\leqslant h\\leqslant g \\right \\}.</math>\n:Taking a lower Lebesgue integral is necessary because the integrand <math>p\\circ f</math> may not be measurable. This follows from the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] because for every vector <math>v\\in V</math> there must be a continuous functional <math>\\varphi\\in V^\\ast</math> such that <math>\\lambda(v)=p(v)</math> and <math>\\forall w\\in V: |\\lambda(w)|\\leq p(w)</math>. Applying this to <math>v:=\\int_X f\\,d\\mu</math> it gives the result.\n\n===Mean value theorem===\nAn important property is that the Pettis integral with respect to a finite measure is contained in the closure of the convex hull of the values scaled by the measure of the integration domain:\n\n:<math>\\mu(A)<\\infty \\implies \\int_A f\\,d\\mu \\in \\mu(A) \\cdot \\overline{co(f(A))}</math>\n\nThis is a consequence of the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] and generalises the [[Mean_value_theorem#Mean_value_theorems_for_definite_integrals|mean value theorem for integrals of real-valued functions]]: If <math>V=\\R,</math> then closed convex sets are simply intervals and for <math>f:X\\to[a,b],</math> the inequalities \n\n:<math>\\mu(A) a \\leqslant \\int_A f\\,d\\mu \\leqslant \\mu(A)b</math> \n\nhold.\n\n===Existence===\n* If <math>V = \\R^n</math> is finite-dimensional then <math>f</math> is Pettis integrable if and only if each of <math>f</math>'s coordinates is Lebesgue integrable.\n\n* If <math>f</math> is Pettis integrable and <math>A\\in\\Sigma</math> is a measurable subset of <math>X</math>, then <math>f_{|A}: A\\to V</math> and <math>f\\cdot 1_A: X\\to V</math> are also Pettis integrable and \n::<math>\\int_A f_{|A} \\,d\\mu = \\int_X f\\cdot 1_A \\,d\\mu.</math>\n\n* If <math>X</math> is a topological space, <math>\\Sigma=\\mathfrak{B}_X</math> its [[Borel set|Borel-<math>\\sigma</math>-algebra]], <math>\\mu</math> a [[Borel measure]] that assigns finite values to compact subsets, <math>V</math> is [[quasi-complete space|quasi-complete]] (i.e. if every ''bounded'' [[Cauchy net]] converges) and if <math>f</math> is continuous with compact support, then <math>f</math> is Pettis integrable.\n\n* More generally: If <math>f</math> is weakly measurable and there exists a compact, convex <math>C\\subseteq V</math> and a null set <math>N\\subseteq X</math> such that <math>f(X\\setminus N)\\subseteq C</math>, then <math>f</math> is Pettis-integrable.\n\n==Law of large numbers for Pettis-integrable random variables==\n\nLet <math>(\\Omega, \\mathcal F, \\operatorname P)</math> be a probability space, and let <math>V</math> be a topological vector space with a dual space that separates points. Let <math>v_n \\colon \\Omega \\to V</math> be a sequence of Pettis-integrable random variables, and write <math>\\operatorname E[v_n]</math> for the Pettis integral of <math>v_n</math> (over <math>X</math>). Note that <math>\\operatorname E[v_n]</math> is a (non-random) vector in <math>V</math>, and is not a scalar value.\n\nLet \n\n:<math>\\bar v_N := \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N v_n</math> \n\ndenote the sample average. By linearity, <math>\\bar v_N</math> is Pettis integrable, and \n\n:<math>\\operatorname E[\\bar v_N] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\operatorname E[v_n] \\in V.</math>\n\nSuppose that the partial sums \n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\operatorname E[\\bar v_n]</math> \n\nconverge absolutely in the topology of <math>V</math>, in the sense that all rearrangements of the sum converge to a single vector <math>\\lambda \\in V</math>. The weak law of large numbers implies that <math>\\langle \\varphi, \\operatorname E[\\bar v_N] - \\lambda \\rangle \\to 0</math> for every functional <math>\\varphi \\in V^*</math>. Consequently, <math>\\operatorname E[\\bar v_N] \\to \\lambda</math> in the [[weak topology]] on <math>X</math>.\n\nWithout further assumptions, it is possible that <math>\\operatorname E[\\bar v_N]</math> does not converge to <math>\\lambda</math>.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} To get strong convergence, more assumptions are necessary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vector measure]]\n* [[Weakly measurable function]]\n\n==References==\n* James K.

(In contrast, the corresponding quantity would not be unambiguously defined using the first type of approximation.)\n\nThis generalizes to [[List_of_mathematical_jargon#Descriptive_informalities|arbitrary]] [[Measure_space|measure spaces]] readily.

Analogous to [[Lebesgue_integration|the theory of Lebesgue (classical) integrals]], the [[Product_integral#Type I: Volterra integral|Volterra product integral]] of any product-integrable function <math>f</math> can be written as the limit of an increasing [[sequence]] of Volterra product integrals of product-integrable simple functions.\n\nTaking [[logarithm]]s of both sides of the above definition, one gets that for any product-integrable simple function <math>f</math>:\n\n: <math>\\ln \\left(\\prod_X \\big(1 + f(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big) \\right) = \\ln \\left( \\prod_{k=0}^{m-1} \\exp\\big(a_k \\mu(A_k)\\big) \\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} a_k \\mu(A_k) = \\int_X f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\iff</math>\n: <math>\\prod_X \\big(1 + f(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big) = \\exp \\left( \\int_X f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right),</math>\n\nwhere we used [[Simple_function#Integration_of_simple_functions|the definition of integral for simple functions]].

The Annals of Statistics 18, no. 4 (December 1990): 1501—555, p. 1503. </ref>, which can be shown using the above property. More specifically, given a product-integrable function <math>f</math> one can define a set function <math>{\\cal V}_f</math> by defining, for every measurable set <math>B \\subseteq X </math>, \n\n: <math>{\\cal V}_f(B) \\overset{def}{=} \\prod_B \\big(1 + f(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big) \\overset{def}{=} \\prod_X \\big(1 + (f \\cdot I_B)(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big),</math>\n\nwhere <math>I_B(x)</math> denotes the [[indicator function]] of <math>B</math>. Then for any two [[Disjoint_sets|''disjoint'']] measurable sets <math>B_1, B_2</math> one has\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n {\\cal V}_f(B_1 \\sqcup B_2) &= \\prod_{B_1 \\sqcup B_2} \\big(1 + f(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big) \\\\\n &= \\exp\\left( \\int_{B_1 \\sqcup B_2} f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right) \\\\\n &= \\exp\\left( \\int_{B_1} f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) + \\int_{B_2} f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right) \\\\\n &= \\exp\\left( \\int_{B_1} f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right) \\exp\\left( \\int_{B_2} f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right) \\\\\n &= \\prod_{B_1} (1 + f(x)d \\mu(x)) \\prod_{ B_2} (1 + f(x) \\,d\\mu(x)) \\\\\n &= {\\cal V}_f(B_1 ) {\\cal V}_f(B_2).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis property can be contrasted with [[Measure_(mathematics)|measures]], which are [[Sigma_additivity|''additive'']] [[Set_function|set functions]].\n\nHowever the [[Product_integral#Type I: Volterra integral|Volterra product integral]] is ''not'' [[Multiplicative_function|multiplicative]] as a [[Functional_(mathematics)|functional]]. Given two product-integrable functions <math>f , g</math>, and a measurable set <math>A</math>, it is generally the case that\n\n: <math>\\prod_A \\big(1 + (fg)(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big) \\neq \\prod_A \\big(1 + f(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big) \\prod_A \\big(1 + g(x) \\,d\\mu(x)\\big).</math>\n\n===Type II: geometric integral===\n\nIf <math>X</math> is a [[measure space]] with [[Measure_(mathematics)|measure]] <math>\\mu</math>, then for any product-integrable [[simple function]] <math>f(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k I_{A_k}(x)</math> (i.e. a [[conical combination]] of the [[Indicator_function|indicator functions]] for some [[Disjoint_sets|disjoint]] [[Measure_(mathematics)#Definition|measurable sets]] <math>A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{m-1} \\subseteq X</math>), its [[Product_integral#Type II: geometric integral|type II product integral]] is defined to be\n\n: <math>\\prod_X f(x)^{d\\mu(x)} \\overset{def}{=} \\prod_{k=0}^{m-1} a_k^{\\mu(A_k)}.</math>\n\nThis can be seen to generalize the definition given above.\n\nTaking [[logarithm]]s of both sides, we see that for any product-integrable [[simple function]] <math>f</math>:\n\n: <math>\\ln \\left( \\prod_X f(x)^{d\\mu(x)} \\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\ln(a_k) \\mu(A_k) = \\int_X \\ln f(x) \\,d\\mu (x) \\iff \\prod_X f(x)^{d\\mu(x)} = \\exp\\left( \\int_X \\ln f(x) \\,d\\mu (x) \\right),</math>\n\nwhere we have used the [[Simple_function#Integration_of_simple_functions|definition of the Lebesgue integral for simple functions]]. This observation, analogous to the one already made [[Product_integral#Type II: geometric integral|above]], allows one to entirely reduce the \"[[Lebesgue_integration#Measure_theory|Lebesgue theory]] of [[Product_integral#Type II: geometric integral|geometric integrals]]\" to the [[Lebesgue_integration|Lebesgue theory of (classical) integrals]]. In other words, because [[Continuous_function|continuous functions]] like <math>\\exp</math> and <math>\\ln</math> [[Continuous_function#Definition_in_terms_of_limits_of_sequences|can be interchanged with limits]], and the product integral of any product-integrable function <math>f</math> is equal to the [[Limit_(mathematics)|limit]] of some increasing [[sequence]] of product integrals of [[Simple_function|simple functions]], it follows that the relationship\n\n: <math>\\prod_X f(x)^{d\\mu(x)} = \\exp\\left( \\int_X \\ln f(x) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right)</math>\n\nholds generally for ''any'' product-integrable <math>f</math>. This generalizes the property of [[Product_integral#Type II: geometric integral|geometric integrals]] mentioned above.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of derivatives and integrals in alternative calculi]]\n*[[Indefinite product]]\n*[[Multiplicative calculus]]\n*[[Logarithmic derivative]]\n*[[Ordered exponential]]\n*[[Fractal derivative]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n\n* W.

Rather than integrating by substitution, yielding the Gamma function (which was not yet known), Bernoulli used [[integration by parts]] to iteratively compute these terms.\n\nThe integration by parts proceeds as follows, varying the two exponents independently to obtain a recursion. An indefinite integral is computed initially, omitting the [[constant of integration]] <math>+ C</math> both because this was done historically, and because it drops out when computing the definite integral. One may integrate <math>\\int x^m (\\log x)^n\\,dx</math> by taking {{nowrap|1=''u'' = (log ''x'')<sup>''n''</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''dv'' = ''x''<sup>''m''</sup> ''dx''}}, which yields:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\int x^m (\\log x)^n\\,dx\n& = \\frac{x^{m+1}(\\log x)^n}{m+1} - \\frac{n}{m+1}\\int x^{m+1} \\frac{(\\log x)^{n-1}}{x}\\,dx  \\qquad\\text{(for }m\\neq -1\\text{)}\\\\\n& = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1}(\\log x)^n - \\frac{n}{m+1}\\int x^m (\\log x)^{n-1}\\,dx  \\qquad\\text{(for }m\\neq -1\\text{)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n(also in the [[list of integrals of logarithmic functions]]). This reduces the power on the logarithm in the integrand by 1 (from <math>n</math> to <math>n-1</math>) and thus one can compute the integral [[mathematical induction|inductively]], as\n: <math>\n\\int x^m (\\log x)^n\\,dx\n= \\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1}\n \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \\frac{(n)_i}{(m+1)^i} (\\log x)^{n-i}</math>\n\nwhere (''n'')<sub>&nbsp;''i''</sub> denotes the [[falling factorial]]; there is a finite sum because the induction stops at 0, since ''n'' is an integer.\n\nIn this case ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'', and they are integers, so\n\n:<math>\\int x^n (\\log x)^n\\,dx\n= \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\n \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \\frac{(n)_i}{(n+1)^i} (\\log x)^{n-i}.</math>\n\nIntegrating from 0 to 1, all the terms vanish except the last term at 1,<ref group=\"note\">All the terms vanish at 0 because <math>\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x^m (\\log x)^n  =  0</math> by [[l'Hôpital's rule]] (Bernoulli omitted this technicality), and all but the last term vanish at 1 since {{nowrap|1=log 1 = 0}}.</ref> which yields:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n (\\log x)^n}{n!}\\,dx\n= \\frac{1}{n!}\\frac{1^{n+1}}{n+1}\n (-1)^n \\frac{(n)_n}{(n+1)^n} = (-1)^n (n+1)^{-(n+1)}.</math>\n\nFrom a modern point of view, this is ([[up to]] a scale factor) equivalent to computing Euler's integral identity <math>\\Gamma(n+1) = n!</math> for the Gamma function on a different domain (corresponding to changing variables by substitution), as Euler's identity itself can also be computed via an analogous integration by parts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Series (mathematics)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Formula===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Johann Bernoulli, 1697, collected in Johannis Bernoulli, ''Opera omnia,'' vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;376–381\n* {{citation|authorlink1=Jonathan Borwein |first1=Jonathan |last1=Borwein |authorlink2=David H.

(Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.)\n\nThe traditional approach involves algebra and application of the Pythagorean theorem. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: First the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, \"sweeping out\" the ring as it goes.\n\nNow if all the (constant-length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)&mdash;and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk.\n\nMamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, so long as it is given that the tangent length is constant, the two starting curves need not be circular&mdash;a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields '''Mamikon's theorem''':\n:''The area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve.''\n\n==Applications==\n[[Tom M. Apostol|Tom Apostol]] has produced a very readable introduction to the subject.<ref>[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mamikon/VisualCalc.html A VISUAL Approach to CALCULUS problems] An introduction by Tom Apostol</ref> In it he shows that the problems of finding the area of a [[cycloid]] and [[tractrix]] can be solved by very young students. \"Moreover, the new method also solves some problems ''unsolvable by calculus, and allows many incredible generalizations yet unknown in mathematics''.\" He also mentions that combining Mamikon's method with the geometric solution yields a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Solutions to many other problems appear on Mamikon's Visual Calculus site.\n\n===Area of a cycloid===\n[[File:Mamikon Cycloid.svg|thumb|right|300px|Finding the area of a [[cycloid]] using Mamikon's theorem.]]\n\nThe area of a [[cycloid]] can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius ''r'' then this circle also has radius ''r'' and area π''r''<sup>2</sup>. The area of the rectangle is <math>2r \\times 2 \\pi r = 4 \\pi r ^2</math>. Therefore the area of the cycloid is <math>3\\pi r^2</math>: it is 3 times the area of the generating circle.\n\nThe tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cavalieri's principle]]\n* [[Hodograph]] – This is a related construct that maps the velocity of a point using a polar diagram.\n* [[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]\n* [[Pappus's centroid theorem]]\n* [[Planimeter]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mamikon/ ProjMath Mamikon]\n* [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProofwithoutWords.html Proof without Words] from [[MathWorld]]\n\n[[Category:Calculus]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Integrals]]\n[[Category:Proof without words]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], and more precisely in  [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], the '''Wallis integrals''' constitute a family of [[integral]]s introduced by [[John Wallis]].\n\n== Definition, basic properties ==\nThe ''Wallis integrals'' are the terms of the sequence <math>(W_n)_{n \\geq 0}</math> defined by\n:<math> W_n = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^n x \\,dx, </math>\nor equivalently (by the substitution <math>x = \\tfrac{\\pi}{2} - t</math>),\n:<math> W_n = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos^n x \\,dx.</math>\nThe first few terms of this sequence are:\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\" width=\"50%\"\n |-\n | align=\"center\" | <math>W_0</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_1</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_2</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_3</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_4</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_5</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_6</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_7</math>\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_8</math>\n | align=\"center\" | ...\n | align=\"center\"| <math>W_n</math>\n |-\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>1</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{\\pi}{4}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{2}{3}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{3\\pi}{16}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{8}{15}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{5\\pi}{32}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{16}{35}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{35\\pi}{256}</math>\n | align=\"center\" | ...\n | align=\"center\" | <math>\\frac{n-1}{n} W_{n-2}</math>\n |}\n\nThe sequence <math>(W_n)</math> is decreasing and has positive terms.  In fact, for all <math>n \\geq 0:</math>\n*<math>W_n > 0,</math> because it is an integral of a non-negative continuous function which is not identically zero;\n*<math>W_n - W_{n+1} = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^n x\\,dx - \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^{n+1} x\\,dx = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} (\\sin^n x)(1 - \\sin x )\\,dx > 0,</math> again because the last integral is of a non-negative function.\nSince the sequence <math>(W_n)</math> is decreasing and bounded below by 0, it converges to a non-negative limit. Indeed, the limit is zero (see below).\n\n==Recurrence relation==\nBy means of [[integration by parts]], a [[recurrence relation]] can be obtained.  Using the identity <math>\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x</math>, we have for all <math>n \\geq 2</math>,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^n x \\,dx &= \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} (\\sin^{n-2} x) (1-\\cos^2 x) \\,dx \\\\\n  &= \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^{n-2} x \\,dx - \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^{n-2} x \\cos^2 x \\,dx.  \\qquad\\text{Equation (1)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIntegrating the second integral by parts, with:\n:* <math>u'(x)=\\cos (x) \\sin^{n-2}(x)</math>, whose [[anti-derivative]] is <math>u(x) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sin^{n-1}(x)</math>\n:* <math>v(x)=\\cos (x)</math>, whose [[derivative]] is <math> v'(x) =  - \\sin(x)</math>\nwe have:\n:<math>\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^{n-2} x \\cos^2 x \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{\\sin^{n-1} x}{n-1} \\cos x \\right]_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^{n-1} x \\sin x \\,dx = 0 + \\frac{1}{n-1} W_n. </math>\n\nSubstituting this result into equation (1) gives\n:<math>W_n = W_{n-2} - \\frac{1}{n-1} W_n,</math>\nand thus\n:<math>W_n = \\frac{n-1}{n} W_{n-2},</math>\nfor all <math>n \\geq 2.</math>\n\nThis is a recurrence relation giving <math>W_n</math> in terms of <math>W_{n-2}</math>.  This, together with the values of <math>W_0</math> and  <math>W_1,</math> give us two sets of formulae for the terms in the sequence <math>(W_n)</math>, depending on whether <math>n</math> is odd or even:\n\n* <math>W_{2p}=\\frac{2p-1}{2p} \\cdot \\frac{2p-3}{2p-2} \\cdots \\frac{1}{2} W_0 = \\frac{(2p-1)!!}{(2p)!!} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{(2p)!}{2^{2p} (p!)^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2},</math>\n* <math>W_{2p+1}=\\frac{2p}{2p+1} \\cdot \\frac{2p-2}{2p-1} \\cdots \\frac{2}{3} W_1 = \\frac{(2p)!!}{(2p+1)!!} = \\frac{2^{2p}(p!)^2}{(2p+1)!}.</math>\n\n== Another relation to evaluate the Wallis' integrals ==\nWallis's integrals can be evaluated by using [[Euler integral]]s:\n#''Euler [[integral]] of the first kind'': the [[Beta function]]: \n#:<math>\\Beta(x,y)= \\int_0^1 t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1}\\,dt =\\frac{\\Gamma(x)\\Gamma(y)}{\\Gamma(x+y)}</math> for {{math|Re(''x''), Re(''y'') > 0}}\n#''Euler integral of the second kind'': the [[Gamma function]]: \n#:<math>\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty  t^{z-1} e^{-t}\\,dt</math> for {{math|Re(''z'') > 0}}.\nIf we make the following substitution inside the Beta function:\n<math>\\quad \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}  t = \\sin^2 u \\\\ 1-t = \\cos^2 u \\\\ dt = 2\\sin u\\cos u,\\,du\\end{matrix}\\right.</math><br>\nwe obtain:\n:<math>\\Beta(a,b)= 2\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin^{2a-1} u\\cos^{2b-1} u\\,du,</math>\nso this gives us the following relation to evaluate the Wallis integrals:\n:<math> W_n = \\frac{1}{2} \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)}{2\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{n}{2}+1\\right)}.</math>\n\nSo, for odd <math>n</math>, writing <math>n = 2p+1</math>, we have:\n:<math>\nW_{2p+1}\n    =             \\frac{\\Gamma \\left( p+1 \\right)\n                        \\Gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n                  }{\n                    2 \\, \\Gamma \\left( p+1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n                  }\n    =             \\frac{p!\n                        \\Gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n                  }{\n                    (2p+1) \\, \\Gamma \\left( p + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n                  }\n    =             \\frac{2^p \\; p!

      "text": "[[Image:Integral as region under curve.svg|thumb|right|Numerical integration is used to calculate a numerical approximation for the value <math>S</math>, the area under the curve defined by <math>f(x)</math>.]]\nIn [[analysis]], '''numerical integration''' comprises a broad family of [[algorithm]]s for calculating the numerical value of a definite [[integral]], and by extension, the term is also sometimes used to describe the [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical solution of differential equations]]. This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term '''numerical quadrature''' (often abbreviated to [[Quadrature (mathematics)|''quadrature'']]) is more or less a synonym for ''numerical integration'', especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as '''cubature''';<ref>{{MathWorld | urlname=Cubature | title=Cubature }}</ref> others take ''quadrature'' to include higher-dimensional integration.\n\nThe basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx</math>\n\nto a given degree of accuracy. If {{math|''f(x)''}} is a smooth function integrated over a small number of dimensions, and the domain of integration is bounded, there are many methods for approximating the integral to the desired precision.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Quadrature (mathematics)}}\nThe term \"numerical integration\" first appears in 1915 in the publication ''A Course in Interpolation and Numeric Integration for the Mathematical Laboratory'' by [[David Gibb (mathematician)|David Gibb]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/q.html|title=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (Q)|author=|date=|website=jeff560.tripod.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Quadrature''' is a historical mathematical term that means calculating area. Quadrature problems have served as one of the main sources of [[mathematical analysis]]. [[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of Ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood calculation of [[area]] as the process of constructing geometrically a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area (''squaring''). That is why the process was named '''quadrature'''. For example, a [[quadrature of the circle]], [[Lune of Hippocrates]], [[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]. This construction must be performed only by means of [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].\n\nThe ancient Babylonians used the [[trapezoidal rule]] to integrate the motion of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] along the [[ecliptic]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mathieu Ossendrijver|title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter's position from the area under a time-velocity graph|journal=Science|date=Jan 29, 2016|doi=10.1126/science.aad8085|volume=351|issue=6272|pages=482–484|pmid=26823423|bibcode=2016Sci...351..482O}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|Antique method to find the [[Geometric mean]]]]\nFor a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side <math>x =\\sqrt {ab}</math> (the [[Geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following fact: if we draw the circle with the sum of ''a'' and ''b'' as the diameter, then the height BH (from a point of their connection to crossing with a circle) equals their geometric mean. The similar geometrical construction solves a problem of a quadrature for a parallelogram and a triangle.\n\n[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|<center>The area of a segment of a parabola</center>]]\nProblems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The [[quadrature of the circle]] with compass and straightedge had been proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example the [[Lune of Hippocrates]]) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of a sphere surface and a [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|parabola segment]] done by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of the antique analysis.\n* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to quadruple the area of a [[great circle]] of this sphere.\n* The area of a segment of the [[parabola]] cut from it by a straight line is 4/3 the area of the triangle inscribed in this segment.\nFor the proof of the results Archimedes used the [[Method of exhaustion]] of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].\n\nIn medieval Europe the quadrature meant calculation of area by any method. More often the [[Method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous, but more simple and powerful. With its help [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647), and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.\n\n[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method: he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) series that we now call the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of some [[Solid of revolution|Solids of revolution]].\n\nThe quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance.\n\nWith the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term '''quadrature''' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase \"''computation of a univariate definite integral''\" is more common.\n\n==Reasons for numerical integration==\n\nThere are several reasons for carrying out numerical integration.\n{{ordered list\n|1= The integrand ''f''(''x'') may be known only at certain points, such as obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Some [[embedded systems]] and other computer applications may need numerical integration for this reason.\n\n|2=  A formula for the integrand may be known, but it may be difficult or impossible to find an [[antiderivative]] that is an [[elementary function]]. An example of such an integrand is ''f''(''x'') = exp(−''x''<sup>''2''</sup>), the antiderivative of which (the [[error function]], times a constant) cannot be written in [[elementary form]].\n\n|3= It may be possible to find an antiderivative symbolically, but it may be easier to compute a numerical approximation than to compute the antiderivative. That may be the case if the antiderivative is given as an infinite series or product, or if its evaluation requires a [[special function]] that is not available.\n}}\n\n==Methods for one-dimensional integrals==\n\nNumerical integration methods can generally be described as combining evaluations of the integrand to get an approximation to the integral. The integrand is evaluated at a finite set of points called '''integration points''' and a weighted sum of these values is used to approximate the integral. The integration points and weights depend on the specific method used and the accuracy required from the approximation.\n\nAn important part of the analysis of any numerical integration method is to study the behavior of the approximation error as a function of the number of integrand evaluations.\nA method that yields a small error for a small number of evaluations is usually considered superior.\nReducing the number of evaluations of the integrand reduces the number of arithmetic operations involved,\nand therefore reduces the total [[round-off error]].\nAlso,\neach evaluation takes time, and the integrand may be arbitrarily complicated.\n\nA 'brute force' kind of numerical integration can be done, if the integrand is reasonably well-behaved (i.e. [[piecewise]] [[continuous function|continuous]] and of [[bounded variation]]), by evaluating the integrand with very small increments.\n\n===Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions===\nA large class of quadrature rules can be derived by constructing  [[interpolation|interpolating]] functions that are easy to integrate. Typically these interpolating functions are [[polynomial]]s.  In practice, since polynomials of very high degree tend to oscillate wildly, only polynomials of low degree are used, typically linear and quadratic.\n\n[[Image:Integration rectangle.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the rectangle rule.]]\nThe simplest method of this type is to let the interpolating function be a constant function (a polynomial of degree zero) that passes through the point <math> \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, f \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)\\right) </math>. This is called the ''midpoint rule'' or ''[[rectangle method|rectangle rule]]''\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx (b-a) f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right).</math>\n\n[[Image:Integration trapezoid.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the trapezoidal rule.]]\nThe interpolating function may be a straight line (an [[affine function]], i.e. a polynomial of degree 1)\npassing through the points <math> \\left( a, f(a)\\right) </math> and <math> \\left( b, f(b)\\right) </math>.\nThis is called the ''[[trapezoidal rule]]''\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx (b-a) \\left(\\frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2}\\right).</math>\n\n[[Image:Integration simpson.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of Simpson's rule.]]\nFor either one of these rules, we can make a more accurate approximation by breaking  up the interval <math> [a,b] </math> into some number <math> n </math> of subintervals, computing an approximation for each subinterval, then adding up all the results. This is called a ''composite rule'', ''extended rule'', or ''iterated rule''. For example, the composite trapezoidal rule can be stated as\n\n:<math>\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx \n\\frac{b-a}{n} \\left( {f(a) \\over 2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left( f \\left( a+k \\frac{b-a}{n} \\right) \\right) + {f(b) \\over 2} \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere the subintervals have the form <math> [a+k h,a+ (k+1)h] \\subset [a,b], </math> with <math>h = \\frac{b-a}{n}</math> and <math>k = 0,\\ldots,n-1. </math> Here we used subintervals of the same length <math> h </math> but one could also use intervals of varying length <math> \\left( h_k \\right)_k </math>.\n\nInterpolation with polynomials evaluated at equally spaced points in <math> [a,b] </math> yields the [[Newton–Cotes formulas]], of which the rectangle rule and the trapezoidal rule are examples. [[Simpson's rule]], which is based on a polynomial of order 2, is also a Newton–Cotes formula.\n\nQuadrature rules with equally spaced points have the very convenient property of ''nesting''.  The corresponding rule with each interval subdivided includes all the current points, so those integrand values can be re-used.\n\nIf we allow the intervals between interpolation points to vary, we find another group of quadrature formulas, such as the [[Gaussian quadrature]] formulas. A Gaussian  quadrature rule is typically more accurate than a Newton–Cotes rule, which requires the same number of function evaluations, if the integrand is [[Smooth function|smooth]] (i.e., if it is sufficiently differentiable). Other quadrature methods with varying intervals include [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]] (also called Fejér quadrature) methods, which do nest.\n\nGaussian quadrature rules do not nest, but the related [[Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula]]s do.\n\n=== Generalized midpoint rule formula ===\n\nA generalized midpoint rule formula is given by\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{\\frac{{{{\\left({-1}\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{n+1}}\\left({n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{\\left(n\\right)}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}}\n</math>\nor\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^N{\\frac{{{{\\left({-1}\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{n+1}}\\left({n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{\\left(n\\right)}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}},\n</math>\nwhere <math> f^{(n)}(x) </math> denotes <math> n</math>-th derivative. For example, substituting <math> M=1 </math> and\n:<math>\nf(x) = \\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta^2 x^2}\n</math>\nin the generalized midpoint rule formula, we obtain an equation of the inverse tangent\n:<math>\n\\tan^{-1}(\\theta)=i\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left(1+2i/\\theta\\right)^{2n-1}}-\\frac{1}{\\left(1-2i/\\theta\\right)^{2n-1}}\\right)=2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\frac{{{a}_{n}}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{a_{n}^{2}\\left(\\theta\\right)+b_{n}^{2}\\left(\\theta\\right)}},\n</math>\nwhere <math> i=\\sqrt{-1} </math> is [[imaginary unit]] and\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& a_1(\\theta)=2/\\theta,\\\\ \n& b_1(\\theta)=1,\\\\ \n& a_n(\\theta)=a_{n-1}(\\theta)\\,\\left(1-4/\\theta^2\\right)+4b_{n-1}(\\theta)/\\theta,\\\\ \n& b_n(\\theta)=b_{n-1}(\\theta)\\,\\left(1-4/\\theta^2\\right)-4a_{n-1}(\\theta)/\\theta.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSince at each odd <math> n </math> the numerator of the integrand becomes <math> (-1)^n + 1 = 0 </math>, the generalized midpoint rule formula can be reorganized as\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=2\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{\\frac{{1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{2n+1}}\\left({2n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{(2n)}}(x)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}}\\,\\,.\n</math>\n\nThe following example of Mathematica code generates the plot showing difference between inverse tangent and its approximation truncated at <math> M = 5 </math> and <math> N = 10 </math>:\n<source lang=Mathematica>\nf[theta_, x_] := theta/(1 + theta^2*x^2);\n\naTan[theta_, M_, nMax_] := \n    2*Sum[(Function[x, Evaluate[D[f[theta, x], {x, 2*n}]]][(m - 1/2)/\n        M])/((2*n + 1)!*(2*M)^(2*n + 1)), {m, 1, M}, {n, 0, nMax}];\n\nPlot[{ArcTan[theta] - aTan[theta, 5, 10]}, {theta, -Pi, Pi}, \n PlotRange -> All]\n</source>\n\nFor a function <math> g(t) </math> defined over interval <math> (a,b) </math>, its integral is\n:<math>\n\\int_a^b {g(t) dt} = \\int_0^{b-a} {g(\\tau+a) d\\tau}= (b-a)\\int_0^1 {g((b-a)x+a) dx}.\n</math>\nTherefore, we can apply the generalized midpoint integration formula above by assuming that <math> f(x) = (b-a)\\,g((b-a)x+a) </math>.\n\n=== Adaptive algorithms ===\n{{details|Adaptive quadrature}}\n\nIf ''f''(''x'') does not have many derivatives at all points, or if the derivatives become large, then Gaussian quadrature is often insufficient. In this case, an algorithm similar to the following will perform better:\n\n<source lang=python>\ndef calculate_definite_integral_of_f(f, initial_step_size):\n    '''\n    This algorithm calculates the definite integral of a function\n    from 0 to 1, adaptively, by choosing smaller steps near\n    problematic points.\n    '''\n    x = 0.0\n    h = initial_step_size\n    accumulator = 0.0\n    while x < 1.0:\n        if x + h > 1.0:\n            h = 1.0 - x # At end of unit interval, adjust last step to end at 1.\n        if error_too_big_in_quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x,x+h]):\n            h = make_h_smaller(h)\n        else:\n            accumulator += quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x,x+h])\n            x += h\n            if error_too_small_in_quadrature_of_over_range(f, [x,x+h]):\n                h = make_h_larger(h) # Avoid wasting time on tiny steps.\n    return accumulator\n</source>\n\nSome details of the algorithm require careful thought. For many cases, estimating the error from quadrature over an interval for a function ''f''(''x'') isn't obvious. One popular solution is to use two different rules of quadrature, and use their difference as an estimate of the error from quadrature. The other problem is deciding what \"too large\" or \"very small\" signify. A ''local'' criterion for \"too large\" is that the quadrature error should not be larger than ''t''&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;''h'' where ''t'', a real number, is the tolerance we wish to set for global error. Then again, if ''h'' is already tiny, it may not be worthwhile to make it even smaller even if the quadrature error is apparently large. A ''global'' criterion is that the sum of errors on all the intervals should be less than&nbsp;''t''.  This type of error analysis is usually called \"a posteriori\" since we compute the error after having computed the approximation.\n\nHeuristics for adaptive quadrature are discussed by Forsythe et al. (Section 5.4).\n\n=== Extrapolation methods ===\n\nThe accuracy of a quadrature rule of the [[Newton-Cotes]] type is generally a function of the number of evaluation points.\nThe result is usually more accurate as the number of evaluation points increases,\nor, equivalently, as the width of the step size between the points decreases.\nIt is natural to ask what the result would be if the step size were allowed to approach zero.\nThis can be answered by extrapolating the result from two or more nonzero step sizes, using [[series acceleration]] methods such as [[Richardson extrapolation]].\nThe extrapolation function may be a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].\nExtrapolation methods are described in more detail by Stoer and Bulirsch (Section 3.4) and are implemented in many of the routines in the [[QUADPACK]] library.\n\n=== Conservative (a priori) error estimation ===\nLet <math>f</math> have a bounded first derivative over <math>[a,b],</math> i.e. <math>f \\in C^1([a,b]).</math> The [[mean value theorem]] for <math> f,</math> where <math>x \\in [a,b),</math> gives\n:<math>\n (x - a) f'(\\xi_x) = f(x) - f(a),\n</math>\nfor some <math> \\xi_x \\in (a,x] </math> depending on <math> x </math>. \nIf we integrate in <math> x </math> from <math> a </math> to <math> b </math> on both sides and take the absolute values, we obtain\n:<math>\n  \\left| \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\right|\n  = \\left| \\int_a^b (x - a) f'(v_x)\\, dx \\right| .\n</math>\nWe can further approximate the integral on the right-hand side by bringing the absolute value into the integrand, and replacing the term in <math> f' </math> by an upper bound\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n  \\left| \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\right| \n  \\leq {(b - a)^2 \\over 2} \\sup_{a \\leq x \\leq b} \\left| f'(x) \\right| ,\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}\n}}\nwhere the [[supremum]] was used to approximate.\nHence, if we approximate the integral <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math> by the [[Numerical_integration#Methods_for_one-dimensional_integrals|quadrature rule]] <math> (b-a) f(a) </math> our error is no greater than the right hand side of {{EquationNote|1}}. \nWe can convert this into an error analysis for the [[Riemann sum#Definition|Riemann sum]] (*), giving an upper bound of\n\n: <math>{n^{-1} \\over 2} \\sup_{0 \\leq x \\leq 1} \\left| f'(x) \\right|</math>\n\nfor the error term of that particular approximation. (Note that this is precisely the error we calculated for the example <math>f(x) = x</math>.) Using more derivatives, and by tweaking the quadrature, we can do a similar error analysis using a [[Taylor series]] (using a partial sum with remainder term) for ''f''. This error analysis gives a strict upper bound on the error, if the derivatives of ''f'' are available.\n\nThis integration method can be combined with [[interval arithmetic]] to produce [[computer proof]]s and ''verified'' calculations.\n\n=== Integrals over infinite intervals ===\n\nSeveral methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals. The standard technique involves specially derived quadrature rules, such as [[Gauss-Hermite quadrature]] for integrals on the whole real line and [[Gauss-Laguerre quadrature]] for integrals on the positive reals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leader |first=Jeffery J. | authorlink=Jeffery J. Leader| title=Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computation |year=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |location= |isbn= 978-0-201-73499-7}}</ref> Monte Carlo methods can also be used, or a change of variables to a finite interval; e.g., for the whole line one could use\n\n:<math>\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{+1} f\\left( \\frac{t}{1-t^2} \\right) \\frac{1+t^2}{(1-t^2)^2} \\, dt,\n</math>\n\nand for semi-infinite intervals one could use\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_a^{\\infty}f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 f\\left(a + \\frac{t}{1-t}\\right) \\frac{dt}{(1-t)^2}, \\\\\n\\int_{-\\infty}^a f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 f\\left(a - \\frac{1-t}{t}\\right) \\frac{dt}{t^2},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nas possible transformations.\n\n== Multidimensional integrals ==\n\nThe quadrature rules discussed so far are all designed to compute one-dimensional integrals. To compute integrals in multiple dimensions, one approach is to phrase the multiple integral as repeated one-dimensional integrals by applying [[Fubini's theorem]] (the tensor product rule). This approach requires the function evaluations to [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] as the number of dimensions increases. Three methods are known to overcome this so-called ''[[curse of dimensionality]]''.\n\nA great many additional techniques for forming multidimensional cubature integration rules for a variety of weighting functions are given in the monograph by Stroud.<ref name=\"StroudBook\">{{cite book |last1=Stroud |first1=A. H. |title=Approximate Calculation of Multiple Integrals |date=1971 |publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc. |location=Cliffs, NJ}}</ref> \n\n=== Monte Carlo ===\n\n{{main|Monte Carlo integration}}\n\n[[Monte Carlo method]]s and [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]s are easy to apply to multi-dimensional integrals. They may yield greater accuracy for the same number of function evaluations than repeated integrations using one-dimensional methods. {{CN|date=November 2018}}\n\nA large class of useful Monte Carlo methods are the so-called [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms,\nwhich include the [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]] and [[Gibbs sampling]].\n\n=== Sparse grids ===\n[[Sparse grid]]s were originally developed by Smolyak for the quadrature of high-dimensional functions. The method is always based on a one-dimensional quadrature rule, but performs a more sophisticated combination of univariate results. However, whereas the tensor product rule guarantees that the weights of all of the cubature points will be positive if the weights of the quadrature points were positive, Smolyak's rule does not guarantee that the  weights will all be positive.\n\n=== Bayesian Quadrature ===\nBayesian Quadrature is a statistical approach to the numerical problem of computing integrals and falls under the field of probabilistic numerics. It can provide a full handling of the uncertainty over the solution of the integral expressed as a [[Gaussian Process]] posterior variance. It is also known to provide very fast convergence rates which can be up to exponential in the number of quadrature points n.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|title = Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature: Probabilistic Integration with Theoretical Guarantees |eprint = 1506.02681 |date = 2015-06-08|first = François-Xavier|last = Briol|first2 = Chris J.|last2 = Oates|first3 = Mark|last3 = Girolami|first4 = Michael A.|last4 = Osborne|class = stat.ML }}</ref>\n\n== Connection with differential equations ==\n\nThe problem of evaluating the integral\n:<math>F(x) = \\int_a^x f(u)\\, du</math>\ncan be reduced to an [[initial value problem]] for an [[ordinary differential equation]] by applying the first part of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. By differentiating both sides of the above with respect to the argument ''x'', it is seen that the function ''F'' satisfies\n:<math> \\frac{d F(x)}{d x} = f(x), \\quad F(a) = 0. </math>\nMethods developed for ordinary differential equations, such as [[Runge–Kutta methods]], can be applied to the restated problem and thus be used to evaluate the integral. For instance, the standard fourth-order Runge–Kutta method applied to the differential equation yields Simpson's rule from above.\n\nThe differential equation ''F''&thinsp;'&thinsp;(''x'') = &fnof;(''x'') has a special form: the right-hand side contains only the dependent variable (here ''x'') and not the independent variable (here ''F''). This simplifies the theory and algorithms considerably. The problem of evaluating integrals is thus best studied in its own right.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations]]\n* [[Truncation error (numerical integration)]]\n* [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]]\n* [[Gauss-Kronrod quadrature]]\n* [[Riemann Sum]] or [[Riemann Integral]]\n* [[Trapezoidal rule]]\n* [[Romberg's method]]\n* [[Tanh-sinh quadrature]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Philip J.

If the estimated error is larger than the required tolerance <math>\\tau</math>(line 4), the interval is subdivided (line 5) and the quadrature is applied on both halves separately (line 6). Either the initial estimate or the sum of the recursively computed halves is returned (line 7).\n\nThe important components are the [[Numerical integration|quadrature]] rule itself\n\n:<math>Q \\approx \\int_a^bf(x)\\,\\mbox{d}x ,</math>\n\nthe [[error estimator]]\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon \\approx \\left|Q - \\int_a^bf(x)\\,\\mbox{d}x\\right| ,</math>\n\nand the logic for deciding which interval to subdivide, and when to terminate.\n\nThere are several variants of this scheme. The most common will be discussed later.\n\n==Basic rules==\nThe quadrature rules generally have the form\n\n:<math>Q_n \\quad = \\quad \\sum_{i=0}^n w_if(x_i) \\quad \\approx \\quad \\int_a^b f(x)\\,\\mbox{d}x</math>\n\nwhere the nodes <math>x_i</math> and weights <math>w_i</math> are generally precomputed.\n\nIn the simplest case, [[Newton–Cotes formulas]] of even degree are used, where the nodes <math>x_i</math> are evenly spaced in the interval:\n\n:<math>x_i = a + \\frac{i}{n}(b - a)</math>.\n\nWhen such rules are used, the points at which <math>f(x)</math> has been evaluated can be re-used upon recursion:\n\n:[[Image:Newton-Cotes re-use.png]]\n\nA similar strategy is used with [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]], where the nodes are chosen as\n\n:<math>x_i = \\cos\\left( \\frac{2i}{n}\\pi \\right)</math>.\n\nOr, when [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature#Fejér quadrature|Fejér quadrature]] is used,\n\n:<math>x_i = \\cos\\left( \\frac{2(i+0.5)}{n+1}\\pi \\right)</math>.\n\nOther quadrature rules, such as [[Gaussian quadrature]] or [[Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula|Gauss-Kronrod quadrature]], may also be used.\n\nAn algorithm may elect to use different quadrature methods on different subintervals, for example using a high-order method only where the integrand is smooth.\n\n==Error estimation==\nSome quadrature algorithms generate a sequence of results which should approach the correct value. Otherwise one can use a \"null rule\" which has the form of the above quadrature rule, but whose value would be zero for a simple integrand (for example, if the integrand were a polynomial of the appropriate degree).\n\nSee:\n* [[Richardson extrapolation]] (see also [[Romberg's method]])\n* Null rules\n* Epsilon algorithm\n\n==Subdivision logic==\n\"Local\" adaptive quadrature makes the acceptable error for a given interval proportional to the length of that interval. This criterion can be difficult to satisfy if the integrands are badly behaved at only a few points, for example with a few step discontinuities.  Alternatively, one could require only that the sum of the errors on each of the subintervals be less than the user's requirement. This would be \"global\" adaptive quadrature. Global adaptive quadrature can be more efficient (using fewer evaluations of the integrand) but is generally more complex to program and may require more working space to record information on the current set of intervals.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adaptive Simpson's method]] for an example of adaptive quadrature\n* [[QUADPACK]], a FORTRAN library that uses global adaptive quadrature\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |last1=McKeeman |first1=William |author-link1=William M.

Adaptive Simpson's method uses an estimate of the error we get from calculating a definite integral using [[Simpson's rule]].  If the error exceeds a user-specified tolerance, the algorithm calls for subdividing the interval of integration in two and applying adaptive Simpson's method to each subinterval in a recursive manner.

These values, used for evaluating {{math|''S''(''a'', ''b'')}} at the parent level, will again be used for the subintervals. Doing so cuts down the cost of each recursive call from 6 to 2 evaluations of the input function.

Each [[Node (graph theory)|node]] in this tree represents a region of the three-dimensional space. \nThe topmost node represents the whole space, and its eight children represent the eight [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|octants]] of the space. The space is recursively subdivided into octants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their octants). \nThere are two types of nodes in the octree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the [[center of mass]] and the total mass of all its children bodies.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Barnes_hut_partikel.png|Particle distribution resembling two neighboring galaxies.\nImage:Barnes_hut_tree.png|Complete Barnes–Hut tree.

If the center of mass of an internal node is sufficiently far from the body, the bodies contained in that part of the tree are treated as a single particle whose position and mass is respectively the center of mass and total mass of the internal node. If the internal node is sufficiently close to the body, the process is repeated for each of its children.\n\nWhether a node is or isn't sufficiently far away from a body, depends on the quotient <math>s/d</math>, where ''s'' is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and ''d'' is the distance between the body and the node's center of mass. The node is sufficiently far away when this ratio is smaller than a threshold value ''θ''. The parameter ''θ'' determines the accuracy of the simulation; larger values of ''θ'' increase the speed of the simulation but decreases its accuracy. If ''θ'' = 0, no internal node is treated as a single body and the algorithm degenerates to a direct-sum algorithm.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cosmology}}\n* [[NEMO (Stellar Dynamics Toolbox)]]\n* [[Nearest neighbor search]]\n* [[Fast multipole method]]\n\n==References and sources==\n;References\n{{reflist}}\n;Sources\n*{{cite journal |author1=J.

      "text": "In [[numerical analysis]], the '''Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm''' is a method for the [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical solution of ordinary differential equations]] which combines three powerful ideas: [[Richardson extrapolation]], the use of [[rational function extrapolation]] in Richardson-type applications, and the [[modified midpoint method]], to obtain numerical solutions to [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs) with high accuracy and comparatively little computational effort. It is named after [[Roland Bulirsch]] and [[Josef Stoer]]. It is sometimes called the '''Gragg–Bulirsch–Stoer (GBS) algorithm''' because of the importance of a result about the error function of the modified midpoint method, due to [[William B. Gragg]].\n\n==Underlying ideas==\n\nThe idea of Richardson extrapolation is to consider a numerical calculation whose accuracy depends on the used stepsize ''h'' as an (unknown) [[analytic function]] of the stepsize ''h'', performing the numerical calculation with various values of ''h'', fitting a (chosen) analytic function to the resulting points, and then evaluating the fitting function for ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, thus trying to approximate the result of the calculation with infinitely fine steps.\n\nBulirsch and Stoer recognized that using [[rational function]]s as fitting functions for Richardson extrapolation in numerical integration is superior to using [[polynomial function]]s because rational functions are able to approximate functions with poles rather well (compared to polynomial functions), given that there are enough higher-power terms in the denominator to account for nearby poles.  While a polynomial interpolation or extrapolation only yields good results if the nearest pole is rather far outside a circle around the known data points in the complex plane, rational function interpolation or extrapolation can have remarkable accuracy even in the presence of nearby poles.\n\nThe modified midpoint method by itself is a second-order method, and therefore generally inferior to fourth-order methods like the [[Runge–Kutta methods|fourth-order Runge–Kutta method]].  However, it has the advantage of requiring only one derivative evaluation per substep (asymptotically for a large number of substeps), and, in addition, as discovered by Gragg, the error of a modified midpoint step of size ''H'', consisting of ''n'' substeps of size ''h'' = ''H''/''n'' each, and expressed as a power series in ''h'', contains only even powers of ''h''.

Equivalently, they employ a [[change of variables]] <math>x = \\cos \\theta</math> and use a [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) approximation for the [[cosine series]].  Besides having fast-converging accuracy comparable to [[Gaussian quadrature]] rules, Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature naturally leads to [[nested quadrature rule]]s (where different accuracy orders share points), which is important for both [[adaptive quadrature]] and multidimensional quadrature ([[cubature]]).\n\nBriefly, the [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x)</math> to be integrated is evaluated at the <math>N</math> extrema or roots of a Chebyshev polynomial and these values are used to construct a polynomial approximation for the function.  This polynomial is then integrated exactly.  In practice, the integration weights for the value of the function at each node are precomputed, and this computation can be performed in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> time by means of [[fast Fourier transform]]-related algorithms for the DCT.<ref name=Gentleman72>W.

W. Clenshaw and A. R. Curtis \"[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/resolveppn/GDZPPN001163442 A method for numerical integration on an automatic computer] ''Numerische Mathematik'' '''2''', 197 (1960).</ref> amounts to integrating via a [[change of variables|change of variable]] ''x'' = cos(θ).  The algorithm is normally expressed for integration of a function ''f''(''x'') over the interval [-1,1] (any other interval can be obtained by appropriate  rescaling).  For this integral, we can write:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\pi f(\\cos \\theta) \\sin(\\theta)\\, d\\theta . </math>\n\nThat is, we have transformed the problem from integrating <math>f(x)</math> to one of integrating <math>f(\\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta</math>.  This can be performed if we know the [[cosine series]] for <math>f(\\cos \\theta)</math>:\n\n:<math>f(\\cos \\theta) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k \\cos (k\\theta)</math>\n\nin which case the integral becomes:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\pi f(\\cos \\theta) \\sin(\\theta)\\, d\\theta = a_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{2 a_{2k}}{1 - (2k)^2} .</math>\n\nOf course, in order to calculate the cosine series coefficients\n\n:<math>a_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi f(\\cos \\theta) \\cos(k \\theta)\\, d\\theta,\\quad k=0,1,2,\\dots,</math>\n\none must again perform a numeric integration, so at first this may not seem to have simplified the problem.  Unlike computation of arbitrary integrals, however, Fourier-series integrations for [[periodic functions]] (like <math>f(\\cos\\theta)</math>, by construction), up to the [[Nyquist frequency]] <math>k=N</math>, are accurately computed by the <math>N+1</math> equally spaced and equally weighted points <math>\\theta_n = n \\pi / N</math> for <math>n = 0,\\ldots,N</math> (except the endpoints are weighted by 1/2, to avoid double-counting, equivalent to the [[trapezoidal rule]] or the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]).<ref>J. P. Boyd, ''Chebychev and Fourier Spectral Methods'', 2nd ed. (Dover, New York, 2001).</ref><ref>See, for example, S. G. Johnson, \"[http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/trapezoidal.pdf Notes on the convergence of trapezoidal-rule quadrature],\" online MIT course notes (2008).</ref>   That is, we approximate the cosine-series integral by the type-I [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT):\n\n:<math>a_k \\approx \\frac{2}{N} \\left[ \\frac{f(1)}{2} + \\frac{f(-1)}{2} (-1)^k +  \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} f(\\cos[n\\pi/N]) \\cos(n k \\pi/N) \\right]</math>\n\nfor <math>k = 0,\\ldots,N</math> and then use the formula above for the integral in terms of these <math>a_k</math>.  Because only <math>a_{2k}</math> is needed, the formula simplifies further into a type-I DCT of order ''N''/2, assuming ''N'' is an [[even number]]:\n\n:<math>a_{2k} \\approx \\frac{2}{N} \\left[ \\frac{f(1) + f(-1)}{2} +  f(0) (-1)^k +  \\sum_{n=1}^{N/2-1} \\left\\{ f(\\cos[n\\pi/N]) + f(-\\cos[n\\pi/N]) \\right\\} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n k \\pi}{N/2}\\right) \\right]</math>\n\nFrom this formula, it is clear that the Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature rule is symmetric, in that it weights ''f''(''x'') and ''f''(&minus;''x'') equally.\n\nBecause of [[aliasing]], one only computes the coefficients <math>a_{2k}</math> up to ''k''=''N''/2, since discrete sampling of the function makes the frequency of 2''k'' indistinguishable from that of ''N''–2''k''.  Equivalently, the <math>a_{2k}</math> are the amplitudes of the unique [[bandlimited]] [[trigonometric interpolation polynomial]] passing through the ''N''+1 points where ''f''(cos ''&theta;'') is evaluated, and we approximate the integral by the integral of this interpolation polynomial. There is some subtlety in how one treats the <math>a_{N}</math> coefficient in the integral, however—to avoid double-counting with its alias it is included with weight 1/2 in the final approximate integral (as can also be seen by examining the interpolating polynomial):\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\pi f(\\cos \\theta) \\sin(\\theta)\\, d\\theta \\approx a_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N/2-1} \\frac{2 a_{2k}}{1 - (2k)^2} + \\frac{a_{N}}{1 - N^2}.</math>\n\n==Connection to Chebyshev polynomials==\n\nThe reason that this is connected to the Chebyshev polynomials <math>T_k(x)</math> is that, by definition, <math>T_k(\\cos\\theta) = \\cos(k\\theta)</math>, and so the cosine series above is really an approximation of <math>f(x)</math> by Chebyshev polynomials:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} T_0(x) + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k T_k(x),</math>\n\nand thus we are \"really\" integrating <math>f(x)</math> by integrating its approximate expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials.  The evaluation points <math>x_n = \\cos(n\\pi/N)</math> correspond to the [[Maxima and minima|extrema]] of the Chebyshev polynomial <math>T_N(x)</math>.\n\nThe fact that such [[Chebyshev approximation]] is just a cosine series under a change of variables is responsible for the rapid convergence of the approximation as more terms <math>T_k (x)</math> are included.  A cosine series converges very rapidly for functions that are [[even and odd functions|even]], periodic, and sufficiently smooth.  This is true here, since <math>f(\\cos\\theta)</math> is even and periodic in <math>\\theta</math> by construction, and is ''k''-times differentiable everywhere if <math>f(x)</math> is ''k''-times differentiable on <math>[-1,1]</math>.  (In contrast, directly applying a cosine-series expansion to <math>f(x)</math> instead of <math>f(\\cos \\theta)</math> will usually ''not'' converge rapidly because the slope of the even-periodic extension would generally be discontinuous.)\n\n==Fejér quadrature==\n\n[[Lipót Fejér|Fejér]] proposed two quadrature rules very similar to Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature, but much earlier (in 1933).<ref name=Fejer33>Leopold Fejér, \"[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183496842 On the infinite sequences arising in the theories of harmonic analysis, of interpolation, and of mechanical quadratures]\", ''Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society'' '''39''' (1933), pp. 521–534.  Leopold Fejér, \"[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/resolveppn/GDZPPN002374498 Mechanische Quadraturen mit positiven Cotesschen Zahlen], ''Mathematische Zeitschrift'' '''37''' , 287 (1933).</ref>\n\nOf these two, Fejér's \"second\" quadrature rule is nearly identical to Clenshaw–Curtis.  The only difference is that the endpoints <math>f(-1)</math> and <math>f(1)</math> are set to zero.  That is, Fejér only used the ''interior'' extrema of the Chebyshev polynomials, i.e. the true stationary points.\n\nFejér's \"first\" quadrature rule evaluates the <math>a_k</math> by evaluating <math>f(\\cos\\theta)</math> at a different set of equally spaced points, halfway between the extrema: <math>\\theta_n = (n + 0.5) \\pi / N</math> for <math>0 \\leq n < N</math>.  These are the ''roots'' of <math>T_N(\\cos\\theta)</math>, and are known as the [[Chebyshev nodes]].  (These equally spaced midpoints are the only other choice of quadrature points that preserve both the [[even and odd functions|even symmetry]] of the cosine transform and the translational symmetry of the periodic Fourier series.)  This leads to a formula:\n\n:<math>a_k \\approx \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(\\cos[(n+0.5)\\pi/N]) \\cos[(n+0.5) k \\pi/N] </math>\n\nwhich is precisely the type-II DCT.  However, Fejér's first quadrature rule is not nested: the evaluation points for 2''N'' do not coincide with any of the evaluation points for ''N'', unlike Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature or Fejér's second rule.\n\nDespite the fact that Fejér discovered these techniques before Clenshaw and Curtis, the name \"Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature\" has become standard.\n\n==Comparison to Gaussian quadrature==\n\nThe classic method of [[Gaussian quadrature]] evaluates the integrand at <math>N+1</math> points and is constructed to ''exactly'' integrate polynomials up to [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] <math>2N+1</math>. In contrast, Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature, above, evaluates the integrand at <math>N+1</math> points and exactly integrates polynomials only up to degree <math>N</math>.  It may seem, therefore, that Clenshaw–Curtis is intrinsically worse than Gaussian quadrature, but in reality this does not seem to be the case.\n\nIn practice, several authors have observed that Clenshaw–Curtis can have accuracy comparable to that of Gaussian quadrature for the same number of points.  This is possible because most numeric integrands are not polynomials (especially since polynomials can be integrated analytically), and approximation of many functions in terms of Chebyshev polynomials converges rapidly (see [[Chebyshev approximation]]).  In fact, recent theoretical results<ref name=Trefethen08>{{cite journal | first = Lloyd N. | last = Trefethen | citeseerx = 10.1.1.157.4174 | title = Is Gauss quadrature better than Clenshaw-Curtis? | journal = SIAM Review | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–87 | date = 2008 | doi=10.1137/060659831}}</ref> argue that both Gaussian and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature have error bounded by <math>O([2N]^{-k}/k)</math> for a ''k''-times differentiable integrand.\n\nOne often cited advantage of Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature is that the quadrature weights can be evaluated in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> time by [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms (or their analogues for the DCT), whereas most algorithms for Gaussian quadrature weights required <math>O(N^2)</math> time to compute. However, recent algorithms have attained <math>O(N)</math> complexity for Gauss–Legendre quadrature.<ref>Ignace Bogaert, ''Iteration-Free Computation of Gauss--Legendre Quadrature Nodes and Weights,'' SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing vol. '''36''', pp. A1008–A1026 (2014)</ref> As a practical matter, high-order numeric integration is rarely performed by simply evaluating a quadrature formula for very large <math>N</math>.  Instead, one usually employs an [[adaptive quadrature]] scheme that first evaluates the integral to low order, and then successively refines the accuracy by increasing the number of sample points, possibly only in regions where the integral is inaccurate.  To evaluate the accuracy of the quadrature, one compares the answer with that of a quadrature rule of even lower order.  Ideally, this lower-order quadrature rule evaluates the integrand at a ''subset'' of the original ''N'' points, to minimize the integrand evaluations.  This is called a [[nested quadrature rule]], and here Clenshaw–Curtis has the advantage that the rule for order ''N'' uses a subset of the points from order 2''N''.  In contrast, Gaussian quadrature rules are not naturally nested, and so one must employ [[Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula]]s or similar methods. Nested rules are also important for [[sparse grid]]s in multidimensional quadrature, and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature is a popular method in this context.<ref>Erich Novak and Klaus Ritter, \"High dimensional integration of smooth functions over cubes,\" ''Numerische Mathematik'' vol. '''75''', pp. 79–97 (1996).</ref>\n\n==Integration with weight functions==\n\nMore generally, one can pose the problem of integrating an arbitrary <math>f(x)</math> against a fixed ''weight function'' <math>w(x)</math> that is known ahead of time:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x) w(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\pi f(\\cos \\theta) w(\\cos\\theta) \\sin(\\theta)\\, d\\theta . </math>\n\nThe most common case is <math>w(x) = 1</math>, as above, but in certain applications a different weight function is desirable.  The basic reason is that, since <math>w(x)</math> can be taken into account ''a priori'', the integration error can be made to depend only on the accuracy in approximating <math>f(x)</math>, regardless of how badly behaved the weight function might be.\n\nClenshaw–Curtis quadrature can be generalized to this case as follows.  As before, it works by finding the cosine-series expansion of <math>f(\\cos \\theta)</math> via a DCT, and then integrating each term in the cosine series.  Now, however, these integrals are of the form\n\n:<math>W_k = \\int_0^\\pi w(\\cos \\theta) \\cos(k \\theta) \\sin(\\theta)\\, d\\theta . </math>\n\nFor most <math>w(x)</math>, this integral cannot be computed analytically, unlike before.  Since the same weight function is generally used for many integrands <math>f(x)</math>, however, one can afford to compute these <math>W_k</math> numerically to high accuracy beforehand.  Moreover, since <math>w(x)</math> is generally specified analytically, one can sometimes employ specialized methods to compute <math>W_k</math>.\n\nFor example, special methods have been developed to apply Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature to integrands of the form <math>f(x) w(x)</math> with a weight function <math>w(x)</math> that is highly oscillatory, e.g. a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] or [[Bessel function]] (see, e.g., Evans & Webster, 1999<ref name=Evans99>G. A. Evans and J. R. Webster, \"A comparison of some methods for the evaluation of highly oscillatory integrals,\" ''Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics'', vol. '''112''', p. 55-69 (1999).</ref>).  This is useful for high-accuracy [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier–Bessel series]] computation, where simple <math>w(x)=1</math> quadrature methods are problematic because of the high accuracy required to resolve the contribution of rapid oscillations. Here, the rapid-oscillation part of the integrand is taken into account via specialized methods for <math>W_k</math>, whereas the unknown function <math>f(x)</math> is usually better behaved.\n\nAnother case where weight functions are especially useful is if the integrand is unknown but has a known singularity of some form, e.g. a known discontinuity or integrable divergence (such as 1/{{radic|''x''}}) at some point.  In this case the singularity can be pulled into the weight function <math>w(x)</math> and its analytical properties can be used to compute <math>W_k</math> accurately beforehand.\n\nNote that [[Gaussian quadrature]] can also be adapted for various weight functions, but the technique is somewhat different.  In Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature, the integrand is always evaluated at the same set of points regardless of <math>w(x)</math>, corresponding to the extrema or roots of a Chebyshev polynomial.  In Gaussian quadrature, different weight functions lead to different [[orthogonal polynomials]], and thus different roots where the integrand is evaluated.\n\n==Integration on infinite and semi-infinite intervals==\n\nIt is also possible to use Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature to compute integrals of the form <math>\\int_0^\\infty f(x)\\,dx</math> and <math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\,dx</math>, using a coordinate-remapping technique.<ref name=Boyd87>John P. Boyd, \"Exponentially convergent Fourier–Chebshev <nowiki>[</nowiki>''sic''<nowiki>]</nowiki> quadrature schemes on bounded and infinite intervals,\" ''J. Scientific Computing'' '''2''' (2), p. 99-109 (1987).</ref> High accuracy, even exponential convergence for smooth integrands, can be retained as long as <math>f(x)</math> decays sufficiently quickly as |''x''| approaches infinity.\n\nOne possibility is to use a generic coordinate transformation such as ''x''=''t''/(1&minus;''t''<sup>2</sup>)\n:<math>\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1}f\\left(\\frac{t}{1-t^2}\\right)\\frac{1+t^2}{(1-t^2)^2}\\,dt,\n</math>\nto transform an infinite or semi-infinite interval into a finite one, as described in [[Numerical integration#Integrals over infinite intervals|Numerical integration]].  There are also additional techniques that have been developed specifically for Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature.\n\nFor example, one can use the coordinate remapping <math>x = L \\cot^2(\\theta/2)</math>, where ''L'' is a user-specified constant (one could simply use ''L''=1; an optimal choice of ''L'' can speed convergence, but is problem-dependent<ref name=Boyd87/>), to transform the semi-infinite integral into:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty f(x)\\,dx = 2L \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{f[L \\cot^2(\\theta/2)]}{[1 - \\cos(\\theta)]^2} \\sin(\\theta)\\,d\\theta .</math>\n\nThe factor multiplying sin(θ), ''f''(...)/(...)<sup>2</sup>, can then be expanded in a cosine series (approximately, using the discrete cosine transform) and integrated term-by-term, exactly as was done for ''f''(cos&nbsp;θ) above.  To eliminate the singularity at θ=0 in this integrand, one merely requires that ''f''(''x'') go to zero sufficiently fast as ''x'' approaches infinity, and in particular ''f''(''x'') must decay at least as fast as 1/''x''<sup>3/2</sup>.<ref name=Boyd87/>\n\nFor a doubly infinite interval of integration, one can use the coordinate remapping <math>x = L\\cot(\\theta)</math> (where ''L'' is a user-specified constant as above) to transform the integral into:<ref name=Boyd87/>\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\,dx = L \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{f[L \\cot(\\theta)]}{\\sin^2(\\theta)}\\,d\\theta\n\\approx \\frac{L\\pi}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\frac{f[L \\cot(n\\pi/N)]}{\\sin^2(n\\pi/N)}.</math>\n\nIn this case, we have used the fact that the remapped integrand ''f''(''L''&nbsp;cotθ)/sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) is already periodic and so can be directly integrated with high (even exponential) accuracy using the trapezoidal rule (assuming ''f'' is sufficiently smooth and rapidly decaying); there is no need to compute the cosine series as an intermediate step.  Note that the quadrature rule does not include the endpoints, where we have assumed that the integrand goes to zero.  The formula above requires that ''f''(''x'') decay faster than 1/''x''<sup>2</sup> as ''x'' goes to ±∞. (If ''f'' decays exactly as 1/''x''<sup>2</sup>, then the integrand goes to a finite value at the endpoints and these limits must be included as endpoint terms in the trapezoidal rule.<ref name=Boyd87/>).  However, if ''f'' decays only polynomially quickly, then it may be necessary to use a further step of Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature to obtain exponential accuracy of the remapped integral instead of the trapezoidal rule, depending on more details of the limiting properties of ''f'': the problem is that, although ''f''(''L''&nbsp;cotθ)/sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) is indeed periodic with period π, it is not necessarily smooth at the endpoints if all the derivatives do not vanish there [e.g. the function ''f''(''x'') = tanh(''x''<sup>3</sup>)/''x''<sup>3</sup> decays as 1/''x''<sup>3</sup> but has a jump discontinuity in the slope of the remapped function at θ=0 and π].<!-- the Boyd paper makes broader claims of exponential convergence that do not seem to be correct; e.g. try the function f(x) = tanh(x^3)/x^3 -->\n\nAnother coordinate-remapping approach was suggested for integrals of the form <math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} g(x)\\,dx</math>, in which case one can use the transformation <math>x = -\\ln[(1 + \\cos\\theta)/2]</math> to transform the integral into the form <math>\\int_0^\\pi f(\\cos\\theta)\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta</math> where <math>f(u) = g(-\\ln[(1+u)/2])/2</math>, at which point one can proceed identically to Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature for ''f'' as above.<ref name=Basu77>Nirmal Kumar Basu and Madhav Chandra Kundu, \"Some methods of numerical integration over a semi-infinite interval,\" ''Applications of Mathematics'' '''22''' (4), p. 237-243 (1977).</ref> Because of the endpoint singularities in this coordinate remapping, however, one uses Fejér's first quadrature rule [which does not evaluate ''f''(&minus;1)] unless ''g''(∞) is finite.\n\n==Precomputing the quadrature weights==\n\nIn practice, it is inconvenient to perform a DCT of the sampled function values ''f''(cosθ) for each new integrand.  Instead, one normally precomputes quadrature weights <math>w_n</math> (for ''n'' from 0 to ''N''/2, assuming that ''N'' is even) so that\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\\,dx \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{N/2} w_n \\left\\{ f(\\cos[n\\pi/N]) + f(-\\cos[n\\pi/N]) \\right\\} .</math>\n\nThese weights <math>w_n</math> are also computed by a DCT, as is easily seen by expressing the computation in terms of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[linear algebra|algebra]].

In terms of these coefficients ''c'', the integral is approximately:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\\,dx \\approx a_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N/2-1} \\frac{2 a_{2k}}{1 - (2k)^2} + \\frac{a_{N}}{1 - N^2} = d^T c,</math>\n\nfrom above, where ''c'' is the vector of coefficients <math>a_{2k}</math> above and ''d'' is the vector of integrals for each Fourier coefficient:\n\n:<math>d = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2/(1-4) \\\\ 2/(1-16) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 2 / (1-[N-2]^2) \\\\ 1 / (1-N^2) \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n(Note, however, that these weight factors are altered if one changes the DCT matrix ''D'' to use a different normalization convention.  For example, it is common to define the type-I DCT with additional factors of 2 or {{radic|2}} factors in the first and last rows or columns, which leads to corresponding alterations in the ''d'' entries.) The <math>d^T c</math> summation can be re-arranged to:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\\,dx \\approx d^T c = d^T D y = (D^T d)^T y = w^T y</math>\n\nwhere ''w'' is the vector of the desired weights <math>w_n</math> above, with:\n\n:<math>w = D^T d. \\!</math>\n\nSince the [[transpose]]d matrix <math>D^T</math> is also a DCT (e.g., the transpose of a type-I DCT is a type-I DCT, possibly with a slightly different normalization depending on the conventions that are employed), the quadrature weights ''w'' can be precomputed in ''O''(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time for a given ''N'' using fast DCT algorithms.\n\nThe weights <math>w_n</math> are positive and their sum is equal to one.<ref>J.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Summation formula}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Euler–Maclaurin formula''' is a formula for the difference between an [[integral]] and a closely related sum.  It can be used to approximate integrals by finite sums, or conversely to evaluate finite sums and [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] using integrals and the machinery of calculus. For example, many asymptotic expansions are derived from the formula, and [[Faulhaber's formula]] for the sum of powers is an immediate consequence.\n\nThe formula was discovered independently by [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Colin Maclaurin]] around 1735.  Euler needed it to compute slowly converging infinite series while Maclaurin used it to calculate integrals.  It was later generalized to [[Darboux's formula]].\n\n==The formula==\nIf <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are [[natural number]]s and <math>f(x)</math> is a complex or real valued [[continuous function]] for [[real number]]s <math>x</math> in the interval <math>[m,n]</math>, then the integral\n\n:<math>I = \\int_m^n f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\ncan be approximated by the sum (or vice versa)\n\n:<math>S = f(m + 1) + \\cdots + f(n - 1) + f(n)</math>\n\n(see [[Riemann sum#Right Riemann sum|rectangle method]]). The Euler–Maclaurin formula provides expressions for the difference between the sum and the integral in terms of the higher derivatives <math>f^{(k)}(x)</math> evaluated at the end points of the interval, that is to say when <math>x=m</math> and <math>x=n</math>.\n\nExplicitly, for <math>p</math> a positive integer and a function <math>f(x)</math> that is <math>p</math> times continuously differentiable in the interval <math>[m, n]</math>, we have\n\n:<math> S - I = \\sum_{k=1}^p {\\frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k - 1)}(n) - f^{(k - 1)}(m))} + R_p,</math>\n\nwhere <math>B_k</math> is the <math>k</math>th [[Bernoulli numbers|Bernoulli number]] (with <math>B_1=1/2</math>) and <math>R_p</math> is an [[numerical integration|error term]] which depends on <math>n</math>, <math>m</math>, <math>p</math>, and <math>f</math> and is usually small for suitable values of <math>p</math>.\n\nThe formula is often written with the subscript taking only even values, since the odd Bernoulli numbers are zero except for <math>B_1</math>.  In this case we have<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"DLMF\">{{cite web|url=http://dlmf.nist.gov/2.10|title=Digital Library of Mathematical Functions: Sums and Sequences|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=m}^n f(i) =\n    \\int^n_m f(x)\\,dx + \\frac{f(n) + f(m)}{2} +\n    \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor p/2\\rfloor} \\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} (f^{(2k - 1)}(n) - f^{(2k - 1)}(m)) + R_p,\n</math>\n\nor alternatively\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=m+1}^n f(i) =\n    \\int^n_m f(x)\\,dx + \\frac{f(n) - f(m)}{2} +\n    \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor p/2\\rfloor} \\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} (f^{(2k - 1)}(n) - f^{(2k - 1)}(m)) + R_p.\n</math>\n\n===The remainder term===\n{{seealso|Bernoulli polynomials}}\n\nThe remainder term arises because the integral is usually not exactly equal to the sum.  The formula may be derived by applying repeated [[integration by parts]] to successive intervals <math>[r, r+1]</math> for <math>r = m, m + 1, \\ldots, n - 1</math>.  The boundary terms in these integrations lead to the main terms of the formula, and the leftover integrals form the remainder term.\n\nThe remainder term has an exact expression in terms of the periodized Bernoulli functions <math>P_k(x)</math>.  The Bernoulli polynomials may be defined recursively by <math>B_0(x) = 1</math> and, for <math>k \\ge 1</math>,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  B_k'(x) &= kB_{k - 1}(x), \\\\\n  \\int_0^1 B_k(x)\\,dx &= 0.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe periodized Bernoulli functions are defined as\n:<math>P_k(x) = B_k(x - \\lfloor x\\rfloor),</math>\nwhere <math>\\lfloor x \\rfloor</math> denotes the largest integer less than or equal to <math>x</math> (so that <math>x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor</math> always lies in the interval <math>[0,1)</math>).\n\nWith this notation, the remainder term <math>R_p</math> equals\n:<math>R_p = (-1)^{p+1}\\int_m^n f^{(p)}(x) \\frac{P_p(x)}{p!}\\,dx. </math>\n\nWhen <math>k>0</math>, it can be shown that\n\n:<math>|B_k(x)| \\le \\frac{2 \\cdot k!}{(2\\pi)^k}\\zeta(k),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\zeta</math>  denotes the [[Riemann zeta function]]; one approach to prove this inequality is to obtain the Fourier series for the polynomials <math>B_k(x)</math>.   The bound is achieved for even <math>k</math> when <math>x</math> is zero.  The term <math>\\zeta(k)</math> may be omitted for odd <math>k</math> but the proof in this case is more complex (see Lehmer).<ref name=\"Lehmer\">{{cite journal|last1=Lehmer|first1=D.

Let <math>a < b</math> be the endpoints of the interval of integration.  Fix <math>N</math>, the number of points to use in the approximation, and denote the corresponding step size by <math>h = (b - a) / (N - 1)</math>.

Then:<ref name=\"Devries\">{{cite book |last1=Devries |first1=Paul L. |last2=Hasbrun |first2=Javier E. |title=A first course in computational physics. |edition=2nd |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2011 |page=156}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI & = \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx \\\\\n&\\sim h\\left(\\frac{f(x_1)}{2} + f(x_2) + \\cdots + f(x_{N-1}) + \\frac{f(x_N)}{2}\\right) + \\frac{h^2}{12}[f'(x_1) - f'(x_N)] - \\frac{h^4}{720}[f'''(x_1) - f'''(x_N)] + \\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis may be viewed as an extension of the [[trapezoid rule]] by the inclusion of correction terms.  Note that this asymptotic expansion is usually not convergent; there is some <math>p</math>, depending upon <math>f</math> and <math>h</math>, such that the terms past order <math>p</math> increase rapidly.  Thus, the remainder term generally demands close attention.<ref name=\"Devries\"/>\n\nThe Euler–Maclaurin formula is also used for detailed [[error analysis (mathematics)|error analysis]] in [[numerical quadrature]]. It explains the superior performance of the [[trapezoidal rule]] on smooth [[periodic function]]s and is used in certain [[Series acceleration|extrapolation methods]]. [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]] is essentially a change of variables to cast an arbitrary integral in terms of integrals of periodic functions where the Euler–Maclaurin approach is very accurate (in that particular case the Euler–Maclaurin formula takes the form of a [[discrete cosine transform]]). This technique is known as a periodizing transformation.\n\n===Asymptotic expansion of sums===\nIn the context of computing [[asymptotic expansion]]s of sums and [[Series (mathematics)|series]], usually the most useful form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=a}^b f(n) \\sim \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx + \\frac{f(b) + f(a)}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\,\\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} \\left(f^{(2k - 1)}(b) - f^{(2k - 1)}(a)\\right),</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are integers.<ref>{{harvtxt|Abramowitz|Stegun|1972}}, 23.1.30</ref> Often the expansion remains valid even after taking the limits <math>a\\rightarrow-\\infty</math> or <math>b\\rightarrow +\\infty</math> or both.  In many cases the integral on the right-hand side can be evaluated in [[Differential Galois theory|closed form]] in terms of [[elementary function]]s even though the sum on the left-hand side cannot. Then all the terms in the asymptotic series can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.  For example,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(z + k)^2} \\sim \\underbrace{\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{1}{(z + k)^2}\\,dk}_{= 1/z} + \\frac{1}{2z^2} + \\sum_{t = 1}^\\infty \\frac{B_{2t}}{z^{2t + 1}}.</math>\n\nHere the left-hand side is equal to <math>\\psi^{(1)}(z)</math>, namely the first-order [[Polygamma function#Series representation|polygamma function]] defined by <math>\\psi^{(1)}(z) = (d/dz)^2(\\log \\Gamma(z))</math>; the [[gamma function]] <math>\\Gamma(z) </math> is equal to <math>(z-1)! </math> if <math>z </math> is a [[positive integer]]. This results in an asymptotic expansion for <math>\\psi^{(1)}(z)</math>.  That expansion, in turn, serves as the starting point for one of the derivations of precise error estimates for [[Stirling's approximation]] of the [[factorial]] function.\n\n====Examples====\nIf {{mvar|s}} is an integer greater than 1 we have:\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k^s} \\approx \\frac 1{s-1}+\\frac 12-\\frac 1{(s-1)n^{s-1}}+\\frac 1{2n^s}+\\sum_{i=1}\\frac{B_{2i}}{(2i)!}\\left[\\frac{(s+2i-2)!}{(s-1)!}-\\frac{(s+2i-2)!}{(s-1)!n^{s+2i-1}}\\right].</math>\n\nCollecting the constants into a value of the [[Riemann zeta function]], we can write an asymptotic expansion:\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k^s} \\sim\\zeta(s)-\\frac 1{(s-1)n^{s-1}}+\\frac 1{2n^s}-\\sum_{i=1}\\frac{B_{2i}}{(2i)!}\\frac{(s+2i-2)!}{(s-1)!n^{s+2i-1}}.</math>\n\nFor {{mvar|s}} equal to 2 this simplifies to\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sim\\zeta(2)-\\frac 1n+\\frac 1{2n^2}-\\sum_{i=1}\\frac{B_{2i}}{n^{2i+1}},</math>\nor\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sim \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} -\\frac{1}{n} +\\frac{1}{2n^2} -\\frac{1}{6n^3}+\\frac{1}{30n^5}-\\frac{1}{42n^7} + \\cdots.</math>\n\nWhen {{math|s {{=}} 1}}, the corresponding technique gives an asymptotic expansion for the [[harmonic number]]s:\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k} \\sim \\gamma + \\log n + \\frac{1}{2n} - \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{B_{2k}}{2kn^{2k}},</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma \\approx 0.5772156649015328606065</math> is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].\n\n== Proofs ==\n\n=== Derivation by mathematical induction ===\nWe outline the argument given in Apostol.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal| first = T.

Gauss–Jacobi quadrature can be used to approximate integrals of the form\n\n:<math> \\int_{-1}^1 f(x) (1-x)^\\alpha (1+x)^\\beta \\,dx </math>\n\nwhere ƒ is a smooth function on [−1, 1] and ''α'', ''β'' > −1. The interval [−1, 1] can be replaced by any other interval by a linear transformation. Thus, Gauss–Jacobi quadrature can be used to approximate integrals with singularities at the end points. [[Gauss–Legendre quadrature]] is a special case of Gauss–Jacobi quadrature with ''α'' = ''β'' = 0. Similarly, the [[Chebyshev–Gauss quadrature]] of the first (second) kind arises when one takes ''α'' = ''β'' = -0.5 (+0.5).

      "text": "{{Short description|Numerical integration method}}\nThe '''Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula''' is an [[adaptive quadrature|adaptive method]] for [[numerical integration]]. It is a variant of [[Gaussian quadrature]], in which the evaluation points are chosen so that an accurate approximation can be computed by re-using the information produced by the computation of a less accurate approximation. It is an example of what is called a [[nested quadrature rule]]: for the same set of function evaluation points, it has two quadrature rules, one higher order and one lower order (the latter called an ''embedded'' rule). The difference between these two approximations is used to estimate the calculational error of the integration.\n\nThese formulas are named after [[Alexander Kronrod]], who invented them in the 1960s, and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe problem in numerical integration is to approximate definite integrals of the form\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nSuch integrals can be approximated, for example, by ''n''-point [[Gaussian quadrature]]\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i),</math>\n\nwhere ''w''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> are the weights and points at which to evaluate the function ''f''(''x'').\n\nIf the interval [''a'', ''b''] is subdivided, the Gauss evaluation points of the new subintervals never coincide with the previous evaluation points (except at the midpoint for odd numbers of evaluation points), and thus the integrand must be evaluated at every point. Gauss–Kronrod formulas are extensions of the Gauss quadrature formulas generated by adding <math>n+1</math> points to an <math>n</math>-point rule in such a way that the resulting rule is of order <math>2n+1</math> ({{harvtxt|Laurie|1997|loc=p. 1133}}; the corresponding Gauss rule is of order <math>2n-1</math>). These extra points are the zeros of [[Stieltjes polynomials]]. This allows for computing higher-order estimates while reusing the function values of a lower-order estimate. The difference between a Gauss quadrature rule and its Kronrod extension are often used as an estimate of the approximation error.\n\n== Example ==\nA popular example combines a 7-point Gauss rule with a 15-point Kronrod rule {{Harv|Kahaner|Moler|Nash|1989|loc=&sect;5.5}}. Because the Gauss points are incorporated into the Kronrod points, a total of only 15 function evaluations are needed.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white\"\n|+ (G7, K15) on [−1,1]\n|-\n!

Such a result is exact, since the green region has the same area as the sum of the red regions.]]\n\nIn [[numerical analysis]], a '''quadrature rule''' is an approximation of the [[integral|definite integral]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], usually stated as a [[weighted sum]] of function values at specified points within the domain of integration.\n(See [[numerical integration]] for more on [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] rules.) An ''n''-point '''Gaussian quadrature rule''', named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], is a quadrature rule constructed to yield an exact result for [[polynomial]]s of degree {{math|2''n'' − 1}} or less by a suitable choice of the nodes {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} and weights {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n''}}. The most common domain of integration for such a rule is taken as [−1,1], so the rule is stated as\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\\,dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i),</math>\n\nwhich is exact for polynomials of degree {{math|2''n''-1}} or less. This exact rule is known as the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. The quadrature rule will only be an accurate approximation to the integral above if ''f''(''x'') is well-approximated by a polynomial of degree {{math|2''n''-1}} or less on {{math|[-1,1]}}.\n\nThe Gauss-[[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] quadrature rule is not typically used for integrable functions with endpoint [[singularity (math)|singularities]]. Instead, if the integrand can be written as\n\n:<math>f(x) = (1-x)^\\alpha(1+x)^\\beta g(x),\\qquad \\alpha,\\beta >-1,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''g''(''x'')}} is well-approximated by a low-degree polynomial, then alternative nodes <math>x_i'</math> and weights <math>w_i'</math> will usually give more accurate quadrature rules. These are known as [[Gauss-Jacobi quadrature|Gauss-Jacobi]] quadrature rules, i.e.,\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\\,dx = \\int_{-1}^1 (1-x)^\\alpha(1+x)^\\beta g(x)\\,dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i' g(x_i').</math>\n\nCommon weights include <math>1/\\sqrt{1-x^2}</math> ([[Chebyshev–Gauss quadrature|Chebyshev–Gauss]]) and <math>\\sqrt{1-x^2}</math>. One may also want to integrate over semi-infinite ([[Gauss-Laguerre quadrature]]) and infinite intervals ([[Gauss–Hermite quadrature]]).\n\nIt can be shown (see Press, et al., or Stoer and Bulirsch) that the quadrature nodes {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} are the [[Root of a function|roots]] of a polynomial belonging to a class of [[orthogonal polynomials]] (the class orthogonal with respect to a weighted inner-product). This is a key observation for computing Gauss quadrature nodes and weights.\n\n== Gauss–Legendre quadrature == <!-- The section \"Other forms of Gaussian quadrature\" below links to this section -->\n[[File:Legendrepolynomials6.svg|thumb|Graphs of Legendre polynomials (up to ''n'' = 5)]]\n\nFor the simplest integration problem stated above, i.e., ''f''(''x'') is well-approximated by polynomials on <math>[-1,1]</math>, the associated orthogonal polynomials are [[Legendre polynomials]], denoted by ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''). With the {{mvar|n}}-th polynomial normalized to give ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1, the {{mvar|i}}-th Gauss node, {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}}, is the {{mvar|i}}-th root of {{mvar|P<sub>n</sub>}} and the weights are given by the formula {{Harv|Abramowitz|Stegun|1972|loc=p.&nbsp;887}}\n\n:<math> w_i = \\frac{2}{\\left( 1-x_i^2 \\right) [P'_n(x_i)]^2}.</math>\n\nSome low-order quadrature rules are tabulated below (over interval {{math|[−1, 1]}}, see the section below for other intervals).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; background:white;\"\n!

That is, the problem is to calculate\n\n:<math> \\int_a^b \\omega(x)\\,f(x)\\,dx </math>\n\nfor some choices of ''a'', ''b'', and ω. For ''a'' = −1, ''b'' = 1, and ω(''x'') = 1, the problem is the same as that considered above.\nOther choices lead to other integration rules. Some of these are tabulated below.

Furthermore, all these nodes {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} will lie in the open interval (''a'', ''b'') {{harv|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002|pp=172–175}}.\n\nThe polynomial {{mvar|p<sub>n</sub>}} is said to be an orthogonal polynomial of degree ''n'' associated to the weight function {{math|''ω''(''x'')}}. It is unique up to a constant normalization factor. The idea underlying the proof is that, because of its sufficiently low degree, {{math|''h''(''x'')}} can be divided by <math>p_n(x)</math> to produce a quotient {{math|''q''(''x'')}} of degree strictly lower than ''n'', and a remainder {{math|''r''(''x'')}} of still lower degree, so that both will be orthogonal to <math>p_n(x)</math>, by the defining property of <math>p_n(x)</math>. Thus\n\n:<math> \\int_a^b \\omega(x)\\,h(x)\\,dx = \\int_a^b \\omega(x)\\,r(x)\\,dx. </math>\n\nBecause of the choice of nodes ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, the corresponding relation\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i h(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i r(x_i)</math>\n\nholds also. The exactness of the computed integral for <math>h(x)</math> then follows from corresponding exactness for polynomials of degree only ''n'' or less (as is <math>r(x)</math>).\n\n====General formula for the weights ====\nThe weights can be expressed as\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>w_{i} = \\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}}\\frac{\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)p_{n-1}(x)^{2}dx}{p'_{n}(x_{i})p_{n-1}(x_{i})}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>a_{k}</math> is the coefficient of <math>x^{k}</math> in <math>p_{k}(x)</math>. To prove this, note that using [[Lagrange interpolation]] one can express {{math|''r''(''x'')}} in terms of <math>r(x_{i})</math> as\n\n:<math>r(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}r(x_{i})\\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\leq j\\leq n\\\\j\\neq i\\end{smallmatrix}}\\frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}</math>\n\nbecause {{math|''r''(''x'')}} has degree less than {{mvar|n}} and is thus fixed by the values it attains at {{mvar|n}} different points. Multiplying both sides by {{math|''ω''(''x'')}} and integrating from {{mvar|a}} to {{mvar|b}} yields\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)r(x)dx= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}r(x_{i})\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\leq j\\leq n\\\\j\\neq i\\end{smallmatrix}}\\frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}dx</math>\n\nThe weights {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} are thus given by\n\n:<math>w_{i} = \\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\leq j\\leq n\\\\j\\neq i\\end{smallmatrix}}\\frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}dx</math>\n\nThis integral expression for <math>w_{i}</math> can be expressed in terms of the orthogonal polynomials <math>p_{n}(x)</math> and <math>p_{n-1}(x)</math> as follows.\n\nWe can write\n\n:<math>\\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\leq j\\leq n\\\\j\\neq i\\end{smallmatrix}}\\left(x-x_{j}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{1\\leq j\\leq n} \\left(x - x_{j}\\right)}{x-x_{i}} = \\frac{p_{n}(x)}{a_{n}\\left(x-x_{i}\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>a_{n}</math> is the coefficient of <math>x^n</math> in <math>p_{n}(x)</math>. Taking the limit of x to <math>x_{i}</math> yields using L'Hôpital's rule\n\n:<math>\\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\leq j\\leq n\\\\j\\neq i\\end{smallmatrix}}\\left(x_{i}-x_{j}\\right) = \\frac{p'_{n}(x_{i})}{a_{n}}</math>\n\nWe can thus write the integral expression for the weights as\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>w_{i} = \\frac{1}{p'_{n}(x_{i})}\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\frac{p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}}dx</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nIn the integrand, writing\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{x-x_i} = \\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{x_i}\\right)^{k}}{x-x_i} + \\left(\\frac{x}{x_i}\\right)^{k} \\frac{1}{x-x_i}</math>\n\nyields\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b\\omega(x)\\frac{x^kp_n(x)}{x-x_i}dx= x_i^k\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\frac{p_n(x)}{x-x_i}dx</math>\n\nprovided <math>k\\leq n</math>, because\n\n:<math>\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{x_{i}}\\right)^{k}}{x-x_{i}}</math>\n\nis a polynomial of degree k-1 which is then orthogonal to <math>p_{n}(x)</math>. So, if {{math|''q''(''x'')}} is a polynomial of at most nth degree we have\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\frac{p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}}dx=\\frac{1}{q(x_{i})}\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\frac{q(x)p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}}dx </math>\n   \nWe can evaluate the integral on the right hand side for <math>q(x) = p_{n-1}(x)</math> as follows. Because <math>\\frac{p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}}</math> is a polynomial of degree n-1, we have\n\n:<math>\\frac{p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}} = a_{n}x^{n-1} + s(x)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''s''(''x'')}} is a polynomial of degree <math>n-2</math>. Since {{math|''s''(''x'')}} is orthogonal to <math>p_{n-1}(x)</math> we have\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\frac{p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}}dx=\\frac{a_{n}}{p_{n-1}(x_{i})}\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)p_{n-1}(x)x^{n-1}dx </math>\n\nWe can then write\n\n:<math>x^{n-1} = \\left(x^{n-1} - \\frac{p_{n-1}(x)}{a_{n-1}}\\right) + \\frac{p_{n-1}(x)}{a_{n-1}}</math>\n\nThe term in the brackets is a polynomial of degree <math>n-2</math>, which is therefore orthogonal to <math>p_{n-1}(x)</math>. The integral can thus be written as\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)\\frac{p_{n}(x)}{x-x_{i}}dx=\\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}p_{n-1}(x_{i})}\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)p_{n-1}(x)^{2}dx </math>\n\nAccording to equation ({{EquationNote|2}}), the weights are obtained by dividing this by <math>p'_{n}(x_{i})</math> and that yields the expression in equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).\n\n<math>w_{i}</math> can also be expressed in terms of the orthogonal polynomials <math>p_{n}(x)</math> and now <math>p_{n+1}(x)</math>. In the 3-term recurrence relation <math>p_{n+1}(x_{i}) = (a)p_{n}(x_{i})+(b)p_{n-1}(x_{i})</math> the term with <math>p_{n}(x_{i})</math> vanishes, so <math>p_{n-1}(x_{i})</math> in Eq. (1) can be replaced by <math>p_{n+1}(x_{i})/b</math>.\n\n====Proof that the weights are positive====\nConsider the following polynomial of degree <math>2n-2</math>\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\leq j\\leq n\\\\j\\neq i\\end{smallmatrix}}\\frac{(x-x_j)^2}\n   {(x_i-x_j)^2}</math>\n\nwhere, as above, the {{mvar|x<sub>j</sub>}} are the roots of the polynomial <math>p_{n}(x)</math>. \nClearly <math>f(x_j)= \\delta_{ij}</math>. Since the degree of <math>f(x)</math> is less than <math>2n-1</math>, the Gaussian quadrature formula involving the weights and nodes obtained from <math>p_{n}(x)</math> applies. Since <math>f(x_{j})=0</math> for j not equal to i, we have\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b}\\omega(x)f(x)dx=\\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{j}f(x_{j}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_{ij} w_j = w_{i} >0.</math>\n\nSince both <math>\\omega(x)</math> and <math>f(x)</math> are non-negative functions, it follows that <math>w_{i}>0</math>.\n\n=== Computation of Gaussian quadrature rules ===\nThere are many algorithms for computing the nodes {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} and weights {{mvar|w<sub>i</sub>}} of Gaussian quadrature rules. The most popular are the Golub-Welsch algorithm requiring ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>) operations, Newton's method for solving <math>p_n(x)=0</math> using the [[Orthogonal polynomials#Recurrence relation|three-term recurrence]] for evaluation requiring ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>) operations, and asymptotic formulas for large ''n'' requiring ''O''(''n'') operations.\n\n==== Recurrence relation ====\nOrthogonal polynomials <math>p_r</math> with <math>(p_r,p_s)=0</math> for <math>r\\ne s</math> for a scalar product <math>( , )</math>, degree<math>(p_r)=r</math> and leading coefficient one (i.e. [[monic polynomial|monic]] orthogonal polynomials) satisfy the recurrence relation\n\n:<math>p_{r+1}(x)=(x-a_{r,r})p_r(x)-a_{r,r-1}p_{r-1}(x)\\ldots-a_{r,0}p_0(x)</math>\n\nand scalar product defined\n\n:<math>(f(x),g(x))=\\int_a^b\\omega(x)f(x)g(x)dx</math>\n\nfor <math>r=0,1,\\ldots,n-1</math> where {{mvar|n}} is the maximal degree which can be taken to be infinity, and where <math>a_{r,s}=(xp_r,p_s)/(p_s,p_s)</math>. First of all, the polynomials defined by the recurrence relation starting with <math>p_0(x)=1</math> have leading coefficient one and correct degree. Given the starting point by <math>p_0</math>, the orthogonality of <math>p_r</math> can be shown by induction. For <math>r=s=0</math> one has\n\n:<math>(p_1,p_0)=(x-a_{0,0})(p_0,p_0)=(xp_0,p_0)-a_{0,0}(p_0,p_0)=(xp_0,p_0)-(xp_0,p_0)=0.</math>\n\nNow if <math>p_0,p_1,\\ldots,p_r</math> are orthogonal, then also <math>p_{r+1}</math>, because in\n\n:<math>(p_{r+1},p_s)=(xp_r,p_s)-a_{r,r}(p_r,p_s)-a_{r,r-1}(p_{r-1},p_s)\\ldots-a_{r,0}(p_0,p_s)</math>\n\nall scalar products vanish except for the first one and the one where <math>p_s</math> meets the same orthogonal polynomial. Therefore,\n\n:<math>(p_{r+1},p_s)=(xp_r,p_s)-a_{r,s}(p_s,p_s)=(xp_r,p_s)-(xp_r,p_s)=0.</math>\n\nHowever, if the scalar product satisfies <math>(xf,g)=(f,xg)</math> (which is the case for Gaussian quadrature), the recurrence relation reduces to a three-term recurrence relation: For <math>s < r-1, xp_s</math> is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to {{math|''r'' − 1}}. On the other hand, <math>p_r</math> is orthogonal to every polynomial of degree less than or equal to {{math|''r'' − 1}}. Therefore, one has <math>(xp_r,p_s)=(p_r,xp_s)=0</math> and <math>a_{r,s}=0</math> for {{math|''s'' < ''r'' − 1}}. The recurrence relation then simplifies to\n\n:<math>p_{r+1}(x)=(x-a_{r,r})p_r(x)-a_{r,r-1}p_{r-1}(x)</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>p_{r+1}(x)=(x-a_r)p_r(x)-b_rp_{r-1}(x)</math>\n\n(with the convention <math>p_{-1}(x)\\equiv 0</math>) where\n\n:<math>a_r:=\\frac{(xp_r,p_r)}{(p_r,p_r)},\\qquad b_r:=\\frac{(xp_r,p_{r-1})}{(p_{r-1},p_{r-1})}=\\frac{(p_r,p_r)}{(p_{r-1},p_{r-1})}</math>\n\n(the last because of <math>(xp_r,p_{r-1})=(p_r,xp_{r-1})=(p_r,p_r)</math>, since <math>xp_{r-1}</math> differs from <math>p_r</math> by a degree less than {{mvar|r}}).\n\n==== The Golub-Welsch algorithm ====\nThe three-term recurrence relation can be written in matrix form <math>J\\tilde{P}=x\\tilde{P}-p_n(x)\\times\\mathbf{e}_n</math> where <math>\\tilde{P}=[p_0(x),p_1(x),...,p_{n-1}(x)]^{T}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{e}_n</math> is the <math>n</math>th standard basis vector, i.e., <math>\\mathbf{e}_n=[0,...,0,1]^{T}</math>, and {{mvar|J}} is the so-called Jacobi matrix:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}=\\begin{pmatrix}\na_0      & 1       & 0      & \\ldots  & \\ldots  & \\ldots\\\\\nb_1      & a_1     & 1      & 0       & \\ldots  & \\ldots \\\\\n0        & b_2     & a_2    & 1       & 0       & \\ldots \\\\\n0   & \\ldots  & \\ldots & \\ldots  & \\ldots  & 0 \\\\\n\\ldots   & \\ldots  & 0 & b_{n-2}  & a_{n-2}  & 1 \\\\\n\\ldots   & \\ldots  & \\ldots & 0  & b_{n-1}  & a_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nThe zeros <math>x_j</math> of the polynomials up to degree {{mvar|n}}, which are used as nodes for the Gaussian quadrature can be found by computing the eigenvalues of this [[tridiagonal matrix]]. This procedure is known as ''Golub–Welsch algorithm''.\n\nFor computing the weights and nodes, it is preferable to consider the symmetric tridiagonal matrix <math>\\mathcal{J}</math> with elements\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}_{i,i} &=J_{i,i}=a_{i-1} && i=1,\\ldots,n \\\\ \n\\mathcal{J}_{i-1,i}=\\mathcal{J}_{i,i-1} &=\\sqrt{J_{i,i-1}J_{i-1,i}}=\\sqrt{b_{i-1}} && i=2,\\ldots,n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{math|'''J'''}} and <math>\\mathcal{J}</math> are [[similar matrices]] and therefore have the same eigenvalues (the nodes). The weights can be computed from the corresponding eigenvectors: If <math>\\phi^{(j)}</math> is a normalized eigenvector (i.e., an eigenvector with euclidean norm equal to one) associated to the eigenvalue {{mvar|x<sub>j</sub>}}, the corresponding weight can be computed from the first component of this eigenvector, namely:\n\n:<math>w_j=\\mu_0 \\left(\\phi_1^{(j)}\\right)^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the integral of the weight function\n\n:<math>\\mu_0=\\int_a^b \\omega(x) dx.</math>\n\nSee, for instance, {{harv|Gil|Segura|Temme|2007}} for further details.\n\n=== Error estimates ===\nThe error of a Gaussian quadrature rule can be stated as follows {{harv|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002|loc=Thm&nbsp;3.6.24}}. For an integrand which has {{math|2''n''}} continuous derivatives,\n\n:<math> \\int_a^b \\omega(x)\\,f(x)\\,dx - \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\\,f(x_i) = \\frac{f^{(2n)}(\\xi)}{(2n)!} \\, (p_n,p_n) </math>\n\nfor some {{mvar|ξ}} in {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, where {{mvar|p<sub>n</sub>}} is the monic (i.e. the leading coefficient is 1) orthogonal polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} and where\n\n:<math> (f,g) = \\int_a^b \\omega(x) f(x) g(x) \\, dx.</math>\n\nIn the important special case of {{math|''ω''(''x'') {{=}} 1}}, we have the error estimate {{Harv|Kahaner|Moler|Nash|1989|loc=&sect;5.2}}\n\n:<math> \\frac{(b-a)^{2n+1} (n!)^4}{(2n+1)[(2n)!]^3} f^{(2n)} (\\xi) , \\qquad a < \\xi < b.</math>\n\nStoer and Bulirsch remark that this error estimate is inconvenient in practice, since it may be difficult to estimate the order 2''n'' derivative, and furthermore the actual error may be much less than a bound established by the derivative. Another approach is to use two Gaussian quadrature rules of different orders, and to estimate the error as the difference between the two results. For this purpose, Gauss–Kronrod quadrature rules can be useful.\n\n=== Gauss–Kronrod rules ===\n{{main|Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula}}\n\nIf the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is subdivided, the Gauss evaluation points of the new subintervals never coincide with the previous evaluation points (except at zero for odd numbers), and thus the integrand must be evaluated at every point. ''Gauss–Kronrod rules'' are extensions of Gauss quadrature rules generated by adding {{math|''n'' + 1}} points to an {{mvar|n}}-point rule in such a way that the resulting rule is of order {{math|2''n'' + 1}}. This allows for computing higher-order estimates while re-using the function values of a lower-order estimate. The difference between a Gauss quadrature rule and its Kronrod extension is often used as an estimate of the approximation error.\n\n=== Gauss–Lobatto rules ===\nAlso known as '''Lobatto quadrature''' {{Harv|Abramowitz|Stegun|1972|loc=p.&nbsp;888}}, named after Dutch mathematician [[Rehuel Lobatto]]. It is similar to Gaussian quadrature with the following differences:\n# The integration points include the end points of the integration interval.\n# It is accurate for polynomials up to degree 2''n''–3, where ''n'' is the number of integration points {{harv|Quarteroni|Sacco|Saleri|2000}}.\n\nLobatto quadrature of function ''f''(''x'') on interval {{math|[−1, 1]}}:\n\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 {f(x) \\, dx} = \\frac {2} {n(n-1)}[f(1) + f(-1)] + \\sum_{i = 2} ^{n-1} {w_i f(x_i)} + R_n.</math>\n\nAbscissas: {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} is the <math>(i-1)</math>st zero of <math>P'_{n-1}(x)</math>.\n\nWeights:\n\n:<math>w_i = \\frac{2}{n(n-1)[P_{n-1}(x_i)]^2}, \\qquad x_i \\ne \\pm 1.</math>\n\nRemainder:\n\n:<math>R_n = \\frac{- n (n-1)^3 2^{2n-1} [(n-2)!]^4}{(2n-1) [(2n-2)!]^3} f^{(2n-2)}(\\xi), \\qquad -1 < \\xi < 1.</math>\n\nSome of the weights are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; background:white;\"\n!

The grid is constructed so to have [[octahedral symmetry|octahedral rotation]] and inversion symmetry. The number and location of the grid points together with a corresponding set of integration weights are determined by enforcing the exact integration of [[polynomial]]s (or equivalently, [[spherical harmonics]]) up to a given order, leading to a sequence of increasingly dense grids analogous to the one-dimensional  [[Gaussian quadrature|Gauss-Legendre]] scheme.\n\nThe Lebedev grid is often employed in the numerical evaluation of volume integrals in the [[spherical coordinate system]], where it is combined with a one-dimensional integration scheme for the radial coordinate.

      "text": "[[File:Simpson rule.png|thumb|Newton–Cotes formula for&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2]]\nIn [[numerical analysis]], the '''Newton–Cotes formulas''', also called the '''Newton–Cotes quadrature rules''' or simply '''Newton–Cotes rules''', are a group of formulas  for [[numerical integration]] (also called ''quadrature'') based on evaluating the integrand at  equally spaced points. They are named after [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Roger Cotes]].\n\nNewton–Cotes formulas can be useful if the value of the integrand at equally spaced points is given. If it is possible to change the points at which the integrand is evaluated, then other methods such as [[Gaussian quadrature]] and [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]] are probably more suitable.\n\n==Description==\n\nIt is assumed that the value of a function ''f'' defined on [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] is known at equally spaced points ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, for ''i'' = 0, ..., ''n'', where ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= ''a'' and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= ''b''. There are two types of Newton–Cotes formulas, the \"closed\" type which uses the function value at all points, and the \"open\" type which does not use the function values at the endpoints. The closed Newton–Cotes formula of degree ''n'' is stated as\n\n: <math>\\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^n w_i\\, f(x_i)</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''h'' ''i'' + ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, with ''h'' (called the ''step size'') equal to {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>''n''</sub> &minus; ''x''<sub>0</sub>)&thinsp;/&thinsp;''n'' {{=}} (''b'' &minus; ''a'')&thinsp;/&thinsp;''n''}}. The ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> are called ''weights''.\n\nAs can be seen in the following derivation the weights are derived from the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange basis polynomial]]s. They depend only on the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> and not on the function ''f''. Let ''L''(''x'') be the interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form for the given data points {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)&thinsp;), …, (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)&thinsp;)}}, then\n\n: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\approx \\int_a^b L(x)\\,dx = \\int_a^b \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i)\\, l_i(x) \\right) \\, dx\n= \\sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) \\underbrace{\\int_a^b l_i(x)\\, dx}_{w_i}. </math>\n\nThe open Newton–Cotes formula of degree ''n'' is stated as\n\n: <math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} w_i\\, f(x_i).</math>\n\nThe weights are found in a manner similar to the closed formula.\n\n==Instability for high degree==\n\nA Newton–Cotes formula of any degree ''n'' can be constructed. However, for large ''n'' a Newton–Cotes rule can sometimes suffer from catastrophic [[Runge's phenomenon]] where the error grows exponentially for large ''n''. Methods such as Gaussian quadrature and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature with unequally spaced points (clustered at the ''endpoints'' of the integration interval) are stable and much more accurate, and are normally preferred to Newton–Cotes. If these methods cannot be used, because the integrand is only given at the fixed equidistributed grid, then Runge's phenomenon can be avoided by using a composite rule, as explained below.\n\nAlternatively, stable Newton–Cotes formulas can be constructed using least-squares approximation instead of interpolation. This allows building numerically stable formulas even for high degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-integration/stable-newton-cotes-formulas/|title=Stable Newton-Cotes Formulas|author=Pavel Holoborodko|date=2011-03-24|accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-integration/stable-newton-cotes-formulas-open-type/|title=Stable Newton-Cotes Formulas (Open Type)|author=Pavel Holoborodko|date=2012-05-20|accessdate=2015-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Closed Newton–Cotes formulas==\nThis table lists some of the Newton–Cotes formulas of the closed type.

The degree of the derivative of ''f'' in the error term gives the degree up to which polynomials can be integrated exactly (i.e., with error equal to zero) with this rule. Note that the derivative of ''f'' in the error term increases by 2 for every other rule.

For this reason, one usually performs numerical integration by splitting <math>[a, b]</math> into smaller subintervals, applying a Newton–Cotes rule on each subinterval, and adding up the results. This is called a ''composite rule''.

The continuous problem is broken into <math>n</math> discrete intervals; quadrature or [[numerical integration]] determines the weights and locations of representative points for the integral.\n\nThe problem becomes a [[system of linear equations]] with <math>n</math> equations and <math>n</math> unknowns, and the underlying function is implicitly represented by an interpolation using the chosen quadrature rule.  This discrete problem may be ill-conditioned, depending on the original problem and the chosen quadrature rule. \n\nSince the linear equations require <math>O(n^3)</math> operations to solve, high-order quadrature rules perform better because low-order quadrature rules require large <math>n</math> for a given accuracy.  [[Gaussian quadrature]] is normally a good choice for smooth, non-singular problems.\n\n== Discretization of the integral ==\n\nStandard quadrature methods seek to represent an integral as a weighed sum in the following manner:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b h (x) \\;\\mathrm d x \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^n w_k h (x_k)</math>\n\nwhere <math>w_k</math> are the weights of the quadrature rule, and points <math>x_k</math> are the abscissas.\n\n== Example ==\n\nApplying this to the inhomogeneous [[Fredholm equation]] of the second kind\n\n:<math>f (x) = \\lambda u (x) - \\int_a^b K (x, x') f (x') \\;\\mathrm d x'</math>,\n\nresults in\n\n:<math>f (x) \\approx \\lambda u (x) - \\sum_{k=1}^n w_k K (x, x_k) f (x_k)</math>.\n\n== Sampling for Nyström method==\n\nThe most important step of the Nyström method is sampling, because different sampled landmark points give different approximations of the original matrix.\n\nUniform sampling without replacement is the most used approach for this purpose, where every point has the same probability of being included in the sample.\n\n===Minimum Sum of Squared Similarities Sampling (MSSS)===\nMSSS is a non-uniform sampling approach that considers both the variance and the similarity of the data distribution in its sampling data, which approximately maximizes the determinant of the reduced similarity matrix that represents the mutual similarities between sampled data points.

      "text": "{{about|the numerical integration method|the neurological examination maneuver|Romberg's test}}\n\nIn [[numerical analysis]], '''Romberg's method''' {{Harv|Romberg|1955}} is used to estimate the [[Integral|definite integral]]\n\n:<math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math>\n\nby applying [[Richardson extrapolation]] {{Harv|Richardson|1911}} repeatedly on the [[trapezium rule]] or the [[rectangle rule]] (midpoint rule). The estimates generate a triangular array.  Romberg's method is a [[Newton–Cotes formulas|Newton–Cotes formula]] – it evaluates the integrand at equally spaced points.\nThe integrand must have continuous derivatives, though fairly good results\nmay be obtained if only a few derivatives exist.\nIf it is possible to evaluate the integrand at unequally spaced points, then other methods such as [[Gaussian quadrature]] and [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]] are generally more accurate.\n\nThe method is named after [[Werner Romberg]] (1909–2003), who published the method in 1955.\n\n== Method ==\nUsing\n\n:<math>h_n = \\tfrac{1}{2^n}(b-a)</math>\n\nthe method can be inductively defined by\n\n:<math>R(0,0) = h_1 (f(a) + f(b))</math>\n\n:<math>R(n,0) = \\tfrac{1}{2} R(n-1,0) + h_n \\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} f(a + (2k-1)h_n) </math>\n\n:<math>R(n,m) = R(n,m-1) + \\tfrac{1}{4^{m}-1} (R(n,m-1) - R(n-1,m-1)) </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>R(n,m) = \\tfrac{1}{4^{m}-1} ( 4^{m} R(n,m-1) - R(n-1,m-1))</math>\n\nwhere <math> n \\ge m \\, </math> and <math> m \\ge 1 \\, </math>. \nIn [[big O notation]], the error for ''R''(''n'',&nbsp;''m'') is {{Harv|Mysovskikh|2002}}:\n\n:<math> O\\left(h_n^{2m+2}\\right). \\, </math>\n\nThe zeroeth extrapolation, ''R''(''n'',&nbsp;0), is equivalent to the [[trapezoidal rule]] with 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points; the first extrapolation, ''R''(''n'',&nbsp;1), is equivalent to [[Simpson's rule]] with 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points. The second extrapolation, ''R''(''n'',&nbsp;2), is equivalent to [[Boole's rule]] with 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points. Further extrapolations differ from Newton Cotes formulas. In particular further Romberg extrapolations expand on Boole's rule in very slight ways, modifying weights into ratios similar as in Boole's rule. In contrast, further Newton Cotes methods produce increasingly  differing weights, eventually leading to large positive and negative weights. This is indicative of how large degree interpolating polynomial Newton Cotes methods fail to converge for many integrals, while Romberg integration is more stable.\n\nWhen function evaluations are expensive, it may be preferable to replace the polynomial interpolation of Richardson with the rational interpolation proposed by {{Harvtxt|Bulirsch|Stoer|1967}}.\n\n== A geometric example ==\nTo estimate the area under a curve the trapezoid rule is applied first to one-piece, then two, then four, and so on.\n[[File:One-piece Trapezoid Approximation.svg|alt=One-piece approximation|thumb|One-piece.

      "text": "'''Tanh-Sinh quadrature''' is a method for [[numerical integration]] introduced by Hidetosi Takahasi and Masatake Mori in 1974.<ref>{{harvtxt|Takahasi|Mori|1974}}</ref> It uses [[hyperbolic function]]s in the [[change of variables]]\n\n:<math>x = \\tanh(\\tfrac12 \\pi \\sinh t)\\,</math>\n\nto transform an integral on the interval ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;(−1, +1) to an integral on the entire [[real line]] ''t''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;(−∞,+∞), the two integrals having the same value. After this transformation, the integrand decays with a [[Double exponential function|double exponential]] rate, and thus, this method is also known as the '''Double Exponential (DE) formula'''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mori|2005}}</ref>\n\nFor a given step size ''h'', the integral is approximated by the sum\n:<math>\\int_{-1}^1 f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^\\infty w_k f(x_k),</math>\n\nwith the [[abscissas]]\n:<math>x_k = \\tanh(\\tfrac12 \\pi \\sinh kh)</math>\nand the weights\n:<math>w_k = \\frac{\\tfrac12 h \\pi \\cosh kh}{\\cosh^2(\\tfrac12 \\pi \\sinh kh)}.</math>\n\nThe Tanh-Sinh method is quite insensitive to endpoint behavior. Should singularities or infinite derivatives exist at one or both endpoints of the (-1,+1) interval, these are mapped to the (−∞,+∞) endpoints of the transformed interval, forcing the endpoint singularities and infinite derivatives to vanish. This results in a great enhancement of the accuracy of the numerical integration procedure, which is typically performed by the Trapezoidal Rule. In most cases, the transformed integrand displays a rapid roll-off (decay), enabling the numerical integrator to quickly achieve convergence. \n\nLike [[Gaussian quadrature]], Tanh-Sinh quadrature is well suited for [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary-precision]] integration, where an accuracy of hundreds or even thousands of digits is desired. The [[rate of convergence|convergence]] is exponential (in the discretization sense) for sufficiently well-behaved integrands: doubling the number of evaluation points roughly doubles the number of correct digits.\n\nTanh-Sinh quadrature is not as efficient as Gaussian quadrature for smooth integrands, but unlike Gaussian quadrature, tends to work equally well with integrands having singularities or infinite derivatives at one or both endpoints of the integration interval as already noted. Furthermore, Tanh-Sinh quadrature can be implemented in a progressive manner, with the step size halved each time the rule level is raised, and reusing the function values calculated on previous levels. A further advantage is that the abscissas and weights are relatively simple to compute. The cost of calculating abscissa–weight pairs  for ''n''-digit accuracy is roughly ''n''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup> ''n'' compared to ''n''<sup>3</sup> log ''n'' for Gaussian quadrature.\n\nBailey and others have done extensive research on Tanh-Sinh quadrature, Gaussian quadrature and Error Function quadrature, as well as several of the classical quadrature methods, and found that the classical methods are not competitive with the first three methods, particularly when high-precision results are required. In a conference paper presented at RNC5 on Real Numbers and Computers (Sept 2003), when comparing Tanh-Sinh quadrature with Gaussian quadrature and Error Function quadrature, Bailey and Li found: \"Overall, the Tanh-Sinh scheme appears to be the best. It combines uniformly excellent accuracy with fast run times. ''It is the nearest we have to a truly all-purpose quadrature scheme at the present time.''\"\n\nUpon comparing the scheme to Gaussian quadrature and [[Error Function quadrature]], Bailey et al. (2005) found that the Tanh-Sinh scheme \"appears to be the best for integrands of the type most often encountered in experimental math research\".\n\nBailey (2006) found that: \"The Tanh-Sinh quadrature scheme ''is the fastest currently known high-precision quadrature scheme'', particularly when one counts the time for computing abscissas and weights. It has been successfully employed for quadrature calculations of up to 20,000-digit precision.\"\n\nIn summary, the Tanh-Sinh quadrature scheme is designed so that it gives the most accurate result for the minimum number of function evaluations. In practice, the Tanh-Sinh quadrature rule is almost invariably the best rule and is often the only effective rule when extended precision results are sought.\n\n==Implementations==\n\nTanh-Sinh, exp-sinh, and sinh-sinh quadrature are implemented in the [[C++]] library Boost<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Double-exponential quadrature|url=http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/double_exponential.html|website=boost.org|last1=Thompson|first1=Nick|last2=Maddock|first2=John}}</ref>\n\nTanh-Sinh quadrature is implemented in a [[Excel macro|macro-enabled Excel]] spreadsheet by Graeme F.

The integral can be even better approximated by [[Partition of an interval|partitioning the integration interval]], applying the trapezoidal rule to each subinterval, and summing the results.

This can also be seen from the geometric picture: the trapezoids include all of the area under the curve and extend over it. Similarly, a [[concave-down]] function yields an underestimate because area is unaccounted for under the curve, but none is counted above. If the interval of the integral being approximated includes an inflection point,  the error is harder to identify.\n\n=== Proof ===\nFirst suppose that <math>h=\\frac{b-a}{N}</math> , <math>a_k=a+(k-1)h</math>, and <math> g_k(t)=\\frac{1}{2}t[f(a_k)+f(a_k+t)]-\\int_{a_k}^{a_k+t}f(x)dx</math>\n\nThen:\n\n<math> {dg_k \\over dt}={1 \\over 2}[f(a_k)+f(a_k+t)]+{1\\over2}t\\cdot f'(a_k+t)-f(a_k+t)</math>\n\n<math> {d^2g_k \\over dt^2}={1\\over 2}t\\cdot f''(a_k+t)</math>\n\nand suppose that  <math> \\left\\vert f''(x) \\right\\vert \\leq f''(\\xi)</math>, so that:\n\n<math> \\left\\vert f''(a_k+t) \\right\\vert \\leq f''(\\xi)</math>, <math> -f''(\\xi) \\leq f''(a_k+t) \\leq f''(\\xi)</math>\n\n<math> -\\frac{f''(\\xi)t}{2} \\leq g_k''(t) \\leq \\frac{f''(\\xi)t}{2}</math>\n\nBecause of <math> g_k'(0)=0</math>, <math> g_k(0)=0</math>\n\n<math> \\int_0^tg_k''(x)dx=g_k'(t)</math>, <math> \\int_0^tg_k'(x)dx=g_k(t)</math>\n\nso that:\n\n<math> -\\frac{f''(\\xi)t^2}{4} \\leq g_k'(t) \\leq \\frac{f''(\\xi)t^2}{4}</math>\n\n<math> -\\frac{f''(\\xi)t^3}{12} \\leq g_k(t) \\leq \\frac{f''(\\xi)t^3}{12}</math>\n\nThen assign h to t.\n\n<math> -\\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3}{12} \\leq g_k(h) \\leq \\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3}{12}</math>\n\nAnd:\n\n<math> \\sum_{k=1}^{N}g_k(h)=\\frac{b-a}{N} \\left[ {f(a) + f(b) \\over 2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} f \\left( a+k \\frac{b-a}{N} \\right) \\right]-\\int_a^bf(x)dx</math>, <math> \\sum_{k=1}^N \\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3}{12}=\\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3N}{12}</math>\n\nSo that:\n\n<math> -\\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3N}{12} \\leq \\frac{b-a}{N} \\left[ {f(a) + f(b) \\over 2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} f \\left( a+k \\frac{b-a}{N} \\right) \\right]-\\int_a^bf(x)dx \\leq \\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3N}{12}</math>\n\n<math> \\text{error}=\\int_a^bf(x)dx - \\frac{b-a}{N} \\left[ {f(a) + f(b) \\over 2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} f \\left( a+k \\frac{b-a}{N} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{f''(\\xi)h^3N}{12}=\\frac{f''(\\xi)(b-a)^3}{12N^2}</math>\n\nIn general, three techniques are used in the analysis of error:<ref name=\"w0223\">{{Harv|Weideman|2002|loc=p. 23, section 2}}</ref>\n# [[Fourier series]]\n#[[Residue calculus]]\n#[[Euler–Maclaurin summation formula]]:<ref>{{harvtxt|Atkinson|1989|loc=equation (5.1.9)}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Atkinson|1989|loc=p. 285}}</ref>\nAn asymptotic error estimate for ''N'' → ∞ is given by\n:<math> \\text{error} = -\\frac{(b-a)^2}{12N^2} \\big[ f'(b)-f'(a) \\big] + O(N^{-3}). </math>\nFurther terms in this error estimate are given by the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula.\n\nIt is argued that the speed of convergence of the trapezoidal rule reflects and can be used as a definition of classes of smoothness of the functions.<ref name=\"rs90\" />\n\n=== Periodic and peak functions ===\nThe trapezoidal rule converges rapidly for periodic functions.

This requires our increment function be sufficiently well-behaved.\n\nThe global truncation error satisfies the recurrence relation:\n:<math> e_{n+1} = e_n + h \\Big( A(t_n, y(t_n), h, f) - A(t_n, y_n, h, f) \\Big) + \\tau_{n+1}. </math>\nThis follows immediately from the definitions. Now assume that the increment function is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] in the second argument, that is, there exists a constant <math>L</math> such that for all <math>t</math> and <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math>, we have:\n:<math> | A(t,y_1,h,f) - A(t,y_2,h,f) | \\le L |y_1-y_2|. </math>\nThen the global error satisfies the bound\n:<math> | e_n | \\le \\frac{\\max_j \\tau_j}{hL} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{L(t_n-t_0)} - 1 \\right). </math><ref>{{harvnb|Süli|Mayers|2003|p=318}}</ref>\n\nIt follows from the above bound for the global error that if the function <math> f </math> in the differential equation is continuous in the first argument and Lipschitz continuous in the second argument (the condition from the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]), and the increment function <math> A </math> is continuous in all arguments and Lipschitz continuous in the second argument, then the global error tends to zero as the step size <math> h </math> approaches zero (in other words, the numerical method converges to the exact solution).<ref>{{harvnb|Süli|Mayers|2003|p=322}}</ref>\n\n== Extension to linear multistep methods ==\nNow consider a [[linear multistep method]], given by the formula\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n& y_{n+s} + a_{s-1} y_{n+s-1} + a_{s-2} y_{n+s-2} + \\cdots + a_0 y_n \\\\\n& \\qquad {} = h \\bigl( b_s f(t_{n+s},y_{n+s}) + b_{s-1} f(t_{n+s-1},y_{n+s-1}) + \\cdots + b_0 f(t_n,y_n) \\bigr),\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus, the next value for the numerical solution is computed according to\n: <math> y_{n+s} =  - \\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} a_{k} y_{n+k} + h \\sum_{k=0}^s b_k f(t_{n+k}, y_{n+k}). </math>\nThe next iterate of a linear multistep method depends on the previous ''s'' iterates. Thus, in the definition for the local truncation error, it is now assumed that the previous ''s'' iterates all correspond to the exact solution:\n: <math> \\tau_n = y(t_{n+s}) + \\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} a_{k} y(t_{n+k}) - h \\sum_{k=0}^s b_k f(t_{n+k}, y(t_{n+k})). </math><ref>{{harvnb|Süli|Mayers|2003|p=337}}, uses a different definition, dividing this by essentially by ''h''</ref>\nAgain, the method is consistent if <math> \\tau_n = o(h) </math> and it has order ''p'' if <math> \\tau_n = O(h^{p+1}) </math>. The definition of the global truncation error is also unchanged.\n\nThe relation between local and global truncation errors is slightly different from in the simpler setting of one-step methods. For linear multistep methods, an additional concept called [[zero-stability]] is needed to explain the relation between local and global truncation errors. Linear multistep methods that satisfy the condition of zero-stability have the same relation between local and global errors as one-step methods. In other words, if a linear multistep method is zero-stable and consistent, then it converges. And if a linear multistep method is zero-stable and has local error <math> \\tau_n = O(h^{p+1}) </math>, then its global error satisfies <math> e_n = O(h^p) </math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Süli|Mayers|2003|p=340}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Order of accuracy]]\n* [[Numerical integration]]\n* [[Numerical ordinary differential equations]]\n* [[Truncation error]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Iserles | first1=Arieh | author1-link=Arieh Iserles | title=A First Course in the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-55655-2 | year=1996}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Süli | first1=Endre | last2=Mayers | first2=David | title=An Introduction to Numerical Analysis | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=0521007941 | year=2003}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://livetoad.org/Courses/Documents/03e0/Notes/truncation_error.pdf Notes on truncation errors and Runge-Kutta methods]\n* [http://www.math.unl.edu/~gledder1/Math447/EulerError Truncation error of Euler's method]\n\n[[Category:Numerical integration (quadrature)]]"

These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly ''include'' coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but ''exclude'' coastal and territorial waters for China.\n\n----\n\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute for world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations<ref name=\"31 Years of CIA World Factbook\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfb/|title=31 Years of CIA World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> against the information for United States on ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', particularly its footnote section.<ref name=\"United States\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States|title=United States|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2017-12-04}}</ref> In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the US was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 sq km. However, in the 1997 edition, the US added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 sq km). And then again in 2007, US added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 sq km). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, ''no'' coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362 sq km, and a territorial water area of 195,213 sq km, for a total of 304,575 sq km of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Adding this figure to the US will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.\n\n|name=\"3rd-largest\"|group=\"Note\"}}\n|-\n<!--Before making changes to the US and China ranking and size please read the talk page.
