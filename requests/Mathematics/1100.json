      "text": "{{Distinguish|Whitehead problem}}\n\nIn [[homotopy theory]] (a branch of [[mathematics]]), the '''Whitehead theorem''' states that if a [[continuous mapping]] ''f'' between [[CW complex]]es ''X'' and ''Y'' induces [[isomorphism]]s on all [[homotopy group]]s, then ''f'' is a [[homotopy equivalence]]. This result was proved by [[J. H. C. Whitehead]] in two landmark papers from 1949, and provides a justification for working with the concept of a CW complex that he introduced there. It is a model result of [[algebraic topology]], in which the behavior of certain algebraic invariants (in this case, homotopy groups) determines a topological property of a mapping.\n\n== Statement ==\n\nIn more detail, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[topological space]]s. Given a continuous mapping\n\n:<math>f\\colon X \\to Y</math>\n\nand a point ''x'' in ''X'', consider for any ''n'' ≥ 1 the induced [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]]\n\n:<math>f_*\\colon \\pi_n(X,x) \\to \\pi_n(Y,f(x)),</math>\n\nwhere π<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'',''x'') denotes the ''n''-th homotopy group of ''X'' with base point ''x''. (For ''n'' = 0, π<sub>0</sub>(''X'') just means the set of [[path component]]s of ''X''.) A map ''f'' is a '''weak homotopy equivalence''' if the function\n\n:<math>f_*\\colon \\pi_0(X) \\to \\pi_0(Y)</math>\n\nis [[bijective]], and the homomorphisms ''f''<sub>*</sub> are bijective for all ''x'' in ''X'' and all ''n'' ≥ 1. (For ''X'' and ''Y'' [[path-connected]], the first condition is automatic, and it suffices to state the second condition for a single point ''x'' in ''X''.) The Whitehead theorem states that a weak homotopy equivalence from one CW complex to another is a homotopy equivalence. (That is, the map ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' has a homotopy inverse ''g'': ''Y'' → ''X'', which is not at all clear from the assumptions.) This implies the same conclusion for spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' that are homotopy equivalent to CW complexes.\n\nCombining this with the [[Hurewicz theorem]] yields a useful corollary: a continuous map <math>f\\colon X \\to Y</math> between [[simply connected]] CW complexes that induces an isomorphism on all integral [[singular homology|homology]] groups is a homotopy equivalence.\n\n== Spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups may not be homotopy equivalent ==\n\nA word of caution: it is not enough to assume π<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') is isomorphic to π<sub>''n''</sub>(''Y'') for each ''n'' in order to conclude that ''X'' and ''Y'' are homotopy equivalent. One really needs a map  ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' inducing an isomorphism on homotopy groups. For instance, take ''X''= [[Hypersphere|''S''<sup>2</sup>]] × [[real projective space|'''RP'''<sup>3</sup>]] and ''Y''= '''RP'''<sup>2</sup> × ''S''<sup>3</sup>. Then ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same [[fundamental group]], namely the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''/2, and the same universal cover, namely ''S''<sup>2</sup> × ''S''<sup>3</sup>;  thus, they have isomorphic homotopy groups. On the other hand their homology groups are different (as can be seen from the [[Künneth theorem|Künneth formula]]); thus, ''X'' and ''Y'' are not homotopy equivalent. \n\nThe Whitehead theorem does not hold for general topological spaces or even for all subspaces of '''R<sup>n</sup>'''. For example, the [[Warsaw circle]], a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the plane, has all homotopy groups zero, but the map from the Warsaw circle to a single point is not a homotopy equivalence. The study of possible generalizations of Whitehead's theorem to more general spaces is part of the subject of [[shape theory (mathematics)|shape theory]].\n\n== Generalization to model categories ==\nIn any [[model category]], a weak equivalence between cofibrant-fibrant objects is a homotopy equivalence.\n\n==References==\n* J.

John Thompson pointed out that a proof avoiding the use of representation theory could be extracted from his work on the N-group theorem, and this was done explicitly by {{harvtxt|Goldschmidt|1970}} for groups of odd order, and by {{harvtxt|Bender|1972}} for groups of even order. {{harvtxt|Matsuyama|1973}} simplified the proofs.\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is by [[Proof by contradiction|contradiction]]. Let ''p<sup>a</sup>q<sup>b</sup>'' be the smallest product of two prime powers, such that there is a non-solvable group ''G'' whose order is equal to this number.\n:*'''G is a [[simple group]] with trivial [[Center (group theory)|center]] and ''a'' is not zero.'''\nIf ''G'' had a [[Trivial group|nontrivial]] proper [[normal subgroup]] ''H'', then (because of the minimality of ''G''), ''H'' and ''G''/''H'' would be solvable, so ''G'' as well, which would contradict our assumption. So ''G'' is simple.\n\nIf ''a'' were zero, ''G'' would be a finite [[p-group|q-group]], hence [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]], and therefore solvable.\n\nSimilarly, ''G'' cannot be abelian, otherwise it would be nilpotent. As ''G'' is simple, its center must therefore be trivial.\n\n:* '''There is an element ''g'' of ''G'' which has ''q<sup>d</sup>'' [[Conjugacy class|conjugates]], for some ''d'' > 0.'''\n\nBy the first statement of [[Sylow theorems|Sylow's theorem]], ''G'' has a [[subgroup]] ''S'' of order ''p<sup>a</sup>''. Because ''S'' is a nontrivial ''p''-group, its center ''Z''(''S'') is nontrivial. Fix a nontrivial element <math>g\\in Z(S)</math>. The number of conjugates of ''g'' is equal to the index of its [[stabilizer subgroup]] ''G<sub>g</sub>'', which divides the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] ''q<sup>b</sup>'' of ''S'' (because ''S'' is a subgroup of ''G<sub>g</sub>''). Hence this number is of the form ''q<sup>d</sup>''. Moreover, the integer ''d'' is strictly positive, since ''g'' is nontrivial and therefore not central in ''G''.\n\n:* '''There exists a nontrivial [[irreducible representation]] ρ with [[Character theory|character]] χ, such that its dimension ''n'' is not divisible by ''q'' and the complex number χ(''g'') is not zero.'''\n\nLet (χ<sub>i</sub>)<sub>1≤''i≤h''</sub> be the family of irreducible characters of ''G'' over ℂ (here χ<sub>1</sub> denotes the trivial character). Because ''g'' is not in the same conjugacy class as 1, the [[Schur orthogonality relations|orthogonality relation]] for the columns of the group's [[character table]] gives:\n\n<center><math>0=\\sum_{i=1}^h \\chi_i(1)\\chi_i(g)= 1 + \\sum_{i=2}^h \\chi_i(1)\\chi_i(g).</math></center>\n\nNow the χ<sub>i</sub>(''g'') are [[algebraic integer]]s, because they are sums of [[Root of unity|roots of unity]]. If all the nontrivial irreducible characters which don't vanish at ''g'' take a value divisible by ''q'' at 1, we deduce that\n<center><math>-\\frac1q=\\sum_{i\\ge 2,~\\chi_i(g)\\ne 0}\\frac{\\chi_i(1)}q\\chi_i(g)</math></center>\nis an algebraic integer (since it is a sum of integer multiples of algebraic integers), which is absurd. This proves the statement.\n\n:* '''The complex number ''q<sup>d</sup>''χ(''g'')/n is an algebraic integer.'''\n\nThe set of integer-valued [[Class function (algebra)|class functions]] on ''G'', ''Z''(ℤ[''G'']), is a [[commutative ring]], [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]] over ℤ.

It is an algebraic integer, so its norm ''N''(ζ) (i.e. the product of its [[Conjugate element (field theory)|conjugates]], that is the roots of its [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] over ℚ) is a nonzero integer. Now ζ is the average of roots of unity (the eigenvalues of ρ(''g'')), hence so are its conjugates, so they all have an absolute value less than or equal to 1. Because the absolute value of their product ''N''(ζ) is greater than or equal to 1, their absolute value must all be 1, in particular ζ, which means that the eigenvalues of ρ(''g'') are all equal, so ρ(''g'') is a homothety.\n\n:* '''Conclusion'''\nLet ''N'' be the kernel of ρ. The homothety ρ(''g'') is central in Im(ρ) (which is canonically isomorphic to ''G/N''), whereas ''g'' is not central in ''G''.

      "text": "{{ For|other theorems attributed to [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]|Cauchy theorem (disambiguation)}}\n'''Cauchy's theorem''' is a theorem in the mathematics of [[group theory]], named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. It states that if ''G'' is a [[finite group]] and ''p'' is a [[prime number]] dividing the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' (the number of elements in ''G''), then ''G'' contains an element of order ''p''. That is, there is ''x'' in ''G'' so that ''p'' is the lowest non-zero number with ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = ''e'', where ''e'' is the [[identity element]].\n\nThe theorem is related to [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], which states that the order of any [[subgroup]] of a finite group ''G'' divides the order of ''G''. Cauchy's theorem implies that for any prime divisor ''p'' of the order of ''G'', there is a subgroup of ''G'' whose order is ''p''—the [[cyclic group]] generated by the element in Cauchy's theorem.\n\nCauchy's theorem is generalised by [[Sylow theorems|Sylow's first theorem]], which implies that if ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> is the maximal power of ''p'' dividing the order of ''G'', then ''G'' has a subgroup of order ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> (and using the fact that a ''p''-group is [[Solvable group|solvable]], one can show that ''G'' has subgroups of order ''p''<sup>''r''</sup> for any ''r'' less than or equal to ''n'').\n\n==Statement and proof==\nMany texts prove the theorem with the use of [[strong induction]] and the [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy class equation|class equation]], though considerably less machinery is required to prove the theorem in the [[abelian group|abelian]] case. One can also invoke [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]s for the proof.\n\n'''Theorem:''' Let ''G'' be a [[finite group]] and ''p'' be a [[prime number|prime]]. If ''p'' divides the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'', then ''G'' has an element of order ''p''.\n\n===Proof 1===\n\nWe first prove the special case that where ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]], and then the general case; both proofs are by induction on ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;|''G''|, and have as starting case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' which is trivial because any non-identity element now has order ''p''. Suppose first that ''G'' is abelian. Take any non-identity element ''a'', and let ''H'' be the [[cyclic group]] it generates. If ''p'' divides |''H''|, then ''a''<sup>|''H''|/''p''</sup> is an element of order ''p''. If ''p'' does not divide |''H''|, then it divides the order [''G'':''H''] of the [[quotient group]] ''G''/''H'', which therefore contains an element of order ''p'' by the inductive hypothesis. That element is a class ''xH'' for some ''x'' in ''G'', and if ''m'' is the order of ''x'' in ''G'', then ''x''<sup>''m''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''e'' in ''G'' gives (''xH'')<sup>''m''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''eH'' in ''G''/''H'', so ''p'' divides ''m''; as before ''x''<sup>''m''/''p''</sup> is now an element of order ''p'' in ''G'', completing the proof for the abelian case.\n\nIn the general case, let ''Z'' be the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G'', which is an abelian subgroup. If ''p'' divides |''Z''|, then ''Z'' contains an element of order ''p'' by the case of abelian groups, and this element works for ''G'' as well. So we may assume that ''p'' does not divide the order of ''Z''; since it does divide |''G''|, there is at least one conjugacy class of a non-central element ''a'' whose size is not divisible by ''p''. But the [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy class equation|class equation]] shows that size is [''G'' : ''C''<sub>''G''</sub>(''a'')], so ''p'' divides the order of the [[centralizer]] ''C''<sub>''G''</sub>(''a'') of ''a'' in ''G'', which is a proper subgroup because ''a'' is not central. This subgroup contains an element of order ''p'' by the inductive hypothesis, and we are done.\n\n===Proof 2===\n\nThis proof uses the fact that for any [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of a (cyclic) group of prime order ''p'', the only possible orbit sizes are 1 and ''p'', which is immediate from the [[orbit stabilizer theorem]].\n\nThe set that our cyclic group shall act on is the set <math> X = \\{\\,(x_1,\\ldots,x_p) \\in G^p : x_1x_2\\cdots x_p = e\\, \\} </math> of ''p''-tuples of elements of ''G'' whose product (in order) gives the identity. Such a ''p''-tuple is uniquely determined by all its components except the last one, as the last element must be the inverse of the product of those preceding elements. One also sees that those {{nobreak|''p'' − 1}} elements can be chosen freely, so ''X'' has |''G''|<sup>''p''−1</sup> elements, which is divisible by ''p''.\n\nNow from the fact that in a group if ''ab'' = ''e'' then also ''ba'' = ''e'', it follows that any cyclic permutation of the components of an element of ''X'' again gives an element of ''X''. Therefore one can define an action of the cyclic group ''C''<sub>''p'' </sub> of order ''p'' on ''X'' by cyclic permutations of components, in other words in which a chosen generator of ''C''<sub>''p''</sub> sends <math>(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_p)\\mapsto(x_2,\\ldots,x_p,x_1)</math>.\n\nAs remarked, orbits in ''X'' under this action either have size 1 or size ''p''. The former happens precisely for those tuples (''x'',''x'',...,''x'') for which ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = ''e''. Counting the elements of ''X'' by orbits, and reducing modulo ''p'', one sees that the number of elements satisfying ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = ''e'' is divisible by ''p''. But ''x'' = ''e'' is one such element, so there must be at least {{nobreak|''p'' − 1}} other solutions for ''x'', and these solutions are elements of order ''p''. This completes the proof.\n\n==Uses==\nA practically immediate consequence of Cauchy's Theorem is a useful characterization of finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]], where ''p'' is a prime. In particular, a finite group ''G'' is a ''p''-group (i.e. all of its elements have order ''p''<sup>''k''</sup> for some [[natural number]] ''k'') if and only if ''G'' has order ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> for some natural number ''n''.  One may use the abelian case of Cauchy's Theorem in an inductive proof<ref>N. Jacobson, Basic Algebra I, p.80</ref> of the first of Sylow's Theorems, similar to the first proof above, although there also exist proofs that avoid doing this special case separately.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* James McKay.

By the existence of inverses, this function has a two-sided inverse, <math>f_{g^{-1}}</math>. So multiplication by ''g'' acts as a [[bijective]] function. Thus, ''f''<sub>''g''</sub> is a permutation of ''G'', and so is a member of Sym(''G'').\n\nThe set {{nowrap|1=''K'' = {''f''<sub>''g''</sub> : ''g'' ∈ ''G''} }} is a subgroup of Sym(''G'') that is isomorphic to ''G''. The fastest way to establish this is to consider the function {{nowrap|''T'' : ''G'' → Sym(''G'')}} with {{nowrap|1=''T''(''g'') = ''f''<sub>''g''</sub>}} for every ''g'' in ''G''. ''T'' is a [[group homomorphism]] because (using · to denote composition in Sym(''G'')):\n\n:<math> (f_g \\cdot f_h)(x) = f_g(f_h(x)) = f_g(h*x) = g*(h*x) = (g*h)*x = f_{g*h}(x) ,</math>\nfor all ''x'' in ''G'', and hence:\n:<math> T(g) \\cdot T(h) = f_g \\cdot f_h = f_{g*h} = T(g*h) .</math>\nThe homomorphism ''T'' is [[injective]] since {{nowrap|1=''T''(''g'') = id<sub>''G''</sub>}} (the identity element of Sym(''G'')) implies that {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∗ ''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''G'', and taking ''x'' to be the identity element ''e'' of ''G'' yields {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''g'' ∗ ''e'' = ''e''}}, i.e. the kernel is trivial. Alternatively, ''T'' is also [[injective]] since {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∗ ''x'' = ''g''′ ∗ ''x''}} implies that {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''g''′}} (because every group is [[cancellative]]).\n\nThus ''G'' is isomorphic to the image of ''T'', which is the subgroup ''K''.\n\n''T'' is sometimes called the ''regular representation of'' ''G''.\n\n=== Alternative setting of proof ===\nAn alternative setting uses the language of [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]s. We consider the group <math>G</math> as a G-set, which can be shown to have permutation representation, say <math>\\phi</math>.\n\nFirstly, suppose <math>G=G/H</math> with <math>H=\\{e\\}</math>. Then the group action is <math>g.e</math> by [[Group action (mathematics)|classification of G-orbits]] (also known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem).\n\nNow, the representation is faithful if <math>\\phi</math> is injective, that is, if the kernel of <math>\\phi</math> is trivial. Suppose <math>g\\in\\ker\\phi</math> Then, <math>g=g.e=\\phi(g).e</math> by the equivalence of the permutation representation and the group action. But since <math>g \\in \\ker\\phi</math>, <math>\\phi(g)=e</math> and thus <math>\\ker\\phi</math> is trivial. Then <math>\\mathrm{Im} \\phi < G</math> and thus the result follows by use of the [[first isomorphism theorem]].\n\n==Remarks on the regular group representation==\nThe identity group element corresponds to the identity permutation. All other group elements correspond to [[derangements]]: permutations that do not leave any element unchanged. Since this also applies for powers of a group element, lower than the order of that element, each element corresponds to a permutation that consists of cycles all of the same length: this length is the order of that element. The elements in each cycle form a right [[coset]] of the subgroup generated by the element.\n\n==Examples of the regular group representation==\nZ<sub>2</sub> = {0,1} with addition modulo 2; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (12). E.g. 0 +1 = 1 and 1+1 = 0, so 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1, as they would under a permutation.\n\nZ<sub>3</sub> = {0,1,2} with addition modulo 3; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (123), and group element 2 to permutation (132). E.g. 1 + 1 = 2 corresponds to (123)(123)=(132).\n\nZ<sub>4</sub> = {0,1,2,3} with addition modulo 4; the elements correspond to e, (1234), (13)(24), (1432).\n\nThe elements of [[Klein four-group]] {e, a, b, c} correspond to e, (12)(34), (13)(24), and (14)(23).\n\nS<sub>3</sub> ([[dihedral group of order 6]]) is the group of all permutations of 3 objects, but also a permutation group of the 6 group elements, and the latter is how it is realized by its regular representation.\n\n<!-- Looks ugly if it's left-aligned/non-square cells, so a bit of customization is good here -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"width: 1.5em; height: 1.5em;\" | *\n! style=\"width: 1.5em;\" | ''e''\n! style=\"width: 1.5em;\" | ''a''\n! style=\"width: 1.5em;\" | ''b''\n! style=\"width: 1.5em;\" | ''c''\n! style=\"width: 1.5em;\" | ''d''\n! style=\"width: 1.5em;\" | ''f''\n! permutation\n|-\n! style=\"height: 1.5em;\" | ''e''\n| ''e'' || ''a'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || ''d'' || ''f'' || ''e''\n|-\n! style=\"height: 1.5em;\" | ''a''\n| ''a'' || ''e'' || ''d'' || ''f'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || (12)(35)(46)\n|-\n! style=\"height: 1.5em;\" | ''b''\n| ''b'' || ''f'' || ''e'' || ''d'' || ''c'' || ''a'' || (13)(26)(45)\n|-\n! style=\"height: 1.5em;\" | ''c''\n| ''c'' || ''d'' || ''f'' || ''e'' || ''a'' || ''b'' || (14)(25)(36)\n|-\n! style=\"height: 1.5em;\" | ''d''\n| ''d'' || ''c'' || ''a'' || ''b'' || ''f'' || ''e'' || (156)(243)\n|-\n! style=\"height: 1.5em;\" | ''f''\n| ''f'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || ''a'' || ''e'' || ''d'' || (165)(234)\n|}\n\n== More general statement of the theorem==\n\nA more general statement of Cayley's theorem consist of considering the [[Core (group)|core]] of an arbitrary group <math>G</math>.

A group of odd order has no involutions, so to carry out Brauer's program it is first necessary to show that non-cyclic finite simple groups never have odd order. This is equivalent to showing that odd order groups are [[solvable group|solvable]], which is what Feit and Thompson proved.\n\nThe attack on Burnside's conjecture was started by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Michio|last=Suzuki|authorlink=Michio Suzuki|year=1957}}, who studied [[CA group|'''CA''' groups]]; these are groups such that the [[centralizer|'''C'''entralizer]] of every non-trivial element is [[abelian group|'''A'''belian]].  In a pioneering paper he showed that all CA groups of odd order are solvable. (He later classified all the simple CA groups, and more generally all simple groups such that the centralizer of any involution has a normal 2-Sylow subgroup, finding an overlooked family of simple [[groups of Lie type]] in the process, that are now called [[Suzuki groups]].)\n\n{{harvs|txt=yes|last1=Feit|last2= Hall|first2=Marshall|authorlink2=Marshall Hall (mathematician)|last3= Thompson |year=1960}} extended Suzuki's work to the family of [[CN group|'''CN''' groups]]; these are groups such that the '''C'''entralizer of every non-trivial element is [[nilpotent group|'''N'''ilpotent]].  They showed that every CN group of odd order is solvable.  Their proof is similar to Suzuki's proof. It was about 17 pages long, which at the time was thought to be very long for a proof in group theory.\n\nThe Feit–Thompson theorem can be thought of as the next step in this process: they show that there is no non-cyclic simple group of odd order such that every proper subgroup is [[solvable group|solvable]]. This proves that every finite group of odd order is solvable, as a [[minimal counterexample]] must be a simple group such that every proper subgroup is solvable.  Although the proof follows the same general outline as the CA theorem and the CN theorem, the details are vastly more complicated. The final paper is 255 pages long.\n\n== Significance of the proof ==\nThe Feit–Thompson theorem showed that the classification of finite simple groups using centralizers of involutions might be possible, as every nonabelian simple group has an involution. Many of the techniques they introduced in their proof, especially the idea of [[local analysis]], were developed further into tools used in the classification. Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the proof was its length: before the Feit–Thompson paper, few arguments in group theory were more than a few pages long and most could be read in a day. Once group theorists realized that such long arguments could work, a series of papers that were several hundred pages long started to appear. Some of these dwarfed even the Feit–Thompson paper; the paper by [[Michael Aschbacher]] and Stephen D. Smith on [[quasithin group]]s was 1,221 pages long.\n\n== Revision of the proof ==\nMany mathematicians have simplified parts of the original Feit–Thompson proof. However all of these improvements are in some sense local; the global structure of the argument is still the same, but some of the details of the arguments have been simplified.\n\nThe simplified proof has been published in two books: {{harv|Bender|Glauberman|1995}}, which covers everything except the character theory, and {{harv|Peterfalvi|2000|loc=part I}} which covers the character theory. This revised proof is still very hard, and is longer than the original proof, but is written in a more leisurely style.\n\nA fully formal proof, checked with the [[Coq]] [[proof assistant]], was announced in September 2012 by [[Georges Gonthier]] and fellow researchers at [[Microsoft Research]] and [[INRIA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msr-inria.fr/news/feit-thomson-proved-in-coq/ |title=Feit–Thompson theorem has been totally checked in Coq |publisher=Msr-inria.inria.fr |date=2012-09-20 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119094854/http://www.msr-inria.fr/news/feit-thomson-proved-in-coq/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== An outline of the proof ==\nInstead of describing the Feit–Thompson theorem directly, it is easier to describe Suzuki's CA theorem and then comment on some of the extensions needed for the CN-theorem and the odd order theorem. The proof can be broken up into three steps. We let ''G'' be a non-abelian (minimal) simple group of odd order satisfying the CA condition. For a more detailed exposition of the odd order paper see {{harvtxt|Thompson|1963}} or {{harv|Gorenstein|1980}} or {{harvtxt|Glauberman|1999}}.\n\n===Step 1. Local analysis of the structure of the group ''G''===\nThis is easy in the CA case because the relation \"''a'' commutes with ''b''\" is an equivalence relation on the non-identity elements. So the elements break up into equivalence classes, such that each equivalence class is the set of non-identity elements of a maximal abelian subgroup. The normalizers of these maximal abelian subgroups turn out to be exactly the maximal proper subgroups of ''G''. These normalizers are [[Frobenius groups]] whose character theory is reasonably transparent, and well-suited to manipulations involving [[Character theory|character induction]]. Also, the set of prime divisors of |''G''| is partitioned according to the primes which divide the orders of the distinct conjugacy classes of maximal abelian subgroups of |''G''|. This pattern of partitioning the prime divisors of |''G''| according to conjugacy classes of certain [[Hall subgroup]]s (a Hall subgroup is one whose order and [[Index of a subgroup|index]] are relatively prime) which correspond to the maximal subgroups of ''G'' (up to conjugacy) is repeated in both the proof of the Feit–Hall–Thompson CN-theorem and in the proof of the Feit–Thompson odd-order theorem. Each maximal subgroup ''M'' has a certain nilpotent Hall subgroup ''M''<sub>σ</sub> with normalizer contained in ''M'', whose order is divisible by certain primes forming a set σ(''M''). Two maximal subgroups are conjugate if and only if the sets σ(''M'') are the same, and if they are not conjugate then the sets σ(''M'') are disjoint. Every prime dividing the order of ''G'' occurs in some set σ(''M''). So the primes dividing the order of ''G'' are partitioned into equivalence classes corresponding to the conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups. The proof of the CN-case is already considerably more difficult than the CA-case: the main extra problem is to prove that two different Sylow subgroups intersect in the identity. This part of the proof of the odd-order theorem takes over 100 journal pages. A key step is the proof of the [[Thompson uniqueness theorem]], stating that abelian subgroups of normal rank at least 3 are contained in a unique maximal subgroup, which means that the primes ''p'' for which the Sylow ''p''-subgroups have normal rank at most 2 need to be considered separately. Bender later simplified the proof of the uniqueness theorem using [[Bender's method]]. Whereas in the CN-case, the resulting maximal subgroups ''M'' are still Frobenius groups, the maximal subgroups that occur in the proof of the odd-order theorem need no longer have this structure, and the analysis of their structure and interplay produces 5 possible types of maximal subgroups, called types I, II, III, IV, V. Type I subgroups are of \"Frobenius type\", a slight generalization of Frobenius group, and in fact later on in the proof are shown to be Frobenius groups. They have the structure ''M''<sub>''F''</sub>⋊''U'' where ''M''<sub>''F''</sub> is the largest normal nilpotent Hall subgroup, and ''U'' has a subgroup ''U''<sub>0</sub> with the same exponent such that ''M''<sub>''F''</sub>⋊''U''<sub>0</sub> is a Frobenius group with kernel ''M''<sub>''F''</sub>. Types II, III, IV, V are all [[3-step group]] with structure ''M''<sub>''F''</sub>⋊''U''⋊''W''<sub>1</sub>, where   ''M''<sub>''F''</sub>⋊''U'' is the derived subgroup of ''M''. The subdivision into types II, III, IV and V depends on the structure and embedding of the subgroup ''U'' as follows:\n*Type II: ''U'' is nontrivial abelian and its normalizer is not contained in ''M''.\n*Type III: ''U'' is nontrivial abelian and its normalizer is contained in ''M''.\n*Type IV: ''U'' is nonabelian.\n*Type V: ''U'' is trivial.\n\nAll but two classes of maximal subgroups are of type I, but there may also be two extra classes of maximal subgroups, one of type II, and one of type II, III, IV, or V.\n\n===Step 2. Character theory of ''G''===\nIf X is an irreducible character of the normalizer ''H'' of the maximal abelian subgroup ''A'' of the CA group ''G'', not containing ''A'' in its kernel, we can induce X to a character Y of ''G'', which is not necessarily irreducible. Because of the known structure of ''G'', it is easy to find the character values of Y on all but the identity element of ''G''. This implies that if X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> are two such irreducible characters of ''H'' and Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> are the corresponding induced characters, then Y<sub>1</sub> − Y<sub>2</sub> is completely determined, and calculating its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] shows that it is the difference of two '''irreducible''' characters of ''G'' (these are sometimes known as [[exceptional character]]s of ''G'' with respect to ''H''). A counting argument shows that each non-trivial irreducible character of ''G'' arises exactly once as an exceptional character associated to the normalizer of some maximal abelian subgroup of ''G''.  A similar argument (but replacing abelian Hall subgroups by nilpotent Hall subgroups) works in the proof of the CN-theorem. However, in the proof of the odd-order theorem, the arguments for constructing characters of ''G'' from characters of subgroups are far more delicate, and use the [[Dade isometry]] between character rings rather than character induction, since the maximal subgroups have a more complicated structure and are embedded in a less transparent way. The theory of exceptional characters is replaced by the theory of a [[coherent set of characters]] to extend the Dade isometry. Roughly speaking, this theory says that the Dade isometry can be extended unless the groups involved have a certain precise structure.  {{harvtxt|Peterfalvi|2000}} described a simplified version the character theory due to Dade, Sibley, and Peterfalvi.\n\n===Step 3. The final contradiction===\nBy step 2, we have a complete and precise description of the [[character theory#Character tables|character table]] of the CA group ''G''. From this, and using the fact that ''G'' has odd order, sufficient information is available to obtain estimates for |''G''| and arrive at a contradiction to the assumption that ''G'' is simple. This part of the argument works similarly in the CN-group case.\n\nIn the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem, however, this step is (as usual) vastly more complicated. The character theory only eliminates some of the possible  configurations left after step 1. First they show that the maximal subgroups of type I are all Frobenius groups. If all maximal subgroups are type I then an argument similar to the CN case shows that the group ''G'' cannot be an odd-order minimal simple group, so there are exactly two classes of maximal subgroups of types II, III, IV or V. Most of the rest of the proof now focuses on these two types of maximal subgroup ''S'' and ''T'' and the relation between them. More character-theoretic arguments show that they cannot be of types IV or V. The two subgroups have a precise structure: the subgroup ''S'' is of order ''p''<sup>''q''</sup>×''q''×(''p''<sup>''q''</sup>–1)/(''p''–1) and consists of all automorphisms of the underlying set of the finite field of order ''p''<sup>''q''</sup> of the form ''x''→''ax''<sup>''σ''</sup>+''b'' where ''a'' has norm 1 and ''σ'' is an automorphism of the finite field, where ''p'' and ''q'' are distinct primes. The maximal subgroup ''T'' has a similar structure with ''p'' and ''q'' reversed.The subgroups ''S'' and ''T'' are closely linked. Taking ''p''>''q'', one can show that the cyclic subgroup of ''S'' of order (''p''<sup>''q''</sup>–1)/(''p''–1) is conjugate to a subgroup of the cyclic subgroup of ''T'' of order (''q''<sup>''p''</sup>–1)/(''q''–1). (In particular, the first number divides the second, so if the [[Feit–Thompson conjecture]] is true, it would assert that this cannot happen, and this could be used to finish the proof at this point. The conjecture is still unproven, however.)\n\nThe conclusion from applying character theory to the group ''G'' is that ''G'' has the following structure: there are primes ''p''>''q'' such that (''p''<sup>''q''</sup>–1)/(''p''–1) is coprime to ''p''–1 and ''G'' has a subgroup given by the semidirect product ''PU'' where ''P'' is the additive group of a finite field of order ''p''<sup>''q''</sup> and ''U'' its elements of norm 1. Moreover ''G'' has an abelian subgroup ''Q'' of order prime to ''p'' containing an element ''y'' such that ''P''<sub>0</sub> normalizes ''Q'' and (''P''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''y''</sup> normalizes ''U'', where ''P''<sub>0</sub> is the additive group of the finite field of order ''p''. (For ''p''=2 a similar configuration occurs in the group SL<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>''q''</sup>), with ''PU'' a Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices and ''Q'' the subgroup of order 3 generated by <math>\\scriptstyle y=\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)</math>.) To eliminate this final case, Thompson used some fearsomely complicated manipulations with [[Presentation of a group|generators and relations]], which were later simplified by {{harvtxt|Peterfalvi|1984}}, whose argument is reproduced in {{harv|Bender|Glauberman|1994}}. The proof examines the set of elements ''a'' in the finite field of order ''p''<sup>''q''</sup> such that ''a'' and 2–a both have norm 1. One first checks that this set has at least one element other than 1. Then a rather difficult argument using generators and relations in the group ''G'' shows that the set is closed under taking inverses. If ''a'' is in the set and not equal to 1 then the polynomial N((1–''a'')''x''+1)–1 has degree ''q'' and has at least ''p'' distinct roots given by the elements ''x'' in '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>, using the fact that ''x''→1/(2–''x'') maps the set to itself, so ''p''≤''q'', contradicting the assumption ''p''>''q''.\n\n==Use of oddness==\nThe fact that the order of the group ''G'' is odd is used in several places in the proof, as follows {{harv|Thompson|1963}}.\n\n*The [[Hall–Higman theorem]] is sharper for groups of odd order.\n*For groups of odd order, all non-principal characters occur in complex conjugate pairs. \n*Several results about ''p''-groups only hold for odd primes ''p''.\n*If a group of odd order has no elementary abelian subgroups of rank 3, then its derived group is nilpotent. (This fails for the symmetric group ''S''<sub>4</sub> of even order.)\n*Several arguments involving character theory fail for small primes, especially for the prime 2.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Bender | first1=Helmut | last2=Glauberman | first2=George | author2-link=George Glauberman | title=Local analysis for the odd order theorem | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | isbn=978-0-521-45716-3 | mr=1311244  | year=1994 | volume=188}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Brauer | first1=R. | author1-link=Richard Brauer | title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Amsterdam, 1954, Vol. 1 | publisher=Erven P.

Formally, they are kernels of the reflection onto the [[reflective subcategory]] of ''p''-groups (respectively, elementary abelian ''p''-groups, abelian ''p''-groups).\n* '''E'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is the intersection of all index ''p'' normal subgroups; ''G''/'''E'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is an elementary abelian group, and is the largest elementary abelian ''p''-group onto which ''G'' surjects.\n* '''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') (notation from {{harv|Isaacs|2008|loc=5D, p. 164}}) is the intersection of all normal subgroups ''K'' such that ''G''/''K'' is an abelian ''p''-group (i.e., ''K'' is an index <math>p^k</math> normal subgroup that contains the derived group <math>[G,G]</math>): ''G''/'''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is the largest abelian ''p''-group (not necessarily elementary) onto which ''G'' surjects.\n* '''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is the intersection of all normal subgroups ''K'' of ''G'' such that ''G''/''K'' is a (possibly non-abelian) ''p''-group (i.e., ''K'' is an index <math>p^k</math> normal subgroup): ''G''/'''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is the largest ''p''-group (not necessarily abelian) onto which ''G'' surjects. '''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is also known as the {{anchor|p-residual subgroup}}'''''p''-residual subgroup'''.\nFirstly, as these are weaker conditions on the groups ''K,'' one obtains the containments <math>\\mathbf{E}^p(G) \\supseteq \\mathbf{A}^p(G) \\supseteq \\mathbf{O}^p(G).</math> These are further related as:\n:'''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') = '''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'')[''G'',''G''].\n'''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') has the following alternative characterization as the subgroup generated by all Sylow ''q''-subgroups of ''G'' as ''q''≠''p'' ranges over the prime divisors of the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' distinct from ''p''.\n\n'''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is used to define the '''lower ''p''-series'''{{anchor|lower p-series}} of ''G'', similarly to the [[upper p-series|upper ''p''-series]] described in [[p-core]].\n\n=== Transfer homomorphism ===\n{{main|Transfer (group theory)}}\nThe '''transfer homomorphism''' is a homomorphism that can be defined from any group  ''G'' to the abelian group ''H''/[''H'',''H''] defined by a subgroup ''H'' ≤ ''G'' of [[finite index]], that is [''G'':''H''] &lt; ∞.  The transfer map from a finite group ''G'' into its Sylow ''p''-subgroup has a [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] that is easy to describe:\n:The kernel of the transfer homomorphism from a finite group ''G'' into its Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' has '''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') as its kernel, {{harv|Isaacs|2008|loc=Theorem 5.20, p. 165}}.\nIn other words, the \"obvious\" homomorphism onto an abelian ''p''-group is in fact the most general such homomorphism.\n\n=== Fusion ===\nThe '''fusion''' pattern of a subgroup ''H'' in ''G'' is the equivalence relation on the elements of ''H'' where two elements ''h'', ''k'' of ''H'' are '''fused''' if they are ''G''-conjugate, that is, if there is some ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''h'' = ''k''<sup>''g''</sup>.  The normal structure of ''G'' has an effect on the fusion pattern of its Sylow ''p''-subgroups, and conversely the fusion pattern of its Sylow ''p''-subgroups has an effect on the normal structure of ''G'', {{harv|Gorenstein|Lyons|Solomon|1996|p=89}}.\n\n=== Focal subgroup ===\n\nOne can define, as in {{harv|Isaacs|2008|p=165}} the '''focal subgroup''' of ''H'' with respect to ''G'' as:\n:Foc<sub>''G''</sub>(''H'') = ⟨ ''x''<sup>−1</sup> ''y'' {{!}} ''x'',''y'' in ''H'' and ''x'' is ''G''-conjugate to ''y'' ⟩.\nThis focal subgroup measures the extent to which elements of ''H'' fuse in ''G'', while the previous definition measured certain abelian ''p''-group homomorphic images of the group ''G''.  The content of the focal subgroup theorem is that these two definitions of focal subgroup are compatible.\n\n{{harv|Gorenstein|1980|p=246}} shows that the '''focal subgroup''' of ''P'' in ''G'' is the intersection ''P''∩[''G'',''G''] of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' of the finite group ''G'' with the [[derived subgroup]] [''G'',''G''] of ''G''. The focal subgroup is important as it is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of the derived subgroup.  One also gets the following result:\n:There exists a normal subgroup ''K'' of ''G'' with ''G''/''K'' an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[p-group|''p''-group]] isomorphic to ''P''/''P''∩[''G'',''G''] (here ''K'' denotes '''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'')), and\n:if ''K'' is a normal subgroup of ''G'' with ''G''/''K'' an abelian p-group, then ''P''∩[''G'',''G''] ≤ ''K'', and ''G''/''K'' is a homomorphic image of ''P''/''P''∩[''G'',''G''], {{harv|Gorenstein|1980|loc=Theorem 7.3.1, p. 90}}.\n\n== Statement of the theorem ==\n\nThe focal subgroup of a finite group ''G'' with Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' is given by:\n:''P''∩[''G'',''G''] = ''P''∩'''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') = ''P''∩ker(''v'') = Foc<sub>''G''</sub>(''P'') = ⟨ ''x''<sup>−1</sup> ''y'' {{!}} ''x'',''y'' in ''P'' and ''x'' is ''G''-conjugate to ''y'' ⟩\nwhere ''v'' is the transfer homomorphism from ''G'' to ''P''/[''P'',''P''], {{harv |Isaacs|2008|loc=Theorem 5.21, p. 165}}.\n\n== History and generalizations ==\nThis connection between transfer and fusion is credited to {{harv|Higman|1958}},<ref>The focal subgroup theorem and/or the focal subgroup is due to {{harv|Higman|1958}} according to {{harv|Gorenstein|Lyons|Solomon|1996|p=90}}, {{harv|Rose|1978|p=255}}, {{harv|Suzuki|1986|p=141}}; however, the focal subgroup theorem as stated there and here is quite a bit older and already appears in textbook form in {{harv|Hall|1959|p=215}}.  There and in {{harv|Puig|2000}} the ideas are credited to {{harv|Grün|1935}}; compare to {{harv|Grün|1935|loc=Satz 5}} in the special case of ''p''-normal groups, and the general result in Satz 9 which is in some sense a refinement of the focal subgroup theorem.</ref> where, in different language, the focal subgroup theorem was proved along with various generalizations.  The requirement that ''G''/''K'' be abelian was dropped, so that Higman also studied '''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') and the [[nilpotent residual]] γ<sub>∞</sub>(''G''), as so called '''hyperfocal subgroups'''.  Higman also did not restrict to a single prime ''p'', but rather allowed ''π''-groups for sets of primes ''π'' and used [[Philip Hall]]'s theorem of [[Hall subgroup]]s in order to prove similar results about the transfer into Hall ''π''-subgroups; taking ''π'' = {''p''} a Hall ''π''-subgroup is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup, and the results of Higman are as presented above.\n\nInterest in the hyperfocal subgroups was renewed by work of {{harv|Puig|2000}} in understanding the [[modular representation theory]] of certain well behaved blocks.  The hyperfocal subgroup of ''P'' in ''G'' can defined as ''P''∩γ<sub>∞</sub>(''G'') that is, as a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of the nilpotent residual of ''G''.  If ''P'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of the finite group ''G'', then one gets the standard focal subgroup theorem:\n:''P''∩γ<sub>∞</sub>(''G'') = ''P''∩'''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') = ⟨ ''x''<sup>−1</sup> ''y'' : ''x'',''y'' in ''P'' and ''y'' = ''x''<sup>''g''</sup> for some ''g'' in ''G'' of order coprime to ''p'' ⟩\nand the local characterization:\n:''P''∩'''O'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') = ⟨ ''x''<sup>−1</sup> ''y'' : ''x'',''y'' in ''Q'' ≤ ''P'' and ''y'' = ''x''<sup>''g''</sup> for some ''g'' in N<sub>''G''(''Q'')</sub> of order coprime to ''p'' ⟩.\nThis compares to the local characterization of the focal subgroup as:\n:''P''∩'''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') = ⟨ ''x''<sup>−1</sup> ''y'' : ''x'',''y'' in ''Q'' ≤ ''P'' and ''y'' = ''x''<sup>''g''</sup> for some ''g'' in N<sub>''G''</sub>(''Q'') ⟩.\n\nPuig is interested in the generalization of this situation to '''fusion systems''', a [[category theory|categorical]] model of the fusion pattern of a Sylow ''p''-subgroup with respect to a finite group that also models the fusion pattern of a defect group of a ''p''-block in modular representation theory.  In fact fusion systems have found a number of surprising applications and inspirations in the area of [[algebraic topology]] known as [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[homotopy theory]].  Some of the major algebraic theorems in this area only have topological proofs at the moment.\n\n== Other characterizations ==\n\nVarious mathematicians have presented methods to calculate the focal subgroup from smaller groups.  For instance, the influential work {{harv|Alperin|1967}} develops the idea of a local control of fusion, and as an example application shows that:\n:''P''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;'''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is generated by the commutator subgroups [''Q'', N<sub>''G''</sub>(''Q'')] where ''Q'' varies over a family ''C'' of subgroups of&nbsp;''P''\nThe choice of the family ''C'' can be made in many ways (''C'' is what is called a \"weak conjugation family\" in {{harv|Alperin|1967}}), and several examples are given: one can take ''C'' to be all non-identity subgroups of ''P'', or the smaller choice of just the intersections ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''P''<sup>''g''</sup> for ''g'' in ''G'' in which N<sub>''P''</sub>(''Q'') and N<sub>''P''<sup>''g''</sup></sub>(''Q'') are both Sylow ''p''-subgroups of N<sub>''G''</sub>(''Q'').  The latter choice is made in {{harv|Gorenstein|1980|loc=Theorem 7.4.1, p. 251}}.  The work of {{harv|Grün|1935}} studied aspects of the transfer and fusion as well, resulting in '''Grün's first theorem''':\n:''P''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;'''A'''<sup>''p''</sup>(''G'') is generated by ''P''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;[''N'',&nbsp;''N''] and ''P''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;[''Q'',&nbsp;''Q''] where ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;N<sub>''G''</sub>(''P'') and ''Q'' ranges over the set of Sylow ''p''-subgroups ''Q'' = ''P''<sup>''g''</sup> of ''G'' {{harv|Gorenstein|1980|loc=Theorem 7.4.2, p. 252}}.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n{{Expand section|date=January 2010|suggestion=Control of transfer leads to various p-nilpotence results; include Tate and Thompsons hyperfocal O^p and \"hypo\" focal E^p results; include the character theoretic transfer and the work of Yoshida; contrast to control of fusion of elements and to control of strong fusion}}\n\nThe textbook presentations in {{harv|Rose|1978|pp=254–264}}, {{harv|Isaacs|2008|loc=Chapter 5}}, {{harv|Hall|1959|loc=Chapter 14}}, {{harv|Suzuki|1986|loc=&sect;5.2, pp. 138–165}}, all contain various applications of the focal subgroup theorem relating fusion, transfer, and a certain kind of [[split exact sequence|splitting]] called [[p-nilpotent group|''p''-nilpotence]].\n\nDuring the course of the [[Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem]] classifying finite [[simple group]]s with [[quasi-dihedral group|quasi-dihedral]] Sylow 2-subgroups, it becomes necessary to distinguish four types of groups with quasi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroups: the 2-nilpotent groups, the ''Q''-type groups whose focal subgroup is a [[generalized quaternion group]] of index 2, the ''D''-type groups whose focal subgroup a [[dihedral group]] of index 2, and the ''QD''-type groups whose focal subgroup is the entire quasi-dihedral group.  In terms of fusion, the 2-nilpotent groups have 2 classes of involutions, and 2 classes of cyclic subgroups of order 4; the ''Q''-type have 2 classes of involutions and one class of cyclic subgroup of order 4; the ''QD''-type have one class each of involutions and cyclic subgroups of order 4.  In other words, finite groups with quasi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroups can be classified according to their focal subgroup, or equivalently, according to their fusion patterns.  The explicit lists of groups with each fusion pattern are contained in {{harv|Alperin|Brauer|Gorenstein|1970}}.\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Alperin | first1=J.

The class field tower problem asks whether this tower is always finite; {{harvtxt|Hasse|1926}} attributed this question to Furtwangler, though Furtwangler said he had heard it from Schreier. Another consequence of the Golod–Shafarevich theorem is that such [[tower of fields|towers]] may be [[infinite tower of fields|infinite]] (in other words, do not always terminate in a field equal to its [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] class field).

To say that a finitely generated group has '''polynomial growth''' means the number of elements of [[length]] (relative to a symmetric generating set) at most ''n'' is bounded above by a [[polynomial]] function ''p''(''n''). The ''order of growth'' is then the least degree of any such polynomial function ''p''.\n\nA [[nilpotent group]] ''G'' is a group with a [[lower central series]] terminating in the identity subgroup.\n\nGromov's theorem states that a finitely generated group has polynomial growth if and only if it has a nilpotent subgroup that is of finite index.\n\n==Growth rates of nilpotent groups==\n\nThere is a vast literature on growth rates, leading up to Gromov's theorem.

      "title": "Grushko theorem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grushko_theorem",
      "text": "In the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[group theory]], the '''Grushko theorem''' or the '''Grushko-Neumann theorem''' is a theorem stating that the [[rank of a group|rank]] (that is, the smallest [[cardinality]] of a [[Generating set of a group|generating set]]) of a [[free product]] of two groups is equal to the sum of the ranks of the two free factors. The theorem was first obtained in a 1940 article of Grushko<ref>I. A. Grushko, ''On the bases of a free product of groups'', Matematicheskii Sbornik, vol 8 (1940), pp. 169&ndash;182.</ref> and then, independently, in a 1943 article of [[Bernhard Neumann|Neumann]].<ref>B. H. Neumann. ''On the number of generators of a free product.''  Journal of the London Mathematical Society, vol 18, (1943), pp. 12&ndash;20.</ref>\n\n==Statement of the theorem==\n\nLet ''A'' and ''B'' be [[finitely generated group]]s and let ''A''∗''B'' be the [[free product]] of ''A'' and ''B''.  Then\n\n:rank(''A''∗''B'') = rank(''A'') + rank(''B'').\n\nIt is obvious that rank(''A''∗''B'') ≤ rank(''A'') + rank(''B'') since if X is a finite [[Generating set of a group|generating set]] of ''A'' and ''Y'' is a finite generating set of ''B'' then ''X''∪''Y'' is a generating set for ''A''∗''B'' and that |''X''∪''Y''|≤|''X''| + |''Y''|. The opposite inequality, rank(''A''∗''B'') ≥ rank(''A'') + rank(''B''), requires proof.\n\nGrushko, but not Neumann, proved a more precise version of Grushko's theorem in terms of [[Nielsen equivalence]]. It states that if ''M'' = (''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>) is an ''n''-tuple of elements of ''G'' = ''A''∗''B''  such that ''M'' generates ''G'', <''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>> = ''G'', then ''M'' is [[Nielsen equivalent]] in ''G'' to an ''n''-tuple of the form  \n:''M''' = (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''n''&minus;''k''</sub>) where {''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}⊆''A'' is a generating set for ''A'' and where {''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''n''&minus;''k''</sub>}⊆''B'' is a generating set for ''B''. In particular, rank(''A'') ≤ ''k'', rank(''B'') ≤ ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' and rank(''A'') + rank(''B'') ≤ ''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'') = ''n''. If one takes ''M'' to be the minimal generating tuple for ''G'', that is, with ''n'' = rank(''G''), this implies that rank(''A'') + rank(''B'') ≤ rank(''G''). Since the opposite inequality, rank(''G'') ≤ rank(''A'') + rank(''B''), is obvious, it follows that rank(''G'')=rank(''A'') + rank(''B''), as required.\n\n==History and generalizations==\nAfter the original proofs of Grushko (1940) and [[Bernhard Neumann|Neumann]](1943), there were many subsequent alternative proofs, simplifications and generalizations of Grushko's theorem. A close version of Grushko's original proof is given in the 1955 book of [[Aleksandr Gennadievich Kurosh|Kurosh]].<ref>A. G. Kurosh, ''The theory of groups. Vol. I.'' Translated and edited by K. A. Hirsch. Chelsea Publishing Co., New York, N.Y., 1955</ref>\n\nLike the original proofs, Lyndon's proof (1965)<ref>[[Roger Lyndon|Roger C. Lyndon]],  ''Grushko's theorem.'' [[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 16 (1965), pp. 822&ndash;826.</ref> relied on length-functions considerations but with substantial simplifications.  A 1965 paper of [[John Stallings|Stallings]]\n<ref>John R. Stallings. ''A topological proof of Grushko's theorem on free products.'' [[Mathematische Zeitschrift]], vol. 90 (1965), pp. 1&ndash;8.</ref> gave a greatly simplified topological proof of Grushko's theorem.\n\nA 1970 paper of Zieschang<ref>Heiner Zieschang. ''Über die Nielsensche Kürzungsmethode in freien Produkten mit Amalgam.'' [[Inventiones Mathematicae]], vol. 10 (1970), pp. 4&ndash;37</ref> gave a [[Nielsen equivalence]] version of Grushko's theorem (stated above) and provided some generalizations of Grushko's theorem for [[free product with amalgamation|amalgamated free products]]. Scott (1974) gave another topological proof of Grushko's theorem, inspired by the methods of [[3-manifold]] topology<ref>[[G. Peter Scott|Scott, Peter]]. ''An introduction to 3-manifolds.'' Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, Lecture Note, No. 11.

M. Chiswell,  The Grushko-Neumann theorem. Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 33 (1976), no. 3, 385–400.</ref>  gave a relatively straightforward proof of Grushko's theorem, modelled on Stallings' 1965 proof, that used the techniques of [[Bass-Serre theory]].  The argument directly inspired the machinery of ''foldings'' for group actions on trees and for [[graph of groups|graphs of groups]] and  Dicks' even more straightforward proof of Grushko's theorem (see, for example,\n<ref name =\"WD\">Warren Dicks.

International Journal of Algebra and Computation, vol. 15 (2005), no. 1, pp. 95&ndash;128</ref>).\n\nGrushko's theorem is, in a sense, a starting point in Dunwoody's theory of ''accessibility'' for [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and [[finitely presented group]]s. Since the ranks of the free factors are smaller than the rank of a free product, Grushko's theorem implies that the process of iterated splitting of a finitely generated group ''G'' as a free product must terminate in a finite number of steps (more precisely, in at most rank(''G'') steps). There is a natural similar question for iterating [[Bass-Serre theory|splittings]] of  finitely generated groups over finite subgroups. [[Martin Dunwoody|Dunwoody]] proved that such a process must always terminate if a group ''G'' is [[finitely presented group|finitely presented]]<ref>Martin J. Dunwoody. ''The accessibility of finitely presented groups.''

Let ''H'' be a subgroup of ''G'' such that ''f''(''H'') = ''B''. Then ''H'' has a decomposition ''H'' = ∗<sub>''i''</sub> ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> such that ''f''(''H''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> for all ''i''.

It asserts that any nontrivial [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' can be decomposed as a [[free product]]\n\n:''G'' = ''A''<sub>1</sub>∗''A''<sub>2</sub>∗...∗''A''<sub>''r''</sub>∗''F''<sub>''s''</sub>, where ''s'' ≥ 0, ''r'' ≥ 0,\n\nwhere each of the groups ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> is nontrivial, freely indecomposable (that is, it cannot be decomposed as a free product) and not infinite cyclic, and where  ''F<sub>s</sub>'' is a [[free group]] of rank ''s'';\nmoreover, for a given ''G'',  the groups ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''r''</sub> are unique up to a permutation of their [[conjugacy class]]es in ''G'' (and, in particular, the sequence of [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]] types of these groups is unique up to a permutation) and the numbers ''s'' and ''r'' are unique as well.\n\nMore precisely, if ''G'' = ''B''<sub>1</sub>∗...∗''B''<sub>''k''</sub>∗''F''<sub>''t''</sub> is another such decomposition then ''k'' = ''r'', ''s'' = ''t'', and there exists a [[permutation group|permutation]] σ∈''S''<sub>''r''</sub> such that for each ''i''=1,...,''r'' the subgroups ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''B''<sub>σ(''i'')</sub> are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] in ''G''.\n\nThe existence of the above decomposition, called the '''Grushko decomposition''' of ''G'', is an immediate corollary of the original Grushko theorem, while the uniqueness statement requires additional arguments (see, for example<ref>John Stallings. [http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=SB_1975-1976__18__167_0 ''Coherence of 3-manifold fundamental groups.''] Séminaire Bourbaki, 18 (1975-1976), Exposé No. 481.</ref>).\n\nAlgorithmically computing the Grushko decomposition for specific classes of groups is a difficult problem which primarily requires being able to determine if a given group is freely decomposable.

Kneser,   ''Geschlossene Flächen in dreidimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeiten.''  Jahresber. Deutsch. Math. Verein., vol. 38  (1929),  pp. 248&ndash;260</ref>\n\n==Sketch of the proof using Bass-Serre theory==\n\nThe following is a sketch of the proof of Grushko's theorem based on the use of foldings techniques for groups acting on trees (see <ref name=\"WD\"/><ref name=\"St\"/><ref name=\"KWM\"/> for complete proofs using this argument).\n\nLet ''S''={''g''<sub>1</sub>,....,''g''<sub>''n''</sub>} be a finite generating set for ''G''=''A''∗''B''  of size |''S''|=''n''=rank(''G''). Realize ''G'' as the [[Bass-Serre theory|fundamental group of a graph of groups]] '''Y''' which is a single non-loop edge with vertex groups ''A'' and ''B'' and with the trivial edge group. Let <math>\\tilde{\\mathbf Y}</math> be the [[Bass-Serre covering tree]] for '''Y'''. Let ''F''=''F''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,....,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) be the [[free group]] with free basis ''x''<sub>1</sub>,....,''x''<sub>''n''</sub> and let φ<sub>0</sub>:''F'' → ''G'' be the [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] such that φ<sub>0</sub>(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)=''g''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i''=1,...,''n''. Realize ''F'' as the [[fundamental group]] of a graph ''Z''<sub>0</sub> which is the wedge of ''n'' circles that correspond to the elements ''x''<sub>1</sub>,....,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>. We also think of '''Z'''<sub>0</sub> as a [[graph of groups]] with the underlying graph ''Z''<sub>0</sub> and the trivial vertex and edge groups. Then the universal cover <math>\\tilde Z_0</math> of ''Z''<sub>0</sub>  and the [[Bass-Serre covering tree]] for '''Z'''<sub>0</sub> coincide. Consider a φ<sub>0</sub>-equivariant map <math>r_0:\\tilde Z_0\\to \\tilde{\\mathbf Y}</math> so that it sends vertices to vertices and edges to edge-paths. This map is non-injective and, since both the source and the target of the map are trees, this map ''\"folds\"'' some edge-pairs in the source. The [[graph of groups]] '''Z'''<sub>0</sub> serves as an initial approximation for '''Y'''.\n\nWe now start performing a sequence of \"folding moves\" on '''Z'''<sub>0</sub> (and on its [[Bass-Serre covering tree]]) to construct a sequence of [[graph of groups|graphs of groups]] '''Z'''<sub>0</sub>, '''Z'''<sub>1</sub>, '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>, ...., that form better and better approximations for '''Y'''. Each of the graphs of groups '''Z'''<sub>j</sub> has trivial edge groups and comes with the following additional structure: for each nontrivial vertex group of it there assigned a finite generating set of that vertex group. The ''complexity'' ''c''('''Z'''<sub>''j''</sub>) of '''Z'''<sub>''j''</sub> is the sum of the sizes of the generating sets of its vertex groups and the rank of the free group ''π''<sub>1</sub>(''Z''<sub>''j''</sub>). For the initial approximation graph we have ''c''('''Z'''<sub>0</sub>)=''n''.\n\nThe folding moves that take '''Z'''<sub>''j''</sub> to '''Z'''<sub>''j''+1</sub> can be of one of two types:\n*folds that identify two edges of the underlying graph with a common initial vertex but distinct end-vertices into a single edge; when such a fold is performed, the generating sets of the vertex groups and the terminal edges are \"joined\" together into a generating set of the new vertex group; the rank of the fundamental group of the underlying graph does not change under such a move.\n*folds that identify two edges, that already had common initial vertices and common terminal vertices, into a single edge; such a move decreases the rank of the fundamental group of the underlying graph by 1 and an element that corresponded to the loop in the graph that is being collapsed is \"added\" to the generating set of one of the vertex groups.\n\nOne sees that the folding moves do not increase complexity but they do decrease the number of edges in ''Z''<sub>''j''</sub>. Therefore, the folding process must terminate in a finite number of steps with a graph of groups '''Z'''<sub>''k''</sub> that cannot be folded any more. It follows from the basic [[Bass-Serre theory]] considerations that '''Z'''<sub>''k''</sub> must in fact be equal to the edge of groups '''Y''' and that '''Z'''<sub>''k''</sub> comes equipped with finite generating sets for the vertex groups ''A'' and ''B''. The sum of the sizes of these generating sets is the complexity of  '''Z'''<sub>''k''</sub> which is therefore less than or equal to ''c''('''Z'''<sub>0</sub>)=''n''. This implies that the sum of the ranks of the vertex groups ''A'' and ''B'' is at most ''n'', that is \nrank(''A'')+rank(''B'')≤rank(''G''), as required.\n\n==Sketch of Stalling's proof==\n[[John R. Stallings|Stallings]]' proof of Grushko Theorem follows from the following lemma.\n\n===Lemma===\nLet ''F'' be finitely generated free group, with ''n'' generators. Let ''G<sub>1</sub>'' and ''G<sub>2</sub>'' be two finitely presented groups. Suppose there exists a surjective homomorphism <math>\\phi:F\\rightarrow G_1\\ast G_2</math>, then there exists two subgroups ''F<sub>1</sub>'' and ''F<sub>2</sub>'' of ''F'' with <math>\\phi(F_1)=G_1</math> and <math>\\phi(F_2)=G_2</math> such that <math>F=F_1\\ast F_2</math>.\n\n'''Proof:''' \nWe give the proof assuming that ''F'' has no generator which is mapped to the identity of <math>G_1\\ast G_2</math>, for if there are such generators, they may be added to any of <math>F_1</math> or <math>F_2</math>.\n\nThe following general results are used in the proof.\n\n1. There is a one or two dimensional [[CW complex]], ''Z'' with [[fundamental group]] ''F''. By [[Van Kampen theorem]], the [[Bouquet of circles|wedge of ''n'' circles]] is one such space.\n\n2. There exists a two complex <math> X=X_1\\cup X_2</math> where <math> \\{p\\}=X_1\\cap X_2</math> is a point on a one cell of ''X'' such that ''X<sub>1</sub>'' and ''X<sub>2</sub>'' are two complexes  with fundamental groups  ''G<sub>1</sub>'' and ''G<sub>2</sub>''  respectively. Note that by the [[Van Kampen theorem]], this implies that the fundamental group of ''X'' is <math>G_1\\ast G_2</math>.\n\n3. There exists a map <math>f:Z\\rightarrow X</math> such that the induced map <math>f_\\ast</math> on the fundamental groups is same as <math>\\phi</math>\n\nFor the sake of convenience, let us denote <math>f^{-1}(X_1)=:Z_1</math> and  <math>f^{-1}(X_2)=:Z_2</math>. \nSince no generator of ''F'' maps to identity, the set <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math> has no loops, for if it does, these will correspond to circles of ''Z'' which map to <math>p\\in X</math>, which in turn correspond to generators of ''F'' which go to the identity.  So, the components of <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math> are contractible.\nIn the case where <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math> has only one component, by Van Kampen's theorem, we are done, as in that case, :<math>F=\\Pi_1(Z_1)\\ast\\Pi_1(Z_2)</math>.\n\nThe general proof follows by reducing ''Z'' to a space homotopically equivalent to it, but with fewer components in <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>, and thus by induction on the components of <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>.\n\nSuch a reduction of ''Z'' is done by attaching discs along  binding ties.\n\nWe call a map <math> \\gamma :[0,1]\\rightarrow Z</math> a '''binding tie''' if it satisfies the following properties\n\n1. It is '''monochromatic''' i.e. <math> \\gamma([0,1])\\subseteq Z_1</math> or <math> \\gamma([0,1])\\subseteq Z_2</math>\n\n2. It is a '''tie''' i.e. <math>\\gamma(0)</math> and <math>\\gamma(1)</math> lie in different components of <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>.\n\n3. It is '''null''' i.e. <math> f \\circ \\gamma([0,1])</math> is null homotopic in '''X'''.\n\nLet us assume that such a binding tie exists. Let <math>\\gamma</math> be the binding tie.\n\nConsider the map <math>g:[0,1]\\rightarrow D^2</math> given by <math>g(t)= e^{it}</math>. This map is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image. Define the space <math>Z^'</math> as \n:<math>Z'= Z \\coprod\\! D^2/\\! \\sim</math> where :<math>x\\!\\!\\sim y \\text{ iff}  \n\\begin{cases}\nx=y, \\mbox{ or }\\\\\nx=\\gamma (t) \\text{ and } y= g(t) \\text{ for some } t\\in [0,1]\\mbox{ or }\\\\\nx=g (t) \\text{ and } y= \\gamma (t) \\text{ for some } t\\in [0,1]\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nNote that the space ''Z' '' deformation retracts to ''Z''  \nWe first extend ''f'' to a function <math>f^{''}:Z\\coprod \\partial D^2/\\!\\sim</math> as \n:<math> f^{''}(x) = \\begin{cases}f(x),\\ x\\in Z\\\\ p \\text{ otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\nSince the <math> f(\\gamma)</math> is null homotopic, <math>f''</math> further extends to the interior of the disc, and therefore, to <math>Z^'</math> ''.\nLet <math>Z_i^' = f^{'-1}(X_i)</math> ''i = 1,2''.\nAs <math>\\gamma(0)</math> and <math>\\gamma(1)</math> lay in different components of <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>, <math>Z_1^'\\cap Z_2^'</math> has one less component than <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>.\n\n===Construction of binding tie===\nThe binding tie is constructed in two steps.\n\n'''Step 1:''' Constructing a '''null tie''':\n\nConsider a map <math> \\gamma' :[0,1]\\rightarrow Z</math> with <math>\\gamma' (0)</math> and <math>\\gamma' (1)</math> in different components of <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>. Since <math>f_\\ast</math> is surjective, there exits a loop <math>\\!\\lambda</math> based at γ'(1) such that <math>\\! f(\\gamma')</math> and  <math>\\! f(\\lambda)</math> are homotopically equivalent in ''X''.\nIf we define a curve <math> \\gamma :[0,1]\\rightarrow Z</math> as <math>\\gamma(t)= \\gamma'\\ast\\lambda(t)</math> for all <math>t\\in [0,1]</math>, then <math>\\!\\gamma</math> is a null tie.\n\n'''Step 2:''' Making the null tie '''monochromatic''':\n\nThe tie <math>\\!\\gamma</math> may be written as <math>\\gamma_1\\ast \\gamma_2\\ast \\cdots \\ast\\gamma_m</math> where each <math>\\gamma_i</math> is a curve in <math>Z_1</math> or <math>Z_2</math> such that if <math>\\gamma_i</math> is in <math>Z_1</math>, then <math>\\gamma_{i+1}</math> is in <math>Z_2</math> and vice versa. This also implies that <math>f(\\gamma_i)</math> is a loop based at ''p'' in ''X''. So,\n:<math>\n[e]=[f(\\gamma)]=[f(\\gamma_1)]\\ast\\cdots\\ast [f(\\gamma_m)]</math>\nHence, <math> [f(\\gamma_j)]=[e]</math> for some ''j''. \nIf this   <math>\\!\\gamma_j</math> is a tie, then we have a monochromatic, null tie. \nIf <math>\\!\\gamma_j</math> is not a tie, then the end points of <math>\\!\\gamma_j</math> are in the same component of <math>Z_1\\cap Z_2</math>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially in the area of [[abstract algebra]] dealing with ordered structures on [[abelian group]]s, the '''Hahn embedding theorem''' gives a simple description of all [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered abelian group]]s. It is named after [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe theorem states that every [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered abelian group]] ''G'' can be embedded as an ordered subgroup of the additive group ℝ<sup>Ω</sup> endowed with a [[lexicographical order]], where ℝ is the additive group of [[real numbers]] (with its standard order), Ω is the set of ''Archimedean equivalence classes'' of ''G'', and ℝ<sup>Ω</sup> is the set of all functions from Ω to ℝ which vanish outside a well-ordered set.\n   \nLet 0 denote the identity element of ''G''. For any nonzero element ''g'' of ''G'', exactly one of the elements ''g'' or &minus;''g'' is greater than 0; denote this element by |''g''|.  Two nonzero elements ''g'' and ''h'' of ''G'' are ''Archimedean equivalent'' if there exist [[natural number]]s ''N'' and ''M'' such that ''N''|''g''|&nbsp;>&nbsp;|h| and ''M''|''h''|&nbsp;>&nbsp;|g|.  Intuitively, this means that neither ''g'' nor ''h'' is \"infinitesimal\" with respect to the other.  The group ''G'' is [[Archimedean group|Archimedean]] if ''all'' nonzero elements are Archimedean-equivalent.  In this case, Ω is a singleton, so ℝ<sup>Ω</sup>  is just the group of real numbers.  Then Hahn's Embedding Theorem reduces to [[Otto Hölder|Hölder]]'s theorem (which states that a linearly ordered abelian group is [[Archimedean group|Archimedean]] if and only if it is a subgroup of the ordered additive group of the real numbers).\n\n{{harvtxt|Gravett|1956}} gives a clear statement and proof of the theorem.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Krull–Schmidt theorem''' states that a [[group (mathematics)|group]] subjected to certain [[finite set|finiteness]] conditions on [[chain (order theory)|chain]]s of [[subgroup]]s, can be uniquely written as a finite [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of indecomposable subgroups.\n\n==Definitions==\nWe say that a group ''G'' satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] (ACC) on subgroups if every [[sequence]] of subgroups of ''G'':\n\n:<math>1 = G_0 \\le G_1 \\le G_2 \\le \\cdots\\, </math>\n\nis eventually constant, i.e., there exists ''N'' such that ''G''<sub>''N''</sub> = ''G''<sub>''N''+1</sub> = ''G''<sub>''N''+2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;...&nbsp;. We say that ''G'' satisfies the ACC on normal subgroups if every such sequence of normal subgroups of ''G'' eventually becomes constant.\n\nLikewise, one can define the '''descending chain condition''' on (normal) subgroups, by looking at all decreasing sequences of (normal) subgroups:\n\n:<math>G = G_0 \\ge G_1 \\ge G_2 \\ge \\cdots.\\, </math>\n\nClearly, all finite groups satisfy both ACC and DCC on subgroups. The [[infinite cyclic group]] <math>\\mathbf{Z}</math> satisfies ACC but not DCC, since (2)&nbsp;>&nbsp;(2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;>&nbsp;(2)<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;>&nbsp;... is an infinite decreasing sequence of subgroups.

Here, uniqueness means direct decompositions into indecomposable subgroups have the exchange property.  That is: suppose <math>G = H_1 \\times H_2 \\times \\cdots \\times H_l\\,</math> is another expression of <math>G</math> as a product of indecomposable subgroups.

Moreover, any indecomposable subgroup is (trivially) the one-term direct product of itself, hence decomposable.  If Krull-Schmidt fails, then {{mvar|S}} contains {{mvar|G}}; so we may iteratively construct a descending series of direct factors; this contradicts the DCC.  One can then invert the construction to show that ''all'' direct factors of {{mvar|G}} appear in this way.<ref name=\"Hungerford2012\">{{cite book|author=Thomas W.

Miller]] where direct products of abelian groups were considered.  Wedderburn's theorem is stated as an exchange property between direct decompositions of maximum length.  However, Wedderburn's proof makes no use of automorphisms.\n\nThe thesis of [[Robert Remak (mathematician)|Robert Remak]] (1911) derived the same uniqueness result as Wedderburn but also proved (in modern terminology) that the group of central automorphisms acts transitively on the set of direct decompositions of maximum length of a finite group.   From that stronger theorem Remak also proved various corollaries including that groups with a trivial center and perfect groups have a unique [[Remak decomposition]].\n\n[[Otto Schmidt]] (''Sur les produits directs, S. M. F. Bull. 41'' (1913), 161–164), simplified the main theorems of Remak to the 3 page predecessor to today's textbook proofs.  His method improves Remak's use of idempotents to create the appropriate central automorphisms.  Both Remak and Schmidt published subsequent proofs and corollaries to their theorems.\n\n[[Wolfgang Krull]] (''Über verallgemeinerte endliche Abelsche Gruppen, M. Z. 23'' (1925) 161–196), returned to [[George Abram Miller|G.A. Miller]]'s original problem of direct products of abelian groups by extending to abelian operator groups with ascending and descending chain conditions.  This is most often stated in the language of modules.  His proof observes that the idempotents used in the proofs of Remak and Schmidt can be restricted to module homomorphisms; the remaining details of the proof are largely unchanged.\n\n[[O. Ore]] unified the proofs from various categories include finite groups, abelian operator groups, rings and algebras by proving the exchange theorem of Wedderburn holds for modular lattices with descending and ascending chain conditions.  This proof makes no use of idempotents and does not reprove the transitivity of Remak's theorems.\n\nKurosh's ''The Theory of Groups'' and Zassenhaus' ''The Theory of Groups'' include the proofs of Schmidt and Ore under the name of Remak–Schmidt but acknowledge Wedderburn and Ore.  Later texts use the title Krull–Schmidt ([[Thomas W. Hungerford|Hungerford]]'s Algebra) and Krull–Schmidt–[[Goro Azumaya|Azumaya]] (Curtis–Reiner).  The name Krull–Schmidt is now popularly substituted for any theorem concerning uniqueness of direct products of maximum size.  Some authors choose to call direct decompositions of maximum-size Remak decompositions to honor his contributions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Krull–Schmidt category]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* A.

Let ''X'' be the Bass–Serre universal covering tree for the graph of groups '''Y'''. Since ''H'' ≤ ''G'' also acts on ''X'', consider the quotient graph of groups '''Z''' for the action of ''H'' on ''X''. The vertex groups of '''Z''' are subgroups of ''G''-stabilizers of vertices of ''X'', that is, they are conjugate in ''G'' to subgroups of ''A'' and ''B''. The edge groups of '''Z''' are trivial since the ''G''-stabilizers of edges of ''X'' were trivial. By the fundamental theorem of Bass–Serre theory, ''H'' is canonically [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the fundamental group of the [[graph of groups]] '''Z'''. Since the edge groups of '''Z''' are trivial, it follows that ''H'' is equal to the free product of the vertex groups of '''Z''' and the free group ''F''(''X'') which is the [[fundamental group]] (in the standard topological sense) of the underlying graph ''Z'' of '''Z'''. This implies the conclusion of the Kurosh subgroup theorem.\n\n==Extension==\nThe result extends to the case that ''G'' is the [[amalgamated product]] along a common subgroup ''C'', under the condition that ''H'' meets every conjugate of ''C'' only in the identity element.<ref>{{cite book | title=Trees | first=Jean-Pierre | last=Serre | authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre | publisher=Springer | year=2003 | isbn=3-540-44237-5 | pages=56–57 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[HNN extension]]\n*[[Geometric group theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric group theory]]\n[[Category:Theorems in group theory]]"

The subgroup H contains only 0 and 4, and is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}</math>. There are four left cosets of H: H itself, 1+H, 2+H, and 3+H (written using additive notation since this is an [[Abelian group|additive group]]). Together they partition the entire group G into equal-size, non-overlapping sets. Thus the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] [G : H] is 4.]]\n'''Lagrange's theorem''', in the [[mathematics]] of [[group theory]], states that for any [[finite group]] ''G'', the [[order (group theory)|order]] (number of elements) of every [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G'' divides the order of ''G''.  The theorem is named after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]].\n\n== Proof ==\nThis can be shown using the concept of left [[coset]]s of {{mvar|''H''}} in {{mvar|''G''}}. The left cosets are the [[equivalence class]]es of a certain [[equivalence relation]] on {{mvar|''G''}} and therefore form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of {{mvar|''G''}}. Specifically, {{mvar|''x''}} and {{mvar|''y''}} in {{mvar|''G''}} are related if and only if there exists {{mvar|''h''}} in {{mvar|''H''}} such that ''x = yh''. If we can show that all cosets of {{mvar|''H''}} have the same number of elements, then each coset of {{mvar|''H''}} has precisely |{{mvar|''H''}}| elements. We are then done since the order of {{mvar|''H''}} times the number of cosets is equal to the number of elements in {{mvar|''G''}}, thereby proving that the order of {{mvar|''H''}} divides the order of {{mvar|''G''}}. \n\nTo show any two left cosets have the same cardinality, it suffices to demonstrate a [[bijection]] between them.  Suppose {{math|''aH''}} and {{math|''bH''}} are two left cosets of {{mvar|''H''}}.  Then define a map {{math|''f'' : ''aH'' → ''bH''}} by setting {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''ba''<sup>−1</sup>''x''}}. This map is [[bijective]] because it has an inverse given by <math>f^{-1}(y) = ab^{-1}y\\mbox{.}</math>\n\nThis proof also shows that the quotient of the orders |{{mvar|''G''}}| / |{{mvar|''H''}}| is equal to the [[index of a subgroup|index]] {{math|[''G'' : ''H'']}} (the number of left cosets of {{mvar|''H''}} in {{mvar|''G''}}). If we allow {{mvar|''G''}} and {{mvar|''H''}} to be infinite, and write this statement as\n\n:<math>\\left|G\\right| = \\left[G : H\\right] \\cdot \\left|H\\right|\\mbox{,}</math>\n\nthen, seen as a statement about [[cardinal number]]s, it is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== Applications ==\nA consequence of the theorem is that the [[order (group theory)|order of any element]] ''a'' of a finite group (i.e. the smallest positive integer number ''k'' with ''a''<sup>''k''</sup> = ''e,'' where ''e'' is the identity element of the group) divides the order of that group, since the order of ''a'' is equal to the order of the [[cyclic group|cyclic]] subgroup [[generating set of a group|generated]] by ''a''. If the group has ''n'' elements, it follows\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle a^n = e\\mbox{.}</math>\n\nThis can be used to prove [[Fermat's little theorem]] and its generalization, [[Euler's theorem]].  These special cases were known long before the general theorem was proved.\n\nThe theorem also shows that any group of prime order is cyclic and [[simple group|simple]]. This in turn can be used to prove [[Wilson's theorem]], that if ''p'' is prime then ''p'' is a factor of <math>(p-1)!+1</math>.\n\nLagrange's theorem can also be used to show that there are infinitely many [[primes]]: if there were a largest prime ''p'', then a prime divisor ''q'' of the [[Mersenne number]] <math>2^p -1</math> would be such that the order of ''2'' in the [[multiplicative group]] <math>(\\mathbb Z/q\\mathbb Z)^*</math> (see [[modular arithmetic]]) divides the order of <math>( \\mathbb Z/q \\mathbb Z)^*</math>, which is <math>q-1</math>. Hence <math>p<q</math>, contradicting the assumption that ''p'' is the largest prime.<ref>[[Martin Aigner]] and [[Günter M. Ziegler]]: ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]'', Springer, Berlin, 1998, Chapter 1</ref>\n\n== Existence of subgroups of given order ==\nLagrange's theorem raises the converse question as to whether every divisor of the order of a group is the order of some subgroup. This does not hold in general: given a finite group ''G'' and a divisor ''d'' of |''G''|, there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of ''G'' with order ''d''. The smallest example is ''A''<sub>4</sub> (the [[alternating group]] of degree 4), which has 12 elements but no subgroup of order 6.\n\nA \"Converse of Lagrange's Theorem\" (CLT) group is a finite group with the property that for every divisor of the order of the group, there is a subgroup of that order.  It is known that a CLT group must be [[solvable group|solvable]] and that every [[supersolvable group]] is a CLT group. However, there exist solvable groups that are not CLT (for example, ''A''<sub>4</sub>) and CLT groups that are not supersolvable (for example, ''S''<sub>4</sub>, the symmetric group of degree 4).\n\nThere are partial converses to Lagrange's theorem.  For general groups, [[Cauchy's theorem (group theory)|Cauchy's theorem]] guarantees the existence of an element, and hence of a cyclic subgroup, of order any prime dividing the group order. [[Sylow's theorem]] extends this to the existence of a subgroup of order equal to the maximal power of any prime dividing the group order.  For solvable groups,  [[Hall subgroup#Hall's theorem|Hall's theorems]] assert the existence of a subgroup of order equal to any [[unitary divisor]] of the group order (that is, a divisor coprime to its cofactor).\n\n=== Disproving the converse of Lagrange's theorem ===\nThe converse of Lagrange's theorem states that if <math>d</math> is a [[divisor]] of the order of a group <math>G</math>, then there exists a subgroup <math>H</math> where <math>|H|=d</math>.\n\nWe will examine the group <math>A_4</math>, the set of even [[Permutation group|permutations]] as the subgroup of the [[Symmetric group]] <math>S_4</math>. \n\n:<math>A_4=\\{e,(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23),(123),(132),(124),(142),(134),(143),(234),(243)\\}</math>\n\n<math>|A_4|=12</math> so the divisors are <math>1,2,3,4,6,12</math>. Assume to the contrary that there exists a subgroup <math>H</math> in <math>A_4</math> with <math>|H|=6</math>.\n\nLet <math>V</math> be the [[Cyclic group|non-cyclic]] subgroup of <math>A_4</math> called the [[Klein four-group]].\n\n:<math>V=\\{e,(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\\}</math>.\n\nLet <math>K=H \\cap V</math>. Since both <math>H</math> and <math>V</math> are subgroups of <math>A_4</math>, <math>K</math> is also a subgroup of <math>A_4</math>. \n\nFrom Lagrange's theorem, the order of <math>K</math> must divide both <math>6</math> and <math>4</math>, the orders of <math>H</math> and <math>V</math> respectively. The only two positive integers that divide both <math>6</math> and <math>4</math> are <math>1</math> and <math>2</math>. So <math>|K|=1</math> or <math>2</math>.\n\nAssume <math>|K|=1</math>, then <math>|K|=\\{e\\}</math>. If <math>H</math> does not share any elements with <math>V</math>, then the 5 elements in <math>H</math> besides the [[Identity element]] <math>e</math> must be of the form <math>(efd)</math> where <math>e,f,d</math> are distinct elements in <math>\\{1,2,3,4\\}</math>.\n\nSince any element of the form <math>(efd)</math> squared is <math>(edf)</math>, and <math>(efd)(edf) = e</math>, any element of <math>H</math> in the form <math>(efd)</math> must be paired with its inverse. Specifically, the remaining 5 elements of <math>H</math> must come from distinct pairs of elements in <math>A_4</math> that are not in <math>V</math>. This is impossible since pairs of elements must be even and cannot total up to 5 elements. Thus, the assumptions that <math>|K|=\\{e\\}</math> is wrong, so <math>|K|=2</math>.\n\nThen, <math>|K|=\\{e,v\\}</math> where <math>v \\in V</math>, <math>v</math> must be in the form <math>(ab)(cd)</math> where <math>a,b,c,d</math> are distinct elements of <math>\\{1,2,3,4\\}</math>. The other four elements in <math>H</math> are cycles of length 3.\n\nNote that the cosets [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by a subgroup of a group is a partition of the group. The cosets generated by a specific subgroup are either identical to each other or [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]. The index of a subgroup in a group <math>[H : A_4] = |A_4|/|H|</math> is the number of cosets generated by that subgroup. Since <math>|H| = 6</math> and\n<math>|A_4| = 12</math>, <math>H</math> will generate two left cosets, one that is equal to <math>H</math> and another, <math>aH</math>, that is of length 6 and includes all the elements in <math>A_4</math> not in <math>H</math>.\n\nSince there are only 2 distinct cosets generated by <math>H</math>, then <math>H</math> must be normal. Because of that, <math>H = gHg^{-1} \\forall g \\in A_4</math>. In particular, this is true for <math>g = (abc) \\in A_4</math>. Since <math>H=gHg^{-1}, gvg^{-1} \\in H</math>.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that <math>a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4</math>. Then <math>g = (123), v=(12)(34),g^{-1}=(132),gv=(134),gvg^{-1}=(14)(23)</math>. Transforming back, we get <math>gvg^{-1}=(ad)(bc)</math>. Because <math>V</math> contains all disjoint transpositions in <math>A_4</math>, <math>gvg^{-1} \\in V</math>. Hence, <math>gvg^{-1} \\in H \\cap V = K</math>. \n\nSince <math>gvg^{-1} \\neq v</math>, we have demonstrated that there is a third element in <math>K</math>. But earlier we showed that <math>|K|=2</math>, so we have a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, our original assumption that there is a subgroup of order 6 is not true and consequently there is no subgroup of order 6 in <math>A_4</math> and the converse of Lagrange's theorem is not necessarily true.\n\n== History ==\nLagrange did not prove Lagrange's theorem in its general form. He stated, in his article ''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations'',<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lagrange|first= Joseph-Louis | authorlink= Joseph-Louis Lagrange | year = 1771 | title = Suite des réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations.

(For example, if the variables {{mvar|''x''}}, {{mvar|''y''}}, and {{mvar|''z''}} are permuted in all 6 possible ways in the polynomial {{math|''x'' + ''y'' &minus; ''z''}} then we get a total of 3 different polynomials: {{math|''x'' + ''y'' &minus; ''z'', ''x'' + ''z'' &minus; ''y'', and ''y'' + ''z'' &minus; ''x''}}.  Note that 3 is a factor of 6.) The number of such polynomials is the index in the [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S''<sub>n</sub>}} of the subgroup {{mvar|''H''}} of permutations that preserve the polynomial.  (For the example of {{math|''x'' + ''y'' &minus; ''z''}}, the subgroup {{mvar|''H''}} in {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} contains the identity and the transposition {{math|(''x&nbsp;y'')}}.) So the size of {{mvar|''H''}} divides {{math|''n''!}}.   With the later development of abstract groups, this result of Lagrange on polynomials was recognized to extend to the general theorem about finite groups which now bears his name.\n\nIn his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' in 1801, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] proved Lagrange's theorem for the special case of <math>(\\mathbb Z/p \\mathbb Z)^*</math>, the multiplicative group of nonzero integers [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] {{mvar|''p''}}, where {{mvar|''p''}} is a prime.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gauss|first=Carl Friedrich|author-link=Carl Friedrich Gauss|title=Disquisitiones Arithmeticae|location=Leipzig (Lipsia)|language=la|publisher=G.

The '''second Prüfer theorem''' states that a [[countable set|countable]]  periodic abelian group whose elements have finite [[height (abelian group)|height]] is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups.

Theorem 25, which he credits to [[Issai Schur]], proves the existence of a complement, and theorem 27 proves that all complements are conjugate under the assumption that  <math>N</math> or <math>G/N</math> is solvable. It is not easy to find an explicit statement of the existence of a complement in Schur's published works, though the results of {{harvs|txt|last=Schur|year=1904|year2=1907}} on the [[Schur multiplier]] imply the existence of a complement in the special case when the normal subgroup is in the center. Zassenhaus pointed out that the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem for non-solvable groups would follow if all groups of odd order are solvable, which was later proved by Feit and Thompson. [[Ernst Witt]] showed that it would also follow from the [[Schreier conjecture]] (see {{harvs|txt|last=Witt|year=1998|loc=p.277}} for Witt's unpublished 1937 note about this), but the Schreier conjecture has only been proved using the classification of finite simple groups, which is far harder than the Feit–Thompson theorem.\n\n==Examples==\nIf we do not impose the coprime condition, the theorem is not true: consider for example the [[cyclic group]] <math>C_4</math> and its normal subgroup <math>C_2</math>. Then if <math>C_4</math> were a semidirect product of <math>C_2</math> and <math>C_4 / C_2 \\cong C_2</math> then <math>C_4</math> would have to contain two [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of order 2, but it only contains one. Another way to explain this impossibility of splitting <math>C_4</math> (i.e. expressing it as a semidirect product) is to observe that the [[automorphism]]s of <math>C_2</math> are the [[trivial group]], so the only possible [semi]direct product of <math>C_2</math> with itself is a direct product (which gives rise to the [[Klein four-group]], a group that is non-isomorphic with <math>C_4</math>).\n\nAn example where the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem does apply is the [[symmetric group]] on 3 symbols, <math>S_3</math>, which has a normal subgroup of order 3 (isomorphic with <math>C_3</math>) which in turn has [[Index_of_a_subgroup|index]] 2 in <math>S_3</math> (in agreement with the [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|theorem of Lagrange]]), so <math>S_3 / C_3 \\cong C_2</math>. Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime, the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem applies and <math>S_3 \\cong C_3 \\rtimes C_2</math>. Note that the automorphism group of <math>C_3</math> is <math>C_2</math> and the automorphism of <math>C_3</math> used in the semidirect product that gives rise to <math>S_3</math> is the non-trivial automorphism that permutes the two non-identity elements of <math>C_3</math>. Furthermore, the three subgroups of order 2 in <math>S_3</math> (any of which can serve as a complement to <math>C_3</math> in <math>S_3</math>) are conjugate to each other.\n\nThe non-triviality of the (additional) conjugacy conclusion can be illustrated with the Klein four-group <math>V</math> as the non-example. Any of the three proper subgroups of <math>V</math> (all of which have order 2) is normal in <math>V</math>; fixing one of these subgroups, any of the other two remaining (proper) subgroups complements it in <math>V</math>, but none of these three subgroups of <math>V</math> is a conjugate of any other one, because <math>V</math> is [[Abelian group|Abelian]].\n\nThe [[quaternion group]] has normal subgroups of order 4 and 2 but is not a [semi]direct product. Schur's papers at the beginning of the 20th century introduced the notion of [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] to address examples such as such <math>C_4</math> and the quaternions.\n\n==Proof==\n\nThe existence of a complement to a normal Hall subgroup ''H'' of a finite group ''G'' can be proved in the following steps:\n#By induction on the order of ''G'', we can assume that it is true for any smaller group.\n#If ''H'' is abelian, then the existence of a complement follows from the fact that the cohomology group ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''G''/''H'',''H'') vanishes (as ''H'' and ''G''/''H'' have coprime orders) and the fact that all complements are conjugate follows from the vanishing of ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''G''/''H'',''H'').\n#If ''H'' is solvable, it has a nontrivial abelian subgroup ''A'' that is characteristic in ''H'' and therefore normal in ''G''. Applying the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem to ''G''/''A'' reduces the proof to the case when ''H''=''A'' is abelian which has been done in the previous step.\n#If the normalizer ''N''=''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''P'') of every ''p''-Sylow subgroup ''P'' of ''H'' is equal to ''G'', then ''H''  is nilpotent, and in particular solvable, so the theorem follows by the previous step.\n#If the normalizer ''N''=''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''P'') of some ''p''-Sylow subgroup ''P'' of ''H'' is smaller than ''G'', then by induction the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem holds for ''N'', and a complement of ''N''∩''H'' in ''N'' is a complement for ''H'' in ''G'' because ''G''=''NH''.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | first=Joseph J. | last=Rotman | title=An Introduction to the Theory of Groups | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | volume=148 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4176-8 | mr=1307623 | location=New York | publisher=Springer–Verlag | edition=Fourth | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-387-94285-8}}\n*{{cite book | first1=David S. | last1=Dummit | first2=Richard M. | last2=Foote | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | year=2004 | edition=Third | mr=2286236 | isbn=978-0-471-43334-7 | location=Hoboken, NJ}}\n*{{citation|mr=0051226\n|last=Gaschütz|first= Wolfgang\n|title=Zur Erweiterungstheorie der endlichen Gruppen\n|journal=J.

      "text": "In the mathematical subject of [[group theory]], the '''Stallings theorem about ends of groups''' states that a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' has more than one end if and only if the group ''G'' admits a nontrivial decomposition as an [[free product with amalgamation|amalgamated free product]] or an [[HNN extension]] over a finite [[subgroup]]. In the modern language of [[Bass–Serre theory]] the theorem says that a finitely generated group ''G'' has more than one end if and only if ''G'' admits a nontrivial (that is, without a global fixed point) [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on a simplicial [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions.\n\nThe theorem was proved by [[John R. Stallings]], first in the [[torsion-free group|torsion-free]] case (1968)<ref>John R. Stallings. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1970577 ''On torsion-free groups with infinitely many ends.''] [[Annals of Mathematics]] (2), vol. 88 (1968), pp. 312&ndash;334</ref> and then in the general case (1971).<ref>John Stallings. ''Group theory and three-dimensional manifolds.'' A James K. Whittemore Lecture in Mathematics given at Yale University, 1969. Yale Mathematical Monographs, 4. Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn.-London, 1971.</ref>\n\n==Ends of graphs==\n{{main|End (graph theory)}}\nLet Γ be a connected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] where the degree of every vertex is finite. One can view Γ as a [[topological space]] by giving it the natural structure of a one-dimensional [[cell complex]].  Then the ends of Γ are the [[End (topology)|ends]] of this topological space. A more explicit definition of the number of [[End (graph theory)|ends of a graph]] is presented below for completeness.\n\nLet ''n'' ≥ 0 be a non-negative integer. The graph Γ is said to satisfy ''e''(Γ) ≤ ''n'' if for every finite collection ''F'' of edges of Γ the graph Γ&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''F'' has at most ''n'' infinite [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]]. By definition, ''e''(Γ) = ''m'' if ''e''(Γ) ≤ ''m'' and if for every 0 ≤ ''n'' < ''m'' the statement ''e''(Γ) ≤ ''n'' is false. Thus ''e''(Γ) = ''m'' if ''m'' is the smallest nonnegative integer ''n'' such that ''e''(Γ) ≤ ''n''. If there does not exist an integer ''n'' ≥ 0 such that ''e''(Γ) ≤ ''n'', put ''e''(Γ) = ∞. The number ''e''(Γ) is called ''the number of ends of'' Γ.\n\nInformally, ''e''(Γ) is the number of \"connected components at infinity\" of Γ. If ''e''(Γ) = ''m'' < ∞, then for any finite set ''F'' of edges of Γ there exists a finite set ''K'' of edges of Γ with ''F'' ⊆ ''K'' such that Γ&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''F'' has exactly ''m'' infinite connected components.  If ''e''(Γ) = ∞, then for any finite set ''F'' of edges of Γ and for any integer ''n'' ≥ 0 there exists a finite set ''K'' of edges of Γ with ''F'' ⊆ ''K'' such that Γ&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''K'' has at least ''n'' infinite connected components.\n\n==Ends of groups==\n\nLet ''G'' be a [[finitely generated group]]. Let ''S'' ⊆ ''G'' be a finite [[generating set of a group|generating set]] of ''G'' and let Γ(''G'',&nbsp;''S'') be the [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'' with respect to ''S''. The ''number of ends of'' ''G'' is defined as ''e''(''G'') = e(Γ(''G'',&nbsp;''S'')). A basic fact in the theory of ends of groups says that e(Γ(''G'',&nbsp;''S'')) does not depend on the choice of a finite [[generating set of a group|generating set]] ''S'' of ''G'', so that ''e''(''G'') is well-defined.\n\n===Basic facts and examples===\n*For a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' we have ''e''(''G'') = 0 if and only if ''G'' is finite.\n*For the [[infinite cyclic group]] <math>\\mathbb Z</math> we have <math>e(\\mathbb Z)=2.</math>\n*For the [[free abelian group]] of rank two <math>\\mathbb Z^2</math> we have <math>e(\\mathbb Z^2)=1.</math>\n*For a [[free group]] ''F''(''X'') where 1 < |''X''| < ∞ we have ''e''(''F''(''X'')) = ∞\n===Freudenthal-Hopf theorems===\n[[Hans Freudenthal]]<ref>H.

Helv. 16, (1944). 81-100</ref> established in the 1940s the following two facts: \n*For any [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' we have ''e''(''G'') ∈ {0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;∞}.\n*For any [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' we have ''e''(''G'') = 2 if and only if ''G'' is [[virtually]] [[infinite cyclic group|infinite cyclic]] (that is, ''G'' contains an infinite cyclic [[subgroup]] of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]]).\n[[C._T._C._Wall|Charles T. C. Wall]] proved in 1967 the following complementary fact<ref>Lemma 4.1 in C. T. C. Wall, Poincaré Complexes: I. Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 86, No. 2 (Sep., 1967), pp. 213-245</ref>:\n*A group ''G'' is virtually infinite cyclic if and only if it has a normal subgroup ''W'' such that ''G/W'' is either infinite cyclic or [[infinite dihedral group|infinite dihedral]].\n\n===Cuts and almost invariant sets===\nLet ''G'' be a [[finitely generated group]], ''S'' ⊆ ''G'' be a finite [[generating set of a group|generating set]] of ''G'' and let Γ = Γ(''G'',&nbsp;''S'') be the [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'' with respect to ''S''. For a subset ''A'' ⊆ ''G'' denote by ''A''<sup>∗</sup> the complement ''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''A'' of ''A'' in ''G''.\n\nFor a subset ''A'' ⊆ ''G'', the ''edge boundary'' or the ''co-boundary'' ''δA'' of ''A'' consists of all (topological) edges of Γ connecting a vertex from A with a vertex from ''A''<sup>∗</sup>. \nNote that by definition ''δA'' = ''δA''<sup>∗</sup>.\n\nAn ordered pair (''A'',&nbsp;''A''<sup>∗</sup>) is called a ''cut'' in Γ if  ''δA'' is finite. A cut (''A'',''A''<sup>∗</sup>) is called ''essential'' if both the sets  ''A'' and ''A''<sup>∗</sup> are infinite.\n\nA subset ''A'' ⊆ ''G'' is called ''almost invariant'' if for every ''g''∈''G'' the [[symmetric difference]] between ''A'' and ''Ag'' is finite. It is easy to see that  (''A'', ''A''<sup>∗</sup>) is a cut if and only if the sets ''A'' and ''A''<sup>∗</sup> are almost invariant (equivalently,  if and only if the set ''A'' is almost invariant).\n\n====Cuts and ends====\nA simple but important observation states:\n\n:''e''(''G'') > 1 if and only if there exists at least one essential cut (''A'',''A''<sup>∗</sup>) in &Gamma;.\n\n====Cuts and splittings over finite groups====\n\nIf ''G'' = ''H''∗''K'' where ''H'' and ''K'' are nontrivial [[finitely generated group]]s then the [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'' has at least one essential cut and hence ''e''(''G'') > 1. Indeed, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be finite generating sets for ''H'' and ''K'' accordingly so that ''S'' = ''X''&nbsp;∪&nbsp;''Y'' is a finite generating set for ''G'' and let Γ=Γ(''G'',''S'') be the [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'' with respect to ''S''. Let ''A'' consist of the trivial element and all the elements of ''G'' whose normal form expressions for ''G'' = ''H''∗''K'' starts with a nontrivial element of ''H''.  Thus ''A''<sup>∗</sup> consists of all elements of ''G'' whose normal form expressions for ''G'' = ''H''∗''K'' starts with a nontrivial element of ''K''. It is not hard to see that (''A'',''A''<sup>∗</sup>) is an essential cut in Γ so that ''e''(''G'') > 1.\n\nA more precise version of this argument shows that for a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'':  \n*If ''G'' = ''H''∗<sub>''C''</sub>''K'' is a [[free product with amalgamation]] where ''C'' is a finite group such that ''C'' ≠ ''H'' and ''C'' ≠ ''K'' then ''H'' and ''K'' are finitely generated and ''e''(''G'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 .  \n*If <math>\\scriptstyle G=\\langle H, t| t^{-1}C_1t=C_2\\rangle</math> is an [[HNN-extension]] where ''C''<sub>1</sub>, ''C''<sub>2</sub> are isomorphic finite [[subgroup]]s of ''H'' then ''G'' is a [[finitely generated group]] and ''e''(''G'') > 1.\n\nStallings' theorem shows that the converse is also true.\n\n==Formal statement of Stallings' theorem==\nLet ''G'' be a [[finitely generated group]].\n\nThen ''e''(''G'') > 1 if and only if one of the following holds:\n*The group ''G'' admits a splitting ''G''=''H''∗<sub>''C''</sub>''K'' as a [[free product with amalgamation]] where ''C'' is a finite group such that ''C'' ≠ ''H'' and ''C'' ≠ ''K''.\n*The group ''G'' is an [[HNN-extension]] <math>\\scriptstyle G=\\langle H, t| t^{-1}C_1t=C_2\\rangle</math> where and ''C''<sub>1</sub>, ''C''<sub>2</sub> are isomorphic finite [[subgroup]]s of ''H''.\n\nIn the language of [[Bass-Serre theory]] this result can be restated as follows:\nFor a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' we have  ''e''(''G'') > 1 if and only if ''G'' admits a nontrivial (that is, without a global fixed vertex) [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on a simplicial [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions.\n\nFor the case where ''G'' is a torsion-free [[finitely generated group]], Stallings' theorem implies that ''e''(''G'') = ∞ if and only if ''G'' admits a proper [[free product]] decomposition ''G'' = ''A''∗''B'' with both ''A'' and ''B'' nontrivial.\n\n==Applications and generalizations==\n*Among the immediate applications of Stallings' theorem was a proof by Stallings<ref>John R. Stallings.

For this reason Stallings' theorem is considered to be one of the first results in [[geometric group theory]]. \n*Stallings' theorem was a starting point for Dunwoody's ''accessibility theory''. A finitely generated group ''G'' is said to be ''accessible'' if the process of iterated nontrivial splitting of ''G'' over finite subgroups always terminates in a finite number of steps. In [[Bass-Serre theory]] terms that the number of edges in a reduced splitting of ''G'' as the fundamental group of a [[graph of groups]] with finite edge groups is bounded by some constant depending on ''G''.

The two-step [[subgroup]] test is a similar theorem which requires the subset to be closed under the operation and taking of inverses.\n\n==One-step subgroup test==\n\nLet <math>G\n</math> be a group and let <math>H</math> be a nonempty subset of <math>G</math>.

To prove that H is a subgroup of G we must show that H is associative, has an identity, has an inverse for every element and is closed under the operation. So,\n\n* Since the operation of H is the same as the operation of G, the operation is associative since G is a group.\n* Since H is not empty there exists an element x in H. If we take a = x and b = x, then ab<sup>−1</sup> = xx<sup>−1</sup> = e, where e is the identity element. Therefore e is in H.\n* Let x be an element in H and we have just shown the identity element, e, is in H. Then let a = e and b = x, it follows that ab<sup>−1</sup> = ex<sup>−1</sup> = x<sup>−1</sup> in H. So the inverse of an element in H is in H.\n* Finally, let x and y be elements in H, then since y is in H it follows that y<sup>−1</sup> is in H. Hence x(y<sup>−1</sup>)<sup>−1</sup> = xy is in H and so H is closed under the operation.\n\nThus H is a subgroup of G.\n\n==Two-step subgroup test==\n\nA corollary of this theorem is the two-step subgroup test which states that a nonempty subset of a group is itself a group if the subset is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the operation as well as under the taking of inverses.\n\n[[Category:Theorems in group theory]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]"

If ''T'' is a [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow 2-subgroup]] of ''G'' containing an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] not [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] in ''G'' to any other element of ''T'', then the involution lies in ''Z*''(''G''), which is the inverse image in ''G'' of the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''/''O''(''G'').</blockquote>\n\nThis generalizes the [[Brauer–Suzuki theorem]] (and the proof uses the Brauer-Suzuki theorem to deal with some small cases).\n\n==Details==\nThe original paper {{harv|Glauberman|1966}} gave several criteria for an element to lie outside ''Z*''(''G'').  Its theorem 4 states:\n\n<blockquote>For an element ''t'' in ''T'', it is necessary and sufficient for ''t'' to lie outside ''Z*''(''G'') that there is some ''g'' in ''G'' and [[abelian group|abelian subgroup]] ''U'' of ''T'' satisfying the following properties:\n# ''g'' normalizes both ''U'' and the [[centralizer]] ''C<sub>T</sub>''(''U''), that is ''g'' is contained in ''N'' = ''N<sub>G</sub>''(''U'') ∩ ''N<sub>G</sub>''(''C<sub>T</sub>''(''U''))\n# ''t'' is contained in ''U'' and ''tg'' ≠ ''gt''\n# ''U'' is generated by the ''N''-conjugates of ''t''\n# the [[exponent (group theory)|exponent]] of ''U'' is equal to the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''t''\nMoreover ''g'' may be chosen to have prime power order if ''t'' is in the center of ''T'', and ''g'' may be chosen in ''T'' otherwise.</blockquote>\n\nA simple corollary is that an element ''t'' in ''T'' is not in ''Z*''(''G'') if and only if there is some ''s'' ≠ ''t'' such that ''s'' and ''t'' commute and ''s'' and ''t'' are ''G'' conjugate.\n\nA generalization to odd primes was recorded in {{harv|Guralnick|Robinson|1993}}: if ''t'' is an element of prime order ''p'' and the [[commutator]] [''t'', ''g''] has order coprime to ''p'' for all ''g'', then ''t'' is central modulo the [[p-core|''p''′-core]].

Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of [[Richard Dedekind]] and previous papers by Noether.\n\nThree years later, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. van der Waerden]] published his influential ''Algebra,'' the first [[abstract algebra]] textbook that took the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]-[[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]-[[Field (mathematics)|fields]] approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on [[group theory]] and [[Emil Artin]] on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], [[Otto Schreier]], and van der Waerden himself on [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] as the main references.

Scott: ''Group Theory'', Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 33</ref>\n\n=== Discussion ===\n{| align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ '''First isomorphism theorem'''\n|- style=\"padding:1em\"\n| [[Image:First-isomorphism-theorem.svg]]\n|}\nThe first isomorphism theorem can be expressed in [[category theory|category theoretical]] language by saying that the [[category of groups]] is (normal epi, mono)-factorizable; in other words, the [[normal morphism|normal epimorphisms]] and the [[monomorphism]]s form a [[factorization system]] for the category.  This is captured in the [[commutative diagram]] in the margin, which shows the objects and morphisms whose existence can be deduced from the morphism <math> f : G \\rightarrow H</math>.  The diagram shows that every morphism in the category of groups has a [[Kernel (category theory)|kernel]] in the category theoretical sense; the arbitrary morphism ''f'' factors into <math>\\iota \\circ \\pi</math>, where ''ι'' is a monomorphism and ''π'' is an epimorphism (in a conormal category, all epimorphisms are normal).  This is represented in the diagram by an object <math>\\ker f</math> and a monomorphism <math>\\kappa: \\ker f \\rightarrow G</math> (kernels are always monomorphisms), which complete the short [[exact sequence]] running from the lower left to the upper right of the diagram.  The use of the exact sequence convention saves us from having to draw the [[zero morphism]]s from <math>\\ker f</math> to <math>H</math> and <math>G / \\ker f</math>.\n\nIf the sequence is right split (i. e., there is a morphism ''σ'' that maps <math>G / \\ker f</math> to a {{pi}}-preimage of itself), then ''G'' is the [[semidirect product]] of the normal subgroup <math>\\operatorname{im} \\kappa</math> and the subgroup <math>\\operatorname{im} \\sigma</math>.  If it is left split (i. e., there exists some <math>\\rho: G \\rightarrow \\ker f</math> such that <math>\\rho \\circ \\kappa = \\operatorname{id}_{\\ker f}</math>), then it must also be right split, and <math>\\operatorname{im} \\kappa \\times \\operatorname{im} \\sigma</math> is a [[direct product]] decomposition of ''G''.  In general, the existence of a right split does not imply the existence of a left split; but in an [[abelian category]] (such as the abelian groups), left splits and right splits are equivalent by the [[splitting lemma]], and a right split is sufficient to produce a [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] decomposition <math>\\operatorname{im} \\kappa \\oplus \\operatorname{im} \\sigma</math>.  In an abelian category, all monomorphisms are also normal, and the diagram may be extended by a second short exact sequence <math>0 \\rightarrow G / \\ker f \\rightarrow H \\rightarrow \\operatorname{coker} f \\rightarrow 0</math>.\n\nIn the second isomorphism theorem, the product ''SN'' is the [[join (mathematics)|join]] of ''S'' and ''N'' in the [[lattice of subgroups]] of ''G'', while the intersection ''S''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''N'' is the [[meet (mathematics)|meet]].\n\nThe third isomorphism theorem is generalized by the [[nine lemma]] to [[abelian categories]] and more general maps between objects.\n\n== Rings ==\nThe statements of the theorems for [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] are similar, with the notion of a normal subgroup replaced by the notion of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].\n\n===First isomorphism theorem===\nLet ''R'' and ''S'' be rings, and let ''φ'':&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''S'' be a [[ring homomorphism]].  Then:\n# The [[Kernel (algebra)#Ring homomorphisms|kernel]] of ''φ'' is an ideal of ''R'',\n# The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''φ'' is a [[subring]] of ''S'', and\n# The image of ''φ'' is isomorphic to the [[quotient ring]] ''R''&nbsp;/&nbsp;ker(''φ'').\nIn particular, if ''φ'' is [[surjective function|surjective]] then ''S'' is isomorphic to ''R''&nbsp;/&nbsp;ker(''φ'').\n\n===Second isomorphism theorem===\nLet ''R'' be a ring.  Let ''S'' be a subring of ''R'', and let ''I'' be an ideal of ''R''.  Then:\n# The sum ''S''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''I''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''s''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''S'',&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''I''} is a subring of ''R'',\n# The intersection ''S''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''I'' is an ideal of ''S'', and\n# The quotient rings (''S''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''I'')&nbsp;/&nbsp;''I'' and ''S''&nbsp;/&nbsp;(''S''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''I'') are isomorphic.\n\n===Third isomorphism theorem===\nLet ''R'' be a ring, and ''I'' an ideal of ''R''.\nThen\n# If <math>A</math> is a subring of <math>R</math> such that <math>I \\subseteq A \\subseteq R</math>, then <math>A/I</math> is a subring of <math>R/I</math>.\n# Every subring of <math>R/I</math> is of the form <math>A/I</math>, for some subring <math>A</math> of <math>R</math> such that <math>I \\subseteq A \\subseteq R</math>.\n# If <math>J</math> is an ideal of <math>R</math> such that <math>I \\subseteq J \\subseteq R</math>, then <math>J/I</math> is an ideal of <math>R/I</math>.\n# Every ideal of <math>R/I</math> is of the form <math>J/I</math>, for some ideal <math>J</math> of <math>R</math> such that <math>I \\subseteq J \\subseteq R</math>.\n# If <math>J</math> is an ideal of <math>R</math> such that <math>I \\subseteq J \\subseteq R</math>, then the quotient ring <math>(R/I)/(J/I)</math> is isomorphic to <math>R/J</math>.\n\n== Modules ==\nThe statements of the isomorphism theorems for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] are particularly simple, since it is possible to form a [[quotient module]] from any [[submodule]].  The isomorphism theorems for [[vector space]]s (modules over a field) and [[abelian group]]s (modules over <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>) are special cases of these.  For finite-dimensional vector spaces, all of these theorems follow from the [[rank–nullity theorem]].\n\nIn the following, \"module\" will mean \"''R''-module\" for some fixed ring ''R''.\n\n===First isomorphism theorem===\nLet ''M'' and ''N'' be modules, and let ''φ'':&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''N'' be a [[module homomorphism]].  Then:\n# The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''φ'' is a submodule of ''M'',\n# The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''φ'' is a submodule of ''N'', and\n# The image of ''φ'' is isomorphic to the [[quotient module]] ''M''&nbsp;/&nbsp;ker(''φ'').\nIn particular, if ''φ'' is surjective then ''N'' is isomorphic to ''M''&nbsp;/&nbsp;ker(''φ'').\n\n===Second isomorphism theorem===\nLet ''M'' be a module, and let ''S'' and ''T'' be submodules of ''M''.  Then:\n# The sum ''S''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''s''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''S'',&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''T''} is a submodule of ''M'',\n# The intersection ''S''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''T'' is a submodule of ''M'', and\n# The quotient modules (''S''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''T'')&nbsp;/&nbsp;''T'' and ''S''&nbsp;/&nbsp;(''S''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''T'') are isomorphic.\n\n===Third isomorphism theorem===\nLet ''M'' be a module, ''T'' a submodule of ''M''.\n\n# If <math>S</math> is a submodule of <math>M</math> such that <math>T \\subseteq S \\subseteq M</math>, then <math>S/T</math> is a submodule of <math>M/T</math>.\n# Every submodule of <math>M/T</math> is of the form <math>S/T</math>, for some submodule <math>S</math> of <math>M</math> such that <math>T \\subseteq S \\subseteq M</math>.\n# If <math>S</math> is a submodule of <math>M</math> such that <math>T \\subseteq S \\subseteq M</math>, then the quotient module <math>(M/T)/(S/T)</math> is isomorphic to <math>M/S</math>.\n<!-- We also need to mention the isomorphism theorems for topological vector spaces, Banach algebras etc. -->\n\n== General ==\nTo generalise this to [[universal algebra]], normal subgroups need to be replaced by [[congruence relation]]s.\n \nA '''congruence''' on an [[universal algebra|algebra]] <math>A</math> is an equivalence relation <math>\\Phi\\subset A \\times A</math> which forms a subalgebra of <math>A \\times A</math> considered as an algebra with componentwise operations.  One can make the set of equivalence classes <math>A/\\Phi</math> into an algebra of the same type by defining the operations via representatives; this will be well-defined since <math>\\Phi</math> is a subalgebra of <math>A \\times A</math>. The resulting structure is the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]].\n\n=== First isomorphism theorem ===\nLet <math>f:A \\rightarrow B</math> be an algebra [[homomorphism]].  Then the image of <math> f </math> is a subalgebra of <math>B</math>, the relation given by <math>\\Phi:f(x)=f(y)</math> (i.e. the [[Kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of ''f'') is a congruence on <math>A</math>, and the algebras <math> \\ A/\\Phi \\ </math> and <math>\\operatorname{im} f</math> are isomorphic. (Note that in the case of a group, ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f''(''y'') iff ''f''(''xy''<sup>−1</sup>) = 1, so one recovers the notion of kernel used in group theory in this case.)\n\n=== Second isomorphism theorem ===\nGiven an algebra <math>A</math>, a subalgebra <math>B</math> of <math>A</math>, and a congruence <math>\\Phi</math> on <math>A</math>, let <math>\\Phi_B = \\Phi \\cap (B \\times B)</math> be the trace of <math>\\Phi</math> in <math>B</math> and <math>[B]^\\Phi=\\{K \\in A/\\Phi: K \\cap B \\neq\\emptyset\\}</math> the collection of equivalence classes that intersect <math>B</math>.\n\nThen  (i) <math>\\Phi_B</math> is a congruence on <math>B</math>, (ii) <math> \\ [B]^\\Phi</math> is a subalgebra of <math>A/\\Phi</math>, and (iii) the algebra <math>[B]^\\Phi</math> is isomorphic to the algebra <math>B/\\Phi_B</math>.\n\n=== Third isomorphism theorem ===\nLet <math>A</math> be an algebra and <math>\\Phi, \\Psi</math> two congruence relations on <math>A</math> such that <math>\\Psi \\subseteq \\Phi</math>. Then <math>\\Phi/\\Psi= \\{ ([a']_\\Psi,[a'']_\\Psi): (a',a'')\\in \\Phi\\} = [\\ ]_\\Psi \\circ \\Phi \\circ [\\ ]_\\Psi^{-1}</math> is a congruence on <math>A/\\Psi</math>, and <math>A/\\Phi</math> is isomorphic to <math>(A/\\Psi)/(\\Phi/\\Psi)</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Butterfly lemma]], sometimes called the fourth isomorphism theorem\n* [[Correspondence theorem (group theory)|Correspondence theorem]], also sometimes called the fourth isomorphism theorem\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* [[Emmy Noether]], ''Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern'', [[Mathematische Annalen]] '''96'''  (1927) pp.&nbsp;26–61\n* Colin McLarty, 'Emmy Noether’s ‘Set Theoretic’ Topology: From Dedekind to the rise of functors' in ''The Architecture of Modern Mathematics: Essays in history and philosophy'' (edited by [[Jeremy Gray]] and José Ferreirós), Oxford University Press (2006) pp.&nbsp;211–35.\n* {{Citation| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| date=2009| title=Basic algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 2 | series= | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47187-7}}\n* Paul M.

      "text": "{{Redirect|Coker (mathematics)|other uses|Coker (disambiguation)}}\n{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''cokernel''' of a [[linear mapping]] of [[vector spaces]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] {{nowrap|''Y'' / im(''f'')}} of the [[codomain]] of ''f'' by the image of ''f''. The dimension of the cokernel is called the ''corank'' of ''f''.\n\nCokernels are [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to the [[kernel (category theory)|kernels of category theory]], hence the name: the kernel is a [[subobject]] of the domain (it maps to the domain), while the cokernel is a [[quotient object]] of the codomain (it maps from the codomain).\n\nIntuitively, given an equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y'' that one is seeking to solve,\nthe cokernel measures the ''constraints'' that ''y'' must satisfy for this equation to have a solution – the obstructions to a solution – while the kernel measures the ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if one exists. This is elaborated in [[#Intuition|intuition]], below.\n\nMore generally, the cokernel of a [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in some [[category theory|category]] (e.g. a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] between [[group (mathematics)|group]]s or a [[bounded linear operator]] between [[Hilbert space]]s) is an object ''Q'' and a morphism ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' such that the composition ''q f'' is the [[zero morphism]] of the category, and furthermore ''q'' is [[universal mapping property|universal]] with respect to this property. Often the map ''q'' is understood, and ''Q'' itself is called the cokernel of ''f''.\n\nIn many situations in [[abstract algebra]], such as for [[abelian group]]s, [[vector space]]s or [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, the cokernel of the [[homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the [[quotient set|quotient]] of ''Y'' by the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f''. In [[topology|topological]] settings, such as with bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces, one typically has to take the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the image before passing to the quotient.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nOne can define the cokernel in the general framework of [[category theory]]. In order for the definition to make sense the category in question must have [[zero morphism]]s. The '''cokernel''' of a [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is defined as the [[coequalizer]] of ''f'' and the zero morphism 0<sub>''XY''</sub> : ''X'' → ''Y''.\n\nExplicitly, this means the following. The cokernel of ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is an object ''Q'' together with a morphism ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' such that the diagram\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Image:Cokernel-01.svg]]</div>\n\n[[commutative diagram|commutes]]. Moreover, the morphism ''q'' must be [[universal property|universal]] for this diagram, i.e. any other such ''q''&prime;: ''Y'' → ''Q''&prime; can be obtained by composing ''q'' with a unique morphism ''u'' : ''Q'' → ''Q''&prime;:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Image:Cokernel-02.svg]]</div>\n\nAs with all universal constructions the cokernel, if it exists, is unique [[up to]] a unique [[isomorphism]], or more precisely: if ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' and ''q‘'' : ''Y'' → ''Q‘'' are two cokernels of ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', then there exists a unique isomorphism ''u'' : ''Q'' → ''Q‘'' with ''q‘'' = ''u'' ''q''.\n\nLike all coequalizers, the cokernel ''q'' : ''Y'' → ''Q'' is necessarily an [[epimorphism]]. Conversely an epimorphism is called ''[[normal morphism|normal]]'' (or ''conormal'') if it is the cokernel of some morphism. A category is called ''conormal'' if every epimorphism is normal (e.g. the [[category of groups]] is conormal).\n\n=== Examples ===\nIn the [[category of groups]], the cokernel of a [[group homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''G'' → ''H'' is the [[quotient group|quotient]] of ''H'' by the [[Normal closure (group theory)|normal closure]] of the image of ''f''. In the case of [[abelian group]]s, since every [[subgroup]] is normal, the cokernel is just ''H'' [[Ideal (ring theory)|modulo]] the image of ''f'':\n:<math>\\operatorname{coker}(f) =  H / \\operatorname{im}(f).</math>\n\n=== Special cases ===\nIn a [[preadditive category]], it makes sense to add and subtract morphisms. In such a category, the [[coequalizer]] of two morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' (if it exists) is just the cokernel of their difference:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{coeq}(f, g) = \\operatorname{coker}(g - f).</math>\n\nIn an [[abelian category]] (a special kind of preadditive category) the [[image (category theory)|image]] and [[coimage]] of a morphism ''f'' are given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\operatorname{im}(f) &= \\ker(\\operatorname{coker} f), \\\\\n  \\operatorname{coim}(f) &= \\operatorname{coker}(\\ker f).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn particular, every abelian category is normal (and conormal as well). That is, every [[monomorphism]] ''m'' can be written as the kernel of some morphism. Specifically, ''m'' is the kernel of its own cokernel:\n:<math>m = \\ker(\\operatorname{coker}(m))</math>\n\n==Intuition==\nThe cokernel can be thought of as the space of ''constraints'' that an equation must satisfy, as the space of ''obstructions,'' just as the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the space of ''solutions.''\n\nFormally, one may connect the kernel and the cokernel of a map  ''T'':  ''V'' →  ''W'' by the [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0 \\to \\ker T \\to V \\overset T \\longrightarrow W \\to \\operatorname{coker} T \\to 0.</math>\n\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation {{math|1=''T''(''v'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''w''}} to solve,\n* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation {{math|1=''T''(''v'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}}, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;\n* the cokernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.\n\nThe dimension of the cokernel plus the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space, as the dimension of the quotient space {{tmath|W/T(V)}} is simply the dimension of the space ''minus'' the dimension of the image.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the map ''T'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> → '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, given by ''T''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''T''(''x'', ''y'') =(''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a = 0'' (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b''), or equivalently, {{math|1=(0, ''b'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''x'', 0)}}, (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) ⊆ ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution. The cokernel may be expressed via the real valued map ''W'': (''a'', ''b'') → (''a''): given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.\n\nAdditionally, the cokernel can be thought of as something that \"detects\" surjections in the same way that the kernel \"detects\" injections. A map is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial, and a map is surjective if and only if its cokernel is trivial, or in other words, if {{math|1=''W''&nbsp;=&nbsp;im(''T'')}}.\n\n== References ==\n*[[Saunders Mac Lane]]: [[Categories for the Working Mathematician]], Second Edition, 1998, p.&nbsp;64\n\n{{Category theory}}\n\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]\n[[Category:Category theory]]\n[[Category:Isomorphism theorems]]\n\n[[de:Kern (Algebra)#Kokern]]"

The '''inverse image''' or '''preimage''' of a particular subset ''S'' of the [[codomain]] of a function is the set of all elements of the domain that map to the members of ''S''.\n\nImage and inverse image may also be defined for general [[binary relation#Operations on binary relations|binary relations]], not just functions.\n\n==Definition==\nThe word \"image\" is used in three related ways. In these definitions, ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to the set ''Y''.\n\n===Image of an element===\nIf ''x'' is a member of ''X'', then ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' (the [[value (mathematics)|value]] of ''f'' when applied to ''x'') is the image of ''x'' under ''f''.

This convention is a common one; the intended meaning must be inferred from the context.  This makes ''f''[.] a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[power set]] of ''X'' (the set of all [[subset]]s of ''X''), and whose [[codomain]] is the power set of ''Y''. See [[#Notation|Notation]] below.\n\n===Image of a function===\nThe image ''f''<nowiki>[</nowiki>''X''<nowiki>]</nowiki> of the entire [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' of ''f'' is called simply the image of ''f''.\n\n===Generalization to binary relations===\nIf ''R'' is an arbitrary [[binary relation]] on ''X''[[cartesian product|×]]''Y'', the set { y∈''Y'' | ''xRy'' for some ''x''∈''X'' } is called the image, or the range, of ''R''.

The notation ''f''<sup>&nbsp;−1</sup> should not be confused with that for [[inverse function]]. The notation coincides with the usual one, though, for bijections, in the sense that the inverse image of ''B'' under ''f'' is the image of ''B'' under ''f''<sup>&nbsp;−1</sup>.\n\n==<span id=\"Notation\">Notation</span> for image and inverse image==\nThe traditional notations used in the previous section can be confusing.

Algebraic structures include [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The term ''abstract algebra'' was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra.\n\nAlgebraic structures, with their associated [[homomorphism]]s, form [[category (mathematics)|mathematical categories]]. [[Category theory]] is a formalism that allows a unified  way for expressing properties and constructions that are similar for various structures.\n\n[[Universal algebra]] is a related subject that studies types of algebraic structures as single objects. For example, the structure of groups is a single object in universal algebra, which is called ''variety of groups''.\n\n==History==\nAs in other parts of mathematics, concrete problems and examples have played important roles in the development of abstract algebra. Through the end of the nineteenth century, many{{snd}}perhaps most{{snd}}of these problems were in some way related to the theory of algebraic equations. Major themes include:\n* Solving of systems of linear equations, which led to [[linear algebra]]\n* Attempts to find formulas for solutions of general [[polynomial]] equations of higher degree that resulted in discovery of [[Galois group|groups]] as abstract manifestations of [[symmetry]]\n* Arithmetical investigations of quadratic and higher degree forms and [[diophantine equation]]s, that directly produced the notions of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].\n\nNumerous textbooks in abstract algebra start with axiomatic definitions of various [[algebraic structure]]s and then proceed to establish their properties. This creates a false impression that in algebra axioms had come first and then served as a motivation and as a basis of further study. The true order of historical development was almost exactly the opposite. For example, the [[hypercomplex number]]s of the nineteenth century had kinematic and physical motivations but challenged comprehension. Most theories that are now recognized as parts of algebra started as collections of disparate facts from various branches of mathematics, acquired a common theme that served as a core around which various results were grouped, and finally became unified on a basis of a common set of concepts. An archetypical example of this progressive synthesis can be seen in the [[history of group theory]].\n\n===Early group theory===\nThere were several threads in the early development of group theory, in modern language loosely corresponding to ''number theory'', ''theory of equations'', and ''geometry''.\n\n[[Leonhard Euler]] considered [[algebraic operation]]s on numbers modulo an integer, [[modular arithmetic]], in [[Euler's theorem|his generalization]] of [[Fermat's little theorem]]. These investigations were taken much further by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who considered the structure of multiplicative groups of residues mod n and established many properties of [[cyclic group|cyclic]] and more general [[abelian group|abelian]] groups that arise in this way. In his investigations of [[composition of binary quadratic forms]], Gauss explicitly stated the [[associative property|associative law]] for the composition of forms, but like Euler before him, he seems to have been more interested in concrete results than in general theory. In 1870, [[Leopold Kronecker]] gave a definition of an abelian group in the context of [[ideal class group]]s of a number field, generalizing Gauss's work; but it appears he did not tie his definition with previous work on groups, particularly permutation groups. In 1882, considering the same question, [[Heinrich M. Weber]] realized the connection and gave a similar definition that involved the [[cancellation property]] but omitted the existence of the [[inverse element]], which was sufficient in his context (finite groups).\n\n[[Permutation]]s were studied by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in his 1770 paper ''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations (Thoughts on the algebraic solution of equations)'' devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in which he introduced [[Lagrange resolvents]]. Lagrange's goal was to understand why equations of third and fourth degree admit formulas for solutions, and he identified as key objects permutations of the roots. An important novel step taken by Lagrange in this paper was the abstract view of the roots, i.e. as symbols and not as numbers. However, he did not consider composition of permutations. Serendipitously, the first edition of [[Edward Waring]]'s ''Meditationes Algebraicae'' (''Meditations on Algebra'') appeared in the same year, with an expanded version published in 1782. Waring proved the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]], and specially considered the relation between the roots of a quartic equation and its resolvent cubic. ''Mémoire sur la résolution des équations'' (''Memoire on the Solving of Equations'') of [[Alexandre Vandermonde]] (1771) developed the theory of symmetric functions from a slightly different angle, but like Lagrange, with the goal of understanding solvability of algebraic equations.\n\n{{quote|Kronecker claimed in 1888 that the study of modern algebra began with this first paper of Vandermonde. Cauchy states quite clearly that Vandermonde had priority over Lagrange for this remarkable idea, which eventually led to the study of group theory.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Vandermonde|title=Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Paolo Ruffini]] was the first person to develop the theory of [[permutation group]]s, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations. His goal was to establish the impossibility of an algebraic solution to a general algebraic equation of degree greater than four. En route to this goal he introduced the notion of the order of an element of a group, conjugacy, the cycle decomposition of elements of permutation groups and the notions of primitive and imprimitive and proved some important theorems relating these concepts, such as\n{{quote|if G is a subgroup of S<sub>5</sub> whose order is divisible by 5 then G contains an element of order 5.}}\nNote, however, that he got by without formalizing the concept of a group, or even of a permutation group.\nThe next step was taken by [[Évariste Galois]] in 1832, although his work remained unpublished until 1846, when he considered for the first time what is now called the ''closure property'' of a group of permutations, which he expressed as\n{{quote|if in such a group one has the substitutions S and T then one has the substitution ST.}}\n\nThe theory of permutation groups received further far-reaching development in the hands of [[Augustin Cauchy]] and [[Camille Jordan]], both through introduction of new concepts and, primarily, a great wealth of results about special classes of permutation groups and even some general theorems. Among other things, Jordan defined a notion of [[isomorphism]], still in the context of permutation groups and, incidentally, it was he who put the term ''group'' in wide use.\n\nThe abstract notion of a group appeared for the first time in [[Arthur Cayley]]'s papers in 1854. Cayley realized that a group need not be a permutation group (or even ''finite''), and may instead consist of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], whose algebraic properties, such as multiplication and inverses, he systematically investigated in succeeding years. Much later Cayley would revisit the question whether abstract groups were more general than permutation groups, and establish that, in fact, any group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.\n\n===Modern algebra===\nThe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century saw a tremendous shift in the methodology of mathematics. Abstract algebra emerged around the start of the 20th century, under the name ''modern algebra''. Its study was part of the drive for  more [[intellectual rigor]] in mathematics. Initially, the assumptions in classical [[algebra]], on which the whole of mathematics (and major parts of the [[natural sciences]]) depend, took the form of [[axiomatic system]]s. No longer satisfied with establishing properties of concrete objects, mathematicians started to turn their attention to general theory. Formal definitions of certain [[algebraic structure]]s began to emerge in the 19th century. For example, results about various groups of permutations came to be seen as instances of general theorems that concern a general notion of an ''abstract group''. Questions of structure and classification of various mathematical objects came to forefront.\n\nThese processes were occurring throughout all of mathematics, but became especially pronounced in algebra. Formal definition through primitive operations and axioms were proposed for many basic algebraic structures, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Hence such things as [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]] took their places in [[pure mathematics]]. The algebraic investigations of general fields by [[Ernst Steinitz]] and of commutative and then general rings by [[David Hilbert]], [[Emil Artin]] and [[Emmy Noether]], building up on the work of [[Ernst Kummer]], [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Richard Dedekind]], who had considered ideals in commutative rings, and of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Issai Schur]], concerning [[representation theory]] of groups, came to define abstract algebra. These developments of the last quarter of the 19th century and the first quarter of 20th century were systematically exposed in [[Bartel van der Waerden]]'s ''Moderne algebra'', the two-volume [[monograph]] published in 1930–1931 that forever changed for the mathematical world the meaning of the word ''algebra'' from ''the theory of equations'' to the ''theory of algebraic structures''.\n\n==Basic concepts==\n{{Main|Algebraic structure}}\n\nBy abstracting away various amounts of detail, mathematicians have defined various algebraic structures that are used in many areas of mathematics. For instance, almost all systems studied are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], to which the theorems of [[set theory]] apply. Those sets that have a certain binary operation defined on them form [[Magma (algebra)|magmas]], to which the concepts concerning magmas, as well those concerning sets, apply. We can add additional constraints on the  algebraic structure, such as associativity (to form [[semigroup]]s); identity, and inverses (to form [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]); and other more complex structures. With additional structure, more theorems could be proved, but the generality is reduced. The \"hierarchy\" of algebraic objects (in terms of generality) creates a hierarchy of the corresponding theories: for instance, the theorems of [[group theory]] may be used when studying [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] (algebraic objects that have two binary operations with certain axioms) since a ring is a group over one of its operations. In general there is a balance between the amount of generality and the richness of the theory: more general structures have usually fewer [[nontrivial]] theorems and fewer applications.\n\nExamples of algebraic structures with a single [[binary operation]] are:\n* [[Magma (algebra)|Magma]]\n* [[Quasigroup]]\n* [[Monoid]]\n* [[Semigroup]]\n* [[Group (mathematics)|Group]]\n\nExamples involving several operations include:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]\n* [[Field (mathematics)|Field]]\n* [[Module (mathematics)|Module]]\n* [[Vector space]]\n* [[Algebra over a field]]\n* [[Associative algebra]]\n* [[Lie algebra]]\n* [[Lattice (order)|Lattice]]\n* [[Boolean algebra]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Applications==\n\nBecause of its generality, abstract algebra is used in many fields of mathematics and science. For instance, [[algebraic topology]] uses algebraic objects to study topologies. The [[Poincaré conjecture]], proved in 2003, asserts that the [[fundamental group]] of a manifold, which encodes information about connectedness, can be used to determine whether a manifold is a sphere or not. [[Algebraic number theory]] studies various number [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] that generalize the set of integers. Using tools of algebraic number theory, [[Andrew Wiles]] proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\nIn physics, groups are used to represent symmetry operations, and the usage of group theory could simplify differential equations. In [[gauge theory]], the requirement of [[local symmetry]] can be used to deduce the equations describing a system. The groups that describe those symmetries are [[Lie group]]s, and the study of Lie groups and Lie algebras reveals much about the physical system; for instance, the number of [[force carrier]]s in a theory is equal to the dimension of the Lie algebra, and these [[boson]]s interact with the force they mediate if the Lie algebra is nonabelian.<ref>{{Citation|last=Schumm|first=Bruce|title=Deep Down Things|year=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7971-X}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Algebra|Mathematics}}\n{{Main|List of abstract algebra topics}}\n\n* [[Coding theory]]\n* [[Group theory]]\n* [[List of publications in abstract algebra]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation | last1=Allenby | first1=R.

The phrase '''abstract algebra''' was coined at the turn of the 20th century to distinguish this area from what was normally referred to as '''algebra''', the study of the rules for manipulating formulae and algebraic expressions involving unknowns and [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex number]]s, often now called ''[[elementary algebra]]''.

      "text": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:A<sub>∞</sub>-operad}}\nIn the theory of [[operads]] in [[algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]], an '''A<sub>∞</sub>-operad''' is a parameter space for a multiplication map that is [[homotopy|homotopy coherently]] [[associative]]. (An operad that describes a multiplication that is both homotopy coherently associative and homotopy coherently commutative is called an [[E-infinity operad|E<sub>∞</sub>-operad]].)\n\n== Definition ==\nIn the (usual) setting of operads with an action of the symmetric group on topological spaces, an operad ''A'' is said to be an ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operad if all of its spaces ''A''(''n'') are Σ<sub>''n''</sub>-[[equivariant]]ly [[homotopy equivalent]] to the discrete spaces Σ<sub>''n''</sub> (the [[symmetric group]]) with its multiplication action (where ''n'' ∈ '''N'''). In the setting of non-Σ operads (also termed nonsymmetric operads, operads without permutation), an operad ''A'' is ''A''<sub>∞</sub>if all of its spaces ''A''(''n'') are contractible.  In other [[Category (mathematics)|categories]] than topological spaces, the notions of ''homotopy'' and ''contractibility'' have to be replaced by suitable analogs, such as [[quasi-isomorphism|homology equivalences]] in the category of [[chain complexes]].\n\n== ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>-operads ==\nThe letter ''A'' in the terminology stands for \"associative\", and the infinity symbols says that associativity is required up to \"all\" higher homotopies. More generally, there is a weaker notion of '''''A''<sub>''n''</sub>-operad''' (''n''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;'''N'''), parametrizing multiplications that are associative only up to a certain level of homotopies. In particular,\n\n* ''A''<sub>1</sub>-spaces are pointed spaces;\n* ''A''<sub>2</sub>-spaces are [[H-space]]s with no associativity conditions; and\n* ''A''<sub>3</sub>-spaces are homotopy associative H-spaces.\n\n== ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operads and single loop spaces ==\nA space ''X'' is the [[loop space]] of some other space, denoted by ''BX'', if and only if ''X'' is an algebra over an ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operad and the monoid ''&pi;''<sub>0</sub>(''X'') of its connected components is a group. An algebra over an A<sub>∞</sub>-operad is referred to as an '''''A''<sub>∞</sub>-space'''. There are three consequences of this characterization of loop spaces. First, a loop space is an ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-space. Second, a connected ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-space ''X'' is a loop space. Third, the [[group completion]] of a possibly disconnected ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-space is a loop space.\n\nThe importance of ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operads in [[homotopy theory]] stems from this relationship between algebras over ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operads and loop spaces.\n\n== ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-algebras==\nAn algebra over the ''A''<sub>∞</sub> operad is called an ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-algebra. Examples feature the [[Fukaya category]] of a symplectic manifold, when it can be defined (see also [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]).\n\n== Examples ==\nThe most obvious, if not particularly useful, example of an ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operad is the ''associative operad'' ''a'' given by ''a''(''n'') = Σ<sub>''n''</sub>. This operad describes strictly associative multiplications. By definition, any other ''A''<sub>∞</sub>-operad has a map to ''a'' which is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nA geometric example of an A<sub>∞</sub>-operad is given by the Stasheff polytopes or [[associahedron|associahedra]].\n\nA less combinatorial example is the '''operad of little intervals''': The space ''A''(''n'') consists of all embeddings of ''n'' disjoint [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] into the unit interval.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[operad]]\n* [[E-infinity operad]]\n* [[loop space]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{ cite journal\n   | last = Stasheff\n   | first = Jim | authorlink = Jim Stasheff\n   | title = What Is...an Operad?\n   | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]\n   |date=June–July 2004\n   | volume = 51\n   | issue = 6\n   |pages=630–631\n   | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200406/what-is.pdf\n   | format = [[PDF]]\n   | accessdate = 2008-01-17 }}\n*{{cite book\n | author = J.

Raising an absolute value to a power less than 1 results in another absolute value, but raising to a power greater than 1 does not necessarily result in an absolute value. (For instance, squaring the usual absolute value on the real numbers yields a function which is not an absolute value because it would violate the rule |''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''|&nbsp;≤&nbsp;|''x''|&nbsp;+&nbsp;|''y''|.) Absolute values up to equivalence, or in other words, an equivalence class of absolute values, is called a '''[[prime place|place]]'''.\n\n[[Ostrowski's theorem]] states that the nontrivial places of the [[rational numbers]] '''Q''' are the ordinary [[absolute value]] and the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic absolute value]] for each prime ''p''.<ref>Cassels (1986) p.16</ref>  For a given prime ''p'', any rational number ''q'' can be written as ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>(''a''/''b''), where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers not divisible by ''p'' and ''n'' is an integer. The ''p''-adic absolute value of ''q'' is\n\n:<math>\\left|p^n \\frac{a}{b}\\right|_p = p^{-n}.</math>\n\nSince the ordinary absolute value and the ''p''-adic absolute values are absolute values according to the definition above, these define places.\n\n== Valuations ==\n{{main|Valuation (algebra)}}\nIf for some ultrametric absolute value and any base ''b''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1, we define ''ν''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;−log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;|''x''| for ''x''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 and ''ν''(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;∞, where ∞ is ordered to be greater than all real numbers, then we obtain a function from ''D'' to '''R'''&nbsp;∪&nbsp;{∞}, with the following properties:\n\n* ''ν''(''x'') = ∞ ⇒ ''x'' = 0,\n* ''ν''(''xy'') = ''ν''(''x'') + ''ν''(''y''),\n* ''ν''(''x'' + ''y'') ≥ min(ν(''x''), ''ν''(''y'')).\n\nSuch a function is known as a ''[[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]'' in the terminology of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], but other authors use the term ''valuation'' for ''absolute value'' and then say ''exponential valuation'' instead of ''valuation''.\n\n== Completions ==\nGiven an integral domain ''D'' with an absolute value, we can define the [[Cauchy sequence]]s of elements of ''D'' with respect to the absolute value by requiring that for every ''r'' > 0 there is a positive integer ''N'' such that for all integers ''m'', ''n'' > ''N'' one has |&thinsp;''x''<sub>''m'' </sub> − ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;| &lt; ''r''. It is not hard to show that Cauchy sequences under pointwise addition and multiplication form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. One can also define null sequences as sequences of elements of ''D'' such that |&thinsp;''a''<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;| converges to zero. Null sequences are a [[prime ideal]] in the ring of Cauchy sequences, and the [[quotient ring]] is therefore an integral domain. The domain ''D'' is [[embedding|embedded]] in this quotient ring, called the [[complete metric space|completion]] of ''D'' with respect to the absolute value |&thinsp;''x''&thinsp;|.\n\nSince fields are integral domains, this is also a construction for the completion of a field with respect to an absolute value. To show that the result is a field, and not just an integral domain, we can either show that null sequences form a [[maximal ideal]], or else construct the inverse directly. The latter can be easily done by taking, for all nonzero elements of the quotient ring, a sequence starting from a point beyond the last zero element of the sequence. Any nonzero element of the quotient ring will differ by a null sequence from such a sequence, and by taking pointwise inversion we can find a representative inverse element.\n\nAnother theorem of [[Alexander Ostrowski]] has it that any field complete with respect to an [[Archimedes|Archimedean]] absolute value is isomorphic to either the real or the complex numbers and the valuation is equivalent to the usual one.<ref>Cassels (1986) p.33</ref>  The '''Gelfand-Tornheim theorem''' states that any field with an Archimedean valuation is isomorphic to a subfield of '''C''', the valuation being equivalent to the usual absolute value on '''C'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/papers/ant/html/node60.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222203131/http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/papers/ant/html/node60.html |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Fields and integral domains ==\nIf ''D'' is an integral domain with absolute value |&thinsp;''x''&thinsp;|, then we may extend the definition of the absolute value to the [[field of fractions]] of ''D'' by setting\n\n:<math>|x/y| = |x|/|y|.\\,</math>\n\nOn the other hand, if ''F'' is a field with ultrametric absolute value |&thinsp;''x''&thinsp;|, then the set of elements of ''F'' such that |&thinsp;''x''&thinsp;| ≤ 1 defines a [[valuation ring]], which is a subring ''D'' of ''F'' such that for every nonzero element ''x'' of ''F'', at least one of ''x'' or ''x''<sup>−1</sup> belongs to ''D''. Since ''F'' is a field, ''D'' has no zero divisors and is an integral domain. It has a unique [[maximal ideal]] consisting of all ''x'' such that |&thinsp;''x''&thinsp;| < 1, and is therefore a [[local ring]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bourbaki | first=Nicolas\n | authorlink = Nicolas Bourbaki\n | title = Commutative Algebra\n | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n | year = 1972}}\n* {{cite book | first=J.W.S. | last=Cassels | authorlink=J.

These proofs are used in the article [[Addition of natural numbers]].\n\n==Definitions==\nThis article will use the [[Peano axioms#Addition|Peano axioms]] for the definitions of addition of the natural numbers, and the [[successor function]] S(a). In particular:\n\n{|\n|-\n| '''A1:''' || ''a'' + 0 = ''a''\n|-\n| '''A2:''' || ''a'' + S(''b'') = S(''a'' + ''b'')\n|}\n\nFor the proof of commutativity, it is useful to define another natural number closely related to the successor function, namely \"1\". We define 1 to be the successor of 0, in other words,\n\n:1 = S(0).\n\nNote that for all natural numbers ''a'',\n\n{|\n|-\n| || S(''a'') \n|-\n| = || S(''a'' + 0) || [by A1]\n|-\n| = || ''a'' + S(0) || [by A2]\n|-\n| = || ''a'' + 1 || [by Def. of 1]\n|}\n\n== Proof of associativity ==\n\nWe prove [[associativity]] by first fixing natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'' and applying [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the natural number ''c''.\n\nFor the base case ''c'' = 0,\n\n: (''a''+''b'')+0 = ''a''+''b'' = ''a''+(''b''+0)\n\nEach equation follows by definition [A1]; the first with ''a'' + ''b'', the second with ''b''.\n\nNow, for the induction. We assume the induction hypothesis, namely we assume that for some natural number ''c'',\n\n: (''a''+''b'')+''c'' = ''a''+(''b''+''c'')\n\nThen it follows,\n\n{|\n|-\n| || (''a'' + ''b'') + ''S''(''c'') \n|-\n|= || ''S''((''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'') || [by A2]\n|-\n| = || ''S''(''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'')) || [by the induction hypothesis] \n|-\n| = || ''a'' + ''S''(''b'' + ''c'') || [by A2]\n|-\n| = || ''a'' + (''b'' + ''S''(''c'')) || [by A2]\n|}\n\nIn other words, the induction hypothesis holds for ''S''(''c''). Therefore, the induction on ''c'' is complete.\n\n== Proof of identity element ==\n\nDefinition [A1] states directly that 0 is a [[mathematical identity|right identity]].\nWe prove that 0 is a [[mathematical identity|left identity]] by induction on the natural number ''a''.\n\nFor the base case ''a'' = 0, 0 + 0 = 0 by definition [A1].\nNow we assume the induction hypothesis, that 0 + ''a'' = ''a''.\nThen\n{|\n|-\n| || 0 + ''S''(''a'')\n|-\n| = || ''S''(0 + ''a'') || [by A2]\n|-\n| = || ''S''(''a'') || [by the induction hypothesis]\n|}\nThis completes the induction on ''a''.\n\n== Proof of commutativity ==\n\nWe prove [[commutativity]] (''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'') by applying induction on the natural number ''b''. First we prove the base cases ''b'' = 0 and ''b'' = ''S''(0) = 1 (i.e. we prove that 0 and 1 commute with everything).\n\nThe base case ''b'' = 0 follows immediately from the identity element property (0 is an [[mathematical identity|additive identity]]), which has been proved above:\n''a'' + 0 = ''a'' = 0 + ''a''.\n\nNext we will prove the base case ''b'' = 1, that 1 commutes with everything, i.e. for all natural numbers ''a'', we have ''a'' + 1 = 1 + ''a''. We will prove this by induction on ''a'' (an induction proof within an induction proof). We have proved that 0 commutes with everything, so in particular, 0 commutes with 1: for ''a'' = 0, we have 0 + 1 = 1 + 0. Now, suppose ''a'' + 1 = 1 + ''a''. Then\n\n{|\n|-\n| || ''S''(''a'') + 1\n|-\n| = || ''S''(''a'') + ''S''(0) || [by Def. of 1]\n|-\n| = || ''S''(''S''(''a'') + 0) || [by A2]\n|-\n| = || ''S''((''a'' + 1) + 0) || [as shown [[#Definitions|above]]]\n|-\n| = || ''S''(''a'' + 1) || [by A1]\n|-\n| = || ''S''(1 + ''a'') || [by the induction hypothesis]\n|-\n| = || 1 + ''S''(''a'') || [by A2]\n|}\n\nThis completes the induction on ''a'', and so we have proved the base case ''b'' = 1.

One of the most familiar additive identities is the [[number]] [[0 (number)|0]] from [[elementary mathematics]], but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].\n\n==Elementary examples==\n* The additive identity familiar from [[elementary mathematics]] is zero, denoted [[0 (number)|0]]. For example,\n*: <math>5 + 0 = 5 = 0 + 5</math>\n* In the [[natural number]]s '''N''' and all of its [[superset]]s (the [[integer]]s '''Z''' the [[rational number]]s '''Q''', the [[real number]]s '''R''', or the [[complex number]]s '''C'''), the additive identity is 0.

This is defined to be different from the [[multiplicative identity]] [[1 (number)|1]] if the ring (or field) has more than one element.

This can be seen because:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n              s \\cdot 0 &= s \\cdot (0 + 0) = s \\cdot 0 + s \\cdot 0 \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow s \\cdot 0 &= s \\cdot 0 - s \\cdot  0 \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow s \\cdot 0 &= 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===The additive and multiplicative identities are different in a non-trivial ring===\nLet ''R'' be a ring and suppose that the additive identity 0 and the multiplicative identity 1 are equal, or 0 = 1.

[[0 (number)|Zero]] is the additive inverse of itself.\n\nThe additive inverse of {{mvar|a}} is denoted by [[unary operation|unary]] [[minus sign|minus]]: −{{mvar|a}} (see the discussion [[#Relation to subtraction|below]]). For example, the additive inverse of 7 is −7, because 7&nbsp;+&nbsp;(−7)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and the additive inverse of −0.3 is 0.3, because −0.3&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.3&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 .\n\nThe additive inverse is defined as its [[inverse element]] under the [[binary operation]] of addition (see the discussion [[#Formal definition|below]]), which allows a broad [[generalization]] to mathematical objects other than numbers. As for any inverse operation, [[function composition|double]] additive inverse has [[identity function|no net effect]]: {{math|−(−''x'') {{=}} ''x''}}.\n{{anchor|diameter}}[[Image:NegativeI2Root.svg|thumb|right|These complex numbers, two of eight values of [[root of unity|{{radic|1|8}}]], are mutually opposite]]\n\n==Common examples==\nFor a number and, generally, in any [[ring (algebra)|ring]], the additive inverse can be calculated using [[multiplication]] by [[−1]]; that is, {{math|1=−{{mvar|n}} = &minus;1 × {{mvar|n}}}} . Examples of rings of numbers are [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s, and [[complex number]]s.\n\n===Relation to subtraction===\nAdditive inverse is closely related to [[subtraction]], which can be viewed as an addition of the opposite:\n:{{math|''a'' − ''b''  {{=}}  ''a'' + (−''b'')}}.\nConversely, additive inverse can be thought of as subtraction from zero:\n:{{math|−''a''  {{=}}  0 − ''a''}}.\nHence, unary minus sign notation can be seen as a shorthand for subtraction with \"0\" symbol omitted, although in a correct [[typography]] there should be no [[space (punctuation)|space]] after unary&nbsp;\"−\".\n\n===Other properties===\nIn addition to the identities listed above, negation has the following algebraic properties:\n* {{math|−(−''a'') {{=}} ''a''}}, it is an [[Involution (mathematics)|Involution operation]]\n* {{math|−(''a'' + ''b'') {{=}} (−''a'') + (−''b'')}}\n* {{math|''a'' − (−''b'') {{=}} ''a'' + ''b''}}\n* {{math|(−''a'') × ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' × (−''b'') {{=}} −(''a'' × ''b'')}}\n* {{math|(−''a'') × (−''b'') {{=}} ''a'' × ''b'' }}\n*: notably, {{math|(−''a'')[[square (algebra)|<sup>2</sup>]] {{=}} ''a''<sup>2</sup> }}\n\n==Formal definition==\nThe notation '''+''' is usually reserved for [[commutative]] binary operations; i.e., such that {{math|1={{mvar|x}} + {{mvar|y}} = {{mvar|y}} + {{mvar|x}}}}, for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}. If such an operation admits an [[identity element]] {{mvar|o}} (such that {{math|1={{mvar|x}} + ''o'' ( = ''o'' + {{mvar|x}} ) = {{mvar|x}}}} for all {{mvar|x}}), then this element is unique ( {{math|1=''o&prime;'' = ''o&prime;'' + ''o'' = ''o''}} ). For a given {{mvar|x}} , if there exists {{mvar|x&prime;}} such that {{math|1={{mvar|x}} + {{mvar|x&prime;}} ( = {{mvar|x&prime;}} + {{mvar|x}} ) = ''o''}} , then {{mvar|x&prime;}} is called an additive inverse of {{mvar|x}}.\n\nIf + is [[associativity|associative]] ({{math|1=( ''x'' + ''y'' ) + ''z'' = ''x'' + ( ''y'' + ''z'' )}} for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}}), then an additive inverse is unique. To see this, let {{mvar|x&prime;}} and {{mvar|x″}} each be additive inverses of {{mvar|x}}; then\n\n:{{math|1=''x&prime;'' = ''x&prime;'' + ''o'' = ''x&prime;'' + (''x'' + ''x″'') = (''x&prime;'' + ''x'') + ''x″'' = ''o'' + ''x″'' = ''x″''}}.\n\nFor example, since addition of real numbers is associative, each real number has a unique additive inverse.\n\n== Other examples ==\nAll the following examples are in fact [[abelian group]]s:\n\n* [[complex number]]s: {{math|−(''a'' + ''bi'')  {{=}}  (−''a'') + (−''b'')''i''}}. On the [[complex plane]], this operation [[rotation (mathematics)|rotates]] a complex number 180 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] around the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (see the image [[#diameter|above]]).\n* addition of real- and complex-valued functions: here, the additive inverse of a function {{mvar|f}} is the function −{{mvar|f}} defined by {{math|1=(−''f'' )(''x'') = − ''f'' (''x'')}} , for all {{mvar|x}}, such that {{math|1=''f'' + (−''f'' ) = ''o''}} , the zero function ( {{math|1=''o''(''x'') = 0}} for all {{mvar|x}} ).\n* more generally, what precedes applies to all functions with values in an abelian group ('zero' meaning then the identity element of this group):\n* [[sequence]]s, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[net (mathematics)|nets]] are also special kinds of functions.\n* In a [[vector space]] the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} is often called the opposite vector of {{math|'''v'''}}; it has the same [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude]] as the original and opposite direction. Additive inversion corresponds to [[scalar multiplication]] by −1. For [[Euclidean space]], it is [[point reflection]] in the origin. Vectors in exactly opposite directions (multiplied to negative numbers) are sometimes referred to as '''antiparallel'''.\n** [[vector space]]-valued functions (not necessarily linear),\n* In [[modular arithmetic]], the '''modular additive inverse''' of {{mvar|x}} is also defined: it is the number {{mvar|a}} such that {{math|1={{mvar|a}} + {{mvar|x}} ≡ 0 (mod {{mvar|n}})}}.  This additive inverse always exists. For example, the inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 8 because it is the solution to {{math|1= 3 + ''x'' ≡ 0 (mod 11)}}.\n\n== Non-examples ==\n[[Natural number]]s, [[cardinal number]]s, and [[ordinal number]]s, do not have additive inverses within their respective [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Thus, for example, we can say that natural numbers ''do'' have additive inverses, but because these additive inverses are not themselves natural numbers, the set of natural numbers is not [[closure (mathematics)|''closed'']] under taking additive inverses.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Additive identity]]\n* [[Absolute value]] (related through the identity {{math|{{!}} −''x'' {{!}} {{=}} {{!}} ''x'' {{!}} }}).\n* [[Involution (mathematics)]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{MathWorld|title=Additive Inverse|urlname=AdditiveInverse|author=Margherita Barile}}\n\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]\n[[Category:Arithmetic]]\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]"

Cohn. (1981) ''Universal Algebra'', Springer, p. 41.</ref>\n\nExamples of algebraic structures include [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[lattice (order)|lattices]]. More complex structures can be defined by introducing multiple operations, different underlying sets, or by altering the defining axioms. Examples of more complex algebraic structures include [[vector space]]s, [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebras]].\n\nThe properties of specific algebraic structures are studied in abstract algebra.  The general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in [[universal algebra]]. The language of [[category theory]] is used to express and study relationships between different classes of algebraic and non-algebraic objects. This is because it is sometimes possible to find strong connections between some classes of objects, sometimes of different kinds. For example, [[Galois theory]] establishes a connection between certain fields and groups: two algebraic structures of different kinds.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nAddition and multiplication on numbers are the prototypical example of an operation that combines two elements of a set to produce a third. These operations obey several algebraic laws. For example, ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' and ''a''(''bc'') = (''ab'')''c'', both examples of the ''associative law''. Also ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'', and ''ab'' = ''ba'', the ''commutative law.'' Many systems studied by mathematicians have operations that obey some, but not necessarily all, of the laws of ordinary arithmetic. For example, rotations of objects in three-dimensional space can be combined by performing the first rotation and then applying the second rotation to the object in its new orientation. This operation on rotations obeys the associative law, but can fail the commutative law.\n\nMathematicians give names to sets with one or more operations that obey a particular collection of laws, and study them in the abstract as algebraic structures. When a new problem can be shown to follow the laws of one of these algebraic structures, all the work that has been done on that category in the past can be applied to the new problem.\n\nIn full generality, algebraic structures may involve an arbitrary number of sets and operations that can combine more than two elements (higher [[arity]]), but this article focuses on binary operations on one or two sets. The examples here are by no means a complete list, but they are meant to be a representative list and include the most common structures. Longer lists of algebraic structures may be found in the external links and within ''[[:Category:Algebraic structures]].'' Structures are listed in approximate order of increasing complexity.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== One set with operations ===\n\n'''Simple structures''': '''no''' [[binary operation]]:\n\n* [[Set (mathematics)|Set]]: a degenerate algebraic structure ''S''   having no operations.\n* [[Pointed set]]: ''S'' has one or more distinguished elements, often 0, 1, or both.\n* {{anchor|unary system}}Unary system: ''S'' and a single [[unary operation]] over ''S''.\n* {{vanchor|Pointed unary system}}: a unary system with ''S'' a pointed set.\n\n'''Group-like structures''': '''one''' binary operation.

Every quadratic space is also an inner product space (see below).\n\n'''[[algebra (ring theory)|Algebra]]-like structures''': composite system defined over two sets, a ring ''R'' and an ''R''-module ''M'' equipped with an operation called multiplication. This can be viewed as a system with five binary operations: two operations on ''R'', two on ''M'' and one involving both ''R'' and ''M''.\n\n* [[Algebra over a ring]] (also ''R-algebra''): a module over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', which also carries a multiplication operation that is compatible with the module structure. This includes distributivity over addition and [[Bilinear map|linearity]] with respect to multiplication by elements of ''R''. The theory of an [[algebra over a field]] is especially well developed.\n* [[Associative algebra]]: an algebra over a ring such that the multiplication is [[associative property|associative]].\n* [[Nonassociative algebra]]: a module over a commutative ring, equipped with a ring multiplication operation that is not necessarily associative. Often associativity is replaced with a different identity, such as [[alternative algebra|alternation]], the [[Jacobi identity]], or the [[Jordan identity]].\n* [[Coalgebra]]: a vector space with a \"comultiplication\" defined dually to that of associative algebras.\n* [[Lie algebra]]: a special type of nonassociative algebra whose product satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]].\n* [[Lie coalgebra]]: a vector space with a \"comultiplication\" defined dually to that of Lie algebras.\n* [[Graded algebra]]: a graded vector space with an algebra structure compatible with the grading. The idea is that if the grades of two elements ''a'' and ''b'' are known, then the grade of ''ab'' is known, and so the location of the product ''ab'' is determined in the decomposition.\n* [[Inner product space]]: an ''F'' vector space ''V'' with a sesquilinear binary operation {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V'' → ''F''}}.\n\n'''Four''' or more binary operations:\n\n* [[Bialgebra]]: an associative algebra with a compatible coalgebra structure.\n* [[Lie bialgebra]]: a Lie algebra with a compatible bialgebra structure.\n* [[Hopf algebra]]: a bialgebra with a connection axiom (antipode).\n* [[Clifford algebra]]: a graded associative algebra equipped with an [[exterior product]] from which may be derived several possible inner products.  [[Exterior algebra]]s and [[geometric algebra]]s are special cases of this construction.\n\n== Hybrid structures ==\n\nAlgebraic structures can also coexist with added structure of non-algebraic nature, such as [[Partially ordered set#Formal definition|partial order]] or a [[topology]]. The added structure must be compatible, in some sense, with the algebraic structure.\n\n* [[Topological group]]: a group with a topology compatible with the group operation.\n* [[Lie group]]: a topological group with a compatible smooth [[manifold]] structure.\n* [[Ordered group]]s, [[ordered ring]]s and [[ordered field]]s: each type of structure with a compatible [[partial order]].\n* [[Archimedean group]]: a linearly ordered group for which the [[Archimedean property]] holds.\n* [[Topological vector space]]: a vector space whose ''M'' has a compatible topology.\n* [[Normed vector space]]: a vector space with a compatible [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]. If such a space is [[complete metric space|complete]] (as a metric space) then it is called a [[Banach space]].\n* [[Hilbert space]]: an inner product space over the real or complex numbers whose inner product gives rise to a Banach space structure.\n* [[Vertex operator algebra]]\n* [[Von Neumann algebra]]: a *-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space equipped with the [[weak operator topology]].\n\n== Universal algebra ==\n{{main | Universal algebra}}\nAlgebraic structures are defined through different configurations of [[axiom]]s. [[Universal algebra]] abstractly studies such objects. One major dichotomy is between structures that are axiomatized entirely by ''identities'' and structures that are not. If all axioms defining a class of algebras are identities, then this class is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] (not to be confused with [[algebraic varieties]] of [[algebraic geometry]]).\n\nIdentities are equations formulated using only the operations the structure allows, and variables that are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]] over the relevant [[universe (mathematics)|universe]]. Identities contain no [[Logical connective|connectives]], [[Quantification (science)|existentially quantified variables]], or [[finitary relation|relations]] of any kind other than the allowed operations. The study of varieties is an important part of [[universal algebra]]. An algebraic structure in a variety may be understood as the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] of term algebra (also called \"absolutely  [[free object|free algebra]]\") divided by the equivalence relations generated by a set of identities.  So, a collection of functions with given [[signature (logic)|signatures]] generate a free algebra, the [[term algebra]] ''T''. Given a set of equational identities (the axioms), one may consider their symmetric, transitive closure ''E''.  The quotient algebra ''T''/''E'' is then the algebraic structure or variety.  Thus, for example, groups have a signature containing two operators: the multiplication operator ''m'', taking two arguments, and the inverse operator ''i'', taking one argument, and the identity element ''e'', a constant, which may be considered an operator that takes zero arguments.  Given a (countable) set of variables ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', etc. the term algebra is the collection of all possible [[term (mathematics)|terms]] involving ''m'', ''i'', ''e'' and the variables; so for example, ''m(i(x), m(x,m(y,e)))'' would be an element of the term algebra. One of the axioms defining a group is the identity ''m(x, i(x)) = e''; another is ''m(x,e) = x''. The axioms can be represented as [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/variety+of+algebras#examples_4 trees]. These equations induce [[equivalence class]]es on the free algebra; the quotient algebra then has the algebraic structure of a group.\n\nSome structures do not form varieties, because either:\n\n# It is necessary that 0&nbsp;≠&nbsp;1, 0 being the additive [[identity element]] and 1 being a multiplicative identity element, but this is a nonidentity;\n# Structures such as fields have some axioms that hold only for nonzero members of ''S''. For an algebraic structure to be a variety, its operations must be defined for ''all'' members of ''S''; there can be no partial operations.\n\nStructures whose axioms unavoidably include nonidentities are among the most important ones in mathematics, e.g., [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s and [[division ring]]s. Structures with nonidentities present challenges varieties do not. For example, the [[direct product]] of two [[field (mathematics)|field]]s is not a field, because <math>(1,0)\\cdot(0,1)=(0,0)</math>, but fields do not have [[zero divisor]]s.\n\n== Category theory ==\n\n[[Category theory]] is another tool for studying algebraic structures (see, for example, Mac Lane 1998). A category is a collection of ''objects'' with associated ''morphisms.'' Every algebraic structure has its own notion of [[homomorphism]], namely any [[function (mathematics)|function]] compatible with the operation(s) defining the structure. In this way, every algebraic structure gives rise to a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. For example, the [[category of groups]] has all [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] as objects and all [[group homomorphism]]s as morphisms. This [[concrete category]] may be seen as a [[category of sets]] with added category-theoretic [[structure (category theory)|structure]]. Likewise, the category of [[topological group]]s (whose morphisms are the continuous group homomorphisms) is a [[category of topological spaces]] with extra structure. A [[forgetful functor]] between categories of algebraic structures \"forgets\" a part of a structure.\n\nThere are various concepts in category theory that try to capture the algebraic character of a context, for instance\n\n* [[algebraic category]]\n* [[essentially algebraic category]]\n* [[presentable category]]\n* [[locally presentable category]]\n* [[Monad (category theory)|monadic]] functors and categories\n* [[universal property]].\n\n== Different meanings of \"structure\" ==\n\nIn a slight [[abuse of notation]], the word \"structure\" can also refer to just the operations on a structure, instead of the underlying set itself. For example, the sentence, \"We have defined a ring ''structure'' on the set <math>A</math>,\" means that we have defined [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''operations'' on the set <math>A</math>. For another example, the group <math>(\\mathbb Z, +)</math> can be seen as a set <math>\\mathbb Z</math> that is equipped with an ''algebraic structure,'' namely the ''operation'' <math>+</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n\n* [[Free object]]\n* [[List of algebraic structures]]\n* [[Mathematical structure]]\n* [[Signature (logic)]]\n* [[Structure (mathematical logic)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{Citation | last1=Mac Lane | first1=Saunders | author1-link=Saunders Mac Lane | last2=Birkhoff | first2=Garrett | author2-link=Garrett Birkhoff | title=Algebra | publisher=AMS Chelsea | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8218-1646-2 | year=1999}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Michel | first1=Anthony N. | last2=Herget | first2=Charles J. | title=Applied Algebra and Functional Analysis | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-486-67598-5 | year=1993}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Burris | first1=Stanley N. | last2=Sankappanavar | first2=H.

In [[mathematical physics]], where [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] is of central importance, these operations are mostly called '''antisymmetric operations''', and are extended in an [[associative]] setting to cover more than two [[Argument of a function|arguments]]. Swapping the position of two arguments of an antisymmetric operation yields a result, which is the ''inverse'' of the result with unswapped arguments. The notion ''[[inverse element|inverse]]'' refers to a [[group (mathematics)|group structure]] on the operation's [[codomain]], possibly with another operation, such as [[addition]].\n\nA prominent example of an anticommutative operation is the  [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]].\n\n== Definition ==\nAn <math>n</math>[[Arity|-ary]] [[Operation_(mathematics)#General_definition|operation]] is antisymmetric if swapping the order of any two arguments [[inverse element|negates]] the result.

Functions vary widely in the number of arguments, though large numbers can become unwieldy. Some programming languages also offer support for [[variadic functions]], i.e., functions syntactically accepting a variable number of arguments.\n\n==Examples==\n{{Expand section|more math and logic examples|date=March 2012}}\nThe term \"arity\" is rarely employed in everyday usage. For example, rather than saying \"the arity of the [[addition]] operation is 2\" or \"addition is an operation of arity 2\" one usually says \"addition is a binary operation\".\nIn general, the naming of functions or operators with a given arity follows a convention similar to the one used for ''n''-based [[numeral system]]s such as [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[hexadecimal]]. One combines a [[Latin]] prefix with the -ary ending; for example:\n\n* A nullary function takes no arguments.\n** Example: <math>f()=2</math>\n* A [[unary operation|unary function]] takes one argument.\n** Example: <math>f(x)=2x</math>\n* A [[binary operation|binary function]] takes two arguments.\n** Example: <math>f(x,y)=2xy</math>\n* A [[ternary operation|ternary function]] takes three arguments.\n** Example: <math>f(x,y,z)=2xyz</math>\n* An ''n''-ary function takes ''n'' arguments.\n** Example: <math>f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)=2\\prod_{i=1}^n \\displaystyle x_i</math>\n\n===Nullary===\nSometimes it is useful to consider a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] to be an operation of arity 0, and hence call it ''nullary''.\n\nAlso, in non-[[functional programming]], a function without arguments can be meaningful and not necessarily constant (due to [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s). Often, such functions have in fact some ''hidden input'' which might be [[global variable]]s, including the whole state of the system (time, free memory, ...). The latter are important examples which usually also exist in \"purely\" functional programming languages.\n\n===Unary===\nExamples of [[unary operator]]s in mathematics and in programming include the unary minus and plus, the increment and decrement operators in [[C (programming language)|C]]-style languages (not in logical languages), and the [[Successor function|successor]], [[factorial]], [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]], [[floor function|floor]], [[ceiling function|ceiling]], [[fractional part]], [[sign (mathematics)|sign]], [[absolute value]], [[square root]] (the principal square root), [[complex conjugate]] (unary of \"one\" complex number, that however has two parts at a lower level of abstraction), and [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] functions in mathematics. The [[two's complement]], [[Reference (computer science)|address reference]] and the [[logical NOT]] operators are examples of unary operators in math and programming.\n\nAll functions in [[lambda calculus]] and in some [[functional programming language]]s (especially those descended from [[ML (programming language)|ML]]) are technically unary, but see [[#n-ary|n-ary]] below.\n\nAccording to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], the Latin distributives being ''singuli, bini, terni,'' and so forth, the term \"singulary\" is the correct adjective, rather than \"unary.\"<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Quine\n  | first = W.

For both programming and mathematics these can be the [[multiplication operator]], the radix operator, the often omitted [[exponentiation]] operator, the [[logarithm]] operator, the addition operator, the division operator. Logical predicates such as ''OR'', ''[[exclusive or|XOR]]'', ''AND'', ''IMP'' are typically used as binary operators with two distinct operands. In [[Complex instruction set computing|CISC]] architectures, it's common to have two source operands (and store result in one of them).\n\n===Ternary===\nCommon ternary operations besides generic function in mathemathics are the [[summatory]] and the [[productory]] though some other n-ary operation may be implied.\n\nThe computer programming language  [[C (programming language)|C]] and its various descendants (including [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Perl]], and others) provides the [[ternary operator]] <code>[[?:]]</code>, also known as the [[conditional operator]], taking three operands. The first operand (the condition) is evaluated, and if it is true, the result of the entire expression is the value of the second operand, otherwise it is the value of the third operand. The [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] language also contains a ternary operator, <code>*/</code>, which multiplies the first two (one-cell) numbers, dividing by the third, with the intermediate result being a double cell number. This is used when the intermediate result would overflow a single cell. The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] language has a ternary conditional expression, <code>x if C else y</code>. The Unix [[dc (computer program)|dc calculator]] has several ternary operators, such as <code>|</code>, which will pop three values from the stack and efficiently compute <math display=\"inline\">x^y \\bmod z</math> with [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]]. Additionally, many ([[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]]) [[assembly language]] instructions are ternary (as opposed to only two operands specified in CISC); or higher, such as <source lang=\"asm\" inline>MOV %AX, (%BX, %CX)</source>, which will load (MOV) into register {{mono|AX}} the contents of a calculated memory location that is the sum (parenthesis) of the registers {{mono|BX}} and {{mono|CX}}.\n<!-- examples section needs complete rewrite, with links and subsection on math, logic and programming -->\n\n===''n''-ary===\nFrom a mathematical point of view, a function of ''n'' arguments can always be considered as a function of one single argument which is an element of some [[product space]]. However, it may be convenient for notation to consider ''n''-ary functions, as for example [[multilinear map]]s (which are not linear maps on the product space, if ''n''≠1).\n\nThe same is true for programming languages, where functions taking several arguments could always be defined as functions taking a single argument of some [[object composition|composite type]] such as a [[tuple]], or in languages with [[higher-order function]]s, by [[currying]].\n\n===Variable arity===\nIn computer science, a function accepting a variable number of arguments is called ''[[variadic function|variadic]]''. In logic and philosophy, predicates or relations accepting a variable number of arguments are called ''[[multigrade predicate|multigrade]]'', anadic, or variably polyadic.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/113.452.609 | last1 = Oliver | first1 = Alex | year = 2004 | title = Multigrade Predicates | url = | journal = Mind | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 609–681 }}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThere are Latinate names for specific arities, primarily based on Latin [[distributive number]]s meaning \"in group of ''n''\", though some are based on [[cardinal number]]s or [[ordinal number]]s. Only ''binary'' and ''ternary'' are both commonly used and derived from distributive numbers.\n\n* ''Nullary'' means 0-ary (from ''nūllus'').\n* ''[[Unary operation|Unary]]'' means 1-ary (from cardinal ''unus'', rather than ''singulary'' from distributive ''singulī'').\n* ''[[Binary operation|Binary]]'' means 2-ary.\n* ''[[Ternary operation|Ternary]]'' means 3-ary.\n* ''Quaternary'' means 4-ary.\n* ''Quinary'' means 5-ary.\n* ''Senary'' means  6-ary.\n* ''Septenary'' means 7-ary.\n* ''Octonary'' means 8-ary (alternatively ''octary'').\n* ''Novenary'' means 9-ary (alternatively ''nonary'', from ordinal).\n* ''Denary'' means 10-ary (alternatively ''decenary'')\n* ''Polyadic'', ''multary'' and ''multiary'' mean 2 or more operands (or parameters).\n* ''n''-''ary'' means ''n'' operands (or parameters), but is often used as a synonym of \"polyadic\".\n\nSo we can use any [[decimal prefix|decimal]] [[unit prefix]] to expand the concept to [[Yotta-|yotta]]<nowiki/>nary (10<sup>24</sup>-ary) or [[googolplex]]<nowiki/>anary (10{{sup|10{{sup|100}}}}-ary), but no usage has been found for this yet.\n\nAn alternative nomenclature is derived in a similar fashion from the corresponding [[Greek language|Greek]] roots; for example, ''niladic'' (or ''medadic''), ''monadic'', ''dyadic'', ''triadic'', ''polyadic'', and so on.  Thence derive the alternative terms ''adicity'' and ''adinity'' for the Latin-derived ''arity''.\n\nThese words are often used to describe anything related to that number (e.g., [[undenary chess]] is a [[chess variant]] with an 11×11 board, or the [[Millenary Petition]] of 1603).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Logic}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Logic of relatives]]\n* [[Binary relation]]\n* [[Triadic relation]]\n* [[Theory of relations]]\n* [[Signature (logic)]]\n* [[Parameter]]\n* [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]\n* [[Cardinality]]\n* [[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n* [[n-ary code|''n''-ary code]]\n* [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|Appendix:English arities and adicities}}\nA monograph available free online:\n\n* Burris, Stanley N., and H.P.

In [[propositional logic]], '''associativity''' is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement]] for [[well-formed formula|expressions]] in [[Formal proof|logical proofs]].\n\nWithin an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the [[operand]]s is not changed. That is, (after rewriting the expression with parentheses and in infix notation if necessary) rearranging the [[parentheses]] in such an expression will not change its value. Consider the following equations:\n\n:<math>(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 \\,</math>\n\n:<math>2 \\times (3 \\times 4) = (2 \\times 3) \\times 4 = 24 .</math>\n\nEven though the parentheses were rearranged on each line, the values of the expressions were not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any [[real number]]s, it can be said that \"addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations\".\n\nAssociativity is not the same as [[commutativity]], which addresses whether or not the order of two [[operand]]s changes the result. For example, the order does not matter in the multiplication of real numbers, that is, {{nowrap|1=''a'' × ''b'' = ''b'' × ''a''}}, so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation.\n\nAssociative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many [[algebraic structure]]s (such as [[semigroup (mathematics)|semigroups]] and [[category (mathematics)|categories]]) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.\n\nHowever, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some examples include [[subtraction]], [[exponentiation]], and the [[vector cross product]].  In contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers, the addition of [[floating point]] numbers in computer science is not associative, and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Semigroup_associative.svg|thumbnail|A binary operation ∗ on the set ''S'' is associative when [[Commutative diagram|this diagram commutes]].

For instance, a product of four elements may be written, without changing the order of the factors, in five possible ways:\n\n: <math>((ab)c)d</math>\n: <math>(ab)(cd)</math>\n: <math>(a(bc))d</math>\n: <math>a((bc)d)</math>\n: <math>a(b(cd))</math>\n\nIf the product operation is associative, the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result. So unless the formula with omitted parentheses already has a different meaning (see below), the parentheses can be considered unnecessary and \"the\" product can be written unambiguously as\n\n:<math>abcd.</math>\n\nAs the number of elements increases, the [[Catalan number#Applications in combinatorics|number of possible ways to insert parentheses]] grows quickly, but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation.\n\nAn example where this does not work is the [[logical biconditional]] <math>\\leftrightarrow</math>. It is associative, thus A<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>(B<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>C) is equivalent to (A<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>B)<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>C, but A<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>B<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>C most commonly means (A<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>B and B<math>\\leftrightarrow</math>C), which is not equivalent.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Associativity of binary operations (without question marks).svg|thumb|In associative operations is <math>(x\\circ y)\\circ z = x\\circ(y\\circ z)</math>.]]\n[[File:Associativity of real number addition.svg|thumb|The addition of real numbers is associative.]]\nSome examples of associative operations include the following.\n\n* The [[string concatenation|concatenation]] of the three strings <code>\"hello\"</code>, <code>\" \"</code>, <code>\"world\"</code> can be computed by concatenating the first two strings (giving <code>\"hello \"</code>) and appending the third string (<code>\"world\"</code>), or by joining the second and third string (giving <code>\" world\"</code>) and concatenating the first string (<code>\"hello\"</code>) with the result. The two methods produce the same result; string concatenation is associative (but not commutative).\n* In [[arithmetic]], [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s are associative; i.e.,\n:: <math>\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\n(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z\\quad\n\\\\\n(x\\,y)z=x(y\\,z)=x\\,y\\,z\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\ \\ \\,\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n\\mbox{for all }x,y,z\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n</math>\n:Because of associativity, the grouping parentheses can be omitted without ambiguity.\n* The trivial operation {{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''y'' = ''x''}} (that is, the result is the first argument, no matter what the second argument is) is associative but not commutative. Likewise, the trivial operation {{math|1=''x'' ∘ ''y'' = ''y''}} (that is, the result is the second argument, no matter what the first argument is) is associative but not commutative.\n* Addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s and [[quaternion]]s are associative. Addition of [[octonion]]s is also associative, but multiplication of octonions is non-associative.\n* The [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]] functions act associatively.\n:: <math>\n\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{gcd}(\\operatorname{gcd}(x,y),z)=\n\\operatorname{gcd}(x,\\operatorname{gcd}(y,z))=\n\\operatorname{gcd}(x,y,z)\\ \\quad\n\\\\\n\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y),z)=\n\\operatorname{lcm}(x,\\operatorname{lcm}(y,z))=\n\\operatorname{lcm}(x,y,z)\\quad\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\\mbox{ for all }x,y,z\\in\\mathbb{Z}.\n</math>\n* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]:\n:: <math>\n\n\\left.\n\\begin{matrix}\n(A\\cap B)\\cap C=A\\cap(B\\cap C)=A\\cap B\\cap C\\quad\n\\\\\n(A\\cup B)\\cup C=A\\cup(B\\cup C)=A\\cup B\\cup C\\quad\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\\mbox{for all sets }A,B,C.\n</math>\n* If ''M'' is some set and ''S'' denotes the set of all functions from ''M'' to ''M'', then the operation of [[function composition]] on ''S'' is associative:\n\n:: <math>(f\\circ g)\\circ h=f\\circ(g\\circ h)=f\\circ g\\circ h\\qquad\\mbox{for all }f,g,h\\in S.</math>\n* Slightly more generally, given four sets ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'', with ''h'': ''M'' to ''N'', ''g'': ''N'' to ''P'', and ''f'': ''P'' to ''Q'', then\n\n:: <math>(f\\circ g)\\circ h=f\\circ(g\\circ h)=f\\circ g\\circ h</math>\n\n: as before. In short, composition of maps is always associative.\n* Consider a set with three elements, A, B, and C. The following operation:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! × !! A !! B !! C\n|-\n! A\n| A || A || A\n|-\n! B\n| A || B || C\n|-\n! C\n| A || A || A\n|}\n\n:is associative. Thus, for example, A(BC)=(AB)C = A. This operation is not commutative.\n* Because [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] represent [[linear map|linear function]]s, and [[matrix multiplication]] represents function composition, one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/composition-of-transformations/v/matrix-product-associativity|title=Matrix product associativity|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Propositional logic ==\n\n=== Rule of replacement ===\nIn standard truth-functional propositional logic, ''association'',<ref>Moore and Parker{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref><ref>Copi and Cohen{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> or ''associativity''<ref>Hurley{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> are two [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]].

Symbolically,\n\n:<math>(x*y)*z\\ne x*(y*z)\\qquad\\mbox{for some }x,y,z\\in S.</math>\n\nFor such an operation the order of evaluation ''does'' matter.

One area within [[non-associative algebra]] that has grown very large is that of [[Lie algebra]]s. There the associative law is replaced by the [[Jacobi identity]]. Lie algebras abstract the essential nature of [[infinitesimal transformation]]s, and have become ubiquitous in mathematics.\n\nThere are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth; these tend to come from some specific applications or areas such as [[combinatorial mathematics]]. Other examples are [[Quasigroup]], [[Quasifield]], [[Non-associative ring]], [[Non-associative algebra]] and [[Commutative non-associative magmas]].\n\n===Nonassociativity of floating point calculation===\n\nIn mathematics, addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative.  By contrast, in computer science, the addition and multiplication of [[floating point]] numbers is ''not'' associative, as rounding errors are introduced when dissimilar-sized values are joined together.<ref>Knuth, Donald, [[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 3, section 4.2.2</ref>\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a floating point representation with a 4-bit mantissa:\n<br />(1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>0</sup> +\n1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>0</sup>) +\n1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>4</sup> =\n1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>1</sup> +\n1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>4</sup> =\n1.00{{fontcolor|red|1}}<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>4</sup>\n<br />1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>0</sup> +\n(1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>0</sup> +\n1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>4</sup>) =\n1.000<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>0</sup> +\n1.00{{fontcolor|red|0}}<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>4</sup> =\n1.00{{fontcolor|red|0}}<sub>2</sub>×2<sup>4</sup>\n\nEven though most computers compute with a 24 or 53 bits of mantissa,<ref>{{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5}}</ref> this is an important source of rounding error, and approaches such as the [[Kahan summation algorithm]] are ways to minimise the errors.

However, [[mathematician]]s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations.

      "text": "{{see also|Automorphic (disambiguation){{!}}Automorphic}}\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''automorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] from a [[mathematical object]] to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''[[automorphism group]]'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.\n\n==Definition==\nIn the context of [[abstract algebra]], a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An '''automorphism''' is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]] of an object with itself. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example, [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).\n\nThe [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.\n\nThe exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of \"mathematical object\" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an \"isomorphism\" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.\n\nIn category theory, an '''automorphism''' is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e., a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).\n\nThis is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.\n\n==Automorphism group==\n{{main|automorphism group}}\nIf the automorphisms of an object {{var|X}} form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''[[automorphism group]]''' of {{var|X}}.\n;[[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: Composition of two automorphisms is another automorphism.\n;[[Associativity]]: It is part of the definition of a category that composition of morphisms is associative.\n;[[Identity element|Identity]]: The identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself, which is an automorphism.\n;[[Inverse element|Inverses]]: By definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.\n\nThe automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut<sub>''C''</sub>(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.\n\n==Examples==\n* In [[set theory]], an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of a set ''X'' is an automorphism. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.\n* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.\n* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' → Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.<ref name=Pahl>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvoaoWOfqd8C&pg=PA376 |page=376 |chapter=§7.5.5 Automorphisms |title=Mathematical foundations of computational engineering |edition=Felix Pahl translation |author=PJ Pahl, R Damrath |isbn=3-540-67995-2 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer}}</ref>\n* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' → ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of ''V'' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').\n* A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R'''). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely ([[uncountable|uncountably]]) many \"wild\" automorphisms (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Yale | first = Paul B. | journal = Mathematics Magazine | title = Automorphisms of the Complex Numbers | volume = 39 | issue = 3 |date=May 1966 | pages = 135–141 | url = http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/PaulBYale.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2689301 | jstor = 2689301}}</ref><ref>{{cite |last=Lounesto |first=Pertti |year=2001 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |title=Clifford Algebras and Spinors | edition = 2nd |pages= 22–23|isbn=0-521-00551-5 }}</ref> Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.\n* The automorphism group of the [[quaternion]]s ('''H''') as a ring are the inner automorphisms, by the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]]: maps of the form {{nowrap|''a'' ↦ ''bab''<sup>−1</sup>}}.{{refn|{{citation|year=2003|title=Handbook of algebra|volume=3|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|page=453}}}}. This group is [[Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation|isomorphic]] to [[SO(3)]], the group of rotations in 3-dimensional space.\n* The automorphism group of the [[octonions]] ('''O''') is the exceptional Lie group [[G2_(mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]].\n* In [[graph theory]] an [[graph automorphism|automorphism of a graph]] is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.\n* In [[geometry]], an automorphism may be called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:\n** In [[metric geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].\n** In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[Möbius transformation]]s.\n** An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').\n** In [[topology]], morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is ''not sufficient'' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[icosian calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Memorandum respecting a new System of Roots of Unity\n|author=Sir William Rowan Hamilton\n|author-link=William Rowan Hamilton\n|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Icosian/NewSys.pdf\n|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]\n|volume=12\n|year=1856\n|pages=446\n}}</ref> writing:\n<blockquote>so that <math>\\mu</math> is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root <math>\\lambda</math> by relations of perfect reciprocity.</blockquote>\n\n==Inner and outer automorphisms==\n{{main article|Inner automorphism|Outer automorphism group}}\nIn some categories—notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called \"inner\" and \"outer\" automorphisms.\n\nIn the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation {{nowrap|''φ''<sub>''a''</sub> : ''G'' → ''G''}} given by {{nowrap|1=''φ''<sub>''a''</sub>(''g'') = ''aga''<sup>−1</sup>}} (or ''a''<sup>−1</sup>''ga''; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(''G''), denoted by Inn(''G''); this is called [[Goursat's lemma]].\n\nThe other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] {{nowrap|Aut(''G'') / Inn(''G'')}} is usually denoted by Out(''G''); the non-trivial elements are the [[cosets]] that contain the outer automorphisms.\n\nThe same definition holds in any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where ''a'' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antiautomorphism]]\n* [[Mathematics of Sudoku#Automorphic Sudokus|Automorphism]] (in Sudoku puzzles)\n* [[Characteristic subgroup]]\n* [[Endomorphism ring]]\n* [[Frobenius automorphism]]\n* [[Morphism]]\n* [[Order automorphism]] (in [[order theory]]).\n* [[Isomorphism#A relation-preserving isomorphism|Relation-preserving automorphism]]\n* [[Fractional Fourier transform]]\n\n==References==\n<!-- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for instructions. -->\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Automorphism ''Automorphism'' at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=Automorphism | title = Automorphism}}\n\n[[Category:Morphisms]]\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]\n[[Category:Symmetry]]"

More concretely, for a finite-dimensional vector space, non-degenerate means that every non-zero element pairs non-trivially with some other element:\n:<math>B(x,y)=0\\,</math> for all <math>y \\in V</math> implies that {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}} and\n:<math>B(x,y)=0\\,</math> for all <math>x \\in V</math> implies that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 0}}.\n\nThe corresponding notion for a module over a commutative ring is that a bilinear form is '''{{visible anchor|unimodular}}''' if {{nowrap|''V'' → ''V''<sup>∗</sup>}} is an isomorphism. Given a finitely generated module over a commutative ring, the pairing may be injective (hence \"nondegenerate\" in the above sense) but not unimodular. For example, over the integers, the pairing {{nowrap|1=''B''(''x'', ''y'') = 2''xy''}} is nondegenerate but not unimodular, as the induced map from {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''Z'''}} to {{nowrap|1=''V''<sup>∗</sup> = '''Z'''}} is multiplication by 2.\n\nIf ''V'' is finite-dimensional then one can identify ''V'' with its double dual ''V''<sup>∗∗</sup>. One can then show that ''B''<sub>2</sub> is the [[transpose]] of the linear map ''B''<sub>1</sub> (if ''V'' is infinite-dimensional then ''B''<sub>2</sub> is the transpose of ''B''<sub>1</sub> restricted to the image of ''V'' in ''V''<sup>∗∗</sup>). Given ''B'' one can define the ''transpose'' of ''B'' to be the bilinear form given by\n:<sup>t</sup>''B''('''v''', '''w''') = ''B''('''w''', '''v''').\n\nThe '''left radical''' and '''right radical''' of the form ''B'' are the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]s of ''B''<sub>1</sub> and ''B''<sub>2</sub> respectively;{{sfn|Jacobson|2009|page=346}} they are the vectors orthogonal to the whole space on the left and on the right.{{sfn|Zhelobenko|2006|page=11}}\n\nIf ''V'' is finite-dimensional then the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of ''B''<sub>1</sub> is equal to the rank of ''B''<sub>2</sub>. If this number is equal to dim(''V'') then ''B''<sub>1</sub> and ''B''<sub>2</sub> are linear isomorphisms from ''V'' to ''V''<sup>∗</sup>.  In this case ''B'' is nondegenerate.  By the [[rank–nullity theorem]], this is equivalent to the condition that the left and equivalently right radicals be trivial.  For finite-dimensional spaces, this is often taken as the ''definition'' of nondegeneracy:\n\n: '''Definition:''' ''B'' is '''nondegenerate''' if {{nowrap|1=''B''('''v''', '''w''') = 0}} for all '''w''' implies {{nowrap|1='''v''' = '''0'''}}.\n\nGiven any linear map {{nowrap|1=''A'' : ''V'' → ''V''<sup>∗</sup>}} one can obtain a bilinear form ''B'' on ''V'' via\n: ''B''('''v''', '''w''') = ''A''('''v''')('''w''').\n\nThis form will be nondegenerate if and only if ''A'' is an isomorphism.\n\nIf ''V'' is [[finite-dimensional]] then, relative to some [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'', a bilinear form is degenerate if and only if the [[determinant]] of the associated matrix is zero. Likewise, a nondegenerate form is one for which the determinant of the associated matrix is non-zero (the matrix is [[non-singular matrix|non-singular]]). These statements are independent of the chosen basis. For a module over a commutative ring, a unimodular form is one for which the determinant of the associate matrix is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] (for example 1), hence the term; note that a form whose matrix is non-zero but not a unit will be nondegenerate but not unimodular, for example {{nowrap|1=''B''(''x'', ''y'') = 2''xy''}} over the integers.\n\n==Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms==\nWe define a bilinear form to be\n* '''[[Symmetric bilinear form|symmetric]]''' if {{nowrap|1=''B''('''v''', '''w''') = ''B''('''w''', '''v''')}} for all '''v''', '''w''' in ''V'';\n* '''[[Alternating form|alternating]]''' if {{nowrap|1=''B''('''v''', '''v''') = 0}} for all '''v''' in ''V'';\n* '''skew-symmetric''' if {{nowrap|1=''B''('''v''', '''w''') = −''B''('''w''', '''v''')}} for all '''v''', '''w''' in ''V'';\n*: '''Proposition:''' Every alternating form is skew-symmetric.\n*: '''Proof:''' This can be seen by expanding {{nowrap|''B''('''v''' + '''w''', '''v''' + '''w''')}}.\n\nIf the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' is not 2 then the converse is also true: every skew-symmetric form is alternating. If, however, {{nowrap|1=char(''K'') = 2}} then a skew-symmetric form is the same as a symmetric form and there exist symmetric/skew-symmetric forms that are not alternating.\n\nA bilinear form is symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) [[if and only if]] its coordinate matrix (relative to any basis) is [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] (resp. [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]). A bilinear form is alternating if and only if its coordinate matrix is skew-symmetric and the diagonal entries are all zero (which follows from skew-symmetry when {{nowrap|char(''K'') ≠ 2}}).\n\nA bilinear form is symmetric if and only if the maps {{nowrap|''B''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>2</sub>: ''V'' → ''V''<sup>∗</sup>}} are equal, and skew-symmetric if and only if they are negatives of one another. If {{nowrap|char(''K'') ≠ 2}} then one can decompose a bilinear form into a symmetric and a skew-symmetric part as follows\n: <math>B^{+} = \\tfrac{1}{2} (B + {}^{\\text{t}}B)  \\qquad  B^{-} = \\tfrac{1}{2} (B - {}^{\\text{t}}B) ,</math>\n\nwhere <sup>t</sup>''B'' is the transpose of ''B'' (defined above).\n\n==Derived quadratic form==\n\nFor any bilinear form {{nowrap|''B'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''K''}}, there exists an associated [[quadratic form]] {{nowrap|''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K''}} defined by {{nowrap|''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K'' : '''v''' ↦ ''B''('''v''', '''v''')}}.\n\nWhen {{nowrap|char(''K'') ≠ 2}}, the quadratic form ''Q'' is determined by the symmetric part of the bilinear form ''B'' and is independent of the antisymmetric part.  In this case there is a one-to-one correspondence between the symmetric part of the bilinear form and the quadratic form, and it makes sense to speak of the symmetric bilinear form associated with a quadratic form.\n\nWhen {{nowrap|1=char(''K'') = 2}} and {{nowrap|dim ''V'' > 1}}, this correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms breaks down.\n\n==Reflexivity and orthogonality==\n: '''Definition:''' A bilinear form {{nowrap|''B'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''K''}} is called '''reflexive''' if {{nowrap|1=''B''('''v''', '''w''') = 0}} implies {{nowrap|1=''B''('''w''', '''v''') = 0}} for all '''v''', '''w''' in ''V''.\n: '''Definition:''' Let {{nowrap|''B'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''K''}} be a reflexive bilinear form. '''v''', '''w''' in ''V'' are '''orthogonal with respect to ''B''''' if {{nowrap|1=''B''('''v''', '''w''') = 0}}.\n\nA bilinear form ''B'' is reflexive if and only if it is either symmetric or alternating.{{sfn|Grove|1997}}  In the absence of reflexivity we have to distinguish left and right orthogonality. In a reflexive space the left and right radicals agree and are termed the ''kernel'' or the ''radical'' of the bilinear form: the subspace of all vectors orthogonal with every other vector.  A vector '''v''', with matrix representation ''x'', is in the radical of a bilinear form with matrix representation ''A'', if and only if {{nowrap|1=''Ax'' = 0 ⇔ ''x''<sup>T</sup>''A'' = 0}}. The radical is always a subspace of ''V''.  It is trivial if and only if the matrix ''A'' is nonsingular, and thus if and only if the bilinear form is nondegenerate.\n\nSuppose ''W'' is a subspace.  Define the ''[[orthogonal complement]]''{{sfn|Adkins|Weintraub|1992|page=359}}\n\n: <math>W^{\\perp}=\\{\\mathbf{v} \\mid B(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})=0\\ \\forall \\mathbf{w}\\in W\\} \\ . </math>\n\nFor a non-degenerate form on a finite dimensional space, the map {{nowrap|''V/W'' → ''W''<sup>⊥</sup>}} is bijective, and the dimension of ''W''<sup>⊥</sup> is {{nowrap|dim(''V'') − dim(''W'')}}.\n\n==Different spaces==\nMuch of the theory is available for a [[bilinear mapping]] from two vector spaces over the same base field to that field\n\n:''B'' : ''V'' × ''W'' → ''K''.\n\nHere we still have induced linear mappings from ''V'' to ''W''<sup>∗</sup>, and from ''W'' to ''V''<sup>∗</sup>. It may happen that these mappings are isomorphisms; assuming finite dimensions, if one is an isomorphism, the other must be. When this occurs, ''B'' is said to be a '''perfect pairing'''.\n\nIn finite dimensions, this is equivalent to the pairing being nondegenerate (the spaces necessarily having the same dimensions). For modules (instead of vector spaces), just as how a nondegenerate form is weaker than a unimodular form, a nondegenerate pairing is a weaker notion than a perfect pairing. A pairing can be nondegenerate without being a perfect pairing, for instance {{nowrap|'''Z''' × '''Z''' → '''Z'''}} via {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') ↦ 2''xy''}} is nondegenerate, but induces multiplication by 2 on the map {{nowrap|'''Z''' → '''Z'''<sup>∗</sup>}}.\n\nTerminology varies in coverage of bilinear forms. For example, F. Reese Harvey discusses \"eight types of inner product\".{{sfn|Harvey|1990|page=22}} To define them he uses diagonal matrices ''A<sub>ij</sub>'' having only +1 or −1 for non-zero elements. Some of the \"inner products\" are [[symplectic vector space|symplectic forms]] and some are [[sesquilinear form]]s or [[sesquilinear form#Hermitian form|Hermitian forms]]. Rather than a general field ''K'', the instances with real numbers '''R''', complex numbers '''C''', and [[quaternions]] '''H''' are spelled out. The bilinear form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^p x_k y_k - \\sum_{k=p+1}^n  x_k y_k </math>\n\nis called the '''real symmetric case''' and labeled {{nowrap|'''R'''(''p'', ''q'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''p'' + ''q'' = ''n''}}.  Then he articulates the connection to traditional terminology:{{sfn|Harvey|1990|page=23}}\n: Some of the real symmetric cases are very important. The positive definite case {{nowrap|'''R'''(''n'', 0)}} is called ''Euclidean space'', while the case of a single minus, {{nowrap|'''R'''(''n''−1, 1)}} is called ''Lorentzian space''. If {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, then Lorentzian space is also called ''[[Minkowski space]]'' or ''Minkowski spacetime''. The special case {{nowrap|'''R'''(''p'', ''p'')}} will be referred to as the ''split-case''.\n\n==Relation to tensor products==\nBy the [[universal property]] of the [[tensor product]], there is a canonical correspondence between bilinear forms on ''V'' and linear maps {{nowrap|''V'' ⊗ ''V'' → ''K''}}. If ''B'' is a bilinear form on ''V'' the corresponding linear map is given by\n: '''v''' ⊗ '''w''' ↦ ''B''('''v''', '''w''')\nIn the other direction, if {{nowrap|''F'' : ''V'' ⊗ ''V'' → ''K''}} is a linear map the corresponding bilinear form is given by composing ''F'' with the bilinear map {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V'' → ''V'' ⊗ ''V''}} that sends {{nowrap|('''v''', '''w''')}} to {{nowrap|'''v'''⊗'''w'''}}.\n\nThe set of all linear maps {{nowrap|''V'' ⊗ ''V'' → ''K''}} is the [[dual space]] of {{nowrap|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}}, so bilinear forms may be thought of as elements of {{nowrap|(''V'' ⊗ ''V'')<sup>∗</sup>}} which (when ''V'' is finite-dimensional) is canonically isomorphic to {{nowrap|''V''<sup>∗</sup> ⊗ ''V''<sup>∗</sup>}}.\n\nLikewise, symmetric bilinear forms may be thought of as elements of Sym<sup>2</sup>(''V''<sup>∗</sup>) (the second [[symmetric power]] of ''V''<sup>∗</sup>), and alternating bilinear forms as elements of Λ<sup>2</sup>''V''<sup>∗</sup> (the second [[exterior power]] of ''V''<sup>∗</sup>).\n\n==On normed vector spaces==\n'''Definition:''' A bilinear form on a [[normed vector space]]  {{nowrap|(''V'', ‖·‖)}} is '''bounded''', if there is a constant ''C'' such that for all {{nowrap|'''u''', '''v''' ∈ ''V''}},\n: <math> B ( \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v}) \\le C \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\|\\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\n'''Definition:''' A bilinear form on a normed vector space {{nowrap|(''V'', ‖·‖)}} is '''elliptic''', or [[Coercive_function#Coercive_operators_and_forms|coercive]], if there is a constant {{nowrap|''c'' > 0}} such that for all {{nowrap|'''u''' ∈ ''V''}},\n: <math> B ( \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{u}) \\ge c \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| ^2 .</math>\n\n==Generalization to modules==\nGiven a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' and a right [[Module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] ''M'' and its [[dual module]] ''M''<sup>∗</sup>, a mapping {{nowrap|''B'' : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> × ''M'' → ''R''}} is called a '''bilinear form''' if\n:''B''(''u'' + ''v'', ''x'') = ''B''(''u'', ''x'') + ''B''(''v'', ''x'')\n:''B''(''u'', ''x'' + ''y'') = ''B''(''u'', ''x'') + ''B''(''u'', ''y'')\n:''B''(''αu'', ''xβ'') = ''αB''(''u'', ''x'')''β''\nfor all {{nowrap|''u'', ''v'' ∈ ''M''<sup>∗</sup>}}, {{nowrap|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''M''}}, {{nowrap|''α'', ''β'' ∈ ''R''}}.\n\nThe mapping {{nowrap|{{langle}}&sdot;,&sdot;{{rangle}} : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> × ''M'' → ''R'' : (''u'', ''x'') ↦ ''u''(''x'')}} is known as the ''[[natural pairing]]'', also called the ''canonical bilinear form'' on {{nowrap|''M''<sup>∗</sup> × ''M''}}.{{sfn|Bourbaki|1970|page=233}}\n\nA linear map {{nowrap|''S'' : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> → ''M''<sup>∗</sup> : ''u'' ↦ ''S''(''u'')}} induces the bilinear form {{nowrap|''B'' : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> × ''M'' → ''R'' : (''u'', ''x'') ↦ {{langle}}''S''(''u''), ''x''{{rangle}}}}, and a linear map {{nowrap|''T'' : ''M'' → ''M'' : ''x'' ↦ ''T''(''x'')}} induces the bilinear form {{nowrap|''B'' : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> × ''M'' → ''R'' : (''u'', ''x'') ↦ {{langle}}''u'', ''T''(''x'')){{rangle}}}}.\n\nConversely, a bilinear form {{nowrap|''B'' : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> × ''M'' → ''R''}} induces the ''R''-linear maps {{nowrap|''S'' : ''M''<sup>∗</sup> → ''M''<sup>∗</sup> : ''u'' ↦ (''x'' ↦ ''B''(''u'', ''x''))}} and {{nowrap|''T''′ : ''M'' → ''M''<sup>∗∗</sup> : ''x'' ↦ (''u'' ↦ ''B''(''u'', ''x''))}}.

A matrix in Jordan normal form is an \"almost diagonal matrix,\" that is, as close to diagonal as possible.  A [[diagonal matrix]] <math>D</math> is a special case of a matrix in Jordan normal form.  An [[eigenvector|ordinary eigenvector]] is a special case of a generalized eigenvector.\n\nEvery ''n'' × ''n'' matrix <math>A</math> possesses ''n'' linearly independent generalized eigenvectors.  Generalized eigenvectors corresponding to distinct [[eigenvalues]] are linearly independent.

      "text": "{{ITALICTITLE}}\nIn [[algebra]], '''''casus irreducibilis''''' ([[Latin]] for \"the irreducible case\") is one of the cases that may arise in attempting to solve a [[cubic equation]] with [[integer]] coefficients with roots that are expressed with [[nth root|radicals]].  Specifically, if a cubic polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the [[rational numbers]] and has three [[real numbers|real]] roots, then in order to express the roots with radicals, one must introduce [[complex numbers|complex]]-valued expressions, even though the resulting expressions are ultimately real-valued. This was proven by [[Pierre Wantzel]] in 1843.<ref name =\"Wantzel\">{{Citation|last = Wantzel|first = Pierre|author-link = Pierre Wantzel|url = http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/NAM/NAM_1843_1_2_/NAM_1843_1_2__117_1/NAM_1843_1_2__117_1.pdf|title = Classification des nombres incommensurables d’origine algébrique|journal = [[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]]|year = 1843|volume = 2|pages = 117–127|language = french}}</ref>\n\nOne can decide whether a given irreducible cubic polynomial is in ''casus irreducibilis'' using the [[discriminant]] ''D'', via [[Cardano's formula]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2012}}, Theorem&nbsp;1.3.1, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> Let the cubic equation be given by\n\n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0.\\,</math>\n\nThen the discriminant {{math|''D''}} appearing in the algebraic solution is given by\n\n: <math> D = 18abcd -4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2. \\,</math>\n\n* If {{math|''D'' < 0}}, then the polynomial has two complex non-real roots, so ''casus irreducibilis'' does not apply.\n* If {{math|''D'' {{=}} 0}}, then there are three real roots, and two of them are equal and can be found by the [[Euclidean algorithm]], and by the [[quadratic formula]].  All roots are real and expressible by real radicals.  The polynomial is not irreducible.\n* If {{math|''D'' > 0}}, then there are three distinct real roots. Either a rational root exists and can be found using the [[rational root test]], in which case the cubic polynomial can be factored into the product of a linear polynomial and a quadratic polynomial, the latter of which can be solved via the quadratic formula; or no such factorization can occur, so the polynomial is ''casus irreducibilis'': all roots are real, but require complex numbers to express them in radicals.\n\n== Formal statement and proof ==\nMore generally, suppose that ''F'' is a [[formally real field]], and that ''p''(''x'') &isin; ''F''[''x''] is a cubic polynomial, irreducible over ''F'', but having three real roots (roots in the [[real closure]] of ''F'').  Then ''casus irreducibilis'' states that it is impossible to find any solution of ''p''(''x'')  = 0 by real radicals.\n\nTo prove this,<ref>B.L. van der Waerden, ''Modern Algebra'' (translated from German by Fred Blum), Frederick Ungar Publ. Co., 1949, p. 180.</ref>  note that the discriminant {{math|''D''}} is positive.  Form the [[field extension]] {{math|''F''({{sqrt|''D''}})}}.  Since this is {{math|''F''}} or a [[quadratic extension]] of {{math|''F''}} (depending in whether or not {{math|''D''}} is a square in {{math|''F''}}), {{math|''p''(''x'')}} remains irreducible in it.  Consequently, the [[Galois group]] of {{math|''p''(''x'')}} over {{math|''F''({{sqrt|''D''}})}} is the cyclic group {{math|''C''<sub>3</sub>}}.  Suppose that {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} can be solved by real radicals. Then {{math|''p''(''x'')}} can be split by a tower of [[cyclic extension]]s\n:<math> F\\sub F(\\sqrt{D})\\sub F(\\sqrt{D}, \\sqrt[p_1]{\\alpha_1}) \\sub\\cdots \\sub K\\sub K(\\sqrt[3]{\\alpha})</math>\n\nAt the final step of the tower, {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is irreducible in the penultimate field {{math|''K''}}, but splits in {{math|''K''({{radic|''α''|3}})}} for some {{math|''α''}}.  But this is a cyclic field extension, and so must contain a [[primitive root of unity]].\n\nHowever, there are no primitive 3rd roots of unity in a real closed field.  Suppose that &omega; is a primitive 3rd root of unity.  Then, by the axioms defining an [[ordered field]], &omega;, &omega;<sup>2</sup>, and 1 are all positive.  But if &omega;<sup>2</sup>>&omega;, then cubing both sides gives 1>1, a contradiction; similarly if &omega;>&omega;<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==Solution in non-real radicals==\n\n===Cardano's solution===\n\nThe equation  {{math|''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}} can be depressed to a [[monic polynomial|monic]] [[trinomial]] by dividing by <math>a</math> and substituting {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''t'' − {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}} (the [[Tschirnhaus transformation]]), giving the equation {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}} where\n:<math>p=\\frac{3ac-b^2}{3a^2}</math>\n:<math>q=\\frac{2b^3-9abc+27a^2d}{27a^3}.</math>\n\nThen  regardless of the number of real roots, by [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's solution]] the three roots are given by\n\n:<math> t_k = \\omega_k \\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}+ \\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}} + \\omega_k^2  \\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}- \\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}}</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\omega_k</math> (''k''=1, 2, 3) is a cube root of 1 (<math>\\omega_1 = 1</math>, <math>\\omega_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i</math>, and <math>\\omega_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i</math>, where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]]). Here if the [[radicand]]s under the cube roots are non-real, the cube roots expressed by radicals are defined to be any pair of complex conjugate cube roots, while if they are real these cube roots are defined to be the real cube roots.\n\n''Casus irreducibilis'' occurs when none of the roots is rational and when all three roots are distinct and real; the case of three distinct real roots occurs if and only if {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} < 0}}, in which case Cardano's formula involves first taking the square root of a negative number, which is [[Imaginary number|imaginary]], and then taking the cube root of a complex number (which cube root cannot itself be placed in the form {{math|''α'' + ''βi''}} with specifically given expressions in real [[nth root|radicals]] for {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}, since doing so would require independently solving the original cubic). Even in the reducible case in which one of three real roots is rational and hence can be factored out by [[polynomial long division]], Cardano's formula (unnecessarily in this case) expresses that root (and the others) in terms of non-real radicals.\n\n===Example===\n\nThe depressed cubic equation\n\n:<math>x^3-3x+1=0</math>\n\nis irreducible, because if it could be factored there would be a linear factor giving a rational solution, while by the [[rational root test]] there is no rational root. Since its discriminant is positive, it has three real roots, so it is an example of ''casus irreducibilis''. Cardano's formula gives these three real roots as \n\n:<math> t_k = \\omega_k \\sqrt[3]{-{1\\over 2}+ \\sqrt{{-3\\over 4}}}+ \\omega_k^2  \\sqrt[3]{-{1\\over 2}- \\sqrt{{-3\\over 4}}}</math>\n\nfor ''k''=1, 2, 3. This solution in radicals involves the [[imaginary number]] <math>\\sqrt{{-3\\over 4}}</math> and hence involves the cube roots of [[complex conjugate]] numbers.\n\n==Non-algebraic solution in terms of real quantities==\n\n{{Main|Cubic function#Trigonometric (and hyperbolic) method}}\n\nWhile ''casus irreducibilis'' cannot be [[Algebraic solution|solved in radicals]] in terms of real quantities, it ''can'' be solved [[Trigonometry|trigonometrically]] in terms of real quantities.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2012}}, Section 1.3B Trigonometric Solution of the Cubic, pp. 18–19.</ref> Specifically, the depressed monic cubic equation <math>t^3+pt+q=0 </math> is solved by\n\n:<math>t_k=2\\sqrt{-\\frac{p}{3}}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{3q}{2p}\\sqrt{\\frac{-3}{p}}\\right)-k\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k=0,1,2 \\,.</math>\n\nThese solutions are in terms of real quantities if and only if <math>{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27} < 0</math> — i.e., if and only if there are three real roots. The formula involves starting with an angle whose cosine is known, trisecting the angle by multiplying it by 1/3, and taking the cosine of the resulting angle and adjusting for scale.\n\n==Relation to angle trisection==\n\nThe distinction between the reducible and irreducible cubic cases with three real roots is related to the issue of whether or not an angle with rational cosine or rational sine is [[Angle trisection|trisectible]] by the classical means of [[compass and straightedge constructions|compass and unmarked straightedge]]. If the cosine of an angle {{math|''θ''}} is known to have a particular rational value, then one third of this angle has a cosine that is one of the three real roots of the equation\n\n:<math> 4x^3  - 3x - \\cos (\\theta) = 0.</math>\n\nLikewise, if the sine of {{math|''θ''}} is known to have a particular rational value, then one third of this angle has a sine that is one of the three real roots of the equation\n\n:<math> -4y^3 + 3y - \\sin (\\theta) = 0.</math>\n\nIn either case, if the rational root test reveals a rational root of the equation, {{mvar|x}} or {{mvar|y}} minus that root can be factored out of the polynomial on the left side, leaving a quadratic that can be solved for the remaining two roots in terms of a square root; then all of these roots are classically constructible since they are expressible in no higher than square roots, so in particular {{math|cos(&thinsp;{{frac|''θ''|3}})}} or {{math|sin(&thinsp;{{frac|''θ''|3}})}} is constructible and so is the associated angle {{math|{{frac|''θ''|3}}}}. On the other hand, if the rational root test shows that there is no rational root, then ''casus irreducibilis'' applies, {{math|cos(&thinsp;{{frac|''θ''|3}})}} or {{math|sin(&thinsp;{{frac|''θ''|3}})}} is not constructible, the angle {{math|{{frac|''θ''|3}}}} is not constructible, and the angle {{math|''θ''}} is not classically trisectible.\n\n==Relation to angle pentasection==\n\nThe distinction between the reducible and irreducible quintic cases with five real roots is related to the issue of whether or not an angle with rational cosine or rational sine is pentasectible by the classical means of [[compass and straightedge constructions|compass and unmarked straightedge]]. If the cosine of an angle {{math|''θ''}} is known to have a particular rational value, then one fifth of this angle has a cosine that is one of the five real roots of the equation\n\n:<math> 16x^5 - 20x^3  + 5x - \\cos (\\theta) = 0.</math>\n\nLikewise, if the sine of {{math|''θ''}} is known to have a particular rational value, then one fifth of this angle has a sine that is one of the five real roots of the equation\n\n:<math> 16x^5 - 20x^3  + 5x - \\sin (\\theta) = 0.</math>\n\nIn either case, if the rational root test shows that there is no rational root, then ''casus irreducibilis'' applies, {{math|cos(&thinsp;{{frac|''θ''|5}})}} or {{math|sin(&thinsp;{{frac|''θ''|5}})}} is not constructible, the angle {{math|{{frac|''θ''|5}}}} is not constructible, and the angle {{math|''θ''}} is not classically pentasectible.\n\nHe who pentasects {{math|''5θ''}}, also pentasects {{math|''450° - 5θ''}} and finds {{math|''θ + k ; k &isin; { 0°, 54°, 72°, 126°, 144°, 198°, 216°, 270°, 288°, 342° }''}} too. <ref>FERRAZ, Vinicius C. Trisection, pentasection and n-section for any natural n. [https://claudino.webs.com/math/trisection.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Generalization==\n''Casus irreducibilis'' can be generalized to higher degree polynomials as follows. Let ''p''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''F''[''x''] be an irreducible polynomial which splits in a formally real extension ''R'' of ''F'' (i.e., ''p'' has only real roots). Assume that ''p'' has a root in <math>K\\subseteq R</math> which is an extension of ''F'' by radicals. Then the degree of ''p'' is a power of 2, and its splitting field is an iterated quadratic extension of ''F''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2012}}, Theorem 8.6.5, p.&nbsp;222.</ref><ref name=Isaacs>I. M. Isaacs, \"Solution of polynomials by real radicals\", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' 92 (8), October 1985, 571–575,</ref>{{rp| pp. 571–572}}\n\nThus for any irreducible polynomial whose degree is not a power of 2 and which has all roots real, no root can be expressed purely in terms of real radicals. Moreover, if the polynomial degree ''is'' a power of 2 and the roots are all real, then if there is a root that can be expressed in real radicals it can be expressed in terms of square roots and no higher-degree roots, as can the other roots, and so the roots are [[constructible number|classically constructible]].\n\n''Casus irreducibilis'' for [[Quintic function|quintic polynomials]] is discussed by Dummit.<ref>David S.

Co., {{ISBN|978-0-201-55540-0}}, {{Zbl|0848.13001}}</ref>  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.\n\nIt is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the {{em|preceding}} term. For instance, in the sequence of square roots of natural numbers:\n:<math>a_n=\\sqrt n,</math>\nthe consecutive terms become arbitrarily close to each other:\n:<math>a_{n+1}-a_n = \\sqrt{n+1}-\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n+1}+\\sqrt{n}} < \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt n}.</math>\nHowever, with growing values of the index {{mvar|n}}, the terms {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} become arbitrarily large, so for any index {{mvar|n}} and distance {{mvar|d}}, there exists an index {{mvar|m}} big enough such that {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub> – ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> > ''d''}}. (Actually, any {{math|''m'' > ({{sqrt|''n''}} + ''d'')<sup>2</sup>}} suffices.) As a result, despite how far one goes, the remaining terms of the sequence never get close to {{em|each other}}, hence the sequence is not Cauchy.\n\nThe utility of Cauchy sequences lies in the fact that in a [[complete metric space]] (one where all such sequences are known to [[limit of a sequence|converge to a limit]]), the criterion for [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] depends only on the terms of the sequence itself, as opposed to the definition of convergence, which uses the limit value as well as the terms. This is often exploited in [[algorithm]]s, both theoretical and applied,  where an [[Iterative method|iterative process]] can be shown relatively easily to produce a Cauchy sequence, consisting of the iterates, thus fulfilling a logical condition, such as termination.\n\nThe notions above are not as unfamiliar as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance of the fact that any [[real number]] ''x'' has a [[decimal expansion]] is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive [[truncation]]s of the decimal expansion of ''x'') has the real limit ''x''. In some cases it may be difficult to describe ''x'' independently of such a limiting process involving [[rational number]]s.\n\nGeneralizations of Cauchy sequences in more abstract [[uniform spaces]] exist in the form of [[Cauchy filter]]s and [[Cauchy net]]s.\n\n==In real numbers==\nA sequence\n\n:<math>x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots </math>\n\nof real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence if for every [[positive and negative numbers|positive]] real number ''ε'', there is a positive [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all [[natural numbers]] ''m'', ''n'' > ''N''\n\n:<math>|x_m - x_n| < \\varepsilon, </math>\n\nwhere the vertical bars denote the [[absolute value]].  In a similar way one can define Cauchy sequences of rational or complex numbers.  Cauchy formulated such a condition by requiring <math>x_m - x_n</math> to be [[infinitesimal]] for every pair of infinite ''m'', ''n''.\n\n==In a metric space==\n\nSince the definition of a Cauchy sequence only involves metric concepts, it is straightforward to generalize it to any metric space ''X''. To do so, the absolute value |''x''<sub>''m''</sub> - ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>| is replaced by the distance ''d''(''x''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) (where ''d'' denotes a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) between ''x''<sub>''m''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nFormally, given a [[metric space]] (''X'', ''d''), a sequence\n\n:''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ...\n\nis Cauchy, if for every positive [[real number]] ''ε'' > 0 there is a positive  [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all positive integers ''m'', ''n'' > ''N'', the distance\n\n:''d''(''x''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) < ''ε''.\n\nRoughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to have a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] in ''X''. Nonetheless, such a limit does not always exist within ''X'': the property of a space that every Cauchy sequence converges in the space is called ''completeness'', and is detailed below.\n\n==Completeness==\nA metric space (''X'', ''d'') in which every Cauchy sequence converges to an element of ''X'' is called [[Complete metric space|complete]].\n\n===Examples===\nThe [[real number]]s are complete under the metric induced by the usual absolute value, and one of the standard [[Construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] involves Cauchy sequences of [[rational number]]s. In this construction, each equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers with a certain tail behavior—that is, each class of sequences that get arbitrarily close to one another— is a real number.\n\nA rather different type of example is afforded by a metric space ''X'' which has the [[discrete space|discrete metric]] (where any two distinct  points are at distance 1 from each other). Any Cauchy sequence of elements of ''X'' must be constant beyond some fixed point, and converges to the eventually repeating term.\n\n===Counter-example: rational numbers===\nThe [[rational number]]s '''Q''' are not complete (for the usual distance):<br/>\nThere are sequences of rationals that converge (in '''R''') to [[irrational number]]s; these are Cauchy sequences having no limit in '''Q'''. In fact, if a real number ''x'' is irrational, then the sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), whose ''n''-th term is the truncation to ''n'' decimal places of the decimal expansion of ''x'', gives a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers with irrational limit ''x''. Irrational numbers certainly exist in '''R''', for example:\n\n* The sequence defined by <math> x_0=1, x_{n+1}=\\frac{x_n+\\frac{2}{x_n}}{2}</math> consists of rational numbers (1, 3/2, 17/12,...), which is clear from the definition; however it converges to the [[irrational number|irrational]] square root of two, see [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|Babylonian method of computing square root]].\n* The sequence <math>x_n = F_n / F_{n-1}</math> of ratios of consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s which, if it converges at all, converges to a limit <math>\\phi</math> satisfying <math>\\phi^2 = \\phi+1</math>, and no rational number has this property.  If one considers this as a sequence of real numbers, however, it converges to the real number <math>\\varphi = (1+\\sqrt5)/2</math>, the [[Golden ratio]], which is irrational.\n* The values of the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(''x''), sin(''x''), cos(''x''), are known to be irrational for any rational value of ''x''≠0, but each can be defined as the limit of a rational Cauchy sequence, using, for instance, the [[Maclaurin series]].\n\n===Counter-example: open interval===\nThe open interval <math> X = (0, 2) </math> in the set of real numbers with an ordinary distance in '''R''' is not a complete space: there is a sequence <math> x_n = 1/n </math> in it, which is Cauchy (for arbitrarily small distance bound <math> d > 0 </math> all terms <math> x_n </math> of <math> n > 1/d </math> fit in the <math> (0, d) </math> interval), however does not converge in <math> X </math> — its 'limit', number <math> 0 </math>, does not belong to the space <math> X </math>.\n\n===Other properties===\n* Every convergent sequence (with limit ''s'', say) is a Cauchy sequence, since, given any real number ''ε'' > 0, beyond some fixed point, every term of the sequence is within distance ''ε''/2 of ''s'', so any two terms of the sequence are within distance ''ε'' of each other.\n* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is [[bounded function|bounded]] (since for some ''N'', all terms of the sequence from the ''N''-th onwards are within distance 1 of each other, and if ''M'' is the largest distance between {{math|''x''<sub>''N''</sub>}} and any terms up to the ''N''-th, then no term of the sequence has distance greater than {{math|''M'' + 1}} from {{math|''x<sub>N</sub>''}}).\n* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence with limit ''s'' is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number ''r'' > 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance ''r''/2 of ''s'', and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance ''r''/2 of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance ''r'' of ''s''.\n\nThese last two properties, together with the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. This proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the [[least upper bound axiom]]. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of {{em|constructing}} the real numbers as the [[Completion (metric space)|completion]] of the rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.\n\nOne of the standard illustrations of the advantage of being able to work with Cauchy sequences and make use of completeness is provided by consideration of the summation of an [[infinite series]] of real numbers\n(or, more generally, of elements of any complete [[normed linear space]], or [[Banach space]]).  Such a series \n<math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_{n}</math> is considered to be convergent if and only if the sequence of [[partial sum]]s <math>(s_{m})</math> is convergent, where \n<math> s_{m} = \\sum_{n=1}^{m} x_{n}</math>. It is a routine matter \nto determine whether the sequence of partial sums is Cauchy or not,\nsince for positive integers ''p'' > ''q'', \n:<math> s_{p} - s_{q} = \\sum_{n=q+1}^{p} x_{n}.</math>\n\nIf <math>f \\colon M \\rightarrow N</math> is a [[uniformly continuous]] map between the metric spaces ''M'' and ''N'' and (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a Cauchy sequence in ''M'', then <math>(f(x_n))</math> is a Cauchy sequence in ''N''. If <math>(x_n)</math> and <math>(y_n)</math> are two Cauchy sequences in the rational, real or complex numbers, then the sum <math>(x_n + y_n)</math> and the product <math>(x_n y_n)</math> are also Cauchy sequences.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===In topological vector spaces===\nThere is also a concept of Cauchy sequence for a [[topological vector space]] <math>X</math>: Pick a [[local base]] <math>B</math> for <math>X</math> about 0; then (<math>x_k</math>) is a Cauchy sequence if for each member <math>V\\in B</math>, there is some number <math>N</math> such that whenever \n<math>n,m > N, \nx_n - x_m</math> is an element of <math>V</math>. If the topology of <math>X</math> is compatible with a [[translation-invariant metric]] <math>d</math>, the two definitions agree.\n\n===In topological groups===\n\nSince the topological vector space definition of Cauchy sequence requires only that there be a continuous \"subtraction\" operation, it can just as well be stated in the context of a [[topological group]]: A sequence <math>(x_k)</math> in a topological group <math>G</math> is a Cauchy sequence if for every open neighbourhood <math>U</math> of the [[identity element|identity]] in <math>G</math> there exists some number <math>N</math> such that whenever <math> m,n>N </math> it follows that <math>x_n x_m^{-1} \\in U</math>. As above, it is sufficient to check this for the neighbourhoods in any local base of the identity in <math>G</math>.\n\nAs in the [[Complete metric space#Completion|construction of the completion of a metric space]], one can furthermore define the binary relation on Cauchy sequences in <math>G</math> that <math>(x_k)</math> and <math>(y_k)</math> are equivalent if for every open [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] <math>U</math> of the identity in <math>G</math> there exists some number <math>N</math> such that whenever <math> m,n>N </math> it follows that <math>x_n y_m^{-1} \\in U</math>. This relation is an [[equivalence relation]]: It is reflexive since the sequences are Cauchy sequences. It is symmetric since <math>y_n x_m^{-1} = (x_m y_n^{-1})^{-1} \\in U^{-1}</math> which by continuity of the inverse is another open neighbourhood of the identity. It is [[Transitive relation|transitive]] since <math>x_n z_l^{-1} = x_n y_m^{-1} y_m z_l^{-1} \\in U' U''</math> where <math>U'</math> and <math>U''</math> are open neighbourhoods of the identity such that <math>U'U'' \\subseteq U</math>; such pairs exist by the continuity of the group operation.\n\n===In groups===\n\nThere is also a concept of Cauchy sequence in a group <math>G</math>:\nLet <math>H=(H_r)</math> be a decreasing sequence of [[normal subgroup]]s of <math>G</math> of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].\nThen a sequence <math>(x_n)</math> in <math>G</math> is said to be Cauchy (w.r.t. <math>H</math>) [[if and only if]] for any <math>r</math> there is <math>N</math> such that <math>\\forall m,n > N, x_n x_m^{-1} \\in H_r</math>.\n\nTechnically, this is the same thing as a topological group Cauchy sequence for a particular choice of topology on <math>G</math>, namely that for which <math>H</math> is a local base.\n\nThe set <math>C</math> of such Cauchy sequences forms a group (for the componentwise product), and the set <math>C_0</math> of null sequences (s.th. <math>\\forall r, \\exists N, \\forall n > N, x_n \\in H_r</math>) is a normal subgroup of <math>C</math>. The [[factor group]] <math>C/C_0</math> is called the completion of <math>G</math> with respect to <math>H</math>.\n\nOne can then show that this completion is isomorphic to the [[inverse limit]] of the sequence <math>(G/H_r)</math>.\n\nAn example of this construction, familiar in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] is the construction of the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic completion]] of the integers with respect to a prime ''p''. In this case, ''G'' is the integers under addition, and ''H''<sub>''r''</sub> is the additive subgroup consisting of integer multiples of ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>.\n\nIf <math>H</math> is a [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] sequence (i.e., any normal subgroup of finite index contains some <math>H_r</math>), then this completion is [[Canonical form|canonical]] in the sense that it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of <math>(G/H)_H</math>, where <math>H</math> varies over {{em|all}} normal subgroups of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]]. For further details, see ch. I.10 in [[Serge Lang|Lang]]'s \"Algebra\".\n\n===In constructive mathematics===\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2018}}\nIn [[constructive mathematics]], Cauchy sequences often must be given with a ''modulus of Cauchy convergence'' to be useful. If <math>(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)</math> is a Cauchy sequence in the set <math>X</math>, then a modulus of Cauchy convergence for the sequence is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>\\alpha</math> from the set of [[natural number]]s to itself, such that <math>\\forall k \\forall m, n > \\alpha(k), |x_m - x_n| < 1/k</math>.\n\nClearly, any sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse (that every Cauchy sequence has a modulus) follows from the [[well-ordering property]] of the natural numbers (let <math>\\alpha(k)</math> be the smallest possible <math>N</math> in the definition of Cauchy sequence, taking <math>r</math> to be <math>1/k</math>). However, this well-ordering property does not hold in constructive mathematics (it is equivalent to the principle of [[excluded middle]]). On the other hand, this converse also follows (directly) from the principle of [[dependent choice]] (in fact, it will follow from the weaker AC<sub>00</sub>), which is generally accepted by constructive mathematicians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Thus, moduli of Cauchy convergence are needed directly only by constructive mathematicians who (like [[Fred Richman]]) do not wish to use any form of choice.\n\nThat said, using a modulus of Cauchy convergence can simplify both definitions and theorems in constructive analysis. Perhaps even more useful are ''regular Cauchy sequences'', sequences with a given modulus of Cauchy convergence (usually <math>\\alpha(k) = k</math> or <math>\\alpha(k) = 2^k</math>). Any Cauchy sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is equivalent (in the sense used to form the [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of a metric space) to a regular Cauchy sequence; this can be proved without using any form of the axiom of choice. Regular Cauchy sequences were used by [[Errett Bishop]] in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7I-AAAAIAAJ&dq=intitle:Foundations+intitle:of+intitle:constructive+intitle:analysis&lr=&as_brr=0&pgis=1 Foundations of Constructive Analysis], but they have also been used by [[Douglas Bridges]] in a non-constructive textbook ({{ISBN|978-0-387-98239-7}}). However, Bridges also works on mathematical constructivism; the concept has not spread far outside of that milieu.\n\n===In a hyperreal continuum===\nA real sequence <math>\\langle u_n: n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle</math> has a natural [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension, defined for [[hypernatural]] values ''H'' of the index ''n'' in addition to the usual natural ''n''.  The sequence is Cauchy if and only if for every infinite ''H'' and ''K'', the values <math>u_H</math> and <math>u_K</math> are infinitely close, or [[adequality|adequal]], i.e. \n:<math>\\, \\mathrm{st}(u_H-u_K)= 0</math> \nwhere \"st\" is the [[standard part function]].\n\n===Cauchy completion of categories===\n\n{{harvtxt|Krause|2018}} introduced a notion of Cauchy completion of a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Applied to '''Q''' (the category whose objects are rational numbers, and there is a morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &le; ''y''), this Cauchy completion yields '''R''' (again interpreted as a category using its natural ordering).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modes of convergence (annotated index)]]\n*[[Dedekind cut]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki | author=Bourbaki, Nicolas | title=Commutative Algebra | edition = English translation| publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=1972 | isbn=0-201-00644-8}}\n* {{Citation|title=Completing perfect complexes: With appendices by Tobias Barthel and Bernhard Keller| author1=Krause|first1=Henning| arxiv=1805.10751|year=2018|bibcode=2018arXiv180510751B}}\n* {{Lang Algebra|edition=3}}\n*{{cite book | last = Spivak | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Spivak | title = Calculus | year = 1994 | edition = 3rd | location = Berkeley, CA | publisher = Publish or Perish | isbn = 0-914098-89-6 | url = http://www.mathpop.com/bookhtms/cal.htm | access-date = 2007-05-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070517171054/http://www.mathpop.com/bookhtms/cal.htm | archive-date = 2007-05-17 | dead-url = yes }}\n* {{cite book | last = Troelstra | first = A.

The centralizer and normalizer of ''S'' are [[subgroup]]s of ''G'', and can provide insight into the structure of ''G''.\n\nThe definitions also apply to [[monoid]]s and [[semigroup]]s.\n\nIn [[ring theory]], the '''centralizer of a subset of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]''' is defined with respect to the semigroup (multiplication) operation of the ring. The centralizer of a subset of a ring ''R'' is a [[subring]] of ''R''. This article also deals with centralizers and normalizers in [[Lie algebra]].\n\nThe [[idealizer]] in a semigroup or ring is another construction that is in the same vein as the centralizer and normalizer.\n\n==Definitions==\n===Group and semigroup===\nThe '''centralizer''' of a subset ''S'' of group (or semigroup) ''G'' is defined to be<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 41</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{C}_G(S)=\\{g\\in G\\mid gs=sg \\text{ for all } s\\in S\\}.</math>\n\nSometimes if there is no ambiguity about the group in question, the ''G'' is suppressed from the notation entirely. When ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a''} is a singleton set, then C<sub>''G''</sub>({''a''}) can be abbreviated to C<sub>''G''</sub>(''a''). Another less common notation for the centralizer is Z(''a''), which parallels the notation for the [[center of a group]].  With this latter notation, one must be careful to avoid confusion between the center of a group ''G'', Z(''G''), and the ''centralizer'' of an ''element'' ''g'' in ''G'', given by Z(''g'').\n\nThe '''normalizer''' of ''S'' in the group (or semigroup) ''G'' is defined to be\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{N}_G(S)=\\{ g \\in G \\mid gS=Sg \\}.</math>\n\nThe definitions are similar but not identical. If ''g'' is in the centralizer of ''S'' and ''s'' is in ''S'', then it must be that {{nowrap|1=''gs'' = ''sg''}}, but if ''g'' is in the normalizer, then {{nowrap|1=''gs'' = ''tg''}} for some ''t'' in ''S'', with ''t'' potentially different from ''s''. That is, elements of the centralizer of ''S'' must commute pointwise with ''S'', but elements of the normalizer of ''S'' need only commute with ''S as a set''. The same conventions mentioned previously about suppressing ''G'' and suppressing braces from singleton sets also apply to the normalizer notation. The normalizer should not be confused with the [[conjugate closure|normal closure]].\n\n===Ring, algebra over a field, Lie ring, and Lie algebra===\nIf ''R'' is a ring or an [[algebra over a field]], and ''S'' is a subset of ''R'', then the centralizer of ''S'' is exactly as defined for groups, with ''R'' in the place of ''G''.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math> is a [[Lie algebra]] (or [[Lie ring]]) with Lie product [''x'',''y''], then the centralizer of a subset ''S'' of <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math> is defined to be{{sfn|Jacobson|1979|loc=p.28}}\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathfrak{L}}(S)=\\{ x \\in \\mathfrak{L} \\mid [x,s]=0 \\text{ for all } s\\in S \\}.</math>\nThe definition of centralizers for Lie rings is linked to the definition for rings in the following way. If ''R'' is an associative ring, then ''R'' can be given the [[commutator#(ring theory)|bracket product]] {{nowrap|1=[''x'',''y''] = ''xy'' − ''yx''}}. Of course then {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''yx''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=[''x'',''y''] = 0}}. If we denote the set ''R'' with the bracket product as L<sub>''R''</sub>, then clearly the ''ring centralizer'' of ''S'' in ''R'' is equal to the ''Lie ring centralizer'' of ''S''  in L<sub>''R''</sub>.\n\nThe normalizer of a subset ''S'' of a Lie algebra (or Lie ring) <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math> is given by{{sfn|Jacobson|1979|loc=p.28}}\n:<math>\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathfrak{L}}(S)=\\{ x \\in \\mathfrak{L} \\mid [x,s]\\in S \\text{ for all } s\\in S \\}.</math>\nWhile this is the standard usage of the term \"normalizer\" in Lie algebra, this construction is actually the [[idealizer]] of the set ''S'' in <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math>.

      "text": "{{Other uses|Closure (disambiguation)}}\nA [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is '''closed''' under an [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces a member of that set. For example, the positive [[integers]] are closed under addition, but not under subtraction: <math>1 - 2</math> is not a positive integer even though both 1 and 2 are positive integers. Another example is the set containing only zero, which is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication (because <math>0+0=0</math>, <math>0-0=0</math>, and <math>0\\times{0}=0</math>).\n\nSimilarly, a set is said to be '''closed under a ''collection'' of operations''' if it is closed under each of the operations individually.\n\n==Basic properties==\nA set that is closed under an operation or collection of operations is said to satisfy a '''closure property'''. Often a closure property is introduced as an [[axiom]], which is then usually called the '''axiom of closure'''.  Modern set-theoretic definitions usually define operations as maps between sets, so adding closure to a structure as an axiom is superfluous; however in practice operations are often defined initially on a superset of the set in question and a closure proof is required to establish that the operation applied to pairs from that set only produces members of that set. For example, the set of even integers is closed under addition, but the set of odd integers is not.\n\nWhen a set ''S'' is not closed under some operations, one can usually find the smallest set containing ''S'' that is closed.  This smallest closed set is called the '''closure''' of ''S'' (with respect to these operations).  For example, the closure under subtraction of the set of natural numbers, viewed as a subset of the real numbers, is the set of [[integers]].  An important example is that of [[topological closure]]. The notion of closure is generalized by [[Galois connection]], and further by [[monad (category theory)|monad]]s.\n\nThe set ''S'' must be a subset of a closed set in order for the closure operator to be defined.  In the preceding example, it is important that the reals are closed under subtraction; in the domain of the natural numbers subtraction is not always defined.\n\nThe two uses of the word \"closure\" should not be confused.  The former usage refers to the property of being closed, and the latter refers to the smallest closed set containing one that may not be closed.  In short, the closure of a set satisfies a closure property.\n\n==Closed sets==\nA set is closed under an operation if the operation returns a member of the set when evaluated on members of the set.  Sometimes the requirement that the operation be valued in a set is explicitly stated, in which case it is known as the '''axiom of closure'''.  For example, one may define a [[group (mathematics)|group]] as a set with a binary product operator obeying several axioms, including an axiom that the product of any two elements of the group is again an element.  However the modern definition of an operation makes this axiom superfluous; an [[arity|''n''-ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] on ''S'' is just a subset of ''S''<sup>''n''+1</sup>.  By its very definition, an operator on a set cannot have values outside the set.\n\nNevertheless, the closure property of an operator on a set still has some utility.  Closure on a set does not necessarily imply closure on all subsets.  Thus a [[subgroup]] of a group is a subset on which the binary product and the [[unary operation]] of [[inverse element|inversion]] satisfy the closure axiom.\n\nAn operation of a different sort is that of finding the [[limit point]]s of a subset of a [[topological space]].  A set that is closed under this operation is usually referred to as a [[closed set]] in the context of [[topology]].  Without any further qualification, the phrase usually means closed in this sense.   [[Closed interval]]s like [1,2] = {''x'' : 1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 2} are closed in this sense.\n\nA subset of a partially ordered set is a '''downward closed set''' (also called a [[upper set|lower set]]) if for every element of the subset, all smaller elements are also in the subset. This applies for example to the real intervals (&minus;∞,&nbsp;''p'') and (&minus;∞,&nbsp;''p''], and for an [[ordinal number]] ''p'' represented as interval [0,&nbsp;''p''). Every downward closed set of ordinal numbers is itself an ordinal number. '''Upward closed sets''' (also called upper sets) are defined similarly.\n\n==Examples==\n* In [[topology]] and related branches, the relevant operation is taking limits.  The [[topological closure]] of a set is the corresponding closure operator.  The [[Kuratowski closure axioms]] characterize this operator.\n* In [[linear algebra]], the [[linear span]] of a set ''X'' of vectors is the '''closure''' of that set; it is the smallest subset of the [[vector space]] that includes ''X'' and is closed under the operation of [[linear combination]].  This subset is a [[linear subspace|subspace]].\n* In [[matroid]] theory, the closure of ''X'' is the largest superset of ''X'' that has the same rank as ''X''.\n* In [[set theory]], the [[Transitive_set#Transitive_closure|transitive closure]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]].\n* In [[set theory]], the [[transitive closure]] of a [[binary relation]].\n* In [[abstract algebra|algebra]], the [[algebraic closure]] of a [[field (algebra)|field]].\n* In [[commutative algebra]], closure operations for ideals, as [[integral closure]] and [[tight closure]].\n* In [[geometry]], the [[convex hull]] of a set ''S'' of points is the smallest [[convex set]] of which ''S'' is a [[subset]].\n* In [[formal language]]s, the [[Kleene closure]] of a language can be described as the set of strings that can be made by concatenating zero or more strings from that language.\n* In [[group theory]], the [[conjugate closure]] or normal closure of a set of [[group (mathematics)|group]] elements is the smallest normal subgroup containing the set.\n* In [[mathematical analysis]] and in [[probability theory]], the closure of a collection of subsets of ''X'' under [[countable|countably many]] [[algebra of sets|set operations]] is called the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by the collection.\n\n==Closure operator==\n:{{Main|closure operator}}\nGiven an operation on a set ''X'', one can define the closure ''C''(''S'') of a subset ''S'' of ''X'' to be the smallest subset closed under that operation that contains ''S'' as a subset, if any such subsets exist.  Consequently, ''C''(''S'') is the intersection of all closed sets containing ''S''. For example, the closure of a subset of a group is the subgroup [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by that set.\n\nThe closure of sets with respect to some operation defines a '''closure operator''' on the subsets of ''X''.  The closed sets can be determined from the closure operator; a set is closed if it is equal to its own closure.  Typical structural properties of all closure operations are: <ref>{{cite book |last=Birkhoff |first=Garrett |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |date=1967 |title=Lattice Theory |volume=25 |publisher=Am. Math. Soc. |series=Colloquium Publications |page=111}}</ref>\n\n*The closure is '''increasing''' or '''extensive''': the closure of an object contains the object.\n*The closure is '''[[idempotent]]''': the closure of the closure equals the closure.\n*The closure is '''monotone''', that is, if ''X'' is contained in ''Y'', then also ''C''(''X'') is contained in ''C''(''Y'').\n\nAn object that is its own closure is called '''closed'''.  By idempotency, an object is closed [[if and only if]] it is the closure of some object.\n\nThese three properties define an '''abstract closure operator'''.  Typically, an abstract closure acts on the class of all subsets of a set.\n\nIf ''X'' is contained in a set closed under the operation then every subset of ''X'' has a closure.\n\n==Binary relation closures==\nConsider first [[homogeneous relation]]s ''R'' ⊆ ''A'' × ''A''. If a relation ''S'' satisfies ''aSb'' ⇒ ''bSa'', then it is a [[symmetric relation]]. An arbitrary homogeneous relation ''R'' may not be symmetric but it is always contained in some symmetric relation: ''R'' ⊆ ''S''. The operation of finding the ''smallest'' such ''S'' corresponds to a closure operator called [[symmetric closure]].\n\nA [[transitive relation]] ''T'' satisfies ''aTb'' ∧ ''bTc'' ⇒ ''aTc''. An arbitrary homogeneous relation ''R'' may not be transitive but it is always contained in some transitive relation: ''R'' ⊆ ''T''. The operation of finding the ''smallest'' such ''T'' corresponds to a closure operator called [[transitive closure]].\n\nAmong [[heterogeneous relation]]s there are properties of ''difunctionality'' and ''contact'' which lead to '''difunctional closure''' and '''contact closure'''.<ref>[[Gunther Schmidt]] (2011) ''Relational Mathematics'', pages 169 and 227, Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications, vol. 132, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-521-76268-7}}</ref> The presence of these closure operators in binary relations leads to [[topology]] since open-set axioms may be replaced by [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]. Thus each property ''P'', symmetry, transitivity, difunctionality, or contact corresponds to a relational topology.<ref>Gunter Schmidt and M. Winter (2018) ''Relational Topology'', [[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]] vol. 2208, Springer Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-319-74451-3}}</ref> \n\nIn the theory of [[rewriting]] systems, one often uses more wordy notions such as the '''reflexive transitive closure''' ''R<sup>*</sup>''&mdash;the smallest [[preorder]] containing ''R'', or the '''reflexive transitive symmetric closure''' ''R''<sup>≡</sup>&mdash;the [[Equivalence_relation#Comparing_equivalence_relations|smallest equivalence relation]] containing ''R'', and therefore also known as the '''equivalence closure'''. When considering a particular [[term algebra]], an equivalence relation that is compatible with all operations of the algebra <ref group=note>that is, such that e.g. ''xRy'' implies ''f''(''x'',''x''<sub>2</sub>) ''R'' ''f''(''y'',''x''<sub>2</sub>) and ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x'') ''R'' ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,''y'') for any binary operation ''f'' and arbitrary ''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''S''</ref> is called a [[Congruence relation#Universal algebra|congruence relation]]. The '''congruence closure''' of ''R'' is defined as the smallest congruence relation containing ''R''.\n\nFor arbitrary ''P'' and ''R'', the ''P'' closure of ''R'' need not exist. In the above examples, these exist because reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry are closed under arbitrary intersections. In such cases, the ''P'' closure can be directly defined as the intersection of all sets with property ''P'' containing ''R''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baader |first1=Franz |authorlink1=Franz Baader |last2=Nipkow |first2=Tobias |authorlink2=Tobias Nipkow |date=1998 |title=Term Rewriting and All That |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=8–9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7BvXVUCQk8C&q=closure#v=snippet&q=closure&f=false}}</ref>\n\nSome important particular closures can be constructively obtained as follows:\n* ''cl''<sub>ref</sub>(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''x'',''x''⟩ : ''x'' ∈ ''S'' } is the [[reflexive closure]] of ''R'',\n* ''cl''<sub>sym</sub>(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''y'',''x''⟩ : ⟨''x'',''y''⟩ ∈ ''R'' } is its symmetric closure,\n* ''cl''<sub>trn</sub>(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>⟩ : ''n'' >1 ∧ ⟨''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>⟩, ..., ⟨''x''<sub>''n''-1</sub>,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>⟩ ∈ ''R'' } is its [[transitive closure]],\n* ''cl''<sub>emb,Σ</sub>(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,…,''x''<sub>''i''-1</sub>,''x''<sub>''i''</sub>,''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>,…,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,…,''x''<sub>''i''-1</sub>,''y'',''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>,…,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)⟩ : ⟨''x''<sub>''i''</sub>,''y''⟩ ∈ ''R'' ∧ ''f'' ∈ Σ ''n''-ary ∧ 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'' ∧ ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub> ∈ ''S'' } is its embedding closure with respect to a given set Σ of operations on ''S'', each with a fixed arity.\nThe relation ''R'' is said to have closure under some ''cl''<sub>xxx</sub>, if ''R'' = ''cl''<sub>xxx</sub>(''R''); for example ''R'' is called symmetric if ''R'' = ''cl''<sub>sym</sub>(''R'').\n\nAny of these four closures preserves symmetry, i.e., if ''R'' is symmetric, so is any ''cl''<sub>xxx</sub>(''R''). <ref group=note>formally: if ''R'' = ''cl''<sub>sym</sub>(''R''), then ''cl''<sub>xxx</sub>(''R'') = ''cl''<sub>sym</sub>(''cl''<sub>xxx</sub>(''R''))</ref>\nSimilarly, all four preserve reflexivity.\nMoreover, ''cl''<sub>trn</sub> preserves closure under ''cl''<sub>emb,Σ</sub> for arbitrary Σ.\nAs a consequence, the equivalence closure of an arbitrary binary relation ''R'' can be obtained as ''cl''<sub>trn</sub>(''cl''<sub>sym</sub>(''cl''<sub>ref</sub>(''R''))), and the congruence closure with respect to some Σ can be obtained as ''cl''<sub>trn</sub>(''cl''<sub>emb,Σ</sub>(''cl''<sub>sym</sub>(''cl''<sub>ref</sub>(''R'')))).

Thus, two strings in ''C'' are added by adding the bits in the strings [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&nbsp;2 (that is, addition without carry, or [[exclusive disjunction]]).  The [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' letters, <math>\\text{Sym}(n)</math>, acts on <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2^n</math> by bit permutation:\n:::<math>p((c_1, \\ldots, c_n)) = (c_{p(1)}, \\ldots, c_{p(n)}),</math>\nwhere <math>c = (c_1, \\ldots, c_n)</math> is an element of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2^n</math> and ''p'' is an element of <math>\\text{Sym}(n)</math>.   Closure ''with a twist'' now means that for each element ''c'' in ''C'', there exists some [[permutation]] <math>p_c</math> such that, when you add ''c'' to an arbitrary element ''e'' in the cwatset and then apply the permutation, the result will also be an element of ''C''. That is, denoting addition without carry by&nbsp;<math>+</math>, ''C'' will be a cwatset [[if and only if]]\n:::<math>\\forall c\\in C : \\exists p_c\\in \\text{Sym}(n) : \\forall e\\in C : p_c(e+c) \\in C.</math>\nThis condition can also be written as\n:::<math>\\forall c\\in C : \\exists p_c\\in \\text{Sym}(n) : p_c(C+c)=C.</math>\n\n===Examples===\n\n*All [[subgroup]]s of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2^n</math> &mdash; that is, nonempty subsets of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2^n</math> which are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition-without-carry &mdash; are trivially cwatsets, since we can choose each permutation ''p''<sub>''c''</sub> to be the identity permutation.\n*An example of a cwatset which is not a group is\n\n:''F'' = {000,110,101}.\n\nTo demonstrate that ''F'' is a cwatset, observe that\n: ''F'' + 000 = ''F''.\n: ''F'' + 110 = {110,000,011}, which is ''F'' with the first two bits of each string transposed.\n: ''F'' + 101 = {101,011,000}, which is the same as ''F'' after exchanging the first and third bits in each string.\n\n*A '''matrix representation''' of a cwatset is formed by writing its words as the rows of a 0-1 matrix. For instance a matrix representation of ''F'' is given by\n\n:::<math> F = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nTo see that ''F'' is a cwatset using this notation, note that\n\n:::<math> F + 000 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} = F^{id}=F^{(2,3)_R(2,3)_C}.\n</math>\n\n:::<math> F + 110 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,2)_R(1,2)_C}=F^{(1,2,3)_R(1,2,3)_C}.\n</math>\n\n:::<math> F + 101 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,3)_R(1,3)_C}=F^{(1,3,2)_R(1,3,2)_C}.</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\pi_R</math> and <math> \\sigma_C</math> denote [[permutation]]s of the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, expressed in [[cycle notation]].\n\n*For any <math> n \\geq 3 </math> another example of a cwatset is <math> K_n </math>, which has <math>n</math>-by-<math>n</math> matrix representation\n\n:::<math> K_n = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n & & & \\vdots & & \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nNote that for <math> n = 3</math>, <math>K_3=F</math>.\n\n*An example of a nongroup cwatset with a rectangular matrix representation is\n\n:::<math> W = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n===Properties===\n\nLet <math>C \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_2^n</math> be a cwatset.\n\n* The '''degree''' of ''C'' is equal to the exponent ''n''.\n* The '''order''' of ''C'', denoted by |''C''|, is the set [[cardinality]] of ''C''.\n* There is a necessary condition on the order of a cwatset in terms of its degree, which is\nanalogous to [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's Theorem]] in group theory.

The name is needed because there are operations, such as  [[division (mathematics)|division]] and [[subtraction]], that do not have it (for example, {{nowrap|\"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3\"}}); such operations are ''not'' commutative, and so are referred to as ''noncommutative operations''. The idea that simple operations, such as the [[multiplication (mathematics)|multiplication]] and [[addition]] of numbers, are commutative was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> A corresponding property exists for [[binary relation]]s; a binary relation is said to be [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.<ref>{{MathWorld|id=SymmetricRelation|title=Symmetric Relation}}</ref>\n\n==Common uses==\nThe ''commutative property'' (or ''commutative law'') is a property generally associated with binary operations and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  If the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to ''commute'' under that operation.\n\n==Mathematical definitions==\n{{Further|Symmetric function}}\nThe term \"commutative\" is used in several related senses.<ref name=\"Krowne, p.1\">Krowne, p.1</ref><ref>Weisstein, ''Commute'', p.1</ref>\n\n{{ordered list|1=\nA binary operation <math>*</math> on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called ''commutative'' if:\n:<math>x * y = y * x\\qquad\\mbox{for all }x,y\\in S</math>\n\nAn operation that does not satisfy the above property is called ''non-commutative''.\n|2=\nOne says that ''x commutes'' with ''y'' under <math>*</math> if:\n:<math> x * y = y * x </math>\n|3=\nA [[binary function]] <math>f \\colon A \\times A \\to B</math> is called ''commutative'' if:\n:<math>f(x, y) = f(y, x)\\qquad\\mbox{for all }x,y\\in A</math>\n}}\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Commutative operations in everyday life===\n[[File:Commutative Addition.svg|thumb|The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative.]]\n*Putting on socks resembles a commutative operation since which sock is put on first is unimportant.

This function is also written as p [[If and only if|IFF]] q, or as p ≡ q, or as E''pq''. \n:The last form is an example of the most concise notation in the article on truth functions, which lists the sixteen possible binary truth functions of which eight are commutative: V''pq'' = V''qp''; A''pq'' (OR) = A''qp''; D''pq'' (NAND) = D''qp''; E''pq'' (IFF) = E''qp''; J''pq'' = J''qp''; K''pq'' (AND) = K''qp''; X''pq'' (NOR) = X''qp''; O''pq'' = O''qp''.\n* Further examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s, addition and [[scalar product|scalar multiplication]] of [[vector space|vectors]], and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].\n\n===Noncommutative operations in daily life===\n\n*[[Concatenation]], the act of joining character strings together, is a noncommutative operation.

This can be studied using [[group theory]].\n*Thought processes are noncommutative: A person asked a question (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.\n*The act of dressing is either commutative or non-commutative, depending on the items. Putting on underwear and normal clothing is noncommutative. Putting on left and right socks is commutative.\n* Shuffling a deck of cards is non-commutative.

In higher branches of mathematics, such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[linear algebra]] the commutativity of well-known operations (such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.<ref>Axler, p.2</ref><ref name=\"Gallian, p.34\">Gallian, p.34</ref><ref>p. 26,87</ref>\n\n==Mathematical structures and commutativity==\n* A [[commutative semigroup]] is a set endowed with a total, [[associativity|associative]] and commutative operation.\n* If the operation additionally has an [[identity element]], we have a [[commutative monoid]]\n* An [[abelian group]], or ''commutative group'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose group operation is commutative.<ref name=\"Gallian, p.34\"/>\n* A [[commutative ring]] is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] whose [[multiplication]] is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.)<ref>Gallian p.236</ref>\n* In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] both addition and multiplication are commutative.<ref>Gallian p.250</ref>\n\n==Related properties==\n\n===Associativity===\n{{Main|Associative property}}\n\nThe associative property is closely related to the commutative property.  The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms doesn't change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.\n\nMost commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function\n\n:<math>f(x, y) = \\frac{x + y}{2},</math>\n\nwhich is clearly commutative (interchanging ''x'' and ''y'' does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, <math>f(-4, f(0, +4)) = -1</math> but <math>f(f(-4, 0), +4) = +1</math>).\nMore such examples may be found in [[commutative non-associative magmas]].\n\n===Distributive===\n{{Main|Distributive property}}\n\n===Symmetry===\n[[File:Symmetry Of Addition.svg|right|thumb|200px|Graph showing the symmetry of the addition function]]\n{{Main|Symmetry in mathematics}}\n\nSome forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity.  When a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line ''y = x''.  As an example, if we let a function ''f'' represent addition (a commutative operation) so that ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' + ''y'' then ''f'' is a symmetric function, which can be seen in the adjacent image.\n\nFor relations, a [[symmetric relation]] is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation ''R'' is symmetric, then <math>a R b \\Leftrightarrow b R a</math>.\n\n==Non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics==\n{{Main|Canonical commutation relation}}\n\nIn [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] as formulated by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], physical variables are represented by [[linear operators]] such as ''x'' (meaning multiply by ''x''), and <math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math>. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their [[Function composition|compositions]] <math>x \\frac{d}{dx}</math> and <math>\\frac{d}{dx} x</math> (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(x)</math>:\n\n::<math> x\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\psi = x\\cdot \\psi' \\ \\neq \\ \\psi + x\\cdot \\psi' = {\\mathrm{d}\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\left( x\\cdot \\psi \\right) </math>\n\nAccording to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]], which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear [[momentum]] in the ''x''-direction of a particle are represented by the operators <math>x</math> and <math>-i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}</math>, respectively (where <math>\\hbar</math> is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]). This is the same example except for the constant <math>-i \\hbar</math>, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[[Anticommutativity]]\n*[[Centralizer|Centralizer and normalizer]] (also called a commutant)\n*[[Commutative diagram]]\n*[[Commutative (neurophysiology)]]\n*[[Commutator]]\n*[[Parallelogram law]]\n*[[Particle statistics]] (for commutativity in [[physics]])\n*[[Quasi-commutative property]]\n*[[Trace monoid]]\n*[[Commuting probability]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n*{{Cite book| first=Sheldon | last=Axler | title=Linear Algebra Done Right, 2e | publisher=Springer | year=1997 | isbn=0-387-98258-2}}\n:''Abstract algebra theory.

There are different definitions used in [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]].\n\n== Group theory ==\nThe '''commutator''' of two elements, {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}}, of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] {{mvar|G}}, is the element\n: {{math|[''g'', ''h''] {{=}} ''g''<sup>−1</sup>''h''<sup>−1</sup>''gh''}}\n\nand is equal to the group's identity if and only if {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}} commute (that is, if and only if {{math|''gh'' {{=}} ''hg''}}). The set of all commutators of a group is not in general closed under the group operation, but the [[subgroup]] of ''G'' [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by all commutators is closed and is called the ''derived group'' or the ''[[commutator subgroup]]'' of ''G''. Commutators are used to define [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] and [[solvable group|solvable]] groups and the largest [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[quotient group]].\n\nThe definition of the commutator above is used throughout this article, but many other group theorists define the commutator as\n:{{math|[''g'', ''h''] {{=}} ''ghg''<sup>−1</sup>''h''<sup>−1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=108}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1975|p=65}}</ref>\n\n=== Identities (group theory) ===\nCommutator identities are an important tool in [[group theory]].<ref>{{harvtxt|McKay|2000|p=4}}</ref> The expression {{math|''a<sup>x</sup>''}} denotes the [[conjugate (group theory)#Definition|conjugate]] of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|x}}, defined as {{math|''x''<sup>−1</sup>''ax''}}.\n\n# <math>x^y = x[x, y].</math>\n# <math>[y, x] = [x,y]^{-1}.</math>\n# <math>[x, zy] = [x, y]\\cdot [x, z]^y</math> and <math>[x z, y] = [x, y]^z \\cdot [z, y].</math>\n# <math>\\left[x, y^{-1}\\right] = [y, x]^{y^{-1}}</math> and <math>\\left[x^{-1}, y\\right] = [y, x]^{x^{-1}}.</math>\n# <math>\\left[\\left[x, y^{-1}\\right], z\\right]^y \\cdot \\left[\\left[y, z^{-1}\\right], x\\right]^z \\cdot \\left[\\left[z, x^{-1}\\right], y\\right]^x = 1</math> and <math>\\left[\\left[x, y\\right], z^x\\right] \\cdot  \\left[[z ,x], y^z\\right] \\cdot \\left[[y, z], x^y\\right] = 1.</math>\n\nIdentity (5) is also known as the ''Hall–Witt identity'', after [[Philip Hall]] and [[Ernst Witt]].  It is a group-theoretic analogue of the [[Jacobi identity]] for the ring-theoretic commutator (see next section).\n\nN.B., the above definition of the conjugate of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|x}} is used by some group theorists.<ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1975|p=83}}</ref>  Many other group theorists define the conjugate of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|x}} as {{math|''xax<sup>−1</sup>''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=128}}</ref>  This is often written <math>{}^x a</math>.  Similar identities hold for these conventions.\n\nMany identities are used that are true modulo certain subgroups.  These can be particularly useful in the study of [[solvable group]]s and [[nilpotent group]]s.  For instance, in any group, second powers behave well:\n:<math>(xy)^2 = x^2 y^2 [y, x][[y, x], y].</math>\n\nIf the [[derived subgroup]] is central, then\n:<math>(xy)^n = x^n y^n [y, x]^\\binom{n}{2}.</math>\n\n== Ring theory ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Lie algebra]] -->\nThe '''commutator''' of two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] (including any [[associative algebra]]) is defined by\n: <math>[a, b] = ab - ba.</math>\n\nIt is zero if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' commute. In [[linear algebra]], if two [[endomorphism]]s of a space are represented by commuting matrices in terms of one basis, then they are so represented in terms of every basis. By using the commutator as a [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]], every associative algebra can be turned into a [[Lie algebra]].\n\nThe '''anticommutator''' of two elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} of a ring or an associative algebra is defined by\n: <math>\\{a, b\\} = ab + ba.</math>\n\nSometimes <math>[a,b]_+</math> is used to denote anticommutator, while <math>[a,b]_-</math> is then used for commutator.<ref>{{harvtxt|McMahon|2008}}</ref> The anticommutator is used less often, but can be used to define [[Clifford algebra]]s and [[Jordan algebra]]s, and in the derivation of the [[Dirac equation]] in particle physics.\n\nThe commutator of two operators acting on a [[Hilbert space]] is a central concept in [[quantum mechanics]], since it quantifies how well the two [[observable]]s described by these operators can be measured simultaneously. The [[uncertainty principle]] is ultimately a theorem about such commutators, by virtue of the [[Uncertainty relation|Robertson–Schrödinger relation]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Liboff|2003|pp=140–142}}</ref> In [[phase space]], equivalent commutators of function [[Moyal product|star-products]] are called [[Moyal bracket]]s, and are completely isomorphic to the Hilbert-space commutator structures mentioned.\n\n=== Identities (ring theory) ===\nThe commutator has the following properties:\n\n====Lie-algebra identities====\n# <math>[A + B, C] = [A, C] + [B, C]</math>\n# <math>[A, A] = 0</math>\n# <math>[A, B] = -[B, A]</math>\n# <math>[A, [B, C]] + [B, [C, A]] + [C, [A, B]] = 0</math>\n\nRelation (3) is called [[anticommutativity]], while (4) is the [[Jacobi identity]].\n\n====Additional identities====\n# <math>[A, BC] = [A, B]C + B[A, C]</math>\n# <math>[A, BCD] = [A, B]CD + B[A, C]D + BC[A, D]</math>\n# <math>[A, BCDE] = [A, B]CDE + B[A, C]DE + BC[A, D]E + BCD[A, E]</math>\n# <math>[AB, C] = A[B, C] + [A, C]B</math>\n# <math>[ABC, D] = AB[C, D] + A[B, D]C + [A, D]BC</math>\n# <math>[ABCD, E] = ABC[D, E] + AB[C, E]D + A[B, E]CD + [A, E]BCD</math>\n# <math>[A, B + C] = [A, B] + [A, C]</math>\n# <math>[A + B, C + D] = [A, C] + [A, D] + [B, C] + [B, D]</math>\n#<math>[AB, CD] = A[B, C]D + [A, C]BD + CA[B, D] + C[A, D]B</math>\n#<math>[[A, C], [B, D]] = [[[A, B], C], D] + [[[B, C], D], A] + [[[C, D], A], B] + [[[D, A], B], C]</math>\n\nIf {{mvar|A}} is a fixed element of a ring ''R'', identity (1) can be interpreted as a [[product rule|Leibniz rule]] for the map <math>\\operatorname{ad}_A: R \\rightarrow R</math> given by  <math>\\operatorname{ad}_A(B) = [A, B]</math>.  In other words, the map ad<sub>''A''</sub> defines a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] on the ring ''R''.  Identities (2), (3) represent Leibniz rules for more than two factors, and are valid for any derivation.  Identities (4)–(6) can also be interpreted as Leibniz rules. Identities (7), (8) express '''Z'''-[[Bilinear map|bilinearity]].\n\nSome of the above identities can be extended to the anticommutator using the above ± subscript notation.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5050.pdf|title=Jacobi -type identities in algebras and superalgebras|last=Lavrov|first=P.M.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|quote=}}</ref>\nFor example:\n\n#<math>[AB, C]_- = A[B, C]_\\mp \\pm [A, C]_\\mp B</math>\n#<math>[AB, CD]_- = A[B, C]_\\mp D \\pm AC[B, D]_\\mp + [A, C]_\\mp DB \\pm C[A, D]_\\mp B</math>\n#<math>\\left[A, [B, C]_\\pm\\right] + \\left[B, [C, A]_\\pm\\right] + \\left[C, [A, B]_\\pm\\right] = 0</math>\n\n==== Exponential identities ====\nConsider a ring or algebra in which the [[exponential function|exponential]] <math>e^A = \\exp(A) = 1 + A + \\tfrac{1}{2!}A^2 + \\cdots</math> can be meaningfully defined, such as a [[Banach algebra]], a ring of [[formal power series]], or the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a [[Lie algebra]].\n\nIn such a ring, [[Hadamard's lemma]] applied to nested commutators gives:<blockquote><math>e^A Be^{-A}\n  \\ =\\  B + [A, B] + \\frac{1}{2!}[A, [A, B]] + \\frac{1}{3!}[A, [A, [A, B]]] + \\cdots\n  \\ =\\  e^{\\operatorname{ad}_A}(B).\n</math></blockquote>(For the last expression, see ''Adjoint derivation'' below.) This formula underlies the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula#An important lemma|Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff expansion]] of log(exp(''A'') exp(''B'')). \n\nA similar expansion expresses the group commutator of expressions <math>e^A</math> (analogous to elements of a Lie group) in terms of a series of nested commutators (Lie brackets),<blockquote><math>\n  e^A e^B e^{-A} e^{-B} \\ =\\ \n\\exp\\!\\left(  [A, B] + \\frac{1}{2!}[A{+}B, [A, B]] + \\frac{1}{3!} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} [A, [B, [B, A]]] + [A{+}B, [A{+}B, [A, B]]]\\right) + \\cdots\\right).\n</math></blockquote>\n\n== Graded rings and algebras ==\nWhen dealing with [[graded algebra]]s, the commutator is usually replaced by the '''graded commutator''', defined in homogeneous components as \n:<math>[\\omega, \\eta]_{gr} := \\omega\\eta - (-1)^{\\deg \\omega \\deg \\eta} \\eta\\omega.</math>\n\n== Adjoint derivation ==\nEspecially if one deals with multiple commutators in a ring ''R'', another notation turns out to be useful.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_event_algebra",
      "text": "A '''conditional event algebra''' ('''CEA''') is an [[algebraic structure]] whose domain consists of logical objects described by statements of forms such as \"If ''A'', then ''B''\", \"''B'', given ''A''\", and \"''B'', in case ''A''\". Unlike the standard [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of events, a CEA allows the defining of a [[probability function]], ''P'', which satisfies the equation ''P''(If ''A'' then ''B'') = ''P''(''A'' and ''B'') / ''P''(''A'') over a usefully broad range of conditions.\n\n==Standard probability theory==\n\nIn [[probability theory|standard probability theory]], one begins with a set, Ω, of outcomes (or, in alternate terminology, a set of [[possible worlds]]) and a set, ''F'', of some (not necessarily all) subsets of Ω, such that ''F'' is closed under the [[Countable|countably infinite]] versions of the operations of [[Set (mathematics)|basic set theory]]: union (∪), intersection (∩), and complementation ( &prime;). A member of ''F'' is called an event (or, alternatively, a [[Propositional calculus|proposition]]), and ''F'', the set of events, is the domain of the algebra. Ω is, necessarily, a member of ''F'', namely the trivial event \"Some outcome occurs.\"\n\nA probability function ''P'' assigns to each member of ''F'' a real number, in such a way as to satisfy the following [[probability axioms|axioms]]:\n\n: For any event ''E'', ''P''(''E'') ≥ 0.\n\n: ''P''(Ω) = 1\n\n: For any [[countable]] sequence ''E''<sub>1</sub>, ''E''<sub>2</sub>, ... of pairwise disjoint events (meaning that each event is disjoint with every other event), ''P''(''E''<sub>1</sub> ∪ ''E''<sub>2</sub> ∪ ...) = ''P''(''E''<sub>1</sub>) + ''P''(''E''<sub>2</sub>) + ....\n\nIt follows that ''P''(''E'') is always less than or equal to 1. The probability function is the basis for statements like ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B''&prime;) = 0.73, which means, \"The probability that ''A'' but not ''B'' is 73%.\"\n\n==Conditional probabilities and probabilities of conditionals==\n\nThe statement \"The probability that if ''A'', then ''B'', is 24%.\" means (put intuitively) that event ''B'' occurs in 24% of the outcomes where event ''A'' occurs. The standard formal expression of this is ''P''(''B''|''A'') = 0.24, where the [[conditional probability]] ''P''(''B''|''A'') equals, by definition, ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') / ''P''(''A'').\n\nIt is tempting to write, instead, ''P''(''A'' → ''B'') = 0.24, where ''A'' → ''B'' is the conditional event \"If ''A'', then ''B''\". That is, given events ''A'' and ''B'', one might posit an event, ''A'' → ''B'', such that ''P''(''A'' → ''B'') could be counted on to equal ''P''(''B''|''A''). One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest conditional event descriptions within larger constructions. Then, for instance, one could write ''P''(''A'' ∪ (''B'' → ''C'')) = 0.51, meaning, \"The probability that either ''A'', or else if ''B'', then ''C'', is 51%\".\n\nUnfortunately, philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] showed that in orthodox probability theory, only certain trivial Boolean algebras with very few elements contain, for any given ''A'' and ''B'', an event ''X'' such that ''P''(''X'') = ''P''(''B''|''A'') is true for any probability function ''P''. Later extended by others, this result stands as a major obstacle to any talk about logical objects that can be the bearers of conditional probabilities.\n\n==The construction of conditional event algebras==\n\nThe classification of an algebra makes no reference to the nature of the objects in the domain, being entirely a matter of the formal behavior of the operations on the domain. However, investigation of the properties of an algebra often proceeds by assuming the objects to have a particular character. Thus, the canonical Boolean algebra is, as described above, an algebra of subsets of a universe set. What Lewis in effect showed is what can and cannot be done with an algebra whose members behave like members of such a set of subsets.\n\nConditional event algebras circumvent the obstacle identified by Lewis by using a nonstandard domain of objects. Instead of being members of a set ''F'' of subsets of some universe set Ω, the canonical objects are normally higher-level constructions of members of ''F.'' The most natural construction, and historically the first, uses ordered pairs of members of ''F.'' Other constructions use sets of members of ''F'' or infinite sequences of members of ''F''.\n\nSpecific types of CEA include the following (listed in order of discovery):\n\n: Shay algebras\n: Calabrese algebras\n: [[Goodman-Nguyen-van Fraassen algebra]]s\n: Goodman-Nguyen-Walker algebras\n\nCEAs differ in their formal properties, so that they cannot be considered a single, axiomatically characterized class of algebra. Goodman-Nguyen-van Frassen algebras, for example, are Boolean while Calabrese algebras are non-[[Distributive lattice|distributive]]. The latter, however, support the intuitively appealing identity ''A'' → (''B'' → ''C'') = (''A'' ∩ ''B'') → ''C'', while the former do not.\n\n==References==\n\nGoodman, I. R., R. P. S.

      "text": "{{other uses|Cyclic graph}}\n\nIn [[group theory]], a sub-field of [[abstract algebra]], a group '''cycle graph''' illustrates the various [[cyclic group|cycle]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small [[finite group]]s. \n\nA cycle is the set of  powers of a given group element ''a'', where ''a<sup>n</sup>'', the ''n''-th power of an element ''a'' is defined as the product of ''a'' multiplied by itself ''n'' times. The element ''a'' is said to ''generate'' the cycle.  In a finite group, some non-zero power of ''a'' must be the  [[identity element|group identity]], ''e''; the lowest such power is the '''order''' of the cycle, the number of distinct elements in it. In a cycle graph, the cycle is represented as a polygon, with the vertices representing the group elements, and the connecting lines indicating that all elements in that polygon are members of the same cycle.\n\n==Cycles==\nCycles can overlap, or they can have no element in common but the identity. The cycle graph displays each interesting cycle as a polygon.\n\nIf ''a'' generates a cycle of order 6 (or, more shortly, ''has'' order 6), then ''a''<sup>6</sup> = ''e''. Then the set of  powers of ''a''<sup>2</sup>, {''a''<sup>2</sup>, ''a''<sup>4</sup>, ''e''} is a cycle, but this is really no new information. Similarly, ''a''<sup>5</sup> generates the same cycle as ''a'' itself.\n\nSo, only the ''primitive'' cycles need be considered, namely those that are not subsets of another cycle. Each of these is generated by some ''primitive element'', ''a''.  Take one [[vertex (graph theory)|point]] for each element of the original group. For each primitive element, connect ''e'' to ''a'', ''a'' to ''a''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''a''<sup>''n''−1</sup> to ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>, etc., until ''e'' is reached. The result is the cycle graph.\n\nWhen ''a''<sup>2</sup> = ''e'', ''a'' has order 2 (is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]), and is connected to ''e'' by two edges.

The inverse ''a''<sup>−1</sup> = ''a''<sup>3</sup> is also a generator of this cycle: ({{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = ''a''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{nowrap|1=(''a''<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3</sup> = ''a''}}, and {{nowrap|1=(''a''<sup>3</sup>)<sup>4</sup> = ''e''}}. Similarly, any cycle in any group has at least two generators, and may be traversed in either direction. More generally, the number of [[Generating set of a group|generators]] of a cycle with ''n'' elements is given by the [[Euler's totient function|Euler φ function]] of ''n'', and any of these generators may be written as the first node in the cycle (next to the identity ''e''); or more commonly the nodes are left unmarked. Two distinct cycles cannot intersect in a generator.\n\n[[File:GroupDiagramQ8.svg|280px|thumb|Cycle graph of the quaternion group Q<sub>8</sub>.]]\n\nCycles that contain a non-prime number of elements have cyclic subgroups that are not shown in the graph. For the group  Dih<sub>4</sub> above, we could draw a line between ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''e'' since {{nowrap|1=(''a''<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = ''e''}}, but since ''a''<sup>2</sup> is part of a larger cycle, this is not an edge of the cycle graph.\n\nThere can be ambiguity when two cycles share a non-identity element. For example, the 8-element [[quaternion group]] has cycle graph shown at right. Each of the elements in the middle row when multiplied by itself gives −1 (where 1 is the identity element). In this case we may use different colors to keep track of the cycles, although symmetry considerations will work as well.\n\nAs noted earlier, the two edges of a 2-element cycle are typically represented as a single line.\n\nThe inverse of an element is the node symmetric to it in its cycle, with respect to the reflection which fixes the identity.\n\n== History ==\nCycle graphs were investigated by the number theorist [[Daniel Shanks]] in the early 1950s as a tool to study [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative groups of residue classes]].{{sfn|Shanks|1978|p=246}} Shanks first published the idea in the 1962 first edition of his book ''Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory''.{{sfn|Shanks|1978|p=xii}} In the book, Shanks investigates which groups have isomorphic cycle graphs and when a cycle graph is [[planar graph|planar]].{{sfn|Shanks|1978|pp=83–98, 206–208}} In the 1978 second edition, Shanks reflects on his research on [[class group]]s and the development of the [[baby-step giant-step]] method:{{sfn|Shanks|1978|p=225}} {{quotation|The cycle graphs have proved to be useful when working with finite Abelian groups; and I have used them frequently in finding my way around an intricate structure [77, p. 852], in obtaining a wanted multiplicative relation [78, p. 426], or in isolating some wanted subgroup [79].}}\n\nCycle graphs are used as a pedagogical tool in Nathan Carter's 2009 introductory textbook ''Visual Group Theory''.<ref>{{Citation |first=Nathan |last=Carter |year=2009 |title=Visual Group Theory |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |series=Classroom Resource Materials |isbn=978-0-88385-757-1}}</ref>\n\n== Graph characteristics of particular group families ==\n\nCertain group types give typical graphs:\n\n[[Cyclic group]]s Z<sub>''n''</sub>, order ''n'', is a single cycle graphed simply as an ''n''-sided polygon with the elements at the vertices:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC1.svg|40px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC2.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC3.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC4.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC5.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC6.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC7.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC8.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!

A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] such as a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] or the surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[sphere]] has a [[two-dimensional space|dimension of two]] because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, both a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a [[cube]], a cylinder or a sphere is [[three-dimensional]] because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.\n\nIn [[classical mechanics]], [[space]] and [[time]] are different categories and refer to [[absolute space and time]]. That conception of the world is a [[four-dimensional space]] but not the one that was found necessary to describe [[electromagnetism]]. The four dimensions of [[spacetime]] consist of [[event (relativity)|events]] that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. [[Minkowski space]] first approximates the universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe [[superstring theory]], eleven dimensions can describe [[supergravity]] and [[M-theory]], and the state-space of [[quantum mechanics]] is an infinite-dimensional [[function space]].\n\nThe concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. '''{{vanchor|High-dimensional space|N-dimensional space|n dimensional space}}s''' frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be [[parameter space]]s or [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration spaces]] such as in [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]; these are abstract [[space (mathematics)|spaces]], independent of the physical [[space]] we live in.\n\n== In mathematics ==\n\nIn mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [[parameter]]s or [[coordinates]] that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is two, etc.\n\nThe dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a [[curve]], such as a [[circle]] is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension lower than two, unless it is a line.\n\nThe dimension of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }}is {{math|''n''}}. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question \"what makes {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }} {{math|''n''}}-dimensional?\" One answer is that to cover a fixed [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] in {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }} by small balls of radius {{math|''ε''}}, one needs on the order of {{math|''ε''<sup>−''n''</sup>}} such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [[Minkowski dimension]] and its more sophisticated variant, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup> }} looks locally like {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''-1</sup> }} and this leads to the notion of the [[inductive dimension]]. While these notions agree on {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.\n\nA [[tesseract]] is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term \"dimension\" is as in: \"A tesseract ''has four dimensions''\", mathematicians usually express this as: \"The tesseract ''has dimension 4''\", or: \"The dimension of the tesseract ''is'' 4\".\n\nAlthough the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [[René Descartes]], substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Riemann's 1854 [[Habilitationsschrift]], Schläfli's 1852 ''Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität'', and Hamilton's discovery of the [[quaternion]]s and [[John T. Graves]]' discovery of the [[octonion]]s in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.\n\nThe rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.\n\n===Vector spaces===\n{{main|Dimension (vector space)}}\nThe dimension of a [[vector space]] is the number of vectors in any [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [[cardinality]] of a basis) is often referred to as the ''Hamel dimension'' or ''algebraic dimension'' to distinguish it from other notions of dimension. \n\nFor the non-[[free module|free]] case, this generalizes to the notion of the [[length of a module]].\n\n===Manifolds===\n<!--Linked from [[Ball (mathematics)]]-->\nThe uniquely defined dimension of every [[Connectedness|connected]] topological [[manifold]] can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [[Local property|locally]] [[homeomorphic]] to Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space, in which the number {{math|''n''}} is the manifold's dimension.\n\nFor connected [[differentiable manifold]]s, the dimension is also the dimension of the [[Tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any point.\n\nIn [[geometric topology]], the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the '''high-dimensional''' cases {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' > 4}}}} are simplified by having extra space in which to \"work\"; and the cases {{math|''n'' &#61; 3}} and {{math|4}} are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], where four different proof methods are applied.\n\n====Complex dimension====\n\nThe dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined.  While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [[real numbers]], it is sometimes useful in the study of [[complex manifold]]s and [[dimension of an algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] to work over the [[complex numbers]] instead. A complex number (''x'' + ''iy'') has a [[real part]] ''x'' and an [[imaginary part]] ''y'', where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension. \n\nConversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions.  For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [[sphere|spherical surface]], when given a complex metric, becomes a [[Riemann sphere]] of one complex dimension.<ref>Yau, S-T and Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010, Chapter 4.</ref>\n\n===Varieties===\n{{main|Dimension of an algebraic variety}}\nThe dimension of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [[tangent space]] at any [[Regular point of an algebraic variety]]. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [[hyperplane]]s that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.\n\nAn [[algebraic set]] being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains <math>V_0\\subsetneq V_1\\subsetneq \\ldots \\subsetneq V_d</math> of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of \"<math>\\subsetneq</math>\").\n\nEach variety can be considered as an [[stack (mathematics)|algebraic stack]], and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if ''V'' is a variety of dimension ''m'' and ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n'' [[Group action (mathematics)|acting on ''V'']], then the [[quotient stack]] [''V''/''G''] has dimension ''m''−''n''.<ref>{{citation|last=Fantechi|first=Barbara|chapter=Stacks for everybody|title=European Congress of Mathematics Volume I|volume=201|pages=349–359|series=Progr.

It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.\n\nFor an [[algebra over a field]], the dimension as [[vector space]] is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.\n\n===Topological spaces===\n\nFor any [[normal topological space]] {{math|''X''}}, the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of {{math|''X''}} is defined to be ''n'' if ''n'' is the smallest [[integer]] for which the following holds: any [[open cover]] has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. In this case dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''n''}}. For {{math|''X''}} a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer {{math|''n''}} exists, then the dimension of {{math|''X''}} is said to be infinite, and one writes dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∞}}. Moreover, {{math|''X''}} has dimension −1, i.e. dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} −1}} if and only if {{math|''X''}} is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [[Tychonoff space]]s merely by replacing the term \"open\" in the definition by the term \"'''functionally open'''\".\n\nAn [[inductive dimension]] may be defined [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] as follows. Consider a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a ''new direction'', one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional object by dragging an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional object in a ''new'' direction.  The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the ''small inductive dimension'' or the ''large inductive dimension'', and is based on the analogy that {{nowrap|({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional}} balls have {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.\n\nSimilarly, for the class of [[CW complexes]], the dimension of an object is the largest {{mvar|n}} for which the [[n-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] is nontrivial.  Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] into a collection of [[simplex|higher-dimensional triangles]] joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.{{cite needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nSee also: [[dimension of a scheme]].\n\n===Hausdorff dimension===\nThe [[Hausdorff dimension]] is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [[fractal]]s.

This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [[Hamel dimension]] is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.\n\n== In physics ==\n\n===Spatial dimensions===\nClassical physics theories describe three [[physical dimension]]s: from a particular point in [[space]], the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; ''i.e.'', moving in a [[linear combination]] of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [[Space]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]].)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:7.5em;\"| {{longitem|Number of<br />dimensions}}\n!

Time is often referred to as the \"[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]\" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [[Arrow of time|in one direction]].\n\nThe equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [[classical mechanics]] are [[T-symmetry|symmetric with respect to time]], and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [[C-symmetry|charge]] and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [[entropy]]).\n\nThe best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] (and extended to [[general relativity]]), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [[manifold]], known as [[spacetime]], and in the special, flat case as [[Minkowski space]].\n\n===Additional dimensions===\n\nIn physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [[fundamental forces]] by introducing [[extra dimensions]]. Most notably, [[superstring theory]] requires [[10 spacetime dimensions]], and originates from a more fundamental [[M-theory|11-dimensional]] theory tentatively called [[M-theory]] which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be \"curled up\" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments{{clarify|date=October 2014}} such as those at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].<ref name=\"arxiv.org\">CMS Collaboration, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 \"Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810063016/https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 |date=2017-08-10 }} (arxiv.org)</ref>\n\nAt the level of [[quantum field theory]], [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] unifies [[gravity]] with [[Gauge theory|gauge]] interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [[electromagnetism]]. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [[quantum gravity]]. Therefore, these models still require a [[UV completion]], of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.\n\nIn addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a {{nowrap|(3 + 1)-dimensional}} subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [[large extra dimensions]]. [[D-brane]]s are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [[brane]] by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or \"the bulk\". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.\n\nSome aspects of brane physics have been applied to [[Brane cosmology|cosmology]]. For example, brane gas cosmology<ref>Brandenberger, R., Vafa, C., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989NuPhB.316..391B Superstrings in the early universe]</ref><ref>Scott Watson, [http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf Brane Gas Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027144123/http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf |date=2014-10-27 }} (pdf).</ref> attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.\n\nExtra dimensions are said to be [[Universal extra dimension|universal]] if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.\n\n== Networks and dimension ==\n\nSome complex [[Network science|networks]] are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Song |first=Chaoming|  author2link=Shlomo Havlin  |title=Self-similarity of complex networks |journal=Nature |year=2005 |volume=433  |doi=10.1038/nature03248 |pmid=15674285|arxiv=cond-mat/0503078v1 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..392S |last2=Havlin |first2=Shlomo |last3=Makse |first3=Hernán A. |issue=7024|pages=392–395}}</ref>  The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dimension of spatially embedded networks |journal=Nature Physics |year=2011 |bibcode=2011NatPh...7..481D|doi=10.1038/nphys1932 |last=Daqing |first=Li |last2=Kosmidis |first2=Kosmas |last3=Bunde |first3=Armin |last4=Havlin |first4=Shlomo |author4link=Shlomo Havlin|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=481 }}</ref> The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.\n\n== In literature ==\n{{main|Fourth dimension in literature}}\n\n[[Science fiction]] texts often mention the concept of \"dimension\" when referring to [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel or alternate universes]] or other imagined [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]]. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.\n\nOne of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as \"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\"\n\nThe idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in [[Miles J. Breuer]]'s ''The Appendix and the Spectacles'' (1928) and [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''The Fifth-Dimension Catapult'' (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s.  Classic stories involving other dimensions include [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[—And He Built a Crooked House]]'' (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s ''Tiger by the Tail'' and ''The Universe Between'' (both 1951). Another reference is [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'' (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for \"tesseracting the universe\" or \"folding\" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions are also a key component of the book ''[[The Boy Who Reversed Himself]]'' by [[William Sleator]].\n\n== In philosophy ==\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1783, wrote: \"That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition ''a priori'' because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain.\"<ref>''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science|Prolegomena]]'', § 12</ref>\n\n\"Space has Four Dimensions\" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Gustav Fechner]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Dr. Mises\". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_limit",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''direct limit''' is a way to construct a (typically large) object from many (typically smaller) objects that are put together in a specific way. These objects may be [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Vector space|vector spaces]] or in general objects from any [[Category (mathematics)|category]].  The way they are put together is specified by a system of [[Homomorphism|homomorphisms]] (group homomorphism, ring homomorphism, or in general morphisms in the category) between those smaller objects. The direct limit of the objects <math>A_i</math>, where <math>i</math> ranges over some [[directed set]] <math>I</math>, is denoted by <math>\\varinjlim A_i </math>. (This is a slight [[abuse of notation]] as it suppresses the system of homomorphisms that is crucial for the structure of the limit.) \n\nDirect limits are a special case of the concept of [[limit (category theory)|colimit]] in [[category theory]]. Direct limits are [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[Inverse limit|inverse limits]] which are a special case of [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] in category theory.\n\n==Formal definition==\nWe will first give the definition for [[Algebraic structure|algebraic structures]] like [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], and then the general definition, which can be used in any [[Category (mathematics)|category]].\n\n===Direct limits of algebraic objects===\nIn this section objects are understood to consist of underlying [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] with a given [[algebraic structure]], such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (over a fixed ring), [[algebra over a field|algebras]] (over a fixed field), etc. With this in mind, ''[[homomorphism]]s'' are understood in the corresponding setting ([[group homomorphism]]s, etc.).\n\nLet <math>\\langle I,\\le\\rangle</math> be a [[directed set]]. Let <math>\\{A_i : i\\in I\\}</math> be a family of objects [[index set|indexed]] by <math>I\\,</math> and  <math> f_{ij}\\colon A_i \\rightarrow A_j </math> be a homomorphism for all <math>i \\le j</math> with the following properties:\n# <math>f_{ii}\\,</math> is the identity of <math>A_i\\,</math>, and\n# <math>f_{ik}= f_{jk}\\circ f_{ij}</math> for all <math>i\\le j\\le k</math>.\nThen the pair <math>\\langle A_i,f_{ij}\\rangle</math> is called a direct system over <math>I</math>.\n\nThe '''direct limit''' of the direct system <math>\\langle A_i,f_{ij}\\rangle</math> is denoted by <math>\\varinjlim A_i</math> and is defined as follows. Its underlying set is the [[disjoint union]] of the <math>A_i\\,</math>'s [[Modulo (jargon)|modulo]] a certain {{nowrap|[[equivalence relation]] <math>\\sim\\,</math>}}:\n\n:<math>\\varinjlim A_i = \\bigsqcup_i A_i\\bigg/\\sim.</math>\n\nHere, if <math>x_i\\in A_i</math> and <math>x_j\\in A_j</math>, then <math>x_i\\sim\\, x_j</math> [[iff]] there is some <math>k\\in I</math> with <math>i \\le k</math> and <math>j \\le k</math> and such that <math>f_{ik}(x_i) = f_{jk}(x_j)\\,</math>.\nHeuristically, two elements in the disjoint union are equivalent if and only if they \"eventually become equal\" in the direct system. An equivalent formulation that highlights the duality to the [[inverse limit]] is that an element is equivalent to all its images under the maps of the direct system, i.e. <math>x_i\\sim\\, f_{ij}(x_i)</math> whenever <math>i \\le j</math>.\n\nOne naturally obtains from this definition ''canonical functions'' <math>\\phi_i \\colon A_i\\rightarrow \\varinjlim A_i</math> sending each element to its equivalence class. The algebraic operations on <math>\\varinjlim A_i\\,</math> are defined such that these maps become homomorphisms.  Formally, the direct limit of the direct system <math>\\langle A_i,f_{ij}\\rangle</math> consists of the object <math>\\varinjlim A_i</math> together with the canonical homomorphisms <math>\\phi_i \\colon A_i\\rightarrow \\varinjlim A_i</math>.\n\n=== Direct limits in an arbitrary category ===\nThe direct limit can be defined in an arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|category]] <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> by means of a [[universal property]]. Let <math>\\langle X_i, f_{ij}\\rangle</math> be a direct system of objects and morphisms in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> (as defined above). A ''target'' is a pair <math>\\langle X, \\phi_i\\rangle</math> where <math>X\\,</math> is an object in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and <math>\\phi_i\\colon X_i\\rightarrow X</math> are morphisms for each <math>i\\in I</math> such that <math>\\phi_i =\\phi_j \\circ f_{ij}</math> whenever  <math>i \\le j</math>. A direct limit of the direct system <math>\\langle X_i, f_{ij}\\rangle</math> is a ''universally repelling target'' <math>\\langle X, \\phi_i\\rangle</math> in the sense that <math>\\langle X, \\phi_i\\rangle</math> is a target and for each target <math>\\langle Y, \\psi_i\\rangle</math>, there is a unique morphism <math> u\\colon X\\rightarrow Y</math> such that <math>u\\circ \\phi_i=\\psi_i</math> for each ''i''. The following diagram\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Image:Direct limit category.svg]]</div>\nwill then [[commutative diagram|commute]] for all ''i'', ''j''. \n\nThe direct limit is often denoted\n:<math>X = \\varinjlim X_i</math>\nwith the direct system <math>\\langle X_i, f_{ij}\\rangle</math> and the canonical morphisms <math>\\phi_i</math> being understood.\n\nUnlike for algebraic objects, not every direct system in an arbitrary category has a direct limit. If it does, however, the direct limit is unique in a strong sense: given another direct limit ''X''′ there exists a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]] ''X''′ → ''X'' that commutes with the canonical morphisms.\n\n==Examples==\n*A collection of subsets <math>M_i</math> of a set ''M'' can be [[Partial order|partially ordered]] by inclusion. If the collection is directed, its direct limit is the union <math>\\bigcup M_i</math>. The same is true for a directed collection of [[Subgroup|subgroups]] of a given group, or a directed collection of [[Subring|subrings]] of a given ring, etc.\n*Let ''I'' be any directed set with a [[greatest element]] ''m''. The direct limit of any corresponding direct system is isomorphic to ''X''<sub>''m''</sub> and the canonical morphism φ<sub>''m''</sub>: ''X''<sub>''m''</sub> → ''X'' is an isomorphism.\n*Let ''K'' be a field. For a positive integer ''n'', consider the [[general linear group]] GL(''n;K'') consisting of invertible ''n'' x ''n'' - matrices with entries from ''K''. We have a group homomorphism GL(''n;K'') → GL(''n''+1;''K'') which enlarges matrices by putting a 1 in the lower right corner and zeros elsewhere in the last row and column. The direct limit of this system is the general linear group of ''K'', written as GL(''K''). An element of GL(''K'') can be thought off as an infinite invertible matrix which differs from the infinite identity matrix in only finitely many entries. The group GL(''K'') is of vital importance in [[algebraic K-theory]].\n*Let ''p'' be a [[prime number]]. Consider the direct system composed of the [[Quotient group|factor groups]] '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''</sup>'''Z''' and the homomorphisms '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''</sup>'''Z''' → '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''+1</sup>'''Z''' induced by multiplication by ''p''. The direct limit of this system consists of all the [[roots of unity]] of order some power of ''p'', and is called the [[Prüfer group]] '''Z'''(''p''<sup>∞</sup>).\n*There is a (non-obvious) injective ring homomorphism from the ring of [[Symmetric polynomial|symmetric polynomials]] in ''n'' variables to the ring of symmetric polynomials in ''n+1'' variables. Forming the direct limit of this direct system yields the ring of symmetric functions.\n*Let ''F'' be a ''C''-valued [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] on a [[topological space]] ''X''. Fix a point ''x'' in ''X''. The open neighborhoods of ''x'' form a directed set ordered by inclusion (''U'' ≤ ''V'' if and only if ''U'' contains ''V''). The corresponding direct system is (''F''(''U''), ''r''<sub>''U'',''V''</sub>) where ''r'' is the restriction map. The direct limit of this system is called the ''[[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]]'' of ''F'' at ''x'', denoted ''F''<sub>''x''</sub>. For each neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'', the canonical morphism ''F''(''U'') → ''F''<sub>''x''</sub> associates to a section ''s'' of ''F'' over ''U'' an element ''s''<sub>''x''</sub> of the stalk ''F''<sub>''x''</sub> called the ''[[germ (mathematics)|germ]]'' of ''s'' at ''x''.\n*Direct limits in the [[category of topological spaces]] are given by placing the [[final topology]] on the underlying set-theoretic direct limit.\n\n== Properties ==\nDirect limits are linked to [[inverse limit]]s via\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Hom} (\\varinjlim X_i, Y) = \\varprojlim \\mathrm{Hom} (X_i, Y).</math>\n\nAn important property is that taking direct limits in the category of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] is an [[exact functor]]. This means that if you start with a directed system of short exact sequences <math>0 \\to A_i \\to B_i \\to C_i \\to 0</math> and form direct limits, you obtain a short exact sequence <math>0 \\to \\varinjlim A_i \\to \\varinjlim B_i \\to \\varinjlim C_i \\to 0</math>.\n\n== Related constructions and generalizations ==\nWe note that a direct system in a category <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> admits an alternative description in terms of [[functor]]s. Any directed set <math>\\langle I,\\le \\rangle</math> can be considered as a [[small category]] <math>\\mathcal{I}</math> whose objects are the elements <math>I</math> and there is a morphisms  <math>i\\rightarrow j</math> [[if and only if]] <math>i\\le j</math>. A direct system over <math>I</math> is then the same as a [[covariant functor]] <math>\\mathcal{I}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}</math>. The [[Limit (category theory)|colimit]] of this functor is the same as the direct limit of the original direct system.\n\nA notion closely related to direct limits are the [[Filtered category|filtered colimits]]. Here we start with a covariant functor <math>\\mathcal J \\to \\mathcal C</math> from a [[filtered category]] <math>\\mathcal J</math> to some category <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and form the colimit of this functor. One can show that a category has all directed limits if and only if it has all filtered colimits, and a functor defined on such a category commutes with all direct limits if and only if it commutes with all filtered colimits.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=iXh6rOd7of0C|title=Locally Presentable and Accessible Categories|last=Adamek|first=J.|last2=Rosicky|first2=J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|location=|pages=15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nGiven an arbitrary category <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, there may be direct systems in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> which don't have a direct limit in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> (consider for example the category of finite sets, or the category of finitely generated abelian groups). In this case, we can always embed <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> into a category <math>\\text{Ind}(\\mathcal{C})</math> in which all direct limits exist; the objects of  <math>\\text{Ind}(\\mathcal{C})</math> are called [[Ind-object|ind-objects]] of  <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>.  \n\nThe [[Dual (category theory)|categorical dual]] of the direct limit is called the [[inverse limit]]. As above, inverse limits can be viewed as limits of certain functors and are closely related to limits over cofiltered categories.\n\n== Terminology ==\nIn the literature, one finds the terms \"directed limit\", \"direct inductive limit\", \"directed colimit\", \"direct colimit\" and \"inductive limit\" for the concept of direct limit defined above. The term \"inductive limit\" is ambiguous however, as some authors use it for the general concept of colimit.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Direct limit of groups|Direct limits of groups]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{refs}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last=Bourbaki | first=Nicolas | author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki | year=1968 | title=Elements of mathematics.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], one can often define a '''direct product''' of objects already known, giving a new one. This generalizes the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets, together with a suitably defined structure on the product set. More abstractly, one talks about the [[Product (category theory)|product in category theory]], which formalizes these notions.\n\nExamples are the product of sets (see [[Cartesian product]]), groups (described below), the [[product of rings]] and of other [[abstract algebra|algebraic structures]]. The [[product topology|product of topological spaces]] is another instance.\n\nThere is also the [[direct sum]] – in some areas this is used interchangeably, while in others it is a different concept.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* If we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of real numbers, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> is just the Cartesian product <math>\\{ (x,y) \\mid x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math>.\n* If we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of real numbers under addition, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> still has <math>\\{ (x,y) \\mid x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math> as its underlying set. The difference between this and the preceding example is that <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> is now a group, and so we have to also say how to add their elements. This is done by defining <math>(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)</math>.\n* If we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of real numbers, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> again has <math>\\{ (x,y) \\mid x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math> as its underlying set. The ring structure ring consists of addition defined by <math>(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)</math> and multiplication defined by <math>(a,b) (c,d) = (ac, bd)</math>.\n* However, if we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of real numbers, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> does not exist – naively defining addition and multiplication componentwise as in the above example would not result in a field since the element <math>(1,0)</math> does not have a [[multiplicative inverse]].\n\nIn a similar manner, we can talk about the direct product of finitely many algebraic structures, e.g. <math>\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}</math>. This relies on the fact that the direct product is [[associative]] up to [[isomorphism]]. That is, <math>(A \\times B) \\times C \\cong A \\times (B \\times C)</math> for any algebraic structures <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>C</math> of the same kind. The direct sum is also [[commutative]] up to isomorphism, i.e. <math>A \\times B \\cong B \\times A</math> for any algebraic structures <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> of the same kind. We can even talk about the direct product of infinitely many algebraic structures; for example we can take the direct product of [[countably infinite|countably]] many copies of <math>\\mathbb R</math>, which we write as <math>\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\dotsb</math>.\n\n== Group direct product ==\n{{main|Direct product of groups}}\nIn [[group (mathematics)|group theory]] one can define the direct product of two groups (''G'', ∘) and (''H'', ∙), denoted by ''G'' × ''H''. For [[abelian group]]s which are written additively, it may also be called the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum of two groups]], denoted by <math>G \\oplus H</math>.\n\nIt is defined as follows:\n* the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of the elements of the new group is the ''Cartesian product'' of the sets of elements of ''G'' and ''H'', that is {(''g'', ''h''): ''g'' ∈ ''G'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''};\n* on these elements put an operation, defined element-wise:\n*: (''g'', ''h'') × (''g{{'}}'', ''h' '') = (''g'' ∘ ''g{{'}}'', ''h'' ∙ ''h{{'}}'')\n(Note that (''G'', ∘) may be the same as (''H'', ∙))\n\nThis construction gives a new group. It has a [[normal subgroup]] isomorphic to ''G'' (given by the elements of the form (''g'', 1)), and one isomorphic to ''H'' (comprising the elements (1, ''h'')).\n\nThe reverse also holds, there is the following recognition theorem: If a group ''K'' contains two normal subgroups ''G'' and ''H'', such that ''K''= ''GH'' and the intersection of ''G'' and ''H'' contains only the identity, then ''K'' is isomorphic to ''G'' × ''H''. A relaxation of these conditions, requiring only one subgroup to be normal, gives the [[semidirect product]].\n\nAs an example, take as ''G'' and ''H'' two copies of the unique (up to isomorphisms) group of order 2, ''C''<sub>2</sub>: say {1, ''a''} and {1, ''b''}. Then ''C''<sub>2</sub>×''C''<sub>2</sub> = {(1,1), (1,''b''), (''a'',1), (''a'',''b'')}, with the operation element by element. For instance, (1,''b'')*(''a'',1) = (1*''a'', ''b''*1) = (''a'',''b''), and (1,''b'')*(1,''b'') = (1,''b''<sup>2</sup>) = (1,1).\n\nWith a direct product, we get some natural [[group homomorphism]]s for free: the projection maps define by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\pi_1: G \\times H \\to G, \\ \\ \\pi_1(g, h) &= g \\\\\n  \\pi_2: G \\times H \\to H, \\ \\ \\pi_2(g, h) &= h\n\\end{align}</math>\ncalled the '''coordinate functions'''.\n\nAlso, every homomorphism ''f'' to the direct product is totally determined by its component functions \n<math>f_i = \\pi_i \\circ f</math>.\n\nFor any group (''G'', ∘) and any integer ''n'' ≥ 0, repeated application of the direct product gives the group of all ''n''-[[tuple]]s  ''G''<sup>''n''</sup> (for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 we get the [[trivial group]]), for example '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> and '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n== Direct product of modules ==\nThe direct product for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (not to be confused with the [[Tensor product of modules|tensor product]]) is very similar to the one defined for groups above, using the Cartesian product with the operation of addition being componentwise, and the scalar multiplication just distributing over all the components. Starting from '''R''' we get [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the prototypical example of a real ''n''-dimensional vector space. The direct product of '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> and '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is '''R'''<sup>''m''+''n''</sup>.\n\nNote that a direct product for a finite index <math>\\prod_{i=1}^n X_i </math> is identical to the [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] <math>\\bigoplus_{i=1}^n X_i </math>. The direct sum and direct product differ only for infinite indices, where the elements of a direct sum are zero for all but for a finite number of entries. They are dual in the sense of [[category theory]]: the direct sum is the [[coproduct]], while the direct product is the product.\n\nFor example, consider <math>X=\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{R} </math> and <math>Y=\\bigoplus_{i=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{R}</math>, the infinite direct product and direct sum of the real numbers. Only sequences with a finite number of non-zero elements are in ''Y''. For example, (1,0,0,0,...) is in ''Y'' but (1,1,1,1,...) is not. Both of these sequences are in the direct product ''X''; in fact, ''Y'' is a proper subset of ''X'' (that is, ''Y''&nbsp;⊂&nbsp;''X'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectProduct.html|title=Direct Product|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupDirectProduct.html|title=Group Direct Product|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n== Topological space direct product ==\nThe direct product for a collection of [[topological space]]s ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' in ''I'', some index set, once again makes use of the Cartesian product\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i. </math>\n\nDefining the [[topology]] is a little tricky. For finitely many factors, this is the obvious and natural thing to do: simply take as a [[basis (topology)|basis]] of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal B = \\{ U_1 \\times \\cdots \\times U_n\\ |\\ U_i\\ \\mathrm{open\\ in}\\ X_i \\}.</math>\n\nThis topology is called the [[product topology]]. For example, directly defining the product topology on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by the open sets of '''R''' (disjoint unions of open intervals), the basis for this topology would consist of all disjoint unions of open rectangles in the plane (as it turns out, it coincides with the usual [[metric space|metric]] topology).\n\nThe product topology for infinite products has a twist, and this has to do with being able to make all the projection maps continuous and to make all functions into the product  continuous if and only if all its component functions are continuous (i.e. to satisfy the categorical definition of product: the morphisms here are continuous functions): we take as a basis of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor, as before, with the proviso that all but finitely many of the open subsets are the entire factor:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal B = \\left\\{ \\prod_{i \\in I} U_i\\ \\Big|\\ (\\exists j_1,\\ldots,j_n)(U_{j_i}\\ \\mathrm{open\\ in}\\ X_{j_i})\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ (\\forall i \\neq j_1,\\ldots,j_n)(U_i = X_i) \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe more natural-sounding topology would be, in this case, to take products of infinitely many open subsets as before, and this does yield a somewhat interesting topology, the [[box topology]]. However it is not too difficult to find an example of bunch of continuous component functions whose product function is not continuous (see the separate entry box topology for an example and more). The problem which makes the twist necessary is ultimately rooted in the fact that the intersection of open sets is only guaranteed to be open for finitely many sets in the definition of topology.\n\nProducts (with the product topology) are nice with respect to preserving properties of their factors; for example, the product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff; the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of compact spaces is compact. That last one, called [[Tychonoff's theorem]], is yet another equivalence to the [[axiom of choice]].\n\nFor more properties and equivalent formulations, see the separate entry [[product topology]].\n\n== Direct product of binary relations ==\nOn the Cartesian product of two sets with [[binary relation]]s R and S, define (''a'', ''b'')T(''c'', ''d'') as ''a''R''c'' and ''b''S''d''. If R and S are both [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], or [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], then T will be also.<ref>[http://cr.yp.to/2005-261/bender1/EO.pdf Equivalence and Order]</ref> Combining properties it follows that this also applies for being a [[preorder]] and being an [[equivalence relation]]. However if R and S are [[total relation]]s, T is in not general total.\n\n== Direct product in universal algebra ==\nIf Σ is a fixed [[Signature (logic)|signature]], ''I'' is an arbitrary (possibly infinite) index set, and ('''A'''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''∈''I''</sub> is an [[indexed family]] of Σ algebras, the '''direct product''' '''A''' = ∏<sub>''i''∈''I''</sub> '''A'''<sub>''i''</sub> is a Σ algebra defined as follows:\n* The universe set ''A'' of '''A''' is the Cartesian product of the universe sets ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> of '''A'''<sub>''i''</sub>, formally: ''A'' = ∏<sub>''i''∈''I''</sub> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>;\n* For each ''n'' and each ''n''-ary operation symbol {{nowrap|''f'' ∈ Σ}}, its interpretation ''f''<sup>'''A'''</sup> in '''A''' is defined componentwise, formally: for all {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> ∈ ''A''}} and each {{nowrap|''i'' ∈ ''I''}}, the ''i''th component of {{nowrap|''f''<sup>'''A'''</sup>(''a''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} is defined as {{nowrap|''f''<sup>'''A'''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>(''a''<sub>1</sub>(''i''), …, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>(''i''))}}.\nFor each {{nowrap|''i'' ∈ ''I''}}, the ''i''th projection {{nowrap|π<sub>''i''</sub> : ''A'' → ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is defined by {{nowrap|1=π<sub>''i''</sub>(''a'') = ''a''(''i'')}}.

If Σ just contains one binary operation ''f'', the [[#Group direct product|above]] definition of the direct product of groups is obtained, using the notation {{nowrap|1=''A''<sub>1</sub> = ''G''}}, {{nowrap|1=''A''<sub>2</sub> = ''H''}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>'''A'''<sub>1</sub></sup> = ∘}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>'''A'''<sub>2</sub></sup> = ∙}}, and {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>'''A'''</sup> = ×}}. Similarly, the definition of the direct product of modules is subsumed here.\n\n== Categorical product ==\n{{Main|Product (category theory)}}\n\nThe direct product can be abstracted to an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]. In a general category, given a collection of objects ''A<sub>i</sub>'' ''and'' a collection of [[morphism]]s ''p<sub>i</sub>'' from ''A'' to ''A<sub>i</sub>''{{clarify|Is A a single object from A_i, or all A_i?|date=February 2012}} with ''i'' ranging in some index set ''I'', an object ''A'' is said to be a '''categorical product''' in the category if, for any object ''B'' and any collection of morphisms ''f<sub>i</sub>'' from ''B'' to ''A<sub>i</sub>'', there exists a unique morphism ''f'' from ''B'' to ''A'' such that ''f<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>i</sub> f'' and this object ''A'' is unique. This not only works for two factors, but arbitrarily (even infinitely) many.\n\nFor groups we similarly define the direct product of a more general, arbitrary collection of groups ''G<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' in ''I'', ''I'' an index set. Denoting the Cartesian product of the groups by ''G'' we define multiplication on ''G''  with the operation of componentwise multiplication; and corresponding to the ''p<sub>i</sub>'' in the definition above are the projection maps\n\n:<math>\\pi_i \\colon G \\to G_i\\quad \\mathrm{by} \\quad \\pi_i(g) = g_i</math>,\n\nthe functions that take <math>(g_j)_{j \\in I}</math> to its ''i''th component ''g<sub>i</sub>''.\n<!-- this is easier to visualize as a [[commutative diagram]]; eventually somebody should insert a relevant diagram for the categorical product here! -->\n\n== Internal and external direct product ==\n<!-- linked from [[Internal direct product]] and [[External direct product]] -->\n{{see also|Internal direct sum}}\n\nSome authors draw a distinction between an '''internal direct product''' and an '''external direct product.''' If <math>A, B \\subset X</math> and <math>A \\times B \\cong X</math>, then we say that ''X'' is an ''internal'' direct product of ''A'' and ''B'', while if ''A'' and ''B'' are not subobjects then we say that this is an ''external'' direct product.\n\n==Metric and norm==\nA metric on a Cartesian product of metric spaces, and a norm on a direct product of normed vector spaces, can be defined in various ways, see for example [[Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Direct sum]]\n*[[Cartesian product]]\n*[[Coproduct]]\n*[[Free product]]\n*[[Semidirect product]]\n*[[Zappa–Szep product]]\n*[[Tensor product of graphs]]\n*[[Total order#Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets|Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n*{{Lang Algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Direct Product}}\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]\n\n[[ru:Прямое произведение#Прямое произведение групп]]"

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = January 2019}}\n{{Short description|Operation in abstract algebra composing objects into \"more complicated\" objects}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}\nThe '''direct sum''' is an operation from [[abstract algebra]] (a branch of [[mathematics]]).  For example, the direct sum <math> \\mathbf{R} \\oplus \\mathbf{R} </math>, where <math> \\mathbf{R} </math> is [[real coordinate space]], is the [[Cartesian plane]], <math> \\mathbf{R} ^2 </math>. To see how direct sum is used in abstract algebra, consider a more elementary structure in abstract algebra, the [[abelian group]].  The direct sum of two [[abelian group]]s <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> is another abelian group <math>A\\oplus B</math> consisting of the ordered pairs <math>(a,b)</math> where <math>a \\in A</math> and <math>b \\in B</math>.  (Confusingly this ordered pair is also called the [[cartesian product]] of the two groups.) To add ordered pairs, we define the sum <math>(a, b) + (c, d)</math> to be <math>(a + c, b + d)</math>; in other words addition is defined coordinate-wise.  A similar process can be used to form the direct sum of any two algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[vector space]]s.\n\nWe can also form direct sums with any finite number of summands, for example <math>A \\oplus B \\oplus C</math>, provided <math>A, B,</math> and <math>C</math> are the same kinds of algebraic structures (that is, all groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.). This relies on the fact that the direct sum is [[associative]] up to [[isomorphism]]. That is, <math>(A \\oplus B) \\oplus C \\cong A \\oplus (B \\oplus C)</math> for any algebraic structures <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>C</math> of the same kind. The direct sum is also [[commutative]] up to isomorphism, i.e. <math>A \\oplus B \\cong B \\oplus A</math> for any algebraic structures <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> of the same kind.\n\nIn the case of two summands, or any finite number of summands, the direct sum is the same as the [[direct product]].  If the arithmetic operation is written as +, as it usually is in abelian groups, then we use the direct sum.  If the arithmetic operation is written as × or ⋅ or using juxtaposition (as in the expression <math>xy</math>) we use direct product.\n\nIn the case where infinitely many objects are combined, most authors make a distinction between direct sum and direct product.  As an example, consider the direct sum and direct product of infinitely many real lines.  An element in the direct product is an infinite sequence, such as (1,2,3,...) but in the direct sum, there would be a requirement that all but finitely many coordinates be zero, so the sequence (1,2,3,...) would be an element of the direct product but not of the direct sum, while (1,2,0,0,0,...) would be an element of both. More generally, if a + sign is used, all but finitely many coordinates must be zero, while if some form of multiplication is used, all but finitely many coordinates must be 1.  In more technical language, if the summands are <math>(A_i)_{i \\in I}</math>, the direct sum <math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} A_i</math> is defined to be the set of tuples <math>(a_i)_{i \\in I}</math> with <math>a_i \\in A_i</math> such that <math>a_i=0</math> for all but finitely many ''i''.  The direct sum <math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} A_i</math> is contained in the [[direct product]] <math>\\prod_{i \\in I} A_i</math>, but is usually strictly smaller when the [[index set]] <math>I</math> is infinite, because direct products do not have the restriction that all but finitely many coordinates must be zero.<ref>[[Thomas W. Hungerford]], ''Algebra'', p.60, Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|0387905189}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe ''xy''-plane, a two-dimensional [[vector space]], can be thought of as the direct sum of two one-dimensional vector spaces, namely the ''x'' and ''y'' axes. In this direct sum, the ''x'' and ''y'' axes intersect only at the origin (the zero vector). Addition is defined coordinate-wise, that is <math>(x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = (x_1+x_2, y_1 + y_2)</math>, which is the same as vector addition.\n\nGiven two structures <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, their direct sum is written as <math>A\\oplus B</math>. Given an [[indexed family]] of structures <math>A_i</math>, indexed with <math>i \\in I</math>, the direct sum may be written <math>\\textstyle A=\\bigoplus_{i\\in I}A_i</math>.  Each ''A<sub>i</sub>'' is called a '''direct summand''' of ''A''.  If the index set is finite, the direct sum is the same as the direct product.  In the case of groups, if the group operation is written as <math>+</math> the phrase \"direct sum\" is used, while if the group operation is written <math>*</math> the phrase \"direct product\" is used.  When the index set is infinite, the direct sum is not the same as the direct product since the direct sum has the extra requirement that all but finitely many coordinates must be zero.\n\n===Internal and external direct sums===\n\nA distinction is made between internal and external direct sums, though the two are isomorphic. If the factors are defined first, and then the direct sum is defined in terms of the factors, we have an external direct sum. For example, if we define the real numbers <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> and then define <math>\\mathbf{R} \\oplus \\mathbf{R}</math> the direct sum is said to be external.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we first define some algebraic structure <math>S</math> and then write <math>S</math> as a direct sum of two substructures <math>V</math> and <math>W</math>, then the direct sum is said to be internal.  In this case, each element of <math>S</math> is expressible uniquely as an algebraic combination of an element of <math>V</math> and an element of <math>W</math>. For an example of an internal direct sum, consider <math>\\mathbb Z_6</math> (the integers modulo six), whose elements are <math>\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}</math>. This is expressible as an internal direct sum <math>\\mathbb Z_6 = \\{0, 2, 4\\} \\oplus \\{0, 3\\}</math>.\n\n==Types of direct sum==\n\n===Direct sum of abelian groups===\nThe '''direct sum of abelian groups''' is a prototypical example of a direct sum. Given two [[abelian groups]] <math>(A, \\circ)</math> and <math>(B, \\bullet)</math>, their direct sum <math>A \\oplus B</math> is the same as their [[direct product of groups|direct product]], that is the underlying set is the Cartesian product <math>A \\times B</math> and the group operation <math>\\cdot</math> is defined component-wise:\n:<math>(a_1, b_1) \\cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 \\circ a_2, b_1 \\bullet b_2)</math>.\nThis definition generalizes to direct sums of finitely many abelian groups.\n\nFor an infinite family of abelian groups ''A<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' ∈ ''I'', the direct sum\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in I}A_i</math>\nis a [[proper subgroup]] of the direct product. It consists of the elements <math>\\textstyle (a_i)\\in\\prod_{j \\in I}A_j</math> such that ''a<sub>i</sub>'' is the identity element of ''A<sub>i</sub>'' for all but finitely many ''i''.<ref>Joseph J. Rotman, ''The Theory of Groups: an Introduction'', p. 177, Allyn and Bacon, 1965</ref>\n\n===Direct sum of modules===\n{{main|Direct sum of modules}}\nThe ''direct sum of modules'' is a construction which combines several [[module (mathematics)|modules]] into a new module.\n\nThe most familiar examples of this construction occur when considering [[vector space]]s, which are modules over a [[field (mathematics)|field]].  The construction may also be extended to [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s.\n\n===Direct sum of group representations===\n{{See also|Representation theory of finite groups#Direct sum of representations}}\n\nThe '''direct sum of group representations''' generalizes the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of the underlying [[module (mathematics)|modules]], adding a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] to it. Specifically, given a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' and two [[group representation|representations]] ''V'' and ''W'' of ''G'' (or, more generally, two [[G-module|''G''-modules]]), the direct sum of the representations is ''V'' ⊕ ''W'' with the action of ''g'' ∈ ''G'' given component-wise, i.e.\n:''g''·(''v'', ''w'') = (''g''·''v'', ''g''·''w'').\n\n===Direct sum of rings===\n{{main|Product of rings}}\nSome authors will speak of the direct sum <math>R \\oplus S</math> of two rings when they mean the [[direct product]] <math>R \\times S</math>, but this should be avoided<ref>[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/345501/is-a-times-b-the-same-as-a-oplus-b Math StackExchange] on direct sum of rings vs. direct product of rings.</ref> since <math>R \\times S</math> does not receive natural ring homomorphisms from ''R'' and ''S'': in particular, the map <math>R \\to R \\times S</math> sending ''r'' to (''r'',0) is not a ring homomorphism since it fails to send 1 to (1,1) (assuming that 0≠1 in ''S'').  Thus <math>R \\times S</math> is not a coproduct in the [[category of rings]], and should not be written as a direct sum.  (The coproduct in the [[category of commutative rings]] is the [[tensor product of rings]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|2002}}, section I.11</ref> In the category of rings, the coproduct is given by a construction similar to the [[free product]] of groups.)\n\nUse of direct sum terminology and notation is especially problematic when dealing with infinite families of rings: If <math>(R_i)_{i \\in I}</math> is an infinite collection of nontrivial rings, then the direct sum of the underlying additive groups can be equipped with termwise multiplication, but this produces a [[rng (algebra)|rng]], i.e., a ring without a multiplicative identity.\n\n===Direct sum in categories===\nAn [[additive category]] is an abstraction of the properties of the category of modules.<ref>[http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~schapira/lectnotes/HomAl.pdf \"p.45\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/aqft.pdf \"appendix\"]</ref> In such a category finite products and coproducts agree and the direct sum is either of them, cf. [[biproduct]].\n\nGeneral case:<ref>[http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/direct+sum]</ref>\nIn [[category theory]] the direct sum is often, but not always, the [[coproduct]] in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of the mathematical objects in question.  For example, in the category of abelian groups, direct sum is a coproduct.  This is also true in the category of modules.\n\n==Homomorphisms==\n{{clarify|date=February 2015}}<!--the context is unclear. -->\nThe direct sum <math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} A_i</math> comes equipped with a ''[[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]'' [[homomorphism]] <math>\\pi_j \\colon \\, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} A_i \\to A_j</math> for each ''j'' in ''I'' and a ''coprojection'' <math>\\alpha_j \\colon \\, A_j \\to \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} A_i</math> for each ''j'' in ''I''.<ref name=Heu26>{{cite book | title=Categorical Quantum Models and Logics | series=Pallas Proefschriften | first=Chris | last=Heunen | publisher=Amsterdam University Press | year=2009 | isbn=9085550246 | page=26 }}</ref>  Given another algebraic structure <math>B</math> (with the same additional structure) and homomorphisms <math>g_j \\colon A_j \\to B</math> for every ''j'' in ''I'', there is a unique homomorphism <math>g \\colon \\, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} A_i \\to B</math>, called the sum of the ''g''<sub>''j''</sub>, such that <math>g \\alpha_j =g_j</math> for all ''j''.  Thus the direct sum is the [[coproduct]] in the appropriate [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Direct sum of groups]]\n*[[Direct sum of permutations]]\n*[[Direct sum of topological groups]]\n*[[Restricted product]]\n*[[Whitney sum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Lang Algebra|edition=3r}}\n\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]"
