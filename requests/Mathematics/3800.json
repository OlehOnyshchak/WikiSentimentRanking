In the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),]] a popular model of realization of supersymmetry at a low energy, there are four neutralinos that are [[fermion]]s and are electrically neutral, the lightest of which is stable in an [[R-parity]] conserved scenario of MSSM.  They are typically labeled {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 1}} (the lightest), {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 2}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 3}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 4}} (the heaviest) although sometimes <math> \\tilde{\\chi}_1^0, \\ldots, \\tilde{\\chi}_4^0</math> is also used when <math> \\tilde{\\chi}_i^\\pm</math> is used to refer to [[chargino]]s.  These four states are mixtures of the [[Gaugino|bino]] and the neutral [[Wino (particle)|wino]] (which are the neutral electroweak [[gaugino]]s), and the neutral [[higgsinos]].  As the neutralinos are [[Majorana fermion]]s, each of them is identical to its [[antiparticle]].  Because these particles only interact with the weak vector bosons, they are not directly produced at [[hadron collider]]s in copious numbers. They would primarily appear as particles in cascade decays of heavier particles (decays that happen in multiple steps) usually originating from [[Quantum chromodynamics|colored]] supersymmetric particles such as [[squark]]s or [[gluino]]s.\n\nIn [[R-parity]] conserving models, the lightest neutralino is stable and all supersymmetric cascade-decays end up decaying into this particle which leaves the detector unseen and its existence can only be inferred by looking for unbalanced momentum in a detector.\n\nThe heavier neutralinos typically decay through a neutral [[Z boson]] to a lighter neutralino or through a charged [[W boson]] to a light chargino:<ref>{{cite journal\n |others=Updated August 2009 by J.-F.

Since the superpartners of the [[Z boson]] ([[Zino (disambiguation)|zino]]), the [[photon]] ([[photino]]) and the [[higgs boson|neutral higgs]] ([[higgsino]]) have the same quantum numbers, they can [[quantum superposition|mix]] to form four [[eigenstate]]s of the mass operator called \"neutralinos\".  In many models the lightest of the four neutralinos turns out to be the [[lightest supersymmetric particle]] (LSP), though other particles may also take on this role.\n\n==Phenomenology==\nThe exact properties of each neutralino will depend on the details of the mixing<ref name=\"Definition\"/> (e.g. whether they are more higgsino-like or gaugino-like), but they tend to have masses at the weak scale (100&nbsp;GeV ~ 1&nbsp;TeV) and couple to other particles with strengths characteristic of the [[weak nuclear force|weak interaction]]. In this way they are phenomenologically similar to [[neutrinos]], and so are not directly observable in particle detectors at accelerators.\n\nIn models in which [[R-parity]] is conserved and the lightest of the four neutralinos is the LSP, the lightest neutralino is stable and is eventually produced in the decay chain of all other superpartners.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|p=83}}</ref>  In such cases supersymmetric processes at accelerators are characterized by the expectation of a large discrepancy in energy and momentum between the visible initial and final state particles, with this energy being carried off by a neutralino which departs the detector unnoticed.<ref name=\"Feng\">{{cite journal\n  | doi = 10.1146/annurev-astro-082708-101659\n  | last = Feng\n  | first = Jonathan L\n  | journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics\n  | volume = 48\n  | date = 2010\n  | pages = 495–545\n  | arxiv= 1003.0904\n  | title = Dark Matter Candidates from Particle Physics and Methods of Detection |bibcode = 2010ARA&A..48..495F }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv\n  | last1= Ellis\n  | first1= John\n  | authorlink1 = John Ellis (physicist)\n  | last2= Olive\n  | first2= Keith A.\n  | eprint=1001.3651\n  | class=astro-ph\n  | title=Supersymmetric Dark Matter Candidates\n  | date=2010}} Also published as Chapter 8 in {{harvnb|Bertone}}</ref>\nThis is an important signature to discriminate supersymmetry from Standard Model backgrounds. \n\n==Relationship to dark matter==\nAs a heavy, stable particle, the lightest neutralino is an excellent candidate to form the universe's [[cold dark matter]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |others=Revised September 2009 by M.

The idea behind the '''Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model''' is to promote  the <math>\\mu</math> term to a gauge singlet, [[chiral superfield]] <math>S</math>. Note that the scalar superpartner of the singlino <math>S</math> is denoted by <math>\\hat{S}</math> and the spin-1/2 singlino superpartner by <math>\\tilde{S}</math> in the following. The superpotential for the NMSSM is given by\n:<math>W_{\\text{NMSSM}}=W_{\\text{Yuk}}+\\lambda S H_u H_d + \\frac{\\kappa}{3} S^3 </math>\nwhere <math>W_{\\text{Yuk}}</math> gives the Yukawa couplings for the Standard Model fermions. Since the superpotential has a [[mass dimension]] of 3, the couplings <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\kappa</math> are dimensionless; hence the <math>\\mu</math>-problem of the MSSM is solved in the NMSSM, the superpotential of the NMSSM being scale-invariant. The role of the <math>\\lambda</math> term is to generate an effective <math>\\mu</math> term. This is done with the scalar component of the singlet <math>\\hat{S}</math> getting a vacuum-expectation value of <math>\\langle \\hat{S} \\rangle</math>; that is, we have \n:<math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}= \\lambda \\langle \\hat{S} \\rangle </math> \nWithout the <math>\\kappa</math> term the superpotential would have a U(1)' symmetry, so-called Peccei–Quinn symmetry; see [[Peccei–Quinn theory]]. This additional symmetry would alter the phenomenology completely. The role of the <math>\\kappa</math> term is to break this U(1)' symmetry. The <math>\\kappa</math> term is introduced trilinearly such that <math>\\kappa</math> is dimensionless. However, there remains a discrete <math>\\mathbb{Z}_3</math> symmetry, which is moreover broken spontaneously.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Zeldovich |first1=Ya. B.\n |last2=Kobzarev |first2=I.

In the MSSM we encounter five physical Higgs bosons.{{Citation needed||date=July 2014}} Due to the additional singlet <math>\\hat{S}</math> in the NMSSM we have two more Higgs bosons;{{Citation needed||date=July 2014}} that is, in total seven physical Higgs bosons. Its Higgs sector is therefore much richer than that of the MSSM. In particular, the Higgs potential is in general no longer invariant under CP transformations; see [[CP violation]]. Typically, the Higgs bosons in the NMSSM are denoted in an order with increasing masses; that is, by <math>H_1, H_2, ..., H_7</math>, with <math>H_1</math> the lightest Higgs boson. In the special case of a CP-conserving Higgs potential we have three CP even Higgs bosons, <math>H_1, H_2, H_3</math>, two CP odd ones, <math> A_1, A_2</math>, and a pair of charged Higgs bosons, <math>H^+, H^-</math>. In the MSSM, the lightest Higgs boson is always Standard Model-like, and therefore its production and decays are roughly known. In the NMSSM, the lightest Higgs can be very light (even of the order of 1 GeV{{Citation needed||date=July 2014}}), and thus may have escaped detection so far. In addition, in the CP-conserving case, the lightest CP even Higgs boson turns out to have an enhanced lower bound compared with the MSSM.{{Citation needed||date=July 2014}} This is one of the reasons why the NMSSM has been the focus of much attention in recent years.\n\n=== Neutralino phenomenology ===\nThe spin-1/2 singlino <math>\\tilde{S}</math> gives a fifth neutralino, compared with the four neutralinos of the MSSM. The singlino does not couple with any gauge bosons, gauginos (the superpartners of the gauge bosons), leptons, sleptons (the superpartners of the leptons), quarks or squarks (the superpartners of the quarks). Suppose that a supersymmetric partner particle is produced at a collider, for instance at the [[LHC]], the singlino is omitted in cascade decays and therefore escapes detection. However, if the singlino is the [[lightest supersymmetric particle]] (LSP), all supersymmetric partner particles eventually decay into the singlino. Due to [[R parity]] conservation this LSP is stable. In this way the singlino could be detected via missing transverse energy in a detector.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]"

To date, all attempts to observe new phenomena predicted by GUTs (like proton decay or the existence of magnetic monopoles) have failed.\n\n[[Quantum gravity]] (via [[virtual black hole]]s and [[Hawking radiation]]) may also provide a venue of proton decay at magnitudes or lifetimes well beyond the GUT scale decay range above, as well as extra dimensions in [[supersymmetry]].\n\nThere are theoretical methods of baryon violation other than proton decay including interactions with changes of baryon and/or lepton number other than 1 (as required in proton decay). These included [[Baryon number|''B'']] and/or [[Lepton number|''L'']] violations of 2, 3, or other numbers, or [[B − L|''B''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''L'']] violation. Such examples include neutron oscillations and the electroweak [[sphaleron]] [[chiral anomaly|anomaly]] at high energies and temperatures that can result between the collision of protons into antileptons<ref>\"Bloch Wave Function for the Periodic Sphaleron Potential and Unsuppressed Baryon and Lepton Number Violating Processes\",  S.H.

If so, then what is the [[half-life]]? Can [[nuclear binding energy]] affect this?}}\nOne of the outstanding problems in modern physics is the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the [[universe]]. The universe, as a whole, seems to have a nonzero positive baryon number density &ndash; that is, matter exists. Since it is assumed in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] that the particles we see were created using the same physics we measure today, it would normally be expected that the overall baryon number should be zero, as matter and antimatter should have been created in equal amounts. This has led to a number of proposed mechanisms for [[symmetry breaking]] that favour the creation of normal matter (as opposed to antimatter) under certain conditions. This imbalance would have been exceptionally small, on the order of 1 in every {{val|10000000000}} (10<sup>10</sup>) particles a small fraction of a second after the Big Bang, but after most of the matter and antimatter annihilated, what was left over was all the baryonic matter in the current universe, along with a much greater number of [[boson]]s. Experiments reported in 2010 at [[Fermilab]], however, seem to show that this imbalance is much greater than previously assumed. In an experiment involving a series of particle collisions, the amount of generated matter was approximately 1% larger than the amount of generated antimatter. The reason for this discrepancy is yet unknown.<ref>\n{{Cite journal|author=V.M.

The rate at which these events occur is governed largely by the mass of the intermediate {{SubatomicParticle|X boson}} or {{SubatomicParticle|Higgs boson}} particles, so by assuming these reactions are responsible for the majority of the baryon number seen today, a maximum mass can be calculated above which the rate would be too slow to explain the presence of matter today. These estimates predict that a large volume of material will occasionally exhibit a spontaneous proton decay.\n\n== Experimental evidence ==\nProton decay is one of the key predictions of the various grand unified theories (GUTs) proposed in the 1970s, another major one being the existence of [[magnetic monopole]]s. Both concepts have been the focus of major experimental physics efforts since the early 1980s. To date, all attempts to observe these events have failed; however, these experiments have been able to establish lower bounds on the half-life of the proton.

Since the proton lifetime is observed to be greater than 10<sup>33</sup> to 10<sup>34</sup> years (depending on the exact decay channel), this would highly disfavour the model.  R-parity  sets all of the renormalizable baryon and lepton number violating couplings to zero and the proton is stable at the renormalizable level and the lifetime of the proton is increased to 10<sup>32</sup> years and is nearly consistent with current  observational data.\n\nBecause proton decay involves violating both lepton and baryon number simultaneously, no single renormalizable R-parity violating coupling leads to proton decay.

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn [[quantum field theory]], '''Seiberg duality''', conjectured by [[Nathan Seiberg]], is an [[S-duality]] relating two different [[super QCD|supersymmetric QCDs]]. The two theories are not identical, but they agree at low energies.  More precisely under a [[renormalization]] group flow they flow to the same [[IR fixed point]], and so are in the same [[universality class]].\n\nIt was first presented in Seiberg's 1994 article [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9411149 Electric-Magnetic Duality in Supersymmetric Non-Abelian Gauge Theories].  It is an extension to [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] with N=1 supersymmetry of [[Montonen–Olive duality]] in N=4 theories and [[electromagnetic duality]] in [[abelian group|abelian]] theories.\n\n==The statement of Seiberg duality==\n\nSeiberg duality is an equivalence of the [[IR fixed point]]s in an ''N''=1 theory with SU(N<sub>c</sub>) as the [[gauge group]] and N<sub>f</sub> [[flavor (physics)|flavors]] of [[fundamental representation|fundamental]] [[chiral superfield|chiral multiplet]]s and N<sub>f</sub> flavors of [[antifundamental]] chiral multiplets in the [[chiral limit]] (no [[bare mass]]es) and an  N=1 chiral QCD with N<sub>f</sub>-N<sub>c</sub> colors and N<sub>f</sub> flavors, where N<sub>c</sub> and N<sub>f</sub> are positive integers satisfying\n\n::<math>N_f>N_c+1</math>.\n\nA stronger version of the duality relates not only the chiral limit but also the full deformation space of the theory.  In the special case in which\n\n:<math>{1\\over 3}N_f < N_c < {2\\over 3}N_f</math>\n\nthe IR fixed point is a nontrivial interacting [[superconformal algebra|superconformal field theory]]. For a superconformal field theory, the [[anomalous scaling dimension]] of a chiral superfield <math>D=\\frac{3}{2} R</math> where R is the R-charge. This is an exact result.\n\nThe dual theory contains a fundamental \"meson\" chiral superfield M which is color neutral but transforms as a bifundamental under the flavor symmetries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! \n!

In particular, the [[Higgs phase]] is dual to the [[colour confinement|confinement]] phase as in the [[dual superconducting model]].\n\nThe [[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s are preserved by the duality.  However in the electric theory the meson is a quark bilinear (<math>M \\equiv Q^c Q</math>), while in the magnetic theory it is a fundamental field.  In both theories the baryons are constructed from quarks, but the number of quarks in one baryon is the rank of the gauge group, which differs in the two dual theories.\n\nThe [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] of the theories do not agree, which is not problematic as the gauge symmetry is a feature of the formulation and not of the fundamental physics.  The [[global symmetry|global symmetries]] relate distinct physical configurations and so they need to agree in any dual description.\n\n==Evidence for Seiberg duality==\n\nThe [[moduli space]]s of the dual theories are identical.\n\nThe global symmetries agree, as do the charges of the mesons and baryons.\n\nIn certain cases it reduces to ordinary electromagnetic duality.\n\nIt may be embedded in [[string theory]] via [[Hanany-Witten brane cartoon]]s consisting of intersecting [[D-brane]]s.  There it is realized as the motion of an [[NS5-brane]] which is conjectured to preserve the universality class.\n\nSix nontrivial anomalies may be computed on both sides of the duality, and they agree as they must in accordance with [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s [[anomaly matching condition]]s. The role of the additional fundamental meson superfield M in the dual theory is very crucial in matching the anomalies. The global gravitational anomalies also match up as the parity of the number of chiral fields is the same in both theories. The R-charge of the Weyl fermion in a chiral superfield is one less than the R-charge of the superfield. The R-charge of a gaugino is +1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions\n|-\n! anomaly\n!

The identification gives rise to complicated integral identities which have been studied in the mathematical literature.<ref>Dolan et al., Applications of the Superconformal Index for Protected Operators and q-Hypergeometric Identities to N=1 Dual Theories, Nucl.Phys. B818 (2009) 137-178</ref>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nSeiberg duality has been generalized in many directions.  One generalization applies to [[quiver diagram|quiver gauge theories]], in which the [[flavor symmetry|flavor symmetries]] are also gauged.  The simplest of these is a super QCD with the flavor group gauged and an additional term in the [[superpotential]].  It leads to a series of Seiberg dualities known as a [[duality cascade]].  It was introduced by [[Matthew Strassler]] and [[Igor Klebanov]] in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0007191 Supergravity and a Confining Gauge Theory: Duality Cascades and <math>\\chi</math>SB-Resolution of Naked Singularities].\n\nIt is not known whether Seiberg duality exists in 3-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories with only 4 supercharges, although a conjecture has appeared in [https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4924 Fractional M2-branes] in some special cases with [[Chern–Simons theory|Chern–Simons]] terms.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9411149 Electric-Magnetic Duality in Supersymmetric Non-Abelian Gauge Theories] by Nathan Seiberg.\n\n[[Category:Quantum field theory]]\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Duality theories]]"

Each particle has a superpartner with spin that differs by {{sfrac|1|2}}. Fermions in the SM have [[spin-1/2|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] and therefore sfermions have spin 0.\n\nThe name 'sfermion' was formed by the general rule of prefixing an 's' to the name of its superpartner, denoting that it is a [[Scalar boson|'''s'''calar particle]] with spin 0.

      "text": "In [[particle physics]], '''split supersymmetry''' is a proposal for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]].  It was proposed separately in three papers.  The first by James Wells in June 2003 in a more modest form that mildly relaxed the assumption about [[naturalness (physics)|naturalness]] in the Higgs potential.  In May 2004 [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]] and [[Savas Dimopoulos]] argued that naturalness in the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs]] sector may not be an accurate guide to propose new physics beyond the Standard Model and argued that supersymmetry may be realized in a different fashion that preserved [[gauge coupling unification]] and has a [[dark matter]] candidate. In June 2004 [[Gian Francesco Giudice|Gian Giudice]] and Andrea Romanino argued from a general point of view that if one wants gauge coupling unification and a dark matter candidate, that split supersymmetry is one amongst a few theories that exists.\n\nThe new light (~TeV) particles in Split Supersymmetry (beyond the Standard Models particles) are\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto;\"\n|-\n!

There are five couplings in Split Supersymmetry: the Higgs quartic coupling and four Yukawa couplings between the Higgsinos, Higgs and gauginos.  The couplings are set by one parameter, <math>\\tan \\beta</math>, at the scale where the supersymmetric scalars decouple.   Beneath the supersymmetry breaking scale, these five couplings evolve through the [[Beta function (physics)|renormalization group equation]] down to the TeV scale.   At a future [[Linear collider]], these couplings could be measured at the 1% level and then renormalization group evolved up to high energies to show that the theory is supersymmetric at an exceedingly high scale.\n\n== Long Lived Gluinos ==\nThe striking feature of split supersymmetry is that the [[gluino]] becomes a quasi-stable particle with a lifetime that could be up to 100 seconds long.   A gluino that lived longer than this would disrupt [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] or would have been observed as an additional source of cosmic gamma rays.  The gluino  is long lived because it can only decay into a [[squark]] and a [[quark]] and because the squarks are so heavy and these decays are highly suppressed. Thus the [[Particle decay|decay]] rate of the gluino can roughly be estimated, in [[natural units]], as <math>{{m_g}^5\\over {m_{sq}}^4}</math> where <math>m_g</math> is the [[gluino]] [[rest mass]] and <math>m_{sq}</math> the [[squark]] rest mass. For [[gluino]] mass of the order of 1 [[TeV]], the cosmological bound mentioned above sets an upper bound of about <math>10^9</math> [[GeV]] on [[squark]]s masses.\n\nThe potentially long lifetime of the gluino leads to different collider signatures at the [[Tevatron]] and the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. There are three ways to see these particles:\n* Measuring the ratio of momentum to energy or velocity in tracking chambers ( dE/dx in the inner tracking chamber or p/v in the outer muon tracking chamber)\n* Looking for excess singlet jet events that arise from initial or final state radiation.\n* Looking for gluinos that have come to rest inside the detector and later decay. Such an event may occur if the gluino [[hadronize]] to form an exotic [[hadron]] which [[strong interaction|strongly interacts]] with a [[nucleon]] in the detector to create an exotic charged [[hadron]]. The latter will decelerate by [[electromagnetic interaction]] inside the detector and will eventually stop.\n\n==Advantages and drawbacks==\nSplit supersymmetry allows [[Grand unification theory|gauge coupling unification]] as supersymmetry does, because the particles which have masses way beyond the [[TeV]] scale play no major role in the unification. These particles are the [[gravitino]] - which has a small coupling (of order of the [[gravitation]]al interaction) to the other particles, and the scalar partners to the standard model fermions - namely, [[squark]]s and [[slepton]]s. The latter move the [[beta-function]]s of all gauge couplings together, and do not influence their unification, because in the [[grand unification theory]] they form a full [[SU(5)]] [[multiplet]], just like a complete [[Generation (particle physics)|generation]] of particles.\n\nSplit supersymmetry also solves the [[Gravitino#Gravitino cosmological problem|gravitino cosmological problem]], because the [[gravitino]] mass is much higher than [[TeV]].\n\nThe upper bounds on [[proton decay]] rate can also be satisfied because the [[squark]]s are very heavy as well.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike conventional [[supersymmetry]], split supersymmetry does not solve the [[hierarchy problem]] which has been a primary motivation for proposals for new physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] since 1979. One proposal is that the [[hierarchy problem]] is \"solved\" by assuming [[fine-tuning]] due to [[Anthropic principle|anthropic reasons]].\n\n==History==\n{{POV|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe initial attitude of some of the high energy physics community towards split supersymmetry was illustrated by a parody called [[supersplit supersymmetry]].  Often when a new notion in physics is proposed there is a knee-jerk backlash.  When naturalness in the Higgs sector was initially proposed as a motivation for new physics, the notion was not taken seriously.  After the supersymmetric Standard Model was proposed, [[Sheldon Glashow]] quipped that 'half of the particles have already been discovered.'  After 25 years, the notion of naturalness had become so ingrained in the community that proposing a theory that did not use naturalness as the primary motivation was ridiculed.    Split supersymmetry makes predictions that are distinct from both the [[Standard Model]] and the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] and the ultimate nature of the naturalness in the Higgs sector will hopefully be determined at future colliders.\n\nMany of the original proponents of naturalness no longer believe that it should be an exclusive constraint on new physics.  [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]] originally advocated for it, but has recently called it one of his biggest mistakes during his career.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  [[Steven Weinberg]] relaxed the notion of naturalness in the cosmological constant and argued for an environmental explanation for it in 1987.  [[Leonard Susskind]], who initially proposed [[technicolor (physics)|technicolor]],  is a firm advocate of the notion of a landscape and non-naturalness.  [[Savas Dimopoulos]], who initially proposed the supersymmetric Standard Model, proposed split supersymmetry.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]]\n* [[Supersplit supersymmetry]]\n* [[Supersymmetry]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0306127 Implications of Supersymmetry Breaking with a Little Hierarchy between Gauginos and Scalars] by James D.

While the top quark is the heaviest known quark, the stop [[squark]] is actually often the lightest squark in many supersymmetry models.<ref>[http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/new/top/2008/tprop/Stop/Dilepton_Stop_Quark_Search_2Point7invfb.html Search For Pair Production of Stop Quarks Mimicking Top Event Signatures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe stop squark is a key ingredient of a wide range of SUSY models that address the [[hierarchy problem]] of the [[Standard Model]] (SM) in a [[naturalness (physics)|natural]] way.

It is acted on by the  [[super Poincaré algebra]].\n\n==Informal sketch==\nInformally, super Minkowski space can be thought of as the [[super Poincaré algebra]] modulo the algebra of the [[Lorentz group]], in the same way that ordinary [[Minkowski spacetime]] can be viewed as the cosets of the ordinary [[Poincaré algebra]] modulo the action of the Lorentz algebra.  The coset space is naturally [[affine space|affine]], (lacking an origin) and a nilpotent anti-commuting behavior of the fermionic directions arises naturally from the [[Clifford algebra]] associated with the Lorentz group.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe underlying [[supermanifold]] of super Minkowski space is isomorphic to a [[super vector space]] given by the direct sum  of ordinary Minkowski spacetime in ''d'' dimensions (often taken to be 4) and a number ''N'' of real spinor representations of the Lorentz algebra. (When ''d'' is 2 mod 4 this is slightly ambiguous because there are 2 different real spin representations, so one needs to replace ''N'' by a pair of integers ''N''=''N''<sub>1</sub>+''N''<sub>2</sub>, though some authors use a different convention and take ''N'' copies of both spin representations.)\n\nHowever this construction is misleading for two reasons: first, super Minkowski space is really an [[affine space]] over a group rather than a group, or in other words it has no distinguished \"origin\", and second, the underlying [[supergroup (physics)|supergroup]] of translations is not a super vector space but a nilpotent supergroup of nilpotent length 2. This supergroup has the following [[Lie algebra]]. Suppose that ''M'' is Minkowski space, and ''S'' is a finite sum of irreducible real [[spinor representation]]s. Then there is an invariant symmetric bilinear map [,] from ''S''×''S'' to ''M'' that is positive definite in the sense that the image of ''s''×''s'' is in the closed positive cone of ''M'', and is nonzero if ''s'' is nonzero. This bilinear map is unique up to isomorphism. The [[Lie superalgebra]] has ''M'' as its even part, ''S'' as its odd or fermionic part, and the Lie bracket is given by [,] (and the Lie bracket of anything in ''M'' with anything is zero).\n\nThe dimensions of the irreducible real spinor representations for various dimensions ''d'' of spacetime are given by the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Spacetime dimension ''d'' !! Real dimension of spinor representations !! Structure !!

In mathematics, Minkowski spacetime is sometimes specified in the form ''M''<sup>''m''|''n''</sup> where ''m'' is the dimension of the even part and ''n'' the dimension of the odd part. The relation is as follows: the integer ''d'' in the physics notation is the integer ''m'' in the mathematics notation, while the integer ''n'' in the mathematics notation is a power of 2 times the integer ''N'' in the physics notation, where the power of 2 is the dimension of the irreducible real spinor representation (or twice this if there are two irreducible real spinor representations). For example, the ''d''=4, ''N''=1 Minkowski spacetime is ''M''<sup>4|4</sup> while the ''N''=2 Minkowski spacetime is ''M''<sup>4|8</sup>. When the dimension ''d'' or ''m'' is 2 mod 4 there are two different irreducible real spinor representations, and authors use various different conventions.\n\nIn physics the letter ''P''  is used for a basis of the even bosonic part of the Lie superalgebra, and the letter ''Q'' is often used for a basis of the [[complexification]] of the odd fermionic part, so in particular the structure constants of the Lie superalgebra may be complex rather than real. Often the basis elements ''Q'' come in complex conjugate pairs, so the [[real line#In real algebras|real subspace]] can be recovered as the fixed points of complex conjugation.\n\n==References==\n\n* {{Citation | last1=Deligne | first1=Pierre | author1-link=Pierre Deligne | last2=Morgan | first2=John W. | editor1-last=Deligne | editor1-first=Pierre | editor1-link=Pierre Deligne | editor2-last=Etingof | editor2-first=Pavel | editor3-last=Freed | editor3-first=Daniel S. | editor4-last=Jeffrey | editor4-first=Lisa C. | editor5-last=Kazhdan | editor5-first=David | editor6-last=Morgan | editor6-first=John W. | editor7-last=Morrison | editor7-first=David R. | editor8-last=Witten. | editor8-first=Edward | title=Quantum fields and strings: a course for mathematicians, Vol. 1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQIsyvw1KnsC&pg=PA41 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | isbn=978-0-8218-1198-6 | mr=1701597  | year=1999 | chapter=Notes on supersymmetry (following Joseph Bernstein) | pages=41–97}}\n\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]"

      "text": "In [[theoretical physics]], '''super QCD''' is a [[supersymmetric gauge theory]] which resembles [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) but contains additional particles and interactions which render it [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]].\n\nThe most commonly used version of super QCD is in 4 dimensions and contains one [[Majorana spinor]] supercharge.  The particle content consists of [[vector superfield|vector supermultiplets]], which include [[gluon]]s and [[gluino]]s and also [[chiral superfield|chiral supermultiplets]] which contain [[quark]]s and [[squark]]s transforming in the [[fundamental representation]] of the gauge group.  This theory has many features in common with real world QCD, for example in some phases it manifests [[color confinement|confinement]] and [[chiral symmetry breaking]].  The supersymmetry of this theory means that, unlike QCD, one may use [[nonrenormalization theorem]]s to analytically demonstrate the existence of these phenomena and even calculate the [[vacuum expectation value|condensate]] which breaks the chiral symmetry.\n\n==Phases of super QCD==\nConsider 4-dimensional SQCD with gauge group SU(N) and M flavors of chiral multiplets.  The vacuum structure depends on M and N.  The (spin-zero) squarks may be reorganized into [[hadrons]], and the [[moduli space]] of [[vacuum|vacua]] of the theory may be parametrized by their vacuum expectation values.  On most of the moduli space the [[Higgs mechanism]] makes all of the fields massive, and so they may be [[line integral|integrated out]].  Classically, the resulting moduli space is [[Mathematical singularity|singular]].  The singularities correspond to points where some gluons are massless, and so could not be integrated out.  In the full [[quantum field theory|quantum]] moduli space is nonsingular, and its structure depends on the relative values of M and N.  For example, when M is less than or equal to N+1, the theory exhibits confinement.\n\nWhen M is less than N, the [[effective action]] differs from the classical [[action (physics)|action]].  More precisely, while the [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] nonrenormalization theory forbids any perturbative correction to the [[superpotential]], the superpotential receives [[nonperturbative]] corrections.  When N=M+1, these corrections result from a single [[instanton]].  For larger values of N the instanton calculation suffers from infrared divergences, however the correction may nonetheless be determined precisely from the [[gaugino condensation]].  The quantum correction to the superpotential was calculated in [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=PHLTA,B125,487  The Massless Limit Of Supersymmetric Qcd].  If the chiral multiplets are massless, the resulting [[potential energy]] has no minimum and so the full quantum theory has no vacuum.  Instead the fields roll forever to larger values.\n\nWhen M is equal to or greater than N, the classical superpotential is exact.  When M is equal to N, however, the moduli space receives quantum corrections from a single instanton.  This correction renders the moduli space nonsingular, and also leads to chiral symmetry breaking.  Then M is equal to N+1 the moduli space is not modified and so there is no chiral symmetry breaking, however there is still confinement.\n\nWhen M is greater than N+1 but less than 3N/2, the theory is [[asymptotic freedom|asymptotically free]].  However at low energies the theory becomes strongly coupled, and is better described by a [[Seiberg duality|Seiberg dual]] description in terms of [[Montonen–Olive duality|magnetic variables]] with the same global flavor symmetry group but a new gauge symmetry SU(M-N).  Notice that the [[gauge symmetry|gauge group]] is not an [[observable]], but simply reflects the redundancy or a description and so may well differ in various dual theories, as it does in this case.  On the other hand, the [[global symmetry]] group is an observable so it is essential that it is the same, SU(M), in both descriptions.  The dual magnetic theory is free in the [[infrared]], the [[coupling constant]] shrinks logarithmically, and so by the [[Dirac quantization condition]] the electric coupling constant grows logarithmically in the infrared.  This implies that the potential between two electric charges, at long distances, scales as the logarithm of their distance divided by the distance.\n\nWhen M is between 3N/2 and 3N, in the theory has an [[infrared fixed point]] where it becomes a nontrivial [[conformal field theory]].  The potential between electric charges obeys the usual Colomb law, it is inversely proportional to the distance between the charges.\n\nWhen M is greater than 3N, the theory is free in the infrared, and so the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the product of the distance times the logarithm of the distance between the charges.  However the theory is ill-defined in the ultraviolet, unless one includes additional heavy degrees of freedom which lead, for example, to a Seiberg dual theory of the type described above at N+1<M<3N/2.\n\n==References==\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9509066 Lectures on supersymmetric gauge theories and electric-magnetic duality] by [[Nathan Seiberg]] and [[Kenneth Intriligator]].\n\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]"

Since the supercharge operator changes a particle with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] one-half to a particle with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] one or zero, the supercharge itself is a [[spinor]] that carries one half unit of spin.<ref name=\"ss to the rescue\">[http://www.superstringtheory.com/experm/exper4a.html Supersymmetry to the rescue?]</ref>\n\nDepending on the context, supercharges may also be called ''Grassmann variables'' or ''Grassmann directions''; they are generators of the [[exterior algebra]] of anti-commuting numbers, the [[Grassmann number]]s. All these various usages are essentially synonymous; they refer to the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> [[graded (mathematics)|grading]] between bosons and fermions, or equivalently, the grading between ''[[c-number]]s'' and ''a-numbers''.

Supergravity is the [[gauge theory]] of local supersymmetry. Since the supersymmetry (SUSY) generators form together with the [[Poincaré algebra]] a [[superalgebra]], called the [[super-Poincaré algebra]], gauging supersymmetry makes gravity arise in a natural way.<ref name=\"Niewwenhuizen\">P. van Nieuwenhuizen, Phys.

The resulting theories were sometimes referred to as [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein theories]] as Kaluza and Klein constructed in 1919 a 5-dimensional gravitational theory, that when dimensionally reduced on a circle, its 4-dimensional non-massive modes describe [[electromagnetism]] coupled to [[gravity]].\n\n===mSUGRA===\nmSUGRA means minimal SUper GRAvity.

Collectively now known as minimal supergravity Grand Unification Theories (mSUGRA GUT), gravity mediates the breaking of SUSY through the existence of a [[hidden sector]]. mSUGRA naturally generates the Soft SUSY breaking terms which are a consequence of the Super Higgs effect. Radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry through [[Renormalization]] Group Equations (RGEs) follows as an immediate consequence. \nDue to its predictive power, requiring only four input parameters and a sign to determine the low energy phenomenology from the scale of Grand Unification, its interest is a widely investigated model of [[particle physics]]\n{{See also|Minimal_Supersymmetric_Standard_Model#Gravity-Mediated_Supersymmetry_Breaking|label 1=Gravity-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking in the MSSM}}\n\n===11D: the maximal SUGRA===\nOne of these supergravities, the 11-dimensional theory, generated considerable excitement as the first potential candidate for the [[theory of everything]].

Problems included:{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n* The compact manifolds which were known at the time and which contained the standard model were not compatible with supersymmetry, and could not hold [[quark]]s or [[lepton]]s. One suggestion was to replace the compact dimensions with the 7-sphere, with the symmetry group [[SO(8)]], or the squashed 7-sphere, with symmetry group [[SO(5)]] times [[SU(2)]].\n* Until recently, the physical [[neutrino]]s seen in experiments were believed to be massless, and appeared to be left-handed, a phenomenon referred to as the [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of the Standard Model. It was very difficult to construct a chiral fermion from a [[compactification (physics)|compactification]] — the compactified manifold needed to have singularities, but physics near singularities did not begin to be understood until the advent of [[orbifold]] [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] in the late 1980s.\n* Supergravity models generically result in an unrealistically large [[cosmological constant]] in four dimensions, and that constant is difficult to remove, and so require [[fine-tuning]]. This is still a problem today.\n* Quantization of the theory led to quantum field theory [[gauge anomaly|gauge anomalies]] rendering the theory inconsistent. In the intervening years physicists have learned how to cancel these anomalies.\n\nSome of these difficulties could be avoided by moving to a 10-dimensional theory involving [[superstring]]s. However, by moving to 10 dimensions one loses the sense of uniqueness of the 11-dimensional theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/135575466/Laymans-Guide-to-M-Theory-jnl-article-M-Duff-1998-WW-pdf|title=Laymans Guide to M-Theory  [jnl article] - M.

There were too many [[Calabi–Yau]]s to [[Compactification (physics)|compactify]] on, many more than [[Shing-Tung Yau|Yau]] had estimated, as he admitted in December 2005 at the [[23rd International Solvay Conference in Physics]]. None quite gave the standard model, but it seemed as though one could get close with enough effort in many distinct ways. Plus no one understood the theory beyond the regime of applicability of string [[perturbation theory]].\n\nThere was a comparatively quiet period at the beginning of the 1990s; however, several important tools were developed. For example, it became apparent that the various superstring theories were related by \"[[string dualities]]\", some of which relate weak string-coupling - perturbative - physics in one model with strong string-coupling - non-perturbative - in another.\n\nThen the [[second superstring revolution]] occurred. [[Joseph Polchinski]] realized that obscure string theory objects, called [[D-branes]], which he discovered six years earlier, equate to stringy versions of the [[p-branes]] known in supergravity theories. String theory perturbation didn't restrict these [[p-branes]]. Thanks to [[supersymmetry]], p-branes in supergravity gained understanding well beyond the limits of string theory.\n\nArmed with this new [[nonperturbative]] tool, [[Edward Witten]] and many others could show all of the perturbative string theories as descriptions of different states in a single theory that Witten named [[M-theory]]. Furthermore, he argued that M-theory's [[Long Wavelength Limit|long wavelength limit]], i.e. when the quantum wavelength associated to objects in the theory appear much larger than the size of the 11th dimension, need 11-dimensional supergravity descriptors that fell out of favor with the [[first superstring revolution]] 10 years earlier, accompanied by the 2- and 5-branes.\n\nTherefore, supergravity comes full circle and uses a common framework in understanding features of string theories, M-theory, and their [[Compactification (physics)|compactifications]] to lower spacetime dimensions.\n\n==Relation to superstrings==\nThe term \"low energy limits\" labels some 10-dimensional supergravity theories.  These arise as the massless, [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]-level approximation of string theories. True [[effective field theories]] of string theories, rather than truncations, are rarely available. Due to string dualities, the conjectured 11-dimensional [[M-theory]] is required to have 11-dimensional supergravity as a \"low energy limit\". However, this doesn't necessarily mean that string theory/M-theory is the only possible [[UV completion]] of supergravity;{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} supergravity research is useful independent of those relations.\n\n== 4D ''N'' = 1 SUGRA ==\nBefore we move on to SUGRA proper, let's recapitulate some important details about [[general relativity]]. We have a 4D differentiable manifold M with a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over it. This principal bundle represents the local Lorentz symmetry. In addition, we have a vector bundle T over the manifold with the fiber having four real dimensions and transforming as a vector under Spin(3,1).\nWe have an invertible linear map from the tangent bundle TM to T. This map is the [[vierbein]]. The local Lorentz symmetry has a [[gauge connection]] associated with it, the [[spin connection]].\n\nThe following discussion will be in superspace notation, as opposed to the component notation, which isn't manifestly covariant under SUSY. There are actually ''many'' different versions of SUGRA out there which are inequivalent in the sense that their actions and constraints upon the torsion tensor are different, but ultimately equivalent in that we can always perform a field redefinition of the supervierbeins and spin connection to get from one version to another.\n\nIn 4D N=1 SUGRA, we have a 4|4 real differentiable supermanifold M, i.e. we have 4 real bosonic dimensions and 4 real fermionic dimensions. As in the nonsupersymmetric case, we have a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over M. We have an '''R'''<sup>4|4</sup> vector bundle T over M. The fiber of T transforms under the local Lorentz group as follows; the four real bosonic dimensions transform as a vector and the four real fermionic dimensions transform as a Majorana spinor. This Majorana spinor can be reexpressed as a complex left-handed Weyl spinor and its complex conjugate right-handed Weyl spinor (they're not independent of each other). We also have a spin connection as before.\n\nWe will use the following conventions; the spatial (both bosonic and fermionic) indices will be indicated by M, N, ... . The bosonic spatial indices will be indicated by μ, ν, ..., the left-handed Weyl spatial indices by α, β,..., and the right-handed Weyl spatial indices by <math>\\dot{\\alpha}</math>, <math>\\dot{\\beta}</math>, ... . The indices for the fiber of T will follow a similar notation, except that they will be hatted like this: <math>\\hat{M},\\hat{\\alpha}</math>. See [[van der Waerden notation]] for more details. <math>M = (\\mu,\\alpha,\\dot{\\alpha})</math>. The supervierbein is denoted by <math>e^{\\hat{M}}_N</math>, and the spin connection by <math>\\omega_{\\hat{M}\\hat{N}P}</math>. The ''inverse'' supervierbein is denoted by <math>E^N_{\\hat{M}}</math>.\n\nThe supervierbein and spin connection are real in the sense that they satisfy the reality conditions\n:<math>e^{\\hat{M}}_N (x,\\overline{\\theta},\\theta)^* = e^{\\hat{M}^*}_{N^*}(x,\\theta,\\overline{\\theta})</math> where <math>\\mu^*=\\mu</math>, <math>\\alpha^*=\\dot{\\alpha}</math>, and <math>\\dot{\\alpha}^*=\\alpha</math> and <math>\\omega(x,\\overline{\\theta},\\theta)^*=\\omega(x,\\theta,\\overline{\\theta})</math>.\n\nThe [[covariant derivative]] is defined as\n:<math>D_\\hat{M}f=E^N_{\\hat{M}}\\left( \\partial_N f + \\omega_N[f] \\right)</math>.\n\nThe [[covariant exterior derivative]] as defined over supermanifolds needs to be super graded. This means that every time we interchange two fermionic indices, we pick up a +1 sign factor, instead of -1.\n\nThe presence or absence of [[R-symmetry|R symmetries]] is optional, but if R-symmetry exists, the integrand over the full superspace has to have an R-charge of 0 and the integrand over chiral superspace has to have an R-charge of 2.\n\nA chiral superfield ''X'' is a superfield which satisfies <math>\\overline{D}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}X=0</math>. In order for this constraint to be consistent, we require the integrability conditions that <math>\\left\\{ \\overline{D}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}, \\overline{D}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\beta}}} \\right\\} = c_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}\\hat{\\dot{\\beta}}}^{\\hat{\\dot{\\gamma}}} \\overline{D}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\gamma}}}</math> for some coefficients ''c''.\n\nUnlike nonSUSY GR, the [[torsion tensor|torsion]] has to be nonzero, at least with respect to the fermionic directions. Already, even in flat superspace, <math>D_{\\hat{\\alpha}}e_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}+\\overline{D}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}e_{\\hat{\\alpha}} \\neq 0</math>.\nIn one version of SUGRA (but certainly not the only one), we have the following constraints upon the torsion tensor:\n:<math>T^{\\hat{\\underline{\\gamma}}}_{\\hat{\\underline{\\alpha}}\\hat{\\underline{\\beta}}} = 0</math>\n:<math>T^{\\hat{\\mu}}_{\\hat{\\alpha}\\hat{\\beta}} = 0</math>\n:<math>T^{\\hat{\\mu}}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}\\hat{\\dot{\\beta}}} = 0</math>\n:<math>T^{\\hat{\\mu}}_{\\hat{\\alpha}\\hat{\\dot{\\beta}}} = 2i\\sigma^{\\hat{\\mu}}_{\\hat{\\alpha}\\hat{\\dot{\\beta}}}</math>\n:<math>T^{\\hat{\\nu}}_{\\hat{\\mu}\\hat{\\underline{\\alpha}}} = 0</math>\n:<math>T^{\\hat{\\rho}}_{\\hat{\\mu}\\hat{\\nu}} = 0</math>\nHere, <math>\\underline{\\alpha}</math> is a shorthand notation to mean the index runs over either the left or right Weyl spinors.\n\nThe [[superdeterminant]] of the supervierbein, <math>\\left| e \\right|</math>, gives us the volume factor for M. Equivalently, we have the volume 4|4-superform<math>e^{\\hat{\\mu}=0}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e^{\\hat{\\mu}=3} \\wedge e^{\\hat{\\alpha}=1} \\wedge e^{\\hat{\\alpha}=2} \\wedge e^{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}=1} \\wedge e^{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}=2}</math>.\n\nIf we complexify the superdiffeomorphisms, there is a gauge where <math>E^{\\mu}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}=0</math>, <math>E^{\\beta}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}=0</math> and <math>E^{\\dot{\\beta}}_{\\hat{\\dot{\\alpha}}}=\\delta^{\\dot{\\beta}}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}</math>. The resulting chiral superspace has the coordinates x and Θ.\n\n''R'' is a scalar valued chiral superfield derivable from the supervielbeins and spin connection. If ''f'' is any superfield, <math>\\left( \\bar{D}^2 - 8R \\right) f</math> is always a chiral superfield.\n\nThe action for a SUGRA theory with chiral superfields ''X'', is given by\n:<math>S = \\int d^4x d^2\\Theta 2\\mathcal{E}\\left[ \\frac{3}{8} \\left( \\bar{D}^2 - 8R \\right) e^{-K(\\bar{X},X)/3} + W(X) \\right] + c.c.</math>\nwhere ''K'' is the [[Kähler potential]] and ''W'' is the [[superpotential]], and <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> is the chiral volume factor.\n\nUnlike the case for flat superspace, adding a constant to either the Kähler or superpotential is now physical. A constant shift to the Kähler potential changes the effective [[Planck constant]], while a constant shift to the superpotential changes the effective [[cosmological constant]]. As the effective Planck constant now depends upon the value of the chiral superfield ''X'', we need to rescale the supervierbeins (a field redefinition) to get a constant Planck constant. This is called the '''Einstein frame'''.\n\n== N = 8 supergravity in 4 dimensions ==\n[[N=8 Supergravity]] is the most [[symmetric]] quantum field theory which involves gravity and a finite number of fields. It can be found from a dimensional reduction of 11D supergravity by making the size of 7 of the dimensions go to zero. It has 8 supersymmetries which is the most any gravitational theory can have since there are 8 half-steps between spin 2 and spin -2. (A graviton has the highest spin in this theory which is a spin 2 particle). More supersymmetries would mean the particles would have superpartners with spins higher than 2. The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as String Theory and Higher-Spin Theories). [[Stephen Hawking]] in his ''A Brief History of Time'' speculated that this theory could be the [[Theory of Everything]]. However, in later years this was abandoned in favour of String Theory. There has been renewed interest in the 21st century with the possibility that this theory may be finite.\n\n== Higher-dimensional SUGRA ==\n{{Main|Higher-dimensional supergravity}}\nHigher-dimensional SUGRA is the higher-dimensional, supersymmetric generalization of general relativity. Supergravity can be formulated in any number of dimensions up to eleven. Higher-dimensional SUGRA focuses upon supergravity in greater than four dimensions.\n\nThe number of supercharges in a [[spinor]] depends on the dimension and the signature of spacetime. The supercharges occur in spinors. Thus the limit on the number of supercharges cannot be satisfied in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Some theoretical examples in which this is satisfied are:\n\n* 12-dimensional two-time theory\n* 11-dimensional maximal SUGRA\n* 10-dimensional SUGRA theories\n** Type IIA SUGRA: N = (1, 1)\n** IIA SUGRA from 11d SUGRA\n** Type IIB SUGRA: N = (2, 0)\n** Type I gauged SUGRA: N = (1, 0)\n* 9d SUGRA theories\n** Maximal 9d SUGRA from 10d\n** T-duality\n** N = 1 Gauged SUGRA\n\nThe supergravity theories that have attracted the most interest contain no spins higher than two. This means, in particular, that they do not contain any fields that transform as symmetric tensors of rank higher than two under Lorentz transformations. The consistency of interacting higher spin field theories is, however, presently a field of very active interest.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n* [[General relativity]]\n* [[Grand Unified Theory]]\n* [[M-theory]]\n* [[N=8 Supergravity]]\n* [[Quantum mechanics]]\n* [[String Theory]]\n* [[Supermanifold]]\n* [[Super-Poincaré algebra]]\n* [[Supersymmetry]]\n* [[Supermetric]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Historical===\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = P. | last2 = Arnowitt | first2 = R. | year = 1975 | title = Generalized Super-Gauge Symmetry as a New Framework for Unified Gauge Theories | url = | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 56 | issue = 2| page = 177 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(75)90297-x| bibcode = 1975PhLB...56..177N }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Freedman | first1 = D.Z. | last2 = van Nieuwenhuizen | first2 = P. | last3 = Ferrara | first3 = S. | year = 1976 | title = Progress Toward A Theory Of Supergravity | url = | journal = Physical Review | volume = D13 | issue = 12| pages = 3214–3218 | doi=10.1103/physrevd.13.3214| bibcode = 1976PhRvD..13.3214F }}\n* E.

      "text": "In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], '''supermanifolds''' are generalizations of the [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] concept based on ideas coming from [[supersymmetry]]. Several definitions are in use, some of which are described below.\n\n== Informal definition ==\nAn informal definition is commonly used in physics textbooks and introductory lectures. It defines a '''supermanifold''' as a [[manifold]] with both [[boson]]ic and [[fermion]]ic coordinates.  Locally, it is composed of [[Atlas (topology)|coordinate charts]] that make it look like a \"flat\", \"Euclidean\" [[superspace]]. These local coordinates are often denoted by\n\n:<math>(x,\\theta,\\bar{\\theta})</math>\n\nwhere ''x'' is the (real-number-valued) [[spacetime]] coordinate, and <math>\\theta\\,</math> and <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math> are [[Grassmann number|Grassmann-valued]] spatial \"directions\".\n\nThe physical interpretation of the Grassmann-valued coordinates are the subject of debate; explicit experimental searches for [[supersymmetry]] have not yielded any positive results.  However, the use of Grassmann variables allow for the tremendous simplification of a number of important mathematical results. This includes, among other things a compact definition of [[functional integral]]s, the proper treatment of ghosts in [[BRST quantization]], the cancellation of infinities in [[quantum field theory]], Witten's work on the [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]], and more recent applications to [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].\n\nThe use of Grassmann-valued coordinates has spawned the field of [[supermathematics]], wherein large portions of geometry can be generalized to super-equivalents, including much of [[Riemannian geometry]] and most of the theory of [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s (such as [[Lie superalgebra]]s, ''etc.'') However, issues remain, including the proper extension of [[deRham cohomology]] to supermanifolds.\n\n== Definition ==\nThree different definitions of supermanifolds are in use.  One definition is as a sheaf over a ringed space; this is sometimes called the \"algebro-geometric approach\".<ref name=\"rogers\">[[Alice Rogers]], ''Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications'', World Scientific, (2007) {{ISBN|978-981-3203-21-1}} ''(See [http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/suppl/10.1142/1878/suppl_file/1878_chap01.pdf Chapter 1])''</ref> This approach has a mathematical elegance, but can be problematic in various calculations and intuitive understanding. A second approach can be called a \"concrete approach\";<ref name=\"rogers\"/> as it is capable of simply and naturally generalizing a broad class of concepts from ordinary mathematics. It requires the use of an infinite number of supersymmetric generators in its definition; however, all but a finite number of these generators carry no content, as the concrete approach requires the use of a coarse topology that renders almost all of them equivalent. Surprisingly, these two definitions,  one with a finite number of supersymmetric generators, and one with an infinite number of generators, are equivalent.<ref name=\"rogers\"/><ref name=\"rogers-8\">Rogers, ''Op. Cit.'' ''(See Chapter 8.)''</ref>\n\nA third approach describes a supermanifold as a [[base topos]] of a [[superpoint]]. This approach remains the topic of active research.<ref>{{nlab|id=supermanifold}}</ref>\n\n===Algebro-geometric: as a sheaf===\nAlthough supermanifolds are special cases of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative manifolds]], their local structure makes them better suited to study with the tools of standard [[differential geometry]] and [[locally ringed space]]s.\n\nA supermanifold '''M''' of dimension ''(p,q)'' is a [[topological space]] ''M'' with a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[superalgebra]]s, usually denoted ''O<sub>'''M'''</sub>'' or C<sup>∞</sup>('''M'''), that is locally isomorphic to <math>C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^p)\\otimes\\Lambda^\\bullet(\\xi_1,\\dots\\xi_q)</math>, where the latter is a Grassmann algebra on ''q'' generators.\n\nA supermanifold '''M''' of dimension ''(1,1)'' is sometimes called a [[super-Riemann surface]].\n\nHistorically, this approach is associated with [[Felix Berezin]], [[Dimitry Leites]], and [[Bertram Kostant]].\n\n===Concrete: as a smooth manifold===\nA different definition describes a supermanifold in a fashion that is similar to that of a [[smooth manifold]], except that the model space <math>\\mathbb{R}^p</math> has been replaced by the ''model superspace'' <math>\\mathbb{R}^p_c\\times\\mathbb{R}^q_a</math>.\n\nTo correctly define this, it is necessary to explain what <math>\\mathbb{R}_c</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}_a</math> are. These are given as the even and odd real subspaces of the one-dimensional space of [[Grassmann number]]s, which, by convention, are generated by a countably infinite number of anti-commuting variables: i.e. the one-dimensional space is given by <math>\\mathbb{C}\\otimes\\Lambda(V),</math> where ''V'' is infinite-dimensional.  An element ''z'' is termed ''real'' if <math>z=z^*</math>; real elements consisting of only an even number of Grassmann generators form the space  <math>\\mathbb{R}_c</math> of ''c-numbers'', while real elements consisting of only an odd number of Grassmann generators form the space  <math>\\mathbb{R}_a</math> of ''a-numbers''. Note that c-numbers commute, while ''a-numbers'' anti-commute. The spaces <math>\\mathbb{R}^p_c</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^q_a</math> are then defined as the ''p''-fold and ''q''-fold Cartesian products of <math>\\mathbb{R}_c</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}_a</math>.<ref name=\"dewitt\">[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', (1984) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521 42377 5}} ''(See chapter 2.)''</ref>\n\nJust as in the case of an ordinary manifold, the supermanifold is then defined as a collection of [[atlas (topology)|charts]] glued together with differentiable transition functions.<ref name=\"dewitt\"/> This definition in terms of charts requires that the transition functions have a [[smooth structure]] and a non-vanishing [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]].  This can only be accomplished if the individual charts use a [[topological space|topology]] that is [[comparison of topologies|considerably coarser]] than the vector-space topology on the Grassmann algebra. This topology is obtained by projecting <math>\\mathbb{R}^p_c</math> down to <math>\\mathbb{R}^p</math> and then using the natural topology on that. The resulting topology is ''not'' [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], but may be termed \"projectively Hausdorff\".<ref name=\"dewitt\"/>\n\nThat this definition is equivalent to the first one is not at all obvious; however, it is the use of the coarse topology that makes it so, by rendering most of the \"points\" identical.  That is, <math>\\mathbb{R}^p_c\\times\\mathbb{R}^q_a</math> with the coarse topology is essentially isomorphic<ref name=\"rogers\"/><ref name=\"rogers-8\"/> to <math>\\mathbb{R}^p\\otimes\\Lambda^\\bullet(\\xi_1,\\dots\\xi_q)</math>\n\nHistorically, this approach is associated with [[Alice Rogers]], [[Bryce DeWitt]] and work by Jadczyk and Pilch.<ref>A. Jadczyk, K. Pilch, \"[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103908693 Superspaces and supersymmetries]\". ''Comm. Math. Phys.'' '''78''' (1980), no. 3, pp373--390.</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\nUnlike a regular manifold, a supermanifold is not entirely composed of a set of points.  Instead, one takes the dual point of view that the structure of a supermanifold '''M''' is contained in its sheaf ''O<sub>'''M'''</sub>'' of \"smooth functions\".  In the dual point of view, an injective map corresponds to a surjection of sheaves, and a surjective map corresponds to an injection of sheaves.\n\nAn alternative approach to the dual point of view is to use the [[functor of points]].\n\nIf '''M''' is a supermanifold of dimension ''(p,q)'', then the underlying space ''M'' inherits the structure of a [[differentiable manifold]] whose sheaf of smooth functions is ''O<sub>'''M'''</sub>/I'', where ''I'' is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by all odd functions.  Thus ''M'' is called the underlying space, or the body, of '''M'''.  The quotient map ''O<sub>'''M'''</sub>'' → ''O<sub>'''M'''</sub>/I'' corresponds to an injective map ''M'' → '''M'''; thus ''M'' is a submanifold of '''M'''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* Let ''M'' be a manifold.  The ''odd tangent bundle'' ΠT''M'' is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Ω(''M'') of differential forms on ''M''.\n* More generally, let ''E'' → ''M'' be a [[vector bundle]].  Then Π''E'' is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Γ(ΛE<sup>*</sup>).  In fact, Π is a [[functor]] from the category of vector bundles to the category of supermanifolds.\n* [[supergroup (physics)|Lie supergroups]] are examples of supermanifolds.\n\n==Batchelor's theorem==\n\nBatchelor's theorem states that every supermanifold is noncanonically isomorphic to a supermanifold of the form Π''E''.  The word \"noncanonically\" prevents one from concluding that supermanifolds are simply glorified vector bundles; although the functor Π maps surjectively onto the isomorphism classes of supermanifolds, it is not an equivalence of categories.\n\nThe proof of Batchelor's theorem relies in an essential way on the existence of a [[partition of unity]], so it does not hold for complex or real-analytic supermanifolds.\n\n== Odd symplectic structures ==\n\n=== Odd symplectic form ===\n\nIn many physical and geometric applications, a supermanifold comes equipped with an Grassmann-odd [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]]. All natural geometric objects on a supermanifold are graded. In particular, the bundle of two-forms is equipped with a grading. An odd symplectic form ω on a supermanifold is a closed, odd form, inducing a non-degenerate pairing on ''TM''. Such a supermanifold is called a [[P-manifold]]. Its graded dimension is necessarily ''(n,n)'', because the odd symplectic form induces a pairing of odd and even variables. There is a version of the Darboux theorem for P-manifolds, which allows one\nto equip a P-manifold locally with a set of coordinates where the odd symplectic form ω is written as \n:<math>\\omega = \\sum_{i}  d\\xi_i \\wedge dx_i , </math>\nwhere <math>x_i</math> are even coordinates, and <math>\\xi_i</math> odd coordinates. (An odd symplectic form should not be confused with a Grassmann-even [[symplectic manifold|symplectic form]] on a supermanifold. In contrast, the Darboux version of an even symplectic form is\n:<math>\\sum_i dp_i \\wedge dq_i+\\sum_j \\frac{\\varepsilon_j}{2}(d\\xi_j)^2, </math>\nwhere <math>p_i,q_i</math> are even coordinates, <math>\\xi_i</math>  odd coordinates and <math>\\varepsilon_j</math> are either +1 or -1.)\n\n===Antibracket===\nGiven an odd symplectic 2-form ω one may define a [[Poisson bracket]] known as the '''antibracket''' of any two functions ''F'' and ''G'' on a supermanifold by\n\n::<math>\\{F,G\\}=\\frac{\\partial_rF}{\\partial z^i}\\omega^{ij}(z)\\frac{\\partial_lG}{\\partial z^j}.</math>\n\nHere <math>\\partial_r</math> and <math>\\partial_l</math> are the right and left [[derivative]]s respectively and ''z'' are the coordinates of the supermanifold.  Equipped with this bracket, the algebra of functions on a supermanifold becomes an [[antibracket algebra]].\n\nA [[coordinate transformation]] that preserves the antibracket is called a [[P-transformation]].  If the [[Berezinian]] of a P-transformation is equal to one then it is called an [[SP-transformation]].\n\n===P and SP-manifolds===\n\nUsing the [[Darboux theorem]] for odd symplectic forms one can show that P-manifolds are constructed from open sets of superspaces <math>{\\mathcal{R}}^{n|n}</math> glued together by P-transformations.  A manifold is said to be an [[SP-manifold]] if these transition functions can be chosen to be SP-transformations.  Equivalently one may define an SP-manifold as a supermanifold with a nondegenerate odd 2-form ω and a [[density function]]  ρ such that on each [[coordinate patch]] there exist [[Darboux coordinates]] in which ρ is identically equal to one.\n\n===Laplacian===\nOne may define a [[Laplacian operator]] Δ on an SP-manifold as the operator which takes a function ''H'' to one half of the [[divergence]] of the corresponding [[Hamiltonian vector field]].  Explicitly one defines\n\n:::<math>\\Delta H=\\frac{1}{2\\rho}\\frac{\\partial_r}{\\partial z^a}\\left(\\rho\\omega^{ij}(z)\\frac{\\partial_l H}{\\partial z^j}\\right)</math>.\n\nIn Darboux coordinates this definition reduces to\n::::<math>\\Delta=\\frac{\\partial_r}{\\partial x^a}\\frac{\\partial_l}{\\partial \\theta_a}</math>\n\nwhere ''x''<sup>a</sup> and θ<sub>a</sub> are even and odd coordinates such that\n\n::::<math>\\omega=dx^a\\wedge d\\theta_a</math>.\n\nThe Laplacian is odd and nilpotent\n\n::::<math>\\Delta^2=0</math>.\n\nOne may define the [[cohomology]] of functions ''H'' with respect to the Laplacian.  In [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9205088 Geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization], [[Albert Schwarz]] has proven that the integral of a function ''H'' over a [[Lagrangian submanifold]] ''L'' depends only on the cohomology class of ''H'' and on the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] class of the body of ''L'' in the body of the ambient supermanifold.\n\n== SUSY ==\n\nA pre-SUSY-structure on a supermanifold of dimension\n''(n,m)'' is an odd ''m''-dimensional\ndistribution <math> P\\subset TM</math>.\nWith such a distribution one associates\nits Frobenius tensor <math> S^2 P \\mapsto TM/P</math>\n(since ''P'' is odd, the skew-symmetric Frobenius\ntensor is a symmetric operation).\nIf this tensor is non-degenerate,\ne.g. lies in an open orbit of \n<math>GL(P)\\times GL(TM/P)</math>,\n''M'' is called ''a SUSY-manifold''.\nSUSY-structure in dimension ''(1, k)''\nis the same as odd [[contact manifold|contact structure]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Superspace]]\n*[[Supersymmetry]]\n*[[Supergeometry]]\n*[[Graded manifold]]\n*[[Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Joseph Bernstein, \"[http://www.math.ias.edu/QFT/fall/ Lectures on Supersymmetry (notes by Dennis Gaitsgory)]\", ''Quantum Field Theory program at IAS: Fall Term''\n* A.

      "title": "Supermembranes",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermembranes",
      "text": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2018}}{{String theory}}\n'''Supermembranes''' are hypothesized objects that live in the 11-dimensional theory called [[M-Theory]] and should also exist in 11-dimensional [[supergravity]]. Supermembranes are a generalisation of [[superstrings]] to another dimension. Supermembranes are 2-dimensional surfaces. For example, they can be spherical or shaped like a [[torus]]. As in [[superstring]] theory the vibrations of the supermembranes correspond to different particles. Supermembranes also exhibit a symmetry called [[supersymmetry]] without which the vibrations would only correspond to [[bosons]] and not [[fermions]].\n\n==Energy==\nThe energy of a classical supermembrane is given by its surface area. One consequence of this is that there is no difference between one or two membranes since two membranes can be connected by a long 1 dimensional string of zero area. Hence, the idea of 'membrane-number' has no meaning. A second consequence is that unlike strings a supermembrane's vibrations can represent several particles at once. In technical terms this means it is already 'second-quantized'. All the particles in the Universe can be thought to arise as vibrations of a single membrane.\n\n==Spectrum==\nWhen going from the classical theory to the quantum theory of supermembranes it is found that they can only exist in 11 dimensions, just as superstrings can only exist in 10 dimensions. When examining the energy spectrum (the allowed frequencies that a string can vibrate in) it was found that they can only be in discrete values corresponding to the masses of different particles.\n\nIt has been shown:\n\n* The energy spectrum for the classical bosonic membrane is continuous.\n* The energy spectrum for the quantum bosonic membrane is discrete.\n* The energy spectrum for the quantum supermembrane is continuous.\n\nAt first the discovery that the spectrum was continuous was thought to mean the theory didn't make sense. But it was realised that it meant that supermembranes actually correspond to multiple particles. (The continuous degrees of freedom corresponding to the coordinates/momenta of the additional particles).\n\n==Action==\nThe action for a classical membrane is simply the surface area of the world sheet. The quantum version is harder to write down, is non-linear and very difficult to solve. Unlike the superstring action which is quadratic, the supermembrane action is quartic which makes it exponentially harder. Adding to this the fact that a membrane can represent many particles at once not much progress has been made on supermembranes.\n\n==Low energy sector==\nIt has been proven that the low energy vibrations of the supermembrane correspond to the particles in 11 dimensional supergravity.\n\n==Topology==\nA supermembrane can have multiple thing tubes or strings coming out of it with little or no extra energy cost since strings, for example, have no area. This means that all orientable topologies of membranes are physically the same. Also, joined and disjointed supermembranes are physically the same. Thus the topology of a supermembrane has no physical meaning.\n\n==Mathematics==\nThe infinite supermembrane can be described in terms of an infinite number of patches. The coordinates of (each patch of) a supermembrane at any casual slice of time are 11 dimensional and depend on two continuous parameters <math>(\\sigma,\\theta)</math> and a third integer parameter (k) denoting the patch number:\n\n:<math>X^k_\\mu(\\sigma,\\theta) = x^k_\\mu + O(\\sigma,\\theta)</math>\n\nTherefore the super membrane can describe an infinite number of particles if we associate somehow the coordinate of each particle with some topological property of the patches - perhaps holes in the membrane or closed loops.\n\n==Supermembrane Field Theory==\nSince supermembranes correspond to multiple particles the field theory of membranes correspond to a [[Fock space]]. Informally, let '''a'''(x) denote the continuous degrees of freedom in the energy spectrum:\n\n:<math>\\Phi[X] = \\Phi[x,\\mathbf{a},..] = \\phi(x) + \\int \\mathbf{a}(y) \\phi(x,y) dy + \\int \\mathbf{a}(y)\\mathbf{a}(z) \\phi(x,y,z)dydz + ... </math>\n\nThe action can be written as\n\n:<math> S = \\int \\Phi[X] \\mathbf{Q} \\Phi[X] D[X]</math>\n\nwhere '''Q''' is the kinetic operator. No interaction terms are needed since there is no concept of membrane number. Everything is the same membrane. The action is not quite the same type as the one for superstrings or particles since it involves terms with multiple particles. The terms relating to single fields must recover the classical field equations of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. The [[propagator]] to get from a state with membrane '''X''' to one at another conformal slice with membrane '''Y''' is:\n\n:<math> G(X,Y) = \\mathbf{Q^{-1}}(X,Y) </math>\n\nAnd since each membrane corresponds to any number of identical particles this is equivalent to all the Green's functions for many particle collisions at once!\n\nAlthough it looks like a lot of things simplify in the supermembrane picture, the actual form of the kinetic operator '''Q''' is yet unknown and must be a very complicated operator acting on an infinite Fock-like space. Hence the seeming simplicity of the theory is hidden in this operator.\n\n==Cosmology==\n{{Expand section|further explanation and additional citations|date=January 2018}}\nSince the vibrations of a supermembrane of infinite energy can correspond to every particle in the Universe at once it is possible to interpret the supermembrane as equivalent to the Universe. i.e. all that exists is the supermembrane. It makes no difference to say we live on this supermembrane or that we are in 11 dimensional space-time. Every state of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane and every history of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane world volume. What we think of as space-time coordinates can equally be thought of as vector fields on the 2+1 dimensional supermembrane.\n\nFor a supermembrane moving at the speed of light, its world volume can be zero due to the metric (+++-){{clarify|date=January 2018}}. Thus the Big Bang can be thought of as a spherical membrane expanding at the speed of light. This has interesting interpretations in terms of the [[holographic principle]].\n\n==Geometry==\nBecause the supermembrane(s) correspond to all particles at a particular causal time slice, it also corresponds to all the gravitons particles (which are particular vibrational modes). Thus the geometry of the 2+1D supermembrane contains within it the description of the geometry of the (macroscopic) 10+1D space-time. But as it is a quantum theory it gives probabilities for different space-times consistent with observation. The different space-times may only differ microscopically whereas the macroscopic space-time is smooth. In other words, the geometry of the membrane determines the geometry of (macroscopic) space-time. This is different from string theory where only condensates of many separate strings can macroscopically determine the space-time.\n\n==Super-5-branes==\nM-Theory and 11D supergravity also predict 5+1D objects called super-5-[[branes]]. An alternative cosmological theory is that we live on one of these branes.\n\n==Compactification==\nCompactifying one space-time dimension on a circle and wrapping the membrane around this circle gives us superstring theory. To get back to our 3+1 dimensional universe the space-time coordinates need to be compactified on a 7 dimensional manifold (of G2 holonomy). Not much is known about these types of shapes.\n\n==Matrix Theory==\n[[Matrix string theory|Matrix theory]] is a particular way of formulating supermembrane theory. It is still in development. The diagonal entries of an infinite dimensional matrix can be thought of as different supermembranes (parts) connected by 1 dimensional strings.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jansson|first=Ronnie|title=The Membrane Vacuum State|year=2003}} [http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~rj486/files/Msc_thesis_RJansson.pdf The Membrane Vacuum State]\n*{{cite book|last=Howe,Sezgin|title=The supermembrane revisited\n|year=2005}} [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0412245v2.pdf The supermembrane revisited]\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]"

However, supergravity introduced in [[SUSY]] gauge theory has no geometric feature as a supermetric.\n\nIn [[gauge theory]] on a [[principal bundle]] <math> P\\to M </math> with a structure group <math>K</math>, spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterized as a [[reduction of the structure group | reduction]] of <math>K</math> to some closed subgroup <math>H</math>. By the well-known theorem, such a reduction takes place if and only if there exists a global section <math>h</math> of the quotient bundle <math>P/H\\to M</math>. This section is treated as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]].\n\nIn particular, this is the case of [[gauge gravitation theory]] where <math>P=FM</math> is a principal [[frame bundle]] of linear frames in the [[tangent bundle]] <math>TM</math> of a [[world manifold]] <math>M</math>. In accordance with the [[equivalence principle (geometric)| geometric equivalence principle]], its structure group <math>GL(n,\\mathbb R) </math> is reduced to the [[Lorentz group]] <math>O(1,3) </math>, and the associated global section of the quotient bundle <math>FM/O(1,3) </math> is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold |pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on <math>M</math>, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] in [[General Relativity]]. \n\nSimilarly, a '''supermetric''' can be defined as a global section of a certain quotient superbundle.\n\nIt should be emphasized that there are different notions of a [[supergeometry|supermanifold]]. [[Supergroup (physics) | Lie supergroups]]  and principal [[supergeometry|superbundles]] are considered in the category of <math>G</math>-supermanifolds. Let <math>\\widehat P\\to \\widehat M</math> be a principal superbundle with a structure Lie supergroup <math>\\widehat K</math>, and let <math>\\widehat H</math> be a closed Lie supersubgroup of <math>\\widehat K</math> such that <math>\\widehat K\\to \\widehat K/\\widehat H</math> is a principal superbundle. There is one-to-one correspondence between the principal supersubbundles of <math>\\widehat P</math> with the structure Lie supergroup <math>\\widehat H</math> and the global sections of the quotient superbundle <math>\\widehat P/\\widehat H\\to \\widehat M</math> with a typical fiber <math>\\widehat K/\\widehat H</math>.\n\nA key point is that underlying spaces of <math>G</math>-supermanifolds are [[differentiable manifold |smooth real manifolds]], but possessing very particular transition functions. Therefore, the condition of local triviality of the quotient <math>\\widehat K\\to \\widehat K/\\widehat H</math> is rather restrictive. It is satisfied in the most interesting case for applications when <math>\\widehat K</math> is a [[supermatrix]] group and <math>\\widehat H</math> is its Cartan supersubgroup. For instance, let <math>\\widehat P=F\\widehat M</math> be a principal superbundle of graded frames in the tangent superspaces over a supermanifold <math>\\widehat M</math> of even-odd dimensione <math> (n,2m) </math>. If its structure general linear\nsupergroup <math>\\widehat K=\\widehat{GL}(n|2m; \\Lambda) </math> is reduced to the\northogonal-symplectic supersubgroup <math>\\widehat H=\\widehat{OS}p(n|m;\\Lambda) </math>, one can think of the corresponding global section of the quotient superbundle <math>F\\widehat M/\\widehat H\\to \\widehat M</math> as being a '''supermetric''' on a supermanifold <math>\\widehat M</math>.\n\nIn particular, this is the case of a super-Euclidean metric on a [[superspace]] <math>B^{n|2m}</math>.\n\n== References ==\n* [[Pierre Deligne |Deligne, P.]] and Morgan, J.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermultiplet",
      "text": "In [[theoretical physics]], a '''supermultiplet''' is a [[group representation|representation]] of a [[supersymmetry algebra]].  It consists of a collection of [[particle]]s, called [[superpartner]]s, corresponding to operators in a [[quantum field theory]] which in [[superspace]] are represented by superfields.\n\nSuperfields were introduced by [[Abdus Salam]] and [[J. A. Strathdee]] in their 1974 article [http://inspirehep.net/search?p=NUPHA,B76,477 Supergauge Transformations].  Operations on superfields and a partial classification were presented a few months later by [[Sergio Ferrara]], [[Julius Wess]] and [[Bruno Zumino]] in [http://inspirehep.net/search?p=PHLTA,B51,239 Supergauge Multiplets and Superfields].\n\nThe most commonly used supermultiplets are vector multiplets, chiral multiplets (in 4d N=1 supersymmetry for example), hypermultiplets (in 4d N=2 supersymmetry for example), tensor multiplets and gravity multiplets.  The highest component of a vector multiplet is a [[gauge boson]], the highest component of a chiral or hypermultiplet is a [[spinor]], the highest component of a gravity multiplet is a [[graviton]].  The names are defined so as to be invariant under [[dimensional reduction]], although the organization of the fields as representations of the [[Lorentz group]] changes.\n\nNote, however, that the use of these names for the different multiplets can vary in literature. Sometimes a chiral multiplet (whose highest component is a spinor) can be referred to as a scalar multiplet. Also, in N=2 SUSY, a vector multiplet (whose highest component is a vector) can sometimes be referred to as a chiral multiplet.\n\nEspecially in theories with [[extended supersymmetry]], supermultiplets can be divided to [[short supermultiplet]]s and long supermultiplets, essentially according to the dimensionality. The short supermultiplets coincide with the [[BPS state]]s.\n\nA scalar is never the highest component of a superfield, whether it appears in a superfield at all depends on the dimension of the spacetime.  For example, in a 10-dimensional N=1 theory the vector multiplet contains only a vector and a [[Majorana-Weyl spinor]], while its dimensional reduction on a d-dimensional [[torus]] is a vector multiplet containing d real scalars.  Similarly, in an 11-dimensional theory there is only one supermultiplet with a finite number of fields, the gravity multiplet, and it contains no scalars.  However again its dimensional reduction on a d-torus to a maximal gravity multiplet does contain scalars.\n\n==Chiral Superfield==\n\nIn four dimensions, the minimal N=1 supersymmetry may be written using the notion of [[superspace]]. Superspace contains the usual space-time coordinates <math>x^{\\mu}</math>, <math>\\mu=0,\\ldots,3</math>, and four extra fermionic coordinates <math>\\theta^1,\\theta^2,\\bar\\theta^1,\\bar\\theta^2</math>, transforming as a two-component (Weyl) [[spinor]] and its conjugate.\n\nIn N=1 [[supersymmetry]] in 3+1D, a '''chiral superfield''' is a function over '''chiral superspace'''. There exists a projection from the (full) superspace to chiral superspace. So, a function over chiral\nsuperspace can be [[Differential geometry|pulled back]] to the full superspace. Such a function satisfies the covariant constraint <math>\\overline{D}f=0</math>. Similarly, we also have an '''antichiral superspace''', which is the complex conjugate of chiral superspace, and '''antichiral superfields'''.\n\n:<math> \\Phi (y , \\theta ) = A(y) + \\sqrt{2} \\theta \\psi (y) + \\theta \\theta F(y)</math>\n:<math> y^\\mu = x^\\mu + i \\theta \\sigma^\\mu \\bar{\\theta} </math>\n\n==Vector Multiplet==\n\nA vector superfield depends on all coordinates. It describes a [[gauge field]] and its [[superpartner]], namely a [[Weyl fermion]] that obeys a [[Dirac equation]].\n\n:<math>V = C + i\\theta\\chi - i \\overline{\\theta}\\overline{\\chi} + \\tfrac{i}{2}\\theta^2(M+iN)-\\tfrac{i}{2}\\overline{\\theta^2}(M-iN) - \\theta \\sigma^\\mu \\overline{\\theta} v_\\mu +i\\theta^2 \\overline{\\theta} \\left( \\overline{\\lambda} + \\tfrac{i}{2}\\overline{\\sigma}^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\chi \\right) -i\\overline{\\theta}^2 \\theta \\left(\\lambda + \\tfrac{i}{2}\\sigma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\overline{\\chi} \\right) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\theta^2 \\overline{\\theta}^2 \\left(D + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Box C\\right)</math>\n\n{{mvar|V}} is the vector superfield ('''prepotential''') and is real ({{math|{{overline|''V''}} {{=}} ''V''}}). The fields on the right hand side are component fields.\n\nTheir transformation properties and uses are discussed in [[Supersymmetric gauge theory]]\n\n==Hypermultiplet==\n\nA '''hypermultiplet''' is a type of representation of an extended [[supersymmetry algebra]], in particular the matter multiplet of ''N''=2 supersymmetry in 4 dimensions, containing two complex [[Scalar field|scalars]] ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, a Dirac [[Spinor field|spinor]] ψ, and two further [[Auxiliary field|auxiliary]] complex scalars ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\nThe name \"hypermultiplet\" comes from old term \"hypersymmetry\" for ''N''=2 supersymmetry used by {{harvtxt|Fayet|1976}}; this term has been abandoned, but the name \"hypermultiplet\" for some of its representations is still used.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Supersymmetric gauge theory]]\n* [[D-term]]\n* [[F-term]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Fayet | first1=P. | title=Fermi-Bose hypersymmetry | doi=10.1016/0550-3213(76)90458-2 | mr=0416304  | year=1976 | journal=Nuclear Physics B | volume=113 | issue=1 | pages=135–155|bibcode = 1976NuPhB.113..135F }}\n* Stephen P.

      "text": "In [[particle physics]], a '''superpartner''' (also '''sparticle''') is a class of hypothetical [[elementary particle]]s. [[Supersymmetry]] is one of the synergistic theories in current [[high-energy physics]] that predicts the existence of these “shadow\" particles.<ref name=\"physics\" /><ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nWhen considering extensions of the [[Standard Model]], the ''s-'' prefix from ''sparticle'' is used to form names of superpartners of the Standard Model [[fermion]]s ([[sfermions]]),<ref name=Studenikin>Alexander I. Studenikin (ed.), ''Particle Physics in Laboratory, Space and Universe'', World Scientific, 2005, p. 327.</ref> e.g. the [[stop squark]].

Exact ''unbroken'' supersymmetry would predict that a particle and its superpartners would have the same mass. No superpartners of the [[Standard Model]] particles have yet been found. This may indicate that supersymmetry is incorrect, or it may also be the result of the fact that supersymmetry is not an exact, ''unbroken'' symmetry of nature. If superpartners are found, their masses would indicate the scale at which supersymmetry is broken.<ref name=\"physics\" /><ref name=\"scientificamerican\" />\n\nFor particles that are real scalars (such as an [[axion]]), there is a fermion superpartner as well as a second, real scalar field.  For axions, these particles are often referred to as axinos and saxions.\n\nIn extended supersymmetry there may be more than one superparticle for a given particle. For instance, with two copies of supersymmetry in four dimensions, a photon would have two fermion superpartners and a scalar superpartner.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn zero dimensions it is possible to have supersymmetry, but no superpartners. However, this is the only situation where supersymmetry does not imply the existence of superpartners.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Recreating superpartners ==\nIf the supersymmetry theory is correct, it should be possible to recreate these particles in high-energy [[particle accelerator]]s. Doing so will not be an easy task; these particles may have masses up to a thousand times greater than their corresponding \"real\" particles.<ref name=\"physics\" /> \n\nSome researchers have hoped the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] might produce evidence for the existence of superpartner particles.<ref name=\"physics\" /> However, as of 2018, no such evidence has been found.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chargino]]\n*[[Gluino]] – as a superpartner of the Gluon\n*[[Gravitino]] – as a superpartner of the hypothetical graviton\n*[[Higgsino]] – as a superpartner of the Higgs Field\n*[[Neutralino]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |refs= \n<ref name=\"physics\">\n{{cite journal\n |last1        = Langacker\n |first1       = Paul\n |editor-last  = Sprouse\n |editor-first = Gene D.\n |date         = November 22, 2010\n |title        = Meet a superpartner at the LHC\n |journal      = [[Physics (American Physical Society journal)|Physics]]\n |volume       = 3\n |issue        = 98\n |location     = [[New York City|New York]]\n |publisher    = [[American Physical Society]]\n |issn         = 1943-2879\n |oclc         = 233971234\n |doi          = 10.1103/Physics.3.98\n |accessdate   = 21 February 2011\n |url          = http://physics.aps.org/articles/v3/98\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20110129081446/http://physics.aps.org/articles/v3/98\n |archivedate  = 2011-01-29\n |bibcode      = 2010PhyOJ...3...98L\n |deadurl      = yes\n |df           = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"nytimes\">\n{{cite news\n | title = A Giant Takes On Physics’ Biggest Questions\n | first = Dennis\n | last =  Overbye\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/science/15cern.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all\n | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]\n | publisher = [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]\n | location = [[Manhattan, New York]]\n | issn = 0362-4331\n | oclc = 1645522\n | date = May 15, 2007\n | page = F1\n | accessdate = 21 February 2011\n }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"scientificamerican\">\n{{cite journal\n |last1       = Quigg\n |first1      = Chris\n |date        = January 17, 2008\n |title       = Sidebar: Solving the Higgs Puzzle\n |journal     = [[Scientific American]]\n |publisher   = [[Nature Publishing Group]]\n |issn        = 0036-8733\n |oclc        = 1775222\n |accessdate  = 21 February 2011\n |url         = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=solving-the-higgs-puzzle\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110319222416/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=solving-the-higgs-puzzle\n |archivedate = 2011-03-19\n |deadurl     = yes\n |df          = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n\n\n{{particles}}\n\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]\n[[Category:Theoretical physics]]"

(This is not quite the usual notion of spin encountered in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, because \"real\" spin applies only to particles in [[three-dimensional space]].) Let ''b'' and its [[Hermitian adjoint]] ''b''<sup>†</sup> signify [[operator (physics)|operators]] which transform a \"spin up\" particle into a \"spin down\" particle and vice versa, respectively. Furthermore, take ''b'' and ''b''<sup>†</sup> to be normalized such that the [[anticommutator]] {''b'',''b''<sup>†</sup>} equals 1, and take that ''b''<sup>2</sup> equals 0. Let ''p'' represent the [[momentum]] of the particle and ''x'' represent its [[position vector|position]] with [''x'',''p'']=i, where we use [[natural units]] so that <math>\\hbar=1</math>. Let ''W'' (the '''superpotential''') represent an arbitrary [[differentiable function]] of ''x'' and define the supersymmetric operators ''Q''<sub>1</sub> and ''Q''<sub>2</sub> as\n\n:<math>Q_1=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(p-iW)b+(p+iW)b^\\dagger\\right]</math>\n:<math>Q_2=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[(p-iW)b-(p+iW)b^\\dagger\\right]</math>\n\nNote that ''Q''<sub>1</sub> and ''Q''<sub>2</sub> seem self-adjoint. Let the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] be\n\n:<math>H=\\{Q_1,Q_1\\}=\\{Q_2,Q_2\\}=\\frac{p^2}{2}+\\frac{W^2}{2}+\\frac{W'}{2}(bb^\\dagger-b^\\dagger b)</math>\n\nwhere ''W''' signifies the derivative of ''W''. Also note that {''Q''<sub>1</sub>,''Q''<sub>2</sub>}=0. Under these circumstances, the above system is a [[toy model]] of ''N''=2 supersymmetry. The spin down and spin up states are often referred to as the \"[[boson]]ic\" and \"[[fermion]]ic\" states, respectively, in an analogy to [[quantum field theory]]. With these definitions, ''Q''<sub>1</sub> and ''Q''<sub>2</sub> map \"bosonic\" states into \"fermionic\" states and vice versa. Restricting to the bosonic or fermionic sectors gives two [[Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics|partner potentials]] determined by\n\n:<math> H = \\frac{p^2}{2}+\\frac{W^2}{2} \\pm \\frac{W'}{2}</math>\n\n==Superpotential in dimension 4==\n\nIn [[Supersymmetry | supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theories]] with four [[spacetime]] dimensions, which might have some connection to nature, it turns out that [[Scalar (physics) | scalar]] fields arise as the lowest component of a [[chiral superfield]], which tends to automatically be complex valued. We may identify the complex conjugate of a chiral superfield as an anti-chiral superfield. There are two possible ways to obtain an action from a set of superfields:\n \n* Integrate a superfield on the whole superspace spanned by <math>x_{0,1,2,3}</math> and <math>\\theta,\\bar\\theta</math>,\n\nor\n\n* Integrate a chiral superfield on the chiral half of a superspace, spanned by <math>x_{0,1,2,3}</math> and <math>\\theta</math>, not on <math>\\bar\\theta</math>.\n\nThe second option tells us that an arbitrary [[holomorphic function]] of a set of chiral superfields can show up as a term in a Lagrangian which is invariant under supersymmetry. In this context, holomorphic means that the function can only depend on the chiral superfields, not their complex conjugates. We may call such a function ''W'', the '''superpotential'''. The fact that ''W'' is holomorphic in the chiral superfields helps explain why supersymmetric theories are relatively tractable, as it allows one to use powerful mathematical tools from [[complex analysis]]. Indeed, it is known that ''W'' receives no perturbative corrections, a result referred to as the [[perturbative non-renormalization theorem]]. Note that non-perturbative processes may correct this, for example through contributions to the [[Beta function (physics)|beta functions]] due to [[instanton]]s.\n\n==References==\n* Stephen P.

      "text": "'''Superspace''' is the coordinate space of a theory exhibiting [[supersymmetry]]. In such a formulation, along with ordinary space dimensions ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ..., there are also \"anticommuting\" dimensions whose coordinates are labeled in [[Grassmann number]]s rather than real numbers. The ordinary space dimensions correspond to [[boson]]ic degrees of freedom, the anticommuting dimensions to [[fermionic]] degrees of freedom.\n\nThe word \"superspace\" was first used by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in an unrelated sense to describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[general relativity]]; for example, this usage may be seen in his 1973 textbook ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''.\n\n==Informal discussion==\nThere are several similar, but not equivalent, definitions of superspace that have been used, and continue to be used in the mathematical and physics literature. One such usage is as a synonym for [[super Minkowski space]].<ref>[[Sylvester James Gates|S. J. Gates, Jr.]], [[Marcus T. Grisaru|M. T. Grisaru]], [[Martin Rocek|M. Roček]], [[Warren Siegel|W. Siegel]], ''Superspace or One Thousand and One Lessons in Supersymmetry'', Benjamins Cumming Publishing (1983) {{ISBN|0-8053 3161-1}}.</ref> In this case, one takes ordinary [[Minkowski space]], and extends it with anti-commuting fermionic degrees of freedom, taken to be anti-commuting [[Weyl spinor]]s from the [[Clifford algebra]] associated to the [[Lorentz group]]. Equivalently, the super Minkowski space can be understood as the quotient of the [[super Poincaré algebra]] modulo the algebra of the Lorentz group. A typical notation for the coordinates on such a space is <math>(x,\\theta,\\bar{\\theta})</math> with the overline being the give-away that super Minkowski space is the intended space.\n\nSuperspace is also commonly used as a synonym for the [[super vector space]]. This is taken to be an ordinary [[vector space]], together with additional coordinates taken from the [[Grassmann algebra]], i.e. coordinate directions that are [[Grassmann number]]s.  There are several conventions for constructing a super vector space in use; two of these are described by Rogers<ref name=\"rogers\">[[Alice Rogers]], ''Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications'', World Scientific (2007) {{ISBN|978-981-3203-21-1}}.</ref> and DeWitt.<ref name=\"dewitt\">[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', Cambridge University Press (1984) {{ISBN|0521 42377 5}}.</ref>\n\nA third usage of the term \"superspace\" is as a synonym for a [[supermanifold]]: a supersymmetric generalization of a [[manifold]]. Note that both super Minkowski spaces and super vector spaces can be taken as special cases of supermanifolds.\n\nA fourth, and completely unrelated meaning saw a brief usage in [[general relativity]]; this is discussed in greater detail at the bottom.\n\n==Examples==\nSeveral examples are given below. The first few assume a definition of superspace as a [[super vector space]].  This is denoted as '''R'''<sup>''m''|''n''</sup>, the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-[[graded vector space]] with '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> as the even subspace and '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> as the odd subspace. The same definition applies to '''C'''<sup>m|n</sup>.\n\nThe four-dimensional examples take superspace to be [[super Minkowski space]]. Although similar to a vector space, this has many important differences: First of all, it is an [[affine space]], having no special point denoting the origin.  Next, the fermionic coordinates are taken to be anti-commuting [[Weyl spinor]]s from the [[Clifford algebra]], rather than being [[Grassmann number]]s. The difference here is that the Clifford algebra has a considerably richer and more subtle structure than the Grassmann numbers.  So, the Grassmann numbers are elements of the [[exterior algebra]], and the Clifford algebra has an isomorphism to the exterior algebra, but its relation to the [[orthogonal group]] and the [[spin group]], used to construct the [[spin representation]]s, give it a deep geometric significance. (For example, the spin groups form a normal part of the study of [[Riemannian geometry]],<ref>[[Jürgen Jost]], ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', Springer-Verlag (2002) {{ISBN|3-540-63654-4}}.</ref> quite outside the ordinary bounds and concerns of physics.)\n\n===Trivial examples===\n\nThe smallest superspace is a point which contains neither bosonic nor fermionic directions.  Other trivial examples include the ''n''-dimensional real plane '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, which is a [[vector space]] extending in ''n'' real, bosonic directions and no fermionic directions.  The vector space '''R'''<sup>0|n</sup>, which is the ''n''-dimensional real [[Grassmann algebra]].  The space '''R'''<sup>1|1</sup> of one even and one odd direction is known as the space of [[dual number]]s, introduced by [[William Kingdon Clifford|William Clifford]] in 1873.\n\n===The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics===\n[[Supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] with ''N'' [[supercharge]]s is often formulated in the superspace '''R'''<sup>1|2''N''</sup>, which contains one real direction ''t'' identified with [[time]] and ''N'' complex [[Grassmann number|Grassmann directions]] which are spanned by  Θ<sub>''i''</sub> and  Θ<sup>*</sup><sub>''i''</sub>, where ''i'' runs from 1 to ''N''.\n\nConsider the special case ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  The superspace '''R'''<sup>1|2</sup> is a 3-dimensional vector space.  A given coordinate therefore may be written as a triple (''t'', Θ, Θ<sup>*</sup>).  The coordinates form a [[Lie superalgebra]], in which the gradation degree of ''t'' is even and that of Θ and Θ<sup>*</sup> is odd.  This means that a bracket may be defined between any two elements of this vector space, and that this bracket reduces to the [[commutator]] on two even coordinates and on one even and one odd coordinate while it is an [[anticommutator]] on two odd coordinates.  This superspace is an abelian Lie superalgebra, which means that all of the aforementioned brackets vanish\n\n:::<math>\\left[ t,t\\right]=\\left[ t, \\theta\\right]=\\left[ t, \\theta^*\\right]=\\left\\{\\theta, \\theta\\right\\}=\\left\\{ \\theta, \\theta^*\\right\\} =\\left\\{ \\theta^*, \\theta^*\\right\\}=0</math>\n\nwhere <math>[a,b]</math> is the commutator of ''a'' and ''b'' and <math>\\{a,b\\}</math> is the anticommutator of ''a'' and ''b''.\n\nOne may define functions from this vector space to itself, which are called [[superfield]]s. The above algebraic relations imply that, if we expand our superfield as a [[power series]] in Θ and Θ<sup>*</sup>, then we will only find terms at the zeroeth and first orders, because Θ<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;Θ<sup>*2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.  Therefore, superfields may be written as arbitrary functions of ''t'' multiplied by the zeroeth and first order terms in the two Grassmann coordinates\n\n:::<math>\\Phi \\left(t,\\Theta,\\Theta^* \\right)=\\phi(t)+\\Theta\\Psi(t)-\\Theta^*\\Phi^*(t)+\\Theta\\Theta^* F(t)</math>\n\nSuperfields, which are representations of the [[supersymmetry]] of superspace, generalize the notion of [[tensor]]s, which are representations of the rotation group of a bosonic space.\n\nOne may then define derivatives in the Grassmann directions, which take the first order term in the expansion of a superfield to the zeroeth order term and annihilate the zeroeth order term.  One can choose sign conventions such that the derivatives satisfy the anticommutation relations\n\n:::<math>\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\,,\\Theta\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^*}\\,,\\Theta^*\\right\\}=1</math>\n\nThese derivatives may be assembled into [[supercharge]]s\n\n:::<math>Q=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}-i\\Theta^*\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\quad \\text{and} \\quad Q^\\dagger=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^*}+i\\Theta\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}</math>\n\nwhose anticommutators identify them as the fermionic generators of a [[supersymmetry]] algebra\n\n:::<math>\\left\\{ Q,Q^\\dagger\\,\\right\\}=2i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}</math>\n\nwhere ''i'' times the time derivative is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] operator in [[quantum mechanics]].

The supersymmetry variation with supersymmetry parameter ε of a superfield Φ is defined to be\n\n:::<math>\\delta_\\epsilon\\Phi=(\\epsilon^* Q+\\epsilon Q^\\dagger)\\Phi.</math>\n\nWe can evaluate this variation using the action of ''Q'' on the superfields\n\n:::<math>\\left[Q,\\Phi \\right]=\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\,-i\\theta^*\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right)\\Phi=\\psi+\\theta^*\\left(F-i\\dot{\\phi}\\right)+i\\theta\\theta^*\\dot{\\psi}.</math>\n\nSimilarly one may define [[covariant derivative]]s on superspace\n\n:::<math>D=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}-i\\theta^*\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\quad \\text{and} \\quad D^\\dagger=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^*}-i\\theta\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}</math>\n\nwhich anticommute with the supercharges and satisfy a wrong sign supersymmetry algebra\n\n:::<math>\\left\\{D,D^\\dagger\\right\\}=-2i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}</math>.\n\nThe fact that the covariant derivatives anticommute with the supercharges means the supersymmetry transformation of a covariant derivative of a superfield is equal to the covariant derivative of the same supersymmetry transformation of the same superfield.  Thus, generalizing the covariant derivative in bosonic geometry which constructs tensors from tensors, the superspace covariant derivative constructs superfields from superfields.\n\n===Four-dimensional ''N'' = 1 superspace<!--'Bosonic dimension', 'Bosonic dimensions', 'Grassmann dimension', 'Grassmann dimensions', 'Fermionic dimension', and 'Fermionic dimensions' redirect here-->===\n\nPerhaps the most popular superspace in [[physics]] is ''d''=4 ''N''=1 [[super Minkowski space]] '''R'''<sup>4|4</sup>, which is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of four real '''bosonic dimensions'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> and four real '''Grassmann dimensions'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (also known as '''fermionic dimensions'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->).<ref>[[Yuval Ne'eman]], Elena Eizenberg, ''Membranes and Other Extendons (p-branes)'', World Scientific, 1995,  p. 5.</ref>  In [[supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] one is interested in superspaces which furnish [[group representation|representations]] of a [[Lie superalgebra]] called a [[supersymmetry algebra]].  The bosonic part of the supersymmetry algebra is the [[Poincaré algebra]], while the fermionic part is constructed using [[spinor]]s of Grassmann numbers.\n\nFor this reason, in physical applications one considers an action of the supersymmetry algebra on the four fermionic directions of '''R'''<sup>4|4</sup> such that they transform as a [[spinor]] under the Poincaré subalgebra.  In four dimensions there are three distinct irreducible 4-component spinors.  There is the [[Majorana spinor]], the left-handed [[Weyl spinor]] and the right-handed Weyl spinor.  The [[CPT theorem]] implies that in a [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]], Poincaré invariant theory, which is a theory in which the [[S-matrix]] is a [[unitary matrix]] and the same Poincaré generators act on the asymptotic in-states as on the asymptotic out-states, the supersymmetry algebra must contain an equal number of left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors.  However, since each Weyl spinor has four components, this means that if one includes any Weyl spinors one must have 8 fermionic directions.  Such a theory is said to have [[extended supersymmetry]], and such models have received a lot of attention.  For example, supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges and fundamental matter have been solved by [[Nathan Seiberg]] and [[Edward Witten]], see [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory]].  However, in this subsection we are considering the superspace with four fermionic components and so no Weyl spinors are consistent with the CPT theorem.\n\n''Note'': There are many [[sign convention]]s in use and this is only one of them.\n\nThis leaves us with one possibility, the four fermionic directions transform as a Majorana spinor θ<sub>α</sub>.  We can also form a conjugate spinor\n\n:::<math>\\overline{\\theta}\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   i\\theta^\\dagger\\gamma^0=-\\theta^\\perp C</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' is the charge conjugation matrix, which is defined by the property that when it conjugates a [[gamma matrix]], the gamma matrix is negated and transposed.  The first equality is the definition of {{Overline|θ}} while the second is a consequence of the Majorana spinor condition θ<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;iγ<sub>0</sub>Cθ.  The conjugate spinor plays a role similar to that of  θ<sup>*</sup> in the superspace '''R'''<sup>1|2</sup>, except that the Majorana condition, as manifested in the above equation, imposes that θ and θ<sup>*</sup> are not independent.\n\nIn particular we may construct the supercharges\n\n:::<math>Q=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\overline{\\theta}}+\\gamma^\\mu\\theta\\partial_\\mu</math>\n\nwhich satisfy the supersymmetry algebra\n\n:::<math>\\left\\{Q,Q\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\overline{Q},Q\\right\\}C=2\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu C=-2i\\gamma^\\mu P_\\mu C</math>\n\nwhere <math>P=i\\partial_\\mu</math> is the 4-[[momentum]] operator.  Again the covariant derivative is defined like the supercharge but with the second term negated and it anticommutes with the supercharges. Thus the covariant derivative of a supermultiplet is another supermultiplet.\n\n==In general relativity==\nThe word \"superspace\" is also used in a completely different and unrelated sense, in the book [[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]] by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler.  There, it refers to the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[general relativity]], and, in particular, the view of gravitation as [[geometrodynamics]], an interpretation of general relativity as a form of dynamical geometry. In modern terms, this particular idea of \"superspace\" is captured in one of several different formalisms used in solving the Einstein equations in a variety of settings, both theoretical and practical, such as in numerical simulations. This includes primarily the [[ADM formalism]], as well as ideas surrounding the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Einstein equation]] and the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chiral superspace]]\n* [[Harmonic superspace]]\n* [[Projective superspace]]\n* [[Supergroup (physics)|Supergroup]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | editor1-last=[[:uk:Дуплій Степан Анатолійович|Duplij]]  | editor1-first=Steven  | editor2-last=[[Warren Siegel|Siegel]]| editor2-first=Warren| editor3-last=Bagger | editor3-first=Jonathan | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Supersymmetry And Noncommutative Structures in Mathematics and Physics | publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-1-4020-1338-6 | year=2005}} (Second printing)\n\n{{String theory topics |state=collapsed}}\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]\n[[Category:General relativity]]\n\n[[hu:Szupertér]]"

Physicists developed the technique of [[renormalization]] to eliminate these infinities; this technique works for three of the four fundamental forces—[[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]], [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear]] and [[Weak interaction|weak nuclear]] forces—but not for [[gravity]]. Development of [[quantum theory of gravity]] therefore requires different means than those used for the other forces.<ref>Polchinski, Joseph. ''String Theory: Volume I''. Cambridge University Press, p. 4.</ref>\n\nAccording to the theory, the fundamental constituents of reality are strings of the [[Planck units|Planck length]] (about 10<sup>&minus;33</sup>&nbsp;cm) that vibrate at [[resonance|resonant]] frequencies. Every string, in theory, has a unique resonance, or harmonic. Different harmonics determine different fundamental particles. The tension in a string is on the order of the [[Planck force]] (10<sup>44</sup> [[Newton (unit)|newtons]]). The [[graviton]] (the proposed [[messenger particle]] of the gravitational force), for example, is predicted by the theory to be a string with wave amplitude zero.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of string theory}}\nInvestigating how a string theory may include fermions in its spectrum led to the invention of supersymmetry (in [[Western world|the West]])<ref>Dean Rickles (2014).

However, nothing prevents a theory from including more than 4 dimensions. In the case of [[string theory]], [[consistency]] requires [[spacetime]] to have 10 dimensions (3D regular space + 1 time + 6D hyperspace).<ref>The ''D'' = 10 [[critical dimension]] was originally discovered by [[John H. Schwarz]] in Schwarz, J. H. (1972). \"Physical states and pomeron poles in the dual pion model\". ''Nuclear Physics'', '''B46'''(1), 61–74.</ref> The fact that we see only 3 dimensions of space can be explained by one of two mechanisms: either the extra dimensions are [[Compactification (physics)|compactified]] on a very small scale, or else our world may live on a 3-dimensional [[submanifold]] corresponding to a [[brane]], on which all known particles besides gravity would be restricted.\n\nIf the extra dimensions are compactified, then the extra 6 dimensions must be in the form of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]. Within the more complete framework of [[M-theory]], they would have to take form of a [[G2 manifold]]. [[Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi-Yaus]] are interesting mathematical spaces in their own right. A particular exact symmetry of string/M-theory called [[T-duality]] (which exchanges momentum modes for [[winding number]] and sends compact dimensions of radius R to radius 1/R),<ref>Polchinski, Joseph. ''String Theory: Volume I''. Cambridge University Press, p. 247.</ref> has led to the discovery of equivalences between different Calabi–Yau manifolds called [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].\n\nSuperstring theory is not the first theory to propose extra spatial dimensions. It can be seen as building upon the [[Kaluza–Klein theory]], which proposed a 4+1 dimensional (5D) theory of gravity. When compactified on a circle, the gravity in the extra dimension precisely describes [[electromagnetism]] from the perspective of the 3 remaining large space dimensions. Thus the original Kaluza–Klein theory is a prototype for the unification of gauge and gravity interactions, at least at the classical level, however it is known to be insufficient to describe nature for a variety of reasons (missing weak and strong forces, lack of parity violation, etc.) A more complex compact geometry is needed to reproduce the known gauge forces. Also, to obtain a consistent, fundamental, quantum theory requires the upgrade to string theory, not just the extra dimensions.\n\n==Number of superstring theories==\nTheoretical physicists were troubled by the existence of five separate superstring theories. A possible solution for this dilemma was suggested at the beginning of what is called the [[second superstring revolution]] in the 1990s, which suggests that the five string theories might be different limits of a single underlying theory, called [[M-theory]]. This remains a [[conjecture]].<ref>Polchinski, Joseph. ''String Theory: Volume II''.

This theory is special in the sense that it is based on unoriented [[closed string|open]] and [[closed string]]s, while the rest are based on oriented closed strings.\n* The [[type II string]] theories have two supersymmetries in the ten-dimensional sense (32 supercharges). There are actually two kinds of type II strings called type IIA and type IIB. They differ mainly in the fact that the IIA theory is non-[[chirality (physics)|chiral]] (parity conserving) while the IIB theory is chiral (parity violating).\n* The [[heterotic string]] theories are based on a peculiar hybrid of a type I superstring and a bosonic string. There are two kinds of heterotic strings differing in their ten-dimensional [[gauge group]]s:  the heterotic [[E8 (mathematics)|''E''<sub>8</sub>×''E''<sub>8</sub>]] string and the heterotic [[special orthogonal group|SO(32)]] string. (The name heterotic SO(32) is slightly inaccurate since among the SO(32) [[Lie group]]s, string theory singles out a quotient Spin(32)/Z<sub>2</sub> that is not equivalent to SO(32).)\n\nChiral [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] can be inconsistent due to [[anomaly (physics)|anomalies]]. This happens when certain one-loop [[Feynman diagram]]s cause a quantum mechanical breakdown of the gauge symmetry. The anomalies were canceled out via the [[Green–Schwarz mechanism]].\n\nEven though there are only five superstring theories, making detailed predictions for real experiments requires information about exactly what physical configuration the theory is in. This considerably complicates efforts to test string theory because there is an astronomically high number—10<sup>500</sup> or more—of configurations that meet some of the basic requirements to be consistent with our world. Along with the extreme remoteness of the Planck scale, this is the other major reason it is hard to test superstring theory.\n\nAnother approach to the number of superstring theories refers to the [[mathematical structure]] called [[composition algebra]]. In the findings of [[abstract algebra]] there are just seven composition algebras over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s. In 1990 physicists R. Foot and G.C. Joshi in Australia stated that \"the seven classical superstring theories are in one-to-one correspondence to the seven composition algebras\".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00402262 |title=Nonstandard signature of spacetime, superstrings, and the split composition algebras |date=1990 |last1=Foot |first1=R. |last2=Joshi |first2=G. C. |journal=Letters in Mathematical Physics |volume=19 |pages=65–71 |bibcode=1990LMaPh..19...65F}}</ref>\n\n==Integrating general relativity and quantum mechanics==\n\n[[General relativity]] typically deals with situations involving large mass objects in fairly large regions of [[spacetime]] whereas [[quantum mechanics]] is generally reserved for scenarios at the atomic scale (small spacetime regions). The two are very rarely used together, and the most common case that combines them is in the study of [[black hole]]s. Having ''peak density'', or the maximum amount of matter possible in a space, and very small area, the two must be used in synchrony to predict conditions in such places. Yet, when used together, the equations fall apart, spitting out impossible answers, such as imaginary distances and less than one dimension.\n\nThe major problem with their congruence is that, at [[Planck scale]] (a fundamental small unit of length) lengths, general relativity predicts a smooth, flowing surface, while quantum mechanics predicts a random, warped surface, which are nowhere near compatible. Superstring theory resolves this issue, replacing the classical idea of point particles with strings. These strings have an average diameter of the [[Planck length]], with extremely small variances, which completely ignores the quantum mechanical predictions of Planck-scale length dimensional warping. Also, these surfaces can be mapped as branes. These branes can be viewed as objects with \na morphism between them. In this case, the morphism will be the state of a string that stretches between brane A and brane B.\n\n[[Gravitational singularity|Singularities]] are avoided because the observed consequences of \"[[Big Crunch]]es\" never reach zero size.  In fact, should the universe begin a \"big crunch\" sort of process, string theory dictates that the universe could never be smaller than the size of one string, at which point it would actually begin expanding.\n\n==Mathematics==\n\n===D-branes===\nD-branes are membrane-like objects in 10D string theory. They can be thought of as occurring as a result of a [[Kaluza–Klein]] compactification of 11D M-theory that contains membranes. Because compactification of a geometric theory produces extra [[vector fields]] the D-branes can be included in the action by adding an extra U(1) vector field to the string action.\n\n: <math>\\partial_z \\rightarrow \\partial_z +iA_z(z,\\overline{z})</math>\n\nIn '''type I''' open string theory, the ends of open strings are always attached to D-brane surfaces. A string theory with more gauge fields such as SU(2) gauge fields would then correspond to the compactification of some higher-dimensional theory above 11 dimensions, which is not thought to be possible to date. Furthermore, the tachyons attached to the D-branes show the instability of those d-branes with respect to the annihilation. The tachyon total energy is (or reflects) the total energy of the D-branes.\n\n===Why five superstring theories?===\nFor a 10 dimensional supersymmetric theory we are allowed a 32-component Majorana spinor. This can be decomposed into a pair of 16-component Majorana-Weyl (chiral) [[spinors]]. There are then various ways to construct an invariant depending on whether these two spinors have the same or opposite chiralities:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Superstring model !! Invariant\n|-\n| Heterotic || <math>\\partial_zX^\\mu-i\\overline{\\theta_L}\\Gamma^\\mu\\partial_z\\theta_L</math>\n|-\n| IIA || <math>\\partial_zX^\\mu-i\\overline{\\theta_L}\\Gamma^\\mu\\partial_z\\theta_L - i \\overline{\\theta_R} \\Gamma^\\mu\\partial_z\\theta_R</math>\n|-\n| IIB || <math>\\partial_z X^\\mu-i\\overline{\\theta^1_L}\\Gamma^\\mu\\partial_z\\theta^1_L - i \\overline{\\theta^2_L}\\Gamma^\\mu\\partial_z\\theta^2_L</math>\n\n|}\n\nThe heterotic superstrings come in two types SO(32) and E<sub>8</sub>&times;E<sub>8</sub> as indicated above and the type I superstrings include open strings.\n\n==Beyond superstring theory==\nIt is conceivable that the five superstring theories are approximated to a theory in higher dimensions possibly involving membranes. Because the action for this involves quartic terms and higher so is not [[Gaussian]], the functional integrals are very difficult to solve and so this has confounded the top theoretical physicists. [[Edward Witten]] has popularised the concept of a theory in 11 dimensions, called M-theory, involving membranes interpolating from the known symmetries of superstring theory. It may turn out that there exist membrane models or other non-membrane models in higher dimensions—which may become acceptable when we find new unknown symmetries of nature, such as noncommutative geometry. It is thought, however, that 16 is probably the maximum since SO(16) is a maximal subgroup of E8, the largest exceptional Lie group, and also is more than large enough to contain the [[Standard Model]].\nQuartic integrals of the non-functional kind are easier to solve so there is hope for the future. This is the series solution, which is always convergent when a is non-zero and negative:\n\n: <math> \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp({a x^4+b x^3+c x^2+d x+f}) \\, dx\n= e^f \\sum_{n,m,p=0}^\\infty \\frac{ b^{4n}}{(4n)!} \\frac{c^{2m}}{(2m)!} \\frac{d^{4p}}{(4p)!} \\frac{ \\Gamma(3n+m+p+\\frac14) }{a^{3n+m+p+\\frac14} } </math>\n\nIn the case of membranes the series would correspond to sums of various membrane interactions that are not seen in string theory.\n\n===Compactification===\nInvestigating theories of higher dimensions often involves looking at the 10 dimensional superstring theory and interpreting some of the more obscure results in terms of compactified dimensions. For example, [[D-branes]] are seen as compactified membranes from 11D M-theory. Theories of higher dimensions such as 12D F-theory and beyond produce other effects, such as gauge terms higher than U(1). The components of the extra vector fields (A) in the D-brane actions can be thought of as extra coordinates (X) in disguise. However, the ''known'' symmetries including [[supersymmetry]] currently restrict the [[spinors]] to 32-components—which limits the number of dimensions to 11 (or 12 if you include two time dimensions.) Some commentators (e.g., [[John Baez]] et al.) have speculated that the exceptional [[Lie groups]] E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub> and E<sub>8</sub> having maximum orthogonal subgroups SO(10), SO(12) and SO(16) may be related to theories in 10, 12 and 16 dimensions; 10 dimensions corresponding to string theory and the 12 and 16 dimensional theories being yet undiscovered but would be theories based on 3-branes and 7-branes respectively. However, this is a minority view within the string community. Since E<sub>7</sub> is in some sense F<sub>4</sub> quaternified and E<sub>8</sub> is F<sub>4</sub> octonified, the 12 and 16 dimensional theories, if they did exist, may involve the [[noncommutative geometry]] based on the [[quaternions]] and [[octonions]] respectively. From the above discussion, it can be seen that physicists have many ideas for extending superstring theory beyond the current 10 dimensional theory, but so far all have been unsuccessful.\n\n===Kac–Moody algebras===\nSince strings can have an infinite number of modes, the symmetry used to describe string theory is based on infinite dimensional Lie algebras. Some [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s that have been considered as symmetries for [[M-theory]] have been E<sub>10</sub> and E<sub>11</sub> and their supersymmetric extensions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n* [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]\n* [[dS/CFT correspondence]]\n* [[Grand unification theory]]\n* [[Large Hadron Collider]]\n* [[List of string theory topics]]\n* [[Quantum gravity]]\n* [[String field theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Introduction to Superstring and M-Theory|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York, USA|date=1999}}\n*{{cite book|last=Shen|first=Sinyan|title=Introduction to Superfluidity|edition=2nd|publisher=Science Press|location=Beijing, China|date=1982}}\n*{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Brian|title=[[The Elegant Universe]]: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory|publisher=Random House Inc.|date=2000}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/events/exchanges-at-the-frontier-7/brian-greene.aspx Wellcome Collection video on superstring theory]\n*[http://superstringtheory.com/index.html The official superstring theory website]\n\n{{String theory topics |state=collapsed}}\n{{Standard model of physics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Superstring Theory}}\n[[Category:String theory]]\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]\n[[Category:Physics beyond the Standard Model]]"

      "text": "{{textbook|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn [[theoretical physics]], there are many theories with [[supersymmetry]] (SUSY) which also have internal [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. '''Supersymmetric gauge theory''' generalizes this notion.\n\n==Gauge theory==\n\nA gauge theory is a mathematical framework for analysing{{dubious|date=May 2016}} gauge symmetries. There are two types of symmetries, viz., global and local. A [[global symmetry]] is the symmetry which remains invariant at each point of a manifold (manifold can be either of [[spacetime coordinates]] or that of [[internal quantum number]]s). A [[local symmetry]] is the symmetry which depends upon the space over which it is defined, and changes with the variation in coordinates. Thus, such symmetry is invariant only locally (i.e., in a neighborhood on the manifold).\n\n[[Maxwell's equations]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]] are famous examples of gauge theories.\n\n==Supersymmetry==\n\nIn [[particle physics]], there exist particles with two kinds of [[particle statistics]], bosons and fermions. Bosons carry integer spin values, and are characterized by the ability to have any number of identical bosons occupy a single point in space. They are thus identified with [[force]]s. Fermions carry half-integer spin values, and by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], identical fermions cannot occupy a single position in spacetime. They are identified with matter. Thus, SUSY is considered a strong candidate for the unification of radiation (boson-mediated forces) and matter.\n\nThis mechanism{{which|date=May 2016}} works via an operator <math>Q</math>, known as [[supersymmetry generator]], which acts as follows:\n\n<math> Q|\\text{boson}\\rangle = |\\text{fermion}\\rangle </math> <br />\n<math> Q|\\text{fermion}\\rangle  =  |\\text{boson}\\rangle </math>\n\nFor instance, the supersymmetry generator can take a photon as an argument and transform it into a photino and vice versa. This happens through translation in the (parameter) space. This superspace is a <math> {\\mathbb{Z}_2} </math>-graded vector space <math> \\mathcal{W}=\\mathcal{W}^0 \\oplus \\mathcal{W}^1 </math>, where <math>\\mathcal{W}^0 </math> is the bosonic Hilbert space and <math> \\mathcal{W}^1 </math> is the fermionic Hilbert space.\n\n==SUSY gauge theory==\n\nThe motivation for a supersymmetric version of gauge theory can be the fact that gauge invariance is consistent with supersymmetry.\nThe first examples were discovered by [[Bruno Zumino]] and [[Sergio Ferrara]], and independently by [[Abdus Salam]] and [[James Strathdee]] in 1974.\n\nBecause both the half-integer spin fermions and the integer spin bosons can become gauge particles. Moreover the vector fields and the spinor fields both reside in the same representation of the internal symmetry group.\n\nSuppose we have a gauge transformation <math> V_{\\mu} \\rightarrow V_{\\mu} + \\partial_{\\mu} A </math>, where <math> V_{\\mu} </math> is a vector field and <math> A </math> is the gauge function. The main problem in construction of SUSY Gauge Theory is to extend the above transformation in a way that is consistent with SUSY transformations.\n\nThe Wess-Zumino gauge provides a successful solution to this problem. Once such suitable gauge is obtained, the dynamics of the SUSY gauge theory work as follows: we seek a lagrangian that is invariant under the Super-gauge transformations (these transformations are an important tool needed to develop supersymmetric version of a gauge theory). Then we can integrate the lagrangian using the Berezin integration rules and thus obtain the action. Which further leads to the equations of motion and hence can provide a complete analysis of the dynamics of the theory.\n\n=={{math|''N'' {{=}} 1}} SUSY in 4D (with 4 real generators)==\nIn four dimensions, the minimal {{math|''N'' {{=}} 1}} supersymmetry may be written using a [[superspace]]. This superspace involves four extra fermionic coordinates <math>\\theta^1,\\theta^2,\\bar\\theta^1,\\bar\\theta^2</math>, transforming as a two-component [[spinor]] and its conjugate.\n\nEvery superfield, i.e. a field that depends on all coordinates of the superspace, may be expanded with respect to the new fermionic coordinates. There exists a special kind of superfields, the so-called [[chiral superfield]]s, that only depend on the variables {{mvar|θ}} but not their conjugates (more precisely, <math>\\overline{D}f=0</math>). However, a [[supermultiplet|vector superfield]] depends on all coordinates. It describes a [[gauge field]] and its [[superpartner]], namely a [[Weyl fermion]] that obeys a [[Dirac equation]].\n\n:<math>V = C + i\\theta\\chi - i \\overline{\\theta}\\overline{\\chi} + \\tfrac{i}{2}\\theta^2(M+iN)-\\tfrac{i}{2}\\overline{\\theta^2}(M-iN) - \\theta \\sigma^\\mu \\overline{\\theta} v_\\mu +i\\theta^2 \\overline{\\theta} \\left( \\overline{\\lambda} - \\tfrac{i}{2}\\overline{\\sigma}^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\chi \\right) -i\\overline{\\theta}^2 \\theta \\left(\\lambda + \\tfrac{i}{2}\\sigma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\overline{\\chi} \\right) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\theta^2 \\overline{\\theta}^2 \\left(D + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Box C\\right)</math>\n\n{{mvar|V}} is the vector superfield ('''prepotential''') and is real ({{math|{{overline|''V''}} {{=}} ''V''}}). The fields on the right hand side are component fields.\n\nThe [[gauge transformation]]s act as\n\n:<math>V \\to V + \\Lambda + \\overline{\\Lambda}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|Λ}} is any chiral superfield.\n\nIt's easy to check that the chiral superfield\n\n:<math>W_\\alpha \\equiv -\\tfrac{1}{4}\\overline{D}^2 D_\\alpha V</math>\n\nis gauge invariant. So is its complex conjugate <math>\\overline{W}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}</math>.\n\nA non-supersymmetric [[covariant gauge]] which is often used is the '''[[Wess–Zumino gauge]]'''. Here, {{mvar|C, χ, M}} and {{mvar|N}} are all set to zero. The residual gauge symmetries are gauge transformations of the traditional bosonic type.\n\nA chiral superfield {{mvar|X}} with a charge of {{mvar|q}} transforms as\n\n:<math>X \\to e^{q\\Lambda}X, \\qquad \\overline{X} \\to e^{q\\overline{\\Lambda}}X</math>\n\nTherefore {{math|{{overline|''X''}}''e''<sup>−''qV''</sup>''X''}} is gauge invariant. Here {{math|''e''<sup>−''qV''</sup>}} is called a '''bridge''' since it \"bridges\" a field which transforms under {{math|Λ}} only with a field which transforms under {{math|{{overline|Λ}}}} only.\n\nMore generally, if we have a real gauge group {{mvar|G}} that we wish to supersymmetrize, we first have to [[complexify]] it to {{math|''G<sup>c</sup>'' ⋅ ''e''<sup>−''qV''</sup>}} then acts a '''compensator''' for the complex gauge transformations in effect absorbing them leaving only the real parts. This is what's being done in the Wess–Zumino gauge.\n\n===Differential superforms===\nLet's rephrase everything to look more like a conventional [[Yang–Mills]] gauge theory. We have a {{math|U(1)}} gauge symmetry acting upon full superspace with a 1-superform gauge connection A. In the analytic basis for the tangent space, the covariant derivative is given by <math>D_M=d_M+iqA_M</math>. Integrability conditions for chiral superfields with the chiral constraint\n\n:<math>\\overline{D}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}X=0</math>\n\nleave us with\n\n:<math>\\left\\{\\overline{D}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}, \\overline{D}_{\\dot{\\beta}} \\right\\}=F_{\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\beta}}=0.</math>\n\nA similar constraint for antichiral superfields leaves us with {{math|''F<sub>αβ</sub>'' {{=}} 0}}. This means that we can either gauge fix <math>A_{\\dot{\\alpha}}=0</math> or {{math|''A<sub>α</sub>'' {{=}} 0}} but not both simultaneously. Call the two different gauge fixing schemes I and II respectively. In gauge I, <math>\\overline{d}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}X=0</math> and in gauge II, {{math|''d<sub>α</sub>'' {{overline|''X''}} {{=}} 0}}. Now, the trick is to use two different gauges simultaneously; gauge I for chiral superfields and gauge II for antichiral superfields. In order to '''bridge''' between the two different gauges, we need a gauge transformation. Call it {{math|''e''<sup>−''V''</sup>}} (by convention). If we were using one gauge for all fields, {{math|{{overline|''X''}}''X''}} would be gauge invariant. However, we need to convert gauge I to gauge II, transforming {{mvar|X}} to {{math|(''e''<sup>−''V''</sup>)<sup>''q''</sup>''X''}}. So, the gauge invariant quantity is {{math|{{overline|''X''}}''e''<sup>−''qV''</sup>''X''}}.\n\nIn gauge I, we still have the residual gauge {{math|''e''<sup>Λ</sup>}} where <math>\\overline{d}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}\\Lambda=0</math> and in gauge II, we have the residual gauge {{math|''e''<sup>{{overline|Λ}}</sup>}} satisfying {{math|''d<sub>α</sub>'' {{overline|Λ}} {{=}} 0}}. Under the residual gauges, the bridge transforms as\n\n:<math>e^{-V}\\to e^{-\\overline{\\Lambda}-V-\\Lambda}.</math>\n\nWithout any additional constraints, the bridge {{math|''e''<sup>−''V''</sup>}} wouldn't give all the information about the gauge field. However, with the additional constraint <math>F_{\\dot{\\alpha}\\beta}</math>, there's only one unique gauge field which is compatible with the bridge modulo gauge transformations. Now, the bridge gives exactly the same information content as the gauge field.\n\n==Theories with 8 or more SUSY generators ({{math|''N'' > 1}}) ==\nIn theories with higher supersymmetry (and perhaps higher dimension), a vector superfield typically describes not only a gauge field and a Weyl fermion but also at least one complex [[scalar field]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[super QCD]]\n* [[superpotential]]\n* [[D-term]]\n* [[F-term]]\n* [[current superfield]]\n* [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]]\n* [[Supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]\n\n==References==\n* Stephen P.

To make progress on these problems, physicists developed ''supersymmetric quantum mechanics'', an application of the supersymmetry (SUSY) superalgebra to [[quantum mechanics]] as opposed to [[quantum field theory]].  It was hoped that studying SUSY's consequences in this simpler setting would lead to new understanding; remarkably, the effort created new areas of research in quantum mechanics itself.\n\nFor example, students are typically taught to \"solve\" the [[hydrogen]] atom by a laborious process which begins by inserting the [[Coulomb]] potential into the [[Schrödinger equation]].  After a considerable amount of work using many differential equations, the analysis produces a recursion relation for the [[Laguerre polynomials]].  The final outcome is the [[Hydrogen spectral series|spectrum]] of hydrogen-atom energy states (labeled by quantum numbers ''n'' and ''l'').  Using ideas drawn from SUSY, the final result can be derived with significantly greater ease, in much the same way that operator methods are used to solve the [[harmonic oscillator]].<ref>{{Citation\n |last              = Valance\n |first             = A.\n |last2             = Morgan\n |first2            = T.

(The [[potential energy]] terms which occur in the Hamiltonians are then called ''partner potentials''.)  An introductory theorem shows that for every [[eigenstate]] of one Hamiltonian, its partner Hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy (except possibly for zero energy eigenstates).  This fact can be exploited to deduce many properties of the eigenstate spectrum.  It is analogous to the original description of SUSY, which referred to bosons and fermions.  We can imagine a \"bosonic Hamiltonian\", whose eigenstates are the various bosons of our theory.  The SUSY partner of this Hamiltonian would be \"fermionic\", and its eigenstates would be the theory's fermions.  Each boson would have a fermionic partner of equal energy—but, in the relativistic world, energy and mass are interchangeable, so we can just as easily say that the partner particles have equal mass.\n\nSUSY concepts have provided useful extensions to the [[WKB approximation]] in the form of a modified version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition.  In addition, SUSY has been applied to non-quantum [[statistical mechanics]] through the [[Fokker-Planck equation]], showing that even if the original inspiration in high-energy particle physics turns out to be a blind alley, its investigation has brought about many useful benefits.\n\n==Example: the harmonic oscillator==\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator takes the form\n\n:<math>H^{HO} \\psi_{n}(x) = \\bigg(\\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}+\\frac{m \\omega^{2}}{2}x^{2}\\bigg) \\psi_{n}(x) = E_{n}^{HO} \\psi_{n}(x),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\psi_{n}(x)</math> is the <math>n</math>th energy eigenstate of <math>H^{HO}</math> with energy <math>E_{n}^{HO}</math>.

We define the operators\n\n:<math>A = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}}\\frac{d}{dx}+W(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>A^{\\dagger} = -\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}}\\frac{d}{dx}+W(x),</math>\n\nwhere <math>W(x)</math>, which we need to choose, is called the superpotential of <math>H^{HO}</math>. We also define the aforementioned partner Hamiltonians <math>H^{(1)}</math> and <math>H^{(2)}</math> as\n\n:<math>H^{(1)} = A^{\\dagger} A  = \\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}} W^{\\prime}(x) + W^{2}(x)</math>\n\n:<math>H^{(2)} = A A^{\\dagger} = \\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}} W^{\\prime}(x) + W^{2}(x).</math>\n\nA zero energy ground state <math>\\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x)</math> of <math>H^{(1)}</math> would satisfy the equation\n\n:<math>H^{(1)} \\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x) = A^{\\dagger} A \\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x)\n                    = A^{\\dagger} \\bigg(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}}\\frac{d}{dx}+ W(x)\\bigg) \\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x) = 0.</math>\n\nAssuming that we know the ground state of the harmonic oscillator <math>\\psi_{0}(x)</math>, we can solve for <math>W(x)</math> as\n\n:<math>W(x) = \\frac{-\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2m}} \\bigg(\\frac{\\psi_{0}^{\\prime}(x)}{\\psi_{0}(x)}\\bigg) = x \\sqrt{m \\omega^{2}/2} </math>\n\nWe then find that\n\n:<math>H^{(1)} = \\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{m \\omega^{2}}{2} x^{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} </math>\n\n:<math>H^{(2)} = \\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{m \\omega^{2}}{2} x^{2} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}.</math>\n\nWe can now see that\n\n:<math>H^{(1)} = H^{(2)} - \\hbar \\omega = H^{HO} - \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}.</math>\n\nThis is a special case of shape invariance, discussed below. Taking without proof the introductory theorem mentioned above, it is apparent that the spectrum of <math>H^{(1)}</math> will start with <math>E_{0} = 0</math> and continue upwards in steps of <math>\\hbar \\omega.</math> The spectra of <math>H^{(2)}</math> and <math>H^{HO}</math> will have the same even spacing, but will be shifted up by amounts <math>\\hbar \\omega</math> and <math>\\hbar \\omega / 2</math>, respectively. It follows that the spectrum of <math>H^{HO}</math> is therefore the familiar <math>E_{n}^{HO} = \\hbar \\omega (n + 1/2)</math>.\n\n==The SUSY QM superalgebra==\n\nIn fundamental quantum mechanics, we learn that an algebra of operators is defined by [[commutator|commutation]] relations among those operators.  For example, the canonical operators of position and momentum have the commutator <math>[x,p]=i</math>. (Here, we use \"[[natural unit]]s\" where [[Planck's constant]] is set equal to 1.)  A more intricate case is the algebra of [[angular momentum]] operators; these quantities are closely connected to the rotational symmetries of three-dimensional space.  To generalize this concept, we define an ''[[anticommutator]],'' which relates operators the same way as an ordinary [[commutator]], but with the opposite sign:\n\n:<math>\\{A,B\\} = AB + BA.</math>\n\nIf operators are related by anticommutators as well as commutators, we say they are part of a ''[[Lie superalgebra]].''  Let's say we have a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian <math>\\mathcal{H}</math> and a set of <math>N</math> operators <math>Q_i</math>''.''  We shall call this system ''supersymmetric'' if the following anticommutation relation is valid for all <math>i,j = 1,\\ldots,N</math>:\n\n:<math>\\{Q_i,Q^\\dagger_j\\} = \\mathcal{H}\\delta_{ij}.</math>\n\nIf this is the case, then we call ''<math>Q_i</math>'' the system's ''supercharges.''\n\n== Example ==\n\nLet's look at the example of a one-dimensional nonrelativistic particle with a 2D (''i.e.,'' two states) internal degree of freedom called \"spin\" (it's not really spin because \"real\" spin is a property of 3D particles). Let <math>b</math> be an operator which transforms a \"spin up\" particle into a \"spin down\" particle. Its adjoint <math>b^\\dagger</math> then transforms a spin down particle into a spin up particle; the operators are normalized such that the anticommutator <math>\\{b,b^\\dagger\\}=1</math>. And of course, <math>b^2=0</math>. Let <math>p</math> be the momentum of the particle and <math>x</math> be its position with <math>[x,p]=i</math>.  Let <math>W</math> (the \"[[superpotential]]\") be an arbitrary complex analytic function of <math>x</math> and define the supersymmetric operators\n\n:<math>Q_1=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(p-iW)b+(p+iW^\\dagger)b^\\dagger\\right]</math>\n:<math>Q_2=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[(p-iW)b-(p+iW^\\dagger)b^\\dagger\\right]</math>\n\nNote that <math>Q_1</math> and <math>Q_2</math> are self-adjoint. Let the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]\n\n:<math>H=\\{Q_1,Q_1\\}=\\{Q_2,Q_2\\}=\\frac{(p+\\Im\\{W\\})^2}{2}+\\frac{{\\Re\\{W\\}}^2}{2}+\\frac{\\Re\\{W\\}'}{2}(bb^\\dagger-b^\\dagger b)</math>\n\nwhere ''W<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' is the derivative of ''W''. Also note that {''Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>2</sub>''}=0. This is nothing other than ''N = 2'' supersymmetry. Note that <math>\\Im\\{W\\}</math> acts like an electromagnetic [[vector potential]].\n\nLet's also call the spin down state \"bosonic\" and the spin up state \"fermionic\". This is only in analogy to quantum field theory and should not be taken literally. Then, ''Q<sub>1</sub>'' and ''Q<sub>2</sub>'' maps \"bosonic\" states into \"fermionic\" states and vice versa.\n\nLet's reformulate this a bit:\n\nDefine\n\n:<math>Q=(p-iW)b</math>\n\nand of course,\n\n:<math>Q^\\dagger=(p+iW^\\dagger)b^\\dagger</math>\n\n:<math>\\{Q,Q\\}=\\{Q^\\dagger,Q^\\dagger\\}=0</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\{Q^\\dagger,Q\\}=2H</math>\n\nAn operator is \"bosonic\" if it maps \"bosonic\" states to \"bosonic\" states and \"fermionic\" states to \"fermionic\" states. An operator is \"fermionic\" if it maps \"bosonic\" states to \"fermionic\" states and vice versa. Any operator can be expressed uniquely as the sum of a bosonic operator and a fermionic operator. Define the [[supercommutator]] <nowiki>[,}</nowiki> as follows: Between two bosonic operators or a bosonic and a fermionic operator, it is none other than the [[commutator]] but between two fermionic operators, it is an [[anticommutator]].\n\nThen, x and p are bosonic operators and b, <math>b^\\dagger</math>, Q and <math>Q^\\dagger</math> are fermionic operators.\n\nLet's work in the [[Heisenberg picture]] where x, b and <math>b^\\dagger</math> are functions of time.\n\nThen,\n\n:<math>[Q,x\\}=-ib</math>\n:<math>[Q,b\\}=0</math>\n:<math>[Q,b^\\dagger\\}=\\frac{dx}{dt}-i\\Re\\{W\\}</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,x\\}=ib^\\dagger</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,b\\}=\\frac{dx}{dt}+i\\Re\\{W\\}</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,b^\\dagger\\}=0</math>\n\nThis is nonlinear in general: ''i.e.,'' x(t), b(t) and <math>b^\\dagger(t)</math> do not form a linear SUSY representation because <math>\\Re\\{W\\}</math> isn't necessarily linear in ''x.''  To avoid this problem, define the self-adjoint operator <math>F=\\Re\\{W\\}</math>. Then,\n\n:<math>[Q,x\\}=-ib</math>\n:<math>[Q,b\\}=0</math>\n:<math>[Q,b^\\dagger\\}=\\frac{dx}{dt}-iF</math>\n:<math>[Q,F\\}=-\\frac{db}{dt}</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,x\\}=ib^\\dagger</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,b\\}=\\frac{dx}{dt}+iF</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,b^\\dagger\\}=0</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,F\\}=\\frac{db^\\dagger}{dt}</math>\n\nand we see that we have a linear SUSY representation.\n\nNow let's introduce two \"formal\" quantities, <math>\\theta</math>; and <math>\\bar{\\theta}</math> with the latter being the adjoint of the former such that\n:<math>\\{\\theta,\\theta\\}=\\{\\bar{\\theta},\\bar{\\theta}\\}=\\{\\bar{\\theta},\\theta\\}=0</math>\n\nand both of them commute with bosonic operators but anticommute with fermionic ones.\n\nNext, we define a construct called a [[superfield]]:\n\n:<math>f(t,\\bar{\\theta},\\theta)=x(t)-i\\theta b(t)-i\\bar{\\theta}b^\\dagger(t)+\\bar{\\theta}\\theta F(t)</math>\n\n''f'' is self-adjoint, of course.  Then,\n\n:<math>[Q,f\\}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}f-i\\bar{\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f,</math>\n:<math>[Q^\\dagger,f\\}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{\\theta}}f-i\\theta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f.</math>\n\nIncidentally, there's also a U(1)<sub>R</sub> symmetry, with p and x and W having zero R-charges and <math>b^\\dagger</math> having an R-charge of 1 and b having an R-charge of -1.\n\n==Shape invariance==\n\nSuppose <math>W</math> is real for all real <math>x</math>. Then we can simplify the expression for the Hamiltonian to\n\n:<math>H = \\frac{(p)^2}{2}+\\frac{{W}^2}{2}+\\frac{W'}{2}(bb^\\dagger-b^\\dagger b)</math>\n\nThere are certain classes of superpotentials such that both the bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians have similar forms. Specifically\n\n:<math> V_{+} (x, a_1 ) = V_{-} (x, a_2) + R(a_1)</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a</math>'s are parameters. For example, the hydrogen atom potential with angular momentum <math>l</math> can be written this way.\n\n:<math> \\frac{-e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{h^2 l (l+1)} {2m} \\frac{1}{r^2} - E_0</math>\n\nThis corresponds to <math>V_{-}</math> for the superpotential\n\n:<math>W = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m}}{h} \\frac{e^2}{2 4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (l+1)} - \\frac{h(l+1)}{r\\sqrt{2m}}</math>\n:<math>V_+ = \\frac{-e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{h^2 (l+1) (l+2)} {2m} \\frac{1}{r^2} + \\frac{e^4 m}{32 \\pi^2 h^2 \\epsilon_0^2 (l+1)^2}</math>\n\nThis is the potential for <math>l+1</math> angular momentum shifted by a constant. After solving the <math>l=0</math> ground state, the supersymmetric operators can be used to construct the rest of the bound state spectrum.\n\nIn general, since <math>V_-</math> and <math>V_+</math> are partner potentials, they share the same energy spectrum except the one extra ground energy. We can continue this process of finding partner potentials with the shape invariance condition, giving the following formula for the energy levels in terms of the parameters of the potential\n\n:<math> E_n=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n R(a_i) </math>\n\nwhere <math>a_i</math> are the parameters for the multiple partnered potentials.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Supersymmetry algebra]]\n*[[Superalgebra]]\n*[[Supersymmetric gauge theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* F.

      "text": "{{Short description|theory of stochastic partial differential equations}}\n'''Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics''' or '''stochastics''' ('''STS''') is an exact theory of [[Stochastic differential equation|stochastic (partial) differential equations]] (SDEs), the class of mathematical models with the widest applicability covering, in particular, all continuous time [[dynamical system]]s, with and without noise. The main utility of the theory from the physical point of view is a rigorous theoretical explanation of the ubiquitous spontaneous long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself across disciplines via such phenomena as [[Pink noise|1/f]], [[Flicker noise|flicker]], and [[crackling noise|crackling]] noises and the power-law statistics, or [[Zipf's law]], of instantonic processes like earthquakes and neuroavalanches. From the mathematical point of view, STS is interesting because it bridges the two major parts of mathematical physics – the [[dynamical systems theory]] and [[Topological quantum field theories|topological field theories]]. Besides these and related disciplines such as [[algebraic topology]] and [[Quantum field theory|supersymmetric field theories]], STS is also connected with the traditional theory of [[stochastic differential equation]]s and the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators.\n\nThe theory began with the application of [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs,<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> that was later adapted to [[classical mechanics]]<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=Niemi|first=A.

This evolution has an intrinsic BRST or topological supersymmetry representing the preservation of topology and/or the concept of proximity in the [[phase space]] by continuous time dynamics. The theory identifies a model as [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], in the generalized, stochastic sense, if its ground state is not supersymmetric, i.e., if the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Accordingly, the emergent long-range behavior that always accompanies dynamical chaos and its derivatives such as [[turbulence]] and [[self-organized criticality]] can be understood as a consequence of the [[Goldstone theorem]].\n\n== History and relation to other theories ==\n\nThe first relation between supersymmetry and stochastic dynamics was established by [[Giorgio Parisi]] and Nicolas Sourlas<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Parisi|first=G.|last2=Sourlas|first2=N.|date=1979|title=Random Magnetic Fields, Supersymmetry, and Negative Dimensions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=43|issue=11|pages=744–745|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.43.744|bibcode=1979PhRvL..43..744P}}</ref><ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Parisi|first=G.|title=Supersymmetric field theories and stochastic differential equations|journal=Nuclear Physics B|language=en|volume=206|issue=2|pages=321–332|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(82)90538-7|year=1982|bibcode=1982NuPhB.206..321P}}</ref> who demonstrated that the application of the [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs, i.e., to SDEs with linear phase spaces, gradient flow vector fields, and additive noises, results in N=2 supersymmetric models.

This is a definitive feature of [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]] and in this particular case of BRST procedure approach to SDEs, the BRST symmetry can be also recognized as the topological supersymmetry.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA common way to explain the BRST procedure is to say that the BRST symmetry generates the fermionic version of the gauge transformations, whereas its overall effect on the path integral is to limit the integration only to configurations that satisfy a specified gauge condition. This interpretation also applies to Parisi-Sourlas approach with the deformations of the trajectory and the Langevin SDE playing the roles of the gauge transformations and the gauge condition respectively.\n\n=== Operator representation ===\nPhysical fermions in the high-energy physics and condensed matter models have antiperiodic boundary conditions in time. The unconventional periodic boundary conditions for fermions in the path integral expression for the Witten index is the origin of the topological character of this object. These boundary conditions reveal themselves in the operator representation of the Witten index as the alternating sign operator,<math display=\"block\">\n{\\mathcal W}  = \\operatorname{Tr}(-1)^{\\hat n} \\hat {\\mathcal M}_{tt'},\n</math>where <math display=\"inline\">\\hat n </math>  is the operator of the number of ghosts/fermions and the finite-time stochastic evolution operator (SEO), <math display=\"inline\"> \\hat{\\mathcal M }_{tt'} = e^{- (t-t')\\hat H }</math>, where, <math display=\"block\"> \\hat H = \\hat L_{-\\partial U} - \\Theta \\hat \\triangle= [\\hat d, \\hat{\\bar d}],</math>is the infinitesimal SEO with <math> \\textstyle \\hat{L} </math> being the Lie derivative along the subscript vector field, <math display=\"inline\"> \\hat \\triangle</math> being the Laplacian, <math> \\textstyle \\hat{d} = \\chi^i \\partial/\\partial x^i </math> being the [[exterior derivative]], which is the operator representative of the TS, and  <math> \\textstyle \\hat{\\bar d} = - (i\\hat{\\bar\\chi}_i) \\delta^{ij} ( \\partial_jU + \\Theta (i\\hat B_j)) </math>, where <math>i {\\hat B}_j = \\partial/ \\partial x^j</math>  and <math>i{\\hat{\\bar \\chi}}_j = \\partial/ \\partial \\chi^j</math> are bosonic and fermionic momenta, and with square brackets denoting bi-graded commutator, i.e., it is an anticommutator if both operators are fermionic (contain odd total number of <math> \\chi </math>'s and <math> \\hat {\\bar \\chi} </math>'s) and a commutator otherwise. The exterior derivative and <math> \\textstyle \\hat{\\bar d} </math> are [[supercharge]]s. They are [[nilpotent]], e.g., <math>\\hat d^2=0</math>, and commutative with the SEO.

The 1D TNSM is defined for [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian phase spaces]] while for Euclidean phase spaces it reduces to the Parisi-Sourlas model. Its key difference from STS is the diffusion operator which is the [[Hodge Laplacian]] for 1D TNSM and <math> \\textstyle \\hat  L_{e_a} \\hat  L_{e_a} </math>for STS . This difference in unimportant in the context of relation between STS and algebraic topology, the relation established by the theory of 1D TNSM (see, e.g., Refs.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":3\" />).\n\nThe model is defined by the following evolution operator <math display=\"inline\"> \\hat H = \\hat L_{-\\partial U} + \\Theta[\\hat d, \\hat{d}^\\dagger]</math>, where <math display=\"inline\"> (\\partial U)^i = g^{ij}\\partial_j U</math> with <math display=\"inline\"> g</math> being the metric, <math display=\"inline\"> [\\hat d, \\hat{d}^\\dagger]</math> is the [[Hodge Laplacian]], and the [[differential form]]s from the [[exterior algebra]] of the phase space, <math display=\"inline\"> \\Omega(X)</math>, are viewed as wavefunctions. There exists a similarity transformation, <math>\\hat H \\to {\\hat H}_U = e^{U/2\\Theta} \\hat H e^{- U/2\\Theta} </math>, that brings the evolution operator to the explicitly Hermitian form <math>{\\hat H}_U = \\Theta [\\hat d_U, \\hat d_U^\\dagger] </math> with <math>\\hat d_U = e^{U/2\\Theta} \\hat d e^{-U/2\\Theta} = \n\\chi^i(\\partial/\\partial x^i - \\partial_i U /2\\Theta)   </math>. In the Euclidean case, <math>{\\hat H}_U </math> is the Hamiltonian of a N=2 [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. One can introduce two Hermitian operators, <math>\\hat q_1 = (\\hat d_U + \\hat d_U^\\dagger) /2^{1/2}   </math> and <math>\\hat q_2 = i (\\hat d_U - \\hat d_U^\\dagger) /2^{1/2}   </math>, such that <math>{\\hat H}_U = \\Theta \\hat q_1^2 = \\Theta \\hat q_2^2 </math> . This demonstrates that the spectrum of <math>{\\hat H}_U </math> and/or <math>{\\hat H} </math> is real and nonnegative. This is also true for SEOs of Langevin SDEs. For the SDEs of arbitrary form, however, this is no longer true as the eigenvalues of the SEO can be negative and even complex, which actually allows for the TS to be broken spontanenously.\n\nThe following properties of the evolution operator of 1D TNSM hold even for the SEO of the SDEs of arbitrary form. The evolution operator commutes with the operator of the degree of differential forms. As a result, <math>\\textstyle \\hat H  = \\hat H^{(\\dim X)} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus \\hat H^{(0)} </math>, where <math> \\textstyle \\hat H^{(k)} = \\hat H |_{\\Omega^{(k)}} </math> and <math> \\Omega^{(n)}(X) </math> is the space of differential forms of degree <math> n </math>. Furthermore, due to the presence of TS, <math display=\"inline\"> \\Omega(X)={\\mathcal H} \\oplus {\\mathcal N} \\oplus (\\hat d {\\mathcal N})</math>, where <math display=\"inline\"> {\\mathcal H}</math> are the supersymmetric eigenstates, <math display=\"inline\"> \\theta's</math>, non-trivial in [[de Rham cohomology]] whereas the rest are the pairs of non-supersymmetric eigenstates of the form <math display=\"inline\"> |\\vartheta\\rangle </math> and <math display=\"inline\"> \\hat d |\\vartheta\\rangle </math>. All supersymmetric eigenstates have exactly zero eigenvalue and, barring accidental situations, all non-supersymmetric states have non-zero eigenvalues. Non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates do not contribute to the Witten index, which equals the difference in the numbers of the supersymmetric states of even and odd degrees, <math display=\"inline\">\n{\\mathcal W}  = \\#\\{\\text{even }\\theta's\\} - \\#\\{\\text{odd }\\theta's\\}.\n</math>For compact <math> X </math>, each de Rham cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate and the Witten index equals the Euler characteristic of the phase space.\n\n==  BRST procedure for SDEs of arbitrary form ==\nThe Parisi-Sourlas method of BRST procedure approach to Langevin SDEs have also been adapted to classical mechanics,<ref name=\":1\" /> stochastic generalization of classical mechanics,<ref name=\":13\" /> higher order Langevin SDEs,<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Kleinert|first=H.|last2=Shabanov|first2=S.

The topological interpretation of the BRST procedure is just the same and the path integral representation of the Witten index is defined by the gauge fermion, <math>\\textstyle \\Psi</math>, given by the same expression but with the generalized version of<math display=\"inline\"> \\textstyle \\bar d = \\imath_{F} - \\Theta \\imath_{e_a} (Q,\\imath_{e_a})</math>. There is one important subtlety, however, that appears on the way to the operator representation of the model. Unlike for Langevin SDEs, classical mechanics, and other SDEs with additive noises, the path integral representation of the finite-time SEO is an ambiguous object. This ambiguity originates from non-commutativity of momenta and position operators, e.g., <math> \\hat B \\hat x \\ne  \\hat x \\hat B </math>. As a result, <math> B(\\tau) x(\\tau)  </math> in the path integral representation has a whole one-parameter family of possible interpretations in the operator representation, <math> (\\alpha \\hat B \\hat x + (1-\\alpha)\\hat x \\hat B)|\\psi(\\tau)\\rangle  </math>, where <math> |\\psi(\\tau)\\rangle  </math> denotes an arbitrary wavefunction. Accordingly, there is a whole <math>\\alpha</math>-family of infinitesimal SEOs,   <math display=\"block\"> \\hat H_\\alpha = \\hat L_F - \\Theta\\hat L_{e_a} \\hat L_{e_a}= [\\hat d, \\hat{\\bar d}_\\alpha],</math>with  <math> \\textstyle \\hat{\\bar d}_\\alpha = \\hat{\\imath}_{F_\\alpha} - \\Theta \\hat{\\imath}_{e_a}\\hat  L_{e_a} </math>, <math>\\hat{\\imath}_{F_\\alpha}</math> being the [[interior multiplication]] by the subscript vector field, and the \"shifted\" flow vector field being <math> \\textstyle F_\\alpha = F - \\Theta(2\\alpha-1)(e_a\\cdot\\partial) e_a </math>. Noteworthy, unlike in Langevin SDEs, <math>\\hat {\\bar d}_\\alpha</math> is not a [[supercharge]] and STS cannot be identified as a N=2 supersymmetric theory in the general case.\n\nThe path integral representation of stochastic dynamics is equivalent to the traditional understanding of SDEs as of a continuous time limit of [[stochastic difference equation]]s where different choices of parameter <math> \\alpha </math> are called \"interpretations\" of SDEs. The choice <math> \\alpha=1/2  </math>, for which <math> \\textstyle F_{1/2} = F </math> and which is known in quantum theory as [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl symmetrization]] rule, is known as the [[Stratonovich integral|Stratonovich interpretation]], whereas <math> \\alpha=1  </math> as the [[Itô calculus|Ito interpretation]]. While in quantum theory the Weyl symmetrization is preferred because it guaranties hermiticity of Hamiltonians, in STS the Weyl-Stratonovich approach is preferred because it corresponds to the most natural mathematical meaning of the finite-time SEO discussed [[Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics#Supersymmetric theory of SDEs without BRST quantization|below]]—the stochastically averaged pullback induced by the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms.\n\n=== Eigensystem of stochastic evolution operator ===\n\n[[File:Possible types of spectra of SEO of STS 3 sphere.png|thumb|The three possible types of SEO spectra on a 3D sphere.

This explanation is based on understanding of the finite-time SEO as a stochastically averaged pullback of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms (see subsection above). In this picture, the question of why any SDE has TS is the same as the question of why [[exterior derivative]] commutes with the pullback of any diffeomorphism. The answer to this question is differentiability of the corresponding map.  In other words, the presence of TS is the algebraic version of the statement that continuous-time flow preserves continuity of <math>X</math>. Two initially close points will remain close during evolution, which is just yet another way of saying that <math>M_{tt'}</math> is a diffeomorphism.\n\nIn deterministic chaotic models, initially close points can part in the limit of infinitely long temporal evolution. This is the famous [[butterfly effect]], which is equivalent to the statement that <math>M_{tt'}</math> losses differentiability in this limit. In algebraic representation of dynamics, the evolution in the infinitely long time limit is described by the ground state of the SEO and the butterfly effect is equivalent to the spontaneous breakdown of TS, i.e., to the situation when the ground state is not supersymmetric. Noteworthy, unlike traditional understanding of deterministic chaotic dynamics, the spontaneous breakdown of TS works also for stochastic cases. This is the most important generalization because deterministic dynamics is, in fact, a mathematical idealization. Real dynamical systems cannot be isolated from their environments and thus always experience stochastic influence.\n\n== Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and dynamical chaos ==\n\nBRST gauge fixing procedure applied to SDEs leads directly to the Witten index. The Witten index is of topological character and it does not respond to any perturbation. In particular, all response correlators calculated using the Witten index vanish. This fact has a physical interpretation within the STS: the physical meaning of the Witten index is the partition function of the noise<ref name=\":8\" /> and since there is no backaction from the dynamical system to the noise, the Witten index has no information on the details of the SDE. In contrast, the information on the details of the model is contained in the other trace-like object of the theory, the dynamical partition function, <math display=\"block\"> {\\mathcal Z}_{tt'} = \\int\\dots\\int_{a.p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\\Psi)}D\\Phi = \\operatorname{Tr} \\hat {\\mathcal M}_{tt'},</math>where a.p.b.c. denotes antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields and periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fields. In the standard manner, the dynamical partition function can be promoted to the [[generating function]]al by coupling the model to external probing fields.\n\nFor a wide class of models, dynamical partition function provides lower bound for the stochastically averaged number of fixed points of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms,<math display=\"block\"> \\left.{\\mathcal Z}_{tt'}\\right|_{t-t'\\to\\infty} = \\sum\\nolimits_{p} e^{-(t-t'){\\mathsf E}_p} \\le  \\langle \n\\#\\{\\text{fixed points of } M_{t't}\\} \\rangle_\\text{noise} \\propto e^{(t-t')S} .</math>Here, index <math> p </math> runs over \"physical states\", i.e., the eigenstates that grow fastest with the rate of the exponential growth given as,<math display=\"inline\"> \\Gamma_g = - \\min_\\alpha \\operatorname{Re} {\\mathsf E}_\\alpha \\ge 0 </math>, and parameter <math> S </math> can be viewed as stochastic version of dynamical entropy such as [[topological entropy]]. Positive entropy is one of the key signatures of deterministic chaos. Therefore, the situation with positive <math> \\Gamma_g </math> must be identified as chaotic in the generalized, stochastic sense as it implies positive entropy: <math> 0 < \\Gamma_g \\le S </math>. At the same time, positive <math> \\Gamma_g </math> implies that TS is broken spontaneously, that is, the ground state in not supersymmetric because its eigenvalue is not zero. In other words, positive dynamical entropy is a reason to identify spontaneous TS breaking as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos. Noteworthy, Langevin SDEs are never chaotic because the spectrum of their SEO is real non-negative.\n\nThe complete list of reasons why spontaneous TS breaking must be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos is as follows. \n* Positive dynamical entropy.\n* According to the [[Goldstone's theorem]], spontaneous TS breaking must tailor a long-range dynamical behavior, one of the manifestations of which is the [[butterfly effect]] discussed above in the context of the meaning of TS.\n* From the properties of the eigensystem of SEO, TS can be spontaneously broken only if <math> \\dim X \\ge 3 </math>. This conclusion can be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|Poincare–Bendixson theorem]] for deterministic chaos.\n* In the deterministic case, [[Integrable system|integrable models in the sense of dynamical systems]] have well-defined global  [[Stable manifold|stable and unstable manifolds]] of <math> F </math>. The bras/kets of the global ground states of such models are the Poincare duals of the global stable/unstable manifolds. These ground states are supersymmetric so that TS is not broken spontaneously. On the contrary, when the model is non-integrable or chaotic, its global (un)stable manifolds are not well-defined topological manifolds, but rather have a fractal, self-recurrent structure that can be captured using the concept of branching manifolds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The topology of chaos : Alice in stretch and squeezeland|last=Gilmore|first=R.|last2=Lefranc|first2=M.|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527410675|location=|pages=|oclc=967841676}}</ref> Wavefunctions that can represent such manifolds cannot be supersymmetric. Therefore, TS breaking is intrinsically related to the concept of non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, which is actually yet another widely accepted definition of deterministic chaos.\nAll the above features of TS breaking work for both deterministic and stochastic models. This is in contrast with the traditional [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]] whose trajectory-based properties such as the [[topological mixing]] cannot in principle be generalized to stochastic case because, just like in quantum dynamics, all trajectories are possible in the presence of noise and, say, the topological mixing property is satisfied trivially by all models with non-zero noise intensity.\n\n== STS as a topological field theory ==\n[[File:STS Explanation of Instanton Matrix Element.png|thumb|The square '''acbd''' represents an instanton, i.e, the family of trajectories of deterministic flow (dotted arrowed curves) leading from one critical point (b) to another (a).

There are other classes of topological objects. One class of objects is related to [[instanton]]s, i.e., transient dynamics. Crumpling paper, protein folding, and many other nonlinear dynamical processes in response to quenches, i.e., to external (sudden) changes of parameters, can be recognized as instantonic dynamics. From the mathematical point of view, instantons are families of solutions of deterministic equations of motion, <math>\\dot x = F </math>, that lead from, say, less stable fixed point of <math> F </math> to a more stable fixed point. Certain matrix elements calculated on instantons are of topological nature.

The critical points have different indexes of stability so that the states <math>|a\\rangle </math> and <math>|b\\rangle </math> are topologically inequivalent as they represent unstable manifolds of different dimensionalities. The above matrix elements are independent of <math> t_i's </math> as they actually represent the intersection number of <math>O</math>-manifolds on the instanton as exemplified in the figure.\n\nThe above instantonic matrix elements are exact only in the deterministic limit. In the general stochastic case, one can consider global supersymmetric states, <math> \\theta</math>'s, from the [[De Rham cohomology]] classes of <math>X</math> and observables, <math> \\gamma </math>, that are Poincare duals of [[closed manifold]]s non-trivial in [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of <math>X</math>.

For example, STS offers a promising realization of the concept of [[supersymmetry]]. In general, there are two major problems in the context of supersymmetry. The first is establishing connections between this mathematical entity and the real world. Within STS, supersymmetry is the most common symmetry in nature because it is pertinent to all continuous time dynamical systems. The second is the [[Supersymmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry]]. This problem is particularly important for particle physics because supersymmetry of [[elementary particle]]s, if exists at extremely short scale, must be broken spontaneously at large scale. This problem is nontrivial because supersymmetries are hard to break spontaneously, the very reason behind the introduction of [[Soft SUSY breaking|soft or explicit supersymmetry breaking]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=D.

Symmetric phase can be identified as thermal equilibrium (T). Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos (C) because it hosts conventional deterministic chaos. Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos (N) because TS broking involves antiinstantons that disappear in the deterministic limit. The N''-''phase is also known in the literature as self-organized criticality.]]\n\nSTS provides classification for stochastic models depending on whether TS is broken and integrability of flow vector field. In can be exemplified as a part of the general phase diagram at the [[Edge of chaos|border of chaos]] (see figure on the right). The phase diagram has the following properties:   \n* For physical models, TS gets restored eventually with the increase of noise intensity. \n* Symmetric phase can be called thermal equilibrium or T-phase because the ground state is the supersymmetric state of steady-state total probability distribution. \n* In the deterministic limit, ordered phase is equivalent to deterministic chaotic dynamics with non-integrable flow. \n* Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos or C-phase because ordinary deterministic chaos belongs to it. \n* Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos or N-phase because it disappears in the deterministic limit. TS is broken by the condensation of (anti-)instantons (see below).   \n* At stronger noises, the sharp N-C boundary must smear out into a crossover because (anti-)instantons lose their individuality and it is hard for an external observer to tell one tunneling process from another.\n\n=== Demystification of self-organized criticality ===\nMany sudden (or instantonic) processes in nature, such as, e.g., [[crackling noise]], exhibit scale-free statistics often called the [[Zipf's law]]. As an explanation for this peculiar spontaneous dynamical behavior, it was proposed to believe that some stochastic dynamical systems have a tendency to self-tune themselves into a [[Critical point (physics)|critical point]], the phenomenological approach known as [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=N.

Specifically, the definitive feature of the N-phase is the peculiar mechanism of the TS breaking. Unlike in the C-phase, where the TS is broken by the non-integrability of the flow, in the ''N''-phase, the TS is spontaneously broken due to the condensation of the configurations of instantons and noise-induced antiinstantons, i.e., time-reversed instantons. These processes can be roughly interpreted as the noise-induced tunneling events between, e.g., different attractors. Qualitatively, the dynamics in the ''N''-phase appears to an external observer as a sequence of sudden jumps or \"avalanches\" that must exhibit a scale-free behavior/statistics as a result of the [[Goldstone theorem]].

In case of quenches across phase transitions, this behavior is often attributed to the proximity of criticality. At the same time, other quenches, not across a phase transition, are also known to exhibit long-range characteristics with the best known examples being the [[Barkhausen effect]] and other realizations of the concept of [[crackling noise]]. It is intuitively appealing that theoretical explanation for the scale-free behavior in quenches must be the same disregard whether the quench is across a phase transition or not. STS offers such an explanation. Namely, transient dynamics is essentially a composite instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior. This understanding is supported by the fact that condensed instantons lead to appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frenkel|first=E.|last2=Losev|first2=A.|last3=Nekrasov|first3=N.|title=Notes on instantons in topological field theory and beyond|journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|language=en|volume=171|pages=215–230|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2007.06.013|year=2007|bibcode=2007NuPhS.171..215F|arxiv=hep-th/0702137}}</ref> This picture of transient dynamics explains computational efficiency of the digital memcomputing machines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Ventra|first=M.|last2=Traversa|first2=F.

For example, the spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry in a liquid is the mathematical essence of crystallization or spatial \"ordering\" of molecules into a lattice. Therefore, spontaneous TS breaking picture of chaotic dynamics is in a certain sense opposite to the semantics of word \"chaos\". Due to its temporal character, it is actually [[Chronos]], not [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], that appears to be the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial Greek deity]] closest in its spirit to the TS breaking order. Perhaps, a more accurate identifier than \"chaos\" should be coined for TS breaking in the future. As of this moment, this qualitatively new understanding of dynamical chaos already points into a research direction that may lead to resolutions of some important problems such as turbulence and neurodynamics. Namely, as in case of any other \"ordering\", a simplified yet accurate description of chaotic dynamics can be achieved in terms of the low-energy effective theory for an [[Phase transitions#Order parameters|order parameter]]. While the low-energy [[Effective action|effective description]] of chaotic dynamics may be very case specific, its order parameter must always be a representative of the gapless fermions or goldstinos of the spontaneously broken TS.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]\n[[Category:Chaos theory]]\n[[Category:Mathematical physics]]\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Applied and interdisciplinary physics]]\n[[Category:Complex systems theory]]\n[[Category:Theoretical physics]]\n[[Category:Self-organization]]\n[[Category:Stochastic processes]]\n[[Category:Quantum field theory|Category:Quantum Field Theory]]"

      "text": "In [[theoretical physics]] a '''nonrenormalization theorem''' is a limitation on how a certain quantity in the classical description of a [[quantum field theory]] may be modified by [[renormalization]] in the full quantum theory.  Renormalization theorems are common in theories with a sufficient amount of [[supersymmetry]], usually at least 4 [[supercharges]].\n\nPerhaps the first nonrenormalization theorem was introduced by [[Marcus T. Grisaru]], [[Martin Rocek]] and [[Warren Siegel]] in their 1979 paper [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=NUPHA,B159,429 Improved methods for supergraphs].\n\n==Nonrenormalization in supersymmetric theories and holomorphy==\n\nNonrenormalization theorems in supersymmetric theories are often consequences of the fact that certain objects  must have a holomorphic dependence on the [[quantum field]]s and [[coupling constant]]s.  In this case the nonrenormalization theory is said to be a consequence of [[holomorphic function|holomorphy]].\n\nThe more supersymmetry a theory has, the more renormalization theorems apply.  Therefore a renormalization theorem that is valid for a theory with <math>\\mathcal{N}</math> supersymmetries will also apply to any theory with more than <math>\\mathcal{N}</math> supersymmetries.\n\n===Examples in 4-dimensional theories===\n\nIn 4 dimensions the number <math>\\mathcal{N}</math> counts the number of 4-component [[Majorana spinor|Majorana]] spinors of supercharges.  Some examples of nonrenormalization theorems in 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories are:\n\nIn an <math>\\mathcal{N}=1</math> 4D SUSY theory involving only chiral superfields, the [[superpotential]] is immune from renormalization.  With an arbitrary field content it is immune from renormalization in perturbation theory but may be renormalized by nonperturbative effects such as [[instantons]].\n\nIn an <math>\\mathcal{N}=2</math> 4D SUSY theory the [[moduli space]] of the [[supermultiplet|hypermultiplets]], called the [[Higgs branch]], has a [[hyper-Kähler manifold|hyper-Kähler metric]] and is not renormalized.   In the article [http://inspirehep.net/record/207648 Lagrangians of N=2 Supergravity - Matter Systems] it was further shown that this metric is independent of the [[scalar (physics)|scalars]] in the [[vector superfield|vector multiplets]].  They also proved that the metric of the [[Coulomb branch]], which is a rigid special [[Kähler manifold]] parametrized by the scalars in <math>\\mathcal{N}=2</math> vector multiplets, is independent of the scalars in the hypermultiplets.  Therefore the vacuum manifold is locally a product of a Coulomb and Higgs branch.  The derivations of these statements appear in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9603042 The Moduli Space of N=2 SUSY QCD and Duality in N=1 SUSY QCD].\n\nIn an <math>\\mathcal{N}=2</math> 4D SUSY theory the superpotential is entirely determined by the matter content of the theory.  Also there are no perturbative corrections to the &beta;-function beyond one-loop, as was shown in 1983 in the article [https://archive.is/20121211100405/http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?eprint=hep-th/0108200  Superspace Or One Thousand and One Lessons in Supersymmetry] by [[Sylvester James Gates]], Marcus Grisaru, Martin Rocek and Warren Siegel.\n\nIn [[N=4 super Yang–Mills|<math>\\mathcal{N}=4</math> super Yang–Mills]] the &beta;-function is zero for all couplings, meaning that the theory is [[conformal field theory|conformal]].  This was demonstrated perturbatively by [[Martin Sohnius]] and [[Peter West]] in the 1981 article [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=PHLTA,B100,245  Conformal Invariance in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory] under certain symmetry assumptions on the theory, and then with no assumptions by [[Stanley Mandelstam]] in the 1983 article [http://inspirehep.net/record/179486  Light Cone Superspace and the Ultraviolet Finiteness of the N=4 Model].  The full nonperturbative proof by [[Nathan Seiberg]] appeared in the 1988 article [http://inspirehep.net/record/23243  Supersymmetry and Nonperturbative beta Functions].\n\n===Examples in 3-dimensional theories===\n\nIn 3 dimensions the number <math>\\mathcal{N}</math> counts the number of 2-component [[Majorana spinor|Majorana]] spinors of supercharges.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathcal{N}=1</math> there is no holomorphicity and few exact results are known.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathcal{N}=2</math> the superpotential cannot depend on the [[linear multiplet]]s and in particular is independent of the [[Fayet-Iliopoulos term]]s (FI) and [[Majorana spinor|Majorana mass]] terms.   On the other hand the [[central charge]] is independent of the chiral multiplets, and so is a linear combination of the FI and Majorana mass terms.  These two theorems were stated and proven in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9703110 Aspects of N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories in Three Dimensions].\n\nWhen <math>\\mathcal{N}=3</math>, unlike <math>\\mathcal{N}=2</math>, the [[R-symmetry]] is the [[nonabelian group]] SU(2) and so the [[representation theory|representation]] of each [[quantum field|field]] is not renormalized.  In a [[super conformal field theory]] the [[conformal dimension]] of a [[chiral superfield|chiral multiplet]] is entirely determined by its R-charge, and so these conformal dimensions are not renormalized.  Therefore matter fields have no [[wave function renormalization]] in <math>\\mathcal{N}=3</math> superconformal field theories, as was shown in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9902033 On Mirror Symmetry in Three Dimensional Abelian Gauge Theories].  These theories consist of vector multiplets and [[hypermultiplet]]s.  The hypermultiplet metric is [[hyperkähler]] and may not be lifted by quantum corrections, but its metric may be modified.  No [[renormalization|renormalizable]] interaction between hyper and abelian vector multiplets is possible except for [[Chern–Simons theory|Chern–Simons terms]].\n\nWhen <math>\\mathcal{N}=4</math>, unlike <math>\\mathcal{N}=3</math> the hypermultiplet metric may no longer be modified by quantum corrections.\n\n===Examples in 2-dimensional theories===\nIn <math>\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)</math>{{clarify|date=March 2016}} [[linear sigma model]]s, which are superrenormalizable [[abelian group|abelian]] [[gauge theories]] with matter in [[chiral superfield|chiral supermultiplet]]s, [[Edward Witten]] has argued in [https://archive.is/20121211170526/http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?eprint=hep-th/9301042  Phases of N=2 theories in two-dimensions] that the only divergent quantum correction is the [[logarithm]]ic one-loop correction to the FI term.\n\n==Nonrenormalization from a quantization condition==\n\nIn supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories, the nonrenormalization of a quantity subject to the [[Dirac quantization condition]] is often a consequence of the fact that possible renormalizations would be inconsistent with the quantization condition, for example the quantization of the level of a [[Chern–Simons theory]] implies that it may only be renormalized at one-loop.  In the 1994 article [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9401053  Nonrenormalization Theorem for Gauge Coupling in 2+1D] the authors find the renormalization of the level can only be a finite shift, independent of the energy scale, and extended this result to topologically massive theories in which one includes a [[kinetic energy|kinetic term]] for the [[gluon]]s.  In [https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3740 Notes on Superconformal Chern-Simons-Matter Theories] the authors then showed that this shift needs to occur at one loop, because any renormalization at higher loops would introduce inverse powers of the level, which are nonintegral and so would be in conflict with the quantization condition.\n\n==References==\n*[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9309335 N.

The study of super vector spaces and their generalizations is sometimes called '''super linear algebra'''. These objects find their principal application in [[theoretical physics]] where they are used to describe the various algebraic aspects of [[supersymmetry]].\n\n== Definitions ==\n\nA super vector space is a <math>\\mathbb Z_2</math>-graded vector space with decomposition<ref>{{harvnb|Varadarajan|2004|p=83}}</ref>\n\n:<math>V = V_0 + V_1,\\quad 0, 1 \\in \\mathbb Z_2 = \\mathbb Z/2\\mathbb Z.</math>\n\nVectors that are elements of either <math>V_0</math> or <math>V_1</math> are said to be ''homogeneous''. The ''parity'' of a nonzero homogeneous element, denoted by <math>|x|</math>, is <math>0</math> or <math>1</math> according to whether it is in <math>V_0</math> or <math>V_1</math>,\n\n:<math>|x| = \\begin{cases}0 & x\\in V_0\\\\1 & x\\in V_1\\end{cases}</math>\n\nVectors of parity 0 are called ''even'' and those of parity 1 are called ''odd''. In theoretical physics, the even elements are sometimes called ''Bose elements'' or ''bosonic'', and the odd elements ''Fermi elements'' or fermionic. Definitions for super vector spaces are often given only in terms of homogeneous elements and then extended to nonhomogeneous elements by linearity.\n\nIf <math>V</math> is [[finite-dimensional]] and the dimensions of <math>V_0</math> and <math>V_1</math> are <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> respectively, then <math>V</math> is said to have ''dimension'' <math>p|q</math>. The standard super coordinate space, denoted <math>\\mathbb K^{p|q}</math>, is the ordinary [[coordinate space]] <math>\\mathbb K^{p+q}</math> where the even subspace is spanned by the first <math>p</math> coordinate basis vectors and the odd space is spanned by the last <math>q</math>.\n\nA ''homogeneous subspace'' of a super vector space is a [[linear subspace]] that is spanned by homogeneous elements. Homogeneous subspaces are super vector spaces in their own right (with the obvious grading).\n\nFor any super vector space <math>V</math>, one can define the ''parity reversed space'' <math>\\Pi V</math> to be the super vector space with the even and odd subspaces interchanged. That is,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(\\Pi V)_0 &= V_1 \\\\\n(\\Pi V)_1 &= V_0.\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Linear transformations==\n\nA [[homomorphism]], a [[morphism]] in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of super vector spaces, from one super vector space to another is a grade-preserving [[linear transformation]].

Given a field <math>\\mathbb K</math> let\n\n:<math>R = \\mathbb{K} [\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_N]</math>\n\ndenote the Grassmann algebra [[Generating set of a module|generated]] by <math>N</math> anticommuting odd elements <math>\\theta_i</math>. Any super vector <math>V</math> space over <math>\\mathbb K</math> can be embedded in a module over <math>R</math> by considering the (graded) tensor product\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{K}[\\theta_1, \\cdots, \\theta_N]\\otimes V.</math>\n\n==The category of super vector spaces==\n\nThe '''category of super vector spaces''', denoted by <math>\\mathbb K-\\mathrm{SVect}</math>, is the [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[object (category theory)|object]]s are super vector spaces (over a fixed field <math>\\mathbb K</math>) and whose [[morphism]]s are ''even'' linear transformations (i.e. the grade preserving ones).\n\nThe categorical approach to super linear algebra is to first formulate definitions and theorems regarding ordinary (ungraded) algebraic objects in the language of [[category theory]] and then transfer these directly to the category of super vector spaces. This leads to a treatment of \"superobjects\" such as [[superalgebra]]s, [[Lie superalgebra]]s, [[supergroup (physics)|supergroup]]s, etc. that is completely analogous to their ungraded counterparts.\n\nThe category <math>\\mathbb K-\\mathrm{SVect}</math> is a [[monoidal category]] with the super tensor product as the monoidal product and the purely even super vector space <math>\\mathbb K^{1|0}</math> as the unit object. The involutive braiding operator\n\n:<math>\\tau_{V,W}: V\\otimes W \\rightarrow W\\otimes V,</math>\n\ngiven by\n\n:<math>\\tau_{V,W}(x\\otimes y)=(-1)^{|x||y|}y \\otimes x</math>\n\non homogeneous elements, turns <math>\\mathbb K-\\mathrm{SVect}</math> into a [[symmetric monoidal category]]. This commutativity isomorphism encodes the \"rule of signs\" that is essential to super linear algebra. It effectively says that a minus sign is picked up whenever two odd elements are interchanged. One need not worry about signs in the categorical setting as long as the above operator is used wherever appropriate.\n\n\n<math>\\mathbb K-\\mathrm{SVect}</math> is also a [[closed monoidal category]] with the [[internal Hom object]], <math>\\mathbf{Hom}(V, W)</math>, given by the super vector space of ''all'' linear maps from <math>V</math> to <math>W</math>. The ordinary <math>\\mathrm{Hom}</math> set <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(V, W)</math> is the even subspace therein:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Hom}(V, W) = \\mathbf{Hom}(V,W)_0.</math>\n\n\nThe fact that <math>\\mathbb K-\\mathrm{SVect}</math> is closed means that the functor <math>-\\otimes V</math> is [[left adjoint]] to the functor <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(V, -)</math>, given a natural bijection\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Hom}(U\\otimes V, W) \\cong \\mathrm{Hom}(U,\\mathbf{Hom}(V,W)).</math>\n\n== Superalgebra ==\n{{main|superalgebra}}\nA [[superalgebra]] over <math>\\mathbb K</math> can be described as a super vector space <math>\\mathcal A</math> with a multiplication map\n\n:<math>\\mu : \\mathcal A \\otimes \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal A,</math>\n\nthat is a super vector space homomorphism.

      "text": "{{about|supermatrices in [[super linear algebra]]|text=In other contexts, “supermatrix” is sometimes used as a synonym for [[block matrix]]}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], a '''supermatrix''' is a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-graded analog of an ordinary [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. Specifically, a supermatrix is a 2&times;2 [[block matrix]] with entries in a [[superalgebra]] (or [[superring]]). The most important examples are those with entries in a [[commutative superalgebra]] (such as a [[Grassmann algebra]]) or an ordinary [[field (mathematics)|field]] (thought of as a purely even commutative superalgebra).\n\nSupermatrices arise in the study of [[super linear algebra]] where they appear as the coordinate representations of a [[linear transformation]]s between finite-dimensional [[super vector space]]s or free [[supermodule]]s. They have important applications in the field of [[supersymmetry]].\n\n==Definitions and notation==\n\nLet ''R'' be a fixed [[superalgebra]] (assumed to be [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative]]). Often one requires ''R'' be [[supercommutative]] as well (for essentially the same reasons as in the ungraded case).\n\nLet ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', and ''s'' be nonnegative integers. A '''supermatrix''' of dimension (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with entries in ''R'' that is partitioned into a 2&times;2 [[block matrix|block structure]]\n:<math>X = \\begin{bmatrix}X_{00} & X_{01} \\\\ X_{10} & X_{11}\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nwith ''r''+''s'' total rows and ''p''+''q'' total columns (so that the submatrix ''X''<sub>00</sub> has dimensions ''r''&times;''p'' and ''X''<sub>11</sub> has dimensions ''s''&times;''q''). An ordinary (ungraded) matrix can be thought of as a supermatrix for which ''q'' and ''s'' are both zero.\n\nA ''square'' supermatrix is one for which (''r''|''s'') = (''p''|''q''). This means that not only is the unpartitioned matrix ''X'' [[square matrix|square]], but the diagonal blocks ''X''<sub>00</sub> and ''X''<sub>11</sub> are as well.\n\nAn '''even supermatrix''' is one for which diagonal blocks (''X''<sub>00</sub> and ''X''<sub>11</sub>) consist solely of even elements of ''R'' (i.e. homogeneous elements of parity 0) and the off-diagonal blocks (''X''<sub>01</sub> and ''X''<sub>10</sub>) consist solely of odd elements of ''R''.\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathrm{even} & \\mathrm{odd} \\\\ \\mathrm{odd}& \\mathrm{even} \\end{bmatrix}</math>\nAn '''odd supermatrix''' is one for the reverse holds: the diagonal blocks are odd and the off-diagonal blocks are even.\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathrm{odd} & \\mathrm{even} \\\\ \\mathrm{even}& \\mathrm{odd} \\end{bmatrix}</math>\nIf the scalars ''R'' are purely even there are no nonzero odd elements, so the even supermatices are the [[block diagonal]] ones and the odd supermatrices are the off-diagonal ones.\n\nA supermatrix is '''homogeneous''' if it is either even or odd. The '''parity''', |''X''|, of a nonzero homogeneous supermatrix ''X'' is 0 or 1 according to whether it is even or odd. Every supermatrix can be written uniquely as the sum of an even supermatrix and an odd one.\n\n==Algebraic structure==\n\nSupermatrices of compatible dimensions can be added or multiplied just as for ordinary matrices. These operations are exactly the same as the ordinary ones with the restriction that they are defined only when the blocks have compatible dimensions. One can also multiply supermatrices by elements of ''R'' (on the left or right), however, this operation differs from the ungraded case due to the presence of odd elements in ''R''.\n\nLet ''M''<sub>''r''|''s''×''p''|''q''</sub>(''R'') denote the set of all supermatrices over ''R'' with dimension (''r''|''s'')×(''p''|''q''). This set forms a [[supermodule]] over ''R'' under supermatrix addition and scalar multiplication. In particular, if ''R'' is a superalgebra over a field ''K'' then  ''M''<sub>''r''|''s''×''p''|''q''</sub>(''R'') forms a [[super vector space]] over ''K''.\n\nLet ''M''<sub>''p''|''q''</sub>(''R'') denote the set of all square supermatices over ''R'' with dimension (''p''|''q'')×(''p''|''q''). This set forms a [[superring]] under supermatrix addition and multiplication. Furthermore, if ''R'' is a [[commutative superalgebra]], then supermatrix multiplication is a bilinear operation, so that  ''M''<sub>''p''|''q''</sub>(''R'') forms a superalgebra over ''R''.\n\n===Addition===\n\nTwo supermatrices of dimension (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') can be added just as in the [[matrix addition|ungraded case]] to obtain a supermatrix of the same dimension. The addition can be performed blockwise since the blocks have compatible sizes. It is easy to see that the sum of two even supermatrices is even and the sum of two odd supermatrices is odd.\n\n===Multiplication===\n\nOne can multiply a supermatrix with dimensions (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') by a supermatrix with dimensions (''p''|''q'')&times;(''k''|''l'') as in the [[matrix multiplication|ungraded case]] to obtain a matrix of dimension (''r''|''s'')&times;(''k''|''l''). The multiplication can be performed at the block level in the obvious manner:\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}X_{00} & X_{01} \\\\ X_{10} & X_{11}\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}Y_{00} & Y_{01} \\\\ Y_{10} & Y_{11}\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}X_{00}Y_{00} + X_{01}Y_{10} & X_{00}Y_{01} + X_{01}Y_{11} \\\\\nX_{10}Y_{00} + X_{11}Y_{10} & X_{10}Y_{01} + X_{11}Y_{11}\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\nNote that the blocks of the product supermatrix ''Z'' = ''XY'' are given by\n:<math>Z_{ij} = X_{i0}Y_{0j} + X_{i1}Y_{1j}.\\,</math>\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are homogeneous with parities |''X''| and |''Y''| then ''XY'' is homogeneous with parity |''X''| + |''Y''|. That is, the product of two even or two odd supermatrices is even while the product of an even and odd supermatrix is odd.\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n\n[[Scalar multiplication]] for supermatrices is different than the ungraded case due to the presence of odd elements in ''R''. Let ''X'' be a supermatrix. Left scalar multiplication by &alpha; &isin; ''R'' is defined by\n:<math>\\alpha\\cdot X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\alpha\\,X_{00} & \\alpha\\,X_{01}\\\\\n\\hat\\alpha\\,X_{10} & \\hat\\alpha\\,X_{11}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nwhere the internal scalar multiplications are the ordinary ungraded ones and <math>\\hat\\alpha</math> denotes the grade involution in ''R''. This is given on homogeneous elements by\n:<math>\\hat\\alpha = (-1)^{|\\alpha|}\\alpha.</math>\n\nRight scalar multiplication by &alpha; is defined analogously:\n:<math>X\\cdot\\alpha = \\begin{bmatrix}\nX_{00}\\,\\alpha & X_{01}\\,\\hat\\alpha \\\\\nX_{10}\\,\\alpha & X_{11}\\,\\hat\\alpha\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nIf &alpha; is even then <math>\\hat\\alpha = \\alpha</math> and both of these operations are the same as the ungraded versions. If &alpha; and ''X'' are homogeneous then &alpha;&middot;''X'' and ''X''&middot;&alpha; are both homogeneous with parity |&alpha;| + |''X''|. Furthermore, if ''R'' is supercommutative then one has\n:<math>\\alpha\\cdot X = (-1)^{|\\alpha||X|}X\\cdot\\alpha.</math>\n\n==As linear transformations==\n\nOrdinary matrices can be thought of as the coordinate representations of [[linear map]]s between [[vector space]]s (or [[free module]]s). Likewise, supermatrices can be thought of as the coordinate representations of linear maps between [[super vector space]]s (or [[free supermodule]]s). There is an important difference in the graded case, however. A homomorphism from one super vector space to another is, by definition, one that preserves the grading (i.e. maps even elements to even elements and odd elements to odd elements). The coordinate representation of such a transformation is always an ''even'' supermatrix. Odd supermatrices correspond to linear transformations that reverse the grading. General supermatrices represent an arbitrary ungraded linear transformation. Such transformations are still important in the graded case, although less so than the graded (even) transformations.\n\nA [[supermodule]] ''M'' over a [[superalgebra]] ''R'' is ''free'' if it has a free homogeneous basis. If such a basis consists of ''p'' even elements and ''q'' odd elements, then ''M'' is said to have rank ''p''|''q''. If ''R'' is supercommutative, the rank is independent of the choice of basis, just as in the ungraded case.\n\nLet ''R''<sup>''p''|''q''</sup> be the space of column supervectors&mdash;supermatrices of dimension (''p''|''q'')&times;(1|0). This is naturally a right ''R''-supermodule, called the ''right coordinate space''. A supermatrix ''T'' of dimension (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') can then be thought of as a right ''R''-linear map\n:<math>T:R^{p|q}\\to R^{r|s}\\,</math>\nwhere the action of ''T'' on ''R''<sup>''p''|''q''</sup> is just supermatrix multiplication (this action is not generally left ''R''-linear which is why we think of ''R''<sup>''p''|''q''</sup> as a ''right'' supermodule).\n\nLet ''M'' be free right ''R''-supermodule of rank ''p''|''q'' and let ''N'' be a free right ''R''-supermodule of rank ''r''|''s''. Let (''e''<sub>''i''</sub>) be a free basis for ''M'' and let (''f''<sub>''k''</sub>) be a free basis for ''N''. Such a choice of bases is equivalent to a choice of isomorphisms from ''M'' to ''R''<sup>''p''|''q''</sup> and from ''N'' to ''R''<sup>''r''|''s''</sup>. Any (ungraded) linear map\n:<math>T : M\\to N\\,</math>\ncan be written as a (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') supermatrix relative to the chosen bases. The components of the associated supermatrix are determined by the formula\n:<math>T(e_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{r+s}f_k\\,{T^k}_i.</math>\nThe block decomposition of a supermatrix ''T'' corresponds to the decomposition of ''M'' and ''N'' into even and odd submodules:\n:<math>M = M_0\\oplus M_1\\qquad N = N_0\\oplus N_1.</math>\n\n==Operations==\n\nMany operations on ordinary matrices can be generalized to supermatrices, although the generalizations are not always obvious or straightforward.\n\n===Supertranspose===\n\nThe '''supertranspose''' of a supermatrix is the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-graded analog of the [[transpose]]. Let\n:<math>X = \\begin{bmatrix}A & B \\\\ C & D\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nbe a homogeneous (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') supermatrix. The supertranspose of ''X'' is the (''p''|''q'')&times;(''r''|''s'') supermatrix\n:<math>X^{st} = \\begin{bmatrix}A^t & (-1)^{|X|}C^t \\\\ -(-1)^{|X|}B^t & D^t\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nwhere ''A''<sup>''t''</sup> denotes the ordinary transpose of ''A''. This can be extended to arbitrary supermatrices by linearity. Unlike the ordinary transpose, the supertranspose is not generally an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], but rather has order 4. Applying the supertranspose twice to a supermatrix ''X'' gives\n:<math>(X^{st})^{st} = \\begin{bmatrix}A & -B \\\\ -C & D\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nIf ''R'' is supercommutative, the supertranspose satisfies the identity\n:<math>(XY)^{st} = (-1)^{|X||Y|}Y^{st}X^{st}.\\,</math>\n\n===Parity transpose===\n\nThe '''parity transpose''' of a supermatrix is a new operation without an ungraded analog. Let \n:<math>X = \\begin{bmatrix}A & B \\\\ C & D\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nbe a (''r''|''s'')&times;(''p''|''q'') supermatrix. The parity transpose of ''X'' is the (''s''|''r'')&times;(''q''|''p'') supermatrix\n:<math>X^\\pi = \\begin{bmatrix}D & C \\\\ B & A\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nThat is, the (''i'',''j'') block of the transposed matrix is the (1&minus;''i'',1&minus;''j'') block of the original matrix.\n\nThe parity transpose operation obeys the identities\n*<math>(X+Y)^\\pi = X^\\pi + Y^\\pi\\,</math>\n*<math>(XY)^\\pi = X^\\pi Y^\\pi\\,</math>\n*<math>(\\alpha\\cdot X)^\\pi = \\hat\\alpha\\cdot X^\\pi</math>\n*<math>(X\\cdot\\alpha)^\\pi = X^\\pi\\cdot\\hat\\alpha</math>\nas well as\n*<math>\\pi^2 = 1\\,</math>\n*<math>\\pi\\circ st \\circ \\pi = (st)^3</math>\nwhere ''st'' denotes the supertranspose operation.\n\n===Supertrace===\n\nThe [[supertrace]] of a square supermatrix is the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-graded analog of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]. It is defined on homogeneous supermatrices by the formula\n:<math>\\mathrm{str}(X) = \\mathrm{tr}(X_{00}) - (-1)^{|X|}\\mathrm{tr}(X_{11})\\,</math>\nwhere tr denotes the ordinary trace.\n\nIf ''R'' is supercommutative, the supertrace satisfies the identity\n:<math>\\mathrm{str}(XY) = (-1)^{|X||Y|}\\mathrm{str}(YX)\\,</math>\nfor homogeneous supermatrices ''X'' and ''Y''.\n\n===Berezinian===\n\nThe [[Berezinian]] (or [[superdeterminant]]) of a square supermatrix is the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-graded analog of the [[determinant]]. The Berezinian is only well-defined on even, invertible supermatrices over a commutative superalgebra ''R''. In this case it is given by the formula\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ber}(X) = \\det(X_{00} - X_{01}X_{11}^{-1}X_{10})\\det(X_{11})^{-1}.</math>\nwhere det denotes the ordinary determinant (of square matrices with entries in the commutative algebra ''R''<sub>0</sub>).\n\nThe Berezinian satisfies similar properties to the ordinary determinant. In particular, it is multiplicative and invariant under the supertranspose. It is related to the supertrace by the formula\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ber}(e^X) = e^{\\mathrm{str(X)}}.\\,</math>\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite book | first = V.

A '''right supermodule''' over ''A'' is a [[right module]] ''E'' over ''A'' with a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] decomposition (as an [[abelian group]])\n:<math>E = E_0 \\oplus E_1</math>\nsuch that multiplication by elements of ''A'' satisfies\n:<math>E_i A_j \\subseteq E_{i+j}</math>\nfor all ''i'' and ''j'' in '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>. The subgroups ''E''<sub>''i''</sub> are then right ''A''<sub>0</sub>-modules.\n\nThe elements of ''E''<sub>''i''</sub> are said to be '''homogeneous'''. The '''parity''' of a homogeneous element ''x'', denoted by |''x''|, is 0 or 1 according to whether it is in ''E''<sub>0</sub> or ''E''<sub>1</sub>. Elements of parity 0 are said to be '''even''' and those of parity 1 to be '''odd'''. If ''a'' is a homogeneous scalar and ''x'' is a homogeneous element of ''E'' then |''x''·''a''| is homogeneous and |''x''·''a''| = |''x''| + |''a''|.\n\nLikewise, '''left supermodules''' and '''superbimodules''' are defined as [[left module]]s or [[bimodule]]s over ''A'' whose scalar multiplications respect the gradings in the obvious manner. If ''A'' is [[supercommutative]], then every left or right supermodule over ''A'' may be regarded as a superbimodule by setting\n:<math>a\\cdot x = (-1)^{|a||x|}x\\cdot a</math>\nfor homogeneous elements ''a'' ∈ ''A'' and ''x'' ∈ ''E'', and extending by linearity. If ''A'' is purely even this reduces to the ordinary definition.\n\n==Homomorphisms==\n\nA [[homomorphism]] between supermodules is a [[module homomorphism]] that preserves the grading.\nLet ''E'' and ''F'' be right supermodules over ''A''. A map\n:<math>\\phi : E \\to F\\,</math>\nis a supermodule homomorphism if \n*<math>\\phi(x+y) =\\phi(x)+\\phi(y)\\,</math>\n*<math>\\phi(x\\cdot a) = \\phi(x)\\cdot a\\,</math>\n*<math>\\phi(E_i)\\subseteq F_i\\,</math>\nfor all ''a''∈''A'' and all ''x'',''y''∈''E''. The set of all module homomorphisms from ''E'' to ''F'' is denoted by Hom(''E'', ''F'').\n\nIn many cases, it is necessary or convenient to consider a larger class of morphisms between supermodules. Let ''A'' be a supercommutative algebra. Then all supermodules over ''A'' be regarded as superbimodules in a natural fashion. For supermodules ''E'' and ''F'', let '''Hom'''(''E'', ''F'') denote the space of all ''right'' A-linear maps (i.e. all module homomorphisms from ''E'' to ''F'' considered as ungraded right ''A''-modules). There is a natural grading on '''Hom'''(''E'', ''F'') where the even homomorphisms are those that preserve the grading\n:<math>\\phi(E_i)\\subseteq F_i</math>\nand the odd homomorphisms are those that reverse the grading\n:<math>\\phi(E_i)\\subseteq F_{1-i}.</math>\nIf φ ∈ '''Hom'''(''E'', ''F'') and ''a'' ∈ ''A'' are homogeneous then\n:<math>\\phi(x\\cdot a) = \\phi(x)\\cdot a\\qquad \\phi(a\\cdot x) = (-1)^{|a||\\phi|}a\\cdot\\phi(x).</math>\nThat is, the even homomorphisms are both right and left linear whereas the odd homomorphism are right linear but left [[antilinear]] (with respect to the grading automorphism).\n\nThe set '''Hom'''(''E'', ''F'') can be given the structure of a bimodule over ''A'' by setting\n:<math>\\begin{align}(a\\cdot\\phi)(x) &= a\\cdot\\phi(x)\\\\\n(\\phi\\cdot a)(x) &= \\phi(a\\cdot x).\\end{align}</math>\nWith the above grading '''Hom'''(''E'', ''F'') becomes a supermodule over ''A'' whose even part is the set of all ordinary supermodule homomorphisms\n:<math>\\mathbf{Hom}_0(E,F) = \\mathrm{Hom}(E,F).</math>\nIn the language of [[category theory]], the class of all supermodules over ''A'' forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with supermodule homomorphisms as the morphisms. This category is a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal closed category]] under the super tensor product whose [[internal Hom functor]] is given by '''Hom'''.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite conference | authorlink=Pierre Deligne | first = Pierre | last = Deligne |author2=John W.

      "text": "{{Short description|Theorem on homotopy groups\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Bott periodicity theorem''' describes a periodicity in the [[homotopy group]]s of [[classical group]]s, discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Raoul Bott|first=Raoul |last=Bott|year1=1957|year2=1959}}, which proved to be of foundational significance for much further research, in particular in [[K-theory]] of stable complex [[vector bundle]]s, as well as the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]. Bott periodicity can be formulated in numerous ways, with the periodicity in question always appearing as a period-2 phenomenon, with respect to dimension, for the theory associated to the [[unitary group]]. See for example [[topological K-theory]].\n\nThere are corresponding period-8 phenomena for the matching theories, ([[real number|real]]) [[KO-theory]] and ([[quaternion]]ic) [[KSp-theory]], associated to the real [[orthogonal group]] and the quaternionic [[symplectic group]], respectively. The [[J-homomorphism]] is a homomorphism from the homotopy groups of orthogonal groups to  [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]], which causes the period 8 Bott periodicity to be visible in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.\n\n==Statement of result==\n\nBott showed that if <math>O(\\infty)</math> is defined as the [[Direct limit of groups|inductive limit]] of the [[orthogonal groups]], then its [[homotopy groups]] are periodic:<ref>http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node1.html</ref>\n:<math>\\pi_{n}(O(\\infty))\\simeq\\pi_{n+8}(O(\\infty))</math> \nand the first 8 homotopy groups are as follows:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\pi_{0}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq\\Z_2 \\\\\n\\pi_{1}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq\\Z_2 \\\\\n\\pi_{2}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq 0 \\\\\n\\pi_{3}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq\\Z \\\\\n\\pi_{4}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq 0 \\\\\n\\pi_{5}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq 0 \\\\\n\\pi_{6}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq 0 \\\\\n\\pi_{7}(O(\\infty))&\\simeq\\Z\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Context and significance==\nThe context of Bott periodicity is that the [[homotopy group]]s of [[sphere]]s, which would be expected to play the basic part in [[algebraic topology]] by analogy with [[homology theory]], have proved elusive (and the theory is complicated). The subject of [[stable homotopy theory]] was conceived as a simplification, by introducing the [[suspension (mathematics)|suspension]] ([[smash product]] with a [[circle]]) operation, and seeing what (roughly speaking) remained of homotopy theory once one was allowed to suspend both sides of an equation, as many times as one wished. The stable theory was still hard to compute with, in practice.\n\nWhat Bott periodicity offered was an insight into some highly non-trivial spaces, with central status in topology because of the connection of their [[cohomology]] with [[characteristic class]]es, for which all the (''unstable'') homotopy groups could be calculated.  These spaces are the (infinite, or ''stable'') unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups ''U'', ''O'' and&nbsp;Sp.  In this context, ''stable'' refers to taking the union ''U'' (also known as the [[direct limit]]) of the sequence of inclusions\n\n:<math>U(1)\\subset U(2)\\subset\\cdots\\subset U = \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty U(k)</math>\n\nand similarly for ''O'' and&nbsp;Sp.  Bott's (now somewhat awkward) use of the word ''stable'' in the title of his seminal paper refers to these stable [[classical groups]] and not to [[stable homotopy theory|stable homotopy]] groups.\n\nThe important connection of Bott periodicity with the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] <math>\\pi_n^S</math> comes via the so-called stable [[J-homomorphism|''J''-homomorphism]] from the (unstable) homotopy groups of the (stable) classical groups to these stable homotopy groups <math>\\pi_n^S</math>.  Originally described by [[George W. Whitehead]], it became the subject of the famous [[Adams conjecture]] (1963) which was finally resolved in the affirmative by [[Daniel Quillen]] (1971).\n\nBott's original results may be succinctly summarized in:\n\n'''Corollary:''' The (unstable) homotopy groups of the (infinite) [[classical groups]] are periodic:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\pi_k(U) &=\\pi_{k+2}(U) \\\\\n\\pi_k(O) &=\\pi_{k+4}(\\operatorname{Sp}) \\\\\n\\pi_k(\\operatorname{Sp}) &= \\pi_{k+4}(O) && k=0,1,\\ldots \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n'''Note:''' The second and third of these isomorphisms intertwine to give the 8-fold periodicity results:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\pi_k(O) &=\\pi_{k+8}(O) \\\\\n\\pi_k(\\operatorname{Sp}) &=\\pi_{k+8}(\\operatorname{Sp}), && k=0,1,\\ldots \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Loop spaces and classifying spaces==\nFor the theory associated to the infinite [[unitary group]], ''U'', the space ''BU'' is the [[classifying space]] for stable complex [[vector bundle]]s (a [[Grassmannian]] in infinite dimensions).  One formulation of Bott periodicity describes the twofold loop space, Ω<sup>2</sup>''BU'' of ''BU''.  Here, Ω is the [[loop space]] functor, [[right adjoint]] to [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] and [[left adjoint]] to the [[classifying space]] construction. Bott periodicity states that this double loop space is essentially ''BU'' again; more precisely,\n\n:<math>\\Omega^2BU\\simeq \\Z\\times BU</math>\n\nis essentially (that is, [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to) the union of a countable number of copies of ''BU''.  An equivalent formulation is\n\n:<math>\\Omega^2U\\simeq U .</math>\n\nEither of these has the immediate effect of showing why (complex) topological ''K''-theory is a 2-fold periodic theory.\n\nIn the corresponding theory for the infinite [[orthogonal group]], ''O'', the space ''BO'' is the [[classifying space]] for stable real [[vector bundle]]s. In this case, Bott periodicity states that, for the 8-fold loop space,\n\n:<math>\\Omega^8BO\\simeq \\Z \\times BO ;</math>\n\nor equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\Omega^8O\\simeq O ,</math>\n\nwhich yields the consequence that ''KO''-theory is an 8-fold periodic theory. Also, for the infinite [[symplectic group]], Sp, the space BSp is the [[classifying space]] for stable quaternionic [[vector bundle]]s, and Bott periodicity states that\n\n:<math>\\Omega^8\\operatorname{BSp}\\simeq \\Z \\times \\operatorname{BSp} ;</math>\n\nor equivalently\n\n:<math>\\Omega^8 \\operatorname{Sp}\\simeq \\operatorname{Sp} .</math>\n\nThus both topological real ''K''-theory (also known as ''KO''-theory) and topological quaternionic ''K''-theory (also known as KSp-theory) are 8-fold periodic theories.\n\n==Geometric model of loop spaces==\nOne elegant formulation of Bott periodicity makes use of the observation that there are natural embeddings (as closed subgroups) between the classical groups. The loop spaces in Bott periodicity are then homotopy equivalent to the [[symmetric space]]s of successive quotients, with additional discrete factors of '''Z'''.\n\nOver the complex numbers:\n\n:<math> U \\times U \\subset U \\subset U \\times U. </math>\n\nOver the real numbers and quaternions:\n\n:<math>O \\times O \\subset O \\subset U\\subset \\operatorname{Sp} \\subset \\operatorname{Sp} \\times \\operatorname{Sp} \\subset \\operatorname{Sp} \\subset U \\subset O \\subset O \\times O.</math>\n\nThese sequences corresponds to sequences in [[Clifford algebra]]s – see [[classification of Clifford algebras]]; over the complex numbers:\n\n:<math>\\Complex \\oplus \\Complex \\subset \\Complex \\subset \\Complex \\oplus \\Complex. </math>\n\nOver the real numbers and quaternions:\n\n:<math>\\R \\oplus \\R \\subset \\R\\subset \\Complex\\subset \\mathbb{H} \\subset \\mathbb{H} \\oplus \\mathbb{H} \\subset \\mathbb{H} \\subset \\Complex \\subset \\R \\subset \\R \\oplus \\R,</math>\n\nwhere the division algebras indicate \"matrices over that algebra\".\n\nAs they are 2-periodic/8-periodic, they can be arranged in a circle, where they are called the '''Bott periodicity clock''' and '''Clifford algebra clock'''.\n\nThe Bott periodicity results then refine to a sequence of [[homotopy equivalence]]s:\n\nFor complex ''K''-theory:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Omega U           &\\simeq \\Z\\times BU = \\Z\\times U/(U \\times U)\\\\\n\\Omega(Z\\times BU) &\\simeq U = (U \\times U)/U\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor real and quaternionic ''KO''- and KSp-theories:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Omega(\\Z\\times BO) &\\simeq O = (O \\times O)/O & \\Omega(\\Z\\times \\operatorname{BSp}) &\\simeq \\operatorname{Sp} = (\\operatorname{Sp} \\times \\operatorname{Sp})/\\operatorname{Sp}\\\\\n\\Omega O                   &\\simeq O/U                 & \\Omega \\operatorname{Sp}           &\\simeq \\operatorname{Sp}/U\\\\\n\\Omega(O/U)                &\\simeq U/\\operatorname{Sp} & \\Omega(\\operatorname{Sp}/U)        &\\simeq U/O\\\\\n\\Omega(U/\\operatorname{Sp})&\\simeq \\Z\\times \\operatorname{BSp} = \\Z\\times \\operatorname{Sp}/(\\operatorname{Sp} \\times \\operatorname{Sp}) & \\Omega(U/O) &\\simeq \\Z\\times BO  = \\Z \\times O/(O \\times O)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe resulting spaces are homotopy equivalent to the classical reductive [[symmetric space]]s, and are the successive quotients of the terms of the Bott periodicity clock. These equivalences immediately yield the Bott periodicity theorems.\n\nThe specific spaces are,<ref group=\"note\">The interpretation and labeling is slightly incorrect, and refers to ''irreducible'' symmetric spaces, while these are the more general ''reductive'' spaces. For example, ''SU''/Sp is irreducible, while ''U''/Sp is reductive.

The stable homotopy groups π<sub>''r''</sub><sup>''S''</sup> are the direct sum of the (cyclic) image of the ''J''-homomorphism, and the kernel of the Adams e-invariant {{harv|Adams|1966}}, a homomorphism from the stable homotopy groups to '''Q'''/'''Z'''. The order of the image is 2 if ''r'' is 0 or 1 mod 8 and positive (so in this case the ''J''-homomorphism is injective). If ''r'' = 4''n''−1 is 3 mod 4 and positive the image is a cyclic group of order equal to the denominator of ''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>/4''n'', where ''B''<sub>2''n''</sub> is a [[Bernoulli number]]. In the remaining cases where ''r'' is 2, 4, 5, or 6 mod 8 the image is trivial because π<sub>''r''</sub>(SO) is trivial.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background-color:white\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right;width:10%\" | r\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 0\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 1\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 2\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 3\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 4\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 5\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 6\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 7\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 8\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 9\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 10\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 11\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 12\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 13\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 14\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 15\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 16\n! style=\"width:5%\" | 17\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | π<sub>''r''</sub>(SO)\n| 1 || 2 || 1 || '''Z''' || 1 || 1 || 1 || '''Z''' || 2 || 2 || 1 || '''Z''' || 1 || 1 || 1 || '''Z''' || 2 || 2\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | |im(''J'')|\n| 1 || 2 || 1 || 24 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 240 || 2 || 2 || 1 || 504 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 480 || 2 || 2\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | π<sub>''r''</sub><sup>''S''</sup>\n| '''Z''' || 2 || 2 || 24 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 240 || 2<sup>2</sup> || 2<sup>3</sup> || 6 || 504 || 1 || 3 || 2<sup>2</sup> || 480×2 || 2<sup>2</sup> || 2<sup>4</sup>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | ''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>\n|  ||  ||  || <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> ||  ||  ||  || −<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub> ||  ||  ||  || <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>42</sub> ||  ||  ||  || −<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub> ||  || \n|}\n\n==Applications==\n\n{{harvtxt|Atiyah|1961}} introduced the group ''J''(''X'') of a space ''X'', which for ''X'' a sphere is the image of the ''J''-homomorphism in a suitable dimension.\n\nThe [[cokernel]] of the ''J''-homomorphism appears in the group of [[exotic sphere]]s ({{harvtxt|Kosinski |1992}}).\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Atiyah | first1=Michael Francis | author1-link=Michael Atiyah | title=Thom complexes | doi=10.1112/plms/s3-11.1.291  | mr=0131880 | year=1961 | journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society |series=Third Series | issn=0024-6115 | volume=11 | pages=291–310}}\n*{{citation|first=J.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Kuiper's theorem''' (after [[Nicolaas Kuiper]]) is a result on the topology of operators on an infinite-dimensional, complex [[Hilbert space]]&nbsp;''H''. It states that the [[topological space|space]] GL(''H'') of [[invertible]] [[bounded operator|bounded]] [[linear operator|endomorphisms]] of ''H'' is such that all maps from any [[CW complex|finite complex]] ''Y'' to GL(''H'') are [[homotopic]] to a constant, for the [[norm topology]] on operators.\n\nA significant corollary, also referred to as ''Kuiper's theorem'', is that this group is [[weakly contractible]], ''ie.'' all its [[homotopy group]]s are trivial. This result has important uses in [[topological K-theory]].\n\n==General topology of the general linear group==\n\nFor finite dimensional ''H'', this group would be a complex [[general linear group]] and not at all contractible. In fact it is homotopy equivalent to its [[maximal compact subgroup]], the [[unitary group]] ''U'' of ''H''. The proof that the complex general linear group and unitary group have the same [[homotopy type]] is by the [[Gram-Schmidt process]], or through the [[matrix polar decomposition]], and carries over to the infinite-dimensional case of [[separable Hilbert space]], basically because the space of [[upper triangular matrices]] is contractible as can be seen quite explicitly. The underlying phenomenon is that passing to infinitely many dimensions causes much of the topological complexity of the unitary groups to vanish; but see the section on Bott's unitary group, where the passage to infinity is more constrained, and the resulting group has non-trivial homotopy groups.\n\n==Historical context and topology of spheres==\nIt is a surprising fact that the [[unit sphere]], sometimes denoted ''S''<sup>∞</sup>, in infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' is a [[contractible space]], while no finite-dimensional spheres are contractible. This result, certainly known decades before Kuiper's, may have the status of [[mathematical folklore]], but it is quite often cited.<ref>[[John Baez]], \"This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 151\", [http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week151.html]</ref><ref>Dave Rusin, newsgroup posting http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/93_back/s-infty</ref> In fact more is true: ''S''<sup>∞</sup> is [[diffeomorphic]] to ''H'', which is certainly contractible by its convexity.<ref>С. Bessaga, ''Every infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is diffeomorphic with its unit sphere''. Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. Sér. Sci. Math. 14 (1966), 2731.</ref> One consequence is that there are smooth counterexamples to an extension of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] to the unit ball in ''H''.<ref>Andrzej Granas, [[James Dugundji]], ''Fixed point theory'' (2003), pp. 82-3.</ref> The existence of such counter-examples that are [[homeomorphism]]s was shown in 1943 by [[Shizuo Kakutani]], who may have first written down a proof of the contractibility of the unit sphere.<ref>S. Kakutani, ''Topological properties of the unit sphere in Hilbert space'', Proc. Imp. Acad. Tokyo 19 (1943), 269–271.</ref> But the result was anyway essentially known (in 1935 [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff]] showed that the unit sphere was a retract of the unit ball).<ref>Andrzej Granas, James Dugundji, p. 108.</ref>\n\nThe result on the group of bounded operators was proved by the Dutch mathematician [[Nicolaas Kuiper]], for the case of a separable Hilbert space; the restriction of separability was later lifted.<ref>[[Luc Illusie]], ''Contractibilité du groupe linéaire des espaces de Hilbert de dimension infinie'', [[Séminaire Bourbaki]] 1964, Exp. No. 284.</ref> The same result, but for the [[strong operator topology]] rather than the norm topology, was published in 1963 by [[Jacques Dixmier]] and [[Adrien Douady]].<ref>Lemme 3 on p. 26, [http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/BSMF/BSMF_1963__91_/BSMF_1963__91__227_0/BSMF_1963__91__227_0.pdf ''Champs continus d’espaces hilbertiens'' (PDF)], Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France, 91 (1963), p. 227-284.</ref> The geometric relationship of the sphere and group of operators is that the unit sphere is a [[homogeneous space]] for the unitary group ''U''. The stabiliser of a single vector ''v'' of the unit sphere is the unitary group of the orthogonal complement of ''v''; therefore the [[homotopy long exact sequence]] predicts that all the homotopy groups of the unit sphere will be trivial. This shows the close topological relationship, but is not in itself quite enough, since the inclusion of a point will be a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] only, and that implies contractibility directly only for a [[CW complex]]. In a paper published two years after Kuiper's,<ref>Richard Palais, ''Homotopy Theory of Infinite Dimensional Manifolds'', Topology, vol. 5, pp.1-16 (1966).</ref> Richard Palais provided technical results on infinite-dimensional manifolds sufficient to resolve this issue.<ref>E.g. http://math.leetspeak.org/GN/homotopy_groups_of_operator_groups.pdf</ref>\n\n==Bott's unitary group==\n\nThere is another infinite-dimensional unitary group, of major significance in [[homotopy theory]], that to which the [[Bott periodicity theorem]] applies. It is certainly not contractible. The difference from Kuiper's group can be explained: Bott's group is the subgroup in which a given operator acts non-trivially only on a subspace spanned by the first ''N'' of a fixed orthonormal basis {''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}, for some ''N'', being the identity on the remaining basis vectors.\n\n==Applications==\nAn immediate consequence, given the general theory of [[fibre bundle]]s, is that every [[Hilbert bundle]] is a [[trivial bundle]].<ref>Booss and Bleecker, ''Topology and Analysis'' (1985), p. 67.</ref>\n\nThe result on the contractibility of ''S''<sup>∞</sup> gives a geometric construction of [[classifying space]]s for certain groups that act freely it, such as the cyclic group with two elements and the [[circle group]]. The unitary group ''U'' in Bott's sense has a classifying space ''BU'' for complex [[vector bundle]]s (see [[Classifying space for U(n)]]). A deeper application coming from Kuiper's theorem is the proof of the '''Atiyah–Jänich theorem''' (after [[Klaus Jänich]] and [[Michael Atiyah]]), stating that the space of [[Fredholm operator]]s on ''H'', with the norm topology, represents the functor ''K''(.) of topological (complex) K-theory, in the sense of homotopy theory. This is given by Atiyah.<ref>[[Michael Atiyah]], ''K-theory'' p. 153 and p. 162-3, ''Collected Works'' volume 2, pp. 590-600.</ref>\n\n==Case of Banach spaces==\nThe same question may be posed about invertible operators on any [[Banach space]] of infinite dimension. Here there are only partial results. Some classical sequence spaces have the same property, namely that the group of invertible operators is contractible. On the other hand, there are examples known where it fails to be a [[connected space]].<ref>Herbert Schröder, [https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/9810/9810069v1.pdf ''On the topology of the group of invertible elements'' (PDF), preprint survey].</ref> Where all homotopy groups are known to be trivial, the contractibility in some cases may remain unknown.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal| last=Kuiper | first=N. | title=The homotopy type of the unitary group of Hilbert space | journal=[[Topology (journal)|Topology]] | volume=3 | year=1965| issue=1 | pages=19&ndash;30 | doi=10.1016/0040-9383(65)90067-4}}\n\n[[Category:K-theory]]\n[[Category:Operator theory]]\n[[Category:Hilbert space]]\n[[Category:Theorems in topology]]\n[[Category:Topology of Lie groups]]"

Its first [[homology group]] is therefore also infinite cyclic, as is its first cohomology group. Arnold showed that this leads to a description of the '''Maslov index''', introduced by [[V. P.

      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Schubert calculus''' is a branch of [[algebraic geometry]] introduced in the nineteenth century by [[Hermann Schubert]], in order to solve various counting problems of [[projective geometry]] (part of [[enumerative geometry]]). It was a precursor of several more modern theories, for example [[characteristic class]]es, and in particular its algorithmic aspects are still of current interest. The phrase \"Schubert calculus\" is sometimes used to mean the enumerative geometry of linear subspaces, roughly equivalent to describing the cohomology ring of Grassmannians, and sometimes used to mean the more general enumerative geometry of nonlinear varieties. Even more generally, “Schubert calculus” is often understood to encompass the study of analogous questions in [[generalized cohomology theories]].\n\nThe objects introduced by Schubert are the '''Schubert cells''', which are [[locally closed]] sets in a [[Grassmannian]] defined by conditions of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of a linear subspace in projective space with a given [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]]. For details see [[Schubert variety]].\n\nThe [[intersection theory]] of these cells, which can be seen as the product structure in the [[cohomology ring]] of the Grassmannian of associated [[cohomology class]]es, in principle allows the prediction of the cases where intersections of cells results in a finite set of points, which are potentially concrete answers to enumerative questions. A supporting theoretical result is that the Schubert cells (or rather, their classes) span the whole cohomology ring.\n\nIn detailed calculations the combinatorial aspects enter as soon as the cells have to be indexed. Lifted from the [[Grassmannian]], which is a [[homogeneous space]], to the [[general linear group]] that acts on it, similar questions are involved in the [[Bruhat decomposition]] and classification of [[parabolic subgroup]]s (by [[block matrix]]).\n\nPutting Schubert's system on a rigorous footing is [[Hilbert's fifteenth problem]].\n\n==References==\n\n*[[Phillip Griffiths]] and [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joseph Harris]] (1978), ''Principles of Algebraic Geometry'', Chapter 1.5\n* {{cite book | editor=Felix E.

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{About|the extension of 'invertibility' in [[abstract algebra]]|cancellation of terms in an [[equation]] or in [[elementary algebra]]|cancelling out}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the notion of '''cancellative''' is a generalization of the notion of [[invertible]].\n\nAn element ''a'' in a [[magma (algebra)|magma]] {{nowrap|(''M'', ∗)}} has the '''left cancellation property''' (or is '''left-cancellative''') if for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''M'', {{nowrap|1=''a'' ∗ ''b'' = ''a'' ∗ ''c''}} always implies that {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}}. \n\nAn element ''a'' in a magma {{nowrap|(''M'', ∗)}} has the '''right cancellation property''' (or is '''right-cancellative''') if for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''M'', {{nowrap|1=''b'' ∗ ''a'' = ''c'' ∗ ''a''}} always implies that {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}}.\n\nAn element ''a'' in a magma {{nowrap|1=(''M'', ∗)}} has the '''two-sided cancellation property''' (or is '''cancellative''') if it is both left- and right-cancellative. \n\nA magma {{nowrap|(''M'', ∗)}} has the left cancellation property (or is left-cancellative) if  all ''a'' in the magma are left cancellative, and similar definitions apply for the right cancellative or two-sided cancellative properties.\n\nA left-invertible element is left-cancellative, and analogously for right and two-sided.\n\nFor example, every [[quasigroup]], and thus every [[group (mathematics)|group]], is cancellative.\n\n==Interpretation==\nTo say that an element ''a'' in a magma {{nowrap|(''M'', ∗)}} is left-cancellative, is to say that the function {{nowrap|''g'' : ''x'' ↦ ''a'' ∗ ''x''}} is [[injective]], so a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] [[monomorphism]] but as it is a set [[endomorphism]] it is a set [[Section (category theory)|section]], i.e. there is a set [[epimorphism]] ''f'' such {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''f''(''a'' ∗ ''x'') = ''x''}} for all ''x'', so ''f'' is a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]]. Moreover, we can be \"constructive\" with ''f'' taking the [[inverse function|inverse]] in the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''g'' and sending the rest precisely to ''a''.\n\n==Examples of cancellative monoids and semigroups==\nThe positive (equally non-negative) integers form a cancellative [[semigroup]] under addition. The non-negative integers form a cancellative [[monoid]] under addition.\n\nIn fact, any free semigroup or monoid obeys the cancellative law, and in general, any semigroup or monoid embedding into a group (as the above examples clearly do) will obey the cancellative law.\n\nIn a different vein, (a subsemigroup of) the multiplicative semigroup of elements of a [[Ring_(mathematics)|ring]] that are not zero divisors (which is just the set of all nonzero elements if the ring in question is a [[Domain_(ring_theory)|domain]], like the integers) has the cancellation property. Note that this remains valid even if the ring in question is noncommutative and/or nonunital.\n\n==Non-cancellative algebraic structures==\nAlthough the cancellation law holds for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s (with the single exception of multiplication by [[0 (number)|zero]] and division of zero by another number), there are a number of algebraic structures where the cancellation law is not valid.\n\n<!-- The [[vector (spatial)|vector]] [[dot product]] is perhaps the simplest example. In this case, for an arbitrary nonzero vector '''a''', the product {{nowrap|1='''a''' ⋅ '''b'''}} can equal another dot product {{nowrap|1='''a''' ⋅ '''c'''}} even if {{nowrap|'''b''' ≠ '''c'''}}. This occurs because the dot product relates to the angle between two vectors as well as their magnitude, and a change in one can, in effect, counterbalance the other to produce equal products for unequal vectors.\n\nFor the same reason, the-->The [[cross product]] of two vectors <!--also--> does not obey the cancellation law. If {{nowrap|1='''a''' × '''b''' = '''a''' × '''c'''}}, then it does not follow that {{nowrap|1='''b''' = '''c'''}} even if {{nowrap|'''a''' ≠ '''0'''}}.\n\n<!-- However, if ''both'' '''a'''·'''b'''='''a'''·'''c''' ''and'' '''a'''×'''b'''='''a'''×'''c''', then one ''can'' conclude that '''b'''='''c'''. This is because for dot and cross products to be simultaneously equal, then both '''a'''·('''b'''-'''c''') ''and'' '''a'''x('''b'''-'''c''') must be zero by the [[distributive law]]. This means that both the sine and cosine of the angle between '''a''' and ('''b'''-'''c''') must be zero, which is not possible because sin<sup>2</sup>x+cos<sup>2</sup>x is ''identically'' 1.-->\n[[Matrix multiplication]] also does not necessarily obey the cancellation law. If {{nowrap|1='''AB''' = '''AC'''}} and {{nowrap|'''A''' ≠ 0}}, then one must show that matrix '''A''' is ''invertible'' (i.e. has {{nowrap|[[determinant|det]]('''A''') ≠ 0}}) before one can conclude that {{nowrap|1='''B''' = '''C'''}}. If {{nowrap|1=det('''A''') = 0}}, then '''B''' might not equal '''C''', because the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation {{nowrap|1='''AX''' = '''B'''}} will not have a unique solution for a non-invertible matrix '''A'''.\n\nAlso note that if {{nowrap|1='''AB''' = '''CA'''}} and {{nowrap|'''A''' ≠ 0}} and the matrix '''A''' is ''invertible'' (i.e. has {{nowrap|[[determinant|det]]('''A''') ≠ 0}}), it is not necessarily true that {{nowrap|1='''B''' = '''C'''}}. Cancellation works only for {{nowrap|1='''AB''' = '''AC'''}} and {{nowrap|1='''BA''' = '''CA'''}} (obviously provided that matrix '''A''' is ''invertible'') and not for {{nowrap|1='''AB''' = '''CA'''}} and {{nowrap|1='''BA''' = '''AC'''}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grothendieck group]]\n* [[Invertible element]]\n* [[Cancellative semigroup]]\n* [[Integral domain]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cancellation Property}}\n[[Category:Non-associative algebra]]\n\n[[fr:Loi de composition interne#Réguliers et dérivés]]"

The resulting magma will be associative if the relation is transitive and hence is a (strict) [[total order]];\notherwise, if finite, it contains [[directed cycle]]s (like rock-paper-scissors-rock) and the magma is non-associative. To see the latter, consider combining all the elements in a cycle in reverse order, i.e. so that each element combined beats the previous one;\nthe result is the last element combined, while associativity and commutativity would mean that the result only depended on the set of elements in the cycle.\n\nThe bottom row in the [[Karnaugh diagram]] above gives more example operations, defined on the [[integer]]s (or any [[commutative ring]]).\n\n== Derived commutative non-associative algebras ==\n\nUsing the rock-paper-scissors example, one can construct a commutative non-associative [[algebra over a field]] <math>K</math>: take <math>A</math> to be the three-dimensional [[vector space]] over <math>K</math> whose elements are written in the form\n\n:<math>(x, y, z) = x r + y p + z s,</math>\n\nfor <math>x, y, z \\in K</math>.

The boost matrix B('''v''') means the boost B that uses the components of '''v''', i.e. ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ''v''<sub>3</sub> in the entries of the matrix, or rather the components of '''v'''/''c'' in the representation that is used in the section [[Lorentz transformation#Matrix forms]].  The matrix entries depend on the components of the 3-velocity '''v''', and that's what the notation B('''v''') means. It could be argued that the entries depend on the components of the 4-velocity because 3 of the entries of the 4-velocity are the same as the entries of the 3-velocity, but the usefulness of parameterizing the boost by 3-velocity is that the resultant boost you get from the composition of two boosts uses the components of the 3-velocity composition '''u'''<math>\\oplus</math>'''v''' in the 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 matrix B('''u'''<math>\\oplus</math>'''v'''). But the resultant boost also needs to be multiplied by a rotation matrix because boost composition (i.e. the multiplication of two 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 matrices) results not in a pure boost but a boost and a rotation, i.e. a 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 matrix that corresponds to the rotation Gyr['''u''','''v'''] to get B('''u''')B('''v''') = B('''u'''<math>\\oplus</math>'''v''')Gyr['''u''','''v'''] = Gyr['''u''','''v''']B('''v'''<math>\\oplus</math>'''u''').\n\n====Einstein gyrovector spaces====\n\nLet s be any positive constant, let (V,+,.) be any real [[inner product space]] and let V<sub>s</sub>={'''v''' &nbsp;∈&nbsp; V :|'''v'''|<s}.

Indeed, put <math>\\alpha_0=\\gamma^{-1} \\alpha</math>, <math>\\beta_0=\\gamma^{-1} \\beta</math> and define the operation ∗ by <math>x*y=\\alpha(x)\\cdot \\beta(y)</math>.\n\nLet <math>(L,\\cdot)</math> and <math>(L,\\circ)</math> be loops and let ''e'' be the [[neutral element]] of <math>(L,\\cdot)</math>. Let <math>(\\alpha,\\beta,id)</math> a principal isotopy from <math>(L,\\cdot)</math> to <math>(L,\\circ)</math>. Then <math>\\alpha=R_b^{-1}</math> and <math>\\beta=L_a^{-1}</math> where <math>a=\\alpha(e)</math> and <math>b=\\beta(e)</math>. \n\nA loop ''L'' is a '''G-loop''' if it is isomorphic to all its loop isotopes.\n\n== Pseudo-automorphisms of loops ==\n\nLet ''L'' be a loop and ''c'' an element of ''L''. A bijection ''α'' of ''L'' is called a '''right pseudo-automorphism''' of ''L'' with '''companion element''' ''c'' if for all ''x'', ''y'' the identity\n:<math>\\alpha(xy)c=\\alpha(x)(\\alpha(y)c)</math>\nholds. One defines left pseudo-automorphisms analogously.\n\n== Universal properties ==\n\nWe say that a loop property ''P'' is '''universal''' if it is isotopy invariant, that is, ''P'' holds for a loop ''L'' if and only if ''P'' holds for all loop isotopes of ''L''. Clearly, it is enough to check if ''P'' holds for all principal isotopes of ''L''. \n\nFor example, since the isotopes of a commutative loop need not be commutative, [[commutativity]] is '''not''' universal. However, [[associativity]] and being an [[abelian group]] are universal properties. In fact, every group is a G-loop.\n\n== The geometric interpretation of isotopy ==\n\nGiven a loop ''L'', one can define an [[incidence geometry|incidence geometric]] structure called a '''3-net'''. Conversely, after fixing an origin and an order of the line classes, a 3-net gives rise to a loop. Choosing a different origin or exchanging the line classes may result in nonisomorphic coordinate loops. However, the coordinate loops are always isotopic. In other words, two loops are isotopic if and only if they are equivalent from ''geometric point of view''. \n\nThe dictionary between algebraic and geometric concepts is as follows\n\n* The group of autotopism of the loop corresponds to the group direction preserving collineations of the 3-net.\n* Pseudo-automorphisms correspond to collineations fixing the two axis of the coordinate system.\n* The set of companion elements is the orbit of the stabilizer of the axis in the collineation group.\n* The loop is G-loop if and only if the collineation group acts transitively on the set of point of the 3-net.\n* The property ''P'' is universal if and only if it is independent on the choice of the origin.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[isotopy of an algebra]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|mr=0009962 \n|last=Albert|first= A.

Fisher's student, [[A. W. F. Edwards|A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;F. Edwards]], designed this window for [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]], Cambridge.]]\nIn [[combinatorics]] and in [[design of experiments|experimental design]]<!-- alternatively, in [[mathematics]] and in [[statistics]] -->, a '''Latin square''' is an&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' array filled with&nbsp;''n'' different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.  An example of a 3x3 Latin square is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:6em;height:6em;table-layout:fixed;\"\n|-\n| A|| B || C\n|-\n| C || A || B\n|-\n| B || C || A\n|}\n\nThe name \"Latin square\" was inspired by mathematical papers by [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783), who used [[Latin characters]] as symbols,<ref>{{citation|title=Introduction to Combinatorics|first1=W. D.|last1=Wallis|first2=J. C.|last2=George|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-0623-4|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTbb7x-mI5gC&pg=PA212}}</ref> but any set of symbols can be used: in the above example, the alphabetic sequence A,&nbsp;B,&nbsp;C can be replaced by the integer sequence 1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3. Euler began the general theory of Latin squares.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Korean mathematician [[Choi Seok-jeong]] was the first to publish an example of Latin squares of order nine, in order to construct a [[magic square]] in 1700, predating Leonhard Euler by 67 years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Colbourn|first1=Charles J.|last2=Dinitz|first2=Jeffrey H.|title=Handbook of Combinatorial Designs|edition=2nd |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420010541|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9jLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Reduced form ==\n\nA Latin square is said to be ''reduced'' (also, ''normalized'' or ''in standard form'') if both its first row and its first column are in their natural order.  For example, the Latin square above is not reduced because its first column is A,&nbsp;C,&nbsp;B rather than  A,&nbsp;B,&nbsp;C.\n\nAny Latin square can be reduced by [[Permute|permuting]] (that is, reordering) the rows and columns. Here switching the above matrix's second and third rows yields the following square:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:6em;height:6em;table-layout:fixed;\"\n|-\n| A|| B || C\n|-\n| B || C || A\n|-\n| C || A || B\n|}\n\nThis Latin square is reduced; both its first row and its first column are alphabetically ordered A,&nbsp;B,&nbsp;C.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Orthogonal array representation===\n\nIf each entry of an ''n'' &times; ''n'' Latin square is written as a triple (''r'',''c'',''s''), where ''r'' is the row, ''c'' is the column, and ''s'' is the symbol, we obtain a set of ''n''<sup>2</sup> triples called the [[orthogonal array]] representation of the square.  For example, the orthogonal array representation of the following Latin square is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:6em;height:6em;table-layout:fixed;\"\n|-\n| 1|| 2 || 3\n|-\n| 2 || 3 || 1\n|-\n| 3 || 1 || 2\n|}\n\n: { (1,1,1),(1,2,2),(1,3,3),(2,1,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,1),(3,1,3),(3,2,1),(3,3,2) },\nwhere for example the triple (2,3,1) means that in row 2 and column 3 there is the symbol 1.  The definition of a Latin square can be written in terms of orthogonal arrays: \n* A Latin square is a set of ''n''<sup>2</sup> triples (''r'',''c'',''s''), where 1 ≤ ''r'', ''c'', ''s'' ≤ ''n'', such that all ordered pairs (''r'',''c'') are distinct, all ordered pairs (''r'',''s'') are distinct, and all ordered pairs (''c'',''s'') are distinct.\n\nThis means that the ''n''<sup>2</sup> ordered pairs  (''r'',''c'') are all the pairs (''i'',''j'') with   1 ≤ ''i'', ''j'' ≤ ''n'' , once each. The same is true the ordered pairs (''r'',''s'') and the ordered pairs (''c'',''s'').\n\nThe orthogonal array representation shows that rows, columns and symbols play rather similar roles, as will be made clear below.\n\n===Equivalence classes of Latin squares===\n\nMany operations on a Latin square produce another Latin square (for example, turning it upside down).\n\nIf we permute the rows, permute the columns, and permute the names of the symbols of a Latin square, we obtain a new Latin square said to be ''[[Quasigroup#Homotopy and isotopy|isotopic]]'' to the first.  Isotopism is an [[equivalence relation]], so the set of all Latin squares is divided into subsets, called ''isotopy classes'', such that two squares in the same class are isotopic and two squares in different classes are not isotopic.\n\nAnother type of operation is easiest to explain using the orthogonal array representation of the Latin square.  If we systematically and consistently reorder the three items in each triple, another orthogonal array (and, thus, another Latin square) is obtained.  For example, we can replace each triple (''r'',''c'',''s'') by (''c'',''r'',''s'') which corresponds to transposing the square (reflecting about its main diagonal), or we could replace each triple (''r'',''c'',''s'') by (''c'',''s'',''r''), which is a more complicated operation.  Altogether there are 6 possibilities including \"do nothing\", giving us 6 Latin squares called the conjugates (also [[parastrophe]]s) of the original square.\n\nFinally, we can combine these two equivalence operations: two Latin squares are said to be [[paratopy|paratopic]], also [[main class isotopic]], if one of them is isotopic to a conjugate of the other.  This is again an equivalence relation, with the equivalence classes called [[main class]]es, ''species'', or [[paratopy|paratopy classes]].   Each main class contains up to 6 isotopy classes.\n\n===Number===\n\nThere is no known easily computable formula for the number {{math|''L<sub>n</sub>''}} of {{math|''n'' &times; ''n''}} Latin squares with symbols {{math|1,2,...,''n''}}. The most accurate upper and lower bounds known for large {{mvar|n}} are far apart.  One classic result<ref>{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pp. 161-162}}</ref> is that\n:<math> \\prod_{k=1}^n \\left(k!\\right)^{n/k}\\geq L_n\\geq\\frac{\\left(n!\\right)^{2n}}{n^{n^2}}.</math>\n\nA simple and explicit formula for the number of Latin squares was published in 1992, but it is still not easily computable due to the exponential increase in the number of terms. This formula for the number {{math|''L<sub>n</sub>''}} of {{math|''n'' &times; ''n''}} Latin squares is\n\n<math> L_n = n! \\sum_{A \\in B_n}^{} (-1)^{\\sigma_0 (A)} \\binom{\\operatorname{per} A}{n},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is the set of all {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} {0, 1} matrices, {{math|σ<sub>0</sub>(''A'')}} is the number of zero entries in matrix {{mvar|A}}, and {{math|per(''A'')}} is the [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of matrix {{mvar|A}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A formula for the number of Latin squares|journal = [[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]]|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/0012365X9290722R/1-s2.0-0012365X9290722R-main.pdf?_tid=27cfba60-574b-11e5-8983-00000aacb362&acdnat=1441841780_a90f541979c332007154c0577042d668|author1 = Jia-yu Shao|author2 = Wan-di Wei |volume = 110| year = 1992 | pages = 293–296|accessdate = 2018-04-10 |doi=10.1016/0012-365x(92)90722-r}}</ref>\n\nThe table below contains all known exact values.  It can be seen that the numbers grow exceedingly quickly.  For each {{mvar|n}}, the number of Latin squares altogether {{OEIS|id=A002860}} is {{math|''n''!

The letter A would then be picked up as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\n12 & 12 & 123 & 124\\\\\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\nIn other words, in the first slot we receive signals from both frequency 1 and frequency 2; while the third slot has signals from frequencies 1, 2 and 3.  Because of the noise, we can no longer tell if the first two slots were 1,1 or  1,2 or  2,1  or  2,2.  But the 1,2 case is the only one that yields a sequence matching a letter in the above table, the letter A. \nSimilarly, we may imagine a burst of static over all frequencies in the third slot:\n\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 2 & 1234 & 4\\\\\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\nAgain, we are able to infer from the table of encodings that it must have been the letter A being transmitted. The number of errors this code can spot is one less than the number of time slots. It has also been proven that if the number of frequencies is a prime or a power of a prime, the orthogonal Latin squares produce error detecting codes that are as efficient as possible.\n\n===Mathematical puzzles===\n\nThe problem of determining if a partially filled square can be completed to form a Latin square is [[NP-complete]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = C.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Moufang loop''' is  a special kind of [[algebraic structure]]. It is similar to a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in many ways but need not be [[associative]]. Moufang loops were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Ruth Moufang|first=Ruth |last=Moufang|year=1935}}.  Smooth Moufang loops have an associated algebra, the [[Malcev algebra]], similar in some ways to how a [[Lie group]] has an associated [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nA '''Moufang loop''' is a [[loop (mathematics)|loop]] ''Q'' that satisfies the four following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''Q'' (the binary operation in ''Q'' is denoted by juxtaposition):\n#''z''(''x''(''zy'')) = ((''zx'')''z'')''y'';\n#''x''(''z''(''yz'')) = ((''xz'')''y'')''z''\n#(''zx'')(''yz'') = (''z''(''xy''))''z''\n#(''zx'')(''yz'') = ''z''((''xy'')''z'').\n\nThese identities are known as '''Moufang identities'''.\n\n==Examples==\n* Any [[group (mathematics)|group]] is an associative loop and therefore a Moufang loop.\n* The nonzero [[octonion]]s form a nonassociative Moufang loop under octonion multiplication.\n* The subset of unit norm octonions (forming a [[7-sphere]] in '''O''') is closed under multiplication and therefore forms a Moufang loop.\n* The subset of unit norm integral octonions is a finite Moufang loop of order 240.\n* The basis octonions and their additive inverses form a finite Moufang loop of order 16.\n* The set of invertible [[split-octonion]]s forms a nonassociative Moufang loop, as does the set of unit norm split-octonions. More generally, the set of invertible elements in any [[octonion algebra]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' forms a Moufang loop, as does the subset of unit norm elements.\n* The set of all invertible elements in an [[alternative ring]] ''R'' forms a Moufang loop called the '''loop of units''' in ''R''.\n* For any field ''F'' let ''M''(''F'') denote the Moufang loop of unit norm elements in the (unique) split-octonion algebra over ''F''. Let ''Z'' denote the center of ''M''(''F''). If the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''F'' is 2 then ''Z'' = {''e''}, otherwise ''Z'' = {±''e''}. The '''Paige loop''' over ''F'' is the loop ''M''*(''F'') = ''M''(''F'')/''Z''. Paige loops are nonassociative simple Moufang loops. All ''finite'' nonassociative simple Moufang loops are Paige loops over [[finite field]]s. The smallest Paige loop ''M''*(2) has order 120.\n*A large class of nonassociative Moufang loops can be constructed as follows. Let ''G'' be an arbitrary group. Define a new element ''u'' not in ''G'' and let ''M''(''G'',2) = ''G'' ∪ (''G u''). The product in ''M''(''G'',2) is given by the usual product of elements in ''G'' together with\n*:<math>(gu)h = (gh^{-1})u</math>\n*:<math>g(hu) = (hg)u</math>\n*:<math>(gu)(hu) = h^{-1}g.</math>\n:It follows that <math>u^2 = 1</math> and <math>ug = g^{-1}u</math>. With the above product ''M''(''G'',2) is a Moufang loop. It is associative [[if and only if]] ''G'' is abelian.\n*The smallest nonassociative Moufang loop is ''M''(''S''<sub>3</sub>, 2) which has order 12.\n*[[Richard A. Parker]] constructed a Moufang loop of order 2<sup>13</sup>, which was used by Conway in his construction of the [[monster group]]. Parker's loop has a center of order 2 with elements denoted by 1, −1, and the quotient by the center is an elementary abelian group of order 2<sup>12</sup>, identified with the [[binary Golay code]]. The loop is then defined up to isomorphism by the equations\n*:''A''<sup>2</sup> = (−1)<sup>|''A''|/4</sup>\n*:''BA'' = (−1)<sup>|''A''∩''B''|/2</sup>''AB''\n*:''A''(''BC'')= (−1)<sup>|''A''∩''B''∩''C''|</sup>(''AB'')''C''\n:where |''A''| is the number of elements of the code word ''A'', and so on. For more details see Conway, J. H.; Curtis, R. T.; Norton, S. P.; Parker, R. A.; and Wilson, R. A.: ''Atlas of Finite Groups: Maximal Subgroups and Ordinary Characters for Simple Groups.''  Oxford, England.\n\n==Properties==\n===Associativity===\nMoufang loops differ from groups in that they need not be [[associative]]. A Moufang loop that is associative is a group. The Moufang identities may be viewed as weaker forms of associativity.\n\nBy setting various elements to the identity, the Moufang identities imply\n*''x''(''xy'') = (''xx'')''y'' {{ns|2}} [[alternativity|left alternative]] identity\n*(''xy'')''y'' = ''x''(''yy'') {{ns|2}} [[alternativity|right alternative]] identity\n*''x''(''yx'') = (''xy'')''x'' {{ns|2}} flexible identity (see [[flexible algebra]]).\n\nMoufang's theorem states that when three elements ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in a Moufang loop obey the associative law: (''xy'')''z'' = ''x''(''yz'') then they generate an associative subloop; that is, a group. A corollary of this is that all Moufang loops are ''di-associative'' (i.e. the subloop generated by any two elements of a Moufang loop is associative and therefore a group). In particular, Moufang loops are [[power associative]], so that exponents ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> are well-defined. When working with Moufang loops, it is common to drop the parenthesis in expressions with only two distinct elements. For example, the Moufang identities may be written unambiguously as\n#''z''(''x''(''zy'')) = (''zxz'')''y''\n#((''xz'')''y'')''z'' = ''x''(''zyz'')\n#(''zx'')(''yz'') = ''z''(''xy'')''z''.\n\n===Left and right multiplication===\n\nThe Moufang identities can be written in terms of the left and right multiplication operators on ''Q''. The first two identities state that\n*<math>L_zL_xL_z(y) = L_{zxz}(y)</math>\n*<math>R_zR_yR_z(x) = R_{zyz}(x)</math>\nwhile the third identity says\n*<math>L_z(x)R_z(y) = B_z(xy)</math>\nfor all <math>x,y,z</math> in <math>Q</math>. Here <math>B_z = L_zR_z = R_zL_z</math> is bimultiplication by <math>z</math>. The third Moufang identity is therefore equivalent to the statement that the triple <math>(L_z, R_z, B_z)</math> is an [[autotopy]] of <math>Q</math> for all <math>z</math> in <math>Q</math>.\n\n===Inverse properties===\nAll Moufang loops have the [[inverse property loop|inverse property]], which means that each element ''x'' has a [[inverse element|two-sided inverse]] ''x''<sup>−1</sup> which satisfies the identities:\n:<math>x^{-1}(xy) = y = (yx)x^{-1}</math>\nfor all ''x'' and ''y''. It follows that <math>(xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}</math> and <math>x(yz) = e</math> if and only if <math>(xy)z = e</math>.\n\nMoufang loops are universal among inverse property loops; that is, a loop ''Q'' is a Moufang loop if and only if every [[loop isotope]] of ''Q'' has the inverse property. If follows that every loop isotope of a Moufang loop is a Moufang loop.\n\nOne can use inverses to rewrite the left and right Moufang identities in a more useful form:\n*<math>(xy)z = (xz^{-1})(zyz)</math>\n*<math>x(yz) = (xyx)(x^{-1}z).</math>\n\n===Lagrange property===\n\nA finite loop ''Q'' is said to have the ''Lagrange property'' if the order of every subloop of ''Q'' divides the order of ''Q''. [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] in group theory states that every finite group has the Lagrange property. It was an open question for many years whether or not finite Moufang loops had Lagrange property. The question was finally resolved by Alexander Grishkov and Andrei Zavarnitsine, and independently by Stephen Gagola III and Jonathan Hall, in 2003: Every finite Moufang loop does have the Lagrange property. More results for the theory of finite groups have been generalized to Moufang loops by Stephen Gagola III in recent years.\n\n===Moufang quasigroups===\n\nAny [[quasigroup]] satisfying one of the Moufang identities must, in fact, have an identity element and therefore be a Moufang loop. We give a proof here for the third identity:\n:Let ''a'' be any element of ''Q'', and let ''e'' be the unique element such that ''ae'' = ''a''.\n:Then for any ''x'' in ''Q'', (''xa'')''x'' = (''x''(''ae''))''x'' = (''xa'')(''ex'').\n:Cancelling gives ''x'' = ''ex'' so that ''e'' is a left identity element.\n:Now for any ''y'' in ''Q'', ''ye'' = (''ey'')(''ee'') =(''e''(''ye''))''e'' = (''ye'')''e''.\n:Cancelling gives ''y'' = ''ye'', so ''e'' is also a right identity element.\n:Therefore, ''e'' is a two-sided identity element.\n\nThe proofs for the first two identities are somewhat more difficult (Kunen 1996).\n\n==Open problems==\n\n'''Phillips' problem''' is an open problem in the theory presented by J. D. Phillips at Loops '03 in Prague. It asks whether there exists a finite Moufang loop of odd order with a trivial [[Nucleus (algebra)|nucleus]].\n\nRecall that the nucleus of a [[loop (algebra)|loop]] (or more generally a quasigroup) is the set of <math>x</math> such that <math>x(yz)=(xy)z</math>, <math>y(xz)=(yx)z</math> and <math>y(zx)=(yz)x</math> hold for all <math>y,z</math> in the loop.\n\n:''See also'': [[Problems in loop theory and quasigroup theory]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Malcev algebra]]\n*[[Bol loop]]\n*[[Gyrogroup]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{springer|id=M/m065050|title=Moufang loops|author=V.

Concretely, this means that if an element ''x'' is multiplied by itself several times, it doesn't matter in which order the multiplications are carried out, so for instance {{nowrap|1=''x''(''x''(''xx'')) = (''x''(''xx''))''x'' = (''xx'')(''xx'')}}.\n\nEvery [[associative algebra]] is power-associative, but so are all other [[alternative algebra]]s (like the [[octonion]]s, which are non-associative) and even some non-alternative algebras like the [[sedenion]]s and [[Okubo algebra]]s.  Any algebra whose elements are [[idempotent]] is also power-associative.\n\n[[Exponentiation]] to the power of any [[positive integer]] can be defined consistently whenever multiplication is power-associative. For example, there is no need to distinguish whether ''x''<sup>3</sup> should be defined as (''xx'')''x'' or as ''x''(''xx''), since these are equal. Exponentiation to the power of zero can also be defined if the operation has an [[identity element]], so the existence of identity elements is useful in power-associative contexts.\n\nOver a field of [[Characteristic_(algebra)|characteristic]] 0, an algebra is power-associative if and only if it satisfies <math>[x,x,x]=0</math> and <math>[x^2,x,x]=0</math>, where <math>[x,y,z]:=(xy)z-x(yz)</math> is the [[associator]] (Albert 1948).\nOver a field of prime characteristic <math>p>0</math> there is no finite set of identities that characterizes power-associativity, but there are infinite independent sets, as described by Gainov (1970):\n\n* For <math>p=2</math>: <math>[x,x^2,x]=0</math> and <math>[x^{n-2},x,x]=0</math> for <math>n=3,2^k</math> (<math>k=2,3...)</math>\n* For <math>p=3</math>: <math>[x^{n-2},x,x]=0</math> for <math>n=4,5,3^k</math> (<math>k=1,2...)</math>\n* For <math>p=5</math>: <math>[x^{n-2},x,x]=0</math> for <math>n=3,4,6,5^k</math> (<math>k=1,2...)</math>\n* For <math>p>5</math>: <math>[x^{n-2},x,x]=0</math> for <math>n=3,4,p^k</math> (<math>k=1,2...)</math>\n\n\n\nA substitution law holds for real power-associative algebras with unit, which basically asserts that multiplication of polynomials works as expected. For ''f'' a real polynomial in ''x'', and for any ''a'' in such an algebra define ''f''(''a'') to be the element of the algebra resulting from the obvious substitution of ''a'' into ''f''. Then for any two such polynomials ''f'' and ''g'', we have that {{nowrap|1=(''fg'')(''a'') = ''f''(''a'')''g''(''a'')}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alternativity]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite journal | last1=Albert | first1=A.

All division rings, and thus all [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, are quasifields.\n\n==Definition==\n\nA quasifield <math>(Q,+,\\cdot)</math> is a structure, where + and <math> \\cdot \\,</math> are binary operations on Q, satisfying these axioms :\n\n* <math>(Q,+) \\,</math> is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]\n* <math>(Q_{0},\\cdot)</math> is a [[Quasigroup|loop]], where <math>Q_{0} = Q \\setminus \\{0\\} \\,</math>\n* <math>a \\cdot (b+c)=a \\cdot b+a \\cdot c \\quad\\forall a,b,c \\in Q</math> (left [[distributivity]])\n* <math>a \\cdot x=b \\cdot x+c</math> has exactly one solution <math>\\forall a,b,c \\in Q, a\\neq b</math>\n\nStrictly speaking, this is the definition of a ''left'' quasifield. A ''right'' quasifield is similarly defined, but satisfies right distributivity instead. A quasifield satisfying both distributive laws is called a '''[[semifield]]''', in the sense in which the term is used in [[projective geometry]].\n\nAlthough not assumed, one can prove that the axioms imply that the additive group <math>(Q,+)</math> is [[Abelian group|abelian]]. Thus, when referring to an ''abelian quasifield'', one means that <math>(Q_0, \\cdot)</math> is abelian.\n\n==Kernel==\n\nThe kernel K of a quasifield Q is the set of all elements c such that :\n* <math>a \\cdot(b \\cdot c)=(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c\\quad \\forall a,b\\in Q</math>\n* <math>(a+b) \\cdot c=(a \\cdot c)+(b \\cdot c)\\quad \\forall a,b\\in Q</math>\n\nRestricting the binary operations + and <math>\\cdot</math> to K, one can shown that <math>(K,+,\\cdot)</math> is a [[division ring]].\n\nOne can now make a vector space of Q over K, with the following scalar multiplication :\n<math>v \\otimes l = v \\cdot l\\quad \\forall v\\in Q,l\\in K</math>\n\nAs a finite division ring is a finite field by [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]], the order of the kernel of a finite quasifield is a [[prime power]]. The vector space construction implies that the order of any finite quasifield must also be a prime power.\n\n==Examples==\nAll division rings, and thus all fields, are quasifields. \n\nThe smallest quasifields are abelian and unique. They are the [[finite field]]s of orders up to and including eight. The smallest quasifields which are not division rings are the four non-abelian quasifields of order nine; they are presented in {{harvtxt|Hall, Jr.|1959}} and {{harvtxt|Weibel|2007}}.\n\n==Projective planes==\n{{main|Projective plane#Generalized coordinates|l1=Projective plane}}\n\nGiven a quasifield <math>Q</math>, we define a ternary map <math>\\scriptstyle T\\colon Q\\times Q\\times Q\\to Q \\,</math> by\n\n<math>T(a,b,c)=a \\cdot b+c \\quad \\forall a,b,c\\in Q</math>\n\nOne can then verify that <math>(Q,T)</math> satisfies the axioms of a [[planar ternary ring]]. Associated to <math>(Q,T)</math> is its corresponding [[projective plane]]. The projective planes constructed this way are characterized as follows;\nthe details of this relationship are given in {{harvtxt|Hall, Jr.|1959}}. \nA projective plane is a [[translation plane]] with respect to the line at infinity if and only if any (or all) of its associated planar ternary rings are right quasifields. It is called a ''shear plane'' if any (or all) of its ternary rings are left quasifields.\n\nThe plane does not uniquely determine the ring; all 4 nonabelian quasifields of order 9 are ternary rings for the unique non-Desarguesian translation plane of order 9. These differ in the [[Complete quadrangle|fundamental quadrilateral]] used to construct the plane (see Weibel 2007).\n\n==History==\n\nQuasifields were called \"Veblen-Wedderburn systems\" in the literature before 1975, since they were first studied in the\n1907 paper (Veblen-Wedderburn 1907) by [[Oswald_Veblen|O.

This states that, for each ''a'' and ''b'' in ''Q'', there exist unique elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''Q'' such that both\n:''a'' ∗ ''x'' = ''b'',\n:''y'' ∗ ''a'' = ''b'' \nhold.  (In other words: Each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column of the quasigroup's multiplication table, or [[Cayley table]]. This property ensures that the Cayley table of a finite quasigroup is a [[Latin square]].)  The uniqueness requirement can be replaced by the requirement that the magma be [[Cancellation property|cancellative]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=H. Rubin |author2=J. E. Rubin |author2-link= Jean E. Rubin |year=1985 |title=Equivalents of the Axiom of Choice, II |publisher=Elsevier |page=109 }}</ref>\n\nThe unique solutions to these equations are written {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a'' \\ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''b'' / ''a''}}.  The operations '\\' and '/' are called, respectively, '''left''' and '''right''' '''division'''.\n\nThe [[empty set]] equipped with the empty binary operation satisfies this definition of a quasigroup.  Some authors accept the empty quasigroup but others explicitly exclude it.<ref>{{harvnb|Pflugfelder|1990|page=2}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bruck|1971|p=1}}</ref>\n\n===Universal algebra===\nGiven some [[algebraic structure]], an [[mathematical identity|identity]] is an equation in which all variables are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]], and in which all [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] are among the primitive operations proper to the structure. Algebraic structures axiomatized solely by identities are called [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]]. Many standard results in [[universal algebra]] hold only for varieties. Quasigroups are varieties if left and right division are taken as primitive.\n\nA '''quasigroup''' {{nowrap|(''Q'', ∗, \\, /)}} is a type (2,2,2) algebra (i.e., equipped with three binary operations) satisfying the identities:\n:''y'' = ''x'' ∗ (''x'' \\ ''y''),\n:''y'' = ''x'' \\ (''x'' ∗ ''y''),\n:''y'' = (''y'' / ''x'') ∗ ''x'',\n:''y'' = (''y'' ∗ ''x'') / ''x''.\n\nIn other words: Multiplication and division in either order, one after the other, on the same side by the same element, have no net effect.\n\nHence if {{nowrap|(''Q'', ∗)}} is a quasigroup according to the first definition, then {{nowrap|(''Q'', ∗, \\, /)}} is the same quasigroup in the sense of universal algebra.\n\n==Loops==\n\n[[File:Magma to group2.svg|thumb|right|300px|Algebraic structures between magmas and groups.]]\nA '''loop''' is a quasigroup with an [[identity element]]; that is, an element, ''e'', such that\n:''x'' ∗ ''e'' = ''x'' and ''e'' ∗ ''x'' = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''Q''.\n\nIt follows that the identity element, ''e'', is unique, and that every element of ''Q'' has unique [[inverse element|left]] and [[inverse element|right inverse]]s (which need not be the same). Since the presence of an identity element is essential, a loop cannot be empty.\n\nA quasigroup with an [[idempotent element]] is called a '''pique''' (\"pointed idempotent quasigroup\"); this is a weaker notion than a loop but common nonetheless because, for example, given an [[abelian group]], {{nowrap|(''A'', +)}}, taking its subtraction operation as quasigroup multiplication yields a pique {{nowrap|(''A'', −)}} with the group identity (zero) turned into a \"pointed idempotent\".  (That is, there is a [[Quasigroup#Homotopy and isotopy|principal isotopy]] {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ↦ (''x'', −''y'', ''z'')}}.)\n\nA loop that is associative is a group. A group can have a non-associative pique isotope, but it cannot have a nonassociative loop isotope. \n\nThere are weaker associativity properties that have been given special names.\n\nFor instance, a '''[[Bol loop]]''' is a loop that satisfies  either:\n:''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ (''x'' ∗ ''z'')) = (''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ ''x'')) ∗ ''z''{{quad}} for each ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''Q'' (a ''left Bol loop''),\nor else\n:((''z'' ∗ ''x'') ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x'' = ''z'' ∗ ((''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x''){{quad}} for each ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''Q'' (a ''right Bol loop'').\n\nA loop that is both a left and right Bol loop is a '''[[Moufang loop]]'''.  This is equivalent to any one of the following single Moufang identities holding for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'':\n:''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ (''x'' ∗ ''z'')) = ((''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x'') ∗ ''z'',\n:''z'' ∗ (''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ ''x'')) = ((''z'' ∗ ''x'') ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x'',\n:(''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ (''z'' ∗ ''x'') = ''x'' ∗ ((''y'' ∗ ''z'') ∗ ''x''), or\n:(''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ (''z'' ∗ ''x'') = (''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ ''z'')) ∗ ''x''.\n\n== Symmetries ==\nSmith (2007) names the following important properties and subclasses:\n\n=== Semisymmetry ===\nA quasigroup is '''semisymmetric''' if the following equivalent identities hold:\n:''xy'' = ''y'' / ''x'',\n:''yx'' = ''x'' \\ ''y'',\n:''x'' = (''yx'')''y'',\n:''x'' = ''y''(''xy'').\n\nAlthough this class may seem special, every quasigroup ''Q'' induces a semisymmetric quasigroup ''Q''Δ on the direct product cube ''Q''<sup>3</sup> via the following operation:\n\n:<math>(x_1, x_2, x_3) \\cdot (y_1, y_2, y_3) = (y_3/x_2, y_1 \\backslash x_3 , x_1y_2) = (x_2//y_3, x_3 \\backslash \\backslash y_1, x_1y_2) ,</math>\n\nwhere \"//\" and \"\\\\\" are the [[Quasigroup#Conjugation (parastrophe)|conjugate division operations]] given by <math>y // x = x / y</math> and <math>y \\backslash\\backslash x = x \\backslash y</math>.\n\n=== Triality ===\n{{expand section|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Total symmetry ===\nA narrower class that is a '''total symmetric quasigroup''' (sometimes abbreviated '''TS-quasigroup''') in which all conjugates coincide as one operation: {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''x'' / ''y'' = ''x'' \\ ''y''}}. Another way to define (the same notion of) totally symmetric quasigroup is as a semisymmetric quasigroup which additionally is commutative, i.e. {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''yx''}}.\n\nIdempotent total symmetric quasigroups are precisely (i.e. in a bijection with) [[Steiner system|Steiner triples]], so such a quasigroup is also called a '''Steiner quasigroup''', and sometimes the latter is even abbreviated as '''squag'''; the term '''sloop''' is defined similarly for a Steiner quasigroup that is also a loop. Without idempotency, total symmetric quasigroups correspond to the geometric notion of [[extended Steiner triple]], also called Generalized Elliptic Cubic Curve (GECC).\n\n===Total antisymmetry===\nA quasigroup {{nowrap|(''Q'', ∗)}} is called '''totally anti-symmetric''' if for all {{nowrap|''c'', ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''Q''}}, both of the following implications hold:<ref name=Damm2007 >{{cite journal |last=Damm |year=2007 |first=H.

These quasigroups also satisfy {{nowrap|1=(''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''y'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the quasigroup. These quasigroups are known as ''Steiner quasigroups''.<ref>{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|p=497, definition 28.12}}</ref>\n* The set {{nowrap|1={±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}<!---->}} where {{nowrap|1=ii = jj = kk = +1}} and with all other products as in the [[quaternion group]] forms a nonassociative loop of order 8. See [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|hyperbolic quaternions]] for its application. (The hyperbolic quaternions themselves do ''not'' form a loop or quasigroup).\n* The nonzero [[octonions]] form a nonassociative loop under multiplication. The octonions are a special type of loop known as a [[Moufang loop]].\n* An associative quasigroup is either empty or is a group, since if there is at least one element, the existence of inverses and associativity imply the existence of an identity.\n* The following construction is due to [[Hans Zassenhaus]].

This follows from the uniqueness of left division of ''ab'' or ''ac'' by ''a''. Similarly, if {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''ca''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}}.\n\n===Multiplication operators===\n\nThe definition of a quasigroup can be treated as conditions on the left and right multiplication operators {{nowrap|''L''(''x''), ''R''(''y''): ''Q'' → ''Q''}}, defined by \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L(x)y &= xy \\\\\n  R(x)y &= yx \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe definition says that both mappings are [[bijection]]s from ''Q'' to itself. A magma ''Q'' is a quasigroup precisely when all these operators, for every ''x'' in ''Q'', are bijective. The inverse mappings are left and right division, that is, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L(x)^{-1}y &= x\\backslash y \\\\\n  R(x)^{-1}y &= y/x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this notation the identities among the quasigroup's multiplication and division operations (stated in the section on [[#Universal_algebra|universal algebra]])  are\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L(x)L(x)^{-1} &= 1\\qquad&\\text{corresponding to}\\qquad x(x\\backslash y) &= y \\\\\n  L(x)^{-1}L(x) &= 1\\qquad&\\text{corresponding to}\\qquad x\\backslash(xy) &= y \\\\\n  R(x)R(x)^{-1} &= 1\\qquad&\\text{corresponding to}\\qquad (y/x)x &= y \\\\\n  R(x)^{-1}R(x) &= 1\\qquad&\\text{corresponding to}\\qquad (yx)/x &= y\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere 1 denotes the identity mapping on ''Q''.\n\n===Latin squares===\n\nThe multiplication table of a finite quasigroup is a [[Latin square]]: an {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} table filled with ''n'' different symbols in such a way that each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n\nConversely, every Latin square can be taken as the multiplication table of a quasigroup in many ways: the border row (containing the column headers) and the border column (containing the row headers) can each be any permutation of the elements. See [[small Latin squares and quasigroups]].\n\n===Inverse properties===\n\nEvery loop element has a unique left and right inverse given by\n\n:<math>x^{\\lambda} = e/x \\qquad x^{\\lambda}x = e</math>\n:<math>x^{\\rho} = x\\backslash e \\qquad xx^{\\rho} = e</math>\n\nA loop is said to have (''two-sided'') ''inverses'' if <math>x^{\\lambda} = x^{\\rho}</math> for all ''x''. In this case the inverse element is usually denoted by <math>x^{-1}</math>.\n\nThere are some stronger notions of inverses in loops which are often useful:\n*A loop has the ''left inverse property'' if <math>x^{\\lambda}(xy) = y</math> for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. Equivalently, <math>L(x)^{-1} = L(x^{\\lambda})</math> or <math>x\\backslash y = x^{\\lambda}y</math>.\n*A loop has the ''right inverse property'' if <math>(yx)x^{\\rho} = y</math> for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. Equivalently, <math>R(x)^{-1} = R(x^{\\rho})</math> or <math>y/x = yx^{\\rho}</math>.\n*A loop has the ''antiautomorphic inverse property'' if <math>(xy)^{\\lambda} = y^{\\lambda}x^{\\lambda}</math> or, equivalently, if <math>(xy)^{\\rho} = y^{\\rho}x^{\\rho}</math>.\n*A loop has the ''weak inverse property'' when <math>(xy)z = e</math> if and only if <math>x(yz) = e</math>. This may be stated in terms of inverses via <math>(xy)^{\\lambda}x = y^{\\lambda}</math> or equivalently <math>x(yx)^{\\rho} = y^{\\rho}</math>.\n\nA loop has the ''inverse property'' if it has both the left and right inverse properties. Inverse property loops also have the antiautomorphic and weak inverse properties. In fact, any loop which satisfies any two of the above four identities has the inverse property and therefore satisfies all four.\n\nAny loop which satisfies the left, right, or antiautomorphic inverse properties automatically has two-sided inverses.\n\n==Morphisms==\n\nA quasigroup or loop [[homomorphism]] is a [[map (mathematics)|map]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''Q'' → ''P''}} between two quasigroups such that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''xy'') = ''f''(''x'')''f''(''y'')}}. Quasigroup homomorphisms necessarily preserve left and right division, as well as identity elements (if they exist).\n\n===Homotopy and isotopy===\n{{Main article|Isotopy of loops}}\n\nLet ''Q'' and ''P'' be quasigroups. A '''quasigroup homotopy''' from ''Q'' to ''P'' is a triple {{nowrap|(α, β, γ)}} of maps from ''Q'' to ''P'' such that\n:<math>\\alpha(x)\\beta(y) = \\gamma(xy)\\,</math>\nfor all ''x'', ''y'' in ''Q''. A quasigroup homomorphism is just a homotopy for which the three maps are equal.\n\nAn '''isotopy''' is a homotopy for which each of the three maps {{nowrap|(α, β, γ)}} is a [[bijection]]. Two quasigroups are '''isotopic''' if there is an isotopy between them. In terms of Latin squares, an isotopy {{nowrap|(α, β, γ)}} is given by a permutation of rows α, a permutation of columns β, and a permutation on the underlying element set γ.\n\nAn '''autotopy''' is an isotopy from a quasigroup to itself. The set of all autotopies of a quasigroup form a group with the [[automorphism group]] as a subgroup.\n\nEvery quasigroup is isotopic to a loop. If a loop is isotopic to a group, then it is isomorphic to that group and thus is itself a group. However, a quasigroup which is isotopic to a group need not be a group. For example, the quasigroup on '''R''' with multiplication given by {{nowrap|(''x'' + ''y'')/2}} is isotopic to the additive group {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}}, but is not itself a group. Every [[medial magma|medial]] quasigroup is isotopic to an [[abelian group]] by the [[Medial magma#Bruck–Toyoda theorem|Bruck–Toyoda theorem]].\n\n===Conjugation (parastrophe)===\n\nLeft and right division are examples of forming a quasigroup by permuting the variables in the defining equation. From the original operation ∗ (i.e., {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∗ ''y'' = ''z''}}) we can form five new operations: {{nowrap|1=''x'' o ''y'' := ''y'' ∗ ''x''}} (the '''opposite''' operation), / and \\, and their opposites.  That makes a total of six quasigroup operations, which are called the '''conjugates''' or '''parastrophes''' of ∗.   Any two of these operations are said to be \"conjugate\" or \"parastrophic\" to each other (and to themselves).\n\n===Isostrophe (paratopy)===\n\nIf the set ''Q'' has two quasigroup operations, ∗ and ·, and one of them is isotopic to a conjugate of the other, the operations are said to be '''isostrophic''' to each other.  There are also many other names for this relation of \"isostrophe\", e.g., '''paratopy'''.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n=== Polyadic or multiary quasigroups ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Multiary quasigroup]] -->\n\nAn ''n''-'''ary quasigroup''' is a set with an [[arity|''n''-ary operation]], {{nowrap|(''Q'', ''f'')}} with {{nowrap|''f'': ''Q''<sup>''n''</sup> → ''Q''}}, such that the equation {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x<sub>n</sub>'') = ''y''}} has a unique solution for any one variable if all the other ''n'' variables are specified arbitrarily.  '''Polyadic''' or '''multiary''' means ''n''-ary for some nonnegative integer ''n''.\n\nA 0-ary, or '''nullary''', quasigroup is just a constant element of ''Q''.  A 1-ary, or '''unary''', quasigroup is a bijection of ''Q'' to itself.  A '''binary''', or 2-ary, quasigroup is an ordinary quasigroup.\n\nAn example of a multiary quasigroup is an iterated group operation, {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''<sub>1</sub> · ''x''<sub>2</sub> · ··· · ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}; it is not necessary to use parentheses to specify the order of operations because the group is associative.  One can also form a multiary quasigroup by carrying out any sequence of the same or different group or quasigroup operations, if the order of operations is specified.\n\nThere exist multiary quasigroups that cannot be represented in any of these ways.  An ''n''-ary quasigroup is '''irreducible''' if its operation cannot be factored into the composition of two operations in the following way:\n:<math> f(x_1,\\dots,x_n) = g(x_1,\\dots,x_{i-1},\\,h(x_i,\\dots,x_j),\\,x_{j+1},\\dots,x_n), </math>\nwhere {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' ≤ ''n''}} and {{nowrap|(''i, j'') ≠ (1, ''n'')}}.  Finite irreducible ''n''-ary quasigroups exist for all {{nowrap|''n'' > 2}}; see Akivis and Goldberg (2001) for details.\n\nAn ''n''-ary quasigroup with an ''n''-ary version of [[associativity]] is called an [[n-ary group]].\n\n=== Right- and left-quasigroups ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2011}}\nA '''right-quasigroup''' {{nowrap|(''Q'', ∗, /)}} is a type (2,2) algebra satisfying both identities:\n''y'' = (''y'' / ''x'') ∗ ''x'';\n''y'' = (''y'' ∗ ''x'') / ''x''.\n\nSimilarly, a '''left-quasigroup''' {{nowrap|(''Q'', ∗, \\)}} is a type (2,2) algebra satisfying both identities:\n''y'' = ''x'' ∗ (''x'' \\ ''y'');\n''y'' = ''x'' \\ (''x'' ∗ ''y'').\n\n== Number of small quasigroups and loops ==\nThe number of isomorphism classes of small quasigroups {{OEIS|A057991}} and loops {{OEIS|A057771}} is given here:<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/ls_final.pdf | last1=McKay | first1=Brendan D. | last2=Meynert | first2=Alison | last3=Myrvold | first3=Wendy | title=Small Latin squares, quasigroups, and loops | zbl=1112.05018 | journal=J.

      "text": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2019}}\nBelow the '''[[Latin square]]s''' and '''[[quasigroup]]s''' of some small orders (the side length of the square, or the number of elements of the quasigroup) are considered.\n\n==Order 1==\nFor order 1 there is 1 Latin square with symbol a and 1 quasigroup with underlying set {a}; it is a group, the [[trivial group]].\n\n==Order 2==\nFor order 2 there are 2 Latin squares with symbols a and b:\n:   a b &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     b a\n:   b a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     a b\nThey differ only by labelling, i.e., by a permutation of a and b. Thus there is only one isotopy class.\n\nEach can be taken as a multiplication table with border row \"ab\" or \"ba\" and border column \"ab\" or \"ba\". These 8 results are 4 by 4 equal as quasigroups, so there are two quasigroups of order 2. Both are groups, the group Z<sub>2</sub> with a = e and that with b = e.\n\n==Order 3==\nFor order 3 there are 12 Latin squares with symbols a, b, and c; up to relabelling there are 2:\n:   a b c  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a b c\n:   b c a  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  c a b\n:   c a b  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  b c a\nwhich differ only by the order of the rows. Thus there is only one isotopy class.\n\nEach of the 12 is a multiplication table with border row \"abc\" and the same border column (other border rows and columns just give other notations of the same quasigroups). Of these 12, 3 represent a group: the group Z<sub>3</sub> with a = e, that with b = e, and that with c = e. Relabelling the 2 non-identity elements does not give another group, it is an [[automorphism]].\n\n==Order 4==\nFor order 4 there are 576 Latin squares with symbols a, b, c, and d; up to relabelling (e.g. taking abcd as first row) there are 24. Up to relabelling and row order there are 4 (keep the first row as abcd but consider all 6 permutations of the other 3 rows the same), i.e. there are 4 reduced Latin squares:\n:   a b c d  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a b c d  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a b c d   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a b c d\n:   b a d c  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  b a d c  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  b c d a   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b d a c\n:   c d a b  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  c d b a  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  c d a b   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c a d b\n:   d c b a  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  d c a b  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  d a b c   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d c b a\nUp to relabelling with corresponding permutation of the rows and columns (hence keeping the first row abcd and the first column abcd) the last 3 are the same. Thus there are 2 isotopy classes.\n\nEach of the 576 is the multiplication table of a quasigroup with border row \"abcd\" and ditto border column, 144 for the first isotopy class and 432 for the second.\n\nTo find the loops (i.e., quasigroups with an identity element), assume that a is the identity. Then the first row is equal to the border row and the first column to the border column, so we have the four cases shown above. Without the restriction that a is the identity there are 16 cases:\n*4 in the first isotopy class: 4 versions of the [[Klein four-group]], differing only by the choice of which of the 4 elements is the identity. Permutations of the other three elements do not change the group: they form the [[automorphism group]] of the group, i.e., all three play the same role.\n*12 in the second isotopy class: 12 versions of the [[cyclic group]] of order 4, differing by the choice of which of the 4 elements is the identity, and which of the other 3 has order 2. Apart from that there is only one, corresponding to the fact that interchanging the remaining two elements generates the automorphism group of this group.\n\nOf the 576 Latin squares, 288 are solutions of the 2×2 version of [[Sudoku]], sometimes called Shi Doku [http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/sudoku/shidoku.html]. With first row abcd and first column acbd this reduces to 2.\n\n==Order 5==\nFor order 5 there are 161,280 Latin squares with symbols a, b, c, d, and e. There are 280 loops: 5 times the number of reduced Latin squares. 30 of these are groups, all are versions of the cyclic group of order 5. They differ by the choice of which of the 5 elements is the identity, and, for a given non-identity element, the choice which is its square and which its cube. The number 30 is 5! divided by 4, the order of the automorphism group.\n\nAn example of a reduced Latin square is:\n\n<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n 2 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 3 \\\\\n 3 & 5 & 4 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n 4 & 1 & 5 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n 5 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe element corresponding to the 5th row times the inverse of the element corresponding to the 1st row corresponds to the permutation transforming the 1st row in the 5th, i.e. (154)(23), hence its square neither the identity function nor a [[derangement]]. Hence the Latin square cannot represent a group.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of small groups]]\n\n[[Category:Non-associative algebra]]\n[[Category:Latin squares]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''ordered field''' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] together with a [[total order]]ing of its elements that is compatible with the field operations. Historically, the [[axiomatization]] of an ordered field was abstracted gradually from the [[real number]]s, by mathematicians including [[David Hilbert]], [[Otto Hölder]] and [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]]. This grew eventually into the [[Artin–Schreier theorem|Artin–Schreier theory]] of ordered fields and [[formally real field]]s.\n\nAn ordered field necessarily has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 since the elements {{nowrap|0 < 1 < 1 + 1 < 1 + 1 + 1 < ...}} necessarily are all distinct.  Thus, an ordered field necessarily contains an infinite number of elements: a [[finite field]] cannot be ordered.\n\nEvery [[Field extension|subfield]] of an ordered field is also an ordered field in the inherited order. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[rational number]]s. Any [[Dedekind-complete]] ordered field is isomorphic to the real numbers. [[square (algebra)|Squares]] are necessarily non-negative in an ordered field. This implies that the [[complex number]]s cannot be ordered since the square of the [[imaginary unit]] ''i'' is {{num|−1}}. Every ordered field is a [[formally real field]].\n\n==Definitions==\nThere are two equivalent common definitions of an ordered field.  The definition of '''total order''' appeared first historically and is a first-order axiomatization of the ordering ≤ as a [[binary predicate]]. Artin and Schreier gave the definition in terms of '''positive cone''' in 1926, which axiomatizes the subcollection of nonnegative elements.  Although the latter is higher-order, viewing positive cones as ''maximal'' prepositive cones provides a larger context in which field orderings are ''extremal'' partial orderings.\n\n===Total order===\nA [[Field (mathematics)|field]] (''F'', +, ·) together with a [[Total order#Strict total order|(strict) total order]] < on ''F'' is an '''ordered field''' if the order satisfies the following properties for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''F'':\n* if ''a'' < ''b'' then ''a'' + ''c'' < ''b'' + ''c'', and\n* if 0 < ''a'' and 0 < ''b'' then 0 < ''a''·''b''.\nThe symbol for [[multiplication]] will be henceforth omitted.\n\n===Positive cone===\nA '''prepositive cone''' or '''preordering''' of a field ''F'' is a [[subset]] ''P'' ⊂ ''F'' that has the following properties:<ref name=Lam289>Lam (2005) p. 289</ref>\n* For ''x'' and ''y'' in ''P'', both ''x'' + ''y'' and ''xy'' are in ''P''.\n* If ''x'' is in ''F'', then ''x''<sup>2</sup> is in ''P''.\n* The element −1 is not in ''P''.\n\nA '''preordered field''' is a field equipped with a preordering ''P''.  Its non-zero elements ''P''<sup>∗</sup> form a [[subgroup]] of the multiplicative group of ''F''.\n\nIf in addition, the set ''F'' is the union of ''P'' and −''P'', we call ''P'' a '''positive cone''' of ''F''.  The non-zero elements of ''P'' are called the '''positive''' elements of ''F''.\n\nAn '''ordered field''' is a field ''F'' together with a positive cone ''P''.\n\nThe preorderings on ''F'' are precisely the intersections of families of positive cones on ''F''.  The positive cones are the maximal preorderings.<ref name=Lam289/>\n\n===Equivalence of the two definitions===\nLet ''F'' be a field. There is a bijection between the field orderings of ''F'' and the positive cones of ''F''.\n\nGiven a field ordering ≤ as in the first definition, the set of elements such that ''x'' ≥ 0 forms a positive cone of ''F''. Conversely, given a positive cone ''P'' of ''F'' as in the second definition, one can associate a total ordering ≤<sub>''P''</sub> on ''F'' by setting ''x'' ≤<sub>''P''</sub> ''y'' to mean ''y'' − ''x'' ∈ ''P''.  This total ordering ≤<sub>''P''</sub> satisfies the properties of the first definition.\n\n==Examples of ordered fields==\nExamples of ordered fields are:\n* the [[rational number]]s\n* the [[real number]]s\n* any subfield of an ordered field, such as the real [[algebraic numbers]] or [[computable number]]s\n* the field of real [[rational functions]] <math>\\frac {p(x)} {q(x)}\\,</math>, where <math>p(x)</math> and <math>q(x)</math> are [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients, <math>q(x) \\ne 0\\,</math>, can be made into an ordered field where the polynomial <math>p(x)=x</math> is greater than any constant polynomial, by defining that <math>\\frac {p(x)} {q(x)} > 0\\,</math> whenever <math>\\frac {p_0} {q_0} > 0\\,</math>, for <math>p(x) = p_0 x^n + \\cdots</math> and <math>q(x) = q_0 x^m + \\cdots\\,</math>.

Every ordered field can be embedded into the surreal numbers.\n\n==Properties of ordered fields==\n[[File:Invariance of less-than-relation by multiplication with positive number.svg|thumb|The property <math>a > 0 \\land x < y \\Rightarrow ax < ay</math>]]\n[[File:Translation invariance of less-than-relation.svg|thumb|The property <math>x < y \\Rightarrow a+x < a+y</math>]]\n\nFor every ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' in ''F'':\n* Either −''a'' ≤ 0 ≤ ''a'' or ''a'' ≤ 0 ≤ −''a''\n* One can \"add inequalities\": if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''c'' ≤ ''d'', then ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''d''\n* One can \"multiply inequalities with positive elements\": if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and 0 ≤ ''c'', then ''ac'' ≤ ''bc''\n* [[transitive property|Transitivity]] of inequality: if ''a'' < ''b'' and ''b'' < ''c'', then ''a'' < ''c''\n* If ''x'' < ''y'' and ''x'', ''y'' > 0, then 1/''y'' < 1/''x''\n* 1 is positive\n* An ordered field has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. (Since 1 > 0, then 1 + 1 > 0, and 1 + 1 + 1 > 0, etc. If the field had characteristic ''p'' > 0, then −1 would be the sum of ''p''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 ones, but −1 is not positive.)  In particular, finite fields cannot be ordered.\n* Squares are non-negative: 0 ≤ ''a''<sup>2</sup> for all ''a'' in ''F''\n\nEvery subfield of an ordered field is also an ordered field (inheriting the induced ordering). The smallest subfield is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[rational number|rationals]] (as for any other field of characteristic 0), and the order on this rational subfield is the same as the order of the rationals themselves. If every element of an ordered field lies between two elements of its rational subfield, then the field is said to be ''[[Archimedean property|Archimedean]]''. Otherwise, such field is a [[non-Archimedean ordered field]] and contains [[infinitesimal]]s. For example, the [[real number]]s form an Archimedean field, but [[hyperreal numbers]] form a non-Archimedean field, because it [[field extension|extends]] real numbers with elements greater than any standard [[natural number]].<ref name=\"BairHenry\">{{cite web | url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/13591/1/ImplicitDiff.pdf | title=Implicit differentiation with microscopes | publisher=[[University of Liege]] | accessdate=2013-05-04 |author1=Bair, Jaques |author2=Henry, Valérie }}</ref>\n\nAn ordered field ''K'' is isomorphic to the real number field if every non-empty subset of ''K'' with an upper bound in ''K'' has a [[least upper bound]] in&nbsp;''K''. This property implies that the field is Archimedean.\n\n===Vector spaces over an ordered field===\n[[Vector space]]s (particularly, [[Examples of vector spaces#Coordinate space|''n''-spaces]]) over an ordered field exhibit some special properties and have some specific structures, namely: [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]], [[convex analysis|convexity]], and [[inner product space|positively-definite inner product]]. See [[Real coordinate space#Geometric properties and uses]] for discussion of those properties of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, which can be generalized to vector spaces over other ordered fields.\n\n==Which fields can be ordered?==\nEvery ordered field is a [[formally real field]], i.e., 0 cannot be written as a sum of nonzero squares.<ref name=Lam41>Lam (2005) p. 41</ref><ref name=Lam232>Lam (2005) p. 232</ref>\n\nConversely, every formally real field can be equipped with a compatible total order, that will turn it into an ordered field. (This order need not be uniquely determined.) The proof uses [[Zorn's lemma]].<ref name=Lam236>Lam (2005) p. 236</ref>\n\n[[Finite field]]s and more generally fields of finite [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] cannot be turned into ordered fields, because in characteristic ''p'', the element −1 can be written as a sum of (''p'' − 1) squares 1<sup>2</sup>. The [[complex number]]s also cannot be turned into an ordered field, as −1 is a square (of the imaginary number ''i'') and would thus be positive. Also, the [[p-adic numbers]] cannot be ordered, since according to [[Hensel's lemma#Examples|Hensel's lemma]] '''Q'''<sub>2</sub> contains a square root of −7, thus 1<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+({{radic|−7}})<sup>2</sup>=0, and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> (''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2) contains a square root of 1−''p'', thus (''p''−1)·1<sup>2</sup>+({{radic|1−''p''}})<sup>2</sup>=0.\n\n==Topology induced by the order==\nIf ''F'' is equipped with the [[order topology]] arising from the total order ≤, then the axioms guarantee that the operations + and × are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]], so that ''F'' is a [[topological field]].\n\n==Harrison topology==\nThe '''Harrison topology''' is a topology on the set of orderings ''X''<sub>''F''</sub> of a formally real field ''F''.  Each order can be regarded as a multiplicative group homomorphism from ''F''<sup>∗</sup> onto ±1.  Giving ±1 the [[discrete topology]] and ±1<sup>''F''</sup> the [[product topology]] induces the [[subspace topology]] on ''X''<sub>''F''</sub>.  The '''Harrison sets''' <math>H(a) = \\{ P \\in X_F : a \\in P \\}</math> form a [[subbasis]] for the Harrison topology.  The product is a [[Boolean space]] ([[Compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and [[Totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]]), and ''X''<sub>''F''</sub> is a closed subset, hence again Boolean.<ref name=Lam271>Lam (2005) p. 271</ref><ref name=L8312>Lam (1983) pp.&nbsp;1–2</ref>\n\n==Fans and superordered fields==\n\nA '''fan''' on ''F'' is a preordering ''T'' with the property that if ''S'' is a subgroup of index 2 in ''F''<sup>∗</sup> containing ''T''&nbsp;−&nbsp;{0} and not containing&nbsp;−1 then ''S'' is an ordering (that is, ''S'' is closed under addition).<ref name=L8339>Lam (1983) p.&nbsp;39</ref>  A '''superordered field''' is a totally real field in which the set of sums of squares forms a fan.<ref name=L8345>Lam (1983) p.&nbsp;45</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ordered ring]]\n* [[Ordered vector space]]\n* [[Preorder field]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation | last=Lam | first=T.

The set of elements 0 ≤ ''x'' is often denoted with ''G''<sup>+</sup>, and it is called the '''positive cone of G'''. So we have ''a'' ≤ ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''-a''+''b'' ∈ ''G''<sup>+</sup>.\n\nBy the definition, we can reduce the partial order to a monadic property: ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if ''0'' ≤ ''-a''+''b''.\n\nFor the general group ''G'', the existence of a positive cone specifies an order on ''G''.

Namely, a Riesz group satisfies the '''Riesz interpolation property''': if ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub> are elements of ''G'' and ''x<sub>i</sub>'' ≤ ''y<sub>j</sub>'', then there exists ''z'' ∈ ''G'' such that ''x<sub>i</sub>'' ≤ ''z'' ≤ ''y<sub>j</sub>''.\n\nIf ''G'' and ''H'' are two partially ordered groups, a map from ''G'' to ''H'' is a ''morphism of partially ordered groups'' if it is both a [[group homomorphism]] and a [[monotonic function]]. The partially ordered groups, together with this notion of morphism, form a [[category theory|category]].\n\nPartially ordered groups are used in the definition of [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]]s of [[field (mathematics)|field]]s.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* The integers\n* An [[ordered vector space]] is a partially ordered group\n* A [[Riesz space]] is a lattice-ordered group\n* A typical example of a partially ordered group is '''[[integer|Z]]'''<sup>''n''</sup>, where the group operation is componentwise addition, and we write (''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) ≤ (''b''<sub>1</sub>,...,''b''<sub>''n''</sub>) [[if and only if]] ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> (in the usual order of integers) for all ''i''=1,...,''n''.\n* More generally, if ''G'' is a partially ordered group and ''X'' is some set, then the set of all functions from ''X'' to ''G'' is again a partially ordered group: all operations are performed componentwise. Furthermore, every [[subgroup]] of ''G'' is a partially ordered group: it inherits the order from ''G''.\n* If ''A'' is an [[approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra]], or more generally, if ''A'' is a stably finite unital C*-algebra, then [[Approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra#K0|K<sub>0</sub>]](''A'') is a partially ordered [[abelian group]].

Also, the ring of all (bounded) definable functions <math>S\\to M</math> is real closed.\n* Real closed rings are precisely the rings of [[global section]]s of affine real closed spaces (a generalization of [[semialgebraic space]]s) and in this context they were invented by Niels Schwartz in the early 1980s.\n\n==Definition==\nA real closed ring is a reduced, commutative unital ring ''A'' which has the following properties:\n#The set of squares of ''A'' is the set of nonnegative elements of a partial order ≤ on ''A'' and ''(A,≤)'' is an [[f-ring]].\n#Convexity condition: For all a,b from ''A'', if 0≤a≤b then b|a<sup>2</sup>.\n#For every [[prime ideal]] ''p'' of ''A'', the [[residue class ring]] ''A/p'' is [[integrally closed domain|integrally closed]] and its [[field of fractions]] is a real closed field.\nThe link to the definition at the beginning of this article is given in the section on algebraic properties below.\n\n==The real closure of a commutative ring==\nEvery commutative unital ring ''R'' has a so-called '''real closure''' rcl(''R'') and this is unique up to a unique ring\nhomomorphism over ''R''. This means that rcl(''R'') is a real closed ring and there is a (not necessarily injective) ring homomorphism\n<math>r:R\\to rcl(R)</math> such that for every ring homomorphism <math>f:R\\to A</math> to some other real closed ring ''A'', there is a unique ring homomorphism  <math>g:rcl(R)\\to A</math> with <math>f=g\\circ r</math>.\n\nFor example, the real closure of the polynomial ring <math>\\mathbb{R}[T_1,...,T_n]</math>\nis the ring of continuous semi-algebraic functions <math>\\mathbb{R}^n\\to \\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nNote that an arbitrary ring ''R'' is semi-real (i.e. -1 is not a sum of squares in ''R'')\nif and only if the real closure of ''R'' is not the null ring.\n\nNote also that the real closure of an [[ordered field]] is in general '''not''' the real closure of the underlying field. For example, the real closure of the '''ordered''' subfield <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt 2)</math> \nof <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is the field <math>\\mathbb{R}_{alg}</math> of real algebraic numbers,\nwhereas the real closure of the field <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt 2)</math> is the ring \n<math>\\mathbb{R}_{alg}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{alg}</math> (corresponding to the two orders of <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt 2)</math>). More generally the real closure of a field ''F''\nis a certain subdirect product of the real closures of the ordered fields ''(F,P)'', where ''P'' runs through the orderings of ''F''.\n\n==Algebraic properties==\n* The [[category theory|category]] ''RCR'' of real closed rings which has real closed rings as objects and ring homomorphisms as maps has the following properties:\n#Arbitrary products, direct limits and inverse limits (in the category of commutative unital rings) of real closed rings are again real closed. The [[Pushout (category theory)|fibre sum]] of two real closed rings ''B,C'' over some real closed ring ''A'' exists in ''RCR'' and is the real closure of the [[tensor product]] of ''B'' and ''C'' over ''A''.\n#''RCR'' has arbitrary limits and co-limits.\n#''RCR'' is a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] in the sense of [[universal algebra]] (but not a subvariety of commutative rings).\n* For a real closed ring ''A'', the natural homomorphism of ''A'' to the product of all its [[residue field]]s is an isomorphism onto a subring of this product that is closed under continuous [[Semialgebraic set|semi-algebraic]] functions defined over the integers. Conversely, every subring of a product of real closed fields with this property is real closed.\n* If ''I'' is a [[radical ideal]] of a real closed ring ''A'', then also the [[residue class ring]] ''A''/''I'' is real closed. If ''I'' and ''J'' are radical ideals of a real closed ring then the sum ''I''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''J'' is again a radical ideal.\n* All classical [[Localization of a ring|localization]]s ''S''<sup>−1</sup>''A'' of a real closed ring ''A'' are real closed. The epimorphic hull and the complete ring of quotients of a real closed ring are again real closed.\n* The (real) holomorphy ring ''H''(''A'') of a real closed ring ''A'' is again real closed. By definition, ''H''(''A'') consists of all elements ''f'' in ''A'' with the property ''−N''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''f''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''N'' for some natural number ''N''. Applied to the examples above, this means that the rings of bounded (semi-algebraic/definable) continuous functions are all real closed.\n* The support map from the [[real spectrum]] of a real closed ring to its [[Spectrum of a ring|Zariski spectrum]], which sends an ordering ''P'' to its support <math>P\\cap -P</math> is a [[homeomorphism]]. In particular, the Zariski spectrum of every real closed ring ''A'' is a root system (in the sense of [[graph theory]]) and therefore ''A'' is also a Gel'fand ring (i.e. every [[prime ideal]] of ''A'' is contained in a unique maximal ideal of ''A''). The comparison of the Zariski spectrum of ''A'' with the Zariski spectrum of ''H(A)'' leads to a homeomorphism between the maximal spectra of these rings, generalizing the Gel'fand-Kolmogorov theorem for rings of real valued continuous functions.\n* The natural map ''r'' from an arbitrary ring ''R'' to its real closure rcl(''R'') as explained above, induces a homeomorphism from the real spectrum of rcl(''R'') to the real spectrum of ''R''.\n* Summarising and significantly strengthening the previous two properties, the following is true: The natural map ''r'' from an arbitrary ring ''R'' to its real closure rcl(''R'') induces an identification of the [[affine scheme]] of rcl(''R'') with the affine real closed space of ''R''.\n* Every local real closed ring is a [[Henselian ring]]  (but in general local real closed domains are not valuation rings).\n\n==Model theoretic properties==\n\nThe class of real closed rings is [[first-order theory|first-order]] [[axiom]]atizable and [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. The class of all real closed valuation rings is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] (by Cherlin-Dickmann) and the class of all real closed fields is decidable (by Tarski). After naming a definable radical relation, real closed rings have a [[Model complete theory|model companion]], namely [[von Neumann regular]] real closed rings.\n\n==Comparison with characterizations of real closed fields==\n\nThere are many different characterizations of [[real closed field|real closed '''fields''']]. For example,\nin terms of maximality (with respect to algebraic extensions): a real closed field is a maximally orderable field; or, a real closed field (together with its unique ordering) is a maximally ordered field. Another characterization says that the intermediate value theorem holds for all polynomials in one variable over the (ordered) field. In the case of commutative rings, all these properties can be (and are) analyzed in the literature. They all lead to different classes of rings which are unfortunately also called 'real closed' (because a certain characterization of real closed fields has been extended to rings). '''None''' of them lead to the class of real closed rings and none of them allow a satisfactory notion of a closure operation. A central point in the definition of real closed rings is the globalisation of the notion of a real closed field to rings when these rings are represented as rings of functions on some space (typically, the real spectrum of the ring).\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n* Cherlin, Gregory.

      "text": "In [[abstract algebra]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] that is simultaneously a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and a [[monoid]] ''x''•''y'' which admits operations ''x''\\''z'' and ''z''/''y'', loosely analogous to division or implication, when ''x''•''y'' is viewed as multiplication or conjunction, respectively.  Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative.  The general concept was introduced by [[Morgan Ward]] and [[Robert P. Dilworth]] in 1939.  Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s, [[Heyting algebra]]s, [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s, [[relation algebra]]s, and [[MV-algebra]]s.  [[Residuated lattice#Residuated semilattice|Residuated semilattices]] omit the meet operation &and;, for example [[Kleene algebra]]s and [[action algebra]]s.\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] '''L''' = (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') such that\n:  (i) (''L'', ≤) is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].\n: (ii) (''L'', •, '''I''') is a [[monoid]].\n:(iii)  For all ''z'' there exists for every ''x'' a greatest ''y'', and for every ''y'' a greatest ''x'', such that ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' (the residuation properties).\n\nIn (iii), the \"greatest ''y''\", being a function of ''z'' and ''x'', is denoted ''x''\\''z'' and called the '''right residual''' of ''z'' by ''x''. Think of it as what remains of ''z'' on the right after \"dividing\" ''z'' on the left by ''x''.  Dually, the \"greatest ''x''\" is denoted ''z''/''y'' and called the '''left residual''' of ''z'' by ''y''.  An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is\n\n(iii)'  for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L'', &nbsp; ''y'' ≤ ''x''\\''z'' &nbsp; ⇔ &nbsp; ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' &nbsp; ⇔ &nbsp; ''x'' ≤ ''z''/''y''.\n\nAs suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient.  More precisely, for a given ''x'' in ''L'', the unary operations ''x''• and ''x''\\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a [[Galois connection]] on '''L''', and dually for the two functions •''y'' and /''y''.  By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely,\n:''x''•(''x''\\''y'') ≤ ''y'' ≤ ''x''\\(''x''•''y''), and\n:(''y''/''x'')•''x'' ≤ ''y'' ≤ (''y''•''x'')/''x'',\n\ntogether with the requirement that ''x''•''y'' be monotone in ''x'' and ''y''.  (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.)  These give a sense in which the functions ''x''• and ''x''\\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •''x'' and /''x''.\n\nThis last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as ''x''•''y'' ≤ (''x''&or;''z'')•''y'' and similarly for the other operations and their arguments.  Moreover, any inequality ''x'' ≤ ''y'' can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either ''x''&and;''y'' = ''x'' or ''x''&or;''y'' = ''y''.  This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') thereby expanding it to (''L'', &and;, &or;, •, '''I''', /, \\).  When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations.  Note that distributivity ''x''•(''y'' &or; ''z'') = (''x''•''y'') &or; (''x''•''z'') and ''x''•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition.  This necessary distributivity of • over &or; does not in general entail distributivity of &and; over &or;, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice.  However distributivity of &and; over &or; is entailed when • and &and; are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a [[Heyting algebra]].\n  \nAlternative notations for ''x''•''y'' include ''x''&#9702;''y'', ''x'';''y'' ([[relation algebra]]), and ''x''⊗''y'' ([[linear logic]]).  Alternatives for '''I''' include ''e'' and 1'.  Alternative notations for the residuals are ''x'' → ''y'' for ''x''\\''y'' and ''y'' ← ''x'' for ''y''/''x'', suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative.  When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide.  When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: ''x''•''y'' means ''x'' ''and then'' ''y'', &nbsp; ''x'' → ''y'' means ''had'' ''x'' (in the past) ''then'' ''y'' (now), &nbsp; and ''y'' ← ''x'' means ''if-ever'' ''x'' (in the future) ''then'' ''y'' (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.\n\n== Examples ==\nOne of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Given a ring ''R'', the ideals of ''R'', denoted Id(''R''), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and \"ideal addition\" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by \"ideal multiplication\", and the element ''R'' of Id(''R'') acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals ''A'' and ''B'' in Id(''R''), the residuals are given by\n:<math>A/B:= \\{r \\in R \\mid rB \\subseteq A \\}</math>\n:<math>B\\setminus A:=\\{ r \\in R \\mid Br \\subseteq A \\}</math>\nIt is worth noting that {0}/''B'' and ''B''\\{0} are respectively the left and right [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilators]] of ''B''. This residuation is related to the ''[[conductor (ring theory)|conductor]]'' (or ''transporter'') in [[commutative algebra]] written as (''A'':''B'')=''A''/''B''. One difference in usage is that ''B'' need not be an ideal of ''R'': it may just be a subset.\n\n[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[Heyting algebras]] are commutative residuated lattices in which ''x''•''y'' = ''x''&and;''y'' (whence the unit '''I''' is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals ''x''\\''y'' and ''y''/''x'' are the same operation, namely implication ''x'' → ''y''.  The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite [[distributive lattice]]s, as well as all chains or [[total order]]s forming a [[complete lattice]], for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±<math>\\infty</math>.\n\nThe structure ('''Z''', ''min'', ''max'', +, 0, &minus;, &minus;) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice.  In this example the inequalities are equalities because &minus; (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse.  Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example.  The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided ''min'' and ''max'' are interchanged and &minus; is replaced by [[monus]], defined (in this case) so that ''x''-''y'' = 0 when ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and otherwise is ordinary subtraction.\n\nA more general class of examples is given by the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of all [[binary relations]] on a set ''X'',  namely the power set of ''X''<sup>2</sup>, made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation '''I''' on ''X'' consisting of all pairs (''x'',''x'') for ''x'' in ''X''.  Given two relations ''R'' and ''S'' on ''X'', the right residual ''R''\\''S'' of ''S'' by ''R'' is the binary relation such that ''x''(''R''\\''S'')''y'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''zRx'' implies ''zSy'' (notice the connection with implication).  The left residual is the mirror image of this: ''y''(''S''/''R'')''x'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''xRz'' implies ''ySz''.\n\nThis can be illustrated with the binary relations < and > on {0,1} in which 0 < 1 and 1 > 0 are the only relationships that hold.  Then ''x''(>\\<)''y'' holds just when ''x'' = 1, while ''x''(</>)''y'' holds just when ''y'' = 0, showing that residuation of < by > is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left.  This difference is a consequence of the difference between <•> and >•<, where the only relationships that hold are 0(<•>)0 (since 0<1>0) and 1(>•<)1 (since 1>0<1).  Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of < and >, ≥\\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all ''x'' and ''y'' (since ''x''≤1≥''y'' and ''x''≥0≤''y'').\n\nThe Boolean algebra 2<sup>Σ*</sup> of all [[formal language]]s over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation ''LM'' and whose monoid unit '''I''' is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε.  The right residual ''M''\\''L'' consists of all words ''w'' over Σ such that ''Mw'' ⊆ ''L''.  The left residual ''L''/''M'' is the same with ''wM'' in place of ''Mw''.\n\nThe residuated lattice of all binary relations on ''X'' is finite just when ''X'' is finite, and commutative just when ''X'' has at most one element.  When ''X'' is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = '''I'''.  The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter.  It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit '''I''' = {ε} = 1.\n\nThe examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s.\n\nIn [[natural language]] residuated lattices formalize the logic of \"and\" when used with its noncommutative meaning of \"and then.\"  Setting ''x'' = ''bet'', ''y'' = ''win'', ''z'' = ''rich'', we can read ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' as \"bet and then win entails rich.\"  By the axioms this is equivalent to ''y'' ≤ ''x''→''z'' meaning \"win entails had bet then rich\", and also to ''x'' ≤ ''z''←''y'' meaning \"bet entails if-ever win then rich.\"  Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as \"bet entails had win then rich\" and \"win entails if-ever bet then rich\" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking \"win and then bet entails rich.\"  Humans do not so readily detect that [[Peirce's law]] ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P'' is a classical [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with non-classical reasoning than classical (for example, in [[relevance logic]], Peirce's law is not a tautology).\n\n==Residuated semilattice==\nA '''residuated semilattice''' is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation &and;.  Thus it is an [[algebraic structure]] L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \\) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol &and;.  The option of defining ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as ''x''&and;''y'' = ''x'' is then not available, leaving only the other option ''x''&or;''y'' = ''y'' (or any equivalent thereof).\n\nAny residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting &and;.  Residuated semilattices arise in connection with [[action algebra]]s, which are residuated semilattices that are also [[Kleene algebra]]s, for which &and; is ordinarily not required.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quantale]]\n* [[Residuated mapping]]\n* [[Substructural logic]]\n* [[Residuated Boolean algebra]]\n\n== References ==\n* [[Morgan Ward|Ward, Morgan]], and [[Robert P.

Let the elements of ''G'' be the points of the [[Euclidean plane]], given by their [[Cartesian coordinate]]s: pairs  (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') of real numbers. Let the group addition operation be [[pointwise]] (vector) addition, and order these points in [[lexicographic order]]: if ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''u'',&nbsp;''v'') and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x'',&nbsp;''y''), then ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''u''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'',&nbsp;''v''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''), and\n''a''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''b'' exactly when either ''v''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'' or ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y'' and ''u''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x''. Then this gives an ordered group, but one that is not Archimedean. To see this, consider the elements (1,&nbsp;0) and (0,&nbsp;1), both of which are greater than the zero element of the group (the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]). For every natural number ''n'', it follows from these definitions that ''n''&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''n'',&nbsp;0)&nbsp;<&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;1), so there is no ''n'' that satisfies the Archimedean property.<ref>{{citation|title=Introduction to Global Variational Geometry|volume=13|series=North-Holland Mathematical Library|first=Demeter|last=Krupka|publisher=Elsevier|year=2000|isbn=9780080954202|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyu0DzN6xk8C&pg=PA8}}.</ref> This group can be thought of as the additive group of pairs of a real number and an [[infinitesimal]], <math>(x, y) = x + y \\epsilon,</math> where <math>\\epsilon</math> is a unit infinitesimal: <math>\\epsilon > 0</math> but <math>\\epsilon < x</math> for any positive real number <math>x > 0</math>. [[Non-Archimedean ordered field]]s can be defined similarly, and their additive groups are non-Archimedean ordered groups.

      "text": "{{about|abstract algebra|the physical law|Archimedes' principle}}[[File:Archimedean property.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of the Archimedean property.]]\nIn [[abstract algebra]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], the '''Archimedean property''', named after the ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], is a property held by some [[algebraic structure]]s, such as ordered or normed [[group (algebra)|groups]], and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Roughly speaking, it is the property of having no ''infinitely large'' or ''infinitely small'' elements. It was [[Otto Stolz]] who gave the axiom of Archimedes its name because it appears as Axiom V of Archimedes’ ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.<ref>G. Fisher (1994) in P. Ehrlich(ed.), Real Numbers, Generalizations of the Reals, and Theories of continua, 107-145, Kluwer Academic</ref>\n\nThe notion arose from the theory of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitudes]] of Ancient Greece; it still plays an important role in modern mathematics such as [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert's axioms|axioms for geometry]], and the theories of [[linearly ordered group|ordered groups]], [[ordered field]]s, and [[local fields]].\n\nAn algebraic structure in which any two non-zero elements are ''comparable'', in the sense that neither of them is [[infinitesimal]] with respect to the other, is said to be '''Archimedean'''. A structure which has a pair of non-zero elements, one of which is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is said to be '''non-Archimedean'''. For example, a [[linearly ordered group]] that is Archimedean is an [[Archimedean group]].\n\nThis can be made precise in various contexts with slightly different formulations. For example, in the context of [[ordered field]]s, one has the '''axiom of Archimedes''' which formulates this property, where the field of [[real number]]s is Archimedean, but that of [[rational functions]] in real coefficients is not.\n\n==History and origin of the name of the Archimedean property==\nThe concept was named by [[Otto Stolz]] (in the 1880s) after the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geometer and physicist [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].\n\nThe Archimedean property appears in Book V of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] as Definition 4:\n\n{{Quote|Magnitudes are said to have a ratio to one another which can, when multiplied, exceed one another.}}\n\nBecause Archimedes credited it to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] it is also known as the \"Theorem of Eudoxus\" or the ''Eudoxus axiom''.<ref name=\"Knopp1951\">{{cite book|last=Knopp|first=Konrad|authorlink=Konrad Knopp|title=Theory and Application of Infinite Series|edition=English 2nd|page=7|year=1951|publisher=Blackie & Son, Ltd.|location=London and Glasgow|isbn=0-486-66165-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Archimedes's use of infinitesimals|Archimedes used infinitesimals]] in [[heuristic]] arguments, although he denied that those were finished [[mathematical proof]]s.\n\n==Definition for linearly ordered groups==\nLet ''x'' and ''y'' be positive elements<!-- link has to be fixed --> of a [[linearly ordered group]] G. Then '''''x'' is infinitesimal with respect to ''y''''' (or equivalently, '''''y'' is infinite with respect to ''x''''') if, for every [[natural number]] ''n'', the multiple ''nx'' is less than ''y'', that is, the following inequality holds:\n\n::: <math> \\underbrace{x+\\cdots+x}_{n\\text{ terms}} < y. \\, </math>\n\nThe group G is '''Archimedean''' if there is no pair ''x'',''y'' such that ''x'' is infinitesimal with respect to ''y''.\n\nAdditionally, if ''K'' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a unit (1) — for example, a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] — a similar definition applies to ''K''. If ''x'' is infinitesimal with respect to 1, then ''x'' is an '''infinitesimal element'''. Likewise, if ''y'' is infinite with respect to 1, then ''y'' is an '''infinite element'''. The algebraic structure ''K'' is Archimedean if it has no infinite elements and no infinitesimal elements.\n\n===Ordered fields===\nAn [[ordered field]] has some additional properties.\n*One may assume that the rational numbers are contained in the field.\n*If <var>x</var> is infinitesimal, then 1/<var>x</var> is infinite, and vice versa. Therefore, to verify that a field is Archimedean it is enough to check only that there are no infinitesimal elements, or to check that there are no infinite elements.\n*If <var>x</var> is infinitesimal and <var>r</var> is a rational number, then {{math|<var>r</var> <var>x</var>}} is also infinitesimal. As a result, given a general element ''c'', the three numbers ''c''/2, ''c'', and 2''c'' are either all infinitesimal or all non-infinitesimal.\nIn this setting, an ordered field ''K'' is Archimedean precisely when the following statement, called the '''axiom of Archimedes''', holds:\n: ''Let x be any element of K. Then there exists a natural number n such that n > x.''\nAlternatively one can use the following characterization:\n: ∀''ε'' > 0 ∈ ''K'': ∃''n'' ∈ '''N''':1/''n'' < ''ε''.\n\n==Definition for normed fields==\nThe qualifier \"Archimedean\" is also formulated in the theory of [[Valuation ring|rank one valued fields]] and normed spaces over rank one valued fields as follows.  Let ''F'' be a field endowed with an absolute value function, i.e., a function which associates the real number 0 with the field element 0 and associates a positive real number <math>|x|</math> with each non-zero <math> x\\in F</math> and satisfies\n<math>|xy|=|x| |y|</math> and <math>|x+y| \\le |x|+|y|</math>. Then, ''F'' is said to be '''Archimedean''' if for any non-zero <math> x\\in F</math> there exists a [[natural number]] ''n'' such that\n\n::: <math>|\\underbrace{x+\\cdots+x}_{n\\text{ terms}}| > 1. \\, </math>\n\nSimilarly, a normed space is Archimedean if a sum of <math> n </math> terms, each equal to a non-zero vector <math> x </math>, has norm greater than one for sufficiently large <math> n </math>. A field with an absolute value or a normed space is either Archimedean or satisfies the stronger condition, referred to as the [[ultrametric]] [[triangle inequality]],\n\n::: <math>|x+y| \\le \\max(|x|,|y|)</math>,\n\nrespectively. A field or normed space satisfying the ultrametric triangle inequality is called '''non-Archimedean'''.\n\nThe concept of a non-Archimedean normed linear space was introduced by A. F. Monna.<ref name=monna1>Monna, A. F., Over een lineare P-adisches ruimte, Indag. Math., 46 (1943), 74–84.</ref>\n\n==Examples and non-examples==\n\n===Archimedean property of the real numbers===\nThe field of the rational numbers can be assigned one of a number of absolute value functions, including the trivial function <math>|x|=1,</math> when <math> x \\neq 0</math>, the more usual <math>|x| = \\sqrt{x^2}</math>, and the '''''p''-adic absolute value''' functions. By [[Ostrowski's theorem]], every non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers is equivalent to either the usual absolute value or some {{mvar|p}}-adic absolute value. The rational field is not complete with respect to non-trivial absolute values; with respect to the trivial absolute value, the rational field is a discrete topological space, so complete. The completion with respect to the usual absolute value (from the order) is the field of real numbers. By this construction the  field of real numbers is Archimedean both as an ordered field and as a normed field.<ref>[[Neal Koblitz]], \"p-adic Numbers, p-adic Analysis, and Zeta-Functions\",  Springer-Verlag,1977.</ref> On the other hand, the completions with respect to the other non-trivial absolute values give the fields of {{mvar|p}}-adic numbers, where {{mvar|p}} is a prime integer number (see below); since the {{mvar|p}}-adic absolute values satisfy the [[ultrametric]] property, then the {{mvar|p}}-adic number fields are non-Archimedean as normed fields (they cannot be made into ordered fields).\n\n<!-- \"by axiom\" side -->In the [[axiomatic theory of real numbers]], the non-existence of nonzero infinitesimal real numbers is implied by the [[least upper bound property]] as follows. Denote by ''Z'' the set consisting of all positive infinitesimals. This set is bounded above by 1. Now [[proof by contradiction|assume for a contradiction]] that ''Z'' is nonempty. Then it has a [[least upper bound]] ''c'', which is also positive, so ''c''/2 < ''c'' < 2''c''. Since ''c'' is an [[upper bound]] of ''Z'' and 2''c'' is strictly larger than ''c'', 2''c'' is not a positive infinitesimal. That is, there is some natural number ''n'' for which 1/''n'' < 2''c''. On the other hand, ''c''/2 is a positive infinitesimal, since by the definition of least upper bound there must be an infinitesimal ''x'' between ''c''/2 and ''c'', and if 1/''k'' < ''c''/2 <= ''x'' then ''x'' is not infinitesimal. But 1/(4''n'') < ''c''/2, so ''c''/2 is not infinitesimal, and this is a contradiction. This means that ''Z'' is empty after all: there are no positive, infinitesimal real numbers.\n\nThe Archimedean property of real numbers holds also in [[constructive analysis]], even though the least upper bound property may fail in that context.\n\n===Non-Archimedean ordered field===\n{{main article|Non-Archimedean ordered field}}\nFor an example of an [[ordered field]] that is not Archimedean, take the field of [[rational function]]s with real coefficients. (A rational function is any function that can be expressed as one [[polynomial]] divided by another polynomial; we will assume in what follows that this has been done in such a way that the [[leading coefficient]] of the denominator is positive.) To make this an ordered field, one must assign an ordering compatible with the addition and multiplication operations. Now ''f'' > ''g'' if and only if ''f''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''g'' > 0, so we only have to say which rational functions are considered positive. Call the function positive if the leading coefficient of the numerator is positive. (One must check that this ordering is well defined and compatible with addition and multiplication.) By this definition, the rational function 1/''x'' is positive but less than the rational function 1. In fact, if ''n'' is any natural number, then ''n''(1/''x'') = ''n''/''x'' is positive but still less than 1, no matter how big ''n'' is. Therefore, 1/''x'' is an infinitesimal in this field.\n\nThis example generalizes to other coefficients.  Taking rational functions with rational instead of real coefficients produces a countable non-Archimedean ordered field.  Taking the coefficients to be the rational functions in a different variable, say ''y'', produces an example with a different [[order type]].\n\n===Non-Archimedean valued fields===\nThe field of the rational numbers endowed with the p-adic metric and the  [[p-adic number]] fields which are the completions, do not have the Archimedean property as fields with absolute values. <!-- Another example is the [[hyperreal numbers]] of [[nonstandard analysis]]. : (ed. I detest this, because the formal interpretation of the Axiom of Archimedes is indeed satisfied by hypernatural numbers in place of the \"standard\" natural numbers, which do not form a \"hyperset\" (or *-set, superset, whatever we call it) inside the system of the \"hyperreal numbers\".)--> All Archimedean valued fields are isometrically isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers with a power of the usual absolute value.<ref name=shell1>Shell, Niel, Topological Fields and Near Valuations, Dekker, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8247-8412-X}}</ref>\n\n===Equivalent definitions of Archimedean ordered field===\nEvery linearly ordered field ''K'' contains (an isomorphic copy of) the rationals as an ordered subfield, namely the subfield generated by the multiplicative unit 1 of ''K'', which in turn contains the integers as an ordered subgroup, which contains the natural numbers as an ordered [[monoid]]<!-- semigroup -->.   The embedding of the rationals then gives a way of speaking about the rationals, integers, and natural numbers in ''K''.  The following are equivalent characterizations of Archimedean fields in terms of these substructures.<ref name=\"Schechter\">{{harvnb|Schechter|1997|loc=§10.3}}</ref>\n\n1.  The natural numbers are [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in ''K''.  That is, every element of ''K'' is less than some natural number.  (This is not the case when there exist infinite elements.)  Thus an Archimedean field is one whose natural numbers grow without bound.\n\n2.  Zero is the [[infimum]] in ''K'' of the set {1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... }.  (If ''K'' contained a positive infinitesimal it would be a lower bound for the set whence zero would not be the greatest lower bound.)\n\n3.  The set of elements of ''K'' between the positive and negative rationals is non-open. This is because the set consists of all the infinitesimals, which is just the set {0} when there are no nonzero infinitesimals, and otherwise is open, there being neither a least nor greatest nonzero infinitesimal. Observe that in both cases, the set of infinitesimals is closed. In the latter case, (i) every infinitesimal is less than every positive rational, (ii) there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, and (iii) there is nothing else in between. Consequently, any non-Archimedean ordered field is both incomplete and disconnected.\n\n4.  For any <var>x</var> in ''K'' the set of integers greater than <var>x</var> has a least element.  (If <var>x</var> were a negative infinite quantity every integer would be greater than it.)\n\n5.  Every nonempty open interval of ''K'' contains a rational.  (If <var>x</var> is a positive infinitesimal, the open interval {{open-open|<var>x</var>, 2<var>x</var>}} contains infinitely many infinitesimals but not a single rational.)\n\n6.  The rationals are [[Dense set|dense]] in ''K'' with respect to both sup and inf.  (That is, every element of ''K'' is the sup of some set of rationals, and the inf of some other set of rationals.)  Thus an Archimedean field is any dense ordered extension of the rationals, in the sense of any ordered field that densely embeds its rational elements.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Schechter|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Schechter|title=Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations|publisher=Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=0-12-622760-8|url=http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/ccc/|ref=harv|postscript=.}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[0.999...#Infinitesimals]]\n\n[[Category:Field theory]]\n[[Category:Ordered groups]]\n[[Category:Real algebraic geometry]]"

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''cyclically ordered group''' is a set with both a [[group (mathematics)|group structure]] and a [[cyclic order]], such that left and right multiplication both preserve the cyclic order.\n\nCyclically ordered groups were first studied in depth by [[Ladislav Rieger]] in 1947.{{sfn|Pecinová-Kozáková|2005|p=194}} They are a generalization of [[cyclic group]]s: the [[infinite cyclic group]] {{math|'''Z'''}} and the [[finite cyclic group]]s {{math|'''Z'''/''n''}}. Since a linear order induces a cyclic order, cyclically ordered groups are also a generalization of [[linearly ordered group]]s: the [[rational number]]s {{math|'''Q'''}}, the real numbers {{math|'''R'''}}, and so on. Some of the most important cyclically ordered groups fall into neither previous category: the [[circle group]] {{math|'''T'''}} and its subgroups, such as the [[group of rational points on the unit circle|subgroup of rational points]].\n\n==Quotients of linear groups==\nIt is natural to depict cyclically ordered groups as quotients: one has {{math|1='''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} and {{math|1='''T''' = '''R'''/'''Z'''}}. Even a once-linear group like {{math|'''Z'''}}, when bent into a circle, can be thought of as {{math|'''Z'''<sup>2</sup> / '''Z'''}}. {{Harvs|last=Rieger|year=1946|year2=1947|year3=1948|txt}} showed that this picture is a generic phenomenon. For any ordered group {{mvar|L}} and any [[Center (group theory)|central]] element {{mvar|z}} that generates a [[cofinal subgroup]] {{mvar|Z}} of {{mvar|L}}, the quotient group {{math|''L'' / ''Z''}} is a cyclically ordered group.

In particular, if {{math|'''T'''}} is the circle group and {{mvar|L}} is an ordered group, then any subgroup of {{math|'''T''' × ''L''}} is a cyclically ordered group.

      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\nIn [[mathematics]], in particular in [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] and [[Real algebraic geometry|real algebra]], a '''formally real field''' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] that can be equipped with a (not necessarily unique) ordering that makes it an [[ordered field]].\n\n==Alternative Definitions==\nThe definition given above is not a [[first-order logic|first-order]] definition, as it requires quantifiers over sets. However, the following criteria can be coded as (infinitely many) first-order sentences in the language of fields and are equivalent to the above definition. \n\nA formally real field ''F'' is a field that also satisfies one of the following equivalent properties:<ref>Rajwade, Theorem 15.1.</ref><ref>Milnor and Husemoller (1973) p.60</ref>\n\n* &minus;1 is not a sum of [[Square number|square]]s in ''F''.  In other words, the [[Stufe (algebra)|Stufe]] of ''F'' is infinite. (In particular, such a field must have [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0, since in a field of characteristic ''p'' the element &minus;1 is a sum of 1's.)  This can be expressed in first-order logic by <math>\\forall x_1 (-1 \\ne x_1^2)</math>, <math>\\forall x_1 x_2 (-1 \\ne x_1^2 + x_2^2)</math>, etc., one sentence for each number of variables.\n* There exists an element of ''F'' that is not a sum of squares in ''F'', and the characteristic of ''F'' is not 2.\n* If any sum of squares of elements of ''F'' equals zero, then each of those elements must be zero.\n\nIt is easy to see that these three properties are equivalent. It is also easy to see that a field that admits an ordering must satisfy these three properties.\n\nA proof that if ''F'' satisfies these three properties, then ''F'' admits an ordering uses the notion of [[Ordered_field#Def_2:_A_positive_cone_of_F|prepositive cones]] and positive cones. Suppose &minus;1 is not a sum of squares, then a [[Zorn's Lemma]] argument shows that the prepositive cone of sums of squares can be extended to a positive cone {{nowrap|''P'' ⊂ ''F''}}. One uses this positive cone to define an ordering: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''b'' &minus; ''a''}} belongs to ''P''.\n\n==Real Closed Fields==\n\nA formally real field with no formally real proper algebraic extension is a [[real closed field]].<ref name=R216>Rajwade (1993) p.216</ref>  If ''K'' is formally real and Ω is an algebraically closed field containing ''K'', then there is a real closed subfield of Ω containing ''K''.  A real closed field can be ordered in a unique way,<ref name=R216/> and the non-negative elements are exactly the squares.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | first1=John | last1=Milnor | authorlink=John Milnor | first2=Dale | last2=Husemoller | authorlink2=Dale Husemoller | title=Symmetric bilinear forms | publisher=Springer | year=1973 | isbn=3-540-06009-X }}\n* {{cite book | title=Squares | volume=171 | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | first=A.

See e.g. [http://www.nongnu.org/isarmathlib/IsarMathLib/document.pdf IsarMathLib], p. 344.}}\n\nElements of a linearly ordered group satisfy [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]]: every element ''a'' of a linearly ordered group ''G'' is either positive (''a''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G''<sub>+</sub>), negative (''−a''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G''<sub>+</sub>), or zero (''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0). If a linearly ordered group ''G'' is not trivial (i.e. 0 is not its only element), then ''G''<sub>+</sub> is infinite, since all multiples of a non-zero element are distinct.{{efn|Formally, given any non-zero element ''c'' (which we can assume to be positive, otherwise take ''−c'') and natural number ''k'' we have <math>kc < (k+1)c</math>, so by induction, given two natural numbers ''k'' < ''l'', we have <math>kc < lc</math>, so there is an injection from the natural numbers into ''G''.}} Therefore, every nontrivial linearly ordered group is infinite.\n\nIf ''a'' is an element of a linearly ordered group ''G'', then the [[absolute value]] of ''a'', denoted by |''a''|, is defined to be:\n\n:<math>|a|:=\\begin{cases}a, & \\text{if }a \\ge 0,\\\\ -a, & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf in addition the group ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]], then for any ''a'',&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''G'' the [[triangle inequality]] is satisfied: |''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''| ≤&nbsp;|''a''|&nbsp;+&nbsp;|''b''|.\n\n==Examples==\n\nAny totally ordered group is [[Torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]]. Conversely, [[F. W. Levi]] showed that an [[abelian group]] admits a linear order if and only if it is torsion free {{harv|Levi|1942}}.\n\n[[Otto Hölder]] showed that every [[Archimedean group]] (a bi-ordered group satisfying an [[Archimedean property]]) is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a subgroup of the additive group of [[real number]]s, {{harv|Fuchs|Salce|2001|p=61}}.\nIf we write the Archimedean l.o. group multiplicatively, this may be shown by considering the Dedekind completion, <math>\\widehat{G}</math> of the closure of an  l.o. group under <math>n</math>th roots. We endow this space with the usual topology of a linear order, and then it can be shown that for each <math>g\\in\\widehat{G}</math> the exponential maps <math>g^{\\cdot}:(\\mathbb{R},+)\\to(\\widehat{G},\\cdot) :\\lim_{i}q_{i}\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\mapsto \\lim_{i}g^{q_{i}}</math> are well defined order preserving/reversing, topological group isomorphisms. Completing an l.o. group can be difficult in the non-Archimedean case. In these cases, one may classify a group by its rank: which is related to the order type of the largest sequence of convex subgroups.\n\nA large source of examples of left-orderable groups comes from groups acting on the real line by order preserving homeomorphisms. Actually, for countable groups, this is known to be a characterization of left-orderability, see for instance {{harv|Ghys|2001}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cyclically ordered group]]\n*[[Hahn embedding theorem]]\n*[[Partially ordered group]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Levi | first1=F.W. | title=Ordered groups. | journal=Proc.

The two axioms imply that [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s and [[positive homothety|positive homotheties]] are automorphisms of the order structure and the mapping {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ &minus;''x''}} is an isomorphism to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual order structure]]. Ordered vector spaces are [[ordered group]]s under their addition operation.\n\n==Positive cone==\n\nGiven a preordered vector space ''V'', the subset ''V''<sup>+</sup> of all elements ''x'' in ''V'' satisfying ''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0 is a [[convex cone]], called the '''positive cone''' of ''V''. If ''V'' is an ordered vector space,  then ''V''<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;(&minus;''V''<sup>+</sup>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;{0}, and hence ''V''<sup>+</sup> is a [[proper cone]]. \n\nIf ''V'' is a real vector space and ''C'' is a proper convex cone in ''V'', there exists a unique partial order on ''V'' that makes ''V'' into an ordered vector space such  ''V''<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''C''. This partial order is given by \n: ''x''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''y'' if and only if ''y''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x'' is in ''C''.\nTherefore, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the partial orders on a vector space ''V'' that are compatible with the vector space structure and the proper convex cones of ''V''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* The [[real number]]s with the usual order is an ordered vector space. \n* '''R'''<sup>2</sup> is an ordered vector space with the &le; relation defined in any of the following ways (in order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs):\n**[[Lexicographical order]]: {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' < ''c''}} or ({{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''d''}}). This is a [[total order]]. The positive cone is given by {{nowrap|''x'' > 0}} or ({{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ 0}}), i.e., in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the set of points with  the angular coordinate satisfying {{nowrap|−π/2 < ''θ'' ≤ π/2}}, together with the origin.\n**{{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''d''}} (the [[product order]] of two copies of '''R''' with \"≤\").

This is also a partial order. The positive cone is given by ({{nowrap|''x'' > 0}} and {{nowrap|''y'' > 0}}) or ({{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y'' = 0}}), i.e., in polar coordinates, {{nowrap|0 < ''θ'' < π/2}}, together with the origin.\n:Only the second order is, as a subset of '''R'''<sup>4</sup>, closed, see [[Partially ordered set#Partial orders in topological spaces|partial orders in topological spaces]].\n:For the third order the two-dimensional \"[[Partially ordered set#Interval|intervals]]\" {{nowrap|''p'' < ''x'' < ''q''}} are open sets which generate the topology.\n* '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is an ordered vector space with the &le; relation defined similarly.

      "text": "{{redirect|Vector lattice|the concept of <u>lattice vector</u>|Bravais lattice}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Riesz space''', '''lattice-ordered vector space''' or '''vector lattice''' is a [[ordered vector space|partially ordered vector space]] where the [[order structure]] is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].\n\nRiesz spaces are named after [[Frigyes Riesz]] who first defined them in his 1928 paper ''Sur la décomposition des opérations fonctionelles linéaires''.\n\nRiesz spaces have wide ranging applications. They are important in [[measure theory]], in that important results are special cases of results for Riesz Spaces. E.g. the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]] follows as a special case of the [[Freudenthal spectral theorem]]. Riesz spaces have also seen application in [[mathematical economics]] through the work of Greek-American economist and mathematician [[Charalambos D. Aliprantis]].\n\n== Definition ==\nA Riesz space is defined to be an [[ordered vector space]]\nfor which the ordering is a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]].\n\nMore explicitly, a Riesz space {{mvar|E}} can be defined to be a vector space endowed with a [[partial order]], {{math|≤}}, that for any {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} in {{mvar|E}}, satisfies:\n# [[translation invariance|Translation Invariance]]: {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} implies {{math|''x'' + ''z'' ≤ ''y'' + ''z''}}.\n# [[Homogeneous function#Positive homogeneity|Positive Homogeneity]]: For any scalar {{math|0 ≤ ''α''}}, {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} implies {{math|''αx'' ≤ ''αy''}}.\n# For any pair of vectors {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in {{mvar|E}} there exists a [[supremum]] (denoted {{math|''x'' ∨ ''y''}}) in {{mvar|E}} with respect to the partial order  {{math|(≤)}}.\n\nThe partial order, together with items 1 and 2, which make it \"compatible with the vector space structure\", make {{mvar|E}}  an ordered vector space.  Item 3 says that the partial order is a [[join semilattice]].  Because the order is compatible with the vector space structure, one can show that any pair also have an [[infimum]], making {{mvar|E}} also a [[meet semilattice]], hence a lattice.\n\n== Basic properties ==\nEvery Riesz space is a [[ordered vector space|partially ordered vector space]], but not every partially ordered vector space is a Riesz space.\n\nEvery element {{mvar|f}} in a Riesz space, {{mvar|E}}, has unique [[positive and negative parts]], written {{math|''f''<sup>&nbsp;±</sup> {{=}} ±''f''&thinsp; ∨ 0}}. Then it can be shown that, {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup> − ''f''<sup>&nbsp;−</sup>}} and an absolute value can be defined by {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;{{!}} {{=}} ''f''<sup>&nbsp;+</sup> + ''f''<sup>&nbsp;−</sup>}}. Every Riesz space is a [[distributive lattice]] and has the [[Approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra#The Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem|Riesz decomposition property]].\n\n== Order convergence ==\nThere are a number of meaningful non-equivalent ways to define convergence of sequences or nets with respect to the order structure of a Riesz space. A sequence {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }}in a Riesz space {{mvar|E}} is said to '''converge monotonely''' if it is a [[monotone sequence|monotone]] decreasing (resp. increasing) sequence and its [[infimum]] (supremum) {{mvar|x}} exists in {{mvar|E}} and denoted {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>'' ↓ ''x''}}, (resp. {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>'' ↑ ''x''}}).\n\nA sequence {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }}in a Riesz space {{mvar|E}} is said to '''converge in order''' to {{mvar|x}} if there exists a monotone converging sequence {{math|{''p<sub>n</sub>''} }}in {{mvar|E}} such that {{math|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' − ''x''{{!}} < ''p<sub>n</sub>'' ↓ 0}}.\n\nIf {{mvar|u}} is a positive element a Riesz space {{mvar|E}} then a sequence {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }}in {{mvar|E}} is said to '''converge u-uniformly''' to {{mvar|x}} if for any {{math|''ε'' > 0}} there exists an {{mvar|N}} such that {{math|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' − ''x''{{!}} < ''εu''}} for all {{math|''n'' > ''N''}}.\n\n== Subspaces ==\nThe extra structure provided by these spaces provide for distinct kinds of Riesz subspaces. The collection of each kind structure in a Riesz space (e.g. the collection of all ideals) forms a [[distributive lattice]].\n\n=== Ideals ===\nA vector subspace {{mvar|I}} of a Riesz space {{mvar|E}} is called an ''ideal'' if it is ''solid'', meaning if for {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp; ∈ ''I''}} and {{math|''g'' ∈ ''E''}}, we have: {{math|{{!}}''g''{{!}} ≤ {{!}}&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;{{!}}}} implies that {{math|''g'' ∈ ''I''}}. The intersection of an arbitrary collection of ideals is again an ideal, which allows for the definition of a smallest ideal containing some non-empty subset {{mvar|A}} of {{mvar|E}}, and is called the ideal ''generated'' by {{mvar|A}}. An Ideal generated by a singleton is called a '''principal ideal'''.\n\n=== Bands and {{mvar|σ}}-Ideals ===\nA ''band'' {{mvar|B}} in a Riesz space {{mvar|E}} is defined to be an ideal with the extra property, that for any element {{mvar|f}} in {{mvar|E}} for which its absolute value {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;{{!}}}} is the supremum of an arbitrary subset of positive elements in {{mvar|B}}, that {{mvar|f}} is actually in {{mvar|B}}. {{mvar|σ}}-''Ideals'' are defined similarly, with the words 'arbitrary subset' replaced with 'countable subset'. Clearly every band is a {{mvar|σ}}-ideal, but the converse is not true in general.\n\nAs with ideals, for every non-empty subset {{mvar|A}} of {{mvar|E}}, there exists a smallest band containing that subset, called ''the band generated by'' {{mvar|A}}. A band generated by a singleton is called a '''principal band'''.\n\n=== Disjoint complements ===\nTwo elements {{math|&thinsp;''f'', ''g''}} in a Riesz space {{mvar|E}}, are said to be '''disjoint''', written {{math|&thinsp;''f'' ⊥ ''g''}}, when {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;{{!}} ∧ {{!}}''g''{{!}} {{=}} 0.}} For any subset {{mvar|A}} of {{mvar|E}}, its disjoint complement {{math|''A<sup>d</sup>''}} is defined as the set of all elements in {{mvar|E}}, that are disjoint to all elements in {{mvar|A}}. Disjoint complements are always bands, but the converse is not true in general.\n\n=== Projection bands ===\nA band {{mvar|B}} in a Riesz space, is called a ''projection band'', if {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''B'' ⊕ ''B<sup>d</sup>''}}, meaning every element {{mvar|f}} in {{mvar|E}}, can be written uniquely as a sum of two elements, {{math|&thinsp;''f'' {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}}, with {{mvar|u}} in {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|v}} in {{math|''B<sup>d</sup>''}}. There then also exists a positive linear idempotent, or ''projection'', {{math|''P<sub>B</sub>'' : ''E'' → ''E''}}, such that {{math|''P<sub>B</sub>''(&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;) {{=}} ''u''}}.\n\nThe collection of all projection bands in a Riesz space forms a [[Boolean algebra]]. Some spaces do not have non-trivial projection bands (e.g. {{math|''C''([0, 1])}}), so this Boolean algebra may be trivial.\n\n== Projection properties ==\nThere are numerous projection properties that Riesz spaces may have. A Riesz space is said to have the (principal) projection property if every (principal) band is a projection band.\n\nThe so-called '''main inclusion theorem''' relates the following additional properties to the (principal) projection property:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luxemburg|first1=W.A.J.|last2=Zaanen|first2=A.C.|title=Riesz Spaces : Vol. 1.|date=1971|publisher=North Holland|location=London|isbn=0720424518|pages=122-138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR4WhI7u7N4C&ots=NlWS2y0VOd&ved=0ahUKEwjC5uzaq8fYAhWLx4MKHXo5A6YQ6AEIMTAC|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> A Riesz space is&hellip;\n* [[Dedekind-complete|Dedekind Complete (DC)]] if every nonempty set, bounded above, has a [[supremum]];\n* Super Dedekind Complete (SDC) if every nonempty set, bounded above, has a countable subset with identical supremum;\n* Dedekind {{mvar|σ}}-complete if every countable nonempty set, bounded above, has a supremum; and\n* [[Archimedean property]] if, for every pair of positive elements {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, there exists an integer {{mvar|n}} such that {{math|''nx'' ≥ ''y''}}.  \nThen these properties are related as follows.  SDC implies DC; DC implies both Dedekind {{mvar|σ}}-completeness and the projection property; Both Dedekind σ-completeness and the projection property separately imply the principal projection property; and the principal projection property implies the [[Archimedean property]].\n\nNone of the reverse implications hold, but Dedekind {{mvar|σ}}-completeness and the projection property together imply DC.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The space of continuous real valued functions with [[compact support]] on a topological space {{mvar|X}} with the [[pointwise]] [[partial order]] defined by {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp; ≤ ''g''}} when {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'')}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}, is a Riesz space.

      "text": "In 1936, [[Alfred Tarski]] set out an [[axiomatization]] of the [[real number]]s and their arithmetic, consisting of only  the 8 [[axiom]]s shown below and a mere four [[primitive notion]]s:<ref name=tarski>{{cite book|last1=Tarski|first1=Alfred|title=Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences|date=24 March 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504472-0|edition=4}}</ref> the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of reals denoted '''R''', a [[binary relation|binary]] [[total order]] over '''R''', denoted by [[infix]] <, a [[binary operation]] of addition over '''R''', denoted by infix +, and the constant 1.\n\nThe literature occasionally mentions this axiomatization but never goes into detail, notwithstanding its economy and elegant [[Metamathematics|metamathematical]] properties. This axiomatization appears little known, possibly because of its [[second-order logic|second-order]] nature. Tarski's axiomatization can be seen as a version of the more usual [[real number#Definition|definition of real numbers]] as the unique [[Dedekind-complete]] [[ordered field]]; it is however made much more concise by using unorthodox variants of standard algebraic axioms and other subtle tricks (see e.g. axioms 4 and 5, which combine together the usual four axioms of [[abelian group]]s).\n\nThe term \"Tarski's axiomatization of real numbers\" also refers to the theory of [[real closed field]]s, which Tarski showed completely axiomatizes the [[first-order logic|first-order]] theory of the structure 〈'''R''', +, ·, <〉.\n\n==The axioms==\n''Axioms of order'' (primitives: '''R''', <):\n\n;Axiom 1 :If ''x'' < ''y'', then not ''y'' < ''x''. That is, \"<\" is an [[asymmetric relation]].\n\n;Axiom 2 :If ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''z'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''z''. In other words, \"<\" is [[dense order|dense]] in '''R'''.\n\n;Axiom 3 :\"<\" is [[Dedekind-complete]]. More formally, for all ''X'',&nbsp;''Y''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;'''R''', if for all ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'', then there exists a ''z'' such that for all ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''Y'', if ''z''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''x'' and ''z''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''y'', then ''x''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''y''.\n\nTo clarify the above statement somewhat, let ''X''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;'''R''' and ''Y''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;'''R'''. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose:\n\n:''X precedes Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''X'' and every ''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y''.\n\n:The real number ''z separates'' ''X'' and ''Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''X'' with ''x''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;''z'' and every ''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''Y'' with ''y''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;''z'', ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y''.\n\nAxiom 3 can then be stated as:\n\n:\"If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets.\"\n\n''Axioms of addition'' (primitives: '''R''', <, +):\n\n;Axiom 4 :''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''.\n\n;Axiom 5 :For all ''x'', ''y'', there exists a ''z'' such that ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''.\n\n;Axiom 6 :If ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''w'', then ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''z'' or ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''w''.\n\n''Axioms for one'' (primitives: '''R''', <, +, 1):\n\n;Axiom 7 :1&nbsp;∈&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\n;Axiom 8 :1&nbsp;<&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nThese axioms imply that '''R''' is a [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered]] [[abelian group]] under addition with distinguished element 1. '''R''' is also [[Dedekind-complete]] and [[divisible group|divisible]].\n\nTarski stated, without proof, that these axioms gave a total ordering. The missing component was supplied in 2008 by Stefanie Ucsnay.<ref name=total-order>{{cite journal|last1=Ucsnay|first1=Stefanie|title=A Note on Tarski's Note|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=Jan 2008|volume=115|issue=1|pages=66–68|jstor=27642393}}</ref>\n\nThis axiomatization does not give rise to a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]], because the formal statement of axiom 3 includes two [[universal quantifier]]s over all possible subsets of '''R'''. Tarski proved these 8 axioms and 4 primitive notions independent.\n\n==How these axioms imply a field==\nTarski sketched the (nontrivial) proof of how these axioms and primitives imply the existence of a [[binary operation]] called multiplication and having the expected properties, so that '''R''' is a complete [[ordered field]] under addition and multiplication. This proof builds crucially on the integers with addition being an abelian group and has its origins in [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus']] definition of magnitude.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Real numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Real numbers]]\n[[Category:Ordered groups]]\n[[Category:Mathematical axioms]]\n[[Category:Formal theories of arithmetic]]"

      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], '''[[group theory]]''' studies the [[algebraic structure]]s known as [[group (mathematics)|groups]].  \nThe concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s and [[axiom]]s. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. [[Linear algebraic group]]s and [[Lie group]]s are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.\n\nVarious physical systems, such as [[crystal]]s and the [[hydrogen atom]], may be modelled by [[symmetry group]]s. Thus group theory and the closely related [[representation theory]] have many important applications in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[materials science]].

The set <math>E\\ </math> represents equations like: \n::<math>x_1^2g_1^4x_3=1</math>\n::<math>x_3^2g_2x_4g_1=1</math>\n::<math>\\dots\\ </math>\nThe set <math>I\\ </math> represents inequations like\n::<math>g_5^{-1}x_3\\ne 1</math>\n::<math>\\dots\\ </math>\n\nBy a '''solution''' in  <math>G\\ </math> to this finite set of equations and inequations, we mean a homomorphism <math>f:F\\rightarrow G</math>, such that <math>\\tilde{f}(e)=1\\ </math> for all <math>e\\in E</math> and <math>\\tilde{f}(i)\\ne 1\\ </math> for all <math>i\\in I</math>, where <math>\\tilde{f}</math> is the unique homomorphism <math>\\tilde{f}:F\\star G\\rightarrow G</math> that equals <math>f\\ </math> on <math>F\\ </math> and is the identity on <math>G\\ </math>.\n\nThis formalizes the idea of substituting elements of <math>G\\ </math> for the variables to get true identities and inidentities. In the example the substitutions <math>x_1\\mapsto g_6, x_3\\mapsto g_7</math> and <math>x_4\\mapsto g_8</math> yield:\n::<math>g_6^2g_1^4g_7=1</math>\n::<math>g_7^2g_2g_8g_1=1</math>\n::<math>\\dots\\ </math>\n::<math>g_5^{-1}g_7\\ne 1</math>\n::<math>\\dots\\ </math>\n\nWe say the finite set of equations and inequations is '''consistent with''' <math>G\\ </math> if we can solve them in a \"bigger\" group <math>H\\ </math>. More formally:\n\nThe equations and inequations are consistent with <math>G\\ </math> if there is a group<math>H\\ </math> and an embedding <math>h:G\\rightarrow H</math> such that the finite set of  equations and inequations <math>\\tilde{h}(E)</math> and <math>\\tilde{h}(I)</math> has a solution in <math>H\\ </math>, where <math>\\tilde{h}</math> is the unique homomorphism <math>\\tilde{h}:F\\star G\\rightarrow F\\star H</math> that equals <math>h\\ </math> on <math>G\\ </math> and is the identity on <math>F\\ </math>.\n\nNow we formally define the group <math>A\\ </math> to be '''algebraically closed''' if every finite set of equations and inequations that has coefficients in <math>A\\ </math> and is consistent with <math>A\\ </math> has a solution in <math>A\\ </math>.\n\n==Known Results==\n\nIt is difficult to give concrete examples of algebraically closed groups as the following results indicate:\n\n* Every [[countable]] group can be embedded in a countable algebraically closed group.\n* Every algebraically closed group is [[simple group|simple]].\n* No algebraically closed group is [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]].\n* An algebraically closed group cannot be [[presentation of a group|recursively presented]].\n* A finitely generated group has a [[Word problem for groups|solvable word problem]] if and only if it can be embedded in every algebraically closed group.\n\nThe proofs of these results are in general very complex. However, a sketch of the proof that a countable group <math>C\\ </math> can be embedded in an algebraically closed group follows.\n\nFirst we embed <math>C\\ </math> in a countable group <math>C_1\\ </math> with the property that every finite set of equations with coefficients in <math>C\\ </math> that is consistent in <math>C_1\\ </math> has a solution in <math>C_1\\ </math> as follows:\n\nThere are only countably many finite sets of equations and inequations with coefficients in <math>C\\ </math>. Fix an enumeration <math>S_0,S_1,S_2,\\dots\\ </math> of them. Define groups <math>D_0,D_1,D_2,\\dots\\ </math> inductively by:\n\n::<math>D_0 = C\\ </math>\n\n::<math>D_{i+1} = \n\\left\\{\\begin{matrix} \nD_i\\ &\\mbox{if}\\ S_i\\ \\mbox{is not consistent with}\\ D_i \\\\\n\\langle D_i,h_1,h_2,\\dots,h_n \\rangle &\\mbox{if}\\ S_i\\ \\mbox{has a solution in}\\ H\\supseteq D_i\\ \\mbox{with}\\ x_j\\mapsto h_j\\ 1\\le j\\le n\n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n</math>\n\nNow let:\n\n::<math>C_1=\\cup_{i=0}^{\\infty}D_{i}</math>\n\nNow iterate this construction to get a sequence of groups <math>C=C_0,C_1,C_2,\\dots\\ </math> and let:\n\n::<math>A=\\cup_{i=0}^{\\infty}C_{i}</math>\n\nThen <math>A\\ </math> is a countable group containing <math>C\\ </math>. It is algebraically closed because any finite set of equations and inequations that is consistent with <math>A\\ </math> must have coefficients in some <math>C_i\\ </math> and so must have a solution in <math>C_{i+1}\\ </math>.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Algebraic closure]]\n** [[Algebraically closed field]]\n\n==References==\n\n* A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is said to be '''almost simple''' if it contains a non-abelian [[simple group]] and is contained within the [[automorphism group]] of that simple group: if it fits between a (non-abelian) simple group and its automorphism group. In symbols, a group ''A'' is almost simple if there is a simple group ''S'' such that <math>S \\leq A \\leq \\operatorname{Aut}(S).</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n* Trivially, nonabelian simple groups and the full group of automorphisms are almost simple, but proper examples exist, meaning almost simple groups that are neither simple nor the full automorphism group.\n* For <math>n=5</math> or <math>n \\geq 7,</math> the [[symmetric group]] <math>S_n</math> is the automorphism group of the simple [[alternating group]] <math>A_n,</math> so <math>S_n</math> is almost simple in this trivial sense.\n* For <math>n=6</math> there is a proper example, as <math>S_6</math> sits properly between the simple <math>A_6</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(A_6),</math> due to the [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of <math>A_6.</math> Two other groups, the [[Mathieu group]] <math>M_{10}</math> and the [[projective general linear group]] <math>\\operatorname{PGL}_2(9)</math> also sit properly between <math>A_6</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(A_6).</math>\n\n== Properties ==\nThe full automorphism group of a nonabelian simple group is a [[complete group]] (the conjugation map is an isomorphism to the automorphism group), but proper subgroups of the full automorphism group need not be complete.\n\n== Structure ==\nBy the [[Schreier conjecture]], now generally accepted as a corollary of the [[classification of finite simple groups]], the outer automorphism group of a finite simple group is a [[solvable group]].
