It quantifies the expected value of the loss given that an event outside a given probability level has occurred.\n\n==Background==\n\nThere are a number of related, but subtly different, formulations for TVaR in the literature. A common case in literature is to define TVaR and [[average value at risk]] as the same measure.<ref name=Bar/>  Under some formulations, it is only equivalent to [[expected shortfall]] when the underlying [[cumulative distribution function|distribution function]] is [[continuous function|continuous]] at <math>\\operatorname{VaR}_{\\alpha}(X)</math>, the value at risk of level <math>\\alpha</math>.<ref name=web1/> Under some other settings, TVaR is the conditional expectation of loss above a given value, whereas the expected shortfall is the product of this value with the probability of it occurring.<ref name = \"Sweeting\"/> The former definition may not be a [[coherent risk measure]] in general, however it is coherent if the underlying distribution is continuous.<ref name=Acerbi/> The latter definition is a coherent risk measure.<ref name = \"Sweeting\" /> TVaR accounts for the severity of the failure, not only the chance of failure.  The TVaR is a measure of the [[Expected value|expectation]] only in the tail of the distribution.\n\n==Mathematical definition==\nThe canonical tail value at risk is the left-tail (large negative values) in some disciplines and the right-tail (large positive values) in other, such as [[actuarial science]]. This is usually due to the differing conventions of treating losses as large negative or positive values. Using the negative value convention, Artzner and others define the tail value at risk as:\n\nGiven a [[random variable]] <math>X</math> which is the payoff of a portfolio at some future time and given a parameter <math>0 < \\alpha < 1</math> then the tail value at risk is defined by<ref name=Artzner/><ref name=Landsman/><ref name=Landsman2/><ref name=Valdez/>\n: <math>\\operatorname{TVaR}_{\\alpha}(X) = \\operatorname{E} [-X|X \\leq -\\operatorname{VaR}_{\\alpha}(X)] =  \\operatorname{E} [-X | X \\leq x^{\\alpha}] ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>x^{\\alpha}</math> is the upper <math>\\alpha</math>-[[quantile]] given by <math>x^{\\alpha} = \\inf\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\Pr(X \\leq x) > \\alpha\\}</math>. Typically the payoff random variable <math>X</math> is in some [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup>-space]] where <math>p \\geq 1</math> to guarantee the existence of the expectation. The typical values for <math>\\alpha</math> are 5% and 1%.\n\n== Formulas for continuous probability distributions ==\n\nClosed-form formulas exist for calculating TVaR when the payoff of a portfolio <math>X</math> or a corresponding loss <math>L = -X</math> follows a specific continuous distribution. If <math>X</math> follows some probability distribution with the [[probability density function]] (p.d.f.) <math>f</math> and the [[cumulative distribution function]] (c.d.f.) <math>F</math>, the left-tail TVaR can be represented as\n\n<math>\\operatorname{TVaR}_{\\alpha}(X) = \\operatorname{E} [-X|X \\leq -\\operatorname{VaR}_{\\alpha}(X)] = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\int_0^\\alpha \\operatorname{VaR}_\\gamma(X)d\\gamma = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\int_{-\\infty}^{F^{-1}(\\alpha)}xf(x)dx.</math>\n\nFor engineering or actuarial applications it is more common to consider the distribution of losses <math>L=-X</math>, in this case the right-tail TVaR is considered (typically for <math>\\alpha</math> 95% or 99%):\n\n<math>\\operatorname{TVaR}^\\text{right}_\\alpha(L) = E[L\\mid L \\geq VaR_{\\alpha}(L)] = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\int^1_\\alpha VaR_\\gamma(L)d\\gamma = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\int^{+\\infty}_{F^{-1}(\\alpha)}yf(y)dy</math>.\n\nSince some formulas below were derived for the left-tail case and some for the right-tail case, the following reconciliations can be useful:\n\n<math>\\operatorname{TVaR}_{\\alpha}(X) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}E[X]+\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\operatorname{TVaR}^\\text{right}_\\alpha(L)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{TVaR}^\\text{right}_\\alpha(L) = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}E[L]+\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\operatorname{TVaR}_{\\alpha}(X)</math>.\n\n===== Normal distribution =====\nIf the payoff of a portfolio <math>X</math> follows [[Normal distribution|normal (Gaussian) distribution]] with the p.d.f. <math>f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}</math> then the left-tail TVaR is equal to <math>\\operatorname{TVaR}_{\\alpha}(X) = -\\mu+\\sigma\\frac{\\phi(\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha))}{\\alpha}</math>, where <math>\\phi(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}</math> is the standard normal p.d.f., <math>\\Phi(x)</math> is the standard normal c.d.f., so <math>\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)</math> is the standard normal quantile.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Khokhlov|first=Valentyn|date=2016|title=Conditional Value-at-Risk for Elliptical Distributions|url=|journal=Evropský časopis Ekonomiky a Managementu|volume=2|issue=6|pages=70–79|via=}}</ref>\n\nIf the loss of a portfolio <math>L</math> follows normal distribution, the right-tail TVaR is equal to <math>\\operatorname{TVaR}^\\text{right}_\\alpha(L) = \\mu+\\sigma\\frac{\\phi(\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha))}{1-\\alpha}</math>.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite arxiv|last=Norton|first=Matthew|last2=Khokhlov|first2=Valentyn|last3=Uryasev|first3=Stan|date=2018-11-27|title=Calculating CVaR and bPOE for Common Probability Distributions With Application to Portfolio Optimization and Density Estimation|eprint=1811.11301|class=q-fin.RM}}</ref>\n\n===== Generalized Student's t-distribution =====\nIf the payoff of a portfolio <math>X</math> follows generalized [[Student's t-distribution]] with the p.d.f. <math>f(x) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}\\bigr)}{\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\bigr)\\sqrt{\\pi\\nu}\\sigma}\\Bigl(1+\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\bigl(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\bigr)^2\\Bigr)^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}</math> then the left-tail TVaR is equal to <math>\\operatorname{TVaR}_{\\alpha}(X) = -\\mu+\\sigma\\frac{\\nu+(\\Tau^{-1}(\\alpha))^2}{\\nu-1}\\frac{\\tau(\\Tau^{-1}(\\alpha))}{\\alpha}</math>, where <math>\\tau(x)=\\frac{\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}\\bigr)}{\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\bigr)\\sqrt{\\pi\\nu}}\\Bigl(1+\\frac{x^2}{\\nu}\\Bigr)^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}</math> is the standard t-distribution p.d.f., <math>\\Tau(x)</math> is the standard t-distribution c.d.f., so <math>\\Tau^{-1}(\\alpha)</math> is the standard t-distribution quantile.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIf the loss of a portfolio <math>L</math> follows generalized Student's t-distribution, the right-tail TVaR is equal to <math>\\operatorname{TVaR}^\\text{right}_\\alpha(L) = \\mu+\\sigma\\frac{\\nu+(\\Tau^{-1}(\\alpha))^2}{\\nu-1}\\frac{\\tau(\\Tau^{-1}(\\alpha))}{1-\\alpha}</math>.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===== Laplace distribution =====\nIf the payoff of a portfolio <math>X</math> follows [[Laplace distribution]] with the p.d.f. <math>f(x) = \\frac{1}{2b}e^{-\\frac{|x-\\mu|}{b}}</math> and the c.d.f. <math>F(x) = \\begin{cases}1 -

It estimates how much a set of investments might lose (with a given probability), given normal market conditions, in a set time period such as a day. VaR is typically used by firms and regulators in the financial industry to gauge the amount of assets needed to cover possible losses.\n\nFor a given portfolio, time horizon, and [[probability]] ''p'', the ''p'' VaR can be defined informally as the maximum possible loss during that time after we exclude all worse outcomes whose combined probability is at most ''p''. This assumes [[Mark to market accounting|mark-to-market]] pricing, and no trading in the portfolio.<ref name=\"Jorion\">{{cite book|last=Jorion|first=Philippe|title=Value at Risk: The New Benchmark for Managing Financial Risk|edition=3rd|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-146495-6}}</ref>\n\nFor example, if a portfolio of stocks has a one-day 5% VaR of $1 million, that means that there is a 0.05 probability that the portfolio will fall in value by more than $1 million over a one-day period if there is no trading. Informally, a loss of $1 million or more on this portfolio is expected on 1 day out of 20 days (because of 5% probability). \n\nMore formally, ''p'' VaR is defined such that the probability of a loss greater than VaR is (at most) ''p'' while the probability of a loss less than VaR is (at least) ''1−p''. A loss which exceeds the VaR threshold is termed a \"VaR breach\".<ref name=\"Holton\">Holton, Glyn A. (2014). ''[http://value-at-risk.net Value-at-Risk: Theory and Practice]'' second edition, e-book.</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that, for a fixed ''p'', the ''p'' VaR does not assess the magnitude of loss when a VaR breach occurs and therefore is considered by some to be a questionable metric for risk management. For instance, assume someone makes a bet that flipping a coin seven times will not give seven heads. The terms are that they win $100 if this does not happen (with probability 127/128) and lose $12,700 if it does (with probability 1/128). That is, the possible loss amounts are $0 or $12,700. The 1% VaR is then $0, because the probability of any loss at all is 1/128 which is less than 1%. They are, however, exposed to a possible loss of $12,700 which can be expressed as the ''p'' VaR for any ''p <= 0.78%''.<ref name=\"Einhorn II\"/>\n\nVaR has four main uses in [[finance]]: [[risk management]], financial [[Comptroller|control]], [[Financial statements|financial reporting]] and computing [[capital requirement|regulatory capital]]. VaR is sometimes used in non-financial applications as well.<ref name=\"McNeil\">{{cite book|first1=Alexander|last1=McNeil|first2=Rüdiger|last2=Frey|first3=Paul|last3=Embrechts|title=Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts Techniques and Tools|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-691-12255-7}}</ref>  However, it is a [[#Criticism|controversial]] risk management tool.\n\nImportant related ideas are [[economic capital]], [[backtesting]], [[stress test (financial)|stress testing]], [[expected shortfall]], and [[tail conditional expectation]].<ref name=\"Dowd\">{{cite book|last=Dowd|first=Kevin|title=Measuring Market Risk|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-01303-8}}</ref>\n\n== Details ==\n\nCommon parameters for VaR are 1% and 5% probabilities and one day and two week horizons, although other combinations are in use.<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite book|first=Neil|last=Pearson|title=Risk Budgeting: Portfolio Problem Solving with Value-at-Risk|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0-471-40556-6}}</ref>\n\nThe reason for assuming normal markets and no trading, and to restricting loss to things measured in [[financial statements|daily accounts]], is to make the loss [[Observability|observable]]. In some extreme financial events it can be impossible to determine losses, either because market prices are unavailable or because the loss-bearing institution breaks up. Some longer-term consequences of disasters, such as lawsuits, loss of market confidence and employee morale and impairment of brand names can take a long time to play out, and may be hard to allocate among specific prior decisions. VaR marks the boundary between normal days and extreme events. Institutions can lose far more than the VaR amount; all that can be said is that they will not do so very often.<ref name=\"Unbearable\" />\n\nThe probability level is about equally often specified as one minus the probability of a VaR break, so that the VaR in the example above would be called a one-day 95% VaR instead of one-day 5% VaR. This generally does not lead to confusion because the probability of VaR breaks is almost always small, certainly less than 50%.<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\nAlthough it virtually always represents a loss, VaR is conventionally reported as a positive number. A negative VaR would imply the portfolio has a high probability of making a profit, for example a one-day 5% VaR of negative $1 million implies the portfolio has a 95% chance of making more than $1 million over the next day.<ref name=\"Crouhy\">{{cite book|first1=Michel|last1=Crouhy|first2=Dan|last2=Galai|first3=Robert|last3=Mark|title=The Essentials of Risk Management|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2001|isbn=978-0-07-142966-5}}</ref>\n\nAnother inconsistency is that VaR is sometimes taken to refer to profit-and-loss at the end of the period, and sometimes as the maximum loss at any point during the period. The original definition was the latter, but in the early 1990s when VaR was aggregated across trading desks and time zones, end-of-day valuation was the only reliable number so the former became the ''de facto'' definition. As people began using multiday VaRs in the second half of the 1990s, they almost always estimated the distribution at the end of the period only. It is also easier theoretically to deal with a point-in-time estimate versus a maximum over an interval. Therefore, the end-of-period definition is the most common both in theory and practice today.<ref name=\"Lopez\">{{cite journal|author=Jose A.

The system is run periodically (usually daily) and the published number is compared to the computed price movement in opening positions over the time horizon. There is never any subsequent adjustment to the published VaR, and there is no distinction between VaR breaks caused by input errors (including [[Information Technology]] breakdowns, [[fraud]] and [[rogue trader|rogue trading]]), computation errors (including failure to produce a VaR on time) and market movements.<ref name=\"Wilmott\">{{cite book|first1=Paul|last1=Wilmott|author1-link=Paul Wilmott|title=Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance|publisher=Wiley|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-31958-1}}</ref>\n\nA [[Frequency probability|frequentist]] claim is made, that the long-term frequency of VaR breaks will equal the specified probability, within the limits of sampling error, and that the VaR breaks will be [[Statistical independence|independent]] in time and [[Statistical independence|independent]] of the level of VaR. This claim is validated by a [[backtesting|backtest]], a comparison of published VaRs to actual price movements. In this interpretation, many different systems could produce VaRs with equally good [[backtesting|backtests]], but wide disagreements on daily VaR values.<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\nFor risk measurement a number is needed, not a system. A [[Bayesian probability]] claim is made, that given the information and beliefs at the time, the [[Bayesian probability|subjective probability]] of a VaR break was the specified level. VaR is adjusted after the fact to correct errors in inputs and computation, but not to incorporate information unavailable at the time of computation.<ref name=\"Crouhy\" /> In this context, \"[[backtesting|backtest]]\" has a different meaning. Rather than comparing published VaRs to actual market movements over the period of time the system has been in operation, VaR is retroactively computed on scrubbed data over as long a period as data are available and deemed relevant. The same position data and pricing models are used for computing the VaR as determining the price movements.<ref name=\"Holton\" />\n\nAlthough some of the sources listed here treat only one kind of VaR as legitimate, most of the recent ones seem to agree that risk management VaR is superior for making short-term and tactical decisions today, while risk measurement VaR should be used for understanding the past, and making medium term and strategic decisions for the future. When VaR is used for [[Comptroller|financial control]] or [[Financial statements|financial reporting]] it should incorporate elements of both. For example, if a [[trader (finance)|trading desk]] is held to a VaR limit, that is both a risk-management rule for deciding what risks to allow today, and an input into the risk measurement computation of the [[trader (finance)|desk's]] risk-adjusted [[Return (finance)|return]] at the end of the reporting period.<ref name=\"Dowd\" />\n\n=== In governance ===\nVaR can also be applied to [[financial governance|governance]] of endowments, trusts, and pension plans. Essentially trustees adopt portfolio Values-at-Risk metrics for the entire pooled account and the diversified parts individually managed. Instead of probability estimates they simply define maximum levels of acceptable loss for each. Doing so provides an easy metric for oversight and adds accountability as managers are then directed to manage, but with the additional constraint to avoid losses within a defined risk parameter. VaR utilized in this manner adds relevance as well as an easy way to monitor risk measurement control far more intuitive than Standard Deviation of Return. Use of VaR in this context, as well as a worthwhile critique on board governance practices as it relates to investment management oversight in general can be found in ''Best Practices in Governance.''<ref>{{Citation|title=Best Practices in Governance|author=Lawrence York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\n\nThe VaR of <math>X</math> at the confidence level <math>\\alpha\\in(0,1)</math> is the smallest number <math>y</math> such that the probability that <math>Y:=-X</math> does not exceed <math>y</math> is at least <math>1-\\alpha</math>.

This sometimes leads to confusion. Sources earlier than 1995 usually emphasize the risk measure, later sources are more likely to emphasize the metric.\n\nThe VaR risk measure defines risk as [[Mark to market accounting|mark-to-market]] loss on a fixed portfolio over a fixed time horizon. There are many alternative risk measures in finance. Given the inability to use mark-to-market (which uses market prices to define loss) for future performance, loss is often defined (as a substitute) as change in [[Intrinsic value (finance)|fundamental value]]. For example, if an institution holds a [[loan]] that declines in market price because [[interest]] rates go up, but has no change in cash flows or credit quality, some systems do not recognize a loss. Also some try to incorporate the [[Economics|economic]] cost of harm not measured in daily [[financial statements]], such as loss of market confidence or employee morale, impairment of brand names or lawsuits.<ref name=\"Dowd\" />\n\nRather than assuming a static portfolio over a fixed time horizon, some risk measures incorporate the dynamic effect of expected trading (such as a [[Order (exchange)|stop loss order]]) and consider the expected holding period of positions.<ref name=\"Dowd\" />\n\nThe VaR risk metric summarizes the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of possible losses by a [[Quantile function|quantile]], a point with a specified probability of greater losses. A common alternative metrics is [[expected shortfall]].<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\n== VaR risk management ==\n\nSupporters of VaR-based risk management claim the first and possibly greatest benefit of VaR is the improvement in [[systems]] and modeling it forces on an institution.

Institutions that go through the process of computing their VAR are forced to confront their exposure to financial risks and to set up a proper risk management function. Thus the process of getting to VAR may be as important as the number itself.</blockquote>\n\nPublishing a daily number, on-time and with specified [[Statistics|statistical]] properties holds every part of a trading organization to a high objective standard. Robust backup systems and default assumptions must be implemented. Positions that are reported, modeled or priced incorrectly stand out, as do data feeds that are inaccurate or late and systems that are too-frequently down. Anything that affects profit and loss that is left out of other reports will show up either in inflated VaR or excessive VaR breaks. \"A risk-taking institution that ''does not'' compute VaR might escape disaster, but an institution that ''cannot'' compute VaR will not.\"<ref name=\"Einhorn I\">{{cite journal|author=[[Aaron Brown (financial author)|Aaron Brown]]|title=Private Profits and Socialized Risk|journal=GARP Risk Review|date=June–July 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe second claimed benefit of VaR is that it separates risk into two [[regime]]s. Inside the VaR limit, conventional [[statistical]] methods are reliable. Relatively short-term and specific data can be used for analysis. Probability estimates are meaningful, because there are enough data to test them. In a sense, there is no true risk because you have a sum of many [[Statistical independence|independent]] observations with a left bound on the outcome. A casino doesn't worry about whether red or black will come up on the next roulette spin. Risk managers encourage productive risk-taking in this regime, because there is little true cost. People tend to worry too much about these risks, because they happen frequently, and not enough about what might happen on the worst days.<ref name=\"Haug\" />\n\nOutside the VaR limit, all bets are off. Risk should be analyzed with [[stress testing]] based on long-term and broad market data.<ref name=\"Zask\">{{Citation|author=Ezra Zask|title=Taking the Stress Out of Stress Testing|publisher=Derivative Strategy|date=February 1999}}</ref> Probability statements are no longer meaningful.<ref name=\"Roundtable II\">{{cite journal|first1=Joe|last1=Kolman|first2=Michael|last2=Onak|first3=Philippe|last3=Jorion|first4=Nassim|last4=Taleb|first5=Emanuel|last5=Derman|first6=Blu|last6=Putnam|first7=Richard|last7=Sandor|first8=Stan|last8=Jonas|first9=Ron|last9=Dembo|first10=George|last10=Holt|first11=Richard|last11=Tanenbaum|first12=William|last12=Margrabe|first13=Dan|last13=Mudge|first14=James|last14=Lam|first15=Jim|last15=Rozsypal|title=Roundtable: The Limits of Models|journal=Derivatives Strategy|date=April 1998}}</ref> Knowing the distribution of losses beyond the VaR point is both impossible and useless. The risk manager should concentrate instead on making sure good plans are in place to limit the loss if possible, and to survive the loss if not.<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\nOne specific system uses three regimes.<ref name=\"Size\">{{cite journal|author=[[Aaron Brown (financial author)|Aaron Brown]]|title=On Stressing the Right Size|journal=GARP Risk Review|date=December 2007}}</ref>\n\n# One to three times VaR are normal occurrences. You expect periodic VaR breaks. The loss distribution typically has [[Kurtosis|fat tails]], and you might get more than one break in a short period of time. Moreover, markets may be abnormal and trading may exacerbate losses, and you may take losses not measured in daily [[financial statements|marks]] such as lawsuits, loss of employee morale and market confidence and impairment of brand names. So an institution that can't deal with three times VaR losses as routine events probably won't survive long enough to put a VaR system in place.\n# Three to ten times VaR is the range for [[stress testing]]. Institutions should be confident they have examined all the foreseeable events that will cause losses in this range, and are prepared to survive them. These events are too rare to estimate probabilities reliably, so risk/return calculations are useless.\n# Foreseeable events should not cause losses beyond ten times VaR. If they do they should be [[Hedge (finance)|hedged]] or insured, or the business plan should be changed to avoid them, or VaR should be increased. It's hard to run a business if foreseeable losses are orders of magnitude larger than very large everyday losses. It's hard to plan for these events, because they are out of scale with daily experience. Of course there will be unforeseeable losses more than ten times VaR, but it's pointless to anticipate them, you can't know much about them and it results in needless worrying. Better to hope that the discipline of preparing for all foreseeable three-to-ten times VaR losses will improve chances for surviving the unforeseen and larger losses that inevitably occur.\n\n\"A risk manager has two jobs: make people take more risk the 99% of the time it is safe to do so, and survive the other 1% of the time. VaR is the border.\"<ref name=\"Einhorn I\" />\n\nAnother reason VaR is useful as a metric is due to its ability to compress the riskiness of a portfolio to a single number, making it comparable across different portfolios (of different assets). Within any portfolio it is also possible to isolate specific position that might better hedge the portfolio to reduce, and minimise, the VaR. An example of market-maker employed strategies for trading linear interest rate derivatives and interest rate swaps portfolios is cited.<ref name=PHIRS>[http://www.tradinginterestrates.com The Pricing and Hedging of Interest Rate Derivatives: A Practical Guide to Swaps], J H M Darbyshire, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0995455511}}</ref>\n\n== Computation methods ==\n\nVaR can be estimated either parametrically (for example, [[variance]]-[[covariance]] VaR or [[Greeks (finance)#Delta|delta]]-[[Greeks (finance)#Gamma|gamma]] VaR) or nonparametrically (for examples, historical [[simulation]] VaR or [[Resampling (statistics)|resampled]] VaR).<ref name=\"Dowd\" /><ref name=\"Unbearable\" /> Nonparametric methods of VaR estimation are discussed in Markovich <ref name=\"Markovich\">{{Citation|last=Markovich|first=N.|title=Nonparametric analysis of univariate heavy-tailed data|publisher=Wiley|year=2007}}</ref> and Novak.<ref name=\"Novak\">{{cite book|last=Novak|first=S.Y.|title=Extreme value methods with applications to finance|publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-3574-6}}</ref> A comparison of a number of strategies for VaR prediction is given in Kuester et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kuester|first=Keith|last2=Mittnik|first2=Stefan|last3=Paolella|first3=Marc |author2-link=Stefan Mittnik |title=Value-at-Risk Prediction: A Comparison of Alternative Strategies |journal=Journal of Financial Econometrics |year=2006 |volume=4 |pages=53–89 |doi=10.1093/jjfinec/nbj002}}</ref>\n\nA McKinsey report<ref name=\"McKinsey\">{{cite web|title=McKinsey Working Papers on Risk, Number 32|author=McKinsey & Company|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/client_service/Risk/Working%20papers/Working_Papers_on_Risk_32.ashx|format=pdf}}</ref> published in May 2012 estimated that 85% of large banks were using [[historical simulation (finance)|historical simulation]].

E.g. a 5% probability of a loss greater than VaR should be observed over time when using a 95% VaR, these hits should occur independently.\n\nA number of other backtests are available which model the time between hits in the hit-sequence, see Christoffersen (2014),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christoffersen|first=Peter|date=2014|title=Backtesting Value-at-Risk: A Duration-Based Approach|url=|journal=Journal of Financial Econometrics|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Haas (2016),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haas|first=M.|date=2006|title=Improved duration-based backtesting of value-at-risk|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=8|pages=|via=}}</ref> Tokpavi et al.

Backtest toolboxes are available in Matlab [http://www.econ.ku.dk/pajhede/BackTestToolbox%20v1.0.zip], or [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/backtest/backtest.pdf R]—though only the first implements the parametric bootstrap method.\n\nThe second pillar of [[Basel II]] includes a [[backtesting]] step to validate the VaR figures.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe problem of risk measurement is an old one in [[statistics]], [[economics]] and [[finance]]. Financial risk management has been a concern of regulators and financial executives for a long time as well. Retrospective analysis has found some VaR-like concepts in this history. But VaR did not emerge as a distinct concept until the late 1980s. The triggering event was the stock market [[Black Monday (1987)|crash of 1987]]. This was the first major financial crisis in which a lot of academically-trained [[Quantitative analyst|quants]] were in high enough positions to worry about firm-wide survival.<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\nThe crash was so unlikely given standard [[statistical]] models, that it called the entire basis of [[Quantitative analyst|quant]] finance into question. A reconsideration of history led some quants to decide there were recurring crises, about one or two per decade, that overwhelmed the statistical assumptions embedded in models used for [[Trader (finance)|trading]], [[investment management]] and [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] pricing. These affected many markets at once, including ones that were usually not [[Financial correlation|correlated]], and seldom had discernible economic cause or warning (although after-the-fact explanations were plentiful).<ref name=\"Roundtable II\" /> Much later, they were named \"[[Black Swan theory|Black Swans]]\" by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] and the concept extended far beyond [[finance]].<ref name=\"Black Swan\">{{cite book | author=Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title=The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable | publisher=[[Random House]] | location=New York | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-4000-6351-2| title-link=The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable }}</ref>\n\nIf these events were included in [[quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] they dominated results and led to strategies that did not work day to day. If these events were excluded, the profits made in between \"Black Swans\" could be much smaller than the losses suffered in the crisis. Institutions could fail as a result.<ref name=\"Einhorn I\" /><ref name=\"Roundtable II\" /><ref name=\"Black Swan\" />\n\nVaR was developed as a systematic way to segregate extreme events, which are studied qualitatively over long-term history and broad market events, from everyday price movements, which are studied quantitatively using short-term data in specific markets. It was hoped that \"Black Swans\" would be preceded by increases in estimated VaR or increased frequency of VaR breaks, in at least some markets. The extent to which this has proven to be true is controversial.<ref name=\"Roundtable II\" />\n\nAbnormal markets and trading were excluded from the VaR estimate in order to make it observable.<ref name=\"Haug\">{{cite book|author=Espen Haug|title=Derivative Models on Models|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-01322-9}}</ref> It is not always possible to define loss if, for example, markets are closed as after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], or severely illiquid, as happened several times in 2008.<ref name=\"Einhorn I\" /> Losses can also be hard to define if the risk-bearing institution fails or breaks up.<ref name=\"Haug\" /> A measure that depends on traders taking certain actions, and avoiding other actions, can lead to [[self reference]].<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\nThis is risk management VaR. It was well established in [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative trading]] groups at several financial institutions, notably [[Bankers Trust]], before 1990, although neither the name nor the definition had been standardized. There was no effort to aggregate VaRs across trading desks.<ref name=\"Roundtable II\" />\n\nThe financial events of the early 1990s found many firms in trouble because the same underlying bet had been made at many places in the firm, in non-obvious ways. Since many trading desks already computed risk management VaR, and it was the only common risk measure that could be both defined for all businesses and aggregated without strong assumptions, it was the natural choice for reporting firmwide risk. [[JPMorgan Chase|J. P. Morgan]] CEO [[Dennis Weatherstone]] famously called for a \"4:15 report\" that combined all firm [[risk]] on one page, available within 15 minutes of the market close.<ref name=\"Roundtable I\" />\n\nRisk measurement VaR was developed for this purpose. Development was most extensive at [[JPMorgan Chase|J. P. Morgan]], which published the methodology and gave free access to estimates of the necessary underlying parameters in 1994. This was the first time VaR had been exposed beyond a relatively small group of [[Quantitative analyst|quants]]. Two years later, the methodology was spun off into an independent for-profit business now part of RiskMetrics Group (now part of [[MSCI]]).<ref name=\"Roundtable I\" />\n\nIn 1997, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] ruled that public corporations must disclose quantitative information about their [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] activity. Major [[bank]]s and dealers chose to implement the rule by including VaR information in the notes to their [[financial statements]].<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\nWorldwide adoption of the [[Basel II Accord]], beginning in 1999 and nearing completion today, gave further impetus to the use of VaR. VaR is the preferred [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] of [[market risk]], and concepts similar to VaR are used in other parts of the accord.<ref name=\"Jorion\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nVaR has been controversial since it moved from trading desks into the public eye in 1994. A famous 1997 [http://www.derivativesstrategy.com/magazine/archive/1997/0497fea2.asp debate] between [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] and Philippe Jorion set out some of the major points of contention. Taleb claimed VaR:<ref name=\"Taleb Criticism\">{{Citation|author=Nassim Taleb|title=The Jorion-Taleb Debate|publisher=Derivatives Strategy|date=April 1997}}</ref>\n\n# Ignored 2,500 years of experience in favor of untested models built by non-traders\n# Was charlatanism because it claimed to estimate the risks of rare events, which is impossible\n# Gave false confidence\n# Would be exploited by traders\n\nIn 2008 [[David Einhorn (hedge fund manager)|David Einhorn]] and [[Aaron Brown (financial author)|Aaron Brown]] debated VaR in [https://web.archive.org/web/20110226150454/http://www.garpdigitallibrary.org/download/GRR/2012.pdf Global Association of Risk Professionals Review]<ref name=\"Einhorn I\" /><ref name=\"Einhorn II\">{{Citation|author=David Einhorn|url=https://www.tilsonfunds.com/Einhorn-4-08.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426114310/http://www.tilsonfunds.com/Einhorn-4-08.pdf|archivedate=April 26, 2016|deadurl=no|title=Private Profits and Socialized Risk|publisher=GARP Risk Review|date=June–July 2008}}</ref> Einhorn compared VaR to \"an airbag that works all the time, except when you have a car accident\". He further charged that VaR:\n\n# Led to excessive risk-taking and leverage at financial institutions\n# Focused on the manageable risks near the center of the distribution and ignored the tails\n# Created an incentive to take \"excessive but remote risks\"\n# Was \"potentially catastrophic when its use creates a false sense of security among senior executives and watchdogs.\"\n\n[[The New York Times|New York Times]] reporter [[Joseph Nocera|Joe Nocera]] wrote an extensive piece [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 Risk Mismanagement]<ref name=\"Nocera\">{{Citation|author=[[Joe Nocera]]|title=Risk Mismanagement|publisher=[[The New York Times]] Magazine|date=January 4, 2009}}</ref> on January 4, 2009 discussing the role VaR played in the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008]]. After interviewing risk managers (including several of the ones cited above) the article suggests that VaR was very useful to risk experts, but nevertheless exacerbated the crisis by giving false security to bank executives and regulators. A powerful tool for professional risk managers, VaR is portrayed as both easy to misunderstand, and dangerous when misunderstood.\n\nTaleb in 2009 testified in Congress asking for the banning of VaR for a number of reasons. One was that tail risks are non-measurable. Another was that for [[anchoring]] reasons VaR leads to higher risk taking.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nassim Taleb|title=Report on The Risks of Financia l Modeling, VaR and the Economic Breakdown|url=http://gop.science.house.gov/Media/hearings/oversight09/sept10/taleb.pdf|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104013038/http://gop.science.house.gov/Media/hearings/oversight09/sept10/taleb.pdf|archivedate=November 4, 2009|date=Sep 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nVaR is not [[Subadditivity|subadditive]]:<ref name=\"Dowd\" /> VaR of a combined portfolio can be larger than the sum of the VaRs of its components.\n\nFor example, the average bank branch in the United States is robbed about once every ten years. A single-branch bank has about 0.0004% chance of being robbed on a specific day, so the risk of robbery would not figure into one-day 1% VaR. It would not even be within an order of magnitude of that, so it is in the range where the institution should not worry about it, it should insure against it and take advice from insurers on precautions. The whole point of insurance is to aggregate risks that are beyond individual VaR limits, and bring them into a large enough portfolio to get statistical predictability. It does not pay for a one-branch bank to have a security expert on staff.\n\nAs institutions get more branches, the risk of a robbery on a specific day rises to within an order of magnitude of VaR. At that point it makes sense for the institution to run internal stress tests and analyze the risk itself. It will spend less on insurance and more on in-house expertise. For a very large banking institution, robberies are a routine daily occurrence. Losses are part of the daily VaR calculation, and tracked statistically rather than case-by-case. A sizable in-house security department is in charge of prevention and control, the general risk manager just tracks the loss like any other cost of doing business.\nAs portfolios or institutions get larger, specific risks change from low-probability/low-predictability/high-impact to statistically predictable losses of low individual impact. That means they move from the range of far outside VaR, to be insured, to near outside VaR, to be analyzed case-by-case, to inside VaR, to be treated statistically.<ref name=\"Einhorn I\" />\n\nVaR is a static measure of risk. By definition, VaR is a particular characteristic of the probability distribution of the underlying (namely, VaR is essentially a quantile). For a dynamic measure of risk, see Novak,<ref name=\"Novak\"/> ch. 10.\n\nThere are common abuses of VaR:<ref name=\"Unbearable\" /><ref name=\"Roundtable I\" />\n\n# Assuming that plausible losses will be less than some multiple (often three) of VaR. Losses can be extremely large. \n# Reporting a VaR that has not passed a [[backtesting|backtest]]. Regardless of how VaR is computed, it should have produced the correct number of breaks (within [[sampling error]]) in the past. A common violation of common sense is to estimate a VaR based on the unverified assumption that everything follows a [[multivariate normal distribution]].\n\n===VaR, CVaR and EVaR===\n\nThe VaR is not a [[coherent risk measure]] since it violates the sub-additivity property, which is\n\n<math>\\mathrm{If}\\; X,Y \\in \\mathbf{L} ,\\; \\mathrm{then}\\; \\rho(X + Y) \\leq \\rho(X) + \\rho(Y).</math>\n\nHowever, it can be bounded by coherent risk measures like [[Conditional Value-at-Risk]] (CVaR) or [[entropic value at risk]] (EVaR). In fact, for <math> X\\in \\mathbf{L}_{M^+} </math> (with <math>\\mathbf{L}_{M^+} </math> the set of all [[Borel measure|Borel]] [[measurable function]]s whose [[moment-generating function]] exists for all positive real values) we have\n\n<math>\\text{VaR}_{1-\\alpha}(X)\\leq\\text{CVaR}_{1-\\alpha}(X)\\leq\\text{EVaR}_{1-\\alpha}(X),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n&\\text{VaR}_{1-\\alpha}(X):=\\inf_{t\\in\\mathbf{R}}\\{t:\\text{Pr}(X\\leq t)\\geq 1-\\alpha\\},\\\\\n&\\text{CVaR}_{1-\\alpha}(X) := \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\int_0^{\\alpha} \\text{VaR}_{1-\\gamma}(X)d\\gamma,\\\\\n&\\text{EVaR}_{1-\\alpha}(X):=\\inf_{z>0}\\{z^{-1}\\ln(M_X(z)/\\alpha)\\},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nin which <math> M_X(z) </math> is the moment-generating function of <math> X </math> at <math> z </math>.

(The OIS is chosen here as it reflects the rate for overnight secured lending between banks, and is thus considered a good indicator of the interbank credit markets.)  When the deal is not collateralized then a [[credit valuation adjustment]], or '''CVA''', is added to this value; <ref name=\"Youmbi\">[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2511585  Derivatives Pricing after the 2007-2008 Crisis: How the Crisis Changed the Pricing Approach], Didier Kouokap Youmbi, [[Bank of England]] – [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]]</ref>  essentially, the discounted [[risk-neutral|risk-neutral expectation]] of any loss due to the counterparty not performing - typically calculated under [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|a simulation framework]].<ref name=\"Hull_White\">[http://www.fincad.com/blog/valuation-adjustments-1 VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS 1].

He has been called the \"architect of the [[Atomic Age|nuclear age]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enrico-fermi-architect-of-the-nuclear-age-dies|title=Enrico Fermi, architect of the nuclear age, dies|date=Autumn 1954}}</ref> and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".<ref name=\"obit\" /> He was one of very few physicists to excel in both [[theoretical physics]] and [[experimental physics]]. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[induced radioactivity]] by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of [[transuranium elements]].  He made significant contributions to the development of [[statistical mechanics]], [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], and [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]].\n\nFermi's first major contribution involved the field of  [[statistical mechanics]]. After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] formulated his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an [[ideal gas]], employing a statistical formulation now known as [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called \"[[fermion]]s\". Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an [[electron]] during [[beta decay]], to satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]]. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the \"[[neutrino]]\". His theory, later referred to as [[Fermi's interaction]] and now called [[weak interaction]], described one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered [[neutron]], Fermi discovered that [[slow neutron]]s were more easily [[neutron capture|captured]] by [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] than fast ones, and he developed the [[Fermi age equation]] to describe this. After bombarding [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were later revealed to be [[nuclear fission product]]s.\n\nFermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new [[Italian racial laws]] that affected his Jewish wife, [[Laura Capon]]. He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. He was on hand when the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], went critical in 1943, and when the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]] did so the next year. At [[Project Y|Los Alamos]], he headed F Division, part of which worked on [[Edward Teller]]'s [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] \"[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super]]\" bomb. He was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, where he used his [[Fermi problem|Fermi method]] to estimate the bomb's yield.\n\nAfter the war, Fermi served under [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet [[fission bomb]] in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing|hearing]] that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to [[pion]]s and [[muon]]s, and he speculated that [[cosmic ray]]s arose when material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space.

Fermi was advised by [[Luigi Puccianti]], director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics was such that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=15–18}} During this time Fermi learned [[tensor calculus]], a technique key to [[general relativity]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=320}} Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, [[quantum mechanics]], and [[atomic physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317–319}}\n\nIn September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the Physics department. Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and [[Nello Carrara]]—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research [[X-ray crystallography]], and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=20}} During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal ''[[Nuovo Cimento]]''. The first was entitled \"On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion\" (''{{Lang|it|Sulla dinamica di un sistema rigido di cariche elettriche in moto traslatorio}}''). A sign of things to come was that the [[mass]] was expressed as a [[tensor]]—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, but in relativity it changes with velocity. The second paper was \"On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges\" (''{{lang|it|Sull'elettrostatica di un campo gravitazionale uniforme e sul peso delle masse elettromagnetiche}}''). Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c<sup>2</sup>, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the [[speed of light]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317–319}}\n\nThe first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c<sup>2</sup>. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper \"Concerning a contradiction between [[electrodynamic]] and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass\" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal ''[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]'' in 1922.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Über einen Widerspruch zwischen der elektrodynamischen und relativistischen Theorie der elektromagnetischen Masse |language=German |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=23 |pages=340–344 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=1059488 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> That year, Fermi submitted his article \"On the phenomena occurring near a [[world line]]\" (''{{lang|it|Sopra i fenomeni che avvengono in vicinanza di una linea oraria}}'') to the Italian journal ''{{ill|I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei|it|Rendiconti Lincei}}''.

The thesis was on [[X-ray diffraction]] images. [[Theoretical physics]] was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was one on [[experimental physics]]. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\nWhile writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book ''Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity'' by [[August Kopff]] in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the famous [[Mass–energy equivalence|Einstein equation]] ({{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}) was an enormous amount of [[nuclear potential energy]] to be exploited. \"It does not seem possible, at least in the near future\", he wrote, \"to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it.\"{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\nIn 1924 Fermi was initiated into the [[Masonic Lodge]] \"Adriano Lemmi\" of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goilombardia.it/massoni-illustri/enrico-fermi|title=Enrico Fermi L'Uomo, lo Scienziato e il Massone|language=Italian |accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nFermi spent a semester studying under [[Max Born]] at the [[University of Göttingen]], where he met [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Pascual Jordan]]. Fermi then studied in [[Leiden]] with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] obtained through the intercession of the mathematician [[Vito Volterra]]. Here Fermi met [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Albert Einstein]], and became good friends with [[Samuel Goudsmit]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]].  From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught [[mathematical physics]] and [[theoretical mechanics]] at the [[University of Florence]], where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and [[solid state physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=321–324}} While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schrödinger equation, the Italian physicist would often say, \"It has no business to fit so well!\"{{sfn|Hey|Walters|2003|p=61}}\n\nAfter [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper \"On the quantisation of the perfect monoatomic gas\" (''{{lang|it|Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico}}''), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which  describes the distribution of particles in [[physical system|systems]] of many [[identical particles]] that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]], who also showed how it was related to the [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. Accordingly, it is now known as [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=329–330}} After Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called \"[[fermion]]s\", while those that do not are called \"[[boson]]s\".{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=31}}\n\n== Professor in Rome ==\n[[File:Ragazzi di via Panisperna cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Fermi and his students (the [[Via Panisperna boys]]) in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, about 1934.

In 1928, he published his ''Introduction to Atomic Physics'' (''{{Lang|it|Introduzione alla fisica atomica}}''), which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333–335}} Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together at the end of the day and go over a problem, often from his own research.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333–335}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=38}} A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy.

To satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]], Pauli postulated the existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a \"[[neutrino]]\".{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|pp=50–51}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=346}}<ref name=\"Beta decay\">{{cite journal | last = Fermi | first = E.| title = Fermi's Theory of Beta Decay (English translation by Fred L.

One must remember that only the naturally occurring β emitters were known at the time the theory was proposed. Later when positron decay was discovered, the process was easily incorporated within Fermi's original framework. On the basis of his theory, the capture of an orbital electron by a nucleus was predicted and eventually observed. With time much experimental data has accumulated. Although peculiarities have been observed many times in β decay, Fermi's theory always has been equal to the challenge.<br />The consequences of the Fermi theory are vast. For example, β spectroscopy was established as a powerful tool for the study of nuclear structure. But perhaps the most influential aspect of this work of Fermi is that his particular form of the β interaction established a pattern which has been appropriate for the study of other types of interactions. It was the first successful theory of the creation and annihilation of material particles.

Fermi suggested, based on his work with neutrons, that the reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and [[graphite]] as a moderator instead of water.

Compton found a location in the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve, about {{convert|20|miles}} from Chicago. [[Stone & Webster]] was contracted to develop the site, but the work was halted by an industrial dispute. Fermi then persuaded Compton that he could build the reactor in the [[squash (sport)|squash]] court under the stands of the University of Chicago's [[Stagg Field]].

There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, revelling in the opportunities provided by the reactor's abundant production of free neutrons.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=366}} The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, but it became a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=207}}\n\nWhen the air-cooled [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi was on hand just in case something went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that he could see it happen.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=208–211}} Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for [[DuPont]] staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=205}} Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=104}}\n\nIn September 1944, Fermi inserted the first uranium fuel slug into the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]], the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, it had been designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the [[control rod]]s to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]], a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that if all 2,004 tubes were loaded, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=304–307}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=220–223}}\n\n[[File:Fermiac.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|The [[FERMIAC]], an [[analog computer]] invented by Fermi to study neutron transport]]\nIn mid-1944, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] persuaded Fermi to join his [[Los Alamos Laboratory|Project Y]] at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=368–369}} Arriving in September, Fermi was appointed an associate director of the laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him.

King, which looked after the \"water boiler\" [[Aqueous homogeneous reactor|aqueous homogeneous]] [[research reactor]]; F-3 Super Experimentation under [[Egon Bretscher]]; and F-4 Fission Studies under Anderson.{{sfn|Hawkins|1961|p=213}} Fermi observed the [[Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. He paced off the distance they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=674–677}}\n\nAlong with Oppenheimer, Compton, and [[Ernest Lawrence]], Fermi was part of the scientific panel that advised the [[Interim Committee]] on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=531–532}} Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] from the [[public address system]] in the technical area.

He was extraordinarily vigorous and loved games and sport. On such occasions his ambitious nature became apparent. He played tennis with considerable ferocity and when climbing mountains acted rather as a guide. One might have called him a benevolent dictator. I remember once at the top of a mountain Fermi got up and said: \"Well, it is two minutes to two, let's all leave at two o'clock\"; and of course, everybody got up faithfully and obediently. This leadership and self-assurance gave Fermi the name of \"The Pope\" whose pronouncements were infallible in physics. He once said: \"I can calculate anything in physics within a factor 2 on a few sheets; to get the numerical factor in front of the formula right may well take a physicist a year to calculate, but I am not interested in that.\" His leadership could go so far that it was a danger to the independence of the person working with him. I recollect once, at a party at his house when my wife cut the bread, Fermi came along and said he had a different philosophy on bread-cutting and took the knife out of my wife's hand and proceeded with the job because he was convinced that his own method was superior. But all this did not offend at all, but rather charmed everybody into liking Fermi. He had very few interests outside physics and when he once heard me play on Teller's piano he confessed that his interest in music was restricted to simple tunes.\n|source=[[Egon Bretscher]]<ref name=\"frs\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bretscher | first1 = E. | last2 = Cockcroft | first2 = J.D.| authorlink2 = John Cockcroft | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1955.0006 | title = Enrico Fermi. 1901–1954 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 1 | pages = 69–78 | year = 1955 | jstor = 769243| pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n}}\nFermi received numerous awards in recognition of his achievements, including the [[Matteucci Medal]] in 1926, the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938, the [[Hughes Medal]] in 1942, the [[Franklin Medal]] in 1947, and the [[Rumford Prize]] in 1953.

The historian of physics, [[C. P. Snow]], wrote that \"if Fermi had been born a few years earlier, one could well imagine him discovering [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford's]] atomic nucleus, and then developing [[Bohr model|Bohr's theory]] of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about Fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole\".{{sfn|Snow|1981|p=79}}\n\nFermi was known as an inspiring teacher, and was noted for his attention to detail, simplicity, and careful preparation of his lectures.{{sfn|Ricci|2001|pp=297–302}} Later, his lecture notes were transcribed into books.{{sfn|Ricci|2001|p=286}} His papers and notebooks are today in the University of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fermi.lib.uchicago.edu/fermicollection.htm |title=Enrico Fermi Collection |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> [[Victor Weisskopf]] noted how Fermi \"always managed to find the simplest and most direct approach, with the minimum of complication and sophistication.\"{{sfn|Salvini|2001|p=5}} Fermi's ability and success stemmed as much from his appraisal of the art of the possible, as from his innate skill and intelligence. He disliked complicated theories, and while he had great mathematical ability, he would never use it when the job could be done much more simply. He was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. Later on, his method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the \"[[Fermi problem|Fermi method]]\", and is widely taught.{{sfn|Von Baeyer|1993|pp=3–8}}\n\nFermi was fond of pointing out that [[Alessandro Volta]], working in his laboratory, could have had no idea where the study of electricity would lead.{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=242}} Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.{{sfn|Salvini|2001|p=17}}\n\n=== Things named in Fermi's honor ===\n[[File:Viaenricofermi.jpg|right|thumb|The sign at Enrico Fermi Street in Rome]]\n[[File:Memorial plaque in honour of Enrico Fermi in the Basilica Santa Croce, Florence.

Since the late 1990s, the SSA has been widely used to simulate chemical reactions inside living cells, where the small molecular populations of some reactant species often invalidate the differential equations of traditional deterministic chemical kinetics.\n\nGillespie's original derivation of the SSA<ref name=R1/> began by considering how chemical reactions actually occur in a ''well-stirred dilute gas''.  Reasoning from physics (and not by heuristically extrapolating deterministic reaction rates to a stochastic context), he showed that the ''probability'' that a specific reaction will occur in the next very small time ''dt'' could be written as an explicit function of the current species populations multiplied by ''dt''.  From that result he deduced, using only the laws of probability, an exact formula for the joint probability density function ''p''(''τ,j'') of the {time ''τ'' to the next reaction event} and the {index ''j'' of that reaction}.  The SSA consists of first generating random values for ''τ'' and ''j'' according to ''p''(''τ,j''), and then actualizing the next reaction accordingly.  The generating step of the SSA can be accomplished using any of several different methods, and Gillespie's original paper<ref name=R1/> presented two:  the \"direct method\", which follows from a straightforward application of the well known Monte Carlo inversion method for generating random numbers; and the \"first-reaction method\", which is less straightforward but mathematically equivalent.  Later workers derived additional methods for generating random numbers according to Gillespie's function ''p''(''τ,j'') which offer computational advantages in various specific situations. Gillespie's original derivation of the SSA<ref name=R1/><ref name=R2/><ref name=R3/> applied only to a well-stirred dilute ''gas''.  It was widely assumed/hoped that the SSA would also apply when the reactant molecules are solute molecules in a well-stirred dilute ''solution'', a case more appropriate to cellular chemistry.  In fact it does, but that was not definitively established until 2009.<ref name=R11/>  The SSA is one component of stochastic chemical kinetics, a field that Gillespie played a major role in developing and clarifying through his later publications.<ref name=R3/><ref name=R11/><ref name=R4/><ref name=R5/><ref name=R6/><ref name=R7/><ref name=R8/><ref name=R9/><ref name=R10/><ref name=R12/><ref name=R13/><ref name=R14/>\n\nThe SSA is physically accurate only for systems that are both ''dilute'' and ''well-mixed'' in the reactant (solute) molecules.<ref name=R14/>  An extension of the SSA which is aimed at circumventing the globally well-mixed requirement is the reaction-diffusion SSA (RD-SSA).  It subdivides the system volume into cubic subvolumes or “voxels” which are small enough that each can be considered well-mixed.  Chemical reactions are then considered to occur inside individual voxels and are modeled using the SSA.  The diffusion of reactant molecules to adjacent voxels is modeled by special “voxel-hopping” reactions that accurately simulate the diffusion equation provided the voxels are, again, sufficiently ''small''.  But modeling a bimolecular reaction inside a voxel using the SSA’s reaction probability rate will be physically valid only if the reactant molecules are dilute inside the voxel, and that requires the voxels to be much ''larger'' than the reactant molecules.<ref name=R14/>  These opposing requirements (smaller vs. larger) on the voxel size for the RD-SSA often cannot be simultaneously met.  In such cases, it will be necessary to adopt a much less restrictive simulation strategy that carefully tracks the location of every reactant molecule in the system.  An algorithm of that kind was devised in 2014 by Gillespie and co-workers.<ref name=R15/>  Called the '''small-voxel tracking algorithm''' (SVTA), it subdivides the system volume into voxels that are smaller than the reactant molecules, and hence ''much'' smaller than the voxels used in the RD-SSA.  Diffusion is therefore modeled much more accurately in the SVTA than in the RD-SSA.  But inside such small voxels, the SSA’s bimolecular reaction probability rate will no longer be physically valid.  So the SVTA instead models bimolecular reactions using a ''novel extension of the diffusional voxel-hopping rule''. That extension rectifies the physical incorrectness of the standard diffusion equation on the small space-time scales where collision-induced reactions occur.  The SVTA thus eliminates the requirements that the system be dilute and well-mixed, and it does so in a way that has theoretical support in molecular physics.  The price for this major gain in robustness and accuracy is a simulation procedure that is more computationally intensive.  Details of the SVTA and its justification in physical theory are given in the original paper;<ref name=R15/> however, that paper does not develop a widely applicable, user-friendly software implementation of the SVTA.\n\nGillespie's broader research has produced articles on cloud physics,<ref name=R16/><ref name=R17/> random variable theory,<ref name=R18/> Brownian motion,<ref name=R19/><ref name=R20/> Markov process theory,<ref name=R21/><ref name=R22/> electrical noise,<ref name=R23/><ref name=R24/><ref name=R25/> light scattering in aerosols,<ref name=R26/><ref name=R27/> and quantum mechanics.<ref name=R28/><ref name=R29/>\n\n==Education==\nBorn in Missouri, Gillespie grew up in Oklahoma where he graduated from Shawnee High School in 1956.  In 1960 he received his B.A. (''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]]) with a major in physics from [[Rice University]].\n\nGillespie received his Ph.D. from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1968 with a dissertation in experimental elementary particle physics under [[Aihud Pevsner]].  Part of his dissertation derived procedures for stochastically simulating high-energy elementary particle reactions using digital computers, and [[Monte Carlo method]]ology would play a major role in his later work.  During his graduate student years at JHU he was also a Jr. Instructor (1960–63) and an Instructor (1966-68) in the sophomore General Physics course.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1968 to 1971, Gillespie was a Faculty Research Associate at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland College Park's]] Institute for Molecular Physics.  He did research in classical transport theory with Jan Sengers.  In 1971 he was also an Instructor in the University's Physics Department.\n\nFrom 1971 to 2001, Gillespie was a civilian scientist at the [[NAWS China Lake|Naval Weapons Center]] in China Lake, California.  Initially he was a Research Physicist in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Division. There his research in cloud physics led to a procedure for simulating the growth of raindrops in clouds,<ref name=R16/> and that prompted his paper on the SSA.<ref name=R1/>  In 1981 he became Head of the Research Department's Applied Mathematics Research Group, and in 1994 he was made a Senior Scientist in the Research Department.  He retired from China Lake in 2001.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2015, Gillespie was a private consultant in computational biochemistry, working under contract for various periods of time with the [[California Institute of Technology]], the [[Molecular Sciences Institute]] (in Berkeley), the [[Beckman Institute at Caltech]], and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].  Most of this was in collaboration with the [[Linda Petzold]] research group in the Computer Sciences Department of UCSB.\n\n==Books by Gillespie==\n*{{cite book \n|title = A Quantum Mechanics Primer\n|last = Gillespie | first = Daniel T.\n|year = 1970\n|publisher = International Textbook Co\n|isbn = 0700222901\n|pages = 137\n|url =\n}} Was in print from 1970 to 1986 by International Textbook Co., International Textbook Co.

The algorithm for generating samples from the [[Boltzmann distribution]] was later generalized by [[W.K. Hastings]] to become the [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]]. He is credited as part of the team that came up with the name Monte Carlo method in reference to a colleague's relative's love for the casinos of Monte Carlo. [[Monte Carlo methods]] are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results. In statistical mechanics applications prior to the introduction of the Metropolis algorithm, the method consisted of generating a large number of random configurations of the system, computing the properties of interest (such as energy or density) for each configuration, and then producing a [[weighted average]] where the weight of each configuration is its [[Boltzmann factor]], <math>e^{-E/kT}</math>, where <math>E</math> is the [[energy]], <math>T</math> is the [[temperature]], and <math>k</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. The key contribution of the Metropolis paper was the idea that\n\n{{quotation|Instead of choosing configurations randomly, then weighting them with exp(−''E''/''kT''), we choose configurations with a probability  exp(−''E''/''kT'') and weight them evenly.|Metropolis et al.|<ref name=metropolis />}}\n\n==Associations and honors==\nMetropolis was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] and the [[American Mathematical Society]].

[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the ''[[axiom of regularity|axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]].''{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}\n\nThe axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'', which later became an essential instrument in set theory.{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}\n\nThe second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of [[Class (set theory)|class]], and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set.{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}\n\nWith this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that could be used to prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=123}}\n\nLess than a month later, von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, communicated to Gödel an interesting consequence of his theorem: that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=123}} However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his [[second incompleteness theorem]], and he sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems.{{sfn|Dawson|1997|p=70}} Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=124}} He never thought much of \"the American system of claiming personal priority for everything.\"{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=182}}\n\n====Von Neumann Paradox====\n{{main|Von Neumann paradox}}\nBuilding on the work of [[Felix Hausdorff]], in 1924 [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Alfred Tarski]] proved that given a solid [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] in 3‑dimensional space, [[existence theorem|there exists]] a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[subset]]s, that can be reassembled together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball.

In mathematics, continuous geometry is a substitute of complex [[projective geometry]], where instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set 0, 1, ..., ''n'', it can be an element of the unit interval [0,1]. Earlier, [[Karl Menger|Menger]] and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry in terms of the properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.\nWhile the dimensions of the subspaces of projective geometries are a discrete set (the non-negative integers), the dimensions of the elements of a continuous geometry can range continuously across the unit interval [0,1]. Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of [[von Neumann algebra]]s with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the [[hyperfinite type II factor]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=140}}<ref>{{cite journal|first=John |last=von Neumann|doi=10.1007/BF01782352|title= Zur Algebra der Funktionaloperationen und Theorie der normalen Operatoren|language=German |journal= [[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=102 |issue=1 |year=1930|pages= 370–427|bibcode=1930MatAn.102..685E}}.

He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as [[linear operators]] acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=139–141}}\n\nThe ''physics'' of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the ''mathematics'' of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them. For example, the [[uncertainty principle]], according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the ''non-commutativity'' of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=139–141}} When Heisenberg was informed von Neumann had clarified the difference between an unbounded operator that was a [[self-adjoint operator]] and one that was merely symmetric, Heisenberg replied \"Eh? What is the difference?\"{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=142}}\n\nVon Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined \"hidden variables,\" as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1935, [[Grete Hermann]] published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Grete |last=Hermann |authorlink=Grete Hermann |title=Die naturphilosophischen Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik |journal =[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=23 |number=42 |pages=718&ndash;721 |year=1935 |doi=10.1007/BF01491142|bibcode=1935NW.....23..718H }} English translation in {{cite book|last=Hermann |first=Grete |title=Grete Hermann &mdash; Between physics and philosophy |editor-first1=Elise |editor-last1=Crull |editor-first2=Guido |editor-last2=Bacciagaluppi |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |pages=239&ndash;278}}</ref> Hermann's work was largely ignored until after [[John S.

The von Neumann entropy is the cornerstone in the development of quantum information theory, while the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] applies to classical information theory. This is considered a historical anomaly, as it might have been expected that Shannon entropy was discovered prior to Von Neumann entropy, given the latter's more widespread application to quantum information theory. However, the historical reverse occurred. Von Neumann first discovered von Neumann entropy, and applied it to questions of statistical physics. Decades later, Shannon developed an information-theoretic formula for use in classical information theory, and asked von Neumann what to call it, with von Neumman telling him to call it Shannon entropy, as it was a special case of von Neumann entropy.<ref>Quantum Information Theory, By Mark M.

The field of quantum logic was subsequently inaugurated, in a famous paper of 1936 by von Neumann and Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to introduce quantum logics,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gabbay|first1=Dov M.|authorlink1=Dov Gabbay|last2=Woods|first2=John |title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&pg=PA205|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-054939-2|pages=205–2017|chapter=The History of Quantum Logic}}</ref> wherein von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a [[propositional calculus]] substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (''e.g.'', one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, ''[[A fortiori argument|a fortiori]]'', it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added ''in between'' the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through. This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the ''non-commutativity'' of conjunction <math>(A\\land B)\\ne (B\\land A)</math>. It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, <math>P\\lor(Q\\land R)=(P\\lor Q)\\land(P\\lor R)</math> and <math>P\\land (Q\\lor R)=(P\\land Q)\\lor(P\\land R)</math>, are not valid for quantum theory.<ref name=\"quantum logic\"/>\n\nThe reason for this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for classical disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (spin angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., ''x'' and ''y'') results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state '''ɸ''' of a certain electron verifies the proposition \"the spin of the electron in the ''x'' direction is positive.\" By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction ''y'' will be completely indeterminate for '''ɸ'''. Hence, '''ɸ''' can verify neither the proposition \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive\" nor\nthe proposition \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative.\" Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive or the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative\" must be true for '''ɸ'''.\nIn the case of distribution, it is therefore possible to have a situation in which ''<math>A \\land (B\\lor C)= A\\land 1 = A</math>'', while <math>(A\\land B)\\lor (A\\land C)=0\\lor 0=0</math>.<ref name=\"quantum logic\">{{cite journal |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics |first=Garrett |last=Birkhoff |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |first2=John |last2=von Neumann |journal=Annals of Mathematics |volume=37 |issue=4 |date=October 1936 |pages=823–843 |doi=10.2307/1968621 |jstor=1968621 }}</ref>\n\nAs [[Hilary Putnam]] writes, von Neumann replaced classical logic with a logic constructed in [[orthomodular lattice]]s (isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space of a given physical system).<ref name=\"Putnam1985\">{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Putnam|title=Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAjfSA3ir3kC|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31394-0|page=263}}</ref>\n\n=== Game theory ===\nVon Neumann founded the field of [[game theory]] as a mathematical discipline.<ref name=\"KuhnTucker\">{{cite journal|last=Kuhn|first= H.

This theorem establishes that in [[zero-sum game]]s with [[perfect information]] (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a pair of [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.<ref name=\"Game Theory\">{{cite journal |last=von Neumann |first=J: |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |language=German  |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=100 |issue=1928 |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/bf01448847|year=1928 |bibcode=1928MatAn.100...32C }}</ref>\n\nSuch strategies, which minimize the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]]). Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a front-page story.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods, especially [[convex set]]s and [[topology|topological]] [[fixed-point theorem]], rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]]-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.<ref name=\"KuhnTucker\"/>\n\nIndependently, [[Leonid Kantorovich]]'s functional analytic work on mathematical economics also focused attention on optimization theory, non-differentiability, and [[Riesz space|vector lattices]]. Von Neumann's functional-analytic techniques—the use of [[Dual space|duality pairings]] of real [[vector space]]s to represent prices and quantities, the use of [[Supporting hyperplane|supporting]] and [[Hyperplane separation theorem|separating hyperplanes]] and convex sets, and fixed-point theory—have been the primary tools of mathematical economics ever since.{{sfn|Blume|2008}}\n\n=== Mathematical economics ===\nVon Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several influential publications. For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].<ref name=KuhnTucker/> Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the [[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Generalized eigenvalue problem|matrix pencil]]&nbsp;'' '''A'''&nbsp;−&nbsp;λ'''B''''' with nonnegative matrices&nbsp;'''A''' and '''B'''; von Neumann sought [[probability vector|probability]] [[generalized eigenvector|vectors]]&nbsp;''p'' and&nbsp;''q'' and a positive number&nbsp;''λ'' that would solve the [[complementarity theory|complementarity]] equation\n:<math>p^T (A - \\lambda B) q = 0</math>\nalong with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the \"intensity\" at which the production process would run. The unique solution ''λ'' represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy; the rate of growth equals the [[interest rate]].<ref>For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&nbsp;'''A''' and&nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue problem]]\n: '''A''' − λ '''I''' ''q'' = 0,\nwhere the nonnegative matrix''&nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]]. Von Neumann's irreducibility condition was called the \"whales and [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]]\" hypothesis by [[D. G. Champernowne|David Champernowne]], who provided a verbal and economic commentary on the English translation of von Neumann's article. Von Neumann's hypothesis implied that every economic process used a positive amount of every economic good. Weaker \"irreducibility\" conditions were given by [[David Gale]] and by [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]], and [[Gerald L. Thompson]] in the 1950s and then by Stephen M.

The study of von Neumann's model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics.{{sfn|Rockafellar|1970|pp=i, 74}}{{sfn|Rockafellar|1974|pp=351–378}}{{sfn|Ye|1997|pp=277–299}} This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, [[Linear inequality|linear inequalities]], [[Linear programming#Complementary slackness|complementary slackness]], and [[Duality (optimization)|saddlepoint duality]].

His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, and so did the economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]], and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist [[Léon Walras]]. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's [[General Equilibrium Theory]] and [[Walras' Law]], which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=250–253}}\n\n=== Linear programming ===\nBuilding on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after [[George Dantzig]] described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point.

Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative [[least squares]] subproblem with a convexity constraint ([[Projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projecting]] the zero-vector onto the [[convex hull]] of the active [[simplex]]). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first [[interior point method]] of linear programming.<ref name=\"George B 2003\"/>\n\n=== Mathematical statistics ===\nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions to [[mathematical statistics]].

Carlucci, Sidney S. Jacobson, (CRC Press, 26 Aug 2013), page 523</ref>\n\nLater with [[Robert D. Richtmyer]], von Neumann developed an algorithm defining ''artificial [[viscosity]]'' that improved the understanding of [[shock wave]]s. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of ''artificial viscosity'' smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Method for the Numerical Calculation of Hydrodynamic Shocks |last=von Neumann |first=J. |last2=Richtmyer |first2=R.

During WW2, he arrived one day at the office of R.H. Kent, the Director of the US Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]], with a computer program he had created for calculating a one-dimensional model of 100 molecules to simulate a shock wave. Von Neumann then gave a seminar on his computer program to an audience which included his friend [[Theodore von Kármán]]. After von Neumann had finished, von Kármán said \"Well, Johnny, that's very interesting. Of course you realize [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] also used digital models to simulate [[continuum mechanics]].\" It was evident from von Neumann's face, that he had been unaware of Lagrange's [[Mécanique analytique]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century |editor-first1=Nicholas |editor-last1=Metropolis |publisher=Elsevier |year=2014 |page=24 |isbn=978-1-4832-9668-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Mastery of mathematics ===\nStan Ulam, who knew von Neumann well, described his mastery of mathematics this way: \"Most mathematicians know one method. For example, [[Norbert Wiener]] had mastered [[Fourier transform]]s. Some mathematicians have mastered two methods and might really impress someone who knows only one of them. John von Neumann had mastered three methods.\" He went on to explain that the three methods were:\n* A facility with the symbolic manipulation of linear operators;\n* An intuitive feeling for the logical structure of any new mathematical theory;\n* An intuitive feeling for the combinatorial superstructure of new theories.{{sfn|Ulam|1983|p=96}}\nEdward Teller wrote that \"Nobody knows all science, not even von Neumann did. But as for mathematics, he contributed to every part of it except number theory and topology. That is, I think, something unique.\"{{sfn|Dyson|1998|p=77}}\n\nVon Neumann was asked to write an essay for the layman describing what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that there is always the danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Von_Neumann_Part_1.html |title=Von Neumann: The Mathematician |publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive |access-date=December 16, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Von_Neumann_Part_2.html |title=Von Neumann: The Mathematician, Part 2 |publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive |access-date=December 16, 2016 }}</ref>{{sfn|von Neumann|1947|pp=180–196}}\n\n== Nuclear weapons ==\n[[File:John von Neumann ID badge.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Von Neumann's wartime [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ID badge photo]]\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nBeginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann developed an expertise in [[explosion]]s—phenomena that are difficult to model mathematically. During this period, von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of [[shaped charge]]s. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]]. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in a remote part of New Mexico.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nVon Neumann made his principal contribution to the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] in the concept and design of the [[nuclear weapon design|explosive lenses]] that were needed to compress the [[plutonium]] core of the [[Fat Man]] weapon that was later dropped on [[Nagasaki]]. While von Neumann did not originate the \"[[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion]]\" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of \"assembly\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–133, 157–159}}\n\nWhen it turned out that there would not be enough [[uranium-235]] to make more than one bomb, the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann's idea was implemented. Implosion was the only method that could be used with the [[plutonium-239]] that was available from the [[Hanford Site]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=239–245}} He established the design of the [[explosive lens]]es required, but there remained concerns about \"edge effects\" and imperfections in the explosives.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=295}} His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5% from spherical symmetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html |title=Section 8.0 The First Nuclear Weapons |publisher=Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions  |first=Carey |last=Sublette |accessdate=January 8, 2016}}</ref> After a series of failed attempts with models, this was achieved by [[George Kistiakowsky]], and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=320–327}}\n\nIn a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=209}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Implosion bomb animated.gif|thumb|left|Implosion mechanism]]\nVon Neumann, four other scientists, and various military personnel were included in the target selection committee that was responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki as the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first targets of the atomic bomb]]. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital [[Kyoto]], which had been spared the [[Air raids on Japan|bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities]], was von Neumann's first choice,{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=242–245}} a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General [[Leslie Groves]]. However, this target was dismissed by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]].{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=268–276}}\n\nOn July 16, 1945, von Neumann and numerous other Manhattan Project personnel were eyewitnesses to the first test of an atomic bomb detonation, which was code-named [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]. The event was conducted as a test of the implosion method device, at the [[Alamogordo Bombing Range|bombing range]] near [[Alamogordo Army Airfield]], {{convert|35|mi}} southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to {{convert|5|ktonTNT|lk=on}} but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=371–372}} It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression \"kilotons\" appeared for the first time.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=205}} After the war, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had \"known sin\". Von Neumann's response was that \"sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it.\"{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=245}}\n\nVon Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became, along with Edward Teller, one of those who sustained the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb project]].

Over the following two years, he became a consultant to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), a member of the influential [[General Advisory Committee]] of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], a consultant to the newly established [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], and a member of the [[Scientific Advisory Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=350–351}}\n\nIn 1955, von Neumann became a commissioner of the AEC. He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact [[hydrogen bomb]]s suitable for [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of [[tritium]] and [[lithium 6]] needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate-range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, which turned out to be the case.{{sfn|Heims|1980|p=276}}{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=367–369}} Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing]], at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.<ref name=\"Halmos\"/>\n\nShortly before his death from cancer, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, which would sometimes meet in his home. Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The [[SM-65 Atlas]] passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=359–365}}\n\n=== Mutual assured destruction ===\n[[File:Redwing Mohawk 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Redwing]] nuclear test in July 1956]]\nVon Neumann is credited with developing the equilibrium strategy of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD).

Cronin, University of Chicago Press (2004), page 236</ref>\n\nHalmos recounts a story told by [[Nicholas Metropolis]], concerning the speed of von Neumann's calculations, when somebody asked von Neumann to solve the famous fly puzzle:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TwoTrainsPuzzle.html |title=Fly Puzzle (Two Trains Puzzle) |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=February 15, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Two bicyclists start 20 miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 mph. At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, southbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, northbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] so obtained.\n\nThe quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles.\n\nWhen the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: \"Oh, you must have heard the trick before!\" \"What trick?\" asked von Neumann, \"All I did was sum the geometric series.\"<ref name=\"Halmos\"/>}}\n\nEugene Wigner told a similar story, only with a swallow instead of a fly, and says it was [[Max Born]] who posed the question to von Neumann in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|title=John von Neumann – A Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTS9O0CoVng&t=1006|publisher=The Mathematical Association of American|accessdate=22 February 2016|pages=16m46s–19m04s|date=1966}}</ref>\n\nVon Neumann was also noted for his [[eidetic memory]] (sometimes called photographic memory). [[Herman Goldstine]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|pp=167}}}}\n\nVon Neumann was reportedly able to memorize the pages of telephone directories.

And if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too.

He was interested in computing from the early days of the computing revolution and oversaw the first computer purchases at the [[University of Adelaide]].\n\n==Personal==\nThe fourth child of Gilbert MacDonald Potts and Lorna Potts (née West), named after family friend and medical doctor Renfrey Gershom Burnard, Potts was educated at [[Rose Park Primary School]] and [[Prince Alfred College]], where his father was Second Master. Potts was an outstanding lecturer who drew large audiences to his talks. In addition to mathematics, he was interested in sports and music. His sporting activities included long distance and marathon running, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton, bushwalking, and swimming. He played both the piano and the clarinet and was a volunteer disc jockey at a local radio station. He married Barbara Kidman<ref name=Kidman>Dr Barbara Kidman was a senior lecturer in computer science at the University of Adelaide. After graduating in 1949 with first class Honours in Physics (\"the first woman to do so\" ''(Presumably, the first woman at the University of Adelaide.)''), she devoted 6 years to full-time research at the Oxford University before returning to Adelaide and being awarded a PhD in 1956 (\"one of the first two women to achieve this\" ''(Again, presumably, the first at the University of Adelaide.)''). Following a 9-year interruption, Dr Kidman returned to work in 1966 in what was then the very new field of computing and completed 20 years of work in this industry before retiring in 1987.

In 1997 he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] for discoveries in controlled thermonuclear fusion, contributions to [[plasma physics]], and work in computational [[statistical mechanics]].  He was also a recipient of the [[Ernest Lawrence|E.O. Lawrence]] Prize (1964), the [[Albert Einstein Award]] (1967), the [[James Clerk Maxwell Prize]] in Plasma Physics (1976), the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] (1985), and the [[Hannes Alfvén Prize]] (2002).\n\n==Key scientific contributions==\nDuring his first post-doctoral position at [[Stanford University]] (1949–1950), he derived the ''Rosenbluth formula'', which was the basis of the analysis used by [[Robert Hofstadter]] in his Nobel prize-winning experimental investigation of [[electron scattering]].  Hofstadter refers to this in his 1961 [[Nobel Lecture]]: \"This behavior can be understood in terms of the theoretical scattering law developed by M. Rosenbluth in 1950\".  In 1953, Rosenbluth derived the [[Metropolis algorithm]]; cited in ''Computing in Science and Engineering'' (Jan. 2000) as being among the top 10 algorithms having the \"greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century.\"  However, by the late 1950s, Rosenbluth turned his attention to the burgeoning discipline of plasma physics and quickly laid the foundation for many avenues of research in the field, particularly the theory of [[plasma instabilities]]. Although he continued to work on plasma physics for the remainder of his career, he often made forays into other fields.  For example, around 1980, he and coworkers produced a detailed analysis of the [[free electron laser]], indicating how its spectral intensity can be optimized.  He maintained a high productivity rate throughout his entire career.  Indeed, only a few years before his death, Rosenbluth discovered the existence of residual flows (so-called ''Rosenbluth-Hinton flows''), a key result for understanding turbulence in [[tokamak]]s.\n\n==Early years==\nRosenbluth graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1942.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2004-2005/memorials/rosenbluth/rosenbluth.html |title=In Memoriam - Marshall N. Rosenbluth |date=2004-09-24 |publisher=[[UT Austin]] |author=Larry R. Faulkner|author2=Sue Alexander Greninger |accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref>  He did his undergraduate study at Harvard, graduating in 1946 (B.S., [[Phi Beta Kappa]]), despite also serving in the [[U.S. Navy]] (1944–46) during this period.  He received his Ph.D. in 1949 from the [[University of Chicago]].  In 1950, [[Edward Teller]], considered the father of the [[hydrogen bomb]], recruited Rosenbluth to work at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]].<ref>Teller, Edward, The Work of Many People, Science, New Series, Vol. 121, No. 3139 (Feb. 25, 1955), pp. 267-275, page 271</ref> Rosenbluth maintained this position until 1956. The research he conducted at Los Alamos led to the development of the H-bomb.\n\n{{quote|... Rosenbluth went to the [[Ivy Mike|South Pacific to prepare for the first H-bomb test]]. He had trouble sleeping, and was pondering the bomb design when he realised the scientists had made a calculating error that could result in a dud. The flaw was remedied by modifying the detonator, and the bomb vaporised a [[mile]]-wide island with a power 700 times greater than that of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite newspaper|author=Wright, Pearce|authorlink=Pearce Wright|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Obituary.

Rosenbluth also served as a member of the [[JASON Defense Advisory Group]].\n\nRosenbluth was affectionately known as the ''Pope of Plasma Physics'' in reference to his deep understanding of the field.<ref>Kim A.

Shah came back to Pakistan, after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Winter War]] where he joined his alma mater, Quaid-i-Azam University. His early research were mainly focused and emphasised on [[Fluid mechanics|Fluid]] and [[Aerodynamics]]. In 1972, M. Shah was introduced by [[Asghar Qadir]] to Dr. [[Abdus Salam]], where Professor Salam had delegated M. Shah to [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] where he had closely collaborated with Dr. [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]] and Dr. Asghar Qadir in the development of the nuclear device. At the end of 1975, Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan|A.

Tasneem Mohammad Shah who specialised in [[Fluid dynamics]] from [[Oxford University|Oxford]], was named by Dr. Abdus Salam for the gas-centrifuge project when Munir Ahmad Khan and Hafeez Qureshi consulted with him. In 1975, Anwar Ali and Dr. G.D. Alam had met with Tasneem Shah in Islamabad, and Shah, with the full backing of Abdus Salam, was accompanied by Dr. G. D.

Shah had joined Abdul Qadeer Khan's then-known as [[Engineering Research Laboratories]] (ERL) from its beginning years. Trained as an applied mathematician, Shah was an instrumental carrying out the experimental and theoretical research at KRL. He was the founder and had served as the first director of the Computational Fluid Dynamics Division at the KRL. In particular, he had developed the expertise techniques in fluid explosions—phenomena which are difficult to model mathematically. M. Shah, a pioneer in fluid dynamics, had used complex integrations, and mathematical methods to developed the sustainable method for the gas-centrifuges which he published his work at the KRL.\n\nHe gained fame in the research laboratory when Dr. M. Shah had mathematically modelled the fuild system in a [[Zippe-type centrifuge]], and have had improved the technology that was brought by Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] in the mid 1970s. His developed theories and the experimental research led to an improvement in the devices, and KRL had developed the advanced and newer versions of the Zippe-type technology as P-1 and P-2. M. Shah's principal contribution to the gas-centrifuge program was the rotational dynamics of the <sup>235</sup>[[Uranium-235|U]] by using the complex and difficult applications of [[Disk integration|Washer]] and [[Shell integration]]s.\n\nDr. T. M. Shah was one of the key scientist who had helped developing the [[Inertial system|Inertial]] and [[Thermal system]] of the [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri missile system series]]. He had laid down the ground work of the [[Liquid-propellant rocket|Liquid-propellant rocketry system]] and formulated the various mathematical theories of the rocket science. On 28 May 1998, with numerous other KRL and PAEC weapon scientists, M. Shah was an eyewitness to the [[Chagai-I|first atomic weapons testing]], at [[Ras Koh Hills]] near at [[Chagai Hills]]. He, along with other scientists, was conferred with [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|high civilian awards]] in 1998, and in 1999.\n\nAfter serving in KRL for more than 27 years, M. Shah had begun providing training and teaching at the KRL to the field of [[Fluid dynamics]]. He established the Department of Cryptology at [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|NUST]] whereas he served as its first director. He also established the first IT University in private corporate sector and become the first Rector of KASBIT, Karachi.<ref>{{Cite web| last =| first =TechnoMoot| authorlink =| title =Prof. Tasneen M.

His argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on Plato's ''Theory of Forms'', gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take some key ideas into account, such as: the impossibility of possessing all relevant information, that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact, and flawed theories/models that are based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place, but could have taken place. Discussing the ludic fallacy in ''The Black Swan'', he writes, \"The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly, in both computational and mental effort.\"\n\nIn the second edition of ''The Black Swan'', he posited that the foundations of [[quantitative analyst|quantitative economics]] are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field, as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician [[Raphael Douady]], he called the problem ''statistical undecidability'' (Douady and Taleb, 2010).\n\nTaleb sees his main challenge as mapping his ideas of \"robustification\" and \"[[antifragility]]\", that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the \"fourth quadrant\" in the exposure domain.<ref>Taleb, N. N. (2009). Errors, robustness, and the fourth quadrant. [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeintfor/v_3a25_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a744-759.htm International Journal of Forecasting, 25(4), 744–59]</ref> One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the 'barbell' strategy which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one's personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in 'medium risk' investments is pointless, because risk is difficult, if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.\n\nTaleb asserts that by adopting these strategies a portfolio can be \"robust\", that is, gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events.<ref>Taleb, ''The Black Swan'', pg 207</ref>{{rp|207}} Together with [[Donald Geman]] and [[Hélyette Geman]], he modeled the \"maximum entropy barbell\" which consists in \"to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere\", based on an insight by E.

For the U.S. stock market, a single day, [[Black Monday (1987)|the crash of 1987]], determined 80% of the kurtosis. The same problem is found with interest and exchange rates, commodities, and other variables. The problem is not just that the data had \"fat tails\", something people knew but sort of wanted to forget; it was that we would never be able to determine \"how fat\" the tails were. Never. The implication is that those tools used in economics that are based on squaring variables (more technically, the [[Euclidean norm|Euclidean]], or [[norm (mathematics)#p-norm|''L''<sup>2</sup> norm]]), such as [[standard deviation]], variance, correlation, regression, or value-at-risk, the kind of stuff you find in textbooks, are not valid scientifically (except in some rare cases where the variable is bounded).

He participated in the [[Manhattan Project]], originated the [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Teller–Ulam design]] of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s, discovered the concept of [[cellular automaton]], invented  the [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo method of computation]], and suggested [[nuclear pulse propulsion]].  In pure and [[applied mathematics]], he proved some theorems and proposed several conjectures.\n\nBorn into a wealthy [[Polish Jewish]] family, Ulam studied mathematics at the [[Lviv Polytechnic#Second Polish Republic|Lwów Polytechnic Institute]], where he earned his [[PhD]] in 1933 under the supervision of [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. In 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he worked to establish important results regarding [[ergodic theory]]. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States for the last time with his 17-year-old brother [[Adam Ulam]]. He became an assistant professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1940, and a [[United States citizen]] in 1941.\n\nIn October 1943, he received an invitation from [[Hans Bethe]] to join the [[Manhattan Project]] at the secret [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico. There, he worked on the [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] calculations to predict the behavior of the [[explosive lens]]es that were needed by an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]]. He was assigned to [[Edward Teller]]'s group, where he worked on [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]] for Teller and [[Enrico Fermi]]. After the war he left to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]], but returned to Los Alamos in 1946 to work on [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]]. With the aid of a cadre of female \"[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|computers]]\", including his wife [[Françoise Aron Ulam]], he found that Teller's \"Super\" design was unworkable. In January 1951, Ulam and Teller came up with the [[Teller–Ulam design]], which is the basis for all thermonuclear weapons.\n\nUlam  considered  the problem of [[nuclear propulsion]] of rockets, which was pursued by [[Project Rover]], and proposed, as an alternative to Rover's [[nuclear thermal rocket]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion, which became [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]. With Fermi, [[John Pasta]], and [[Mary Tsingou]], Ulam studied the [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem]], which became the inspiration for the field of non-linear science. He is probably best known for realising that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the [[Monte Carlo method]] has become a common and standard approach to many problems.\n\n==Poland==\nUlam was born in [[Lviv#Habsburg Empire|Lemberg]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], on 13 April 1909.  At this time, Galicia was in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], known to Poles as the [[Austrian partition]]. In 1918, it became part of the newly restored Poland, the [[Second Polish Republic]], and the city took its Polish name again, [[Lviv#Second Polish Republic|Lwów]].<ref name=\"ULAM 9-15\"/>\n\nThe Ulams were a wealthy [[Polish Jewish]] family of bankers, industrialists, and other professionals.  Ulam's immediate family was \"well-to-do but hardly rich\".<ref name='AULAM'/>  His father, Józef Ulam, was born in Lwów and was a lawyer,<ref name=\"ULAM 9-15\"/> and his mother, Anna (née Auerbach), was born in [[Stryi|Stryj]].<ref name='FAMILY'/>  His uncle, Michał Ulam, was an architect, building contractor, and lumber industrialist.<ref name='MIKE'/>  From 1916 until 1918, Józef's family lived temporarily in [[Vienna]].<ref name='VITA'/>  After they returned, Lwów became the epicenter of the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]], during which the city experienced [[Battle of Lemberg (1918)|a Ukrainian siege]].<ref name=\"ULAM 9-15\"/>\n\n[[File:Lwow - Kawiarnia Szkocka.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Picture of the building that used to house the Scottish Café|The [[Scottish Café]]'s building now houses the Universal Bank in [[Lviv]], Ukraine.|alt=A streetscape, with a neo-gothic greyish-white building with turrets and balconies.]]\nIn 1919, Ulam entered Lwów Gymnasium Nr. VII, from which he graduated in 1927.<ref name='AJMAA'/> He then studied mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute. Under the supervision of [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], he received his [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1932, and became a [[Doctor of Science#Poland|Doctor of Science]] in 1933.<ref name='VITA'/><ref name=zwoje/> At the age of 20, in 1929, he published his first paper ''Concerning Function of Sets'' in the journal ''[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]''.<ref name=zwoje>{{cite journal|author=Andrzej M.

H. Hardy]] and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].<ref name=\"ULAM 56-60\"/>\n\nAlong with [[Stanisław Mazur]], [[Mark Kac]],  [[Włodzimierz Stożek]], Kuratowski, and others, Ulam was a member of the  [[Lwów School of Mathematics]].  Its founders were [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and [[Stefan Banach]], who were professors at the [[University of Lviv#Jan Kazimierz University (1919–39)|Jan Kazimierz University]].  Mathematicians of this \"school\" met for long hours at the [[Scottish Café]], where the problems they discussed were collected in the [[Scottish Book]], a thick notebook provided by Banach's wife.  Ulam was a major contributor to the book.  Of the 193 problems recorded between 1935 and 1941, he contributed 40 problems as a single author, another 11 with Banach and Mazur, and an additional 15 with others.  In 1957, he received from Steinhaus a copy of the book, which had survived the war, and translated it into English.<ref name='BOOK'/>  In 1981, Ulam's friend R. Daniel Maudlin published an expanded and annotated version.<ref name='MAUDLIN'/>\n\n==Coming to the US==\nIn 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], for a few months.  In December of that year, Ulam sailed to the US.  At Princeton, he went to lectures and seminars, where he heard [[Oswald Veblen]], [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]], and [[Albert Einstein]].  During a tea party at von Neumann's house, he encountered [[G. D. Birkhoff]], who suggested that he apply for a position with the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].<ref name='VITA'/> Following up on Birkhoff's suggestion, Ulam spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] from 1936 to 1939, where he worked with [[John C. Oxtoby]] to establish results regarding [[ergodic theory]]. These appeared in [[Annals of Mathematics]] in 1941.<ref name='AJMAA'/><ref name='OXTOBY'/>\n\nOn 20 August 1939, in [[Gdynia]],  Józef Ulam, along with his brother Szymon, put his two sons, Stanislaw and 17 year old [[Adam Ulam|Adam]], on a ship headed for the US.<ref name='VITA'/>  Eleven days later, the [[Invasion of Poland#Phase 1: German invasion|Germans invaded Poland]].   Within two months, the Germans completed their [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation]] of western Poland, and the Soviets [[Invasion of Poland#Phase 2: Soviet invasion|invaded]] and occupied eastern Poland.  Within two years, Józef Ulam and the rest of his family were victims of the [[Holocaust]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]] was in hiding, [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] was lecturing at the [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university]] in Warsaw,  [[Włodzimierz Stożek]] and his two sons had been killed in the [[massacre of Lwów professors]], and the last problem had been recorded in the [[Scottish Book]]. [[Stefan Banach]] survived the Nazi occupation by feeding [[lice]] at [[Rudolf Weigl|Rudolf Weigl's typhus research institute]]. In 1963, [[Adam Ulam]], who had become an eminent [[Kremlinology|kremlinologist]] at Harvard,<ref name='ADAM'/> received a letter from George Volsky,<ref name='VOLSKY'/> who hid in Józef Ulam's house after deserting from the Polish army.  This reminiscence gave a chilling account of Lwów's chaotic scenes in late 1939.<ref name='MOLLY'/> In later life Ulam described himself as \"an agnostic. Sometimes I muse deeply on the forces that are for me invisible. When I am almost close to the idea of God, I feel immediately estranged by the horrors of this world, which he seems to tolerate\".<ref name='OLGIERD'/>\n\nIn 1940, after being recommended by Birkhoff, Ulam became an assistant professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Here, he became a [[United States citizen]] in 1941.<ref name='VITA'/>  That year, he married [[Françoise Aron Ulam|Françoise Aron]].<ref name='AJMAA'/>  She had been a French exchange student at [[Mount Holyoke College]], whom he met in Cambridge.  They had one daughter, Claire.  In Madison, Ulam met his friend and colleague C. J. Everett, with whom he would collaborate on a number of papers.<ref name=\"ULAM 125-130\"/>\n\n==Manhattan Project==\n[[File:Stanislaw Ulam ID badge.png|thumb|200px|Ulam's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] |alt=A mug shot style ID photo, with the serial H 0]]\nIn early 1943, Ulam asked von Neumann to find him a war job.  In October, he received an invitation to join an unidentified project near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref name='VITA'/>  The letter was signed by [[Hans Bethe]], who had been appointed  as leader of the theoretical division  of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by [[Robert Oppenheimer]], its scientific director.<ref name=\"ULAM 143-147\"/> Knowing nothing of the area, he borrowed a New Mexico guide book. On the checkout card, he found the names of his Wisconsin colleagues, [[Joan Hinton]], [[David H. Frisch|David Frisch]], and Joseph McKibben, all of whom had mysteriously disappeared.<ref name='VITA'/>  This was Ulam's introduction to the [[Manhattan Project]], which was US's wartime effort to create the atomic bomb.<ref name='LANLBIO'/>\n\n===Hydrodynamical calculations of implosion===\nA few weeks after Ulam reached [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] in February 1944, the project experienced a crisis.  In April, [[Emilio G. Segrè|Emilio Segrè]] discovered that [[plutonium]] made in [[Nuclear reactors#Early reactors|reactors]] would not work in a [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] plutonium weapon like the \"[[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]\", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the \"[[Little Boy]]\" that was dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima]].  This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the [[Hanford site]] and to make slow [[Isotope separation|separation of uranium isotopes]] the only way to prepare [[fissile]] material suitable for use in bombs.  To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]] and appointed [[George Kistiakowsky]] head of the implosion department.  He was a professor at Harvard and an expert on precise use of explosives.<ref name=\"HODDESON 130-137\"/>\n\nThe basic concept of [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] is to use chemical explosives to crush a chunk of fissile material into a [[critical mass]], where [[neutron]] multiplication leads to a [[nuclear chain reaction]], releasing a large amount of energy.  Cylindrical implosive configurations had been studied by [[Seth Neddermeyer]], but von Neumann, who had experience with [[shaped charges]] used in [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead|armor-piercing ammunition]], was a [[John von Neumann#Nuclear weapons|vocal advocate of spherical implosion]] driven by [[explosive lens]]es.  He realized that the symmetry and speed with which implosion compressed the plutonium were critical issues,<ref name=\"HODDESON 130-137\"/> and enlisted Ulam to help design lens configurations that would provide nearly spherical implosion.  Within an implosion, because of enormous pressures and high temperatures, solid materials behave much like fluids.  This meant that  [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamical]] calculations were needed to predict and minimize asymmetries that would spoil a nuclear detonation.  Of these calculations, Ulam said:{{quote|The hydrodynamical problem was simply stated, but very difficult to calculate&nbsp;– not only in detail, but even in order of magnitude.  In this discussion, I stressed pure pragmatism and the necessity to get a heuristic survey of the problem by simple-minded brute force, rather than by massive numerical work.<ref name='VITA'/>}}\n\nNevertheless,  with the primitive facilities available at the time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations that led to a satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years,<ref name='COMPEARLY'/> continued through the cold war, and still exists.<ref name='COMPLATE'/> [[Otto Frisch]] remembered Ulam as \"a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he told me that he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!\"<ref name='FRISCH'/>\n\n===Statistics of branching and multiplicative processes===\nEven the inherent statistical fluctuations of [[neutron]] multiplication within a [[chain reaction]] have implications with regard to implosion speed and symmetry. In November 1944, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]]<ref name='HAWKINS'/> and Ulam addressed this problem in a report entitled \"Theory of Multiplicative Processes\".<ref name='LA171'/> This report, which invokes [[probability-generating function]]s, is also an early entry in the extensive literature on statistics of [[Branching process|branching]] and multiplicative processes.  In 1948, its scope was extended by Ulam and Everett.<ref name='MULT123'/>\n\nEarly in the Manhattan project, [[Enrico Fermi]]'s attention was focused on the use of reactors to produce plutonium.  In September 1944, he arrived at Los Alamos, shortly after breathing life into the [[Manhattan Project#Hanford reactors|first Hanford reactor]], which had been [[Nuclear poison|poisoned]] by a [[Xenon-135|xenon isotope]].<ref name=\"HEWLETT\"/> Soon after Fermi's arrival, [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]] group, of which Ulam was a part, was transferred to a new division headed by Fermi.<ref name=\"ULAM 152-153\"/> Fermi and Ulam formed a relationship that became very fruitful after the war.<ref name=\"ULAM 162-167\"/>\n\n==Post war Los Alamos==\nIn September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of [[encephalitis]], which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery.  During his recuperation, many friends visited, including [[Nicholas Metropolis]] from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician [[Paul Erdős]],<ref name='ERDOS'/> who remarked: \"Stan, you are just like before.\"<ref name='VITA'/>  This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis.  Another friend, [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and [[biology]]; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for hours on end doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation.<ref name='ROTA'/>  This assertion was not accepted by [[Françoise Aron Ulam]].<ref name='FULAM'/>\n\nBy late April 1946, Ulam had recovered enough to attend a secret conference at Los Alamos to discuss [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]].  Those in attendance included Ulam, von Neumann, Metropolis, Teller, [[Stan Frankel]], and others. Throughout his participation in the Manhattan Project, Teller's efforts had been directed toward the development of a \"super\" weapon based on [[nuclear fusion]], rather than toward development of a practical fission bomb.  After extensive discussion, the participants reached a consensus that his ideas were worthy of further exploration.  A few weeks later, Ulam received an offer of a position at Los Alamos from Metropolis and [[Robert D. Richtmyer]], the new head of its theoretical division, at a higher salary, and the Ulams returned to Los Alamos.<ref name=\"ULAM 184-187\"/>\n\n===Monte Carlo method===\n[[File:STAN ULAM HOLDING THE FERMIAC.jpg|thumb|300px|Stan Ulam Holding the [[FERMIAC]]|alt=A smiling balding man in a suit and tie holds a strange device that looks like a frame]]\nLate in the war, under the sponsorship of von Neumann, Frankel and Metropolis began to carry out calculations on the first general-purpose electronic computer, the [[ENIAC]] at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.  Shortly after returning to Los Alamos, Ulam participated in a review of results from these calculations.<ref name='METROPOLIS'/>  Earlier, while playing [[Patience (game)|solitaire]] during his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome.<ref name='ECKHARDT'/>  With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods very practical. John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March 1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material.<ref name='LAMS551'/>  Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle, Michał Ulam, \"who just had to go to Monte Carlo\" to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach \"The [[Monte Carlo method]]\".<ref name='METROPOLIS'/> Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.<ref name='MONTEPAPER'/>\n\nFermi, learning of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an [[analog computer]] known as the [[Monte Carlo trolley]], later dubbed the [[FERMIAC]]. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern [[massively parallel]] [[supercomputer]]s are [[embarrassingly parallel]] applications, whose results can be very accurate.<ref name='COMPLATE'/>\n\n===Teller–Ulam design===\nOn 29 August 1949, the [[Soviet Union]] tested its first fission bomb, the [[RDS-1]].  Created under the supervision of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who sought to duplicate the US effort, this weapon was nearly identical to [[Fat Man]], for its design was based on information provided by spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]].  In response, on 31 January 1950, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] announced a crash program to develop a fusion bomb.<ref name='DUNCAN'/>\n\nTo advocate an aggressive development program, [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] came to Los Alamos, where they conferred with [[Norris Bradbury]], the laboratory director, and with [[George Gamow]], [[Edward Teller]], and Ulam.  Soon, these three became members of a short-lived committee appointed by Bradbury to study the problem, with Teller as chairman.<ref name='VITA'/>  At this time, research on the use of a fission weapon to create a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]] had been ongoing since 1942, but the design was still essentially the one originally proposed by Teller.   His concept was to put [[tritium]] and/or [[deuterium]] in close proximity to a fission bomb, with the hope that the heat and intense flux of neutrons released when the bomb exploded, would ignite a self-sustaining [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]].  Reactions of these [[isotopes of hydrogen]] are of interest because the energy per unit mass of fuel released by their fusion is much larger than that from fission of heavy nuclei.<ref name=\"RHODES\"/>\n\n[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Ivy Mike]], the first full test of the Teller–Ulam design (a [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged]] fusion bomb), with a [[TNT equivalent|yield]] of 10.4 megatons on 1 November 1952|alt=A mushroom cloud lights up the dawn sky]]\nBecause the results of calculations based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it [[History of the Teller–Ulam design#Teller's \"Super\"|could not lead to a successful weapon]], while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding.  Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer.<ref name= \"HEWLETT AND DUNCAN\"/> To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible.  To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, [[MANIAC I|MANIAC]], at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos.  Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition.  [[Françoise Aron Ulam|Françoise Ulam]] was one of a cadre of women \"[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|computers]]\"  who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on [[mechanical calculator]]s, supplemented and confirmed by Everett's [[slide rule]]. Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios.  The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in [[combinatorics]] to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was much more complicated than the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering.<ref name='GALISON'/>  In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann's results.<ref name='FULAM'/><ref name=\"RHODES 422-424\"/>\n\nIn January 1951, Ulam had another idea: to channel the mechanical shock of a nuclear explosion so as to compress the fusion fuel.  On the recommendation of his wife,<ref name='FULAM'/> Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it.<ref name='MARKBIO'/> Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft [[X-rays]] from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect.  On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations.<ref name='LAMS1225'/>  A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a [[fissile]] rod or cylinder at the center of the fusion fuel.  The detonation of this \"spark plug\"<ref name='LAMS1230'/> would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction.  The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often described as the \"[[Teller–Ulam design]]\".<ref name=\"RHODES 455-464\"/>\n\n[[File:Ivy Mike Sausage device.jpg|thumb|The ''Sausage'' device of [[Ivy Mike|Mike]] nuclear test (yield 10.4 Mt) on [[Enewetak Atoll]]. The test was part of the [[Operation Ivy]]. The Sausage was the first true H-Bomb ever tested, meaning the first [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] device built upon the [[Teller–Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] principles of staged radiation implosion.|alt=Tiny men and a large silver cylindrical object connected to a lot of scaffolding and tubes]]\nIn September 1951, after a series of differences with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago.<ref name=\"HEWLETT AND DUNCAN 554-556\"/> At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester.<ref name=\"ULAM 220-224\"/> Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design<ref name='LAMS1225'/> and jointly applied for a patent on it,<ref name='LANLBIO'/> they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit.<ref name='MARKBIO'/>  After the war, Bethe returned to [[Cornell University]], but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant.  In 1954, he wrote an article on the history of the H-bomb,<ref name='BETHE'/> which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough.  This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role.<ref name = 'UCHII'/> \"After the H-bomb was made,\" Bethe recalled, \"reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the midwife.\"<ref name=SCHWEBER/>\n\nWith the basic fusion reactions confirmed, and with a feasible design in hand, there was nothing to prevent Los Alamos from testing a thermonuclear device.  On 1 November 1952, the first thermonuclear explosion occurred when [[Ivy Mike]] was detonated on [[Enewetak Atoll]], within the US [[Pacific Proving Grounds]].  This device, which used liquid deuterium as its fusion fuel, was immense and utterly unusable as a weapon. Nevertheless, its success validated the Teller–Ulam design, and stimulated intensive development of practical weapons.<ref name=\"ULAM 220-224\"/>\n\n===Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem===\n{{main|Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem}}\nWhen Ulam returned to Los Alamos, his attention turned away from weapon design and toward the use of computers to investigate problems in physics and mathematics.  With [[John Pasta]], who helped Metropolis to bring MANIAC on line in March 1952, he explored these ideas in a report \"Heuristic Studies in Problems of Mathematical Physics on High Speed Computing Machines\", which was submitted on 9 June 1953. It treated several problems that cannot be addressed within the framework of traditional analytic methods: billowing of fluids, rotational motion in gravitating systems, magnetic lines of force, and hydrodynamic instabilities.<ref name='LA1557'/>\n\nSoon, Pasta and Ulam became experienced with electronic computation on MANIAC, and by this time, Enrico Fermi had settled into a routine of spending academic years at the University of Chicago and summers at Los Alamos. During these summer visits, Pasta, Ulam, and [[Mary Tsingou]], a programmer in the MANIAC group, joined him to study a variation of the classic problem of a string of masses held together by springs that exert forces linearly proportional to their displacement from equilibrium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dauxois|first1=Thierry|title=Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and a mysterious lady|journal=Physics Today|date=2008|volume=6|issue=1|pages=55–57|url=http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/thierry.dauxois/PAPERS/pt61_55.2008.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2017|doi=10.1063/1.2835154|arxiv=0801.1590|bibcode=2008PhT....61a..55D}}</ref> Fermi proposed to add to this force a nonlinear component, which could be chosen to be proportional to either the square or cube of the displacement, or to a more complicated \"broken linear\" function. This addition is the key element of the [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem]], which is often designated by the abbreviation FPUT.<ref name='LA1940'/><ref name='FPU'/>\n\nA classical spring system can be described in terms of vibrational modes, which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string. If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop.  With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode  to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes.  This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode.<ref name='FPU'/>  This behavior is very different from the expected [[Equipartition theorem|equipartition of energy]]. It remained mysterious until 1965, when [[Martin David Kruskal|Kruskal]] and [[Norman Zabusky|Zabusky]] showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the system can be described by the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]], which is the prototype of nonlinear [[partial differential equations]] that have [[soliton]] solutions.  This means that FPUT behavior can be understood in terms of solitons.<ref name=\"CHAOS\"/>\n\n===Nuclear propulsion===\n[[File:NASA-project-orion-artist.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An artist's conception of the NASA reference design for the Project Orion spacecraft powered by nuclear propulsion|alt=A painting of a spacecraft passing a Jupiter-like planet]]\nStarting in 1955, Ulam and [[Frederick Reines]] considered [[nuclear propulsion]] of aircraft and rockets.<ref name='LAMS2186'/>  This is an attractive possibility, because the nuclear energy per unit mass of fuel is a million times greater than that available from chemicals.  From 1955 to 1972, their ideas were pursued during [[Project Rover]], which explored the use of nuclear reactors to power rockets.<ref name=\"ULAM 249-254\"/> In response to a question by Senator [[John O. Pastore]] at a congressional committee hearing on \"Outer Space Propulsion by Nuclear Energy\", on January 22, 1958, Ulam replied that \"the future as a whole of mankind is to some extent involved inexorably now with going outside the globe.\"<ref name='HEARING'/>\n\nUlam and C. J. Everett also proposed, in contrast to [[Nuclear thermal rocket|Rover's continuous heating of rocket exhaust]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion.<ref name='LAMS1955'/>  [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] was a study of this idea.  It began in 1958 and ended in 1965, after the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and in space.<ref name='ORION'/>  Work on this project was spearheaded by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]], who commented on the decision to end Orion in his article, \"Death of a Project\".<ref name='DEATH'/>\n\nBradbury appointed Ulam and [[John H. Manley]] as research advisors to the laboratory director in 1957. These newly created positions were on the same administrative level as division leaders, and Ulam held his until he retired from Los Alamos.  In this capacity, he was able to influence and guide programs in many divisions: theoretical, physics, chemistry, metallurgy, weapons, health, Rover, and others.<ref name='ULAM 249-254'/>\n\nIn addition to these activities, Ulam continued to publish technical reports and research papers. One of these introduced the [[Fermi–Ulam model]], an extension of Fermi's theory of [[Fermi acceleration|the acceleration of cosmic rays]].<ref name='FUM'/>  Another, with Paul Stein and [[Mary Tsingou]], titled \"Quadratic Transformations\", was an early investigation of [[chaos theory]] and is considered the first published use of the phrase \"[[chaotic behavior]]\".<ref name='ABRAHAM' /><ref name='LA-2305'/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Return to academia==\n[[File:Ulam 1.png|thumb|300px|When the positive integers are arrayed along the [[Ulam spiral]], prime numbers, represented by dots, tend to collect along diagonal lines.|alt=A lot of dots, but forming diagonal lines]]\nDuring his years at Los Alamos, Ulam was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1951 to 1952, [[MIT]] from 1956 to 1957, the [[University of California, San Diego]], in 1963, and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] from 1961 to 1962 and 1965 to 1967.  In 1967, the last of these positions became permanent, when Ulam was appointed as professor and Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at [[Boulder, Colorado]]. He kept a residence in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which made it convenient to spend summers at Los Alamos as a consultant.<ref name=\"AIP\"/>\n\nIn Colorado, where he rejoined his friends Gamow, Richtmyer, and Hawkins, Ulam's research interests turned toward [[biology]].  In 1968, recognizing this emphasis, the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado School of Medicine]] appointed Ulam as Professor of Biomathematics, and he held this position until his death.  With his Los Alamos colleague  Robert Schrandt he published a report, \"Some Elementary Attempts at Numerical Modeling of Problems Concerning Rates of Evolutionary Processes\", which applied his earlier ideas on branching processes to biological inheritance.<ref name='LA-4246'/>  Another, report, with William Beyer, [[Temple F. Smith]], and M. L. Stein, titled \"Metrics in Biology\", introduced new ideas about biometric distances.<ref name='LA-4973'/>\n\nWhen he retired from Colorado in 1975, Ulam had begun to spend winter semesters at the [[University of Florida]], where he was a graduate research professor. Except for [[sabbatical]]s at the [[University of California, Davis]] from 1982 to 1983, and at [[Rockefeller University]] from 1980 to 1984,<ref name=\"AIP\"/> this pattern of spending summers in Colorado and Los Alamos and winters in Florida continued until Ulam died of an apparent heart attack in Santa Fe on 13 May 1984.<ref name='NYTIMES-OBIT'/>\n[[Paul Erdős]] noted that \"he died suddenly of heart failure, without fear or pain, while he could still prove and conjecture.\"<ref name=\"ERDOS\"/> In 1987, [[Françoise Aron Ulam|Françoise Ulam]]  deposited his papers with the [[American Philosophical Society]] Library in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"PAPERS\"/> She continued to live in Santa Fe until she died on 30 April 2011, at the age of 93. Both Françoise and her husband are buried with her French family in [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name='FULAMOBIT'/><ref name=RB/>\n\n==Challenge to economics==\nAlfred Marshall and his disciples dominated economic theory until the end of WW 2. With the Cold War, the theory changed emphasizing that market economy was superior and the only sensible way. In Paul Samuelson´s “Economics: An Introductory Analysis ”, 1948,  Adam Smith´s “invisible hand” was only a footnote. In later editions is became the central theme. \n\nAs Samuelson <ref>The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, vol. iii, p. 683, MIT Press 1966 </ref> remembers all this was challenged by Stanislaw Ulam: “[Y]ears ago … I was in the Society of Fellows at Harvard along with the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Ulam, who was to become an originator of the Monte Carlo method and co-discoverer of the hydrogen-bomb, … used to tease me by saying, ‘Name me one proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and non-trivial.’ This was the test that I always failed. But now, some thirty years later … an appropriate answer occurs to me: The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage … . That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that it is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them.\" Some of these thousands witnessed that by exchanging wine against cloth their formerly richer countries impoverished because workers can combine and exact higher wages rural laborers and maidservants cannot.   \n\n==Impact and legacy==\nFrom the publication of his first paper as a student in 1929 until his death, Ulam was constantly writing on mathematics.  The list of Ulam's publications includes more than 150 papers.<ref name='AJMAA'/> Topics represented by a significant number of papers are: [[set theory]] (including [[measurable cardinal]]s and abstract [[measure (mathematics)|measures]]), [[topology]], [[Transformation (function)|transformation theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[group theory]], [[Variety (universal algebra)|projective algebra]], [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], and [[graph theory]].<ref name='UPUBS'/> In March 2009, the [[Mathematical Reviews]] database contained 697 papers with the name \"Ulam\".<ref name='UAMS'/>\n\nNotable results of this work are:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]]\n*[[Mazur–Ulam theorem]]\n*[[Kuratowski–Ulam theorem]]\n*[[Hyers–Ulam–Rassias stability]]\n*[[Lucky number]]\n*[[Ulam spiral]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Collatz conjecture|Ulam conjecture]] (in Number Theory)\n*[[Reconstruction conjecture|Ulam conjecture]] (in Graph theory)\n*[[Ulam's packing conjecture]]\n*[[Ulam's game]]\n*[[Ulam matrix]]\n*[[Ulam numbers]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nWith his pivotal role in the development of thermonuclear weapons, Stanislaw Ulam changed the world.   According to Françoise Ulam: \"Stan would reassure me that, barring accidents, the H-bomb rendered nuclear war impossible.\"<ref name=FULAM/> In 1980, Ulam and his wife appeared in the television documentary ''[[The Day After Trinity]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0080594|title=The Day After Trinity}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LuckySieve.gif|thumb|An animation demonstrating the lucky number sieve.

Colleagues noted that some of his greatest contributions were in clearly identifying problems to be solved and general techniques for solving them.<ref name='BIOLOGY'/>\n\nIn 1987, Los Alamos issued a special issue of its ''Science'' publication, which summarized his accomplishments,<ref name='UTRIB'/> and which appeared, in 1989, as the book ''From Cardinals to Chaos''.  Similarly, in 1990, the University of California Press issued a compilation of mathematical reports by Ulam and his Los Alamos collaborators: ''Analogies Between Analogies''.<ref name='ANALOG'/> During his career, Ulam was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]].<ref name='VITA'/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Kac |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Kac |first2=Stanisław |last2=Ulam |title=Mathematics and Logic: Retrospect and Prospects |location=New York |publisher=Praeger |year=1968 |isbn= 978-0-486-67085-0 |oclc=24847821 }}\n*{{cite book|mr=0441664|last=Ulam|first= Stanisław |title=Sets, Numbers, and Universes: selected works|editor1-first= W.

The development tools are available as open source. Binaries  of the current version of OpenBUGS is available for Microsoft Windows, and the previous version for [[Linux]], it can also run under WINE for Linux. Installation problems, development and usage questions are discussed at the OpenBUGS Bulletin Board.\n\nAttempts to port OpenBUGS to [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with the [[Gardens Point Component Pascal]] were given up in favor of a new portable implementation called [[Just another Gibbs sampler|JAGS]].\n\nThe [[BUGS language]] is the language that specifies the model code. It is [[parsing|parse]]d by OpenBUGS, which then creates an [[executable]] (compiled code) that generates a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] from the [[posterior probability|posterior distribution]] when run.\n\nOpenBUGS was designed to run together with [[S-Plus]]<ref>[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/documentation/Download/manual05.pdf BUGS 0.5 Manual, date 1996-08-14]</ref> and the BUGS language is similar to the [[S programming language]]. OpenBUGS works well together with [[R programming language|R]]; the R2OpenBUGS or BRugs packages provides some interoperability, and R modules help further analyses.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.openbugs.net OpenBUGS] Official website.\n\n{{Statistical software}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Free Bayesian statistics software]]\n[[Category:Numerical programming languages]]\n[[Category:Monte Carlo software]]"

The name '''RAMP''' is an acronym standing for '''R'''eliability, '''A'''vailability and '''M'''aintainability of '''P'''rocess systems.\n\nRAMP models reliability using failure [[probability distributions]] for system elements, as well as accounting for [[Common-cause and special-cause#In engineering|common mode failures]].  RAMP models availability using logistic repair delays caused by shortages of [[spare part]]s or [[manpower]], and their associated resource conditions defined for system elements.  RAMP models maintainability using repair probability distributions for system elements, as well as [[preventive maintenance]] data and fixed logistic delays between failure detection and repair commencement.\n\nRAMP consists of two parts:\n\n# RAMP Model Builder.  A front-end interactive [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).\n# RAMP Model Processor.  A back-end [[discrete-event simulation]] that employs the [[Monte Carlo method]].\n\n== RAMP Model Builder ==\nThe RAMP Model Builder enables the user to create a [[block diagram]] describing the dependency of the process being modelled on the state of individual elements in the system.\n\n=== Elements ===\nElements are the basic building blocks of a system modelled in RAMP and can have user-specified failure and repair characteristics in the form probability distributions, typically of [[Mean Time Between Failure]] (MTBF) and [[Mean Time To Repair]] (MTTR) values respectively, chosen from the following:\n\n# [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]]: Defined by scale and shape parameters (or optionally 50th and 95th [[percentiles]] for repairs).\n# [[Negative exponential distribution|Negative exponential]]: Defined by [[mean average]].\n# [[Lognormal]]: Defined by [[median average]] and dispersion (or optionally 50th and 95th percentiles for repairs).\n# Fixed ([[Uniform distribution (continuous)|Uniform]]): Defined by a maximum time to failure or repair.\n# Empirical (user-defined): Defined by a multiplier.\n\nElements can represent any part of a system from a specific [[failure mode]] of a minor component (e.g. isolation valve fails open) to major subsystems (e.g. compressor or power turbine failure) depending on the level and detail of the analysis required.\n\n=== Deterministic elements ===\nRAMP allows the user to define [[deterministic]] elements which are failure free and/or are unrepairable.  These elements may be used to represent parameters of the process (e.g. purity of feedstock or production demand at a particular time) or where necessary in the modelling logic (e.g. to provide conversion factors).\n\n=== Q values ===\nEach element of the model has a user-defined process 'q value' representing a parameter of interest (e.g. mass flow, generation capacity etc.).  Each element is considered to be either operating or not operating and has associated performance values q = Q or q = 0 respectively.  The interpretation of each 'q value' in the model depends on the parameter of interest being modelled, which is typically chosen during the system analysis stage of model design.\n\n=== Groups ===\nElements with interacting functionality can be organised into groups.  Groups can be further combined (to any depth) to produce a Process Dependency Diagram (PDD) of the system, which is similar to a normal [[reliability block diagram]] (RBD) commonly used in [[reliability engineering]], but also allows complex logical relationships between groups and elements to permit a more accurate representation of the process being modelled.  The PDD should not be confused with a [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]] since it describes dependency, not flow.  For example, an element may appear in more than one position in the PDD if this is required to represent the true dependency of the process on that element.  Groups may also be shown in full or may be compressed to allow the screen to show other areas to greater resolution.\n\n=== Group types ===\nEach group can be one of eleven group types, each with its own rule for combining 'q values' of elements and/or other groups within it to produce a 'q value' output.  Groups thus define how the behaviour of each element affects the reliability, availability, maintainability and productivity of the system.  The eleven group types are divided into two classes:\n\nFive 'Flow' group types:\n\n# Minimum (M): qM = min[q1, q2,...qn]\n# Active Redundant (A): qA = min[Rating, (q1 + q2 + ... + qn)] unless qA < Cut-off, then qA = 0\n# Standby Redundant (S): qS = as for Active Redundant, but where the first component is always assumed to be duty equipment.\n# Time (T): qT = 0 if component with 'q value' q1 is in a \"down\" state when time through mission t < t0, otherwise qT = q1 + ... + qm if component with 'q value' q1 is in an \"up\" state when time t ≥ t0 + (m-1) x Time Delay, where m = 1 to n.\n# Buffer (B): if the buffer is not empty qB = q2 else qB = min[q1,q2], where the buffer empties as output if component with 'q value' q2 is in an \"up\" state with level at time 0 = Initial Level, otherwise level at time t = level at time (t-1) - (q2 - q1), and the buffer fills as input if component with 'q value' q2 is in a \"down\" state with level at time 0 = Initial Level, otherwise level at time t = Capacity if level at time (t-1) + q1 > C, otherwise level at time t = level at time (t-1) + (q2 - q1). Buffer input and output may also be limited by buffer constraints.\n\nSix 'Logic' group types:\n\n# Product (P): qP = q1 x q2 x ... x qn\n# Quotient (Q): pQ = q1 / q2\n# Conditionally Greater Than (G): if q1 > q2 then qG = q1 else qG = 0\n# Conditionally Less Than (L): if q1 < q2 then qG = q1 else qG = 0\n# Difference (D): max[q1 - q2, 0]\n# Equality (E): q1 if q1 lies outside the range PA to PB, q2 if q1 lies inside the range PA to PB\n\nThree group types (Active Redundant, Standby Redundant and Time) are displayed in parallel configurations (vertically down the screen).  All others are displayed in series configurations (horizontally across the screen).\n\nSix group types (Buffer, Quotient, Conditionally Greater Than, Conditionally Less Than, Difference and Equality) contain exactly two components with 'q values' q1 and q2. All others contain two or more components with 'q values' q1, q2 to qn.\n\n=== Element states ===\nAn element may be in one of five possible states and its 'q value' is determined by its state:\n\n# Undergoing [[preventive maintenance]] (''q'' = 0).\n# Being repaired following failure, including queueing for repair (''q'' = 0).\n# Failed but undetected, dormant failure (''q'' = 0). (e.g. standby equipment unavailable in the event of failure of duty equipment.  Thus a problem may not be apparent until a failure of the duty equipment occurs.)\n# Up but passive, available but not being used (''q'' = 0). (e.g. standby equipment available in the event of failure of duty equipment.)\n# Up and active, being used (''q'' = ''Q'' > 0). (i.e. operating as intended.)\n\nOccurrence of a state transition for an element is determined largely by the user-defined parameters for that element (i.e. its failure and repair distributions and any preventive maintenance cycles).\n\n=== Element resource and repair conditions ===\nThere is often a time delay between an element failing and the commencement of repair of the element. This may be caused by a lack of spare parts, the unavailability of manpower or the element cannot be repaired due to dependencies on other elements (e.g. a pump cannot be repaired because the isolating valve is defective and cannot be closed). In all of these cases, the element must be queued for repair.  RAMP allows the user to define multiple resource conditions per element, all of which must be satisfied to allow a repair to be commenced.  Each resource condition is one of five types:\n\n# Repair Trade: a specified number of a repair trade must be available.\n# Spare: a specified number of a spare part must be available.\n# Group Q Value: a specified group must satisfy a condition regarding its 'q value'.\n# Buffer Level: a specified buffer must satisfy a condition regarding its level.\n# Element State: a specified element must satisfy a condition regarding its state.\n\n==== Repair trades repair condition ====\nRepair trades can be specified for the repair of any element, and they represent manpower in the form of a set of skilled maintenance workers with a particular trade.  A repair trade can be used for the duration of an element repair (i.e. logistic delay plus a time value drawn from the element repair distribution).  On completion of the repair, the Repair Trade becomes available to repair another element.  the number of repairs which can be performed simultaneously for elements requiring a particular repair trade depends on the number of repair trade resources allocated and the number of that repair trade specified as a requirement for the repair.\n\n==== Spares repair condition ====\nIf a spare part is required for an element repair, then the spare part is withdrawn from stock at the instant the repair commences (i.e. as soon as the element leaves the repair queue).  The maximum number of spare parts of each type that may be held in stock is user-defined.  The stock may either be replenished periodically at a user-defined time interval, or when the stock falls below a user-defined level, in which case RAMP allows a user-defined a time delay that must occur between reordering and the actual replenishment of the stock.\n\n==== Group Q value repair condition ====\nRAMP allows the user to specify that an element cannot be repaired until the 'q value' of a nominated group satisfies one of six conditions (>, ≥, <, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.  These conditions may be used to model certain rules in a system (e.g. a pump cannot be repaired until a tank is empty).\n\n==== Buffer level repair condition ====\nSpecifying a buffer level constraint means that preventive maintenance of an element can be restricted until the buffer level of a nominated buffer group satisfies one of six conditions (>, ≥, <, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.  These conditions may be used to model certain rules in a system (e.g. it may be a requirement for maintenance of a submersible pump that the tank it is in should be empty before repair work commences).\n\n==== Element state repair condition ====\nRAMP allows the user to specify that an element cannot be repaired until the state of another nominated element satisfies one of six conditions (>, ≥, <, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.\n\n=== Repair policy ===\nEach element has user-defined parameters that can affect how it is repaired:\n\n# Logistic repair delay: A time period that must elapse before a repair can start on an element.  It is a fixed time that is added to the repair time sampled from the user-defined repair probability distribution for the element.  Typically, it represents a combination of the time taken for the repair team to reach the site of failure, time to isolate the failed item, and time taken to obtain the required spare part from store.\n# Repair 'good-as-new' or 'bad-as-old': Refers to the failure rate of an element rather than its 'q-value'.  By default an element is restored to 'good-as-new' following repair, but there is an option to toggle a 'bad-as-old' state that simulates a quick-fix equivalent to restoring the element to the beginning of the wear-out phase of a Weibull bathtub curve, should a Weibull probability distribution with shape greater than one be used for repairs.\n# Repair priority: Used only if element resource and repair conditions are specified (i.e. it is only used if an element has to queue for repair rather than going directly for repair).  The purpose of this field is to help determine the sequence in which elements are drawn from the repair queue as resources become available for element repair.  Elements are repaired according to their repair priority, where 1 is highest priority, 2 is next highest, and so on.  Elements with the same priority are repaired on a 'first come first served' basis.\n\nIn addition, each element in a Standby Redundant group has more parameters that can affect how it is repaired:\n\n# Passive failure rate factor: Factor by which the element failure rate is multiplied when operating in the passive state as opposed to the active state.  By default this factor will be one and typically between zero and one, indicating a lower passive failure rate than active failure rate.\n# Probability of switching failure: Percentage probability that the element will fail when switched from the passive state into the active state.  If such a switching failure occurs, the element must be repaired in the normal way before it can be used again.\n# Startup delay: Startup of the element going from a passive state to an active state is delayed by a specified time.\n\n==== Preventive maintenance ====\nRAMP allows the user to model preventive maintenance for each system element by cycles expressed using the three parameters 'up-time'. 'down-time' and 'down-time' start time.  RAMP also has an option to toggle 'intelligent preventive maintenance' on each system element, which attempts to improve system performance by doing preventive maintenance when the element is already in 'down-time' for other reasons.\n\n=== Common mode failures ===\nCommon mode failures (CMFs) that cause a number of elements to fail at the same time (e.g. due to the occurrence of a fire or some other catastrophic event, or the failure of a power supply that provides power to several separately defined elements).  RAMP allows the user to define CMFs by stating the set of affected elements and the frequency distribution for occurrences of the CMF.  When a CMF occurs, any elements which are affected by that particular CMF are placed in the failed state and must be repaired, being queued for repair if necessary. Any elements failed by a CMF will be repaired according to the repair distribution defined for that element.  Elements which are already being repaired, are in the repair queue, or are undergoing preventive maintenance remain unaffected by the occurrence of an associated CMF.\n\n=== Criticalities ===\nThe criticality of an element is a measure of how much the element has affected the 'q value' (i.e. performance) of the group to which it belongs.  Elements with a high criticality cause more 'down-time' or unavailability on average and are thus critical to the performance of the group.  The criticality of an element may vary according to the level of the group (e.g. a motor failure may have a very high criticality for a group that contains failure modes for one pump, but a very low criticality for a group that contains several redundant pumps).\n\n=== Time units ===\nRAMP allows the user to set the time unit of interest, according to scale and fidelity considerations.  The only requirement is that time units should be used consistently across a model to avoid misleading results.  Time units are expressed in the following input data:\n\n# Element failure probability distributions.\n# Element repair probability distributions.\n# Element logistic delay times (before repair).\n# Element preventive maintenance 'up-times', 'down-times' and start points.\n# Common mode failure probability distributions.\n# Percentile times in empirical probability distributions (for failure or repair).\n# Delay times in Time groups.\n# Spare part replenishment intervals or re-order delay times.\n# Rolling average span and increment.\n# Histogram 'down-times'.\n# Simulated time period of interest.\n\n=== Element types ===\nElements that are assumed to have the same failure and repair characteristics and share a common pool of spare parts can be assigned the same user-defined element type (i.e. pump, motor, tank etc.).  This allows for faster construction of complex systems containing many elements that are similar in function since the entry of element data does not need to be repeated for such elements.\n\n=== Import functionality ===\nPreviously built systems can be imported as subsystems of the system currently displayed.  This allows for faster construction of complex systems containing many subsystems since they can be constructed in parallel by multiple users before being imported into a common system.\n\n== RAMP Model Processor ==\nThe RAMP Model Processor mimics the system operating over the time period of interest - known in RAMP as a mission - by sampling failure and repair times from probability distributions (with probabilities drawn from a [[pseudo-random number generator]]) and combining with other data defined in the RAMP Model Builder to determine state transition events for each element in the model.  The simulation uses discrete events that are queued in chronological order with each event being processed in turn to determine the states and thus the 'q values' of every element in the model at that discrete point in time.  Group combination rules are used to determine the 'q values' at successively higher levels of groups, culminating in 'q values' of the outermost groups that when averaged over the events of the simulation typically provide performance measures of the system, which are output in model results in terms of the chosen parameters of interest.\n\nBy running enough missions over the same time period of interest (different possible histories from the same starting point), RAMP can be used to generate [[statistically significant]] results that establish the likely distribution of the user-defined parameters of interest and thus objectively assess the system, with the confidence bands on the results dependent on the number of missions simulated.  On the other hand, by running a mission length that is long in comparison with the failure frequencies and repair times, and simulating only one mission, RAMP can be used to establish the [[steady-state]] performance of the system.\n\n== History of RAMP ==\nRAMP was originally developed by Rex Thompson & Partners Ltd. in the mid-1980s as an availability simulation program, primarily used for plant and process modelling.<ref>http://rams.chez.com/TOOL_2.html</ref>  The ownership of RAMP was transferred to T.A.

This is what is measured in an [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] experiment. The density may be portrayed in terms of an isosurface (isodensity surface) with the size and shape of the surface being given by the value (or percentage of enclosure) of the electron density.\n**[[Spin density]] - The density, ρ<sup>spin</sup>(''r''), is defined as the difference in electron density formed by electrons of α spin, ρα(''r''), and the electron density formed by electrons of β spin, ρβ(''r''). For closed-shell molecules (in which all electrons are paired), the spin density is zero everywhere. For open-shell molecules (in which one or more electrons are unpaired), the spin density indicates the distribution of unpaired electrons. Spin density is an indicator of reactivity of radicals.<ref name=\"GuideBook\" />\n**[[Van der Waals radius]] (surface)\n**Solvent [[accessible surface area]]\n**[[Electric potential|Electrostatic potential]] - The potential, ''ε<sub>p</sub>'', is defined as the energy of interaction of a positive point charge located at p with the nuclei and electrons of a molecule. A surface for which the electrostatic potential is negative (a negative potential surface) delineates regions in a molecule which are subject to electrophilic attack.\n*''Composite surfaces (maps)'':\n**Electrostatic potential map (electrophilic indicator) - The most commonly employed property map is the electrostatic potential map. This gives the potential at locations on a particular surface, most commonly a surface of electron density corresponding to overall molecular size.<ref name=\"Spartan manual\" />\n**Local ionization potential map - Is defined as the sum over orbital electron densities, ρi(''r'') times absolute orbital energies, ∈i, and divided by the total electron density, ρ(''r''). The local ionization potential reflects the relative ease of electron removal (\"ionization\") at any location around a molecule. For example, a surface of \"low\" local ionization potential for sulfur tetrafluoride demarks the areas which are most easily ionized.\n**LUMO map (nucleophilic indicator) - Maps of molecular orbitals may also lead to graphical indicators. For example, the ''LUMO map'', wherein the (absolute value) of the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (the LUMO) is mapped onto a size surface (again, most commonly the [[electron]] density), providing an indication of nucleophilic reactivity.\n\n==Spectral calculations==\n[[Image:IR Spectra phenyl 9-acridinecarboxylate.PNG|thumb|right|The calculated (DFT/EDF2/6-31G*) IR spectra (red), scaled and optimized to the experimental FT-IR spectra (blue) of phenyl 9-acridinecarboxylate (below).]]\n{{multiple image\n |width   = 107\n |footer  = The molecule phenyl 9-acridinecarboxylate.\n |image1  = Phenyl 9-acridinecarboxylate 2D.PNG\n |caption1= 2D rendering\n |image2  = Phenyl 9-acridinecarboxylate 3D.png\n |caption2= 3D rendering}}\n\nAvailable spectra data and plots for:\n*''[[Infrared spectroscopy]] (IR) spectra''\n**[[Fourier transform spectroscopy]] (FT-IR)<ref>{{cite journal |title= Harmonic Vibrational Frequencies:  An Evaluation of Hartree−Fock, Møller−Plesset, Quadratic Configuration Interaction, Density Functional Theory, and Semiempirical Scale Factors |author1=Anthony P.

By default, CompHEP includes the [[Standard Model]] Lagrangian in the unitarity and 't Hooft-Feynman gauges and several [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|MSSM]] models. However users can create new physical models, based on different Lagrangians. There is a special tool for that - [[LanHEP]]. CompHEP is able to compute basically the LO cross sections and distributions with several particles in the final state (up to 6-7). It can take into account, if necessary, all [[QCD]] and [[Electroweak|EW]] diagrams, masses of [[fermions]] and [[bosons]] and widths of unstable particles. Processes computed by means of CompHEP can be interfaced to the [[Monte-Carlo]] generators [[PYTHIA]] and [[HERWIG]] as new external processes.\n\nThe CompHEP project started in 1989 in Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) of [[Moscow State University]]. During the 90’s this package was developed, and now it is a powerful tool for automatic computations of collision processes. The CompHEP program has been used in the past for lots of different studies in many experimental groups as shown schematically in the scheme\n\nDue to an intuitive graphical interface CompHEP is a very useful tool for education in particle and nuclear physics.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://comphep.sinp.msu.ru official CompHEP page]\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9908288 manual for version 3.3]\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0403113 main journal reference]: Nucl.Instrum.Meth.A534:250 (2004)\n* [http://www.npi.msu.su/eng/sinp.php3 Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP)] \n\n[[Category:Monte Carlo particle physics software]]\n[[Category:Computational physics]]\n[[Category:Physics software]]"

The name is an [[acronym]] formed from \"GEometry ANd Tracking\".  Originally developed at [[CERN]] for [[high energy physics]] experiments, GEANT-3 has been used in many other fields.\n\n==History==\nThe very first version of GEANT dates back to 1974,<ref>{{cite web|title=Geant: Simulation Program for Particle Physics Experiments. User Guide and Reference Manual|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/118715?ln=en}}</ref> while the first version of GEANT-3 dates back to 1982 [http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/geant_html3/node2.html#SECTION01000000000000000000000].  Versions of GEANT through 3.21 were written in [[FORTRAN]] and eventually maintained as part of [[CERNLIB]].  Since about 2000, the last FORTRAN release has been essentially in stasis and receives only occasional bug fixes.  GEANT3 was, however, still in use by some experiments.  Most of GEANT-3 is available [http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/conditions.html] under the [[GNU General Public License]], with the exception [http://www.fluka.org/Faq.html] of some hadronic interaction code contributed by the [[FLUKA]] collaboration.\n\nGEANT-3 was used by a majority of High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The largest experiments using were three of the experiments at the [[Large Electron-Positron collider]], including [[ALEPH_experiment|ALEPH]], [[L3_experiment|L3]] and [[OPAL_experiment|OPAL]].  It was also a key tool in the design and optimization of the detectors of all experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - see e.g. the ATLAS [http://cds.cern.ch/record/391176?ln=en Technical Design Report]. GEANT-3.21 based programs remained main simulation engine of ATLAS, CMS and LHCb at LHC until 2004, when these experiments moved to Geant4-based simulations. Even in 2019 it remains the primary simulation tool for the ALICE experiment at the LHC.\n\nA related (but separate) product is [[Geant4]] (when referring to this version, the name is typically no longer capitalized).  It is a [[Rewrite (programming)|complete rewrite]] in [[C++]] with a modern [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] design.  Geant4 was developed by the RD44 collaboration in 1994-1998 and is being maintained and improved now by the Geant4 international collaboration.  For quite some time Geant4 did not have a clearly defined software license.  As of version 8.1 (released June 30, 2006) this omission has been remedied.  Geant4 is now available under the [http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/license/LICENSE.html Geant4 Software License].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geant4]]\n* [[EGS (program)]]\n* [[CLHEP]] and [[FreeHEP]], libraries for high energy physics\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://geant4.cern.ch/ Geant4] publicly accessible webpage\n* [http://wwwasd.web.cern.ch/wwwasd/geant/ GEANT] webpage at CERN (only available to CERN users)\n\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Fortran]]\n[[Category:Monte Carlo particle physics software]]\n[[Category:Physics software]]\n[[Category:CERN software]]"

}}</ref> (for '''GEometry ANd Tracking''') is a [[Platform (computing)|platform]] for \"the [[simulation]] of the passage of [[Elementary particle|particle]]s through [[matter]]\" using [[Monte Carlo methods]].  It is the successor of the [[GEANT (program)|GEANT]] series of software toolkits developed by [[CERN]], and the first to use [[object oriented programming]] (in [[C++]]).  Its development, maintenance and user support are taken care by the international [http://geant4.org/ Geant4 Collaboration].  Application areas include [[high energy physics]] and [[nuclear reaction|nuclear]] [[experiment]]s, [[Medical Physics|medical]], [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] and [[space physics]] studies.<ref name=\"geant4-2\"/>  The software is used by a number of research projects around the world.\n\nThe Geant4 software and source code is freely available from the project web site; until version 8.1 (released June 30, 2006),  no specific software license for its use existed; Geant4 is now provided under the [https://geant4.web.cern.ch/license/LICENSE.html Geant4 Software License].\n\n== Features ==\nGeant4 includes facilities for handling [[geometry]], tracking, [[particle detector|detector]] response, run management, visualization and [[user interface]].  For many physics simulations, this means less time needs to be spent on the low level details, and researchers can start immediately on the more important aspects of the simulation.\n\nFollowing is a summary of each of the facilities listed above:\n* ''Geometry'' is an analysis of the physical layout of the experiment, including detectors, [[absorber]]s, etc., and considering how this layout will affect the path of particles in the experiment.\n* ''Tracking'' is simulating the passage of a particle through matter.  This involves considering possible [[interaction]]s and [[Radioactive decay|decay]] processes.\n* ''Detector response'' is recording when a particle passes through the volume of a detector, and approximating how a real detector would respond.\n* ''Run management'' is recording the details of each ''run'' (a set of ''events''), as well as setting up the experiment in different configurations between runs.\n* Geant4 offers a number of options for ''visualization'', including [[OpenGL]], and a familiar ''user interface'', based on [[Tcsh]].\n\nGeant4 can also perform basic histogramming; it requires external analysis tools or software that implements the [[AIDA (computing)|AIDA]] framework for exploiting advanced histogramming features.\n\nSince release 10.0, Geant4 implements [[thread (computing)|multithreading]],<ref name=\"geant4-3\"/> making use of  [[thread-local storage]] to allow for efficient generation of simulated events in parallel. There is not yet support for multithreading under Windows; GEANT4 must be installed under a Unix-based operating system such as MacOS or Ubuntu if multithreading is required.\n\n== Some high energy physics experiments using Geant4 ==\n* [[BaBar Experiment|BaBar]] and GLAST at [[SLAC]]\n* [[A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] and [[LHCb]] at [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], [[CERN]]\n* [[COMPASS_experiment|COMPASS]] at [[Super_Proton_Synchrotron|SPS]], [[CERN]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071016122025/http://borex.lngs.infn.it/ Borexino] at [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso Laboratory]]\n* [[Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment|DUNE]], [[MINOS]], and [[Mu2e]] at [[Fermilab]]\n* [[Enriched Xenon Observatory]] (EXO)\n* [[SNO+]]\n* [[T2K]]\n* [[CUORE]]\n* Dark Matter Detectors: [[Cryogenic_Dark_Matter_Search|SuperCDMS]], [[Large Underground Xenon experiment|LUX]], [[XENON]]\n\n== Applications outside high energy physics ==\n[[Image:RREA Monte Carlo simulation.png|thumb|right|400px|GEANT4 simulation of relativistic electron avalanche driven by an electric field in air as might occur in thunderstorms and lightning.]]\nBecause of its general purpose nature, Geant4 is well suited for development of computational tools for analysing interactions of particle with matter in many areas.

E. P.|last2=Muller|first2=Mervin E.|year=1958}}</ref> is a [[pseudo-random number sampling]] method for generating pairs of [[statistical independence|independent]], standard, [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] (zero [[expected value|expectation]], unit [[variance]]) random numbers, given a source of [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] random numbers. The method was in fact first mentioned explicitly by [[Raymond Paley|Raymond E. A. C. Paley]] and [[Norbert Wiener]] in 1934.<ref>Raymond E. A. C. Paley and Norbert Wiener ''Fourier Transforms in the Complex Domain,'' New York: American Mathematical Society (1934) §37.</ref>\n\nThe Box–Muller transform is commonly expressed in two forms. The basic form as given by Box and Muller takes two samples from the uniform distribution on the interval <nowiki>[0,&nbsp;1]</nowiki> and maps them to two standard, normally distributed samples.  The polar form takes two samples from a different interval, [−1,&nbsp;+1], and maps them to two normally distributed samples without the use of sine or cosine functions.\n\nThe Box–Muller transform was developed as a more computationally efficient alternative to the [[inverse transform sampling method]].<ref>Kloeden and Platen, ''Numerical Solutions of Stochastic Differential Equations'', pp. 11–12</ref> The [[ziggurat algorithm]] gives a more efficient method for CPU, while the Box-Muller transform is superior for GPU<ref>{{harvnb|Howes|Thomas|2008}}.</ref>.

In the special case of two degrees of freedom, the chi-squared distribution coincides with the [[exponential distribution]], and the equation for ''R''<sup>2</sup> above is a simple way of generating the required exponential variate.\n\n== Polar form ==\n{{main|Marsaglia polar method}}\n[[Image:BoxMullerTransformUsingPolarCoordinates.png|thumb|400px|Two uniformly distributed values, ''u'' and ''v'' are used to produce the value {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} ''R''<sup>2</sup>}}, which is likewise uniformly distributed.

Because ''u'' and ''v'' are uniformly distributed and because only points within the unit circle have been admitted, the values of ''s'' will be uniformly distributed in the open interval (0,&nbsp;1), too.  The latter can be seen by calculating the cumulative distribution function for ''s'' in the interval (0,&nbsp;1).  This is the area of a circle with radius <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{s}</math>, divided by <math>\\scriptstyle\\pi</math>. From this we find the probability density function to have the constant value 1 on the interval (0,&nbsp;1). Equally so, the angle θ divided by <math>\\scriptstyle 2 \\pi</math> is uniformly distributed in the interval [0,&nbsp;1) and independent of ''s''.\n\nWe now identify the value of ''s'' with that of ''U''<sub>1</sub> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\theta/(2 \\pi)</math> with that of ''U''<sub>2</sub> in the basic form.  As shown in the figure, the values of <math>\\scriptstyle \\cos \\theta = \\cos 2 \\pi U_2</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\sin \\theta = \\sin 2 \\pi U_2</math> in the basic form can be replaced with the ratios <math>\\scriptstyle\\cos \\theta = u/R = u/\\sqrt{s}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle\\sin \\theta = v/R = v/\\sqrt{s}</math>, respectively.  The advantage is that calculating the trigonometric functions directly can be avoided.  This is helpful when trigonometric functions are more expensive to compute than the single division that replaces each one.\n\nJust as the basic form produces two standard normal deviates, so does this alternate calculation.\n\n:<math>z_0 = \\sqrt{-2 \\ln U_1} \\cos(2 \\pi U_2) = \\sqrt{-2 \\ln s} \\left(\\frac{u}{\\sqrt{s}}\\right) = u \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{-2 \\ln s}{s}}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>z_1 = \\sqrt{-2 \\ln U_1} \\sin(2 \\pi U_2) = \\sqrt{-2 \\ln s}\\left( \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{s}}\\right) = v \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{-2 \\ln s}{s}}.</math>\n\n==Contrasting the two forms==\n\nThe polar method differs from the basic method in that it is a type of [[rejection sampling]].  It discards some generated random numbers, but can be faster than the basic method because it is simpler to compute (provided that the random number generator is relatively fast) and is more numerically robust.<ref name=\"Carter\">[ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/publications/randnum.tar.Z Everett F. Carter, Jr., ''The Generation and Application of Random Numbers'', Forth Dimensions (1994), Vol. 16, No. 1 & 2.]</ref>  It avoids the use of trigonometric functions, which can be expensive in some computing environments{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. It discards {{nowrap|1 − {{pi}}/4 ≈ 21.46%}} of the total input uniformly distributed random number pairs generated, i.e. discards {{nowrap|4/{{pi}} − 1 ≈ 27.32%}} uniformly distributed random number pairs per [[normal distribution|Gaussian]] random number pair generated, requiring {{nowrap|4/{{pi}} ≈ 1.2732}} input random numbers per output random number.\n\nThe basic form requires two multiplications, 1/2 logarithm, 1/2 square root, and one trigonometric function for each normal variate.<ref>Note that the evaluation of 2{{pi}}''U''<sub>1</sub> is counted as one multiplication because the value of 2{{pi}} can be computed in advance and used repeatedly.</ref> On some processors, the cosine and sine of the same argument can be calculated in parallel using a single instruction. Notably for Intel-based machines, one can use the fsincos assembler instruction or the expi instruction (usually available from C as an [[intrinsic function]]), to calculate complex\n\n: <math>\\exp(iz) = e^{i z} = \\cos z + i \\sin z, \\, </math>\n\nand just separate the real and imaginary parts.\n\n'''Note:''' \nTo explicitly calculate the complex-polar form use the following substitutions in the general form,\n\nLet <math> r = \\sqrt{-2 \\ln(u_1)} </math> and <math> z = 2 \\pi u_2. </math> Then\n\n: <math> re^{i z} = \\sqrt{-2 \\ln(u_1)} e^{i 2 \\pi u_2} =\\sqrt{-2 \\ln(u_1)}\\left[ \\cos(2 \\pi u_2) + i \\sin(2 \\pi u_2)\\right].</math>\n\nThe polar form requires 3/2 multiplications, 1/2 logarithm, 1/2 square root, and 1/2 division for each normal variate.  The effect is to replace one multiplication and one trigonometric function with a single division and a conditional loop.\n\nIt should be noted that fsincos has become very fast in modern CPU architectures, such that the speed \"benefit\" of the rejection sampling method is no longer factual. Meanwhile, the floating-point division by&nbsp;''s'', and the conditional loop, both remain a significant expense in the rejection sampling algorithm, which are not present in the basic form.\n\n==Tails truncation==\nWhen a computer is used to produce a uniform random variable it will inevitably have some inaccuracies because there is a lower bound on how close numbers can be to 0. If the generator uses 32 bits per output value, the smallest non-zero number that can be generated is <math>2^{-32}</math>. When <math>U_1</math> and <math>U_2</math> are equal to this the Box–Muller transform produces a normal random variable equal to <math>\\sqrt{-2 \\ln(2^{-32})} \\cos(2 \\pi 2^{-32})\\approx 6.66</math>\nThis means that the algorithm will not produce random variables more than 6.66 standard deviations from the mean. This corresponds to a proportion of <math>2.74 \\times 10^{-11} </math> lost due to the truncation.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThe standard Box–Muller transform generates values from the standard normal distribution (''i.e.'' [[standard normal deviate]]s) with mean ''0'' and standard deviation ''1''. The implementation below in standard [[C++]] generates values from any normal distribution with mean <math>\\mu</math> and variance <math>\\sigma^2</math>.  If <math>Z</math> is a standard normal deviate, then <math>X = Z\\sigma + \\mu</math> will have a normal distribution with mean <math>\\mu</math> and standard deviation <math>\\sigma</math>.  Note that because the random number generator <code>rand</code> has not been [[Random seed|seeded]], the same series of values will always be returned from the <code>generateGaussianNoise</code> function.\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <limits>\ndouble generateGaussianNoise(double mu, double sigma)\n{\n\tstatic const double epsilon = std::numeric_limits<double>::min();\n\tstatic const double two_pi = 2.0*3.14159265358979323846;\n\n\tthread_local double z1;\n\tthread_local bool generate;\n\tgenerate = !generate;\n\n\tif (!generate)\n\t   return z1 * sigma + mu;\n\n\tdouble u1, u2;\n\tdo\n\t {\n\t   u1 = rand() * (1.0 / RAND_MAX);\n\t   u2 = rand() * (1.0 / RAND_MAX);\n\t }\n\twhile ( u1 <= epsilon );\n\n\tdouble z0;\n\tz0 = sqrt(-2.0 * log(u1)) * cos(two_pi * u2);\n\tz1 = sqrt(-2.0 * log(u1)) * sin(two_pi * u2);\n\treturn z0 * sigma + mu;\n}\n</source>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Inverse transform sampling]]\n* [[Marsaglia polar method]], similar transform to Box-Muller, which uses Cartesian coordinates, instead of polar coordinates\n\n==References==\n<!--do not reduce font sizes, the Wiki style sheets control presentation-->\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Howes\n | first = Lee\n | last2 = Thomas\n | first2 = David\n | title = GPU Gems 3 - Efficient Random Number Generation and Application Using CUDA\n | publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 978-0-321-51526-1\n | ref = harv\n}}\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=Box-MullerTransformation|title=Box-Muller Transformation}}\n* [https://cockrum.net/code.html#TrueRNG_gaussian How to Convert a Uniform Distribution to a Gaussian Distribution (C Code)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Box-Muller Transform}}\n[[Category:Transforms]]\n[[Category:Non-uniform random numbers]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C++ code]]"

Computational algorithms are then used to manipulate a single [[random variate]], ''X'', or often several such variates, into a new random variate ''Y'' such that these values have the required distribution.\n\nHistorically, basic methods of pseudo-random number sampling were developed for [[Monte-Carlo method|Monte-Carlo simulations]] in the [[Manhattan project]];{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} they were first published by [[John von Neumann]] in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Various Techniques Used in Connection with Random Digits |first=John |last=Von Neumann |authorlink=John von Neumann |year=1951 |journal=[[Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards]], Applied Mathematics Series |volume=3 |pages=36–38 |url=https://mcnp.lanl.gov/pdf_files/nbs_vonneumann.pdf |quote=Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is of course, in a state of sin.}}  Also online is a [https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/520/docs/VonNeumann-ams12p36-38.pdf low-quality scan of the original publication].</ref>\n\n== Finite discrete distributions ==\n\nFor a [[discrete probability distribution]] with a finite number ''n'' of indices at which the [[probability mass function]] ''f'' takes non-zero values, the basic sampling algorithm is straightforward.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm",
      "text": "The '''ziggurat algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[pseudo-random number sampling]].  Belonging to the class of [[rejection sampling]] algorithms, it relies on an underlying source of uniformly-distributed random numbers, typically from a [[pseudo-random number generator]], as well as precomputed tables.  The algorithm is used to generate values from a [[Monotonic function|monotone decreasing]] [[probability distribution]].  It can also be applied to [[Symmetric function|symmetric]] [[unimodal distribution]]s, such as the [[normal distribution]], by choosing a value from one half of the distribution and then randomly choosing which half the value is considered to have been drawn from.  It was developed by [[George Marsaglia]] and others in the 1960s.\n\nA typical value produced by the algorithm only requires the generation of one random floating-point value and one random table index, followed by one table lookup, one multiply operation and one comparison. Sometimes (2.5% of the time, in the case of a normal or [[exponential distribution]] when using typical table sizes){{citation needed|date=September 2011}} more computations are required. Nevertheless, the algorithm is computationally much faster than the two most commonly used methods of generating normally distributed random numbers, the [[Marsaglia polar method]] and the [[Box–Muller transform]], which require at least one logarithm and one square root calculation for each pair of generated values.  However, since the ziggurat algorithm is more complex to implement it is best used when large quantities of random numbers are required.\n\nThe term ''ziggurat algorithm'' dates from Marsaglia's paper with Wai Wan Tsang in 2000; it is so named because it is conceptually based on covering the probability distribution with rectangular segments stacked in decreasing order of size, resulting in a figure that resembles a [[ziggurat]].\n\n[[File:Ziggurat method.gif|thumb|300px|The Ziggurat algorithm used to generate sample values with a [[normal distribution]]. (Only positive values are shown for simplicity.) The pink dots are initially uniform-distributed random numbers. The desired distribution function is first segmented into equal areas \"A\".  One layer ''i'' is selected at random by the uniform source at the left. Then a random value from the top source is multiplied by the width of the chosen layer, and the result is ''x'' tested to see which region of the slice it falls into with 3 possible outcomes: 1) (left, solid black region) the sample clearly under the curve and is passed directly to output, 2) (right, vertically striped region) the sample value may lie under the curve, and must be tested further.  In that case, a random ''y'' value within the chosen layer is generated and compared to ''f(x)''.  If less, the point is under the curve and the value ''x'' is output.  If not, (the third case), the chosen point ''x'' is rejected and the algorithm is restarted from the beginning.]]\n\n==Theory of operation==\nThe ziggurat algorithm is a rejection sampling algorithm; it randomly generates a point in a distribution slightly larger than the desired distribution, then tests whether the generated point is inside the desired distribution.  If not, it tries again.  Given a random point underneath a probability density curve, its ''x'' coordinate is a random number with the desired distribution.\n\nThe distribution the ziggurat algorithm chooses from is made up of ''n'' equal-area regions; ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 rectangles that cover the bulk of the desired distribution, on top of a non-rectangular base that includes the tail of the distribution.\n\nGiven a monotone decreasing probability density function ''f''(''x''), defined for all ''x'' ≥ 0, the base of the ziggurat is defined as all points inside the distribution and below ''y''<sub>1</sub> = ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>).  This consists of a rectangular region from (0, 0) to (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>), and the (typically infinite) tail of the distribution, where ''x'' > ''x''<sub>1</sub> (and ''y'' < ''y''<sub>1</sub>).\n\nThis layer (call it layer 0) has area ''A''.  On top of this, add a rectangular layer of width ''x''<sub>1</sub> and height ''A''/''x''<sub>1</sub>, so it also has area ''A''.  The top of this layer is at height ''y''<sub>2</sub> = ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''A''/''x''<sub>1</sub>, and intersects the density function at a point (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>), where ''y''<sub>2</sub> = ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>).  This layer includes every point in the density function between ''y''<sub>1</sub> and ''y''<sub>2</sub>, but (unlike the base layer) also includes points such as (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) which are not in the desired distribution.\n\nFurther layers are then stacked on top.  To use a precomputed table of size ''n'' (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256 is typical), one chooses ''x''<sub>1</sub> such that ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0, meaning that the top box, layer ''n'' − 1, reaches the distribution's peak at (0, ''f''(0)) exactly.\n\nLayer ''i'' extends vertically from ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> to ''y''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, and can be divided into two regions horizontally: the (generally larger) portion from 0 to ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub> which is entirely contained within the desired distribution, and the (small) portion from ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub> to ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, which is only partially contained.\n\nIgnoring for a moment the problem of layer 0, and given uniform random variables ''U''<sub>0</sub> and ''U''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;∈ [0,1), the ziggurat algorithm can be described as:\n\n# Choose a random layer 0 ≤ ''i'' < ''n''.\n# Let ''x'' = ''U''<sub>0</sub>''x''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n# If ''x'' &lt; ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, return ''x''.\n# Let ''y'' = ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''U''<sub>1</sub>(''y''<sub>''i''+1</sub> − ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>).\n# Compute ''f''(''x'').  If ''y'' &lt; ''f''(''x''), return ''x''.\n# Otherwise, choose new random numbers and go back to step 1.\n\nStep 1 amounts to choosing a low-resolution ''y'' coordinate.  Step 3 tests if the ''x'' coordinate is clearly within the desired density function without knowing more about the y coordinate.  If it is not, step 4 chooses a high-resolution y coordinate, and step 5 does the rejection test.\n\nWith closely spaced layers, the algorithm terminates at step 3 a very large fraction of the time.  Note that for the top layer ''n'' − 1, however, this test always fails, because ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0.\n\nLayer 0 can also be divided into a central region and an edge, but the edge is an infinite tail.  To use the same algorithm to check if the point is in the central region, generate a fictitious ''x''<sub>0</sub> = ''A''/''y''<sub>''1''</sub>.  This will generate points with ''x'' < ''x''<sub>''1''</sub> with the correct frequency, and in the rare case that layer 0 is selected and ''x'' ≥ ''x''<sub>''1''</sub>, use a special fallback algorithm to select a point at random from the tail.  Because the fallback algorithm is used less than one time in a thousand, speed is not essential.\n\nThus, the full ziggurat algorithm for one-sided distributions is:\n\n# Choose a random layer 0 ≤ ''i'' < ''n''.\n# Let ''x'' = ''U''<sub>0</sub>''x''<sub>''i''</sub>\n# If ''x'' &lt; ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, return ''x''.\n# If ''i'' = 0, generate a point from the tail using the fallback algorithm.\n# Let ''y'' = ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''U''<sub>1</sub>(''y''<sub>''i''+1</sub> − ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>).\n# Compute ''f''(''x'').  If ''y'' &lt; ''f''(''x''), return ''x''.\n# Otherwise, choose new random numbers and go back to step 1.\n\nFor a two-sided distribution, of course, the result must be negated 50% of the time.  This can often be done conveniently by choosing ''U''<sub>0</sub> ∈ (−1,1) and, in step 3, testing if |''x''| &lt; ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>.\n\n===Fallback algorithms for the tail===\nBecause the ziggurat algorithm only generates ''most'' outputs very rapidly, and requires a fallback algorithm whenever ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>, it is always more complex than a more direct implementation.  The fallback algorithm, of course, depends on the distribution.\n\nFor an exponential distribution, the tail looks just like the body of the distribution.  One way is to fall back to the most elementary algorithm ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;−ln(''U''<sub>1</sub>) and let ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;−&nbsp;ln(''U''<sub>1</sub>).  Another is to call the ziggurat algorithm [[recursion|recursively]] and add ''x''<sub>1</sub> to the result.\n\nFor a normal distribution, Marsaglia suggests a compact algorithm:\n\n# Let ''x'' = −ln(''U''<sub>1</sub>)/''x''<sub>1</sub>.\n# Let ''y'' = −ln(''U''<sub>2</sub>).\n# If 2''y'' > ''x''<sup>2</sup>, return ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>.\n# Otherwise, go back to step 1.\n\nSince ''x''<sub>''1''</sub> ≈ 3.5 for typical table sizes, the test in step 3 is almost always successful.  Note also that −ln(''U'') is just a simple way to generate an exponentially distributed random number; if you have a ziggurat exponential distribution generator available, you can use it instead.\n\n===Optimizations===\nThe algorithm can be performed efficiently with precomputed tables of ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>), but there are some modifications to make it even faster:\n* Nothing in the ziggurat algorithm depends on the probability distribution function being normalized (integral under the curve equal to 1), removing [[normalizing constant]]s can speed up the computation of ''f''(''x'').\n* Most uniform random number generators are based on integer random number generators which return an integer in the range [0, &nbsp;2<sup>32</sup> − 1].  A table of 2<sup>−32</sup>''x''<sub>i</sub> lets you use such numbers directly for ''U''<sub>0</sub>.\n* When computing two-sided distributions using a two-sided ''U''<sub>0</sub> as described earlier, the random integer can be interpreted as a signed number in the range [−2<sup>31</sup>,&nbsp;2<sup>31</sup> − 1], and a scale factor of 2<sup>−31</sup> can be used.\n* Rather than comparing ''U''<sub>0</sub>''x<sub>i</sub>'' to ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub> in step 3, it is possible to precompute ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>/''x''<sub>''i''</sub> and compare ''U''<sub>0</sub> with that directly.  If ''U''<sub>0</sub> is an integer random number generator, these limits may be premultiplied by 2<sup>32</sup> (or 2<sup>31</sup>, as appropriate) so an integer comparison can be used.\n* With the above two changes, the table of unmodified ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> values is no longer needed and may be deleted.\n* When generating [[IEEE 754]] single-precision floating point values, which only have a 24-bit mantissa (including the implicit leading 1), the least-significant bits of a 32-bit integer random number are not used.  These bits may be used to select the layer number.  (See the references below for a detailed discussion of this.)\n* The first three steps may be put into an [[inline function]], which can call an out-of-line implementation of the less frequently needed steps.\n\n===Generating the tables===\nIt is possible to store the entire table precomputed, or just include the values ''n'', ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''A'', and an implementation of ''f''<sup>&thinsp;−1</sup>(''y'') in the source code, and compute the remaining values when initializing the random number generator.\n\nAs previously described, you can find ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''<sup>&thinsp;−1</sup>(''y''<sub>''i''</sub>) and ''y''<sub>''i''+1</sub> =&nbsp;''y''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''A''/''x''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Repeat ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 times for the layers of the ziggurat.  At the end, you should have ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f''(0).  There will, of course, be some [[round-off error]], but it is a useful [[sanity test]] to see that it is acceptably small.\n\nWhen actually filling in the table values, just assume that ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f''(0), and accept the slight difference in layer ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1's area as rounding error.\n\n===Finding ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''A''===\nGiven an initial (guess at) ''x''<sub>1</sub>, you need a way to compute the area ''t'' of the tail for which ''x'' > ''x''<sub>1</sub>.  For the exponential distribution,  this is just ''e''<sup>−''x''<sub>1</sub></sup>, while for the normal distribution, assuming you are using the unnormalized ''f''(''x'') = ''e''<sup>−''x''<sup>2</sup>/2</sup>, this is {{sqrt|''π''/2}}&thinsp;[[error function|erfc]](''x''/{{sqrt|2}}).  For more awkward distributions, [[numerical integration]] may be required.\n\nWith this in hand, from ''x''<sub>1</sub>, you can find ''y''<sub>1</sub> = ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>), the area ''t'' in the tail, and the area of the base layer ''A'' = ''x''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''t''.\n\nThen compute the series ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> as above.  If ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> > ''f''(0) for any ''i'' &lt; ''n'', then the initial estimate ''x''<sub>1</sub> was too low, leading to too large an area ''A''.  If ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> &lt; ''f''(0), then the initial estimate ''x''<sub>1</sub> was too high.\n\nGiven this, use a [[root-finding algorithm]] (such as the [[bisection method]]) to find the value ''x''<sub>1</sub> which produces ''y''<sub>''n''−1</sub> as close to ''f''(0) as possible.  Alternatively, look for the value which makes the area of the topmost layer, ''x''<sub>''n''−1</sub>(''f''(0)&nbsp;−&nbsp;''y''<sub>''n''−1</sub>), as close to the desired value ''A'' as possible.  This saves one evaluation of ''f''<sup>&thinsp;−1</sup>(''x'') and is actually the condition of greatest interest.\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite Journal |url=http://www.jstatsoft.org/v05/i08/paper |title=The Ziggurat Method for Generating Random Variables |author1=George Marsaglia |author2=Wai Wan Tsang |authorlink1=George Marsaglia |volume=5 |issue=8 |journal=Journal of Statistical Software |year=2000 |accessdate=2007-06-20}}  Note that this paper numbers the layers from 1 starting at the top, and makes layer 0 at the bottom a special case, while the explanation above numbers layers from 0 at the bottom.\n* [https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/downloadSuppFile/v005i08/rnorrexp.c C implementation of the ziggurat method for the normal density function and the exponential density function], that is essentially a copy of the code in the paper.

One of the major goals of these approaches is to provide a reliable solution (or an accurate approximation) of the quantum [[many-body problem]].  The diverse flavor of quantum Monte Carlo approaches all share the common use of the [[Monte Carlo method]] to handle the multi-dimensional integrals that arise in the different formulations of the [[many-body problem]].  The quantum Monte Carlo methods allow for a direct treatment and description of complex many-body effects encoded in the [[wave function]], going beyond [[mean field theory]] and offering an exact solution of the [[many-body problem]] in some circumstances. In particular, there exist numerically exact and [[polynomial]]ly-scaling [[algorithm]]s to exactly study static properties of [[boson]] systems without [[geometrical frustration]].  For [[fermion]]s, there exist very good approximations to their static properties and numerically exact exponentially scaling quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, but none that are both.\n\n==Background==\nIn principle, any physical system can be described by the many-body [[Schrödinger equation]] as long as the constituent particles are not moving \"too\" fast; that is, they are not moving at a speed comparable to that of light, and [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] effects can be neglected.  This is true for a wide range of electronic problems in [[condensed matter physics]], in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[superfluid]]s such as [[liquid helium]]. The ability to solve the Schrödinger equation for a given system allows prediction of its behavior, with important applications ranging from [[materials science]] to complex [[biological system]]s. The difficulty is however that solving the Schrödinger equation requires the knowledge of the many-body [[wave function]] in the many-body [[Hilbert space]], which typically has an exponentially large size in the number of particles. Its solution for a reasonably large number of particles is therefore typically impossible, even for modern [[parallel computing]] technology in a reasonable amount of time.  Traditionally, approximations for the many-body wave function as an [[Antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] function of one-body [[Molecular orbital|orbital]]s<ref>[http://www.attaccalite.altervista.org/PhDThesis/html/node9.html Functional form of the wave function]</ref> have been used, in order to have a manageable treatment of the [[Schrödinger equation]]. This kind of formulation has however several drawbacks, either limiting the effect of quantum many-body correlations, as in the case of the [[Hartree–Fock]] (HF) approximation, or converging very slowly, as in [[configuration interaction]] applications in quantum chemistry.\n\nQuantum Monte Carlo is a way to directly study the [[many-body problem]] and the many-body wave function beyond these approximations. The most advanced quantum Monte Carlo approaches provide an exact solution to the [[many-body]] problem for non-frustrated interacting [[boson]] systems, while providing an approximate, yet typically very accurate, description of interacting [[fermion]] systems.  Most methods aim at computing the [[ground state]] wavefunction of the system, with the exception of [[path integral Monte Carlo]] and finite-temperature [[auxiliary field Monte Carlo]], which calculate the [[density matrix]]. In addition to static properties, the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] can also be solved, albeit only approximately, restricting the functional form of the time-evolved [[wave function]], as done in the [[time-dependent variational Monte Carlo]]. From the probabilistic point of view, the computation of the top eigenvalues and the corresponding ground states eigenfunctions associated with the  [[Schrödinger equation]] relies on the numerical solving of Feynman–Kac path integration problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Development of a pure diffusion quantum Monte Carlo method using a full generalized Feynman–Kac formula.

There are special functions, called [[eigenfunction]]s, for which <math>H\\Psi(x)=E\\Psi(x)</math>, where <math>E</math>is a number.  These functions are special because no matter where we evaluate the action of the <math>H</math>operator on the [[wave function]], we always get the same number <math>E</math>.  These functions are called [[stationary state]]s, because the time derivative at any point <math>x</math> is always the same, so the amplitude of the wave function never changes in time.  Since the overall phase of a wave function is not measurable, the system does not change in time.\n\nWe are usually interested in the wave function with the lowest [[energy]] [[eigenvalue]], the [[ground state]].  We're going to write a slightly different version of the Schrödinger equation that will have the same energy eigenvalue, but, instead of being oscillatory, it will be convergent.  Here it is:\n:<math>-\\frac{\\partial\\Psi(x,t)}{\\partial t}=(H-E_0)\\Psi(x,t)</math>.\nWe've removed the imaginary number from the time derivative and added in a constant offset of <math>E_0</math>, which is the ground state energy.  We don't actually know the ground state energy, but there will be a way to determine it self-consistently which we'll introduce later.  Our modified equation(some people call it the imaginary-time Schrödinger equation) has some nice properties.  The first thing to notice is that if we happen to guess the ground state wave function, then <math>H\\Phi_0(x)=E_0\\Phi_0(x)</math> and the time derivative is zero.  Now suppose that we start with another wave function(<math>\\Psi</math>), which is not the ground state but is not orthogonal to it.  Then we can write it as a linear sum of eigenfunctions:\n:<math>\\Psi=c_0\\Phi_0+\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty c_i\\Phi_i</math>\nSince this is a [[linear differential equation]], we can look at the action of each part separately.  We already determined that <math>\\Phi_0</math> is stationary.  Suppose we take <math>\\Phi_1</math>. Since <math>\\Phi_0</math> is the lowest-energy eigenfunction,  the associate eigenvalue of <math>\\Phi_1</math> satisfies the property <math>E_1 > E_0</math>.  Thus the time derivative of <math>c_1</math> is negative, and will eventually go to zero, leaving us with only the ground state.  This observation also gives us a way to determine <math>E_0</math>.  We watch the amplitude of the wave function as we propagate through time.  If it increases, then decrease the estimation of the offset energy.  If the amplitude decreases, then increase the estimate of the offset energy.\n\n== Stochastic Implementation ==\n\nNow we have an equation that, as we propagate it forward in time and adjust <math>E_0</math> appropriately, we find the\nground state of any given [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. This is still a harder problem than [[classical mechanics]], though, because instead of \npropagating single positions of particles, we must propagate entire functions.  In classical mechanics, we could simulate the\nmotion of the particles by setting <math>x(t+\\tau)=x(t)+\\tau v(t)+0.5 F(t)\\tau^2</math>, if we assume that the force is constant over the time span of <math>\\tau</math>.  For the imaginary time Schrödinger equation, instead, we propagate forward in time using a [[convolution]] integral with a special function called a [[Green's function]].  So we get <math> \\Psi(x,t+\\tau)=\\int G(x,x',\\tau) \\Psi(x',t) dx' </math>.  Similarly to classical mechanics, we can only propagate for small slices of time; otherwise the Green's function is inaccurate.  As the number of particles increases, the dimensionality of the integral increases as well, since we have to integrate over all coordinates of all particles.  We can do these integrals by [[Monte Carlo integration]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0021-9991(71)90054-4 | volume=7 | title=Monte-Carlo solution of Schrödinger's equation | year=1971 | journal=Journal of Computational Physics | pages=134–156 | last1 = Grimm | first1 = R.C | last2 = Storer | first2 = R.G| bibcode=1971JCoPh...7..134G }}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.431514 | volume=63 | title=A random-walk simulation of the Schrödinger equation: H+3 | year=1975 | journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics | page=1499 | last1 = Anderson | first1 = James B.| bibcode=1975JChPh..63.1499A }}\n* [http://www.worldscibooks.com/chemistry/1170.html] B.L.

In PIMD, one uses the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]] to separate the [[wavefunction]] into a nuclear part and an electronic part. The nuclei are treated quantum mechanically by mapping each quantum nucleus onto a classical system of several fictitious particles connected by springs (harmonic potentials) governed by an effective Hamiltonian, which is derived from Feynman's path integral. The resulting classical system, although complex, can be solved relatively quickly. There are now a number of commonly used condensed matter computer simulation techniques that make use of the path integral formulation including '''Centroid Molecular Dynamics''' ('''CMD'''),<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cao | first1 = J. | last2 = Voth | first2 = G.

This has some advantages relating to calculating certain properties of the system under study that diffusion Monte Carlo has difficulty with.\n\nIn both diffusion Monte Carlo and reptation Monte Carlo, the method first aims to solve the [[Schrödinger equation|time-dependent Schrödinger equation]] in the [[imaginary time]] direction. When you propagate the Schrödinger equation in time, you get the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of the system under study. When you propagate it in imaginary time, you get a system that tends towards the [[ground state]] of the system.\n\nWhen substituting <math>it</math> in place of <math>t</math>, the Schrodinger equation becomes identical with a [[diffusion equation]]. Diffusion equations can be solved by imagining a huge population of particles (sometimes called \"walkers\"), each [[Molecular diffusion|diffusing]] in a way that solves the original equation. This is how diffusion Monte Carlo works.\n\nReptation Monte Carlo works in a very similar way, but is focused on the paths that the walkers take, rather than the [[density]] of walkers.\n\nIn particular, a path may be mutated using a [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm|Metropolis algorithm]] which tries a change (normally at one end of the path) and then accepts or rejects the change based on a [[probability]] calculation.\n\nThe update step in diffusion Monte Carlo would be moving the walkers slightly, and then duplicating and removing some of them. By contrast, the update step in reptation Monte Carlo mutates a path, and then accepts or rejects the mutation.\n\n== References ==\n\n*\n{{cite journal\n |author1=S. Baroni  |author2=S.

Conceptually, this is achieved by averaging the result of different FORM simulations. In practice, this is made possible by identifying the importance direction <math>\\boldsymbol \\alpha</math>&nbsp; in the input parameter space, which points towards the region which most strongly contributes to the overall failure probability. The importance direction can be closely related to the center of mass of the failure region, or to the failure point with the highest probability density, which often falls at the closest point to the origin of the limit state function, when the [[Random_variable|random variables]] of the problem have been transformed into the standard [[Normal_distribution|normal space]]. Once the importance direction has been set to point towards the failure region, samples are randomly generated from the standard normal space and lines are drawn parallel to the importance direction in order to compute the distance to the limit state function, which enables the probability of failure to be estimated for each sample. These failure probabilities can then be averaged to obtain an improved estimate.\n\n== Mathematical approach ==\n\nFirstly the importance direction must be determined. This can be achieved by finding the design point, or the gradient of the limit state function.\n\nA set of samples is generated using [[Monte_Carlo_method|Monte Carlo simulation]] in the standard normal space. For each sample <math>\\boldsymbol x</math>, the probability of failure in the line parallel to the important direction is defined as:\n<center><math>\n p_f(\\boldsymbol x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} I(\\boldsymbol x + \\beta \\cdot \\boldsymbol \\alpha)\\varphi (\\beta ) d\\beta\n</math></center> \nwhere <math>I(\\cdot)</math>&nbsp; is equal to one for samples contributing to failure, and is zero otherwise:\n<center><math>\nI_f(\\boldsymbol x) =  \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n        1 & \\mbox{if }  \\boldsymbol x \\in \\Omega_f  \\\\\n\n        0  & \\mbox{else}\n    \\end{matrix}\n\\right. \n</math></center> \n\n<math>\\boldsymbol \\alpha</math>&nbsp; is the important direction, <math>\\varphi</math>&nbsp; is the probability density function of a [[Normal_distribution|Gaussian distribution]] (and <math>\\beta</math>&nbsp; is a real number). In practice the roots of a nonlinear function must be found to estimate the partial probabilities of failure along each line. This is either done by interpolation of a few samples along the line, or by using the [[Newton%27s_method|Newton–Raphson method]].\n\nThe global probability of failure is the mean of the probability of failure on the lines:\n<center><math>\n\\tilde{p}_f = \\frac{1}{N_L}  \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{N_L} p_f^{(i)}\n</math></center> \n\n\nwhere <math>N_L</math>&nbsp; is the total number of lines used in the analysis and the <math>p_f^{(i)}</math>&nbsp; are the partial probabilities of failure estimated along all the lines. \n\nFor problems in which the dependence of the performance function is only moderately non-linear with respect to the parameters modeled as random variables, setting the importance direction as the gradient vector of the performance function in the underlying standard normal space leads to highly efficient Line Sampling. In general it can be shown that the variance obtained by line sampling is always smaller than that obtained by conventional Monte Carlo simulation, and hence the line sampling algorithm converges more quickly <ref name=\"Schueller\"></ref>. The rate of convergence is made quicker still by recent advancements which allow the importance direction to be repeatedly updated throughout the simulation, and this is known as adaptive line sampling <ref name=\"de AngelisPatelli2015\">{{cite journal|last1=de Angelis|first1=Marco|last2=Patelli|first2=Edoardo|last3=Beer|first3=Michael|title=Advanced Line Sampling for efficient robust reliability analysis|journal=Structural Safety|volume=52|year=2015|pages=170–182|issn=01674730|doi=10.1016/j.strusafe.2014.10.002}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:LineSamplingScheme.svg|center|350px|thumb|An illustration of the line sampling algorithm.

'''Stratification''' is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should define a partition of the population. That is, it should be '''[[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]]''' and '''[[Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]]''': every element in the population must be assigned to one and only one stratum. Then [[simple random sampling]] or [[systematic sampling]] is applied within each stratum. The objective is to improve the precision of the sample by reducing [[sampling error]]. It can produce a [[weighted mean]] that has less variability than the [[arithmetic mean]] of a [[simple random sample]] of the population.\n\nIn [[computational statistics]], stratified sampling is a method of [[variance reduction]] when [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to estimate population statistics from a known population.<ref name=\"varred17\">{{cite journal|last1=Botev|first1=Z.|last2=Ridder|first2=A.|title=Variance Reduction|journal= Wiley StatsRef: Statistics Reference Online|date=2017|pages=1--6|doi=10.1002/9781118445112.stat07975}}</ref>\n\nAssume that we need to estimate average number of votes for each candidate in an election. Assume that country has 3 towns: Town A has 1 million factory workers, Town B has 2 million office workers and Town C has 3 million retirees. We can choose to get a random sample of size 60 over the entire population but there is some chance that the random sample turns out to be not well balanced across these towns and hence is biased causing a significant error in estimation. Instead if we choose to take a random sample of 10, 20 and 30 from Town A, B and C respectively then we can produce a smaller error in estimation for the same total size of sample.This method is generally used when population is not a homogeneous group.\n\n==Stratified sampling strategies==\n#''Proportionate allocation'' uses a [[sampling fraction]] in each of the strata that is proportional to that of the total population. For instance, if the population consists of ''X'' total individuals, ''m'' of which are male and ''f'' female (and where ''m'' + ''f'' = ''X''), then the relative size of the two samples (''x1'' = ''m/X'' males, ''x2'' = ''f/X'' females) should reflect this proportion.\n#''Optimum allocation'' (or ''disproportionate allocation'') - The sampling fraction of each stratum is proportionate to both the proportion (as above) and the [[standard deviation]] of the distribution of the variable. Larger samples are taken in the strata with the greatest variability to generate the least possible overall sampling variance.\n\nA real-world example of using stratified sampling would be for a political [[Statistical survey|survey]]. If the respondents needed to reflect the diversity of the population, the researcher would specifically seek to include participants of various minority groups such as race or religion, based on their proportionality to the total population as mentioned above. A stratified survey could thus claim to be more representative of the population than a survey of [[simple random sampling]] or [[systematic sampling]].\n\n==Advantages==\nThe reasons to use stratified sampling rather than [[Simple random sample|simple random sampling]] include<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = 6.1 How to Use Stratified Sampling  {{!}} STAT 506|url = https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat506/node/27|website = onlinecourses.science.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}</ref>\n# If measurements within strata have lower standard deviation, stratification gives smaller error in estimation.\n# For many applications, measurements become more manageable and/or cheaper when the population is grouped into strata.\n# It is often desirable to have estimates of population parameters for groups within the population.\nIf the population density varies greatly within a region, stratified sampling will ensure that estimates can be made with equal accuracy in different parts of the region, and that comparisons of sub-regions can be made with equal [[statistical power]]. For example, in [[Ontario]] a survey taken throughout the province might use a larger sampling fraction in the less populated north, since the disparity in population between north and south is so great that a sampling fraction based on the provincial sample as a whole might result in the collection of only a handful of data from the north.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nStratified sampling is not useful when the population cannot be exhaustively partitioned into disjoint subgroups.\nIt would be a misapplication of the technique to make subgroups' sample sizes proportional to the amount of data available from the subgroups, rather than scaling sample sizes to subgroup sizes (or to their variances, if known to vary significantly -- e.g. by means of an [[F-test|F Test]]). Data representing each subgroup are taken to be of equal importance if suspected variation among them warrants stratified sampling. If subgroup variances differ significantly and the data needs to be stratified by variance, it is not possible to simultaneously make each subgroup sample size proportional to subgroup size within the total population. For an efficient way to partition sampling resources among groups that vary in their means, variance and costs, see [[Sample size#Stratified sample size|\"optimum allocation\"]].\nThe problem of stratified sampling in the case of unknown class priors (ratio of subpopulations in the entire population) can have deleterious effect on the performance of any analysis on the dataset, e.g. classification.<ref name=minimax-sampling/> In that regard, [[minimax|minimax sampling ratio]] can be used to make the dataset robust with respect to uncertainty in the underlying data generating process.<ref name=minimax-sampling/>\n\nCombining sub-strata to ensure adequate numbers can lead to [[Simpson's paradox]], where  trends that actually exist in different groups of data disappear or even reverse when the groups are combined.\n\n== Mean and standard error ==\nThe mean and variance of stratified random sampling are given by:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n:<math>\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{h=1}^L N_h \\bar{x_h}</math>\n\n:<math>s_\\bar{x}^2 = \\sum_{h=1}^L \\left(\\frac{N_h}{N}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{N_h - n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s_h^2}{n_h}</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:<math>L =</math> number of strata\n\n:<math>N =</math> the sum of all stratum sizes\n\n:<math>N_h =</math> size of stratum <math>h</math>\n\n:<math>\\bar{x_h} =</math> sample mean of stratum <math>h</math>\n\n:<math>n_h =</math> number of observations in stratum <math>h</math>\n\n:<math>s_h =</math> sample standard deviation of stratum <math>h</math>\n\nNote that the term (<math>N_h</math> − <math>n_h</math>) / (<math>N_h</math>), which equals (1 − <math>n_h</math> / <math>N_h</math>), is a [[Standard_error#Correction_for_finite_population|finite population correction]] and <math>N_h</math> must be expressed in \"sample units\".

The basic idea is to express a small failure probability as a product of larger conditional probabilities by introducing intermediate failure events. This conceptually converts the original rare event problem into a series of frequent event problems that are easier to solve. In the actual implementation, samples conditional on intermediate failure events are adaptively generated to gradually populate from the frequent to rare event region. These 'conditional samples' provide information for estimating the [[cumulative distribution function|complementary cumulative distribution function]] (CCDF) of the quantity of interest (that governs failure), covering the high as well as the low probability regions. They can also be used for investigating the cause and consequence of failure events. The generation of conditional samples is not trivial but can be performed efficiently using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC).\n\nSubset Simulation takes the relationship between the (input) random variables and the (output) response quantity of interest as a '[[black-box]]'. This can be attractive for complex systems where it is difficult to use other [[variance reduction]] or [[rare event sampling]] techniques that require prior information about the system behaviour. For problems where it is possible to incorporate prior information into the reliability algorithm, it is often more efficient to use other [[variance reduction]] techniques such as [[importance sampling]]. It has been shown that subset simulation is more efficient than traditional [[Monte Carlo simulation]], but less efficient than [[Line Sampling]], when applied to a [[fracture mechanics]] test problem <ref name=\"ZioPedroni2009\">{{cite book|last1=Zio|first1=E|title=Reliability, Risk, and Safety|last2=Pedroni|first2=N|chapter=Subset simulation and line sampling for advanced Monte Carlo reliability analysis|year=2009|doi=10.1201/9780203859759.ch94|isbn=978-0-415-55509-8}}</ref>.\n\n==Basic idea==\nLet '''X''' be a vector of random variables and Y = h('''X''') be a scalar (output) response quantity of interest for which the failure probability <math>P(F)=P(Y>b)</math> is to be determined. Each evaluation of h(.) is expensive and so it should be avoided if possible. Using direct [[Monte Carlo method]]s one can generate [[iid|i.i.d.]] ([[independent and identically distributed]]) samples of '''X''' and then estimate P(F) simply as the fraction of samples with Y>b. However this is not efficient when P(F) is small because most samples will not fail (i.e., with Y≤b) and in many cases an estimate of 0 results. As a rule of thumb for small P(F) one requires 10 failed samples to estimate P(F) with a [[coefficient of variation]] of 30% (a moderate requirement). For example, 10000 i.i.d. samples, and hence evaluations of h(.), would be required for such an estimate if P(F)=0.001.\n\nSubset Simulation attempts to convert a rare event problem into more frequent ones. Let <math> b_{1} < b_{2} < ... < b_{m} = b </math> be an increasing sequence of intermediate threshold levels. From the basic property of [[conditional probability]],\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nP(Y>b) &= P(Y>b_{m}\\mid Y>b_{m-1}) P(Y>b_{m-1})\\\\\n&= P(Y>b_m\\mid Y>b_{m-1}) P(Y>b_{m-1}\\mid Y>b_{m-2}) P(Y>b_{m-2})\\\\\n&= \\cdots \\\\\n&= P(Y>b_m\\mid Y>b_{m-1}) P(Y>b_{m-1}\\mid Y>b_{m-2}) \\cdots P(Y>b_2\\mid Y>b_1) P(Y>b_1)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe 'raw idea' of subset simulation is to estimate P(F) by estimating <math>P(Y>b_1)</math> and the conditional probabilities <math>P(Y>b_i\\mid Y>b_{i-1})</math> for <math> i=2,\\ldots,m </math>, anticipating efficiency gain when these probabilities are not small. To implement this idea there are two basic issues:\n\n# Estimating the conditional probabilities by means of simulation requires the efficient generation of samples of '''X''' conditional on the intermediate failure events, i.e., the conditional samples. This is generally non-trivial. \n# The intermediate threshold levels <math>{b_i}</math> should be chosen so that the intermediate probabilities are not too small (otherwise ending up with rare event problem again) but not too large (otherwise requiring too many levels to reach the target event). However, this requires information of the CCDF, which is the target to be estimated.\n\nIn the standard algorithm of subset simulation the first issue is resolved by using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Au|first1=Siu-Kui|title=On MCMC algorithm for Subset Simulation|journal=Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics|date=2016|volume=43|pages=117–120|doi=10.1016/j.probengmech.2015.12.003}}</ref> The second issue is resolved by choosing the intermediate threshold levels {b<sub>i</sub>} adaptively using samples from the last simulation level.

Bakhvalov was exposed to mathematics from a young age.  In 1950, Bakhvalov entered the [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics|Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics]] at Moscow State University.  His supervisors there included [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] and [[Sergei Sobolev|Sobolev]].  Bakhvalov defended his doctorate in 1958.  He was a professor of mathematics at Moscow State University since 1966, specializing in [[computational mathematics]]. Bakhvalov was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1991 and a head of the department of computational mathematics at the college of mechanics and mathematics of the Moscow State University since 1981. Bakhvalov authored over 150 papers, several books, and a popular textbook on numerical methods.\n\nHe had made major pioneering contributions to many areas of mathematics and mechanics. Starting early in his career, Bakhvalov formulated and proved important results on the optimization of [[Numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]].  In 1959, he determined the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the integration problem in the worst-case setting for integrands of smoothness.  Furthermore, he proposed an [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|optimal algorithm]] for the randomized setting.  These can be considered early results in the theory of [[information-based complexity]].\n\nBakhvalov was one of the pioneers of the [[multigrid method]], contributed to the theory of [[Homogenization (mathematics)|homogenization]], and [[fictitious domain method]]s.\n\nBakhvalov supervised 47 Ph.D. students and was an advisor to 11 [[Doctorate#Russia|doctorates]].\n\n==Notes==\n* http://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/06/v06n04.html#5 Nikolaj S.

His name can be alternatively [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] as ''Chebysheff'', Chebychov, ''Chebyshov''; or ''Tchebychev'', ''Tchebycheff'' (French transcriptions); or ''Tschebyschev'', ''Tschebyschef'',  ''Tschebyscheff'' (German transcriptions). ''Chebychev'', mixture between English and French transliterations, is sometimes erroneously used.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years ===\n\nOne of nine children,<ref Name=MacTutor>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chebyshev.html Biography in MacTutor Archive]</ref> Chebyshev was born in the village of Okatovo in the district of [[Borovsk]], [[province of Kaluga]], into a family which traced its roots back to a 17th-century [[Tatar]] military leader named Khan Chabysh.<ref>Paul Butzer & François ''Jongmans, P. L. Chebyshev (1821-1894) : A Guide to his Life and Work'', [[Journal of Approximation Theory]], vol. 96, p. 112 (1999)</ref> His father, Lev Pavlovich, was a Russian nobleman and wealthy landowner.  Pafnuty Lvovich was first educated at home by his mother Agrafena Ivanovna (in reading and writing) and by his cousin Avdotya Kvintillianovna Sukhareva (in French and arithmetic). Chebyshev mentioned that his music teacher also played an important role in his education, for she “raised his mind to exactness and analysis.”\n\n[[Trendelenburg gait|Trendelenburg's gait]] affected Chebyshev's adolescence and development. From childhood, he limped and walked with a stick and so his parents abandoned the idea of his becoming an officer in the family tradition. His disability prevented his playing many children's games and he devoted himself instead to mathematics.\n\nIn 1832, the family moved to [[Moscow]], mainly to attend to the education of their eldest sons (Pafnuty and Pavel, who would become lawyers). Education continued at home and his parents engaged teachers of excellent reputation, including (for mathematics and physics) [[P.N. Pogorelski]], held to be one of the best teachers in Moscow and who had taught (for example) the writer [[Ivan Turgenev|Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev]].\n\n=== University studies ===\n\nIn summer 1837, Chebyshev passed the registration examinations and, in September of that year, began his mathematical studies at the second philosophical department of Moscow University. His teachers included [[Nikolai Brashman|N.D. Brashman]], [[N.E. Zernov]] and [[Dmitri Perevoshchikov|D.M. Perevoshchikov]] of whom it seems clear that Brashman had the greatest influence on Chebyshev. Brashman instructed him in practical mechanics and probably showed him the work of French engineer [[Jean-Victor Poncelet|J.V. Poncelet]].\nIn 1841 Chebyshev was awarded the silver medal for his work “calculation of the roots of equations” which he had finished in 1838. In this, Chebyshev derived an approximating algorithm for the solution of algebraic equations of ''n<sup>th</sup>'' degree based on [[Newton's method]]. In the same year, he finished his studies as \"most outstanding candidate\".\n\nIn 1841, Chebyshev’s financial situation changed drastically. There was famine in Russia, and his parents were forced to leave Moscow.  Although they could no longer support their son, he decided to continue his mathematical studies and prepared for the master examinations, which lasted six months. Chebyshev passed the final examination in October 1843 and, in 1846, defended his master thesis “An Essay on the Elementary Analysis of the Theory of Probability.” His biographer Prudnikov suggests that Chebyshev was directed to this subject after learning of recently published books on probability theory or on the revenue of the Russian insurance industry.\n\n=== Adult years ===\n\nIn 1847, Chebyshev promoted his thesis [[pro venia legendi]] “On integration with the help of logarithms” at [[St Petersburg University]] and thus obtained the right to teach there as a lecturer. At that time some of [[Leonhard Euler]]’s works were rediscovered by P. N. Fuss and were being edited by [[Viktor Bunyakovsky|V. Ya. Bunyakovsky]], who encouraged Chebyshev to study them.  This would come to influence Chebyshev's work.  In 1848, he submitted his work ''The Theory of Congruences'' for a doctorate, which he defended in May 1849. He was elected an [[Professor|extraordinary professor]] at St Petersburg University in 1850, ordinary professor in 1860 and, after 25 years of lectureship, he became merited professor in 1872.  In 1882 he left the university and devoted his life to research.\n\nDuring his lectureship at the university (1852–1858), Chebyshev also taught practical mechanics at the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum|Alexander Lyceum]] in [[Tsarskoe Selo]] (now Pushkin), a southern suburb of [[St Petersburg]].\n\nHis scientific achievements were the reason for his election as junior [[academician]] (adjunkt) in 1856. Later, he became an extraordinary (1856) and in 1858 an ordinary member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]]. In the same year he became an honorary member of [[Moscow University]]. He accepted other honorary appointments and was decorated several times.  In 1856, Chebyshev became a member of the scientific committee of the ministry of national education. In 1859, he became an ordinary member of the ordnance department of the academy with the adoption of the headship of the commission for mathematical questions according to ordnance and experiments related to ballistics. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris academy]] elected him corresponding member in 1860 and full foreign member in 1874. In 1893, he was elected honorable member of the [[St. Petersburg Mathematical Society]], which had been founded three years earlier.\n\nChebyshev died in [[St Petersburg]] on 26 November 1894.\n\n== Mathematical contributions ==\n\nChebyshev is known for his work in the fields of [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[mechanics]], and [[number theory]]. The [[Chebyshev inequality]] states that if <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]] with [[standard deviation]] ''σ'' > 0, then the probability that the outcome of <math>X</math> is no less than <math>a\\sigma</math> away from its mean is no more than <math>1/a^2</math>:\n\n: <math>\\Pr(|X - {\\mathbf E}(X)| \\ge a\\,\\sigma )\\le \\frac {1}{a^2}.</math>\n\nThe Chebyshev inequality is used to prove the [[Law of large numbers#Weak law|weak law of large numbers]].\n\nThe [[Bertrand's postulate|Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem]] (1845,1852) states that for any <math>n > 1</math>, there exists a [[prime numbers|prime number]] <math>p</math> such that <math>n < p < 2n</math>. This is a consequence of the Chebyshev inequalities for the number <math>\\pi(n)</math> of [[prime numbers]] less than <math>n</math>, which state that <math>\\pi(n)</math> is of the order of <math>n/\\log(n)</math>. A more precise form is given by the celebrated [[prime number theorem]]: the ''quotient'' of the two expressions approaches 1.0 as <math>n</math> tends to infinity.\n\nChebyshev is also known for the [[Chebyshev polynomial]]s and the [[Chebyshev bias]] – the difference between the number of primes that are congruent to 3 (modulo 4) and 1 (modulo 4).\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Stamp_of_USSR_1047.jpg|thumb|upright]]\n\nChebyshev is considered to be a founding father of [[Russia]]n mathematics. Among his well-known students were the mathematicians [[Dmitry Grave]], [[Aleksandr Korkin]], [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], and [[Andrey Markov|Andrei Markov]]. According to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]], Chebyshev has 12,422 mathematical \"descendants\" as of July 2018.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|12542}}</ref>\n\nThe lunar crater ''[[Chebyshev (crater)|Chebyshev]]'' and the asteroid [[2010&nbsp;Chebyshev]] were named to honor his major achievements in the mathematical realm.<ref name=\"springer\" />\n\n== Publications ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Tchebychef | first1=P.

Ciarlet''' (born October 14, 1938, [[Paris]]) is a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]], known particularly for his work on mathematical analysis of the [[finite element method]] especially applied to elasticity. He has contributed also to analysis of [[partial differential equations]] and [[differential geometry]].\n\nAlumnus of the [[École polytechnique]] and [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées]] in  [[Paris]], Ciarlet earned a Ph.D. from [[Case Institute of Technology]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1966 for a thesis entitled ''Variational Methods for Non-Linear Boundary-Value Problems'' under [[Richard S. Varga]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=37068}}</ref>\n\nReturning to Paris, Ciarlet was awarded a higher doctorate under the supervision of [[Jacques-Louis Lions]]. From 1974 to 2002, Ciarlet held the post of Professor at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]], Paris. He currently holds a chair in the Department of Mathematics at the [[City University of Hong Kong]].\n\nCiarlet has been awarded the Grand Prize (Prix Jaffé) of the  [[French Academy of Sciences]] in  1989, membership of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Légion d'honneur]], both in  1999. He is a member of the Academies of Science of several other countries. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-10.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/ma/people/ciarlet/ciarlet.html home page] at City University of Hong Kong\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ciarlet, Philippe}}\n[[Category:École Polytechnique alumni]]\n[[Category:People associated with the finite element method]]\n[[Category:Numerical analysts]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Legion of Honour recipients]]\n[[Category:Case Western Reserve University alumni]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n\n\n{{France-mathematician-stub}}"

His mother became a linguist at the [[Library of Congress]], and his father became a math tutor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. Dantzig attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School; one of his friends there was [[Abraham Seidenberg]], who also became a professional mathematician.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> By the time he reached high school he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in [[projective geometry]].<ref name= \"JH05\"/><ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nGeorge Dantzig received his B.S. from [[University of Maryland]] in 1936 in mathematics and physics, which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]]. He earned his master's degree in mathematics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1938. After a two-year period at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he enrolled in the doctoral program in mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he studied statistics under [[Jerzy Neyman]].\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]], Dantzig took a leave of absence from the doctoral program at Berkeley to join the [[U.S. Air Force]] Office of Statistical Control. In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his [[Ph.D.]] that year.<ref name = \"SR06\"/> Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Dantzig joined the mathematics division of the [[RAND Corporation]]. By 1960 he became a professor in the [[University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering|Department of Industrial Engineering]] at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966 he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973 he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical leave that year, he headed the Methodology Group at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at [[Stanford]], and kept going, well beyond his mandatory retirement in 1985.<ref name = \"SR06\"/>\n\nHe was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

He was 90 years old.<ref name= \"JH05\"/>\n\n==Work==\nFreund wrote further that \"through his research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems, Dantzig contributed more than any other researcher to the remarkable development of linear programming\".<ref name=\"RF94\">Robert Freund (1994). [http://www.stanford.edu/group/SOL/dantzig.html \"Professor George Dantzig: Linear Programming Founder Turns 80\"]. In: ''SIAM News'', November 1994.</ref>\n\nDantzig's work allows the airline industry, for example, to schedule crews and make fleet assignments. Based on his work tools are developed \"that shipping companies use to determine how many planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how much should be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas\".<ref name= \"JH05\"/>\n\n===Mathematical statistics===\nAn event in Dantzig's life became the origin of a famous story in 1939, while he was a graduate student at [[UC Berkeley]]. Near the beginning of a class for which Dantzig was late, professor [[Jerzy Neyman]] wrote two examples of famously unsolved [[statistics]] problems on the blackboard. When Dantzig arrived, he assumed that the two problems were a homework assignment and wrote them down. According to Dantzig, the problems \"seemed to be a little harder than usual\", but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for the two problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref name=snopes>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp |publisher=Snopes |title=The Unsolvable Math Problem |date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSix weeks later, Dantzig received a visit from an excited professor Neyman, who was eager to tell him that the homework problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics.<ref name= \"JH05\"/><ref name=\"mmp\"/> He had prepared one of Dantzig's solutions for publication in a mathematical journal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=George|title=On the non-existence of tests of \"Student's\" hypothesis having power functions independent of σ|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1940|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731912|volume=11|issue=2|pages=186–192}}</ref> As Dantzig told it in a 1986 interview in the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'':<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://rev-inv-ope.univ-paris1.fr/fileadmin/rev-inv-ope/files/26305/IO-26305-1.pdf |title=Professor George Bernard Dantzig,  Life & Legend |first1=Sira M. |last1=Allende |first2=Carlos N. |last2=Bouza |journal=Revista Investigación Operacional |year=2005 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=205–11}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nA year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.\n</blockquote>\n\nYears later another researcher, [[Abraham Wald]], was preparing to publish an article that arrived at a conclusion for the second problem, and included Dantzig as its co-author when he learned of the earlier solution.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=George|last2=Wald|first2=Abraham|title=On the Fundamental Lemma of Neyman and Pearson|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1951|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177729695|accessdate=14 October 2014|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729695|volume=22|pages=87–93}}</ref>\n\nThis story began to spread and was used as a motivational lesson demonstrating the power of positive thinking.  Over time Dantzig's name was removed, and facts were altered, but the basic story persisted in the form of an [[urban legend]] and as an introductory scene in the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.<ref name=snopes/>\n\n===Linear programming===\n[[Linear programming]] is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a given [[mathematical model]] for some list of requirements represented as linear relationships. Linear programming arose as a mathematical model developed during [[World War II]] to plan expenditures and returns in order to reduce costs to the army and increase losses to the enemy. It was kept secret until 1947. Postwar, many industries found its use in their daily planning.\n\nThe founders of this subject are  [[Leonid Kantorovich]], a Russian mathematician who developed linear programming problems in 1939, Dantzig, who published the [[Simplex algorithm|simplex method]] in 1947, and [[John von Neumann]], who developed the theory of the [[duality (optimization)|duality]] in the same year.\n\nDantzig's original example of finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs exemplifies the usefulness of [[linear programming]]. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked.\n\nIn 1963, Dantzig's ''Linear Programming and Extensions'' was published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Rich in insight and coverage of significant topics, the book quickly became \"the bible\" of linear programming.\n\n==Publications==\nBooks by George Dantzig:\n* 1953.

He was known for his work in [[numerical analysis]] and [[approximation theory]], as well as his investigations in the [[History of mathematics|history]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. He earned his degrees in mathematics from [[Harvard University]] (SB, 1943; PhD, 1950, advisor [[Ralph P. Boas, Jr]].), and his final position was Professor Emeritus at the Division of Applied Mathematics at [[Brown University]]. \n\nHe served briefly in an aerodynamics research position in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in [[World War II]] before joining the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]). He became Chief of Numerical Analysis there and worked on the well-known [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions'' before joining Brown in 1963.\n\nHe was awarded the [[Chauvenet Prize]] for mathematical writing in 1963 for an article on the [[gamma function]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Davis, Philip J.|title=Leonhard Euler's Integral: An Historical Profile of the Gamma Function|journal=Amer.

He was a frequent invited lecturer and authored several books. Among the best known are ''[[The Mathematical Experience]]'' (with [[Reuben Hersh]]), a popular survey of modern mathematics and its [[history of mathematics|history]] and [[Philosophy of mathematics|philosophy]]; ''Methods of Numerical Integration'' (with [[Philip Rabinowitz (mathematician)|Philip Rabinowitz]]),<ref>{{cite journal|author=Barnhill, Robert E.|title=Review: ''Methods of numerical integration'', by Philip J.

In addition, he published works of fiction. His best-known book outside the field of mathematics is ''The Thread: A Mathematical Yarn'' (1983, 2nd ed. 1989), which \"has raised Digression into a literary form\" (Gerard Piel); it takes off from the name of the Russian mathematician [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Tschebyscheff]], and in the course of explaining why he insists on that \"barbaric, Teutonic, non-standard orthography\" (in the words of a reader of ''Interpolation and Approximation'' who wrote him to complain) he digresses in many amusing directions.\n\nDavis died on March 13, 2018 at the age of 95.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/philip-j-davis-professor-emeritus|title=Philip J.

As a child, he was often ill, suffering from a variety of conditions. In 1955, young Carl took advantage of the temporary political thaw following [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953, obtained a 1-month visa to [[West Germany]] and biked there, then decided to stay when he learned there that his application to [[Humboldt University]] (in [[East Berlin]]) for the study of chemistry had been turned down (because of his poor performance in mathematics).  However, [[Otto Friedrich]] (a brother of Carl's father's first wife) was willing and able to help him. Two years later, he met and fell in love with Otto's niece, Matilda Friedrich, the daughter of [[Carl Friedrich]], the political scientist and constitutional scholar.  With the support of the Friedrich family, Carl emigrated to the United States in 1959, learning English on his trip across the Atlantic (he could read [[Beatrix Potter]] when he boarded the boat).\n\n==Education and career==\nHaving earned only a high school diploma after 3 and a half years of study at [[Hamburg University]], de Boor entered [[Harvard]] as a graduate student of mathematics. After working for a year as a research assistant to [[Garrett Birkhoff]], he went to work for [[General Motors]] Research in [[Warren, Michigan]], where he met [[Spline (mathematics)|splines]]. He received his first postgraduate degree, a Ph.D. from the [[University of Michigan]], in 1966, and then became an assistant professor at [[Purdue University]].  In 1972, he accepted a position as professor of mathematics and computer science at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], working out of the UW's Army Math Research Center, which had [[Sterling Hall bombing|recently been bombed]] in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Research and teaching==\nA chief attraction of the UW job was the opportunity to work directly with [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg|Isaac Schoenberg]], considered the father of splines, the piecewise polynomials de Boor would further develop.  In particular, he formulated a relatively fast and numerically stable [[De Boor algorithm|algorithm]] for calculating the values of [[spline (mathematics)|spline]]s (used extensively in [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer graphics]]), and advocated for the formulation of spline functions in terms of the basis splines, or [[B-spline]]s developed by [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Haskell Curry|Curry]].\nHe was a teacher, guiding numerous graduate students. He is the author of a number of works, including an introductory textbook on numerical analysis (with S.D. Conte) and a textbook on spline approximation. Carl has also worked with [[MATLAB]] extensively over the years and is the author of the Spline Toolbox.\n\nCarl de Boor retired from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 2003 and relocated to the Pacific Northwest, where he continues to work with colleagues on mathematical problems, and to travel.  He currently lives on [[Orcas Island]], in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state, with his second wife, [[Helen Bee]], author of numerous texts in [[human development (psychology)|human development]], to whom he has been married since 1991.  In addition to his emeritus status at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], he is also an affiliated professor at the [[University of Washington]].\n\nde Boor has been listed as an ISI Highly Cited Author in Mathematics by the [[ISI Web of Knowledge]], Thomson Scientific Company.<ref>[http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Browse&link2=Results&id=2487 ISI Highly Cited Author - Carl R. de Boor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304073635/http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Browse&link2=Results&id=2487 |date=March 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1997 he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and he received the 2003 [[National Medal of Science]] in [[mathematics]].<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=5000000000425 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref>  Other honors have included election to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1987 and the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1993, honorary degrees from [[Purdue University]] and [[Technion]] (the Israel Institute of Technology), as well as membership in the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]] in Germany and the [[Polish Academy of Science]].  He won the [[John von Neumann Lecture]] Prize from the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] in 1996 and the [[John A. Gregory]] Award of Geometric Design in 2009.\n\n==Personal==\nCarl is a lover of music—especially classical, and more especially [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]—walks, good food, and games of all sorts. \nIn 1981, he bought his first personal computer, an [[Apple II family|Apple II]] with 32KB of memory with an old reel-to-reel tape recorder hooked up to store programs. He required his children to write any computer games they wished to play. With them he wrote an accounting program for tracking his checkbook, which he kept using long after the kids went to college, though he had to edit the program to use the Z key for recording a new transaction when the R key finally wore out, as well as implementations of a number of his children's favorite board games.\n\nHe is a lover of the quirky and easily enthralled by art. He used to keep a print of [[The Garden of Earthly Delights]] in his dining room, to the distress of some of his children, and others.\n\nCarl learned to play the [[cornet]], as a child, to combat [[asthma]].  He was also fed a vast quantity of raw eggs, whipped with a sprinkle of sugar, supposedly to help strengthen him during his early, sickly years. As a father, he made his children eat such egg treats.\n\nDuring his Madison years, he played the bass drum in the neighborhood 4 July Parade, and each August celebrates his arrival in the United States, where he is a citizen.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/cv.pdf Carl de Boor's curriculum vitae]\n* Y.K.

While working on his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] in computational and engineering mathematics under the supervision of Sir Richard Southwell he was also engaged in highly secret war work. He worked on the numerical solution of [[partial differential equation]]s at a time when numerical linear algebra was performed on a desk calculator. Computational efficiency and accuracy was thus even more important than in the days of electronic computers.  Some of this work was published after the end of the [[Second World War]] jointly with his supervisor [[Richard V. Southwell|Richard Southwell]].\n\nOn gaining his doctorate in 1942 Fox joined the Admiralty Computing service. Following the war, in 1945 he went to work in the mathematics division of the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]].  He left the National Physical Laboratory in 1956 and spent a year at the [[University of California]]. In 1957 Fox took up an appointment at Oxford University where he set up the Computing Laboratory. In 1963 Fox was appointed as Professor of Numerical Analysis at Oxford and Fellow of [[Balliol College, Oxford]].\n\nFox's laboratory at Oxford was one of the founding organisations of the [[Numerical Algorithms Group]], and Fox was also a dedicated supporter of the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]] (IMA). The [[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]] of the IMA is named in his honour.\n\n==Mathematical work==\nA detailed description of Fox's mathematical research can be found in obituaries<ref>David F. Mayers and Joan E. Walsh, Bulletin London Maths Soc. 31 (1999), 241–247.{{cite web |url=http://users.comlab.ox.ac.uk/endre.suli/fox/Fox.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009084743/http://users.comlab.ox.ac.uk/endre.suli/fox/Fox.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2006 |df= }}</ref>\n<ref>J. H. Wilkinson, Fox, Leslie Obituary: .  Comput. J.  30  (1987),  no. 1, 1. 01A70</ref> and is summarised here. His early work with Southwell was concerned with the numerical solution of partial differential equations arising in engineering problems that, due to the complexity of their geometry, did not have analytical solutions.  Southwell's group developed  efficient and accurate [[relaxation method]]s, which could be implemented on desk calculators. Fox's contributions were particularly notable because he combined practical skills with theoretical advances in relaxation methods,<ref>Fox, L. Solution by relaxation methods of plane potential problems with mixed boundary conditions.  Quart. Appl. Math.  2, (1944)</ref> which were to become important areas of research in numerical analysis.  During the 1950 automatic electronic computers were replacing manual electro-mechanical devices. This led to different problems in the implementation of numerical algorithms, however the approach of approximating a partial differential equation by [[finite difference method]] and thus reducing the problem to a system of linear equations was the same. Careful analysis of the errors were a theme of many of Fox's early papers.  His work at the [[Admiralty Computing Service]] and the National Physical Laboratory led to an interest in the computation of [[special function]]s, and his calculations were used in published tables. The techniques applied to the computation of special functions had much wider applicability including [[interpolation]], stability of [[recurrence relation]]s and asymptotic behaviour. \n\nDuring the 1950s the group at the National Physics Laboratory worked on [[numerical linear algebra]], and led to the publication of algorithms by [[James H. Wilkinson|Wilkinson]] and others.  While not directly involved in development of numerical software he supported others in this endeavour.  Fox worked on procedures for solving differential equations in which accuracy of the solution is estimated using asymptotic estimates.  Fox's paper on this in 1947<ref>Fox, L. Some improvements in the use of relaxation methods for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations.  Proc. Roy. Soc. London. Ser. A.  190, (1947). 31—59</ref> led to the work of Victor Pereyra error-correcting algorithms for boundary-value problems and Stetter's results on defect correction and the resulting order of convergence. \n\nFox was also interested in the treatment of singularities in partial differential equations, the [[Stefan problem]] and other cases of free and moving boundaries. Many of these problems arose from his collaboration with mathematicians in industry through the [[European Study Groups with Industry|Oxford Study Group]]s.\n\n==Fox's wider influence==\nWhile Fox influenced the development of numerical analysis through his undergraduate teaching and postgraduate supervision (he supervised around 19 doctoral students), industrial collaboration he also made significant contributions to course material for the [[Open University]].  He lectured widely on 'meaningless answers', describing some of the pitfalls of numerical computation from the uncritical use of simple methods\n\nFox played a significant part in the early days of the [[Numerical Algorithms Group]] (NAG), which set out as a collaborative venture between Oxford, [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]] and [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Manchester]] to provide a reliable and well-tested mathematical subroutine library. The Oxford Computing Laboratory was one of the founder members of NAG when it started in 1970, and Fox supported it strongly and he became a member of its council when the Group was incorporated in 1976 continuing in this capacity until 1984. \n\nFox was an active member of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications from its beginnings, as a member of the Council and as an editor first of the main '''IMA Journal'' and later the specialised [[Journal of Numerical Analysis]], started in 1981.  The IMA marked his retirement from Oxford in 1983 by a special IMA symposium on 'The contributions of Leslie Fox to numerical analysis'.\n\nHis interests extended to mathematics in schools and he participated the development of the [[School Mathematics Project]], and was active in the local branch of the [[Mathematical Association]], of which he was President in 1964. The first winner of the IMA's [[Leslie Fox prize for Numerical Analysis]] in 1985, [[Lloyd N. Trefethen]], went on to be appointed to the chair in Numerical Analysis at Oxford that was created for Leslie Fox in 1963.\n\n==Personal life==\nLeslie Fox's mother was Annie Vincent and his father was Job Senior Fox who was a coalminer. Leslie won a scholarship to [[Wheelwright Grammar School]] in Dewsbury which produced several notable scientists from the same period as Fox. \n\nHe was a keen sportsman and played [[Association football|football]] for the university Football Club as well as for [[Oxford City Football Club]]. At the National Physical Laboratory he was club [[tennis]] champion and captain of the cricket team, he also distinguished himself as a sprinter in the civil service championships.\n\nFox, who had enjoyed good health up to 1981, suffered from heart problems during his retirement and died from a [[ruptured aneurysm]] in the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford in 1992.\n\n==Selected publications==\n*Leslie Fox, The Numerical Solution of Two-Point Boundary Problems in Ordinary Differential Equations, 1957, reprinted by Dover 1990 {{ISBN|0-486-66495-3}}\n*L Fox, An introduction to numerical linear algebra, 1964, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|0-19-500325-X}}\n*L Fox, D.F.

He is the author or coauthor of more than 100 research articles and two books, and co-editor of two other books.  With his students, he has developed a widely used mathematical software package (SPARSPAK) for solving sparse systems of equations and sparse least squares problems.\n\nHe is also well known at the [[University of Waterloo]] for having served in a number of senior administrative positions, notably Vice-President, Provost, and Dean of Mathematics. \n\n== Education ==\n\nGeorge received a [[B.Sc.]] and [[M.Sc.]] from the [[University of Alberta]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively, and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1971.  His doctoral thesis was entitled ''Computer Implementation of the Finite Element Method'' and his supervisor was [[George Forsythe]].\n\n== Administrative service ==\n\nHe served as Dean of the [[Faculty of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] from 1980 to 1986.  From 1986 to 1988 he held the position of Distinguished Scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and University Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  He held the position of Vice-President, Academic & Provost from 1988 until June 30, 1993.  He again served as Dean of Mathematics from December 3, 1997 to June 30, 2005.
