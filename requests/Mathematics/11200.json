It is reconstructed by modern linguists as having been either a [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]] {{audio-IPA|Voiced pharyngealized alveolar lateral fricative.ogg|[ɮˤ]}} or a similar [[affricate]]d sound {{IPAblink|d͡ɮ|d͡ɮˤ}} or {{IPAblink|d͡ɮ|dˡˤ}}.<ref name=Versteegh1999/><ref name=Versteegh2000/> The affricated form is suggested by loans of ''ḍ'' into Akkadian as ''ld'' or ''lṭ'' and into Malaysian as ''dl''.<ref name=\"Versteegh1997\" /> However, not all linguists agree on this; the French orientalist André Roman supposes that the letter was actually a voiced emphatic alveolo-palatal sibilant {{IPAslink|ʑ|ʑˤ}}, similar to the Polish ''[[ź]]''.<ref name=Versteegh1999/><ref name=Versteegh2000/><ref name=Roman1983/>\n\nThis is an extremely unusual sound, and led the early Arabic grammarians to describe Arabic as the {{lang|ar|لغة الضاد}} ''lughat aḍ-ḍād'' \"the language of the ''ḍād''\", since the sound was thought to be unique to Arabic.<ref name=\"Versteegh1997\" /> \nThe emphatic lateral nature of this sound is possibly inherited from [[Proto-Semitic]], and is compared to a phoneme in [[South Semitic]] languages such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]] (where it is usually an [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[lateral fricative]]). \nThe corresponding letter in the  [[South Arabian alphabet]] is [[File:himjar za2.PNG|14px|ḍ]] {{transl|sem|ṣ́}}, and in [[Ge'ez alphabet]]  '''{{transl|sem|Ṣ́appa}}''' <span style=\"font-size:140%;\">ፀ</span>), although in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] it merged early on with ''{{transl|sem|ṣ}}.'' \n\nThe reconstruction of [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] phonology includes an emphatic [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPAblink|ɬ|ɬʼ}} or [[Ejective alveolar lateral affricate|affricate]] {{IPAblink|tɬ|t͡ɬʼ}} for ''{{transl|sem|ṣ́}}''. This sound is considered to be the direct ancestor of Arabic ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍād}}'', while merging with {{transl|sem|ṣād}} in most other [[Semitic languages]].\n\nThe letter itself is distinguished a derivation, by addition of a [[Arabic diacritics|diacritic dot]], from [[ص]] ''ṣād'' (representing /sˤ/).\n\n==Pronunciation==\n[[File:The_main_Pronunciations_of_written_ض_in_Arabic_dialects.png|thumb|The main pronunciations of written {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ض}}}} in Arabic dialects.|500x500px]]\nThe standard pronunciation of this letter in modern [[Standard Arabic]] is the \"[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]\" {{IPA|/d/}}: [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] [[voiced alveolar stop]] {{audio-IPA|Voiced_pharyngealized_alveolar_stop.ogg|[dˤ]}}, pharyngealized voiced dental stop {{IPAblink|d̪|d̪ˤ}} or [[velarization|velarized]] voiced dental stop {{IPAblink|d̪|d̪ˠ}}.<ref name=Versteegh1997/>\n\nIn most Bedouin influenced Arabic vernaculars {{lang|ar|ض}} ''ḍād'' and {{lang|ar|ظ}} ''[[ẓāʾ]]'' have been merged quite early.<ref name=Versteegh1999/> like in the varieties (such as [[Bedouin Arabic|Bedouin]] and [[Mesopotamian Arabic|Iraqi]]), where the dental fricatives are preserved, both the letters are pronounced {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}.<ref name=Versteegh1999/><ref name=Versteegh2000/><ref name=Ferguson1997/> However, there are dialects in South Arabia and in [[Hassaniya Arabic|Mauritania]] where both the letters are kept different but not in all contexts.<ref name=Versteegh1999/> In other vernaculars such as Egyptian the distinction between {{lang|ar|ض}} ''ḍād'' and {{lang|ar|ظ}} ''[[ẓāʾ]]'' is most of the time made; but Classical Arabic ''ẓāʾ'' often becomes {{IPA|/zˤ/}}, e.g. ''ʿaẓīm'' (< Classical {{lang|ar|عظيم}} ''ʿaḏ̣īm'') \"great\".<ref name=Versteegh1999/><ref name=Versteegh2000/><ref name=\"Retsö2012\"/>\n\n\"De-emphaticized\" pronunciation of the both letters in the form of the plain {{IPA|/z/}} entered into other non-Arabic languages such as Persian, Urdu, Turkish.<ref name=Versteegh1999/> However, there do exist Arabic borrowings into [[Ibero-Romance languages]] as well as Hausa and Malay, where ''ḍād'' and ''ẓāʾ'' are differentiated.<ref name=Versteegh1999/>\n\n==Transliteration==\n{{lang|ar|ض}} is transliterated as ''ḍ'' ([[D]] with [[dot (diacritic)|underdot]]) in [[romanization of Arabic|romanization]].\n\nWhen transliterating Arabic in the Hebrew alphabet,  it is either written as {{Hebrew|[[ד]]}} (the letter for {{IPAslink|d}}) or as [[Romanization of Hebrew#فغغTable|{{Hebrew|צ׳}}]] (''[[tsadi]]'' with [[geresh]]).\n\n==Unicode==\n\n{{charmap\n|0636|name1=Arabic Letter Dad\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Arabic phonology]]\n*{{transl|sem|[[Sat (letter)|Sat]]}}\n*{{transl|sem|[[Śawt]]}}\n*{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Ḍ]]}}\n\n==References==\n<references>\n<ref name=Ferguson1959>{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Charles|title=The Arabic koine|journal=Language|date=1959|volume=35|issue=4|page=630|doi=10.2307/410601|url=}}</ref>\n<ref name=Ferguson1997>{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Charles Albert|editor1-last=Belnap|editor1-first=R.

The Arabic letter {{lang|ar|ذ}} is named {{lang|ar|ذال}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|ḏāl}}''.

Canaanite languages and Hebrew later also merged it with ʻayin, and this merger was complete in [[Tiberian Hebrew]].  The [[South Arabian alphabet]] retained a symbol for ''{{transl|sem|ġ}},'' 𐩶. Biblical Hebrew, as of the 3rd century BCE, apparently still distinguished the phonemes ġ /ʁ/ and ḫ /χ/, based on transcriptions in the [[Septuagint]]. (example: [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]] is represented in Hebrew as {{Hebrew|עֲמֹרָה}}, which sounds like ''‘Ămōrāh'' in Modern Hebrew; however, the Greek transcription of ''Γομορραν'', ''Gomoras'', suggests that at this point in time the Hebrew lemma was still pronounced as ''Ġămōrāh'')\n\nThe letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ghayn}}'' (<big>{{lang|ar|غ}}</big>) is sometimes used to represent the [[voiced velar plosive]] {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in loan words and names in Arabic and is then often pronounced {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, not {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.

For instance, in Egypt, where <big>{{lang|ar|ج}}</big> is pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in all situations, even when speaking Modern Standard Arabic (except in certain contexts, such as reciting the [[Qur'an]]), <big>{{lang|ar|ج}}</big> is used to transcribe foreign {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in virtually all contexts. In many cases <big>{{lang|ar|غ}}</big> is pronounced in loan words as expected—{{IPAslink|ɣ}}, not {{IPAslink|ɡ}}—even though the original language had {{IPAslink|ɡ}}.\n\nWhen representing this sound in transliteration of Arabic into Hebrew, it is written as ע׳.\n\nIn English, the letter <big>{{lang|ar|غ}}</big> in Arabic names is usually transliterated as ‹{{transl|ar|ALA|gh}}›, ‹{{transl|ar|DIN|ġ}}›, or simply ‹g›, e.g. {{lang|ar|بغداد}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Baghdād}}'' '[[Baghdad]]', or {{lang|ar|غزة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Ghazzah}}'' '[[Gaza City|Gaza]]', the latter of which does not render the sound {{IPAblink|ɣ}}~{{IPAblink|ʁ}} accurately.

In most cases, the letters transcribe consonants, or consonants and a few vowels, so most Arabic alphabets are [[abjad]]s.\n\nThe script was first used to write texts in Arabic, most notably the [[Qur'an|{{transl|ar|ALA|Qurʼān}}]], the holy book of [[Islam]]. With the spread of Islam, it came to be used to write languages of many language families, leading to the addition of new letters and other symbols, with some versions, such as [[Kurdish alphabets#Sorani alphabet|Kurdish]], [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet|Uyghur]], and old [[Arebica|Bosnian]] being [[abugida]]s or true [[alphabet]]s.

Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent [[phoneme]]s that do not appear in Arabic [[phonology]]. For example, the Arabic language lacks a [[voiceless bilabial plosive]] (the {{IPA|[p]}} sound), so many languages add their own letter to represent {{IPA|[p]}} in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language. These modifications tend to fall into groups: all the [[India]]n and [[Turkic languages]] written in the Arabic script tend to use the [[Persian alphabet|Persian modified letters]], whereas the [[languages of Indonesia]] tend to imitate those of [[Jawi (script)|Jawi]]. The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] by scholars.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the cases of [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]],  [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] [[writing system]]s, vowels are mandatory. The Arabic script can therefore be used in both [[abugida]] and [[abjad]], although it is often strongly if erroneously connected to the latter.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nUse of the Arabic script in [[West Africa]]n languages, especially in the [[Sahel]], developed with the spread of [[Islam]]. To a certain degree the style and usage tends to follow those of the [[Maghreb]] (for instance the position of the dots in the letters ''[[Pe (letter)|{{transl|ar|ALA|fāʼ}}]]'' and ''[[Qoph|{{transl|ar|ALA|qāf}}]]''). Additional diacritics have come into use to facilitate writing of sounds not represented in the Arabic language. The term ''[[Ajami script|{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻAjamī}}]]'', which comes from the Arabic root for \"foreign\", has been applied to Arabic-based orthographies of African languages.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Current use===\nToday Afghanistan, Iran, India, Pakistan and China are the main non-Arabic speaking states using the Arabic alphabet to write one or more official national languages, including [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]], [[Brahui language|Brahui]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Central Kurdish]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAn Arabic alphabet is currently used for the following languages:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n====Middle East and Central Asia====\n{{Calligraphy}}\n{{See also|Perso-Arabic alphabet}}\n* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]\n* [[Garshuni]] (or Karshuni) originated in the 7th century, when Arabic was becoming the dominant spoken language in the Fertile Crescent, but Arabic script was not yet fully developed or widely read, and so the [[Syriac alphabet]] was used.

This choice could be influenced by Arabic being their second language, the language of scripture of their faith, or the only written language they came in contact with. Additionally, since most education was once religious, choice of script was determined by the writer's religion; which meant that Muslims would use Arabic script to write whatever language they spoke. This led to Arabic script being the most widely used script during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Arabic script was generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] in the [[Balkans]],{{dubious|date=November 2011}} parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Asia]], while in the [[Soviet Union]], after a brief period of [[Latinisation (USSR)|Latinisation]],<ref>[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/52_folder/52_articles/52_alphabet.html Alphabet Transitions – The Latin Script: A New Chronology – Symbol of a New Azerbaijan], by Tamam Bayatly</ref> use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] was mandated. [[Turkey]] changed to the Latin alphabet in 1928 as part of an internal Westernizing revolution. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the Turkic languages of the ex-USSR attempted to follow Turkey's lead and convert to a Turkish-style Latin alphabet.

These formal systems, which often make use of [[diacritics]] and non-standard Latin characters and are used in academic settings or for the benefit of non-speakers, contrast with informal means of written communication used by speakers such as the Latin-based [[Arabic chat alphabet]].\n\nDifferent systems and strategies have been developed to address the inherent problems of rendering various Arabic varieties in the Latin script. Examples of such problems are the symbols for Arabic [[phoneme]]s that do not exist in [[English language|English]] or other [[Europe]]an languages; the means of representing the [[Arabic definite article]], which is always spelled the same way in written Arabic but has numerous pronunciations in the spoken language depending on context; and the representation of short vowels (usually ''i&nbsp;u'' or ''e&nbsp;o''<span style=\"margin-left:1px\">,</span> accounting for variations such as ''[[Muslim]]<span style=\"margin:1.5px\">/</span>Moslem'' or ''[[Mohammed]]<span style=\"margin:1.5px\">/</span>Muhammad<span style=\"margin:1.5px\">/</span>Mohamed''<span style=\"margin-left:2px\">)</span>.\n\n==Method==\nRomanization is often termed \"transliteration\", but this is not technically correct.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} ''[[Transliteration]]'' is the direct representation of foreign ''letters'' using Latin symbols, while most systems for romanizing Arabic are actually ''[[Phonetic transcription|transcription]]'' systems, which represent the ''sound'' of the language. As an example, the above rendering ''{{transl|ar|ALA|munāẓaratu l-ḥurūfi l-ʻarabīyah}}'' of the {{lang-ar|مناظرة&nbsp;الحروف&nbsp;العربية}} is a transcription, indicating the pronunciation; an example transliteration would be ''{{transl|ar|mnaẓrḧ&nbsp;alḥrwf&nbsp;alʻrbyḧ}}''.\n\n== Romanization standards and systems ==\nPrincipal standards and systems are:\n\n===Mixed [[digraph (orthography)|digraphic]] and [[diacritics|diacritical]] ===\n* '''[[BGN/PCGN romanization|BGN/PCGN]]''' romanization (1956).<ref name=BGN-PCGN>{{cite web|title=Romanization system for Arabic.

Hence unvocalized [[Abjad|Arabic writing]] does not give a reader unfamiliar with the language sufficient information for accurate pronunciation.  As a result, a pure [[transliteration]], e.g., rendering {{lang|ar|قطر}} as '''{{transl|ar|qṭr}}''', is meaningless to an untrained reader.  For this reason, [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s are generally used that add vowels, e.g. '''{{transl|ar|ALA|qaṭar}}'''. However, unvocalized systems match exactly to written Arabic, unlike vocalized systems such as Arabic chat, which some claim detracts from one's ability to spell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/education/arabizi-sparks-concern-among-educators-1.1181529 |title=Arabizi sparks concern among educators |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Transliteration vs. transcription ===\nMost uses of romanization call for [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] rather than [[transliteration]]: Instead of transliterating each written letter, they try to reproduce the sound of the words according to the orthography rules of the target language: ''Qaṭar''.  This applies equally to scientific and popular applications.  A pure transliteration would need to omit vowels (e.g. ''qṭr&#x202f;''), making the result difficult to interpret except for a subset of trained readers fluent in Arabic.  Even if vowels are added, a transliteration system would still need to distinguish between multiple ways of spelling the same sound in the Arabic script, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif&#x202f;}}'' {{lang|ar|2=<span style=\"font-family:serif; font-size:large\">ا</span>}} vs. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif&nbsp;maqṣūrah}}'' {{lang|ar|ى}} for the sound {{IPA|/aː/}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}'', and the six different ways ({{lang|ar|ء إ أ آ ؤ ئ}}) of writing the [[glottal stop]] ([[hamza]], usually transcribed ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʼ&nbsp;}}'').  This sort of detail is needlessly confusing, except in a very few situations (e.g., typesetting text in the Arabic script).\n\nMost issues related to the romanization of Arabic are about transliterating vs. transcribing; others, about what should be romanized:\n* Some transliterations ignore [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]'' before the \"[[sun letters]]\", and may be easily misread by non-Arabic speakers.  For instance, \"the light\" {{lang|ar|النور}} ''an-nūr'' would be more literally transliterated along the lines of ''alnūr''. In the transcription ''an-nūr'', a hyphen is added and the unpronounced {{IPAslink|l}} removed for the convenience of the uninformed non-Arabic speaker, who would otherwise pronounce an {{IPA|/l/}}, perhaps not understanding that {{IPA|/n/}} in ''nūr'' is [[gemination|geminated]]. Alternatively, if the [[shaddah]] is not transliterated (since it is strictly not a letter), a strictly literal transliteration would be ''alnūr'', which presents similar problems for the uninformed non-Arabic speaker.\n* A transliteration should render the \"closed tāʼ&#x202f;\" (''[[Ta' marbuta|tāʼ marbūṭah]]'', {{lang|ar|ة}}) faithfully. Many transcriptions render the sound {{IPA|/a/}} as ''a'' or ''ah'' and ''t'' when it denotes {{IPA|/at/}}.\n**[[ISO 233]] has a unique symbol, ẗ.\n* \"Restricted alif\" (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'', {{lang|ar|ى}}) should be transliterated with an [[acute accent]], ''á'', differentiating it from regular alif {{lang|ar|ا}}, but it is transcribed in many schemes like alif, ''ā'', because it stands for {{IPA|/aː/}}.\n* [[Nunation]]: what is true elsewhere is also true for nunation: transliteration renders what is seen, transcription what is heard, when in the Arabic script, it is written with diacritics, not by letters, or omitted.\n\nA transcription may reflect the language as spoken, typically rendering names, for example, by the people of Baghdad ([[Baghdad Arabic]]), or the official standard ([[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]]) as spoken by a [[imam|preacher]] in the mosque or a TV newsreader. A transcription is free to add phonological (such as vowels) or morphological (such as word boundaries) information. Transcriptions will also vary depending on the writing conventions of the target language; compare English ''[[Omar Khayyam]]'' with German ''Omar Chajjam'', both for {{lang|ar|عمر&nbsp;خيام}} {{IPA|/ʕumar&nbsp;xajjaːm/}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈʕomɑr&nbsp;xæjˈjæːm|}} (unvocalized ''{{transl|ar|ʿmr&nbsp;ḫyām}}'', vocalized ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻUmar&nbsp;Khayyām}}'').\n\nA transliteration is ideally fully reversible: a machine should be able to transliterate it back into Arabic. A transliteration can be considered as flawed for any one of the following reasons:\n*A \"loose\" transliteration is ambiguous, rendering several Arabic phonemes with an identical transliteration, or such that digraphs for a single phoneme (such as ''dh&nbsp;gh&nbsp;kh&nbsp;sh&nbsp;th'' rather than ''ḏ&nbsp;ġ&nbsp;ḫ&nbsp;š&nbsp;ṯ&#x202f;'') may be confused with two adjacent consonants—but this problem is resolved in the [[ALA-LC]] romanization system, where the [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] <span title=\"Prime symbol\" style=\"font-size:140%\">ʹ</span> is used to separate two consonants when they do not form a digraph;<ref>{{cite web|title=Arabic|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/arabic.pdf|work=ALA-LC Romanization Tables|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2013-06-14|page=9|format=PDF|quote=21. The prime (ʹ) is used: (a) To separate two letters representing two distinct consonantal sounds, when the combination might otherwise be read as a digraph.}}</ref> for example: {{lang|ar|أَكْرَمَتْها}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|akramatʹhā}}'' ('she honored her'), in which the ''t'' and ''h'' are two distinct consonantal sounds.\n*Symbols representing phonemes may be considered too similar (e.g., <span title=\"Grave accent\" style=\"font-size:140%\">`</span> and <span title=\"Apostrophe\" style=\"font-size:140%\">'</span> or <span title=\"Modifier letter left half ring\" style=\"font-size:170%\">ʿ</span> and <span title=\"Modifier letter right half ring\" style=\"font-size:170%\">ʾ</span>  for {{lang|ar|ع}} [[ayin|ʻayn]] and [[hamzah]]);\n*ASCII transliterations using capital letters to disambiguate phonemes are easy to type, but may be considered unaesthetic.\n\nA fully accurate transcription may not be necessary for native Arabic speakers, as they would be able to pronounce names and sentences correctly anyway, but it can be very useful for those not fully familiar with spoken Arabic and who are familiar with the Roman alphabet.  An accurate transliteration serves as a valuable stepping stone for learning, pronouncing correctly, and distinguishing phonemes.  It is a useful tool for anyone who is familiar with the sounds of Arabic but not fully conversant in the language.\n\nOne criticism is that a fully accurate system would require special learning that most do not have to actually pronounce names correctly, and that with a lack of a universal romanization system they will not be pronounced correctly by non-native speakers anyway.  The precision will be lost if special characters are not replicated and if a reader is not familiar with Arabic pronunciation.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nExamples in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The major head of this movement was [[Louis Massignon]], a French Orientalist, who brought his concern before the Arabic Language Academy in Damascus in 1928. Massignon’s attempt at romanization failed as the Academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the Western world to take over their country. Sa’id Afghani, a member of the Academy, asserted that the movement to romanize the script was a Zionist plan to dominate Lebanon.<ref name=\"shrivtiel179\">{{cite book|last=Shrivtiel|first=Shraybom|title=The Question of Romanisation of the Script and The Emergence of Nationalism in the Middle East|date=1998|publisher=Mediterranean Language Review|pages=179–196}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">History of Arabic Writing</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nAfter the period of colonialism in Egypt, Egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and reemphasize Egyptian culture.

This change in script, he believed, would solve the problems inherent with Arabic, such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words.<ref name=\"shrivtiel179\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref>Shrivtiel, p. 188</ref> Ahmad Lutfi As Sayid and Muhammad Azmi, two Egyptian intellectuals, agreed with Musa and supported the push for romanization.<ref name=\"shrivtiel179\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in Egypt continued with Abd Al Aziz Fahmi in 1944.

It is also known as Arabic skeleton script.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the early Arabic manuscripts that survive today (physical manuscripts dated 7th and 8th centuries AD), one finds dots but \"putting dots was in no case compulsory\".<ref name=Kaplony>[https://www.academia.edu/10856768/What_Are_Those_Few_Dots_For_Thoughts_on_the_Orthography_of_the_Qurra_Papyri_709-710_the_Khurasan_Parchments_755-777_and_the_Inscription_of_the_Jerusalem_Dome_of_the_Rock_692_ \"What Are Those Few Dots for?

When isolated and in the final position, the 18 letters are visually distinct. However, in the initial and medial positions, certain letters that are distinct otherwise are not differentiated visually. This results in only 15 visually distinct glyphs each in the initial and medial positions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Final\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Medial\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Initial\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Isolated\n! colspan=\"5\" |  Rasm\n|-\n!

Most writing would have been on perishable materials, such as papyrus. As it was cursive, it was liable to change. The [[epigraph (archeology)|epigraph]]ic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic.\n\nThe Nabataean alphabet was designed to write 22 [[phoneme]]s, but Arabic has 28 phonemes; thus, when used to write the Arabic language, 6 of its letters must each represent two phonemes:\n<br>''d'' also represented ''ð'',\n<br>''ħ'' also represented ''kh'' '''%''',\n<br>''ṭ'' also represented ''ẓ'',\n<br>''ayin'' also represented ''gh'' '''%''', \n<br>''ṣ'' also represented ''ḍ'','''%''',\n<br>''t'' also represented ''þ''.\n<br>: In the cases marked '''%''', the choice was influenced by [[etymology]], as Common Semitic ''kh'' and ''gh'' became Hebrew ''ħ'' and ''[[ayin]]'' respectively.\n\nAs cursive Nabataean writing evolved into Arabic writing, the writing became largely joined-up. Some of the letters became the same shape as other letters, producing more ambiguities, as in the table:\n\n[[Image:Arabe arch.png]]\n{{see also|rasm}}\n\nHere the Arabic letters are listed in the traditional Levantine order but are written in their current forms, for simplicity. The letters which are the same shape have coloured backgrounds. The second value of the letters that represent more than one [[phoneme]] is after a comma. In these tables, ''ğ'' is ''j'' as in English \"June\".\n<br>In the Arabic language, the ''g'' sound seems to have changed into ''j'' in fairly late pre-Islamic times, but this seems not to have happened in those tribes who invaded [[Egypt]] and settled there.\n\nWhen a letter was at the end of a word, it often developed an end loop, and as a result most Arabic letters have two or more shapes.\n<br>''b'' and ''n'' and ''t'' became the same.\n<br>''y'' became the same as ''b'' and ''n'' and ''t'' except at the ends of words.\n<br>''j'' and ''ħ'' became the same.\n<br>''z'' and ''r'' became the same.\n<br>''s'' and ''sh'' became the same.\n\nAfter all this, there were only 17 letters that were different in shape. One letter-shape represented 5 phonemes (''b t th n'' and sometimes ''y''), one represented 3 phonemes (''j ħ kh''), and 5 each represented 2 phonemes. Compare the Hebrew alphabet, as in the table at [[:Image:Hebreu hist arabe.png]].\n\nA similar ambiguity occurs in the German [[Fraktur]] font, in which the Roman alphabet uppercase letters '''I''' and '''J''' look the same but are officially different letters.\n\n==Early Islamic changes==\n[[Image:D r nabat syriaque.png|thumb|right|Table comparing Nabataean and Syriac forms of /d/ and /r/]]\nThe Arabic alphabet is first attested in its classical form in the 7th century. See [[PERF 558]] for the first surviving Islamic Arabic writing.\n\nIn the 7th century, probably in the early years of [[Islam]] while writing down the [[Qur'an]], scribes realized that working out which of the ambiguous letters a particular letter was from context was laborious and not always possible, so a proper remedy was required. Writings in the Nabataean and Syriac alphabets already had sporadic examples of dots being used to distinguish letters which had become identical, for example as in the table on the right. By analogy with this, a system of dots was added to the Arabic alphabet to make enough different letters for [[Classical Arabic]]'s 28 phonemes. Sometimes the resulting new letters were put in alphabetical order after their un-dotted originals, and sometimes at the end.\n\nThe first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April, 643. The dots did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the [[Qur'an]] were frequently [[memorization|memorized]]; this practice, which survives even today, probably arose partly to avoid the great ambiguity of the script, and partly due to the scarcity of books in times when [[printing]] was unheard-of in the area and every copy of every book had to be written by hand.\n\nThe alphabet then had 28 letters, and so could be used to write the numbers 1 to 10, then 20 to 100, then 200 to 900, then 1000 (see [[Abjad numerals]]). In this numerical order, the new letters were put at the end of the alphabet. This produced this order: alif (1), b (2), j (3), d (4), h (5), w (6), z (7), H (8), T (9), y (10), k (20), l (30), m (40), n (50), s (60), ayn (70), f (80), S (90), q (100), r (200), sh (300), t (400), th (500), dh (600), kh (700), D (800), Z (900), gh (1000).\n\nThe lack of vowel signs in Arabic writing created more ambiguities: for example, in [[Classical Arabic]] ''ktb'' could be ''kataba'' = \"he wrote\", ''kutiba'' = \"it was written\" or ''kutub''=\"books\".\nLater, vowel signs and [[hamza]]s were added, beginning some time in the last half of the 6th century, at about the same time as the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew [[Speech production|vocalization]]. Initially, this was done using a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an [[Umayyad]] governor of [[Iraq]], [[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}: a dot above = ''a'', a dot below = ''i'', a dot on the line = ''u'', and doubled dots giving ''[[tanwin]]''. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by [[al-Farahidi]].\n\nBefore the historical decree by [[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], all administrative texts were recorded by [[Persian people|Persian]] scribes in [[Middle Persian]] language using [[Pahlavi script]], but many of the initial orthographic alterations to the Arabic alphabet might have been proposed and implemented by the same scribes.\n\nWhen new signs were added to the Arabic alphabet, they took the alphabetical order value of the letter which they were an alternative for: ''[[tā' marbūta]]'' (see also below) took the value of ordinary ''t'', and not of ''h''. In the same way, the many diacritics do not have any value: for example, a doubled consonant indicated by [[shadda]] does not count as a letter separate from the single one.\n\nSome features of the Arabic alphabet arose because of differences between [[Qur'an]]ic spelling (which followed the [[Makkah|Meccan]] dialect pronunciation used by [[Muhammad]] and his first followers) and the standard [[Classical Arabic]]. These include:\n*'''''tā' marbūta''''': This arose because the ''-at'' ending of feminine nouns ([[tā' marbūta]]) was often pronounced as ''-ah'' and written as ''h''. To avoid altering Quranic spelling, the dots of ''t'' were written over the ''h''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n*'''''y'' (alif maksura ى) used to spell ''ā'' at the ends of some words''': This arose because ''ā'' arising from [[sandhi|contraction]] where single ''y'' dropped out between vowels was in some dialects pronounced at the ends of words with the tongue further forward than for other ''ā'' vowels, and as a result in the Qu'ran it was written as ''y''.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n*'''''ā'' not written as [[aleph|alif]] in some words''': The Arabic spelling of ''[[Allah|Allāh]]'' was decided before the Arabs started using [[aleph|alif]] to spell ''ā''. In other cases (for example the first ''ā'' in ''hāðā'' = \"this\"), it may be that the Meccan dialect pronounced those vowels short.\n*'''hamza''': Originally [[aleph|alif]] was used to spell the [[glottal stop]]. But Meccans did not pronounce the glottal stop{{Verify source|date=March 2008}}, replacing it with ''w'', ''y'' or nothing, lengthening an adjacent vowel, or, between vowels, dropping the glottal stop and contracting the vowels, and the Qur'an was written following Meccan pronunciation. The Arabic grammarians invented the [[hamza]] [[diacritic]] sign and used it to mark the glottal stop. ''Hamza'' is Arabic for \"hook\".\n\n==Reorganization of the alphabet==\nLess than a century later, Arab grammarians reorganized the alphabet, for reasons of teaching, putting letters next to other letters which were nearly the same shape. This produced a new order which was not the same as the numeric order, which became less important over time because it was being competed with by the [[Indian numerals]] and sometimes by the [[Greek numerals]].\n\nThe Arabic grammarians of North Africa changed the new letters, which explains the differences between the alphabets of the East and the [[Maghreb]].\n\n<center>[[Image:Compare Arabic Hebrew etc.png]]</center>\n\n(Greek ''waw'' = the original name of the [[digamma]])\n\nThe old alphabetical order, as in the other alphabets shown here, is known as the [[Levant]]ine or [[Abjadi order]]. If the letters are arranged by their numeric order, the Levantine order is restored:-\n\n<center>[[Image:Compare Arabic Hebrew etc2.png]]</center>\n\n(Greek ''waw'' = the original name of the [[digamma]])\n\n(Note: here \"numeric order\" means the traditional values when these letters were used as numbers. See [[Hindu-Arabic numerals|Arabic numerals]], [[Greek numerals]] and [[Hebrew numerals]] for more details)\n<br>This order is much the oldest. The first written records of the Arabic alphabet show why the order was changed.\n\n==Adapting the Arabic alphabet for other languages==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Most Common Non-Classical Arabic Consonant Phonemes/Graphemes\n!Language Family\n!'''[[Austronesian languages|Austron.]]'''\n!'''[[Dravidian languages|Dravid]]'''\n![[Turkic languages|Turkic]]\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''[[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]]''' (Indo-European)\n! colspan=\"4\" |[[Iranian languages|Iranian]] (Indo-European)\n! rowspan=\"10\" |\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic]] (Semitic)\n|-\n!Language/Script\n![[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]\n![[Arwi]]\n![[Uyghur Arabic alphabet|Uyghur]]\n![[Sindhi alphabet|Sindhi]]\n![[Shahmukhi alphabet|Punjabi]]\n![[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]]\n![[Persian alphabet|Persian]]\n![[Balochi alphabet|Balochi]]\n![[Kurdish alphabets|Kurdish]]\n![[Pashto alphabet|Pashto]]\n![[Mesopotamian Arabic|Iraqi]]\n![[Hejazi Arabic|Hejazi]]\n![[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]]\n![[Algerian Arabic|Algerian]]\n![[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]]\n![[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|p}}\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڤ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڣ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"8\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[پ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"6\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[پ]]}}</big>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|g}}\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[Gaf|ݢ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[Gaf|ࢴ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"7\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[Gaf|گ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ګ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[Gaf|گ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ق]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ج]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"2\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڨ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڭ]]}}</big>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}}\n| colspan=\"3\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[چ]]}}</big>\n|Ø\n| colspan=\"6\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[چ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[چ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"4\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[تش]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڜ]]}}</big>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|ʒ}}\n| colspan=\"2\" |Ø\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ژ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"2\" |Ø\n| colspan=\"5\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ژ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"2\" |Ø\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[چ]]}}</big>\n|Ø\n| colspan=\"2\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ج]]}}</big>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|v}}\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ۏ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[و]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ۋ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"4\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[و]]}}</big>\n|Ø\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڤ]]}}</big>\n|Ø\n| colspan=\"3\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڤ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"3\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڥ]]}}</big>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|ŋ}}\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڠ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ࢳ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[Ng (Arabic)|ڭ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڱ]]}}</big>\n| rowspan=\"3\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ں]]}}</big>\n| rowspan=\"3\" |<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ن]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"4\" |Ø\n| colspan=\"6\" |Ø\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|ɳ}}\n|Ø\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڹ]]}}</big>\n|Ø\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڻ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"3\" |Ø\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڼ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"6\" |Ø\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|{{IPAslink|ɲ}}\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ڽ]]}}</big>\n|<big>{{script/Arabic|[[ݧ]]}}</big>\n| colspan=\"2\" |Ø\n| colspan=\"4\" |Ø\n| colspan=\"6\" |Ø\n|}\n\nWhen the Arabic alphabet spread to countries which used other languages, extra letters had to be invented to spell non-Arabic sounds.

They imagine that these connections can form the basis for knowing the future happenings they want to know.\"<ref name=\"ibnkhaldun\">Ibn Khaldūn. 1958 The Muqaddimah: An introduction to history. Translated from the Arabic by Franz Rosenthal. 3 vols. New York: Princeton. [http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_28.htm Chapter 6 section 28]</ref> He suggests that rather than being supernatural it works \"from an agreement in the wording of question and answer ... with the help of the technique called the technique of 'breaking down'\" (i.e. algebra). By combining number values associated with the letters and categories, new paths of insight and thought were created.\n\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun the most detailed treatment of it is a pseudographical work \"Za'irajah of the World\" attributed to [[Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti|as-Sabti]], which contains operating instructions in hundreds of lines of verse, beginning:<ref name=\"ibnkhaldun\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nSelect a star rise. Figure out its signs. <br/>\nReverse its root. Straighten it out with the cycle. <br/>\nSomeone will perceive those things. He will achieve his purpose <br/>\nAnd be given their letters in whose arrangement the evidence lies...\n</blockquote>\n\nA manuscript in [[Rabat]] recounts Ibn Khaldun's introduction to the machine by Al-Marjānī in 1370 (772 AH), and claims that it was a traditional and ancient science.<ref name=\"link\"/> When Ibn Khaldun expressed skepticism, the pair asked the instrument how old it was, and the machine told them it was invented by the prophet [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] (identified with the Biblical [[Enoch (Biblical figure)|Enoch]]).\n\nIt has been suggested that [[Catalonia|Catalan]]-[[Majorca]]n mystic [[Ramon Llull]] became familiar with the zairja in his travels and studies of Arab culture, and used it as a prototype for his invention of the ''[[Ars Magna (Ramon Llull)|Ars Magna]]''.<ref name=\"link\"/><ref>Charles Lohr (1984) Christianus arabicus, cuius nomen Raimundus Lullus.

It descends from a braille alphabet brought to Egypt by an English missionary prior to 1878, so the letter assignments generally correspond to [[English Braille]] and to the same [[romanization of Arabic|romanization]] as in other braille systems, like [[Greek braille|Greek]] and [[Russian braille|Russian]]. However, there were once multiple standards, some of which (such as [[Algerian Braille]]) were unrelated to Egyptian Braille. A unified Arabic Braille was adopted in the 1950s as part of the move toward [[international braille]], and it is the standard throughout the Arab world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070605022316/http://www.sagma.ma/oapam-casa/arbraille.html]</ref> Other [[Arabic-based alphabets]] have braille systems similar to Arabic Braille, such as [[Urdu Braille|Urdu]] and [[Persian Braille|Persian]] Braille, but differ in some letter and diacritic assignments.<ref name=Unesco>{{cite web|title=World Braille Usage|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000872/087242eb.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref>\n\nArabic Braille is read from left to right, following the international convention. Numbers are also left to right, as in printed Arabic.\n\n== Arabic braille chart ==\nArabic braille includes numerous abbreviations, some marked by dot 4 or dot 5 (the comma), which are not described here.  A conference in Saudi Arabia in 2002 set up a unified braille standard for Arabic, but as of 2013 not all countries had signed up; those not adopting the standard include some Arab countries but also non-Arab Muslim countries such as Iran, Malaysia, and Indonesia. \n\n===Letters===\nAlthough short-vowel letters are not diacritics in Arabic Braille, they are optional and generally omitted, just as in print Arabic.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Another such letter, {{bc|x}} for {{lang|ur|خ}} ''x'', is shared with [[Gurmukhi Braille]] ਖ਼ ''x'' but with no other Bharati alphabet, where {{bc|x}} is otherwise the vowel ''o''.\n\n==Alphabets==\n:''Note:  It is not clear if these are written right-to-left or left-to-right.

The High Board is the media organization of [[Muqtada Al-Sadr]], a [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] [[Iraq]]i religious and political leader.  The site, which commenced operation in 2007, performs several functions in support of [[Sadrist Movement|Sadrist]] objectives.    The site's distinct format includes a section in which [[Muqtada Al-Sadr|Al-Sadr]] offers religious opinions in response to queries from site followers.  Al-Sadr Online publishes news about [[Sadrist Movement|Sadrist]] political, social, and religious activities in southern [[Iraq]] and the [[Arab]] world.

During this period, Sadrist Movement leaders shifted the priorities of the organization, transitioning former [[Mahdi Army|Jaysh Al-Mahdi]] fighters into roles supporting the Mumahidun, the social and cultural wing of the party.

It started on 9 July 2003. As of {{Currentmonth}} {{Currentyear}}, it has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|ar|N}} articles, {{NUMBEROF|USERS|ar|N}} registered users and {{NUMBEROF|FILES|ar|N}} files and it is the [[List of Wikipedias|17th largest]] edition of Wikipedia by article count, and ranks [[m:Wikipedia article depth|12th in terms of depth]] among Wikipedias that are above 50,000 articles. It was the first [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] to exceed 100,000 articles.<ref>[[metawiki:List of Wikipedias#100_000+_articles|List of Wikipedias by number of articles]]</ref>\n\nThe design of the Arabic Wikipedia differs somewhat from other Wikipedias. Most notably, since Arabic is written [[Bi-directional text|right-to-left]], the location of links is a [[mirror image]] of those Wikipedias in languages written left-to-right. Prior to Wikipedia's update to [[MediaWiki]] [[mw:Release notes/1.16|1.16]], Arabic Wikipedia had a default page background of the site inspired by [[Islamic architecture|Arabic/Islamic tiling or ornament styles]]. Switching from MediaWiki's new default Vector layout to the original MonoBook layout may restore this page background. \n[[File:Edit-this-page-large-ar.png|thumb|\"Edit\" button on Arabic Wikipedia screenshot, old background in 2008]]\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Arab Wikipedians meeting.jpg|Arab Wikipedians meeting during Wikimania conference in Hong Kong|thumb]]\n\nAt the emergence of the Wikipedia project in 2001, there were calls to create an Arabic domain raised by Arab engineers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arsco.org/detailed/2fbe2ad4-57f3-42b7-8e72-005b95494f91|title=المستشار / طارق قابيل|publisher=|access-date=4 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205091127/http://arsco.org/detailed/2fbe2ad4-57f3-42b7-8e72-005b95494f91|archive-date=5 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The domain was created as \"ar.wikipedia.org\" but no serious activity took place except with anonymous users who experimented with the idea.<ref>[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_to_do_with_www.wikipedia.org Archived discussions about International languages.

The Arabic Wikipedia faced many challenges at its inception. In February 2004, it was considered to be the worst Wikipedia project among all other languages. However, in 2005, it showed phenomenal progress  by which in December 2005, the total number of articles reached 8,285.<ref>[[:ar:ويكيبيديا:إحصاءات ويكيبيديا العربية|Wikipedia Statistics - Arabic Wikipedia.

To protect the Wikipedian, the administrators forged a dispute that was the presumed reason for Tarawneh losing his administrator access, so the secret police was unable to obtain the IP.

Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed [[TASS (software)|TASS]], an ancestor of [[Tin (newsreader)|tin]], the popular threaded [[Usenet]] newsreader for [[Unix]] systems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.\n\nThe Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After Richard Stallman and the [[Free Software Foundation]] objected to the use of ''Gnu'' in the name, ''Gnuhoo'' was changed to ''NewHoo''.<ref name=\"SlashdotGnuhoo\">{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=98/06/23/0849239| accessdate = April 27, 2007|work=[[Slashdot]] | title=The GnuHoo BooBoo}}</ref> [[Yahoo!]] then objected to the use of ''Hoo'' in the name, prompting a proposed name change to ''ZURL''.<ref>[http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html \"Zurl Directory\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223080027/http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html |date=December 23, 2007 }}</ref> Prior to switching to ''ZURL'', NewHoo was acquired by [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] in October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the [[Open Directory License]]. Netscape was acquired by [[AOL]] shortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.\n\n[[File:Odp sitecount top.png|thumb|400px|DMOZ size by date, 1998 to 2015.]]\nBy the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the [[Yahoo! Directory]].<ref>[http://www.geniac.net/odp/ ODP and Yahoo Size Charts] by ODP editor geniac</ref> DMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.\n\nIn January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006.<ref name=\"odpreports\">[http://freenet-homepage.de/miscellanea/odp_reports/ ODP reports] by ODP volunteer administrator chris2001</ref> These reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included \"Test\" and \"Bookmarks\" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users. There were about 7330 active editors during August 2006.<ref name=\"odpreports\"/> 75,151 editors had contributed to the directory as of March 31, 2007.<ref name=frontpage>[http://www.dmoz.org/ ODP Front Page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501142910/http://www.dmoz.org/ |date=May 1, 2017 }}.

During that period, an older build of the directory was visible to the public.

Retrieved December 26, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe site's interface was given an upgrade in 2016, branded \"DMOZ 3.0\", but AOL took it offline the following year.\n\n===Competing and spinoff projects===\nAs DMOZ became more widely known, two other major [[Web directory|web directories]] edited by volunteers and sponsored by [[Go.com]] and [[Zeal (web)|Zeal]] emerged, both now defunct. These directories did not license their content for [[open content]] distribution.<ref>[http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml \"Terms of Use\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202210117/http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml|date=February 2, 2002}}</ref><ref>[http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html \"GO Network Terms of Service and Conditions of Use\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510161046/http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html |date=May 10, 2000 }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as [[ChefMoz]]<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html ''ChefMoz Fine Dining Menu''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513120425/http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}, in: Open Directory newsletter issue Autumn 2003</ref> and an encyclopedia known as [[Open Site]].<ref>[http://open-site.org/help/ help] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629225234/http://open-site.org/help |date=June 29, 2008 }} on open-site.org</ref> Finally, according to [[Larry Sanger]], DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the [[Nupedia]] project, out of which [[Wikipedia]] grew.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/13/media.newmedia|title=This time, it'll be a Wikipedia written by experts|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Moody|first=Glyn |date=July 13, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Logo history===\n<gallery>\nGnuHoo logo.png|Original logo as from June 1998\nNewHoo logo.png|Logo after rebranding as ''NewHoo''\nOpen Directory Project logo.png|Logo after acquisition by Netscape\nDMOZ Open Directory Project logo.png|Logo from 1999 to 2014 with the name ''DMOZ''\nDMOZ logo.png|Logo from March 2014\nDMOZ logo.svg|Logo from June 2016 until the closing in March 2017\n</gallery>\n\n==Content==\nGnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from [[Usenet]]. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2065949/the-search-engine-report-july-1998-number#newhoo|title=NewHoo: Yahoo Built By The Masses|work=[[Search Engine Watch]]|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=July 1, 1998|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for ''Adult'', ''Arts'', ''Business'', ''Computers'', ''Games'', ''Health'', ''Home'', ''News'', ''Recreation'', ''Reference'', ''Regional'', ''Science'', ''Shopping'', ''Society'', ''Sports'' and \"World\". While these sixteen ''top-level'' categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.\n\nIn July 1998, the directory became [[multilingualism|multilingual]] with the addition of the ''World'' top-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the ''World'' level grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.\n\nSeveral of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The ''Adult'' category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: ''Regional'' and ''Topical''.\n\nOn November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html Kids and Teens Launches!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221200521/http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html |date=February 21, 2008 }} Open Directory Project Newsletter, November/December 2000</ref> Key factors distinguishing this \"Kids and Teens\" area from the main directory are:\n* stricter guidelines which limit the listing of sites to those which are targeted or \"appropriate\" for people under 18 years of age;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |title=Kids&Teens Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716060749/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |archive-date=July 16, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* category names as well as site descriptions use vocabulary which is \"[[age appropriate]]\";\n* ''age tags'' on each listing distinguish content appropriate for kids (age 12 and under), teens (13 to 15 years old) and mature teens (16 to 18 years old);\n* Kids and Teens content is available as a separate RDF dump;\n* editing permissions are such that the community is parallel to that of DMOZ.\n\nBy May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.\n\nSince early 2004, the whole site has been in [[UTF-8]] encoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be [[ISO 8859-1]] for English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.\n\n===Maintenance===\nDirectory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.\n\nRobozilla is a [[Web crawler]] written to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the [[link rot]] in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.\n\nDue to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on [[Web search engine|search engine]] rankings (See [[PageRank]]), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted [[domain hijacking]], an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.\n\nWhile corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, [[bookmarklet]]s to help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons,<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/176740 \"ODPExtension\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }} Mozilla based add-on, ODP Magic. formerly known as ODP Extension</ref> and tools to help work through unreviewed queues.\n\n===License and requirements===\nDMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the [[Open Directory License]], which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.\n\nThe Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the [[Free Software Foundation]] to refer to the [[Open Directory License]] as a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.\n\nIn 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution license{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, which is a free license (and GPL compatible).<ref>GNU Project: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ccby on the Creative Commons Attribution license]</ref>\n\n===RDF dumps===\nDMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |title=Open Directory RDF Dump |publisher=Rdf.dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626235229/http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |archivedate=June 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> New versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.steevithak.com/sw/odp/rdflist.html|title=ODP/dmoz Data Dump ToDo List|work=steevithak.com|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid [[XML]], it is not valid [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.\n\n===Content users===\nDMOZ data powers the core [[directory service]]s for many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]. [[Google Directory]] used DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Google Streamlining: Say Goodbye to the Google Directory and Labs!|url=http://www.pandia.com/sew/3963-google-streamlining-say-goodbye-to-the-google-directory-and-labs.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Pandia Search Engine News|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Overture]] announced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, \"in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigablast.com/prdir.html|title=Gigablast Launches 500,000 Vertical Search Engines|work=[[Gigablast]]|date=May 12, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2006|9|8}}, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ Category: Sites Using ODP Data] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316003426/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ |date=March 16, 2009 }} on www.dmoz.org.

The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDMOZ's editing model is a [[Hierarchal structure|hierarchical]] one. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.<ref name=\"commguide\" />\n\nOver time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are ''editall'' privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. ''Meta'' privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. ''Cateditall'' privileges are similar to ''editall'', but only for a single directory category. Similarly, ''catmod'' privileges are similar to ''meta'', but only for a single directory category. ''Catmv'' privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with ''meta'' editors.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn August 2004, a new level of privileges called ''admin'' was introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.<ref name=\"adminguide\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |title=Open Directory Project Administrator Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722205313/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |archive-date=July 22, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAll DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |title=ODP Directory Editorial Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701150829/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |archive-date=July 1, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely.

According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour.

Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated.

In June 2003, they switched to the open source [[phpBB]] system. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.\n\n===Bug tracking===\nThe bug tracking software used by the ODP is [[Bugzilla]] and the web server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]. [[Squid cache|Squid]] web proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.\n\n===Interface===\nThe DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the [[GNU General Public License]]). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license.

Chatting, Greeting Cards, and simple content channels were upon the first to be developed internally. Since then, Maktoob diversified its services through both acquisitions and internal development to have close to 40 different channels and services.\n\nThe success of the Maktoob portal drove the company to start new online businesses. [[cashU Inc|cashU]] was founded to address the issue of electronic payments in the region, [[Souq.com]] as an auctions and marketplace; Tahadi.com was founded to provide the best MMO/MMORPG games for the Middle East internet users, [[Araby.com]] an Arabic Search engine; Maktoob Research a successful online research service founded by Tamara Deprez; and Sukar.com the first and biggest online private shopping club in the [[Middle East]], founded by [[Saygin Yalcin]].\n\n===Abraaj Capital acquisition===\nIn June 2005, the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]-based private equity house [[Abraaj Capital]] purchased 40% of the company shares in a USD 5.2 million buyout deal. The rationale for such an acquisition (according to Abraaj's website) is that Maktoob has a large user base (claimed to be more than 4 million) and, according to marketing literature, \"a dominant online payment option [[cashU Inc|cashU]] and a strong brand name. It has established the first Arab online auction site souq.com which will benefit from leveraging the large community network.\"\n\nIn April 2006, Maktoob acquired 80% of popular Arab sports website [[Sport4ever]].com.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.albawaba.com/news/maktoobcom-picks-majority-stake-popular-arab-sports-website |title = Maktoob.com picks up majority stakes in popular arab sports website|date = 24 April 2006|work = |access-date = 17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2007, Abraaj sold its share to Tiger Global Management with an [[internal rate of return]] of 75%.<ref>[http://www.albawaba.com/en/countries/UAE/220448 Albawaba.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103115355/http://www.albawaba.com/en/countries/UAE/220448 |date=2008-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n===Yahoo!===\nIn 2009, Maktoob was sold to Yahoo! for $164 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Media in the Arab World:  Leading up to the Uprisings of 2011 |url=http://www.hirondelle.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SocialMediaintheArabWorldCIMA2011.pdf |work=The Center for International Media Assistance |accessdate=25 September 2013 |author=Jeffrey Ghannam |date=3 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928203824/http://www.hirondelle.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SocialMediaintheArabWorldCIMA2011.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}</ref> In January 2011, email users were migrated from the @maktoob.com domain to the @yahoo.com domain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/technology/thousands-hit-by-yahoo-maktoob-change-to-e-mail |title=Thousands hit by Yahoo Maktoob change to e-mail |website=Thenational.ae |date=14 January 2011 |author=Ben Flanagan |access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, Yahoo! let go half of its staff in Dubai, and it announced in December 2015 the closure of its office in Dubai, its last office in the MENA region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/yahoo-close-last-middle-east-office-in-dubai-615619.html |title=Yahoo to close last Middle East office in Dubai |website=Arabianbusiness.com |date=16 December 2015 |author=Neil Halligan |access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Yahoo! acquisition of Maktoob remains one of the biggest acquisitions in the region, and a success story for other entrepreneurs.

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}\n'''''Syria-News''''' is an online [[press agency]] intended to report news about [[Syria]]. Their website features several categories of news (domestic, regional, political, and economical) as well as reports and questionnaires that concern Syrian issues. It enables users to comment on most of the news, as well to send contributions; in both cases, they can be published only upon approval.\n\n''Syria-News'' was launched in late 2003, and at that time publishing an online press agency was not straightforward in Syria where most websites featuring political news about Syria were blocked. This gave it a semi-official status, since it was approved by the [[Syrian government]], and the participation of some ministers confirmed this status.\n\nThe website has become quite popular in Syria, as an approved portal to discuss domestic issues.\n\nIn 2006, the official domain name of their website was hijacked, but soon later retaken.\n\nOn February 18, 2008, all Syrian ISPs blocked domestic access to the site and its alternate URL www.news-sy.com. Access was restored by March 6, 2008, though there has been no official statement from the site or Syrian authorities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Media of Syria]]\n*[[Syrian Arab News Agency]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.syria-news.com Official website]\n\n[[Category:Syrian news websites]]\n[[Category:Arabic-language websites]]\n\n\n{{Syria-stub}}\n{{news-website-stub}}"

      "text": "'''Taghreedat''' ({{lang-ar|مبادرة تغريدات}}) is the largest Arabic crowdsourcing initiative in the MENA region. With a community of over 9,000 Arab translators, editors and writers residing in 35 countries around the world, of which are 20 Arab countries,<ref>Taghreedat website</ref> Taghreedat aims to build an active Arabic digital content creation community that contributes directly and significantly to increasing the quality and quantity of [[Arabic]] content on the web, through [[crowdsourcing]] to increase Arab users' contribution to enriching Arabic content on the web through [[original content]] projects, and projects geared towards [[Language localisation|localization]] and [[Arabization]].\n\nStarting on May 31, 2011, on Twitter, as a call to action to increase the quality and quantity of Arabic digital content on [[Twitter]] via the hashtag #letstweetinarabic, Taghreedat has created a community of Arabic digital content enthusiasts from all parts of the Arab world, through its verified account on Twitter: @Taghreedat, which has over 142,000 followers.<ref>Taghreedat on Twitter</ref>\n\nTaghreedat has collaborated with a number of international and regional stakeholders, among which are [[San Francisco]]-based organizations and companies including: [[Twitter]], the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], [[Storify]], [[Easy Chirp]], [[Meedan]], [[Khan Academy]], [[Google]], [[WhatsApp]], [[Easy Chirp]], [[Coursera]] and [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]] in addition to [[New York City|New York]]-based [[TED (conference)|TED]], [[Smartling]] and [[Foursquare]] in addition to [[Europe]]-based [[GameLoft]] and [[Abu Dhabi]] based [[twofour54]] – the supporting organization which currently funds this initiative.\n\n== Recognition and impact ==\n* On October 4, 2012, The [[Dubai School of Government]] released its latest report, including a case study on Taghreedat as a model for social entrepreneurship in the Arab region, citing Taghreedat's impact on applying [[crowdsourcing]] to increase the quality and quantity of Arabic [[digital content]]. The report was released by The Governance and Innovation Program (GIP) at the [[Dubai School of Government]], in partnership with [[SAP AG|SAP]] MENA, and included a regional eight country survey to measure perceptions on the impact of social media usage on economic empowerment, employment and entrepreneurship in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n* On August 29, 2012, Taghreedat was selected as one of the Middle East's Top 25 Tech Initiatives leading the technology innovation scene in the Middle East region, in a list that has been created by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s Neil Parmar and published in Washington, D.C.-based [[Al Monitor]]. Taghreedat was ranked 12th in the list, making it the only nonprofit initiative to have been included in the list, which also highlighted included various startups as part of its rankings.<ref>Top 25 Tech Stars in the Middle East Region - Al Monitor Original, By Neil Parmar</ref>\n* Previously, on March 9, 2012, during the Presidential Official Statements at the [[ITU]]'s Connect Arab States Summit held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], the Egyptian Presidential Statement, delivered by [[Egypt]]'s Minister of Telecommunications singled out Taghreedat has one of the region's strongest efforts to enrich Arabic digital content.\n* In a recent [[Klout]] study, dated April 2012, Taghreedat's Twitter account rounded in the top 5 most influential non-personal Arab [[Twitter]] accounts, in terms of reach, volume of interactions, retweets, mentions and overall user network.\n* Taghreedat's projects have been covered in a number of international and regional media outlets, including: [[CNN]], The Next Web, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[BBC World]], [[France 24]], [[CNBC Arabiya|CNBC ArabiYa]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Al Arabiya]], [[Sky News Arabia]], [[Chicago Tribune]], [[Khaleej Times]], [[Screen Daily]], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], [[Arabian Business]], ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', [[Youm7|Al Youm Al Sabe']] and others.\n* Taghreedat has also participated in a number of international and regional events to showcase its community-driven projects including [[Wikimania 2012]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],<ref>Al Arabiya News: Taghreedat To Offer Arab Tweeps Their Own Search Engine</ref> and [[TEDGlobal]] in Idinbrugh, [[United Kingdom]]. The initiative also participated in the [[Abu Dhabi]] Media Summit, where it held and spoke at a panel discussion on crowdsourcing with three of its key international stakeholders: [[Twitter]], [[Storify]] and [[Meedan]]. Taghreedat also participated at the [[ITU Telecom World]] 2012, which was held in [[Dubai]], UAE. The initiative spoke at a panel discussion on [[Big Data]] and how [[crowdsourcing]] fits into the ever-increasing debate on data ownership.\n\n== Partnerships and collaborations ==\nTaghreedat has collaborated with the following international digital content companies and organizations:\n* [[Google]], globally\n* [[Twitter|Twitter, Inc.]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]\n* [[TED (conference)|TED]] in [[New York City]]\n* [[The Wikimedia Foundation]] in San Francisco\n* [[Storify]] in San Francisco\n* [[Meedan]] in San Francisco\n* [[Khan Academy]] in [[California]]\n* [[WhatsApp]] in [[California]]\n* [[GameLoft]] in [[Europe]]\n* [[Easy Chirp]] in [[California]]\n* [[Coursera]] in [[California]]\n* [[Smartling]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]\n* [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]\n* [[Foursquare]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]\n\n== Taghreedat's projects ==\n\n=== Twitter Arabization Project ===\nThe first of Taghreedat's projects which commenced on October 22, 2011, Taghreedat gathered a group of volunteers to Arabize over 190 [[Twitter]] glossary terms from English to Arabic to be then applied on Twitter's Arabic interface. Taghreedat collaborated with Twitter to develop such glossary, through a campaign that the initiative launched under the hashtag #letstweetinarabic to create momentum and awareness and was considered by Twitter as a grassroots step in the eventual launch of Twitter's Arabic interface, which Taghreedat and thousands of Arab volunteers at Twitter's Translation Center have contributed to make it a reality.\n\n=== Arabic Wikipedia Editors Program ===\nIn cooperation of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], Taghreedat has launched the Arabic Wikipedia Editors Program – a regional program which targets regular Internet users to train them (both online & offline) become Arabic Wikipedia editors. The program is composed of two main components: online training as well as offline workshops (training component) in addition to a reward component in the form of official certificates that the volunteer participants will be receiving. The project was launched in mid June 2012 and continues to attract new Arabic Wikipedia editors.<ref>Video from the Wikimedia Foundation on the Taghreedat/Wikipedia Partnership</ref>\n\n=== Storify Arabization Project ===\nIn mid May 2012, Taghreedat announced that it has started working with San Francisco-based [[Storify]], the online curation social platform, to Arabize its website interface. Crowd-sourced community work on the project continued for 3 weeks until June 7, 2012. Starting July, Taghreedat has started working with Storify on the back-end to ensure the Arabic Storify interface is implemented while taking Arabic text placement in consideration. When launched, Arabic will become among the first 3 languages to be applied to the online curation website interface.<ref>The Next Web – Storify Working with Middle Eastern Initiative Taghreedat To Translate Storify Into Arabic</ref>\n\n=== First Arabic Tech/Web 2.0 Dictionary ===\nTaghreedat is developing the first crowd-sourced Arabic technology dictionary for technology and social media terms, translated from English to Arabic. The dictionary comprises over 6,500 technology terms in various fields, including: cyber safety, cyber security, graphic design, PC terminology and more. Started in mid June 2012, work is currently ongoing to gather the Taghreedat community votes on all 6500 terms. The dictionary, expected to be launched later this year, has attracted the attention of a number of US and UK media outlets, tipping it as the first crowd-sourced collection of Arabic technology terms in the MENA region.\n\n=== TED Website Localization Project ===\nOn September 4, 2012, Taghreedat announced that it has begun working with the [[TED (conference)|TED]] headquarters in New York to localize its official website into Arabic for the first time. The project will be carried our by Taghreedat's volunteer base, applying the same crowdsourcing model that Taghreedat has applied in its previous localization projects with [[Twitter]] and [[Storify]].\n\n=== Memorandum of Understanding with Meedan ===\nAt its panel discussion session with a number of its international stakeholders including [[Twitter]], [[Storify]] and [[Meedan]], Taghreedat announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with [[Meedan]], the [[California]] based social translation and software NGO. This collaboration focuses on translating [[Open Education Resources]] (OER), and hence increasing the availability of educational resources in Arabic language for users worldwide, particularly students.\nThe partnership will promote Taghreedat and Meedan's common goal of providing access to high quality Arabic digital educational content, Open Educational Resources, through online social translation software in the Middle East.\nThis new agreement will allow Meedan, which has been working on building an online translation community since 2008, to focus its resources on program and software design and delivery. Taghreedat will work towards translating all online educational content and dialogue initiatives into Arabic through its active social media community of over 2500 volunteers.\n\n=== Khan Academy Video Subtitling Project ===\nOn November 6, 2012, [[Khan Academy]] launched an effort with Taghreedat to localize its educational video library into Arabic, offering an opportunity for all Arabic speaking learners worldwide to access a vast amount of quality open educational resources in their native language for free. The project came as the first tangible outcome of Taghreedat's MoU with California-based [[Meedan]], which was signed in October at the [[Abu Dhabi Media Summit]]. The partnership directly falls into Arabizing [[Open Educational Resources]] and marks the beginning of a larger call to action to channel Arab users' enthusiasm to enrich Arabic content online into more areas than interface localization.\n\n=== Arabic Web Days Program ===\nOn November 23, 2012, Google announced the launch of \"Arabic Web Days\" to enrich digital Arabic content, through a series of activities and initiatives to be implemented by a group of prominent international bodies and regional shows in Middle East and North Africa over a month.\n\nGoogle has partnered with Vinelab, Taghreedat and Wamda to shape the program, which also saw involvement of Twitter, WikiPedia, TED, Soundcloud and YouTube. The program was supported by local expertise from the Media Zone Authority in Abu Dhabi, twofour54 and Qatar Research Institute for Computing (QCRI).\n\n=== Tajseed: the MENA Region's First Infographics Competition ===\nAs part of Arabic web days, Taghreedat has announced on November 26, 2012 that it has partnered with Tajseed, the MENA region's first Arabic infographics competition, to launch the competition in its second round with the goal of amplifying the competition's goal and discovering Arab talent in the infographics field.\nTajseed's first round had attracted over 40,000 visits to the website: tajseed.net and over 10,000 views to the competition video when it was first launched. By the end of the first round, over 300 Arabic infographics submissions were received and the winners were all announced in May 2012.\n\n=== WikiQuote Project ===\nIn cooperation with the Wikimedia Foundation, Taghreedat is contributing to Wikimedia's [[WikiQuote]] project, a Wikipedia sister project that collects various popular quotes and cultural sayings from around the world. Taghreedat will be contributing with around 2,000 Arabic quotes – originating from the Arab world or translated into Arabic to enrich the Repository. The project started in May 2012 and will continue throughout the year.\n\n=== WhatsApp Localization Project ===\nOn January 13, 2013, Taghreedat launched a collaboration with [[WhatsApp]] to improve the localization of its applicants on various mobile devices. The project attracted over 2,600 Arab volunteers who joined the WhatsApp Translation Center to suggest variations and add votes to the Arabic strings localized at the Translation Center. The project was followed by a collaboration between Taghreedat and [[WhatsApp]] to carry out the translation and localization of WhatsApp on Windows Phone 8.\n\n=== GameLoft Website Localization Project ===\nOn February 26, 2013, Taghreedat announced its latest localization partnership with Gameloft, one of the top global gaming companies and producer of global gaming brands including [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Ice Age]], [[Rayman]], [[Asphalt]] among others. The project was to localize over 250 strings of which the Gameloft website was comprised. The project marked the first time a global gaming company agrees to localize its website into Arabic to cater to Arabic speaking users particularly in the Middle East. Over 1,000 volunteers joined the project.\n\n=== Wikimedia Commons Project ===\nOn April 6, 2013, Taghreedat announced its latest partnership with the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to increase awareness, build interest and foster participation among Arabic social media users in [[Wikimedia Commons]]. Users were encouraged to register [[Wikipedia]] usernames and then upload their own work on Commons. More than 1800 volunteers signed up for the project.\n\n=== Easy Chirp Localization Project ===\nOn May 1, 2013, Taghreedat launched a collaboration with [[Easy Chirp]], the accessible Twitter application for the blind and visually impaired. The project entailed localizing all 400 strings of the application to be then delivered to Easy Chirp prior to the launch of the application in Arabic language for the first time. In 10 days, over 1800 Arab volunteers signed up to participate in the project. All strings were completed within 24 hours after the project launch.\n\n=== Coursera and Taghreedat: Arabic OER Partnership ===\nOn May 19, 2013, Taghreedat announced a partnership with Coursera, the world’s leading Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) provider to translate major international university courses across multiple disciplines for all Arab students around the world, for free. \nTop global universities including Stanford, Yale, Columbia, Georgia, Duke, Northwestern, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Edinburgh and many others are offering a number of their courses for free on Coursera in English language. With this partnership, some of the world’s top university courses will finally be accessible for free for all Arabic speaking users. \nTaghreedat’s 9,000 translators, writers and editors in 37 countries worldwide started to be involved in translating two university courses marking the official kick off of the collaboration with Coursera. Stanford University’s Math Think Course and Duke University’s Behavioral Economics will be the first two courses to be localized – with plans for more courses to follow. A group of Taghreedat translation language moderators will be managing the project quality throughout the following weeks to ensure the courses are localized accurately and are accent-free.\n\n=== Amara.org Partnership ===\nOn August 30, 2013, Taghreedat announced a partnership with leading subtitling and captioning provider, Amara.org. Working with thousands of Arabic translators in the Taghreedat community, Amara and Taghreedat will be providing quality crowd-sourced Arabic subtitles to a wide range of organizations, businesses and projects worldwide. Amara will be involving top Taghreedat subtitlers and reviewers in major subtitling projects with some of the leading video producing organizations around the globe. Taghreedat will also carry out major Arabic subtitling projects on the platform, furthering its mission and commitment to increase Arabic digital content on the web.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.taghreedat.com Taghreedat Website]\n* [https://twitter.com/taghreedat Taghreedat on Twitter]\n* [http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/19/227328.html Al Arabiya News: Taghreedat To Offer Arab Tweeps Their Own Search Engine]\n* [http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/contents/articles/galleries/leaders-behind-the-middle-easts-rising-tech-scene.html Top 25 Tech Stars in the Middle East Region - Al Monitor Original, By Neil Parmar]\n* [https://www.dropbox.com/lightbox/home/Public Video from the Wikimedia Foundation on the Taghreedat/Wikipedia Partnership]\n* [https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/04/30/volunteers-compile-arabic-e-dictionary/?mod=google_news_blog Wall Street Journal – Volunteers Compile Arabic e-Dictionary]\n* [https://thenextweb.com/me/2012/05/30/taghreedat-launches-arabic-wikipedia-editors-program-in-cooperation-with-the-wikimedia-foundation/ The Next Web – Taghreedat Launches Arabic Wikipedia Editors Program]\n* [https://thenextweb.com/me/2012/04/29/2500-volunteers-across-the-middle-east-are-compiling-a-web-2-0-dictionary-in-arabic/ The Next Web: Middle East Volunteers Compile Web 2.0 Dictionary]\n* [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/06/16/who-will-lead-the-arabic-language-initiative/ Wikimedia Foundation Blog: Who Will Lead Arabic Language Initiative?]\n* [http://media.twofour54.com/en/news/news/twofour54-supports-taghreedat-to-increase-quality-and-quantity-of-arabic-e-content.html twofour54 supports Taghreedat to Increase Arabic Digital Content]\n* [http://blog.twitter.com/2012/03/twitter-now-available-in-arabic-farsi.html Twitter Blog: Twitter Now Available in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18134903 BBC International – Push for Arabic Content [Video<nowiki>]</nowiki>]\n* [https://thenextweb.com/me/2012/05/16/storify-working-with-middle-eastern-initiative-taghreedat-to-translate-the-site-into-arabic/ The Next Web – Storify Working with Middle Eastern Initiative Taghreedat To Translate Storify Into Arabic]\n* [https://thenextweb.com/me/2012/06/13/volunteer-translators-flock-to-crowdsource-the-first-arabic-tech-and-social-media-dictionary/ The Next Web: Volunteer Translators Flock to Crowdsource The First Arabic Tech and Social Media Dictionary]\n* [http://varietyarabia.com/Docs.Viewer/74ccf908-74bc-4847-8e07-c484674340a1/default.aspx Variety Arabia: Taghreedat partners with Wikimedia Foundation]\n* [http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/coming-to-the-web-twitter-in-arabic The National: Coming to the web: Twitter in Arabic]\n* [http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/archiving-website-storify-to-get-arabic-translation-thanks-to-gulf-volunteers The National: Archiving website Storify to get Arabic translation thanks to Gulf volunteers]\n* [https://thenextweb.com/me/2012/05/30/taghreedat-launches-arabic-wikipedia-editors-program-in-cooperation-with-the-wikimedia-foundation/ Dubai School of Government 2012 Report: Taghreedat Case Study (p. 39)]\n* [http://international.khanacademy.org/post/35047486362/khan-academy-has-launched-an-effort-with Khan Academy's Blog Post Announcement of its Taghreedat Collaboration]\n\n[[Category:Arabic-language websites]]"

In 2006, [[Internet Brands]] bought the trademark and servers and later introduced [[Web advertising|advertising]] to the website.<ref name=\"tedeschi1\" /> This move met opposition from users, with many German and Italian editors leaving in December 2006 for a newly established wiki, [[Wikivoyage]].\n\nWikitravel received a [[Webby Award]] for Best Travel Website in 2007.<ref name=\"coyle\" /> The same year, Wikitravel's founders began '''Wikitravel Press''', a now-defunct project that published printed travel guides based on the website's content.<ref name=\"doctorow\" /> The first print guides were released on February 1, 2008.\n\nIn 2012, a large portion of the editing community, including the founders, left and brought their contributions to the [[Wikivoyage]] travel guide, which was relaunched as a [[Wikimedia Foundation]]–hosted project in January 2013.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Paris 1st map.png|thumb|right|alt=|Annotated map of the [[1st arrondissement of Paris]] generated for a guide to travel of Wikitravel from [[OpenStreetMap]] data]]\n\nWikitravel was started in July 2003 by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins, partly inspired by [[Wikipedia]]. To allow individuals, tourism agencies, and others to make free reprints of individual pages more easily than permitted by the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (used by Wikipedia at that time) it used the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution ShareAlike license. Since Wikipedia and Wikitravel are [[Wikipedia#License and language editions|licensed]] under the Attribution ShareAlike license, appropriate content can be shared between the two so long as licensing requirements are met.\n\nWikitravel does not have a neutral-point-of-view requirement, as it is written from the point of view of a traveler and, instead, encourages editors to \"be fair\".<ref name=fair/>\n\nWikitravel encourages original research in its content, and therefore does not generally require citation,<ref name=\"tips\" /> but it does require contributions to comply with its Manual of Style, to provide an easily recognised and consistent layout and appearance,<ref name=\"mos\" /> and to avoid touting.<ref name=\"tout\" />\n\nOn April 20, 2006, Wikitravel announced that it and {{ill|World66|de}}—another open-content wiki travel guide founded in 1999—had been acquired by [[Internet Brands]], a publicly traded corporation.<ref name=\"dealbook\" /> The new owner hired Prodromou and Jenkins to continue managing Wikitravel as a consensus-based project. They explained that Internet Brands' long-term plan was for Wikitravel to continue to focus on collaborative, objective guides, while World66 would focus more on personal experiences and reviews. In response, many authors of the German language community chose to [[Fork (software development)|fork]] the German Wikitravel, which was released on December 10, 2006, as [[Wikivoyage]]. The German language Wikitravel remains active. On April 1, 2008, Internet Brands added [[AdWords|Google advertising]] to Wikitravel, with an opt-out procedure for registered users.\n\nOn May 1, 2007, Wikitravel received the [[Webby Award]] for Best Travel Website. On June 16, 2008, Wikitravel was named one of the \"50 Best Websites of 2008\" by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].<ref name=\"hamilton\"/>\n\nOn August 3, 2007, Prodromou, Jenkins, and long-time contributor Jani Patokallio started Wikitravel Press, a company that produces and sells print guidebooks based on material contributed to Wikitravel. The first Wikitravel Press guides, ''Chicago'' and ''Singapore'', were launched on February 1, 2008.<ref name=\"glow\" /> Content in these guidebooks was available under the same Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license under which Wikitravel material is licensed. The Wikitravel trademarks were licensed to Wikitravel Press, but there was otherwise no connection to Internet Brands. Wikitravel Press ceased to operate in 2011.<ref name=\"press\" />\n\nOn January 1, 2010, the content of Wikitravel was migrated to the updated [[Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 license]].\n\nIn mid-2012, a proposal was floated by members of the editing community to [[fork (software development)|fork]] their work at Wikitravel (forking in this context means to move editing activities and current content to a new host, in accordance with [[CC BY-SA|the site license]]) and re-merge with the travel website Wikivoyage—which had been a fork of German and Italian language Wikitravel some years before—and to then seek hosting of the merged sites by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]].<ref>[http://governancexborders.com/2012/07/13/challenges-of-merging-communities-the-case-of-wikitravel-and-wikivoyage/ The Case of Wikitravel and Wikivoyage] Governance Across Borders, July 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skift.com/2012/07/13/wikipedia-parent-launch-travel-guide-wikitravel-rebels/ |title=Wikipedia parent to launch travel guide with Wikitravel rebels |publisher=Skift.com |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Internet Brands opposed this move and sued one Wikitravel contributor and one Wikipedia contributor, alleging trademark infringement, [[unfair competition]] and civil conspiracy. This move was opposed by individuals and by the Wikimedia Foundation as being an example of a [[SLAPP]] lawsuit—one undertaken without plausible legal grounds with a primary intent being to deter, overwhelm, or frustrate persons engaged in fully lawful actions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wiki travel dustup tests open copyright licenses|author=|date=September 7, 2012|work=Thomson Reuters News and Insight|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=56379|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502060256/http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=56379|archivedate=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2014-12-29|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\n===Community fork in 2012===\n{{see also|Wikivoyage#History|Internet Brands#Wikitravel and Wikimedia}}\nIn 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction with Wikitravel's host and owner [[Internet Brands]], it was proposed that the community at Wikitravel [[fork (software development)|fork]] (split off) their work and editing activities from ''Wikitravel'' and ''Wikitravel Shared'' and—with the existing sites at [[Wikivoyage]]—merge to create a new travel wiki to be hosted by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], the owner of [[Wikipedia]] and a large range of other [[non-profit]] reference sites based upon [[wiki community|wiki communities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Travel_Guide |title=Wikivoyage&nbsp;– Meta |publisher=Meta.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref><ref>[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Travel_Guide&oldid=4064419], Travel Guide proposal on Wikimedia meta-wiki(Revision as of 20:12, 24 August 2012)</ref><ref>[http://www.wikivoyage.org/w/general/index.php?title=Migration_FAQ&oldid=12931]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Wikivoyage Migration FAQ (Revision as of 23:15, 26 August 2012)</ref> The dissatisfaction related to long-standing discontent at poor hosting, poor site updates, and excessive monetization and advertising, and eventually, interference by Internet Brands in the community's activities in breach of prior agreements and understandings.<ref name=\"wv faq\">[[meta:Wikivoyage/Migration/FAQ|Migration FAQ at Wikivoyage, 25 Oct 2012]]</ref>\n\nAfter lengthy discussion by users of the three communities and comments by their respective hosts, and confirmation by the Wikimedia Foundation that it would host a travel project if users wished, the majority of administrators and bureaucrats at Wikitravel decided to fork their existing work to [[Wikivoyage]].<ref>[http://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Wikitravel:Travellers%27_pub&oldid=1914778], Discussions (towards the bottom) on Wikitravel's Travellers' Pub regarding the migration to Wikimedia/Wikivoyage (Revision as of 01:16, 26 August 2012)</ref><ref>[http://www.wikivoyage.org/w/general/index.php?title=Interest_in_starting_a_new_language_version&oldid=14619#English Part of the discussion at Wikivoyage, of move to WMF 25 Oct 2012]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Travel_Guide&oldid=4289759 Analysis of the situation, findings, discussions, and resolutions by the Wikimedia Foundation and its user community]: comprehensive resources at Wikimedia.org, as at 25 October 2012</ref>\n\nThe contents of Wikitravel and its related 'Commons' (images, video and other media files) in all languages and of Wikitravel Commons were downloaded as a 'database dump' in preparation for such a migration on August 2, 2012 and as the starting point for the existing wiki.

Because of this, CASHU has become one of the most popular alternative [[Electronic money|payment option]] for young [[Arab]]ic online gamers, e-commerce shoppers, and VoIP users.\n\nCASHU was established in 2003 by [[Maktoob]] in [[Amman, Jordan]] but when [[Yahoo!]] acquired Maktoob in November 2009 the ownership of CASHU was transferred to Jabbar Internet Group.\n\nToday CASHU has established offices in Dubai, and Amman.\n\nCASHU is mainly used for paying for [[online game]]s, [[VoIP]], IT services, trading and download of music and software. They have a strict policy to not accept merchants providing [[gambling]] and sexual content. CASHU also provide a parental control feature allowing parents to limit and control where their kids spend money online.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* More about [https://www.cashu.com/about-us CASHU]\n* \n[[Category:Payment service providers]]\n[[Category:Maktoob]]"

It was soon changed, and continued to be used in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], as a new version with a red trapezoid replacing the triangle and two seven-point white stars on denoting the two principal peoples of the kingdom: the [[Arabs]] and the [[Kurds]]. Both designs also reflected the newly installed [[Hashemite]] Dynasty in Iraq (originally from [[Hejaz]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]), who had played a leading role in the [[Arab Revolt]].

This horizontal tricolour of red, white, and black bands (first used in the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]) formed the basis of the flag of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). Though the UAR broke up in 1961, hopes for Arab unity persisted. As such, whereas the UAR flag had two green stars in the white band, signifying its two members ([[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]), the new Iraqi flag had three stars, symbolising the aspiration that Iraq would join with Egypt and Syria in a new union. Sharing this goal, Syria adopted the new Iraqi flag as its own later that same year. This remained the [[flag of Syria]] until 1971, when the green stars were replaced by the [[Coat of arms of Syria|Hawk of Qureish]].\n\nThe Iraqi Flag Law No. 28 of 1963 was replaced by Flag Law No. 33 of 1986, during the presidency of [[Saddam Hussein]], in which although the flag remained the same, the meaning of the three stars was changed from their original geographic meaning to representations of the three tenets of the [[Ba'ath Party]] motto: ''{{transl|ar|wahda, hurriyah, ishtirakiyah}}'' (unity, freedom and socialism).{{-}}\n\n===1991–2004===\n[[File:Flag of Iraq (1991-2004).svg|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical}}{{IFIS|Equal}} April 1, 1991 – August 5, 2004 (ratio: 2:3)]]\n\nOn 13 January 1991, the flag was modified by Flag Law No. 6 of 1991.

Strong speculation followed that the U.S. government would press for a change in the Iraqi flag to remove its pan-Arab symbolism, and to make a definitive break with the period of Ba'athist rule. To a degree, this view was shared by some groups in Iraq. In addition to some displeasure among Iraqis who had suffered under Saddam Hussein to retaining national symbols used by his government, there was also strong aversion to the flag from Iraq's Kurdish minority, who resented its evocation of pan-Arabism. However, Iraqi opponents of changing the flag argued that since the flag had been used since 1963, long before Saddam Hussein's presidency, it was unfair to characterise it as a 'Saddamist' flag. They also stressed that pan-Arabism has been a dominant popular principle among Iraqi's majority population for decades prior to Iraqi independence in 1932.\n\nOn 26 April 2004 the U.S. appointed [[Iraqi Governing Council]] (IGC) announced a new flag for post-Saddam Iraq. The IGC stated that, from around 30 competing entries, it had chosen a design by the distinguished Iraqi artist-architect [[Rifat Chadirji]], who lives in London, and is a brother of a member of the IGC.\n\nThe proposed flag had several meanings:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Symbol\n! Meaning\n|-\n| White background\n| Purity\n|-\n| Two blue bands\n| The blue bands represent the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] rivers.\n|-\n| Yellow band\n| Kurdish minority. The [[flag of Kurdistan]] features a yellow sun.\n|-\n| Blue crescent\n| The [[Star and crescent|crescent]] represents [[Islam]].<br/>The shade of blue represents [[Iraqi Turkmens]].\n|}\n\nThe design marked a notable break with the three flags of modern Iraqi history (namely the Arab Revolt-inspired flag of the Kingdom, the flag introduced by Abdul Karim Qassim, and the Arab Liberation inspired flag of 1963), all of which were based on the four [[pan-Arab colours]]. Indeed, of these colours, only white was represented in the IGC design. Moreover, Islamic crescents are usually depicted in green or red in Arab heraldry. The proposed change provoked an intensely negative reaction across groups of Iraq's Arab majority, including those vehemently opposed to Saddam Hussein. Those opposed to the U.S. occupation, including [[Shi'a]] cleric [[Muqtada Al-Sadr]], decried the design as an attempt by the U.S. government to strip Iraq of its identity, and its historically prominent role in the [[Arab world]]. In particular, critics lamented the proposed abandonment of the Arab Liberation Flag, the omission of the traditional colors of [[pan-Arabism]], and the removal of the ''takbīr''.\n\nAdditionally, the new flag's predominantly blue-on-white appearance immediately antagonised many in Iraq because of its alleged resemblance to the [[flag of Israel|flag of the State of Israel]], considered [[Iraq–Israel relations|hostile to Iraq]] since the former's establishment in 1948.\n\nThe new flag was reported to have been [[Flag desecration#Iraq|burned by insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] on 27 April 2004, the day before its planned official adoption.\n\nOn 28 April 2004, IGC President [[Massoud Barzani]] formally presented a modified version of the flag in which the originally very light shade of blue as reported by the press on 26 April 2004 had been changed to a darker tone. It was unclear whether this was a change made because of the protests made against the original design or, as the Council claimed, a rectification of printing errors in the earlier news reports. Barzani also explained that the flag was a temporary design, to be used over the ensuing months until the adoption of a definitive flag.\n\nIn the face of the overwhelming public outcry, adoption of the blue crescent flag was abandoned entirely.{{-}}\n\n===2008 flag proposal===\n[[File:Proposed flag of Iraq (first proposal, 2008).svg|thumb|right|{{IFIS|Equal}} First proposal, 2008]]\nDespite the compromise in 2004, opposition to the flag persisted from Kurdish groups. In January 2008, a new design was proposed, removing the three green stars, instead placing a green eight pointed star around a yellow circle in the middle of the ''takbīr'', which is written in the Kufic script and prized as a Mesopotamian Arabic style, having originated in Iraq.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18049763 | title=Iraq to Restore Former Baath Party Followers | last=Garrels | first=Anne | accessdate=2008-01-24 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | date=2008-01-12 }}</ref>{{-}}\n\n===2008 flag contest===\n[[File:Proposed flag of Iraq (second proposal, 2008).svg|thumb|{{IFIS|Equal}} Second proposal, 2008]]\nIn July 2008, the Iraqi parliament launched a contest to design a new Iraqi flag. The contest ran until September 2008, with 50 designs submitted. Six designs were chosen and sent to the parliament which was going to choose a new flag before the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pukmedia.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=8111&Itemid=53 |title=Iraqi new flag to be identified before year end |accessdate=2008-10-12 |publisher=[[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] |date=2008-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nAnother design was also proposed similar to the 2004–2008 flag, but the script was changed to yellow to represent the Kurdish people in northern Iraq. The meaning of the three stars would be changed to symbolize peace, tolerance and justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/080115-new-iraq-flag |title=Iraq's new flag half satisfies everyone |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands]] |accessdate=2008-01-24 |date=2008-01-15 |last=Charif |first=Chalaan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118074558/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/080115-new-iraq-flag |archivedate=2008-01-18 |df= }}</ref>{{-}}\n\n==Subnational flag==\n===Regions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!!style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!!style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!!style=\"width:250px;\"|Description\n|-\n| [[File:Flag of Kurdistan.svg|border|100px]] || 1992 || [[Flag of Kurdistan]], used in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] || Ratio: 2.3\n|}\n\n===Governorates===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!!style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!!style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!!style=\"width:250px;\"|Description\n|-\n| [[File:Flag of Baghdad Governorate.png|border|100px]] ||  || Flag of [[Baghdad Governorate]] || Ratio: 2.3\n|-\n| [[File:Flag of Basra Governorate.svg|border|100px]] ||  || Flag of [[Basra Governorate]] || Ratio: 2.3\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Flag of Syria]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Flags of Iraq}}\n{{wikinews|Iraq removes Saddam references from flag}}\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7203222.stm Iraq parliament approves new flag]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3660663.stm Iraq unveils new national flag] (BBC)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008121650/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/94E338BA-2CAF-4267-A9FC-5C425A108CE1.htm Controversial new Iraqi flag unfurled] (al-Jazeera)\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3663387.stm Iraqis unimpressed by flag design] (BBC; refers to the sibling relationship between the al-Chaderchis, accusations of nepotism)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010095800/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0428-03.htm Burning with anger: Iraqis infuriated by new flag that was designed in London] ''(The Independent,'' reaction of Iraqis, sibling relationship)\n*[http://www.arabic-radio-tv.com/Iq_flags.htm Flags of Modern Iraq] '' (Arabic-Radio-TV,'' The Flags of Modern Iraq (1921–present)\n* {{FOTW|id=iq|title=Iraq}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/world/middleeast/23iraq.html?bl&ex=1201323600&en=a0708912c54bf08f&ei=5087%0A New York Times article on new flag]\n*[http://www.gjpi.org/ Global Justice Project: Iraq]\n\n{{clear}}\n{{Iraq topics}}\n{{Arab Flags}}\n{{Asia topic|Flag of|title=[[Flags of Asia]]}}\n{{nationalflags}}<!-- to edit this table, go to [[Template:Nationalflags]] -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flag Of Iraq}}\n[[Category:Flags of Iraq| ]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Iraq]]\n[[Category:National flags|Iraq]]\n[[Category:Flags adopted through competition|Iraq flag controversy of 2004]]\n[[Category:Flags including Arabic script]]\n[[Category:Flags introduced in 1963|Irak]]\n[[Category:Flags introduced in 1991|Irak]]\n[[Category:Flags introduced in 2004|Irak]]\n[[Category:Flags introduced in 2008|Irak]]"

The slogan eventually became a sign of public protest against the dictatorship of Yemeni President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]. It was first widely used during a visit of [[Sa'dah]] by Saleh in January 2003. At the time, the President intended to make a speech during the Friday prayers, but was drowned out by locals who chanted the slogan to protest against his policies. The Yemeni government responded with a crackdown, and 600 people were arrested for having used the slogan. This only worsened the situation, however, and the slogan spread in northern Yemen.<ref name=\"simple\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mepc.org/conflict-yemen-simple-people-complicated-circumstances |title=Conflict in Yemen: Simple People, Complicated Circumstances |author=Lucas Winter |work=Middle East Policy Council |date= |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe Houthi movement officially adopted the slogan in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] which was widely condemned in the Arab world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/12/18/who-are-the-houthis-and-why-are-we-at-war-with-them/ |title=Who are the Houthis, and why are we at war with them? |author= Bruce Riedel |work=Brookings |date=18 December 2017 |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> This brought the movement on full collision course with the government, as the latter maintained its official pro-American politics despite public opposition.
