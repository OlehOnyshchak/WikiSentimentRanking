This makes the spreadsheet useful for \"what-if\" analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without manual recalculation. Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets, and can display data either as text and numerals, or in graphical form.\n\nBesides performing basic [[arithmetic]] and [[mathematical function]]s, modern spreadsheets provide built-in functions for common [[financial]] and [[statistical]] operations. Such calculations as [[net present value]] or [[standard deviation]] can be applied to tabular data with a pre-programmed function in a formula. Spreadsheet programs also provide conditional expressions, functions to convert between text and numbers, and functions that operate on [[String (computer science)|strings]] of text.\n\nSpreadsheets have replaced paper-based systems throughout the business world. Although they were first developed for accounting or [[bookkeeping]] tasks, they now are used extensively in any context where tabular lists are built, sorted, and shared.\n\nLANPAR, available in 1969,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ms--K3jipt4C&pg=PT149&dq=LANPAR#v=onepage&q=LANPAR&f=false|title=The Grid Book|last=Higgins|first=Hannah|date=2009-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262512404|language=en}}</ref> was the first electronic spreadsheet on mainframe and time sharing computers.

[[List of online spreadsheets|Web based spreadsheets]] are a relatively new category.\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:LibreOffice Calc 6.2 screenshot.png|alt=Libreoffice Calc Spreadsheet|thumb|400x400px|[[LibreOffice Calc]] spreadsheet]]\nA spreadsheet consists of a table of ''cells'' arranged into rows and columns and referred to by the X and Y locations. X locations, the columns, are normally represented by letters, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc., while rows are normally represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc. A single cell can be referred to by addressing its row and column, \"C10\" for instance. This electronic concept of cell references was first introduced in LANPAR (Language for Programming Arrays at Random) (co-invented by Rene Pardo and Remy Landau) and a variant used in VisiCalc, and known as \"A1 notation\". \nAdditionally, spreadsheets have the concept of a ''range'', a group of cells, normally contiguous. For instance, one can refer to the first ten cells in the first column with the range \"A1:A10\". LANPAR innovated forward referencing/natural order calculation which didn't re-appear until Lotus 123 and Microsoft's MultiPlan Version 2.\n\nIn modern spreadsheet applications, several spreadsheets, often known as ''worksheets'' or simply ''sheets'', are gathered together to form a ''workbook''. A workbook is physically represented by a file, containing all the data for the book, the sheets and the cells with the sheets. Worksheets are normally represented by tabs that flip between pages, each one containing one of the sheets, although [[Numbers (spreadsheet)|Numbers]] changes this model significantly. Cells in a multi-sheet book add the sheet name to their reference, for instance, \"Sheet 1!C10\". Some systems extend this syntax to allow cell references to different workbooks.\n\nUsers interact with sheets primarily through the cells. A given cell can hold data by simply entering it in, or a formula, which is normally created by preceding the text with an equals sign. Data might include the string of text <code>hello world</code>, the number <code>5</code> or the date <code>16-Dec-91</code>. A formula would begin with the equals sign, <code>=5*3</code>, but this would normally be invisible because the display shows the ''result'' of the calculation, <code>15</code> in this case, not the formula itself. This may lead to confusion in some cases.\n\nThe key feature of spreadsheets is the ability for a formula to refer to the contents of other cells, which may in turn be the result of a formula. To make such a formula, one simply replaces a number with a cell reference. For instance, the formula <code>=5*C10</code> would produce the result of multiplying the value in cell C10 by the number 5. If C10 holds the value <code>3</code> the result will be <code>15</code>. But C10 might also hold its own formula referring to other cells, and so on.\n\nThe ability to chain formulas together is what gives a spreadsheet its power. Many problems can be broken down into a series of individual mathematical steps, and these can be assigned to individual formulas in cells. Some of these formulas can apply to ranges as well, like the <code>SUM</code> function that adds up all the numbers within a range.\n\nSpreadsheets share many principles and traits of [[database]]s, but spreadsheets and databases are not the same thing. A spreadsheet is essentially just one table, whereas a database is a collection of many tables with [[Machine-readable medium|machine-readable]] semantic relationships between them. While it is true that a workbook that contains three sheets is indeed a file containing multiple tables that can interact with each other, it lacks the [[relational model|relational structure]] of a database. Spreadsheets and databases are interoperable—sheets can be [[import and export of data|imported]] into databases to become tables within them, and database queries can be exported into spreadsheets for further analysis.\n\nA spreadsheet program is one of the main components of an [[office suite|office productivity suite]], which usually also contains a [[word processor]], a [[presentation program]], and a [[database]] management system. Programs within a suite use similar commands for similar functions. Usually sharing data between the components is easier than with a non-integrated collection of functionally equivalent programs. This was particularly an advantage at a time when many personal computer systems used text-mode displays and commands, instead of a [[graphical user interface]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Paper spreadsheets ===\nThe word 'spreadsheet' came from 'spread' in its sense of a newspaper or magazine item (text or graphics) that covers two facing pages, extending across the center fold and treating the two pages as one large page. The compound word 'spread-sheet' came to mean the format used to present book-keeping [[ledgers]]—with columns for categories of expenditures across the top, invoices listed down the left margin, and the amount of each payment in the cell where its row and column intersect—which were, traditionally, a \"spread\" across facing pages of a bound ledger (book for keeping accounting records) or on oversized sheets of paper (termed 'analysis paper') ruled into rows and columns in that format and approximately twice as wide as ordinary paper.<ref name=\"sshistory\">{{Cite web |url=http://dssresources.com/history/sshistory.html |last=Power |first=D. J. |title=A Brief History of Spreadsheets |website=DSSResources.COM |edition=3.6 |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Early implementations ===\n\n==== Batch spreadsheet report generator ====\nA [[batch processing|batch]] \"spreadsheet\" is indistinguishable from a batch compiler with added input data, producing an output report, ''i.e.'', a [[4GL]] or conventional, non-interactive, batch computer program. However, this concept of an electronic spreadsheet was outlined in the 1961 paper \"Budgeting Models and System Simulation\" by [[Richard Mattessich]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Budgeting Models and System Simulation |first=Richard |last=Mattessich |author-link=Richard Mattessich|journal=The Accounting Review |volume=36 |issue=3 |year=1961 |pages=384–397 |jstor=242869}}</ref> The subsequent work by Mattessich (1964a, Chpt. 9, ''Accounting and Analytical Methods'') and its companion volume, Mattessich (1964b, ''Simulation of the Firm through a Budget Computer Program'') applied computerized spreadsheets to accounting and budgeting systems (on [[mainframe computer]]s programmed in [[FORTRAN IV]]). These batch Spreadsheets dealt primarily with the addition or subtraction of entire columns or rows (of input variables), rather than individual ''cells''.\n\nIn 1962 this concept of the spreadsheet, called BCL for Business Computer Language, was implemented on an [[IBM 1130]] and in 1963 was [[ported]] to an [[IBM 7040]] by R. Brian Walsh at [[Marquette University]], [[Wisconsin]]. This program was written in [[Fortran]]. Primitive [[timesharing]] was available on those machines. In 1968 BCL was ported by Walsh to the [[IBM 360]]/67 timesharing machine at [[Washington State University]]. It was used to assist in the teaching of [[finance]] to business students. Students were able to take information prepared by the [[professor]] and manipulate it to represent it and show ratios etc. In 1964, a book entitled ''Business Computer Language'' was written by Kimball, Stoffells and Walsh and both the book and program were copyrighted in 1966 and years later that copyright was renewed<ref>{{cite web |url= |title=Business Computer Language |accessdate= |author=Brian Walsh |year=1996 |work=IT-Directors.com}}</ref>\n\nApplied Data Resources had a FORTRAN preprocessor called Empires.\n\nIn the late 1960s Xerox used BCL to develop a more sophisticated version for their timesharing system.\n\n==== LANPAR spreadsheet compiler ====\nA key invention in the development of electronic spreadsheets was made by Rene K. Pardo and Remy Landau, who filed in 1970 {{US patent|4398249}} on a spreadsheet automatic natural order calculation [[algorithm]]. While the patent was initially rejected by the patent office as being a purely mathematical invention, following 12 years of appeals, Pardo and Landau won a landmark court case at the Predecessor Court of the Federal Circuit (CCPA), overturning the Patent Office in 1983&nbsp;— establishing that \"something does not cease to become patentable merely because the point of novelty is in an algorithm.\" However, in 1995 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] ruled the patent unenforceable.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/Federal/judicial/fed/opinions/95opinions/95-1350.html |title = Refac v. Lotus |website = Ll.georgetown.edu |access-date=2010-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe actual software was called LANPAR&nbsp;— LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random.{{NoteTag|This may be a [[backronym]], as \"LANPAR is also a [[portmanteau]] of the developers' surnames, \"''Lan''dau\" and \"''Par''do\".}} This was conceived and entirely developed in the summer of 1969, following Pardo and Landau's recent graduation from Harvard University. Co-inventor Rene Pardo recalls that he felt that one manager at Bell Canada should not have to depend on programmers to program and modify budgeting forms, and he thought of letting users type out forms in any order and having an electronic computer calculate results in the right order (\"Forward Referencing/Natural Order Calculation\"). Pardo and Landau developed and implemented the software in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.renepardo.com |title = Rene Pardo – Personal Web Page |website = renepardo.com }}</ref>\n\nLANPAR was used by Bell Canada, AT&T and the 18 operating telephone companies nationwide for their local and national budgeting operations. LANPAR was also used by General Motors. Its uniqueness was Pardo's co-invention incorporating forward referencing/natural order calculation (one of the first \"non-procedural\" computer languages)<ref>http://www.renepardo.com/articles/spreadsheet.pdf</ref> as opposed to left-to-right, top to bottom sequence for calculating the results in each cell that was used by [[VisiCalc]], [[SuperCalc]], and the first version of [[MultiPlan]]. Without forward referencing/natural order calculation, the user had to manually recalculate the spreadsheet as many times as necessary until the values in all the cells had stopped changing. Forward referencing/natural order calculation by a compiler was the cornerstone functionality required for any spreadsheet to be practical and successful.\n\nThe LANPAR system was implemented on GE400 and Honeywell 6000 online timesharing systems, enabling users to program remotely via computer terminals and modems. Data could be entered dynamically either by paper tape, specific file access, on line, or even external data bases. Sophisticated mathematical expressions, including logical comparisons and \"if/then\" statements, could be used in any cell, and cells could be presented in any order.\n\n==== Autoplan/Autotab spreadsheet programming language ====\nIn 1968, three former employees from the [[General Electric]] computer company headquartered in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] set out to start their own [[software development house]]. A. Leroy Ellison, Harry N. Cantrell, and Russell E. Edwards found themselves doing a large number of calculations when making tables for the business plans that they were presenting to venture capitalists. They decided to save themselves a lot of effort and wrote a computer program that produced their tables for them. This program, originally conceived as a simple utility for their personal use, would turn out to be the first software product offered by the company that would become known as [[Capex Corporation]]. \"AutoPlan\" ran on GE’s [[Time-sharing]] service; afterward, a version that ran on [[IBM mainframe]]s was introduced under the name ''AutoTab''. ([[National CSS]] offered a similar product, CSSTAB, which had a moderate timesharing user base by the early 1970s. A major application was opinion research tabulation.)\n\nAutoPlan/AutoTab was not a [[WYSIWYG]] [[interactive]] spreadsheet program, it was a simple scripting language for spreadsheets. The user defined the names and labels for the rows and columns, then the formulas that defined each row or column. In 1975, Autotab-II was advertised as extending the original to a maximum of \"''1,500 rows and columns, combined in any proportion the user requires...''\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PPeM_JUhUqEC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=autotab-iI&source=bl&ots=-aGsSzb8VP&sig=byBwwRhRG2tDlbWq_Bv8MEWmeuY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA1-2goazNAhXHQpQKHe6qDKQQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=autotab-iI&f=false \"'Autotab' Update Extends Former Matrix Size Limits\"], 28 May 1975, p19, Computerworld</ref>\n\nGE Information Services, which operated the time-sharing service, also launched its own spreadsheet system, Financial Analysis Language (FAL), circa 1974.  It was later supplemented by an additional spreadsheet language, TABOL<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 1983|title=COMPANY HIGHLIGHT: GENERAL ELECTRIC INFORMATION SERVICES COMPANY|url=https://ia801302.us.archive.org/18/items/VAP-FtoGcompany/VAP-FtoGcompany.pdf|journal=INPUT Vendor Analysis Program|publisher=INPUT|volume=|pages=|quote=TABOL Database Manager (TDM), an enhancement to the TABOL financial analysis language, was also introduced in August 1982|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Enterprise1982\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=30 August 1982|title=Package of Features Added to Mark III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlHBOATYlCcC&pg=PA46|journal=Computerworld|publisher=IDG Enterprise|volume=|pages=46|id={{ISSN|0010-4841}}|via=}}</ref>, which was developed by an independent author, Oliver Vellacott in the UK.  Both FAL and TABOL were integrated with GEIS's database system, DMS.\n\n==== IBM Financial Planning and Control System ====\nThe IBM Financial Planning and Control System was developed in 1976, by [[Brian Ingham]] at [[IBM]] Canada. It was implemented by IBM in at least 30 countries. It ran on an [[IBM mainframe]] and was among the first applications for [[financial]] planning developed with [[APL (programming language)|APL]] that completely hid the programming language from the end-user. Through IBM's [[VM operating system]], it was among the first programs to auto-update each copy of the [[application software|application]] as new versions were released. Users could specify simple mathematical relationships between rows and between columns. Compared to any contemporary alternatives, it could support very large spreadsheets. It loaded actual [[financial]] [[data]] drawn from the legacy batch system into each user's spreadsheet on a monthly basis. It was designed to optimize the power of APL through [[object kernels]], increasing program efficiency by as much as 50 fold over traditional programming approaches.\n\n==== APLDOT modeling language ====\nAn example of an early \"industrial weight\" spreadsheet was APLDOT, developed in 1976 at the [[United States Railway Association]] on an IBM 360/91, running at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD.<ref>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=390005.801196 portal.acm.org] – APLDOT</ref> The application was used successfully for many years in developing such applications as financial and costing models for the US Congress and for [[Conrail]]. APLDOT was dubbed a \"spreadsheet\" because financial analysts and strategic planners used it to solve the same problems they addressed with paper spreadsheet pads.\n\n=== VisiCalc ===\n[[File:Visicalc.png|thumb|VisiCalc running on an Apple II]]\n\nBecause of [[Dan Bricklin]] and [[Bob Frankston]]'s implementation of [[VisiCalc]] on the [[Apple II]] in 1979 and the [[IBM PC]] in 1981, the spreadsheet concept became widely known in the late 1970s and early 1980s. VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet that combined all essential features of modern spreadsheet applications (except for forward referencing/natural order recalculation), such as [[WYSIWYG]] interactive user interface, automatic recalculation, status and formula lines, range copying with relative and absolute references, formula building by selecting referenced cells. Unaware of LANPAR at the time ''[[PC World]]'' magazine called VisiCalc the first electronic spreadsheet.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,116166/article.html PC World&nbsp;– Three Minutes: Godfathers of the Spreadsheet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBricklin has spoken of watching his university professor create a table of calculation results on a [[blackboard]]. When the professor found an error, he had to tediously erase and rewrite a number of sequential entries in the table, triggering Bricklin to think that he could replicate the process on a computer, using the blackboard as the model to view results of underlying formulas. His idea became VisiCalc, the first [[Application software|application]] that turned the [[personal computer]] from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool.\n\nVisiCalc went on to become the first \"[[killer application]]\",<ref>Power, D.J., ''[http://www.dssresources.com/history/sshistory.html A Brief History of Spreadsheets]'', DSSResources.COM, v3.6, 8 August 2004</ref><ref name=\"cacASU\">\"Killer Applications\" (overview), Partha gawaargupta.

VisiCalc was in no small part responsible for the [[Apple II]]'s success. The program was later [[ported]] to a number of other early computers, notably [[CP/M]] machines, the [[Atari 8-bit family]] and various [[Commodore International|Commodore]] platforms. Nevertheless, VisiCalc remains best known as an Apple II program.\n\n=== SuperCalc ===\n\n[[SuperCalc]] was a spreadsheet application published by Sorcim in 1980, and originally bundled (along with WordStar) as part of the CP/M software package included with the Osborne 1 portable computer. It quickly became the de facto standard spreadsheet for CP/M and was ported to MS-DOS in 1982.\n\n=== Lotus 1-2-3 and other MS-DOS spreadsheets ===\nThe acceptance of the [[IBM PC]] following its introduction in August, 1981, began slowly, because most of the programs available for it were translations from other computer models. Things changed dramatically with the introduction of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] in November, 1982, and release for sale in January, 1983. Since it was written especially for the IBM PC, it had good performance and became the killer app for this PC. Lotus 1-2-3 drove sales of the PC due to the improvements in speed and graphics compared to VisiCalc on the Apple II.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_for_1986_1985_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_for_1986_1985_Point_djvu.txt|title=Whole Earth Software Catalog|quote=Some say that half of all IBM PCs, in their hundreds of thousands, are running just 1-2-3.

Lotus 1-2-3 was released on January 26, 1983, started outselling then-most-popular [[VisiCalc]] the very same year, and for a number of years was the leading spreadsheet for [[DOS]].\n\n=== Microsoft Excel ===\n[[Microsoft]] released the first version of [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] for the Macintosh on September 30, 1985, and then ported<ref>{{cite book |last1=Liebowitz |first1=Stan |last2=Margolis |first2=Stephen |year=2001 |chapter=6 |editor1-last=Ellig |editor1-first=Jerome |title=Dynamic Competition and Public Policy: Technology, Innovation, and Antitrust Issues |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynmOndJFoeQC&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=microsoft+ported+excel+windows+1987&source=bl&ots=RHbdl3Fec1&sig=zC6ht-MfeI0CU9t56JIdfnfo5js&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CBhuVJHDEYyCigKA0YDgDg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=microsoft%20ported%20excel%20windows%201987&f=false |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=171 |isbn=978-0-521-78250-0 }}</ref> it to Windows, with the first version being numbered 2.05 (to synchronize with the Macintosh version 2.2) and released in November 1987. The Windows 3.x platforms of the early 1990s made it possible for Excel to take market share from Lotus. By the time Lotus responded with usable Windows products, Microsoft had begun to assemble their [[Microsoft Office|Office]] suite. By 1995, Excel was the market leader, edging out Lotus 1-2-3,<ref name=\"sshistory\" /> and in 2013, IBM discontinued Lotus 1-2-3 altogether.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/goodbye-lotus-1-2-3-7000015385/ |title=Goodbye, Lotus 1-2-3 |last1=Vaughan-Nichols |first1=Steven J. |date=15 May 2013 |website=zdnet.com |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Web based spreadsheets ===\n{{Main|List of online spreadsheets}}\nWith the advent of advanced [[World Wide Web|web]] technologies such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] circa 2005, a new generation of [[List of online spreadsheets|online spreadsheets]] has emerged. Equipped with a [[rich Internet application]] user experience, the best web based online spreadsheets have many of the features seen in desktop spreadsheet applications.

Lotus introduced what is likely the most successful example, [[Lotus Improv]], which saw some commercial success, notably in the financial world where its powerful [[data mining]] capabilities remain well respected to this day.\n\n[[Spreadsheet 2000]] attempted to dramatically simplify formula construction, but was generally not successful.\n\n== Concepts ==\nThe main concepts are those of a grid of [[table cell|cells]], called a sheet, with either raw data, called values, or formulas in the cells. Formulas say how to mechanically compute new values from existing values. Values are generally numbers, but can also be pure text, dates, months, etc. Extensions of these concepts include logical spreadsheets. Various tools for programming sheets, visualizing data, remotely connecting sheets, displaying cells' dependencies, etc. are commonly provided.\n\n=== Cells ===\nA '''\"cell\"''' can be thought of as a box for holding [[data]]. A single cell is usually referenced by its column and row (C2 would represent the cell containing the value 30 in the example table below). Usually rows, representing the [[dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]], are referenced in [[decimal notation]] starting from 1, while columns representing the [[dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] use 26-adic [[bijective numeration]] using the letters A-Z as numerals. Its physical size can usually be tailored to its content by dragging its height or width at box intersections (or for entire columns or rows by dragging the column- or row-headers).\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ My Spreadsheet\n!   !!  A !!  B !! C  !!  D\n|-\n!01 \n| Sales || 100000 || 30000 || 70000\n|-\n!02 \n| Purchases || 25490 || 30 || 200\n|}\n\nAn array of cells is called a ''sheet'' or ''worksheet''. It is analogous to an array of [[Variable (programming)|variables]] in a conventional [[computer program]] (although certain unchanging values, once entered, could be considered, by the same analogy, [[constant (computer science)|constants]]). In most implementations, many worksheets may be located within a single spreadsheet. A worksheet is simply a subset of the spreadsheet divided for the sake of clarity. Functionally, the spreadsheet operates as a whole and all cells operate as [[global variable]]s within the spreadsheet (each variable having 'read' access only except its own containing cell).\n\nA cell may contain a [[Value (computer science)|value]] or a [[formula]], or it may simply be left empty.\nBy convention, formulas usually begin with '''=''' sign.\n\n==== Values ====\nA value can be entered from the computer keyboard by directly typing into the cell itself. Alternatively, a value can be based on a formula (see below), which might perform a calculation, display the current date or time, or retrieve external data such as a stock quote or a database value.\n\n<blockquote>'''The Spreadsheet ''Value Rule'''''\n\nComputer scientist [[Alan Kay]] used the term ''value rule'' to summarize a spreadsheet's operation: a cell's value relies solely on the formula the user has typed into the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kay | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Kay | title=Computer Software | journal =Scientific American | volume =251 | issue =3 | pages =52–59 |date=September 1984 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0984-52  | pmid=6390676 | last2=Goldstein | first2=JL| bibcode=1984SciAm.251c..52K }} – Value Rule</ref> The formula may rely on the value of other cells, but those cells are likewise restricted to user-entered data or formulas. There are no 'side effects' to calculating a formula: the only output is to display the calculated result inside its occupying cell. There is no natural mechanism for permanently modifying the contents of a cell unless the user manually modifies the cell's contents. In the context of programming languages, this yields a limited form of first-order [[functional programming]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burnett |first=Margaret|author1-link=Margaret Burnett |last2=Atwood |first2=J. |last3=Walpole Djang |first3=R. |last4=Reichwein |first4=J. |last5=Gottfried |first5=H. |last6=Yang |first6=S. |title=Forms/3: A first-order visual language to explore the boundaries of the spreadsheet paradigm |journal=Journal of Functional Programming |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=155–206 |date=March 2001 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=72731 |accessdate=2008-06-22}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==== Automatic recalculation ====\nA standard of spreadsheets since the 1980s, this optional feature eliminates the need to manually request the spreadsheet program to recalculate values (nowadays typically the default option unless specifically 'switched off' for large spreadsheets, usually to improve performance). Some earlier spreadsheets required a manual request to recalculate, since recalculation of large or complex spreadsheets often reduced data entry speed. Many modern spreadsheets still retain this option.\n\nRecalculation generally requires that there are no [[circular dependency|circular dependencies]] in a spreadsheet. A [[dependency graph]] is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. Dependency graphs without circular dependencies form [[directed acyclic graph]]s, representations of partial orderings (in this case, across a spreadsheet) that can be relied upon to give a definite result.<ref>{{citation |mode=cs1 | last1=Al-Mutawa | first1=H. A. | last2=Dietrich | first2=J. | last3=Marsland | first3=S. | last4=McCartin | first4=C. | contribution=On the shape of circular dependencies in Java programs | doi=10.1109/ASWEC.2014.15 | pages=48–57 | publisher=IEEE | title=23rd Australian Software Engineering Conference | year=2014| isbn=978-1-4799-3149-1 }}</ref>\n\n==== Real-time update ====\nThis feature refers to updating a cell's contents periodically with a value from an external source—such as a cell in a \"remote\" spreadsheet. For shared, Web-based spreadsheets, it applies to \"immediately\" updating cells another user has updated. All dependent cells must be updated also.\n\n==== Locked cell ====\nOnce entered, selected cells (or the entire spreadsheet) can optionally be \"locked\" to prevent accidental overwriting. Typically this would apply to cells containing formulas but might be applicable to cells containing \"constants\" such as a kilogram/pounds conversion factor (2.20462262 to eight decimal places). Even though individual cells are marked as locked, the spreadsheet data are not protected until the feature is activated in the file preferences.\n\n==== Data format ====\nA cell or range can optionally be defined to specify how the value is displayed. The default display format is usually set by its initial content if not specifically previously set, so that for example \"31/12/2007\" or \"31 Dec 2007\" would default to the cell format of ''date''.\nSimilarly adding a % sign after a numeric value would tag the cell as a [[percentage]] cell format. The cell contents are not changed by this format, only the displayed value.\n\nSome cell formats such as \"numeric\" or \"[[currency]]\" can also specify the number of [[decimal place]]s.\n\nThis can allow invalid operations (such as doing multiplication on a cell containing a date), resulting in illogical results without an appropriate warning.\n\n==== Cell formatting ====\nDepending on the capability of the spreadsheet application, each cell (like its counterpart the \"style\" in a [[word processor]]) can be separately formatted using the [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of either the content (point size, color, bold or italic) or the cell (border thickness, background shading, color). To aid the readability of a spreadsheet, cell formatting may be conditionally applied to data; for example, a negative number may be displayed in red.\n\nA cell's formatting does not typically affect its content and depending on how cells are referenced or copied to other worksheets or applications, the formatting may not be carried with the content.\n\n==== Named cells ====\n[[File:Named Variables in Excel.PNG|thumb|400px|Use of named column variables ''x'' & ''y'' in [[Microsoft Excel]]. Formula for y=x<sup>2</sup> resembles [[Fortran]], and ''Name Manager'' shows the definitions of ''x'' & ''y''.]]\n\nIn most implementations, a cell, or group of cells in a column or row, can be \"named\" enabling the user to refer to those cells by a name rather than by a grid reference. Names must be unique within the spreadsheet, but when using multiple sheets in a spreadsheet file, an identically named cell range on each sheet can be used if it is distinguished by adding the sheet name. One reason for this usage is for creating or running macros that repeat a command across many sheets. Another reason is that formulas with named variables are readily checked against the algebra they are intended to implement (they resemble Fortran expressions). Use of named variables and named functions also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent.\n\n===== Cell reference =====\nIn place of a named cell, an alternative approach is to use a cell (or grid) reference. Most cell references indicate another cell in the same spreadsheet, but a cell reference can also refer to a cell in a different sheet within the same spreadsheet, or (depending on the implementation) to a cell in another spreadsheet entirely, or to a value from a remote application.\n\nA typical '''cell reference''' in \"A1\" style consists of one or two case-insensitive letters to identify the column (if there are up to 256 columns: A–Z and AA–IV) followed by a row number (e.g., in the range 1–65536). Either part can be relative (it changes when the formula it is in is moved or copied), or absolute (indicated with $ in front of the part concerned of the cell reference). The alternative \"R1C1\" reference style consists of the letter R, the row number, the letter C, and the column number; relative row or column numbers are indicated by enclosing the number in square brackets. Most current spreadsheets use the A1 style, some providing the R1C1 style as a compatibility option.\n\nWhen the computer calculates a formula in one cell to update the displayed value of that cell, cell reference(s) in that cell, naming some other cell(s), cause the computer to fetch the value of the named cell(s).\n\nA cell on the same \"sheet\" is usually addressed as:\n\n =A1\n\nA cell on a different sheet of the same spreadsheet is usually addressed as:\n\n =SHEET2!A1             (that is; the first cell in sheet 2 of same spreadsheet).\n\nSome spreadsheet implementations in Excel allow a cell references to another spreadsheet (not the current open and active file) on the same computer or a local network. It may also refer to a cell in another open and active spreadsheet on the same computer or network that is defined as shareable. These references contain the complete filename, such as:\n\n ='C:\\Documents and Settings\\Username\\My spreadsheets\\[main sheet]Sheet1!A1\n\nIn a spreadsheet, references to cells automatically update when new rows or columns are inserted or deleted. Care must be taken, however, when adding a row immediately before a set of column totals to ensure that the totals reflect the additional rows values—which they often do not.\n\nA [[circular reference]] occurs when the formula in one cell refers—directly, or indirectly through a chain of cell references—to another cell that refers back to the first cell. Many common errors cause circular references. However, some valid techniques use circular references. These techniques, after many spreadsheet recalculations, (usually) converge on the correct values for those cells.\n\n===== Cell ranges =====\nLikewise, instead of using a named range of cells, a range reference can be used. Reference to a range of cells is typically of the form (A1:A6), which specifies all the cells in the range A1 through to A6. A formula such as \"=SUM(A1:A6)\" would add all the cells specified and put the result in the cell containing the formula itself.\n\n=== Sheets ===\nIn the earliest spreadsheets, cells were a simple two-dimensional grid. Over time, the model has expanded to include a third dimension, and in some cases a series of named grids, called sheets. The most advanced examples allow inversion and rotation operations which can slice and project the data set in various ways.\n\n=== Formulas ===\n[[File:Spreadsheet animation.gif|thumb|right|279px|Animation of a simple spreadsheet that multiplies values in the left column by 2, then sums the calculated values from the right column to the bottom-most cell. In this example, only the values in the <code>A</code> column are entered (10, 20, 30), and the remainder of cells are formulas. Formulas in the <code>B</code> column multiply values from the A column using relative references, and the formula in <code>B4</code> uses the <code>SUM()</code> function to find the [[Summation|sum]] of values in the <code>B1:B3</code> range.]]\n\nA formula identifies the [[calculation]] needed to place the result in the cell it is contained within. A cell containing a formula therefore has two display components; the formula itself and the resulting value. The formula is normally only shown when the cell is selected by \"clicking\" the mouse over a particular cell; otherwise it contains the result of the calculation.\n\nA formula assigns values to a cell or range of cells, and typically has the format:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<code>=''expression''</code>\n|}\nwhere the [[Expression (programming)|expression]] consists of:\n*[[Value (computer science)|values]], such as <code>2</code>, <code>9.14</code> or <code>6.67E-11</code>;\n*[[Reference (computer science)|references]] to other cells, such as, e.g., <code>A1</code> for a single cell or <code>B1:B3</code> for a range;\n*[[Operator (programming)|arithmetic operators]], such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and others;\n*[[relational operator]]s, such as <code>>=</code>, <code><</code>, and others; and,\n*[[Function (programming)|functions]], such as <code>SUM()</code>, <code>TAN()</code>, and many others.\n\nWhen a cell contains a formula, it often contains references to other cells. Such a cell reference is a type of variable. Its value is the value of the referenced cell or some derivation of it. If that cell in turn references other cells, the value depends on the values of those. References can be relative (e.g., <code>A1</code>, or <code>B1:B3</code>), absolute (e.g., <code>$A$1</code>, or <code>$B$1:$B$3</code>) or mixed row– or column-wise absolute/relative (e.g., <code>$A1</code> is column-wise absolute and <code>A$1</code> is row-wise absolute).\n\nThe available options for valid formulas depends on the particular spreadsheet implementation but, in general, most arithmetic operations and quite complex nested conditional operations can be performed by most of today's commercial spreadsheets. Modern implementations also offer functions to access custom-build functions, remote data, and applications.\n\nA formula may contain a condition (or nested conditions)—with or without an actual calculation—and is sometimes used purely to identify and '''highlight errors'''. In the example below, it is assumed the sum of a column of percentages (A1 through A6) is tested for validity and an explicit message put into the adjacent right-hand cell.\n\n:=IF(SUM(A1:A6) > 100, \"More than 100%\", SUM(A1:A6))\n\nFurther examples:\n:=IF(AND(A1<>\"\",B1<>\"\"),A1/B1,\"\") means that if both cells A1 and B1 are not <> empty \"\", then divide A1 by B1 and display, other do not display anything.\n:=IF(AND(A1<>\"\",B1<>\"\"),IF(B1<>0,A1/B1,\"Division by zero\"),\"\") means that if cells A1 and B1 are not empty, and B1 is not zero, then divide A1 by B1, if B1 is zero, then display \"Division by zero\", and do not display anything if either A1 and B1 are empty.\n:=IF(OR(A1<>\"\",B1<>\"\"),\"Either A1 or B1 show text\",\"\") means to display the text if either cells A1 or B1 are not empty.\n\nThe best way to build up conditional statements is step by step composing followed by trial and error testing and refining code.\n\nA spreadsheet does not, in fact, have to contain any formulas at all, in which case it could be considered merely a collection of data arranged in rows and columns (a [[database]]) like a calendar, timetable or simple list. Because of its ease of use, formatting and [[hyperlinking]] capabilities, many spreadsheets are used solely for this purpose.\n\n=== Functions ===\n[[File:Functions in Excel.PNG|thumb|400px|Use of user-defined function ''sq(x)'' in [[Microsoft Excel]]. ]]\nSpreadsheets usually contain a number of supplied [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], such as arithmetic operations (for example, summations, averages and so forth), trigonometric functions, statistical functions, and so forth. In addition there is often a provision for ''user-defined functions''. In Microsoft Excel these functions are defined using [[Visual Basic for Applications]] in the supplied Visual Basic editor, and such functions are automatically accessible on the worksheet. In addition, programs can be written that pull information from the worksheet, perform some calculations, and report the results back to the worksheet. In the figure, the name ''sq'' is user-assigned, and function ''sq'' is introduced using the [[Visual Basic for Applications|''Visual Basic'']] editor supplied with Excel. ''Name Manager'' displays the spreadsheet definitions of named variables ''x'' & ''y''.\n\n=== Subroutines ===\n[[File:Subroutine in Excel.PNG|thumb|400px|Subroutine in [[Microsoft Excel]] writes values calculated using ''x'' into ''y''.]]\nFunctions themselves cannot write into the worksheet, but simply return their evaluation. However, in Microsoft Excel, [[subroutine]]s can write values or text found within the subroutine directly to the spreadsheet. The figure shows the Visual Basic code for a subroutine that reads each member of the named column variable ''x'', calculates its square, and writes this value into the corresponding element of named column variable ''y''. The ''y'' column contains no formula because its values are calculated in the subroutine, not on the spreadsheet, and simply are written in.\n\n=== Remote spreadsheet ===\nWhenever a reference is made to a cell or group of cells that are not located within the current physical spreadsheet file, it is considered as accessing a \"remote\" spreadsheet. The contents of the referenced cell may be accessed either on first reference with a manual update or more recently in the case of web based spreadsheets, as a near real time value with a specified automatic refresh interval.\n\n=== Charts ===\n[[File:Excel chart.PNG|thumb|300px|Graph made using Microsoft Excel]]\nMany spreadsheet applications permit [[chart]]s, [[Graph (data structure)|graphs]] or [[histogram]]s to be generated from specified groups of cells that are dynamically re-built as cell contents change. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object. To create an Excel histogram, a formula based on the REPT function can be used.<ref>https://www.xlsoffice.com/excel-functions/text-functions/rept-function-description-usage-syntax-examples-and-explanation/</ref>\n\n=== Multi-dimensional spreadsheets ===\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, first [[Javelin Software]] and [[Lotus Improv]] appeared. Unlike models in a conventional spreadsheet, they utilized models built on objects called variables, not on data in cells of a report. These multi-dimensional spreadsheets enabled viewing data and [[algorithm]]s in various self-documenting ways, including simultaneous multiple synchronized views. For example, users of Javelin could move through the connections between variables on a diagram while seeing the logical roots and branches of each variable. This is an example of what is perhaps its primary contribution of the earlier Javelin—the concept of traceability of a user's logic or model structure through its twelve views. A complex model can be dissected and understood by others who had no role in its creation.\n\nIn these programs, a [[time series]], or any variable, was an object in itself, not a collection of cells that happen to appear in a row or column. Variables could have many attributes, including complete awareness of their connections to all other variables, data references, and text and image notes. Calculations were performed on these objects, as opposed to a range of cells, so adding two time series automatically aligns them in calendar time, or in a user-defined time frame. Data were independent of worksheets—variables, and therefore data, could not be destroyed by deleting a row, column or entire worksheet. For instance, January's costs are subtracted from January's revenues, regardless of where or whether either appears in a worksheet. This permits actions later used in [[pivot table]]s, except that flexible manipulation of report tables was but one of many capabilities supported by variables. Moreover, if costs were entered by week and revenues by month, the program could allocate or interpolate as appropriate. This object design enabled variables and whole models to reference each other with user-defined variable names, and to perform multidimensional analysis and massive, but easily editable consolidations.\n\nTrapeze,<ref name=\"Trapeze\">{{cite web|title=Trapeze|url=http://basalgangster.macgui.com/RetroMacComputing/The_Long_View/Entries/2011/3/26_Trapeze.html}}</ref> a spreadsheet on the Mac, went further and explicitly supported\nnot just table columns, but also matrix operators.\n\n=== Logical spreadsheets ===\nSpreadsheets that have a formula language based upon [[logic]]al expressions, rather than [[arithmetic]] expressions are known as [[logical spreadsheet]]s. Such spreadsheets can be used to reason [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] about their cell values.\n\n== Programming issues ==\nJust as the early programming languages were designed to generate spreadsheet printouts, programming techniques themselves have evolved to process tables (also known as spreadsheets or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]) of data more efficiently in the computer itself.\n\n=== End-user development ===\nSpreadsheets are a popular [[end-user development]] tool.<ref name=\"Empowering Users\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/empowering-users-to-create-their-own-software.php|title=Empowering Users to Create Their Own Software|author=Peter Hornsby}}</ref> EUD denotes activities or techniques in which people who are not professional developers create automated behavior and complex data objects without significant knowledge of a programming language. Many people find it easier to perform calculations in spreadsheets than by writing the equivalent sequential program. This is due to several traits of spreadsheets.\n*They use [[Space|spatial]] relationships to define program relationships. Humans have highly developed [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitions]] about spaces, and of dependencies between items. Sequential programming usually requires typing line after line of text, which must be read slowly and carefully to be understood and changed.\n*They are forgiving, allowing partial results and functions to work. One or more parts of a program can work correctly, even if other parts are unfinished or broken. This makes writing and debugging programs easier, and faster. Sequential programming usually needs every program line and character to be correct for a program to run. One error usually stops the whole program and prevents any result.\n*Modern spreadsheets allow for [[secondary notation]]. The program can be annotated with colors, typefaces, lines, etc. to provide visual cues about the meaning of elements in the program.\n*Extensions that allow users to create new functions can provide the capabilities of a [[functional language]].<ref name=\"excel\">{{cite web | title=Improving the world's most popular functional language: user-defined functions in Excel | first1=Simon | last1=Peyton Jones |authorlink1=Simon Peyton Jones |first2=Margaret |last2=Burnett|author2-link=Margaret Burnett |first3=Alan |last3=Blackwell |authorlink3=Alan Blackwell | url=http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/excel/index.htm |date=March 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016011341/http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/excel/index.htm |archivedate=2005-10-16}}</ref>\n*Extensions that allow users to build and apply models from the domain of [[machine learning]].<ref name=spreadsheet_machinelearning>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Advait|last2=Blackwell|first2=Alan|last3=Jamnik|first3=Mateja|last4=Spott|first4=Martin|title=Teach and Try: A simple interaction technique for exploratory data modelling by end users|journal=2014 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC 2014)|pages=53–56|doi=10.1109/VLHCC.2014.6883022|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4799-4035-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.695.2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Interactive visual machine learning in spreadsheets|journal=2015 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)|date=2015-10-01|pages=159–163|doi=10.1109/VLHCC.2015.7357211|first=A.|last=Sarkar|first2=M.|last2=Jamnik|first3=A.F.|last3=Blackwell|first4=M.|last4=Spott|isbn=978-1-4673-7457-6}}</ref>\n*Spreadsheets are versatile.

This is often called the dependency graph of the spreadsheet. References between cells can take advantage of spatial concepts such as relative position and absolute position, as well as named locations, to make the spreadsheet formulas easier to understand and manage.\n\nSpreadsheets usually attempt to automatically update cells when the cells they depend on change. The earliest spreadsheets used simple tactics like evaluating cells in a particular order, but modern spreadsheets calculate following a minimal recomputation order from the dependency graph. Later spreadsheets also include a limited ability to propagate values in reverse, altering source values so that a particular answer is reached in a certain cell. Since spreadsheet cells formulas are not generally invertible, though, this technique is of somewhat limited value.\n\nMany of the concepts common to sequential programming models have analogues in the spreadsheet world. For example, the sequential model of the [[For loop|indexed loop]] is usually represented as a table of cells, with similar formulas (normally differing only in which cells they reference).\n\nSpreadsheets have evolved to use [[Scripting language|scripting]] programming languages like [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] as a tool for extensibility beyond what the spreadsheet language makes easy.\n\n== Shortcomings ==\nWhile spreadsheets represented a major step forward in quantitative modeling, they have deficiencies. Their shortcomings include the perceived unfriendliness of alpha-numeric cell addresses.<ref>[http://wwwg.uni-klu.ac.at/stochastik.schule/ICTMT_5/ICTMT_5_CD/Special%20groups/CD_Special4.htm Douglas Butler, \"Why are spreadsheets so unfriendly?\", The Fifth International Conference on Technology in Mathematics Teaching, August 2001].

One study in early 2011 of nearly 1,500 people in the UK found that 57% of spreadsheet users have never received formal training on the spreadsheet package they use. 72% said that no internal department checks their spreadsheets for accuracy. Only 13% said that Internal Audit reviews their spreadsheets, while a mere 1% receive checks from their risk department.<ref name=\"Actuarial\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.actuarialpost.co.uk/article/spreadsheet-risk-management-within-uk-organisations-351.htm\n|title= Spreadsheet Risk Management within UK Organisations\n|date=July 2011}}</ref>\n* Spreadsheets have significant reliability problems.

Several factors contribute to this limitation. Implementing a complex model on a cell-at-a-time basis requires tedious attention to detail. Authors have difficulty remembering the meanings of hundreds or thousands of cell addresses that appear in formulas.\n\n::These drawbacks are mitigated by the use of named variables for cell designations, and employing variables in formulas rather than cell locations and cell-by-cell manipulations. Graphs can be used to show instantly how results are changed by changes in parameter values. In fact, the spreadsheet can be made invisible except for a transparent user interface that requests pertinent input from the user, displays results requested by the user, creates reports, and has built-in error traps to prompt correct input.<ref name=Bullen>{{cite book|title=Professional Excel Development |author=Stephen Bullen, Rob Bovey & John Green |publisher=Addison-Wesley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VnegO0pMYlIC&pg=PA1 |isbn=978-0-321-50879-9 |year=2009 |edition=2nd }}</ref>\n\n* Similarly, formulas expressed in terms of cell addresses are hard to keep straight and hard to audit. Research shows that spreadsheet auditors who check numerical results and cell formulas find no more errors than auditors who only check numerical results.<ref name=\"Powell\" /> That is another reason to use named variables and formulas employing named variables.\n\n::Specifically, spreadsheets typically contain many copies of the same formula. When the formula is modified, the user has to change every cell containing that formula. In contrast, most computer languages allow a formula to appear only once in the code, and achieve repetition by means of loops: making them much easier to implement and audit.\n\n* The alteration of a dimension demands major surgery. When rows (or columns) are added to or deleted from a table, one has to adjust the size of many downstream tables that depend on the table being changed. In the process, it is often necessary to move other cells around to make room for the new columns or rows, and to adjust graph data sources. In large spreadsheets, this can be extremely time consuming.<ref name=\"Henrion\">{{cite web|url=http://lumina.com/dlana/papers/Whats%20wrong%20with%20spreadsheets.pdf|title= What's Wrong with Spreadsheets&nbsp;– and How to Fix them with Analytica|accessdate=2010-11-13|author= Max Henrion|date=2004-07-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/orms-2-97/savage.html|title=Weighing the Pros and Cons of Decision Technology in Spreadsheets\n|work=ORMS Today Volume 24 Number 1|accessdate=2010-11-13|author=Sam Savage|date=February 2010}}</ref>\n* Adding or removing a dimension is so difficult, one generally has to start over.

This means that to cause a similar calculation on an array of cells, an almost identical formula (but residing in its own \"output\" cell) must be repeated for each row of the \"input\" array. This differs from a \"formula\" in a conventional computer program, which typically makes one calculation that it applies to all the input in turn.

The name is a play on the phrase \"as easy as 1-2-3\", a reference to the dominant MS-DOS spreadsheet at that time, [[Lotus 1-2-3]] with which it competed for a fraction of the contender's price.<ref name=\"PCMag\"/> The program was sold by Trius, Inc. (not to be confused with Tritus, the makers of the Tritus SPF clone of the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[ISPF]] interface and editor).\n\n== History ==\n\nAs-Easy-As is historically significant as one of the earliest and most useful shareware programs that competed with commercial software on the basis of both price and features. For small businesses and personal users, the price of Lotus 1-2-3 was prohibitive, and As-Easy-As provided basic spreadsheet functionality for about a tenth of the price. This paradigm of undercutting the spreadsheet market leader would be adopted by Borland's [[Quattro Pro]] (which was not released until 1990). Subsequent versions of As Easy As became as powerful as any MS-DOS spreadsheet. Like Quattro Pro, As-Easy-As combined some elements of the 1-2-3 user interface, while modernizing them. (One such modernization is the use of pull-down menus.)\n\nCell formulas are very similar to Lotus 1-2-3, including the letter-number addressing scheme (A1, B2, etc.) and the @function syntax (e.g.,<code>@SUM(A1..A10)</code> using the \"..\" range separator syntax also like Lotus 1-2-3.)\n\nThe product included a detailed electronic manual describing the spreadsheet's functions and some basic MS-DOS operations.\n\nUpdated versions of As-Easy-As were made available at frequent intervals. Because these new versions often included valuable new capabilities, users were encouraged to support the continuing development of the program. The graphic defaults were more attuned to science and engineering users than to business users. This enabled a user to rapidly create x-y graphs of data, whereas the major commercial spreadsheets of the DOS era (Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro) by default produced more business-oriented graphs. Many calculation functions were appealing to the science and engineering markets, such as improved capabilities for [[regression analysis]] and [[matrix operation]]s.\n\n== End of development ==\n{{as of|2004|November|3}}, Trius discontinued the last version of As-Easy-As for DOS, and {{as of|2006|January|10|lc=y}}, the last version of As-Easy-As for Windows, though copies of both program were made available for downloading with free full licenses.<ref name=\"Forum1\"/><ref name=\"Forum2\"/>\n\nThe earliest preserved historical version available on the Internet from the MS-DOS shareware era is version 3 from 1987.

This was not particularly difficult, as [[Informix Corporation|Informix]] had essentially abandoned the Mac version of [[Informix WingZ|WingZ]], and Claris was able to purchase the non-exclusive rights to the [[source code|codebase]]. After changing the interface to conform to their new \"Pro\" line of product's [[GUI]], they released it at the [[MacWorld Expo|MacWorld Expo Boston]] on June 6, 1991 as Resolve.\n\nResolve supports a worksheet size of more than one billion cells and includes 149 built-in functions that allow users to create financial, statistical and mathematical models. Resolve also contains [[object-oriented]], [[MacDraw]]-like drawing tools for combining illustrations, clip art, text, charts and numbers in reports.\n\nResolve failed to gain significant market share due to [[Microsoft Excel]], which also stopped [[Lotus 1-2-3]] becoming popular on the Macintosh. This led to disappointing sales, and in 1993 development was stopped. On 31 March 1994 Claris stopped selling Resolve, the program was supported up until 31 March 1995. Claris suggested existing Resolve users to upgrade to the spreadsheet module of [[ClarisWorks]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-076.html TidBITS#76/12-Aug-91 Claris Resolve introduction information]\n* [http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-216.html TidBITS#216/07-Mar-94 Claris Resolve discontinuation info]\n* [http://www.knubbelmac.de/software/tabellenkalkulation.html#resolve Claris Resolve Information and Screenshots on knubbelmac.de]\n\n[[Category:Mac OS-only software]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]"

It was soon overtaken by [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a more limited integrated software package, but one written in [[assembly language]], yielding much better performance.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[PC Magazine]]'' stated in June 1983 that Context MBA \"still runs too slowly for a person accustomed to the speed of a microcomputer\". It found the [[spreadsheet]] the best [[Application software|application]] of the suite, describing the [[database]] as \"amazingly slow\" and the text editor as \"clumsy and confusing\".

This shared service enables users to load, calculate, and display [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] 2010 workbooks on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010.\n\nUsing '''Excel Services''', users can reuse and share Excel workbooks on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 [[Web portal|portals]] and dashboards. For example, they can create content in Excel 2010 and share it by using an Office SharePoint Server 2007 portal and dashboard. The entire workbook or just parts of it (such as just a single sheet, chart or table) can be shared.\n\n[[End-user]]s can view live, interactive workbooks using only a [[web browser]]. They can also interact with workbooks to explore data, and analyze [[Pivot Table]] reports and charts by using a browser. Excel Services supports workbooks that are connected to external data sources. Users can embed connection strings to external data sources in the workbook or save them centrally in a data connection library file.\n\nSelected cells in worksheets can be made editable by making them named ranges or \"parameters\". Items which are set as \"viewable\", when they save to Excel Services, will appear in the ''Parameters'' pane in the browser. Users can change the values of these named ranges in the parameters pane and refresh the workbook. They can also use the portal's filter [[Web part|Web Part]] to filter several Web Parts (Excel Web Access and other types of [[web part]]s) together.\n\n== References ==\n* Asnash et al. (2007).

Full Impact was known for excellent graphing and visual display, far better than contemporary versions of [[Microsoft Excel]]. But this was also its only really compelling feature, and it was unable to find a market niche given the dominance of Excel in the Macintosh marketplace.\n\n==History==\nFull Impact started in a roundabout fashion when early Apple employee and programmer [[Randy Wigginton]] decided to write a spreadsheet program. Wigginton had left Apple during the Macintosh development process to start [[Encore Systems]] with two friends, Don Breuner and Ed Ruder. They were soon hired by [[Steve Jobs]] to develop a word processor for the soon-to-be-released Macintosh, which would become [[MacWrite]]. Wigginton wanted to duplicate this success by making a [[GUI]]-based spreadsheet that would be easier to use than anything on the market. Unlike a word processor, however, a spreadsheet requires a complex \"engine\" to quickly solve the many equations that make it up.\n\nStarting in September 1984, shortly after the Mac's release, Wigginton and his two partners started looking for an engine, and were introduced to Richard Ross by an Apple employee. They agreed that Encore would adapt a GUI to Ross's engine, which would become [[MacCalc]]. It was not long before these plans started to fall apart. Ross wanted to retain control the product and sell it through his company, Bravo Technologies, while Wigginton and his partners felt it would be much wiser to license it to a larger company, and that Ross was pushing them out of the decision making. Eventually they decided to look for another partner, and shortly thereafter Wigginton met with several employees of Ashton-Tate and presented a demo of their existing prototype program. Ashton-Tate was interested, and agreed to fund development of the product in exchange for marketing rights.<ref name=rat>[https://openjurist.org/916/f2d/516/ashton-tate-corporation-v-ross Ashton-Tate Corporation v. Ross], Argued and Submitted July 17, 1990. Decided Oct. 4, 1990. OpenJurist</ref>\n\nThey used the prototype GUI created for [[MacCalc]] along with a new engine, Alembic, (written by Queue Associates) and almost completely rewritten by Les Vogel to create the '''Glass''' project, also known as '''Pegasus'''. This [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] should have allowed the product to ship fairly quickly. Instead, Ashton-Tate vacillated between being extremely interested in the Macintosh market, considering it a way to break out of their [[dBASE]]-dominated PC line, and then being completely ambivalent about it. This vacillation appears to have been based largely on Mac sales reports; when sales were up the Mac was Ashton-Tate's next big thing, when sales dropped it wasn't worth bothering with. When interested, Encore's development funds would arrive on time &ndash; when they weren't, the money would disappear for months. The Encore team was repeatedly forced to take on other projects in order to pay the bills, stretching what should have been a short project into a several-year ordeal.\n\nThen, just when the product was finally ready to ship, Ross decided to sue Ashton-Tate, claiming he had rights to the program. Ross lost the case and today it is considered one of the classic examples of intellectual property rights law.<ref name=rat/> Ross went on to release his version as MacCalc, and gained very positive reviews.<ref>Doug Green, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45 \"Spreadsheet Program Amazingly Speedy\"], ''InfoWorld'', 3 November 1986, pg. 45-47</ref>\n\nWith the lawsuit out of the way, the product finally started shipping in August 1988, with the new name Full Impact. A minor upgrade, 1.1, followed in December. Reviews were generally positive, noting in particular how the system allowed you to have up to eight \"subsheets\" within any document. This feature is common today, but at the time it was considered novel and extremely useful. Full Impact was also one of the first spreadsheets to allow typing data and formulas directly into the cells, a feature that is still fairly poorly implemented today. Reviewers were also pleased with the powerful macro language, which included functionality such WHILE loops. But certainly the most lauded feature was that Full Impact allowed you to include other objects, such as text blocks, charts or pictures, directly on top of the sheets. At the time, most spreadsheets displayed these items in separate views.\n\nAfter the delays, the timing turned out to be particularly bad. Microsoft had recently shipped Excel 3.0, which was off to a strong start. Only shortly after Full Impact was released, [[Informix Wingz]] shipped, and was heavily marketed—including sending their frontman, [[Leonard Nimoy]], around to various Macintosh-related trade shows. Ashton-Tate positioned the product as a \"presentation spreadsheet\" to focus on its graphics capabilities, but it seems the term meant as much to potential customers then as it does today.\n\nSales of Full Impact were predictably soft as a result, as were Ashton-Tate's other Mac products, [[FullWrite Professional]] and [[dBASE Mac]], which suffered from various problems. Ashton-Tate didn't take this as a signal to fix them, and instead ignored all of the products for the next year or so. Finally, in late 1989, a round of upgrades to FullWrite and Full Impact were announced. '''Full Impact 2.0s''' was released in 1990, including [[3-D chart]]s and the ability to include voice notes, a major feature of a coincident release of '''FullWrite 1.5s''' as well. A separate release in 1989 added '''Clear Access''' at $99, a 3rd party database linking technology based on Apple's [[Data Access Language|CL/1]].\n\nBut this was also the point at which Ashton-Tate's [[cash cow]], [[dBASE]], failed. In 1990, they released dBASE IV, which was so buggy that customers generally refused to use it. Many took this as an opportunity to try out similar products, and discovered that [[FoxPro]] and [[Clipper programming language|Clipper]] had been better than dBASE for some time already. The company was soon bleeding money and gave up on the Mac market, ending development of their entire suite.\n\nBy 1991, the company was becoming insolvent and was purchased by [[Borland]] for cents on the dollar. Unfortunately, Borland had their own spreadsheet battling with Excel on Windows, [[Quattro Pro]], and they immediately ended sales of Full Impact. Attempts by the authors to take back the product failed, and it disappeared.\n\n==See also==\n*[[dBASE Mac]]\n*[[FullWrite Professional]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* (''Ross v.

Originally developed for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], it was later distributed on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS/2]], [[NeXTSTEP]] and several other commercial flavors of [[Unix]]. In spite of many positive reviews, including one calling it  \"clearly the spreadsheet of the future\", the market was rapidly entrenching [[Microsoft Excel]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT60&pg=PT60#v=onepage|title=Wingz Carries Spreadsheets to New Heights, By Pat Bensky, InfoWorld Dec. 4 1989}}</ref> Informix eventually gave up on the desktop market and reverted solely to database sales in the mid-1990s. [[Claris]] licensed and sold an extensively cleaned up version as [[Claris Resolve]] in 1991, but it was far too late to market to have any effect.\n\n==History==\nWingz was originally written solely for the Macintosh by Innovative Software in [[Lenexa, KS]] (publishers of the [[SmartWare]] Suite on the PC) and was ready for release in late 1988. Informix wanted to enter the desktop software market with products that could link to their back-end databases, and Wingz seemed like a good fit. They purchased the product and released it largely as-is in early 1989. The release was built up by extensive promotion on the part of Informix, including giving away a then-unprecedented array of \"convention swag,\" including high quality Wingz red canvas tradeshow bags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iiug.org/forums/ids/index.cgi/read/11283|title=International Informix User Group}}</ref> For nearly a year, the buildup was focused around the \"Wingz Time Shuttle,\" an enclosed theatre which traveled MacWorlds in 1988 and 1989. The focal creatives included a video narrated by Leonard Nimoy and automated demos of the product. The video took attendees into \"the future of spreadsheet design, past the legacy of failed old products [like Excel]\".\n\n==Features==\nThe most obvious feature, and the easiest to \"checkbox review\", was the size of the spreadsheets Wingz could process. Excel's maximum size was 256 columns by 16384 rows, while Wingz could handle spreadsheets up to 32768 in both directions. At the time spreadsheets were still being compared primarily on this feature. A less-obvious feature was that Wingz allowed simple in-cell editing, whereas contemporary versions of Excel forced you to use a separate data-entry bar.\n\nAnother clear difference between Wingz and Excel was Wingz' powerful graphing system, once regarded as the most powerful available in any spreadsheet.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT67&pg=PT67#v=onepage|title=Wingz Update Adds Features, Overcomes Earlier Problems, By Michael J. Miller, InfoWorld Nov. 20, 1989}}</ref> Wingz' graphing system allowed the resulting graphs to be placed directly in the spreadsheets. At the time Excel offered an anemic variety of 2D graphs, and they could only be displayed in a separate view. Additionally Wingz made it easy to make the graphs and modify them, allowing you to see your changes in real-time directly in the spreadsheet where the changes were being made. At the time it was an \"obvious\" feature, but one that no other program had managed to make work correctly.\n\nA more hidden feature was HyperScript, a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]-programming language deliberately modelled on [[HyperCard]]'s [[HyperTalk]].<ref>Brian Murphy, et al, [http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/publications/18/BOOK2/B3-15.pdf \"Spreadsheet Statistics for Teaching and Production\"], ICOTS 3, 1990</ref><ref>T. C. O'Haver, [http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/models/Wingz.txt \"Object-Oriented Spreadsheets as a Custom Software Development Environment\"], University of Maryland, 1992</ref> HyperScript allowed even new users to write fairly powerful macros, which could include user-interface features such as buttons and dialog boxes. HyperScript 1.0 was missing some rather obvious features. For instance it could not open another spreadsheet, although it could refer to one if the user opened that for it.\n\nA less hidden \"feature\" was that the program shipped with a number of bugs, which tainted the release. It also lacked a number of mathematical functions that Excel handled internally, and had no direct importer/exporter for Excel files.\n\nMicrosoft responded to the release of Wingz, and others such as [[Ashton-Tate]]'s [[Full Impact]] and the Mac version of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] that came out about the same time, by starting an extensive upgrade to Excel. They were soon showing it around claiming it would have all the features of Wingz &mdash; in-sheet graphics, large spreadsheets, etc. When it was finally released it was true many of these features were supported, but it was not considered user-friendly.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nIt was only a short period of time before a Wingz 1.1 release fixed many of these issues, but it was long enough that the product was never able to regain its momentum. It also seemed that Informix never really understood how to market the product, and it is likely '[[Not Invented Here]]' played a major part in the problems as well &mdash; the purchase of Wingz and Smartware prompted Roger Sippl, one of the founders of Informix, to leave the company.\n\nShortly after Sippl left, Phil White, the new CEO of Informix, announced that Informix would no longer be competing in the desktop application space. Joe Erickson, the lead developer of the Smart Spreadsheet, Wingz, Formula One VBX, Formula One ActiveX, Formula One for Java and [[SpreadsheetGear for .NET]], left shortly after that.\n\nFuture releases focused on bringing the product to new platforms as their GUI's matured, and adding functionality to HyperScript to allow it to directly interact with databases. Soon it was being marketed primarily as a data access tool, and eventually the name Wingz was dropped and the product became '''HyperScript Tools'''. After several years of ignoring it further, it was sold off to Investment Intelligence Systems in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. At some unknown point Wingz was bought by a company in San Jose, CA called [[PDF Solutions]] which now uses Wingz as a private base for their DataPOWER Semiconductor [[yield management]] software packages.\n\n[[Claris]], [[Apple Computer]]'s onetime software arm, licensed Wingz in the early 1990s after Informix lost interest in the Mac market. They updated it slightly with the addition of the Claris-standard UI (toolbars, color palettes, etc.) and released it as '''Resolve''' in 1991. By this time Excel was entrenched, and sales of Resolve were tiny. Claris never released a Resolve-[[MacWrite]]-[[Claris Impact]] bundle, and so were unable to gain a foothold in the high-end market now dominated by [[Microsoft Office]]. They eventually cancelled development in 1993, ending sales in 1994.\n\nClaris did offer an \"Office suite\", composed of MacWrite Pro, Claris Resolve, and MacDraw Pro. Although this suite didn't include a database (e.g., Filemaker Pro) or a dedicated Desktop Presentations application, although MacDraw Pro did provide some such features, they positioned it to compete against MS Office. The ClarisImpact program was released much later than ClarisOffice and was never included as part of the suite.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Microsoft Excel]] – industry standard spreadsheet application\n* [[Numbers (spreadsheet)]] – [[Apple|Apple Inc.]]'s spreadsheet application\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.linuxsoft.cz/en/sw_detail.php?id_item=1323 WingZ] – Linux port\n*[http://www.asa3.org/chemistry/computers_in_chemistry/intro_to_spreadsheets.html WingZ] – introduction to spreadsheets\n\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]\n[[Category:Informix|Wingz]]"

      "text": "A '''logical spreadsheet''' is a [[spreadsheet]] in which [[formula]]s take the form of logical constraints rather than function definitions.\n\nIn traditional [[spreadsheet]] systems, such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], cells are partitioned into \"directly specified\" cells and \"computed\" cells and the formulas used to specify the values of computed cells are \"functional\", i.e. for every combination of values of the directly specified cells, the formulas specify unique values for the computed cells. Logical Spreadsheets relax these restrictions by dispensing with the distinction between directly specified cells and computed cells and generalizing from functional definitions to logical constraints.\n\nAs an illustration of the difference between traditional spreadsheets and logical spreadsheets, consider a simple numerical spreadsheet with three cells a, b, and c. Each cell accepts a single integer as value; and there is a formula stating that the value of the third cell is the sum of the values of the other two cells.\n\nImplemented as a traditional spreadsheet, this spreadsheet would allow the user to enter values into cells a and b, and it would automatically compute cell c. For example, if the user were to type 1 into a and 2 into b, it would compute the value 3 for c.\n\nImplemented as a logical spreadsheet, the user would be able to enter values into any of the cells. The user could type 1 into a and 2 into b, and the spreadsheet would compute the value 3 for c. Alternatively, the user could type 2 into b and 3 into c, and the spreadsheet would compute the value 1 for a. And so forth.\n\nIn this case, the formula is functional, and the function is invertible. In general, the formulas need not be functional and the functions need not be invertible. For example, in this case, we could write formulas involving inequalities and non-invertible functions (such as square root). More generally, we could build spreadsheets with symbolic, rather than numeric data, and write arbitrary logical constraints on this data.\n\n== References ==\n* J.

With IBM's entry into the market, VisiCalc was slow to respond, and when they did, they launched what was essentially a straight port of their existing system in spite of the greatly expanded hardware capabilities. Lotus' solution was marketed as a three-in-one integrated solution, which handled spreadsheet calculations, [[database]] functionality, and graphical charts, hence the name \"1-2-3\", though how much database capability was debatable given Lotus' sparse memory. 1-2-3 quickly overtook VisiCalc, as well as [[Multiplan]] and [[SuperCalc]], two VisiCalc competitors.\n\n1-2-3 was the spreadsheet standard throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, part of an unofficial set of three stand-alone office automation products that included [[dBase]] and [[WordPerfect]], to build a complete business platform. With the acceptance of [[Windows 3.0]], the market for desktop software grew even more. None of the major spreadsheet developers had seriously considered the [[graphical user interface]] to supplement their [[DOS]] offerings, and so they responded slowly to [[Microsoft]]'s own graphical-based products, [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and [[Microsoft Word|Word]]. Lotus was surpassed by Microsoft in the early 1990s and never recovered. [[IBM]] purchased Lotus in 1995 and continued to sell Lotus offerings, only officially ending sales in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last=Power |author-first=D.

Compared to earlier programs, VisiCalc allowed one to easily construct free-form calculation systems for practically any purpose, the limitations being primarily memory and speed related. The application was so compelling that there were numerous stories of people buying Apple II machines to run the program.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last1=McMullen |author-first1=Barbara E. |author-last2=McMullen |author-first2=John F. |title=Apple Charts the Course for IBM |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |date=1984-02-21 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=122–129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCIvSU6Y2GAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA120 |access-date=2015-01-11}}</ref> VisiCalc's runaway success on the Apple led to direct [[bug compatible]] ports to other platforms, including the [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Commodore PET]] and many others. This included the [[IBM PC]] when it launched in 1981, where it quickly became another best-seller, with an estimated 300,000 sales in the first six months on the market.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThere were well known problems with VisiCalc, and several competitors appeared to address some of these issues. One early example was 1980's [[SuperCalc]], which solved the problem of [[circular reference]]s, while a slightly later example was [[Microsoft]] [[Multiplan]] from 1981, which offered larger sheets and other improvements. In spite of these, and others, VisiCalc continued to outsell them all.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n[[File:Lotus-123-3.0-dos.png|thumb|250px|Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3.0 for MS-DOS]]\nThe Lotus Development Corporation was founded by [[Mitchell Kapor]], a friend of the developers of [[VisiCalc]]. 1-2-3 was originally written by [[Jonathan Sachs]], who had written two spreadsheet programs previously while working at Concentric Data Systems, Inc.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory/ |contribution=The History of Notes and Domino |date=2007-11-14 |access-date=2005-12-20 |publisher=[[IBM]] |title=Developer Works}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://purl.umn.edu/107619 |title=Oral history interview with Jonathan Sachs |author-first=Martin |author-last=Campbell-Kelly |date=2004-05-07 |publisher=[[Charles Babbage Institute]], University of Minnesota}}.</ref> To aid its growth, in the UK, and possibly elsewhere, Lotus 1-2-3 was the very first computer software to use television consumer advertising.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVhEPmU8Z6IC&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24 |contribution=[[ComputerWorld]] |page=24 |date=1984-11-26 |publisher=[[ComputerWorld]] |title=Micro Software TV Ads Play to Mixed Review}}</ref>\n\nLotus 1-2-3 was released on 26 January 1983, and immediately overtook Visicalc in sales. Unlike Microsoft [[Multiplan]], it stayed very close to the model of VisiCalc, including the \"A1\" letter and number cell notation, and slash-menu structure.  It was cleanly programmed and relatively bug-free, gained speed from being written completely in [[x86]] [[assembly language]] (this remained the case for all DOS versions until 3.0, when Lotus switched to [[C (programming language)|C]]<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |title=The Executive computer; Lotus 1-2-3 Faces Up to the Upstarts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/13/business/the-executive-computer-lotus-1-2-3-faces-up-to-the-upstarts.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |access-date=2012-10-14 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1988-03-13 |author-first=Peter H. |author-last=Lewis |quote=Release 3.0 is being written in the computer language known as [[C (language)|C]], to provide easy transportability among PCs, Macs and mainframes.}}</ref>) and wrote directly to video memory rather than use the slow DOS and/or BIOS text output functions.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAmong other novelties that Lotus introduced was a graph maker that could display several forms of graphs (including pie charts, bar graphics, or line charts) but required the user to have a graphics card. At this early stage, the only video boards available for the PC were IBM's [[Color/Graphics Adapter]] and [[Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter]] while the latter did not support any graphics. However, because the two video boards used different RAM and port addresses, both could be installed in the same machine and so Lotus took advantage of this by supporting a \"split\" screen mode whereby the user could display the worksheet portion of 1-2-3 on the sharper monochrome video and the graphics on the CGA display.\n\nThe initial release of 1-2-3 supported only three video setups, [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] (in which case the graph maker was not available) or dual monitor mode. However, a few months later support was added for Hercules Computer Technology's [[Hercules Graphics Adapter]] which was a clone of the MDA that allowed bitmap mode. The ability to have high-resolution text and graphics capabilities (at the expense of color) proved extremely popular and Lotus 1-2-3 is credited with popularizing the Hercules graphics card.\n\nSubsequent releases of Lotus 1-2-3 supported more video standards as time went on, including EGA, AT&T/Olivetti, and VGA. Significantly, support for the PCjr/Tandy modes was never added and users of those machines were limited to CGA graphics.\n\nThe early versions of 1-2-3 also had a key disk copy protection. While the program was hard disk installable, the user had to insert the original floppy disk when starting 1-2-3 up. This protection scheme was easily cracked and a minor inconvenience for home users, but proved a serious nuisance in an office setting. Starting with Release 3.0, Lotus no longer used copy protection. However, it was then necessary to \"initialize\" the System disk with one's name and company name so as to customize the copy of the program.  Release 2.2 and higher had this requirement.  This was an irreversible process unless one had made an exact copy of the original disk so as to be able to change names to transfer the program to someone else.\n\nThe reliance on the specific hardware of the IBM PC led to 1-2-3 being utilized as one of the two [[stress testing (software)|stress test]] applications, along with [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]], for true 100% compatibility when [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] appeared in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"springer19850603\">{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA72 |title=Tandy's Magnificent Concession |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1985-06-03 |access-date=2014-07-19 |author-last=Springer |author-first=P.

Noting that computer purchasers did not want PC compatibility as much as compatibility with certain PC software, the magazine suggested \"let's tell it like it is.

Instead, let's say '1-2-3 compatible.'\"<ref name=\"clapp19840227\">{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA15&pg=PA22 |title=PC compatibility |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1984-02-27 |access-date=2015-01-18 |author-last=Clapp |author-first=Doug |pages=22}}</ref> PC clones' advertising did often prominently state that they were compatible with 1-2-3.{{r|trivette198504}} An Apple II software company promised that its spreadsheet had \"the power of 1-2-3\".<ref name=\"incider198612\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/inCider_86-12#page/n176/mode/1up |title=VIP Professional |work=inCider |date=December 1986 |access-date=2015-02-04 |type=advertisement |pages=171}}</ref> Because spreadsheets use large amounts of memory, 1‐2‐3 helped popularize greater RAM capacities in PCs, and especially the advent of [[expanded memory]], which allowed greater than 640k to be accessed.\n\n=== Rivals ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\nLotus 1-2-3 inspired imitators, the first of which was Mosaic Software's \"The Twin\", written in the fall of 1985 largely in the [[C language]], followed by VP-Planner, which was backed by [[Adam Osborne]]. These were able to not only read 1-2-3 files, but also execute many or most macro programs by incorporating the same command structure. Copyright law had first been understood to only cover the source code of a program.  After the success of lawsuits which claimed that the very \"[[look and feel]]\" of a program were covered, Lotus sought to ban any program which had a compatible command and menu structure. Program commands had not been considered to be covered before, but the commands of 1-2-3 were embedded in the words of the menu displayed on the screen. 1-2-3 won its case against Mosaic Software. However, when they sued [[Borland]] over its [[Quattro Pro]] spreadsheet in [[Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.|Lotus v. Borland]], the courts ruled that it was not a copyright violation to merely have a compatible command menu or language. In 1995, the First Circuit found that command menus are an uncopyrightable \"method of operation\" under section 102(b) of the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. The 1-2-3 menu structure (example, slash File Erase) was itself an advanced version of single letter menus introduced in [[VisiCalc]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nMicrosoft's early spreadsheet Multiplan eventually gave way to [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], which debuted on the Macintosh in 1985. It arrived on PCs with the release of Windows 2.x in 1987, but as Windows was not yet popular, it posed no serious threat to Lotus' stranglehold on spreadsheet sales.  However, Lotus suffered technical setbacks in this period.  Version 3 of Lotus 1-2-3, fully converted from its original macro assembler to the more portable C language, was delayed by more than a year as the totally new 1-2-3 had to be made portable across platforms and fully compatible with existing macro sets and file formats.  The inability to fit the larger code size of compiled C into lower-powered machines forced the company to split its spreadsheet offerings, with 1-2-3 release 3 only for higher-end machines, and a new version 2.2, based on the 2.01 assembler code base, available for PCs without extended memory. By the time these versions were released in 1989, Microsoft had eroded much of Lotus' market share.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Windows grew in popularity and along with it Excel, which gradually displaced Lotus from its leading position. A planned total revamp of 1-2-3 for Windows fell apart and all that the company could manage was a Windows adaptation of their existing spreadsheet with no changes except using a graphical interface. Additionally, several versions of 1-2-3 had different features and slightly different interfaces.\n\n1-2-3's intended successor, [[Lotus Symphony for DOS|Lotus Symphony]], was Lotus' entry into the anticipated \"[[integrated software]]\" market.  It intended to expand the rudimentary all-in-one 1-2-3 into a fully-fledged spreadsheet, graph, database and word processor for DOS, but none of the integrated packages ever really succeeded.  1-2-3 migrated to the Windows platform, as part of [[Lotus SmartSuite]].\n\nIBM's continued development and marketing of [[Lotus SmartSuite]] and [[OS/2]] during the 1990s placed it in direct competition with [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], respectively. As a result, Microsoft \"punished the IBM PC Company with higher prices, a late license for [[Windows 95]], and the withholding of technical and marketing support.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/Full+text+of+Judge+Jacksons+findings+of+fact+-+page+23/2009-1001_3-232571-23.html |title=Full text of Judge Jackson's findings of fact |publisher=[[CNet]] |date=January 2007 |at=Section 116}}</ref> IBM wasn't granted [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] rights for Windows 95 until 15 minutes prior to the release of Windows 95, 24 August 1995.

IBM stated, \"Customers will no longer be able to receive support for these offerings after 30 September 2014. No service extensions will be offered.

Along with being a spreadsheet, it also offered integral charting/graphing and rudimentary database operations.\n\nData features included sorting data in any defined rectangle, by order of information in one or two columns in the rectangular area. Justifying text in a range into paragraphs allowed it to be used as a primitive word processor.\n\nIt had keyboard-driven pop-up menus as well as one-key commands, making it fast to operate. It was also user-friendly, introducing an early instance of [[context-sensitive help]] accessed by the F1 key.\n\n[[Macro (computer science)|Macros]] in version one and add-ins (introduced in version 2.0) contributed much to 1-2-3's popularity, allowing dozens of outside vendors to sell macro packages and add-ins ranging from dedicated financial worksheets like [[F9 Financial Reporting|F9]] to full-fledged [[word processor]]s.  In the single-tasking [[MS-DOS]], 1-2-3 was sometimes used as a complete office suite. All major graphics standards were supported; initially CGA and Hercules, and later EGA, AT&T, and VGA. Early versions used the [[filename extension]] \"WKS\".<ref>{{Citation |title=File info |url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/wks |contribution=WKS File Extension – Open .WKS files}}.</ref> In version 2.0, the extension changed first to \"WK1\",<ref>{{Citation |title=File info |url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/wk1 |contribution=WK1 File Extension – Open .WK1 files}}.</ref> then \"WK2\".<ref>{{Citation |title = File info |url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/wk2 |contribution=WK2 File Extension – Open .WK2 files}}.</ref> This later became \"WK3\" for version 3.0<ref>{{Citation |title=File info |url = http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/wk3 |contribution=WK3 File Extension – Open .WK3 files}}.</ref> and \"WK4\" for version 4.0.<ref>{{Citation |title=File info |url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/wk4 |contribution=WK4 File Extension – Open .WK4 files}}.</ref>\n\nVersion 2 introduced macros with syntax and commands similar in complexity to an advanced [[BASIC]] interpreter, as well as string variable expressions. Later versions supported multiple worksheets and were written in [[C (programming language)|C]].  The charting/graphing routines were written in [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] by [[Jeremy Sagan]] (son of [[Carl Sagan]]) and the printing routines by Paul Funk (founder of [[Funk Software]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n== {{anchor|WKS|WK1|WJ1|WK2|WJ2|WK3|WJ3|WK4|WJ4|WK5|123}}PC version history ==\n\n=== DOS ===\n\n==== {{anchor|1|1A|2|2J|2.01|2.1J|2.1J+|2.2|2.2J|2.3|2.3J|2.4|2.4J|2.5J}}Real Mode (8088+) ====\nThese editions of 1-2-3 for DOS were primarily written in [[x86 assembly language]].\n* Release 1 was the first release for DOS-based PCs.

Borland Int'l, Inc.|volume=516|page=233|pin=|year=1996}}.</ref> is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case that tested the extent of [[software copyright]].  The lower court had held that copyright does not extend to the [[user interface]] of a [[computer program]], such as the text and layout of menus. Due to the recusal of one justice, the Supreme Court decided the case with an eight-member bench that split evenly, leaving the lower court's decision affirmed but setting no national precedent.\n\n==Background information==\n[[Borland]] released a [[spreadsheet]] product, [[Quattro Pro]], that had a compatibility mode in which its [[menu (computing)|menu]] imitated that of [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a competing product.  None of the [[source code]] or [[machine code]] that generated the menus was copied, but the names of the commands and the organization of those commands into a hierarchy were virtually identical.<ref name=\"arstech ovg\"/>\n\nQuattro Pro also contained a feature called \"Key Reader\", which allowed it to execute Lotus 1-2-3 keyboard [[Macro (computer science)|macros]].  In order to support this feature, Quattro Pro's code contained a copy of Lotus's menu hierarchy in which each command was represented by its first letter instead of its entire name.\n\nBorland CEO [[Philippe Kahn]] took the case to the software development community arguing that Lotus's position would stifle innovation and damage the future of software development. The vast majority of the software development community supported Borland's position.\n\n==District Court case==\n[[Lotus Software|Lotus]] filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] on July 2, 1990, claiming that the structure of the menus was [[copyright]]ed by Lotus.  The [[United States district court|district court]] ruled that Borland had [[copyright infringement|infringed]] Lotus's copyright.  The ruling was based in part on the fact that an alternative satisfactory menu structure could be designed.  For example, the \"Quit\" command could be changed to \"Exit\".<ref>''Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.'', 831 F.Supp. 202 (D.Mass.1993)</ref>\n\nBorland immediately removed the Lotus-based menu system from Quattro Pro, but retained support for its \"Key Reader\" feature, and Lotus filed a supplemental claim against this feature.  A district court held that this also constituted copyright infringement.\n\n==Circuit Court case==\nBorland appealed the decision of the district court arguing that the menu hierarchy is a \"method of operation\", which is not copyrightable according to [[Title 17 of the United States Code|17 U.S.C.]] § 102(b).\n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] reversed the district court's decision, agreeing with Borland's legal theory that considered the menu hierarchy a \"method of operation\". The court agreed with the district court that an alternative menu hierarchy could be devised, but argued that despite this, the menu hierarchy is an uncopyrightable \"method of operation\".<ref>''Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.'', 49 F.3d 807, 815 (1st Cir. 1995)</ref><blockquote>We hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is an uncopyrightable “method of operation.” The Lotus menu command hierarchy provides the means by which users control and operate Lotus 1–2–3. If users wish to copy material, for example, they use the “Copy” command. If users wish to print material, they use the “Print” command. Users must use the command terms to tell the computer what to do. Without the menu command hierarchy, users would not be able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus 1–2–3's functional capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/831/202/1802132/|title=Justia: Lotus Development Corp. v. Borland Intern., Inc., 831 F. Supp. 202 (D. Mass. 1993)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>The court made an analogy between the menu hierarchy and the arrangement of buttons on a [[video cassette recorder|VCR]].  The buttons are used to control the playback of a video tape, just as the menu commands are used to control the operations of Lotus 1-2-3.  Since the buttons are essential to operating the VCR, their layout cannot be copyrighted.  Likewise, the menu commands, including the textual labels and the hierarchical layout, are essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>''Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.'', 49 F.3d 807, 817 (1st Cir. 1995)</ref>\n\nThe court also considered the impact of their decision on users of software.  If menu hierarchies were copyrightable, users would be required to learn how to perform the same operation in a different way for every program, which the court finds \"absurd\".  Additionally, all macros would have to be re-written for each different program, which places an undue burden on users.<ref>''Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.'', 49 F.3d 807, 818 (1st Cir. 1995)</ref>\n\n===Concurring opinion===\n[[Michael Boudin]] wrote a [[concurring opinion]] for this case.  In this opinion, he discusses the costs and benefits of copyright protection, as well as the potential similarity of software copyright protection to [[patent]] protection.  He argues that software is different from creative works, which makes it difficult to apply copyright law to software.\n\nHis opinion also considers the theory that Borland's use of the Lotus menu is \"privileged\".  That is, because Borland copied the menu for a legitimate purpose of compatibility, its use should be allowed.  This decision, if issued by the majority of the court, would have been narrower in scope than the \"method of operations\" decision.  Copying a menu hierarchy would be allowed in some circumstances, and disallowed in others.<ref>''Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.'', 49 F.3d 807, 819-21 (1st Cir. 1995) (Boudin, J., concurring)</ref>\n\n==Supreme Court case==\nLotus petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] for a [[writ of certiorari]]. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's judgment due to an evenly divided court, with Justice Stevens [[recusal|recusing]].<ref name=SCOTUS/> Lotus's petition for a rehearing by the full court was denied. By the time the lawsuit ended, Borland had sold Quattro Pro to [[Novell]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] spreadsheet had emerged as the main challenger to Lotus 1-2-3.\n\n==Impact==\nThe ''Lotus'' decision establishes a distinction in copyright law between the [[interface (computer science)|interface]] of a software product and its implementation. The implementation is subject to copyright. The public interface may also be subject to copyright to the extent that it contains expression (for example, the appearance of an [[icon (computing)|icon]]). However, the set of available operations and the mechanics of how they are activated are not copyrightable.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1200&context=chtlj |title=Lotus v.

Development was put on hiatus in 1994 after slow sales on the Windows platform, and officially ended in April 1996 after Lotus was purchased by [[IBM]].\n\nImprov was an attempt to redefine the way a spreadsheet program should work, to make it easier to build new spreadsheets and to modify existing ones. Conventional spreadsheets used on-screen cells to store all data, formulas, and notes. Improv separated these concepts and used the cells only for input and output data. Formulas, macros and other objects existed outside the cells, to simplify editing and reduce errors. Improv used named ranges for all formulas, as opposed to cell addresses.\n\nAlthough not a commercial success in comparison to mainstream products like [[Lotus 1-2-3]] or [[Microsoft Excel]], Improv found a strong following in certain niche markets, notably [[financial modeling]].  It was very influential within these special markets, and spawned a number of clones on different platforms, notably [[Lighthouse Design]]'s [https://quantrix.com/ Quantrix], which has since been spun off into its own company.\n\n[[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Numbers (spreadsheet)|Numbers]] combines a formula and naming system similar to Improv's, but running within a conventional spreadsheet.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe original spreadsheets were pieces of paper with vertical and horizontal lines on them, a customized [[worksheet]] intended for [[Accountancy|accounting]] uses. Users would enter data into rectangular areas on the sheets, known as cells, then apply formulas to the data to produce output values that were written down in other cells. A Berkeley professor, [[Richard Mattessich]], was a proponent of using spreadsheets for financial modeling and \"what if\" calculations for businesses, but noted that it could take so long to recalculate it to run a different scenario that the inputs would be out of date by the time the calculation was finished. In 1964 he proposed using a computer to run all of the calculations from the point of the change on, thereby updating the sheet in seconds, rather than days.{{sfn|Jelen|2005|p=6}}\n\nTeaching the use of spreadsheet modelling was common in [[business school]]s, often using [[chalkboard]]s marked up with a layout similar to the paper versions. Using a chalkboard made it easier to fix errors, and allowed the sheet to be shared with a class. In 1979 [[Daniel Bricklin]] was using such a device when he decided to attempt to computerize it on the newly introduced [[personal computer]]s. Joined by [[Bob Frankston]], the two created the first spreadsheet, [[VisiCalc]], and released it on the [[Apple II]] computer in 1979. When [[Benjamin M. Rosen|Ben Rosen]] of [[Morgan Stanley]] saw the program, he wrote that \"VisiCalc might be the software tail that wagged the computer industry dog.\"{{sfn|Jelen|2005|p=12}}\n\nVisiCalc was an enormous success, so much so that a huge number of clones appeared. One of these was written by a former VisiCalc programmer, [[Mitch Kapor]]. His version, [[Lotus 1-2-3]], would go on to be an even greater success than VisiCalc, in no small part due to the fact that it ran on, and was tuned for, the new [[IBM PC]].{{sfn|Jelen|2005|p=16}}  Lotus 1-2-3 shipped 60,000 copies in the first month,{{sfn|Jelen|2005|p=16}} and Lotus was soon one of the largest software companies in the world.\n\n===ATG===\nLotus set up an advanced technology group in 1986.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}}  One of their initial tasks was to see if they could simplify the task of setting up a spreadsheet. Completed spreadsheets were easy to use, but many users found it difficult to imagine what the sheet needed to look like in order to get started creating it. Should data be entered down columns, or across rows? Should intermediate values be stored within the sheet, or on a separate one? How much room will we need?{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}}\n\n[[Pito Salas]], a developer at ATG, decided to attack this problem.<ref group=N>Garfinkel and Jelen appear to disagree on Salas' role in ATG. Garfinkel implies that he simply worked at ATG, while Jelen seems to imply he set it up. See Garfinkel, p. 34 and Jelen, p. 28.</ref> After a few months of studying existing real-world examples, it became clear that the data, views of that data, and the formulas that acted on that data were very separate concepts. Yet in every case, the existing spreadsheet programs required the user to type all of these items into the same (typically single) sheet's cells.\n\nThis overlap of functionality led to considerable confusion, because it's not obvious which cells hold what sort of data. Is this cell an input value that is used elsewhere? Is it an intermediate value used for a calculation? Perhaps it is an output value from a calculation? There's no way to know. This insight led to ideas for a new spreadsheet that would cleanly separate these concepts &mdash; data, formulas, and output views that would combine data and formulas in a format suitable for the end user. At the same time, the new product would allow users to group data \"by purpose\", giving it a name instead of referring to it by its position in the sheet. This meant that moving the data on the sheet would have no effect on calculation.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}}\n\nSalas also noted that it was the views of output data that was often the weakest part of existing spreadsheets. Since the input, calculations and output were all mixed on a sheet, changing the layout could lead to serious problems if data moved. With the data and formulas separated, this was no longer an issue. Salas demonstrated that this separation meant that a number of common tasks that required lengthy calculations on existing spreadsheets could be handled almost for free simply by changing the view. For instance, if a spreadsheet contained a list of monthly sales, it was not uncommon to have an output column that summed up the sales by month. But if one wanted that summed by year, this would normally require another formula column and a different output sheet.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}}\n\n===Back Bay===\nBy the end of the summer of 1986, Salas had created a [[slideshow]]-like demonstration of a system known as Modeler on the [[IBM PC]]. In February 1987 he hired Glenn Edelson to implement a working version in [[C++]]. As they worked on the project, it became clear that the basic concept was a good one, and was especially useful for financial modeling. At the end of the spring, they hired Bonnie Sullivan to write up a project specification, and Jeff Anderholm was hired to examine the market for a new program aimed at the financials industry. That summer, the team took Modeler to a number of financials companies, and found an overwhelmingly positive reception.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}}\n\nA year later, in September 1988, the team was finally given the go-ahead to start implementing Modeler. After examining a number of platforms, including [[DOS]] and the [[Macintosh OS]], the team decided the target platform would be [[OS/2]], at that time considered to be an up-and-coming system in the commercial space. The project was given the [[code name]] \"Back Bay\" after a location in [[Boston, MA]], and a mascot was selected, Fluffy Bunny.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}}\n\nThe next month, in October 1988, [[Steve Jobs]] visited Lotus to show them the new [[NeXT]] computer. When he saw Back Bay he immediately got excited and started pressing for it to be developed on the NeXT platform. The Lotus team was equally excited about NeXT, but continued work on the OS/2 platform.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=34}} This proved to be much more difficult than imagined; at the time, OS/2 was very buggy, and their [[Presentation Manager]] UI was in its infancy. Development was not proceeding well.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=35}}\n\n===NeXT release===\n\nAfter struggling with OS/2 for months, in February 1989 they decided to move it to NeXT. When Jobs learned of the decision he sent an enormous bouquet of flowers to the team. More importantly, he also sent Bruce Blumberg, one of NeXT's software experts, to teach the Lotus team about NeXTSTEP. One worrying problem turned out to be an enormous advantage in practice; as the back-end was written in C++ and the front-end in [[Objective-C]], it turned out to be very easy to segregate the program and track down bugs. Additionally, NeXT's [[Interface Builder]] let the team experiment with different UIs at a rate that was not possible on other platforms, and the system evolved rapidly during this period.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=35}}\n\nReturning for a visit in April 1989, Jobs took the team to task about their categorization system. He demanded a way to directly manipulate the categories and data on-screen, rather than using menus or separate windows. This led to one of Improv's most noted features, the category \"tiles\", icons that allowed output sheets to be re-arranged in seconds. Jobs remained a supporter throughout, and constantly drove the team to improve the product in many ways. Blumberg remained on-call to help with technical issues, which became serious as NeXT was in the process of releasing NeXTSTEP 2.0, the first major update to the system.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=35}}{{sfn|Garfinkel|1991|p=79}}\n\nImprov for NeXT was released in February 1991, resulting in \"truckloads\" of flowers from Jobs. The program was an immediate hit, receiving praise and excellent reviews from major computer publications,<ref>Michael Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LjwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT73 \"Lotus Improv Spreadsheet for The Next System Offers Some Unique, Helpful Advantages\"], ''InfoWorld'', 15 October 1990, p. 86</ref> and, unusually, mainstream business magazines as well.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-gQAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88 \"Spreading Out\"], ''CIO'', December 1990, p. 88</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hOYXAQAAIAAJ], ''Newsweek'', Volume 122, p. 94</ref> Earlier predictions that Improv might be NeXT's [[killer app]] proved true,<ref>MacUser referred to it this way in 1991, see</ref> and thousands of machines would eventually be sold into the financials market, initially just to run Improv. This gave NeXT a foothold in this market that lasted into the late 1990s, even after their purchase by [[Apple Inc.]]<ref>Karen Logsdon, [http://www.kevra.org/TheBestOfNext/ThirdPartyProducts/ThirdPartyHardware/NeXTSTEPonNonNeXTComputers/IntelHardwareForNeXTStep/NeXTSTEPonHewlettPackard/HP-NeXT-PressReleases/page658/page658.html \"NEXTSTEP on HP Workstations and Servers Targets Financial Services Industry\"], NeXT Inc., 25 May 1993</ref>\n\n===Windows release===\n\nAfter release on NeXT (a version known as \"Black Marlin\") attempts were made to port to Windows (\"Blue Marlin\") and Macintosh (\"Red Marlin\"). The APIs and programming language for NeXTSTEP were so different from [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] [[system software]] that porting was very difficult. '''Lotus Improv for Windows v2.0''' (there was no 1.0) shipped in May 1993, running on Windows 3.1. Like the NeXT release, the Windows version also garnered critical praise,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vypUfjzMwlAC&pg=PA42 \"New Dimensions in Number Crunching\"], ''Popular Science'', August 1993, p. 42</ref><ref>Christie Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70 \"Improv for Windows 2.0; Viewing, pruning, structuring options make it truly dynamic\"], ''InfoWorld'', 24 January 1994, p. 70</ref> with [[Byte Magazine]] noting its \"usability is outstanding\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rhgQAQAAMAAJ \"Improv for Windows\"], ''Byte'', 1993, from \"Software reviews on file\"</ref>\n\nIn spite of the positive reviews, sales on Windows were slow. In March 1994, Lotus decided to attack this problem by re-positioning Improv as an add-in for 1-2-3, although the programs had nothing in common other than Improv's ability to read data in 1-2-3 files.<ref>Doug Barney, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BjsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 \"Lotus' Improv to get new role, lower price\"], ''InfoWorld'', 14 March 1994, p. 10</ref> This had no effect on the sales, and after the release of the minor 2.1 upgrade, development ended in August 1994.<ref>Bob Congdon, [http://bobcongdon.net/blog/2004/09/lotus-improv/ \"Lotus Improv\"], 21 September 2004</ref> The project was left in limbo until April 1996 when the product was officially killed, shortly after [[IBM]] purchased Lotus.<ref>Simsom Garfinkel, [http://simson.net/clips/99.Globe.02-18.Copyrights_and_wrongs+.shtml \"Copyrights and wrongs\"], ''The Boston Globe'', 18 February 1999</ref>\n\n===After Improv===\n\nImprov's disappointing sales and eventual cancellation on the PC platform has been used as a case study in numerous post-failure analyses of the software market. Sales on the [[NeXT]] platform could be explained by NeXTs limited marketshare, but the failure on the PC was another issue. Among the favored explanations are the fact that, unlike the release on NeXT, the Windows version faced strong internal resistance from 1-2-3, and [[corporate immune response]] became an issue. Lotus' sales and marketing teams, well versed in selling 1-2-3, did not know how to sell Improv into the market, so they simply didn't, selling the well known and understood 1-2-3. Other explanations include the fact that [[Microsoft Excel]] was being offered as part of the [[Microsoft Office|Office]] bundle at marginal rates that were tiny in comparison, as well as several mis-steps during introduction, like the lack of a macro language or undo. [[Joel Spolsky]] blames it on the design itself, claiming it was too perfectly aimed at a specific market and lacked the generality that Excel featured.<ref>Joel Spolsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vPvhzDqZlaAC&pg=PA25 \"The best software writing\"], Apress, 2005, p. 25</ref>\n\nAlthough Improv disappeared in the 1990s, the program is fondly recalled in the industry<ref>Michael O'Malley, [http://moosevalley.solidwebhost.com/mooses_review_page_lotus_improv.html \"Moose's Greatest Products of All Time : Lotus Improv\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330195352/http://moosevalley.solidwebhost.com/mooses_review_page_lotus_improv.html |date=2012-03-30 }}, 4 February 2002</ref> and continues to be mentioned in books on Excel.<ref>Dan Gookin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vYLpq4BtVREC&pg=PA227 \"Power Excel and Word\"], [[John Wiley & Sons]], 2004, p. 227</ref> When Improv disappeared a number of clones of Improv quickly appeared. Notable among these was [[Lighthouse Design]]'s [https://quantrix.com/ Quantrix], an almost direct clone aimed at the financial market. Quantrix almost suffered the same fate as Improv when the company was purchased by [[Sun Microsystems]] and (eventually) turned into a developer of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications. Quantrix was instead spun off, and continues to be sold as Quantrix Modeler.<ref>[https://quantrix.com/products/quantrix-modeler/ Quantrix Modeler Page]</ref>\n\n==Concepts==\n\nThe core of what would become Improv was to separate the concepts of data, views of the data, and formulas into three portions.{{sfn|Abraham|Burnett|Erwig|2009|p=4}} The spreadsheet itself would contain only input data. Instead of referring to the data as, in effect, \"the data that happens to be in these cells\", each set of data in the sheet was given a name, and could then be grouped into categories. Formulas were typed into a separate section, and referred to data through their range, not their physical position in the sheets. Views of the data, some of which looked like spreadsheets, others like charts, could be created dynamically and were not limited in number.\n\nTo illustrate the difference between Improv and other systems, consider the simple task of calculating the total sales for a product, given unit sales per month and unit prices. In a conventional spreadsheet the unit price would be typed into one set of cells, say the \"A\" column, and the sales into another, say \"B\". The user would then type a formula into \"C\" that said \"A1 times B1\" (typically in a form such as <code>@times(A:1, B:1)</code> or <code>=A1*B1</code>). Then that formula must be copied into all of the cells in column C, making sure to change the reference to A1 to a new reference for A2, etc. The sheet can automate this to some degree, but the real problem is that it simply has no idea what the formula means. Any changes to the layout of the spreadsheet will often make the entire sheet stop working properly.\n\nIn Improv, one simply enters the data into columns called \"Unit Price\" and \"Unit Sales\". A formula can then be created that says \"Total Sales = Unit Price times Unit Sales\". Then if \"Total Sales\" view is added to the workbook, the totals would automatically appear there, because the sheet \"knows\" that is what the formula is for.\n\nBut the real power of Improv did not become clear until work had already started on the project. With the grouping system you could collect monthly sales into groups like \"1995\" and \"1996\", and call the category \"years\". Then the unit prices could be grouped in terms of the product type, say \"clothing\" and \"food\". Now by dragging these groups around (represented by small tabs) the view may be quickly changed. This concept has later been implemented in the form of [[pivot table]]s in several products.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spreadsheet 2000]] further separated data and formulas, representing both graphically on-screen\n* [[Javelin Software|Javelin]], a multi-dimensional spreadsheet/modeling program which may have influenced the design of Improv\n* [https://quantrix.com/ Quantrix], a multi-dimensional business modelling and analytics software based on Improv\n* [http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/gap/user-apps/FlexiSheet/?root=gap Flexisheet] an opensource clone for [[GNUstep]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite journal |first=Simson |last=Garfinkel |url=http://www.simson.net/clips/1991/91.NW.Improv.html |title=Improv: The Inside Story |journal=NEXTWORLD |date=Fall 1991 |pages=33–35, 79 |ref=harv}}\n:* (PDF version available [http://simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NeXTWORLD_1991.pdf here])\n* {{cite book |first=Bill |last=Jelen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAWt82Cg2RQC |title=The Spreadsheet at 25, The Evolution of the Invention that Changed the World |publisher=Holy Macro! |date=May 2005 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite techreport |first1=Robin |last1=Abraham |first2=Margaret |last2=Burnett|author2-link=Margaret Burnett |first3=Martin |last3=Erwig |url=http://eusesconsortium.org/pubs/searchable/sheets.pdf |title=Spreadsheet Programming |publisher=EUSES Consortium |date=16 March 2009 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.zisman.ca/Articles/1993/Improv.html A review from 1993]\n{{Lotus Software}}\n\n[[Category:Lotus Software software|Improv]]\n[[Category:NeXTSTEP software]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]"

It was released by [[Lotus Development]] as a follow-on to its popular [[spreadsheet]] program, [[Lotus 1-2-3]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MdBP83DW6g4C&pg=RA1-PA66#v=onepage Lotus advertisement], ''Computerworld'', July 16, 1984, pg. 66-67</ref> and was produced from 1984-1992. [[Lotus Jazz]] on the Apple [[Macintosh]] was a sibling product.\n\n[[IBM]] revived the name [[IBM Lotus Symphony|Lotus Symphony]] in 2007 for a new office suite based on [[OpenOffice.org]], but the two programs are otherwise unrelated.\n\n==History==\nLotus 1-2-3 had originally been billed as an integrated product with spreadsheet, database and graphing functions (hence the name \"1-2-3\"). Other products described as \"integrated\", such as [[Ashton-Tate]]'s [[Framework (office suite)|Framework]] and [[AppleWorks]], from [[Apple Computer]], normally included [[word processor]] functionality. Symphony was Lotus' response.\n\n==Overview==\nSymphony for MS-DOS is a program that loads entirely into memory on startup, and can run as an MS-DOS task on versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] (3.x/95/98/ME). Using the Command Prompt, and a .pif file, Symphony can also be used on Windows XP and its successors.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nUsing ALT+F10 the user can alternate among the five \"environments\" of the program, each a rendering of the same underlying data. The environments are:\n*SHEET, a spreadsheet program very similar to 1-2-3\n*DOC, a word processor\n*GRAPH, a graphical charting program\n*FORM, a table-based [[database management system]]\n*COMM, a [[communication software|communications program]]\n\nSeveral \"add-in applications\" can be \"attached\" and activated, extending Symphony's capabilities, including a powerful macro manager, a document outliner, a spell-checker, statistics, various communications configurations, and a tutorial, which demonstrates Symphony usage by running macros. The program allows the screen to be split into panes and distinct Windows, showing different views of the underlying data simultaneously, each of which can display any of the five environments. The user is then able to see that changes made in one environment are reflected in others simultaneously, perhaps the package's most interesting feature.\n\nAll the data that Symphony handles is kept in spreadsheet-like cells. The other environments—word processing, database, communications, graphics—in essence only change the display format and focus of that data (including available menus, special keys, and functionality), which can be saved and retrieved as .WR1 files.\n\nSymphony was designed to work completely in the standard 640k of conventional memory, supplemented by any [[expanded memory]]. Similar and competitive packages included [[SmartWare]], [[Microsoft Works]], [[Context MBA]], [[Framework (office suite)|Framework]], [[Enable Software, Inc.|Enable]] and [[Ability Office]].\n\nSymphony's spreadsheet engine was similar to, but not the same as the one used in Lotus 1-2-3, once the most popular of its kind. Additional enhancements included:\n\n*The ability to create unique application looking spreadsheets using customizable macro driven menus and display Windows.  The result being menu driven applications that, to the user, resembled little of their original spreadsheet heritage.\n*A rearranged worksheet menu, placing COPY as the first menu item, then the other most frequently used items after that.\n*Additional @ formula functions building on 1-2-3's spreadsheet only formulas.\n*Multiple menu systems, retaining 1-2-3's uniquely identified first-character menu items.\n*The addition of the TAB key to anchor ranges, instead of just using the period key.\n*The ability to copy \"to a location\" and end up at that location, instead of at the copy \"from location.\"\n\nSymphony put the power of the spreadsheet at the user's fingertips and used all of the available keys on [http://www.pcguide.com/ref/kb/layout/stdAT84-c.html IBM's 84-key PC keyboard]. In this way, the user could use both hands to select menu functions, navigate menus and spreadsheets, as well as, all other Symphony functions by touch. The introduction of the 104-key keyboard and later ergonomic keyboards diluted this advantage.\n\nCompared to other word processors of the day such as [[Micropro]] [[WordStar]] 3.3, [[WordPerfect]] 4.2, and [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]] 2.0, Symphony's word processing environment was simple, but effective and uncomplicated.\n\nCompared to other database programs of the day—[[Ashton-Tate]]'s [[dBase]] III, MDBS [[Knowledgeman]], Borland [[Paradox (database)|Paradox]] 2.0 and [[Borland Reflex]] 1.0—Symphony's FORM environment was not as robust, lacking the analytical abilities of Reflex and the pseudo relational power of dBase III. However, it was integrated directly into the spreadsheet and included the ability to \"generate\" a FORM from spreadsheet fields.  The generator would automatically create the database input form, all the underlying spreadsheet architecture, with range names and query fields, turning a simple spreadsheet into an instant database in seconds.  3.0-Symphony extended earlier enhancements with additional add-ons, most notably:\n\n*WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) GUI (graphical user interface) and the addition of mouse support\n*BASE, the ability to integrate with any dBase IV file, no matter its size.\n*ExtraK add-on, extending memory capabilities for spreadsheet larger than 4MB.\n\nLike its predecessor Lotus 1-2-3, Symphony contained a reasonably powerful [[programming language]] referred to as its \"Symphony Command Language (or SCL) \", which could be saved either within a spreadsheet or separately in \"libraries\" in the form of ''macros'': lists of menu operations, data, and other macro keywords. (One is \"menucall,\" which allows users to call their own menus, embedded into spreadsheets, which behave just like Symphony's own.) Symphony's \"learn\" mode for macro recording automated this process, helping the end-user to quickly write macros to duplicate repetitive tasks or to go beyond that, without the need to understand computer programming. One of the most significant features of Symphony was the integration of the various modules using this command language. In its day, it was one of the few programs that would be able to log onto a stock market source, select data using dynamic or pre-assigned criteria, place that data into a spreadsheet, perform calculations, then chart the data and print out the results. All of this could take place unattended on a preset schedule.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set]] (LMBCS)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.techrepublic.com/pictures/dinosaur-sightings-lotus-symphony-30/1/ Dinosaur Sightings: Lotus Symphony 3.0] (for DOS) by Greg Shultz, TechRepublic\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Lotus Software}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lotus Symphony (Dos)}}\n[[Category:1984 software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n[[Category:Lotus Software software|Symphony]]\n[[Category:Office suites]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]"

Known initially by the [[List of computer technology code names|code name]] \"EP\" (for \"Electronic Paper\"), it was introduced in 1982 as a competitor for [[VisiCalc]].\n\nMultiplan was released first for [[computers]] running [[CP/M]]; it was developed using a [[Microsoft]] proprietary [[p-code machine|p-code]] C compiler<ref name=\"brodie\"/> as part of a [[Porting|portability]] strategy that facilitated ports to systems such as [[MS-DOS]], [[Xenix]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]], [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]] (on four 6K GROMs and a single 8K ROM), [[TRS-80 Model II|Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II]], [[TRS-80 Model 4]], [[TRS-80 Model 100]] (on ROM), [[Apple II]], and Burroughs B-20 series. The CP/M version was also runnable on the TRS-80 Model II and 4, [[Commodore 128]], and Apple II with a CP/M card. In France, Multiplan was also released for the [[Thomson computers]] in 1986.\n\nDespite the release of [[Microsoft Chart]], a graphics companion program, Multiplan continued to be outsold by [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. It was replaced by [[Microsoft Excel]], which followed some years later on both the [[Apple Macintosh]] (1985) and [[Microsoft Windows]] (1987).\n\nAlthough over a million copies were sold, Multiplan was not able to mount an effective challenge to Lotus 1-2-3. According to [[Bill Gates]], this was due to the excessive number of ports (there were approximately 100 different versions of Multiplan). He also believed that it was a mistake to release 8-bit versions instead of focusing on the newer 16-bit machines and as a result, \"We decided to let [Lotus] have the character-based DOS market while we would instead focus on the next generation--graphical software on the Macintosh and Windows.\"\n\nAround 1983, during the development of the [[Windows 1.0|first release of Windows]], Microsoft had plans to make a [[Windows]] version. However the plans changed a year later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nA version was available for the [[Apple Lisa]] 2 running [[Microsoft]]/[[Santa Cruz Operation|SCO]] [[Xenix]] 3.

It is a commercial [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[free software|free]]/[[Open-source software|open source]] [[OpenOffice.org]] that implements most of the features of OpenOffice.org, including a [[word processor]], [[spreadsheet]], [[presentation program]], and [[Graphics software|graphics program]], and adds some features not present in the macOS versions of [[LibreOffice]] and [[Apache OpenOffice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NeoOffice features|url=http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/features.php|website=neooffice.org|publisher=Planasema Inc.|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> Current versions are based on LibreOffice 4.4.\n\n== History ==\nVersions of [[OpenOffice.org]] for Mac prior to 3.0 did not have a native Mac OS X interface; they required either [[X11.app]] or [[XDarwin]] to be installed.\n\nNeoOffice was the first OpenOffice.org fork to offer a native [[Mac OS X]] experience, with easier installation, better integration into the Mac OS X interface (pull-down menus at the top of the screen and familiar keyboard shortcuts, for example), use of Mac OS X's fonts and printing services without additional configuration, and integration with the Mac OS X clipboard and drag-and-drop functions. Subsequently, both [[LibreOffice]] and [[Apache OpenOffice]] followed NeoOffice's lead and implemented similarly native Mac OS X  versions.\n\nNeoOffice began as a project to investigate methods of creating a native port of OpenOffice.org to Mac OS X. The project now called NeoOffice was originally dubbed \"NeoOffice/J\", reflecting its use of Mac OS X's Java integration to enable a native application. A related project was NeoOffice/C, which was a simultaneous effort to develop a version using Apple's [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] APIs. But NeoOffice/C proved very difficult to implement and the application was highly unstable, so the project was set aside in favor of the more promising NeoOffice/J. The \"/J\" suffix was dropped with version 1.2, since there was no longer another variety of NeoOffice from which to distinguish it. Many of these releases were preceded by a version that only Early Access Members could download; these versions were released about a month before the official release date.\n\nAll versions from NeoOffice 3.1.1 to NeoOffice 2015 were based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.1, though latter versions included stability fixes from LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trinity.neooffice.org/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&p=64520#64520|title=Mac App Store complaints|date=7 November 2013|author=Pluby|publisher=trinity.neooffice.org|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> NeoOffice 2017 and later versions are fully based on LibreOffice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trinity.neooffice.org/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&p=65212#65212|title=NeoOffice 2017 Beta Professional Edition released|date=2 May 2017|author=Pluby|publisher=trinity.neooffice.org|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 NeoOffice moved to a commercial distribution model via the [[Mac App Store]].

The [[iPad]] version was released on 27 January 2010.<ref name=\"ipad\">{{cite web|title=Apple - iPad - Innovative spreadsheets in just a few taps|url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/features/numbers.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> The app was later updated to support [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]].\n\nNumbers uses a free-form \"canvas\" approach that demotes tables to one of many different media types placed on a page. Other media, like charts, graphics and text, are treated as peers. In comparison, traditional spreadsheets like [[Microsoft Excel]] use the table as the primary container, with other media placed within the table. Numbers also includes features from the seminal [[Lotus Improv]], notably the use of formulas based on ranges rather than cells. However, it implements these using traditional spreadsheet concepts, as opposed to Improv's use of multidimensional databases.\n\nNumbers also includes numerous stylistic improvements in an effort to improve the visual appearance of spreadsheets. At its introductory demonstration, [[Steve Jobs]] pitched a more usable interface and better control over the appearance and presentation of tables of data.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Basic model===\nNumbers works in a fashion somewhat different from traditional spreadsheets like [[Microsoft Excel]] or [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. In the traditional model, the table is the first-class citizen of the system, acting as both the primary interface for work, as well as the container for other types of media like [[chart]]s or [[digital image]]s. In effect, the spreadsheet and the table are one and the same. In contrast, Numbers uses a separate \"canvas\" as its basic container object, and tables are among the many objects that can be placed within the canvas.<ref name=canvas>[https://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/#spreadsheet \"Numbers, uncrunched.\"], Apple Inc.</ref><ref group=\"N\">For reasons that are not mentioned in the documentation, canvases are referred to as \"sheets\" within the program.</ref>\n\nThis difference is not simply a case of syntax. In order to provide a large workspace, conventional spreadsheets extend a table in X and Y to form a very large grid - ideally infinite, but normally limited to some smaller dimension.<ref group=\"N\">Numbers can handle up to 65,535 rows by 256 columns per table, versus the latest versions of [[Microsoft Excel#Number of rows and columns|Excel from Office 2010 onwards]] having a maximum of 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. Excel has changed its maximum size many times, originally 16,384 rows by 128 columns, while other programs of the same era often compared themselves by increasing this, e.g. [[Informix Wingz|WingZ]] was 32,768 by 32,768 for instance.</ref> Some of these cells, selected by the user, hold data. Data is manipulated using formulas, which are placed in other cells in the same sheet and output their results back into the formula cell's display. The rest of the sheet is \"sparse\", currently unused.<ref>Josef Stoer and Roland Bulirsch, \"Introduction to Numerical Analysis (3rd ed.)\", Springer-Verlag, 2002, p. 610</ref>\n\nSheets often grow very complex with input data, intermediate values from formulas and output areas, separated by blank areas. In order to manage this complexity, Excel allows one to hide data that is not of interest,<ref>David Ringstrom, [http://www.accountingweb.com/topic/technology/tricks-hiding-and-unhiding-excel-rows-and-columns \"Tricks for hiding and unhiding Excel rows and columns\"], accounting web, April 17, 2009</ref> often intermediate values. [[Quattro Pro]] commonly introduced the idea of multiple sheets in a single book, allowing further subdivision of the data; Excel implements this as a set of tabs along the bottom of the workbook.\n\nIn contrast, Numbers does not have an underlying spreadsheet in the traditional sense, but uses multiple individual tables for this purpose.<ref name=canvas/> Tables are an X and Y collection of cells, like a sheet, but extend only to the limits of the data they hold. Each section of data, or output from formulas, can be combined into an existing table, or placed into a new table. Tables can be collected by the user onto single or multiple canvases. Whereas a typical Excel sheet has data strewn across it, a Numbers canvas could build the same output through smaller individual tables encompassing the same data.<ref>Hugo Jobling, [http://www.trustedreviews.com/Apple-iWork--09_Software_review_iwork-09-numbers_Page-3#tr-review-summary \"Apple iWork '09\"], Trusted Reviews, February 19, 2009, p. 3</ref>\n\n===Formulas and functions===\n[[File:Numbers new untitled document.png|thumb|right|A newly created Numbers document is styled to indicate suggested header areas in column A and row 1. Note that the table stops in the lower right of the screen, which can be resized with the widget in the corner.]]\n[[File:Numbers with named range formula.png|thumb|right|After adding data and headers, Numbers has automatically created named ranges over the data. The ranges were used to create a formula that has populated column D. Note that the same formula can be used for the entire column - the row number is not required.]]\n[[File:Numbers document with chart.png|thumb|right|The table has been resized to show only the used area, moved into the center of the canvas, and styled. A chart has been added above the table. The pane in the upper left shows an object tree, with the \"canvas\" objects being shown in a hierarchy of each sheet, every sheet can be collapsed or expanded to show the canvas object contained within that sheet.]]\n\nConsider a simple spreadsheet being used to calculate the average value of all car sales in a month for a given year. The sheet might contain the month number or name in column A, the number of cars sold in column B, and the total income in column C. The user wishes to complete the task of \"calculate the average income per car sold by dividing the total income by the number of cars sold, and put the resulting average in column D\". From the user's perspective, the values in the cells have semantic content, they are \"cars sold\" and \"total income\", and they want to manipulate this to produce an output value, \"average price\".\n\nIn traditional spreadsheets, the semantic value of the numbers is lost. The number in cell B2 is not \"the number of cars sold in the month of January\", but simply \"the value in cell B2\". The formula for calculating the average is based on the manipulation of the cells, in the form <code>=C2/B2</code>. As the spreadsheet is unaware of the user's desire for D to be an output column, the user copies that formula into all of the cells in D. However, as the formula refers to data on different rows, it must be modified as it is copied into the cells in D, changing it to refer to the correct row. For instance, the formula in D4 would read <code>=C4/B4</code>. Excel automates this later task by using a relative referencing system that works as long as the cells retain their location relative to the formula. However, this system requires Excel to track any changes to the layout of the sheet and adjust the formulas, a process that is far from foolproof.<ref>Paul McFedries, [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=328639&seqNum=4 \"Copying and Moving Formulas\"], Building Basic Formulas in Excel, August 27, 2004</ref>\n\nDuring the development of [[Lotus Improv|Improv]], the Lotus team discovered that these sorts of formulas were both difficult to use, and resistant to future changes in the spreadsheet layout.<ref>Simson Garfinkel, [http://www.simson.net/clips/1991/91.NW.Improv.html \"Improv: The Inside Story\"], ''NEXTWORLD'', Fall 1991, p. 34</ref> Their solution was to make the user explicitly define the semantic content of the sheets - that the B column contained \"cars sold\". These data ranges were known as \"categories\". Formulas were written by referring to these categories by name, creating a new category that could be (if desired) placed in the sheet for display. Using the car example, the formula in Improv would be <code>average per car = total income / cars sold</code>. Changes to the layout of the sheet would not affect the formulas; the data remains defined no matter where it is moved. It also meant that formulas calculating intermediate values did not have to be placed in the sheet and normally did not take up room. The downside to Improv's approach is that it demanded more information from the user up-front, and was considered less suitable for \"quick and dirty\" calculations or basic list building.<ref>Joel Spolsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vPvhzDqZlaAC&pg=PA25 \"The best software writing\"], Apress, 2005, p. 25</ref>\n\nNumbers uses a hybrid approach to the creation of formulas, supporting the use of named data like Improv, but implementing them in-sheet like Excel. In basic operation, Numbers can be used just like Excel; data can be typed anywhere and formulas can be created by referring to the data by its cell. However, if the user types a header into the table, something one normally does as a matter of course, Numbers uses this to automatically construct a named range for the cells on that row or column. For instance, if the user types \"month\" into A1, and then types the names \"January\", \"February\", ''etc.'' into the cells below it, Numbers constructs a named range for the cells A2 through A13 and gives it the name \"month\". The same is true when the user types in the figures for \"sales\" and \"income\". The user can then write the averaging formula in a category-like text format, <code>= total income / cars sold</code>. The formula will find the appropriate data and calculate the results independent of the row.<ref name=formula>[https://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/#formulas \"Formulas for everyone\"], Apple Inc.</ref> Like Improv, this formula does not refer to the physical location of the data in the sheet, so the sheet can be dramatically modified without causing the formula to fail.<ref name=formula/>\n\nSimilar to Improv, formulas can be represented as icons in Numbers, allowing them to be dragged about the sheets. One noteworthy example of this is a sidebar which contains the sum, average and other basic calculations for the current selection in the active table. These serve a function similar to the sum that appears at the bottom of the window in Excel. However, the user can drag one of the function icons from the sidebar into the sheet to make the calculation appear in that location.<ref name=formula/> In another nod to Improv, the Formula List shows all of the formulas in the spreadsheet in a separate area, and allows edits in place or easy navigation to their use in the sheets.\n\nNumbers '09 contains 262 built-in functions that can be used in formulas.<ref>[https://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/functions.html \"250+ Functions\"], Apple Inc.</ref> This contrasts with Excel 2007's 338 functions.<ref>[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-functions-alphabetical-list-HA010277524.aspx?CTT=3 \"Excel functions (alphabetical list)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830233033/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-functions-alphabetical-list-HA010277524.aspx?CTT=3 |date=August 30, 2011 }}, Microsoft</ref> Many of the functions in Numbers are identical to those in Excel; missing ones tend to be related to statistics, although this area was greatly improved in Numbers '09.<ref name=macworld/>\n\nNumbers '09 includes a system for categorizing data similar to [[pivot table]]s. Pivots were introduced in Improv and were manipulated by dragging the category headers,<ref name=macworld/> allowing the user to quickly rotate rows into columns or vice versa. Although Numbers has similar draggable objects representing formulas, they are not used for this feature and the direct manipulation is missing. Instead, Numbers places pop-up menus in the column headers allowing the user to collapse multiple rows into totals (sums, averages, etc.) based on data that is common across rows. This is similar functionality to a pivot table, but lacks the ease of re-arrangement of the Improv model and other advanced features. Numbers 5.2, released on September 17, 2018,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207244|title=What’s new in Numbers for Mac|work=Apple Support|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-CA}}</ref> further improves on these features by adding Smart Categories, allowing the user to \"[https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT209054 quickly organize and summarize tables to gain new insights]\".\n\n===Layout and display===\nAs Numbers uses the canvas as the basis for the document, media is not tied to the tables; one could build a Numbers canvas with a collection of photographs and no tables. In typical use, one or more tables are placed on the canvas and sized and styled to show only the data of interest. Charts and labels are commonly positioned around the tables. Other media, like photographs or illustrations, can be added as well.<ref name=tables>[https://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/#tables \"Intelligent tables\"], Apple Inc.</ref> Numbers' display-centric model has been referred to as a \"page layout and presentation app disguised as a spreadsheet app\".<ref>[http://2aday.wordpress.com/2007/08/23/iwork-08-review-numbers-spreadsheet-layout-app/ \"iWork ’08 Review: NUMBERS – Spreadsheet Layout App\"], Two A Day, August 23, 2007</ref>\n\nLike other products in the [[iWork]] suite, Numbers includes a variety of styles and layouts designed by professional illustrators. Opening an Excel sheet in Numbers results in a display with smooth fonts, and clean layout and color selections. These can then be modified, optionally using one of the supplied templates, and saved out to Excel format again with these styles intact. Numbers also allows sheets to be [[email]]ed in Excel format in a single step, or shared through Numbers for iCloud.\n\n===Supported hardware===\nNumbers supports hardware keyboards such as Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for iPad. Arrow keys and hotkeys are supported.\n\n==Reception==\nNumbers has been well received in the press, notably for its text-based formulas, clean looks and ease-of-use.<ref>Phil Windley, [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/a-first-look-at-apples-numbers-spreadsheet/5919 \"A First Look at Apple's Numbers spreadsheet\"], ZDNet, August 9, 2007</ref><ref>Rob Griffiths, [http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/software/1139/apple-numbers-08-spreadsheet-software/ \"Apple Numbers '08 spreadsheet software\"], PC Advisor, August 21, 2007</ref><ref>Tiffany Maleshefski, [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Apple-iWork-08-Provides-Simple-But-Solid-Spreadsheet-App/ \"Apple iWork 08 Provides Simple But Solid Spreadsheet App\"], eWeek, August 17, 2007</ref> [[Macworld]] has given it high marks, especially newer versions, awarding Numbers '09 four mice out of five.

A tool that could help the user recognize these patterns would help to build advanced data models quickly. With Improv, users could define and store sets of categories, then change views by dragging category names with the mouse. This core functionality would provide the model for pivot tables.\n\n[[Lotus Software|Lotus Development]] released Improv in 1991 on the [[NeXT]] platform.

A pivot table can help quickly summarize the data and highlight the desired information.  The usage of a pivot table is extremely broad and depends on the situation.  The first question to ask is, \"What am I seeking?\" In the example here, let us ask, \"How many ''Units'' did we sell in each ''Region'' for every ''Ship Date?''\":\n\n[[File:pivottable-Pivoted.PNG]]\n\nA pivot table usually consists of ''row'', ''column'' and ''data'' (or ''fact'') fields.  In this case, the column is ''Ship Date'', the row is ''Region'' and the data we would like to see is (sum of) ''Units''.  These fields allow several kinds of [[aggregate function|aggregations]], including: sum, average, [[standard deviation]], count, etc.  In this case, the total number of units shipped is displayed here using a ''sum'' aggregation.\n\n==Implementation==\nUsing the example above, software will find all distinct values for ''Region''. In this case, they are: ''North'', ''South'', ''East'', ''West''. Furthermore, it will find all distinct values for ''Ship Date''. Based on the aggregation type, ''sum'', it will summarize the fact, the quantities of ''Unit'', and display them in a multidimensional chart.  In the example above, the first datum is 66.  This number was obtained by finding all records where both ''Region'' was ''East'' and ''Ship Date'' was ''1/31/2005'', and adding the ''Units'' of that collection of records (''i.e.'', cells E2 to E7) together to get a final result.\n\nPivot tables are not created automatically. For example, in Microsoft Excel one must first select the entire data in the original table and then go to the Insert tab and select \"Pivot Table\" (or \"Pivot Chart\"). The user then has the option of either inserting the pivot table into an existing sheet or creating a new sheet to house the pivot table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktopschool.com/make-an-excel-pivot-table-in-2-steps/|website=The Desktop School|title=Make an Excel Pivot Table in 2 Steps|accessdate=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141907/http://desktopschool.com/make-an-excel-pivot-table-in-2-steps/#|archive-date=2015-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> A pivot table field list is provided to the user which lists all the column headers present in the data. For instance, if a table represents sales data of a company, it might include Date of sale, Sales person, Item sold, Color of item, Units sold, Per unit price, and Total price. This makes the data more readily accessible.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Date of sale !! Sales person !! Item sold !! Color of item !! Units sold !! Per unit price !! Total price\n|-\n| 10/01/13 || Jones || Notebook || Black || 8 || 25000 || 200000\n|-\n| 10/02/13 || Prince || Laptop || Red || 4 || 35000 || 140000\n|-\n| 10/03/13 || George || Mouse || Red || 6 || 850 || 5100\n|-\n| 10/04/13 || Larry || Notebook || White || 10 || 27000 || 270000\n|-\n| 10/05/13 || Jones || Mouse || Black || 4 || 700 || 3200\n|}\n\nThe fields that would be created will be visible on the right hand side of the worksheet. By default, the pivot table layout design will appear below this list.\n\nEach of the fields from the list can be dragged on to this layout, which has four options :\n# Report filter\n# Column labels\n# Row labels\n# Summation values\n\n===Report filter===\nReport filter is used to apply a filter to an entire table. For example, if the \"Color of Item\" field is dragged to this area, then the table constructed will have a report filter inserted above the table. This report filter will have drop-down options (Black, Red, and White in the example above). When an option is chosen from this [[drop-down list]] (\"Black\" in this example), then the table that would be visible will contain only the data from those rows that have the \"Color of Item = Black\".\n\n===Column labels===\nColumn labels are used to apply a filter to one or more columns that have to be shown in the pivot table. For instance if the \"Sales person\" field is dragged to this area, then the table constructed will have values from the column \"Sales Person\", ''i.e.'', one will have number of columns equal to the number of \"Sales person\". There will also be one added column of Total. In the example above, this instruction will create five columns in the table&nbsp;— one for each sales person, and Grand Total. There will be a filter above the data&nbsp;— column labels&nbsp;— from which one can select or deselect a particular sales person for the pivot table.\n\nThis table will not have any numerical values as no numerical field is selected but when it is selected, the values will automatically get updated in the column of \"Grand total\".\n\n===Row labels===\nRow labels are used to apply a filter to one or more rows that have to be shown in the pivot table. For instance if the \"Sales person\" field is dragged on this area then the other output table constructed will have values from the column \"Sales person\", ''i.e.'', one will have number of rows equal to the number of \"Sales Person\". There will also be one added row of \"Grand Total\". In the example above, this instruction will create five rows in the table&nbsp;— one for each sales person, and Grand Total. There will be a filter above the data&nbsp;— row labels&nbsp;— from which one can select or deselect a particular sales person for the Pivot table.\n\nThis table will not have any numerical values, as no numerical field is selected, but when it is selected, the values will automatically get updated in the Row of \"Grand Total\".\n\n===Summation values===\nThis usually takes a field that has numerical values that can be used for different types of calculations. However, using text values would also not be wrong; instead of Sum it will give a count. So, in the example above, if the \"Units sold\" field is dragged to this area along with row label of \"Sales person\", then the instruction will add a new column, \"Sum of units sold\", which will have values against each sales person.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Row labels !! Sum of units sold\n|-\n| Jones|| 12\n|-\n| Prince ||4\n|-\n|George\n|6\n|-\n|Larry\n|10\n|-\n| Grand total || 32\n|}\n\n== Application support ==\nPivot tables or pivot functionality are an integral part of many [[List of spreadsheet software|spreadsheet applications]] and some [[database software]], as well as being found in other data visualization tools and [[business intelligence]] packages.\n\n; Spreadsheets\n* [[Microsoft Excel]] supports PivotTables, which can be visualized through PivotCharts.<ref name=\"Dalgleish2007\">{{cite book |last1=Dalgleish |first1=Debra |title=Beginning PivotTables in Excel 2007: From Novice to Professional |date=2007 |publisher=Apress |isbn=9781430204336 |pages=233-257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lleBg-leOhwC&pg=PA233&dq=%22Pivot+chart%22+-wikipedia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1jZWA08XdAhUsCDQIHeMBC0cQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Pivot%20chart%22%20-wikipedia&f=false |accessdate=18 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[LibreOffice Calc]] supports pivot tables.

The issue with pivoting in such cases is usually that the number of output columns must be known at the time the query starts to execute; for pivoting this is not possible as the number of columns is based on the data itself. Therefore, the names must be [[hard coded]] or the query to be executed must itself be created dynamically (meaning, prior to each use) based upon the data.\n\n;Web applications\n* [[ZK (framework)|ZK]], an Ajax framework, also allows the embedding of pivot tables in Web applications.\n\n;Programming languages and libraries\n* Programming languages and libraries suited to work with tabular data contain functions that allow the creation and manipulation of pivot tables. Python data analysis toolkit [[pandas (software)|pandas]] has the function ''pivot_table'', and the ''xs'' method useful to obtain sections of pivot tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.pivot_table.html|title=Pandas pivot_table}}</ref>\n\n==Online analytical processing==\nExcel pivot tables include the feature to directly query an [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) server for retrieving data instead of getting the data from an Excel spreadsheet. On this configuration a pivot table is a simple client of an OLAP server. Excel's PivotTable not only allows for connecting to Microsoft's Analysis Service, but to any [[XML for Analysis]] (XMLA) OLAP standard-compliant server.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Aggregate function]]\n* [[Business reporting]]\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]\n* [[Comparison of OLAP servers]]\n* [[Contingency table]]\n* [[Data drilling]]\n* [[Data mining]]\n* [[Data visualization]]\n* [[Data warehouse]]\n* [[Drill down]]\n* [[Extract, transform, load]]\n* [[Fold (higher-order function)]]\n* [[OLAP cube]]\n* [[Relational algebra]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''A Complete Guide to PivotTables: A Visual Approach'' ({{ISBN|1-59059-432-0}})&nbsp;([http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/19/2012256 in-depth review at slashdot.org])\n* ''Excel 2007 PivotTables and PivotCharts: Visual blueprint'' ({{ISBN|978-0-470-13231-9}})\n* ''Pivot Table Data Crunching'' (Business Solutions) ({{ISBN|0-7897-3435-4}})\n* ''Beginning Pivot Tables in Excel 2007'' ({{ISBN|1-59059-890-3}})\n\n[[Category:Microsoft Office]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]\n[[Category:Data analysis]]\n[[Category:Infographics]]"

For years Quattro Pro had a comparative advantage, in regard to maximum row and column limits, (allowing a maximum worksheet size of one million rows by 18,276 columns). This avoided the 65,536 row by 256 column spreadsheet limitations inherent to Microsoft Excel (prior to Excel 2007). Even with the maximum row advantage, Quattro Pro has been a distant second to Excel, in regard to the number of sales, since approximately 1996 to the present.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhen version 1.0 was in development, it was codenamed \"Buddha\" since it was meant to \"assume the [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] position\", #1 in the market.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} When the product was launched in 1988, its original name, suggested to Mr. Kahn by Senior VP, Spencer Leyton at a Vietnamese restaurant in Santa Cruz, was '''Quattro''' (the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for \"four\", a play on being one step ahead of \"1-2-3\").{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Borland changed the name to Quattro Pro for its 1990 release.\n\nThe common file extension of Quattro Pro spreadsheet file is .qpw, which it has used since version 9. Quattro Pro versions 7 and 8 used .wb3, version 6 used .wb2, version 5 used .wb1, and DOS versions used .wq2 and .wq1.<ref name=\"file-extensions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.corel.com/content/pdf/wpx4/corel-wordperfect-office-X4-reviewers-guide.pdf |format=PDF|title=Corel WordPerfect Office Reviewer's Guide - Appendix A: Supported File Formats|page=29|publisher=Corel.com|accessdate=2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe original Borland Quattro electronic spreadsheet was a DOS program, the initial development of which was done by three Eastern Europeans, one of whom, Lajos Frank, was later hired by Microsoft.  An article appeared in PC Week in 1985, quoting a maker of spreadsheet templates saying that he was in close contact with Borland, and that Borland was developing a spreadsheet.  At the time, there was absolutely no such development being undertaken by Borland.  After they both read the article,  Philippe Kahn and Spencer Leyton had a casual conversation where they joked, half-way seriously, about perhaps developing a spreadsheet to compete with Lotus Development's 1-2-3.  That led to Mr. Kahn setting an appointment with an agent for some Eastern European software developers, Robert Stein of Andromeda Software, which was also involved with the game ''[[Tetris]]''.  That led to an agreement negotiated by Mr. Leyton and Mr. Stein, providing for the development of the original Quattro.\n\nQuattro was written in [[assembly language]] and [[Turbo C]] principally by [[Adam Bosworth]], Lajos Frank, and Chuck Batterman. It was praised mainly for superior graphics on DOS. Borland acquired a replacement product called \"Surpass\", written in [[Modula-2]]. The main designers and programmers of Surpass were also hired by Borland to turn Surpass into Quattro Pro: Bob Warfield, Dave Anderson, Weikuo Liaw, Bob Richardson and Tod Landis. They joined other Borland programmers including Chuck Batterman, Lajos Frank, Tanj Bennett, Rich Reppert and Roger Schlafly. Bob Warfield later became Vice President of R&D at Borland. All eventually left Borland.\n\nQuattro Pro shipped in the final quarter of 1989. The Borland main office was near the epicenter of the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] and the building was severely damaged when large and heavy air conditioners on the roof of Borland's main building were thrown upward by the quake, and came crashing down upon the [[Glued laminated timber|glulam]] beams running across the top of the building.  The beams were damaged to the point where they required injections of epoxy in order to make them sturdy enough to support the building again.   In addition, the sprinkler system was triggered. The building was closed for months. All the computers were removed, placed on the tennis courts, washed down (acoustic ceilings rained gray mush onto everything when the sprinklers ran) and dried with hair dryers. Those that booted up were put to work. Quattro Pro finished final [[quality assurance]] testing and was sent to manufacturing from those computers running on the tennis courts in the (fortunately) sunny and dry autumn weather.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nSome have claimed that Quattro Pro was the first to use the tabbed notebook metaphor - but another spreadsheet, [[Boeing Calc]], used tabs to multiple sheets, and allowed three-dimensional references before Quattro Pro was on the market. (Boeing Calc was so slow that its multiple sheet capabilities were barely usable.)<ref name=\"boeingcalc\" /><ref name=\"aresluna\" />\n\nQuattro Pro was the subject of a major [[Lotus v. Borland|lawsuit by Lotus against Borland]]. Lotus argued that Quattro could not copy Lotus 1-2-3 menus (it did copy the menus). Borland supplied the 1-2-3 menus as an alternative because keystroke compatibility was needed in order to run [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] in 1-2-3 worksheets. Borland argued that most cars operate the same, but they are not necessarily made the same. So, Lotus could not rationally \"own\" the way its program behaved. The district court ruled in favor of Lotus, but the appellate court ruled that the 1-2-3 menus were functional and not copyrightable. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court which split 4 to 4 ([[Justice Stevens]] recused himself). This left the lower court ruling intact, which was a victory for Borland. However, the broader issue of whether a company can own and protect the way its program behaves remained unresolved.\n\nBy the time the case was resolved, Borland no longer owned Quattro Pro. Borland sold the spreadsheet to [[Novell]] six months before the final decision was handed down.\n\n==Quattro Pro for Windows==\nQuattro Pro began as a [[DOS]] program (like Lotus 1-2-3) but with the growing popularity of Windows from Microsoft, a Windows version of Quattro needed to be written. There was almost nothing from the DOS code that could be moved to the Windows project, so the Quattro Pro for Windows (QPW) was written from scratch.\n\nBoth the QPW and [[Borland Paradox|Paradox]] for Windows codebases (the latter being another Borland database application) were based on Borland's internal pilot project with object oriented UI code for Windows.  This project ran simultaneously with the Borland language group investigating the desirability of a [[C++]] compiler, and the company decided to make a bet on C++. However, the C++ compiler was not ready at first, and OO code for both projects was started in C with OO emulation through macros. As the Borland Turbo C++ compiler became available internally the projects converted to using C++.\n\nCharlie Anderson was put in charge of the project and he soon had [[Istvan Cseri]], [[Weikuo Liaw]], [[Murray Low]], [[Steven Boye]], [[Barry Spencer]], Alan Bush, [[Dave Orton]], [[Bernie Vachon]], [[Anson Lee]], Tod Landis, Gordon Ko and [[Chuck Batterman]] working on the project. Other engineers joined later. Eventually the team numbered nearly 20. The object model was inspired by the [[NeXT]] object model, modified by Mr. Cseri. Mr. Liaw and Mr. Spencer were in charge of the spreadsheet engine (written in assembly language) while Mr. Low wrote a large chunk of the UI.\n\nThe product was internally codenamed \"[[Thor]]\" for the Norse god of Thunder. QPW featured two major innovations. First, it was the first Windows spreadsheet with multiple pages with cells that could be linked together seamlessly, a feature from Quattro Pro which QPW extended. Second, it was the first released Windows program to have an [[attribute menu]] (or [[property pane]]) available by right-clicking on the object. Although this idea was first seen on the [[Xerox Alto]], the idea had not been implemented on a major Windows program. Paradox for Windows shared this feature, and it was shown off by [[Phillipe Kahn]] at a Paradox user conference over a year before QPW was released. Both these ideas became widespread in the software industry.\n\nQPW was one of the first big applications written in C++ on Windows, and it pushed the Borland C++ compiler to the limit. One reason why the Borland C++ Compiler was so good was that it had to compile and link the massive QPW code base successfully.\n\nThe technical risk of the QPW project was immense. The object model was untried and might not have worked for a spreadsheet. The user interface (UI) was new (for Windows programs at least). No one knew if the C++ compiler could generate fast enough code. As it turned out, the program worked. It was fast, it was close in feature set to Lotus 123 and Excel, and the \"right-click for properties\" user design was reasonably understandable.\n\nAt one point, it was hoped that QPW and Paradox for Windows would be able to share a common object model. That proved impossible despite serious thought and design efforts.\n\nQPW was finally released in September 1992. The Quattro Pro marketing team had chosen to bundle both Quattro Pro for DOS and Quattro Pro for Windows in the same box labeled \"WIN-DOS\" at a price of $495. Customers and reviewers expecting a pure Windows application responded with confusion and outrage, believing the product was merely a DOS application with windowing capabilities. Shortly thereafter QPW was re-packaged by itself and priced $129, receiving accolades for Borland's long-delayed pure Windows spreadsheet and its popular price.\n\nEventually it sold well (after the price was slashed to just $49 a copy). Work was started immediately on a new version with a brand new team of engineers led by [[Joe Ammirato]]; including [[Bret Gillis]] and [[Peter Weyzen]]. Borland purchased [[DataPivot]] from [[Brio Technology]] to add a new feature to the program. Colin Glassey came from Brio to help with the integration of that technology.\n\nAfter a year and the merging of the old team and the new team, QPW 5 was released (the reason for the jump in version number had to do with keeping up with the DOS version as well as it looked good). QPW 5 sold well also, though the [[Microsoft Excel]] + Word combination was gaining steam.\n\nWork then started on version 6 (now with [[Steven Boye]] as project lead). Midway through the development of version 6 a strategic decision to work closely with the [[WordPerfect]] word processor was made. It was a direct attempt to push back at the Microsoft Office one-two punch of [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]] and Microsoft Excel. The other big issue with Version 6 was the advent of [[Windows 95]]. This was a significant modification to the Windows operating system with a major change to user interface guidelines.\n\nIn an odd set of events, [[Novell]] purchased both WordPerfect Corporation and the Quattro Pro code base and team of engineers from Borland. Novell was going to try to be a real competitor to Microsoft. Although Version 6 was released and some effort was made to unify the user interface between WordPerfect and QPW, the effort was far from complete.\n\nIn another lawsuit, Novell claims that Microsoft had \"deliberately targeted and destroyed\" its WordPerfect and QuattroPro programs to protect its Windows operating system monopoly. The US Supreme Court refused to halt the antitrust lawsuit in March 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/18soft.html|title=Court Hands Setback to Microsoft|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\n==Novell's exit==\nThe release of Windows 95 in August 1995 was the beginning of the end for Novell and its plans to compete with Microsoft. Not only did Microsoft release a new operating system, but Microsoft also released new versions of Word and Excel to accompany it. Sales of Novell PerfectOffice (and Lotus applications as well) sank to almost nothing while sales of the Microsoft products were huge.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} Within three months, Novell announced they were going to sell their applications to someone (eventually that proved to be [[Corel]]). By mid-1996, Microsoft had 95% of the market for business applications. {{As of|2005}}, Microsoft still dominates the market for Windows business application software,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} although Quattro Pro and WordPerfect, which pre-dated the MS Office 4.2 suite, are still both updated and sold.\n\n== Version history ==\n* 1989: Quattro Pro 1.0\n* 1991: Quattro Pro 2.0\n* 1992: Quattro Pro for Windows 1.0 - (''also in Borland Office for Windows (1993)'')\n* 1993: Quattro Pro for Windows 5.0 - (''also in Borland Office 2.0 for Windows'')\n* 1994: Quattro Pro for Windows 6.0 (''part of Novell PerfectOffice 3.0'')\n* 1996: Quattro Pro 7 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Suite 7'')\n* 1998: Quattro Pro 8 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Suite 8'')\n* 2000: Quattro Pro 9 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office 2000'')\n* 2002: Quattro Pro 10 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office 2002'')\n* 2003: Quattro Pro 11 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office 11'')\n* 2004: Quattro Pro 12 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office 12'')\n* 2006: Quattro Pro X3 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X3'')\n* 2008: Quattro Pro X4 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X4'')\n* 2010: Quattro Pro X5 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X5'')\n* 2012: Quattro Pro X6 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X6'')\n* 2014: Quattro Pro X7 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X7'')\n* 2016: Quattro Pro X8 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X8'')\n* 2018: Quattro Pro X9 (''part of Corel WordPerfect Office X9'')\n\n==See also==\n*[[Seymour I.

It is often used to create forms, reports, documentation, [[desktop publishing]], and in office environments. Typical users are business clients, educational institutions, administrations, architects, and also private users.\n\nRagtime includes the following modules:\n\n* [[Page layout]] (forms, templates etc.)\n* Word processing\n* Image processing\n* Spreadsheets, similar to [[Microsoft Excel]]\n* Formulas and functions which can be used throughout, in text, graphics, and spreadsheets\n* Charts in different types of diagrams\n* Drawings in [[vector graphics]] including lines, polygons, [[Bézier curve]]s and more\n* Slide show (presentation of RagTime documents)\n* Audio/video\n* Buttons (pop-up menus, switches, and more) that can be used within RagTime documents\n\n== Principle ==\nRagTime differs from most other comparable programs or software packages in its strict frame-oriented design: all content is contained within frames on each page. The content can have a fixed position within its frame or, if it is text or a spreadsheet, flow into another frame that is connected to the first frame via a so-called “pipeline”.\n\nRagTime has no different document types for different types of data; all content is stored in a single document type. Thus, a RagTime document not only can contain multiple pages, but also multiple layouts within the same document; e.g. spreadsheets in addition to text and images.\n\nThe RagTime [[filename extension]] is .rtd (''RagTime document''); for templates the extension is .rtt (''RagTime template'').\n\nThe current version is RagTime 6.6.5. It is available for [[OS X]] (10.6-10.14) and Windows ([[Microsoft Windows XP|XP]]/[[Microsoft Windows Vista|Vista]]/[[Microsoft Windows 7|7]]/[[Microsoft Windows 8|8]]/[[Microsoft Windows 10|10]]).<ref>[http://www.ragtime.de/web/en/support/systemvoraussetzungen.html ''System Requirements''] from RagTime.de website</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\n* ''FileTime X'' –&nbsp;allows accessing “[[FileMaker]] Pro” databases from RagTime documents under OS X\n* ''RagTime Connect Pro'' –&nbsp;[[ODBC]] database connection for RagTime 6 (Mac and Windows)\n* ''Johannes'' –&nbsp; print extension for the simple creation of stapled or folded brochures, booklets etc.\n* ''PowerFunctions'' –&nbsp;additional functions for a more effective creation of intelligent documents for exchanging data and for use in mixed Mac/Windows environments\n* ''MetaFormula'' –&nbsp;[[SYLK]]-based extension that allows calculating text as formula\n\n== History ==\nRagTime has been developed since 1985 for the [[Macintosh]] – originally named ''MacFrame'' – and was published in 1986. When released, it already had the present name, which was chosen following the then-available software package [[Lotus Development Corporation|Lotus]] ''Jazz''.<ref>Maschke, pages 5-8 (2002, ''in German'')</ref>\n\nIn the European Macintosh market, RagTime quickly gained a prominent position that continues to this day, even though the market share has decreased. Despite repeated attempts, the program could not gain acceptance in the North American market due to its high cost ($395 in 1990<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=ragtime+software&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs8JG3lpDTAhUM22MKHRReAJAQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=ragtime%20software&f=false|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=1986-08-18|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>). The North American sales office closed in 1991,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeffkirk.online/bio/|title=Bio|website=jeffkirk.online|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> shortly after [[Claris|Claris Corporation]] released [[Clarisworks|ClarisWorks]] which duplicated much of the functionality of RagTime for a lower price.\n\nAfter the manufacturer – first Brüning & Everth, followed by B&E Software and today RagTime.de Development – had focused on the Macintosh only for a very long time, it also released a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version, RagTime 5.0, in 1999. However, the program could not assume great significance against established competitors, especially [[Microsoft Office]].\n\nUntil mid-2006 RagTime was, in addition to the commercial version, also available as a free version (RagTime Solo) for personal use. ''RagTime Solo'' included the same features and performance (except for spelling and [[Syllabification]]) dictionaries), but was not allowed for use in commercial environments.<ref>[http://www.macworld.com/article/1003069/ragtime.html  ''RagTime business DTP software goes Solo, for free''] Peter Cohen in Macworld from Jan 17, 2002 on the Macworld.com website</ref> In other languages RagTime Solo was distributed as ''RagTime Privat''. In a press release from July 5, 2006 RagTime announced the discontinuation of RagTime Solo: “… the ''RagTime Solo'' license conditions were often misinterpreted or deliberately flouted. Therefore we discontinued ''RagTime Solo'', there will be no private version of ''RagTime 6'' anymore.”<ref>[http://www.ragtime.de/viewart.html?id=290&lang_id=en  ''RagTime Privat eingestellt''] RagTime press release from July 5, 2006 on the manufacturer's website (''in German'')</ref>\n\nAfter a successful start of the RagTime 6.0 software, sales edged significantly lower in the following years. Disagreements arose among the shareholders about the continuation of the company, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2007. As a result, the rights to RagTime were taken over by the newly established company RagTime.de Development GmbH, which was responsible for the development. The sales partner RagTime.de Sales GmbH distributed the RagTime products until October 2015.<ref>[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Office-Pakete-RagTime-ist-tot-es-lebe-RagTime-147043.html ''Office-Pakete: RagTime ist tot, es lebe RagTime''] from July 3, 2007 on the Heise online website (''in German'')</ref> Today RagTime.de Development GmbH is also responsible for sales.\n\nThe last level of development is the extensively revamped version RagTime 6.6 of 8 October 2015, which also includes new OS X features (e.g. high-resolution [[Retina Display|“Retina” displays]]) and supports Windows 10.<ref>[http://www.ragtime.de/viewart.html?id=689&lang_id=en  ''The new RagTime 6.6 – the best RagTime ever!''] RagTime press release from 8 October 2015 on the manufacturer's website</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

External programming and automation can be implemented via [[AppleScript]] on a Mac, and via [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]]/COM-[[Application programming interface|API]] (e.g. [[Visual Basic]]) under Windows.\n\nOn a Mac, RagTime provides a comprehensive AppleScript library, for the automation of almost any task, from automatic document creation to the export of PDF documents. RagTime also supports “recordings” by use of the “AppleScript Editor”, which allows recording the interactive RagTime operation as an AppleScript program sequence. AppleScripts can be saved in the RagTime document and called via menu or shortcut keys.\n\nOn Windows, RagTime (since version 6) disposes over an OLE/COM API, which allows automating many RagTime components via external programming. For that purpose there is a type library that installs the available RagTime OLE/COM object catalogue. Programming can be realized in all programming languages supported by Microsoft.\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|last=Maschke|first= Thomas |year=2002| title= Business Publishing mit RagTime 5.6|publisher= Springer|isbn= 978-3540434887}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|www.ragtime.de}}\n\n[[Category:Graphics software]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]\n[[Category:Word processors]]\n[[Category:Office software]]\n[[Category:Desktop publishing software]]"

It had all the features of Lotus 1-2-3, plus it had an ability to connect to IBM mainframes via [[TCP/IP]] and pull data from IBM databases such as [[IBM DB2]] and [[IBM SQL/DS]].<ref>[https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PaF6DefPIRMhuZL_TrY5yw?feat=directlink] S2 help screen shot by David Strom of PC Week</ref> It also had features that allowed for easy visual connection between formulas and their dependencies - those features were later adopted by Lotus 1-2-3 and [[Microsoft Excel]]. S2 was developed almost concurrently with Lotus development of 1-2-3, and matched 1-2-3 feature for feature. The S2 program was used throughout IBM in 1980s and 1990s. In 1986 it caused a legal controversy within IBM because of then current look-and-feel lawsuits between Lotus and other companies, and most importantly because IBM was negotiating a high-profile deal with Lotus to market Lotus 1-2-3.\n\nAccording to a PC WEEK article of 1986<ref>\"IBM has its own Lotus 1-2-3 competitor\", David Strom, PC Week, 1986</ref> and a subsequent one in 2009,<ref>[http://ajaxmar08.sys-con.com/node/1167275 25 years of PC Week]</ref> the sole author of this program was a developer in [[IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center|Thomas Watson Research Center]], Oleg Vishnepolsky. Vishnepolsky developed this program unaware of the brewing deal between IBM and Lotus, and distributed it within IBM community to close to 50,000 users by the time of the controversy. A copy of his program ended up with a reporter of PC Week, who published an article speculating that IBM and Lotus' deal may be coming apart. That article caused a consternation within IBM executive quarters and attorneys.\n\nIBM attorneys and executives in the end decided that the program does not violate the Lotus copyright. Given S2's wide adoption within IBM they decided not to withdraw it from use, and let Vishnepolsky to continue its development. Vishnepolsky however lost interest in further development of S2, moved to another project and later authored TCP/IP for [[OS/2]] and IBM POS terminals. S2 spreadsheet got ported to OS/2 and [[AIX]] by other developers and remained in use through the 90s. Vishnepolsky reportedly said that instead of getting fired from IBM he received an outstanding technical achievement award from IBM CEO [[John Fellows Akers]] in 1992.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barry Appelman]]\n* [[TCP/IP]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Spreadsheets}}\n{{Lotus Software}}\n\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software for Windows]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]\n[[Category:IBM software]]"

      "text": "'''Spreadsheet 2000''' is a discontinued [[spreadsheet]] program for [[Apple Macintosh]] computers, published by [[Casady & Greene]], a distributor of many \"smaller\" Mac releases. It appears to have seen little in terms of sales, and was withdrawn from the market after only a short time. First released in 1993 as '''Let's Keep It Simple Spreadsheet''', officially abbreviated '''Let's KISS''', the product was renamed Spreadsheet 2000 for its 2.0 release in 1997.\n\nSpreadsheet 2000, S2K for short, featured a unique way of building complex spreadsheets from a number of simpler ones containing only input or output data. This contrasts with the traditional spreadsheet model, where inputs, calculations and outputs are all placed into a single sheet and cannot be easily differentiated. For instance, if one wants to add two columns of three numbers, under a normal spreadsheet one would type the two sets of values into columns, say <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>, and then into <tt>C</tt> type the formula <tt>=A1+B1</tt>, which would appear on-screen as the results. The formula is then copied into the other cells in C. A user looking at the sheet would simply see three columns of numbers, and has no way to differentiate which values are the inputs and which the outputs.\n\n [[Image:Spreadsheet 2000 worksheet screenshot.png|thumb|300px| S2K worksheet; three input sheetlettes (blue) are being used to create several outputs (grey). The <tt>Join</tt> operation merges the 2×2 and 1×2 sheets into a single 3×2, while the <tt>A + B</tt> results in a single 2×2 grid by adding the 1×2 grid to both columns of the 2×2.]]\n\nUnder S2K the same task is separated out to make it easier to understand. The user first creates two separate \"sheetlettes\" containing one column each, types the input numbers into them, and then connects the two together with the addition function, represented by an icon. The addition icon also has an output connector, and when this is connected to a third sheetlette, the results of the addition appear there automatically. The user could also connect the output to a sheetlette containing a single cell, in which case the addition function would sum all of the cells and display the single result.\n\nSince every step of a calculation was represented by input and output sheetlettes as well as the operator icons, S2K worksheets could become cluttered. In order to address this, whole groups of sheets and icons could be selected and collapsed into a ''compound operator''. From that point on, the operator worked just like one of S2K's built-in functions, allowing the user to connect inputs and outputs to it as normal.\n\nThe whole idea of S2K was to simplify the construction of simple spreadsheets. While it met that goal, the same features made more complex spreadsheets difficult to work with. For instance, trying to debug a complex formula in Excel simply requires the user to click on the cell and read the formula. The same task in S2K may be difficult, with the formula filling several pages or alternately being built several layers deep (compounds of compounds) so that there ''is'' no single view of the formula. Additionally S2K's own set of built-in functions was rather limited.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}}\n\nS2K was written entirely in [[Prograph]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lotus Improv]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070310153241/http://www.hmug.org/Reviews/Spreadsheets/ Is there life beyond Excel?]\n* [http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.13/13.04/Spreadsheet2000/index.html MacTech article by L.K.I.S.S. 2.0 designer]\n\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]"

[[VisiCalc]] was the first spreadsheet program but its release for the CP/M operating system ran only on the HP-125, Sharp MZ80, and the [[Sony SMC-70]]. SuperCalc was created to fill that void and market opportunity. Alongside [[WordStar]], it was one of the CP/M applications bundled with the [[Osborne 1]] [[portable computer]]. It quickly became popular{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and was ported to [[MS-DOS]] in 1982.\n\nAn improvement over VisiCalc (though using much the same command structure using the slash key), SuperCalc was one of the first spreadsheet programs capable of iteratively solving [[circular reference]]s (cells that depend on each other's results).  It would be over 10 years after the introduction of SuperCalc before this feature was implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]], although in [[Lotus 1-2-3]], manual programming of iterative logic could also be used to solve this issue. According to the SuperCalc product manager, iterative calculations were added when Sorcim changed from [[binary-coded decimal]] to binary math. Since the precision of the two math packages was different, some IF statements resolved differently, and iterative calculations helped solve this problem.<ref>Wally Feigenson's Blog http://feigenson.us/blog/?p=10 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008163633/http://feigenson.us/blog/?p=10 |date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nVersions of SuperCalc were later released for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], for [[IBM PC compatibles|PCs]] running MS-DOS, and, after Sorcim was bought by [[CA Technologies]] (CA) in the mid-1980s, for [[Microsoft Windows]] (under the name '''CA-SuperCalc'''). The MS-DOS versions were more popular with many users than the market-leading Lotus 1-2-3, because it was distributed without copy protection,<ref>{{cite web|title=SuperCalc 4 Is Serious Competition for Lotus 1-2-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zi8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=supercalc+infoworld+review&source=bl&ots=IvW-YVR6jA&sig=rhuvObPZ0Ch3SxQyR_Rv-o__ceQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixsOSI0uHNAhWCMj4KHR4nB1kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=supercalc%20infoworld%20review&f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Infoworld Magazine|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> as well as being priced lower.\n\nBy the release of version 3 in March 1987, a million users were claimed.<ref>[[C+VG]] magazine \"Extra Bits\", issue 65, page 96 http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue065/Pages/CVG06500096.jpg {{Dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref> New versions were published into the early 1990s, after which Microsoft Excel dominated the spreadsheet market.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Supercalc}}\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]\n[[Category:Microcomputer software]]\n[[Category:CP/M software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n[[Category:Presentation software for Windows]]\n[[Category:1980 software]]\n\n\n{{Business-software-stub}}"

The application ran on [[CP/M]], [[TRSDOS]], and later on [[MS-DOS]] computers. T/Maker was originally distributed by [[Lifeboat Associates]] of New York.\n\nT/Maker took a different approach to most other spreadsheets: instead of embedding formulas in each cell, formulas were defined on a per-row and per-column basis in the margins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-01-13/news/8501030428_1_framework-word-processing-spreadsheet |title=Software That`s Truly Easy To Use |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1985-01-13 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n\nAlthough T/Maker was released six months after [[VisiCalc]], it was perhaps{{Vague|date=September 2017}} the first application to provide an 'office' suite approach to data. Tables could be used in databases or spreadsheets and were accessible in 'word' type documents.\n\n==T/Maker company==\nThe T/Maker Company was an early [[personal computer]] software company, formed in 1983 in order to market [[CP/M]] and [[MS-DOS]] programs that had originally been published by 3rd party publishing houses. They expanded into the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] market, releasing the ClickArt line of [[clip art]]. Other products included [[WriteNow]] on the Mac and [[NeXT]] platforms.\n\nIn 1983 T/Maker Company was incorporated in [[Mountain View, California]] by [[Heidi Roizen]] – [[Peter Roizen|Peter]]'s sister and a then-recent [[Stanford University Graduate School of Business]] graduate – who became its CEO.\n\nT/Maker Company went on to publish its own line of integrated applications, and also products by others intended for DOS and Windows computers as well as the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Macintosh, including ClickArt, the fifth software title available for the Mac.\n\nOther notable T/Maker products include Personal Publisher, a consumer-oriented desktop publishing application for the PC (acquired by [[Software Publishing Corporation]] in 1986), SmartBundle, an \"office\" styled bundle of major applications, Vroombooks, a multimedia storybook, and the Macintosh word processor [[WriteNow]], (which it licensed from NeXT in 1985 and ultimately sold to [[WordStar]] in 1992).\n\nHeidi and business partner/chairman Royal Farros purchased T/Maker from Peter in 1986 and continued [[Bootstrapping (finance)|bootstrap]]ping until 1989, when it became [[venture capital]] firm Hummer Winblad Venture Partners’ first venture investment. [[Ann Winblad]] became a director of the company at that time. [[Tim Draper]] of Draper Fisher led the company’s second round in 1993 and also joined the board.\n\nT/Maker was acquired in 1994 by [[Deluxe Corporation]]. Both Heidi and Royal left the company in 1996, Heidi becoming VP of Worldwide Developer Relations at Apple Computer and Royal founding and becoming CEO of an online print shop, [[iPrint.com]].\n\nT/Maker’s remaining products were ultimately acquired by [[Broderbund]], who continues to market and expand the ClickArt line.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.broderbund.com Broderbund official website]\n* [http://roizen.com/peter/ Peter Roizen official website]\n* [http://www.heidi.roizen.com Heidi.roizen.com]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:T Maker}}\n[[Category:CP/M software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet software]]\n[[Category:Proprietary software]]\n[[Category:1979 software]]"

ViewSheet was written by [[Mark Colton]].\n\n==Description==\nViewSheet supports spreadsheets of up to 255 by 255 cells in size.

All BBC Micro screen modes are supported, and the background and foreground colours can be changed by use of <code>Ctrl-S,n,n,0,0,0</code> key sequences.<ref name=\"themicrouser-1\"/>\n\nThe program supports user-defined windows that can display cells from various different parts of the spreadsheet within the same screen. This is useful in lieu of a [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] environment, as it saves the user the inconvenience of moving back and forth around the spreadsheet to view cells which are far apart from each other.\n\nViewSheet supports saving of spreadsheets to both disk and tape and printing to both serial and parallel printers. These operations are performed in ''command mode'', which also allows changing various options such as VDU settings and screen resolution. The program also integrates with Acornsoft's ''View'' word processor, allowing mixing of spreadsheet data and word processor text within the same printout. There's also a built-in facility for generating character-based bar charts.<ref name=\"bbcdocs-1\"/>\n\nCells can be left or right justified and formatted according to a user specified layout. Numeric values are stored internally as five-byte floating point numbers. The ViewSheet file format is documented on page 128 of the supplied user guide,<ref name=\"bbcdocs-1\"/> which also contains an example [[BBC BASIC]] program to print out values from a saved spreadsheet.\n\n''ViewSheet'' takes advantage of a second 6502 processor, which triples the amount of memory available for spreadsheets, assuming the default screen mode is used (mode 3).<ref name=\"bbcdocs-1\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nViewSheet was reviewed by Gordon Taylor in the January 1985 edition of ''A&B computing''\n<ref name=\"taylor1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thermal.demon.co.uk/articles.htm|title=ARTICLES ON COMPUTING BY GORDON TAYLOR |first=Gordon|last=Taylor|publisher=A&B Computing|date=January 1985|accessdate=2010-10-21|quote=Dynamic Duo - Acornsoft's ViewSheet with the Raven-20 Shadow RAM board.}}</ref> and a book ''ViewSheet and Viewstore: A Dabhand Guide by Graham Bell'' was published by ''Dabs Press'' in 1989.<ref name=\"dabhand-1\">{{cite web|url=http://cowsarenotpurple.co.uk/bbccomputer/master512/m512ug-dabs/append-g.html|title=ViewSheet and Viewstore: A Dabhand Guide by Graham Bell|first=Graham|last=Bell|publisher=Dabs Press|year=1989|accessdate=2010-10-21|quote=A complete tutorial and reference guide for the Acornsoft ViewSheet spreadsheet and the ViewStore database manager}}</ref>\n\nDavid Brown, in his review for ''The Micro User'' states that ViewSheet \"succeeds in providing all the basic spreadsheet functions in a well presented package\".

In order to do this, the company developed porting platforms that produced [[bug compatible]] versions. The company took the same approach when the IBM PC was launched, producing a product that was essentially identical to the original 8-bit Apple II version. Sales were initially brisk, with about 300,000 copies sold.\n\nVisiCalc used the A1 notation in formulas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bricklin.com/history/saiidea.htm|title=The Idea|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was launched in 1983, taking full advantage of the expanded memory and screen of the PC, VisiCalc sales ended almost overnight. Sales declined so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent. [[Lotus Development]] purchased the company in 1985, and immediately ended sales of VisiCalc and the company's other products.\n\n==History==\n{{blockquote|VISICALC represented a new idea of a way to use a computer and a new way of thinking about the world.

The professor was creating a financial model on a blackboard that was ruled with vertical and horizontal lines (resembling accounting paper) to create a table, and he wrote formulas and data into the cells. When the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite several sequential entries in the table. Bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an \"electronic spreadsheet\" to view results of underlying formulae.<ref name=\"joshcalc\">{{cite web\n <!--  | last = NONE (credited to staff writers)\n  | first =NONE (credited to staff writers) -->\n  | title =Dan Bricklin, Inventor of the Electronic Spreadsheet\n  | work = Low End Mac\n  | date = November 7, 2006\n  | url = http://lowendmac.com/2006/dan-bricklin-inventor-of-the-electronic-spreadsheet/\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =July 13, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n[[Bob Frankston]] joined Bricklin, and the pair formed the [[Software Arts]] company and developed the VisiCalc program for two months during the winter of 1978–79.  Bricklin wrote that\n\n<blockquote>with the years of experience we had at the time we created VisiCalc, we were familiar with many row/column financial programs. In fact, Bob had worked since the 1960s at Interactive Data Corporation, a major timesharing utility that was used for some of them and I was exposed to some at Harvard Business School in one of the classes.</blockquote>\n\nBricklin was referring to the variety of [[report generator]]s that were in use at that time, including Business Planning Language (BPL) from International Timesharing Corporation (ITS) and Foresight from Foresight Systems. However, these earlier timesharing programs were not completely interactive, nor did they run on personal computers.\n\nFrankston described VisiCalc as a \"magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations\", which \"allows the user to just solve the problem using familiar tools and concepts\". The [[VisiCorp|Personal Software]] company began selling VisiCalc in mid-1979 for under $100, after a demonstration at the fourth [[West Coast Computer Faire]] and an official launch on June&nbsp;4 at the [[National Computer Conference]].

This allowed skilled BASIC programmers to add features, such as trigonometric functions, that VisiCalc lacked.\n\nBricklin and Frankston originally intended to fit the program into 16k memory, but they later realized that the program needed at least 32k. Even 32k was too small to support some features that the creators wanted to include, such as a split text/graphics screen . However, Apple eventually began shipping all Apple IIs with 48k memory following a drop in RAM prices, which enabled the developers to include more features. The initial release supported tape cassette storage, but that was quickly dropped.\n\nAt VisiCalc's release, Personal Software promised to port the program to other computers, starting with those that used the [[MOS Technology 6502]] microprocessor,{{r|InfoWorld Jun 1979}} and versions appeared for the Atari 800 and Commodore PET, both of which could be done easily because those computers used the same processor as the Apple II, and large portions of code could be reused. The PET version, which contained two separate executables for 40 and 80-column models, was widely criticized for having a very small amount of worksheet space due to the developers' inclusion of their own custom DOS, which used a large amount of memory (the PET only had 32k versus the Apple II's available 48k).\n\nOther ports followed for the [[Apple III]], [[Zilog Z-80]]-based Tandy [[TRS-80 Model I]], [[TRS-80 Model II|Model II]], [[TRS-80 Model III|Model III]], [[TRS-80 Model 4|Model 4]], and [[Sony SMC-70]]. The TRS-80 Model I and Sony SMC-70 ports were the only versions of VisiCalc without [[copy protection]]. The Sony SMC-70 port was the only CP/M version. Most versions were disk-based, but the PET VisiCalc came with a [[dongle|ROM chip]] that the user had to install in one of the motherboard's expansion ROM sockets. The most important port was for the [[IBM PC]], and VisiCalc was one of the first commercial packages available when the IBM PC shipped in 1981.{{r|reed}} It quickly became a best-seller on this platform, in spite of being severely limited to be compatible with the versions for the 8-bit platforms. It is estimated that 300,000 copies were sold on the PC, bringing total sales to about 1 million copies.<ref name=\"langdell19850806\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvLd5Aw2T3YC&lpg=PA6&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=VisiCalc Production Ends | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-08-06 | accessdate=28 October 2013 | author=Langdell, James | pages=33}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982 VisiCalc's price had risen from $100 to $250.<ref name=\"tommervik198203\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=4 | title=What Price Software? / Part 2 of The Great Arcade/Computer Controversy | work=Softline | date=March 1982 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Allan | pages=10}}</ref> Several competitors appeared in the market, notably [[SuperCalc]]{{r|barry19811005}} and [[Multiplan]],{{r|caruso19840402}} each of which added more features and corrected deficiencies in VisiCalc, but could not overcome its market dominance. A more dramatic change occurred with the 1983 launch of [[Lotus Development Corporation]]'s [[Lotus 1-2-3]], written by a former Personal Software/VisiCorp employee, [[Mitch Kapor]], who had written VisiTrend and VisiPlot. Unlike the PC version of VisiCalc, 1-2-3 was written to take full advantage of the PC's increased memory, screen and performance. Yet it was designed to be as compatible as possible with VisiCalc, including the menu structure, to allow VisiCalc users to easily migrate to 1-2-3.\n\n1-2-3 was almost immediately successful, and by 1984 ''InfoWorld'' wrote that sales of VisiCalc were \"rapidly declining\", stating that it was \"the first successful software product to have gone through a complete [[software life cycle|life cycle]], from conception in 1978 to introduction in 1979 to peak success in 1982 to decline in 1983 to a probable death, according to industry insiders, in 1984.\" The magazine added that the company was slow to upgrade the software, only releasing an Advanced Version of VisiCalc for the Apple II in 1983 and announcing one for the IBM PC in 1984.<ref name=\"caruso19840402\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA80&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Caruso, Denise | pages=80–83}}</ref> By 1985 VisiCorp was insolvent.

A CSV file stores [[Table (information)|tabular]] data (numbers and text) in [[plain text]].  Each line of the file is a data [[record (computer science)|record]].  Each record consists of one or more [[field (computer science)|fields]], separated by [[comma]]s. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this [[file format]].\n\nThe CSV file format is not fully standardized. The basic idea of separating fields with a comma is clear, but that idea gets complicated when the field data may also contain commas or even embedded [[newline|line-breaks]]. CSV implementations may not handle such field data, or they may use quotation marks to surround the field.  Quotation does not solve everything: some fields may need embedded quotation marks, so a CSV implementation may include escape characters or escape sequences.\n\nIn addition, the term \"CSV\" also denotes some closely related [[Delimiter-separated values|delimiter-separated formats]] that use different field delimiters, for example, semicolons.  These include [[tab-separated values]] and space-separated values.  A delimiter that is not present in the field data (such as tab) keeps the format parsing simple.  These alternate delimiter-separated files are often even given a .csv [[filename extension|extension]] despite the use of a non-comma field separator.  This loose terminology can cause problems in [[data exchange]].  Many applications that accept CSV files have options to select the delimiter character and the quotation character. Semicolons are often used in some European countries, such as Italy, instead of commas.\n\n==Data exchange==\nCSV is a common [[data exchange]] format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common uses is moving tabular data<ref>{{cite web|url=https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/csv|title=CSV - Comma Separated Values|accessdate=2017-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csvreader.com/csv_format.php | title=CSV Files | accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> between programs that natively operate on incompatible (often [[proprietary format|proprietary]] or undocumented) formats.<ref name=\"rfc4180\"/> This works despite lack of adherence to RFC 4180 (or any other standard), because so many programs support variations on the CSV format for data import.\n\nFor example, a user may need to transfer information from a database program that stores data in a proprietary format, to a spreadsheet that uses a completely different format. The database program most likely can export its data as \"CSV\"; the exported CSV file can then be imported by the spreadsheet program.\n\n==Specification==\n{{IETF RFC|4180}} proposes a specification for the CSV format; however actual practice often does not follow the RFC and the term \"CSV\" might refer to any file that:<ref name=\"rfc4180pg2\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://edoceo.com/utilitas/csv-file-format | title=Comma Separated Values (CSV) Standard File Format | publisher=Edoceo, Inc | accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n# is [[plain text]] using a character set such as [[ASCII]], various [[Unicode]] character sets (e.g. [[UTF-8]]), [[EBCDIC]], or [[Shift JIS]],\n# consists of [[record (computer science)|record]]s (typically one record per line),\n# with the records divided into [[field (computer science)|field]]s separated by [[delimiters]] (typically a single reserved character such as comma, semicolon, or tab; sometimes the delimiter may include optional spaces),\n# where every record has the same sequence of fields.\n\nWithin these general constraints, many variations are in use. Therefore, without additional information (such as whether RFC 4180 is honored), a file claimed simply to be in \"CSV\" format is not fully specified. As a result, many applications supporting CSV files allow users to preview the first few lines of the file and then specify the delimiter character(s), quoting rules, etc. If a particular CSV file's variations fall outside what a particular receiving program supports, it is often feasible to examine and edit the file by hand (i.e., with a [[text editor]]) or write a [[Scripting language|script]] or program to produce a conforming format.\n\n==History==\nComma-separated values is a data format that pre-dates personal computers by more than a decade: the [[IBM]] [[Fortran]] (level H extended) compiler under [[OS/360]] supported them in 1972.<ref>{{Citation |title=IBM FORTRAN Program Products for OS and the CMS Component of VM/370 General Information |edition=first |date=July 1972 |id=GC28-6884-0 |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/370/fortran/GC28-6884-0_IBM_FORTRAN_Program_Products_for_OS_and_CMS_General_Information_Jul72.pdf |page=17|accessdate=February 5, 2016|quote=For users familiar with the predecessor FORTRAN IV G and H processors, these are the major new language capabilities}}</ref> List-directed (\"free form\") input/output was defined in [[FORTRAN#FORTRAN 77|FORTRAN 77]], approved in 1978.

The plain-text character of CSV files largely avoids incompatibilities such as [[endianness|byte-order]] and [[word size]]. The files are largely human-readable, so it is easier to deal with them in the absence of perfect documentation or communication.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml | title=CSV, Comma Separated Values (RFC 4180) | accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe main standardization initiative &ndash; transforming \"''[[de facto]]'' fuzzy definition\" into a more precise and ''[[de jure]]'' one &ndash; was in 2005, with RFC4180, defining CSV as a [[MIME content type|MIME Content Type]].

This corresponds to a single [[relation (database)|relation]] in a [[relational database]], or to data (though not calculations) in a typical spreadsheet.\n\nThe format dates back to the early days of business computing and is widely used to pass data between computers with different internal word sizes, data formatting needs, and so forth. For this reason, CSV files are common on all computer platforms.\n\nCSV is a [[Delimiter-separated values|delimited]] text file that uses a [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] to separate values (many implementations of CSV import/export tools allow other separators to be used). Simple CSV implementations may prohibit field values that contain a comma or other special characters such as [[newline]]s. More sophisticated CSV implementations permit them, often by requiring \" ([[double quote]]) characters around values that contain reserved characters (such as commas, double quotes, or less commonly, [[newline]]s). Embedded double quote characters may then be represented by a pair of consecutive double quotes,<ref>*{{Citation |last=Creativyst |year=2010 |title= How To: The Comma Separated Value (CSV) File Format |publisher= creativyst.com |accessdate= May 24, 2010 |url= http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm |doi=}}</ref> or by prefixing a double quote with an [[escape character]] such as a [[backslash]] (for example in [[Sybase]] Central).\n\nCSV formats are not limited to a particular [[character set]].<ref name=\"rfc4180\"/> They work just as well with [[Unicode]] character sets (such as [[UTF-8]] or [[UTF-16]]) as with [[ASCII]] (although particular programs that support CSV may have their own limitations). CSV files normally will even survive naive translation from one character set to another (unlike nearly all proprietary data formats). CSV does not, however, provide any way to indicate what character set is in use, so that must be communicated separately, or determined at the receiving end (if possible).\n\nDatabases that include multiple [[relation (database)|relation]]s cannot be exported as a single CSV file{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. Similarly, CSV cannot naturally represent [[hierarchical]] or [[object-oriented]] data. This is because every CSV record is expected to have the same structure. CSV is therefore rarely appropriate for [[documents]] created with [[HTML]], [[XML]], or other markup or word-processing technologies.\n\nStatistical databases in various fields often have a generally relation-like structure, but with some repeatable groups of fields. For example, health databases such as the [[Demographic and Health Survey]] typically repeat some questions for each child of a given parent (perhaps up to a fixed maximum number of children). [[Statistical analysis]] systems often include utilities that can \"rotate\" such data; for example, a \"parent\" record that includes information about five children can be split into five separate records, each containing (a) the information on one child, and (b) a copy of all the non-child-specific information. CSV can represent either the \"vertical\" or \"horizontal\" form of such data.\n\nIn a relational database, similar issues are readily handled by creating a separate relation for each such group, and connecting \"child\" records to the related \"parent\" records using a [[foreign key]] (such as an ID number or name for the parent). In markup languages such as XML, such groups are typically enclosed within a parent element and repeated as necessary (for example, multiple <code>&lt;child&gt;</code> nodes within a single <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> node). With CSV there is no widely accepted single-file solution.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe name \"CSV\" indicates the use of the comma to separate data fields. Nevertheless, the term \"CSV\" is widely used to refer a large family of formats, which differ in many ways. Some implementations allow or require single or double quotation marks around some or all fields; and some reserve the very first record as a header containing a list of field names.  The character set being used is undefined: some applications require a Unicode [[byte order mark]] (BOM) to enforce [[Unicode]] interpretation (sometimes even a [[UTF-8]] BOM).<ref name=\"rfc4180\"/>  Files that use the tab character instead of comma can be more precisely referred to as \"TSV\" for [[tab-separated values]].\n\nOther implementation differences include handling of more commonplace field separators (such as space or semicolon) and newline characters inside text fields. One more subtlety is the interpretation of a blank line: it can equally be the result of writing a record of zero fields, or a record of one field of zero length; thus decoding it is ambiguous.\n\n=== RFC <nowiki/>4180 standard ===  <!-- given markup prevents magic linking -->\n\nReliance on the standard documented by RFC 4180 can simplify CSV exchange. However, this standard only specifies handling of text-based fields. Interpretation of the text of each field is still application-specific.\n\nRFC 4180 formalized CSV. It defines the [[MIME type]] \"text/csv\", and CSV files that follow its rules should be very widely portable. Among its requirements:\n\n* MS-DOS-style lines that end with (CR/LF) characters (optional for the last line).\n* An optional header record (there is no sure way to detect whether it is present, so care is required when importing).\n* Each record \"should\" contain the same number of comma-separated fields.\n* Any field ''may'' be quoted (with double quotes).\n* Fields containing a line-break, double-quote or commas ''should'' be quoted. (If they are not, the file will likely be impossible to process correctly).\n* A (double) quote character in a field must be represented by two (double) quote characters.\n\nThe format can be processed by most programs that claim to read CSV files. The exceptions are ''(a)'' programs may not support line-breaks within quoted fields, ''(b)'' programs may confuse the optional header with data or interpret the first data line as an optional header and ''(c)'' double quotes in a field may not be parsed correctly automatically.\n\n=== OKI frictionless tabular data package ===\n\nIn 2011 [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI) and various partners created a data protocols working group, which later evolved into the [https://frictionlessdata.io/ Frictionless Data initiative]. One of the main formats they released was [https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/tabular-data-package/ Tabular Data Package]. Tabular Data package was heavily based on CSV, using it as the main data transport format and adding basic type and schema metadata (CSV lacks any type information to distinguish the string \"1\" from the number 1). An initial v1 of Tabular Data Package was released in 2015, and after extensive real-world testing and tool development, v1 of a CSV-based Tabular Data Package was officially released in September 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.okfn.org/2017/09/05/frictionless-data-v1-0/|title=Frictionless Data 1.0 released|year=2016|publisher=[[Open Knowledge International]]|accessdate=2017-09-04}}</ref> The Frictionless Data Initiative has also provided a standard [https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/csv-dialect/ CSV Dialect Description Format] for describing different dialects of CSV, for example specifying the field separator or quoting rules.\n\n=== Internet W3C tabular data standard ===\n\nIn 2013 the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] \"CSV on the Web\" working group began to specify technologies providing a higher interoperability for web applications using CSV or similar formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page|title=CSV on the Web Working Group|year=2013|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] CSV WG|accessdate=2015-04-22}}</ref> The working group completed its work in February 2016, and is officially closed in March 2016 with the release of a set documents and W3C recommendations<ref>[https://github.com/w3c/csvw CSV on the Web Repository] (on GitHub)</ref>\nfor modeling \"Tabular Data\",<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/ Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web] (W3C Recommendation)</ref> and enhancing CSV with [[metadata]] and [[Semantic Web|semantics]].\n\n==Basic rules==\nMany informal documents exist that describe \"CSV\" formats.\n[[IETF]] RFC 4180 (summarized above) defines the format for the \"text/csv\" [[MIME type]] registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]].\n\nRules typical of these and other \"CSV\" specifications and implementations are as follows:\n{{unordered list\n| CSV is a [[delimited]] data format that has [[field (computer science)|fields/columns]] separated by the [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] [[grapheme|character]] and [[row (database)|records/rows]] terminated by [[newline]]s.\n| A CSV file does not require a specific [[character encoding]], [[byte order]], or line terminator format (some software do not support all line-end variations).\n| A record ends at a line terminator. However, line-terminators can be embedded as data within fields, so software must recognize quoted line-separators (see below) in order to correctly assemble an entire record from perhaps multiple lines.\n| All records should have the same number of fields, in the same order.\n| Data within fields is interpreted as a sequence of [[character (computing)|character]]s, not as a sequence of bits or bytes (see RFC 2046, section 4.1). For example, the numeric quantity 65535 may be represented as the 5 ASCII characters \"65535\" (or perhaps other forms such as \"0xFFFF\", \"000065535.000E+00\", etc.); but not as a sequence of 2 bytes intended to be treated as a single binary integer rather than as two characters (e.g. the numbers 11264–11519 have a comma as their high order byte: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"perl\" enclose=\"none\">ord(',')*256..ord(',')*256+255</syntaxhighlight>). If this \"plain text\" convention is not followed, then the CSV file no longer contains sufficient information to interpret it correctly, the CSV file will not likely survive transmission across differing computer architectures, and will not conform to the ''text/csv'' MIME type.\n| Adjacent fields must be separated by a single comma. However, \"CSV\" formats vary greatly in this choice of separator character. In particular, in [[Locale (computer software)|locale]]s where the comma is used as a [[decimal separator]], semicolon, TAB, or other characters are used instead.\n<pre>1997,Ford,E350</pre>\n| Any field ''may'' be ''quoted'' (that is, enclosed within double-quote characters). Some fields ''must'' be quoted, as specified in following rules.\n<pre>\"1997\",\"Ford\",\"E350\"</pre>\n| Fields with embedded commas or double-quote characters must be quoted.\n<pre>1997,Ford,E350,\"Super, luxurious truck\"</pre>\n| Each of the embedded double-quote characters must be represented by a pair of double-quote characters.\n<pre>1997,Ford,E350,\"Super, \"\"luxurious\"\" truck\"</pre>\n| Fields with embedded line breaks must be quoted (however, many CSV implementations do not support embedded line breaks).\n<pre>\n1997,Ford,E350,\"Go get one now\nthey are going fast\"\n</pre>\n| In some CSV implementations{{which|date=September 2017}}, leading and trailing spaces and tabs are trimmed (ignored).

One limitation is that DIF format cannot handle multiple spreadsheets in a single workbook.\n\nDue to the similarity in abbreviation and in age (both date to the early 1980s), the DIF spreadsheet format it is often confused with '''Navy DIF'''; Navy DIF, however, is an unrelated \"document interchange format\" for word processors.<ref name = \"InfoWorld 1985\">{{Cite magazine | last = Petrosky | first = Mary | title = File Conversion Market Grows |magazine= [[InfoWorld]] | volume = 7 | issue = 31 | pages = 36–37 | date = August 5, 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AC8EAAAAMBAJ }} \"Among the file formats designed to facilitate the interchange of text files between microcomputers running different word processing software, IBM's Document Content Architecture (DCA) and the U.S. Navy's document interchange format (DIF) seem to have the greatest support.\"</ref>\n\n==History==\nDIF was developed by Software Arts, Inc. (the developers of the [[VisiCalc]] program) in the early 1980s. The specification was included in many copies of VisiCalc, and published in [[Byte Magazine]]. [[Bob Frankston]] developed the format, with input from others, including [[Mitch Kapor]], who helped so that it could work with his VisiPlot program. (Kapor later went on to found [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] and make [[Lotus 1-2-3]] happen.) The specification was copyright 1981.\n\nDIF was a registered trademark of Software Arts Products Corp. (a legal name for Software Arts at the time).\n\n==Syntax==\nDIF stores everything in an [[ASCII]] text file to mitigate many cross-platform issues back in the days of its creation. However modern spreadsheet software, e.g. [[OpenOffice.org Calc]] and [[Gnumeric]], offer more [[character encoding]] to export/import. The file is divided into 2 sections: header and data. Everything in DIF is represented by a 2- or 3-line chunk. Headers get a 3-line chunk; data, 2. Header chunks start with a text identifier that is all caps, only alphabetic characters, and less than 32 letters. The following line must be a pair of numbers, and the third line must be a quoted string. On the other hand, data chunks start with a number pair and the next line is a quoted string or a keyword.\n\n===Values===\nA value occupies two lines, the first a pair of numbers and the second either a string or a keyword.\nThe first number of the pair indicates type:\n*&minus;1 &ndash; directive type, the second number is ignored, the following line is one of these keywords:\n**BOT &ndash; beginning of tuple (start of row)\n**EOD &ndash; end of data\n*0 &ndash; numeric type, value is the second number, the following line is one of these keywords:\n**V &ndash; valid\n**NA &ndash; not available\n**ERROR &ndash; error\n**TRUE &ndash; true boolean value\n**FALSE &ndash; false boolean value\n*1 &ndash; string type, the second number is ignored, the following line is the string in double quotes\n\n===Header chunk===\nA header chunk is composed of an identifier line followed by the two lines of a value.\n*TABLE - a numeric value follows of the version, the disused second line of the value contains a generator comment\n*VECTORS - the number of columns follows as a numeric value\n*TUPLES - the number of rows follows as a numeric value\n*DATA - after a dummy 0 numeric value, the data for the table follow, each row preceded by a BOT value, the entire table terminated by an EOD value\n\nThe numeric values in header chunks use just an empty string instead of the validity keywords.\n\n==Discrepancies in implementations==\nSome implementations (notably those of older Microsoft products) swapped the meaning of VECTORS and TUPLES. Some implementations are insensitive to errors in the dimensions of the table as written in the header and simply use the layout in the DATA section.\n\n==Example==\nFor example, assume we have two columns with one column header row and two data rows:\n{| cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"1\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\"\n|-\n! Text\n! Number\n|-\n| hello\n| 1\n|-\n| has a double quote \" in text\n| -3\n|}\n\nIn a .dif file, this would be (→ indicates comments):\n<pre>\nTABLE\n0,1\n\"EXCEL\"\nVECTORS     → the number of columns follows as a numeric value\n0,2         → '0' indicates that it's a numeric type, '2' since we have 2 columns\n\"\"\nTUPLES      → the number of rows follows as a numeric value\n0,3         → '0' indicates that it's a numeric type, '3' since we have 3 rows\n\"\"\nDATA        → after a dummy 0 numeric value, the data for the table follow\n0,0         → this is the dummy 0 numeric value\n\"\"\n-1,0        → '-1' for the directive type.

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}}\n'''Fielded Text''' is a proposed standard which provides structure and schema definition to text files which contain tables of values (for example, [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files). The standard allows the format and structure of the data within the text file to be specified by a ''Meta'' file. This Meta file can then be used to access the data in the file in manner similar to which data is accessed in a database.\n\n==Meta files==\nThe Meta files are XML files/streams which describe how the fielded text file is structured and how the data in fields is formatted. The information it contains is analogous to the Meta information for a database.\n\nThe Meta contains the following groups of information\n* '''Main Section''' which specifies properties applying to the whole text file.\n* '''Field Sections''' which specify the properties of each field of data used within the text file\n* '''Substitution Sections''' which specify which substitutions are used within the text file. Substitutions are similar to Escape Sequences used in some CSV files (e.g. \\n).\n* '''Sequence Sections'''.  A Fielded Text file can have lines with different sets of fields depending on the value of a key field(s). The Sequence Sections in the Meta File specify the sequence of fields which can follow a key field.\n\nMeta files typically have a file extension of \"ftm\"\n\n==Declared and Undeclared Fielded Text files==\nA Fielded Text file can be either declared or undeclared.\n\nA '''Declared''' Fielded Text file starts with 2 special lines which reference the Meta associated with the text file. The Meta reference can either be a URI, a file or embedded within the Text File as comments.  Declared Fielded Text files always begin with the characters \"''|!Fielded Text^|''\" (without quotes) to identify the files as a declared Fielded Text file. A file extension of \"ftx\" is often used for Declared Fielded Text files. The standard also proposes that the MIME type text/fielded be used to identify Fielded Text data streams.\n\nAn '''Undeclared''' Fielded Text file does not start with the 2 special lines. It is not implicitly associated with a Fielded Text meta file/stream. Applications need to explicitly associate a Meta file with an undeclared Fielded Text file in order to determine its structure and format. Existing CSV, Fixed Length field and other text files containing table(s) of  values are undeclared Fielded Text files.\n\n==Basic Example==\nBelow is a basic CSV file.  It has 2 heading lines and 4 data lines.  The lines contain 7 fields of various types.\n \"Pet Name\", \"Age\", \"Color\", \"Date Received\", \"Price\", \"Needs Walking\", \"Type\"\n , (Years), , , (Dollars), ,\n \"Rover\", 4.5, Brown, 12 Feb 2004, 80, True, \"Dog\"\n \"Charlie\", , Gold, 5 Apr 2007, 12.3, False, \"Fish\"\n \"Molly\", 2, Black, 12 Dec 2006, 25, False, \"Cat\"\n \"Gilly\", , White, 10 Apr 2007, 10, False, \"Guinea Pig\"\n\nThe following Fielded Text Meta file specifies the structure and layout (schema) of the above text file.\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?>\n <FieldedText HeadingLineCount=\"2\">\n   <Field Name=\"PetName\" />\n   <Field DataType=\"Float\" Name=\"Age\" />\n   <Field Name=\"Color\" />\n   <Field DataType=\"DateTime\" Name=\"DateReceived\" Format=\"d MMM yyyy\" />\n   <Field DataType=\"Decimal\" Name=\"Price\" />\n   <Field DataType=\"Boolean\" Name=\"NeedsWalking\" />\n   <Field Name=\"Type\" />\n </FieldedText>\n</source>\nFollowing is a Declared Fielded Text file which contains the above CSV text together with the its meta embedded as comments.  The ~ character specifies a comment line.\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n ~|!Fielded Text^| Version=\"1.0\"\n ~ MetaEmbedded=\"True\"\n ~ <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?>\n ~ <FieldedText LineCommentChar=\"~\" HeadingLineCount=\"2\">\n ~   <Field Name=\"PetName\" />\n ~   <Field DataType=\"Float\" Name=\"Age\" />\n ~   <Field Name=\"Color\" />\n ~   <Field DataType=\"DateTime\" Name=\"DateReceived\" Format=\"d MMM yyyy\" />\n ~   <Field DataType=\"Decimal\" Name=\"Price\" />\n ~   <Field DataType=\"Boolean\" Name=\"NeedsWalking\" />\n ~   <Field Name=\"Type\" />\n ~ </FieldedText>\n \"Pet Name\", \"Age\", \"Color\", \"Date Received\", \"Price\", \"Needs Walking\", \"Type\"\n , (Years), , , (Dollars), ,\n \"Rover\", 4.5, Brown, 12 Feb 2004, 80, True, \"Dog\"\n \"Charlie\", , Gold, 5 Apr 2007, 12.3, False, \"Fish\"\n \"Molly\", 2, Black, 12 Dec 2006, 25, False, \"Cat\"\n \"Gilly\", , White, 10 Apr 2007, 10, False, \"Guinea Pig\"\n</source>\n\n==Capabilities==\nThe Fielded Text standard aims to provide sufficient capabilities to handle nearly all existing text files containing tables of values while keeping the schema of the Meta as simple as possible.  The following list summarises the capabilities of the Fielded Text standard:\n*Fields separated by a delimiter character\n*Fixed Length Fields\n*Mixed Fixed Length and Delimiter separated fields in a line\n*Quoted Fields (Optional or Explicit)\n*New Lines in Quotes\n*Automatic New Line detection or specified New Line character\n*Comments\n*Ignoring Blank Lines\n*Ignoring extra characters/fields in lines\n*Handling language cultures\n*Multiple Heading Lines (both delimited and fixed length)\n*Substitutions (escape sequences)\n*Embedded (Stuffed) Quote Characters\n*Boolean, DateTime, Decimal, Float, Integer and String fields\n*Field Heading Constraints\n*Null fields\n*Constant fields\n*Specify format and styles of fields\n*Lines can have different sequences of fields based on the value of “key” fields\n\n==Specification==\nThe draft specification of the Fielded Text standard can be found at the [http://www.fieldedtext.org Fielded Text home page]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comma-separated values]]\n*[[Delimiter-separated values]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fieldedtext.org Fielded Text home page]\n*{{IETF RFC|4180}}: Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files\n\n[[Category:Computer file formats]]\n[[Category:Spreadsheet file formats]]"

      "title": "SYmbolic LinK (SYLK)",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYmbolic_LinK_%28SYLK%29",
      "text": "{{distinguish|symbolic link}}\n'''Symbolic Link''' ('''SYLK''') is a [[Microsoft]] file format typically used to exchange data between applications, specifically [[spreadsheets]]. SYLK files conventionally have a <code>.slk</code> suffix. Composed of only displayable [[Windows code page|ANSI]] characters, it can be easily created and processed by other applications, such as [[databases]].\n\nMicrosoft does not publish a SYLK specification.  Variants of the format are supported by [[Multiplan]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Microsoft Works]], [[OpenOffice.org]], and [[Gnumeric]].\n\nA commonly encountered (and spurious) 'occurrence' of the SYLK file happens when a [[comma-separated value]] (CSV) format is saved with an unquoted first field name of 'ID', that is the first two characters match the first two characters of the SYLK file format.  Microsoft Excel (at least to Office 2016) will then emit misleading error messages relating to the format of the file, such as \"The file you are trying to open, 'x.csv', is in a different format than specified by the file extension...\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/323626 | title=\"SYLK: File format is not valid\" error message when you open file | accessdate=August 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alunr.com/articles/excel-csv-import-returns-an-sylk-file-format-error | title=Excel CSV import returns an SYLK file format error | accessdate=August 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Limitations==\nSYLK does not have support for Unicode.  Even if a SYLK file is created by an application that supports Unicode (for example Microsoft Excel), the SYLK file will be encoded in the current system's [[Windows code page|ANSI]] code page, not in Unicode.  If the application contained characters that were displayable in Unicode but have no code point in the current system's code page, they will be converted to question marks ('?') in the SYLK file.\n\nThe semicolon is treated as a field separator in SYLK, so cannot be used unescaped in data values.  If a character string in the SYLK file is to contain a semicolon (;) then it should be prefixed with another semicolon so the string would appear as e.g., \"WIDGET;;AXC1254\". MS Excel will strip the first semicolon on import and the data element will appear as \"WIDGET;AXC1254\".\n\nEach line of a SYLK input file must be no longer than 260 characters.  Otherwise, Microsoft Excel will issue an error message and skip loading the overlong line.\n\n==Sample SYLK code==\n\nAs an example, the following SYLK code in a text file with the .slk extension:\n\n ID;P\n C;Y1;X1;K\"Row 1\"\n C;Y2;X1;K\"Row 2\"\n C;Y3;X1;K\"Total\"\n C;Y1;X2;K11\n C;Y2;X2;K22\n C;Y3;X2;K33\n E\n\nwould be displayed like this when read by an appropriate spreadsheet:\n\n{| cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"1\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\"\n|-----\n| Row 1 || 11\n|-----\n| Row 2 || 22\n|-----\n| Total || 33\n|}\n\n=== for numeric formatting ===\nThe formatting of 2 decimal digits is applied to Column 2 using <pre>F;P2;C2</pre>\nwhere P0 is for General, P1 is for no decimal, P2 is for 2 digits, P3 has leading $ sign with 2 decimal points as defined below.\n\n ID;P\n P;PGeneral\n P;P_(* #,##0_);;_(* \\-#,##0_);;_(* \"-\"_);;_(@_)\n P;P_(* #,##0.00_);;_(* \\(#,##0.00\\);;_(* \"-\"??_);;_(@_)\n P;P_(\"$\"* #,##0.00_);;_(\"$\"* \\(#,##0.00\\);;_(\"$\"* \"-\"??_);;_(@_)\n C;Y1;X1;K\"Row 1\"\n C;Y2;X1;K\"Row 2\"\n C;Y3;X1;K\"Total\"\n C;Y1;X2;K11\n C;Y2;X2;K22\n C;Y3;X2;K0;ER1C2+R2C2\n F;P2;C2\n E\n\nwould be displayed like this when read by an appropriate spreadsheet:\n\n{| cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"1\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\"\n|-----\n| Row 1 || 11.00\n|-----\n| Row 2 || 22.00\n|-----\n| Total || 33.00\n|}\n\n=== for column width ===\n{{code|F;W< n1 > [S] < n2 > [S] < n3 >}} defines the widths of a group of columns:\n\n;[S] : one space\n;< n1 > : the first column\n;< n2 > : the last column\n;< n3 > : the width of columns in number of characters\n\nFor example: Adding these SYLK codes will adjust the column width of column 1 and 2 to 20 and 30 respectively.\n\n<pre>\nF;W1 1 20\nF;W2 2 30\n</pre>\n\n=== cell formatting properties ===\n  F; < cl > < n > < c2 >\n; < cl > : one of the following 1-character formatting codes:\n:; D : default\n:; C : continuous cross-cell display\n:; E : scientific exponentiation\n:; F : fixed decimal point\n:; G : general format\n:; $ : leading $ and 2 decimal points\n:; * : bar graph, one asterisk per unit (5 would be *****)\n;< n > : the number of digits.\n;< c2 > : one of the following 1-character alignment codes:\n:; D : default\n:; C : center\n:; G : general(textleft, numbersright) \n:; L : left justify\n:; R : right justify\n\nFor example: The following SYLK code demonstrates the cell formatting properties:\n\n<pre>\n ID;P\n P;PGeneral\n C;Y1;X1;K\"Row 1 Left Justify\"\n F;P0;FG0L\n C;Y2;X1;K\"Row 2 Right Justify\"\n F;P0;FG0R\n C;Y3;X1;K\"Total at Center\"\n F;P0;FG0C\n C;Y1;X2;K11\n C;Y2;X2;K22\n C;Y3;X2;K0;ER1C2+R2C2\n F;Y1;X2;FF2L\n F;Y2;X2;FF2R\n F;Y3;X2;F$2C\n F;W1 2 25\n E\n</pre>\n\n==SYLK syntax==\n<pre>\nSYLK_file ::=\n\tRecord +\n\nRecord ::=\n\tRecordType Field* newline\n</pre>\n* '''ID''' record\n** Use:\n**: A header to identify spreadsheet type and creator.\n**: Must be first record in the file.\n** Record type:\n**: ID\n** Mandatory fields:\n**:; P program\n**::: file creator\n**:::* possible creators include:\n**:::** MP (Multiplan)\n**:::** XL (Excel)\n** Possible fields:\n**:; N\n**:: If present, file uses ;N style cell protection\n**:: If absent, file uses ;P style cell protection\n**:; E\n**:: If present, NE records are redundant\n**:: If absent, NE records are not redundant\n* '''B''' record\n** Use:\n**: Tells number of rows and columns in the spreadsheet.\n**: Recommended that it come before C and F records\n** Record type:\n**: B\n** Mandatory fields:\n**:; X columns\n**:: tells maximum number of columns\n**:; Y rows\n**:: tells maximum number of rows\n* '''C''' record\n** Use:\n**: Cell contents\n** Record type:\n**: C\n** Mandatory fields:\n**:; X column\n**:: column position (one based)\n** Possible fields:\n**:; Y row\n**:: row position (one based).

Conversion to unix time can be done by subtracting the difference between Jan 1 1970 and Jan 1 1900 (25,569 days) and then multiplying by 86400; converting from unix time to SYLK datetime is done by dividing the value by 86400 and then adding 25569.

Among these are the well known universal multilingual [[spell checker]], which can also be found in products like [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Mail (OS X)|Mail]]. Grammar checking, find and replace, style and color pickers are similar examples of design features found throughout the Apple application space.\n\nMoreover, the applications in the iWork suite also share a new ''model'' of the document. In most document-based applications there is a particular data type which forms the basis of the application's view of the world, for instance, in word processors the text is the first-class citizen of the application, while in a spreadsheet it is the cells in the table. Other objects, images or charts for instance, are managed by being attached to, or referenced to, the underlying primary data type.\n\nIn iWork, all of the applications share a common underlying document format, the \"canvas\", a generic container type that provides layout and storage mechanisms. Each application then adds its own custom objects and places them on the canvas. Pages, for instance, conventionally opens with a single large text object on the canvas. To the user it appears to be a typical word processor, but they can grab the corner and re-size it as in a page layout application. In Numbers, one initially sees a grid of cells like any other spreadsheet, but the user is free to size it smaller than the canvas, and then add multiple grids, charts or even drawings to the same canvas.\n\nThe difference is subtle, as many of these features are also implemented in more traditional programs like [[Microsoft Excel]]. However, the difference in UI can be significant. In Excel, for instance, charts are stored as part of a sheet, and can be moved inadvertently through natural user actions. In Numbers, charts are, like everything else, part of the canvas, and changes to the sheet(s) are normally independent.\n\nThe iWork model bears some resemblance to the earlier Apple effort, [[OpenDoc]]. OpenDoc also used a single underlying document engine, along with a single on-disk format. Unlike iWork, however, OpenDoc also used a single application, in which various editors could be invoked. For instance, one could open a generic document, start a spreadsheet editor, then add a spreadsheet. iWork lacks this level of flexibility in editing terms, but maintains it in layout.\n\n===Desktop applications===\n\n====Pages====\n{{Main|Pages (word processor)}}\n[[Pages (word processor)|Pages]] is a word processing application.\n\nBesides basic word processing functionality, Pages includes templates designed by Apple to allow users to create various types of documents, including [[newsletters]], invitations, [[stationery]], and [[résumé]]s, along with a number of education-themed templates for students and teachers, such as reports and outlines.<ref name=\"pr05\"/><ref name=\"pr08\"/> Pages 5, a complete redesign, removed more than 100 of the features of Pages 4.x, including bookmarks, mail merge, linked text boxes, multiple section capability, ability to set default zoom. It has been slowly adding some back in subsequent 5.x releases (default zoom, for example, can now be set, but still no linked text boxes, multiple select, mail merge, book marks, and more than 90 other features that were present in version 4.3).\n\nAlong with Keynote and Numbers, Pages integrates with Apple's iLife suite. Using the Media Browser, users can drag and drop movies, photos and music directly into documents within the Pages application.<ref name=\"pr05\"/> A Full Screen view hides the menubar and toolbars, and an outline mode allows users to quickly create outlines which can easily be rearranged by dragging and dropping, as well as collapsed and expanded. Pages includes support for entering complex equations with [[MathType|MathType 6]] and for reference citing using [[EndNote|EndNote X2]].<ref name=\"pr09\"/>\n\nThe Pages application can open and edit Microsoft Word documents (including [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] and [[Office Open XML]] files), and [[Text file|plain text]] documents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iwork/compatibility/|title=iWork - Open, save, and email Microsoft Office files|publisher=Apple|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> Pages 5 can no longer read or export [[Rich Text Format|rich text format]] documents. Pages can also export documents in the DOC, PDF, and ePub formats.<ref name=\"pr06\"/> It cannot read or write [[OpenDocument]] file formats.\n\nAs a word-processing application targeted towards creating attractive documents for a range of applications such as lesson plans and newsletters, Pages competes with [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Publisher]] (never ported to OS X), Apple's own free [[e-book]] and PDF authoring application, [[iBooks Author]], and Adobe's professional-market desktop publishing application [[InDesign]].\n\n====Keynote====\n{{Main|Keynote (presentation software)}}\n[[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]] is an application used to create and play presentations. Its features are comparable to those of [[Microsoft PowerPoint]], though Keynote contains several unique features. Keynote, like Pages and Numbers, integrates with the iLife application suite. Users can drag and drop media from [[iMovie]], [[iTunes]], [[iPhoto]] and [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]] directly into Keynote presentations using the Media Browser. Keynote contains a number of templates, transitions, and effects. Magic Move allows users to apply simple transitions to automatically animate images and text that are repeated on consecutive slides.<ref name=\"pr05\"/><ref name=\"pr08\"/><ref name=\"pr06\"/><ref name=\"pr09\"/>\n\nApple formerly released a Keynote Remote application for iOS that let users view slides and presenter notes and control Keynote presentations with an [[iPhone]] or [[iPod Touch]] over a [[Wi-Fi]] network,<ref name=\"pr09\"/> but that functionality has been rolled into subsequent releases of the main Keynote iOS application.\n\nKeynote supports a number of file formats. By default, presentations are saved as .key files. Keynote can open and edit Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt) files. In addition, presentations can be exported as Microsoft PowerPoint files, [[QuickTime]] movies (which are also playable on [[iPod]] and iPhone), [[HTML]] files, and [[PDF]] files. Presentations can also be sent directly to [[iDVD]], [[iTunes]], [[GarageBand]], [[iWeb]],<ref name=\"pr06\"/> and to [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"pr08\"/> The Keynote 09 file format is not backward compatible; .key files saved with Keynote '09 [http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090225034801527 cannot be opened] with earlier versions of Keynote. \n\n====Numbers====\n{{Main|Numbers (spreadsheet)}}\n[[Numbers (spreadsheet)|Numbers]] is a spreadsheet application that was added to the iWork suite in 2007 with the release of iWork '08. Numbers, like [[Microsoft Excel]] and other spreadsheet applications, lets users organize data into tables, perform calculations with formulas, and create charts and graphs using data entered into the spreadsheet. Numbers, however, differs from other spreadsheet applications in that it allows users to create multiple tables in a single document on a flexible canvas. Many prebuilt templates, including ones designed for personal finance, education, and business use, are included.<ref name=\"pr08\"/><ref name=\"pr09\"/>\n\nNumbers 2.0 was included with iWork '09, with several improvements. Charts that are pasted into Keynote and Pages are automatically updated across documents when they are changed in Numbers. Additionally, Numbers 2 lets users categorize data in tables by column, which can then be collapsed and summarized.<ref name=\"pr09\"/>\n\nNumbers 3.6 added in the ability to open Numbers '08 spreadsheets, among other things.\n\n===Web services===\n\n====iWork.com====\n{{infobox website\n| name           = iWork.com\n| logo           = [[File:IWork.com logo.png]]\n| screenshot     = [[File:iWorkdotcom.png|center|250px]]\n| caption        =\n| url            = [http://www.iwork.com iwork.com]\n| alexa = {{IncreaseNegative}} 3,565,463 ({{as of|2014|4|1|alt=April 2014}})<ref name=\"alexa\">{{cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/iwork.com |title= Iwork.com Site Info | publisher= [[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate= 2014-04-01 }}</ref>\n| commercial     = Free while in beta; requires iWork '09<ref name=\"beta\" />\n| type           =\n| language       = Multilingual\n| registration   = Required ([[Apple ID]])\n| owner          = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| launch date    = {{start date|2009|01|06}}\n| current status = Discontinued July 31, 2012\n| revenue        =\n| slogan         =\n}}\niWork.com was a free service that enabled users to share iWork '09 documents online directly from within Pages, Keynote and Numbers.\nUsers could click the iWork.com toolbar icon and login using their Apple ID to upload a document and invite others to view it online. Viewers could leave comments and notes on the document and download a copy in iWork, Microsoft Office, or PDF formats. Document owners could track comments at the iWork.com website.\n\nIt was released as a [[software release life cycle#Beta|public beta]] on January 6, 2009 at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo]].

Viewing, commenting, and downloading require only a web browser and an invitation to view the document.\n\nApple announced that after July 31, 2012, users will be no longer able to publish new documents to iWork.com from any iWork application. Documents stored on iWork.com will not be available to download or view after the shut down date. Instead, users can use iCloud to share documents between their computers (running [[OS X Mountain Lion]]) and their [[iDevice|iOS devices]]. Users attempting to access the iWork.com site are re-directed to the Apple homepage.\n\n====iWork for iCloud====\n{{main|ICloud#iWork for iCloud}}\nDuring the 2013 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) keynote speech, iWork for iCloud was announced for release at the same time as the next version of the app versions of iWork later in the year. The three apps for both iOS and OS X that form Apple's iWork suite ([[Pages (word processor)|Pages]], [[Numbers (spreadsheet)|Numbers]], and [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]]), will be made available on a web interface (named as Pages for iCloud, Numbers for iCloud, and Keynote for iCloud respectively), and accessed via the iCloud website under each users iCloud Apple ID login.

It is recommended for users for whom stability is more important than the latest enhancements.\n\n=== Release schedule ===\nLibreOffice uses a [[time-based release schedule]] for predictability, rather than a \"when it's ready\" schedule. New major versions are released around every six months, in January or February and July or August of each year. The initial intention was to release in March and September, to align with the schedule of other free software projects.<ref name=\"releaseplan\">{{cite web\n  | title       = Release Plan\n  | url         = https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan\n  | work        = The Document Foundation Wiki\n  | accessdate  = 25 March 2011\n}}</ref>\nMinor bugfix versions of the \"fresh\" and \"still\" release branches are released frequently.\n\n== Users and deployments ==\n[[File:LibreOffice weekly downloads.svg|thumb|LibreOffice weekly downloads since 2010.]]\n{{Graph:Chart|width=400|height=200|type=rect|x=2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018|y=25, 75, 100, 120, 200|showValues=offset:4}}\n\nThe figure shows the wordwide number of LibreOffice users from 2011 to 2018 in millions.

It features calculation, graphing tools, [[pivot table]]s, and a [[macro (computer science)|macro]] programming language called [[Visual Basic for Applications]]. It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms, especially since version 5 in 1993, and it has replaced [[Lotus 1-2-3]] as the industry standard for spreadsheets.

Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA<ref name=\"Press\">\nFor example, by converting to Visual Basic the recipes in {{cite book |title=Numerical recipes: the art of scientific computing |author1=Press, William H.

VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011,<ref>{{cite web |title=Excel |work=Office for Mac |url=http://www.officeformachelp.com/excel/ |publisher=OfficeforMacHelp.com |accessdate=July 8, 2012}}</ref> although the build lacks support for [[ActiveX]] objects, impacting some high level developer tools.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Using Excel - PC or Mac? {{!}} Excel Lemon|url = https://www.excellemon.com/view/100-using-excel-pc-or-mac|archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160921074527/https://www.excellemon.com/view/100-using-excel-pc-or-mac|dead-url = yes|archive-date = September 21, 2016|website = www.excellemon.com|accessdate = July 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the [[Macro (computer science)|Macro]] Recorder.<ref name=\"Walkenbach\">However an increasing proportion of Excel functionality is not captured by the Macro Recorder leading to largely useless macros.  Compatibility among multiple versions of Excel is also a downfall of this method.  A macro recorder in Excel 2010 may not work in Excel 2003 or older.  This is most common when changing colours and formatting of cells.\n{{cite book |title=Excel 2007 VBA Programming for Dummies |author=Walkenbach, John |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=2IBbPiP3wOIC&pg=PA79 |chapter= Chapter 6: Using the Excel macro recorder |page=79 ''ff'' |edition=Revised by Jan Karel Pieterse |isbn=978-0-470-04674-6 |year=2007  |publisher=Wiley }}</ref> The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts,<ref name=\"alltop9\">{{cite web |url= https://www.alltop9.com/100-plus-excel-keyboard-shortcuts-you-do-not-know/|title= More than 100 Excel Keyboard Shortcuts |work= AllTop9.com }}</ref> a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.\n\nMacro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions.  Some code that is used in Excel 2010 cannot be used in Excel 2003.  Making a Macro that changes the cell colours and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible.\n\nVBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel ''Object Model'',<ref name=\"Walkenbach2\">{{cite book |title=cited work |author=Walkenbach, John |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=2IBbPiP3wOIC&pg=PA53 |chapter= Chapter 4: Introducing the Excel object model |page=53 ''ff'' |isbn=978-0-470-04674-6 |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref> a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or ''methods'' that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or ''command bars'' and ''message boxes''). User-created VBA [[subroutine]]s execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.\n\n==== History ====\nFrom its first version Excel supported end user programming of macros (automation of repetitive tasks) and user defined functions (extension of Excel's built-in function library). In early versions of Excel these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special purpose macro sheets (stored with file extension .XLM in Windows.) XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel 4.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/site/tip/developer_faq_general_questions/ |title=The Spreadsheet Page for Excel Users and Developers |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |publisher=J-Walk & Associates, Inc. }}</ref> Beginning with version 5.0 Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version 5.0 XLM recording was still allowed as an option. After version 5.0 that option was discontinued. All versions of Excel, including Excel 2010 are capable of running an XLM macro, though Microsoft discourages their use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/working-with-excel-4-0-macros-HA010336614.aspx |title=Working with Excel 4.0 macros |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |publisher=Microsoft Office Support }}</ref>\n\n=== Charts ===\n[[File:Excel chart.PNG|thumb|right|300px|[[Graph of a function|Graph]] made using Microsoft Excel]]\n\nExcel supports [[chart]]s, [[Graph of a function|graphs]], or [[histogram]]s generated from specified groups of cells. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet, or added as a separate object.\n\nThese displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells change. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user's change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.\n\n=== Add-ins ===\nAdditional features are available using [[add-in]]s. Several are provided with Excel, including:\n\n* Analysis ToolPak: Provides data analysis tools for statistical and engineering analysis (includes [[analysis of variance]] and [[regression analysis]])\n* Analysis ToolPak VBA: [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] functions for Analysis ToolPak\n* Euro Currency Tools: Conversion and formatting for euro currency\n* Solver Add-In: Tools for optimization and equation solving\n\n== Data storage and communication ==\n\n=== Number of rows and columns ===\nVersions of Excel up to 7.0 had a limitation in the size of their data sets of 16K (2<sup>14</sup> = {{val|16384}}) rows. Versions 8.0 through 11.0 could handle 64K (2<sup>16</sup> = {{val|65536}}) rows and 256 columns (2<sup>8</sup> as label 'IV'). Version 12.0 onwards, including the current Version 16.x, can handle over 1M (2<sup>20</sup> = {{val|1048576}}) rows, and {{val|16384}} (2<sup>14</sup> as label 'XFD') columns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730921.aspx|title=The \"Big Grid\" and Increased Limits in Excel 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2008|website=microsoft.com}}</ref>\n\n=== File formats ===\n{{Infobox file format\n| name = Excel Spreadsheet\n| icon =\n| logo =\n| extension = .xls, (.xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb - Excel 2007)\n| mime = application/vnd.ms-excel\n| type code =\n| uniform type = com.microsoft.excel.xls<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/UTIRef/Articles/System-DeclaredUniformTypeIdentifiers.html|title=Mac Developer Library|publisher=}}</ref>\n| magic =\n| owner = [[Microsoft]]\n| genre = [[Spreadsheet]]\n| container for =\n| contained by =\n| extended from =\n| extended to =\n| standard =\n}}\n\nMicrosoft Excel up until 2007 version used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format (.XLS) as its primary format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/840817/ |title=How to extract information from Office files by using Office file formats and schemas |publisher=Microsoft |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=November 10, 2008 }}</ref> Excel 2007 uses [[Office Open XML]] as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous [[XML]]-based format called \"XML Spreadsheet\" (\"XMLSS\"), first introduced in Excel 2002.<ref name=\"xml\">{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140066(office.10).aspx |title=XML Spreadsheet Reference |work=Microsoft Excel 2002 Technical Articles |publisher=MSDN |date=August 2001 |accessdate=November 10, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read [[comma-separated values|CSV]], [[DBase|DBF]], [[SYmbolic LinK (SYLK)|SYLK]], [[Data Interchange Format|DIF]], and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2006/08/24/deprecated-features-for-excel-2007.aspx |title=Deprecated features for Excel 2007 |publisher=Microsoft&nbsp;— David Gainer |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 }}</ref> The file formats were mainly from DOS-based programs.\n\n==== Binary ====\n[[OpenOffice.org]] has created documentation of the Excel format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sc.openoffice.org/excelfileformat.pdf |title=OpenOffice.org's documentation of the Microsoft Excel File Format |date=August 2, 2008 }}</ref> Since then Microsoft made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat(xls)Specification.xps |title=Microsoft Office Excel 97 - 2007 Binary File Format Specification (*.xls 97-2007 format) |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}</ref>\n\n==== XML Spreadsheet ====\n{{main|Microsoft Office XML formats}}\nThe ''XML Spreadsheet'' format introduced in Excel 2002<ref name=\"xml\" /> is a simple, [[XML]] based format missing some more advanced features like storage of VBA macros. Though the intended file extension for this format is ''.xml'', the program also correctly handles XML files with ''.xls'' extension. This feature is widely used by third-party applications (e.g. ''[[MySQL]] Query Browser'') to offer \"export to Excel\" capabilities without implementing binary file format. The following example will be correctly opened by Excel if saved either as ''Book1.xml'' or ''Book1.xls'':\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<Workbook xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet\"\n xmlns:o=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\"\n xmlns:x=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel\"\n xmlns:ss=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet\"\n xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40\">\n <Worksheet ss:Name=\"Sheet1\">\n  <Table ss:ExpandedColumnCount=\"2\" ss:ExpandedRowCount=\"2\" x:FullColumns=\"1\" x:FullRows=\"1\">\n   <Row>\n    <Cell><Data ss:Type=\"String\">Name</Data></Cell>\n    <Cell><Data ss:Type=\"String\">Example</Data></Cell>\n   </Row>\n   <Row>\n    <Cell><Data ss:Type=\"String\">Value</Data></Cell>\n    <Cell><Data ss:Type=\"Number\">123</Data></Cell>\n   </Row>\n  </Table>\n </Worksheet>\n</Workbook>\n</source>\n\n==== Current file extensions ====\n{{Main|Office Open XML}}\n\nMicrosoft Excel 2007, along with the other products in the [[Microsoft Office 2007]] suite, introduced new file formats.

These include opening Excel documents on the web using either [[ActiveX]] controls, or plugins like the [[Adobe Flash|Adobe Flash Player]]. The [[Apache POI]] [[opensource]] project provides [[Java platform|Java]] libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files. ExcelPackage is another open-source project that provides server-side generation of Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheets. [https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/ PHPExcel] is a PHP library that converts Excel5, Excel 2003, and Excel 2007 formats into objects for reading and writing within a web application. [[Excel Services]] is a current [[.NET Framework|.NET]] developer tool that can enhance Excel's capabilities. Excel spreadsheets can be accessed from [[Python (programming language)|Python]] with [https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd xlrd] and [https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl openpyxl].  [http://git.io/xlsx js-xlsx] and [http://git.io/xls js-xls] can open Excel spreadsheets from [[JavaScript]].\n\n=== Password protection ===\n{{Main|Microsoft Office password protection}}\n\nMicrosoft Excel protection offers several types of passwords:\n* Password to open a document <ref>{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/password-protect-documents-workbooks-and-presentations-HA010148333.aspx#BM1 |title=Password protect documents, workbooks, and presentations - Word - Office.com |publisher=Office.microsoft.com |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>\n* Password to modify a document <ref>{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/password-protect-documents-workbooks-and-presentations-HA010148333.aspx#BM3a |title=Password protect documents, workbooks, and presentations - Word - Office.com |publisher=Office.microsoft.com |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>\n* Password to unprotect worksheet\n* Password to protect workbook\n* Password to protect the sharing workbook <ref>{{cite web |url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/password-protect-worksheet-or-workbook-elements-HP005201059.aspx |title=Password protect worksheet or workbook elements - Excel - Office.com |publisher=Office.microsoft.com |accessdate=April 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326192849/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/password-protect-worksheet-or-workbook-elements-HP005201059.aspx |archivedate=March 26, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\nAll passwords except ''password to open a document'' can be removed instantly regardless of Microsoft Excel version used to create the document. These types of passwords are used primarily for shared work on a document. Such password-protected documents are not [[encrypted]], and a [[Computer file|data sources]] from a set password is saved in a document’s [[Header (computing)|header]]. ''Password to protect workbook'' is an exception – when it is set, a document is encrypted with the standard password “''VelvetSweatshop''”, but since it is known to public, it actually does not add any extra protection to the document. The only type of password that can prevent a trespasser from gaining access to a document is ''password to open a document''. The cryptographic strength of this kind of protection depends strongly on the Microsoft Excel version that was used to create the document.\n\nIn ''Microsoft Excel 95'' and earlier versions, password to open is converted to a 16-bit [[Key (cryptography)|key]] that can be instantly cracked. In ''Excel 97/2000'' the password is converted to a 40-bit key, which can also be cracked very quickly using modern equipment. As regards services which use [[rainbow tables]] (e.g. Password-Find), it takes up to several seconds to remove protection. In addition, password-cracking programs can [[brute-force attack]] passwords at a rate of hundreds of thousands of passwords a second, which not only lets them decrypt a document, but also find the original password.\n\nIn ''Excel 2003/XP'' the encryption is slightly better – a user can choose any encryption algorithm that is available in the system (see [[Cryptographic Service Provider]]). Due to the CSP, an ''Excel'' file can't be decrypted, and thus the ''password to open'' can't be removed, though the brute-force attack speed remains quite high. Nevertheless, the older ''Excel 97/2000'' algorithm is set by the default.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.oraxcel.com/projects/encoffice/help/How_safe_is_Word_encryption.html |title=How safe is Word encryption. Is it really secure? |publisher=Oraxcel.com |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, users who do not change the default settings lack reliable protection of their documents.\n\nThe situation changed fundamentally in ''Excel 2007'', where the modern [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] algorithm with a key of 128 bits started being used for decryption, and a 50,000-fold use of the hash function [[SHA1]] reduced the speed of brute-force attacks down to hundreds of passwords per second. In ''Excel 2010'', the strength of the protection by the default was increased two times due to the use of a 100,000-fold SHA1 to convert a password to a key.\n\n== Microsoft Excel Viewer == <!-- Anchor from redirect; caution. -->\nMicrosoft Excel Viewer was a freeware program for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel.<ref name=\"Support\">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/273711 ''Description of the Excel Viewer'']; [[Microsoft]] Support; accessed April 2014.</ref>.

But the displayed figures are ''not'' those actually used in its computations, and so, for example, the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values. Although such departures are usually beyond the 15th decimal, exceptions do occur, especially for very large or very small numbers. Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers (for example, using the Excel ''If'' function), as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the figure the fraction 1/9000 is displayed in Excel. Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones, Excel displays only the leading 15 figures. In the second line, the number one is added to the fraction, and again Excel displays only 15 figures. In the third line, one is subtracted from the sum using Excel. Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1's after the decimal, the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0's followed by a string of eleven 1's. However, the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0's followed by a string of ''thirteen'' 1's and two extra erroneous digits. This is because Excel calculates with about half a digit more than it displays.<!--\nNote: previously this paragraph contained the following sentence:\nMoreover, the error in Excel's answer is not just [[round-off error]].\nThis is erroneous, the result Excel displays is simple round-off error.

Multiplan became very popular on [[CP/M]] systems, but on [[MS-DOS]] systems it lost popularity to [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Macintosh on September 30, 1985, and the first Windows version was 2.05 (to synchronize with the Macintosh version 2.2) in November 1987.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA30&dq=macintosh%20spreadsheet%20arrow%20keys%20multiplan&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=InfoWorld First Look: Supercalc 4 challenging 1-2-3 with new tactic |author1=Infoworld Media Group, Inc. |date=July 7, 1986 }}</ref> Lotus was slow to bring 1-2-3 to Windows and by the early 1990s Excel had started to outsell 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer. This accomplishment solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future of developing [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] software. Microsoft maintained its advantage with regular new releases, every two years or so.\n\n=== Microsoft Windows ===\nExcel 2.0 is the first version of Excel for the [[Intel]] platform. Versions prior to 2.0 were only available on the Apple Macintosh.\n\n==== Excel 2.0 (1987) ====\nThe first Windows version was labeled \"2\" to correspond to the Mac version. This included a run-time version of Windows.<ref name=\"spreadsheetpage.com\">{{cite web|url=http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/resource/excel_version_history/|title=The Spreadsheet Page - John Walkenbach|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''[[BYTE]]'' in 1989 listed Excel for Windows as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the BYTE Awards.

VBA is a powerful addition to the application and includes a fully featured [[integrated development environment]] (IDE). [[Macro (computer science)|Macro]] recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions, thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks. VBA allows the creation of forms and in‑worksheet controls to communicate with the user. The language supports use (but not creation) of [[Component object model|ActiveX]] ([[Component object model|COM]]) [[Dynamic-Link Library|DLL]]'s; later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic [[object-oriented programming]] techniques.\n\nThe automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for [[Computer Virus#Macro viruses|macro viruses]]. This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses. [[Microsoft]] belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely, to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate.\n\nVersions 5.0 to 9.0 of Excel contain various [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]], including a \"Hall of Tortured Souls\", although since version&nbsp;10 [[Microsoft]] has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/10/21/483608.aspx |title=Why no Easter Eggs? |first=Larry |last=Osterman |date=October 21, 2005 |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |work=Larry Osterman's WebLog |publisher=MSDN Blogs }}</ref>\n\n5.0 was released in a 16-bit x86 version for Windows 3.1 and later in a 32-bit version for NT 3.51 (x86/Alpha/PowerPC)\n\n==== Excel 95 (v7.0) ====\n[[File:Screenshot of Microsoft Office Excel 95, an application part of Microsoft Office system.png|thumb|Microsoft Excel 95]]\nReleased in 1995 with [[Microsoft Office for Windows 95]], this is the first major version after Excel 5.0, as there is no Excel 6.0 with all of the Office applications standardizing on the same major version number.\n\nInternal rewrite to 32-bits. Almost no external changes, but faster and more stable.\n\n==== Excel 97 (v8.0) ====\nIncluded in [[Office 97]] (for x86 and Alpha).  This was a major upgrade that introduced the paper clip office assistant and featured standard VBA used instead of internal Excel Basic.  It introduced the now-removed Natural Language labels.\n\nThis version of Excel includes a flight simulator as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter Egg]].\n\n==== Excel 2000 (v9.0) ====\n[[File:FileScreenshot of Microsoft Office Excel 2000.png|thumb|Microsoft Excel 2000]]\nIncluded in [[Office 2000]].  This was a minor upgrade, but introduced an upgrade to the clipboard where it can hold multiple objects at once.  The Office Assistant, whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel 97 had annoyed many users, became less intrusive.\n\n==== Excel 2002 (v10.0) ====\nIncluded in [[Office XP]].  Very minor enhancements.\n\n==== Excel 2003 (v11.0) ====\nIncluded in [[Office 2003]]. Minor enhancements, most significant being the new Tables.\n\n==== Excel 2007 (v12.0) ====\n[[File:Microsoft Office Excel 2007.png|thumb|Microsoft Excel 2007]]\nIncluded in [[Office 2007]]. This release was a major upgrade from the previous version. Similar to other updated Office products, Excel in 2007 used the new [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]] menu system. This was different from what users were used to, and was met with mixed reactions. One study reported fairly good acceptance by users except highly experienced users and users of word processing applications with a classical [[WIMP interface]], but was less convinced in terms of efficiency and organisation.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Faro/DNCOCO/DNCOCO-25.pdf | title=User Acceptance of the Microsoft Ribbon User Interface | publisher=[[Palacký University of Olomouc]] | first=M | last=Dostál | isbn=978-960-474-245-5 | issn=1792-6157 |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> However, an online survey reported that a majority of respondents had a negative opinion of the change, with advanced users being \"somewhat more negative\" than intermediate users, and users reporting a [[self-estimated]] reduction in productivity.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.exceluser.com/explore/surveys/ribbon/ribbon-survey-results.htm | title=Ribbon survey results | publisher=ExcelUser | work=ExcelUser.com | first=Charley | last=Kyd|date = May 2009}}</ref>\n\nAdded functionality included the [[Microsoft Office 2007#SmartArt|SmartArt]] set of editable business diagrams. Also added was an improved management of named variables through the ''Name Manager'', and much improved flexibility in formatting graphs, which allow (''x, y'') coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight. Several improvements to pivot tables were introduced.\n\nAlso like other office products, the [[Office Open XML]] file formats were introduced, including ''.xlsm'' for a workbook with macros and ''.xlsx'' for a workbook without macros.<ref name=\"Dodge\">{{cite book  |title=Microsoft Office Excel 2007 inside out |first1=Mark |last1=Dodge |first2=Craig |last2=Stinson |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Press |isbn=978-0-7356-2321-7 |chapter=Chapter 1: What's new in Microsoft Office Excel 2007|page=1 ''ff'' }}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, many of the size limitations of previous versions were greatly increased. To illustrate, the number of rows was now 1,048,576 (2<sup>20</sup>) and columns was 16,384 (2<sup>14</sup>; the far-right column is XFD). This changes what is a valid ''A1''&nbsp;reference versus a named range. This version made more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets; however, VBA macros are not handled in parallel and XLL add‑ins were only executed in parallel if they were [[Thread safety|thread-safe]] and this was indicated at registration.\n\n==== Excel 2010 (v14.0) ====\n[[File:Excel 2010.png|thumb|Microsoft Excel 2010 running on Windows 7]]\nIncluded in [[Office 2010]], this is the next major version after v12.0, as version [[Triskaidekaphobia|number 13 was skipped]].\n\nMinor enhancements and 64-bit support,<ref name=\"whatsnew\">{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/what-s-new-in-excel-2010-HA010369709.aspx?CTT=1|title=What's New in Excel 2010 -

Excel 2.0 was released a month before Windows 2.0, and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in 1987 that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows 1.0 with Excel 2.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2005/11/20/happy-birthday-windows |title=Windows at 20: 20 things you didn't know about Windows 1.0 |last1=Perton |first1=Marc |date=November 20, 2005 |website=switched.com |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411221828/http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2005/11/20/happy-birthday-windows |archivedate=April 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Unlike Microsoft Word, there never was a DOS version of Excel.\n\nExcel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell recomputation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command).

      "text": "{{nofootnotes|date=June 2011}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''additive polynomials''' are an important topic in  classical [[algebraic number theory]]. \n\n==Definition==\nLet ''k'' be a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', with ''p'' a [[prime number]]. A [[polynomial]] ''P''(''x'') with coefficients in ''k'' is called an '''additive polynomial''', or a '''[[Frobenius endomorphism|Frobenius]] polynomial''', if \n\n:<math>P(a+b)=P(a)+P(b)\\,</math>\n\nas polynomials in ''a'' and ''b''. It is equivalent to assume that this equality holds for all ''a'' and ''b'' in some infinite field containing ''k'', such as its algebraic closure. \n\nOccasionally '''absolutely additive''' is used for the condition above, and '''additive''' is used for the weaker condition that ''P''(''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b'') = ''P''(''a'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''P''(''b'') for all ''a'' and ''b'' in the field. For infinite fields the conditions are equivalent, but for finite fields they are not, and the weaker condition is the \"wrong\" one and does not behave well. For example, over a field of order ''q'' any multiple ''P'' of ''x''<sup>''q''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x'' will satisfy ''P''(''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b'') = ''P''(''a'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''P''(''b'') for all ''a'' and ''b'' in the field, but will usually not be (absolutely) additive.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe polynomial ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> is additive. Indeed, for any ''a'' and ''b'' in the algebraic closure of ''k'' one has by the [[binomial theorem]]\n\n:<math>(a+b)^p = \\sum_{n=0}^p {p \\choose n} a^n b^{p-n}.</math>  \n\nSince ''p'' is prime,  for all ''n'' = 1, ..., ''p''−1 the [[binomial coefficient]] <math>\\scriptstyle{p \\choose n}</math> is divisible by ''p'', which implies that \n\n:<math>(a+b)^p \\equiv a^p+b^p \\mod p</math> \n\nas polynomials in ''a'' and ''b''.\n\nSimilarly all the polynomials of the form\n\n:<math>\\tau_p^n(x)=x^{p^n}</math>\n\nare additive, where ''n'' is a non-[[negative integer]].\n\nThe definition makes sense even if ''k'' is a field of characteristic zero, but in this case the only additive polynomials are those of the form ''ax'' for some ''a'' in ''k''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==The ring of additive polynomials==\nIt is quite easy to prove that any [[linear combination]] of polynomials <math>\\scriptstyle\\tau_p^n(x)</math> with coefficients in ''k'' is also an additive  polynomial. An interesting question is whether there are other additive  polynomials except these linear combinations. The answer is that these are the only ones.\n\nOne can check that if ''P''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') are  additive polynomials, then so are ''P''(''x'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''M''(''x'') and ''P''(''M''(''x'')). These imply that the  additive polynomials form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] under polynomial addition and composition. This ring is denoted \n\n:<math>k\\{ \\tau_p\\}.\\,</math>\n\nThis ring is not commutative unless ''k'' equals the field <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbb{F}_p=\\mathbf{Z}/p\\mathbf{Z}</math> (see [[modular arithmetic]]). Indeed, consider the additive polynomials ''ax'' and ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> for a coefficient ''a'' in ''k''. For them to commute under composition, we must have\n\n:<math>(ax)^p=ax^p,\\,</math>\n\nor  ''a''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;''a'' = 0.  This is false for ''a'' not a root of this equation, that is, for ''a'' outside <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbb{F}_p.</math>\n\n==The fundamental theorem of additive polynomials==\nLet ''P''(''x'') be a polynomial with coefficients in ''k'', and <math>\\scriptstyle\\{w_1,\\dots,w_m\\}\\subset k</math> be the set of its roots. Assuming that the roots of ''P''(''x'') are distinct (that is, ''P''(''x'') is [[separable polynomial|separable]]), then ''P''(''x'') is additive if and only if the set <math>\\scriptstyle\\{w_1,\\dots,w_m\\}</math> forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with the field addition.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drinfeld module]]\n*[[Additive map]]\n\n==References==\n* [[David Goss]], ''Basic Structures of Function Field Arithmetic'', 1996, Springer, Berlin. {{ISBN|3-540-61087-1}}.\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathWorld|title=Additive Polynomial|urlname=AdditivePolynomial}}\n\n[[Category:Algebraic number theory]]\n[[Category:Modular arithmetic]]\n[[Category:Field theory]]\n[[Category:Polynomials]]"

      "text": "{{Expand French|Équation polynomiale|topic=sci|date=August 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic equation''' or '''polynomial equation''' is an [[equation]] of the form\n:<math>P = Q</math>\nwhere ''P'' and ''Q'' are [[polynomial]]s with [[coefficient]]s in some [[field (mathematics)|field]], often the field of the [[rational number]]s. For most authors, an algebraic equation is ''univariate'', which means that it involves only one [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called ''multivariate'' and the term ''polynomial equation'' is usually preferred to ''algebraic equation''.\n\nFor example,\n:<math>x^5-3x+1=0</math> \nis an algebraic equation with integer coefficients and\n:<math>y^4+\\frac{xy}{2}=\\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\\frac{1}{7}</math>\nis a multivariate polynomial equation over the rationals.\n\nSome but not all polynomial equations with [[Rational number|rational coefficients]] have a solution that is an [[algebraic expression]] that can be found using a finite number of operations that involve only those same types of coefficients (that is, can be [[Algebraic solution|solved algebraically]]). This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but for degree five or more it can only be done for some equations, [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|not for all]]. A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see [[Root-finding algorithm]]) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see [[System of polynomial equations]]).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe study of algebraic equations is probably as old as mathematics: the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian mathematicians]], as early as 2000 BC could solve some kinds of [[quadratic equation]]s (displayed on [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian]] [[clay tablet]]s).\n\nUnivariate algebraic equations over the rationals (i.e., with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients) have a very long history. Ancient mathematicians wanted the solutions in the form of [[radical expression]]s, like <math>x=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}</math> for the positive solution of <math>x^2-x-1=0</math>. The ancient Egyptians knew how to solve equations of degree 2 in this manner. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (597–668 AD) explicitly described the quadratic formula in his treatise Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta published in 628 AD, but written in words instead of symbols. In the 9th century [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] and other Islamic mathematicians derived the [[quadratic formula]], the general solution of equations of degree 2, and recognized the importance of the [[discriminant]].  During the Renaissance in 1545, [[Gerolamo Cardano]] published the solution of  [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] to [[Cubic function|equations of degree 3]] and that of  [[Lodovico Ferrari]] for [[Quartic function|equations of degree 4]]. Finally [[Niels Henrik Abel]] proved, in 1824, that [[quintic equation|equations of degree 5]] and higher do not have general solutions using radicals. [[Galois theory]], named after [[Évariste Galois]], showed that some equations of at least degree 5 do not even have an idiosyncratic solution in radicals, and gave criteria for deciding if an equation is in fact solvable using radicals.\n\n== Areas of study ==\n\nThe algebraic equations are the basis of a number of areas of modern mathematics: [[Algebraic number theory]] is the study of (univariate) algebraic equations over the rationals (that is, with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients). [[Galois theory]] was introduced by [[Évariste Galois]] to specify criteria for deciding if an algebraic equation may be solved in terms of radicals. In [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], an [[algebraic extension]] is an extension such that every element is a root of an algebraic equation over the base field. [[Transcendental number theory]] is the study of the real numbers which are not solutions to an algebraic equation over the rationals. A [[Diophantine equation]] is a (usually multivariate) polynomial equation with integer coefficients for which one is interested in the integer solutions. [[Algebraic geometry]] is the study of the solutions in an [[algebraically closed field]] of multivariate polynomial equations.\n\nTwo equations are equivalent if they have the same set of [[Equation|solutions]]. In particular the equation <math>P = Q</math> is equivalent to <math>P-Q = 0</math>. It follows that the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials.\n\nA polynomial equation over the rationals can always be converted to an equivalent one in which the [[coefficient]]s are [[integer]]s. For example, multiplying through by 42 = 2·3·7 and grouping its terms in the first member, the previously mentioned polynomial equation <math>y^4+\\frac{xy}{2}=\\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\\frac{1}{7}</math> becomes\n:<math>42y^4+21xy-14x^3+42xy^2-42y^2+6=0.</math>\n\nBecause [[sine]], [[exponentiation]], and 1/''T'' are not polynomial functions,\n:<math>e^T x^2+\\frac{1}{T}xy+\\sin(T)z -2 =0</math>\nis ''not'' a polynomial equation in the four variables ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''T'' over the rational numbers. However, it is a polynomial equation in the three variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' over the field of the [[elementary function]]s in the variable ''T''.\n\n==Solutions==\n{{Main|Polynomial#Solving polynomial equations}}\n\nAs for any equation, the ''solutions'' of an equation are the values of the variables for which the equation is true. For univariate algebraic equations these are also called '''roots''', even if, properly speaking, one should say ''the '''solutions''' of the algebraic equation'' ''P''=0 ''are the '''roots''' of the polynomial'' ''P''. When solving an equation, it is important to specify in which [[Set (mathematics)|set]] the solutions are allowed. For example, for an equation over the rationals one may look for solutions in which all the variables are integers.  In this case the equation is a [[Diophantine equation]]. One may also be interested only in the real solutions. However, for univariate algebraic equations, the number of solutions is finite, and all solutions are contained in any [[algebraically closed field]] containing the coefficients&mdash;for example, the field of complex numbers in the case of equations over the rationals. It follows that without precision \"root\" and \"solution\" usually mean \"solution in an algebraically closed field\".\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Algebraic function]]\n* [[Algebraic number]]\n* [[Root finding]]\n* [[Linear equation]] (degree = 1)\n* [[Quadratic equation]] (degree = 2)\n* [[Cubic equation]] (degree = 3)\n* [[Quartic equation]] (degree = 4)\n* [[Quintic equation]] (degree = 5)\n* [[Sextic equation]] (degree = 6)\n* [[Septic equation]] (degree = 7)\n* [[System of linear equations]]\n* [[System of polynomial equations]]\n* [[Linear Diophantine equation]]\n* [[Linear equation over a ring]]\n* [[Cramer's theorem (algebraic curves)]], on the number of points usually sufficient to determine a bivariate ''n''-th degree curve\n\n==References==\n* {{springer|title=Algebraic equation|id=p/a011480}}\n* {{MathWorld|title=Algebraic Equation|urlname=AlgebraicEquation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Algebraic Equation}}\n[[Category:Polynomials]]\n[[Category:Equations]]"

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Type of polynomial sequence}}\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''Appell sequence''', named after [[Paul Émile Appell]], is any [[polynomial sequence]] <math>\\{p_n(x)\\}_{n=0,1,2,\\ldots}</math> satisfying the identity\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx} p_n(x) = np_{n-1}(x),</math>\n\nand in which <math>p_0(x)</math> is a non-zero constant.\n\nAmong the most notable Appell sequences besides the trivial example <math>\\{x^n\\}</math> are the [[Hermite polynomials]], the [[Bernoulli polynomials]], and the [[Euler polynomials]]. Every Appell sequence is a [[Sheffer sequence]], but most Sheffer sequences are not Appell sequences.\n\n==Equivalent characterizations of Appell sequences==\n\nThe following conditions on polynomial sequences can easily be seen to be equivalent:\n\n* For <math>n = 1, 2, 3,\\ldots</math>,\n\n::<math>\\frac{d}{dx} p_n(x) = n p_{n-1}(x)</math>\n\n:and <math>p_0(x)</math> is a non-zero constant;\n\n* For some sequence <math display=\"inline\">\\{c_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> of scalars with <math>c_0 \\neq 0</math>,\n\n::<math>p_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} c_k x^{n-k};</math>\n\n* For the same sequence of scalars,\n\n::<math>p_n(x) = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{c_k}{k!} D^k\\right) x^n,</math>\n\n:where\n\n::<math>D = \\frac{d}{dx};</math>\n\n* For <math>n=0,1,2,\\ldots</math>,\n\n::<math>p_n(x+y) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} p_k(x) y^{n-k}.</math>\n\n==Recursion formula==\n\nSuppose\n\n:<math>p_n(x) = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {c_k \\over k!} D^k\\right) x^n = Sx^n,</math>\n\nwhere the last equality is taken to define the linear operator <math>S</math> on the space of polynomials in <math>x</math>.  Let\n\n:<math>T = S^{-1} = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{c_k}{k!} D^k\\right)^{-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{k!} D^k</math>\n\nbe the inverse operator, the coefficients <math>a_k</math> being those of the usual reciprocal of a [[formal power series]], so that\n\n:<math>Tp_n(x) = x^n.\\,</math>\n\nIn the conventions of the [[umbral calculus]], one often treats this formal power series <math>T</math> as representing the Appell sequence <math>p_n</math>.  One can define\n\n:<math>\\log T = \\log\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{k!} D^k \\right) </math>\n\nby using the usual power series expansion of the <math>\\log(x)</math> and the usual definition of composition of formal power series.  Then we have\n\n:<math>p_{n+1}(x) = (x - (\\log T)')p_n(x).\\,</math>\n\n(This formal differentiation of a power series in the differential operator <math>D</math> is an instance of [[Pincherle derivative|Pincherle differentiation]].)\n\nIn the case of [[Hermite polynomials]], this reduces to the conventional recursion formula for that sequence.\n\n==Subgroup of the Sheffer polynomials==\n\nThe set of all Appell sequences is closed under the operation of umbral composition of polynomial sequences, defined as follows.  Suppose <math>\\{p_n(x) \\colon n=0,1,2,\\ldots\\}</math> and <math>\\{q_n(x) \\colon n=0,1,2,\\ldots\\}</math> are polynomial sequences, given by\n\n:<math>p_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n,k}x^k \\text{ and } q_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n b_{n,k}x^k.</math>\n\nThen the umbral composition <math>p \\circ q </math> is the polynomial sequence whose <math>n</math>th term is\n\n:<math>(p_n\\circ q)(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n,k}q_k(x)=\\sum_{0\\le k \\le \\ell \\le n} a_{n,k}b_{k,\\ell}x^\\ell</math>\n\n(the subscript <math>n</math> appears in <math>p_n</math>, since this is the <math>n</math>th term of that sequence, but not in <math>q</math>, since this refers to the sequence as a whole rather than one of its terms).\n\nUnder this operation, the set of all Sheffer sequences is a [[non-abelian group]], but the set of all Appell sequences is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[subgroup]].  That it is abelian can be seen by considering the fact that every Appell sequence is of the form\n\n:<math>p_n(x) = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{c_k}{k!} D^k\\right) x^n,</math>\n\nand that umbral composition of Appell sequences corresponds to multiplication of these [[formal power series]] in the operator <math>D</math>.\n\n==Different convention==\n\nAnother convention followed by some authors (see ''Chihara'') defines this concept in a different way, conflicting with Appell's original definition, by using the identity\n\n:<math>{d \\over dx} p_n(x) = p_{n-1}(x)</math>\n\ninstead.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Sheffer sequence]]\n* [[Umbral calculus]]\n* [[Generalized Appell polynomials]]\n* [[Wick product]]\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite journal|first1=Paul |last1=Appell\n|title=Sur une classe de polynômes\n|journal=Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure |series=2e Série\n|year=1880|volume=9 | pages=119–144|url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1880_2_9__119_0}}\n* {{cite journal|first1= Steven\n|last1= Roman |first2=Gian-Carlo |last2= Rota\n|title=The Umbral Calculus\n|journal=Advances in Mathematics\n|volume =27|number=2\n|pages=95–188 |year=1978 |doi = 10.1016/0001-8708(78)90087-7 }}.\n* {{cite journal | first1=Gian-Carlo |last1=Rota| first2=D.\n|last2= Kahaner | first3=Andrew |last3= Odlyzko|title=Finite Operator Calculus |pages=685–760\n|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications\n|volume=42 |number=3|year=1973 | doi=10.1016/0022-247X(73)90172-8}}  Reprinted in the book with the same title, Academic Press, New York, 1975.\n* {{cite book | author=Steven Roman | title= The Umbral Calculus | publisher= [[Dover Publications]]}}\n* {{cite book | author=Theodore Seio Chihara | title= An Introduction to Orthogonal Polynomials | publisher= Gordon and Breach, New York | year=1978 | isbn = 978-0-677-04150-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Appell polynomials|id=p/a012800}}\n* [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AppellSequence.html Appell Sequence] at [[MathWorld]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Appell Sequence}}\n[[Category:Polynomials]]"

      "text": "{{for|a different family of polynomials B<sub>n</sub>''(''x'')'' occasionally called Bell polynomials|Touchard polynomials}}\n\nIn [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], the '''Bell polynomials''', named in honor of [[Eric Temple Bell]], are used in the study of set partitions. They are related to [[Stirling numbers|Stirling]] and [[Bell numbers]]. They also occur in many applications, such as in the [[Faà di Bruno's formula]].\n\n==Bell polynomials==\n\n===Exponential Bell polynomials===\nThe ''partial'' or ''incomplete'' exponential Bell polynomials are a [[triangular array]] of polynomials given by\n\n:<math>B_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_{n-k+1}) = \\sum{n! \\over j_1!j_2!\\cdots j_{n-k+1}!}\n\\left({x_1\\over 1!}\\right)^{j_1}\\left({x_2\\over 2!}\\right)^{j_2}\\cdots\\left({x_{n-k+1} \\over (n-k+1)!}\\right)^{j_{n-k+1}},</math>\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all sequences ''j''<sub>1</sub>, ''j''<sub>2</sub>, ''j''<sub>3</sub>, ..., ''j''<sub>''n''−''k''+1</sub> of non-negative integers such that these two conditions are satisfied:\n\n:<math>j_1 + j_2 + \\cdots + j_{n-k+1} = k, </math> \n:<math>j_1 + 2 j_2 + 3 j_3 + \\cdots + (n-k+1)j_{n-k+1} = n.</math>\n\nThe sum\n\n:<math>B_n(x_1,\\dots,x_n)=\\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_{n-k+1})</math>\n\nis called the ''n''th '''complete exponential Bell polynomial'''.\n\n===Ordinary Bell polynomials===\nLikewise, the partial ''ordinary'' Bell polynomial, in contrast to the usual exponential Bell polynomial defined above, is given by\n\n:<math>\\hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) = \\sum \\frac{k!}{j_1! j_2! \\cdots j_{n-k+1}!} x_1^{j_1} x_2^{j_2} \\cdots x_{n-k+1}^{j_{n-k+1}}, </math>\n\nwhere the sum runs over all sequences ''j''<sub>1</sub>, ''j''<sub>2</sub>, ''j''<sub>3</sub>, ..., ''j''<sub>''n''−''k''+1</sub> of non-negative integers such that\n\n:<math>j_1 + j_2 + \\cdots + j_{n-k+1} = k,</math>\n:<math>j_1 + 2 j_2 + \\cdots + (n-k+1)j_{n-k+1} = n.</math>\n\nThe ordinary Bell polynomials can be expressed in the terms of exponential Bell polynomials:\n:<math>\\hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) = \\frac{k!}{n!}B_{n,k}(1!\\cdot x_1,2!\\cdot x_2,\\ldots,(n-k+1)!\\cdot x_{n-k+1}).</math>\n\nIn general, Bell polynomial refers to the exponential Bell polynomial, unless otherwise explicitly stated.\n\n==Combinatorial meaning==\n\nThe exponential Bell polynomial encodes the information related to the ways a set can be partitioned. For example, if we consider a set {A, B, C}, it can be partitioned into two non-empty, non-overlapping subsets, which is also referred to as parts or blocks, in 3 different ways:\n\n:{{A}, {B, C}}\n:{{B}, {A, C}}\n:{{C}, {B, A}}\n\nThus, we can encode the information regarding these partitions as\n\n:<math>B_{3,2}(x_1,x_2) = 3 x_1 x_2. </math>\n\nHere, the subscripts of ''B''<sub>3,2</sub> tells us that we are considering the partitioning of set with 3 elements into 2 blocks. The subscript of each ''x''<sub>i</sub> indicates the presence of block with ''i'' elements (or block of size ''i'') in a given partition. So here, ''x''<sub>2</sub> indicates the presence of a block with two elements. Similarly, ''x''<sub>1</sub> indicates the presence of a block with a single element. The exponent of ''x''<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> indicates that there are ''j'' such blocks of size ''i'' in a single partition. Here, since both ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub> has exponent 1, it indicates that there is only one such block in a given partition. The coefficient of the [[monomial]] indicates how many such partitions there are. For our case, there are 3 partitions of a set with 3 elements into 2 blocks, where in each partition the elements are divided into two blocks of sizes 1 and 2.\n\nSince any set can be divided into a single block in only one way, the above interpretation would mean that ''B''<sub>''n'',1</sub> = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>. Similarly, since there is only one way that a set with ''n'' elements be divided into ''n'' singletons, ''B''<sub>''n'',''n''</sub> = ''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nAs a more complicated example, consider\n\n:<math>B_{6,2}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)=6x_5x_1+15x_4x_2+10x_3^2.</math>\n\nThis tells us that if a set with 6 elements is divided into 2 blocks, then we can have 6 partitions with blocks of size 1 and 5, 15 partitions with blocks of size 4 and 2, and 10 partitions with 2 blocks of size 3.\n\nNote that the sum of the subscripts in a monomials is equal to the total number of elements. Thus, the number of monomials that appear in the partial Bell polynomial is equal to the number of ways the integer ''n'' can be expressed as a summation of ''k'' positive integers. This is the same as the [[integer partition]] of ''n'' into ''k'' parts. For instance, in the above examples, the integer 3 can be partitioned into two parts as 2+1 only. Thus, there is only one monomial in ''B''<sub>3,2</sub>. However, the integer 6 can be partitioned into two parts as 5+1, 4+2, and 3+3. Thus, there are three monomials in ''B''<sub>6,2</sub>.  Indeed, the subscripts of the variables in a monomial are the same as those given by the integer partition, indicating the sizes of the different blocks. The total number of monomials appearing in a complete Bell polynomial ''B<sub>n</sub>'' is thus equal to the total number of integer partitions of&nbsp;''n''.\n\nAlso note that the degree of each monomial, which is the sum of the exponents of each variable in the monomial, is equal to the number of blocks the set is divided into. That is, ''j''<sub>1</sub> + ''j''<sub>2</sub> + ... = ''k'' . Thus, given a complete Bell polynomial ''B<sub>n</sub>'', we can separate the partial Bell polynomial ''B<sub>n,k</sub>'' by collecting all those monomials with degree ''k''.\n\nFinally, if we disregard the sizes of the blocks and put all ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''x'', then the summation of the coefficients of the partial Bell polynomial ''B''<sub>''n'',''k''</sub> will give the total number of ways that a set with ''n'' elements can be partitioned into ''k'' blocks, which is the same as the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]. Also, the summation of all the coefficients of the complete Bell polynomial ''B<sub>n</sub>'' will give us the total number of ways a set with ''n'' elements can be partitioned into non-overlapping subsets, which is the same as the Bell number.\n\nIn general, if the integer ''n'' is [[integer partition|partitioned]] into a sum in which \"1\" appears ''j''<sub>1</sub> times, \"2\" appears ''j''<sub>2</sub> times, and so on, then the number of [[partition of a set|partitions of a set]] of size ''n'' that collapse to that partition of the integer ''n'' when the members of the set become indistinguishable is the corresponding coefficient in the polynomial.\n\n===Examples===\n\nFor example, we have\n\n:<math>B_{6,2}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)=6x_5x_1+15x_4x_2+10x_3^2</math>\n\nbecause there are\n\n:6 ways to partition a set of 6 as 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,\n:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, and\n:10 ways to partition a set of 6 as 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n:<math>B_{6,3}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=15x_4x_1^2+60x_3x_2x_1+15x_2^3</math>\n\nbecause there are\n\n:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,\n:60 ways to partition a set of 6 as 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, and\n:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Generating function===\nThe exponential partial Bell polynomials can be defined by the double series expansion of its generating function:\n\n:<math> \n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(t,u) &= \\exp\\left( u \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x_j \\frac{t^j}{j!} \\right) = \\sum_{n,k \\geq 0} B_{n,k}(x_1,\\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) \\frac{t^n}{n!} u^k\\\\\n &= 1 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^n}{n!} \\sum_{k=1}^n u^k B_{n,k}(x_1,\\ldots,x_{n-k+1})\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn other words, by what amounts to the same, by the series expansion of the exponential:\n:<math> \\frac{1}{k!}\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x_j \\frac{t^j}{j!} \\right)^k = \\sum_{n=k}^\\infty B_{n,k}(x_1,\\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) \\frac{t^n}{n!}, \\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots  </math>\n \nThe complete exponential Bell polynomial is defined by <math>\\Phi(t,1)</math>, or in other words:\n\n:<math> \\Phi(t,1) = \\exp\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x_j \\frac{t^j}{j!} \\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty B_n(x_1,\\ldots, x_n) \\frac{t^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nThus, the ''n''-th complete Bell polynomial is given by\n:<math> B_n(x_1,\\ldots, x_n) = \\left. \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right)^n \\exp\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x_j \\frac{t^j}{j!} \\right) \\right|_{t=0}. </math>\n\nLikewise, the ''ordinary'' partial Bell polynomial can be defined by the generating function\n:<math> \\hat{\\Phi}(t,u) = \\exp \\left( u \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x_j t^j \\right) = \\sum_{n \\geq k \\geq 1} \\hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1,\\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) t^n \\frac{u^k}{k!}.</math>\n\nOr, equivalently, by series expansion of the exponential\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x_j t^j\\right)^k = \\sum_{n=k}^\\infty \\hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-k+1}) t^n. </math>\n\nSee also [[Generating_function_transformation#Powers_of_an_OGF_and_composition_with_functions|generating function transformations]] for Bell polynomial generating function expansions of compositions of sequence [[generating functions]] and [[Exponentiation|powers]], [[logarithm]]s, and [[exponential function|exponentials]] of a sequence generating function.

Such computations are needed for precision measurements in elementary particle physics as practiced for instance at [[CERN]] (see the papers citing {{harv|Tkachov|1997}}).

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Bézout matrix''' (or '''Bézoutian''' or '''Bezoutiant''') is a special [[matrix (mathematics)#Square matrices and related definitions|square matrix]] associated with two [[polynomial]]s, introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=James Joseph|last=Sylvester|authorlink=James Joseph Sylvester|year=1853}} and {{harvs|txt|first=Arthur|last=Cayley|year=1857|authorlink=Arthur Cayley}} and named after [[Étienne Bézout]].  '''Bézoutian''' may also refer to the [[determinant]] of this matrix, which is equal to the [[resultant]] of the two polynomials. Bézout matrices are sometimes used to test the [[stable polynomial|stability]] of a given polynomial.\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>f(z)</math> and <math>g(z)</math> be two complex polynomials of degree at most ''n'',\n:<math>f(z)=\\sum_{i=0}^n u_i z^i,\\quad\\quad g(z)=\\sum_{i=0}^n v_i z^i.</math>\n(Note that any coefficient <math>u_i</math> or <math>v_i</math> could be zero.) The '''Bézout matrix''' of order ''n'' associated with the polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' is \n:<math>B_n(f,g)=\\left(b_{ij}\\right)_{i,j=0,\\dots,n-1}</math>\nwhere the entries <math>b_{ij}</math> result from the identity\n:<math>\n  \\frac{f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(x)}{x-y}\n     =\\sum_{i,j=0}^{n-1} b_{ij}\\,x^{i}\\,y^{j}.\n</math>\n\nIt is in <math>\\Complex^{n\\times n}</math> and the entries of that matrix are such that if we let <math>m_{ij}=\\min\\{i,n-1-j\\}</math> for each <math>i, j = 0, \\dots, n-1</math>, then:\n:<math>b_{ij}=\\sum_{k=0}^{m_{ij}}u_{j+k+1}v_{i-k}-u_{i-k}v_{j+k+1}.</math>\n\nTo each Bézout matrix, one can associate the following [[bilinear form]], called the Bézoutian:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Bez}:\\Complex^n\\times\\Complex^n\\to \\Complex:(x,y)\\mapsto \\operatorname{Bez}(x,y)=x^*B_n(f,g)y.</math>\n\n==Examples==\n* For ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, we have for any polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' of degree (at most) 3:\n::<math>B_3(f,g)=\\left[\\begin{matrix}u_1v_0-u_0 v_1 & u_2 v_0-u_0 v_2 & u_3 v_0-u_0 v_3\\\\u_2 v_0-u_0 v_2 & u_2v_1-u_1v_2+u_3v_0-u_0v_3 & u_3 v_1-u_1v_3\\\\u_3v_0-u_0v_3 & u_3v_1-u_1v_3 & u_3v_2-u_2v_3\\end{matrix}\\right].</math>\n\n* Let <math>f(x)=3x^3-x</math> and <math>g(x)=5x^2+1</math> be two polynomials.  Then:\n::<math>B_4(f,g)=\\left[\\begin{matrix}-1 & 0 & 3 & 0\\\\0 &8 &0 &0 \\\\3&0&15&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\end{matrix}\\right].</math>\nThe last row and column are all zero as ''f'' and ''g'' have degree strictly less than ''n'' (equal 4).  The other zero entries are because for each <math>i = 0, \\dots, n</math>, either <math>u_i</math> or <math>v_i</math> is zero.\n\n==Properties==\n* <math>B_n(f,g)</math> is symmetric (as a matrix);\n* <math>B_n(f,g)=-B_n(g,f)</math>;\n* <math>B_n(f,f)=0</math>;\n* <math>B_n(f,g)</math> is [[bilinear map|bilinear]] in (''f'',''g'');\n* <math>B_n(f,g)</math> is in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}</math> if ''f'' and ''g'' have real coefficients;\n* <math>B_n(f,g)</math> is nonsingular with <math>n=\\max(\\deg(f),\\deg(g))</math> if and only if ''f'' and ''g'' have no common roots.\n* <math>B_n(f,g)</math> with <math>n=\\max(\\deg(f),\\deg(g))</math> has [[determinant]] which is the [[resultant]] of ''f'' and ''g''.\n\n==Applications==\nAn important application of Bézout matrices can be found in [[control theory]].  To see this, let ''f''(''z'') be a complex polynomial of degree ''n'' and denote by ''q'' and ''p'' the real polynomials such that ''f''(i''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''(''y'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;i''p''(''y'') (where ''y'' is real).  We also note ''r'' for the rank and ''&sigma;'' for the signature of <math>B_n(p,q)</math>.  Then, we have the following statements:\n* ''f''(''z'') has ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''r'' roots in common with its conjugate;\n* the left ''r'' roots of ''f''(''z'') are located in such a way that:\n** (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''&sigma;'')/2 of them lie in the open left half-plane, and\n** (''r''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''&sigma;'')/2 lie in the open right half-plane;\n* ''f'' is [[stable polynomial|Hurwitz stable]] [[if and only if]] <math>B_n(p,q)</math> is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]].\n\nThe third statement gives a necessary and sufficient condition concerning stability.  Besides, the first statement exhibits some similarities with a result concerning [[Sylvester matrix|Sylvester matrices]] while the second one can be related to [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]].\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Cayley | first1=Arthur | author1-link=Arthur Cayley | title=Note sur la methode d'elimination de Bezout | year=1857 | url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN002149818 | journal= J.

      "title": "Binomial type",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_type",
      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Type of polynomial sequence}}\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[polynomial sequence]], i.e., a sequence of [[polynomial]]s indexed by non-negative integers <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{0, 1, 2, 3, ... \\right\\}</math> in which the index of each polynomial equals its [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]], is said to be of '''binomial type''' if it satisfies the sequence of identities\n:<math>p_n(x+y)=\\sum_{k=0}^n{n \\choose k}\\, p_k(x)\\, p_{n-k}(y).</math>\n\nMany such sequences exist.  The set of all such sequences forms a [[Lie group]] under the operation of umbral composition, explained below. Every sequence of binomial type may be expressed in terms of the [[Bell polynomial]]s. Every sequence of binomial type is a [[Sheffer sequence]] (but most Sheffer sequences are not of binomial type).  Polynomial sequences put on firm footing the vague 19th century notions of [[umbral calculus]].\n\n==Examples==\n* In consequence of this definition the [[binomial theorem]] can be stated by saying that the sequence { ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ... } is of binomial type.\n* The sequence of \"[[lower factorial]]s\" is defined by\n\n::<math>(x)_n=x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot(x-n+1).</math>\n\n:(In the theory of special functions, this same notation denotes [[upper factorial]]s, but this present usage is universal among [[combinatorics|combinatorialists]].) The product is understood to be 1 if ''n'' = 0, since it is in that case an [[empty product]].  This polynomial sequence is of binomial type.\n\n* Similarly the \"[[upper factorial]]s\"\n\n::<math>x^{(n)}=x(x+1)(x+2)\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot(x+n-1)</math>\n\n:are a polynomial sequence of binomial type.\n\n* The [[Abel polynomials]]\n\n::<math>p_n(x)=x(x-an)^{n-1} \\,</math>\n\n:are a polynomial sequence of binomial type.\n\n* The [[Touchard polynomials]]\n\n::<math>p_n(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)x^k</math>\n\n:where ''S''(''n'', ''k'') is the number of partitions of a set of size ''n'' into ''k'' disjoint non-empty subsets, is a polynomial sequence of binomial type.  [[Eric Temple Bell]] called these the \"exponential polynomials\" and that term is also sometimes seen in the literature.  The coefficients ''S''(''n'', ''k'' ) are \"[[Stirling number]]s of the second kind\".  This sequence has a curious connection with the [[Poisson distribution]]: If ''X'' is a [[random variable]] with a Poisson distribution with expected value &lambda; then E(''X''<sup>''n''</sup>) = ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>(&lambda;).  In particular, when &lambda; = 1, we see that the ''n''th moment of the Poisson distribution with expected value 1 is the number of partitions of a set of size ''n'', called the ''n''th [[Bell numbers|Bell number]].  This fact about the ''n''th moment of that particular Poisson distribution is \"[[Bell numbers|Dobinski's formula]]\".\n\n==Characterization by delta operators==\nIt can be shown that a polynomial sequence { ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>(x) : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ... } is of binomial type if and only if all three of the following conditions hold:\n\n* The [[linear transformation]] on the space of polynomials in ''x'' that is characterized by\n\n::<math>p_n(x)\\mapsto np_{n-1}(x)</math>\n\n:is [[shift-equivariant]], and\n\n* ''p''<sub>0</sub>(''x'') = 1 for all ''x'', and\n* ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>(0) = 0 for ''n'' > 0.\n\n(The statement that this operator is shift-equivariant is the same as saying that the polynomial sequence is a [[Sheffer sequence]]; the set of sequences of binomial type is properly included within the set of Sheffer sequences.)\n\n===Delta operators===\nThat linear transformation is clearly a [[delta operator]], i.e., a shift-equivariant linear transformation on the space of polynomials in ''x'' that reduces degrees of polynomials by 1.  The most obvious examples of delta operators are [[difference operator]]s and differentiation.  It can be shown that every delta operator can be written as a [[power series]] of the form\n:<math>Q=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n D^n</math>\nwhere ''D'' is differentiation (note that the lower bound of summation is 1).  Each delta operator ''Q'' has a unique sequence of \"basic polynomials\", i.e., a polynomial sequence satisfying\n#<math>p_0(x)=1, \\,</math>\n#<math>p_n(0)=0\\quad{\\rm for\\ }n\\geq 1,{\\rm\\ and}</math>\n#<math>Qp_n(x)=np_{n-1}(x). \\,</math>\nIt was shown in 1973 by [[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], Kahaner, and [[Andrew Odlyzko|Odlyzko]], that a polynomial sequence is of binomial type if and only if it is the sequence of basic polynomials of some delta operator.  Therefore, this paragraph amounts to a recipe for generating as many polynomial sequences of binomial type as one may wish.\n\n==Characterization by Bell polynomials==\nFor any sequence ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub>, ... of scalars, let\n\n:<math>p_n(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(a_1,\\dots,a_{n-k+1}) x^k</math>\n\nwhere ''B''<sub>''n'',''k''</sub>(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;''k''+1</sub>) is the [[Bell polynomials|Bell polynomial]].  Then this polynomial sequence is of binomial type.  Note that for each ''n'' ≥ 1,\n\n:<math>p_n'(0)=a_n.\\,</math>\n\nHere is the main result of this section:\n\n'''Theorem:''' All polynomial sequences of binomial type are of this form.\n\nA result in Mullin and Rota, repeated in Rota, Kahaner, and Odlyzko (see ''References'' below) states that every polynomial sequence {&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;}<sub>''n''</sub> of binomial type is determined by the sequence {&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>&prime;(0)&nbsp;}<sub>''n''</sub>, but those sources do not mention Bell polynomials.\n\nThis sequence of scalars is also related to the delta operator.  Let\n\n:<math>P(t)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n!} t^n.</math>\n\nThen\n\n:<math>P^{-1}\\left({d \\over dx}\\right)\\,</math>\n\nis the delta operator of this sequence.\n\n==Characterization by a convolution identity==\nFor sequences ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., define a sort of [[convolution]] by\n\n:<math>(a \\mathbin{\\diamondsuit} b)_n = \\sum_{j=0}^n {n \\choose j} a_j b_{n-j}.</math>\n\nLet <math>a_n^{k\\diamondsuit}\\,</math> be the ''n''th term of the sequence\n\n:<math>\\underbrace{a\\mathbin{\\diamondsuit}\\cdots\\mathbin{\\diamondsuit} a}_{k\\text{ factors}}.\\,</math>\n\nThen for any sequence ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., with ''a''<sub>0</sub> = 0, the sequence defined by ''p''<sub>0</sub>(''x'') = 1 and\n\n:<math>p_n(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^n {a_n^{k\\diamondsuit} x^k \\over k!}\\,</math>\n\nfor ''n'' ≥ 1, is of binomial type, and every sequence of binomial type is of this form.  This result is due to Alessandro di Bucchianico (see '''References''' below).\n\n==Characterization by generating functions==\nPolynomial sequences of binomial type are precisely those whose [[generating function]]s are formal (not necessarily convergent) [[power series]] of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {p_n(x) \\over n!}t^n=e^{xf(t)}</math>\n\nwhere ''f''(''t'') is a formal power series whose [[constant term]] is zero and whose first-degree term is not zero.  It can be shown by the use of the power-series version of [[Faà di Bruno's formula]] that\n\n:<math>f(t)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {p_n\\,'(0) \\over n!}t^n.</math>\n\nThe delta operator of the sequence is ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''D''), so that\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(D)p_n(x)=np_{n-1}(x).</math>\n\n===A way to think about these generating functions===\nThe coefficients in the product of two formal power series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {a_n \\over n!}t^n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {b_n \\over n!}t^n</math>\n\nare\n\n:<math>c_n=\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} a_k b_{n-k}</math>\n\n(see also [[Cauchy product]]).  If we think of ''x'' as a parameter indexing a family of such power series, then the binomial identity says in effect that the power series indexed by ''x'' + ''y'' is the product of those indexed by ''x'' and by ''y''.  Thus the ''x'' is the argument to a function that maps sums to products: an [[exponential function]]\n\n:<math>g(t)^x=e^{x f(t)}</math>\n\nwhere ''f''(''t'') has the form given above.\n\n==Umbral composition of polynomial sequences==\nThe set of all polynomial sequences of binomial type is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the group operation is \"umbral composition\" of polynomial sequences.  That operation is defined as follows.  Suppose { ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } and { ''q''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } are polynomial sequences, and\n\n:<math>p_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n,k}\\, x^k.</math>\n\nThen the umbral composition ''p'' o ''q'' is the polynomial sequence whose ''n''th term is\n\n:<math>(p_n\\circ q)(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n,k}\\, q_k(x)</math>\n\n(the subscript ''n'' appears in ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>, since this is the ''n'' term of that sequence, but not in ''q'', since this refers to the sequence as a whole rather than one of its terms).\n\nWith the delta operator defined by a power series in ''D'' as above, the natural bijection between delta operators and polynomial sequences of binomial type, also defined above, is a group isomorphism, in which the group operation on power series is formal composition of formal power series.\n\n==Cumulants and moments==\nThe sequence κ<sub>''n''</sub> of coefficients of the first-degree terms in a polynomial sequence of binomial type may be termed the [[cumulant]]s of the polynomial sequence.  It can be shown that the whole polynomial sequence of binomial type is determined by its cumulants, in a way discussed in the article titled ''[[cumulant]]''.  Thus\n\n:<math> p_n'(0)=\\kappa_n= \\,</math> the ''n''th cumulant\n\nand\n\n:<math> p_n(1)=\\mu_n'= \\,</math> the ''n''th moment.\n\nThese are \"formal\" cumulants and \"formal\" [[moment (mathematics)|moments]], as opposed to cumulants of a [[probability distribution]] and moments of a probability distribution.\n\nLet\n\n:<math>f(t)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\kappa_n}{n!}t^n</math>\n\nbe the (formal) cumulant-generating function.  Then\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(D) \\,</math>\n\nis the delta operator associated with the polynomial sequence, i.e., we have\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(D)p_n(x)=np_{n-1}(x). \\,</math>\n\n==Applications==\nThe concept of binomial type has applications in [[combinatorics]], [[probability]], [[statistics]], and a variety of other fields.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of factorial and binomial topics]]\n* [[Binomial-QMF]] (Daubechies wavelet filters)\n\n==References==\n* [[Gian-Carlo Rota|G.-C.

      "title": "Bombieri norm",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombieri_norm",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Bombieri norm''', named after [[Enrico Bombieri]], is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on [[homogeneous polynomial]]s with coefficient in <math>\\mathbb R</math> or <math>\\mathbb C</math> (there is also a version for non homogeneous univariate polynomials). This norm has many remarkable properties, the most important being listed in this article.\n\n==Bombieri scalar product for homogeneous polynomials==\n\nTo start with the geometry, the ''Bombieri scalar product'' for [[homogeneous polynomial]]s with ''N'' variables can be defined as follows using [[multi-index notation]]:\n\n:<math>\\forall \\alpha,\\beta \\in \\mathbb{N}^N</math>\n\nby definition different monomials are orthogonal, so that\n\n:<math>\\langle X^\\alpha | X^\\beta \\rangle = 0</math> if <math>\\alpha \\neq \\beta,</math>\n\nwhile\n\n:<math>\\forall \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}^N</math>\n\nby definition\n\n:<math>\\|X^\\alpha\\|^2 = \\frac{\\alpha!}{|\\alpha|!}.</math>\n\nIn the above definition and in the rest of this article the following notation applies:\n\nif\n\n:<math>\\alpha = (\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_N) \\in \\mathbb{N}^N,</math>\n\nwrite\n\n:<math>|\\alpha| = \\Sigma_{i=1}^N \\alpha_i</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\alpha! = \\Pi_{i=1}^N (\\alpha_i!)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X^\\alpha = \\Pi_{i=1}^N X_i^{\\alpha_i}.</math>\n\n==Bombieri inequality==\nThe fundamental property of this norm is the Bombieri inequality:\n\nlet <math>P,Q</math> be two homogeneous polynomials respectively of degree <math>d^\\circ(P)</math> and <math>d^\\circ(Q)</math> with <math>N</math> variables, then, the following inequality holds:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^\\circ(P)!d^\\circ(Q)!}{(d^\\circ(P)+d^\\circ(Q))!}\\|P\\|^2 \\, \\|Q\\|^2 \\leq \n \\|P\\cdot Q\\|^2 \\leq \\|P\\|^2 \\, \\|Q\\|^2.</math>\n\nHere the Bombieri inequality is the left hand side of the above statement, while the right side means that the Bombieri norm is an [[algebra norm]]. Giving the left hand side is meaningless without that constraint, because in this case, we can achieve the same result with any norm by multiplying the norm by a well chosen factor.\n\nThis multiplicative inequality implies that the product of two polynomials is bounded from below by a quantity that depends on the multiplicand polynomials. Thus, this product can not be arbitrarily small. This multiplicative inequality is useful in metric [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].\n\n==Invariance by isometry==\nAnother important property is that the Bombieri norm is invariant by composition with an \n[[isometry]]:\n\nlet <math>P,Q</math> be two homogeneous polynomials of degree <math>d</math> with <math>N</math> variables and let <math>h</math> be an isometry\nof <math>\\mathbb R^N</math> (or <math>\\mathbb C^N</math>). Then, the we have <math>\\langle P\\circ h|Q\\circ h\\rangle = \\langle P|Q\\rangle</math>. When <math>P=Q</math> this implies <math>\\|P\\circ h\\|=\\|P\\|</math>.\n\nThis result follows from a nice integral formulation of the scalar product:\n\n: <math>\\langle P|Q\\rangle = {d+N-1 \\choose N-1} \\int_{S^N} P(Z)\\overline{Q(Z)}\\,d\\sigma(Z)</math>\n\nwhere <math>S^N</math> is the unit sphere of <math>\\mathbb C^N</math> with its canonical measure <math>d\\sigma(Z)</math>.\n\n==Other inequalities==\nLet <math>P</math> be a homogeneous polynomial of degree <math>d</math> with <math>N</math> variables and let <math>Z \\in \\mathbb C^N</math>. We have:\n\n* <math>|P(Z)| \\leq \\|P\\| \\, \\|Z\\|_E^d</math>\n* <math>\\|\\nabla P(Z)\\|_E \\leq d \\|P\\| \\, \\|Z\\|_E^d</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_E</math> denotes the Euclidean norm.\n\nThe Bombieri norm is useful in polynomial factorization, where it has some advantages over the [[Mahler measure]], according to Knuth (Exercises 20-21, pages 457-458 and 682-684).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grassmann manifold]]\n*[[Hardy space]]\n*[[Homogeneous polynomial]]\n*[[Plücker embedding]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Beauzamy|first1=Bernard|last2=Bombieri|first2=Enrico|authorlink2=Enrico Bombieri|last3=Enflo|first3=Per|authorlink3=Per Enflo |last4=Montgomery|first4=Hugh L.|authorlink4=Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|title=Products of polynomials in many variables|journal=[[Journal of Number Theory]]|volume=36|year=1990|issue=2|pages=219–245| doi = 10.1016/0022-314X(90)90075-3 | hdl=2027.42/28840 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/28840/1/0000675.pdf|mr=1072467 }} \n* {{cite journal|title=Quantitative estimates for polynomials in one or several variables: From analysis and number&nbsp;theory to symbolic and massively&nbsp;parallel computation|last1=Beauzamy|first1=Bernard|last2=Enflo|first2=Per|authorlink2=Per Enflo |last3=Wang|first3=Paul\n|journal=Mathematics Magazine\n|volume=67\n|issue=4\n|date=October 1994\n|pages=243–257\n|url=http://www.scmsa.eu/archives/ART_quantitative_estimates_1992.pdf|jstor=2690843|mr=1300564|doi=10.2307/2690843}}\n*{{cite book\n|first1=Enrico|last1=Bombieri|authorlink1=Enrico Bombieri|last2=Gubler|first2=Walter\n|title=Heights in Diophantine geometry\n|publisher=Cambridge U.&nbsp;P.\n|year=2006|\nisbn=0-521-84615-3\n|mr=2216774}}\n*{{cite book\n|authorlink=Donald Knuth|last=Knuth|first=Donald&nbsp;E.\n|chapter=[[The Art of Computer Programming#Chapters|4.6.2 Factorization of polynomials]]\n|title=Seminumerical algorithms\n|series = ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''\n|volume=2\n|edition=Third\n|location=Reading, Massachusetts\n|publisher=Addison-Wesley\n|year=1997\n|pages=439–461, 678–691<!--   xiv+762 -->\n|isbn=0-201-89684-2|mr=633878}}\n\n[[Category:Norms (mathematics)]]\n[[Category:Analytic number theory]]\n[[Category:Polynomials]]\n[[Category:Homogeneous polynomials]]\n[[Category:Complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Several complex variables]]"

Because of the existence of four [[branch point]]s, the Bring radical cannot be defined as a function that is continuous over the whole [[complex plane]], and its domain of continuity must exclude four [[branch cut]]s.\n\n[[George Jerrard]] showed that some [[quintic equation]]s can be [[closed form solution|solved in closed form]] using [[Nth root|radicals]] and Bring radicals, which had been introduced by [[Erland Samuel Bring|Erland Bring]].\n\nIn this article, the Bring radical of ''a'' is denoted <math>\\operatorname{BR}(a).</math> For real argument, it is odd, monotonically decreasing, and unbounded, with asymptotic behavior <math>\\mathrm{BR}(a) \\sim -a^{1/5}</math> for large <math>a</math>.\n\n==Normal forms==\nThe quintic equation is rather difficult to obtain solutions for directly, with five independent coefficients in its most general form:\n\n:<math>x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nThe various methods for solving the quintic that have been developed generally attempt to simplify the quintic using [[Tschirnhaus transformation]]s to reduce the number of independent coefficients.\n\n===Principal quintic form===\nThe general quintic may be reduced into what is known as the '''principal quintic form''', with the quartic and cubic terms removed:\n\n:<math>y^5 + c_2y^2 + c_1y + c_0 = 0 \\,</math>\n\nIf the roots of a general quintic and a principal quintic are related by a quadratic [[Tschirnhaus transformation]]\n\n:<math>y_k = x_k^2 + \\alpha x_k + \\beta \\, ,</math>\n\nthe coefficients ''α'' and ''β'' may be determined by using the [[resultant]], or by means of the [[power sum symmetric polynomial|power sums of the roots]] and [[Newton's identities]].

We have a reduction to the Bring&ndash;Jerrard form in terms of solvable polynomial equations, and we used transformations involving polynomial expressions in the roots only up to the fourth degree, which means inverting the transformation may be done by finding the roots of a polynomial solvable in radicals. This procedure produces extraneous solutions, but when we have found the correct ones by numerical means we can also write down the roots of the quintic in terms of square roots, cube roots, and the Bring radical, which is therefore an algebraic solution in terms of algebraic functions of a single variable &mdash; an algebraic solution of the general quintic.\n\n==Other characterizations==\nMany other characterizations of the Bring radical have been developed, the first of which is in terms of [[elliptic modular function]]s by [[Charles Hermite]] in 1858, and further methods later developed by other mathematicians.\n\n===The Hermite–Kronecker–Brioschi characterization===\nIn 1858, Charles Hermite<ref name=\"hermite\">\n{{cite journal\n | last = Hermite\n | first = Charles\n | year = 1858\n | title = Sur la résolution de l'équation du cinquème degré\n | journal = Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences\n | volume = XLVI\n | issue = I\n | pages = 508–515}}</ref> published the first known solution to the general quintic equation in terms of elliptic transcendents, and at around the same time [[Francesco Brioschi]]<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Brioschi\n | first = Francesco\n | year = 1858\n | title = Sul Metodo di Kronecker per la Risoluzione delle Equazioni di Quinto Grado\n | journal = Atti Dell'i.

The remaining three roots can be obtained by using [[synthetic division]] to divide the two roots out, producing a cubic equation. It is to be noted that due to the way the iteration is formulated, this method seems to always find two [[complex conjugate]] roots of the quintic even when all the quintic coefficients are real and the starting guess is real.

It has the [[determinant]] and the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix as coefficients. The '''characteristic polynomial''' of an [[endomorphism]] of [[vector space]]s of finite dimension is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of the endomorphism over any base; it does not depend on the choice of a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. The '''characteristic equation''' is the equation obtained by equating to zero the characteristic polynomial.\n\nThe '''characteristic polynomial of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]''' is the characteristic polynomial of its [[adjacency matrix]]. It is a [[graph invariant]], though it is not complete: the smallest pair of non-isomorphic graphs with the same characteristic polynomial have five [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CharacteristicPolynomial.html\n| title = Characteristic Polynomial of a Graph – Wolfram MathWorld\n|accessdate = August 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Motivation==\n\nGiven a square matrix ''A'', we want to find a polynomial whose zeros are the eigenvalues of ''A''.  For a [[diagonal matrix]] ''A'', the characteristic polynomial is easy to define: if the diagonal entries are ''a''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''a''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;etc. then the characteristic polynomial will be:\n\n:<math>(t-a_1)(t-a_2)(t-a_3)\\cdots.\\,</math>\n\nThis works because the diagonal entries are also the eigenvalues of this matrix.\n\nFor a general matrix ''A'', one can proceed as follows. A scalar  ''λ''  is an eigenvalue of ''A'' if and only if there is an [[eigenvector]] '''v'''  ≠  0 such that\n\n:<math>A \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v},\\,</math>\nor \n:<math>(\\lambda I - A)\\mathbf{v} = 0\\,</math>\n\n(where '''''I'''''  is the [[identity matrix]]). Since '''v''' is non-zero, this means that the matrix ''λ'' '''''I'''''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''A'' is [[singular matrix|singular]] (non-invertible), which in turn means that its [[determinant]] is 0.  Thus the roots of the function det(''λ''&nbsp;'''''I'''''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''A'') are the eigenvalues of ''A'', and it is clear that this determinant is a polynomial in ''λ''.\n\n==Formal definition==\n\nWe consider  an ''n''&times;''n'' matrix ''A''. The characteristic polynomial of ''A'', denoted by ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''t''), is the polynomial defined by<ref>{{Cite book|title=Advanced linear algebra |author=Steven Roman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWUPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA137 |isbn=3540978372 |edition=2 |year=1992 |publisher=Springer |page=137}}</ref>\n:<math>p_A(t) = \\det \\left(tI - A\\right)</math>\nwhere ''I'' denotes the ''n''-by-''n'' [[identity matrix]].\n\nSome authors define the characteristic polynomial to be det(''A''&nbsp;-&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;''I''). That polynomial differs from the one defined here by a sign (−1)<sup>''n''</sup>, so it makes no difference for properties like having as roots the eigenvalues of ''A''; however the current definition always gives a [[monic polynomial]], whereas the alternative definition is monic only when <math>n</math> is even.\n\n==Examples==\nSuppose we want to compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrix\n:<math>A=\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1\\\\\n-1& 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nWe now compute the [[determinant]] of\n:<math>t I-A = \\begin{pmatrix}\nt-2&-1\\\\\n1&t-0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math> \nwhich is <math>(t-2)t - 1(-1) = t^2-2t+1 \\,\\!,</math> the characteristic polynomial of ''A''.\n\nAnother example uses [[hyperbolic function]]s of a [[hyperbolic angle]] &phi;.\nFor the matrix take\n:<math>A=\\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\varphi) & \\sinh(\\varphi)\\\\ \\sinh(\\varphi)& \\cosh(\\varphi) \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nIts characteristic polynomial is\n:<math>\\det (tI - A) = (t - \\cosh(\\varphi))^2 - \\sinh^2(\\varphi) = t^2 - 2 t \\ \\cosh(\\varphi) + 1 = (t - e^\\varphi) (t - e^{-\\varphi}).</math>\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe polynomial ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''t'') is monic (its leading coefficient is 1) and its degree is ''n''.  The most important fact about the characteristic polynomial was already mentioned in the motivational paragraph: the eigenvalues of ''A'' are precisely the [[root of a function|root]]s of ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''t'') (this also holds for the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''A'', but its degree may be less than ''n'').  The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all [[polynomial expression]]s in the entries of the matrix. In particular its constant coefficient ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>&nbsp;(0)&nbsp; is det(&minus;''A'') = (−1)<sup>''n''</sup> det(''A''), the coefficient of {{math|''t''<sup>''n''</sup>}}  is one, and the coefficient of {{math|''t''<sup>''n''−1</sup>}} is tr(&minus;''A'') = &minus;tr(''A''), where {{math|tr(''A'')}} is the matrix [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of&nbsp;''A''. (The signs given here correspond to the formal definition given in the previous section;<ref>Proposition 28 in these [http://users.math.yale.edu/~tl292/teaching/math225/notes/week10.pdf lecture notes]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> for the alternative definition these would instead be det(''A'') and (−1)<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 </sup>tr(''A'') respectively.<ref>Theorem 4 in these [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/resource/general/115a.3.02f/week8.pdf lecture notes]</ref>)\n\nFor a 2&times;2 matrix ''A'', the characteristic polynomial is thus given by\n: <math> t^2 - \\operatorname{tr}(A) t + \\det(A). </math>\n\nUsing the language of [[exterior algebra]], one may compactly express the characteristic polynomial of an ''n''&times;''n'' matrix ''A'' as \n: <math> p_A (t) = \\sum_{k=0}^n t^{n-k} (-1)^k \\operatorname{tr}(\\Lambda^k A) </math>\nwhere tr(Λ<sup>''k''</sup>A) is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the ''k''<sup>th</sup> [[Exterior algebra#Functoriality|exterior power]] of ''A'', which has dimension <math>\\tbinom nk</math>. This trace may be computed as the sum of all [[principal minor]]s of ''A'' of size ''k''. The recursive [[Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm]] computes these  coefficients  more efficiently.\n\nWhen the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is 0 it may alternatively be computed as a single determinant, that of the {{math|''k''×''k''}} matrix,\n:<math>\\frac{1}{k!}  \n\\begin{vmatrix}  \\operatorname{tr}A  &   k-1 &0&\\cdots & \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}A^2  &\\operatorname{tr}A&  k-2 &\\cdots & \\\\\n \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\ddots & \\vdots    \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}A^{k-1} &\\operatorname{tr}A^{k-2}& & \\cdots & 1    \\\\ \n\\operatorname{tr}A^k  &\\operatorname{tr}A^{k-1}& & \\cdots & \\operatorname{tr}A\n\\end{vmatrix}         ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] states that replacing ''t''  by ''A'' in the characteristic polynomial (interpreting the resulting powers as matrix powers, and the constant term ''c'' as ''c'' times the identity matrix) yields the zero matrix. Informally speaking, every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. This statement is equivalent to saying that the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''A'' divides the characteristic polynomial of ''A''.\n\nTwo [[similar matrices]] have the same characteristic polynomial.  The converse however is not true in general: two matrices with the same characteristic polynomial need not be similar.\n\nThe matrix ''A'' and its [[transpose]] have the same characteristic polynomial. ''A'' is similar to a [[triangular matrix]] [[if and only if]] its characteristic polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors over ''K'' (the same is true with the minimal polynomial instead of the characteristic polynomial). In this case ''A'' is similar to a matrix in [[Jordan normal form]].\n\n==Characteristic polynomial of a product of two matrices==\n\nIf ''A'' and ''B'' are two square ''n×n'' matrices then characteristic polynomials of ''AB'' and ''BA'' coincide: \n:<math>p_{AB}(t)=p_{BA}(t).\\,</math>\n\nWhen ''A'' is [[Non-singular matrix|non-singular]] this result follows from the fact that ''AB'' and ''BA'' are [[similar matrices|similar]]:\n:<math>BA = A^{-1} (AB) A.</math>\n\nFor the case where both ''A'' and ''B'' are singular, one may remark that the desired identity is an equality between polynomials in ''t'' and the coefficients of the matrices. Thus, to prove this equality, it suffices to prove that it is verified on a non-empty [[open subset]] (for the usual [[topological space|topology]], or, more generally, for the [[Zariski topology]]) of the space of all the coefficients. As the non-singular matrices form such an open subset of the space of all matrices, this proves the result.\n\nMore generally, if ''A'' is a matrix of order ''m&times;n'' and ''B'' is a matrix of order ''n&times;m'', then ''AB'' is ''m&times;m'' and ''BA'' is ''n&times;n'' matrix, and one has\n: <math> p_{BA}(t) = t^{n-m} p_{AB}(t).\\,</math>\n\nTo prove this, one may suppose ''n'' > ''m'', by exchanging, if needed, ''A'' and ''B''. Then, by bordering ''A'' on the bottom by ''n'' – ''m'' rows of zeros, and ''B'' on the right, by,  ''n'' – ''m'' columns of zeros, one gets two ''n&times;n'' matrices ''A' ''and ''B' '' such that ''B'A' ''= ''BA'', and ''A'B' '' is equal to ''AB'' bordered by ''n'' – ''m'' rows and columns of zeros. The result follows from the case of square matrices, by comparing the characteristic polynomials of ''A'B' '' and ''AB''.\n\n==Secular function and secular equation==\n\n===Secular function===\nThe term '''secular function''' has been used for what is now called ''characteristic polynomial'' (in some literature the term secular function is still used). The term comes from the fact that the characteristic polynomial was used to calculate [[secular phenomena|secular perturbations]] (on a time scale of a century, i.e. slow compared to annual motion) of planetary orbits, according to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s theory of oscillations.\n\n===Secular equation===\n''Secular equation'' may have several meanings.\n\n*In [[linear algebra]] it is sometimes used in place of characteristic equation.\n*In [[astronomy]] it is the algebraic or numerical expression of the magnitude of the inequalities in a planet's motion that remain after the inequalities of a short period have been allowed for.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://dict.die.net/secular%20equation/\n| title = secular equation\n|accessdate = January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n*In [[molecular orbital]] calculations relating to the energy of the electron and its wave function it is also used instead of the characteristic equation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Characteristic equation (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)]]\n* [[Invariants of tensors]]\n* [[Companion matrix]]\n* [[Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm]]\n* [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]\n* [[Samuelson–Berkowitz algorithm]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* T.S.

The design procedure is easily understandable, systematic and useful. Therefore, the coefficients of the\nCDM controller polynomials can be determined more easily than those of the PID or other types of controller. This creates the possibility of an easy realisation for a new designer to control any kind of system.\n\n2.

Manabe (1998), \"''Coefficient Diagram Method''\", 14th IFAC Symp. on Automatic Control in Aerospace, Seoul.</ref> For this reason, the designer can easily realize many control systems having different performance properties for a given control problem in a wide range of freedom.\n\n3. The development of different tuning methods is required for time delay processes of different properties\nin PID control. But it is sufficient to use the single design procedure in the CDM technique.

It is theoretically proven that CDM design is equivalent to LQ design with proper state augmentation. Thus, CDM can be considered an ‘‘improved LQG’’, because the order of the controller is smaller and weight selection rules are also given.<ref>S.

It must have enough bandwidth and power rating limitations. If the controller is designed without considering these limitations, the robustness property will be very poor, even though the stability and time response requirements are met. CDM controllers designed while considering all these problems is of the lowest degree, has a convenient bandwidth and results with a unit step time response without an overshoot. These properties guarantee the robustness, the sufficient damping of the disturbance effects and the low economic property.<ref>S. Manabe and Y.C.

CDM is an algebraic approach combining classical and modern control theories and uses polynomial representation in the mathematical expression. The advantages of the classical and modern control techniques are integrated with the basic principles of this method, which is derived by making use of the previous experience and knowledge of the controller design. Thus, an efficient and fertile control method has appeared as a tool with which control systems can be designed without needing much experience and without confronting many problems.\n\nMany control systems have been designed successfully using CDM.<ref>S.

For example, in the [[quadratic polynomial]]\n:<math>x^2 + 2x + 3,\\ </math>\nthe 3 is a constant term.\n\nAfter [[like terms]] are combined, an algebraic expression will have at most one constant term.  Thus, it is common to speak of the quadratic polynomial\n:<math>ax^2+bx+c,\\ </math>\nwhere ''x'' is the variable, and has a constant term of ''c''.  If ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, then the constant term will not actually appear when the quadratic is written.\n\nIt is notable that a term that is constant, with a constant as a multiplicative coefficient added to it (although this expression could be more simply written as their product), still erm as a variable is still not present in the new term. Although the expression is modified, the term (and coefficient) itself classifies as constant. However, should this introduced coefficient contain a variable, wginal number has a constant meaning, this has no bearing if the new term stays constant as the introduced coefficient will always override the constant expression - for example, in <math>(x+1)(x-2)</math> when x is multiplied by 2, the result, 2x, is not constant; while 1 * -2 is -2 and still a constant.\n\nAny [[polynomial]] written in standard form has a unique constant term, which can be considered a [[coefficient]] of ''x''<sup>0</sup>.  In particular, the constant term will always be the lowest [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] term of the polynomial.  This also applies to multivariate polynomials. For example, the polynomial\n:<math>x^2+2xy+y^2-2x+2y-4\\ </math>\nhas a constant term of &minus;4, which can be considered to be the coefficient of ''x''<sup>0</sup>''y''<sup>0</sup>, where the variables are eliminated by being exponentiated to 0 (any number exponentiated to 0 becomes 1). For any polynomial, the constant term can be obtained by substituting in 0 instead of each variable; thus, eliminating each variable. The concept of exponentiation to 0 can be extended to [[power series]] and other types of series, for example in this power series:\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \\cdots,</math>\n''a''<sub>0</sub> is the constant term. In general a constant term is one that does not involve any variables at all. However in expressions that involve terms with other types of factors than constants and powers of variables, the notion of constant term cannot be used in this sense, since that would lead to calling \"4\" the constant term of <math>(x-3)^2+4</math>, whereas substituting 0 for  ''x'' in this polynomial makes it evaluate to 13.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constant (mathematics)]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constant Term}}\n[[Category:Polynomials]]\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]"

In fact, all cubic equations can be reduced to this form if we allow {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} to be negative, but [[negative number]]s were not known to him at that time. Del Ferro kept his achievement secret until just before his death, when he told his student [[Antonio Fiore]] about it.\n[[Image:Niccolò Tartaglia.jpg|thumb|160px|Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]]\nIn 1530, [[Niccolò Tartaglia]] (1500–1557) received two problems in cubic equations from [[Zuanne da Coi]] and announced that he could solve them. He was soon challenged by Fiore, which led to a famous contest between the two. Each contestant had to put up a certain amount of money and to propose a number of problems for his rival to solve. Whoever solved more problems within 30 days would get all the money. Tartaglia received questions in the form {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''mx'' {{=}} ''n''}}, for which he had worked out a general method. Fiore received questions in the form {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''mx''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''n''}}, which proved to be too difficult for him to solve, and Tartaglia won the contest.\n\nLater, Tartaglia was persuaded by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–1576) to reveal his secret for solving cubic equations. In 1539, Tartaglia did so only on the condition that Cardano would never reveal it and that if he did write a book about cubics, he would give Tartaglia time to publish. Some years later, Cardano learned about Ferro's prior work and published Ferro's method in his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'' in 1545, meaning Cardano gave Tartaglia six years to publish his results (with credit given to Tartaglia for an independent solution). Cardano's promise with Tartaglia stated that he not publish Tartaglia's work, and Cardano felt he was publishing del Ferro's, so as to get around the promise. Nevertheless, this led to a challenge to Cardano by Tartaglia, which Cardano denied. The challenge was eventually accepted by Cardano's student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] (1522–1565). Ferrari did better than Tartaglia in the competition, and Tartaglia lost both his prestige and income.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Katz |first=Victor |title=A History of Mathematics |page=220 |location=Boston |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=2004 |isbn=9780321016188 }}</ref>\n\nCardano noticed that Tartaglia's method sometimes required him to extract the square root of a negative number. He even included a calculation with these [[complex number]]s in ''Ars Magna'', but he did not really understand it. [[Rafael Bombelli]] studied this issue in detail<ref name=\"Bombelli\"/> and is therefore often considered as the discoverer of complex numbers.\n\n[[François Viète]] (1540–1603) independently derived the trigonometric solution for the cubic with three real roots, and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) extended the work of Viète.<ref name=Nickalls/>\n\n==Critical points and inflection point of a cubic function==\n{{Cubic_graph_special_points.svg}}\n{{see also|Stationary point}}\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a function are those values of {{mvar|x}} where the slope of the function is zero. The critical points of a cubic function {{math|''f''}} defined by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d''}}, occur at values of {{math|''x''}} such that the [[derivative]] of the cubic function is zero:\n:<math> 3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0.</math>\nThe solutions of that equation are the critical points of the cubic equation and are given, using the [[quadratic formula]], by <!-- Do not change 3ac into 4ac: here the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial are not the same as the coefficients generally used for expressing the quadratic formula -->\n:<math style=\"vertical-align:-70%;\">x_\\text{critical}=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt {b^2-3ac}}{3a}.</math>\nThe expression inside of the square root,\n:<math>\\Delta_0 = b^2 - 3ac,</math>\ndetermines what type of critical points the function has. If {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> > 0}}, then the cubic function has a local maximum and a local minimum. If {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}}, then the cubic's [[inflection point]] is the only critical point. If {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> < 0}}, then there are no critical points. In cases where {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> ≤ 0}}, the cubic function is strictly [[monotonic]]. The adjacent diagram is an example of the case where {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> > 0}}. The other two cases do not have the local maximum or the local minimum but still have an inflection point.\n\nThe value of {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub>}} also plays an important role in determining the nature of the roots of the cubic equation and in the calculation of those roots; see [[#General formula|below]].\n\nThe inflection point of a function is where that function changes [[concavity]]. The inflection point of our cubic function occurs at:\n\n:<math>x_\\text{inflection} = -\\frac{b}{3a},</math>\n\na value that is also important in solving the cubic equation. The cubic function [[#Symmetry|has point symmetry about its inflection point]].\n\nAll of the above assumes that the coefficients are real as well as the variable {{mvar|x}}.\n\n==General solution to the cubic equation with real coefficients==\n\nThis section is about how to solve the cubic equation using various methods.

The general cubic equation has the form:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nwith {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}.\n\n===Algebraic solution===\nThe algebraic solution of the cubic equation can be derived in a number of different ways. (See for example [[Cardano's method]] and [[Vieta's method]] below.)\n\n====The discriminant====\n\nThe numbers of real and complex roots are determined by the [[discriminant]] of the cubic equation,\n\n:<math>\\Delta = 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2.</math>\n\nIt turns out that:\n\n* If {{math|Δ > 0}}, then the equation has three distinct real roots.\n* If {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}, then the equation has a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiple root]] and all of its roots are real.\n* If {{math|Δ < 0}}, then the equation has one real root and two non-real [[complex conjugate]] roots.\n\n====Cardano formula====\nThe solution of the general cubic equation may be deduced from that of the ''depressed cubic'' \n:<math>x^3+px+q=0</math>\n(see {{slink||Reduction to a depressed cubic}}).\n\n'''Cardano formula''' is the following expression of the solutions of this equation.\n\nIf {{math|p}} and {{math|q}} are [[real number]]s, a real solution of the equation is given by \n:<math>\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}+\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}} +\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}-\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}},</math>\nwhere <math>\\sqrt[3]X</math> denotes either the real [[cube root]] of {{mvar|X}}, if {{mvar|X}} is real (that is <math>4p^3+27q^2 \\ge 0</math>), or, in the other case, the [[principal value]] of the cube root function, that is the cube root with the maximal [[real part]].\n\nThe two other solutions are obtained by multiplying one of the cube roots by <math>\\frac{-1+i\\sqrt 3} 2,</math> and the other by <math>\\frac{-1-i\\sqrt 3} 2.</math>\n\nIf {{math|p}} and {{math|q}} are not both real, the same formulas remain correct if, in the formula for the first root, one chooses the cube roots in order that their product is {{math|–p/3}}. (If {{math|p}} and {{math|q}} are both real, the above choices for the cube roots satisfy this property).\n\nIn the special case <math>4p^3+27q^2 = 0,</math> these formulas remain correct, but a simpler formula is available, where one solution is {{math|{{sfrac|3q|p}}}}, and the two others equal {{math|{{sfrac|–3q|2p}}}}.\n\n====General formula====\nThe general solution of the cubic equation involves first calculating:\n\n:<math>\\Delta_0 = b^2 - 3ac\\text{,}</math>\n\n:<math>\\Delta_1 = 2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d,\\quad\\text{and}</math>\n\n:<math>C = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\Delta_1 \\pm \\sqrt{{\\Delta_1}^2 - 4 {\\Delta_0}^3}}2}\\text{.}</math>\n\n(If the discriminant {{math|Δ}} has already been calculated, then the equality {{math|Δ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> − 4Δ<sub>0</sub><sup>3</sup> {{=}} −27&thinsp;''a''<sup>2</sup>Δ}} can be used to simplify the calculation of {{math|''C''}}.) There are three possible cube roots implied by the expression, of which at least two are non-real complex numbers; any of these may be chosen when defining {{math|''C''}}. (In addition either sign in front of the square root may be chosen unless {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} in which case the sign must be chosen so that the two terms inside the cube root do not cancel.)\n\nThe general formula for one of the roots, in terms of the coefficients, is as follows:\n:<math>x = - \\frac{1}{3a}\\left(b+C+\\frac{\\Delta_0}{C}\\right)\\text{.}</math>\nNote that, while this equality is valid for all non-zero {{mvar|C}}, it is not the most convenient form for multiple roots ({{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}), which is covered in the next section. (The case when {{math|''C'' {{=}} 0}} only occurs when both {{math|Δ}} and {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub>}} are equal to {{math|0}} and is also covered in the next section.)\n\nThe other two roots of the cubic equation can be determined using the same equality, using the other two choices for the cube root in the equation for {{mvar|C}}: denoting the first choice simply as {{mvar|C}}, the others can be written as\n{{math|(−{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i'') ''C''}} and {{math|(−{{sfrac|1|2}} − {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i'') ''C''}}.\n\nThe above equality can be expressed compactly including all {{math|3}} roots as follows:\n\n:<math>x_k = - \\frac{1}{3a}\\left(b+\\xi^kC+\\frac{\\Delta_0}{\\xi^kC}\\right), \\qquad k \\in \\{0,1,2\\} \\text{,}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}} (which is a cube root of unity). In the case of three real roots, this solution expresses them in terms of non-real complex terms (since any choice of {{mvar|C}} is non-real) whose imaginary components offset each other but [[Casus irreducibilis|cannot be eliminated from the formula]].\n\nThis formula for the three roots applies even when the coefficients in the cubic are non-real, although the analysis of the sign of {{math|Δ}} does not hold since {{math|Δ}} is then not real in general.\n\n====Multiple roots, {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}====\n\nIf both {{math|Δ}} and {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub>}} are equal to {{math|0}}, then the equation has a single root (which is a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|triple root]]):\n\n:<math>-\\frac{b}{3a}\\text{.}</math>\n\nIf {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}} and {{math|Δ<sub>0</sub> ≠ 0}}, then there are both a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|double root]],\n:<math>\\frac{9ad-bc}{2\\Delta_0},</math>\nand a simple root,\n:<math>\\frac{4abc-9a^2d-b^3}{a\\Delta_0}.</math>\n\n===Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions===<!-- linked from redirect [[Chebyshev cube root]] -->\n\n====Reduction to a depressed cubic====\nDividing {{math|''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}} by {{mvar|a}} and substituting {{math|''t'' − {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}} for {{mvar|x}} we get the equation\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>t^3+pt+q=0</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{align}\np=&\\frac{3ac-b^2}{3a^2}, \\\\\nq=&\\frac{2b^3-9abc+27a^2d}{27a^3}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe left hand side of equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is a [[monic polynomial|monic]] [[trinomial]] called a '''depressed cubic''', because the quadratic term has coefficient 0.\n\nAny formula for the roots of a depressed cubic may be transformed into a formula for the roots of equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' by substituting the above values for {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} and using the relation {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''t'' − {{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}}}.\n\nTherefore, only equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is considered in the following.\n\n====Trigonometric solution for three real roots====\n\nWhen a cubic equation has three real roots, the formulas expressing these roots in terms of radicals involve complex numbers. It has been proved that when none of the three real roots is rational—the ''[[casus irreducibilis]]''— one cannot express the roots in terms of real radicals. Nevertheless, purely real expressions of the solutions may be obtained using [[hypergeometric function]]s,<ref>Zucker, I. J., \"The cubic equation — a new look at the irreducible case\", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 92, July 2008, 264–268.</ref> or more elementarily in terms of [[trigonometry|trigonometric functions]], specifically in terms of the [[cosine]] and [[arccosine]] functions.\n\nThe formulas which follow, due to [[François Viète]],<ref name=Nickalls>{{Citation |last=Nickalls |first=R.

The last condition is equivalent to {{math|4''p''<sup>3</sup> + 27''q''<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0}}, which itself implies {{math|''p'' < 0}}. Thus the above formula for the roots involves only real terms if and only if the three roots are real.\n\nDenoting by {{math|''C''(&thinsp;''p'', ''q'')}} the above value of {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, and using the inequalities {{math|0 ≤ arccos(''u'') ≤ {{pi}}}} for a real number {{mvar|u}} such that {{math|−1 ≤ ''u'' ≤ 1}}, the three roots may also be expressed as\n:<math>t_0=C(p,q),\\qquad t_2=-C(p,-q), \\qquad t_1=-t_0-t_2\\,.</math>\nIf the three roots are real, we have {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub> ≥ ''t''<sub>1</sub> ≥ ''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. All these formulas may be straightforwardly transformed into formulas for the roots of the general cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''', using the back substitution described [[#Reduction to a depressed cubic|above]].\n\n====Hyperbolic solution for one real root====\n\nWhen there is only one real root (and {{math|''p'' ≠ 0}}), it may be similarly represented using [[hyperbolic function]]s, as<ref>These are Formulas (80) and (83) of Weisstein, Eric W.

''Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables'', Dover (1965), chap. 22 p. 773</ref> More precisely, the values involving cosines and hyperbolic cosines define, when {{math|''p'' {{=}} −3}}, the same [[analytic function]] denoted {{math|''C''<sub>1/3</sub>(''q'')}}, which is the proper Chebyshev cube root. The value involving hyperbolic sines is similarly denoted {{math|''S''<sub>1/3</sub>(''q'')}}, when {{math|''p'' {{=}} 3}}.\n\n===Factorization===\n\nIf a cubic function {{math|''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'' }} with integer coefficients is [[irreducible polynomial|reducible]] over the rationals, meaning that it can be factored into lower-degree polynomials with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients, then it has a rational root, which can be found using the [[rational root test]]: If the root {{math|''r'' {{=}}  {{frac|''m''|''n''}}}} is fully reduced, then {{mvar|m}} is a factor of {{mvar|d}} and {{mvar|n}} is a factor of {{mvar|a}}, so all possible combinations of values for {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} (both positive and negative for one of them) can be checked for whether they are roots of the cubic.\n\nThe rational root test may also be used for a cubic equation with rational coefficients: by multiplication by the [[lowest common denominator]] of the coefficients, one gets an equation with integer coefficients which has exactly the same roots.\n\nThe rational root test is particularly useful when there are three real roots because the algebraic solution unhelpfully expresses the [[casus irreducibilis|real roots in terms of complex entities]]; if the test yields a rational root, it can be factored out and the remaining roots can be found by solving a quadratic. The rational root test is also helpful in the presence of one real and two complex roots because again, if it yields a rational root, it allows all of the roots to be written without the use of cube roots: If {{mvar|r}} is any root of the cubic, then we may factor out {{math|''x'' − ''r''}} using [[polynomial long division]] to obtain\n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=\\left (x-r\\right )\\left (ax^2+(b+ar)x+c+br+ar^2 \\right ).</math>\nHence if we know one root, perhaps from the rational root test, we can find the other two by using the [[quadratic formula]] to find the roots of the quadratic {{math|''ax''<sup>2</sup> + (''b'' + ''ar'')''x'' + ''c'' + ''br'' + ''ar''<sup>2</sup>}}, giving\n:<math> \\frac{-b-ra \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac-2abr-3a^2r^2}}{2a} </math>\nfor the other two roots.\n\n===Geometric solutions===\n\n====Omar Khayyám's solution====\n[[File:Omar Kayyám - Geometric solution to cubic equation.svg|thumb|right|200px|Omar Khayyám's geometric solution of a cubic equation, for the case {{math|''m'' {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''n'' {{=}} 16}}, giving the root {{math|2}}.

The solution is given by the length of the horizontal line segment from the origin to the intersection of the vertical line and the {{mvar|x}}-axis.\n\nA simple modern proof of the method is the following: multiplying the equation by {{mvar|x}} and regrouping the terms gives \n:<math>\\frac{x^4}{m^2}= x\\left(\\frac{n}{m^2}-x\\right).</math>\nThe left-hand side is the value of {{math|''y''<sup>2</sup>}} on the parabola.

(The triangle is isosceles because one root is on the horizontal (real) axis and the other two roots, being complex conjugates, appear symmetrically above and below the real axis.) [[Marden's theorem]] says that the points representing the roots of the derivative of the cubic are the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[Steiner inellipse]] of the triangle—the unique ellipse that is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of its sides. If the angle at the vertex on the real axis is less than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}} then the major axis of the ellipse lies on the real axis, as do its foci and hence the roots of the derivative. If that angle is greater than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the major axis is vertical and its foci, the roots of the derivative, are complex conjugates. And if that angle is {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the triangle is equilateral, the Steiner inellipse is simply the triangle's incircle, its foci coincide with each other at the incenter, which lies on the real axis, and hence the derivative has duplicate real roots.\n\n==Derivation of the roots==\n\n===Cardano's method===\nThe solutions can be found with the following method due to [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]], published by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in 1545 in his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]''. \nThis method applies to the depressed cubic '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}. We introduce two variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} linked by the condition {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} ''t''}} and substitute this in the depressed cubic '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', giving\n:<math>u^3 + v^3 + (3uv + p)(u+v)+ q= 0.</math>\n\nAt this point Cardano imposed a second condition for the variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}: {{math|3''uv'' + ''p'' {{=}} 0}}. As the first parenthesis vanishes in previous equality, we get {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup> + ''v''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} −''q''}} and {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>''v''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}}}}. The combination of these two equations leads to a quadratic equation (since they are the sum and the product of {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}}). Thus {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}} are the two roots of the quadratic equation {{math|''z''<sup>2</sup> + ''qz'' − {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} {{=}} 0}}. Cardano assumed that {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} ≥ 0}}. He suggested that his readers consult another of his books, ''De Regula Aliza'', which was published only in 1570, for the case in which {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} < 0}}.<ref>{{Citation|last = Confalonieri|first = Sara|journal = [[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]|title = The ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'' in Cardano’s ''Ars Magna'' and ''De Regula Aliza''|volume = 69|issue = 3|year = 2015|doi = 10.1007/s00407-015-0149-9}}</ref> Solving this quadratic equation and using the fact that {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} may be exchanged, we find\n:<math> u^3=-{q\\over 2} + \\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}\\,\\,\\,</math> and <math>\\,\\,\\, v^3=-{q\\over 2} - \\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}.</math>\nTherefore, {{math|''u'' + ''v''}} is equal to:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>t=\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}+\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}} +\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}-\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}}.</math>|{{EquationRef|Cardano's formula}}}}\n\nIn his book ''L'Algebra'', published in 1572, [[Rafael Bombelli]] explained that what was done above still works, with a small difference, when {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} < 0}}, as long as one knows how to use complex numbers.<ref name=\"Bombelli\">{{Citation|last2 = Mazur|first2 = Barry|author2-link = Barry Mazur|last = La Nave|first = Federica|journal = [[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]|title = Reading Bombelli|volume = 24|issue = 1|pages = 12–21|year = 2002|doi = 10.1007/BF03025306}}</ref> The small difference is due to the fact that a non-zero complex number has three cube roots and not just one. Therefore, although the equality {{math|''uv'' {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}} implies that {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>''v''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}}}}, this is ''not'' an equivalence. So, we do not simply take ''any'' cube root of\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>-\\frac q2+\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\nand add it to ''any'' cube root of\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>-\\frac q2-\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\n(unless one of them is {{math|0}}); besides, that would provide {{math|9}} solutions to equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})'''. Instead, since we want to have {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} −''p''}}, {{EquationNote|Cardano's formula}} means the sum of ''a'' cube root {{mvar|u}} of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' with {{math|−{{sfrac|''p''|3''u''}}}} (or, if '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' is equal to&nbsp;{{math|0}}, the sum of ''a'' cube root {{mvar|v}} of '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' with {{math|−{{sfrac|''p''|3''v''}}}}). This only fails if ''both'' numbers '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' are equal to&nbsp;{{math|0}}, in which case {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}} and Cardano's formula simply means {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{radic|0|3}} + {{radic|0|3}} ({{=}} 0)}}, which is compatible with the fact that, since {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' simplifies to {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nActually, it is not necessary to compute the three cube roots of '''({{EquationNote|4}})'''. To see why, let {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}}. Then {{math|''ξ''}} and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}} ({{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} − {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i'' {{=}} ''ξ''<sup>2</sup>)}} are the non-real cube roots of {{math|1}}. If {{mvar|u}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''', and {{mvar|v}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' such that {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} −''p''}}, then the roots of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + ''v''}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}}, since, in each case, we have the sum of a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' with a cube root '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' and moreover the product of these two roots is, in each case, equal to&nbsp;{{math|−&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}.\n\nNote that {{math|''ξ''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}} and that {{math|''ξ''<sup>4</sup> {{=}} ''ξ''}}. Thus Cardano's formula, written unambiguously to give the three roots, is\n\n:<math> t_k = \\xi^k \\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}+ \\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}} + \\xi^{2k} \\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}- \\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}}, \\quad k=0,1,2,</math>\n\nwhere the cube roots expressed as radicals are defined to be any pair of cube roots whose product is {{math|−&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}. If {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} < 0}}, this is the same thing as requiring that the cube roots be complex conjugates, while if {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} ≥ 0}}, the real cube roots can be chosen.\n\nCardano's formula, interpreted in this way, is equivalent to the [[#General formula|general solution given earlier]] when the coefficient of the quadratic term is {{math|0}}.\n\nWe will examine certain particular cases. Before that, it is convenient to note that, if {{mvar|u}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''', if {{mvar|v}} is a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|5}})''', and if both numbers {{mvar|p}} and {{math|''u''×''v''}} are real, then it is automatically true that {{math|''u''×''v'' {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}. This is so because\n:{{math|(''u''×''v'')<sup>3</sup> {{=}} ''u''<sup>3</sup>×''v''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} {{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} − ({{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}}) {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} {{=}} (−&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}})<sup>3</sup>}}.\nLet us now see the particular cases.\n* If {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real numbers and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} > 0}}, let {{mvar|u}} be the real cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and let {{mvar|v}} be the real cube root of '''({{EquationNote|5}})'''. Then {{math|''u''×''v'' {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}, because {{math|''u''×''v''}} is real. So, the roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + ''v''}} (which is a real number), {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}}. Each of the second and the third roots is the [[Complex conjugate|conjugate]] of the other one. This can be used to prove that they are non-real. Indeed, two real numbers are the conjugates of each other if and only if they are the same real number. But\n\n::{{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'' {{=}} {{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv'' ⇔ (''ξ'' − {{overline|''ξ''}})(''u'' − ''v'') {{=}} 0}},\n\n:and this last assertion is false, since {{math|''ξ'' ≠ {{overline|''ξ''}}}} and {{math|''u'' ≠ ''v''}} (because {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are real numbers whose cubes are distinct).\n* If {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are real numbers and {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} < 0}}, then the numbers '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' are complex numbers each of which is the conjugate of the other one. Let {{mvar|u}} be a cube root of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' and let {{mvar|v}} be the conjugate of {{mvar|u}}. Then {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}} is the conjugate of {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>}} and this proves that {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|5}})'''. So, again, since {{math|''u''×''v''}} is real we have {{math|''u''×''v'' {{=}} −&thinsp;{{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}, and therefore the roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + {{overline|''u''}}}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξu''}}}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξ''{{overline|''u''}}}}. In this case all roots are real, since each one of them is the sum of a complex number with its conjugate.\n* If {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0}}, then the roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are the cube roots of {{math|−''q''}}. This is compatible with Cardano's formula, because one of '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' or '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' is {{math|0}} and the other is {{math|−''q''}}.\n* If {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}, then the roots of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|0}} and the square roots of {{math|−''p''}}. Again, this is compatible with Cardano's formula, because if {{mvar|u}} is a square root of  {{math|{{frac|''p''|3}}}}, then {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>}} is a square root of {{math|{{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}}}}, and this square root is equal to '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' or to '''({{EquationNote|5}})''', since we are assuming that {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}}. If {{math|''v'' {{=}} −''u''}} is the other square root of  {{math|{{frac|''p''|3}}}} then, by the same reason, {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' or to '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' and furthermore if {{mvar|u}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|4}})''' then {{mvar|v}} is equal to '''({{EquationNote|5}})''' and vice versa. Because {{math|''v'' {{=}} −''u''}} we have {{math|''u'' + ''v''{{=}} 0}}. On the other hand, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'' {{=}} (''ξ'' − {{overline|''ξ''}})×''u''}} and so {{math|(''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'')<sup>2</sup> {{=}} (''ξ'' − {{overline|''ξ''}})<sup>2</sup>×''u''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} (−3)×{{sfrac|''p''|3}} {{=}} −''p''}}, which means that {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}} is a square root of {{math|−''p''}}. Finally, {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv'' {{=}} ({{overline|''ξ''}} − ''ξ'')×''u'' {{=}} −(''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'')}}, and so it must be the other square root of {{math|−''p''}}.\n* If {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} {{=}} 0}} (but {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are not {{math|0}}), then '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' has a simple root, which is {{math|{{sfrac|3''q''|''p''}}}}, and a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|double root]], which is {{math|−{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}. Again, this is compatible with Cardano's formula. To see why, note that asserting that {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} {{=}} 0}} is equivalent to asserting that {{math|{{sfrac|27''q''<sup>2</sup>|4''p''<sup>3</sup>}} {{=}} −1}}. If {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}, then {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} ''v''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} {{sfrac|27''q''<sup>3</sup>|8''p''<sup>3</sup>}} {{=}} −{{sfrac|''q''|2}}}} and {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} {{sfrac|27''q''<sup>2</sup>|4''p''<sup>2</sup>}} {{=}} −''p''}}. Thus, Cardano's formula says that the roots of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' are {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} 2''u'' {{=}} {{sfrac|3''q''|''p''}}}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v'' {{=}} (''ξ'' + {{overline|''ξ''}})×''u'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv'' {{=}} ({{overline|''ξ''}} + ''ξ'')×''u'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}}.\n\nIn this last case (that is, when {{math|{{sfrac|''q''<sup>2</sup>|4}} + {{sfrac|''p''<sup>3</sup>|27}} {{=}} 0}} but {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are not {{math|0}}), although the computations made above do suggest that {{math|{{sfrac|3''q''|''p''}}}} is a simple root of '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' whereas {{math|−{{sfrac|3''q''|2''p''}}}} is a double root (having been obtained in two different ways), they don't really prove it. However, this can be easily confirmed. Just note that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\left(x-\\frac{3q}p\\right)\\left(x+\\frac{3q}{2p}\\right)^2&=x^3-\\frac{27q^2}{4p^2}x-\\frac{27q^3}{4p^3}\\\\ &=x^3-\\frac{27q^2}{4p^3}px-\\frac{27q^2}{4p^3}q\\\\ &=x^3+px+q\\text{,}\\end{align}</math>\nsince {{math|{{sfrac|27''q''<sup>2</sup>|4''p''<sup>3</sup>}} {{=}} −1}}.\n\nThe numbers provided by Cardano's formula are solutions of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', but there might be other solutions besides these. However, this does not occur. Let {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} be numbers such that {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup> + ''v''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} −''q''}} and {{math|3''uv'' {{=}} −''p''}}. In order to see that {{math|''u'' + ''v''}}, {{math|''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}}, and {{math|{{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}} are the only roots of the polynomial {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q''}}, it is enough to notice that\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\bigl(t-\\bigl(u+v\\bigr)\\bigr)\\bigl(t-\\bigl(\\xi u+\\overline\\xi v\\bigr)\\bigr)\\bigl(t-\\bigl(\\overline\\xi u+\\xi v\\bigr)\\bigr)&=\nt^3-3uvt-u^3-v^3\\\\ &=t^3+pt+q\\text{.}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}} if and only if {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}}, {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''ξu'' + {{overline|''ξ''}}''v''}} or {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{overline|''ξ''}}''u'' + ''ξv''}}.\n\n=== Vieta's substitution ===\nStarting from the depressed cubic '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, we make the substitution {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''w'' − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}}, known as [[François Viète|Vieta's]] substitution. This results in the equation\n\n:<math>w^3+q-\\frac{p^3}{27w^3}=0.</math>\n\nMultiplying by {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup>}}, it becomes a [[sextic equation]] in {{mvar|w}}, which is in fact a quadratic equation in {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup>}}:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>w^6+qw^3-\\frac{p^3}{27}=0.</math>|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nThe [[quadratic formula]] allows equation '''({{EquationNote|6}})''' to be solved for {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup>}}. If {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{math|''w''<sub>3</sub>}} are the three [[cube root]]s of one of the solutions in {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup>}}, then the roots of the original depressed cubic are {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub> − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>1</sub>}}}}, {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub> − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>2</sub>}}}}, and {{math|''w''<sub>3</sub> − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>3</sub>}}}}. Another way of expressing the roots is to take {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}}; then the roots of the original depressed cubic are {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub> − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>1</sub>}}}}, {{math|''ξw''<sub>1</sub> − {{sfrac|''p''|3''ξw''<sub>1</sub>}}}}, and, {{math|''ξ''<sup>2</sup>''w''<sub>1</sub> − {{sfrac|''p''|3''ξ''<sup>2</sup>''w''<sub>1</sub>}}}}. This method only fails when both roots of the equation '''({{EquationNote|6}})''' are equal to {{math|0}}, but this only happens when {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, in which case the only solution of equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is {{math|0}}.\n\nActually, the substitution originally used by Vieta (in a text published posthumously in 1615) was {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}} − ''w''}}, but it leads to similar computations.<ref>{{Citation|last = van der Waerden|first = Bartel Leenert|author-link = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|title = A History of Algebra: From [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|al-Khwārizmī]] to [[Emmy Noether]]|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year = 1985|chapter = From Viète to Descartes|isbn = 3-540-13610-X}}</ref> More precisely, Vieta introduced a new variable {{mvar|w}} and he imposed the condition {{math|''w''(''t'' + ''w'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}.\n\nAs far as formulae are concerned, Vieta's approach leads to the same result as [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]]. However, it is theoretically simpler, for two reasons:\n* Each root of the equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''' is expressed from the start by an expression that involves a single cube root. Therefore, there is no ambiguity as in {{EquationNote|Cardano's formula}}.\n* It is nearly trivial that there are no other roots besides the ones obtained by this method. This follows from the fact that any complex number can be written as {{math|''w'' − {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}} for some other complex number&nbsp;{{mvar|w}}.\n\n===Lagrange's method===<!--This section is linked from [[Lagrange resolvents]] and [[Lagrange resolvent]] (singular) -->\n\nIn his paper ''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations'' (\"Thoughts on the algebraic solving of equations\"),<ref>{{Citation|last = Lagrange|first = Joseph-Louis|author-link = Joseph Louis Lagrange|chapter = Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations|title = Œuvres de Lagrange|editor-last = Serret|editor-first = Joseph-Alfred|editor-link = Joseph Alfred Serret|year = 1869|origyear = 1771|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|pages = 205–421|volume = III}}</ref> [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] introduced a new method to solve equations of low degree.\n\nThis method works well for cubic and [[quartic equations]], but Lagrange did not succeed in applying it to a [[quintic equation]], because it requires solving a resolvent polynomial of degree at least six.<ref name=\"efei\">{{citation\n|title=Elliptic functions and elliptic integrals\n|first1=Viktor\n|last1=Prasolov\n|first2=Yuri\n|last2=Solovyev\n|publisher=AMS Bookstore\n|year=1997\n|isbn=978-0-8218-0587-9\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fcp9IiZd3tQC\n}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=fcp9IiZd3tQC&pg=PA134#PPA134,M1 §6.2, p. 134]</ref><ref>{{citation\n|first=Morris\n|last=Kline\n|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times\n|publisher=Oxford University Press US\n|year=1990\n|isbn=978-0-19-506136-9\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aO-v3gvY-I8C\n}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=aO-v3gvY-I8C&printsec=frontcover#PPA597,M1 Algebra in the Eighteenth Century: The Theory of Equations]</ref><ref name=\"laz\">Daniel Lazard, \"Solving quintics in radicals\", in [[Olav Arnfinn Laudal]], [[Ragni Piene]], ''The Legacy of Niels Henrik Abel'', pp.&nbsp;207–225, Berlin, 2004,. {{isbn|3-540-43826-2}}</ref> This is explained by the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]], which proves that such polynomials cannot be solved by radicals. Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.<ref name=\"laz\" />\n\nIn the case of cubic equations, Lagrange's method gives the same solution as Cardano's. By drawing attention to a geometrical problem that involves two cubes of different size Cardano explains in his book ''Ars Magna'' how he arrived at the idea of considering the unknown of the cubic equation as a sum of two other quantities. Lagrange's method may also be applied directly to the general cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''', {{math|''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}}, without using the reduction to the depressed cubic equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}. Nevertheless, the computation is much easier with this reduced equation.\n\nSuppose that {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} are the roots of equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' or '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', and define {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{sqrt|3}}''i''}} (a complex cube root of {{math|1}}, i.e. a [[root of unity|primitive third root of unity]]) which satisfies the relation {{math|''ξ''<sup>2</sup> + ''ξ'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}. We now set\n:<math>s_0 = x_0 + x_1 + x_2,\\,</math>\n:<math>s_1 = x_0 + \\xi x_1 + \\xi^2 x_2,\\,</math>\n:<math>s_2 = x_0 + \\xi^2 x_1 + \\xi x_2.\\,</math>\nThis is the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of the roots: observe that while the coefficients of the polynomial are symmetric in the roots, in this formula an ''order'' has been chosen on the roots, so these are not symmetric in the roots. The roots may then be recovered from the three {{math|''s''<sub>''i''</sub>}} by inverting the above linear transformation via the inverse discrete Fourier transform, giving\n:<math>x_0 = \\tfrac13(s_0 + s_1 + s_2),\\,</math>\n:<math>x_1 = \\tfrac13(s_0 + \\xi^2 s_1 + \\xi s_2),\\,</math>\n:<math>x_2 = \\tfrac13(s_0 + \\xi s_1 + \\xi ^2 s_2).\\,</math>\n\nThe polynomial {{math|''s''<sub>0</sub>}} is equal, by [[Vieta's formulas]], to {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} in case of equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' and to {{math|0}} in case of equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', so we only need to seek values for the other two.\n\nThe polynomials {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are not [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric functions]] of the roots: {{math|''s''<sub>0</sub>}} is invariant, while the two non-trivial [[cyclic permutation]]s of the roots send {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''ξ''&thinsp;''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} to {{math|''ξ''<sup>2</sup>''s''<sub>2</sub>}}, or {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''ξ''<sup>2</sup>''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} to {{math|''ξ''&thinsp;''s''<sub>2</sub>}} (depending on which permutation), while transposing {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} switches {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}}; other transpositions switch these sums and multiply them by a power of {{math|''ξ''}}.\n\nThus {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>}}, {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are left invariant by the cyclic permutations of the roots, which multiply them by {{math|''ξ''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}}. Also {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + ''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} are left invariant by the transposition of {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} which exchanges {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}}. As the [[permutation group]] {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} of the roots is generated by these permutations, it follows that {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + ''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric functions]] of the roots and may thus be written as polynomials in the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s and thus as [[rational function]]s of the coefficients of the equation. Let {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + ''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> {{=}} ''A''}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''B''}} in these expressions, which will be explicitly computed below.\n\nWe have that {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} are the two roots of the quadratic equation {{math|''z''<sup>2</sup> − ''Az'' + ''B''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 0}}. Thus the resolution of the equation may be finished exactly as described for Cardano's method, with {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} in place of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}.\n\n====Computation of ''A'' and ''B''====\n\nSetting {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>0</sub> + ''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>0</sub>&thinsp;''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>1</sub>&thinsp;''x''<sub>2</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''E''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>0</sub>&thinsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>&thinsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, the elementary symmetric polynomials, we have, using that {{math|''ξ''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}}:\n:<math>s_1^3=x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3+3\\xi (x_0^2x_1+x_1^2x_2+x_2^2x_0)+3\\xi^2 (x_0x_1^2+x_1x_2^2+x_2x_0^2) +6x_0x_1x_2\\,. </math>\nThe expression for {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} is the same with {{math|''ξ''}} and {{math|''ξ''<sup>2</sup>}} exchanged. Thus, using {{math|''ξ''<sup>2</sup> + ''ξ'' {{=}} −1}} we get\n:<math>\nA=s_1^3+s_2^3=2(x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3)-3(x_0^2x_1+x_1^2x_2+x_2^2x_0+x_0x_1^2+x_1x_2^2+x_2x_0^2)+12x_0x_1x_2\\,,\n</math>\nand a straightforward computation gives \n:<math>\nA=s_1^3+s_2^3=2E_1^3-9E_1E_2+27E_3\\,.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly we have \n:<math>\nB=s_1s_2=x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2+(\\xi+\\xi^2)(x_0x_1+x_1x_2+x_2x_0)=E_1^2-3E_2\\,.\n</math>\n\nWhen solving equation '''({{EquationNote|1}})''' we have {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} −{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} and {{math|''E''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} −{{sfrac|''d''|''a''}}}}. With equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', we have {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''p''}} and {{math|''E''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} −''q''}} and thus {{math|''A'' {{=}} −27''q''}} and {{math|''B'' {{=}} −3''p''}}.\n\nNote that with equation '''({{EquationNote|2}})''', we have {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}(''s''<sub>1</sub> + ''s''<sub>2</sub>)}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} −3''p''}}, while in Cardano's method we have set {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}} and {{math|''uv'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|3}}''p''}}. Thus we have, up to the exchange of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 3''u''}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3''v''}} . In other words, in this case, Cardano's method and Lagrange's method compute exactly the same things, up to a factor of three in the auxiliary variables, the main difference being that Lagrange's method explains why these auxiliary variables appear in the problem.\n\n==General solution to the cubic equation with arbitrary coefficients==\n\nIf we are dealing with a cubic equation whose coefficients belong to some field {{mvar|k}} (whose [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is either {{math|0}} or greater than {{math|3}}), then what was [[#Algebraic solution|done above algebraically]] still works, with one exception: the results concerning the [[#The discriminant|sign of the discriminant]], since they make no sense for general fields, although the fact that the equation has a multiple root if and only if {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}} is still true (and for the same reason). In this more general case, we work with an [[field extension|extension]] {{mvar|K}} of {{mvar|k}} in which every non-zero element has two square roots and three cube roots. For instance, if {{math|''k'' {{=}} '''Q'''}}, we can take {{math|''K'' {{=}} {{overline|'''Q'''}}}}, the [[Algebraic number#The field of algebraic numbers|field of algebraic numbers]].\n\nIn particular, all that was done above algebraically still works if {{math|''k'' {{=}} ''K'' {{=}} '''C'''}}. Therefore, every cubic equation with complex coefficients has some complex root, which is a particular case of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\nIn this general context, the formulae for roots [[#Multiple roots.2C .CE.94 .3D 0|in the case in which {{math|Δ {{=}} 0}}]] show that these roots also belong to the field {{mvar|k}}.\n\nIn a field {{mvar|k}} whose [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is either {{math|2}} or {{math|3}}, this approach does not work because then the formulae for the roots became meaningless, since they involve division by {{math|2}} and {{math|3}}.\n\n==Galois groups of irreducible cubics==\n\nThe [[Galois theory#Permutation group approach to Galois theory|Galois group]] of an irreducible [[separable polynomial]] of degree {{mvar|n}} is a [[Symmetric group#Transitive subgroups|transitive subgroup]] of [[Symmetric group|{{math|''S<sub>n</sub>''}}]]. In particular, the Galois group of an irreducible separable cubic is a transitive subgroup of {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} and there are only two such subgroups: {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} and [[Alternating group|{{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}}]]. There is a simple way of determining the Galois group of a concrete irreducible cubic {{math|''f''(''x'')}} over a field {{mvar|k}}: it is {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} if the discriminant of the cubic is the square of an element of {{mvar|k}} and {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} otherwise. Indeed, if {{math|Δ}} is not the square of an element of {{mvar|k}}, then {{math|''k''[{{sqrt|Δ}}]}} is an extension of [[Degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|2}} of {{mvar|k}}. On the other hand, if {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''r''<sub>3</sub>}} are the roots of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, then, since the equality '''({{EquationNote|3}})''' holds, that is, since {{math|Δ {{=}} (''a''<sup>2</sup>(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>2</sub>)(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)(''r''<sub>2</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>))<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''k''[{{sqrt|Δ}}] ⊂ ''k''[''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>3</sub>]}}, and so, by the [[Degree of a field extension#The multiplicativity formula for degrees|multiplicativity formula for degrees]], the degree of {{math|''k''[''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>3</sub>]}} over {{mvar|k}} (that is, the order of the Galois group of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}) must be a multiple of the degree of {{math|''k''[{{sqrt|Δ}}]}}, which is {{math|2}}. Therefore, it must be an even number, and so the Galois group can only be {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}}.\n\nOn the other hand, if {{math|Δ}} ''is'' the square of an element of {{mvar|k}}, then, again by the equality '''({{EquationNote|3}})''', we have {{math|(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>2</sub>)(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)(''r''<sub>2</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>) ∈ ''k''}}. Therefore, if&nbsp;{{math|''σ''}} belongs to the Galois group of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, then {{math|''σ''}} maps {{math|(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>2</sub>)(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)(''r''<sub>2</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)}} into itself. But then {{math|''σ''}} cannot act on the set {{math|{''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>3</sub>}}} as the [[Symmetric group#Transpositions|transposition]] that exchanges {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} and leaves {{math|''r''<sub>3</sub>}} fixed, because then {{math|''σ''}} would map {{math|(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>2</sub>)(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)(''r''<sub>2</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)}} into {{math|−(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>2</sub>)(''r''<sub>1</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)(''r''<sub>2</sub> − ''r''<sub>3</sub>)}}. So, in this case, the Galois group of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is not {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} and therefore it must be {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}}.\n\nIt is clear from this criterion that, if we are working over the field {{math|'''Q'''}}, the Galois group of most irreducible cubic polynomials is {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}}. An example of an irreducible cubic polynomial with rational coefficients whose Galois group is {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} is {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> − 3''x'' − 1}}, whose discriminant is {{math|81 {{=}} 9<sup>2</sup>}}. The polynomial {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is used in the [[Angle trisection#Proof of impossibility|standard proof of the impossibility]] of trisecting arbitrary angles using straightedge and compass only.\n\n==Collinearities==\n[[File:Cubica colinear.png|thumb|The points {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''P''<sub>3</sub>}} (in blue) are collinear and belong to the graph of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + {{sfrac|3|2}}''x''<sup>2</sup> − {{sfrac|5|2}}''x'' + {{sfrac|5|4}}}}. The points {{math|''T''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''T''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''T''<sub>3</sub>}} (in red) are the intersections of the (dotted) tangent lines to the graph at these points with the graph itself.

If the cubic is defined by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d''}} and if {{mvar|α}} is a real number, then the tangent to the graph of {{mvar|f}} at the point {{math|(''α'', ''f''(''α''))}} is the line\n\n:{{math|{(''x'', ''f''(''α'') + (''x'' − ''α'')''f''&thinsp;′(''α'')) : ''x'' ∈ '''R'''}}}.\n\nSo, the intersection point between this line and the graph of {{mvar|f}} can be obtained solving the equation {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''α'') + (''x'' − ''α'')''f''&thinsp;′(''α'')}}. This is a cubic equation, but it is clear that {{mvar|α}} is a root, and in fact a double root, since the line is tangent to the graph. The remaining root is {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}} − 2''α''}}. So, the other intersection point between the tangent line and the graph of&nbsp;{{mvar|f}} is the point\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left(-\\frac ba-2\\alpha,f\\left(-\\frac ba-2\\alpha\\right)\\right) \\\\[3pt]\n= {} & \\left(-\\frac ba-2\\alpha,-8a\\alpha^3-8b\\alpha^2-2\\left( \\frac{b^2}a + c\\right) \\alpha-\\frac{bc}a+d\\right) \\\\[3pt]\n= {} & \\left(-\\frac ba-2\\alpha,-\\frac{bc}a+9d+\\left(6c-2\\frac{b^2}a\\right)\\alpha-8f(\\alpha)\\right).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, if {{mvar|P}} is a point of the graph of {{mvar|f}}, the other intersection point between the tangent line at {{mvar|P}} and the graph is the point {{math|''A''(''P'')}}, where {{mvar|A}} is the map defined by\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA : \\mathbb{R}^2 & \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\[4pt]\n(x,y) & \\mapsto \\left(-\\frac ba-2x,-\\frac{bc}a+9d+\\left(6c-2\\frac{b^2}a\\right)x-8y\\right).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSince {{mvar|A}} is an [[Affine transformation|affine map]], if {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|''P''<sub>3</sub>}} are collinear, then so are the points {{math|''A''(''P''<sub>1</sub>)}}, {{math|''A''(''P''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|''A''(''P''<sub>3</sub>)}}.\n\n==Symmetry==\n\nThe [[graph of a function|graph]] of a cubic function has {{math|180°}} rotational or point symmetry about its inflection point.

Since {{math|''f''&thinsp;′′(''x'') {{=}} 6''ax'' + 2''b''}}, the inflection point is {{math|(−{{sfrac|''b''|3''a''}}, {{sfrac|2''b''<sup>3</sup>|27''a''<sup>2</sup>}} − {{sfrac|''bc''|3''a''}} + ''d''&thinsp;)}}.

      "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\nThe '''degree of a [[polynomial]]''' is the highest of the degrees of its [[monomial]]s (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients. The [[degree of a monomial|degree of a term]] is the sum of the exponents of the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that appear in it, and thus is a non-negative integer. The term '''order''' has been used as a synonym of ''degree'' but, nowadays, may refer to several other concepts (see [[order of a polynomial (disambiguation)]]).\nFor example, the polynomial <math>7x^2y^3 + 4x - 9,</math> which can also be expressed as <math>7x^2y^3 + 4x^1y^0 - 9x^0y^0,</math> has three terms. The first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of the [[exponentiation|powers]] 2 and 3), the second term has a degree of 1, and the last term has a degree of 0. Therefore, the polynomial has a degree of 5, which is the highest degree of any term.\n\nTo determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form (for example:<math>(x+1)^2-(x-1)^2</math>), one has to put it first in standard form by expanding the products (by [[distributivity]]) and combining the like terms; for example <math> (x+1)^2-(x-1)^2= 4x</math> is of degree 1, even though each summand has degree 2. However, this is not needed when the polynomial is expressed as a product of polynomials in standard form, because the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors.\n\n==Names of polynomials by degree==\n{{wiktionary|Appendix:English polynomial degrees}}\nThe following names are assigned to polynomials according to their degree:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56413.html | title=Names of Polynomials | date=November 25, 1997| accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref><ref>Mac Lane and Birkhoff (1999) define \"linear\", \"quadratic\", \"cubic\", \"quartic\", and \"quintic\". (p. 107)</ref><ref>King (2009) defines \"quadratic\", \"cubic\", \"quartic\", \"quintic\", \"sextic\", \"septic\", and \"octic\".</ref>\n* Special case – [[Zero polynomial|zero]] (see [[#Degree of the zero polynomial|§ Degree of the zero polynomial]] below)\n* Degree 0 – non-zero [[constant function|constant]]<ref>Shafarevich (2003) says of a polynomial of degree zero, <math>f(x)=a_0</math>: \"Such a polynomial is called a ''constant'' because if we substitute different values of ''x'' in it, we always obtain the same value <math>a_0</math>.\" (p. 23)</ref>\n* Degree 1 – [[linear function|linear]]\n* Degree 2 – [[quadratic polynomial|quadratic]]\n* Degree 3 – [[cubic function|cubic]]\n* Degree 4 – [[quartic function|quartic]] (or, if all terms have even degree, [[biquadratic function|biquadratic]])\n* Degree 5 – [[quintic equation|quintic]]\n* Degree 6 – [[sextic equation|sextic]] (or, less commonly, [[hexic equation|hexic]])\n* Degree 7 – [[septic equation|septic]] (or, less commonly, [[heptic equation|heptic]])\nFor higher degrees, names have sometimes been proposed,<ref>[[James Cockle]] proposed the names \"sexic\", \"septic\", \"octic\", \"nonic\", and \"decic\" in 1851. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cxIFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=sexic%20septic%20octic%20nonic%20decic&f=false ''Mechanics Magazine'', Vol. LV, p. 171])</ref> but they are rarely used:\n* Degree 8 – [[octic equation|octic]]\n* Degree 9 – nonic\n* Degree 10 – decic\n\nNames for degree above three are based on Latin [[ordinal number]]s, and end in ''-ic''. This should be distinguished from the names used for the number of variables, the [[arity]], which are based on Latin [[distributive number]]s, and end in ''-ary''. For example, a degree two polynomial in two variables, such as <math>x^2 + xy + y^2</math>, is called a \"binary quadratic\": ''binary'' due to two variables, ''quadratic'' due to degree two.{{efn|For simplicity, this is a [[homogeneous polynomial]], with equal degree in both variables separately.}} There are also names for the number of terms, which are also based on Latin distributive numbers, ending in ''-nomial''; the common ones are ''[[monomial]]'', ''[[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]'', and (less commonly) ''[[trinomial]]''; thus <math>x^2 + y^2</math> is a \"binary quadratic binomial\".\n\n==Other examples==\n*The polynomial <math>3 - 5 x + 2 x^5 - 7 x^9</math> is a nonic polynomial\n*The polynomial <math>(y - 3)(2y + 6)(-4y - 21)</math> is a cubic polynomial\n*The polynomial <math>(3 z^8 + z^5 - 4 z^2 + 6) + (-3 z^8 + 8 z^4 + 2 z^3 + 14 z)</math> is a quintic polynomial (as the <math>z^8</math> are cancelled out)\n\nThe canonical forms of the three examples above are:\n\n*for <math>3 - 5 x + 2 x^5 - 7 x^9</math>, after reordering, <math>- 7 x^9 + 2 x^5 - 5 x + 3</math>;\n*for <math>(y - 3)(2y + 6)(-4y - 21)</math>, after multiplying out and collecting terms of the same degree, <math>- 8 y^3 - 42 y^2 + 72 y + 378</math>;\n*for <math>(3 z^8 + z^5 - 4 z^2 + 6) + (-3 z^8 + 8 z^4 + 2 z^3 + 14 z)</math>, in which the two terms of degree 8 cancel, <math>z^5 + 8 z^4 + 2 z^3 - 4 z^2 + 14 z + 6</math>.\n\n==Behavior under polynomial operations==\nThe degree of the sum, the product or the composition of two polynomials is strongly related to the degree of the input polynomials.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Sergei|title=Algebra|date=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-95385-4|pages=100|edition=3rd|ref=lang}}</ref>\n===Addition===\nThe degree of the sum (or difference) of two polynomials is less than or equal to the greater of their degrees; the equality always holds when the degrees of the polynomials are different i.e.\n\n:<math>\\deg(P + Q) \\leq \\max(\\deg(P),\\deg(Q))</math>.\n:<math>\\deg(P - Q) \\leq \\max(\\deg(P),\\deg(Q))</math>.\n\nE.g.\n\n*The degree of <math>(x^3+x)+(x^2+1)=x^3+x^2+x+1</math> is 3.   Note that 3&nbsp;≤&nbsp;max(3,&nbsp;2)\n*The degree of <math>(x^3+x)-(x^3+x^2)=-x^2+x</math> is 2.   Note that 2&nbsp;≤&nbsp;max(3,&nbsp;3)\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n\nThe degree of the product of a polynomial by a non-zero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] is equal to the degree of the polynomial, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\deg(cP)=\\deg(P)</math>.\n\nE.g.\n\n*The degree of <math>2(x^2+3x-2)=2x^2+6x-4</math> is 2, just as the degree of <math>x^2+3x-2</math>.\n\nNote that for polynomials over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] containing [[divisors of zero]], this is not necessarily true. For example, in [[Integers_modulo_n#Ring_of_congruence_classes|<math>\\mathbf{Z}/4\\mathbf{Z}</math>]], <math>\\deg(1+2x) = 1</math>, but <math>\\deg(2(1+2x)) = \\deg(2+4x) =\\deg(2) = 0</math>.\n\nThe [[Polynomial vector spaces|set of polynomials with coefficients from a given field F and degree smaller than or equal to a given number n]] thus forms a [[vector space]]. (Note, however, that this set is not a ring, as it is not closed under multiplication, as is seen below.)\n\n===Multiplication===\n\nThe degree of the product of two polynomials over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] or an [[integral domain]] is the sum of their degrees:\n:<math>\\deg(PQ) = \\deg(P) + \\deg(Q)</math>.\n\nE.g.\n*The degree of <math>(x^3+x)(x^2+1)=x^5+2x^3+x</math> is 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.\n\nNote that for polynomials over an arbitrary ring, this is not necessarily true. For example, in <math>\\mathbf{Z}/4\\mathbf{Z}</math>, <math>\\deg(2x) + \\deg(1+2x) = 1 + 1 = 2</math>, but <math>\\deg(2x(1+2x)) = \\deg(2x) = 1</math>.\n\n===Composition===\nThe degree of the composition of two non-constant polynomials <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> over a field or [[integral domain]] is the product of their degrees:\n:<math>\\deg(P \\circ Q) = \\deg(P)\\deg(Q)</math>.\n\nE.g.\n*If <math>P = (x^3+x)</math>, <math>Q = (x^2+1)</math>, then <math>P \\circ Q = P \\circ (x^2+1) = (x^2+1)^3+(x^2+1) = x^6+3x^4+4x^2+2</math>, which has degree 6.\n\nNote that for polynomials over an arbitrary ring, this is not necessarily true. For example, in <math>\\mathbf{Z}/4\\mathbf{Z}</math>, <math>\\deg(2x) \\deg(1+2x) = 1\\cdot 1 = 1</math>, but <math>\\deg(2x\\circ(1+2x)) = \\deg(2+4x)=\\deg(2) = 0</math>.\n\n==Degree of the zero polynomial==\n\nThe degree of the [[zero polynomial]] is either left undefined, or is defined to be negative (usually −1 or <math>-\\infty</math>).<ref>\nShafarevich (2003) says of the zero polynomial: \"In this case, we consider that the degree of the polynomial is undefined.\" (p. 27)<br />\nChilds (1995) uses −1. (p. 233)<br />\nChilds (2009) uses −∞ (p. 287), however he excludes zero polynomials in his Proposition 1 (p. 288) and then explains that the proposition holds for zero polynomials \"with the reasonable assumption that <math>-\\infty</math> + ''m'' = <math>-\\infty</math> for ''m'' any integer or ''m'' = <math>-\\infty</math>\".<br />\nAxler (1997) uses −∞. (p. 64)<br />\nGrillet (2007) says: \"The degree of the zero polynomial 0 is sometimes left undefined or is variously defined as −1 ∈ ℤ or as <math>-\\infty</math>, as long as deg 0 < deg A for all A ≠ 0.\" (A is a polynomial.) However, he excludes zero polynomials in his Proposition 5.3. (p. 121)\n</ref>\n\nLike any constant value, the value 0 can be considered as a (constant) polynomial, called the zero polynomial. It has no nonzero terms, and so, strictly speaking, it has no degree either. As such, its degree is undefined. The propositions for the degree of sums and products of polynomials in the above section do not apply if any of the polynomials involved is the zero polynomial.<ref>{{MathWorld|author=Barile, Margherita|id=ZeroPolynomial|title=Zero Polynomial}}</ref>\n\nIt is convenient, however, to define the degree of the zero polynomial to be ''negative infinity'', <math>-\\infty,</math> and introduce the arithmetic rules<ref>Axler (1997) gives these rules and says: \"The 0 polynomial is declared to have degree <math>-\\infty</math> so that exceptions are not needed for various reasonable results.\" (p. 64)</ref>\n:<math> \\max(a,-\\infty) = a ,</math>\nand\n:<math> a + (-\\infty) = -\\infty .</math>\n\nThese examples illustrate how this extension satisfies the [[#Behavior under polynomial operations|behavior rules]] above:\n*The degree of the sum <math>(x^3+x)+(0)=x^3+x</math> is 3.  This satisfies the expected behavior, which is that <math>3 \\le \\max(3, -\\infty)</math>.\n*The degree of the difference <math>(x)-(x) = 0</math> is <math>-\\infty</math>.  This satisfies the expected behavior, which is that <math>-\\infty \\le \\max(1,1)</math>.\n*The degree of the product <math>(0)(x^2+1)=0</math> is <math>-\\infty</math>.  This satisfies the expected behavior, which is that <math>-\\infty = -\\infty + 2</math>.\n\n==Computed from the function values==\nA number of formulae exist which will evaluate the degree of a polynomial function ''f''. One based on [[asymptotic analysis]] is\n:<math>\\deg f = \\lim_{x\\rarr\\infty}\\frac{\\log |f(x)|}{\\log x}</math>;\nthis is the exact counterpart of the method of estimating the slope in a [[log–log plot]].\n\nThis formula generalizes the concept of degree to some functions that are not polynomials.\nFor example:\n*The degree of the [[multiplicative inverse]], <math>\\ 1/x</math>, is &minus;1.\n*The degree of the [[square root]], <math>\\sqrt x </math>, is 1/2.\n*The degree of the [[logarithm]], <math>\\ \\log x</math>, is 0.\n*The degree of the [[exponential function]], <math>\\exp x</math>, is <math>\\infty.</math>\nNote that the formula also gives sensible results for many combinations of such functions, e.g., the degree of <math>\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{x}}{x}</math> is <math>-1/2</math>.\n\nAnother formula to compute the degree of ''f'' from its values is\n:<math>\\deg f = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)}</math>;\nthis second formula follows from applying [[L'Hôpital's rule]] to the first formula. Intuitively though, it is more about exhibiting the degree ''d'' as the extra constant factor in the derivative <math> d x^{d-1} </math> of <math> x^d </math>.\n\nA more fine grained (than a simple numeric degree) description of the asymptotics of a function can be had by using [[big O notation]]. In the [[analysis of algorithms]], it is for example often relevant to distinguish between the growth rates of <math> x </math> and <math> x \\log x </math>, which would both come out as having the ''same'' degree according to the above formulae.\n\n==Extension to polynomials with two or more variables==\nFor polynomials in two or more variables, the degree of a term is the ''sum'' of the exponents of the variables in the term; the degree (sometimes called the '''total degree''') of the polynomial is again the maximum of the degrees of all terms in the polynomial. For example, the polynomial ''x''<sup>2</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup> + 3''x''<sup>3</sup> + 4''y'' has degree 4, the same degree as the term ''x''<sup>2</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nHowever, a polynomial in variables ''x'' and ''y'', is a polynomial in ''x'' with coefficients which are polynomials in ''y'', and also a polynomial in ''y'' with coefficients which are polynomials in ''x''. The polynomial\n:<math>x^2y^2 + 3x^3 + 4y = (3)x^3 + (y^2)x^2 + (4y) =  (x^2)y^2 + (4)y  + (3x^3)</math>\nhas degree 3 in ''x'' and degree 2 in ''y''.\n\n==Degree function in abstract algebra==\nGiven a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] R, the [[polynomial ring]] R[''x''] is the set of all polynomials in ''x'' that have coefficients chosen from R. In the special case that R is also a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then the polynomial ring R[''x''] is a [[principal ideal domain]] and, more importantly to our discussion here, a [[Euclidean domain]].\n\nIt can be shown that the degree of a polynomial over a field satisfies all of the requirements of the ''norm'' function in the euclidean domain. That is, given two polynomials ''f''(''x'') and ''g''(''x''), the degree of the product ''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'') must be larger than both the degrees of ''f'' and ''g'' individually. In fact, something stronger holds:\n: deg(''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'')) = deg(''f''(''x'')) + deg(''g''(''x''))\n\nFor an example of why the degree function may fail over a ring that is not a field, take the following example. Let R = <math>\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}</math>, the ring of integers [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4. This ring is not a field (and is not even an [[integral domain]]) because 2 × 2 = 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, let ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1. Then, ''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'') = 4''x''<sup>2</sup> + 4''x'' + 1 = 1. Thus deg(''f''⋅''g'') = 0 which is not greater than the degrees of ''f'' and ''g'' (which each had degree 1).\n\nSince the ''norm'' function is not defined for the zero element of the ring, we consider the degree of the polynomial ''f''(''x'') = 0 to also be undefined so that it follows the rules of a norm in a euclidean domain.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation |last=Axler |first=Sheldon |author-link=Sheldon Axler |year=1997 |title=Linear Algebra Done Right |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&lpg=PA64&vq=%220%20polynomial%22&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=%220%20polynomial%22&f=false |accessdate= }}\n*{{Citation |last=Childs |first=Lindsay N. |year=1995 |title=A Concrete Introduction to Higher Algebra |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUApHgaTVx0C&lpg=PA279&vq=%22zero%20polynomial%22&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q=%22zero%20polynomial%22&f=false |accessdate= }}\n*{{Citation |last=Childs |first=Lindsay N. |year=2009 |title=A Concrete Introduction to Higher Algebra |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyDAKBr_I2YC&lpg=PA288&vq=%22zero%20polynomial%22&pg=PA287#v=onepage&q=%22zero%20polynomial%22&f=false |accessdate= }}\n*{{Citation |last=Grillet |first=Pierre Antoine |year=2007 |title=Abstract Algebra |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJtyhu8-xYwC&lpg=PA121&vq=%22degree%20of%20the%20zero%20polynomial%22&pg=PA121#v=onepage&q=%22degree%20of%20the%20zero%20polynomial%22&f=false |accessdate= }}\n*{{Citation |last=King |first=R.

If <math>N+P</math> is an odd integer, then <math>N-P</math> is odd as well.  Similarly, this same argument shows that when <math>n</math> is even, <math>N-P</math> will be even.  Equation (15) shows that if <math>N-P</math> is even, <math>\\theta</math> is an integer multiple of <math>\\pi</math>.  Therefore, <math>\\tan(\\theta)</math> is defined for <math>n</math> even, and is thus the proper index to use when n is even, and similarly <math>\\tan(\\theta') = \\tan(\\theta+\\pi) = -\\cot(\\theta)</math> is defined for <math>n</math> odd, making it the proper index in this latter case.\n\n\nThus, from (6) and (23), for <math>n</math> even:\n\n\n: <math>\\Delta = I_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{-\\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]}{\\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]}= I_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{b_0\\omega^{n-1}-b_1\\omega^{n-3}+\\cdots}{a_0\\omega^n-a_1\\omega^{n-2}+\\ldots}  \\quad (25)</math>\n\n\nand from (19) and (24), for <math>n</math> odd:\n\n\n:<math>\\Delta = I_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{\\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]}{\\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]}= I_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{b_0\\omega^{n-1}-b_1\\omega^{n-3}+\\ldots}{a_0\\omega^n-a_1\\omega^{n-2}+\\ldots}  \\quad (26)</math>\n\n\nLo and behold we are evaluating the same Cauchy index for both:\n\n\n<math>\\Delta = I_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{b_0\\omega^{n-1}-b_1\\omega^{n-3}+\\ldots}{a_0\\omega^n-a_1\\omega^{n-2}+\\ldots}    \\quad (27)</math>\n\n== Sturm's theorem ==\n\n\n[[Sturm theorem|Sturm]] gives us a method for evaluating <math>\\Delta = I_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{f_2(x)}{f_1(x)}</math>.

It can be observed that the sequence so constructed will satisfy the conditions of Sturm's theorem, and thus an algorithm for determining the stated index has been developed.\n\n\nIt is in applying Sturm's theorem (28) to (29), through the use of the Euclidean algorithm above that the Routh matrix is formed.\n\n\nWe get\n\n\n:<math>f_3(\\omega) = \\frac {a_0}{b_0}f_2(\\omega) - f_1(\\omega)   \\quad (30) </math>\n\n\nand identifying the coefficients of this remainder by <math>c_0</math>, <math>-c_1</math>, <math>c_2</math>, <math>-c_3</math>, and so forth, makes our formed remainder \n\n\n:<math>f_3(\\omega) = c_0\\omega^{n-2} - c_1\\omega^{n-4} + c_2\\omega^{n-6} - \\cdots   \\quad (31)</math>\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n:<math>c_0 = a_1 - \\frac{a_0}{b_0}b_1 = \\frac{b_0a_1 - a_1b_0}{b_0}; c_1 = a_2 - \\frac{a_0}{b_0}b_2 = \\frac{b_0a_2 - a_0b_2}{b_0};\\ldots   \\quad (32)</math>\n\n\nContinuing with the Euclidean algorithm on these new coefficients gives us\n\n\n:<math>f_4(\\omega) = \\frac {b_0}{c_0}f_3(\\omega) - f_2(\\omega)   \\quad (33)</math>\n\n\nwhere we again denote the coefficients of the remainder <math>f_4(\\omega)</math> by <math>d_0</math>, <math>-d_1</math>, <math>d_2</math>, <math>-d_3</math>,\n\n\nmaking our formed remainder \n\n\n:<math>f_4(\\omega) = d_0\\omega^{n-3} - d_1\\omega^{n-5} + d_2\\omega^{n-7} - \\cdots   \\quad (34)</math>\n\n\nand giving us\n\n\n:<math>d_0 = b_1 - \\frac{b_0}{c_0}c_1 = \\frac{c_0b_1 - b_1c_0}{c_0}; d_1 = b_2 - \\frac{b_0}{c_0}c_2 = \\frac{c_0b_2 - b_0c_2}{c_0};\\ldots   \\quad (35)</math>\n\n\nThe rows of the Routh array are determined exactly by this algorithm when applied to the coefficients of (20).  An observation worthy of note is that in the regular case the polynomials <math>f_1(\\omega)</math> and <math>f_2(\\omega)</math> have as the highest common factor <math>f_{n+1}(\\omega)</math> and thus there will be <math>n</math> polynomials in the chain <math>f_1(x),f_2(x), \\dots, f_m(x)</math>.\n\n\nNote now, that in determining the signs of the members of the sequence of polynomials <math>f_1(x),f_2(x), \\dots,f_m(x)</math> that at <math>\\omega = \\pm \\infty</math> the dominating power of <math>\\omega</math> will be the first term of each of these polynomials, and thus only these coefficients corresponding to the highest powers of <math>\\omega</math> in <math>f_1(x),f_2(x), \\dots</math>, and <math>f_m(x)</math>, which are <math>a_0</math>, <math>b_0</math>, <math>c_0</math>, <math>d_0</math>, ... determine the signs of <math>f_1(x)</math>, <math>f_2(x)</math>, ..., <math>f_m(x)</math> at <math>\\omega = \\pm\\infty</math>.\n\n\nSo we get <math>V(+\\infty)=V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \\dots)</math> that is, <math>V(+\\infty)</math> is the number of changes of sign in the sequence <math>a_0\\infty^n</math>, <math>b_0\\infty^{n-1}</math>, <math>c_0\\infty^{n-2}</math>, ... which is the number of sign changes in the sequence <math>a_0</math>, <math>b_0</math>, <math>c_0</math>, <math>d_0</math>, ... and <math>V(-\\infty)=V(a_0, -b_0, c_0, -d_0, ...)</math>; that is <math>V(-\\infty)</math> is the number of changes of sign in the sequence <math>a_0(-\\infty)^n</math>, <math>b_0(-\\infty)^{n-1}</math>, <math>c_0(-\\infty)^{n-2}</math>, ... which is the number of sign changes in the sequence <math>a_0</math>, <math>-b_0</math>, <math>c_0</math>, <math>-d_0</math>, ... \n\n\nSince our chain <math>a_0</math>, <math>b_0</math>, <math>c_0</math>, <math>d_0</math>, ... will have <math>n</math> members it is clear that <math>V(+\\infty) + V(-\\infty) = n</math> since within <math>V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \\dots)</math> if going from <math>a_0</math> to <math>b_0</math> a sign change has not occurred, within \n<math>V(a_0, -b_0, c_0, -d_0, \\dots)</math> going from <math>a_0</math> to <math>-b_0</math> one has, and likewise for all <math>n</math> transitions (there will be no terms equal to zero) giving us <math>n</math> total sign changes.\n\n\nAs <math>\\Delta = V(-\\infty) - V(+\\infty)</math> and <math>n = V(+\\infty) + V(-\\infty)</math>, and from (18) <math>P = (n - \\Delta/2)</math>, we have that <math>P = V(+\\infty) = V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \\dots)</math> and have derived Routh's theorem -\n\n\n'''''The number of roots of a real polynomial <math>f(z)</math> which lie in the right half plane <math>\\mathfrak{Re}(r_i) > 0</math> is equal to the number of changes of sign in the first column of the Routh scheme.'''''\n\n\nAnd for the stable case where <math>P = 0</math> then <math>V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \\dots) = 0</math> by  which we have Routh's famous criterion:\n\n\n'''''In order for all the roots of the polynomial <math>f(z)</math> to have negative real parts, it is necessary and sufficient that all of the elements in the first column of the Routh scheme be different from zero and of the same sign.'''''\n\n\n\n\n==References==\n*Hurwitz, A., \"On the Conditions under which an Equation has only Roots with Negative Real Parts\", Rpt. in Selected Papers on Mathematical Trends in Control Theory, Ed.

      "title": "Eisenstein's criterion",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstein%27s_criterion",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Eisenstein<nowiki>'s</nowiki> criterion''' gives a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient condition]] for a [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients to be [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the [[rational number]]s—that is, for it to be unfactorizable into the product of non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nThis criterion is not applicable to all polynomials with integer coefficients that are irreducible over the rational numbers, but it does allow in certain important cases for irreducibility to be proved with very little effort. It may apply either directly or after transformation of the original polynomial.\n\nThis criterion is named after [[Gotthold Eisenstein]]. In the early 20th century, it was also known as the '''Schönemann–Eisenstein theorem''' because [[Theodor Schönemann]] was the first to publish it.<ref name=\"Cox\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Dorwart|1935}}.</ref>\n\n==Criterion==\n\nSuppose we have the following polynomial with integer [[coefficients]].\n\n: <math>Q(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1x+a_0</math>\n\nIf there exists a [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}} such that the following three conditions all apply:\n\n*{{mvar|p}} divides each {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}} for {{math|''i'' ≠ ''n''}},\n*{{mvar|p}} does ''not'' divide {{math|''a<sub>n</sub>''}}, and\n*{{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}} does ''not'' divide {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>}},\n\nthen {{mvar|Q}} is irreducible over the rational numbers. It will also be irreducible over the integers, unless all its coefficients have a nontrivial factor in common (in which case {{mvar|Q}} as integer polynomial will have some prime number, necessarily distinct from {{mvar|p}}, as an irreducible factor). The latter possibility can be avoided by first making {{mvar|Q}} [[Primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive]], by dividing it by the [[greatest common divisor]] of its coefficients (the [[content (algebra)|content]] of {{mvar|Q}}). This division does not change whether {{mvar|Q}} is reducible or not over the rational numbers (see [[Polynomial factorization#Primitive part–content factorization|Primitive part–content factorization]] for details), and will not invalidate the hypotheses of the criterion for {{mvar|p}} (on the contrary it could make the criterion hold for some prime, even if it did not before the division).\n\n==Examples==\n\nEisenstein's criterion may apply either directly (i.e., using the original polynomial) or after transformation of the original polynomial.\n\n===Direct (without transformation)===\n\nConsider the polynomial {{math|''Q(x)'' {{=}} 3''x''<sup>4</sup> + 15''x''<sup>2</sup> + 10}}. In order for Eisenstein's criterion to apply for a prime number {{mvar|p}} it must divide both non-leading coefficients {{math|15}} and {{math|10}}, which means only {{math|''p'' {{=}} 5}} could work, and indeed it does since {{math|5}} does not divide the leading coefficient {{math|3}}, and its square {{math|25}} does not divide the constant coefficient {{math|10}}. One may therefore conclude that {{mvar|Q}} is irreducible over {{math|'''Q'''}} (and since it is primitive, over {{math|'''Z'''}} as well). Note that since {{mvar|Q}} is of degree 4, this conclusion could not have been established by only checking that {{mvar|Q}} has no rational roots (which eliminates possible factors of degree 1), since a decomposition into two quadratic factors could also be possible.\n\n===Indirect (after transformation)===\n\nOften Eisenstein's criterion does not apply for any prime number. It may however be that it applies (for some prime number) to the polynomial obtained after substitution (for some integer {{mvar|a}}) of {{math|''x'' + ''a''}} for {{mvar|x}}. The fact that the polynomial after substitution is irreducible then allows concluding that the original polynomial is as well. This procedure is known as applying a ''shift''.\n\nFor example consider {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''x'' + 2}}, in which the coefficient 1 of {{mvar|x}} is not divisible by any prime, Eisenstein's criterion does not apply to {{mvar|H}}. But if one substitutes {{math|''x'' + 3}} for {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|H}}, one obtains the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 7''x'' + 14}}, which satisfies Eisenstein's criterion for the prime number {{math|7}}. Since the substitution is an [[automorphism]] of the ring {{math|'''Q'''[''x'']}}, the fact that we obtain an irreducible polynomial after substitution implies that we had an irreducible polynomial originally. In this particular example it would have been simpler to argue that {{mvar|H}} (being monic of degree 2) could only be reducible if it had an integer root, which it obviously does not; however the general principle of trying substitutions in order to make Eisenstein's criterion apply is a useful way to broaden its scope.\n\nAnother possibility to transform a polynomial so as to satisfy the criterion, which may be combined with applying a shift, is reversing the order of its coefficients, provided its constant term is nonzero (without which it would be divisible by {{mvar|x}} anyway). This is so because such polynomials are reducible in {{math|''R''[''x'']}} if and only if they are reducible in {{math|''R''[''x'', ''x''<sup>−1</sup>]}} (for any integral domain {{math|''R''}}), and in that ring the substitution of {{math|''x''<sup>−1</sup>}} for {{mvar|x}} reverses the order of the coefficients (in a manner symmetric about the constant coefficient, but a following shift in the exponent amounts to multiplication by a unit). As an example {{math|2''x''<sup>5</sup> − 4''x''<sup>2</sup> − 3}} satisfies the criterion for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} after reversing its coefficients, and (being primitive) is therefore irreducible in {{math|'''Z'''[''x'']}}.\n\n=== Cyclotomic polynomials ===\n\nAn important class of polynomials whose irreducibility can be established using Eisenstein's criterion is that of the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s for prime numbers {{mvar|p}}. Such a polynomial is obtained by dividing the polynomial {{math|''x<sup>p</sup>'' − 1}} by the linear factor {{math|''x'' − 1}}, corresponding to its obvious root {{math|1}} (which is its only rational root if {{math|''p'' > 2}}):\n\n:<math>\\frac{x^p - 1}{x - 1} = x^{p - 1} + x^{p - 2} + \\cdots + x + 1.</math>\n\nHere, as in the earlier example of {{mvar|H}}, the coefficients {{math|1}} prevent Eisenstein's criterion from applying directly. However the polynomial will satisfy the criterion for {{mvar|p}} after substitution of {{math|''x'' + 1}} for {{mvar|x}}: this gives\n\n:<math>\\frac{(x+1)^p - 1}{x} = x^{p - 1} + \\binom{p}{p-1}x^{p - 2} + \\cdots + \\binom{p}2 x + \\binom{p}1,</math>\n\nall of whose non-leading coefficients are divisible by {{mvar|p}} by properties of [[binomial coefficient]]s, and whose constant coefficient is equal to {{mvar|p}}, and therefore not divisible by {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}}. An alternative way to arrive at this conclusion is to use the identity {{math|(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> {{=}} ''a<sup>p</sup>'' + ''b<sup>p</sup>''}} which is valid in [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] {{mvar|p}} (and which is based on the same properties of binomial coefficients, and gives rise to the [[Frobenius endomorphism]]), to compute the reduction modulo {{mvar|p}} of the quotient of polynomials:\n\n:<math>\\frac{(x+1)^p - 1}{x} \\equiv \\frac{x^p +1^p-1}{x} = \\frac{x^p}{x} = x^{p-1}\\pmod p,</math>\n\nwhich means that the non-leading coefficients of the quotient are all divisible by {{mvar|p}}; the remaining verification that the constant term of the quotient is {{mvar|p}} can be done by substituting {{math|1}} (instead of {{math|''x'' + 1}}) for {{mvar|x}} into the expanded form {{math|''x''<sup>''p''−1</sup> + ... + ''x'' + 1}}.\n\n==History==\n\nTheodor Schönemann was the first to publish a version of the criterion,<ref name=\"Cox\">{{harvnb|Cox|2011}}.</ref> in 1846 in [[Crelle's Journal]],<ref>{{harvp|Schönemann|1846|p=100}}.</ref> which reads in translation\n\n<blockquote>That {{math|(''x'' − ''a'')<sup>''n''</sup> + ''pF''(''x'')}} will be irreducible to the modulus {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}} when {{math|''F''(''x'')}} to the modulus {{math|''p''}} does not contain a factor {{math|''x''−''a''}}.</blockquote>\n\nThis formulation already incorporates a shift to {{mvar|a}} in place of {{math|0}}; the condition on {{math|''F''(''x'')}} means that {{math|''F''(''a'')}} is not divisible by {{mvar|p}}, and so {{math|''pF''(''a'')}} is divisible by {{mvar|p}} but not by {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}}. As stated it is not entirely correct in that it makes no assumptions on the degree of the polynomial {{math|''F''(''x'')}}, so that the polynomial considered need not be of the degree {{mvar|n}} that its expression suggests; the example {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''p''(''x''<sup>3</sup> + 1) ≡ (''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''p'')(''px'' + 1) mod ''p''<sup>2</sup>}}, shows the conclusion is not valid without such hypothesis. Assuming that the degree of {{math|''F''(''x'')}} does not exceed {{mvar|n}}, the criterion is correct however, and somewhat stronger than the formulation given above, since if {{math|(''x'' − ''a'')<sup>''n''</sup> + ''pF''(''x'')}} is irreducible modulo&nbsp;{{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}}, it certainly cannot decompose in {{math|'''Z'''[''x'']}} into non-constant factors.\n\nSubsequently Eisenstein published a somewhat different version in 1850, also in Crelle's Journal.<ref>{{harvp|Eisenstein|1850|p=166}}.</ref> This version reads in translation\n\n<blockquote>When in a polynomial {{math|''F''(''x'')}} in {{mvar|x}} of arbitrary degree the coefficient of the highest term is {{math|1}}, and all following coefficients are whole (real, complex) numbers, into which a certain (real resp. complex) prime number {{mvar|m}} divides, and when furthermore the last coefficient is equal to {{math|''εm''}}, where {{math|''ε''}} denotes a number not divisible by {{mvar|m}}: then it is impossible to bring {{math|''F''(''x'')}} into the form\n\n:<math>\\left (x^{\\mu} + a_1 x^{\\mu-1} + \\cdots + a_{\\mu} \\right) \\left (x^{\\nu} + b_1 x^{\\nu-1} + \\cdots + b_{\\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''μ'', ''ν'' ≥ 1}}, {{math|''μ'' + ''ν'' {{=}} deg(''F''(''x''))}}, and all {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are ''whole'' (real resp. complex) numbers; the equation {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} is therefore irreducible.</blockquote>\n\nHere \"whole real numbers\" are ordinary [[integer]]s and \"whole complex numbers\" are [[Gaussian integer]]s; one should similarly interpret \"real and complex prime numbers\". The application for which Eisenstein developed his criterion was establishing the irreducibility of certain polynomials with coefficients in the Gaussian integers that arise in the study of the division of the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]] into pieces of equal arc-length.\n\nRemarkably Schönemann and Eisenstein, once having formulated their respective criteria for irreducibility, both immediately apply it to give an elementary proof of the irreducibility of the cyclotomic polynomials for prime numbers, a result that Gauss had obtained in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' with a much more complicated proof. In fact, Eisenstein adds in a footnote that the only proof for this irreducibility known to him, other than that of Gauss, is one given by [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] in 1845. This shows that he was unaware of the two different proofs of this statement that Schönemann had given in his 1846 article, where the second proof was based on the above-mentioned criterion. This is all the more surprising given the fact that two pages further, Eisenstein actually refers (for a different matter) to the first part of Schönemann's article. In a note (\"Notiz\") that appeared in the following issue of the Journal,<ref>{{harvp|Schönemann|1850|p=188}}.</ref> Schönemann points this out to Eisenstein, and indicates that the latter's method is not essentially different from the one he used in the second proof.\n\n==Basic proof==\n\nTo prove the validity of the criterion, suppose {{mvar|Q}} satisfies the criterion for the prime number {{mvar|p}}, but that it is nevertheless reducible in {{math|'''Q'''[''x'']}}, from which we wish to obtain a contradiction. From [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss' lemma]] it follows that {{mvar|Q}} is reducible in {{math|'''Z'''[''x'']}} as well, and in fact can be written as the product {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''GH''}} of two non-constant polynomials {{math|''G'', ''H''}} (in case {{mvar|Q}} is not primitive, one applies the lemma to the primitive polynomial {{math|''Q''/''c''}} (where the integer {{mvar|c}} is the content of {{mvar|Q}}) to obtain a decomposition for it, and multiplies {{mvar|c}} into one of the factors to obtain a decomposition for {{mvar|Q}}). Now reduce {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''GH''}} modulo {{mvar|p}} to obtain a decomposition in {{math|('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')[''x'']}}. But by hypothesis this reduction for {{mvar|Q}} leaves its leading term, of the form {{math|''ax<sup>n</sup>''}} for a non-zero constant {{math|''a'' ∈ '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}}, as the only nonzero term. But then necessarily the reductions modulo {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} also make all non-leading terms vanish (and cannot make their leading terms vanish), since no other decompositions of {{math|''ax<sup>n</sup>''}} are possible in {{math|('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')[''x'']}}, which is a [[unique factorization domain]]. In particular the constant terms of {{math|''G''}} and {{mvar|H}} vanish in the reduction, so they are divisible by {{mvar|p}}, but then the constant term of {{mvar|Q}}, which is their product, is divisible by {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}}, contrary to the hypothesis, and one has a contradiction.\n\nA second proof of Eisenstein's criterion also starts with the assumption that the polynomial {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} is reducible. It is shown that this assumption entails a contradiction.\n\nThe assumption that \n\n: <math>Q(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1x+a_0</math>\n\nis reducible means that there are polynomials \n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \nG(x) &= c_r x^r + c_{r-1} x^{r-1} + \\cdots + c_0 && r \\ge 1 \\\\\nH(x) &= d_s x^s + d_{s-1} x^{s-1} + \\cdots + d_0 && s \\ge 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSuch that\n\n:<math>Q(x)=G(x)\\cdot H(x), \\qquad n = r+s.</math>\n\nThe coefficient {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>}} of the polynomial {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} can be divided by the prime {{mvar|p}} but not by {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}}. Since {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''c''<sub>0</sub>''d''<sub>0</sub>}}, it is possible to divide {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} or {{math|''d''<sub>0</sub>}} by {{mvar|p}}, but not both. One may without loss of generality proceed \n\n*with a coefficient {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} that can be divided by {{mvar|p}} and \n\n*with a coefficient {{math|''d''<sub>0</sub>}} that cannot be divided by {{mvar|p}}.\n\nBy the assumption, <math>p</math> does not divide <math>a_n</math>. Because of {{math|''a<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} ''c<sub>r</sub> d<sub>s</sub>''}}, none of {{math|''c<sub>r</sub>''}} or {{math|''d<sub>s</sub>''}} can be divided by {{mvar|p}}. Thus, if <math>a_r</math> is the <math>r</math>-th coefficient of the reducible polynomial <math>Q</math>, then (possibly with <math>d_t = 0</math> in case <math>t>s</math>)\n\n:<math>a_r=c_r d_0 + c_{r-1}d_1 + \\cdots + c_0 d_r</math>\n\nwherein <math>c_r d_0</math> cannot be divided by <math>p</math>, because neither <math>d_0</math> nor <math>c_r</math> can be divided by <math>p</math>.\n\nWe will prove that <math>c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_{r-1}</math> are all divisible by {{mvar|p}}. As <math>a_r</math> is also divisible by {{mvar|p}} (by hypothesis of the criterion), this implies that \n\n:<math>c_r d_0 = a_r- \\left (c_{r-1}d_1 + \\cdots + c_0 d_r \\right )</math> \n\nis divisible by {{mvar|p}}, a contradiction proving the criterion.\n\nIt is possible to divide <math>c_0 d_r</math> by <math>p</math>, because <math>c_0</math> can be divided by <math>p</math>.\n\nBy initial assumption, it is possible to divide the coefficient {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>}} of the polynomial {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} by {{mvar|p}}. Since\n\n:<math>a_1=c_0 d_1 + c_1 d_0</math>\n\nand since {{math|''d''<sub>0</sub>}} is not a multiple of {{mvar|p}} it must be possible to divide {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} by {{mvar|p}}. Analogously, by induction, <math>c_i</math> is a multiple of <math>p</math> for all <math>i<r</math>, which finishes the proof.\n\n==Advanced explanation==\n\nApplying the theory of the [[Newton polygon]] for the [[p-adic number|{{mvar|p}}-adic number]] field, for an Eisenstein polynomial, we are supposed to take the [[lower convex envelope]] of the points\n\n:{{math|(0, 1), (1, ''v''<sub>1</sub>), (2, ''v''<sub>2</sub>), ..., (''n'' − 1, ''v''<sub>''n''−1</sub>), (''n'', 0)}},\n\nwhere {{math|''v<sub>i</sub>''}} is the [[additive p-adic valuation|{{mvar|p}}-adic valuation]] of {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}} (i.e. the highest power of {{mvar|p}} dividing it). Now the data we are given on the {{math|''v<sub>i</sub>''}} for {{math|0 < ''i'' < ''n''}}, namely that they are at least one, is just what we need to conclude that the lower convex envelope is exactly the single line segment from {{math|(0, 1)}} to {{math|(''n'', 0)}}, the [[slope]] being {{math|−1/''n''}}.\n\nThis tells us that each root of {{mvar|Q}} has {{mvar|p}}-adic valuation {{math|1/''n''}} and hence that {{mvar|Q}} is irreducible over the {{mvar|p}}-adic field (since, for instance, no product of any proper subset of the roots has integer valuation); and ''a fortiori'' over the rational number field.\n\nThis argument is much more complicated than the direct argument by reduction mod {{mvar|p}}. It does however allow one to see, in terms of [[algebraic number theory]], how frequently Eisenstein's criterion might apply, after some change of variable; and so limit severely the possible choices of {{mvar|p}} with respect to which the polynomial could have an Eisenstein translate (that is, become Eisenstein after an additive change of variables as in the case of the {{mvar|p}}-th cyclotomic polynomial).\n\nIn fact only primes {{mvar|p}} [[Ramification (mathematics)|ramifying]] in the extension of {{math|'''Q'''}} generated by a root of {{mvar|Q}} have any chance of working. These can be found in terms of the [[discriminant of a polynomial|discriminant]] of {{mvar|Q}}. For example, in the case {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''x'' + 2}} given above, the discriminant is {{math|−7}} so that {{math|7}} is the only prime that has a chance of making it satisfy the criterion. Modulo {{math|7}}, it becomes {{math|(''x'' − 3)<sup>2</sup>}}&mdash; a repeated root is inevitable, since the discriminant is {{math|0 mod 7}}. Therefore the variable shift is actually something predictable.\n\nAgain, for the cyclotomic polynomial, it becomes\n\n:{{math|(''x'' − 1)<sup>''p''−1</sup> mod ''p''}};\n\nthe discriminant can be shown to be (up to sign) {{math|''p''<sup>''p''−2</sup>}}, by [[linear algebra]] methods.\n\nMore precisely, only totally ramified primes have a chance of being Eisenstein primes for the polynomial.  (In quadratic fields, ramification is always total, so the distinction is not seen in the quadratic case like {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''x'' + 2}} above.) In fact, Eisenstein polynomials are directly linked to totally ramified primes, as follows: if a field extension of the rationals is generated by the root of a polynomial that is Eisenstein at {{mvar|p}} then {{mvar|p}} is totally ramified in the extension, and conversely if {{mvar|p}} is totally ramified in a number field then the field is generated by the root of an Eisenstein polynomial at {{mvar|p}}.\n\n==Generalization==\n\n===Generalized criterion===\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{mvar|D}}, let\n\n:<math>Q=\\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</math>\n\nbe an element of {{math|''D''[''x'']}}, the [[polynomial ring]] with coefficients in {{mvar|D}}.\n\nSuppose there exists a [[prime ideal]] {{math|'''p'''}} of {{mvar|D}} such that\n\n* {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>'' ∈ '''p'''}} for each {{math|''i'' ≠ ''n''}},\n* {{math|''a<sub>n</sub>'' ∉ '''p'''}}, and\n* {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub> ∉ '''p'''<sup>2</sup>}}, where {{math|'''p'''<sup>2</sup>}} is the [[Ring ideal#Ideal operations|ideal product]] of {{math|'''p'''}} with itself.\n\nThen {{mvar|Q}} cannot be written as a product of two non-constant polynomials in {{math|''D''[''x'']}}. If in addition {{mvar|Q}} is [[Primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive]] (i.e., it has no non-trivial ''constant'' divisors), then it is irreducible in {{math|''D''[''x'']}}. If {{mvar|D}} is a [[unique factorization domain]] with [[field of fractions]] {{mvar|F}}, then by [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]] {{mvar|Q}} is irreducible in {{math|''F''[''x'']}}, whether or not it is primitive (since constant factors are invertible in {{math|''F''[''x'']}}); in this case a possible choice of prime ideal is the principal ideal generated by any irreducible element of {{mvar|D}}. The latter statement gives  original theorem for {{math|''D'' {{=}} '''Z'''}} or (in Eisenstein's formulation) for {{math|''D'' {{=}} '''Z'''[''i'']}}.\n\n===Proof===\n\nThe proof of this generalization is similar to the one for the original statement, considering the reduction of the coefficients modulo {{math|'''p'''}}; the essential point is that a single-term polynomial over the integral domain {{math|''D''/'''p'''}} cannot decompose as a product in which at least one of the factors has more than one term (because in such a product there can be no cancellation in the coefficient either of the highest or the lowest possible degree).\n\n===Example===\n\nAfter {{math|'''Z'''}}, one of the basic examples of an integral domain is the polynomial ring {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''k''[''u'']}} in the variable {{mvar|u}} over the field {{mvar|k}}. In this case, the principal ideal generated by {{mvar|u}} is a prime ideal. Eisenstein's criterion can then be used to prove the irreducibility of a polynomial such as {{math|''Q''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ux'' + ''u''}} in {{math|''D''[''x'']}}.

      "text": "{{otheruses4|polynomials in variables and exponential functions|the polynomials involving Stirling numbers|Touchard polynomials}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''exponential polynomials''' are functions on [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], or [[abelian group]]s that take the form of [[polynomial]]s in a variable and an [[exponential function]].\n\n==Definition==\n===In fields===\n\nAn exponential polynomial generally has both a variable ''x'' and some kind of exponential function ''E''(''x'').  In the complex numbers there is already a canonical exponential function, the function that maps ''x'' to ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''<sup>''x''</sup>.  In this setting the term exponential polynomial is often used to mean polynomials of the form ''P''(''x'',''e''<sup>''x''</sup>) where ''P''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;'''C'''[''x'',''y''] is a polynomial in two variables.<ref>C. J. Moreno, ''The zeros of exponential polynomials'', Compositio Mathematica 26 (1973), pp.69&ndash;78.</ref><ref>M. Waldschmidt, ''Diophantine approximation on linear algebraic groups'', [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2000.</ref>\n\nThere is nothing particularly special about '''C''' here, exponential polynomials may also refer to such a polynomial on any [[exponential field]] or exponential ring with its exponential function taking the place of ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> above.<ref>Martin Bays, Jonathan Kirby, A.J. Wilkie, ''A Schanuel property for exponentially transcendental powers'', (2008), [https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4457v1 arXiv:0810.4457v1]</ref>  Similarly, there is no reason to have one variable, and an exponential polynomial in ''n'' variables would be of the form ''P''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>,''e''<sup>''x''<sub>1</sub></sup>,...,''e''<sup>''x''<sub>''n''</sub></sup>), where ''P'' is a polynomial in 2''n'' variables.\n\nFor formal exponential polynomials over a field ''K'' we proceed as follows.<ref name=EPSW140>{{cite book | last1=Everest | first1=Graham | last2=van der Poorten | first2=Alf | author2-link=Alfred van der Poorten | last3=Shparlinski | first3=Igor | last4=Ward | first4=Thomas | title=Recurrence sequences | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | volume=104 | location=[[Providence, RI]] | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-8218-3387-1 | zbl=1033.11006 | page=140 }}</ref>  Let ''W'' be a finitely generated '''Z'''-submodule of ''K'' and consider finite sums of the form \n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i(X) \\exp(w_i X) \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> are polynomials in ''K''[''X''] and the exp(''w''<sub>''i''</sub>''X'') are formal symbols indexed by ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''W'' subject to exp(''u''+''v'') = exp(''u'')exp(''v'').\n\n===In abelian groups===\n\nA more general framework where the term exponential polynomial may be found is that of exponential functions on abelian groups.  Similarly to how exponential functions on exponential fields are defined, given a [[topological abelian group]] ''G'' a [[homomorphism]] from ''G'' to the additive group of the complex numbers is called an additive function, and a homomorphism to the multiplicative group of nonzero complex numbers is called an exponential function, or simply an exponential.  A product of additive functions and exponentials is called an exponential monomial, and a linear combination of these is then an exponential polynomial on ''G''.<ref>László Székelyhidi, ''On the extension of exponential polynomials'', Mathematica Bohemica '''125''' (2000), pp.365&ndash;370.</ref><ref>P. G. Laird, ''On characterizations of exponential polynomials'', Pacific Journal of Mathematics '''80''' (1979), pp.503&ndash;507.</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n'''Ritt's theorem''' states that the analogues of [[unique factorization]] and the [[factor theorem]] hold for the ring of exponential polynomials<ref name=EPSW140/>\n\n==Applications==\n\nExponential polynomials on '''R''' and '''C''' often appear in [[transcendental number theory]], where they appear as [[auxiliary function]]s in proofs involving the exponential function.  They also act as a link between [[model theory]] and [[analytic geometry]].  If one defines an exponential variety to be the set of points in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> where some finite collection of exponential polynomials vanish, then results like Khovanskiǐ's theorem in [[differential geometry]] and [[Wilkie's theorem]] in model theory show that these varieties are well-behaved in the sense that the collection of such varieties is stable under the various set-theoretic operations as long as one allows the inclusion of the image under projections of higher-dimensional exponential varieties.  Indeed, the two aforementioned theorems imply that the set of all exponential varieties forms an [[o-minimal structure]] over '''R'''.\n\nExponential polynomials appear in the characteristic equation associated with linear [[Delay differential equation#The_characteristic_equation|delay differential equations]].\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Polynomials]]"
