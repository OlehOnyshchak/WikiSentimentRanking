      "text": "{{Semireg dual polyhedra db|Semireg dual polyhedron stat table|dSD}}\nIn [[geometry]], a '''pentagonal hexecontahedron''' is a [[Catalan solid]], dual of the [[snub dodecahedron]]. It has two distinct forms, which are [[mirror image]]s (or \"[[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorph]]s\") of each other. It has 92 vertices that span 60 pentagonal faces. It is the Catalan solid with the most vertices. Among the Catalan and [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] solids, it has the second largest number of vertices, after the [[truncated icosidodecahedron]], which has 120 vertices.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe pentagonal hexecontahedron can be constructed from a snub dodecahedron without taking the dual. Pentagonal pyramids are added to the 12 pentagonal faces of the snub dodecahedron, and triangular pyramids are added to the 20 triangular faces that do not share an edge with a pentagon. The pyramid heights are adjusted to make them coplanar with the other 60 triangular faces of the snub dodecahedron. The result is the pentagonal hexecontahedron.<ref>[http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.math/2008-07/msg02675.html Reference]</ref>\n\n==Geometry==\nThe faces are irregular [[pentagon]]s with two long edges and three short edges. The ratio of edge lengths is about 1:1.7498525667362. The faces have four obtuse angles of about 118.13662 degrees each, and one acute angle (between the two long edges) of about 67.45351 degrees. The dihedral angle is about 153.178732558 degrees between all faces.\n\nNote that the face centers of the [[snub dodecahedron]] cannot serve directly as vertices of the pentagonal hexecontahedron: the four triangle centers lie in one plane but the pentagon center does not; it needs to be radially pushed out to make it coplanar with the triangle centers. Consequently, the vertices of the pentagonal hexecontahedron do not all lie on the same sphere and by definition it is not a [[zonohedron]].\n\n=== Variations===\n[[Isohedral figure|Isohedral]] variations can be constructed with pentagonal faces with 3 edge lengths.\n\nThis variation shown can be constructed by adding pyramids to 12 pentagonal faces and 20 triangular faces of a [[snub dodecahedron]] such that the new triangular faces are coparallel to other triangles and can be merged into the pentagon faces.\n{| class=wikitable width=480\n|- align=center valign=top\n|[[File:Pentagonal_hexecontahedron_variation0.png|160px]]<BR>[[Snub dodecahedron]] with augmented pyramids and merged faces\n|[[File:Pentagonal_hexecontahedron_variation.png|160px]]<BR>Example variation\n|[[File:Pentagonal_hexecontahedron_variation_net.png|160px]]<BR>Net\n|}\n\n==Orthogonal projections==\nThe ''pentagonal hexecontahedron'' has three symmetry positions, two on vertices, and one mid-edge.\n{|class=wikitable width=500\n|+ Orthogonal projections\n|- align=center\n!Projective<BR>symmetry\n|[3]\n|[5]<sup>+</sup>\n|[2]\n|-\n!Image\n|[[Image:Dual snub dodecahedron A2.png|120px]]\n|[[Image:Dual snub dodecahedron H2.png|120px]]\n|[[Image:Dual snub dodecahedron e1.png|120px]]\n|-\n!Dual<BR>image\n|[[Image:Snub dodecahedron A2.png|120px]]\n|[[Image:Snub dodecahedron H2.png|120px]]\n|[[Image:Snub dodecahedron e1.png|120px]]\n|}\n\n==Related polyhedra and tilings==\n[[File:Spherical pentagonal hexecontahedron.png|160px|thumb|Spherical pentagonal hexecontahedron]]\n{{Icosahedral truncations}}\n\nThis polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of polyhedra and tilings of pentagons with [[face configuration]]s (V3.3.3.3.''n'').

The result is the pentagonal icositetrahedron.\n\n== Geometry==\nDenote the [[tribonacci constant]] by ''t'', approximately 1.8393. (See [[snub cube]] for a geometric explanation of the tribonacci constant.)

This interpretation is expressed in its name.<ref>Conway, Symmetries of things, p.284</ref> \nThere are in fact several topologically equivalent but geometrically distinct kinds of pentakis dodecahedron, depending on the height of the pentagonal pyramids.  These include:\n\n* The usual Catalan pentakis dodecahedron, a convex  [[hexecontahedron]] with sixty isosceles triangular faces illustrated in the sidebar figure.  It is a [[Catalan solid]], dual to the [[truncated icosahedron]], an [[Archimedean solid]]. The critical height of each of the pyramids above the faces of the original unit dodecahedron is\n::<math>h = \\frac{\\sqrt{65 + 22\\sqrt{5}}}{19\\sqrt{5}} \\approx 0.2515</math>\n:At this size, the dihedral angle between all neighbouring triangular faces is equal to the value in the table above. Flatter pyramids have higher intra-pyramid dihedrals and taller pyramids have higher inter-pyramid dihedrals.\n\n* As the heights of the pentagonal pyramids are raised, at a certain point adjoining pairs of triangular faces merge to become rhombi, and the shape becomes a [[rhombic triacontahedron]].\n\n* As the height is raised further, the shape becomes non-convex. In particular, an equilateral or [[deltahedron]] version of the pentakis dodecahedron, which has sixty equilateral triangular faces as shown in the adjoining figure, is slightly non-convex due to its taller pyramids (note, for example, the negative dihedral angle at the upper left of the figure).\n\n:[[File:Pyramid_augmented_dodecahedron.png|160px|A non-convex variant with equilateral triangular faces.]]\n\nOther more non-convex geometric variants include: \n* [[File:Small stellated dodecahedron.png|50px]] The [[small stellated dodecahedron]] (with very tall pyramids).\n* [[File:DU58 great pentakisdodecahedron.png|50px]] [[Great pentakis dodecahedron]] (with extremely tall pyramids)\n* [[File:Third stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]] Wenninger's [[third stellation of icosahedron]] (with inverted pyramids).\n\nIf one affixes [[pentagrammic pyramid]]s into an [[excavated dodecahedron]] one obtains the [[great icosahedron]].\n\nIf one keeps the center [[Regular dodecahedron|dodecahedron]], one get the net of a [[Dodecahedral pyramid]].\n\n==Chemistry==\n[[Image:C60-cpk.png|200px]]<br>The ''pentakis dodecahedron'' in a model of [[buckminsterfullerene]]: each surface segment represents a [[carbon]] [[atom]].

These have 60 symmetry related capsid proteins, which combine to make the 60 symmetrical faces of a ''pentakis dodecahedron''.\n \n==Orthogonal projections==\nThe pentakis dodecahedron has three symmetry positions, two on vertices, and one on a midedge:\n{|class=wikitable\n|+ Orthogonal projections\n|- align=center\n!Projective<br>symmetry\n|[2]\n|[6]\n|[10]\n|-\n!Image\n|[[File:Dual dodecahedron t01 e66.png|120px]]\n|[[File:Dual dodecahedron t01 A2.png|120px]]\n|[[File:Dual dodecahedron t01 H3.png|120px]]\n|-\n!Dual<BR>image\n|[[File:Dodecahedron t12 e66.png|120px]]\n|[[File:Icosahedron t01 A2.png|120px]]\n|[[File:Icosahedron t01 H3.png|120px]]\n|}\n\n== Related polyhedra==\n[[File:Spherical_pentakis_dodecahedron.png|160px|thumb|Spherical pentakis dodecahedron]]\n{{Icosahedral truncations}}\n\n{{Truncated figure2 table}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n*The [[Spaceship Earth (Disney)|Spaceship Earth]] structure at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] is a derivative of a pentakis dodecahedron.\n*The model for a campus arts workshop designed by Jeffrey Lindsay was actually a hemispherical pentakis dodecahedron https://books.google.com/books?id=JD8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92&dq=jeffrey+lindsay&hl=en&ei=oF88Tv25F7OisQLGwbwt&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=jeffrey%20lindsay&f=false\n*The shape of the \"Crystal Dome\" used in the popular TV game show ''[[The Crystal Maze]]'' was based on a pentakis dodecahedron.\n*In [[Doctor Atomic]], the shape of the first atomic bomb detonated in [[New Mexico]] was a pentakis dodecahedron.[https://www.scribd.com/doc/7817182/Doctor-Atomic-Libretto]\n*In [[De Blob 2]] in the Prison Zoo, domes are made up of parts of a Pentakis Dodecahedron.

It has 24 [[edge (geometry)|edges]], and 14 [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of two types. It is a [[Catalan solid]], and the [[dual polyhedron]] of the [[cuboctahedron]].\n\n==Properties==\nThe rhombic dodecahedron is a [[zonohedron]]. Its polyhedral [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] is the [[cuboctahedron]]. The long diagonal of each face is exactly [[Square root of two|{{sqrt|2}}]] times the length of the short diagonal, so that the [[Angle#Types of angles|acute]] angles on each face measure arccos({{sfrac|1|3}}), or approximately 70.53°.\n\nBeing the dual of an [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean polyhedron]], the rhombic dodecahedron is [[face-transitive]], meaning the [[symmetry group]] of the solid acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on the set of faces. In elementary terms, this means that for any two faces A and B there is a [[rotation]] or [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of the solid that leaves it occupying the same region of space while moving face A to face B.\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron is one of the nine [[edge-transitive]] convex polyhedra, the others being the five [[Platonic solid]]s, the [[cuboctahedron]], the [[icosidodecahedron]] and the [[rhombic triacontahedron]].\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron can be used to [[Tessellation|tessellate]] three-dimensional space. It can be stacked to fill a space much like [[hexagon]]s fill a plane.\n\nThis [[Rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb|polyhedron in a space-filling tessellation]] can be seen as the [[Voronoi tessellation]] of the [[Crystal structure|face-centered cubic lattice]]. It is the Brillouin zone of body centered cubic (bcc) crystals. Some minerals such as [[garnet]] form a rhombic dodecahedral [[crystal habit]]. [[Honey bee]]s use the geometry of rhombic dodecahedra to form [[honeycomb]]s from a tessellation of cells each of which is a [[hexagonal prism]] capped with half a rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron also appears in the unit cells of [[diamond]] and [[diamondoid]]s. In these cases, four vertices (alternate threefold ones) are absent, but the chemical bonds lie on the remaining edges.<ref name=cryst1>[http://www.khulsey.com/jewelry/crystal_habit.html#h-5.

It can be seen as a rhombic dodecahedron with each face augmented by attaching a rhombic-based pyramid to it, with a pyramid height such that the sides lie in the face planes of the neighbouring faces:\n<gallery widths=\"240px\" heights=\"200px\">\nThree flattened octahedra compound.png|The first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron\nfirst_rhombic_dodecahedron_stellation.stl|3D model of decomposition into 12 pyramids and 4 half-cubes\n</gallery>\nLuke describes four more stellations: the second and third stellations (expanding outwards), one formed by removing the second from the third, and another by adding the original rhombic dodecahedron back to the previous one.\n\n[[Great rhombic dodecahedron]] : 12 concave octagonal faces\n\n[[Great stellated rhombic dodecahedron]] : 12 concave dodecagonal faces\n\n==Related polytopes==\n[[Image:Hypercubeorder.svg|thumb|In a perfect vertex-first projection two of the [[tesseract]]'s vertices (marked in pale green) are projected exactly in the center of the rhombic dodecahedron]]\nThe rhombic dodecahedron forms the hull of the vertex-first projection of a [[tesseract]] to three dimensions. There are exactly two ways of decomposing a rhombic dodecahedron into four congruent [[rhombohedra]], giving eight possible rhombohedra as projections of the tesseracts 8 cubic cells. One set of projective vectors are: ''u''=(1,1,-1,-1), ''v''=(-1,1,-1,1), ''w''=(1,-1,-1,1).\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron forms the maximal cross-section of a [[24-cell]], and also forms the hull of its vertex-first parallel projection into three dimensions. The rhombic dodecahedron can be decomposed into six congruent (but non-regular) [[square dipyramid]]s meeting at a single vertex in the center; these form the images of six pairs of the 24-cell's octahedral cells. The remaining 12 octahedral cells project onto the faces of the rhombic dodecahedron. The non-regularity of these images are due to projective distortion; the facets of the 24-cell are regular octahedra in 4-space.\n\nThis decomposition gives an interesting method for constructing the rhombic dodecahedron: cut a [[cube]] into six congruent square pyramids, and attach them to the faces of a second cube. The triangular faces of each pair of adjacent pyramids lie on the same plane, and so merge into rhombuses. The 24-cell may also be constructed in an analogous way using two [[tesseract]]s.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ7uOj2LRso</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dodecahedron]]\n*[[Rhombic triacontahedron]]\n*[[Truncated rhombic dodecahedron]]\n*[[24-cell]] – 4D analog of rhombic dodecahedron\n*[[Archimede construction systems]]\n* [[:Image:StellaTruncRhombicDodeca.png| Fully truncated rhombic dodecahedron]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{The Geometrical Foundation of Natural Structure (book)}} (Section 3-9)\n*{{cite book |last1=Wenninger |first1=Magnus |author1-link=Magnus Wenninger |title=Dual Models |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfmzUjhs-_8C&pg=PA19 |isbn=978-0-521-54325-5 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511569371 |mr=730208 |year=1983}} (The thirteen semiregular convex polyhedra and their duals, Page 19, Rhombic dodecahedron)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=EtQCk0TNafsC&pg=PA345 ''The Symmetries of Things''] 2008, John H.

It has 60 [[edge (geometry)|edges]] and 32 [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of two types. It is a [[Catalan solid]], and the [[dual polyhedron]] of the [[icosidodecahedron]]. It is a [[zonohedron]].\n\n{|style=\"float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .5em 0 0 .2em;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 88%;\"\n|valign=\"top\" |[[File:GoldenRhombus.svg|240px]]<br/> A face of the rhombic triacontahedron. The lengths<br/> of the diagonals are in the [[golden ratio]].\n|}\n[[File:Cube-R30.gif|thumb|This animation shows a transformation from a [[cube]] to a rhombic triacontahedron by dividing the square faces into 4 squares and splitting middle edges into new rhombic faces.]]\nThe ratio of the long diagonal to the short diagonal of each face is exactly equal to the [[golden ratio]], ''φ'', so that the [[Angle#Types of angles|acute angles]] on each face measure {{nowrap|2 tan<sup>−1</sup>({{sfrac|1|''φ''}}) {{=}} tan<sup>−1</sup>(2)}}, or approximately 63.43°. A rhombus so obtained is called a ''[[golden rhombus]]''.\n\nBeing the dual of an [[Archimedean solid]], the rhombic triacontahedron is ''[[face-transitive]]'', meaning the [[symmetry group]] of the solid acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on the set of faces. This means that for any two faces, A and B, there is a [[rotation]] or [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of the solid that leaves it occupying the same region of space while moving face A to face B.\n\nThe rhombic triacontahedron is somewhat special in being one of the nine [[edge-transitive]] convex polyhedra, the others being the five [[Platonic solid]]s, the [[cuboctahedron]], the [[icosidodecahedron]], and the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].\n\nThe rhombic triacontahedron is also interesting in that its vertices include the arrangement of four Platonic solids. It contains ten [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], five [[cube]]s, an [[icosahedron]] and a [[dodecahedron]]. The centers of the faces contain five [[octahedron|octahedra]].\n\nIt can be made from a [[truncated octahedron]] by dividing the hexagonal faces into 3 rhombi:\n[[File:Rhombic triacontahedron in truncated octahedron.png|thumb|A topological rhombic triacontahedron in [[truncated octahedron]]]]\n\n==Dimensions==\nIf the edge length of a rhombic triacontahedron is ''a'', surface area, volume, the [[radius]] of an [[inscribed sphere]] ([[tangent]] to each of the rhombic triacontahedron's faces) and midradius, which touches the middle of each edge are:<ref>[[Stephen Wolfram]], \"[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rhombic+triacontahedron]\" from [[Wolfram Alpha]].

Consider the [[Riemannian symmetric space]] associated to the [[Group_(mathematics)|group]] [[Special_linear_group|''SL''<sub>4</sub>('''R''')]].

At a proper distance this can create the [[rhombicosidodecahedron]] by filling in square faces between the divided edges and triangle faces between the divided vertices. But for the snub form, pull the pentagonal faces out slightly less, only add the triangle faces and leave the other gaps empty (the other gaps are rectangles at this point). Then apply an equal rotation to the centers of the pentagons and triangles, continuing the rotation until the gaps can be filled by two equilateral triangles. (The fact that the proper amount to pull the faces out is less in the case of the snub dodecahedron can be seen in either of two ways: the [[circumradius]] of the snub dodecahedron is smaller than that of the icosidodecahedron; or, the edge length of the equilateral triangles formed by the divided vertices increases when the pentagonal faces are rotated.)\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right  | total_width = 350\n | image1 = Polyhedron great rhombi 12-20 subsolid snub left big.png\n | image2 = Polyhedron great rhombi 12-20 big.png\n | image3 = Polyhedron great rhombi 12-20 subsolid snub right big.png\n | footer = Uniform alternation of a truncated icosidodecahedron\n}}\nThe snub dodecahedron can also be derived from the [[truncated icosidodecahedron]] by the process of [[alternation (geometry)|alternation]].

They are the three-dimensional analogs of [[star polygon#Regular compounds|polygonal compound]]s such as the [[hexagram]].\n\nThe outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a [[convex polyhedron]] called the [[convex hull]]. The compound is a [[facetting]] of the convex hull.\n\nAnother convex polyhedron is formed by the small central space common to all members of the compound. This polyhedron can be used as the '''core''' for a set of [[stellation]]s.\n\n== Regular compounds ==\n\nA regular polyhedron compound can be defined as a compound which, like a regular polyhedron, is [[vertex-transitive]], [[edge-transitive]], and [[face-transitive]].

The vertices of the two tetrahedra define a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]] and the intersection of the two an [[octahedron]], which shares the same face-planes as the compound.  Thus it is a [[stellation]] of the octahedron, and in fact, the only finite stellation thereof.\n\nThe stella octangula can also be regarded as a [[#Dual-regular compounds|dual-regular compound]].\n\nThe [[compound of five tetrahedra]] comes in two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorph]]ic versions, which together make up the compound of 10 tetrahedra.  Each of the tetrahedral compounds is self-dual, and the compound of 5 cubes is dual to the compound of 5 octahedra.\n\nCoxeter's notation for regular compounds is given in the table above, incorporating [[Schläfli symbol]]s. The material inside the square brackets, [''d''{''p'',''q''}], denotes the components of the compound: ''d'' separate {''p'',''q''}'s. The material ''before'' the square brackets denotes the vertex arrangement of the compound: ''c''{''m'',''n''}[''d''{''p'',''q''}] is a compound of ''d'' {''p'',''q''}'s sharing the vertices of an {''m'',''n''} counted ''c'' times. The material ''after'' the square brackets denotes the facet arrangement of the compound: [''d''{''p'',''q''}]''e''{''s'',''t''} is a compound of ''d'' {''p'',''q''}'s sharing the faces of {''s'',''t''} counted ''e'' times. These may be combined: thus ''c''{''m'',''n''}[''d''{''p'',''q''}]''e''{''s'',''t''}  is a compound of ''d'' {''p'',''q''}'s sharing the vertices of {''m'',''n''} counted ''c'' times ''and'' the faces of {''s'',''t''} counted ''e'' times.

The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a [[convex polytope]] called the [[convex hull]]. The compound is a [[facetting]] of the convex hull.\n\nIn 5-polytope compounds constructed as dual pairs, the hypercells and vertices swap positions and cells and edges swap positions. Because of this the number of hypercells and vertices are equal, as are cells and edges. Mid-edges of the 5-cube cross mid-cell in the 16-cell, and vice versa.\n\nIt can be seen as the 5-dimensional analogue of a [[compound of cube and octahedron]].\n\n==Construction==\n\nThe 42 [[Cartesian coordinate]]s of the vertices of the compound are.\n: 10: (±2, 0, 0, 0, 0), ( 0, ±2, 0, 0, 0), ( 0, 0, ±2, 0, 0), ( 0, 0, 0, ±2, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, ±2)\n: 32: ( ±1, ±1, ±1, ±1, ±1)\n\nThe [[convex hull]] of the vertices makes the dual of [[rectified 5-orthoplex]].\n\nThe intersection of the 5-cube and 5-orthoplex compound is the uniform [[birectified 5-cube]]: {{CDD|node_1|split1|nodes|4a3b|nodes}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|4a3b|nodes_10l}} ∩ {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|4a3b|nodes_01l}}.\n\n==Images==\nThe compound can be seen in projection as the union of the two polytope graphs.

Hence, the \"neo filling\" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-[[density (polytope)|density]] regions are filled in). In addition, overlapping regions of coplanar faces can cancel each other out.<ref name=\"bowers\">http://polytope.net/hedrondude/polyhedra.htm</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"400\" style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:center\"\n|align=center|[[Image:UC60-5 cubohemioctahedra.png|150px]]<BR>Traditional filling\n|align=center|[[Image:5 cubohemioctahedra neo filling.png|150px]]<BR>\"Neo filling\"\n|}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|first=John|last=Skilling|title=Uniform Compounds of Uniform Polyhedra|journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=79|pages=447–457|year=1976|doi=10.1017/S0305004100052440|mr=0397554|issue=3}}.\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Polyhedral compounds]]\n\n\n{{polyhedron-stub}}"

A ''compound polytope'' is a figure that is composed of several polytopes sharing a common center. The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a [[convex polytope]] called the [[convex hull]]. The compound is a [[facetting]] of the convex hull.\n\nIn 4-polytope compounds constructed as dual pairs, cells and vertices swap positions and faces and edges swap positions. Because of this the number of cells and vertices are equal, as are faces and edges. Mid-edges of the tesseract cross mid-face in the 16-cell, and vice versa.\n\nIt can be seen as the 4-dimensional analogue of a [[compound of cube and octahedron]].\n\nThis is one of four compound polytopes which is obtained through combining a regular convex 4-polytope with its dual; the other three being the [[compound of two 5-cells]], [[compound of two 24-cells]] and [[compound of 120-cell and 600-cell]].\n\n==Construction==\n\nThe 24 [[Cartesian coordinate]]s of the vertices of the compound are:\n:  8: (±2, 0, 0, 0), ( 0, ±2, 0, 0), ( 0, 0, ±2, 0), ( 0, 0, 0, ±2)\n: 16: ( ±1, ±1, ±1, ±1)\n\nThese are the first two vertex sets of the [[stellation]]s of a 16-cell.<ref name=chilton>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2314564 The Stellated Forms of the Sixteen-Cell]  B.

The three octahedra formed in this way from the three pairs of opposite cube squares form the compound of three octahedra.<ref name=\"bakos\">{{citation|title=Octahedra inscribed in a cube|first1=T.|last1=Bakos|first2=Norman W.|last2=Johnson|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|volume=43|issue=343|year=1959|pages=17–20|jstor=3608867}}.</ref> The eight cube vertices are the same as the eight points in the compound where three edges cross each other.<ref name=\"coxeter\"/> Each of the octahedron edges that participates in these triple crossings is divided by the crossing point in the ratio 1:[[square root of 2|{{radic|2}}]].<ref name=\"coxeter\"/> The remaining octahedron edges cross each other in pairs, within the interior of the compound; their crossings are at their midpoints and form right angles.\n\nThe compound of three octahedra can also be formed from three copies of a single octahedron by rotating each copy by an angle of π/4 around one of the three [[symmetry axis|symmetry axes]] that pass through two opposite vertices of the starting octahedron.<ref name=\"wenninger\">{{citation|title=Some interesting octahedral compounds|first=M.

The other two octahedra have coordinates that may be obtained from these coordinates by exchanging the ''z'' coordinate for the ''x'' or ''y'' coordinate.<ref name=\"bakos\"/><ref name=\"coxeter\"/>\n\n==Symmetries==\n[[File:Three flattened octahedra compound.png|thumb|right|The [[First stellation of rhombic dodecahedron|stellated rhombic dodecahedron]], a compound of three flattened octahedra used in Escher's ''Study for Stars'' and ''[[Waterfall (M.

Escher)|Waterfall]]''.]]\nThe compound of three octahedra has the same [[symmetry group]] as a single octahedron.\nIt is an [[Isohedral figure|isohedral]] [[deltahedron]], meaning that its faces are equilateral triangles and that it has a symmetry taking every face to every other face. There is one known infinite family of isohedral deltahedra, and 36 more that do not fall into this family; the compound of three octahedra is one of the 36 sporadic examples.<ref name=\"isohedral\">{{citation|title=Isohedral deltahedra|first=G.

A different form of the tetrakis hexahedron, formed by using taller pyramids on each face of the cube, is non-convex but has equilateral triangle faces that again lie on the same planes as the faces of the three octahedra; it is another of the known isohedral deltahedra. A third isohedral deltahedron sharing the same face planes, the [[compound of six tetrahedra]], may be formed by [[stellation|stellating]] each face of the compound of three octahedra to form three [[stella octangula|stellae octangulae]]. A fourth isohedral deltahedron with the same face planes, also a stellation of the compound of three octahedra, has the same combinatorial structure as the tetrakis hexahedron but with the cube faces dented inwards into intersecting pyramids rather than attaching the pyramids to the exterior of the cube.<ref name=\"isohedral\"/>\n\nThe cube around which the three octahedra can be circumscribed has nine planes of [[reflection symmetry]]. Three of these reflection panes pass parallel to the sides of the cube, halfway between two opposite sides; the other six pass diagonally across the cube, through four of its vertices. These nine planes coincide with the nine equatorial planes of the three octahedra.<ref name=\"coxeter\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn the 15th-century manuscript ''Libellus De Quinque Corporibus Regularibus'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], della Francesca already includes a drawing of an octahedron circumscribed around a cube, with eight of the cube edges lying in the octahedron's eight faces. Three octahedra circumscribed in this way around a single cube would form the compound of three octahedra, but della Francesca does not depict the compound.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/piero.html|last=Hart|first=George W.|authorlink=George W. Hart|contribution=Piero della Francesca's Polyhedra|title=Virtual Polyhedra|year=1998}}.</ref>\n\nThe next appearance of the compound of three octahedra in the mathematical literature appears to be a 1900 work by [[Max Brückner]], which mentions it and includes a photograph of a model of it.<ref name=\"coxeter\">{{citation\n | last = Coxeter | first = H.

The dual figure of the octahedral compound, the compound of three cubes, is also shown in a later Escher woodcut, ''[[Waterfall (M. C.
