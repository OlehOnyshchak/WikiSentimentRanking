      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_duality",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Poincaré duality''' theorem, named after [[Henri Poincaré]], is a basic result on the structure of the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology]] [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of [[manifold]]s.  It states that if ''M'' is an ''n''-dimensional [[Orientability|oriented]] [[closed manifold]] ([[Compact space|compact]] and without boundary), then the ''k''th cohomology group of ''M'' is [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'')th homology group of ''M'', for all integers ''k'' \n:<math>H^k(M) \\cong H_{n-k}(M).</math>\n\nPoincaré duality holds for any coefficient ring, so long as one has taken an orientation with respect to that coefficient ring; in particular, since every manifold has a unique orientation mod 2, Poincaré duality holds mod 2 without any assumption of orientation.\n\n== History ==\nA form of Poincaré duality was first stated, without proof, by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1893. It was stated in terms of [[Betti number]]s: The ''k''th and {{nowrap|(''n''&minus;''k'')}}th Betti numbers of a closed (i.e. compact and without boundary) orientable ''n''-manifold are equal. The ''cohomology'' concept was at that time about 40 years from being clarified. In his 1895 paper ''[[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]]'', Poincaré tried to prove the theorem using topological [[intersection theory]], which he had invented. Criticism of his work by [[Poul Heegaard]] led him to realize that his proof was seriously flawed. In the first two complements to ''Analysis Situs'', Poincaré gave a new proof in terms of dual triangulations.\n\nPoincaré duality did not take on its modern form until the advent of cohomology in the 1930s, when [[Eduard Čech]] and [[Hassler Whitney]] invented the [[cup product|cup]] and [[cap product]]s and formulated Poincaré duality in these new terms.\n\n== Modern formulation ==\nThe modern statement of the Poincaré duality theorem is in terms of homology and cohomology: if <math>M </math> is a closed oriented ''n''-manifold, and <math>k</math> is a natural number smaller than <math>n</math>, then there is a canonically defined isomorphism from the <math>k</math>-th cohomology group <math>H^k(M,\\mathbb Z)</math> to the {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')}}th homology group <math>H_{n-k}(M,\\mathbb Z)</math>. (Here, homology and cohomology is integral, but the isomorphism holds for any coefficient ring.) Specifically, one maps an element of <math>H^k(M)</math> to its cap product with a [[fundamental class]] of <math>M</math>, which will exist for oriented <math>M</math>. In particular, the map <math>H^k(M, \\mathbb Z) \\to H_{n-k}(M, \\mathbb Z)</math> given by <math>\\alpha \\mapsto [M]\\frown \\alpha</math> is an isomorphism.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Topology-Allen-Hatcher/dp/0521795400|title=Algebraic Topology|last=results|first=search|date=2001-12-03|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521795401|edition= 1st|location=Cambridge|language=English}}</ref>\n\nFor non-compact oriented manifolds, one has to replace cohomology by [[cohomology with compact support]].\n\nHomology and cohomology groups are defined to be zero for negative degrees, so Poincaré duality in particular implies that the homology and cohomology groups of orientable closed ''n''-manifolds are zero for degrees bigger than ''n''.\n\n== Dual cell structures ==\nGiven a triangulated manifold, there is a corresponding dual polyhedral decomposition.  The dual polyhedral decomposition is a cell decomposition of the manifold such that the ''k''-cells of the dual polyhedral decomposition are in bijective correspondence with the (''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''k'')-cells of the triangulation, generalising the notion of [[dual polyhedron|dual polyhedra]].\n\n[[File:Dually007.png|thumb|350px|right|<math>\\cup_{S \\in T} \\Delta \\cap  DS</math> – a picture of the parts of the dual-cells in a top-dimensional simplex.]]\n\nPrecisely, let ''T'' be a triangulation of an ''n''-manifold ''M''.  Let ''S'' be a simplex of ''T''.  We denote the dual cell (to be defined precisely) corresponding to ''S'' by ''DS''.  Let <math>\\Delta</math> be a top-dimensional simplex of ''T'' containing ''S''.  So we can think of ''S'' as a subset of the vertices of <math>\\Delta</math>.  Then <math>\\Delta \\cap DS</math> is defined to be the convex hull (in <math>\\Delta</math>) of the barycentres of all subsets of the vertices of <math>\\Delta</math> that contain <math>S</math>.  One can check that if ''S'' is ''i''-dimensional, then ''DS'' is an (''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''i'')-dimensional cell.  Moreover, the dual cells to ''T'' form a CW-decomposition of ''M'', and the only (''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;i)-dimensional dual cell that intersects an ''i''-cell ''S'' is ''DS''.  Thus the pairing <math>C_i M \\otimes C_{n-i} M \\to \\mathbb Z</math> given by taking intersections induces an isomorphism <math>C_i M \\to C^{n-i} M</math>, where <math>C_i</math> is the cellular homology of the triangulation ''T'', and <math>C_{n-i} M</math> and <math>C^{n-i} M</math> are the cellular homologies and cohomologies of the dual polyhedral/CW decomposition the manifold respectively.  The fact that this is an isomorphism of [[chain complex]]es is a proof of Poincaré Duality.  Roughly speaking, this amounts to the fact that the boundary relation for the triangulation ''T'' is the incidence relation for the dual polyhedral decomposition under the correspondence <math>S \\longmapsto DS</math>.\n\n=== Naturality ===\nNote that ''H''<sup>''k''</sup> is a [[contravariant functor]] while ''H''<sub>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''</sub> is [[covariant functor|covariant]]. The family of isomorphisms\n\n:''D''<sub>''M''</sub> : ''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'') → ''H''<sub>''n'' &minus; ''k''</sub>(''M'')\n\nis [[natural transformation|natural]] in the following sense: if\n\n:''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''\n\nis a [[continuous map]] between two oriented ''n''-manifolds which is compatible with orientation, i.e. which maps the fundamental class of ''M'' to the fundamental class of ''N'', then\n\n:''D<sub>N</sub>'' = ''f''<sub>∗</sub> ''D<sub>M</sub>'' ''f''<sup>∗</sup>,\n\nwhere ''f''<sub>∗</sub> and ''f''<sup>∗</sup> are the maps induced by ''f'' in homology and cohomology, respectively.\n\nNote the very strong and crucial hypothesis that ''f'' maps the fundamental class of ''M'' to the fundamental class of ''N''.  Naturality does not hold for an arbitrary continuous map ''f'', since in general ''f''<sup>∗</sup> is not an injection on cohomology.  For example, if ''f'' is a covering map then it maps the fundamental class of ''M'' to a multiple of the fundamental class of ''N''.  This multiple is the degree of the map ''f''.\n\n== Bilinear pairings formulation ==\n\nAssuming ''M'' is compact boundaryless and [[orientable manifold|orientable]],　let\n\n:<math>\\tau H_i M</math>\n\ndenote the [[torsion (algebra)|torsion]] subgroup of <math>H_i M</math> and let\n\n:<math>fH_i M = H_i M / \\tau H_i M</math>\n\nbe the [[free group|free]] part – all homology groups taken with integer coefficients in this section. Then there are [[bilinear operator|bilinear maps]] which are [[duality pairing]]s (explained below).\n\n:<math>fH_i M \\otimes fH_{n-i} M \\to \\mathbb Z</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\tau H_i M \\otimes \\tau H_{n-i-1} M \\to \\mathbb Q / \\mathbb Z.</math>\n:<small>(Here <math>\\mathbb Q / \\mathbb Z</math> is the quotient of the rationals by the integers, taken as an additive group.)</small>\n:<small>(Notice that in the torsion linking form, there is a &minus;1 in the dimension, so the paired dimensions add up to <math>n-1,</math> rather than to <math>n.</math>)</small>\n\nThe first form is typically called the ''[[intersection theory|intersection product]]'' and the 2nd the ''torsion linking form''.{{anchor|torsion linking form}}  Assuming the manifold ''M'' is smooth, the intersection product is computed by perturbing the homology classes to be transverse and computing their oriented intersection number.  For the torsion linking form, one computes the pairing of ''x'' and ''y'' by realizing ''nx'' as the boundary of some class ''z''.  The form is the fraction with numerator the transverse intersection number of ''z'' with ''y'' and denominator ''n''.\n\nThe statement that the pairings are duality pairings means that the adjoint maps \n:<math>fH_i M \\to \\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathbb Z}(fH_{n-i} M,\\mathbb Z)</math>\nand \n:<math>\\tau H_i M \\to \\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathbb Z}(\\tau H_{n-i-1} M, \\mathbb Q/\\mathbb Z)</math>\nare isomorphisms of groups.\n\nThis result is an application of Poincaré Duality\n\n:<math>H_i M \\simeq H^{n-i} M</math>\n\ntogether with the [[universal coefficient theorem]] which gives an identification \n:<math>fH^{n-i} M \\equiv \\mathrm{Hom}(H_{n-i} M; \\mathbb Z)</math>\nand \n:<math>\\tau H^{n-i} M \\equiv \\mathrm{Ext}(H_{n-i-1} M; \\mathbb Z) \\equiv \\mathrm{Hom}(\\tau H_{n-i-1} M; \\mathbb Q/\\mathbb Z)</math>.\nThus, Poincaré duality says that <math>fH_i M</math> and <math>fH_{n-i} M</math> are isomorphic, although there is no natural map giving the isomorphism, and similarly <math>\\tau H_i M</math> and <math>\\tau H_{n-i-1} M</math> are also isomorphic, though not naturally.\n\n;Middle dimension\nWhile for most dimensions, Poincaré duality induces a bilinear ''pairing'' between different homology groups, in the middle dimension it induces a [[bilinear form|bilinear ''form'']] on a single homology group. The resulting [[Intersection theory#Topological intersection form|intersection form]] is a very important topological invariant.\n\nWhat is meant by \"middle dimension\" depends on parity. For even dimension <math>n = 2k,</math> which is more common, this is literally the middle dimension ''k,'' and there is a form on the free part of the middle homology:\n:<math>fH_k M \\otimes fH_k M \\to \\mathbb Z</math>\n\nBy contrast, for odd dimension <math>n = 2k+1,</math> which is less commonly discussed, it is most simply the lower middle dimension ''k,'' and there is a form on the torsion part of the homology in that dimension:\n:<math>\\tau H_k M \\otimes \\tau H_k M \\to \\mathbb Q / \\mathbb Z.</math>\nHowever, there is also a pairing between the free part of the homology in the lower middle dimension ''k'' and in the upper middle dimension ''k''+1:\n:<math>fH_k M \\otimes fH_{k+1} M \\to \\mathbb Z.</math>\nThe resulting groups, while not a single group with a bilinear form, are a simple chain complex and are studied in algebraic [[L-theory]].\n\n;Applications\nThis approach to Poincaré duality was used by Przytycki and Yasuhara to give an elementary homotopy and diffeomorphism classification of 3-dimensional [[lens space]]s.<ref>\n{{citation|last1=Przytycki|authorlink=Józef H. Przytycki|last2=Yasuhara|title=Symmetry of Links and Classification of Lens Spaces|journal=Geom. Ded.|volume=98|year=2003|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n== Thom Isomorphism Formulation ==\n\nPoincaré Duality is closely related to the [[Thom space|Thom Isomorphism Theorem]], as we will explain here.  For this exposition, let <math>M</math> be a compact, boundaryless oriented ''n''-manifold.  Let <math>M \\times M</math> be the product of <math>M</math> with itself, let <math>V</math> be an open tubular neighbourhood of the diagonal in <math>M \\times M</math>. Consider the maps:\n\n:* <math> H_* M \\otimes H_* M \\to H_* (M \\times M)</math> the [[Künneth theorem|Homology Cross Product]]\n\n:* <math>H_* (M \\times M) \\to H_* \\left(M \\times M, (M \\times M) \\setminus V\\right)</math> inclusion.\n\n:* <math>H_* \\left(M \\times M, (M \\times M) \\setminus V\\right) \\to H_* (\\nu M, \\partial \\nu M) </math> [[excision theorem|excision map]] where <math>\\nu M</math> is the [[normal bundle|normal disc bundle]] of the diagonal in <math>M \\times M</math>.\n\n:* <math>H_* (\\nu M, \\partial \\nu M) \\to H_{*-n} M</math> the [[Thom space|Thom Isomorphism]]. This map is well-defined as there is a standard identification <math>\\nu M \\equiv TM</math> which is an oriented bundle, so the Thom Isomorphism applies.\n\nCombined, this gives a map <math>H_i M \\otimes H_j M \\to H_{i+j-n} M</math>, which is the ''intersection product''—strictly speaking it is a generalization of the intersection product above, but it is also called the intersection product.  A similar argument with the [[Künneth theorem]] gives the ''torsion linking form''.\n\nThis formulation of Poincaré Duality has become quite popular<ref>{{citation |last=Rudyak |first=Y. |title=On Thom Spectra, Orientablility and Cobordism |location= |publisher=Springer SMM |year=1998 |isbn=3-540-62043-5 }}</ref> as it provides a means to define Poincaré Duality for any [[generalized homology theory]] provided one has a Thom Isomorphism for that homology theory. A Thom isomorphism theorem for a homology theory is now accepted as the generalized notion of [[orientability]] for a homology theory.  For example, a [[spin structure|<math>spin^c</math>-structure]] on a manifold turns out to be precisely what is needed to be orientable in the sense of [[k-theory|complex topological k-theory]].\n\n== Generalizations and related results ==\nThe [[Poincaré–Lefschetz duality theorem]] is a generalisation for manifolds with boundary. In the non-orientable case, taking into account the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of local orientations, one can give a statement that is independent of orientability: see [[Twisted Poincaré duality]].\n\n''Blanchfield duality'' is a version of Poincaré duality which provides an isomorphism between the homology of an abelian covering space of a manifold and the corresponding cohomology with compact supports.  It is used to get basic structural results about the [[Alexander polynomial|Alexander module]] and can be used to define the [[signature of a knot|signatures of a knot]].\n\nWith the development of [[homology theory]] to include [[K-theory]] and other ''extraordinary'' theories from about 1955, it was realised that the homology ''H''<sub>*</sub> could be replaced by other theories, once the products on manifolds were constructed; and there are now textbook treatments in generality.  More specifically, there is a general Poincaré duality theorem for a [[generalized homology theory]] which requires a notion of orientation with respect to a homology theory, and is formulated in terms of a generalized [[Thom space|Thom Isomorphism Theorem]].  The [[Thom space|Thom Isomorphism Theorem]] in this regard can be considered as the germinal idea for Poincaré duality for generalized homology theories.\n\n[[Verdier duality]] is the appropriate generalization to (possibly [[singularity theory|singular]]) geometric objects, such as [[analytic space]]s or [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], while [[intersection homology]] was developed [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|R. MacPherson]] and [[M. Goresky]] for [[stratified space]]s, such as real or complex algebraic varieties, precisely so as to generalise Poincaré duality to such stratified spaces.\n\nThere are many other forms of geometric duality in [[algebraic topology]], including [[Lefschetz duality]], [[Alexander duality]], [[Hodge duality]], and [[S-duality (homotopy theory)|S-duality]].\n\nMore algebraically, one can abstract the notion of a [[Poincaré complex]], which is an algebraic object that behaves like the [[singular chain complex]] of a manifold, notably satisfying Poincaré duality on its homology groups, with respect to a distinguished element (corresponding to the fundamental class). These are used in [[surgery theory]] to algebraicize questions about manifolds. A [[Poincaré space]] is one whose singular chain complex is a Poincaré complex. These are not all manifolds, but their failure to be manifolds can be measured by [[obstruction theory]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bruhat decomposition]]\n* [[Fundamental class]]\n* [[Weyl group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation |first=R.

A regular embedding of codimension one is precisely an [[effective Cartier divisor]].\n\n== Examples and usage ==\nFor example, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[smooth morphism|smooth]] over a scheme ''S'' and if ''i'' is an ''S''-morphism, then ''i'' is a regular embedding. In particular, every section of a smooth morphism is a regular embedding.<ref>{{harvnb|Sernesi|loc=D.

The important fact is that when ''i'' is a regular embedding, if ''I'' is the ideal sheaf of ''X'' in ''Y'', then the [[normal sheaf]], the dual of <math>I/I^2</math>, is locally free (thus a vector bundle) and the natural map <math>\\operatorname{Sym}(I/I^2) \\to \\oplus_0^\\infty I^n/I^{n+1}</math> is an isomorphism: the [[normal cone (algebraic geometry)|normal cone]] <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(\\oplus_0^\\infty I^n/I^{n+1})</math> coincides with the normal bundle.\n\nA morphism of finite type <math>f:X \\to Y</math> is called a '''(local) complete intersection morphism''' if each point ''x'' in ''X'' has an open affine neighborhood ''U'' so that ''f'' |<sub>''U''</sub> factors as <math>U \\overset{j}\\to V \\overset{g}\\to Y</math> where ''j'' is a regular embedding and ''g'' is [[smooth morphism|smooth]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sernesi|loc=D.2.1.}}</ref> For example, if ''f'' is a morphism between [[smooth variety|smooth varieties]], then ''f'' factors as <math>X \\to X \\times Y \\to Y</math> where the first map is the [[graph morphism (algebraic geometry)|graph morphism]] and so is a complete intersection morphism.\n\n=== Non Examples ===\nOne non-example is a scheme which isn't equidimensional. For example, the scheme\n:<math>\nX = \\text{Spec}\\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(xz,yz)}\\right)\n</math>\nis the union of <math>\\mathbb{A}^2</math> and <math>\\mathbb{A}^1</math>. Then, the embedding <math>X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{A}^3</math> isn't regular since taking any non-origin point on the <math>z</math>-axis is of dimension <math>1</math> while any non-origin point on the <math>xy</math>-plane is of dimension <math>2</math>.\n\n== Non-noetherian case ==\n[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique du Bois Marie|SGA 6 Expo VII]] uses the following weakened form of the notion of a regular embedding, that agrees with the usual one for Noetherian schemes.\n\nFirst, given a [[projective module]] ''E'' over a commutative ring ''A'', an ''A''-linear map <math>u: E \\to A</math> is called '''Koszul-regular''' if the [[Koszul complex]] determined by it is [[acyclic complex|acyclic]] in dimension > 0 (consequently, it is a resolution of the cokernel of ''u'').<ref>{{harvnb|SGA 6|loc=Expo VII.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Ribet's theorem''' (earlier called the '''epsilon conjecture''' or '''ε-conjecture''') is a statement in [[number theory]] concerning properties of [[Galois representation]]s associated with [[modular form]]s. It was proposed by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and proven by [[Ken Ribet]]. The proof of the epsilon conjecture was a significant step towards the proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. As shown by Serre and Ribet, the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] (whose status was unresolved at the time) and the epsilon conjecture together imply that Fermat's Last Theorem is true.\n\nIn mathematical terms, Ribet's theorem shows that if the Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve has certain properties, then that curve cannot be modular (in the sense that there cannot exist a modular form which gives rise to the same Galois representation).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210102243/http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/flt/flt08.htm | title=The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem| date=2008-12-10}}</ref>\n\n== Statement ==\n\nLet ''f'' be a weight 2 [[Atkin–Lehner theory|newform]] on Γ<sub>0</sub>(''qN'')&ndash;i.e. of level ''qN'' where ''q'' does not divide ''N''&ndash;with absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional mod ''p'' Galois representation ''ρ<sub>f,p</sub>'' unramified at ''q'' if ''q'' ≠ ''p'' and finite flat at ''q'' = ''p''.  Then there exists a weight 2 newform ''g'' of level ''N'' such that\n:<math> \\rho_{f,p} \\simeq \\rho_{g,p}. </math>\n\nIn particular, if ''E'' is an [[elliptic curve]] over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> with [[conductor of an elliptic curve|conductor]] ''qN'', then the [[modularity theorem]] guarantees that there exists a weight 2 newform ''f'' of level ''qN'' such that the 2-dimensional mod ''p'' Galois representation ''ρ<sub>f, p</sub>'' of ''f'' is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional mod ''p'' Galois representation ''ρ<sub>E, p</sub>'' of ''E''.  To apply Ribet's Theorem to ''ρ''<sub>''E'', ''p''</sub>, it suffices to check the irreducibility and ramification of ''ρ<sub>E, p</sub>''.  Using the theory of the [[Tate curve]], one can prove that ''ρ<sub>E, p</sub>'' is unramified at ''q'' ≠ ''p'' and finite flat at ''q'' = ''p'' if ''p'' divides the power to which ''q'' appears in the minimal discriminant Δ<sub>''E''</sub>.  Then Ribet's theorem implies that there exists a weight 2 newform ''g'' of level ''N'' such that ''ρ''<sub>''g'', ''p''</sub> ≈ ''ρ''<sub>''E'', ''p''</sub>.\n\n== The result of level lowering ==\n\nNote that Ribet's theorem '''does not''' guarantee that if one begins with an elliptic curve ''E'' of conductor ''qN'', there exists an elliptic curve ''E' '' of level ''N'' such that ''ρ''<sub>''E, p''</sub> ≈ ''ρ''<sub>''E''&prime;, ''p''</sub>.  The newform ''g'' of level ''N'' may not have rational Fourier coefficients, and hence may be associated to a higher-dimensional [[Abelian variety]], not an elliptic curve.

Rather, the mod ''p'' Galois representation is isomorphic to the mod ''p'' Galois representation of an irrational newform ''g'' of level 97.\n\nHowever, for ''p'' large enough compared to the level ''N'' of the level-lowered newform, a rational newform (e.g. an elliptic curve) must level-lower to another rational newform (e.g. elliptic curve).  In particular for ''p'' ≫ ''N''<sup>''N''<sup>1+''ε''</sup></sup>, the mod ''p'' Galois representation of a rational newform cannot be isomorphic to that of an irrational newform of level ''N''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Silliman | first1 = Jesse| last2=Vogt| first2=Isabel | arxiv=1307.5078 |title=Powers in Lucas Sequences via Galois Representations |year=2015|mr=3293720|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=143|issue=3|pages=1027–1041|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-2014-12316-1| citeseerx = 10.1.1.742.7591}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Frey-[[Barry_Mazur|Mazur]] conjecture predicts that for ''p'' large enough (independent of the conductor ''N''), elliptic curves with isomorphic mod ''p'' Galois representations are in fact [[Isogeny|isogenous]], and hence have the same conductor.

Let us form the corresponding Frey curve ''E''<sub>''a''<sup>''p''</sup>,''b''<sup>''p''</sup>,''c''<sup>''p''</sup></sub>. It is an elliptic curve and one can show that its [[Discriminant|minimal discriminant]] Δ is equal to 2<sup>−8</sup> (''abc'')<sup>2''p''</sup> and its conductor ''N'' is the [[radical of an integer|radical]] of ''abc'', i.e. the product of all distinct primes dividing ''abc''.  By an elementary consideration of the equation ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup> = ''c''<sup>''p''</sup>, it is clear that one of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' is even and hence so is ''N''. By the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, ''E'' is a modular elliptic curve. Since all odd primes dividing ''a,b,c'' in ''N'' appear to a ''p''th power in the minimal discriminant Δ, by Ribet's theorem one can perform [[Atkin–Lehner theory|level]] [[Descent (mathematics)|descent]] modulo ''p'' repetitively to strip off all odd primes from the conductor.  However, there are no newforms of level 2 as the genus of the modular curve ''X''<sub>0</sub>(2) is zero (and newforms of level ''N'' are differentials on ''X''<sub>0</sub>(''N'')).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[abc conjecture]]\n* [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references responsive=\"0\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Kenneth Ribet, [http://www.numdam.org/item?id=AFST_1990_5_11_1_116_0 ''From the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture to Fermat's last theorem''.] Annales de la faculté des sciences de Toulouse Sér. 5, 11 no. 1 (1990), p.&nbsp;116–139.\n* {{cite journal | author = Andrew Wiles | authorlink=Andrew Wiles |date=May 1995 | title = Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem | journal = Annals of Mathematics | volume = 141 | issue = 3 | pages = 443–551 | url = http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/wiles.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2118559 | jstor=2118559 | citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9076 }}\n* {{cite journal | author = [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] and Andrew Wiles |date=May 1995 | title = Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras | journal = Annals of Mathematics | volume = 141 | issue = 3 | pages = 553–572 | url = http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/taylor-wiles.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2118560 | issn=0003-486X|oclc=37032255 | jstor = 2118560 | zbl = 0823.11030|citeseerx=10.1.1.128.531 }}\n* [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FreyCurve.html Frey Curve] and [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RibetsTheorem.html Ribet's Theorem]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.msri.org/communications/vmath/VMathVideos/VideoInfo/3830/show_video Ken Ribet and Fermat's Last Theorem] by [[Kevin Buzzard]] June 28, 2008\n\n[[Category:Algebraic curves]]\n[[Category:Riemann surfaces]]\n[[Category:Modular forms]]\n[[Category:Theorems in number theory]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:Fermat's Last Theorem]]"

      "text": "The '''Riemann–Roch theorem''' is an important theorem in [[mathematics]], specifically in [[complex analysis]] and [[algebraic geometry]], for the computation of the dimension of the space of [[meromorphic function]]s with prescribed zeroes and allowed [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]]. It relates the complex analysis of a connected [[Compact space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]] with the surface's purely topological [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'', in a way that can be carried over into purely algebraic settings.\n\nInitially proved as '''Riemann's inequality''' by {{harvtxt|Riemann|1857}}, the theorem reached its definitive form for Riemann surfaces after work of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s short-lived student {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gustav Roch|first=Gustav|last=Roch|year=1865}}. It was later generalized to [[algebraic curve]]s, to higher-dimensional [[algebraic variety|varieties]] and beyond.\n\n== Preliminary notions==\n[[File:Triple torus illustration.png|right|thumb|A Riemann surface of genus 3.]]\nA [[Riemann surface]] ''X'' is a [[topological space]] that is locally homeomorphic to an open subset of '''C''', the set of complex numbers. In addition, the [[transition map]]s between these open subsets are required to be [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]]. The latter condition allows one to transfer the notions and methods of [[complex analysis]] dealing with holomorphic and [[meromorphic function]]s on '''C''' to the surface ''X''. For the purposes of the Riemann–Roch theorem, the surface ''X'' is always assumed to be [[compact topological space|compact]]. Colloquially speaking, the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' of a Riemann surface is its number of handles; for example the genus of the Riemann surface shown at the right is three. More precisely, the genus is defined as half of the first [[Betti number]], i.e., half of the '''C'''-dimension of the first [[singular homology]] group H<sub>1</sub>(''X'', '''C''') with complex coefficients. The genus [[Classification theorem|classifies]] compact Riemann surfaces [[up to]] [[homeomorphism]], i.e., two such surfaces are homeomorphic if and only if their genus is the same. Therefore, the genus is an important topological invariant of a Riemann surface. On the other hand, [[Hodge theory]] shows that the genus coincides with the ('''C'''-)dimension of the space of holomorphic one-forms on ''X'', so the genus also encodes complex-analytic information about the Riemann surface.<ref>Griffith, Harris, p. 116, 117</ref>\n\nA [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)#Weil divisor|divisor]] ''D'' is an element of the [[free abelian group]] on the points of the surface. Equivalently, a divisor is a finite linear combination of points of the surface with integer coefficients.\n\nAny meromorphic function ''f'' gives rise to a divisor denoted (''f'') defined as\n\n:<math>(f):=\\sum_{z_\\nu \\in R(f)} s_\\nu z_\\nu</math>\n\nwhere ''R''(''f'') is the set of all zeroes and poles of ''f'', and ''s<sub>ν</sub>'' is given by\n\n:<math>s_\\nu :=\\begin{cases} a & \\text{if } z_\\nu \\text{ is a zero of order }a \\\\\n                            -a & \\text{if } z_\\nu \\text{ is a pole of order }a. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe set ''R''(''f'') is known to be finite; this is a consequence of ''X'' being compact and the fact that the zeros of a (non-zero) holomorphic function do not have an [[accumulation point]]. Therefore, (''f'') is well-defined. Any divisor of this form is called a [[principal divisor]]. Two divisors that differ by a principal divisor are called [[linearly equivalent]]. The divisor of a meromorphic [[1-form]] is defined similarly. A divisor of a global meromorphic 1-form is called the [[canonical divisor]] (usually denoted ''K''). Any two meromorphic 1-forms will yield linearly equivalent divisors, so the canonical divisor is uniquely determined up to linear equivalence (hence \"the\" canonical divisor).\n\nThe symbol deg(''D'') denotes the ''degree'' (occasionally also called index) of the divisor ''D'', i.e. the sum of the coefficients occurring in ''D''. It can be shown that the divisor of a global meromorphic function always has degree 0, so the degree of the divisor depends only on the linear equivalence class.\n\nThe number ''ℓ''(''D'') is the quantity that is of primary interest: the [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] (over '''[[complex number|C]]''') of the vector space of meromorphic functions ''h'' on the surface, such that all the coefficients of (''h'') + ''D'' are non-negative. Intuitively, we can think of this as being all meromorphic functions whose poles at every point are no worse than the corresponding coefficient in ''D''; if the coefficient in ''D'' at ''z'' is negative, then we require that ''h'' has a zero of at least that [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicity]] at ''z'' – if the coefficient in ''D'' is positive, ''h'' can have a pole of at most that order. The vector spaces for linearly equivalent divisors are naturally isomorphic through multiplication with the global meromorphic function (which is well-defined up to a scalar).\n\n== Statement of the theorem ==\n\nThe Riemann–Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface of genus ''g'' with canonical divisor ''K'' states\n\n:<math>\\ell(D)-\\ell(K-D) = \\deg(D) - g + 1.</math>\n\nTypically, the number ''ℓ''(''D'') is the one of interest, while ''ℓ''(''K'' − ''D'') is thought of as a correction term (also called index of speciality<ref>Stichtenoth p.22</ref><ref>Mukai pp.295–297</ref>) so the theorem may be roughly paraphrased by saying\n:''dimension'' − ''correction'' = ''degree'' − ''genus'' + 1.\nThe correction term ''ℓ''(''K'' − ''D'') is always non-negative, so that\n\n:<math>\\ell(D) \\ge \\deg(D) - g + 1.</math>\n\nThis is called ''Riemann's inequality''. ''Roch's part'' of the statement is the description of the possible difference between the sides of the inequality. On a general Riemann surface of genus ''g'', K has degree 2''g'' − 2, independently of the meromorphic form chosen to represent the divisor. This follows from putting ''D'' = K in the theorem. In particular, as long as ''D'' has degree at least 2''g'' − 1, the correction term is 0, so that\n\n:<math>\\ell(D) = \\deg(D) - g + 1.</math>\n\nThe theorem will now be illustrated for surfaces of low genus. There are also a number other closely related theorems: an equivalent formulation of this theorem using [[line bundle]]s and a generalization of the theorem to [[algebraic curve]]s.\n\n===Examples===\nThe theorem will be illustrated by picking a point ''P'' on the surface in question and regarding the sequence of numbers\n:<math>\\ell(n\\cdot P), n\\ge 0</math>\ni.e., the dimension of the space of functions that are holomorphic everywhere except at ''P'' where the function is allowed to have a pole of order at most ''n''. For ''n'' = 0, the functions are thus required to be [[entire function|entire]], i.e., holomorphic on the whole surface ''X''. By [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)#On_compact_Riemann_surfaces|Liouville's theorem]], such a function is necessarily constant. Therefore, ''ℓ''(0) = 1. In general, the sequence ''ℓ''(''n'' &middot; ''P'') is an increasing sequence.\n\n====Genus zero====\nThe [[Riemann sphere]] (also called [[complex projective line]]) is [[simply-connected]] and hence its first singular homology is zero. In particular its genus is zero. The sphere can be covered by two copies of '''C''', with [[transition map]] being given by\n:<math>\\mathbf C^\\times \\ni z \\mapsto 1/z.</math>\nTherefore, the form ''&omega;'' = d''z'' on one copy of '''C''' extends to a meromorphic form on the Riemann sphere: it has a double pole at infinity, since\n:<math>d\\left(\\frac 1 z \\right) = -\\frac 1{z^2} \\, dz.</math>\nThus, its divisor ''K'' := div(''&omega;'') = −2''P'' (where ''P'' is the point at infinity).\n\nTherefore, the theorem says that the sequence ''ℓ''(''n'' &middot; ''P'') reads\n\n: 1, 2, 3, ... .\n\nThis sequence can also be read off from the theory of [[partial fraction]]s. Conversely if this sequence starts this way, then ''g'' must be zero.\n\n====Genus one====\n[[File:Torus_cycles2.svg|right|thumb|A torus.]]\nThe next case is a Riemann surface of genus ''g'' = 1, such as a [[torus]] '''C''' / &Lambda;, where &Lambda; is a two-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] (a group isomorphic to '''Z'''<sup>2</sup>). Its genus is one: its first singular homology group is freely generated by two loops, as shown in the illustration at the right. The standard complex coordinate ''z'' on '''C''' yields a one-form ''&omega;'' = d''z'' on ''X'' that is everywhere holomorphic, i.e., has no poles at all. Therefore, ''K'', the divisor of &omega; is zero.\n\nOn this surface, this sequence is\n\n:1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... ;\n\nand this characterises the case ''g'' = 1. Indeed, for ''D'' = 0, ''ℓ''(''K'' − ''D'') = ''ℓ''(0) = 1, as was mentioned above. For ''D'' = ''nP'' with ''n'' > 0, the degree of ''K'' − ''D'' is strictly negative, so that the correction term is 0. The sequence of dimensions can also be derived from the theory of [[elliptic function]]s.\n\n====Genus two and beyond====\nFor ''g'' = 2, the sequence mentioned above is\n\n:1, 1, ?, 2, 3, ... .\n\nIt is shown from this that the ? term of degree 2 is either 1 or 2, depending on the point. It can be proven that in any genus 2 curve there are exactly six points whose sequences are 1, 1, 2, 2, ... and the rest of the points have the generic sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, ... In particular, a genus 2 curve is a [[hyperelliptic curve]]. For ''g'' > 2 it is always true that at most points the sequence starts with ''g+1'' ones and there are finitely many points with other sequences (see [[Weierstrass point]]s).\n\n===Riemann–Roch for line bundles===\nUsing the close correspondence between divisors and [[holomorphic line bundle]]s on a Riemann surface, the theorem can also be stated in a different, yet equivalent way: let ''L'' be a holomorphic line bundle on ''X''. Let <math>H^0(X,L)</math> denote the space of holomorphic sections of ''L''. This space will be finite-dimensional; its dimension is denoted <math> h^0(X,L)</math>. Let ''K'' denote the [[canonical bundle]] on ''X''. Then, the Riemann–Roch theorem states that\n\n:<math>h^0(X,L)-h^0(X,L^{-1}\\otimes K)=\\deg(L)+1-g.</math>\n\nThe theorem of the previous section is the special case of when ''L'' is a [[point bundle]].\n\nThe theorem can be applied to show that there are ''g'' linearly independent holomorphic sections of ''K'', or [[one-form]]s on ''X'', as follows. Taking ''L'' to be the trivial bundle, <math> h^0(X,L)=1</math> since the only holomorphic functions on ''X'' are constants. The degree of ''L'' is zero, and <math>L^{-1}</math> is the trivial bundle. Thus,\n\n:<math>1-h^0(X,K)=1-g.</math>\n\nTherefore, <math>h^0(X,K)=g</math>, proving that there are ''g'' holomorphic one-forms.\n\n===Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic curves===\nEvery item in the above formulation of the Riemann–Roch theorem for divisors on Riemann surfaces has an analogue in [[algebraic geometry]]. The analogue of a Riemann surface is a [[non-singular]] [[algebraic curve]] ''C'' over a field ''k''. The difference in terminology (curve vs. surface) is because the dimension of a Riemann surface as a real [[manifold]] is two, but one as a complex manifold. The compactness of a Riemann surface is paralleled by the condition that the algebraic curve be [[complete variety|complete]], which is equivalent to being [[projective variety|projective]]. Over a general field ''k'', there is no good notion of singular (co)homology. The so-called [[geometric genus]] is defined as\n:<math>g(C) := \\dim_k \\Gamma(C, \\Omega^1_C)</math>\ni.e., as the dimension of the space of globally defined (algebraic) one-forms (see [[Kähler differential]]). Finally, meromorphic functions on a Riemann surface are locally represented as fractions of holomorphic functions. Hence they are replaced by [[rational function]]s which are locally fractions of [[regular function]]s. Thus, writing ''ℓ''(''D'') for the dimension (over ''k'') of the space of rational functions on the curve whose poles at every point are not worse than the corresponding coefficient in ''D'', the very same formula as above holds:\n:<math>\\ell(D)-\\ell(K-D) = \\deg(D) - g + 1.</math>\nwhere ''C'' is a projective non-singular algebraic curve over an [[algebraically closed field]] ''k''. In fact, the same formula holds for projective curves over any field, except that the degree of a divisor needs to take into account [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicities]] coming from the possible extensions of the base field and the [[residue field]]s of the points supporting the divisor.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Liu | first1=Qing | title=Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=978-0-19-850284-5 | year=2002}}, Section 7.3</ref> Finally, for a proper curve over an [[Artinian ring]], the Euler characteristic of the line bundle associated to a divisor is given by the degree of the divisor (appropriately defined) plus the Euler characteristic of the structural sheaf <math>\\mathcal O</math>.<ref>* {{Citation | last1=Altman | first1=Allen | last2=Kleiman | first2=Steven | author2-link=Steven Kleiman | title=Introduction to Grothendieck duality theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 146 | year=1970}}, Theorem VIII.1.4., p. 164</ref>\n\nThe smoothness assumption in the theorem can be relaxed, as well: for a (projective) curve over an algebraically closed field, all of whose local rings are [[Gorenstein ring]]s, the same statement as above holds, provided that the geometric genus as defined above is replaced by the [[arithmetic genus]] ''g''<sub>''a''</sub>, defined as\n:<math>g_a := \\dim_k H^1(C, \\mathcal O_C).</math><ref>{{Citation | last1=Hartshorne | first1=Robin | author1-link=Robin Hartshorne | title=Generalized divisors on Gorenstein curves and a theorem of Noether | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.kjm/1250520873 | year=1986 | journal=Journal of Mathematics of Kyoto University | issn=0023-608X | volume=26 | issue=3 | pages=375–386 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007032634/http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.kjm%2F1250520873 | archivedate=2013-10-07 | df= }}</ref>\n(For smooth curves, the geometric genus agrees with the arithmetic one.)

The integer ''ℓ''(''D'') is the dimension of the space of global sections of the [[line bundle]] <math>\\mathcal L(D)</math> associated to ''D'' (''cf.'' [[Cartier divisor]]). In terms of [[sheaf cohomology]], we therefore have <math>\\ell (D) = \\mathrm {dim} H^0 (X, \\mathcal L(D))</math>, and likewise <math>\\ell (\\mathcal K_X - D) = \\dim H^0 (X, \\omega_X \\otimes \\mathcal L(D)^\\vee) </math>. But Serre duality for non-singular projective varieties in the particular case of a curve states that <math>H^0 (X, \\omega_X \\otimes \\mathcal L(D)^\\vee)</math> is isomorphic to the dual <math>H^1 (X, \\mathcal L (D))^\\vee</math>. The left hand side thus equals the [[Euler characteristic]] of the divisor ''D''. When ''D'' = 0, we find the Euler characteristic for the structure sheaf is <math>1-g</math> by definition. To prove the theorem for general divisor, one can then proceed by adding points one by one to the divisor and ensure that the Euler characteristic transforms accordingly to the right hand side.\n\nThe theorem for compact Riemann surfaces can be deduced from the algebraic version using [[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#Chow.27s theorem|Chow's Theorem]] and the [[GAGA]] principle: in fact, every compact Riemann surface is defined by algebraic equations in some complex projective space. (Chow's Theorem says that any closed analytic subvariety of projective space is defined by algebraic equations, and the GAGA principle says that sheaf cohomology of an algebraic variety is the same as the sheaf cohomology of the analytic variety defined by the same equations).\n\n== Applications ==\nAn irreducible plane algebraic curve of degree ''d'' has (''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)(''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2)/2&nbsp;−&nbsp;''g'' singularities, when properly counted. It follows that, if a curve has (''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)(''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2)/2 different singularities, it is a [[rational curve]] and, thus, admits a rational parameterization.\n\nThe [[Riemann–Hurwitz formula]] concerning (ramified) maps between Riemann surfaces or algebraic curves is a consequence of the Riemann–Roch theorem.\n\n[[Clifford's theorem on special divisors]] is also a consequence of the Riemann–Roch theorem. It states that for a special divisor (i.e., such that ''ℓ''(''K'' − ''D'') > 0) satisfying ''ℓ''(''D'') > 0, the following inequality holds:<ref>{{Citation | last1=Fulton | first1=William | author1-link=William Fulton (mathematician) | title=Algebraic curves | url=http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | series=Advanced Book Classics | isbn=978-0-201-51010-2 | year=1989}}, p. 109</ref>\n:<math>\\ell(D) \\leq \\frac{\\deg D}2+1.</math>\n\n== Generalizations of the Riemann–Roch theorem ==\nThe '''Riemann–Roch theorem for curves''' was proved for Riemann surfaces by Riemann and Roch in the 1850s and for algebraic curves by [[Friedrich Karl Schmidt]] in 1931 as he was working on [[perfect field]]s of [[Characteristic (algebra)|finite characteristic]]. Under the [http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~ci3/manu.html#RH hand of [[Peter Roquette]]]:\n<blockquote>The first main achievement of F. K. Schmidt is the discovery that the classical theorem of Riemann–Roch on compact Riemann surfaces can be transferred to function fields with finite base field. Actually, his proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem works for arbitrary perfect base fields, not necessarily finite.</blockquote>\nIt is foundational in the sense that the subsequent theory for curves tries to refine the information it yields (for example in the [[Brill–Noether theory]]).\n\nThere are versions in higher dimensions (for the appropriate notion of [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]], or [[line bundle]]). Their general formulation depends on splitting the theorem into two parts. One, which would now be called [[Serre duality]], interprets the ''ℓ''(''K''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''D'') term as a dimension of a first [[sheaf cohomology]] group; with ''ℓ''(''D'') the dimension of a zeroth cohomology group, or space of sections, the left-hand side of the theorem becomes an [[Euler characteristic]], and the right-hand side a computation of it as a ''degree'' corrected according to the topology of the Riemann surface.\n\nIn [[algebraic geometry]] of dimension two such a formula was found by the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry|geometers of the Italian school]]; a [[Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces]] was proved (there are several versions, with the first possibly being due to [[Max Noether]]). So matters rested before about 1950.\n\n:{{main article|Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces}}\n\nAn ''n''-dimensional generalisation, the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], was found and proved by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]], as an application of [[characteristic class]]es in [[algebraic topology]]; he was much influenced by the work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]]. At about the same time [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] was giving the general form of Serre duality, as we now know it.\n\n[[Alexander Grothendieck]] proved a far-reaching generalization in 1957, now known as the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]]. His work reinterprets Riemann–Roch not as a theorem about a variety, but about a morphism between two varieties. The details of the proofs were published by Borel & Serre in 1958.\n\nFinally a general version was found in [[algebraic topology]], too. These developments were essentially all carried out between 1950 and 1960. After that the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]] opened another route to generalization.\n\nWhat results is that the Euler characteristic (of a [[coherent sheaf]]) is something reasonably computable. If one is interested, as is usually the case, in just one summand within the alternating sum, further arguments such as [[vanishing theorem (disambiguation)|vanishing theorem]]s must be brought to bear.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* Borel, Armand & Serre, Jean-Pierre (1958), Le théorème de Riemann–Roch, d'après Grothendieck, Bull.S.M.F. 86 (1958), 97–136.\n* {{Citation | last1=Griffiths | first1=Phillip | author1-link=Phillip Griffiths | last2=Harris | first2=Joseph | author2-link=Joe Harris (mathematician) | title=Principles of algebraic geometry | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | series=Wiley Classics Library | isbn=978-0-471-05059-9 |mr=1288523 | year=1994 | doi=10.1002/9781118032527}}\n* Grothendieck, Alexander, et al.

      "text": "In mathematics, the '''Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces''' describes the dimension of linear systems on an [[algebraic surface]]. The classical form of it was first given by {{harvs|txt|last=Castelnuovo|year1=1896|year2=1897}}, after preliminary versions of it were found by {{harvtxt|Noether|1886}} and {{harvtxt|Enriques|1894}}. The [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]]-theoretic version is due to Hirzebruch.\n\n==Statement==\nOne form of the Riemann&ndash;Roch theorem states that if ''D'' is a divisor on a non-singular projective surface then\n:<math>\\chi(D) = \\chi(0) +\\tfrac{1}{2} D . (D - K) \\,</math>\n\nwhere &chi; is the [[sheaf theory|holomorphic Euler characteristic]], the dot . is the [[intersection number]], and ''K'' is the canonical divisor. The constant &chi;(0) is the holomorphic Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle, and is equal to 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''<sub>''a''</sub>, where ''p''<sub>''a''</sub> is the [[arithmetic genus]] of the surface. For comparison, the Riemann&ndash;Roch theorem for a curve states that&nbsp;&chi;(''D'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;&chi;(0)&nbsp;+&nbsp;deg(''D'').\n\n==Noether's formula==\n\n[[Max Noether|Noether's]] formula states that\n\n:<math>\\chi = \\frac{c_1^2+c_2}{12} = \\frac{(K.K)+e}{12}</math>\n\nwhere &chi;=&chi;(0) is the holomorphic Euler characteristic, ''c''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> =&nbsp;(''K''.''K'') is a [[Chern class#Chern number|Chern number]] and the self-intersection number of the canonical class ''K'', and ''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c''<sub>2</sub> is the topological Euler characteristic. It can be used to replace the \nterm &chi;(0) in the Riemann–Roch theorem with topological terms; this gives the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] for surfaces.\n\n==Relation to the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem==\nFor surfaces, the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] is essentially the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces combined with the Noether formula. To see this, recall that for each divisor ''D'' on a surface there is an [[invertible sheaf]] ''L'' = O(''D'') such that the linear system of ''D'' is more or less the space of sections of ''L''. \nFor surfaces the Todd class is <math>1 + c_1(X) / 2 + (c_1(X)^2 + c_2(X)) / 12</math>, and the Chern character of the sheaf ''L'' is just <math>1 + c_1(L) + c_1(L)^2 / 2</math>, so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem states that\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\chi(D) &= h^0(L) - h^1(L) + h^2(L)\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} c_1(L)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} c_1(L) \\, c_1(X) + \\frac{1}{12} \\left(c_1(X)^2 + c_2(X)\\right)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFortunately this can be written in a clearer form as follows. First putting ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 shows that\n\n: <math> \\chi(0) = \\frac{1}{12}\\left(c_1(X)^2 + c_2(X)\\right)</math> &nbsp; &nbsp; (Noether's formula)\n\nFor invertible sheaves (line bundles) the second Chern class vanishes. The products of second cohomology classes can be identified with intersection numbers in the [[Picard group]], and we get a more classical version of Riemann Roch for surfaces:\n\n: <math> \\chi(D) = \\chi(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(D.D - D.K) </math>\n\nIf we want, we can use [[Serre duality]] to express ''h''<sup>2</sup>(O(''D'')) as ''h''<sup>0</sup>(O(''K''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''D'')), but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the ''h''<sup>1</sup>(O(''D'')) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).\n\n==Early versions==\nThe earliest forms of the Riemann&ndash;Roch theorem for surfaces were often stated as an inequality rather than an equality, because there was no direct geometric description of first cohomology groups. \nA typical example is given by {{harvtxt|Zariski|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;78}}, which states that\n\n:<math>r\\ge n-\\pi+p_a+1-i</math>\n\nwhere\n*''r'' is the dimension of the complete linear system |''D''| of a divisor ''D'' (so ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''h''<sup>0</sup>(O(''D'')) &minus;1)\n*''n'' is the '''virtual degree''' of ''D'', given by the self-intersection number (''D''.''D'')\n*&pi; is the '''virtual genus''' of ''D'', equal to 1 + (D.D + K.D)/2\n*''p''<sub>''a''</sub> is the '''arithmetic genus''' &chi;(O<sub>''F''</sub>) &minus; 1 of the surface\n*''i'' is the '''index of speciality''' of ''D'', equal to dim ''H''<sup>0</sup>(O(''K''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''D'')) (which by Serre duality is the same as dim ''H''<sup>2</sup>(O(D))).\n\nThe difference between the two sides of this inequality was called the '''superabundance''' ''s''  of the divisor ''D''. \nComparing this inequality with the sheaf-theoretic version of the Riemann&ndash;Roch theorem shows that the superabundance of ''D'' is given by ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;dim ''H''<sup>1</sup>(O(''D'')). The divisor ''D'' was called '''regular''' if ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (or in other words if all higher cohomology groups of O(''D'') vanish)  and '''superabundant''' if&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.\n\n==References==\n* ''Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry'' by Friedrich Hirzebruch {{isbn|3-540-58663-6}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Zariski | first1=Oscar | author1-link=Oscar Zariski | title=Algebraic surfaces | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Classics in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-58658-6 |mr=1336146 | year=1995}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces}}\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:Algebraic surfaces]]\n[[Category:Topological methods of algebraic geometry]]"

This definition is closely related to the notion of a [[formally smooth]] morphism of schemes. If in addition the map between the tangent spaces of ''F'' and ''G'' is an isomorphism, then ''F'' is called a '''hull''' of ''G''.\n\n==Grothendieck's theorem==\n\n{{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1960|loc=proposition 3.1}} showed that a functor from the category ''C'' of [[Artinian algebra]]s to sets is pro-representable if and only if it preserves all finite limits. This condition is equivalent to asking that the functor preserves pullbacks and the final object. In fact Grothendieck's theorem applies not only to the category ''C'' of Artinian algebras, but to any category with finite limits whose objects are Artinian.\n\nBy taking the projective limit of the pro-representable functor in the larger category of linearly topologized local rings, one obtains a complete linearly topologized local ring representing the functor.\n\n==Schlessinger's representation theorem==\n\nOne difficulty in applying Grothendieck's theorem is that it can be hard to check that a functor preserves all pullbacks. Schlessinger showed that it is sufficient to check that the functor preserves pullbacks of a special form, which is often easier to check. Schlessinger's theorem also gives conditions under which the functor has a hull, even if it is not representable.\n\nSchessinger's theorem gives conditions for a set-valued functor ''F'' on ''C'' to be representable by a complete local Λ-algebra ''R'' with maximal ideal ''m'' such that ''R''/''m''<sup>''n''</sup> is in ''C'' for all ''n''.\n\nSchlessinger's theorem states that a functor from ''C'' to sets with ''F''(''k'') a 1-element set is representable by a complete Noetherian local algebra if it has the following properties, and has a hull if it has the first three properties:\n \n*H1: The map ''F''(''Y''×<sub>''X''</sub>''Z'')→''F''(''Y'')×<sub>''F''(''X'')</sub>''F''(''Z'') is surjective whenever ''Z''→''X'' is a small extension in ''C'' and ''Y''→''X'' is some morphism in ''C''.\n*H2: The map in H1 is a bijection whenever ''Z''→''X'' is the small extension ''k''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup>)→''k''.\n*H3: The tangent space of ''F'' is a finite-dimensional vector space over ''k''.\n*H4: The map in H1 is a bijection whenever ''Y''=''Z'' is a small extension of ''X'' and the maps from ''Y'' and ''Z'' to ''X'' are the same.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|last=Grothendieck|url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=SB_1958-1960__5__369_0 |title= Technique de descente et théorèmes d'existence en géométrie algébrique, II.

The theorem&mdash;also known as the Tarski–Seidenberg projection property&mdash;is named after [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Abraham Seidenberg]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Bhubaneswar |last=Mishra |authorlink=Bhubaneswar Mishra |title=Algorithmic Algebra |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1993 |isbn=0-387-94090-1 |pages=345–347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxKeyYBxmLMC&pg=PA345 }}</ref> It implies that [[quantifier elimination]] is possible over the reals, that is that every formula constructed from polynomial equations and inequalities by logical connectors ∨ (''or''), ∧ (''and''), ¬ (''not'') and quantifiers ∀ (''for all''), ∃ (''exists'') is equivalent to a similar formula without quantifiers. An important consequence is the [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]] of the theory of [[real-closed field]]s.\n\nAlthough the original proof of the theorem was constructive, the resulting algorithm has a [[analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] that is too high for using the method on a computer. [[George E. Collins]] introduced the algorithm of [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], which allows quantifier elimination over the reals in [[double exponential time]]. This complexity is optimal, as there are examples where the output has a double exponential number of connected components. This algorithm is therefore fundamental, and it is widely used in [[computational algebraic geometry]].\n\n==Statement==\n\nA [[semialgebraic set]] in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is a finite union of sets defined by a finite number of polynomial equations and inequalities, that is by a finite number of statements of the form\n:<math>p(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=0\\,</math>\nand\n:<math>q(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)>0\\,</math>\nfor polynomials ''p'' and ''q''.  We define a projection map ''π'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> by sending a point (''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n'',</sub>''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub>) to (''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Then the Tarski–Seidenberg theorem states that if ''X'' is a semialgebraic set in '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> for some ''n''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1, then ''π''(''X'') is a semialgebraic set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n==Failure with algebraic sets==\n\nIf we only define sets using polynomial equations and not inequalities then we define [[algebraic set]]s rather than ''semi''algebraic sets.  For these sets the theorem fails, i.e. projections of algebraic sets need not be algebraic.  As a simple example consider the [[hyperbola]] in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> defined by the equation\n:<math>xy-1=0.\\,</math>\nThis is a perfectly good algebraic set, but projecting it down by sending (''x'',''y'') in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to ''x'' in '''R''' produces the set of points satisfying {{math|''x'' ≠ 0}}.  This is a semialgebraic set, but it is not an algebraic set as the algebraic sets in '''R''' are '''R''' itself, the [[empty set]] and the finite sets.\n\nThis example shows also that, over the complex numbers, the projection of an algebraic set may be non-algebraic. Thus the existence of real algebraic sets with non-algebraic projections does not rely on the fact that the field of real numbers is not algebraically closed.\n\n==Relation to structures==\n\nThis result confirmed that semialgebraic sets in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> form what is now known as an [[o-minimal structure]] on '''R'''.  These are collections of subsets ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> for each ''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1 such that we can take finite unions and complements of the subsets in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> and the result will still be in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>, moreover the elements of ''S''<sub>1</sub> are simply finite unions of intervals and points.  The final condition for such a collection to be an o-minimal structure is that the projection map on the first ''n'' coordinates from '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> must send subsets in ''S''<sub>''n''+1</sub> to subsets in ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The Tarski–Seidenberg theorem tells us this holds if ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> is the set of semialgebraic sets in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | first=L. | last=van den Dries | title=Tame topology and o-minimal structures | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | volume=248 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1998 | zbl=0953.03045 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Khovanskii | first=A.G. | title=Fewnomials | others= Translated from the Russian by Smilka Zdravkovska | zbl=0728.12002 | series=Translations of Mathematical Monographs | volume=88 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-8218-4547-0 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Neyman |authorlink=Abraham Neyman |title=Stochastic Games and Applications |chapter=Real Algebraic Tools in Stochastic Games |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer |year=2003 |pages=57–75 |isbn=1-4020-1492-9 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCZrCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA57 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://planetmath.org/tarskiseidenbergtheorem Tarski–Seidenberg theorem] at PlanetMath.org\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarski-Seidenberg theorem}}\n[[Category:Real algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry]]"

This is the simplest and broadest of the \"Bertini theorems\" applying to a [[linear system of divisors]]; simplest because there is no restriction on the [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] of the underlying field, while the extensions require characteristic 0.<ref>{{Springer|id=B/b015770|title=Bertini theorems}}</ref><ref>Hartshorne, Ch. III.10.</ref>\n\n== Statement for hyperplane sections of smooth varieties==\nLet ''X'' be a smooth quasi-projective variety over an algebraically closed field, embedded in a  [[algebraic geometry of projective spaces|projective space]] <math>\\mathbf P^n</math>.\nLet <math>|H|</math> denote the [[linear system of divisors|complete system]] of hyperplane divisors in <math>\\mathbf P^n</math>. Recall that it is the [[Duality (projective geometry)#Higher dimensional duality|dual space]] <math>(\\mathbf P^n)^{\\star}</math> of <math>\\mathbf P^n</math> and is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbf P^n</math>.\n\nThe theorem of Bertini states that the set of hyperplanes not containing ''X'' and with smooth intersection with ''X'' contains an open dense subset of the total system of divisors <math>|H|</math>. The set itself is open if ''X'' is projective. If dim(''X'')&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2, then these intersections (called hyperplane sections of ''X'') are connected, hence irreducible.\n\nThe theorem hence asserts that a ''general'' hyperplane section not equal to ''X'' is smooth, that is: the property of smoothness is generic.\n\nOver an arbitrary field ''k'', there is a dense open subset of the dual space <math>(\\mathbf P^n)^{\\star}</math> whose [[rational point]]s define hyperplanes smooth hyperplane sections of ''X''. When ''k'' is infinite, this open subset then has infinitely many rational points and there are infinitely many smooth hyperplane sections in ''X''.\n\nOver a finite field, the above open subset may not contain rational points and in general there is no hyperplanes  with smooth intersection with ''X''. However, if we take hypersurfaces of sufficientely big degrees, then the theorem of Bertini holds.<ref>Bjorn Poonen: [http://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/bertini.pdf ''Bertini Theorems over finite fields''], Ann. of Math.

This property fails in positive characteristics.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThe theorem of Bertini has been generalized in various ways. For example, a result due to [[Steven Kleiman]] asserts the following (cf. [[Kleiman's theorem]]): for a connected [[algebraic group]] ''G'', and any [[homogeneous variety|homogeneous ''G''-variety]] ''X'', and two varieties ''Y'' and ''Z'' mapping to ''X'', let ''Y''<sup>&sigma;</sup> be the variety obtained by letting &sigma; &isin; ''G'' act on ''Y''. Then, there is an open dense subscheme ''H'' of ''G'' such that for &sigma; &isin; ''H'', <math>Y^\\sigma \\times_X Z</math> is either empty or purely of the (expected) [[Krull dimension|dimension]] dim ''Y'' + dim ''Z'' &minus; dim ''X''. If, in addition, ''Y'' and ''Z'' are [[smooth scheme|smooth]] and the base field has characteristic zero, then ''H'' may be taken such that  <math>Y^\\sigma \\times_X Z</math> is smooth for all <math>\\sigma \\in H</math>, as well. The above theorem of Bertini is the special case where <math>X = \\mathbb P^n</math> is expressed as the quotient of SL<sub>''n''</sub> by the [[parabolic subgroup]] of upper triangular matrices, ''Z'' is a subvariety and ''Y'' is a hyperplane.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Kleiman | first1=Steven L. | author1-link=Steven Kleiman | title=The transversality of a general translate | year=1974 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=28 | pages=287–297}}</ref>\n\nTheorem of Bertini has also been generalized to discrete valuation domains or finite fields, or for étale coverings of ''X''.\n\nThe theorem is often used for induction steps.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Hartshorne AG}}\n*[https://arxiv.org/pdf/alg-geom/9704018v1 Bertini and his two fundamental theorems] by Steven L.

      "text": "In algebraic geometry, '''Zariski's main theorem''', proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Oscar Zariski|first=Oscar |last=Zariski|year=1943}}, is a statement about the structure of birational morphisms stating roughly that there is only one branch at any normal point of a variety. It is the special case of [[Zariski's connectedness theorem]] when the two varieties are birational.\n\nZariski's main theorem can be stated in several ways which at first sight seem to be quite different, but are in fact deeply related. Some of the variations that have been called Zariski's main theorem are as follows:\n*The total transform of a normal fundamental point of a birational map has positive dimension. This is essentially Zariski's original form of his main theorem.\n*A birational morphism with finite fibers to a normal variety is an isomorphism to an open subset. \n*The total transform of a normal point under a proper birational morphism is connected. \n*A closely related theorem of Grothendieck describes the structure of [[quasi-finite morphism]]s of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which implies Zariski's original main theorem.\n*Several results in commutative algebra that imply the geometric form of Zariski's main theorem.\n*A normal local ring is [[unibranch]], which is a variation of the statement that the transform of a normal point is connected. \n*The local ring of a normal point of a variety is [[analytically normal]]. This is a strong form of the statement that it is unibranch.\n\nThe name \"Zariski's main theorem\" comes from the fact that Zariski labelled it as the \"MAIN THEOREM\" in  {{harvs|txt=yes|last=Zariski|year1=1943}}.\n\n==Zariski's main theorem for birational morphisms==\n\nLet ''f'' be a birational mapping of algebraic varieties ''V'' and ''W''. Recall that ''f'' is defined by a closed subvariety <math>\\Gamma \\subset V \\times W</math> (a \"graph\" of ''f'') such that the projection on the first factor <math>p_1</math> induces an isomorphism between an open <math>U \\subset V</math> and <math>p_1^{-1}(U)</math>, and such that <math>p_2 \\circ p_1^{-1}</math> is an isomorphism on ''U'' too. The complement of ''U'' in ''V'' is called a ''fundamental variety'' or ''indeterminancy locus'', and an image of a subset of ''V'' under <math>p_2 \\circ p_1^{-1}</math> is called a ''total transform'' of it.\n\nThe original statement of the  theorem in  {{harv|Zariski|1943|p=522}} reads:\n:MAIN THEOREM: If ''W'' is an irreducible fundamental variety on ''V'' of a birational correspondence ''T'' between ''V'' and ''V''&prime; and if ''T'' has no fundamental elements on ''V''&prime; then — under the assumption that ''V'' is locally normal at ''W'' — each irreducible component of the transform ''T''[''W''] is of higher dimension than ''W''.\nHere ''T'' is essentially a morphism from ''V''&prime; to ''V'' that is birational, ''W'' is a subvariety of the set where the inverse of ''T'' is not defined whose local ring is normal, and the transform ''T''[''W''] means the inverse image of ''W'' under the morphism from ''V''&prime; to ''V''.\n\nHere are some variants of this theorem stated using more recent terminology. {{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Corollary III.11.4}} calls the following connectedness statement \"Zariski's Main theorem\":\n:If ''f'':''X''&rarr;''Y'' is a birational projective morphism between noetherian integral schemes,  then the inverse image of every normal point of ''Y'' is connected.\nThe following consequence of it (Theorem V.5.2,''loc.cit.'') also goes under this name:\n:If ''f'':''X''&rarr;''Y'' is a birational transformation of projective varieties with ''Y'' normal, then the total transform of a fundamental point of ''f'' is connected and of dimension at least 1.\n\n===Examples===\n\n*Suppose that ''V'' is a smooth variety of dimension greater than 1 and ''V''&prime; is given by blowing up a point ''W'' on ''V''. Then ''V'' is normal at ''W'', and the component of the transform of ''W'' is a projective space, which has dimension greater than ''W'' as predicted by Zariski's original form of his main theorem.\n*In the previous example the transform of ''W'' was irreducible. It is easy to find examples where the total transform is reducible by blowing up other points on the transform. For example, if ''V''&prime; is given by blowing up a point ''W'' on ''V'' and then blowing up another point on this transform, the total transform of ''W'' has 2 irreducible components meeting at a point. As predicted by Hartshorne's form of the main theorem, the total transform is connected and of dimension at least 1.\n*For an example where ''W'' is not normal and the conclusion of the main theorem fails, take ''V''&prime; to be a smooth variety, and take ''V'' to be given by identifying two distinct points on ''V''&prime;, and take ''W'' to be the image of these two points. Then ''W'' is not normal, and the transform of ''W'' consists of two points, which is not connected and does not have positive dimension.\n\n==Zariski's main theorem for quasifinite morphisms==\n\nIn EGA III, Grothendieck calls the following statement which does not involve connectedness a \"Main theorem\"  of Zariski {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1961|loc=Théorème 4.4.3}}:\n:If ''f'':''X''&rarr;''Y'' is a quasi-projective morphism of Noetherian schemes then the set of points that are isolated in their fiber is open in ''X''. Moreover the induced scheme  of this set is isomorphic to  an open subset of a scheme that is finite over ''Y''.\n\nIn EGA IV, Grothendieck observed that the last statement could be deduced from a more general theorem about the structure of [[quasi-finite morphism]]s, and the latter is often referred to as the \"Zariski's main theorem in the form of Grothendieck\".\nIt is well known that  [[open immersion]]s and [[finite morphism]]s are quasi-finite. Grothendieck proved that under the hypothesis of separatedness all quasi-finite morphisms are compositions of such {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1966|loc=Théorème 8.12.6}}:\n:if ''Y'' is a [[quasi-compact]] separated scheme and <math>f: X \\to  Y</math> is a [[separated morphism|separated]], quasi-finite, finitely presented morphism  then there is a factorization into <math>X \\to Z \\to Y</math>, where the first map is an open immersion and the second one is finite.\n\nThe relation between this theorem about quasi-finite morphisms and Théorème 4.4.3 of EGA III quoted above is that \nif ''f'':''X''→''Y'' is a projective morphism of varieties, then the set of points that are isolated in their fiber is quasifinite over ''Y''. Then structure theorem for quasi-finite morphisms applies and yields the desired result.\n\n==Zariski's main theorem for commutative rings==\n{{harvtxt|Zariski|1949}} reformulated his main theorem in terms of commutative algebra as a statement about local rings. {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1961|loc=Théorème 4.4.7}} generalized Zariski's formulation as follows: \n:If ''B'' is an algebra of finite type over a local Noetherian ring ''A'', and ''n'' is a maximal ideal of ''B'' which is minimal among ideals of ''B'' whose  inverse image in ''A'' is the maximal ideal ''m'' of ''A'', then there is a finite ''A''-algebra ''A''&prime; with a maximal ideal ''m''&prime; (whose inverse image in ''A'' is ''m'') such that the localization ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> is isomorphic to the ''A''-algebra ''A''&prime;<sub>''m''&prime;</sub>.\nIf in addition ''A'' and ''B'' are integral and have the same field of fractions, and ''A'' is integrally closed, then this theorem implies that ''A'' and ''B'' are equal. This is essentially Zariski's formulation of his main theorem in terms of commutative rings.\n\n==Zariski's main theorem: topological form==\n\nA topological version of Zariski's main theorem says that if ''x'' is a (closed) point of a normal complex variety it is [[unibranch]]; in other words there are arbitrarily small neighborhoods ''U'' of ''x'' such that the set of non-singular points of ''U'' is connected {{harv|Mumford|1999|loc=III.9}}.\n\nThe property of being normal is stronger than the property of being unibranch: for example, a cusp of a plane curve is unibranch but not normal.\n\n==Zariski's main theorem: power series form==\n\nA formal power series version of Zariski's main theorem says that if ''x'' is a normal  point of a variety then it is [[analytically normal]]; in other words the completion of the local ring at ''x'' is a normal integral domain {{harv|Mumford|1999|loc=III.9}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Deligne's connectedness theorem]]\n* [[Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem]]\n* [[Grothendieck's connectedness theorem]]\n* [[Stein factorization]]\n* [[Theorem on formal functions]]\n\n==References==\n*{{springer|title=Zariski theorem|id=Z/z099130|first=V.I. |last=Danilov}}\n*{{citation\n | last = Grothendieck\n | first = Alexandre\n | authorlink = Alexandre Grothendieck\n | year = 1961\n | title = Eléments de géométrie algébrique (rédigés avec la collaboration de Jean Dieudonné) : III.

Suppose that for any [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] ''v'', ''A'' splits over the corresponding local field ''K''<sub>''v''</sub>:\n\n: <math> A\\otimes_K K_v \\simeq M_d(K_v). </math>\n\nThen ''A'' is isomorphic to the matrix algebra ''M''<sub>''d''</sub>(''K'').\n\n== Applications ==\n\nUsing the theory of [[Brauer group]], one shows that two central simple algebras ''A'' and ''B'' over an algebraic number field ''K'' are isomorphic over ''K'' if and only if their completions ''A''<sub>''v''</sub> and ''B''<sub>''v''</sub> are isomorphic over the completion ''K''<sub>''v''</sub> for every ''v''.\n\nTogether with the [[Grunwald–Wang theorem]], the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem implies that every central simple algebra over an algebraic number field is ''cyclic'', i.e. can be obtained by an explicit construction from a [[cyclic extension|cyclic field extension]] ''L''/''K'' .\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Class field theory]]\n* [[Hasse norm theorem]]\n\n==References==\n\n* {{citation | author1-link=Abraham Adrian Albert | first1=A.A. | last1=Albert | author2-link=Helmut Hasse | first2=H. | last2=Hasse | title=A determination of all normal division algebras over an algebraic number field | journal=Trans.

      "text": "'''Chebotarev's density theorem''' in [[algebraic number theory]] describes statistically the splitting of [[prime number|primes]] in a given [[Galois extension]] ''K'' of the field <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> of [[rational number]]s. Generally speaking, a prime integer will factor into several [[Ideal number|ideal primes]] in the ring of [[algebraic integer]]s of ''K''. There are only finitely many patterns of splitting that may occur. Although the full description of the splitting of every prime ''p'' in a general Galois extension is a major unsolved problem, the Chebotarev density theorem says that the frequency of the occurrence of a given pattern, for all primes ''p'' less than a large integer ''N'', tends to a certain limit as ''N'' goes to infinity.  It was proved by [[Nikolai Chebotaryov]] in his thesis in 1922, published in {{harv|Tschebotareff|1926}}.\n\nA special case that is easier to state says that if ''K'' is an [[algebraic number field]] which is a Galois extension of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> of degree ''n'', then the prime numbers that completely split in ''K'' have density \n\n:1/''n''\n\namong all primes. More generally, splitting behavior can be specified by assigning to (almost) every prime number an invariant, its [[Frobenius element]], which is a representative of a well-defined [[conjugacy class]] in the [[Galois group]] \n\n:''Gal''(''K''/''Q'').\n\nThen the theorem says that the asymptotic distribution of these invariants is uniform over the group, so that a conjugacy class with ''k'' elements occurs with frequency asymptotic to \n\n:''k''/''n''.\n\n== History and motivation ==\n\nWhen [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] first introduced the notion of [[gaussian integer|complex integers]] ''Z''[''i''], he observed that the ordinary prime numbers may factor further in this new set of integers.  In fact, if a prime ''p'' is congruent to 1 mod 4, then it factors into a product of two distinct prime gaussian integers, or \"splits completely\"; if ''p'' is congruent to 3 mod 4, then it remains prime, or is \"inert\"; and if ''p'' is 2 then it becomes a product of the square of the prime ''(1+i)'' and the invertible gaussian integer ''-i''; we say that 2 \"ramifies\". For instance, \n\n: <math> 5 = (1 + 2i)(1-2i) </math> splits completely;\n: <math> 3 </math> is inert;\n: <math> 2 = -i(1+i)^2 </math> ramifies.\n\nFrom this description, it appears that as one considers larger and larger primes, the frequency of a prime splitting completely approaches 1/2, and likewise for the primes that remain primes in ''Z''[''i'']. [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] demonstrates that this is indeed the case. Even though the prime numbers themselves appear rather erratically, splitting of the primes in the extension \n\n: <math> \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}[i] </math>\n\nfollows a simple statistical law.\n\nSimilar statistical laws also hold for splitting of primes in the [[cyclotomic field|cyclotomic extensions]], obtained from the field of rational numbers by adjoining a primitive root of unity of a given order. For example, the ordinary integer primes group into four classes, each with probability 1/4, according to their pattern of splitting in the ring of integers corresponding to the 8th roots of unity. \nIn this case, the field extension has degree 4 and is [[abelian extension|abelian]], with the Galois group isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]]. It turned out that the Galois group of the extension plays a key role in the pattern of splitting of primes. [[Georg Frobenius]] established the framework for investigating this pattern and proved a special case of the theorem. The general statement was proved by [[Nikolai Grigoryevich Chebotaryov]] in 1922.\n\n== Relation with Dirichlet's theorem ==\n\nThe Chebotarev density theorem may be viewed as a generalisation of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]]. A quantitative form of Dirichlet's theorem states that if ''N''≥''2'' is an integer and ''a'' is [[coprime]] to ''N'', then the proportion of the primes ''p'' congruent to ''a'' mod ''N'' is asymptotic to 1/''n'', where ''n''=φ(''N'') is the [[Euler totient function]]. This is a special case of the Chebotarev density theorem for the ''N''th [[cyclotomic field]] ''K''. Indeed, the Galois group of ''K''/''Q'' is abelian and can be canonically identified with the group of invertible residue classes mod ''N''. The splitting invariant of a prime ''p'' not dividing ''N'' is simply its residue class because the number of distinct primes into which ''p'' splits is φ(''N'')/m, where m is multiplicative order of ''p'' modulo ''N;'' hence by the Chebotarev density theorem, primes are asymptotically uniformly distributed among different residue classes coprime to ''N''.\n\n==Formulation==\n\nIn their survey article, {{harvtxt|Lenstra|Stevenhagen|1996}} give an earlier result of Frobenius in this area. Suppose ''K'' is a [[Galois extension]] of the [[rational number field]] '''Q''', and ''P''(''t'') a monic integer polynomial such that ''K'' is a [[splitting field]] of ''P''. It makes sense to factorise ''P'' modulo a prime number ''p''. Its 'splitting type' is the list of degrees of irreducible factors of ''P'' mod ''p'', i.e. ''P'' factorizes in some fashion over the [[prime field]] '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. If ''n'' is the degree of ''P'', then the splitting type is a [[partition of an integer|partition]] Π of ''n''. Considering also the [[Galois group]] ''G'' of ''K'' over '''Q''', each ''g'' in ''G'' is a permutation of the roots of ''P'' in ''K''; in other words by choosing an ordering of α and its [[algebraic conjugate]]s, ''G'' is faithfully represented as a subgroup of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>. We can write ''g'' by means of its [[cycle representation]], which gives a 'cycle type' ''c''(''g''), again a partition of ''n''.\n\nThe ''theorem of Frobenius'' states that for any given choice of Π the primes ''p'' for which the splitting type of ''P'' mod ''p'' is Π has a [[natural density]] δ, with δ equal to the proportion of ''g'' in ''G'' that have cycle type Π.\n\nThe statement of the more general ''Chebotarev theorem'' is in terms of the [[Frobenius element]] of a prime (ideal), which is in fact an associated [[conjugacy class]] ''C'' of elements of the [[Galois group]] ''G''. If we fix ''C'' then the theorem says that asymptotically a proportion |''C''|/|''G''| of primes have associated Frobenius element as ''C''. When ''G'' is abelian the classes of course each have size 1. For the case of a non-abelian group of order 6 they have size 1, 2 and 3, and there are correspondingly (for example) 50% of primes ''p'' that have an order 2 element as their Frobenius. So these primes have residue degree 2, so they split into exactly three prime ideals in a degree 6 extension of ''Q'' with it as Galois group.<ref>This particular example already follows from the Frobenius result, because ''G'' is a symmetric group. In general, conjugacy in ''G'' is more demanding than having the same cycle type.</ref>\n\n==Statement==\nLet ''L'' be a finite Galois extension of a number field ''K'' with Galois group ''G''. Let ''X'' be a subset of ''G'' that is stable under conjugation.

In this case, the Galois group ''G'' of ''L'' / ''K'' is a profinite group equipped with the Krull topology. Since ''G'' is compact in this topology, there is a unique Haar measure μ on ''G''. For every prime ''v'' of ''K'' not in ''S'' there is an associated Frobenius conjugacy class ''F''<sub>v</sub>. The Chebotarev density theorem in this situation can be stated as follows:<ref name=\"Section\" />\n\n:Let ''X'' be a subset of ''G'' that is stable under conjugation and whose boundary has Haar measure zero. Then, the set of primes ''v'' of ''K'' not in ''S'' such that ''F''<sub>v</sub> ⊆ X has density\n::<math>\\frac{\\mu(X)}{\\mu(G)}.</math>\n\nThis reduces to the finite case when ''L'' / ''K'' is finite (the Haar measure is then just the counting measure).\n\nA consequence of this version of the theorem is that the Frobenius elements of the unramified primes of ''L'' are dense in ''G''.\n\n==Important consequences==\nThe Chebotarev density theorem reduces the problem of classifying Galois extensions of a number field to that of describing the splitting of primes in extensions. Specifically, it implies that as a Galois extension of ''K'', ''L'' is uniquely determined by the set of primes of ''K'' that split completely in it.<ref>Corollary VII.13.10 of Neukirch</ref> A related corollary is that if almost all prime ideals of ''K'' split completely in ''L'', then in fact ''L'' = ''K''.<ref>Corollary VII.13.7 of Neukirch</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n*{{citation|mr=1395088\n|    last2= Stevenhagen|first2= P. |last1= Lenstra|first1= H.

This characterisation of {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} is based on the idea that there will be as many ways to embed {{mvar|K}} in the [[complex number]] field as the degree {{math|''n'' {{=}} [''K'' : ℚ]}}; these will either be into the [[real number]]s, or pairs of embeddings related by [[complex conjugation]], so that\n\n:{{math|''n'' {{=}} ''r''<sub>1</sub> + 2''r''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nNote that if {{mvar|K}} is Galois over {{math|ℚ}} then either {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}}=0 or {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}}=0.\n\nOther ways of determining {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} are\n\n* use the [[Primitive element (field theory)|primitive element]] theorem to write {{math|''K'' {{=}} ℚ(''α'')}}, and then {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} is the number of [[conjugate element (field theory)|conjugates]] of {{mvar|α}} that are real, {{math|2''r''<sub>2</sub>}} the number that are complex; in other words, if {{mvar|''f''}} is the minimal polynomial of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|ℚ}}, then {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} is the number of real roots and {{math|''2r''<sub>2</sub>}} is the number of non-real complex roots of {{mvar|''f''}} (which come in complex conjugate pairs);\n* write the [[tensor product of fields]] {{math|''K'' ⊗<sub>ℚ</sub> ℝ}} as a product of fields, there being {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} copies of {{math|ℝ}} and {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} copies of {{math|ℂ}}.\n\nAs an example, if {{mvar|K}} is a [[quadratic field]], the rank is 1 if it is a real quadratic field, and 0 if an imaginary quadratic field. The theory for real quadratic fields is essentially the theory of [[Pell's equation]].\n\nThe rank is positive for all number fields besides {{math|ℚ}} and imaginary quadratic fields, which have rank 0. The 'size' of the units is measured in general by a [[determinant]] called the regulator. In principle a basis for the units can be effectively computed; in practice the calculations are quite involved when {{mvar|n}} is large.\n\nThe torsion in the group of units is the set of all roots of unity of {{mvar|K}}, which form a finite [[cyclic group]]. For a number field with at least one real embedding the torsion must therefore be only {{math|{1,−1}|}}. There are number fields, for example most [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, having no real embeddings which also have {{math|{1,−1}|}} for the torsion of its unit group.\n\nTotally real fields are special with respect to units. If {{math|''L''/''K''}} is a finite extension of number fields with degree greater than 1 and\nthe units groups for the integers of {{mvar|L}} and {{mvar|K}} have the same rank then {{mvar|K}} is totally real and {{mvar|L}} is a totally complex quadratic extension. The converse holds too. (An example is {{mvar|K}} equal to the rationals and {{mvar|L}} equal to an imaginary quadratic field; both have unit rank 0.)\n\nThe theorem not only applies to the maximal order {{mvar|O<sub>K</sub>}} but to any order {{math|''O'' ⊂ ''O<sub>K</sub>}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Number Rings|first=P.|last=Stevenhagen|year=2012|url=http://websites.math.leidenuniv.nl/algebra/ant.pdf|page=57}}</ref>\n\nThere is a generalisation of the unit theorem by [[Helmut Hasse]] (and later [[Claude Chevalley]]) to describe the structure of the group of ''[[S-unit|{{mvar|S}}-unit]]s'', determining the rank of the unit group in [[localization of a ring|localizations]] of rings of integers. Also, the [[Galois module]] structure of {{math|ℚ ⊕ ''O''<sub>''K'',''S''</sub> ⊗<sub>ℤ</sub> ℚ}} has been determined.{{sfn|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2000|loc=proposition VIII.8.6.11}}\n\n==The regulator==\n\nSuppose that {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>,...,''u''<sub>''r''</sub>}} are a set of generators for the unit group modulo roots of unity. If {{math|''u''}} is an algebraic number, write {{math|''u''<sup>1</sup>, ..., ''u''<sup>''r'' + 1</sup>}} for the different embeddings into {{math|ℝ}} or {{math|ℂ}}, and set {{math|''N''<sub>''j''</sub>}} to 1 or 2 if the corresponding embedding is real or complex respectively. Then the {{math|''r'' × (''r'' + 1)}} matrix whose entries are {{math|''N<sub>j</sub>'' log{{abs|''u{{su|b=i|p=&thinsp;j}}''}}}}, {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''r'',}} {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''r'' + 1,}} has the property that the sum of any row is zero (because all units have norm 1, and the log of the norm is the sum of the entries in a row). This implies that the absolute value {{mvar|R}} of the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting one column is independent of the column. The number {{mvar|R}} is called the '''regulator''' of the algebraic number field (it does not depend on the choice of generators {{math|''u''<sub>''i''</sub>}}). It measures the \"density\" of the units: if the regulator is small, this means that there are \"lots\" of units.\n\nThe regulator has the following geometric interpretation. The map taking a unit {{mvar|u}} to the vector with entries {{math|''N<sub>j</sub>'' log{{abs|''u&thinsp;<sup>j</sup>''}}}} has an image in the {{mvar|r}}-dimensional subspace of {{math|ℝ<sup>''r'' + 1</sup>}} consisting of all vectors whose entries have sum 0, and by Dirichlet's unit theorem the image is a lattice in this subspace. The volume of a fundamental domain of this lattice is {{math|''R''{{sqrt|''r'' + 1}}}}.\n\nThe regulator of an algebraic number field of degree greater than 2 is usually quite cumbersome to calculate, though there are now computer algebra packages that can do it in many cases. It is usually much easier to calculate the product {{mvar|hR}} of the [[class number (number theory)|class number]] {{mvar|h}} and the regulator using the [[class number formula]], and the main difficulty in calculating the class number of an algebraic number field is usually the calculation of the regulator.\n\n===Examples===\n[[Image:Discriminant49CubicFieldFundamentalDomainOfUnits.png|thumb|300px|right|A fundamental domain in logarithmic space of the group of units of the cyclic cubic field {{mvar|K}} obtained by adjoining to {{math|ℚ}} a root of {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> − 2''x'' − 1}}. If {{mvar|α}} denotes a root of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, then a set of fundamental units is {{math|{''ε''<sub>1</sub>, ''ε''<sub>2</sub>}|}}, where {{math|''ε''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''α''<sup>2</sup> + ''α'' − 1}} and {{math|''ε''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 2 − ''α''<sup>2</sup>}}. The area of the fundamental domain is approximately 0.910114, so the regulator of {{mvar|K}} is approximately 0.525455.]]\n*The regulator of an [[imaginary quadratic field]], or of the rational integers, is 1 (as the determinant of a 0&nbsp;×&nbsp;0 matrix is 1).\n*The regulator of a [[real quadratic field]] is the logarithm of its [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]]: for example, that of {{math|ℚ({{sqrt|5}})}} is {{math|log {{sfrac|{{sqrt|5}} + 1|2}}}}. This can be seen as follows. A fundamental unit is {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|5}} + 1|2}}}}, and its images under the two embeddings into {{math|ℝ}} are {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|5}} + 1|2}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|−{{sqrt|5}} + 1|2}}}}. So the {{math|''r'' × (''r'' + 1)}} matrix is\n\n::<math>\\left[1\\times\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\right|, \\quad 1\\times \\log\\left|\\frac{-\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\right|\\ \\right].</math>\n\n*The regulator of the [[cyclic cubic field]] {{math|ℚ(''α'')}}, where {{mvar|α}} is a root of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> − 2''x'' − 1}}, is approximately 0.5255. A basis of the group of units modulo roots of unity is {{math|{''ε''<sub>1</sub>, ''ε''<sub>2</sub>}|}} where {{math|''ε''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''α''<sup>2</sup> + ''α'' − 1}} and {{math|''ε''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 2 − ''α''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohen|1993|loc=Table B.4}}</ref>\n\n==Higher regulators==\n\nA 'higher' regulator refers to a construction for a function on an [[algebraic K-group|algebraic {{mvar|K}}-group]] with index {{math|''n'' > 1}} that plays the same role as the classical regulator does for the group of units, which is a group {{math|''K''<sub>1</sub>}}. A theory of such regulators has been in development, with work of [[Armand Borel]] and others. Such higher regulators play a role, for example, in the [[Beilinson conjectures]], and are expected to occur in evaluations of certain [[L-function|{{mvar|L}}-function]]s at integer values of the argument.<ref name=Bloch>{{cite book | last=Bloch | first=Spencer J. | authorlink=Spencer Bloch | title=Higher regulators, algebraic {{mvar|K}}-theory, and zeta functions of elliptic curves | series=CRM Monograph Series | volume=11 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-8218-2114-8 | zbl=0958.19001 }}</ref> See also [[Beilinson regulator]].\n\n==Stark regulator==\nThe formulation of [[Stark's conjectures]] led [[Harold Stark]] to define what is now called the '''Stark regulator''', similar to the classical regulator as a determinant of logarithms of units, attached to any [[Artin representation]].<ref>{{cite report|title=A Report on Artin’s holomorphy conjecture| first=Dipendra| last=Prasad| first2=C.

For example, a [[rational number]] is a square of a rational number if it is a square of a [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]] for almost all primes ''p''. The Grunwald–Wang theorem is an example of a [[local-global principle]].\n\nIt was introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Wilhelm Grunwald|first=Wilhelm|last=Grunwald|year=1933}}, but there was a mistake in this original version that was found and corrected by {{harvs|txt|last=Wang|first=Shianghao|authorlink=Shianghao Wang|year=1948}}. The theorem considered by Grunwald and Wang was more general than the one stated above as they discussed the existence of cyclic extensions with certain local properties, and the statement about ''n''th powers is a consequence of this.\n\n== History ==\n{{quotebox|align=right|width=30%|quote=Some days later I was with [[Emil Artin|Artin]] in his office when Wang appeared. He said he had a counterexample to a lemma which had been used in the proof. An hour or two later, he produced a counterexample to the theorem itself... Of course he [Artin] was astonished, as were all of us students, that a famous theorem with two published proofs, one of which we had all heard in the seminar without our noticing anything, could be wrong. \n|source=[[John Tate]], quoted by  {{harvs|txt|last=Roquette|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Roquette|year=2005|loc=p.30}}\n}}\n{{harvtxt|Grunwald|1933}}, a student of [[Helmut Hasse]], gave an incorrect proof of the erroneous statement that an element in a number field is an ''n''th power if it is an ''n''th power locally almost everywhere. {{harvs|txt|first=George|last=Whaples|year=1942}} gave another incorrect proof of this incorrect statement. However {{harvtxt|Wang|1948}} discovered the following counter-example: 16 is a ''p''-adic 8th power for all odd primes ''p'', but is not a rational or 2-adic 8th power. In his doctoral thesis {{harvtxt|Wang|1950}} written under [[Emil Artin]], Wang gave and proved the correct formulation of Grunwald's assertion, by describing the rare cases when it fails. This result is what is now known as the Grunwald–Wang theorem. The history of Wang's counterexample is discussed by {{harvs|txt|last=Roquette|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Roquette|year=2005|loc=section 5.3}}\n\n== Wang's counter-example ==\n\nGrunwald's original claim that an element that is an ''n''th power almost everywhere locally is an ''n''th power globally can fail in two distinct ways: the element can be an ''n''th power almost everywhere locally but not everywhere locally, or it can be an ''n''th power everywhere locally but not globally.\n\n===An element that is an ''n''th power almost everywhere locally but not everywhere locally===\n\nThe element 16 in the rationals is an 8th power at all places except 2, but is not an 8th power in the 2-adic numbers.\n\nIt is clear that 16 is not a 2-adic 8th power, and hence not a rational 8th power, since the 2-adic valuation of 16 is 4 which is not divisible by 8.\n\nGenerally, 16 is an 8th power in a field ''K'' if and only if the polynomial <math>X^8-16</math> has a root in ''K''. Write\n\n:<math>X^8-16=(X^4-4)(X^4+4)=(X^2-2)(X^2+2)(X^2-2X+2)(X^2+2X+2).</math>\n\nThus, 16 is an 8th power in ''K'' if and only if 2, &minus;2 or &minus;1 is a square in ''K''. Let ''p'' be any odd prime. It follows from the multiplicativity of the [[Legendre symbol]] that 2, &minus;2 or &minus;1 is a square modulo ''p''. Hence, by [[Hensel's lemma]], 2, &minus;2 or &minus;1 is a square in <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p</math>.\n\n===An element that is an ''n''th power everywhere locally but not globally===\n\n16 is not an 8th power in <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{7})</math> although it is an 8th power locally everywhere (i.e. in <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\sqrt{7})</math> for all ''p''). This follows from the above and the equality <math>\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{7})=\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{-1})</math>.\n\n== A consequence of Wang's counterexample ==\n\nWang's counterexample has the following interesting consequence showing that one cannot always find a cyclic Galois extension of a given degree of a number field in which finitely many given prime places split in a specified way:\n\nThere exists no cyclic degree 8 extension <math>K/\\mathbb{Q}</math> in which the prime 2 is totally inert (i.e., such that <math>K_2/\\mathbb{Q}_2</math> is unramified of degree 8).\n\n== Special fields ==\n\nFor any <math>s\\geq 2</math> let\n\n:<math>\\eta_s:=\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{2^s}\\right)+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi i}{2^s}\\right)=2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^s}\\right).</math>\n\nNote that the <math>2^s</math>th [[cyclotomic field]] is\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{Q}_{2^s}=\\mathbb{Q}(i,\\eta_s).</math>\n\nA field is called ''s-special'' if it contains <math>\\eta_{s}</math>, but neither <math>i</math>, <math>\\eta_{s+1}</math> nor <math>i\\eta_{s+1}</math>.\n\n== Statement of the theorem ==\n\nConsider a number field ''K'' and a natural number ''n''. Let ''S'' be a finite (possibly empty) set of primes of ''K'' and put\n\n:<math>K(n,S):=\\{x\\in K\\mid x\\in K_{\\mathfrak{p}}^n \\mathrm{\\ for\\ all\\ }\\mathfrak{p}\\not\\in S\\}.</math>\n\nThe Grunwald–Wang theorem says that\n\n:<math>K(n,S)=K^n</math>\n\nunless we are in the ''special case'' which occurs when the following two conditions both hold:\n\n# <math>K</math> is ''s''-special with an <math>s</math> such that <math>2^{s+1}</math> divides ''n''.\n# <math>S</math> contains the ''special set'' <math>S_0</math> consisting of those (necessarily 2-adic) primes <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> such that <math>K_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> is ''s''-special.\n\nIn the special case the failure of the Hasse principle is finite of order 2: the kernel of\n\n: <math>K^\\times/K^{\\times n} \\to \\prod_{\\mathfrak{p}\\not\\in S}K_\\mathfrak{p}^\\times/K_\\mathfrak{p}^{\\times n}</math>\n\nis '''Z'''/2'''Z''', generated by the element η{{su|p=''n''|b=''s''+1}}.\n\n== Explanation of Wang's counter-example ==\n\nThe field of rational numbers <math>K=\\mathbb{Q}</math> is 2-special since it contains <math>\\eta_2=0</math>, but neither <math>i</math>, <math>\\eta_3=\\sqrt{2}</math> nor <math>i\\eta_3=\\sqrt{-2}</math>. The special set is <math>S_0=\\{2\\}</math>. Thus, the special case in the Grunwald–Wang theorem occurs when ''n'' is divisible by 8, and ''S'' contains 2. This explains Wang's counter-example and shows that it is minimal. It is also seen that an element in <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> is an ''n''th power if it is a ''p''-adic ''n''th power for all ''p''.\n\nThe field <math>K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{7})</math> is 2-special as well, but with <math>S_0=\\emptyset</math>. This explains the other counter-example above.<ref>See Chapter X of Artin–Tate.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*The [[Hasse norm theorem]] states that for cyclic extensions an element is a norm if it is a norm everywhere locally.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Artin | first1=Emil | author1-link=Emil Artin | last2=Tate | first2=John | author2-link=John Tate | title=Class field theory | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=978-0-8218-4426-7 | isbn=978-0-8218-4426-7 | mr=0223335 | year=1990}}\n*{{citation|first=Wilhelm |last=Grunwald |authorlink=Wilhelm Grunwald| title= Ein allgemeiner Existenzsatz für algebraische Zahlkörper | journal = Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik | volume= 169 |year= 1933 |pages= 103–107 | url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN002172518}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Roquette | first1=Peter | authorlink=Peter Roquette| title=The Brauer-Hasse-Noether theorem in historical perspective | url=http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~ci3/brhano.pdf  | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Schriften der Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftlichen Klasse der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften [Publications of the Mathematics and Natural Sciences Section of Heidelberg Academy of Sciences] | isbn=978-3-540-23005-2 | year=2005 | volume=15}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wang | first1=Shianghaw | authorlink=Shianghao Wang| title=A counter-example to Grunwald's theorem | jstor=1969410 | year=1948 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=49 | pages=1008–1009|mr=0026992|doi=10.2307/1969410}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wang | first1=Shianghaw | authorlink=Shianghao Wang| title=On Grunwald's theorem | jstor=1969335 | year=1950 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=51 | pages=471–484|mr=0033801 | doi=10.2307/1969335}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Whaples | first1=George | title=Non-analytic class field theory and Grünwald's theorem | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1077493374 |mr=0007010 | year=1942 | journal=[[Duke Mathematical Journal]] | issn=0012-7094 | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=455–473 | doi=10.1215/s0012-7094-42-00935-9}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grunwald-Wang theorem}}\n[[Category:Class field theory]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic number theory]]"

      "text": "In [[number theory]], the '''Hasse norm theorem''' states that if L/K is a [[cyclic extension]] of [[number field]]s, then if a nonzero element of K is a local norm everywhere, then it is a global norm.\nHere to be a global norm means to be an element ''k'' of K such that there is an element ''l'' of L with <math>\\mathbf{N}_{L/K}(l) = k</math>; in other words ''k'' is a relative norm of some element of the extension field L. To be a local norm means that for some prime '''p''' of K and some prime '''P''' of L lying over K, then ''k'' is a norm from L<sub>'''P'''</sub>; here the \"prime\" '''p''' can be an archimedean valuation, and the theorem is a statement about completions in all valuations, archimedean and non-archimedean.\n\nThe theorem is no longer true in general if the extension is abelian but not cyclic. Hasse gave the counterexample that 3 is a local norm everywhere for the extension <math>{\\mathbf Q}(\\sqrt{-3},\\sqrt{13})/{\\mathbf Q}</math> but is not a global norm. Serre and Tate showed that another counterexample is given by the field <math>{\\mathbf Q}(\\sqrt{13},\\sqrt{17})/{\\mathbf Q}</math> where every rational square is a local norm everywhere but <math>5^2</math> is not a global norm.\n\nThis is an example of a theorem stating a [[local-global principle]]. \n\nThe full theorem is  due to {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Helmut Hasse|last=Hasse|year=1931}}.

This is true for all finite Galois extensions of number fields, not just cyclic ones. For cyclic extensions the group  H<sup>2</sup>(''L''/''K'') is isomorphic to the [[Tate cohomology group]] H<sup>0</sup>(''L''/''K'') which describes which elements are norms, so for cyclic extensions it becomes Hasse's theorem that an element is a norm if it is a local norm everywhere.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Grunwald–Wang theorem]], about when an element that is a power everywhere locally is a power.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|first=H. |last=Hasse|journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse|year=1931 |title=Beweis eines Satzes und Wiederlegung einer Vermutung über das allgemeine Normenrestsymbol|url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002508397|pages=64–69}}\n* H.

So assume ''L''/''K'' is a finite Galois extension, and that ''v''<sub>''K''</sub> is a [[Discrete valuation|discrete normalised valuation]] of ''K'', whose residue field has characteristic ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, and which admits a unique extension to ''L'', say ''w''.  Denote by ''v''<sub>''L''</sub> the associated normalised valuation ''ew'' of ''L'' and let <math>\\scriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}</math> be the [[valuation ring]] of ''L'' under ''v''<sub>''L''</sub>.  Let ''L''/''K'' have [[Galois group]] ''G'' and define the ''s''-th ramification group of ''L''/''K'' for any real ''s''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;&minus;1 by\n\n:<math>G_s(L/K)=\\{\\sigma\\in G\\,:\\,v_L(\\sigma a-a)\\geq s+1 \\text{ for all }a\\in\\mathcal{O}\\}.</math>\n\nSo, for example, ''G''<sub>&minus;1</sub> is the Galois group ''G''.

The Herbrand–Ribet theorem specifies what, in particular, it means when ''p'' divides such an ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\n== Statement ==\nThe [[Galois group]] &Delta; of the [[cyclotomic field]] of ''p''th roots of unity for an odd prime ''p'', '''Q'''(&zeta;) with &zeta;<sup>''p''</sup> = 1, consists of the ''p'' &minus; 1 group elements &sigma;<sub>''a''</sub>, where <math>\\sigma_a(\\zeta) = \\zeta^a</math>. As a consequence of [[Fermat's little theorem]], in the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math> we have ''p'' &minus; 1 roots of unity, each of which is congruent mod ''p'' to some number in the range 1 to ''p'' &minus; 1; we can therefore define a [[Dirichlet character]] &omega; (the Teichmüller character) with values in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math> by requiring that for ''n'' relatively prime to ''p'', &omega;(''n'') be congruent to ''n'' modulo ''p''. The ''p'' part of the class group is a <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>-module (since it is ''p''-primary), hence a module over the [[group ring]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p[\\Delta]</math>. We now define [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s of the group ring for each ''n'' from 1 to ''p'' &minus; 1, as\n\n:<math>\\epsilon_n = \\frac{1}{p-1}\\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} \\omega(a)^n \\sigma_a^{-1}.</math>\n\nIt is easy to see that <math>\\sum\\epsilon_n = 1 </math> and <math> \\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j = \\delta_{ij}\\epsilon_i </math> where <math> \\delta_{ij} </math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. This allows us to break up the ''p'' part of the ideal class group ''G'' of '''Q'''(&zeta;) by means of the idempotents; if ''G'' is the ideal class group, then, letting ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>''n''</sub>(''G''), we have <math> G = \\oplus G_n </math>.\n\nThe Herbrand–Ribet theorem states that for odd ''n'', ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> is nontrivial if and only if ''p'' divides the Bernoulli number ''B''<sub>''p''&minus;''n''</sub>.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ribet |first=Ken |title=A modular construction of unramified p-extensions of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>(&mu;<sub>p</sub>) |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae|Inv.

It provides an asymptotic formula for counting the number of [[prime ideal]]s of a number field ''K'', with [[field norm|norm]] at most ''X''.\n\n==Example==\nWhat to expect can be seen already for the [[Gaussian integer]]s. There for any prime number ''p'' of the form 4''n'' + 1, ''p'' factors as a product of two [[Gaussian prime]]s of norm ''p''. Primes of the form 4''n'' + 3 remain prime, giving a Gaussian prime of norm ''p''<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, we should estimate\n\n:<math>2r(X)+r^\\prime(\\sqrt{X})</math>\n\nwhere ''r'' counts primes in the arithmetic progression 4''n'' + 1, and ''r''&prime; in the arithmetic progression 4''n'' + 3.

As [[Edmund Landau]] proved in {{harvnb|Landau|1903}}, for norm at most ''X'' the same asymptotic formula\n\n:<math>\\frac{X}{\\log X}</math>\n\nalways holds. Heuristically this is because the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the [[Dedekind zeta-function]] of ''K'' always has a simple pole with residue &minus;1 at ''s'' = 1.\n\nAs with the Prime Number Theorem, a more precise estimate may be given in terms of the [[logarithmic integral function]].

It is a foundational theorem of [[Diophantine geometry]] and the [[arithmetic of abelian varieties]].\n\n==History==\nThe ''tangent-chord process'' (one form of [[addition theorem]] on a [[cubic curve]]) had been known as far back as the seventeenth century. The process of [[infinite descent]] of [[Fermat]] was well known, but Mordell succeeded in establishing the finiteness of the [[quotient group]] ''E''('''Q''')/2''E''('''Q''') which forms a major step in the proof. Certainly the finiteness of this group is a [[necessary condition]] for ''E''('''Q''') to be finitely-generated; and it shows that the [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] is finite. This turns out to be the essential difficulty. It can be proved by direct analysis of the doubling of a point on ''E''.\n\nSome years later [[André Weil]] took up the subject, producing the generalisation to Jacobians of higher genus curves over arbitrary number fields in his doctoral dissertation<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Weil |first=André |title=L'arithmétique sur les courbes algébriques |type=PhD |url=http://numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=THESE_1928__95__1_0 |year=1928 |publisher=Almqvist & Wiksells Boktryckeri AB, Uppsala |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222214117/http://numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=THESE_1928__95__1_0 |archivedate=2014-12-22 |df= }}</ref> published in 1928. More abstract methods were required, to carry out a proof with the same basic structure. The second half of the proof needs some type of [[height function]], in terms of which to bound the 'size' of points of ''A''(''K''). Some measure of the co-ordinates will do; heights are logarithmic, so that (roughly speaking) it is a question of how many digits are required to write down a set of [[homogeneous coordinates]]. For an abelian variety, there is no ''a priori'' preferred representation, though, as a [[projective variety]].\n\nBoth halves of the proof have been improved significantly, by subsequent technical advances: in [[Galois cohomology]] as applied to descent, and in the study of the best height functions (which are [[quadratic form]]s).\n\n==Further results==\nThe theorem left unanswered a number of questions:\n\n*Calculation of the rank. This is still a demanding computational problem, and does not always have [[effective results in number theory|effective solutions]].\n*Meaning of the rank: see [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]].\n*For a [[algebraic curve|curve]] ''C'' in its [[Jacobian variety]] as ''A'', can the intersection of ''C'' with ''A''(''K'') be infinite? Because of [[Faltings's theorem]], this is false unless ''C'' = ''A''.\n*In the same context, can ''C'' contain infinitely many torsion points of ''A''? Because of the [[Arithmetic of abelian varieties#Manin.E2.80.93Mumford conjecture|Manin–Mumford conjecture]], proved by Michel Raynaud, this is false unless it is the elliptic curve case.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Arithmetic geometry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite news|last=Weil|first=André|authorlink=André Weil|title=L'arithmétique sur les courbes algébriques|journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]|volume=52|year=1929|pages=281–315|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF02592688|mr=1555278}}\n*{{cite news|last1=Mordell|first1=Louis Joel|title=On the rational solutions of the indeterminate equations of the third and fourth degrees|journal=Proc.

Two absolute values <math>|\\cdot|</math> and <math>|\\cdot|_{\\ast}</math> on a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' are defined to be '''equivalent''' if there exists a [[real number]] {{math|''c'' > 0}} such that\n:<math>|x|_{\\ast} = |x|^c \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathbf{K}.</math>\n\nThe '''trivial absolute value''' on any field ''K'' is defined to be\n:<math>|x|_0 := \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if }  x = 0,  \\\\ 1,  & \\text{if } x \\ne 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n\nThe '''real absolute value''' on the [[rational numbers|rationals]] '''Q''' is the standard [[absolute value]] on the reals, defined to be\n:<math>|x|_\\infty := \\begin{cases} x, & \\text{if }  x \\ge 0  \\\\ -x,  & \\text{if } x < 0. \\end{cases} </math>\nThis is sometimes written with a subscript 1 instead of infinity.\n\nFor a [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}}, the {{mvar|p}}-adic absolute value on '''Q''' is defined as follows: any non-zero rational {{mvar|x}}, can be written uniquely as <math>x=p^{n}\\dfrac{a}{b}</math>, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are integers not divisible by {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|n}} is an integer; so we define\n:<math>|x|_p := \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if }  x = 0,  \\\\ p^{-n},  & \\text{if }  x \\ne 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n\n== Proof ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nConsider a non-trivial absolute value on the rationals <math>(\\mathbf{Q},|\\cdot|_{\\ast})</math>. We consider two cases,\n\n:(i) <math>\\exists{n\\in\\mathbf{N}},|n|_{\\ast}>1</math> \n:(ii) <math>\\forall{n\\in\\mathbf{N}},|n|_{\\ast}\\leq 1</math>\n\nIt suffices for us to consider the valuation of integers greater than one. For, if we find {{mvar|c}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>+</sup>}} for which <math>|n|_\\ast=|n|^c_{\\ast\\ast}</math> for all naturals greater than one; then this relation trivially holds for 0 and 1, and for positive rationals\n\n:<math>\\left |\\frac{m}{n} \\right |_\\ast = \\frac{|m|_\\ast}{|n|_\\ast} = \\frac{|m|^c_{\\ast\\ast}}{|n|^c_{\\ast\\ast}} =\\left (\\frac{|m|_{\\ast\\ast}}{|n|_{\\ast\\ast}} \\right )^c =\\left |\\frac{m}{n} \\right |^c_{\\ast\\ast},</math>\n\nand for negative rationals\n\n:<math>|-x|_\\ast=|x|_\\ast=|x|^c_{\\ast \\ast}=|-x|^c_{\\ast \\ast}.</math>\n\n=== Case I: ∃''n'' &isin; N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|''n''|<sub>∗</sub> > 1 ===\nConsider the following calculation. Let {{mvar|a, b}} and {{mvar|n}} be natural numbers with {{math|''a'', ''b'' > 1}}. Expressing {{mvar|b<sup>n</sup>}} in [[radix|base]] {{mvar|a}} yields\n\n:<math>b^n=\\sum_{i < m} c_i a^i, \\qquad c_i \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,a-1\\}, \\quad m\\leq n\\frac{\\log b}{\\log a} +1.</math>\n\nThen we see, by the properties of an absolute value:\n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n|b|_\\ast^n &= |b^{n}|_{\\ast} \\\\\n&\\leq am\\max \\left \\{|a|_\\ast^{m-1},1 \\right \\}\\\\\n&\\leq a(n\\log_a b+1)\\max \\left \\{|a|_\\ast^{n\\log_a b},1 \\right \\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>|b|_{\\ast} \\leq \\left(a(n\\log_a b+1)\\right)^{1/n} \\max \\left \\{|a|_\\ast^{\\log_a b},1 \\right \\}</math>\n\nHowever we have:\n\n:<math> (a(n\\log_a b+1))^{1/n} \\to 1, \\quad \\text{as} \\quad n \\to \\infty</math>\n\nwhich implies:\n\n:<math>|b|_{\\ast} \\leq \\max \\left \\{|a|_\\ast^{\\log_a b},1 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nNow choose {{math|1 < ''b'' ∈ '''N'''}} such that {{math|{{!}}''b''{{!}}<sub>∗</sub> > 1}}. Using this in the above ensures that {{math|{{!}}''a''{{!}}<sub>∗</sub> > 1}} regardless of the choice of {{mvar|a}} (else <math>|a|_\\ast^{\\log_a b}\\leq1</math> implying <math>|b|_\\ast\\leq 1</math>).

As per the above remarks, we easily see that for all rationals, <math>|x|_\\ast=|x|_\\infty^\\lambda</math>, thus demonstrating equivalence to the real absolute value.\n\n=== Case II: ∀''n'' ∈ N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|''n''|<sub>∗</sub> ≤ 1 ===\nAs this valuation is non-trivial, there must be a natural number for which {{math|{{!}}''n''{{!}}<sub>∗</sub> < 1}}. Factorising this natural,\n\n:<math>n = \\prod_{i<r}p_{i}^{e_{i}}</math>\n\nyields {{math|{{!}}''p''{{!}}<sub>∗</sub>}} must be less than 1, for at least one of the [[prime factors]] {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}. We claim than in fact, that this is so for ''only'' one.\n\nSuppose ''per contra'' that {{math|''p'', ''q''}} are distinct primes with absolute value less than 1. First, let <math>e\\in\\mathbf{N}^{+}</math> be such that <math>|p|_{\\ast}^{e},|q|_{\\ast}^{e}<\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>. By the Euclidean algorithm, there are {{math|''m'', ''n'' ∈ '''Z'''}} such that <math>mp^{e}+nq^{e}=1</math>. This yields\n\n:<math>1=|1|_{\\ast}\\leq |m|_{\\ast}|p|_\\ast^{e}+|n|_{\\ast}|q|_{\\ast}^{e}<\\frac{|m|_{\\ast}+|n|_{\\ast}}{2}\\leq 1,</math>\n\na contradiction.\n\nSo we must have {{math|{{!}}''p<sub>j</sub>''{{!}}<sub>∗</sub> {{=}} ''α'' < 1}} for some {{mvar|j}}, and {{math|{{!}}''p<sub>i</sub>''{{!}}<sub>∗</sub> {{=}} 1}} for {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}. Letting\n\n:<math>c=-\\frac{\\log\\alpha}{\\log p},</math>\n\nwe see that for general positive naturals\n\n:<math>|n|_\\ast= \\left |\\prod_{i<r}p_i^{e_i}\\right |_{\\ast} = \\prod_{i<r} \\left |p_i \\right |_\\ast^{e_i}= \\left |p_{j} \\right |_\\ast^{e_j}=(p^{-e_j})^c=|n|_p^c.</math>\n\nAs per the above remarks we see that <math>|x|_{\\ast}=|x|_p^c</math> all rationals, implying the absolute value is equivalent to the {{mvar|p}}-adic one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\blacksquare</math>\n\nOne can also show a stronger conclusion, namely that <math>|\\cdot|_{\\ast}:\\mathbf{Q}\\to\\mathbf{R}</math> is a nontrivial absolute value if and only if either <math>|\\cdot|_\\ast=|\\cdot|_\\infty ^c</math> for some <math>c\\in (0,1]</math> or <math>|\\cdot|_\\ast=|\\cdot|_p^c</math> for some <math>c\\in(0,\\infty),p\\in\\mathbf{P}</math>.\n\n== Another Ostrowski's theorem ==\nAnother theorem states that any field, complete with respect to an [[absolute value (algebra)#Types of absolute value|Archimedean absolute value]], is (algebraically and topologically) isomorphic to either the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]].

Then the Galois group Gal(''L''/''F'') is an extension of the group Gal(''K''/''F'') by the abelian group Gal(''L''/''K''), and this extension corresponds to an element of the cohomology group H<sup>2</sup>(Gal(''K''/''F''), Gal(''L''/''K'')). On the other hand, class field theory gives a fundamental class in H<sup>2</sup>(Gal(''K''/''F''),''I''<sub>''K''</sub>) and a reciprocity law map from ''I''<sub>''K''</sub> to Gal(''L''/''K''). The Shafarevich–Weil theorem states that the class of the extension  Gal(''L''/''F'') is the image of the fundamental class under the homomorphism of cohomology groups induced by the reciprocity law map {{harv|Artin|Tate|2009|loc=p.246}}.\n\nShafarevich stated his theorem for local fields in terms of division algebras rather than the fundamental class {{harv|Weil|1967}}. In this case, with ''L'' the maximal abelian extension of ''K'', the extension Gal(''L''/''F'') corresponds under the reciprocity map to the normalizer of ''K'' in a division algebra of degree [''K'':''F''] over ''F'', and Shafarevich's theorem states that the Hasse invariant of this division algebra is 1/[''K'':''F'']. The relation to the previous version of the theorem is that division algebras correspond to elements of a second cohomology group (the Brauer group) and under this correspondence the division algebra with Hasse invariant 1/[''K'':''F''] corresponds to the fundamental class.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Artin | first1=Emil | author1-link=Emil Artin | last2=Tate | first2=John | author2-link=John Tate | title=Class field theory | origyear=1952 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=978-0-8218-4426-7 | publisher=AMS Chelsea Publishing, Providence, RI | isbn=978-0-8218-4426-7 | mr=0223335 | year=2009}}\n*{{citation|mr=0018170\n|last=Shafarevich|first= I.

It solves a special case of Gauss's [[Class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields|class number problem]] of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields that have a given fixed [[ideal class group|class number]].\n\nLet '''Q''' denote the set of [[rational number]]s, and let ''d'' be a non-square [[integer]]. Then [[algebraic number field|'''Q'''({{radic|''d''}})]] is a [[field extension|finite extension]] of '''Q''' of degree 2, called a quadratic extension. The [[ideal class group|class number]] of '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}) is the number of [[equivalence class]]es of [[ring ideal|ideal]]s of the ring of integers of '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}), where two ideals ''I'' and ''J'' are equivalent [[if and only if]] there exist [[principal ideal]]s (''a'') and (''b'') such that (''a'')''I'' = (''b'')''J''. Thus, the ring of integers of '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}) is a [[principal ideal domain]] (and hence a [[unique factorization domain]]) if and only if the class number of '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}) is equal to 1. The Baker–Heegner–Stark theorem can then be stated as follows:\n\n:If ''d'' < 0, then the class number of '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}) is equal to 1 if and only if\n\n:: <math>d \\in \\{\\, -1, -2, -3, -7, -11, -19, -43, -67, -163\\,\\}.</math>\nThese are known as the [[Heegner number]]s.\n\nThis list is also written, replacing &minus;1 with &minus;4 and &minus;2 with &minus;8 (which does not change the field), as:<ref>{{harvtxt|Elkies|1999}}, p.&nbsp;93.</ref>\n\n:<math>D = -3, -4, -7, -8, -11, -19, -43, -67, -163,\\,</math>\nwhere ''D'' is interpreted as the [[Discriminant of an algebraic number field|discriminant]] (either of the [[number field]] or of an [[elliptic curve]] with [[complex multiplication]]). This is more standard, as the ''D'' are then [[fundamental discriminant]]s.\n\n==History==\nThis result was first conjectured by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in Section 303 of his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798).  It was essentially proven by [[Kurt Heegner]] in 1952, but Heegner's proof had some minor gaps and the theorem was not accepted until [[Harold Stark]] gave a complete proof in 1967, which had many commonalities to Heegner's work, but sufficiently many differences that Stark considers the proofs to be different.<ref>{{harvtxt|Stark|2011}} page 42</ref> Heegner \"died before anyone really understood what he had done\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1985}}.</ref> Stark formally filled in the gap in Heegner's proof in 1969 (other contemporary papers produced various similar proofs by modular functions, but Stark concentrated on explicitly filling Heegner's gap).<ref>{{harvtxt|Stark|1969a}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] gave a completely different proof slightly earlier (1966) than Stark's work (or more precisely Baker reduced the result to a finite amount of computation, with Stark's work in his 1963/4 thesis already providing this computation), and won the [[Fields Medal]] for his methods. Stark later pointed out that Baker's proof, involving linear forms in 3 logarithms, could be reduced to only 2 logarithms, when the result was already known from 1949 by Gelfond and Linnik.<ref>{{harvtxt|Stark|1969b}}</ref>\n\nStark's 1969 paper {{harv|Stark|1969a}} also cited the 1895 text by [[Heinrich Martin Weber]] and noted that if Weber had \"only made the observation that the reducibility of [a certain equation] would lead to a [[Diophantine equation]], the class-number one problem would have been solved 60 years ago\". [[Bryan Birch]] notes that Weber's book, and essentially the whole field of modular functions, dropped out of interest for half a century: \"Unhappily, in 1952 there was no one left who was sufficiently expert in Weber's ''Algebra'' to appreciate Heegner's achievement.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Birch|2004}}</ref>\n\nDeuring, Siegel, and Chowla all gave slightly variant proofs by [[Modular_form#Modular_functions|modular functions]] in the immediate years after Stark.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chowla|1970}}</ref> Other versions in this genre have also cropped up over the years. For instance, in 1985, Monsur Kenku gave a proof using the [[Klein quartic]] (though again utilizing modular functions).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kenku|1985}}.</ref> And again, in 1999, Imin Chen gave another variant proof by modular functions (following Siegel's outline).<ref>{{harvtxt|Chen|1999}}</ref>\n\nThe work of Gross and Zagier (1986) {{harv|Gross|Zagier|1986}} combined with that of Goldfeld (1976) also gives an alternative proof.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1985}}</ref>\n\n==Real case==\nOn the other hand, it is unknown whether there are infinitely many ''d'' > 0 for which '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}) has class number 1.

      "title": "Takagi existence theorem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takagi_existence_theorem",
      "text": "In [[class field theory]], the '''Takagi existence theorem''' states that for any number field ''K'' there is a one-to-one inclusion reversing correspondence between the finite [[abelian extension]]s of ''K'' (in a fixed [[algebraic closure]] of ''K'') and the '''generalized ideal class groups''' defined via a '''modulus''' of ''K''. \n\nIt is called an [[existence theorem]] because a main burden of the proof is to show the existence of enough abelian extensions of ''K''.\n\n==Formulation==\nHere a modulus (or ''ray divisor'') is a formal finite product of the [[Valuation (algebra)|valuations]] (also called '''primes''' or '''places''') of ''K'' with positive integer exponents. The archimedean valuations that might appear in a modulus include only those whose completions are the real numbers (not the complex numbers); they may be identified with orderings on ''K'' and occur only to exponent one.\n\nThe modulus ''m'' is a product of a non-archimedean (finite) part ''m''<sub>''f''</sub> and an archimedean (infinite) part ''m''<sub>∞</sub>.  The non-archimedean part ''m''<sub>''f''</sub> is a nonzero ideal in the [[ring of integers]] ''O''<sub>''K''</sub> of ''K'' and the archimedean part ''m''<sub>∞</sub> is simply a set of real embeddings of ''K''.  Associated to such a modulus ''m'' are two groups of [[fractional ideal]]s.  The larger one, ''I''<sub>''m''</sub>, is the group of all fractional ideals relatively prime to ''m'' (which means these fractional ideals do not involve any prime ideal appearing in ''m''<sub>''f''</sub>).  The smaller one, ''P''<sub>''m''</sub>, is the group of principal fractional ideals (''u''/''v'') where ''u'' and ''v'' are nonzero elements of ''O''<sub>''K''</sub> which are prime to ''m''<sub>''f''</sub>, ''u'' ≡ ''v'' mod ''m''<sub>''f''</sub>, and ''u''/''v'' > 0 in each of the orderings of ''m''<sub>∞</sub>.   (It is important here that in ''P''<sub>''m''</sub>, all we require is that some generator of the ideal has the indicated form.  If one does, others might not.  For instance, taking ''K'' to be the rational numbers, the ideal (3) lies in ''P''<sub>4</sub> because (3) = (−3) and −3 fits the necessary conditions.  But (3) is not in ''P''<sub>4∞</sub> since here it is required that the ''positive'' generator of the ideal is 1 mod 4, which is not so.) For any group ''H'' lying between ''I''<sub>''m''</sub> and ''P''<sub>''m''</sub>, the quotient ''I''<sub>''m''</sub>/''H'' is called a ''generalized ideal class group''.  \n\nIt is these generalized ideal class groups which correspond to abelian extensions of ''K'' by the existence theorem, and in fact are the Galois groups of these extensions. That generalized ideal class groups are finite is proved along the same lines of the proof that the usual [[ideal class group]] is finite, well in advance of knowing these are Galois groups of finite abelian extensions of the number field.\n\n==A well-defined correspondence==\nStrictly speaking, the correspondence between finite abelian extensions of ''K'' and generalized ideal class groups is not quite one-to-one. Generalized ideal class groups defined relative to different moduli can give rise to the same abelian extension of ''K'', and this is codified a priori in a somewhat complicated equivalence relation on generalized ideal class groups.  \n\nIn concrete terms, for abelian extensions ''L'' of the rational numbers, this corresponds to the fact that an abelian extension of the rationals lying in one cyclotomic field also lies in infinitely many other cyclotomic fields, and for each such cyclotomic overfield one obtains by Galois theory a subgroup of the Galois group corresponding to the same field ''L''.  \n\nIn the [[idelic formulation of class field theory]], one obtains a precise one-to-one correspondence between abelian extensions and appropriate groups of [[idele]]s, where equivalent generalized ideal class groups in the ideal-theoretic language correspond to the same group of ideles.\n\n==Earlier work==\nA special case of the existence theorem is when ''m'' = 1 and ''H'' = ''P''<sub>1</sub>.  In this case the generalized ideal class group is the [[ideal class group]] of ''K'', and the existence theorem says there exists a unique [[abelian extension]] ''L''/''K'' with [[Galois group]] isomorphic to the ideal class group of ''K'' such that ''L'' is [[Ramification (mathematics)#unramified|unramified]] at all places of ''K''. This extension is called the [[Hilbert class field]].  It was conjectured by [[David Hilbert]] to exist, and existence in this special case was proved by [[Phillip Furtwängler|Furtwängler]] in 1907, before Takagi's general existence theorem. \n\nA further and special property of the Hilbert class field, not true of smaller abelian extensions of a number field, is that all ideals in a number field become principal in the Hilbert class field. It required [[Emil Artin|Artin]] and Furtwängler to prove that principalization occurs.\n\n==History==\nThe existence theorem is due to [[Teiji Takagi|Takagi]], who proved it in Japan during the isolated years of [[World War I]]. He presented it at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1920, leading to the development of the classical theory of [[class field theory]] during the 1920s. At Hilbert's request, the paper was published in [[Mathematische Annalen]] in 1925.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Class formation]]\n\n==References==\n* [[Helmut Hasse]], ''History of Class Field Theory'',  pp.&nbsp;266–279 in ''Algebraic Number Theory'',  eds.

      "text": "{{short description|Theorem relating to algebraic topology}}\nIn mathematics, the '''Landweber exact functor theorem''', named after [[Peter Landweber]], is a theorem in [[algebraic topology]]. It is known that a [[complex orientation]] of a [[homology theory]] leads to a [[formal group law]]. The Landweber exact functor theorem (or LEFT for short) can be seen as a method to reverse this process: it constructs a homology theory out of a formal group law.\n\n==Statement==\nThe coefficient ring of [[complex cobordism]] is <math>MU_*(*) = MU_* \\cong \\Z[x_1,x_2,\\dots]</math>, where the degree of <math>x_i</math> is <math>2i</math>. This is isomorphic to the graded [[Lazard ring]] <math>\\mathcal{}L_*</math>. This means that giving a formal group law F (of degree <math>-2</math>) over a graded ring <math>R_*</math> is equivalent to giving a graded ring morphism <math>L_*\\to R_*</math>. Multiplication by an integer <math>n>0</math> is defined inductively as a power series, by\n\n:<math>[n+1]^F x = F(x, [n]^F x)</math> and <math>[1]^F x = x.</math>\n\nLet now F be a formal group law over a ring <math>\\mathcal{}R_*</math>. Define for a [[topological space]] ''X''\n:<math>E_*(X) = MU_*(X)\\otimes_{MU_*}R_*</math>\nHere <math>R_*</math> gets its <math>MU_*</math>-algebra structure via F. The question is: is E a homology theory? It is obviously a homotopy invariant functor, which fulfills excision. The problem is that tensoring in general does not preserve exact sequences. One could demand that <math>R_*</math> be [[Flat module|flat]] over <math>MU_*</math>, but that would be too strong in practice. Peter Landweber found another criterion:\n\n:'''Theorem''' (Landweber exact functor theorem)\n: For every prime p, there are elements <math>v_1,v_2,\\dots \\in MU_*</math> such that we have the following: Suppose that <math>M_*</math> is a graded <math>MU_*</math>-module and the sequence <math>(p,v_1,v_2,\\dots, v_n)</math> is [[Regular sequence (algebra)|regular]] for <math>M</math>, for every ''p'' and ''n''. Then \n::<math>E_*(X) = MU_*(X)\\otimes_{MU_*}M_*</math>\n:is a homology theory on [[CW-complex]]es.\n\nIn particular, every formal group law F over a ring <math>R</math> yields a module over <math>\\mathcal{}MU_*</math> since we get via F a ring morphism <math>MU_*\\to R</math>.\n\n==Remarks==\n*There is also a version for [[Brown–Peterson cohomology]] BP. The [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectrum]] BP is a direct summand of <math>MU_{(p)}</math> with coefficients <math>\\Z_{(p)}[v_1,v_2,\\dots]</math>. The statement of the LEFT stays true if one fixes a prime p and substitutes BP for MU.\n*The classical proof of the LEFT uses the Landweber–Morava invariant ideal theorem: the only prime ideals of <math>BP_*</math> which are invariant under coaction of <math>BP_*BP</math> are the <math>I_n = (p,v_1,\\dots, v_n)</math>. This allows to check flatness only against the <math>BP_*/I_n</math> (see Landweber, 1976).\n*The LEFT can be strengthened as follows: let <math>\\mathcal{E}_*</math> be the (homotopy) category of Landweber exact <math>MU_*</math>-modules and <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> the category of MU-module spectra M such that <math>\\pi_*M</math> is Landweber exact. Then the functor <math>\\pi_*\\colon\\mathcal{E}\\to \\mathcal{E}_*</math> is an equivalence of categories. The inverse functor (given by the LEFT) takes <math>\\mathcal{}MU_*</math>-algebras to (homotopy) MU-algebra spectra (see Hovey, Strickland, 1999, Thm 2.7).\n\n==Examples==\nThe archetypical and first known (non-trivial) example is [[Topological K-theory|complex K-theory]] K. Complex K-theory is [[complex orientation|complex oriented]] and has as formal group law <math>x+y+xy</math>. The corresponding morphism <math>MU_*\\to K_*</math> is also known as the [[Todd genus]]. We have then an isomorphism\n: <math>K_*(X) = MU_*(X)\\otimes_{MU_*}K_*,</math>\ncalled the ''Conner–Floyd isomorphism''.\n\nWhile complex K-theory was constructed before by geometric means, many homology theories were first constructed via the Landweber exact functor theorem. This includes [[elliptic cohomology|elliptic homology]], the [[Johnson–Wilson theory|Johnson&ndash;Wilson theories]] <math>E(n)</math> and the [[Lubin&ndash;Tate spectra]] <math>E_n</math>.\n\nWhile homology with rational coefficients <math>H\\mathbb{Q}</math> is Landweber exact, homology with integer coefficients <math>H\\mathbb{Z}</math> is not Landweber exact. Furthermore, [[Morava K-theory]] K(n) is not Landweber exact.\n\n==Modern reformulation==\nA module M over <math>\\mathcal{}MU_*</math> is the same as a [[Coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaf]] <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> over <math>\\text{Spec }L</math>, where L is the Lazard ring. If <math>M = \\mathcal{}MU_*(X)</math>, then M has the extra datum of a <math>\\mathcal{}MU_*MU</math> coaction. A coaction on the ring level corresponds to that <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> is an equivariant sheaf with respect to an action of an affine group scheme G. It is a theorem of [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]] that <math>G \\cong \\Z[b_1, b_2,\\dots]</math> and assigns to every ring R the group of power series \n:<math>g(t) = t+b_1t^2+b_2t^3+\\cdots\\in R[[t]]</math>. \nIt acts on the set of formal group laws <math>\\text{Spec }L(R)</math> via \n:<math>F(x,y) \\mapsto gF(g^{-1}x, g^{-1}y)</math>.\nThese are just the coordinate changes of formal group laws. Therefore, one can identify the [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] quotient <math>\\text{Spec }L // G</math> with the ''stack of (1-dimensional) [[formal group]]s'' <math>\\mathcal{M}_{fg}</math> and <math>M = MU_*(X)</math> defines a quasi-coherent sheaf over this stack. Now it is quite easy to see that it suffices that M defines a quasi-coherent sheaf <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> which is flat over <math>\\mathcal{M}_{fg}</math> in order that <math>MU_*(X)\\otimes_{MU_*}M</math> is a homology theory. The Landweber exactness theorem can then be interpreted as a flatness criterion for <math>\\mathcal{M}_{fg}</math> (see Lurie 2010).\n\n==Refinements to <math>E_\\infty</math>-ring spectra==\nWhile the LEFT is known to produce (homotopy) ring spectra out of <math>\\mathcal{}MU_*</math>, it is a much more delicate question to understand when these spectra are actually [[highly structured ring spectrum|<math>E_\\infty</math>-ring spectra]]. As of 2010, the best progress was made by [[Jacob Lurie]]. If X is an [[algebraic stack]] and <math>X\\to \\mathcal{M}_{fg}</math> a flat map of stacks, the discussion above shows that we get a presheaf of (homotopy) ring spectra on X. If this map factors over <math>M_p(n)</math> (the stack of 1-dimensional [[p-divisible group]]s of height n) and the map <math>X\\to M_p(n)</math> is [[Étale topology|etale]], then this presheaf can be refined to a sheaf of <math>E_\\infty</math>-ring spectra (see Goerss). This theorem is important for the construction of [[topological modular forms]].\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web|first=Paul|last= Goerss| url=http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~pgoerss/papers/banff.pdf|title= Realizing families of Landweber exact homology theories}}\n* {{citation|last1=Hovey|first1= Mark|last2= Strickland|first2= Neil P.|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207115433/http://math.wesleyan.edu/~mhovey/papers/kn.ps|title= Morava K-theories and localisation| journal= [[Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume= 139 | year=1999|issue= 666|mr=1601906|doi=10.1090/memo/0666}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Peter S.|last= Landweber|authorlink=Peter Landweber|title=Homological properties of comodules over <math>MU_*(MU)</math> and <math>BP_*(BP)</math>|journal= [[American Journal of Mathematics]] | volume= 98 |issue= 3|year=1976|pages= 591–610|jstor= 2373808|doi= 10.2307/2373808}}.\n* {{cite web|first=Jacob|last= Lurie|authorlink=Jacob Lurie|  url=http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/252x.html|title= Chromatic Homotopy Theory.

Suppose that:\n# The functor ''F'' maps [[coproducts]] (i.e. [[wedge sum]]s) in ''Hotc'' to products in ''Set'': <math>F(\\vee_\\alpha X_\\alpha) \\cong \\prod_\\alpha F(X_\\alpha),</math>\n# The functor ''F'' maps [[Mapping cylinder|homotopy pushouts]] in ''Hotc'' to [[Pullback (category theory)#Weak pullbacks|weak pullbacks]].  This is often stated as a [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence|Mayer–Vietoris]] axiom: for any CW complex ''W'' covered by two subcomplexes ''U'' and ''V'', and any elements ''u'' ∈ ''F''(''U''), ''v'' ∈ ''F''(''V'') such that ''u'' and ''v'' restrict to the same element of ''F''(''U'' ∩ ''V''), there is an element ''w'' ∈ ''F''(''W'') restricting to ''u'' and ''v'', respectively.\nThen ''F'' is representable by some CW complex ''C'', that is to say there is an isomorphism \n:''F''(''Z'') &cong; ''Hom''<sub>''Hotc''</sub>(''Z'', ''C'')\nfor any CW complex ''Z'', which is [[Natural transformation|natural]] in ''Z'' in that for any morphism from ''Z'' to another CW complex ''Y'' the induced maps ''F''(''Y'') → ''F''(''Z'') and ''Hom''<sub>''Hot''</sub>(''Y'', ''C'') → ''Hom''<sub>''Hot''</sub>(''Z'', ''C'') are compatible with these isomorphisms.\n\nThe converse statement also holds: any functor represented by a CW complex satisfies the above two properties. This direction is an immediate consequence of basic category theory, so the deeper and more interesting part of the equivalence is the other implication.\n\nThe representing object ''C'' above can be shown to depend functorially on ''F'': any [[natural transformation]] from ''F'' to another functor satisfying the conditions of the theorem necessarily induces a map of the representing objects. This is a consequence of [[Yoneda's lemma]].\n\nTaking ''F''(''X'') to be the [[singular cohomology]] group ''H''<sup>''i''</sup>(''X'',''A'') with coefficients in a given abelian group ''A'', for fixed ''i'' > 0; then the representing space for ''F'' is the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] ''K''(''A'', ''i'').

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_approximation_theorem",
      "text": "In [[algebraic topology]], in the '''cellular approximation theorem''', a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] between [[CW-complex]]es can always be taken to be of a specific type. Concretely, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are CW-complexes, and ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a continuous map, then ''f'' is said to be ''cellular'', if ''f'' takes the [[n-skeleton|''n''-skeleton]] of ''X'' to the ''n''-skeleton of ''Y'' for all ''n'', i.e. if <math>f(X^n)\\subseteq Y^n</math> for all ''n''. The content of the cellular approximation theorem is then that any continuous map ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' between CW-complexes ''X'' and ''Y'' is [[Homotopy|homotopic]] to a cellular map, and if ''f'' is already cellular on a subcomplex ''A'' of ''X'', then we can furthermore choose the homotopy to be stationary on ''A''. From an algebraic topological viewpoint, any map between CW-complexes can thus be taken to be cellular.\n\n== Idea of proof ==\n\nThe proof can be given by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] after ''n'', with the statement that ''f'' is cellular on the skeleton ''X''<sup>''n''</sup>. For the base case n=0, notice that every [[Path-connected#Path_connectedness|path-component]] of ''Y'' must contain a 0-cell. The [[Image (mathematics)|image]] under ''f'' of a 0-cell of ''X'' can thus be connected to a 0-cell of ''Y'' by a path, but this gives a homotopy from ''f'' to a map which is cellular on the 0-skeleton of X.\n\nAssume inductively that ''f'' is cellular on the (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-skeleton of ''X'', and let ''e''<sup>''n'' </sup> be an ''n''-cell of ''X''. The [[Closure (topology)|closure]] of ''e''<sup>''n''</sup> is [[compact set|compact]] in ''X'', being the image of the characteristic map of the cell, and hence the image of the closure of ''e''<sup>''n''</sup> under ''f'' is also compact in ''Y''. Then it is a general result of CW-complexes that any compact subspace of a CW-complex meets (that is, [[Intersection (set theory)|intersects]] [[non-trivial]]ly) only finitely many cells of the complex. Thus ''f''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) meets at most finitely many cells of ''Y'', so we can take <math>e^k\\subseteq Y</math> to be a cell of highest dimension meeting ''f''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>). If <math>k\\leq n</math>, the map ''f'' is already cellular on ''e''<sup>''n''</sup>, since in this case only cells of the ''n''-skeleton of ''Y'' meets ''f''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>), so we may assume that ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''n''. It is then a technical, non-trivial result (see Hatcher) that the [[Function_(mathematics)#Restrictions_and_extensions|restriction]] of ''f'' to <math>X^{n-1}\\cup e^n</math> can be [[Homotopy#Relative homotopy|homotoped relative]] to ''X''<sup>''n-1''</sup> to a map missing a point ''p''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''e''<sup>''k''</sup>. Since ''Y''<sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;{''p''} [[Deformation retraction|deformation retracts]] onto the subspace ''Y''<sup>''k''</sup>-''e''<sup>''k''</sup>, we can further homotope the restriction of ''f'' to <math>X^{n-1}\\cup e^n</math> to a map, say, ''g'', with the property that ''g''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) misses the cell ''e''<sup>''k''</sup> of ''Y'', still relative to ''X''<sup>''n-1''</sup>. Since ''f''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) met only finitely many cells of ''Y'' to begin with, we can repeat this process finitely many times to make <math>f(e^n)</math> miss all cells of ''Y'' of dimension larger than ''n''.\n\nWe repeat this process for every ''n''-cell of ''X'', fixing cells of the subcomplex ''A'' on which ''f'' is already cellular, and we thus obtain a homotopy (relative to the (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-skeleton of ''X'' and the ''n''-cells of ''A'') of the restriction of ''f'' to ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> to a map cellular on all cells of ''X'' of dimension at most ''n''. Using then the [[homotopy extension property]] to extend this to a homotopy on all of ''X'', and patching these homotopies together, will finish the proof. For details, consult Hatcher.\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Some homotopy groups ===\n\nThe cellular approximation theorem can be used to immediately calculate some [[homotopy group]]s. In particular, if <math>n<k</math>, then <math>\\pi_n(S^k)=0 \\,</math>: Give <math>S^n \\,</math> and <math>S^k \\,</math> their [[canonical form|canonical]] CW-structure, with one 0-cell each, and with one ''n''-cell for <math>S^n \\,</math> and one ''k''-cell for <math>S^k \\,</math>. Any [[Base-point|base-point preserving]] map ''f'':<math>S^n \\,</math>→<math>S^k \\,</math> is by the cellular approximation theorem homotopic to a constant map, whence <math>\\pi_n(S^k)=0 \\,</math>.\n\n=== Cellular approximation for pairs ===\n\nLet ''f'':''(X,A)''→''(Y,B)'' be a map of [[CW-pair]]s, that is, ''f'' is a map from ''X'' to ''Y'', and the image of <math>A\\subseteq X \\,</math> under ''f'' sits inside ''B''. Then ''f'' is homotopic to a cellular map ''(X,A)''→''(Y,B)''. To see this, restrict ''f'' to ''A'' and use cellular approximation to obtain a homotopy of ''f'' to a cellular map on ''A''. Use the homotopy extension property to extend this homotopy to all of ''X'', and apply cellular approximation again to obtain a map cellular on ''X'', but without violating the cellular property on ''A''.\n\nAs a consequence, we have that a CW-pair ''(X,A)'' is [[n-connected]], if all cells of <math>X-A</math> have dimension strictly greater than ''n'': If <math>i\\leq n \\,</math>, then any map <math>(D^i,\\partial D^i) \\,</math>→''(X,A)'' is homotopic to a cellular map of pairs, and since the ''n''-skeleton of ''X'' sits inside ''A'', any such map is homotopic to a map whose image is in ''A'', and hence it is 0 in the relative homotopy group <math>\\pi_i(X,A) \\,</math>.<br />\nWe have in particular that <math>(X,X^n)\\,</math> is ''n''-connected, so it follows from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair <math>(X,X^n) \\,</math> that we have isomorphisms <math>\\pi_i(X^n) \\,</math>→<math>\\pi_i(X) \\,</math> for all <math>i<n \\,</math> and a surjection <math>\\pi_n(X^n) \\,</math>→<math>\\pi_n(X) \\,</math>.\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Hatcher | first1=Allen | title=Algebraic topology | url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-79540-1 | year=2005}}\n\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic topology]]"

The theorem first appeared in a 1953 paper in the [[American Journal of Mathematics]] by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and Joseph A. Zilber.  One possible route to a proof is the [[acyclic model]] theorem.\n\n==Statement of the theorem==\nThe theorem can be formulated as follows.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], and specifically in the field of [[homotopy theory]], the '''Freudenthal suspension theorem''' is the fundamental result leading to the concept of stabilization of [[homotopy group]]s and ultimately to [[stable homotopy theory]].  It explains the behavior of simultaneously taking [[suspension (topology)|suspension]]s and increasing the index of the homotopy groups of the space in question. It was proved in 1937 by [[Hans Freudenthal]].\n\nThe theorem is a corollary of the [[homotopy excision theorem]].\n\n==Statement of the theorem==\nLet ''X'' be an [[n-connected|''n''-connected]] [[pointed space]] (a pointed [[CW-complex]] or pointed [[simplicial set]]). The map\n\n:<math>X \\to \\Omega(\\Sigma X)</math>\n\ninduces a map\n\n:<math>\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(\\Sigma X))</math>\n\non homotopy groups, where Ω denotes the [[loop functor]] and Σ denotes the [[Suspension (topology)|reduced suspension functor]]. The suspension theorem then states that the induced map on homotopy groups is an [[isomorphism]] if ''k'' ≤ 2''n'' and an [[epimorphism]] if ''k'' = 2''n'' + 1.\n\nA basic result on loop spaces gives the relation\n\n:<math>\\pi_k(\\Omega (\\Sigma X)) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(\\Sigma X)</math>\n\nso the theorem could otherwise be stated in terms of the map\n\n:<math>\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(\\Sigma X),</math>\n\nwith the small caveat that in this case one must be careful with the indexing.\n\n===Proof===\n\nAs mentioned above, the Freudenthal suspension theorem follows quickly from homotopy excision; this proof is in terms of the natural map <math>\\pi_k(X)\\to\\pi_{k+1}(\\Sigma X)</math>. If a space <math>X</math> is <math>n</math>-connected, then the pair of spaces <math>(CX,X)</math> is <math>(n+1)</math>-connected, where <math>CX</math> is the [[Cone (topology)|reduced cone]] over <math>X</math>; this follows from the [[Homotopy group#Relative homotopy groups|relative homotopy long exact sequence]]. We can decompose <math>\\Sigma X</math> as two copies of <math>CX</math>, say <math>(CX)_+, (CX)_-</math>, whose intersection is <math>X</math>. Then, homotopy excision says the inclusion map: \n\n:<math>((CX)_+, X)\\subset (\\Sigma X,(CX)_-)</math> \n\ninduces isomorphisms on <math>\\pi_i, i < 2n+2</math> and a surjection on <math>\\pi_{2n+2}</math>. From the same relative long exact sequence, <math>\\pi_i(X)=\\pi_{i+1}(CX,X),</math> and since in addition cones are contractible, \n\n:<math>\\pi_i(\\Sigma X,(CX)_-)=\\pi_i(\\Sigma X).</math>\n\nPutting this all together, we get \n\n:<math>\\pi_i(X)=\\pi_{i+1}((CX)_+,X)=\\pi_{i+1}((\\Sigma X,(CX)_-)=\\pi_{i+1}(\\Sigma X)</math> \n\nfor <math>i+1<2n+2</math>, i.e. <math>i\\leqslant 2n</math>, as claimed above; for <math>i=2n+1</math> the left and right maps are isomorphisms, regardless of how connected <math>X</math> is, and the middle one is a surjection by excision, so the composition is a surjection as claimed.\n\n===Corollary 1===\n\nLet ''S<sup>n</sup>'' denote the ''n''-sphere and note that it is (''n'' − 1)-connected so that the groups <math>\\pi_{n+k}(S^n)</math> stabilize for <math>n \\geqslant k+2</math> by the Freudenthal theorem. These groups represent the ''k''th stable [[homotopy groups of spheres|homotopy group of spheres]].\n\n===Corollary 2===\n\nMore generally, for fixed ''k'' ≥ 1, ''k'' ≤ 2''n'' for sufficiently large ''n'', so that any ''n''-connected space ''X'' will have corresponding stabilized homotopy groups.  These groups are actually the homotopy groups of an object corresponding to ''X'' in the [[stable homotopy category]].\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first=H.|last=Freudenthal|authorlink=Hans Freudenthal|title=Über die Klassen der Sphärenabbildungen.

The theorem was first stated by [[Henri Poincaré]] in the late 19th century,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and first proven in 1912 by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]].<ref>[http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?ht=VIEW&did=D28661 Georg-August-Universität Göttingen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526145611/http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?ht=VIEW&did=D28661 |date=2006-05-26 }}</ref>\n\nThe theorem has been expressed colloquially as \"you can't comb a hairy ball flat without creating a [[cowlick]]\" or \"you can't comb the hair on a coconut\". \n\n==Counting zeros==\nEvery zero of a vector field has a non-zero) \"[[Vector field#Index of a vector field|index]]\", and it can be shown that the sum of all of the indices at all of the zeros must be two, because the [[Euler characteristic]] of the 2-sphere is two. Therefore, there must be at least one zero. This is a consequence of the [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]]. In the case of the [[torus]], the Euler characteristic is 0; and it is possible to \"comb a hairy doughnut flat\". In this regard, it follows that for any [[compact space|compact]] [[Irregularity of a surface|regular]] 2-dimensional [[manifold]] with non-zero Euler characteristic, any continuous tangent vector field has at least one zero.\n\n==Cyclone consequences==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nA meteorological application of this theorem involves considering the wind as a vector defined at every point continuously over the surface of a planet with an atmosphere. As an idealisation, take wind to be a two-dimensional vector, so that any vertical motion is ignored. One scenario, in which there is absolutely no wind, corresponds to a field of zero-vectors. But in the case where there is at least some wind, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates that at all times there must be at least one point on a planet with no wind at all and therefore a tuft. This corresponds to the above statement that there will always be ''p'' such that ''f''(''p'') = '''0'''.\n\nIn a physical sense, this zero-wind point will be the center of a cyclone or anticyclone. Like the swirled hairs on the tennis ball, the wind will spiral around this zero-wind point - under the assumptions made, it cannot flow into or out of the point. Thus, given at least some wind on Earth, there must at all times be a [[cyclone]] or anticyclone somewhere. The center with zero wind can be arbitrarily large or small. Mathematical consistency dictates the wind forms a cyclonic wind pattern for at least one point on the planet, but this does not require the cyclone be a violent storm. \n\nThe assumptions break down in reality, as the air above the earth has multiple layers, but for each layer there must be a point with zero horizontal wind speed.\n\n==Application to computer graphics==\nA common problem in computer graphics is to generate a non-zero vector in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> that is orthogonal to a given non-zero one. There is no single continuous function that can do this for all non-zero vector inputs. This is a corollary of the hairy ball theorem. To see this, consider the given vector as the radius of a sphere and note that finding a non-zero vector orthogonal to the given one is equivalent to finding a non-zero vector that is tangent to the surface of that sphere where it touches the radius. However, the hairy ball theorem says there exists no continuous function that can do this for every point on the sphere (equivalently, for every given vector).\n\n==Lefschetz connection==\nThere is a closely related argument from [[algebraic topology]], using the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]]. Since the [[Betti number]]s of a 2-sphere are 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ... the ''[[Lefschetz number]]'' (total trace on [[homology (mathematics)|homology]]) of the [[identity mapping]] is 2. By integrating a [[vector field]] we get (at least a small part of) a [[one-parameter group]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s on the sphere; and all of the mappings in it are [[homotopic]] to the identity. Therefore, they all have Lefschetz number 2, also. Hence they have fixed points (since the Lefschetz number is nonzero). Some more work would be needed to show that this implies there must actually be a zero of the vector field. It does suggest the correct statement of the more general [[Poincaré-Hopf index theorem]].\n\n==Corollary==\nA consequence of the hairy ball theorem is that any continuous [[Functions (mathematics)|function]] that maps an even-dimensional sphere [[Endomorphism|into itself]] has either a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] or a point that maps onto its own [[antipodal point]].  This can be seen by transforming the function into a tangential vector field as follows.\n\nLet ''s'' be the function mapping the sphere to itself, and let ''v'' be the tangential vector function to be constructed.  For each point ''p'', construct the [[stereographic projection]] of ''s''(''p'') with ''p'' as the point of tangency.  Then ''v''(''p'') is the displacement vector of this projected point relative to ''p''.  According to the hairy ball theorem, there is a ''p'' such that ''v''(''p'') = '''0''', so that ''s''(''p'') = ''p''.\n\nThis argument breaks down only if there exists a point ''p'' for which ''s''(''p'') is the antipodal point of ''p'', since such a point is the only one that cannot be stereographically projected onto the tangent plane of ''p''.\n\n==Higher dimensions==\nThe connection with the [[Euler characteristic]] χ suggests the correct generalisation: the [[N-sphere|2''n''-sphere]] has no non-vanishing vector field for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 1}}. The difference between even and odd dimensions is that, because the only nonzero [[Betti number]]s of the ''m''-sphere are b<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>m</sub>, their [[alternating sum]] χ is 2 for ''m'' even, and 0 for ''m'' odd.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fixed-point theorem]]\n*[[Intermediate value theorem]]\n*[[Vector fields on spheres]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation |first1=Murray |last1=Eisenberg |first2=Robert |last2=Guy |title=A Proof of the Hairy Ball Theorem |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=86 |issue=7 |year=1979 |pages=571–574 |doi=10.2307/2320587}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation|title=The Hairy Ball Theorem via Sperner's Lemma|last1=Jarvis|first1=Tyler|last2=Tanton|first2=James |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=111 |issue=7 |year=2004 |pages=599–603 |jstor=4145162 }}\n* {{Citation|last=Reich|first=Henry|year=2011|title=One-Minute Math: Why you can't comb a hairy ball|publisher=New ScientistTV|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/nstv/2011/12/one-minute-math-why-you-cant-comb-a-hairy-ball.html}}\n* {{Citation|last=Richeson|first=David S.|title=Euler's Gem: The Polyhedron Formula and the Birth of Topology|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-691-12677-1 |chapter=Combing the Hair on a Coconut |pages=202–218 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathWorld|title=Hairy Ball Theorem|id=HairyBallTheorem}}\n\n[[Category:Differential topology]]\n[[Category:Fixed points (mathematics)]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic topology]]"

      "title": "Künneth theorem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCnneth_theorem",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially in [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]], a '''Künneth theorem''', also called a '''Künneth formula''', is a statement relating the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of two objects to the homology of their product. The classical statement of the Künneth theorem relates the [[singular homology]] of two [[topological space]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' and their [[product space]] <math>X \\times Y</math>. In the simplest possible case the relationship is that of a [[tensor product]], but for applications it is very often necessary to apply certain tools of homological algebra to express the answer.\n\nA Künneth theorem or Künneth formula is true in many different homology and cohomology theories, and the name has become generic. These many results are named for the German mathematician [[Hermann Künneth]].\n\n== Singular homology with coefficients in a field ==\nLet ''X'' and ''Y'' be two topological spaces.  In general one uses singular homology; but if ''X'' and ''Y'' happen to be [[CW complex]]es, then this can be replaced by [[cellular homology]], because that is isomorphic to singular homology. The simplest case is when the coefficient ring  for homology is a field ''F''. In this situation, the Künneth theorem (for singular homology) states that for any integer ''k'',\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{i + j = k} H_i(X; F) \\otimes H_j(Y; F) \\cong H_k(X \\times Y; F)</math>.\n\nFurthermore, the isomorphism is a [[natural isomorphism]]. The map from the sum to the homology group of the product is called the ''cross product''. More precisely, there is a cross product operation by which an ''i''-cycle on ''X'' and a ''j''-cycle on ''Y'' can be combined to create an  <math>(i+j)</math>-cycle on <math>X \\times Y</math>; so that there is an explicit linear mapping defined from the direct sum to <math>H_k(X \\times Y)</math>.\n\nA consequence of this result is that the [[Betti number]]s, the dimensions of the homology with <math>\\Q</math> coefficients, of <math>X \\times Y</math> can be determined from those of ''X'' and ''Y''. If <math>p_Z(t)</math> is the [[generating function]] of the sequence of Betti numbers <math>b_k(Z)</math> of a space ''Z'', then\n\n: <math>p_{X \\times Y}(t) = p_X(t) p_Y(t).</math>\n\nHere when there are finitely many Betti numbers of ''X'' and ''Y'', each of which is a [[natural number]] rather than <math>\\infty</math>, this reads as an identity on [[Poincaré polynomial]]s. In the general case these are [[formal power series]] with possibly infinite coefficients, and have to be interpreted accordingly. Furthermore, the above statement holds not only for the Betti numbers but also for the generating functions of the dimensions of the homology over any field. (If the integer homology is not [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]], then these numbers may differ from the standard Betti numbers.)\n\n== Singular homology with coefficients in a principal ideal domain ==\nThe above formula is simple because vector spaces over a field have very restricted behavior. As the coefficient ring becomes more general, the relationship becomes more complicated. The next simplest case is the case when the coefficient ring is a [[principal ideal domain]]. This case is particularly important because the integers <math>\\Z</math> are a PID.\n\nIn this case the equation above is no longer always true. A correction factor appears to account for the possibility of torsion phenomena. This correction factor is expressed in terms of the [[Tor functor]], the first [[derived functor]] of the tensor product.\n\nWhen ''R'' is a PID, then the correct statement of the Künneth theorem is that for any topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' there are natural [[short exact sequence]]s\n\n:<math>0 \\to \\bigoplus_{i + j = k} H_i(X; R) \\otimes_R H_j(Y; R) \\to H_k(X \\times Y; R) \\to \\bigoplus_{i + j = k-1} \\mathrm{Tor}_1^R(H_i(X; R), H_j(Y; R)) \\to 0.</math>\n\nFurthermore, these sequences [[split (mathematics)|split]], but not [[canonical form|canonically]].\n\n=== Example ===\nThe short exact sequences just described can easily be used to compute the homology groups with integer coefficients of the product <math>\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{RP}^2</math> of two [[real projective plane]]s, in other words, <math>H_k(\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{RP}^2; \\Z)</math>. These spaces are [[CW complex]]es. Denoting the homology group <math>H_i(\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\Z)</math>  by <math>h_i</math> for brevity's sake, one knows from a simple calculation with [[cellular homology]] that \n:<math>h_0\\cong \\Z</math>, \n:<math>h_1\\cong \\Z/2\\Z</math>,\n:<math>h_i= 0</math> for all other values of ''i''. \nThe only non-zero [[Tor functor|Tor group]] (torsion product) which can be formed from these values of <math>h_i</math> is \n:<math>\\mathrm{Tor}^{\\Z}_1(h_1, h_1) \\cong \\mathrm{Tor}^{\\Z}_1(\\Z/2\\Z,\\Z/2\\Z)\\cong \\Z/2\\Z</math>.\nTherefore, the Künneth short exact sequence reduces in every degree to an isomorphism, because there is a zero group in each case on either the left or the right side in the sequence. The result is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nH_0 \\left (\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{RP}^2;\\Z \\right )\\; &\\cong \\;h_0 \\otimes h_0 \\;\\cong \\;\\Z \\\\\nH_1 \\left (\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{RP}^2;\\Z \\right )\\; &\\cong \\; h_0 \\otimes h_1 \\; \\oplus \\; h_1 \\otimes h_0 \\;\\cong \\;\\Z/2\\Z\\oplus \\Z/2\\Z  \\\\\nH_2 \\left (\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{RP}^2;\\Z  \\right )\\; &\\cong \\;h_1 \\otimes h_1 \\;\\cong \\;\\Z/2\\Z \\\\\nH_3 \\left (\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{RP}^2;\\Z \\right )\\; &\\cong \\;\\mathrm{Tor}^{\\Z}_1(h_1,h_1) \\;\\cong \\;\\Z/2\\Z \\\\\n\\end{align} </math>\nand all the other homology groups are zero.\n\n== The Künneth spectral sequence ==\nFor a general commutative ring ''R'', the homology of ''X'' and ''Y'' is related to the homology of their product by a  Künneth [[spectral sequence]] \n:<math>E_{pq}^2 = \\bigoplus_{q_1 + q_2 = q} \\mathrm{Tor}^R_p(H_{q_1}(X; R), H_{q_2}(Y; R)) \\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(X \\times Y; R).</math> \nIn the cases described above, this spectral sequence collapses to give an isomorphism or a short exact sequence.\n\n== Relation with homological algebra, and idea of proof ==\nThe chain complex of the space ''X'' × ''Y'' is related to the chain complexes of ''X'' and ''Y'' by a natural [[quasi-isomorphism]]\n:<math>C_*(X \\times Y) \\cong C_*(X) \\otimes C_*(Y).</math>\nFor singular chains this is the [[Eilenberg–Zilber theorem|theorem of Eilenberg and Zilber]]. For cellular chains on CW complexes, it is a straightforward isomorphism.  Then the homology of the tensor product on the right is given by the spectral Künneth formula of homological algebra.<ref>See final chapter of {{citation |last=Mac Lane |first=Saunders |title=Homology |year=1963 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-03823-X }}</ref>\n\nThe freeness of the chain modules means that in this geometric case it is not necessary to use any hyperhomology or total derived tensor product.\n\nThere are analogues of the above statements for [[singular cohomology]] and [[sheaf cohomology]]. For sheaf cohomology on an algebraic variety, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] found six spectral sequences relating the possible [[hyperhomology]] groups of two chain complexes of sheaves and the hyperhomology groups of their tensor product.<ref>{{citation |last=Grothendieck |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck |authorlink2=Jean Dieudonné |last2=Dieudonné |first2=Jean |year=1963 |title=Éléments de géométrie algébrique (rédigés avec la collaboration de Jean Dieudonné): III.

[[K-theory]] and [[cobordism]] are the best-known. Unlike ordinary homology and cohomology, they typically cannot be defined using chain complexes. Thus Künneth theorems can not be obtained by the above methods of homological algebra.  Nevertheless, Künneth theorems in just the same form have been proved in very many cases by various other methods.  The first were [[Michael Atiyah]]'s Künneth theorem for complex K-theory and [[Pierre Conner]] and [[Edwin E.

It is named after [[Solomon Lefschetz]], who first stated it in 1926.\n\nThe counting is subject to an imputed [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] at a fixed point called the [[fixed point index]]. A weak version of the theorem is enough to show that a mapping without ''any'' fixed point must have rather special topological properties (like a rotation of a circle).\n\n==Formal statement==\nFor a formal statement of the theorem, let\n\n:<math>f\\colon X \\rightarrow X\\,</math>\n\nbe a [[continuous map]] from a compact [[triangulable space]] <math>X</math> to itself. Define the '''Lefschetz number''' <math>\\Lambda_f</math> of <math>f</math> by \n\n:<math>\\Lambda_f:=\\sum_{k\\geq 0}(-1)^k\\mathrm{tr}(f_*|H_k(X,\\Q)),</math>\n\nthe alternating (finite) sum of the [[matrix trace]]s of the linear maps [[Singular homology#Functoriality|induced]] by <math>f</math> on <math>H_k(X,\\Q)</math>, the [[singular homology]] groups of <math>X</math> with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients. \n\nA simple version of the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem states: if\n\n:<math>\\Lambda_f \\neq 0\\,</math>\n\nthen <math>f</math> has at least one fixed point, i.e., there exists at least one ''x'' in <math>X</math> such that <math>f(x) = x</math>.  In fact, since the Lefschetz number has been defined at the homology level, the conclusion can be extended to say that any map [[homotopic]] to <math>f</math> has a fixed point as well.\n\nNote however that the converse is not true in general: <math>\\Lambda_f</math> may be zero even if ''f'' has fixed points.\n\n== Sketch of a proof ==\nFirst, by applying the [[simplicial approximation theorem]], one shows that if <math>f</math> has no fixed points, then (possibly after subdividing ''X'') <math>f</math> is homotopic to a fixed-point-free [[simplicial map]] (i.e., it sends each simplex to a different simplex).  This means that the diagonal values of the matrices of the linear maps induced on the [[Simplicial homology|simplicial chain complex]] of ''X'' must be all be zero.  Then one notes that, in general, the Lefschetz number can also be computed using the alternating sum of the matrix traces of the aforementioned linear maps (this is true for almost exactly the same reason that the [[Euler characteristic#Topological definition|Euler characteristic has a definition in terms of homology groups]]; see [[#Relation to the Euler characteristic|below]] for the relation to the Euler characteristic).  In the particular case of a fixed-point-free simplicial map, all of the diagonal values are zero, and thus the traces are all zero.\n\n== Lefschetz–Hopf theorem ==\nA stronger form of the theorem, also known as the '''Lefschetz–Hopf theorem''', states that, if <math>f</math> has only finitely many fixed points, then \n\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in \\mathrm{Fix}(f)} i(f,x) = \\Lambda_f,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathrm{Fix}(f)</math> is the set of fixed points of <math>f</math>, and <math>i(f,x)</math> denotes the [[fixed point index|index]] of the fixed point ''x''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Dold | first=Albrecht | authorlink=Albrecht Dold| title=Lectures on algebraic topology | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd  | isbn=978-3-540-10369-1 |mr=606196 | year=1980 | volume=200 | postscript=<!--None-->}}, Proposition VII.6.6.</ref> From this theorem one deduces the [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]] for vector fields.\n\n==Relation to the Euler characteristic==\nThe Lefschetz number of the [[identity function|identity map]] on a finite [[CW complex]] can be easily computed by realizing that each <math>f_\\ast</math> can be thought of as an identity matrix, and so each trace term is simply the dimension of the appropriate homology group. Thus the Lefschetz number of the identity map is equal to the alternating sum of the [[Betti number]]s of the space, which in turn is equal to the [[Euler characteristic]] <math>\\chi(X)</math>. Thus we have\n:<math>\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{id}} = \\chi(X).\\ </math>\n\n==Relation to the Brouwer fixed point theorem==\nThe Lefschetz fixed point theorem generalizes the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], which states that every continuous map from the ''n''-dimensional [[unit disk|closed unit disk]] <math>D^n</math> to <math>D^n</math> must have at least one fixed point. \n\nThis can be seen as follows: <math>D^n</math> is compact and triangulable, all its homology groups except <math>H_0</math> are zero, and every continuous map <math>f\\colon D^n \\to D^n</math> induces the identity map <math>f_* \\colon H_0(D^n, \\Q) \\to H_0(D^n, \\Q)</math>, whose trace is one; all this together implies that <math>\\Lambda_f</math> is non-zero for any continuous map <math>f\\colon D^n \\to D^n</math>.\n\n==Historical context==\nLefschetz presented his fixed point theorem in {{harv|Lefschetz|1926}}. Lefschetz's focus was not on fixed points of maps, but rather on what are now called [[coincidence point]]s of maps. \n\nGiven two maps ''f'' and ''g'' from an orientable [[manifold]] ''X'' to an orientable manifold ''Y'' of the same dimension, the ''Lefschetz coincidence number'' of ''f'' and ''g'' is defined as\n\n:<math>\\Lambda_{f,g} = \\sum (-1)^k \\mathrm{tr}( D_X \\circ g^* \\circ D_Y^{-1} \\circ f_*),</math>\n\nwhere <math>f_*</math> is as above, <math>g_*</math> is the homomorphism induced by <math>g</math> on the [[cohomology]] groups with rational coefficients, and <math>D_X</math> and <math>D_X</math> are the [[Poincaré duality]] isomorphisms for ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively.\n\nLefschetz proved that if the coincidence number is nonzero, then ''f'' and ''g'' have a coincidence point. He noted in his paper that letting <math>X= Y</math> and letting ''g'' be the identity map gives a simpler result, which we now know as the fixed point theorem.\n\n== Frobenius ==\nLet <math>X</math> be a variety defined over the finite field <math>k</math> with <math>q</math> elements and let <math>\\bar X</math> be the lift of <math>X</math> to the algebraic closure of <math>k</math>. The '''[[Frobenius endomorphism]]''' of <math>\\bar X</math> (often the ''geometric Frobenius'', or just ''the Frobenius''), denoted by  <math>F_q</math>, maps a point with coordinates <math>x_1,\\ldots,x_n</math> to the point with coordinates <math>x_1^q,\\ldots,x_n^q</math>. Thus the fixed points of <math>F_q</math> are exactly the points of <math>X</math> with coordinates in <math>k</math>; the set of such points is denoted by <math>X(k)</math>.  The Lefschetz trace formula holds in this context, and reads:\n\n:<math>\\#X(k)=\\sum_i (-1)^i \\mathrm{tr} F_q| H^i_c(\\bar{X},\\Q_{\\ell}).</math>\n\nThis formula involves the trace of the Frobenius on the étale cohomology, with compact supports, of <math>\\bar X</math> with values in the field of <math>\\ell</math>-adic numbers, where <math>\\ell</math> is a prime coprime to <math>q</math>. \n\nIf <math>X</math> is smooth and [[equidimensionality|equidimensional]], this formula can be rewritten in terms of the ''arithmetic Frobenius'' <math>\\Phi_q</math>, which acts as the inverse of <math>F_q</math> on cohomology:\n\n:<math>\\#X(k)=q^{\\dim X}\\sum_i (-1)^i \\mathrm{tr} \\Phi_q^{-1}| H^i(\\bar X,\\Q_\\ell).</math>\n\nThis formula involves usual cohomology, rather than cohomology with compact supports.\n\nThe Lefschetz trace formula can also be generalized to [[algebraic stack]]s over finite fields.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Fixed point theorem]]s\n*[[Lefschetz zeta function]]\n*[[Holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point formula]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | first=Solomon|last= Lefschetz|authorlink=Solomon Lefschetz | title=Intersections and transformations of complexes and manifolds | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | year=1926 | volume=28 | pages=1–49 | doi=10.2307/1989171 | issue=1|mr=1501331 }}\n* {{cite journal |  first=Solomon|last= Lefschetz|authorlink=Solomon Lefschetz| title=On the fixed point formula | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | year=1937 | volume=38 | pages=819–822 | doi=10.2307/1968838 | issue=4|mr=1503373 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Lefschetz formula|id=p/l057980}}\n\n[[Category:Fixed-point theorems]]\n[[Category:Continuous mappings]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic topology]]"

This problem can be resolved by working with the [[fundamental groupoid]] <math>\\pi_1(X,A)</math> on a ''set A'' of base points, chosen according to the geometry of the situation. Thus for the circle, one uses two base points.<ref>http://planetmath.org/vankampenstheorem R. Brown, Groupoids and Van Kampen's theorem, ''Proc. London Math. Soc''.

For example, consider the sphere <math>S^2</math>. Pick open sets <math>A=S^2\\setminus \\{n\\} </math> and <math>B=S^2\\setminus \\{s\\}</math> where ''n'' and ''s'' denote the north and south poles respectively. Then we have the property that ''A'', ''B'' and ''A'' ∩ ''B'' are open path connected sets. Thus we can see that there is a commutative diagram including ''A'' ∩ ''B'' into ''A'' and ''B'' and then another inclusion from ''A'' and ''B'' into <math>S^2</math> and that there is a corresponding diagram of homomorphisms between the fundamental groups of each subspace. Applying Van Kampen's theorem gives the result\n\n:<math>\\pi_1(S^2)=\\pi_1(A)\\cdot\\pi_1(B)/\\ker(\\Phi).</math>\n\nHowever ''A'' and ''B'' are both homeomorphic to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> which is simply connected, so both ''A'' and ''B'' have trivial fundamental groups. It is clear from this that the fundamental group of <math>S^2</math> is trivial.\n\n=== Wedge Sum of Spaces ===\nGiven two based spaces <math>(X,x)</math> and <math>(Y,y)</math> we can form their wedge <math>(X\\vee Y,p)</math> by taking the quotient of <math>X \\coprod Y</math> by identifying their two basepoints. Since the fundamental group of a point is trivial, the Van Kampen theorem shows that\n:<math>\n\\pi_1(X\\vee Y,p) \\cong \\pi_1(X,x)*\\pi_1(Y,y)\n</math>\nis an isomorphism of groups.\n\n=== Orientable Genus g Surfaces ===\n\nA more complicated example is the calculation of the fundamental group of a [[genus (mathematics)#Orientable surface|genus ''n'' orientable surface]] ''S'', otherwise known as the ''genus n surface group''. One can construct ''S'' using its [[Fundamental polygon#Standard fundamental polygons|standard fundamental polygon]]. For the first open set ''A'', pick a disk within the center of the polygon. Pick ''B'' to be the complement in ''S'' of the center point of ''A''. Then the intersection of ''A'' and ''B'' is an annulus, which is known to be [[homotopy equivalent]] to (and so has the same fundamental group as) a circle. Then <math>\\pi_1(A \\cap B)=\\pi_1(S^1)</math>, which is the integers, and <math>\\pi_1(A)=\\pi_1(D^2)={1}</math>. Thus the inclusion of <math>\\pi_1(A \\cap  B)</math> into <math>\\pi_1(A)</math> sends any generator to the trivial element. However, the inclusion of <math>\\pi_1(A \\cap  B)</math> into <math>\\pi_1(B)</math> is not trivial. In order to understand this, first one must calculate <math>\\pi_1(B)</math>. This is easily done as one can [[deformation retract]] ''B'' (which is ''S'' with one point deleted) onto the edges labeled by\n\n:<math> A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1} A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1} \\cdots A_n B_n A_n^{-1} B_n^{-1}.</math>\n\nThis space is known to be the [[wedge sum]] of 2''n'' circles (also called a [[bouquet of circles]]), which further is known to have fundamental group isomorphic to the [[free group]] with 2''n'' generators, which in this case can be represented by the edges themselves: <math>\\{A_1,B_1,\\cdots,A_n,B_n\\}</math>. We now have enough information to apply Van Kampen's theorem. The generators are the loops <math>\\{A_1,B_1,\\cdots,A_n,B_n\\}</math> (''A'' is simply connected, so it contributes no generators) and there is exactly one relation:\n\n:<math>A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1} A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1} \\cdots A_n B_n A_n^{-1} B_n^{-1} = 1.</math>\n\nUsing generators and relations, this group is denoted\n\n:<math>\\left \\langle A_1,B_1,\\cdots,A_n,B_n\\left | A_1B_1A_1^{-1}B_1^{-1}\\cdots A_nB_nA_n^{-1}B_n^{-1}\\right. \\right \\rangle.</math>\n\n==Generalizations==\nAs explained above, this theorem was  extended by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] to the non-connected case by using the fundamental groupoid <math>\\pi_1 (X,A)</math> on a set ''A'' of base points.  The theorem for arbitrary covers, with the restriction that ''A'' meets all threefold intersections of the sets of the cover, is given in the paper by Brown and Abdul Razak Salleh.<ref>Brown, Ronald and Razak Salleh, Abdul, \"A van Kampen theorem for unions of nonconnected spaces\". [[Archiv der Mathematik]] (Basel) 42 (1984), no. 1, 85–88.</ref>  The theorem and  proof for the fundamental group, but using some groupoid methods, are also given in  [[J. Peter May]]'s book.<ref>May, J.

      "title": "Serre–Swan theorem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre%E2%80%93Swan_theorem",
      "text": "In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[topology]] and [[K-theory]], the '''Serre–Swan theorem''', also called '''Swan's theorem''', relates the geometric notion of [[vector bundle]]s to the algebraic concept of [[projective module]]s and gives rise to a common intuition throughout [[mathematics]]: \"projective modules over [[commutative ring]]s are like vector bundles on compact spaces\".\n\nThe two precise formulations of the theorems differ somewhat. The original theorem, as stated by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in 1955, is more algebraic in nature, and concerns vector bundles on an [[algebraic variety]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] (of any [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]). The complementary variant stated by [[Richard Swan]] in 1962 is more analytic, and concerns (real, complex, or quaternionic) vector bundles on a [[smooth manifold]] or [[Hausdorff space]].\n\n== Differential geometry ==\nSuppose ''M'' is a [[smooth manifold]] (not necessarily compact), and a ''E'' is a [[smooth vector bundle]] over ''M''. Then ''Γ(E)'', the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth sections]] of ''E'', is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over C<sup>∞</sup>(''M'') (the commutative algebra of smooth real-valued functions on ''M''). Swan's theorem states that this module is [[finitely-generated module|finitely generated]] and [[projective module|projective]] over C<sup>∞</sup>(''M''). In other words, every vector bundle is a direct summand of some trivial bundle: <math>M \\times \\R^k</math> for some ''k''. The theorem can be proved by constructing a bundle epimorphism from a trivial bundle <math>M \\times \\R^k \\to E.</math> This can be done by, for instance, exhibiting sections ''s''<sub>1</sub>...''s''<sub>''k''</sub> with the property that for each point ''p'', {''s''<sub>''i''</sub>(''p'')} span the fiber over ''p''. \n\nWhen ''M'' is [[connected space|connected]], the converse is also true: every [[finitely generated projective module]] over C<sup>∞</sup>(''M'') arises in this way from some smooth vector bundle on ''M''. Such a module can be viewed as a smooth function ''f'' on ''M'' with values in the ''n'' &times; ''n'' idempotent matrices for some ''n''. The fiber of the corresponding vector bundle over ''x'' is then the range of ''f''(''x''). If ''M'' is not connected, the converse does not hold unless one allows for vector bundles of non-constant rank (which means admitting manifolds of non-constant dimension). For example, if ''M'' is a zero-dimensional 2-point manifold, the module <math>\\R\\oplus 0</math> is finitely-generated and projective over <math>C^\\infty(M)\\cong\\R\\times\\R</math> but is not [[free module|free]], and so cannot correspond to the sections of any (constant-rank) vector bundle over ''M'' (all of which are trivial).\n\nAnother way of stating the above is that for any connected smooth manifold ''M'', the section [[functor]] ''Γ'' from the [[category theory|category]] of smooth vector bundles over ''M'' to the category of finitely generated, projective C<sup>∞</sup>(''M'')-modules is [[full functor|full]], [[faithful functor|faithful]], and [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]. Therefore the category of smooth vector bundles on ''M'' is [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of finitely generated, projective C<sup>∞</sup>(''M'')-modules. Details may be found in {{harv|Nestruev|2003}}.\n\n== Topology ==\nSuppose ''X'' is a compact [[Hausdorff space]], and C(''X'') is the ring of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] real-valued functions on ''X''. Analogous to the result above, the category of real vector bundles on ''X'' is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective modules over C(''X''). The same result holds if one replaces \"real-valued\" by \"complex-valued\" and \"real vector bundle\" by \"complex vector bundle\", but it does not hold if one replace the field by a [[totally disconnected]] field like the [[rational number]]s.\n\nIn detail, let Vec(''X'') be the [[category theory|category]] of [[complex vector bundle]]s over ''X'', and let ProjMod(C(''X'')) be the category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] projective modules over the [[Cstar algebra|C*-algebra]] C(''X''). There is a [[functor]] Γ : Vec(''X'') → ProjMod(C(''X'')) which sends each complex vector bundle ''E'' over ''X'' to the C(''X'')-module Γ(''X'', ''E'') of [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]]. If <math>\\tau : (E_1, \\pi_1) \\to (E_2, \\pi_2)</math> is a [[Vector bundle#Vector bundle morphisms|morphism of vector bundles over ''X'']] then <math>\\pi_2 \\circ \\tau = \\pi_1</math> and it follows that\n\n:<math>\\forall s \\in \\Gamma(X, E_1) \\quad \\pi_2 \\circ \\tau \\circ s = \\pi_1 \\circ s = \\text{id}_X,</math>\n\ngiving the map \n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} \\Gamma \\tau : \\Gamma(X, E_1) \\to \\Gamma(X, E_2) \\\\ s \\mapsto \\tau \\circ s \\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhich respects the module structure {{abbr|(Várilly, 97)|Várilly, Josef C. (1997), ''An introduction to noncommutative geometry'', eprint arXiv:physics/9709045v1 [math-ph]: 6-7. Retrieved 4 June 2015.}}. Swan's theorem asserts that the functor Γ is an [[equivalence of categories]].\n\n==Algebraic geometry==\nThe analogous result in [[algebraic geometry]], due to {{harvtxt|Serre|1955|loc=§50}} applies to vector bundles in the category of [[affine variety|affine varieties]].  Let ''X'' be an affine variety with structure sheaf <math>\\mathcal{O}_X,</math> and <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> a [[coherent sheaf]] of <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> -modules on ''X''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''simplicial approximation theorem''' is a foundational result for [[algebraic topology]], guaranteeing that [[continuous mapping]]s can be (by a slight deformation) approximated by ones that are [[piecewise]] of the simplest kind. It applies to mappings between spaces that are built up from [[simplex|simplices]]&mdash;that is, finite [[simplicial complex]]es. The general continuous mapping between such spaces can be represented approximately by the type of mapping that is (''affine''-) linear on each simplex into another simplex, at the cost (i) of sufficient [[barycentric subdivision]] of the simplices of the domain, and (ii) replacement of the actual mapping by a [[homotopic]] one.\n\nThis theorem was first proved by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], by use of the [[Lebesgue covering theorem]] (a result based on [[compactness]]). It served to put the [[homology theory]] of the time&mdash;the first decade of the twentieth century&mdash;on a rigorous basis, since it showed that the topological effect (on [[homology group]]s) of continuous mappings could in a given case be expressed in a [[finitary]] way. This must be seen against the background of a realisation at the time that continuity was in general compatible with the [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], in some other areas.

For instance,  the ''integral [[homology theory]]'' of a [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}, and its ''homology with coefficients'' in any [[abelian group]] {{mvar|A}} are related as follows: the integral homology groups\n\n:{{math|''H''<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''; '''Z''')}}\n\ncompletely determine the groups\n\n:{{math|''H''<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''; ''A'')}}\n\nHere {{math|''H''<sub>''i''</sub>}} might be the [[simplicial homology]] or more general [[singular homology]] theory: the result itself is a pure piece of [[homological algebra]] about [[chain complex]]es of [[free abelian group]]s. The form of the result is that other [[coefficient]]s {{mvar|A}} may be used, at the cost of using a [[Tor functor]].\n\nFor example it is common to take {{mvar|A}} to be {{math|'''Z'''/2'''Z'''}}, so that coefficients are modulo 2. This becomes straightforward in the absence of 2-[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]] in the homology. Quite generally, the result indicates the relationship that holds between the [[Betti number]]s {{math|''b<sub>i</sub>''}} of {{mvar|X}} and the Betti numbers {{math|''b''<sub>''i'',''F''</sub>}} with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}}. These can differ, but only when the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of {{mvar|F}} is a [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}} for which there is some {{mvar|p}}-torsion in the homology.\n\n==Statement of the homology case ==\nConsider the [[tensor product of modules]] {{math|''H''<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''; '''Z''') ⊗ ''A''}}.
