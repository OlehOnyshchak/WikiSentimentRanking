It is also called the '''stella octangula''' (Latin for \"eight-pointed star\"), a name given to it by [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1609, though it was known to earlier [[geometer]]s. It was  depicted in [[Pacioli]]'s ''De Divina Proportione,'' 1509.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Barnes | first = John\n | contribution = Shapes and Solids\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-05092-3_2\n | pages = 25–56\n | publisher = Springer\n | title = Gems of Geometry\n | year = 2009| isbn = 978-3-642-05091-6\n }}.</ref>\n\nIt is the simplest of five regular [[polyhedral compound]]s, and the only regular [[compound of two tetrahedra]]. It is also the least dense of the regular polyhedral compounds, having a density of 2.\n\nIt can be seen as a 3D extension of the [[hexagram]]: the hexagram is a two-dimensional shape formed from two overlapping equilateral triangles, [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]] to each other, and in the same way the stellated octahedron can be formed from two centrally symmetric overlapping tetrahedra. This can be generalized to any desired amount of higher dimensions; the four-dimensional equivalent construction is the [[compound of two 5-cells]]. It can also be seen as one of the stages in the construction of a 3D [[Koch snowflake]], a fractal shape formed by repeated attachment of smaller tetrahedra to each triangular face of a larger figure. The first stage of the construction of the Koch Snowflake is a single central tetrahedron, and the second stage, formed by adding four smaller tetrahedra to the faces of the central tetrahedron, is the stellated octahedron.\n\n==Construction==\nThe stellated octahedron can be constructed in several ways:\n*It is a [[stellation]] of the [[regular octahedron]], sharing the same face planes. (See [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models#Stellations of octahedron|Wenninger model W<sub>19</sub>]].)\n{| class=wikitable width=480\n|[[File:stellated_octahedron_stellation_plane.png|140px]]<BR>In perspective||[[File:Stellation of octahedron facets.png|140px]]<BR>Stellation plane||The only stellation of a regular octahedron, with one stellation plane in yellow.\n|}\n*It is also a regular [[polyhedron compound]], when constructed as the union of two regular [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] (a regular tetrahedron and its [[Self-dual polyhedron|dual tetrahedron]]).\n*It can be obtained as an [[augmentation (geometry)|augmentation]] of the regular [[octahedron]], by adding tetrahedral [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] on each face. In this construction it has the same topology as the convex [[Catalan solid]], the [[triakis octahedron]], which has much shorter pyramids.\n*It is a [[facetting]] of the [[cube]], sharing the [[vertex arrangement]].\n*It can be seen as a {4/2} [[antiprism]]; with {4/2} being a tetragram, a compound of two dual [[digon]]s, and the tetrahedron seen as a digonal antiprism, this can be seen as a compound of two [[digonal antiprism]]s.\n*It can be seen as a [[Net (polyhedron)|net]] of a four-dimensional [[octahedral pyramid]], consisting of a central octahedron surrounded by eight tetrahedra.\n{| class=wikitable width=260\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:CubeAndStel.svg|140px]]<BR>Facetting of a cube\n|[[File:Diagonal_facet_of_cube.png|120px]]<BR>A single diagonal triangle facetting in red\n|}\n\n==Related concepts==\n[[File:Koch_cube.gif|right|150px|thumb|The stellated octahedron is the first iteration of the 3D analogue of a [[Koch snowflake]].]]\n\nA compound of two spherical tetrahedra can be constructed, as illustrated.\n\nThe two tetrahedra of the compound view of the stellated octahedron are \"desmic\", meaning that (when interpreted as a line in [[projective space]]) each edge of one tetrahedron crosses two opposite edges of the other tetrahedron. One of these two crossings is visible in the stellated octahedron; the other crossing occurs at a point at infinity of the projective space, between two parallel edges of the two tetrahedra. These two tetrahedra can be completed to a [[desmic system]] of three tetrahedra, where the third tetrahedron has as its four vertices the three crossing points at infinity and the centroid of the two finite tetrahedra. The same twelve tetrahedron vertices also form the points of [[Reye's configuration]].\n\nThe [[stella octangula number]]s are [[figurate number]]s that count the number of balls that can be arranged into the shape of a stellated octahedron. They are\n:0, 1, 14, 51, 124, 245, 426, 679, 1016, 1449, 1990, .... {{OEIS|A007588}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Spherical compound of two tetrahedra.png|left|150px|thumb|As a [[spherical tiling]], the combined edges in the compound of two tetrahedra form a [[rhombic dodecahedron]].]]\n\nThe stellated octahedron appears with several other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds in [[M.

      "text": "{{Short description|Polyhedron with 8 faces}}\n{{For|the album by The Mars Volta|Octahedron (album)}}\n{{Reg polyhedra db|Reg polyhedron stat table|O}}\nIn [[geometry]], an '''octahedron''' (plural: octahedra) is a [[polyhedron]] with eight faces, twelve edges, and six vertices.  The term is most commonly used to refer to the '''regular''' octahedron, a [[Platonic solid]] composed of eight [[equilateral triangle]]s, four of which meet at each [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]. \n\nA regular octahedron is the [[dual polyhedron]] of a [[cube]]. It is a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[tetrahedron]]. It is a square [[bipyramid]] in any of three [[orthogonal]] orientations. It is also a triangular [[antiprism]] in any of four orientations.\n\nAn octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a [[cross polytope]].\n\nA regular octahedron is a [[n-ball|3-ball]] in the [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan ({{math|''ℓ''}}{{sub|1}}) metric]].\n\n==Regular octahedron==\n\n===Dimensions===\nIf the edge length of a regular octahedron is ''a'', the [[radius]] of a circumscribed [[sphere]] (one that touches the octahedron at all vertices) is\n:<math>r_u = \\frac{a}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707 \\cdot a</math>\n\nand the radius of an inscribed sphere ([[tangent]] to each of the octahedron's faces) is\n:<math>r_i = \\frac{a}{6} \\sqrt{6}  \\approx 0.408\\cdot a</math>\n\nwhile the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is\n:<math>r_m = \\frac{a}{2} = 0.5\\cdot a</math>\n\n===Orthogonal projections===\nThe ''octahedron'' has four special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered, on an edge, vertex, face, and normal to a face. The second and third correspond to the B<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> [[Coxeter plane]]s.\n{|class=wikitable width=480\n|+ Orthogonal projections\n|-\n!Centered by\n!Edge\n!Face<BR>Normal\n!Vertex\n!Face\n|-\n!Image\n|[[File:Cube t2 e.png|100px]]\n|[[File:Cube t2 fb.png|100px]]\n|[[File:3-cube t2 B2.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:3-cube t2.svg|100px]]\n|- align=center\n!Projective<BR>symmetry\n|[2]\n|[2]\n|[4]\n|[6]\n|}\n\n===Spherical tiling===\nThe octahedron can also be represented as a [[spherical tiling]], and projected onto the plane via a [[stereographic projection]]. This projection is [[Conformal map|conformal]], preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.\n{|class=wikitable\n|- align=center valign=top\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 432-t2.png|160px]]\n|[[File:Octahedron stereographic projection.svg|160px]]\n|-\n![[Orthographic projection]]\n!colspan=1|[[Stereographic projection]]\n|}\n\n===Cartesian coordinates===\n\nAn octahedron with edge length {{sqrt|2}} can be placed with its center at the origin and its vertices on the coordinate axes; the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vertices are then\n: ( ±1, 0, 0 );\n: ( 0, ±1, 0 );\n: ( 0, 0, ±1 ).\n\nIn an ''x''–''y''–''z'' [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the octahedron with center [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') and radius ''r'' is the set of all points (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') such that\n:<math>\\left|x - a\\right| + \\left|y - b\\right| + \\left|z - c\\right| = r.</math>\n\n===Area and volume===\nThe surface area ''A'' and the [[volume]] ''V'' of a regular octahedron of edge length ''a'' are:\n:<math>A=2\\sqrt{3}a^2 \\approx 3.464a^2</math>\n:<math>V=\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{2}a^3 \\approx 0.471a^3</math>\n\nThus the volume is four times that of a regular [[tetrahedron]] with the same edge length, while the surface area is twice (because we have 8 rather than 4 triangles).\n\nIf an octahedron has been stretched so that it obeys the equation\n:<math>\\left|\\frac{x}{x_m}\\right|+\\left|\\frac{y}{y_m}\\right|+\\left|\\frac{z}{z_m}\\right| = 1,</math>\n\nthe formulas for the surface area and volume expand to become\n:<math>A=4 \\, x_m \\, y_m \\, z_m \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x_m^2}+\\frac{1}{y_m^2}+\\frac{1}{z_m^2}},</math>\n:<math>V=\\frac{4}{3}\\,x_m\\,y_m\\,z_m.</math>\n\nAdditionally the inertia tensor of the stretched octahedron is\n:<math>\nI =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\frac{1}{10} m (y_m^2+z_m^2) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & \\frac{1}{10} m (x_m^2+z_m^2) & 0 \\\\ \n  0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{10} m (x_m^2-y_m^2)\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThese reduce to the equations for the regular octahedron when\n:<math>x_m=y_m=z_m=a\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.</math>\n\n===Geometric relations===\n[[File:Compound of two tetrahedra.png|left|thumb|The octahedron represents the central intersection of two tetrahedra]]\nThe interior of the [[polyhedral compound|compound]] of two dual [[tetrahedra]] is an octahedron, and this compound, called the [[stella octangula]], is its first and only [[stellation]]. Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. [[Rectification (geometry)|rectifying]] the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the [[cuboctahedron]] and [[icosidodecahedron]] relate to the other Platonic solids. One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the [[golden ratio|golden mean]] to define the vertices of an [[icosahedron]]. This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. There are five octahedra that define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a ''regular compound''.\n\n[[Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb|Octahedra and tetrahedra]] can be alternated to form a vertex, edge, and face-uniform [[tessellation of space]], called the [[octet truss]] by [[Buckminster Fuller]]. This is the only such tiling save the regular tessellation of [[cube]]s, and is one of the 28 [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s. Another is a tessellation of octahedra and [[cuboctahedra]].\n\nThe octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any of the faces.\n\nUsing the standard nomenclature for [[Johnson solid]]s, an octahedron would be called a ''square bipyramid''. Truncation of two opposite vertices results in a [[square bifrustum]].\n\nThe octahedron is [[k-vertex-connected graph|4-connected]], meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected [[simplicial polytope|simplicial]] [[well-covered graph|well-covered]] polyhedra, meaning that all of the [[maximal independent set]]s of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the [[pentagonal dipyramid]], the [[snub disphenoid]], and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Finbow |first1=Arthur S. |last2=Hartnell |first2=Bert L. |last3=Nowakowski |first3=Richard J. |last4=Plummer |first4=Michael D. |author4-link=Michael D.

It is one of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, and the one with the most sides.\n\nIt has five equilateral triangular faces meeting at each vertex. It is represented by its [[Schläfli symbol]] {3,5}, or sometimes by its [[vertex figure]] as 3.3.3.3.3 or 3<sup>5</sup>. It is the [[dual polyhedron|dual]] of the [[Regular dodecahedron|dodecahedron]], which is represented by {5,3}, having three pentagonal faces around each vertex.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a [[Johnson solid#Names|gyroelongated]] [[pentagonal bipyramid]] and a biaugmented [[pentagonal antiprism]] in any of six orientations.\n\nThe name comes {{ety|gre|''εἴκοσι'' (eíkosi)|twenty||''ἕδρα'' (hédra)|seat}}.

This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly subdividing each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. The [[Compound of five octahedra|five octahedra]] defining any given icosahedron form a regular [[polyhedral compound]], while the [[compound of two icosahedra|two icosahedra]] that can be defined in this way from any given octahedron form a [[uniform polyhedron compound]].\n\n[[File:Вписанный правильный икосаэдр и четыре плоскости.gif|thumb|right|Regular icosahedron and its [[circumscribed sphere]].

If two vertices are taken to be at the north and south poles (latitude ±90°), then the other ten vertices are at latitude ±[[arctan]]({{sfrac|1|2}}) ≈ ±26.57°.

Indeed, intersecting such a system of equiangular lines with a Euclidean sphere centered at their common intersection yields the twelve vertices of a regular icosahedron as can easily be checked. Conversely, supposing the existence of a regular icosahedron, lines defined by its six pairs of opposite vertices form an equiangular system.\n\nIn order to construct such an equiangular system, we start with this 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;6 square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n:<math>A=\\left(\\begin{array}{crrrrr}\n0&1&1&1&1&1\\\\\n1&0&1&-1&-1&1\\\\\n1&1&0&1&-1&-1\\\\\n1&-1&1&0&1&-1\\\\\n1&-1&-1&1&0&1\\\\\n1&1&-1&-1&1&0\\end{array}\\right).</math>\n\nA straightforward computation yields {{nowrap|''A''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 5''{{math|I}}''}} (where ''{{math|I}}'' is the 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;6 identity matrix). This implies that ''A'' has [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] –{{sqrt|5}} and {{sqrt|5}}, both with multiplicity 3 since ''A'' is [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and of [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] zero.\n\nThe matrix {{nowrap|''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}''}} induces thus a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean structure]] on the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] {{nowrap|{{math|ℝ}}{{sup|6}} / ker(''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}'')}}, which is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|ℝ}}{{sup|3}} since the [[Kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] {{nowrap|ker(''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}'')}} of {{nowrap|''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}''}} has [[dimension]] 3. The image under the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] {{nowrap|{{pi}} : {{math|ℝ}}{{sup|6}} → {{math|ℝ}}{{sup|6}} / ker(''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}'')}} of the six coordinate axes {{math|ℝ}}''v''{{sub|1}}, …, {{math|ℝ}}''v''{{sub|6}} in {{math|ℝ}}{{sup|6}} forms thus a system of six equiangular lines in {{math|ℝ}}{{sup|3}} intersecting pairwise at a common acute angle of arccos&nbsp;{{frac|1|{{sqrt|5}}}}. Orthogonal projection of ±''v''<sub>1</sub>, …, ±''v''<sub>6</sub> onto the [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|{{sqrt|5}}-eigenspace]] of ''A'' yields thus the twelve vertices of the icosahedron.\n\nA second straightforward construction of the icosahedron uses [[Group representation|representation theory]] of the [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>5</sub> acting by direct [[Isometry|isometries]] on the icosahedron.\n\n==Symmetry==\n[[File:Sphere symmetry group ih.png|thumb|Full [[Icosahedral symmetry]] has 15 mirror planes (seen as cyan [[great circle]]s on this sphere) meeting at order {{sfrac|{{pi}}|5}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} angles, dividing a sphere into 120 triangle [[fundamental domain]]s. There are 6 5-fold axes (blue), 10 3-fold axes (red), and 15 2-fold axes (magenta). The vertices of the regular icosahedron exist at the 5-fold rotation axis points.]]\n{{main|Icosahedral symmetry}}\nThe rotational [[symmetry group]] of the regular icosahedron is [[isomorphic]] to the [[alternating group]] on five letters. This non-[[abelian group|abelian]] [[simple group]] is the only non-trivial [[normal subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] on five letters. Since the [[Galois group]] of the general [[quintic equation]] is isomorphic to the symmetric group on five letters, and this normal subgroup is simple and non-abelian, the general quintic equation does not have a solution in radicals. The proof of the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] uses this simple fact, and [[Felix Klein]] wrote a book that made use of the theory of icosahedral symmetries to derive an analytical solution to the general quintic equation, {{Harv|Klein|1884}}. See [[Icosahedral symmetry#Related geometries|icosahedral symmetry: related geometries]] for further history, and related symmetries on seven and eleven letters.\n\nThe full symmetry group of the icosahedron (including reflections) is known as the [[full icosahedral group]], and is isomorphic to the product of the rotational symmetry group and the group ''C''<sub>2</sub> of size two, which is generated by the reflection through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n==Stellations==\nThe icosahedron has a large number of [[stellation]]s. According to specific rules defined in the book ''[[The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra]]'', 59 stellations were identified for the regular icosahedron. The first form is the icosahedron itself. One is a regular [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron]]. Three are [[Polyhedral compound#Regular compounds|regular compound polyhedra]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Coxeter |first1=Harold Scott MacDonald |author1-link=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter |last2=Du Val |first2=P. |last3=Flather |first3=H.T. |last4=Petrie |first4=J.F. |title=The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra |publisher=Tarquin |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-899618-32-3 |mr=676126  |year=1999}} (1st Edn University of Toronto (1938))</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ 21 of 59 stellations\n|-\n|rowspan=3 width=200|[[File:Stellation diagram of icosahedron.svg|200px]]<br>The faces of the icosahedron extended outwards as planes intersect, defining regions in space as shown by this [[stellation diagram]] of the intersections in a single plane.\n|[[Image:Zeroth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:First stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Second stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Third stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Fourth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Fifth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Sixth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Seventh stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Eighth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Ninth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Tenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Eleventh stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Twelfth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Thirteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Fourteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Fifteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Sixteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Seventeenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:First compound stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Second compound stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[Image:Third compound stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|}\n\n== Facetings==\nThe [[small stellated dodecahedron]], [[great dodecahedron]], and [[great icosahedron]] are three [[faceting]]s of the regular icosahedron. They share the same [[vertex arrangement]]. They all have 30 edges. The regular icosahedron and great dodecahedron share the same [[edge arrangement]] but differ in faces (triangles vs pentagons), as do the small stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron (pentagrams vs triangles).\n{| class=wikitable\n!Convex\n!colspan=3|Regular stars\n|-\n!'''icosahedron'''\n![[great dodecahedron]]\n![[small stellated dodecahedron]]\n![[great icosahedron]]\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Icosahedron.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Great dodecahedron.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Small stellated dodecahedron.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Great icosahedron.png|150px]]\n|}\n\n==Geometric relations==\nThere are distortions of the icosahedron that, while no longer regular, are nevertheless [[vertex-uniform]]. These are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the same [[rotation]]s as the tetrahedron, and are somewhat analogous to the [[snub cube]] and [[snub dodecahedron]], including some forms which are [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] and some with T<sub>h</sub>-symmetry, i.e. have different planes of symmetry from the tetrahedron.\n\nThe icosahedron is unique among the [[Platonic solids]] in possessing a [[dihedral angle]] not less than 120°. Its dihedral angle is approximately 138.19°. Thus, just as hexagons have angles not less than 120° and cannot be used as the faces of a convex regular polyhedron because such a construction would not meet the requirement that at least three faces meet at a vertex and leave a positive [[defect (geometry)|defect]] for folding in three dimensions, icosahedra cannot be used as the [[cell (geometry)|cells]] of a convex regular [[polychoron]] because, similarly, at least three cells must meet at an edge and leave a positive defect for folding in four dimensions (in general for a convex [[polytope]] in ''n'' dimensions, at least three [[facet (mathematics)|facets]] must meet at a [[peak (geometry)|peak]] and leave a positive defect for folding in ''n''-space). However, when combined with suitable cells having smaller dihedral angles, icosahedra can be used as cells in semi-regular polychora (for example the [[snub 24-cell]]), just as hexagons can be used as faces in semi-regular polyhedra (for example the [[truncated icosahedron]]). Finally, non-convex polytopes do not carry the same strict requirements as convex polytopes, and icosahedra are indeed the cells of the [[icosahedral 120-cell]], one of the ten [[Schläfli–Hess polychoron|non-convex regular polychora]].\n\nAn icosahedron can also be called a [[Gyroelongated dipyramid|gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid]]. It can be decomposed into a [[gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid]] and a [[pentagonal pyramid]] or into a [[pentagonal antiprism]] and two equal pentagonal pyramids.\n\n===Relation to the 6-cube and rhombic triacontahedron===\n:[[File:6demicube-odd-icosahedron.png|240px|left]]\nIt can be projected to 3D from the 6D [[6-demicube]] using the same basis vectors that form the hull of the [[Rhombic triacontahedron]] from the [[6-cube]]. Shown here including the inner 20 vertices which are not connected by the 30 outer hull edges of 6D norm length {{sqrt|2}}. The inner vertices form a [[dodecahedron]].\n\n<br>The 3D projection basis vectors [u,v,w] used are:\n:u = (1, ''φ'', 0, -1, ''φ'', 0)\n:v = (''φ'', 0, 1, ''φ'', 0, -1)\n:w = (0, 1, ''φ'', 0, -1, ''φ'')\n\n==Uniform colorings and subsymmetries==\n[[File:Icosahedral subgroup tree.png|thumb|[[Icosahedral symmetry]] subgroups]]\nThere are 3 [[uniform coloring]]s of the icosahedron.

There are other [[simplicial polyhedron|simplicial dodecahedra]], such as the [[hexagonal bipyramid]], but this is the only one that can be realized with equilateral faces. Bernal was interested in the shapes of holes left in irregular close-packed arrangements of spheres, so he used a restrictive definition of deltahedra, in which a deltahedron is a convex polyhedron with triangular faces that can be formed by the centers of a collection of congruent spheres, whose tangencies represent polyhedron edges, and such that there is no room to pack another sphere inside the cage created by this system of spheres. This restrictive definition disallows the [[triangular bipyramid]] (as forming two tetrahedral holes rather than a single hole), [[pentagonal bipyramid]] (because the spheres for its apexes interpenetrate, so it cannot occur in sphere packings), and [[icosahedron]] (because it has interior room for another sphere).

These are paths on the surface of the polyhedron that avoid the vertices and locally look like a shortest path: they follow straight line segments across each face of the polyhedron that they intersect, and when they cross an edge of the polyhedron they make complementary angles on the two incident faces to the edge. Intuitively, one could stretch a rubber band around the polyhedron along this path and it would stay in place: there is no way to locally change the path and make it shorter. For example, one type of geodesic crosses the two opposite edges of the snub disphenoid at their midpoints (where the symmetry axis exits the polytope) at an angle of {{pi}}/3. A second type of geodesic passes near the intersection of the  snub disphenoid with the plane that perpendicularly bisects the symmetry axis (the [[equator]] of the polyhedron), crossing the edges of eight triangles at angles that alternate between {{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}/6. Shifting a geodesic on the surface of the polyhedron by a small amount (small enough that the shift does not cause it to cross any vertices) preserves the property of being a geodesic and preserves its length, so both of these examples have shifted versions of the same type that are less symmetrically placed. The lengths of the five simple closed geodesics on a snub disphenoid with unit-length edges are\n:<math>2\\sqrt{3}\\approx 3.464</math> (for the equatorial geodesic), <math>\\sqrt{13}\\approx 3.606</math>, <math>4</math> (for the geodesic through the midpoints of opposite edges),  <math>2\\sqrt{7}\\approx 5.292</math>, and <math>\\sqrt{19}\\approx 4.359</math>.\nExcept for the tetrahedron, which has infinitely many types of simple closed geodesic, the snub disphenoid has the most types of geodesic of any deltahedron.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Lawson | first1 = Kyle A.\n | last2 = Parish | first2 = James L.\n | last3 = Traub | first3 = Cynthia M.\n | last4 = Weyhaupt | first4 = Adam G.\n | doi = 10.12732/ijpam.v89i2.1\n | issue = 2\n | journal = International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics\n | pages = 123–139\n | title = Coloring graphs to classify simple closed geodesics on convex deltahedra.\n | volume = 89\n | year = 2013\n | zbl = 1286.05048 }}.</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe snub disphenoid is constructed, as its name suggests, as the [[Snub_(geometry)#Coxeter.27s_snubs.2C_regular_and_quasiregular|snub]] polyhedron formed from a [[tetragonal disphenoid]], a lower symmetry form of a regular [[tetrahedron]].\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n|[[File:Digonal antiprism.png|160px]]\n|[[File:Snub digonal antiprism.png|160px]]\t\n|-\n!Disphenoid\n!Snub disphenoid\t\n|}\nThe snub operation produces a single cyclic band of triangles separating two opposite edges (red in the figure) and their adjacent triangles.

The [[Polyhedral compound|compound]] figure comprising two such dual tetrahedra form a [[stellated octahedron]] or stella octangula.\n\n===Formulas for a regular tetrahedron===<!--[[Tetrahedral angle]] redirects here-->\nThe following Cartesian coordinates define the four vertices of a tetrahedron with edge length 2, centered at the origin, and two level edges:\n:<math>\\left(\\pm 1, 0, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\left(0, \\pm 1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)</math>\n\nExpressed symmetrically as 4 points on the [[unit sphere]], centroid at the origin, with lower face level, the vertices are:\n\nv1 = ( sqrt(8/9),    0,       -1/3 )\n\nv2 = ( -sqrt(2/9),  sqrt(2/3),  -1/3 )\n\nv3 = ( -sqrt(2/9), -sqrt(2/3),  -1/3 )\n\nv4 = (   0,         0,         1  )\n\nwith the edge length of sqrt(8/3).\n\nStill another set of coordinates are based on an [[Alternation (geometry)|alternated]] [[cube]] or '''demicube''' with edge length 2.

In other words, if ''C'' is the [[centroid]] of the base, the distance from ''C'' to a vertex of the base is twice that from ''C'' to the midpoint of an edge of the base. This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which is twice as long as the other (see [[centroid#Proof that the centroid of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1|proof]]).\n\nFor a regular tetrahedron with side length ''a'', radius ''R'' of its circumscribing sphere, and distances ''d<sub>i</sub>'' from an arbitrary point in 3-space to its four vertices, we have<ref>Park, Poo-Sung. \"Regular polytope distances\", [[Forum Geometricorum]] 16, 2016, 227-232. http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2016volume16/FG201627.pdf</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\frac{d_1^4 + d_2^4 + d_3^4 + d_4^4}{4} + \\frac{16R^4}{9}&= \\left(\\frac{d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2}{4} + \\frac{2R^2}{3}\\right)^2;\\\\\n4\\left(a^4 + d_1^4 + d_2^4 + d_3^4 + d_4^4\\right) &= \\left(a^2 + d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2\\right)^2.\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Isometries of the regular tetrahedron===\n[[Image:Symmetries of the tetrahedron.svg|thumb|400px|The proper rotations, (order-3 rotation on a vertex and face, and order-2 on two edges) and reflection plane (through two faces and one edge) in the symmetry group of the regular tetrahedron]]\nThe vertices of a [[cube]] can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular tetrahedron (see above, and also [[:Image:Tetraeder animation with cube.gif|animation]], showing one of the two tetrahedra in the cube).

If all three pairs of opposite edges of a tetrahedron are [[perpendicular]], then it is called an [[orthocentric tetrahedron]]. When only one pair of opposite edges are perpendicular, it is called a '''semi-orthocentric tetrahedron'''. An '''isodynamic tetrahedron''' is one in which the [[cevian]]s that join the vertices to the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incenters]] of the opposite faces are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]], and an '''isogonic tetrahedron''' has concurrent cevians that join the vertices to the points of contact of the opposite faces with the [[inscribed sphere]] of the tetrahedron.\n\n===Isometries of irregular tetrahedra===\nThe isometries of an irregular (unmarked) tetrahedron depend on the geometry of the tetrahedron, with 7 cases possible.

Comparing this formula with that used to compute the volume of a [[parallelepiped]], we conclude that the volume of a tetrahedron is equal to {{sfrac|1|6}} of the volume of any parallelepiped that shares three converging edges with it.\n\nThe absolute value of the scalar triple product can be represented as the following absolute values of determinants:\n:<math>6 \\cdot V =\\begin{Vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{a} & \\mathbf{b} & \\mathbf{c}\n\\end{Vmatrix}</math>{{pad|2em}}or{{pad|1em}}<math>6 \\cdot V =\\begin{Vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{a} \\\\ \\mathbf{b} \\\\ \\mathbf{c}\n\\end{Vmatrix}</math>{{pad|2em}}where{{pad|1em}}<math>\\mathbf{a} = (a_1,a_2,a_3) \\,</math>{{pad|1em}}is expressed as a row or column vector etc.\n\nHence\n:<math>36 \\cdot V^2 =\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{a^2} & \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} & \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} & \\mathbf{b^2} & \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} & \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} & \\mathbf{c^2}\n\\end{vmatrix}</math>{{pad|1em}}where{{pad|1em}}<math>\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = ab\\cos{\\gamma}</math>{{pad|1em}}etc.\n\nwhich gives\n:<math>V = \\frac {abc} {6} \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos{\\alpha}\\cos{\\beta}\\cos{\\gamma}-\\cos^2{\\alpha}-\\cos^2{\\beta}-\\cos^2{\\gamma}}, \\,</math>\nwhere ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'' are the plane angles occurring in vertex '''d'''. The angle ''α'', is the angle between the two edges connecting the vertex '''d''' to the vertices '''b''' and '''c'''. The angle ''β'', does so for the vertices '''a''' and '''c''', while ''γ'', is defined by the position of the vertices '''a''' and '''b'''.\n\nGiven the distances between the vertices of a tetrahedron the volume can be computed using the [[Cayley–Menger determinant]]:\n:<math>288 \\cdot V^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  0 & 1        & 1        & 1        & 1        \\\\\n  1 & 0        & d_{12}^2 & d_{13}^2 & d_{14}^2 \\\\\n  1 & d_{12}^2 & 0        & d_{23}^2 & d_{24}^2 \\\\\n  1 & d_{13}^2 & d_{23}^2 & 0        & d_{34}^2 \\\\\n  1 & d_{14}^2 & d_{24}^2 & d_{34}^2 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}</math>\nwhere the subscripts {{nowrap|''i'', ''j'' ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}|}} represent the vertices {{nowrap|{'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''d'''}|}} and ''d{{sub|ij}}'' is the pairwise distance between them – i.e., the length of the edge connecting the two vertices. A negative value of the determinant means that a tetrahedron cannot be constructed with the given distances. This formula, sometimes called [[Tartaglia's formula]], is essentially due to the painter [[Piero della Francesca]] in the 15th century, as a three dimensional analogue of the 1st century [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle.<ref>[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath664/kmath664.htm \"Simplex Volumes and the Cayley-Menger Determinant\"], MathPages.com</ref>\n\nDenote ''a,b,c'' be three edges that meet at a point, and ''x,y,z'' the opposite edges.

A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains the centroid of an opposite edge formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of [[orthocentric tetrahedron]].\n\nAn orthogonal line dropped from the Monge point to any face meets that face at the midpoint of the line segment between that face's orthocenter and the foot of the altitude dropped from the opposite vertex.\n\nA line segment joining a vertex of a tetrahedron with the [[centroid]] of the opposite face is called a ''median'' and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a ''bimedian'' of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] at a point called the ''centroid'' of the tetrahedron.<ref>Leung, Kam-tim; and Suen, Suk-nam; \"Vectors, matrices and geometry\", Hong Kong University Press, 1994, pp. 53–54</ref> In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by the centroid (see [[Commandino's theorem]]). The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter. These points define the ''Euler line'' of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the [[Euler line]] of a triangle.\n\nThe [[nine-point circle]] of the general triangle has an analogue in the circumsphere of a tetrahedron's medial tetrahedron. It is the '''twelve-point sphere''' and besides the centroids of the four faces of the reference tetrahedron, it passes through four substitute ''Euler points'', one third of the way from the Monge point toward each of the four vertices. Finally it passes through the four base points of orthogonal lines dropped from each Euler point to the face not containing the vertex that generated the Euler point.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Outudee |first=Somluck |last2=New |first2=Stephen |title=The Various Kinds of Centres of Simplices |publisher=Dept of Mathematics, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok |url=http://www.math.sc.chula.ac.th/ICAA2002/pages/Somluck_Outudee.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227143222/http://www.math.sc.chula.ac.th/ICAA2002/pages/Somluck_Outudee.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe center ''T'' of the twelve-point sphere also lies on the Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, this center lies one third of the way from the Monge point ''M'' towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through ''T'' to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.\n\nThe radius of the twelve-point sphere is one third of the circumradius of the reference tetrahedron.\n\nThere is a relation among the angles made by the faces of a general tetrahedron given by <ref>{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Audet |title=Déterminants sphérique et hyperbolique de Cayley-Menger |url=http://archimede.mat.ulaval.ca/amq/bulletins/mai11/Chronique_note_math.mai11.pdf |publisher=Bulletin AMQ |date=May 2011 }}</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}  -1 & \\cos{(\\alpha_{12})} & \\cos{(\\alpha_{13})} & \\cos{(\\alpha_{14})}\\\\\n\\cos{(\\alpha_{12})} & -1 & \\cos{(\\alpha_{23})} & \\cos{(\\alpha_{24})} \\\\\n\\cos{(\\alpha_{13})} & \\cos{(\\alpha_{23})} & -1 & \\cos{(\\alpha_{34})} \\\\\n\\cos{(\\alpha_{14})} & \\cos{(\\alpha_{24})} & \\cos{(\\alpha_{34})} & -1 \\\\ \\end{vmatrix} = 0\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''α{{sub|ij}}'' is the angle between the faces ''i'' and ''j''.\n\n===Geometric relations===\nA tetrahedron is a 3-[[simplex]]. Unlike the case of the other Platonic solids, all the vertices of a regular tetrahedron are equidistant from each other (they are the only possible arrangement of four equidistant points in 3-dimensional space).\n\nA tetrahedron is a triangular [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], and the regular tetrahedron is [[self-dual polyhedron|self-dual]].\n\nA regular tetrahedron can be embedded inside a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] in two ways such that each vertex is a vertex of the cube, and each edge is a diagonal of one of the cube's faces. For one such embedding, the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are\n:(+1, +1, +1);\n:(−1, −1, +1);\n:(−1, +1, −1);\n:(+1, −1, −1).\n\nThis yields a tetrahedron with edge-length 2{{sqrt|2}}, centered at the origin. For the other tetrahedron (which is [[dual polyhedron|dual]] to the first), reverse all the signs. These two tetrahedra's vertices combined are the vertices of a cube, demonstrating that the regular tetrahedron is the 3-[[demicube]].\n\n[[File:Compound of two tetrahedra.png|thumb|200px|The [[stella octangula]].]]\nThe volume of this tetrahedron is one-third the volume of the cube. Combining both tetrahedra gives a regular [[polyhedral compound]] called the [[compound of two tetrahedra]] or [[stella octangula]].\n\nThe interior of the stella octangula is an [[octahedron]], and correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off, from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e., [[Rectification (geometry)|rectifying]] the tetrahedron).\n\nThe above embedding divides the cube into five tetrahedra, one of which is regular. In fact, five is the minimum number of tetrahedra required to compose a cube. To see this, note that starting from a base tetrahedron with 4 vertices, each added tetrahedra adds at most 1 new vertex, so at least 4 more must be added to make a cube, which has 8 vertices.\n\nInscribing tetrahedra inside the regular [[Polyhedral compound|compound of five cubes]] gives two more regular compounds, containing five and ten tetrahedra.\n\nRegular tetrahedra cannot [[Honeycomb (geometry)|tessellate space]] by themselves, although this result seems likely enough that [[Aristotle]] claimed it was possible. However, two regular tetrahedra can be combined with an octahedron, giving a [[rhombohedron]] that can tile space.\n\nHowever, several irregular tetrahedra are known, of which copies can tile space, for instance the [[disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb]]. The complete list remains an open problem.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.2307/2689983\n | last = Senechal | first = Marjorie | authorlink = Marjorie Senechal\n | title = Which tetrahedra fill space?\n | year = 1981\n | journal = [[Mathematics Magazine]]\n | volume = 54\n | issue = 5\n | pages = 227–243\n | publisher = Mathematical Association of America\n | jstor = 2689983\n | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

For example, one can divide an octahedron into four identical tetrahedra and combine them again with two regular ones. (As a side-note: these two kinds of tetrahedron have the same volume.)\n\nThe tetrahedron is unique among the [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]] in possessing no parallel faces.\n\n===A law of sines for tetrahedra and the space of all shapes of tetrahedra===\n[[Image:tetra.png|248px]]\n\n{{main|Trigonometry of a tetrahedron}}\n\nA corollary of the usual [[law of sines]] is that in a tetrahedron with vertices ''O'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', we have\n:<math>\\sin\\angle OAB\\cdot\\sin\\angle OBC\\cdot\\sin\\angle OCA = \\sin\\angle OAC\\cdot\\sin\\angle OCB\\cdot\\sin\\angle OBA.\\,</math>\n\nOne may view the two sides of this identity as corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise orientations of the surface.\n\nPutting any of the four vertices in the role of ''O'' yields four such identities, but at most three of them are independent: If the \"clockwise\" sides of three of them are multiplied and the product is inferred to be equal to the product of the \"counterclockwise\" sides of the same three identities, and then common factors are cancelled from both sides, the result is the fourth identity.\n\nThree angles are the angles of some triangle if and only if their sum is 180° (π radians). What condition on 12 angles is necessary and sufficient for them to be the 12 angles of some tetrahedron? Clearly the sum of the angles of any side of the tetrahedron must be 180°. Since there are four such triangles, there are four such constraints on sums of angles, and the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] is thereby reduced from 12 to 8. The four relations given by this sine law further reduce the number of degrees of freedom, from 8 down to not 4 but 5, since the fourth constraint is not independent of the first three. Thus the space of all shapes of tetrahedra is 5-dimensional.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Is There a \"Most Chiral Tetrahedron\"? |first1=André |last1=Rassat |first2=Patrick W. |last2=Fowler |journal=Chemistry: A European Journal |volume=10 |issue=24 |pages=6575–6580 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/chem.200400869 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This [[Polyhedral compound|compound]] of five tetrahedra has been known for hundreds of years. It comes up regularly in the world of [[origami]]. Joining the twenty vertices would form a regular [[dodecahedron]]. There are both [[left-handed]] and [[right-handed]] forms, which are [[mirror image]]s of each other. Superimposing both forms gives a [[compound of ten tetrahedra]], in which the ten tetrahedra are arranged as five pairs of [[stella octangula|stellae octangulae]]. A stella octangula is a compound of two tetrahedra in dual position and its eight vertices define a cube as their convex hull.\n\nThe [[square hosohedron]] is another polyhedron with four faces, but it does not have triangular faces.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Numerical analysis===\n[[File:Malla irregular de triángulos modelizando una superficie convexa.png|thumb|An irregular volume in space can be approximated by an irregular triangulated surface, and irregular tetrahedral volume elements.]]\nIn [[numerical analysis]], complicated three-dimensional shapes are commonly broken down into, or [[approximate]]d by, a [[polygon mesh|polygonal mesh]] of irregular [[tetrahedra]] in the process of setting up the equations for [[finite element analysis]] especially in the [[numerical solution]] of [[partial differential equations]]. These methods have wide applications in practical applications in [[computational fluid dynamics]], [[aerodynamics]], [[electromagnetic field]]s, [[civil engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[naval architecture|naval architecture and engineering]], and related fields.\n\n===Chemistry===\n[[Image:Ammonium-3D-balls.png|100px|thumb|The [[ammonium]] ion is tetrahedral]]\n{{main|Tetrahedral molecular geometry}}\nThe tetrahedron shape is seen in nature in [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] molecules. All [[Orbital hybridisation|sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized]] atoms are surrounded by atoms (or [[lone pair|lone electron pairs]]) at the four corners of a tetrahedron. For instance in a [[methane]] molecule ({{chem|CH|4}}) or an [[ammonium]] ion ({{chem|NH|4|+}}), four hydrogen atoms surround a central carbon or nitrogen atom with tetrahedral symmetry. For this reason, one of the leading journals in organic chemistry is called ''[[Tetrahedron (journal)|Tetrahedron]]''. The [[central angle]] between any two vertices of a perfect tetrahedron is arccos(−{{sfrac|1|3}}), or approximately 109.47°.<ref name=\"pubs.acs.org\"/>\n\n[[Water]], {{chem|H|2|O}}, also has a tetrahedral structure, with two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons around the central oxygen atoms. Its tetrahedral symmetry is not perfect, however, because the lone pairs repel more than the single O–H bonds.\n\nQuaternary [[phase diagram]]s in chemistry are represented graphically as tetrahedra.\n\nHowever, quaternary phase diagrams in [[communication engineering]] are represented graphically on a two-dimensional plane.\n\n===Electricity and electronics===\n{{main|Electricity|Electronics}}\nIf six equal [[resistor]]s are [[solder]]ed together to form a tetrahedron, then the resistance measured between any two vertices is half that of one resistor.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Douglas J. |year=2002 |title=Resistance-Distance Sum Rules |journal=Croatica Chemica Acta |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=633–649 |url=http://jagor.srce.hr/ccacaa/CCA-PDF/cca2002/v75-n2/CCA_75_2002_633_649_KLEIN.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610165115/http://jagor.srce.hr/ccacaa/CCA-PDF/cca2002/v75-n2/CCA_75_2002_633_649_KLEIN.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Záležák, Tomáš (18 October 2007); [http://ganymed.math.muni.cz/ks/uploads/File/kafe/cj/uloha2.1.5en.pdf \"Resistance of a regular tetrahedron\"] (PDF), retrieved 25 Jan 2011</ref>\n\nSince [[silicon]] is the most common [[semiconductor]] used in [[solid-state electronics]], and silicon has a [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] of four, the tetrahedral shape of the four chemical bonds in silicon is a strong influence on how [[crystal]]s of silicon form and what shapes they assume.\n\n===Games===\n[[Image:4-sided dice 250.jpg|100px|thumb|[[4-sided dice]]]]\nThe [[Royal Game of Ur]], dating from 2600 BC, was played with a set of tetrahedral dice.\n\nEspecially in [[roleplaying]], this solid is known as a [[4-sided die]], one of the more common [[polyhedral dice]], with the number rolled appearing around the bottom or on the top vertex.

It is therefore a second order Kleetope of the [[regular dodecahedron]]. In other words, by adding a shallow pentagonal pyramid to each face of a regular dodecahedron, we get a pentakis dodecahedron. By adding an even shallower triangular pyramid to each face of the pentakis dodecahedron, we get a small hexagonal hexecontahedron.\n\nThe 60 vertices of degree 3 correspond to the apex vertex of each triangular pyramid of the Kleetope, or to each face of the pentakis dodecahedron. The 20 vertices of degree 12 and 12 vertices of degree 10 correspond to the vertices of the pentakis dodecahedron, and also respectively to the 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons of the [[truncated icosahedron]], the dual solid to the pentakis dodecahedron.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Wenninger | first1=Magnus | author1-link=Magnus Wenninger | title=Dual Models | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-54325-5 |mr=730208 | year=1983}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{mathworld | urlname = SmallHexagonalHexecontahedron| title =Small hexagonal hexecontahedron}}\n[[Category:Dual uniform polyhedra]]\n\n{{polyhedron-stub}}"

      "text": "A '''regular polyhedron''' is a [[polyhedron]] whose [[symmetry group]] acts transitively on its [[Flag (geometry)|flag]]s. A regular polyhedron is highly symmetrical, being all of [[edge-transitive]], [[vertex-transitive]] and [[face-transitive]]. In classical contexts, many different equivalent definitions are used; a common one is that faces are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[regular polygons]] which are assembled in the same way around each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]].\n\nA regular polyhedron is identified by its [[Schläfli symbol]] of the form {''n'', ''m''}, where ''n'' is the number of sides of each face and ''m'' the number of faces meeting at each vertex. There are 5 finite convex regular polyhedra (the [[Platonic solid]]s), and four regular [[star polyhedra]] (the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]), making nine regular polyhedra in all. In addition, there are five regular compounds of the regular polyhedra.\n\n== The regular polyhedra ==\n\nThere are five [[Convex polygon|convex]] regular polyhedra, known as the '''[[Platonic solid]]s''', four regular [[star polyhedron|star polyhedra]], the '''[[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]''', and five regular compounds of regular polyhedra:\n\n=== Platonic solids ===\n{{Main|Platonic solid}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=640\n|- align=center\n|[[Image:Tetrahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:Hexahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:Octahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:Dodecahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:Icosahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|- align=center\n|[[Tetrahedron]] {3,&nbsp;3}||[[Cube]] {4,&nbsp;3}||[[Octahedron]] {3,&nbsp;4}||[[Dodecahedron]] {5,&nbsp;3}||[[Regular icosahedron|Icosahedron]] {3,&nbsp;5}\n|- align=center\n|[[Euler characteristic|''χ'']] = 2||''χ'' = 2||''χ'' = 2||''χ'' = 2||''χ'' = 2\n|}\n\n=== Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra ===\n\n{{Main|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=640\n|- align=center\n|[[Image:SmallStellatedDodecahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:GreatDodecahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:GreatStellatedDodecahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|[[Image:GreatIcosahedron.jpg|100px]] \t \n|- align=center\n|[[Small stellated dodecahedron]]<br>{5/2,&nbsp;5}\n||[[Great dodecahedron]]<br>{5,&nbsp;5/2}\n||[[Great stellated dodecahedron]]<br>{5/2,&nbsp;3}\n||[[Great icosahedron]]<br>{3,&nbsp;5/2}\n|- align=center\n|''χ'' = −6||''χ'' = −6||''χ'' = 2||''χ'' = 2\n|}\n\n=== Regular compounds ===\n{{Main|Polytope compound#Regular compounds}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=640\n|- align=center\n|[[Image:Compound of two tetrahedra.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:CompoundOfFiveTetrahedra.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Compound of ten tetrahedra.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Compound of five cubes.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Compound of five octahedra.png|100px]]\n|- align=center\n|[[Stellated octahedron|Two tetrahedra]]<br>2 {3,&nbsp;3}||[[Compound of five tetrahedra|Five tetrahedra]]<br>5 {3,&nbsp;3}||[[Compound of ten tetrahedra|Ten tetrahedra]]<br>10 {3,&nbsp;3}||[[Compound of five cubes|Five cubes]]<br>5 {4,&nbsp;3}||[[Compound of five octahedra|Five octahedra]]<br>5 {3,&nbsp;4}\n|- align=center\n|''χ'' = 4||''χ'' = 10|| || ||\n|}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n===Equivalent properties===\n\nThe property of having a similar arrangement of faces around each vertex can be replaced by any of the following equivalent conditions in the definition:\n\n*The vertices of the polyhedron all lie on a [[sphere]].\n*All the [[dihedral angle]]s of the polyhedron are equal\n*All the [[vertex figure]]s of the polyhedron are [[regular polygon]]s.\n*All the [[solid angle]]s of the polyhedron are congruent. (Cromwell, 1997)\n\n===Concentric spheres===\n\nA regular polyhedron has all of three related spheres (other polyhedra lack at least one kind) which share its centre:\n* An [[insphere]], tangent to all faces.\n* An intersphere or [[midsphere]], tangent to all edges.\n* A [[circumsphere]], tangent to all vertices.\n\n===Symmetry===\n\nThe regular polyhedra are the most [[symmetry|symmetrical]] of all the polyhedra. They lie in just three [[symmetry group]]s, which are named after the Platonic solids:\n*Tetrahedral\n*Octahedral (or cubic)\n*Icosahedral (or dodecahedral)\n\nAny shapes with icosahedral or octahedral symmetry will also contain tetrahedral symmetry.\n\n===Euler characteristic===\n\nThe five Platonic solids have an [[Euler characteristic]] of 2. This simply reflects that the surface is a topological 2-sphere, and so is also true, for example, of\nany polyhedron which is star-shaped with respect to some interior point.\n\n===Interior points===\n\nThe sum of the distances from any point in the interior of a regular polyhedron to the sides is independent of the location of the point (this is an extension of [[Viviani's theorem]].) However, the converse does not hold, not even for [[tetrahedra]].<ref>Chen, Zhibo, and Liang, Tian. \"The converse of Viviani's theorem\", ''[[The College Mathematics Journal]]'' 37(5), 2006, pp. 390–391.</ref>\n\n== Duality of the regular polyhedra ==\nIn a [[dual polyhedron|dual]] pair of polyhedra, the vertices of one polyhedron correspond to the faces of the other, and vice versa.\n\nThe regular polyhedra show this duality as follows:\n* The [[tetrahedron]] is self-dual, i.e. it pairs with itself.\n* The [[cube]] and [[octahedron]] are dual to each other.\n* The [[regular icosahedron|icosahedron]] and [[dodecahedron]] are dual to each other.\n* The [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great dodecahedron]] are dual to each other.\n* The [[great stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great icosahedron]] are dual to each other.\n\nThe Schläfli symbol of the dual is just the original written backwards, for example the dual of {5, 3} is {3, 5}.\n\n==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Polyhedron]] -->\n\n{{seealso|Regular polytope#History of discovery}}\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nStones carved in shapes resembling clusters of spheres or knobs have been found in [[Scotland]] and may be as much as 4,000 years old. Some of these stones show not only the symmetries of the five Platonic solids, but also some of the relations of duality amongst them (that is, that the centres of the faces of the cube gives the vertices of an octahedron). Examples of these stones are on display in the John Evans room of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]]. Why these objects were made, or how their creators gained the inspiration for them, is a mystery. There is doubt regarding the mathematical interpretation of these objects, as many have non-platonic forms, and perhaps only one has been found to be a true icosahedron, as opposed to a reinterpretation of the icosahedron dual, the dodecahedron.<ref>[http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-scottish-solids-hoax The Scottish Solids Hoax], </ref>  \n\nIt is also possible that the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] preceded the Greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery near [[Padua]] (in Northern [[Italy]]) in the late 19th century of a [[dodecahedron]] made of [[soapstone]], and dating back more than 2,500 years (Lindemann, 1987).\n\n=== Greeks ===\n\nThe earliest known ''written'' records of the regular convex solids originated from Classical Greece. When these solids were all discovered and by whom is not known, but [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (an [[Athens|Athenian]]) was the first to give a mathematical description of all five (Van der Waerden, 1954), (Euclid, book XIII). [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] (Coxeter, 1948, Section 1.9) credits [[Plato]] (400 BC) with having made models of them, and mentions that one of the earlier [[Pythagoreans]], [[Timaeus of Locri]], used all five in a correspondence between the polyhedra and the nature of the universe as it was then perceived – this correspondence is recorded in Plato's dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']]. Euclid's reference to Plato led to their common description as the ''Platonic solids''.\n\nOne might characterise the Greek definition as follows:\n*A regular polygon is a ([[Convex polygon|convex]]) planar figure with all edges equal and all corners equal.\n*A regular polyhedron is a solid (convex) figure with all faces being congruent regular polygons, the same number arranged all alike around each vertex.\n\nThis definition rules out, for example, the [[square pyramid]] (since although all the faces are regular, the square base is not congruent to the triangular sides), or the shape formed by joining two tetrahedra together (since although all faces of that [[triangular bipyramid]] would be equilateral triangles, that is, congruent and regular, some vertices have 3 triangles and others have 4).\n\nThis concept of a regular polyhedron would remain unchallenged for almost 2000 years.\n\n=== Regular star polyhedra ===\n\nRegular star polygons such as the [[pentagram]] (star pentagon) were also known to the ancient Greeks – the [[pentagram]] was used by the [[Pythagoreans]] as their secret sign, but they did not use them to construct polyhedra. It was not until the early 17th century that [[Johannes Kepler]] realised that pentagrams could be used as the faces of regular [[star polyhedron|star polyhedra]]. Some of these star polyhedra may have been discovered by others before Kepler's time, but Kepler was the first to recognise that they could be considered \"regular\" if one removed the restriction that regular polyhedra be convex. Two hundred years later [[Louis Poinsot]] also allowed star [[vertex figure]]s (circuits around each corner), enabling him to discover two new regular star polyhedra along with rediscovering Kepler's. These four are the only regular star polyhedra, and have come to be known as the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]. It was not until the mid-19th century, several decades after Poinsot published, that Cayley gave them their modern English names: (Kepler's) [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great stellated dodecahedron]], and (Poinsot's) [[great icosahedron]] and [[great dodecahedron]].\n\nThe Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra may be constructed from the Platonic solids by a process called [[stellation]]. The reciprocal process to stellation is called [[facetting]] (or faceting). Every stellation of one polyhedron is [[Dual polyhedron|dual]], or reciprocal, to some facetting of the dual polyhedron. The regular star polyhedra can also be obtained by facetting the Platonic solids. This was first done by Bertrand around the same time that Cayley named them.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century there were therefore nine regular polyhedra – five convex and four star.\n\n== Regular polyhedra in nature ==\n\nEach of the Platonic solids occurs naturally in one form or another. \n\nThe tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron all occur as [[crystal]]s. These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals (Smith, 1982, p212), of which there are 48. Neither the [[regular icosahedron]] nor the [[regular dodecahedron]] are amongst them, but crystals can have the shape of a [[pyritohedron]], which is visually almost indistinguishable from a regular dodecahedron. Truly icosahedral crystals may be formed by [[quasicrystal|quasicrystalline materials]] which are very rare in nature but can be produced in a laboratory..\n\nA more recent discovery is of a series of new types of [[carbon]] molecule, known as the [[fullerene]]s (see Curl, 1991). Although C<sub>60</sub>, the most easily produced fullerene, looks more or less spherical, some of the larger varieties (such as C<sub>240</sub>, C<sub>480</sub> and C<sub>960</sub>) are hypothesised to take on the form of slightly rounded icosahedra, a few nanometres across.\n\n[[File:Circogoniaicosahedra ekw.jpg|left|frame|Circogonia icosahedra, a species of [[Radiolaria]].]]\n\nPolyhedra appear in biology as well. In the early 20th century, [[Ernst Haeckel]] described a number of species of [[Radiolaria]], some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra (Haeckel, 1904). Examples include ''Circoporus octahedrus'', ''Circogonia icosahedra'', ''Lithocubus geometricus'' and ''Circorrhegma dodecahedra''; the shapes of these creatures are indicated by their names. The outer protein shells of many [[virus]]es form regular polyhedra. For example, [[HIV]] is enclosed in a regular icosahedron.\n\nIn ancient times the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] believed that there was a harmony between the regular polyhedra and the orbits of the [[planet]]s. In the 17th century, [[Johannes Kepler]] studied data on planetary motion compiled by [[Tycho Brahe]] and for a decade tried to establish the Pythagorean ideal by finding a match between the sizes of the polyhedra and the sizes of the planets' orbits. His search failed in its original objective, but out of this research came Kepler's discoveries of the Kepler solids as regular polytopes, the realisation that the orbits of planets are not circles, and [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|the laws of planetary motion]] for which he is now famous. In Kepler's time only five planets (excluding the earth) were known, nicely matching the number of Platonic solids. Kepler's work, and the discovery since that time of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], have invalidated the Pythagorean idea.\n\nAround the same time as the Pythagoreans, Plato described a theory of matter in which the five elements (earth, air, fire, water and spirit) each comprised tiny copies of one of the five regular solids. Matter was built up from a mixture of these polyhedra, with each substance having different proportions in the mix. Two thousand years later [[Dalton's atomic theory]] would show this idea to be along the right lines, though not related directly to the regular solids.\n\n== Further generalisations ==\nThe 20th century saw a succession of generalisations of the idea of a regular polyhedron, leading to several new classes.\n\n=== Regular skew apeirohedra ===\n\n{{Main|Regular skew apeirohedron}}\n\nIn the first decades, Coxeter and Petrie allowed \"saddle\" vertices with alternating ridges and valleys, enabling them to construct three infinite folded surfaces which they called [[regular skew polyhedron|regular skew polyhedra]].<ref>[[Coxeter]], ''The Beauty of Geometry: Twelve Essays'', Dover Publications, 1999, {{isbn|0-486-40919-8}} (Chapter 5: Regular Skew Polyhedra in three and four dimensions and their topological analogues, Proceedings of the London Mathematics Society, Ser. 2, Vol 43, 1937.)</ref> Coxeter offered a modified [[Schläfli symbol]] {l,m|n} for these figures, with {l,m} implying the [[vertex figure]], with ''m'' regular ''l''-gons around a vertex. The ''n'' defines ''n''-gonal ''holes''. Their vertex figures are [[regular skew polygon]]s, vertices zig-zagging between two planes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=3| Infinite regular skew polyhedra in 3-space (partially drawn)\n|- align=center\n||[[Image:mucube.png|150px]]<br>{4,6|4}\n|[[Image:muoctahedron.png|150px]]<br>{6,4|4}\n|[[Image:mutetrahedron.png|150px]]<br>{6,6|3}\n|}\n\n=== Regular skew polyhedra ===\n{{Main|Regular skew polyhedron}}\n\nFinite regular skew polyhedra exist in 4-space. These finite regular skew polyhedra in 4-space can be seen as a subset of the faces of [[uniform 4-polytope]]s. They have planar [[regular polygon]] faces, but [[regular skew polygon]] [[vertex figure]]s.\n\nTwo dual solutions are related to the [[5-cell]], two dual solutions are related to the [[24-cell]], and an infinite set of self-dual [[duoprism]]s generate regular skew polyhedra as {4, 4 &#124; n}.

One such facet is shown in as seen in this [[Poincaré disk model]].]]\nIn H<sup>3</sup> [[hyperbolic space]], [[paracompact regular honeycomb]]s have Euclidean tiling [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] and [[vertex figure]]s that act like finite polyhedra. Such tilings have an [[angle defect]] that can be closed by bending one way or the other. If the tiling is properly scaled, it will ''close'' as an [[Asymptote|asymptopic limit]] at a single [[ideal point]]. These Euclidean tilings are inscribed in a [[horosphere]] just as polyhedra are inscribed in a sphere (which contains zero ideal points). The sequence extends when hyperbolic tilings are themselves used as facets of noncompact hyperbolic tessellations, as in the [[heptagonal tiling honeycomb]] {7,3,3}; they are inscribed in an equidistant surface (a 2-[[hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)|hypercycle]]), which has two ideal points.\n\n==== Regular tilings of the real projective plane ====\nAnother group of regular polyhedra comprise tilings of the [[real projective plane]]. These include the [[Hemi-cube (geometry)|hemi-cube]], [[hemi-octahedron]], [[hemi-dodecahedron]], and [[hemi-icosahedron]]. They are (globally) [[projective polyhedra]], and are the projective counterparts of the [[Platonic solid]]s. The tetrahedron does not have a projective counterpart as it does not have pairs of parallel faces which can be identified, as the other four Platonic solids do.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Hemicube.svg|150px]]<br>[[Hemicube (geometry)|Hemi-cube]]<br>{4,3}\n|[[File:Hemioctahedron.png|150px]]<br>[[Hemi-octahedron]]<br>{3,4}\n|[[File:Hemi-Dodecahedron2.PNG|150px]]<br>[[Hemi-dodecahedron]]<br>{3,5}\n|[[File:Hemi-icosahedron.png|150px]]<br>[[Hemi-icosahedron]]<br>{5,3}\n|}\n\nThese occur as dual pairs in the same way as the original Platonic solids do. Their Euler characteristics are all 1.\n\n=== Abstract regular polyhedra ===\n{{See|Abstract regular polytope}}\n\nBy now, polyhedra were firmly understood as three-dimensional examples of more general ''[[polytope]]s'' in any number of dimensions. The second half of the century saw the development of abstract algebraic ideas such as [[Polyhedral combinatorics]], culminating in the idea of an [[abstract polytope]] as a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) of elements. The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the ''null polytope'' or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or ''realised'' as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or ''faithful'' realisations, others do not. A ''flag'' is a connected set of elements of each dimension – for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be ''regular'' if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags – that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.\n\nFive such regular abstract polyhedra, which can not be realised faithfully, were identified by [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] in his book ''[[Regular Polytopes]]'' (1977) and again by [[J. M. Wills]] in his paper \"The combinatorially regular polyhedra of index 2\" (1987). All five have C<sub>2</sub>×S<sub>5</sub> symmetry but can only be realised with half the symmetry, that is C<sub>2</sub>×A<sub>5</sub> or icosahedral symmetry.<ref>[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/regularpolyhedra.htm The Regular Polyhedra (of index two)], David A.

It is one of four [[nonconvex]] [[List of regular polytopes#Non-convex 2|regular polyhedra]].

It also shares its edges with the [[great icosahedron]]; the compound with both is the [[great complex icosidodecahedron]].\n\nThere are four related uniform polyhedra, constructed as degrees of truncation. The dual is a [[great dodecahedron]]. The [[dodecadodecahedron]] is a rectification, where edges are truncated down to points.\n\nThe ''[[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] small stellated dodecahedron'' can be considered a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate uniform polyhedron]] since edges and vertices coincide, but it is included for completeness. Visually, it looks like a [[dodecahedron|regular dodecahedron]] on the surface, but it has 24 faces in overlapping pairs. The spikes are truncated until they reach the plane of the pentagram beneath them. The 24 faces are 12 [[pentagons]] from the truncated vertices and 12 decagons taking the form of doubly-wound pentagons overlapping the first 12 pentagons.  The latter faces are formed by truncating the original pentagrams.  When an {n/d}-gon is truncated, it becomes a {2n/d}-gon.  For example, a truncated pentagon {5/1} becomes a decagon {10/1}, so truncating a pentagram {5/2} becomes a doubly-wound pentagon {10/2} (the common factor between 10 and 2 mean we visit each vertex twice to complete the polygon).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=500\n!Name\n!Small stellated dodecahedron\n!Truncated small stellated dodecahedron\n![[Dodecadodecahedron]]\n![[Truncated great dodecahedron|Truncated<BR>great<BR>dodecahedron]]\n![[Great dodecahedron|Great<BR>dodecahedron]]\n|- align=center\n![[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram|Coxeter-Dynkin<BR>diagram]]\n|{{CDD|node|5|node|5|rat|d2|node_1}}\n|{{CDD|node|5|node_1|5|rat|d2|node_1}}\n|{{CDD|node|5|node_1|5|rat|d2|node}}\n|{{CDD|node_1|5|node_1|5|rat|d2|node}}\n|{{CDD|node_1|5|node|5|rat|d2|node}}\n|- align=center\n!Picture\n|[[Image:Small stellated dodecahedron.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Dodecahedron.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Dodecadodecahedron.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Great truncated dodecahedron.png|100px]]\n|[[Image:Great dodecahedron.png|100px]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Compound of small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Magnus | last=Wenninger | authorlink=Magnus Wenninger  | title=Polyhedron Models | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1974 | isbn=0-521-09859-9 }}\n* {{citation | first=Matthias | last=Weber | title= Kepler's small stellated dodecahedron as a Riemann surface| journal = Pacific J.

It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a [[zonohedron]] (every face has point symmetry).\n\nThe cube can be cut into six identical [[square pyramid]]s. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces).\n\n==Other dimensions==\nThe analogue of a cube in four-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] has a special name—a [[tesseract]] or [[hypercube]]. More properly, a hypercube (or ''n''-dimensional cube or simply ''n''-cube) is the analogue of the cube in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a ''measure polytope''.\n\nThere are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in dimension 0, a [[line segment]] in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.\n\n==Related polyhedra==\n[[Image:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|200px|right|The dual of a cube is an [[octahedron]], seen here with vertices at the center of the cube's square faces.]]\n[[File:Hemicube.svg|200px|thumb|The [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]] is the 2-to-1 quotient of the cube.]]\nThe quotient of the cube by the [[Antipodal point|antipodal]] map yields a [[projective polyhedron]], the [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]].\n\nIf the original cube has edge length 1, its [[dual polyhedron]] (an [[octahedron]]) has edge length <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2}/2</math>.\n\nThe cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:\n{|class=wikitable\n!Name!!Equal edge-lengths?!!Equal angles?!!Right angles?\n|-\n|'''Cube'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''\n|-\n|[[Rhombohedron]]||Yes||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]||No||Yes||Yes\n|-\n|[[Parallelepiped]]||No||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[quadrilateral]]ly faced hexahedron||No||No||No\n|}\n\nThe vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular [[tetrahedron]]; more generally this is referred to as a [[demicube]]. These two together form a regular [[polyhedral compound|compound]], the [[stella octangula]]. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.\n\nOne such regular tetrahedron has a volume of {{sfrac|1|3}} of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of {{sfrac|1|6}} of that of the cube, each.\n\nThe [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] cube is the [[cuboctahedron]]. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six [[octagon]]al faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons ([[truncated cube]]). The [[rhombicuboctahedron]] is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount.\n\nA cube can be inscribed in a [[dodecahedron]] so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes.\n\nIf two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained. Eight of these irregular octahedra can be attached to the triangular faces of a regular octahedron to obtain the cuboctahedron.\n\nThe cube is topologically related to a series of spherical polyhedra and tilings with order-3 [[vertex figure]]s.\n{{Order-3 tiling table}}\n\nThe cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.\n{{Octahedral truncations}}\n\nThe cube is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular tilings, extending into the [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Hyperbolic_tilings|hyperbolic plane]]: {4,p}, p=3,4,5...\n{{Regular square tiling table}}\n\nWith [[dihedral symmetry]], Dih<sub>4</sub>, the cube is topologically related in a series of uniform polyhedra and tilings 4.2n.2n, extending into the hyperbolic plane:\n{{Truncated figure3 table}}\n\nAll these figures have [[octahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe cube is a part of a sequence of rhombic polyhedra and tilings with [''n'',3] [[Coxeter group]] symmetry.

This is one of the most common and simplest shapes found in [[crystal]]s and [[mineral]]s.\n\nThere are three main varieties of these crystals:\n*Primitive cubic (abbreviated ''cP''<ref name=IUCnames>{{cite journal|title=Nomenclature for crystal families, Bravais-lattice types and arithmetic classes.

Note that although the ''unit cell'' in these crystals is conventionally taken to be a cube, the [[primitive_cell|primitive unit cell]] often is not.\n\n==Bravais lattices==\nThe three [[Bravais lattice]]s in the cubic crystal system are:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! Bravais lattice\n! Primitive<br/>cubic\n! Body-centered<br/>cubic\n! Face-centered<br/>cubic\n|- align=center\n! [[Pearson symbol]]\n| cP\n| cI\n| cF\n|-\n!

Each atom at a lattice point is then shared equally between eight adjacent cubes, and the unit cell therefore contains in total one atom ({{frac|8}}&nbsp;×&nbsp;8).<br />The '''body-centered cubic''' system (cI) has one lattice point in the center of the unit cell in addition to the eight corner points. It has a net total of 2 lattice points per unit cell ({{frac|8}}&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 +&nbsp;1).<br />The '''face-centered cubic''' system (cF) has lattice points on the faces of the cube, that each gives exactly one half contribution, in addition to the corner lattice points, giving a total of 4 lattice points per unit cell ({{frac|8}}&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 from the corners plus {{frac|2}}&nbsp;×&nbsp;6 from the faces). Each sphere in a cF lattice has [[coordination number]] 12. Coordination number is the number of nearest neighbours of a central atom in the structure.\n\nThe face-centered cubic system is closely related to the [[Hexagonal_crystal_system|hexagonal close packed]] (hcp) system, where two systems differ only in the relative placements of their hexagonal layers. The [[Miller_index|[111]]] plane of a face-centered cubic system is a hexagonal grid.\n\nAttempting to create a C-centered cubic crystal system (i.e., putting an extra lattice point in the center of each horizontal face) would result in a simple [[Tetragonal_crystal_system|tetragonal]] [[Bravais lattice]].\n\n==Crystal classes==\nThe ''isometric crystal system'' class names, [[crystallographic_point_group|point groups]] (in [[Schoenflies_notation|Schönflies notation]], [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], [[orbifold]], and [[Coxeter notation]]), type, examples, International Tables for Crystallography space group number,<ref name=\"ITC\">{{cite book |title=International Tables for Crystallography |doi=10.1107/97809553602060000001 |isbn=978-1-4020-4969-9 |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Prince |year=2006 |publisher= International Union of Crystallography}}</ref> and [[space group]]s are listed in the table below.

Components of a unit cell, 2. One unit cell, 3. A lattice of 3 x 3 x 3 unit cells]]\nA simple cubic unit cell has a single cubic void in the center.\n\nA body-centered [[cube|cubic]] unit cell has six [[octahedron|octahedral]] voids located at the center of each face of the unit cell, and twelve further ones located at the midpoint of each edge of the same cell, for a total of six net octahedral voids. Additionally, there are 24 [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] voids located in a square spacing around each octahedral void, for a total of twelve net tetrahedral voids. These tetrahedral voids are not local maxima and are not technically voids, but they do occasionally appear in multi-atom unit cells.\n\nA face-centered cubic unit cell has eight tetrahedral voids located midway between each corner and the center of the unit cell, for a total of eight net tetrahedral voids. Additionally, there are twelve octahedral voids located at the midpoints of the edges of the unit cell as well as one octahedral hole in the very center of the cell, for a total of four net octahedral voids.\n\nOne important characteristic of a crystalline structure is its [[atomic packing factor]]. This is calculated by assuming that all the atoms are identical spheres, with a radius large enough that each sphere abuts on the next. The atomic packing factor is the proportion of space filled by these spheres.\n\nAssuming one atom per lattice point, in a primitive cubic lattice with cube side length ''a'', the sphere radius would be {{frac|''a''|2}} and the atomic packing factor turns out to be about 0.524 (which is quite low). Similarly, in a ''bcc'' lattice, the atomic packing factor is 0.680, and in ''fcc'' it is 0.740<!-- pi/sqrt(18) -->. The ''fcc'' value is the [[Close-packing_of_equal_spheres|highest theoretically possible value]] for any lattice, although there are other lattices which also achieve the same value, such as hexagonal close packed (''hcp'') and one version of tetrahedral ''bcc''.\n\nAs a rule, since atoms in a solid attract each other, the more tightly packed arrangements of atoms tend to be more common. (Loosely packed arrangements do occur, though, for example if the [[Orbital_hybridisation|orbital hybridization]] demands certain [[Molecular_geometry|bond angles]].) Accordingly, the primitive cubic structure, with especially low atomic packing factor, is rare in nature, but is found in [[polonium]].<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref><ref>The original discovery was in J. Chem. Phys. '''14''', 569 (1946).</ref> The ''bcc'' and ''fcc'', with their higher densities, are both quite common in nature. Examples of ''bcc'' include [[iron]], [[chromium]], [[tungsten]], and [[niobium]]. Examples of ''fcc'' include [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[gold]] and [[silver]].\n\n==Multi-element compounds==\nCompounds that consist of more than one element (e.g. [[binary compound]]s) often have crystal structures based on a cubic crystal system. Some of the more common ones are listed here.\n\n===Caesium chloride structure===\n[[File:CsCl_crystal.png|125px|thumb|right|A [[caesium chloride]] unit cell.

Altogether, the arrangement of atoms is the same as body-centered cubic, but with alternating types of atoms at the different lattice sites (see picture [http://www.ilpi.com/inorganic/structures/cscl/index.html here]). Alternately, one could view this lattice as a simple cubic structure with a secondary atom in its cubic void.\n\nIn addition to caesium chloride itself, the structure also appears in certain other [[Alkali_metal_halide|alkali halides]] when prepared at low temperatures or high pressures.<ref name=Seitz>Seitz, ''Modern Theory of Solids'' (1940), p.49</ref> Generally, this structure is more likely to be formed from two elements whose ions are of roughly the same size (for example, ionic radius of Cs<sup>+</sup> = 167 pm, and Cl<sup>−</sup> = 181 pm).\n\nThe [[coordination number]] of each atom in the structure is 8: the central cation is coordinated to 8 anions on the corners of a cube as shown, and similarly, the central anion is coordinated to 8 cations on the corners of a cube.\n\nOther compounds showing caesium chloride like structure are CsBr, CsI, high-temp RbCl, AlCo, AgZn, BeCu, MgCe, RuAl and SrTl.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Rock-salt structure===<!-- some wikilinks to section, like a fluorine -->\n\n[[File:NaCl_polyhedra.png|200px|thumb|left|The rock-salt crystal structure.

In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as ''Analytic Cubism'', a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori,<ref name=HF>[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J.

London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 784. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}</ref> was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, ''Synthetic Cubism'', remained vital until around 1919, when the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement gained popularity. English [[art historian]] [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, ''The Cubist Epoch''. According to Cooper there was \"Early Cubism\", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called \"High Cubism\", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to \"Late Cubism\" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.<ref name=\"The Cubist Epoch\">Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up \"The Cubist Epoch\"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}</ref> Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', 1907, considered to be a major step towards the founding of the Cubist movement<ref name=\"Cooper, 24\">Cooper, 24</ref>]]\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1909-10, ''Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise)'', oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, [[Tate Modern]], London]]\n\n===Proto-Cubism: 1907–08===\n{{main|Proto-Cubism}}\nCubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911.

The motif of the viaduct at l'Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective.<ref>''Futurism in Paris - The Avant-garde Explosion'', Centre Pompidou, Paris 2008</ref>\n\nGeorges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted Vauxcelles, in ''Gil Blas'', 25 March 1909, to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities).<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)</ref> [[Gertrude Stein]] referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'', as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] in [[Paris]] during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\nBy 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque's importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L’Estaque landscapes. But \"this view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists,\" wrote the art historian Christopher Green: \"Marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1911 [...]\"<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\nThe assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] as early as 1920,<ref>D.-H. Kahnweiler. Der Weg zum Kubismus (Munich, 1920; Eng. trans., New York, 1949)</ref> but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by [[Clement Greenberg]].<ref>C. Greenberg. ‘The Pasted-paper Revolution’, ARTnews, 57 (1958), pp. 46–9, 60–61; repr. as ‘Collage’ in Art and Culture (Boston, 1961), pp. 70–83</ref>\n\nContemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the \"Salle 41\" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the \"Salle 41\" artists, e.g., [[Francis Picabia]]; the brothers [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the [[Section d'Or]] (or the [[Puteaux Group]]); the sculptors [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] as well as [[Jacques Lipchitz]] and [[Henri Laurens]]; and painters such as [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[František Kupka]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Léopold Survage]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[André Lhote]], [[Gino Severini]] (after 1916), [[María Blanchard]] (after 1916) and [[Georges Valmier]] (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were \"later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\n[[John Berger]] identifies the essence of Cubism with the mechanical diagram. \"The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: The diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Moment of Cubism|year=1969|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780297177098}}</ref>\n\n===Early Cubism: 1909–1914===\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, l'Homme au Balcon, 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Albert Gleizes]], ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\nIn contrast, the Salon Cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants, both major non-academic Salons in Paris. They were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" /> Already in 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Salmon]]. Together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color.<ref name=\"Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie\">[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=November 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nLouis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier as \"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\"<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]</ref><ref name=\"Daniel Robbins 1985\">Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

Other Cubists, by contrast, especially [[František Kupka]], and those considered [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]] by [[Apollinaire]] (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka's two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, ''Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs'' and ''Amorpha chromatique chaude'', were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'', followed by a series entitled ''Formes Circulaires'', in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled ''Contrasts of Forms'', giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in ''Les Peintres cubistes'' (1913),<ref name=\"Apollinaire\" /> writing of a new \"pure\" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\nAlso labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\n====Section d'Or====\n{{main|Section d'Or}}\n[[File:Salon d'Automne 1912, Paris, works exhibited by Kupka, Modigliani, Csaky, Picabia, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November.

The ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' at the ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912, was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition; exposing Cubism to a wide audience. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective.<ref name=\"The History and Chronology of Cubism\">[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314010756/http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm |date=2013-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe group seems to have adopted the name Section d'Or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of Cubism developed in parallel by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] in the [[Montmartre]] quarter of Paris, and to show that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the [[golden ratio]] had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).<ref>[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or, Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403151309/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+num%C3%A9ro+sp%C3%A9cial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg |date=2017-04-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe idea of the Section d'Or originated in the course of conversations between Metzinger, Gleizes and Jacques Villon. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Codex Urbinas|Trattato della Pittura]]'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]].\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering [[African culture|African]], Polynesian, [[Micronesia]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[primitivism]], [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture, [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[Proto-Cubism|Protocubism]], as notably seen in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.<ref name=\"Cooper, 24\" />\n\n[[File:La Carrière de Bibémus, par Paul Cézanne, Yorck.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Quarry Bibémus'', 1898-1900, [[Museum Folkwang]], [[Essen]], [[Germany]]]]\nThe art historian Douglas Cooper states that [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] \"were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907\".<ref>Cooper, 20-27</ref> Cooper goes on to say: \"The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, [[expressionist]] element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.\"<ref name=\"Cooper, 24\"/>\n\nThe most serious objection to regarding the ''Demoiselles'' as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that \"such deductions are unhistorical\", wrote the art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]]. This familiar explanation \"fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed.\"<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\">[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]</ref> Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both [[Les Nabis]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat]] (e.g., ''Parade de Cirque'', ''[[Le Chahut]]'' and ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Le Cirque]]''), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" />\n\nIn addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by [[binocular vision]], and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.\n\n[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1911-12, La Femme au Cheval - The Rider.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Jean Metzinger]], ''[[La Femme au Cheval]], Woman with a horse'', 1911-1912, Statens Museum for Kunst, National Gallery of Denmark. Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, and published in Apollinaire's 1913 ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]''. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, [[Niels Bohr]]]]\nThe historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris. The terms \"analytical\" and \"synthetic\" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. \"If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque,\" wrote Daniel Robbins, \"our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition.\"<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" />\n\nThe traditional interpretation of \"Cubism\", formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. It is difficult to apply to painters such as [[Jean Metzinger]], Albert Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], whose fundamental differences from traditional Cubism compelled Kahnweiler to question whether to call them Cubists at all. According to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], \"To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake.\"<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" />\n\nThe history of the term \"Cubism\" usually stresses the fact that Matisse referred to \"cubes\" in connection with a painting by Braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in a similar context. However, the word \"cube\" was used in 1906 by another critic, Louis Chassevent, with reference not to Picasso or Braque but rather to Metzinger and Delaunay:\n\n::\"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. [[Paul Signac|Signac]] but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]\".<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" /><ref>Louis Chassevent, ''Les Artistes Indépendants, 1906'', Quelques Petits Salons.

Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968</ref>\n\nThe critical use of the word \"cube\" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing the work of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'', commented that he \"uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments.\" (Robert Herbert, 1968, p.&nbsp;221)<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nThe term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger.<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" /> In 1911, the poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants.

This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&redir_esc=y Christopher Green, ''Cubism and Its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&redir_esc=y |date=2016-01-01 }}'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, {{ISBN|0300034687}}</ref>\n\nCrystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict.

After World War I, with the support given by the dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]], Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of [[geometric abstraction]] and [[Surrealism]] in [[Paris]]. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and the Englishman [[Ben Nicholson]]. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler's exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\nThe reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called [[Neoclassicism]]) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards [[conservatism]] in both [[French culture|French]] society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] or [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealizing|Naturalism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and abstraction could be compared.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\n==== Influence in Asia ====\nJapan and China were among the first countries in Asia to be influenced by Cubism. Contact first occurred via European texts translated and published in Japanese art journals in the 1910s. In the 1920s, Japanese and Chinese artists who studied in Paris, for example those enrolled at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], brought back with them both an understanding of modern art movements, including Cubism. Notable works exhibiting Cubist qualities were [[Tetsugorō Yorozu]]'s ''Self Portrait with Red Eyes'' (1912) and [[Fang Ganmin]]'s ''Melody in Autumn'' (1934).<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Kolokytha, Chara |author2=Hammond, J.M. |author3=Vlčková, Lucie |first=|date=|title=Cubism|url=https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/cubism|journal=Routledge Encyclopaedia of Modernism|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aaa.org.hk/en/collection/search/library/cubism-in-asia-unbounded-dialogues-report|title=Cubism in Asia: Unbounded Dialogues -- Report|last=Archive|first=Asia Art|website=aaa.org.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretation==\n===Intentions and criticism===\n[[File:Juan Gris - Portrait of Pablo Picasso - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Juan Gris]], ''Portrait of Picasso'', 1912, oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\nThe Cubism of Picasso and Braque had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the Salon Cubists produced different kinds of Cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. \"It is by no means clear, in any case,\" wrote Christopher Green, \"to what extent these other Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, 'passage' and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of 'true' Cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of Cézanne.\" The works exhibited by these Cubists at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. Aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" />\n\nIn ''Du \"Cubisme\"'' Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of ''simultaneity'',<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" /> drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]], [[Maurice Princet]], and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. [[Perspective (graphical)|Linear perspective]] developed during [[the Renaissance]] was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.<ref name=\"David Cottington\" />\n\nThis technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or [[relative motion]]) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'', exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'' shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's ''City of Paris'', shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger's ''The Wedding'', also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], Gino Severini and [[Carlo Carrà]]; themselves made in response to early Cubism.<ref name=\"MoMA, Meanings and interpretations\" />\n\nCubism and [[modern art|modern European art]] was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]], which then traveled to [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]]. In the Armory show [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited ''La Femme au pot de moutarde'' (1910), the sculpture ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' (1909–10), ''Les Arbres'' (1907) amongst other cubist works. [[Jacques Villon]] exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother [[Marcel Duchamp]] shocked the American public with his painting ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). [[Francis Picabia]] exhibited his abstractions ''La Danse à la source'' and ''La Procession, Seville'' (both of 1912). [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibited ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux phlox]]'' (1910) and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au balcon]]'' (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. [[Georges Braque]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and [[Alexander Archipenko]] also contributed examples of their cubist works.\n\n==Cubist sculpture==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     =\n | image1    = Pablo Picasso, 1909–10, Head of a Woman (Fernande), modeled on Fernande Olivier (right side).jpg\n | width1    = 160\n | caption1  = Side view, bronze sculpture modeled on [[Fernande Olivier]]\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Pablo Picasso, 1909–10, Head of a Woman (Fernande), modeled on Fernande Olivier.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | caption2  = Frontal view of the same bronze cast, 40.5 x 23 x 26 cm\n | alt2      =\n\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header            = Pablo Picasso, 1909–10, ''Head of a Woman''\n| header_align      = center\n| header_background = \n| footer            = These photos were published in ''Umělecký Mĕsíčník'', 1913<ref>[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&d=bmtnabk1913-04.2.3&srpos=19&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-picasso----# Pablo Picasso, 1909–10, ''Head of a Woman'', bronze, published in ''Umělecký Mĕsíčník'', 1913] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303215312/http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&d=bmtnabk1913-04.2.3&srpos=19&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-picasso---- |date=2014-03-03 }}, Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University</ref>\n| footer_align      = center\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\n\n{{main|Cubist sculpture}}\n\nJust as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). And just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Futurism]].\n\nCubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting. During the autumn of 1909 Picasso sculpted ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. According to Douglas Cooper: \"The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time.\"<ref name=\"The Cubist Epoch\" /> These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by [[Alexander Archipenko]] in 1912–13, for example in ''Woman Walking''.<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" /> [[Joseph Csaky]], after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards.

Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (''La Maison Cubiste'', by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]]) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as [[Peter Behrens]] and [[Walter Gropius]], with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.<ref name=\"Christopher Green, Architecture\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&section_id=T020551#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, II.

De Stijl was also linked by [[Gino Severini]] to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as [[Le Corbusier]],) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published ''Après le cubisme'' in 1918.<ref name=\"Christopher Green, Architecture\" /> Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture.

After the war, the architectural style called ''Rondo-Cubism'' was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.<ref name=czkubista>{{cite web|title=Czech Cubism|url=http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html#|website=www.kubista.cz|publisher=Kubista|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008123014/http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html|archivedate=8 October 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:104 Vil·la Kovařovic (casa cubista), façana de Rašínovo Nábřeží.jpg|thumb|Villa Kovařovic in Prague by [[Josef Chochol]]]]\nIn their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called [[diamond cut]], or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late [[Gothic architecture]]. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. [[hexagonal window]]s.<ref name=czkubista/> Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.\n\nThe leading Cubist architects were [[Pavel Janák]], [[Josef Gočár]], [[Vlastislav Hofman]], [[Emil Králíček]] and [[Josef Chochol]].<ref name=czkubista/> They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns. The best-known Cubist building is the [[House of the Black Madonna]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]] built in 1912 by Josef Gočár with the only Cubist café in the world, Grand Café Orient.<ref name=bonek/> Vlastislav Hofman built the entrance pavilions of [[Ďáblice cemetery|Ďáblice Cemetery]] in 1912–1914, Josef Chochol designed several residential houses under [[Vyšehrad]]. A Cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the [[Wenceslas Square]], designed by Emil Králíček in 1912, who also built the Diamond House in the [[New Town of Prague]] around 1913.\n\n==Cubism in other fields==\nThe influence of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of [[Gertrude Stein]] employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.\n\nIn the field of American fiction, [[William Faulkner]]'s 1930 novel ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.\n\nThe poets generally associated with Cubism are [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]]. As American poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]] explains, Cubism in poetry \"is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Kenneth Rexroth |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |title=The Cubist Poetry of Pierre Reverdy (Rexroth) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519035242/http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}</ref> Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] was profound; [[Louis Aragon]], founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was \"our immediate elder, the exemplary poet.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |title=Title Page > Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200900/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}</ref> Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets [[John Ashbery]] and [[Ron Padgett]] have recently produced new translations of [[Pierre Reverdy|Reverdy's]] work. [[Wallace Stevens]]' \"[[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]]\" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070813070622/http://titan.iwu.edu/~wchapman/americanpoetryweb/stevthir.html Illinois Wesleyan University - The American Poetry Web]</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n{{quote| It is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of Cubism.

With these coordinates, the points of the structure have coordinates (''x'',&nbsp;''y'',&nbsp;''z'') satisfying the equations\n:''x'' = ''y'' = ''z'' (mod 2), and\n:''x'' + ''y'' + ''z'' = 0 or 1 (mod 4).<ref name=\"ny09\">{{citation|contribution=Neighborhood sequences in the diamond grid – algorithms with four neighbors|first1=Benedek|last1=Nagy|first2=Robin|last2=Strand|title=Combinatorial Image Analysis: 13th International Workshop, IWCIA 2009, Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, November 24–27, 2009, Proceedings|series=[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]]|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2009|volume=5852|pages=109–121|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10210-3_9|bibcode = 2009LNCS.5852..109N }}.</ref>\nThere are eight points (modulo 4) that satisfy these conditions:\n:(0,0,0), (0,2,2), (2,0,2), (2,2,0),\n:(3,3,3), (3,1,1), (1,3,1), (1,1,3)\nAll of the other points in the structure may be obtained by adding multiples of four to the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' coordinates of these eight points. Adjacent points in this structure are at distance {{sqrt|3}} apart in the integer lattice; the edges of the diamond structure lie along the body diagonals of the integer grid cubes. This structure may be scaled to a cubical unit cell that is some number ''a'' of units across by multiplying all coordinates by&nbsp;{{sfrac|''a''|4}}.\n\nAlternatively, each point of the diamond cubic structure may be given by four-dimensional integer coordinates whose sum is either zero or one. Two points are adjacent in the diamond structure if and only if their four-dimensional coordinates differ by one in  a single coordinate. The total difference in coordinate values between any two points (their four-dimensional [[Manhattan distance]]) gives the number of edges in the [[shortest path]] between them in the diamond structure. The four nearest neighbors of each point may be obtained, in this coordinate system, by adding one to each of the four coordinates, or by subtracting one from each of the four coordinates, accordingly as the coordinate sum is zero or one. These four-dimensional coordinates may be transformed into three-dimensional coordinates by the formula\n:(''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') → (''a'' + ''b'' − ''c'' − ''d'', ''a'' − ''b'' + ''c'' − ''d'', −''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' − ''d'').<ref name=\"ny09\"/><ref name=\"e09\">{{citation|contribution=Isometric diamond subgraphs|first=David|last=Eppstein|authorlink=David Eppstein|arxiv=0807.2218|title=[[International Symposium on Graph Drawing|Proc. 16th International Symposium on Graph Drawing, Heraklion, Crete, 2008]]|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=5417|year=2009|pages=384–389|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00219-9_37}}.</ref>\nBecause the diamond structure forms a [[Isometry|distance-preserving]] subset of the four-dimensional integer lattice, it is a [[partial cube]].<ref name=\"e09\"/>\n\nYet another coordinatization of the diamond cubic involves the removal of some of the edges from a three-dimensional grid graph.

      "title": "Dyadic cubes",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_cubes",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''dyadic cubes''' are a collection of [[cube (geometry)|cube]]s in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> of different sizes or scales such that the set of cubes of each scale [[partition of a set|partition]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and each cube in one scale may be written as a union of cubes of a smaller scale. These are frequently used in mathematics (particularly [[harmonic analysis]]) as a way of discretizing objects in order to make computations or analysis easier. For example, to study an arbitrary subset of ''A'' of [[Euclidean space]], one may instead replace it by a union of dyadic cubes of a particular size that [[Set cover|cover]] the set. One can consider this set as a pixelized version of the original set, and as smaller cubes are used one gets a clearer image of the set ''A''. Most notable appearances of dyadic cubes include the [[Whitney extension theorem]] and the [[Calderón–Zygmund lemma]].\n\n==Dyadic cubes in Euclidean space==\nIn Euclidean space, dyadic cubes may be constructed as follows: for each integer ''k'' let Δ<sub>''k''</sub> be the set of cubes in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> of sidelength 2<sup>−''k''</sup> and corners in the set\n\n:<math>2^{-k}\\mathbf{Z}^n= \\left \\{2^{-k}(v_1,\\dots,v_n):v_j \\in \\mathbf{Z} \\right \\}</math>\n\nand let Δ be the union of all the Δ<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\nThe most important features of these cubes are the following:\n\n# For each integer ''k'', Δ<sub>''k''</sub> partitions '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n# All cubes in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> have the same sidelength, namely 2<sup>−''k''</sup>.\n# If the [[Interior (topology)|interiors]] of two cubes ''Q'' and ''R'' in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> have nonempty intersection, then either ''Q'' is contained in ''R'' or ''R'' is contained in ''Q''.\n# Each ''Q'' in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> may be written as a union of 2<sup>''n''</sup> cubes in Δ<sub>''k''+1</sub> with disjoint interiors.\n\nWe use the word \"partition\" somewhat loosely: for although their union is all of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the cubes in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> can overlap at their boundaries. These overlaps, however, have [[Measure zero#Lebesgue measure|zero Lebesgue measure]], and so in most applications this slightly weaker form of partition is no hindrance.\n\nIt may also seem odd that larger ''k'' corresponds to smaller cubes. One can think of ''k'' as the degree of magnification. In practice, however, letting Δ<sub>''k''</sub> be the set of cubes of sidelength 2<sup>''k''</sup> or 2<sup>−''k''</sup> is a matter of preference or convenience.\n\n==The one-third trick==\nOne disadvantage to dyadic cubes in Euclidean space is that they rely too much on the specific position of the cubes. For example, for the dyadic cubes Δ described above, it is not possible to contain an arbitrary [[Ball (mathematics)#Balls in normed vector spaces|ball]] inside some ''Q'' in Δ (consider, for example, the unit ball centered at zero). Alternatively, there may be such a cube that contains the ball, but the sizes of the ball and cube are very different. Because of this caveat, it is sometimes useful to work with two or more collections of dyadic cubes simultaneously.\n\n===Definition===\nThe following is known as the '''one-third trick''':<ref>{{cite journal| last = Okikiolu| first = Kate| title = Characterization of subsets of rectifiable curves in R<sup>n</sup>| journal = J. London Math. Soc. |series=Series 2 | volume = 46 | year = 1992| number = 2| pages = 336–348}}</ref>\n\nLet Δ<sub>''k''</sub> be the dyadic cubes of scale ''k'' as above. Define\n\n:<math> \\Delta_k^\\alpha = \\{Q+\\alpha: Q\\in \\Delta_k \\}.</math>\n\nThis is the set of dyadic cubes in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> translated by the vector α. For each such α, let Δ<sup>α</sup> be the union of the Δ<sub>''k''</sub><sup>α</sup> over ''k''.\n\n* There is a universal constant ''C''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for any ball ''B'' with radius ''r''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1/3, there is α in {0,1/3}<sup>''n''</sup> and a cube ''Q'' in Δ<sup>α</sup> containing ''B'' whose diameter is no more than ''Cr''.\n* More generally, if ''B'' is a ball with ''any'' radius ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, there is α in {0,&nbsp;1/3,&nbsp;4/3,&nbsp;4<sup>2</sup>/3,&nbsp;...}<sup>''n''</sup> and a cube ''Q'' in Δ<sup>α</sup> containing ''B'' whose diameter is no more than ''Cr''.\n\n===An example application===\nThe appeal of the one-third trick is that one can first prove dyadic versions of a theorem and then deduce \"non-dyadic\" theorems from those. For example, recall the [[Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality|Hardy-Littlewood Maximal function]]\n\n:<math> Mf(x)=\\sup_{r>0}\\frac{1}{|B(x,r)|}\\int_{B(x,r)}|f(y)|dy</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is a [[locally integrable function]] and |''B''(''x'',&nbsp;''r'')| denotes the measure of the ball ''B''(''x'',&nbsp;''r''). The [[Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality#Hardy.E2.80.93Littlewood maximal inequality|Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality]] states that for an [[integrable]] function ''f'',\n\n:<math> \\left  |\\{x\\in\\mathbf{R}^{n}:Mf(x)>\\lambda\\} \\right | \\leq \\frac{C_n}{\\lambda}\\|f\\|_{1}</math>\n\nfor λ > 0 where ''C<sub>n</sub>'' is some constant depending only on dimension.\n\nThis theorem is typically proven using the [[Vitali covering lemma|Vitali Covering Lemma]]. However, one can avoid using this lemma by proving the above inequality first for the '''dyadic maximal functions'''\n\n:<math> M_{\\Delta^{\\alpha}}f(x)=\\sup_{x\\in Q\\in \\Delta^{\\alpha}}\\frac{1}{|Q|}\\int_{Q}|f(x)|dx.</math>\n\nThe proof is similar to the proof of the original theorem, however the properties of the dyadic cubes rid us of the need to use the Vitali covering lemma. We may then deduce the original inequality by using the one-third trick.\n\n==Dyadic cubes in metric spaces==\nAnalogues of dyadic cubes may be constructed in some [[metric spaces]].<ref>{{cite journal| last = Christ| first = Michael | title = A T(b) theorem with remarks on analytic capacity and the Cauchy integral|journal = Colloq. Math.| volume = 60/61| year = 1990| number = 2|pages =601–628}}</ref> In particular, let ''X'' be a metric space with metric ''d'' that supports a [[Doubling measures|doubling measure]] µ, that is, a measure such that for ''x'' ∈ ''X'' and ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, one has:\n\n:<math> \\mu(B(x,2r))\\leq C\\mu(B(x,r))</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' > 0 is a universal constant independent of the choice of ''x'' and ''r''.\n\nIf ''X'' supports such a measure, then there exist collections of sets Δ<sub>''k''</sub> such that they (and their union Δ) satisfy the following:\n\n* For each integer ''k'', Δ<sub>''k''</sub> partitions ''X'', in the sense that\n:: <math>\\mu \\left (X\\backslash \\bigcup\\nolimits_{Q\\in \\Delta_{k}}Q \\right )=0.</math>\n* All sets ''Q'' in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> have roughly the same size. More specifically, each such ''Q'' has a center ''z<sub>Q</sub>'' such that\n:: <math> B(z_{Q},c_{1}\\delta^{k})\\subseteq Q\\subseteq B(z_{Q},c_{2}\\delta^{k})</math> \n:where ''c''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''c''<sub>2</sub>, and ''δ'' are positive constants depending only on the doubling constant ''C'' of the measure µ and independent of ''Q''.\n* Each ''Q'' in Δ<sub>''k''</sub> is contained in a unique set ''R'' in Δ<sub>''k''−1</sub>.\n* There are constants constant ''C''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;η&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 depending only on µ such that for all ''k'' and ''t''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0,\n:: <math> \\mu \\left ( \\left \\{x\\in Q: d(x, X\\backslash Q)\\leq t\\delta^k \\right \\} \\right ) \\leq  C_3 t^\\eta \\mu(Q).</math>\n\nThese conditions are very similar to the properties for the usual Euclidean cubes described earlier. The last condition says that the area near the boundary of a \"cube\" ''Q'' in Δ is small, which is a property taken for granted in the Euclidean case although is very important for extending results from [[harmonic analysis]] to the metric space setting.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quadtree]]\n*[[Wavelet transform]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Harmonic analysis]]\n[[Category:Cubes]]"

In other words, it measures the minimum number of ''substitutions'' required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of ''errors'' that could have transformed one string into the other. In a more general context, the Hamming distance is one of several [[string metric]]s for measuring the [[edit distance]] between two sequences. It is named after the American mathematician [[Richard Hamming]].\n\nA major application is in [[coding theory]], more specifically to [[block code]]s, in which the equal-length strings are [[Vector space|vectors]] over a [[finite field]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe Hamming distance between:\n* \"'''</span>ka<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">rol</span>in</span>'''\" and \"'''</span>ka<span style=\"color:red;\">thr</span>in</span>'''\" is 3.\n* \"'''</span>k<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">a</span>r<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">ol</span>in</span>'''\" and \"'''</span>k<span style=\"color:red;\">e</span>r<span style=\"color:red;\">st</span>in</span>'''\" is 3.\n* '''10<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">1</span>1<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">1</span>01''' and '''10<span style=\"color:red;\">0</span>1<span style=\"color:red;\">0</span>01''' is 2.\n* '''2<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">17</span>3<span style=\"color:#0082ff\">8</span>96''' and '''2<span style=\"color:red;\">23</span>3<span style=\"color:red;\">7</span>96''' is 3.\n\n==Properties==\nFor a fixed length ''n'', the Hamming distance is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the set of the [[word (mathematics)|word]]s of length n (also known as a [[Hamming space]]), as it fulfills the conditions of non-negativity, [[identity of indiscernibles]] and symmetry, and it can be shown by [[complete induction]] that it satisfies the [[triangle inequality]] as well.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\"/> The Hamming distance between two words ''a'' and ''b'' can also be seen as the [[Hamming weight]] of ''a'' &minus; ''b'' for an appropriate choice of the &minus; operator, much as the difference between two integers can be seen as a distance from zero on the number line.\n\nFor binary strings ''a'' and ''b'' the Hamming distance is equal to the number of ones ([[Hamming weight|population count]]) in ''a'' [[Exclusive or|XOR]] ''b''.<ref name=\"Warren_2013\"/> The metric space of length-''n'' binary strings, with the Hamming distance, is known as the ''Hamming cube''; it is equivalent as a metric space to the set of distances between vertices in a [[hypercube graph]]. One can also view a binary string of length ''n'' as a vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> by treating each symbol in the string as a real coordinate; with this embedding, the strings form the vertices of an ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]], and the Hamming distance of the strings is equivalent to the [[Manhattan distance]] between the vertices.\n\n== Error detection and error correction ==\nThe '''minimum Hamming distance''' is used to define some essential notions in [[coding theory]], such as [[Error detection and correction|error detecting and error correcting codes]]. In particular, a [[code (coding theory)|code]] ''C'' is said to be ''k'' error detecting if, and only if, the minimum Hamming distance between any two of its codewords is at least ''k''+1.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\">{{cite book |author-first=Derek J.

In other words, a code is ''k''-errors correcting if, and only if, the minimum Hamming distance between any two of its codewords is at least 2''k''+1. This is more easily understood geometrically as any [[Ball (mathematics)#Balls in general metric spaces|closed balls]] of radius ''k'' centered on distinct codewords being disjoint.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\"/> These balls are also called ''[[Hamming sphere]]s'' in this context.<ref name=\"cc17\"/>\n\nThus a code with minimum Hamming distance ''d'' between its codewords can detect at most ''d''-1 errors and can correct ⌊(''d''-1)/2⌋ errors.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\"/> The latter number is also called the ''[[Sphere packing#Other spaces|packing radius]]'' or the ''error-correcting capability'' of the code.<ref name=\"cc17\">{{citation |title=Covering Codes |volume=54 |series=North-Holland Mathematical Library |author-first1=G. |author-last1=Cohen |author-first2=I. |author-last2=Honkala |author-first3=S. |author-last3=Litsyn |author-first4=A. |author-last4=Lobstein |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |date=1997 |isbn=9780080530079 |pages=16–17}}</ref>\n\n==History and applications==\n\nThe Hamming distance is named after [[Richard Hamming]], who introduced the concept in his fundamental paper on [[Hamming code]]s ''Error detecting and error correcting codes'' in 1950.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamming|first=R.

It is a [[Closed set|closed]], [[Compact space|compact]], [[Convex polytope|convex]] figure whose 1-[[N-skeleton|skeleton]] consists of groups of opposite [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[line segment]]s aligned in each of the space's [[dimension]]s, [[perpendicular]] to each other and of the same length.  A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in ''n'' dimensions is equal to <math>\\sqrt{n}</math>.\n\nAn ''n''-dimensional hypercube is more commonly referred to as an '''''n''-cube''' or sometimes as an '''''n''-dimensional cube'''.  The term '''measure polytope''' (originally from Elte, 1912)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Semiregular-Polytopes-Hyperspaces-Emanuel-Lodewijk/dp/141817968X|title=The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces|last=Elte|first=E. L.|publisher=[[University of Groningen]]|year=1912|location=Netherlands|chapter=IV, Five dimensional semiregular polytope}}</ref>  is also used, notably in the work of [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] who also labels the hypercubes the γ<small>n</small> polytopes.{{Sfn|Coxeter|1973|pp=122-123|loc=§7.2 see illustration Fig 7.2<small>C</small>}}\n\nThe hypercube is the special case of a [[hyperrectangle]] (also called an ''n-orthotope'').\n\nA ''unit hypercube'' is a hypercube whose side has length one [[unit (number)|unit]].  Often, the hypercube whose corners (or ''vertices'') are the 2<sup>''n''</sup> points in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called ''the'' unit hypercube.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Dimension levels.svg|thumb|350px|A diagram showing how to create a tesseract from a point.]]\n[[File:From Point to Tesseract (Looped Version).gif|thumb|An animation showing how to create a tesseract from a point.]]\n\nA hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape:\n\n:'''0''' – A point is a hypercube of dimension zero.\n:'''1''' – If one moves this point one unit length, it will sweep out a line segment, which is a unit hypercube of dimension one.\n:'''2''' – If one moves this line segment its length in a [[perpendicular]] direction from itself; it sweeps out a 2-dimensional square.\n:'''3''' – If one moves the square one unit length in the direction perpendicular to the plane it lies on, it will generate a 3-dimensional cube.\n:'''4''' – If one moves the cube one unit length into the fourth dimension, it generates a 4-dimensional unit hypercube (a unit [[tesseract]]).\n\nThis can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a [[Minkowski sum]]: the ''d''-dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of ''d'' mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a [[zonotope]].\n\nThe 1-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a hypercube is a [[hypercube graph]].\n\n==Coordinates==\nA unit hypercube of ''n'' dimensions is the [[convex hull]] of the points given by all sign permutations of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] <math>\\left(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\cdots, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>. It has an edge length of 1 and an ''n''-dimensional volume of 1.\n\nAn ''n''-dimensional hypercube is also often regarded as the convex hull of all sign permutations of the coordinates <math>(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\cdots, \\pm 1)</math>. This form is often chosen due to ease of writing out the coordinates. Its edge length is 2, and its ''n''-dimensional volume is 2<sup>n</sup>.\n\n==Elements==\nEvery ''n''-cube of n > 0 is composed of elements, or ''n''-cubes of a lower dimension, on the (''n''−1)-dimensional surface on the parent hypercube. A side is any element of (''n''−1)-dimension of the parent hypercube. A hypercube of dimension ''n'' has 2''n'' sides (a 1-dimensional line has 2 endpoints; a 2-dimensional square has 4 sides or edges; a 3-dimensional cube has 6 2-dimensional faces; a 4-dimensional tesseract has 8 cells). The number of vertices (points) of a hypercube is <math>2^{n}</math> (a cube has <math>2^{3}</math> vertices, for instance).\n\nThe number of ''m''-dimensional hypercubes (just referred to as ''m''-cube from here on) on the boundary of an ''n''-cube is\n\n:<math> E_{m,n} = 2^{n-m}{n \\choose m} </math>,{{sfn|Coxeter|1973|p=122|loc=§7·25}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where <math>{n \\choose m}=\\frac{n!}{m!\\,(n-m)!}</math> and ''n''! denotes the [[factorial]] of ''n''.\n\nFor example, the boundary of a 4-cube (n=4) contains 8 cubes (3-cubes), 24 squares (2-cubes), 32 lines (1-cubes) and 16 vertices (0-cubes).\n\nThis identity can be proved by combinatorial arguments; each of the <math>2^n</math> vertices defines a vertex in\na ''m''-dimensional boundary. There are <math>{n \\choose m}</math> ways of choosing which lines (\"sides\") that defines the subspace that the boundary is in. But, each side is counted <math>2^m</math> times since it has that many vertices, we need to divide by this number.\n\nThis identity can also be used to generate the formula for the ''n''-dimensional cube surface area. The surface area of a hypercube is: <math>2ns^{n-1}</math>.\n\nThese numbers can also be generated by the linear [[recurrence relation]]\n\n:<math>E_{m,n} = 2E_{m,n-1} + E_{m-1,n-1} \\!</math>, &nbsp; &nbsp; with <math>E_{0,0} = 1 \\!</math>, &nbsp;and undefined elements (where <math>n < m</math>, <math>n < 0</math>, or <math>m < 0</math> ) <math>=0</math>.\n\nFor example, extending a square via its 4 vertices adds one extra line (edge) per vertex, and also adds the final second square, to form a cube, giving <math>E_{1,3} \\!</math> = 12 lines in total.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nHypercube elements <math>E_{m,n} \\!</math> {{OEIS|A038207}}\n|-\n! || || || m|| 0|| 1|| 2|| 3|| 4|| 5|| 6|| 7|| 8|| 9|| 10\n|-\n!

The other two are the hypercube dual family, the '''[[cross-polytope]]s''', labeled as ''β<sub>n,</sub>'' and the '''[[simplex|simplices]]''', labeled as ''α<sub>n</sub>''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellations of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''δ<sub>n</sub>''.\n\nAnother related family of semiregular and [[uniform polytope]]s is the '''[[demihypercube]]s''', which are constructed from hypercubes with alternate vertices deleted and [[simplex]] facets added in the gaps, labeled as ''hγ<sub>n</sub>''.\n\n''n''-cubes can be combined with their duals (the [[cross-polytope]]s) to form compound polytopes:\n\n*In two dimensions, we obtain the [[octagram]]mic star figure {8/2},\n*In three dimensions we obtain the [[compound of cube and octahedron]],\n*In four dimensions we obtain the [[compound of tesseract and 16-cell]].\n\n==Relation to ''n''-simplices==\nThe graph of the ''n''-hypercube's edges is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Hasse diagram]] of the (''n''-1)-[[simplex]]'s [[Convex polytope#The face lattice|face lattice]]. This can be seen by orienting the ''n''-hypercube so that two opposite vertices lie vertically, corresponding to the (''n''-1)-simplex itself and the null polytope, respectively. Each vertex connected to the top vertex then uniquely maps to one of the (''n''-1)-simplex's facets (''n''-2 faces), and each vertex connected to those vertices maps to one of the simplex's ''n''-3 faces, and so forth, and the vertices connected to the bottom vertex map to the simplex's vertices.\n\nThis relation may be used to generate the face lattice of an (''n-1'')-simplex efficiently, since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are more computationally expensive.\n\n==Generalized hypercubes==\nRegular [[Complex polytope#Regular_complex_polytopes|complex polytopes]] can be defined in [[Complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] called ''generalized hypercubes'', &gamma;{{supsub|''p''|''n''}} = <sub>''p''</sub>{4}<sub>2</sub>{3}...<sub>2</sub>{3}<sub>2</sub>, or {{CDD|pnode_1|4|node|3}}..{{CDD|3|node|3|node}}.

For ''p''>2, they exist in <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>. The facets are generalized (''n''-1)-cube and the [[vertex figure]] are regular [[simplex]]es.\n\nThe [[regular polygon]] perimeter seen in these orthogonal projections is called a [[petrie polygon]]. The generalized squares (n=2) are shown with edges outlined as red and blue alternating color ''p''-edges, while the higher n-cubes are drawn with black outlined ''p''-edges.\n\nThe number of ''m''-face elements in a ''p''-generalized ''n''-cube are: <math> p^{n-m}{n \\choose m}</math>.

Other variations of the impossible cube combine these features in different ways; for instance, the one shown in the illustration draws all eight joints according to one interpretation of the Necker cube and both crossings according to the other interpretation.\nThe apparent solidity of the beams gives the impossible cube greater visual ambiguity than the Necker cube, which is less likely to be perceived as an impossible object. The illusion plays on the human eye's interpretation of two-dimensional pictures as three-dimensional objects. It is possible for three-dimensional objects to have the visual appearance of the impossible cube when seen from certain angles, either by making carefully placed cuts in the supposedly solid beams or by using [[forced perspective]], but human experience with right-angled objects makes the impossible appearance seem more likely than the reality.<ref name=\"new angle\">{{citation|journal=Perception|year=1984|volume=13|pages=153–154|title=A new angle on the freemish crate|author=Nancy E Smith|pmid=6504675|doi=10.1068/p130153}}.</ref>\n\nOther artists than Escher, including [[Jos De Mey]], have also made artworks featuring the impossible cube.<ref>{{citation\n | author = [[Jos De Mey]]\n | editor1-last = Schattschneider | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Emmer | editor2-first = M.\n | contribution = Painting After M.

      "text": "{{for|Keller's conjecture about polynomial maps|Jacobian conjecture}}\n[[File:Shifted square tiling.svg|thumb|160px|In this tiling of the plane by congruent squares, the green and violet squares meet edge-to-edge as do the blue and orange squares.]]\nIn geometry, '''Keller's conjecture''' is the conjecture that in any [[Tessellation|tiling]] of [[Euclidean space]] by identical [[hypercube]]s there are two cubes that meet face to face. For instance, as shown in the illustration, in any tiling of the plane by identical squares, some two squares must meet edge to edge.\n\nThis conjecture was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Keller|first=Ott-Heinrich|authorlink=Ott-Heinrich Keller|year=1930}}, after whom it is named. It was shown to be true in dimensions at most 6 by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Oskar Perron|last=Perron|year1=1940a|year2=1940b}}. However, for higher dimensions it is false, as was shown in dimensions at least 10 by {{harvs|txt|last=Lagarias|author1-link=Jeffrey Lagarias|author2-link=Peter Shor|last2=Shor|year= 1992}} and in dimensions at least 8 by {{harvtxt|Mackey|2002}}. These disproofs used a reformulation of the problem in terms of the [[clique number]] of certain graphs now known as '''Keller graphs'''. Although this graph-theoretic version of the conjecture is now resolved for all dimensions, Keller's original cube-tiling conjecture remains open in dimension 7.\n\nThe related [[Hajós's theorem|Minkowski lattice cube-tiling conjecture]] states that, whenever a tiling of space by identical cubes has the additional property that the cube centers form a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]], some cubes must meet face to face. It was proved by [[György Hajós]] in 1942.\n\n{{harvtxt|Szabó|1993}}, {{harvtxt|Shor|2004}}, and {{harvtxt|Zong|2005}} give surveys of work on Keller's conjecture and related problems.\n\n==Definitions==\nA family of [[closed set]]s called ''tiles'' forms a [[tessellation]] or tiling of a Euclidean space if their union is the whole space and every two distinct sets in the family have disjoint interiors. A tiling is said to be ''monohedral'' if all of the tiles are congruent to each other. Keller's conjecture concerns monohedral tilings in which all of the tiles are [[hypercube]]s of the same dimension as the space. As {{harvtxt|Szabó|1986}} formulates the problem, a ''cube tiling'' is a tiling by congruent hypercubes in which the tiles are additionally required to all be [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] of each other, without any rotation, or equivalently to have all of their sides parallel to the coordinate axes of the space. Not every tiling by congruent cubes has this property: for instance, three-dimensional space may be tiled by two-dimensional sheets of cubes that are twisted at arbitrary angles with respect to each other. {{harvtxt|Shor|2004}} instead defines a cube tiling to be any tiling of space by congruent hypercubes, and states without proof that the assumption that cubes are axis-parallel can be added without loss of generality.\n\nAn ''n''-dimensional hypercube has 2''n'' faces of dimension ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, that are themselves hypercubes; for instance, a square has four edges, and a three-dimensional cube has six square faces. Two tiles in a cube tiling (defined in either of the above ways) meet ''face-to-face'' if there is an (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-dimensional hypercube that is a face of both of them. Keller's conjecture is the statement that every cube tiling has at least one pair of tiles that meet face-to-face in this way.\n\nThe original version of the conjecture stated by Keller was for a stronger statement, that every cube tiling has a column of cubes all meeting face to face. As with the weaker statement more commonly studied in subsequent research, this is true for dimensions up to six, false for dimensions eight or greater, and remains open for seven dimensions {{harvs|last1=Łysakowska|last2=Przesławski|year1=2008|year2=2011}}\n\n[[File:Academ Periodic tiling by squares of two different sizes.svg|thumb|The [[Pythagorean tiling]] shows that unequal squares can tile the plane without meeting edge-to-edge.]]\nIt is a necessary part of the conjecture that the cubes in the tiling all be congruent to each other, for if similar but not congruent cubes are allowed then the [[Pythagorean tiling]] would form a trivial counterexample in two dimensions.\n\n==Group-theoretic reformulation==\nThe disproof of Keller's conjecture, for sufficiently high dimensions, has progressed through a sequence of reductions that transform it from a problem in the geometry of tilings into a problem in [[group theory]], and from there into a problem in [[graph theory]].\n\n{{harvtxt|Hajós|1949}} first reformulated Keller's conjecture in terms of factorizations of [[abelian group]]s. He shows that, if there is a counterexample to the conjecture, then it can be assumed to be a [[periodic tiling]] of cubes with an integer side length and integer vertex positions; thus, in studying the conjecture, it is sufficient to consider tilings of this special form. In this case, the group of integer translations, modulo the translations that preserve the tiling, forms an abelian group, and certain elements of this group correspond to the positions of the tiles. Hajós defines a family of subsets ''A<sub>i</sub>'' of an abelian group to be a ''factorization'' if each element of the group has a unique expression as a sum ''a''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;..., where each ''a<sub>i</sub>'' belongs to ''A<sub>i</sub>''. With this definition, Hajós' reformulated conjecture is that, whenever an Abelian group has a factorization in which the first set ''A''<sub>0</sub> may be arbitrary but each subsequent set ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> takes the special form {0,&nbsp;''g''<sub>i</sub>,&nbsp;2''g''<sub>i</sub>,&nbsp;3''g''<sub>i</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;(''q<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)''g<sub>i</sub>''}, then at least one of the elements ''q<sub>i</sub>g<sub>i</sub>'' must belong to ''A''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&minus;''A''<sub>0</sub> (the [[sumset|difference set]] of ''A''<sub>0</sub> with itself).\n\n{{harvtxt|Szabó|1986}} showed that any tiling that forms a counterexample to the conjecture can be assumed to have an even more special form: the cubes have side length a power of two and integer vertex coordinates, and the tiling is periodic with period twice the side length of the cubes in each coordinate direction. Based on this geometric simplification, he also simplified Hajós' group-theoretic formulation, showing that it is sufficient to consider abelian groups that are the direct sums of [[cyclic group]]s of order four, and with each ''q<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.\n\n==Keller graphs==\n[[File:Keller-labeled Clebsch.svg|thumb|240px|The Keller graph of dimension two, isomorphic to the [[Clebsch graph]].]]\n{{harvtxt|Corrádi|Szabó|1990}} reformulated Szabó's result as a condition about the existence of a large [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a certain family of graphs, which subsequently became known as the '''Keller graphs'''. More precisely, the vertices of the Keller graph of dimension ''n'' are the 4<sup>''n''</sup> elements (''m''<sub>1</sub>,...,''m''<sub>''n''</sub>) where each ''m'' is 0, 1, 2, or 3. Two vertices are joined by an edge if they differ in at least two coordinates and differ by exactly two in at least one coordinate. Corrádi and Szabó showed that the [[maximum clique]] in this graph has size at most 2<sup>''n''</sup>, and that if there is a clique of this size then Keller's conjecture is false. Given such a clique, one can form a covering of space by cubes of side two whose centers have coordinates that, when taken modulo four, are vertices of the clique. The condition that any two vertices of the clique have a coordinate that differs by two implies that cubes corresponding to these vertices do not overlap. The condition that the clique has size 2<sup>''n''</sup> implies that the cubes within any period of the tiling have the same total volume as the period itself. Together with the fact that they don't overlap, this implies that the cubes placed in this way tile space. However, the condition that any two clique vertices differ in at least two coordinates implies that no two cubes have a face in common.\n\n{{harvs|txt|last=Lagarias|last2=Shor|year= 1992}} disproved Keller's conjecture by [[Clique problem|finding a clique]] of size 2<sup>10</sup> in the Keller graph of dimension 10. This clique leads to a non-face-to-face tiling in dimension 10, and copies of it can be stacked (offset by half a unit in each coordinate direction) to produce non-face-to-face tilings in any higher dimension. Similarly, {{harvtxt|Mackey|2002}} reduced the dimension in which a counterexample to the conjecture is known by finding a clique of size 2<sup>8</sup> in the Keller graph of dimension eight.\n\nFinally, {{harvtxt|Debroni|Eblen|Langston|Shor|2011}} showed that  the Keller graph of dimension seven has a maximum clique of size 124&nbsp;<&nbsp; 2<sup>7</sup>. Because this is less than 2<sup>7</sup>, the graph-theoretic version of Keller's conjecture is true in seven dimensions. However, the translation from cube tilings to graph theory can change the dimension of the problem, so this result doesn't settle the geometric version of the conjecture in seven dimensions.\n\nThe sizes of the maximum cliques in the smaller Keller graphs of dimensions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are, respectively, 2, 5, 12, 28, and 60. The Keller graphs of dimensions 4, 5, and 6 have been included in the set of \"DIMACS challenge graphs\" frequently used as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for [[Clique problem|clique-finding algorithms]] {{harv|Johnson|Trick|1996}}.\n\n==Related problems==\nAs {{harvtxt|Szabó|1993}} describes, [[Hermann Minkowski]] was led to a special case of the cube-tiling conjecture from a problem in [[diophantine approximation]]. One consequence of [[Minkowski's theorem]] is that any [[lattice (group)|lattice]] (normalized to have [[determinant]] one) must contain a nonzero point whose [[Chebyshev distance]] to the origin is at most one. The lattices that do not contain a nonzero point with Chebyshev distance strictly less than one are called critical, and the points of a critical lattice form the centers of the cubes in a cube tiling. Minkowski conjectured in 1900 that, whenever a cube tiling has its cubes centered at lattice points in this way, it must contain two cubes that meet face to face. If this is true, then (because of the symmetries of the lattice) each cube in the tiling must be part of a column of cubes, and the cross-sections of these columns form a cube tiling of one smaller dimension. Reasoning in this way, Minkowski showed that (assuming the truth of his conjecture) every critical lattice has a basis that can be expressed as a [[triangular matrix]], with ones on its main diagonal and numbers less than one away from the diagonal. [[György Hajós]] proved Minkowski's conjecture in 1942 using [[Hajós's theorem]] on factorizations of abelian groups, a similar group-theoretic method to the one that he would later apply to Keller's more general conjecture.\n\nKeller's conjecture is a variant of Minkowski's conjecture in which the condition that the cube centers form a lattice is relaxed. A second related conjecture, made by Furtwängler in 1936, instead relaxes the condition that the cubes form a tiling. Furtwängler asked whether a system of cubes centered on lattice points, forming a ''k''-fold covering of space (that is, all but a measure-zero subset of the points in the space must be interior to exactly ''k'' cubes) must necessarily have two cubes meeting face to face. Furtwängler's conjecture is true for two- and three-dimensional space, but Hajós found a four-dimensional counterexample in 1938. {{harvtxt|Robinson|1979}} characterized the combinations of ''k'' and the dimension ''n'' that permit a counterexample. Additionally, combining both Furtwängler's and Keller's conjectures, Robinson showed that ''k''-fold square coverings of the Euclidean plane must include two squares that meet edge to edge. However, for every ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 and every ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 there is a ''k''-fold tiling of ''n''-dimensional space by cubes with no shared faces {{harv|Szabó|1982}}.\n\nOnce counterexamples to Keller's conjecture became known, it became of interest to ask for the maximum dimension of a shared face that can be guaranteed to exist in a cube tiling. When the dimension ''n'' is at most six, this maximum dimension is just ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, by Perron's proof of Keller's conjecture for small dimensions, and when ''n'' is at least eight, then this maximum dimension is at most ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2. {{harvtxt|Lagarias|Shor|1994}} showed more strongly that it is at most ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;{{radic|''n''}}/3.\n\n{{harvtxt|Iosevich|Pedersen|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Lagarias|Reeds|Wang|2000}} found close connections between cube tilings and the [[spectral theory]] of [[square-integrable function]]s on the cube.\n\n{{harvtxt|Dutour Sikirić|Itoh|Poyarkov|2007}} use cliques in the Keller graphs that are [[maximal clique|maximal]] but not maximum to study packings of cubes into space that cannot be extended by adding any additional cubes.\n\nIn 1975, Ludwig Danzer and independently [[Branko Grünbaum]] and [[G. C. Shephard]] found a tiling of three-dimensional space by [[parallelepiped]]s with 60° and 120° face angles in which no two parallelepipeds share a face; see {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1980}}.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Corrádi | first1=K. | last2=Szabó | first2=S. | title=A combinatorial approach for Keller's conjecture | doi=10.1007/BF01946848 |mr=1070948 | year=1990 | journal=Periodica Mathematica Hungarica.

This will sub-divide the cube into 27 smaller cubes.\n# Remove the smaller cube in the middle of each face, and remove the smaller cube in the very center of the larger cube, leaving 20 smaller cubes (''Image 2 - second from left''). This is a level-1 Menger sponge (resembling a [[Void Cube]]).\n# Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of the remaining smaller cubes, and continue to iterate ''ad infinitum''.\n\nThe second iteration gives a level-2 sponge (''Image 2 - third from left''), the third iteration gives a level-3 sponge (''Image 2 - 4th from left''), and so on. The Menger sponge itself is the limit of this process after an infinite number of iterations.\n\n[[File:Menger sponge (Level 0-3).jpg|thumb|none|500px|Image 2: An illustration of the iterative construction of a Menger sponge up to ''M''<sub>3</sub>, the third iteration.]]\n[[File:Mengersponge.gif|thumb|250px| Menger sponge animation through (4) recursion steps.]]\n\n==Properties==\n[[File:Menger_sponge_diagonal_section.png|thumb|link=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Menger_sponge_diagonal_section.svg|True view of the cross-section of a level-4 Menger sponge through its centroid and perpendicular to a space diagonal.

Yet any chosen surface in the construction will be thoroughly punctured as the construction continues, so that the limit is neither a solid nor a surface; it has a topological dimension of 1 and is accordingly identified as a curve.\n\nEach face of the construction becomes a [[Sierpinski carpet]], and the intersection of the sponge with any diagonal of the cube or any midline of the faces is a [[Cantor set]].

The [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of the Menger sponge is one, the same as any [[curve]]. Menger showed, in the 1926 construction, that the sponge is a '''universal curve''', in that every {{Interlanguage link multi|Uryson's curve|ru|3=Кривая Урысона|lt=curve}} is [[homeomorphic]] to a subset of the Menger sponge, where a '''curve''' means any [[compact space|compact]] [[metric space]] of Lebesgue covering dimension one; this includes [[tree (graph theory)|trees]] and [[graph theory|graphs]] with an arbitrary [[countable]] number of edges, vertices and closed loops, connected in arbitrary ways. In a similar way, the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is a universal curve for all curves that can be drawn on the two-dimensional plane. The Menger sponge constructed in three dimensions extends this idea to graphs that are not [[Planar graph|planar]], and might be embedded in any number of dimensions.\n\nThe Menger sponge is a [[closed set]]; since it is also bounded, the [[Heine&ndash;Borel theorem]] implies that it is [[compact set|compact]].

The Necker cube is sometimes used to test computer models of the human visual system to see whether they can arrive at consistent interpretations of the image the same way humans do.\n\nHumans do not usually see an inconsistent interpretation of the cube. A cube whose edges cross in an inconsistent way is an example of an [[impossible object]], specifically an [[impossible cube]] (compare [[Penrose triangle]]).\n\nWith the cube on the left, most people see the lower-left face as being in front most of the time. This is possibly because people view objects from above, with the top side visible, far more often than from below, with the bottom visible, so the brain \"prefers\" the interpretation that the cube is viewed from above.{{sfn|Troje|McAdam|2010}}{{sfn|Ward|Scholl|2015|p=931}} Another reason behind this may be due to the brain's natural preference  of viewing things from left to right,{{sfn|Khan|Crawford|2001}} therefore seeing the leftmost square as being in front.\n\nThere is evidence that by focusing on different parts of the figure, one can force a more stable perception of the cube. The intersection of the two faces that are parallel to the observer forms a rectangle, and the lines that converge on the square form a \"y-junction\" at the two diagonally opposite sides. If an observer focuses on the upper \"y-junction\" the lower left face will appear to be in front. The upper right face will appear to be in front if the eyes focus on the lower junction.{{sfn|Einhäuser|Martin|König|2004}} Blinking while being on the second perception will probably cause you to switch to the first one.\n[[Image:2 necker cubes.svg|300px|thumb|This is an example of two identical necker cubes, the one on the left showing an intermediate object (blue bar) going in \"down from the top\" while the one on the right shows the object going in \"up from the bottom\" which shows how the image can change its perspective simply by changing which face (front or back) appears behind the intervening object.]]\n\nIt is possible to cause the switch to occur by focusing on different parts of the cube. If one sees the first interpretation on the right it is possible to cause a switch to the second by focusing on the base of the cube until the switch occurs to the second interpretation. Similarly, if one is viewing the second interpretation, focusing on the left side of the cube may cause a switch to the first.\n\nThe Necker cube has shed light on the human visual system.{{sfn|Ward|Scholl|2015}} The phenomenon has served as evidence of the [[human brain]] being a [[Biological neural network|neural network]] with two distinct equally possible interchangeable stable states.{{sfn|Marr|1982}} [[Sidney Bradford]], [[blindness|blind]] from the age of ten months but regaining his sight following an operation at age 52, did not perceive the ambiguity that normal-sighted observers do, but rather perceived only a flat image.{{sfn|Gregory|2004}}{{sfn|Troje|McAdam|2010}}\n\nDuring the 1970s, undergraduates in the Psychology Department of City University, London, were provided with assignments to measure their Introversion-Extroversion orientations by the time it took for them to switch between the Front and Back perceptions of the Necker Cube.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Apparent viewpoint==\nThe orientation of the Necker cube can also be altered by shifting the observer's point of view.  When seen from apparent above, one face tends to be seen closer; and in contrast, when seen from a subjective viewpoint that is below, a different face comes to the fore.{{sfn|Martelli|Kubovy|Claessens|1998}}\n\n==References in popular culture==\nThe Necker cube is discussed to such extent in [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s 1998 [[science fiction]] novel ''Factoring Humanity'' that \"Necker\" becomes a verb, meaning to impel one's brain to switch from one perspective or perception to another.{{sfn|Sawyer|1998|pp=233, 256, 299, et al.}}\n\nThe Necker cube is used to illustrate how vampires in the science fiction novels ''[[Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight]]'' and ''[[Echopraxia (novel)|Echopraxia]]'' have superior pattern recognition skills. One of the pieces of evidence is that vampires can see both interpretations of the Necker Cube simultaneously which sets them apart from baseline humanity.{{sfn|Watts|2006|pp=42, 284}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Multistable perception]]\n* [[Rhombille tiling]]\n* [[Spinning Dancer]]\n* [[Ambigram]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Citations'''\n* {{cite journal |last=Einhäuser |first=W. |last2=Martin |first2=K.A.C. |last3=König |first3=P. |year=2004 |title=Are switches in perception of the Necker cube related to eye position? |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=10 |pages=2811–2818 |pmid=15548224 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03722.x |ref=harv|citeseerx=10.1.1.71.6358 }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=R. |date=August 2004 |title=The Blind Leading the Sighted: An Eye-Opening Experience of the Wonders of Perception |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=7002 |pages=836 |pmid=15318199 |doi=10.1038/430836a |url=http://www.richardgregory.org/papers/articles/seeing-after-blindness.pdf |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=Aarlenne |last2=Crawford |first2=J.

Its side length is approximately 6% larger than that of the unit cube through which it passes. The problem of finding the largest square that lies entirely within a unit cube is closely related, and has the same solution.<ref name=\"rickey\"/><ref name=\"jw04\"/><ref name=\"gardner\"/>\n\nThe original proposition posed by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] was that a cube could be passed through a hole made in another cube ''of the same size'' without splitting the cube into two pieces.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Prince_Rupert_cube.svg|thumb|A trimetric projection of a cube with unit side length with selected dimensions labelled &ndash; the green dash-dot line shows a unit square (cross-section of a unit cube) in the hole (blue dashed line)]]\nIf two points are placed on two adjacent edges of a unit cube, each at a distance of 3/4 from the point where the two edges meet, then the distance between the two points will be\n: <math>\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 1.0606601.</math>\nThese two points, together with a second set of two points placed symmetrically on the opposite face of the cube, form the four vertices of a square that lies entirely within the unit cube. This square, extruded in both directions perpendicularly to itself, forms the hole through which a cube larger than the original one (up to side length <math>\\tfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}</math>) may pass.<ref name=\"gardner\"/>\n\nThe parts of the unit cube that remain, after emptying this hole, form two [[triangular prism]]s and two irregular [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], connected by thin bridges at the four vertices of the square.\nEach prism has as its six vertices two adjacent vertices of the cube, and four points along the edges of the cube at distance 1/4 from these cube vertices. Each tetrahedron has as its four vertices one vertex of the cube, two points at distance 3/4 from it on two of the adjacent edges, and one point at distance 3/16 from the cube vertex along the third adjacent edge.<ref name=\"wells\"/>\n[[File:Prince Rupert's cube.stl|thumb|A unit cube with a hole cut through it (3D model)]]\n\n==History==\nPrince Rupert's cube is named after [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]. According to a story recounted in 1693 by English mathematician [[John Wallis]], Prince Rupert wagered that a hole could be cut through a cube, large enough to let another cube of the same size pass through it. Wallis showed that in fact such a hole was possible (with some errors that were not corrected until much later), and Prince Rupert won his wager.<ref name=\"rickey\"/><ref name=\"jw04\"/>\n\nWallis assumed that the hole would be parallel to a [[space diagonal]] of the cube. The [[Orthographic projection|projection]] of the cube onto a plane perpendicular to this diagonal is a [[regular hexagon]], and the best hole parallel to the diagonal can be found by drawing the largest possible square that can be inscribed into this hexagon. Calculating the size of this square shows that a cube with side length\n:<math>\\sqrt 6 -\\sqrt 2\\approx 1.03527</math>,\nslightly larger than one, is capable of passing through the hole.<ref name=\"rickey\"/>\n\nApproximately 100 years later, Dutch mathematician [[Pieter Nieuwland]] found that a better solution (in fact, the optimal solution) may be achieved by using a hole with a different angle than the space diagonal. Nieuwland died in 1794 (a year after taking a position as a professor at the [[University of Leiden]]) but his solution was published posthumously in 1816 by Nieuwland's mentor, [[Jean Henri van Swinden]].<ref name=\"rickey\">{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705014816/http://www.math.usma.edu/people/Rickey/papers/ShortCourseAlbuquerque.pdf|title=Dürer’s Magic Square, Cardano’s Rings, Prince Rupert’s Cube, and Other Neat Things|year=2005|first=V.

Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences and conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory, artist or discourse. With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century this period can be characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with [[Fauvism]]). It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase of an [[art movement]] that would become altogether more extreme, known from the spring of 1911 as [[Cubism]].\n\nProto-Cubist artworks typically depict objects in geometric schemas of cubic or conic shapes. The illusion of classical [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] is progressively stripped away from objective representation to reveal the constructive essence of the physical world (not just as seen). The term is applied not only to works of this period by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], but to a range of art produced in France during the early 1900s, by such artists as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and to variants developed elsewhere in Europe. Proto-Cubist works embrace many disparate styles, and would affect diverse individuals, groups and movements, ultimately forming a fundamental stage in the history of [[modern art]] of the [[20th-century art|20th-century]].<ref name=\"Christopher Green\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]</ref>\n\n==History and influences==\nThe building blocks that led to the construction of proto-Cubist works are diverse in nature. Neither homogeneous nor isotropic, the progression of each individual artist was unique. The influences that characterize this transition period range from [[Post-Impressionism]], to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Les Nabis]] and [[Neo-Impressionism]], the works of [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Egypt]]ian, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Micronesia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].\n\nIn anticipation of Proto-Cubism the idea of form inherent in art since the [[Renaissance]] had been questioned. The [[Romanticism|romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], the [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Gustave Courbet]], and practically all the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had abandoned a significant portion of [[Classicism]] in favor of ''immediate sensation''. The ''dynamic'' expression favored by these artists presented a challenge in contrast to the ''static'' means of expression promoted by the Academia. The representation of fixed objects occupying a space, was replaced by dynamic colors and form in constant evolution. Yet other means would be necessary to jettison completely the long-standing foundation that surrounded them. While the freedom of Impressionism had certainly jeopardized its integrity, it would take another generation of artists, not just to bring the edifice down piece by piece, but to rebuild an entirely new configuration, ''cube by cube''.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\">[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]</ref>\n\n===Cézanne===\n[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierot and Harlequin)'', oil on canvas, {{convert|102|x|81|cm|in|abbr=on}}, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]\nSeveral predominant factors mobilized the shift from a more representational art form to one that would become increasingly abstract; one of the most important would be found directly within the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and exemplified in a widely discussed letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904. Cézanne ambiguously writes: \"Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point.\"<ref name=\"Erle Loran\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&source=bl&ots=VWN2A52aTk&sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&f=false Erle Loran, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Foreword by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, April 30, 2006</ref>\n\nIn addition to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object turns away from the source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.<ref name=\"Erle Loran\" />\n\nThe art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] acknowledged the importance of Cézanne to the Cubists in his article titled ''From Cézanne to Cubism'' (published in ''Eclair'', 1920). For Vauxcelles the influence had a two-fold character, both 'architectural' and 'intellectual'. He stressed the statement made by [[Émile Bernard]] that Cézanne's optics were \"not in the eye, but in his brain\".<ref>Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987, p. 192</ref>\n\n[[File:La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue de la carrière Bibémus, par Paul Cézanne.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Paul Cézanne]], ca.1897, ''Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from the Bibémus Quarry'', oil on canvas, 65 x 81 cm, [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].

He combined on the one hand the imitative and the ''immobile'', a system left over from the Renaissance, and the ''mobile'' on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, precisely because of this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\" /><ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Robert L.

A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904. Current works were exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which some of these artist made the transition from [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] to [[Cubism]].<ref name=\"Moser\">Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

At the time, it was assumed that all art aims at beauty, and anything that wasn't beautiful couldn't be counted as art. The proto-Cubists revolted against the concept that objective beauty was central to the definition of art.<ref>Arthur Coleman Danto, ''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}</ref><ref>Brian Massumi, ''Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the Philosophy of Expression'', CRCL, 24:3, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\nIn his ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] reviews the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] roots of modern art, exploring the literary source of both [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting in France and [[Futurism]] in Italy.<ref name=\"Robbins, 1981\">[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776441?uid=3737952&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101725009653 Daniel Robbins, ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', Art Journal, Vol. 41, No. 4, (Winter 1981): pp. 324-27], Published by College Art Association</ref> The revolution of ''free verse'' with which [[Gustave Kahn]] was associated, was a principle example of the correspondence between progress in art and politics; a growing conviction among young artists. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] acknowledged his indebtedness to it, as a source of modern artistic liberty. \"[[Paul Fort]]'s Parisian review ''Vers et Prose''\", writes Robbins, \"as well as the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], cradle of both [[Jules Romain (author)|Jules Romain]]'s [[Unanimism]] and [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]'s ''Dramatisme'', had emphasized the importance of this new formal device\".<ref name=\"Robbins, 1981\" /> Kahn's free verse was revolutionary because, in his own words, \"free verse is mobile, like mobile perspective\". In classical French poetry, writes Robbins, \"meaning and rhythm were united, and sense and rhythm stopped simultaneously. The unity consisted in the number and rhythm of vowels and consonants together forming an organic and independent cell\". The system began to break down, according to Kahn, with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets when they permitted a stop for the ear, with ''no'' stop in meaning. This is akin to [[Jacques Villon]]'s drawings and prints of 1908 and 1909, notes Robbins, \"where the hatching lines that create a shape do not stop at the contour, but continue beyond, taking on an independent life\".<ref name=\"Robbins, 1981\" />\n\nThe next step, wrote Kahn, was to impart unity and cohesion by means of a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed the beat of the [[strophe]]. As Kahn noted, this was shocking because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the [[metronome]]-like symmetry and introduced ''liberty'', ''flexibility'' and ''elasticity''. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' would undermine the French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.<ref name=\"Robbins, 1981\" />\n\n''Elasticity'', one of Kahn's favorite words used to describe free verse, would become the title of well known Futurist works by [[Umberto Boccioni]], as well as two paintings by [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], a proto-Cubist work and later a cubist work entitled ''Marie Ressort'' (''ressort'' meaning elasticity or spring). These paintings, writes Robbins, are an homage to the prose of [[Jules Laforgue]], whose poems concerned the life of his sister Marie.<ref name=\"Robbins, 1981\" />\n\n====Pablo Picasso====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = El Greco, c.1609-14, The Vision of Saint John, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg\n| width1 = 190\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[El Greco]], ''[[The Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (c.1609–14, oil, 224.8 × 199.4&nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) has been suggested to be the prime source of inspiration for Picasso's {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}}.\n| image2 = Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907, oil on canvas, 243.9&nbsp;×&nbsp;233.7&nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]]) appears to have certain morphological and stylistic similarities with ''The Opening of the Fifth Seal''.\n| footer = \n}}\nIn 1899 Picasso rejected academic study and joined a circle of avant-garde artists and writers known as ''[[Modernisme|modernistes]]'' or ''decadentes''.

Yet, in addition to the influence of [[Théophile Steinlen]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], that of [[Francisco Goya]]<ref>[http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm Goya and Modernism, Bienal Internacional de São Paulo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117072537/http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm |date=2008-01-17 }} Retrieved 27 July 2007</ref> and [[El Greco]] can be seen in Picasso's work of the period. A significant innovation of El Greco's later works is the interweaving of form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two that unifies the painted surface.

Gleizes is responsible for the ''Literary'' and ''Artistic'' section which organises street theatre and poetry readings.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n\nThroughout 1906, Gleizes and his associates pursue an idea proposed by Charles Vildrac of establishing of a self-supporting artists community which would enable them to develop their art free of commercial considerations. A suitable house and grounds is found in Créteil, then a small village outside Paris. The rent for the first six months is provided by Barzun through a small inheritance. In December, Gleizes and Vildrac move in.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /> At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] consists of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel.

Ghil held open evenings every Friday, attended by the members of the Abbaye.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /> The Abbaye published books by a wide variety of authors including [[:fr:Robert de Montesqiou|Robert de Montesqiou]], model for the Duc de Charlus in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A la recherche de temps perdu'', the Polish anarchist and art theorist [[:fr:Mecislas Goldberg|Mecislas Goldberg]], and the well-known collection of poems ''La Vie Unanime'', by [[Jules Romains]].<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /> ''La Vie Unanime'' was the result of a vision Romains had in 1903, writes Peter Brooke, \"in which he had seen all the phenomena of daily life as intimately related like the different parts of a single huge beast\". On the strength of its association with Romains the Abbaye de Créteil is often described as 'Unanimist'.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n \nDuring the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organise a great ''Journée portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, soon to be the theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Gleizes' own painting in this period shifts from Post-Impressionism towards a fluid, linear style, with close relations to Symbolism and [[Les Nabis]].<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n\nWhen the Abbaye closed in January 1908, Gleizes moved into a studio situated in [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], rue du Delta, with his friend the painter and poet [[:fr:Henri Doucet|Henri Doucet]]. Though his subject matter is always taken from an unsentimental observation of the world, writes Brooke, 'Gleizes has a marked preference for urban and semi-urban scenes with an emphasis on human labour'. Though he often uses bright colors there is little or no interest in either Fauvism or Divisionism, the two schools that now dominate the Parisian [[Avant-garde]].<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n\nIn 1909 Gleizes' evolution towards a more linear proto-Cubist style continues with greater emphasis on clear, simplified, construction; ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]''. At the [[Salon d'Automne]] Gleizes is impressed by the work of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], especially his portrait of the poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]]. Le Fauconnier's portraits and his landscapes painted in Brittany (''[[:fr:Ploumanac'h|Ploumanac'h]]'') show the intention of simplifying form similar to that of Gleizes.

The same tendency is evident in [[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited at the same Salon.

For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and [[Neo-Impressionism]]. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's early work, proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]] perspective, beyond not just the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], but beyond too the preoccupations of his avant-garde entourage.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n<blockquote>\"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature.\" (Metzinger, 1907)</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Gino Severini, 1911, La Danseuse Obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin), oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection.jpg|thumb|[[Gino Severini]], 1911, ''La danseuse obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin)'', oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection]]\nAn interpretation of this statement was made by Robert L. Herbert: \"What Metzinger meant is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement.\" (Herbert, 1968)<ref name=\"Moser\" /><ref name=\"Jean Metzinger\">Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L.

Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" /><ref name=\"Robbins, 1985\">Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J.

Both [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Cubo-Divisionist technique between 1909 and 1911. The [[Futurists]] later (1911–1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works, into their 'dynamic' paintings and sculpture.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n \n\"The Neo-Impressionists\" according to Maurice Denis, \"inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life.\"<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nRobert Herbert writes, of the changes occurring in the early 20th century: \"By about 1904, the resolution of the dilemma was made in favor of the abstract side of the equation. \"Harmony means sacrifice\", Cross said, and much of early Neo-Impressionism was jettisoned. Although they paid lip service to their established theory, Signac and Cross now painted in enormous strokes which could never pretend to mix in the eye, and which did not even retain nuance of tone. Raw, bold yellows, magentas, reds, blues, and greens sprang forth from their canvases, making them as free of the trammels of nature as any painting then being done in Europe.\"<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nWhere the dialectic nature of Cézanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\" />\n\n[[File:Georges Seurat, 1889-90, Le Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georges Seurat]], 1889-90, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', oil on canvas, 171.5 x 140.5 cm (66 7/8 x 54 3/4 in), [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], [[Otterlo]], [[Netherlands]]]]\n\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910-1911,\" Herbert continues, \"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon \"one of the great icons of the new devotion\", and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], \"almost belong to Synthetic Cubism\".<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nThe concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth,' perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\" />\n\nIndeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers''). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics ([[Orphism (art)|Orphism]]) would do so with color too.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\" />\n\nWith the exception of Picasso (his Blue and Pink periods being entirely different intellectually), all the leading Cubists and Futurists came from Neo-Impressionism, believing its objective validity to be a scientific discovery. It was in part this scientific basis that left the avant-garde artists vulnerable to the critique of scientific objectivity, of the type developed first by [[Immanuel Kant]], then [[Ernst Mach]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and of course [[Albert Einstein]]; in relation to, for example, the treatment of time as the fourth dimension.<ref>[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&r/othertxts/miller Peter Brooke, ''Letter to Arthur Miller'', A commentary on Arthur Miller's ''Einstein - Picasso: Space, Time and the beauty that causes havoc'', Basic Books, New York, 2001]</ref>\n\n===African, Egyptian, Greek, Iberian & Oceanic art===\n[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']]\nAnother factor in the shift towards abstraction could be found burgeoning in art circles during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Europeans were discovering [[Prehistoric art]], along with art produced by a variety of cultures: [[African art]], [[Cycladic art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Art of the Americas]], the [[Art of ancient Egypt]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].

They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as proto-Cubism, as ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.<ref name=\"Cooper\" />\n\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 113.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Paul Gauguin]], 1894, ''Mahana no Atua (Day of the Gods, Jour de Dieu)'', oil on canvas, {{convert|66|x|87|cm|in|abbr=on}}, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\nThe African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications and expressive features, is another generally assumed starting point for the Proto-Cubism of Picasso.

[[Pierre Daix]], explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] on the subject of myth. Without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism—coming as it did not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche—clairvoyantly (as Rimbaud would have said) arrived at the suprapersonal and thereby borders on the archaic mythological consciousness.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=W09TW-75Be0C&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22proto-cubism%22&source=bl&ots=0lE4CdAuFA&sig=BS3eQQafhGRg3p46AVQc3YjAMfs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r48qUevONcLRhAfZyYH4Dw&ved=0CHUQ6AEwHQ#v=onepage&q=%22proto-cubism%22&f=false Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zsHayTqUCTsC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=Pierre+Daix,+rimbaud,+picasso,+conscience+mythologie+archaïques&source=bl&ots=2gmkbih4Ru&sig=MgG93AripQUGLBdWvvcYc69dIiI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ldAsUbGDFIeS0QWHq4HYBQ&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Pierre%20Daix%2C%20rimbaud%2C%20picasso%2C%20conscience%20mythologie%20archaïques&f=false Anatoli Podoksik, Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011], {{ISBN|978-1-78042-285-5}} (French)</ref>\n\nEuropean artists (and art collectors) prized these objects for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the [[hieroglyph]], emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.<ref>Solomon-Godeau, Abigail, ''Going Native: Paul Gauguin and the Invention of Primitivist Modernism'', in ''The Expanded Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', N.

Picasso's paintings of monumental figures from 1906 were directly influenced by the paintings, sculptures and writings of Gauguin. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to ''Les Demoiselles'' in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin's work in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio, both a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work, had several of Gauguin's works on hand, in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his [[Work of art|oeuvre]] in Paris.<ref name=\"Sweetman\">David Sweetman, ''Paul Gauguin, A life'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80941-9}}, 562-563</ref>\n\nConcerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote,\n:\"The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.\"<ref>John A. Richardson, ''A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916'', New York: Alfred A.

First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes, \"Gauguin's statue ''Oviri,'' which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''.\"<ref name=\"Sweetman\" />\n\nMany artists associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] transited through a proto-Cubist period, while some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others chose different paths.

His chronophotographic gun (1882) was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, and the most interesting fact is that all the frames were recorded on the same picture. Using these pictures he studied a great variety of animals. Some call it Marey’s \"animated zoo\". Marey also studied human [[animal locomotion|locomotion]]. He published several books including ''Le Mouvement'' in 1894.\n\nHis movies were at a high speed of 60 images per second and of excellent image quality: coming close to perfection in slow-motion cinematography. His research on how to capture and display moving images helped the emerging field of [[cinematography]].\n\nTowards the turn of the century he returned to studying the movement of quite abstract forms, like a falling ball. His last great work, executed just before the outbreak of Fauvism in Paris, was the observation and photography of smoke trails. This research was partially funded by [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] under the auspices of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], after the two met in [[Paris]] at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]].\n\n====Philosophical, scientific and social motivations====\nTo justify such a radical move towards the depiction of the world in unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]].<ref name=\" Antliff, Leighten\">[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames & Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William James]] and the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]]'s [[X-ray]]s, [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertzian]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[radio waves]] propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of [[sensory perception]]. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]].<ref name=\" Antliff, Leighten\" /><ref>Richard Gregory, \"Perception\" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp. 598–601</ref><ref name=\"Henderson\">Linda D. Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art'', Princeton University Press, 1983</ref>\n\nBetween 1881 and 1882 Poincaré wrote a series of works titled ''On curves defined by differential equations'' within which he built a new branch of mathematics called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found (from the very form of the equation). He investigated the nature of trajectories of integral curves in a plane; classifying singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introducing the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.<ref>Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 {{ISBN|978-3764358457}}</ref><ref>Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"The singular points of the integral curves\">\n   File: Phase Portrait Sadle.svg | Saddle\n   File: Phase Portrait Stable Focus.svg | Focus\n   File: Phase portrait center.svg | Center\n   File: Phase Portrait Stable Node.svg | Node\n</gallery>\n\nPoincaré, following [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and others, viewed geometric models as mere conventions rather than as absolute. [[Euclidean geometry]], upon which traditional [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been founded, was but one geometric configuration among others. [[Non-Euclidean geometry]], with its hyperbolic or spherically curved space, was thus, at the very least, an equally valid alternative. This discovery in the world of mathematics overthrew 2000 years of seeming absolutes in Euclidean geometry, and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multi-dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.<ref name=\"Henderson\" />\n\nPictorial space could now be transformed in response to the artists own subjectivity (expressing primal impulses, irrespective of classical perspective and Beaux Arts artistic expectations). \"Adherence to subjectivity in turn\" write Antliff and Leighten, \"signalled a radical break from past pictorial conventions in favour of a Nietzschean expression of individual will\".<ref name=\" Antliff, Leighten\" />\n\nPoincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. \"The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things.

He rejected the division of space into separate measurable units. Both Bergson and [[William James]] described the intellect as an instrumental tool, a by-product of evolution. The intellect was no longer considered a cognitive faculty able to grasp reality in an impartial manner. Instead, argued Bergson, we should rely on intuition to inspired creative insights in both the sciences and the arts. His third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907, constituting one of the most profound and original contributions to the philosophical consideration of evolution. The proto-Cubists would have known of his work through, amongst others, [[Gertrude Stein]] a student of William James. Stein had recently purchased, following the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]] (La femme au chapeau)''<ref>Matisse's ''Woman with a Hat'' is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</ref> and Picasso's ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers''.<ref>Color plates of ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers'', or ''Jeune fille aux fleurs'', appear in Hobhouse, 1975, at 68 and Burns, 1970, at 8.

And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.\n\nMany of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1908, Dryad, oil on canvas, 185 x 108 cm, The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1908, ''Dryad'', oil on canvas, 185 x 108 cm, The State [[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg]]\nGelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':\n\n<blockquote>\"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called \"The Invertebrates.\" In the Salon of 1905 they were named \"The Incoherents.\" But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of \"Les Fauves\"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!\"<br><br>\n\n\"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples.\"<br><br>\n\n\"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the \"Harmony and volume\" and \"architectural values,\" and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!\"<ref name=\"Gelett Burgess\" /></blockquote>\n\nBurgess, turning his attention to Metzinger, writes:\n<blockquote>\"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color.\"<ref>[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Metzinger, in his ''Cubism was Born'', published years later, Cubism had been born out of the \"need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity\"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in [[trompe l'oeil]] on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. \"Quite clearly\" Metzinger notes, \"nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common...\" Already, in 1906, \"it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model\".<ref name=\"Metzinger\">Jean Metzinger, ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger'' (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972.

And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots.

No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.<ref name=\"Metzinger\" /></blockquote>\n\nFor Metzinger, the \"entirely intuitive dissociation\" between color of the Fauves and form of classical painting, exemplified in the works of [[Raoul Dufy]] (who paints first, then draws), \"foreshadowed, more perhaps than Cézanne or black African art, not just Cubism but all the painting that followed afterward\".<ref name=\"Metzinger\" />\n\n<blockquote>I had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)<ref name=\"Metzinger\" /></blockquote>\n\nFrom his [[Montmartre]] studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, \"the attempt [''prétention''] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age.\"<ref name=\"Metzinger\" />\n\n<blockquote>I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible.

Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles or these popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how \"Cubism\" proceeds. Under the title of ''Nu'' [''Nude''], Jean Metzinger shows us \"cubes\" of various tones, but of the same color. The trick is to find the head, the arms at different points on the canvas. It's a distraction like any other, but it is not art.

Nor did the word \"cube\" for Vauxcelles hold any special meaning two and a half years later when he wrote (in November 1908) a brief passage about Braque's landscapes exhibited at the Kahnweiler gallery: \"He scorns forms, reduces all sites and figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes\":<ref name=\"Robbins, 1985\" />\n\n:\"In neither case\" notes Daniel Robbins, \"did the use of the word \"cube\" lead to the immediate identification of the artists with a new pictorial attitude, with a movement. The word was no more than an isolated descriptive epithet that, in both cases, was prompted by a visible passion for structure so assertive that the critics were wrenched, momentarily, from their habitual concentration on motifs and subjects, in which context their comments on drawing, color, tonality, and, only occasionally, conception, resided.\" (Robbins, 1985)<ref name=\"Robbins, 1985\" />\n\nIn light of the headway made by Cézanne, the multiple use of the word \"cube\" with reference to diverse works by diverse artists, and the other factors involved (political, social, cultural), it has been suggested that Cubism, with its proto-phase, would have emerged regardless of Picasso's intervention. The art historian and collector Douglas Cooper viewed Cubist painting to have been the beginning of a stylistic revolution which was inevitable.

Not the simulation of form by chiaroscuro, but the depiction of the three dimensional through drawing on a flat surface...(Kahnweiler, 1920)<ref name=\"Kahnweiler\" /></blockquote>\n\nKahnweiler's conclusion, similar to those leveled against Cézanne, was that Picasso's painting 'never constitutes a unified whole' and was thus unsuccessful. \"After months of the most laborious searching, notes Kahnweiler, \"Picasso realized that the complete solution of the problem did not lie in this direction\".<ref name=\"Cottington\" /> In July 1916, ''Les Demoiselles'' was exhibited to the public for the first time, and not in the gallery of Kahnweiler. It was included in the [[Salon d'Antin]], an exhibition organized by [[André Salmon]].<ref>Billy Klüver, ''A Day with Picasso'', The MIT Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-262-61147-3}}</ref>\n\nBypassing the problem of color, simply by eliminating color from his paintings, Picasso in 1908 concentrated on form. Kahnweiler notes:\n\n:\"Thus Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures, and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne. Light is never more than a means to create form — through chiaroscuro, since he did not at this time repeat the unsuccessful attempt of 1907 to create form through drawing.\"<ref name=\"Kahnweiler\" />\n\n[[File:Landscape in Provence (Paysage de Provence) - André Derain.jpg|thumb|220px|[[André Derain]], ca.1908, ''Landscape in Provence (Paysage de Provence)'', oil on canvas, 32.2 x 40.6&nbsp;cm, [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York]]\n\"Derain, too, had abandoned decorative light painting in 1907\", Kahnweiler writes, \"preceding Braque by a few months. But from the outset, their roads were diverse. Derain's endeavor to retain fidelity to nature in his painting separates him forever from Cubism, no matter how closely his ideas may otherwise parallel those of Braque.\"<ref name=\"Kahnweiler\" />\n\n[[File:Othon Friesz, 1907-08, Le Travail à l'Automne, oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Othon Friesz]], 1907-08, ''Le Travail à l'Automne'', oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]], Oslo]]\nAnd Derain was not the only one to venture along the path of Cézanne, only to turn away from it in the coming years. Chagall, Friesz, Matisse, Dufy, Redon, Vlaminck and Modigliani are prime examples.\n\nBut too, just as Picasso and Braque, other artists independently and simultaneously explored the Cézannian approach, and did continue on to become Cubists, each with his or her own particular style.\n\n==The sequence of events==\nThe Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was practically over by the spring of the 1907 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. And by the [[Salon d'Automne]] in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. For Metzinger and Delaunay, too, representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].\n\n===1907===\n* The 1907 Salon d'Automne impels Apollinaire to refer to Matisse as the \"fauve of fauves\". Works by both Derain and Matisse are criticized for the ugliness of their models. Braque and Le Fauconnier are considered as Fauves by the critic Michel Puy (brother of [[Jean Puy]]).<ref name=\"Russell T.

Apollinaire writes of the paintings exhibited nothing about cubes, but mentions \"the synthetic motifs he paints\" and that he \"no longer owes anything to his surroundings\".

Though others were already working in a proto-cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger's ''Nude'' represented a radical departure further still.\n\n<blockquote>I have in front of me a small cutting from an evening newspaper, ''The Press'', on the subject of the 1910 Salon d'Automne. It gives a good idea of the situation in which the new pictorial tendency, still barely perceptible, found itself: ''The geometrical fallacies of Messrs. Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, and Gleizes''. No sign of any compromise there. Braque and Picasso only showed in Kahnweiler's gallery and we were unaware of them. Robert Delaunay, Metzinger and Le Fauconnier had been noticed at the Salon des Indépendants of that same year, 1910, without a label being fixed on them. Consequently, although much effort has been put into proving the opposite, the word ''Cubism'' was not at that time current.

A group forms that includes Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay (a friend and associate of Metzinger), and Fernand Léger. They meet regularly at Henri Le Fauconnier's studio near the Bld de Montparnasse, where he is working on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled ''L'Abondance''. \"In this painting\" writes Brooke, \"the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements\".<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n\nThis exhibition preceded the 1911 Salon des Indépendants which officially introduced \"Cubism\" to the public as an organized group movement. Metzinger had been close to Picasso and Braque, working at this time along similar lines.<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" />\n\nMetzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited coincidentally in Room VIII. This was the moment in which the Montparnasse group quickly grew to include [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]].

In doing so he enunciated for the first time, not the term \"Cubism\", but what would become known as the characteristics of [[Cubism]]: notably the notions of [[simultaneity]] and mobile perspective. In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective.

These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record, May 1910.<ref name=\"Gelett Burgess\" />\n* According to Gleizes' memoirs, Mercereau introduces him to Metzinger but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n* Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as \"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\"<ref name=\"Robbins, 1985\" /><ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" />\n\nThe work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref name=\"Kubisme\" />\n\n==Cubism==\n{{Main article|Cubism}}\n\"The question of when Cubism began and who led the way in its development\", writes art historian Christopher Green, \"is inextricably tied up with the question of what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist\".<ref name=\"Christopher Green\" /> Picasso's landscapes painted at ''Horta de Hebro'' in 1909 (executed two years after ''Les Demoiselles'' and one year after the \"cubes\" of Braque's L'Estaque paintings) were considered the first Cubist painting by Gertrude Stein. It is generally recognized, however, that the first Cubist exhibition transpired in 1911. Jean Metzinger, judging from the Burgess interview, appears to have abandoned his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style in favor of the ''faceting of form'' associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909.<ref name=\"Moser\" /> Metzinger frequented the [[Bateau Lavoir]] at this time and exhibited with Braque at the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of Picasso (''Girl with a Mandolin, Fanny Tellier'', 1910), Braque (''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910) and Metzinger (''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.<ref name=\"Moser\" /><ref name=\"Robbins, 1985\" />\n\nIn his article entitled ''Note sur la peinture'',<ref name=\"Metzinger, 1910\" /> published the same year, Metzinger acknowledges the birth of a new kind of painting; one that employed a mobile perspective. In that seminal text, Metzinger identifies similarities in the works of [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], on the one hand, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] on the other. Of this group of five, only Metzinger and Braque were familiar with the works of Picasso, and Metzinger alone, familiar with the works of everyone in the group. It is now universally believed that Metzinger was the first to recognize explicitly and implicitly the significance of the use of \"a free, mobile perspective\", and the \"mixing... of the successive and the simultaneous\".<ref name=\"Metzinger, 1910\" /> He was the first to write of the fact that artists had abandoned traditional perspective and were now free to move around their subjects to paint them from various points in space, and at various moments in time.<ref name=\"Robbins, 1985\" /><ref name=\"Metzinger, 1910\" /> Metzinger's role at center of Cubism both as a painter and theorist prompted Guillaume Apollinaire to write of Picasso, Braque and Metzinger as the first three Cubist painters.<ref name=\"Apollinaire\" />\n\nNow well beyond the teachings of Cézanne, the newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasize a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the [[Salon des Indépendants]] ensuring that the works of a small group of artists would be shown together: Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown in Room 41.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /><ref name=\"Apollinaire\" />\n\n===1911 Salon des Indépendants===\n{{main article|Salon des Indépendants}}\nThe first group exhibition of Cubism transpired at the 1911 Indépendants.<ref name=\"Apollinaire\" /> The result of the group show is a major scandal. Both the public and the press are outraged by the obscurity of the subject matter, represented as cones, cubes and spheres. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although similar terms (i.e., \"cubes\") have been used before in relation to the works of Cross (1901), Metzinger and Delaunay (1906, 1907) and Braque (1908), the term \"Cubism\" emerges for the first time at the inauguration of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants; imposed by 'scandal-mongering journalists who wished to create sensational news' (to use the words of Gleizes). The term was used derogatorily to describe the diverse geometric concerns reflected in the paintings of five artists in continual communication with one another: Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from this massive exhibition).<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" /><ref>Albert Gleizes ''Souvenirs, le cubisme 1908-14'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes 1 (Lyon, 1957), p. 14</ref>\n\n[[Guillaume Apollinaire]], deeming it necessary to deflect the endless attacks throughout the press, accepts the term ''\"Cubism\"'' (the \"ism\" signifying a tendency of behavior, action or opinion belonging to a class or group of persons (an [[art movement]]); the result of an [[ideology]] or [[principle]]).<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /><ref name=\"Apollinaire\" />\n\nThe term \"Cubisme\" is employed for the first time outside France in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Archipenko, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Segonzac, Le Fauconnier and Jean Marchand. But Jean Metzinger, who had been termed \"the Emperor of Cubism\" during the spring in Paris, was not among the artist exhibiting works in Brussels.<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" /> Apollinaire’s impulse was to define ''L'Esprit nouveau'' observed in a range of paintings, from proto-Cubist quasi-Fauve landscapes to the semi-abstract geometric compositions of artists such as Metzinger, Delaunay, Gleizes and a growing group of followers. In his chapter on Picasso, however, there is no mention of the term Cubism.<ref name=\"Apollinaire\" />\n\nBefore the Indépendance, the Cubists infiltrated the placement committee to make sure they would all be shown as a group. Le Fauconnier, the secretary of the salon, facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works had been placed according to alphabetical order of the artists names. In Room 41 hung works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].<ref name=\"Kubisme\" />\n\nIn room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in ''Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre'', and ''Cri de Paris''. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of ''L'Intransigeant''.<ref name=\"Kubisme\" />\n\nHenri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]).

The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]).

[...]<br><br>\n\nNever had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings - and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself - appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.<br><br>\n\nIn nearly all the papers, all composure was lost. The critics would begin by saying: ''there is no need to devote much space to the Cubists, who are utterly without importance'' and then they furiously gave them seven columns out of the ten that were taken up, at that time, by the Salon. (Gleizes, 1925)<ref name=\"Gleizes\" /></blockquote>\n\nReviewing the Salon d'Automne of 1911, Huntly Carter in ''The New Age'' writes that \"art is not an accessory to life; it is life itself carried to the greatest heights of personal expression.\" Carter continues:\n\n<blockquote>It was at the Salon d'Automne, amid the Rhythmists [Cubists], I found the desired sensation. The exuberant eagerness and vitality of their region, consisting of two room remotely situated, was a complete contrast to the morgue I was compelled to pass through in order to reach it. Though marked by extremes, it was clearly the starting point of a new movement in painting, perhaps the most remarkable in modern times, It revealed not only that artists are beginning to recognise the unity of art and life, but that some of them have discovered life is based on rhythmic vitality, and underlying all things is the perfect rhythm that continues and unites them. Consciously, or unconsciously, many are seeking for the perfect rhyth, and in so doing are attaining a liberty or wideness of expression unattained through several centuries of painting.

Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with Cézanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat.

As with [[pixel]]s in a [[bitmap]], voxels themselves do not typically have their position (their [[coordinate]]s) explicitly encoded along with their values. Instead, rendering systems infer the position of a voxel based upon its position relative to other voxels (i.e., its position in the data structure that makes up a single volumetric image). In contrast to pixels and voxels, [[Point (geometry)|points]] and [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] are often explicitly represented by the [[coordinates]] of their vertices. A direct consequence of this difference is that polygons can efficiently represent simple 3D structures with lots of empty or homogeneously filled space, while voxels excel at representing regularly sampled spaces that are non-homogeneously filled.\n\nVoxels are frequently used in the visualization and analysis of [[medical imaging|medical]] and [[science|scientific]] data (eg.

A typical implementation will [[Ray tracing (graphics)|raytrace]] each pixel of the display starting at the bottom of the screen using what is known as a y-buffer. When a voxel is reached that has a higher y value on the display it is added to the y-buffer overriding the previous value and connected with the previous y-value on the screen interpolating the color values. There is a major downside to voxel rasterization when transformation is applied which causes severe [[aliasing]]. The advantage was the ability to rasterise using cheap integer calculations on a [[CPU]] without [[hardware acceleration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnlc.com/eep/voxels.html|title=Voxels|work=tnlc.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417001519/http://www.tnlc.com/eep/voxels.html|archivedate=2014-04-17|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[Outcast (video game)|Outcast]], and other 1990s video games employed this graphics technique for effects such as reflection and bump-mapping and usually for [[terrain rendering]].

A voxel represents only a single point on this grid, not a volume; the space between each voxel is not represented in a voxel-based dataset. Depending on the type of data and the intended use for the dataset, this missing information may be reconstructed and/or approximated, e.g. via interpolation.\n\nThe value of a voxel may represent various properties.

However, through efficient compression and manipulation of large data files, interactive visualization can be enabled on consumer market computers.\n\nOther values may be useful for immediate 3D [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], such as a surface [[surface normal|normal vector]] and [[color]].\n\n== Uses ==\nCommon uses of voxels include volumetric imaging in medicine and representation of terrain in games and simulations. Voxel terrain is used instead of a [[heightmap]] because of its ability to represent overhangs, caves, arches, and other 3D terrain features. These concave features cannot be represented in a heightmap due to only the top 'layer' of data being represented, leaving everything below it filled (the volume that would otherwise be the inside of the caves, or the underside of arches or overhangs).\n\n=== Computer games ===\n* ''[[3D Dot Game Heroes]]'' uses voxels to present retro-looking graphics.\n* ''[[7 Days to Die]]'' is a voxel based open world survival horror game developed by [[www.thefunpimps.com|The Fun Pimps Entertainment]].\n* ''[[Ace of Spades (video game)|Ace of Spades]]'' used [[Ken Silverman]]'s Voxlap engine before being rewritten in a bespoke [[OpenGL]] engine.\n* ''[[Amok (video game)|Amok]]'' uses voxels for its environments.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Review Crew: Amok|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=93|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=April 1997|page=53}}</ref>\n* ''[[Armored Fist 3]]'' is a computer game made by [[Novalogic]] that used voxel-based rendering technology.\n* ''[[Blade Runner (1997 video game)#Development|Blade Runner]]'' is a video game that used voxels to render characters and artifacts.\n* ''[[Block Ops]]'', a voxel based [[First Person Shooter]] game.\n* ''Boundless''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oortonline.com/|title=Boundless – Explore, Collaborate, Build, Conquer, Discover.|work=oortonline.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812224258/http://oortonline.com/|archivedate=2014-08-12|df=}}</ref> is a voxel-based multi-player sandbox game with building elements in connected voxel-worlds that is being developed and published by [[Wonderstruck Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wonderstruckgames.com/|title=wonderstruck|work=wonderstruckgames.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204937/http://wonderstruckgames.com/|archivedate=2014-08-12|df=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Castle Story]]'', a castle building Real Time Strategy game in development, has terrain consisting of smoothed voxels\n* ''[[Comanche (video game series)|Comanche series]]'', a series of computer games made by [[NovaLogic]] that used the [[Voxel Space]] voxel rasterization for terrain rendering.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://projectorgames.net/blog/?p=168 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218235557/http://projectorgames.net/blog/?p=168 |archivedate=2013-12-18 |df= }}</ref>\n* ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'', ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'' and ''[[Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge]]'' are computer games made by [[Westwood Studios]] that used voxels to render most vehicles.\n* ''[[Crysis]]'', as well as ''[[Cryengine 2]]'' and ''[[Cryengine 3]]'', use a combination of [[heightmaps]] and voxels for their terrain systems.\n* ''[[Cube World]]'', an [[Indie game|Indie]] voxel based game with [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] elements.\n* ''[[Cubiverse]]'' a webGL sandbox game crafter, uses voxels for the terrain.\n* ''[[Delta Force (video game)|Delta Force]]'' is a computer game made by [[Novalogic]] that used the in-house [[Voxel Space]] rendering engine.\n* ''[[Dual Universe]]'' is a single-shard universe MMORPG game that uses voxels to build spaceships, civilizations, and space stations.\n* ''[[EverQuest Next]]'' and ''EverQuest Next: Landmark'', upcoming MMORPGs by [[Sony Online Entertainment]], make extensive use of voxels for world creation as well as player generated content\n* ''[[From the Depths (video game)|From the Depths]]'', a voxel-based vehicle building game.

Some common approaches are:\n* Slice based: The volume is sliced in one or more axes and the user can edit each image individually using [[Raster graphics editor|2D raster editor]] tools. These generally store color information in voxels.\n* Sculpture: Similar to the [[Digital sculpting|vector counterpart]] but with no topology constraints. These usually store density information in voxels and lack color information.\n* Building blocks: The user can add and remove blocks just like a [[construction set]] toy.\n\n=== Voxel editors for games ===\nMany game developers use in-house editors that are not released to the public, but a few games have publicly available editors, some of them created by players.\n* Slice based fan-made Voxel Section Editor III for ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' and ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ppmsite.com/?go=vxlseinfo |title=Project Perfect Mod |publisher=Ppmsite.com |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719164029/http://www.ppmsite.com/?go=vxlseinfo |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }}</ref>\n* SLAB6 and VoxEd are sculpture based voxel editors used by [[Voxlap]] engine games,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm#slab6 |title=Ken Silverman's Projects Page |publisher=Advsys.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416015511/http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm#slab6 |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm |title=Ken Silverman's Voxlap Page |publisher=Advsys.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527154420/http://advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }}</ref> including ''Voxelstein 3D'' and ''[[Ace of Spades (video game)|Ace of Spades]]''.\n* The official Sandbox 2 editor for [[CryEngine 2]] games (including ''[[Crysis]]'') has support for sculpting voxel based terrain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://konakona.nbtxathcx.net/sb2/index.php?page=voxels |title=CryEngine2 Sandbox2 Tutorial |publisher=Konakona.nbtxathcx.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303004723/http://konakona.nbtxathcx.net/sb2/index.php?page=voxels |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}</ref>\n* The [[C4 Engine]] and editor support multiple detail level (LOD) voxel terrain by implementing the patent-free [[Transvoxel algorithm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terathon.com/features.php |title=C4 Engine Features |publisher=Terathon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509104308/http://www.terathon.com/features.php |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://transvoxel.org/ |title=The Transvoxel Algorithm for Voxel Terrain |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070754/http://transvoxel.org/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}</ref>\n* [[Qubicle]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minddesk.com/ |title=Qubicle's Main Page |publisher=minddesk.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517142658/http://minddesk.com/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}</ref> is a simple, professional voxel editor.

They can be used as alternatives or complements to traditional 3D vector modeling.\n\n== Extensions ==\nA generalization of a voxel is the ''[[doxel]]'', or dynamic voxel. This is used in the case of a [[Four-dimensional space|4D]] dataset, for example, an image sequence that represents 3D space together with another dimension such as time. In this way, an image could contain 100×100×100×100 doxels, which could be seen as a series of 100 [[Film frame|frames]] of a 100×100×100 volume image (the equivalent for a 3D image would be showing a 2D cross section of the image in each frame). Although storage and manipulation of such data requires large amounts of memory, it allows the representation and analysis of [[spacetime]] systems.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pixel]] – picture element\n* [[Resel]] – resolution element\n* [[Sparse voxel octree]]\n* [[Texel (graphics)|Texel]] – texture element\n* [[Maxel]] – material element\n* [[Tixel]] - tactile element\n* [[Volume rendering]]\n* [[Volume mesh]]\n* [[Tomography]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{moby game|id=-group/visual-technique-style-voxel-graphics|name=''Games with voxel graphics''}}\n* [http://labs.cs.sunysb.edu/labs/projects/volume/Papers/Voxel/ Fundamentals of voxelization]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n[[Category:3D imaging]]\n[[Category:Video games with voxel graphics| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cubes]]"

Construction began with driving the first steel foundation piles on Aug. 2, 1963. It was part of NASA's massive effort to send astronauts to the Moon for the Apollo Program. Altogether, 4,225 pilings were driven down 164 feet to bedrock with a foundation consisting of 30,000 cubic yards of concrete. Construction of the VAB required 98,590 tons of steel.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/content/vehicle-assembly-building-prepared-for-another-50-years-of-service</ref> The building was completed in 1966.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/718659main_VAB.pdf</ref> The VAB is {{convert|526|ft|m|1|}} tall, {{convert|716|ft|m|1}} long and {{convert|518|ft|m|1}} wide.

Some of these panels are \"punch-outs\", designed to detach from the VAB when a large pressure differential is created on the outside vs. the inside. This allows for equalization, and helps protect the structural integrity of the building during rapid changes in pressure such as in tropical cyclones.\n\nThe building has been used as a backdrop in several Hollywood movies including ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', ''[[SpaceCamp]]'', ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', and others.\n\n==Future==\n[[File:Space Shuttle Discovery in NASA's VAB.JPG|right|thumbnail|''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]''  in the Vehicle Assembly Building waiting for a ferry flight to Dulles, Virginia for permanent display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. ]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 after which NASA temporarily (as early as 2012) offered public tours of the VAB.

NASA began modifying Launch Complex 39 at KSC to support the new SLS in 2014, beginning with major repairs, code upgrades and safety improvements to the Launch Control Center, Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and the VAB Utility Annex. This initial work will be required to support any launch vehicle operated from Launch Complex 39 and will allow NASA to begin modernizing the facilities, while vehicle-specific requirements are being developed.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/632670main_NASA_FY13_Budget_CECR-508.pdf NASA FY13 Budget]</ref>\n\nThe VAB could be used to some extent for assembly and processing of any future vehicles utilizing Launch Complex 39, in addition to renovations for SLS capabilities. On June 16, 2015, NASA released an announcement for proposals (AFP) seeking interest in using the VAB High Bay 2 and other complex facilities for commercial use in \"assembling, integration, and testing of launch vehicles.\" This move is in line with the intent to migrate KSC towards acting as a spaceport accessible to both government and commercial ventures.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasa-solicits-proposals-for-use-of-kennedy-space-centers-vehicle-assembly-building-high-bay-2-300099470.html NASA Solicits Proposals for Use of Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building High Bay 2]</ref> On April 21, 2016, NASA announced the selection of [[Orbital ATK]] to begin negotiations for High Bay 2.

One is that the shrine was a place of worship for Angels before the creation of man. Later, a house of worship was built on the location by [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] which was lost during the flood in [[Noah]]'s time and was finally rebuilt by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] that although several other temples might have preceded the ''Kaaba'', it was the first \"House of God\", dedicated solely to Him, built by His instruction and sanctified and blessed by Him as stated in Quran 22:26–29.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir on 3:96|url=http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=7&tSoraNo=3&tAyahNo=96&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1}}</ref> A [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that the ''Kaaba'' was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the [[temple of solomon|Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari|location=Book 55, Hadith 585|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=55&translator=1&start=0&number=585#585}}</ref>\n\nWhile Abraham was building the ''Kaaba'', an angel brought to him the [[Black Stone]] which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure. Another stone was the Maqam-e-Ibrahim (literally the Station of Abraham) where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure. The Black Stone and the Maqam-e-Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as naturally the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for maintenance purposes. After the construction was complete, God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage: the [[Hajj]] and the [[Korban]], sacrifice of cattle.

This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe [[Quraysh]]. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand.

Swiss traveller [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] visited Mecca in 1814, and provided a detailed description in his 1829 book ''Travels in Arabia'':\n\n{{quote|text=It is an irregular oval, about seven inches [18&nbsp;cm] in diameter, with an undulated surface, composed of about a dozen smaller stones of different sizes and shapes, well joined together with a small quantity of cement, and perfectly well smoothed; it looks as if the whole had been broken into as many pieces by a violent blow, and then united again. It is very difficult to determine accurately the quality of this stone which has been worn to its present surface by the millions of touches and kisses it has received. It appeared to me like a lava, containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellow substance. Its colour is now a deep reddish brown approaching to black. It is surrounded on all sides by a border composed of a substance which I took to be a close cement of pitch and gravel of a similar, but not quite the same, brownish colour. This border serves to support its detached pieces; it is two or three inches in breadth, and rises a little above the surface of the stone. Both the border and the stone itself are encircled by a silver band, broader below than above, and on the two sides, with a considerable swelling below, as if a part of the stone were hidden under it. The lower part of the border is studded with silver nails.<ref name=\"Burckhardt1829\">{{cite book|last=Burckhardt|first=Johann Ludwig|title=Travels in Arabia, Comprehending an Account of Those Territories in Hedjaz which the Mohammedans Regard as Sacred|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA250|year=1829|publisher=Henry Colburn, New Burlington Street|page=250}}</ref>}}\n\nVisiting the Kaaba in 1853, [[Richard Francis Burton]] also noted that:\n\n{{quote|text=The colour appeared to me black and metallic, and the centre of the stone was sunk about two inches below the metallic circle. Round the sides was a reddish-brown cement, almost level with the metal, and sloping down to the middle of the stone. The band is now a massive arch of gold or silver gilt.

That person was 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his prophethood. He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot.

According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader [[Abu Tahir al-Jannabi]] set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the ''Masjid al-Dirar'', with the intention of redirecting the ''hajj'' away from Mecca.

It is scarcely necessary to say that a Shi’a, as well as a Sunni, would look upon such an action with lively horror. The people of Meccah, however, like the Madani, have turned the circumstance to their own advantage, and make an occasional “avanie”. Thus, nine or ten years ago, on the testimony of a boy who swore that he saw the inside of the Kaaba defiled by a Persian, they rose up, cruelly beat the schismatics, and carried them off to their peculiar quarter the Shamiyah, forbidding their ingress to the Kaaba. Indeed, till Mohammed Ali’s time, the Persians rarely ventured upon a pilgrimage, and even now that man is happy who gets over it without a beating. The defilement of the Black Stone was probably the work of some Jew or Greek, who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry.“ Note: Burton pointed out to the suspect as a “Jew or Greek”.

They resolved not to taint the project with resources gained through usury (interest) and from non-halal source. They came to know of a Roman ship that had become wrecked at a nearby port and a contingent went to purchase the wood of the ship. They also contracted a carpenter, named Baqoom, who had been one of the passengers on the ship to come and reconstruct the walls. The construction started with each tribe being allocated specific duties. The nobles among them carried pieces of stone and piled them up in one place. The Prophet and his uncle Abbas were among those carrying stones. However, the tribes were unable to collect enough money to rebuild the Ka’bah completely so a small wall was built showing the boundaries of the original foundation laid by Ebrahim. This small wall enclosed an area on the northern side of the Ka’bah.\n* Some scholars have mentioned that the graves of Ismail and his mother Hajra lie buried beneath the Hijr Ismail. However, others have dismissed the narrations as being Da’eef (weak).\nAisha reports that when she asked the Prophet whether the Hateem was part of the Ka’bah, he replied that it was. When she further asked why it was then not included in the walls of the Ka’bah, the Prophet replied, “Because your people (the Quraysh) did not have sufficient funds.” [Bukhari]\nAisha says, “When I expressed the wish to perform salah within the Ka’bah, the Prophet took me by the hand and led me into the Hijr (Hateem) where he said, ‘Perform salah here if you wish to enter the Ka’bah because this is part of the Baytullah.’”\n* It must be noted here that an area of approximately 3 meters adjacent to the wall on the side of the Hateem actually constitutes as being part of the Ka’bah, the rest falls outside the Ka’bah. It is however clear that Tawaf must be performed outside the complete area of the Hateem.\n* Another narration states that Rasulullah said, “O Aisha! Had your people not very recently been in the Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka’bah demolished and included the left-out portion within its walls. I would have also brought the inside of the Ka’bah to ground level and added two doors, with one on the eastern wall and the other on the western wall. In this manner, it would be according to the building and foundation of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]].” In the year 65 AH, Abdullah bin Zubair had the Ka’bah constructed according to this wish of the Prophet.\n* There is a water outlet that channels water from the roof of the Ka’bah down to the Hateem area. This was first constructed by the Quraysh and is known as the ‘Meezab-e-Rahmah’ (the water outlet of mercy).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Susu IgG-Plus di Sepanjang Jalan Dari Pendang|url = http://zulsalleh.blogspot.com/2012/10/door-of-kabah-this-is-entrance-of-kabah.html?m=1|accessdate = 2015-12-07|first = Zul|last = Salleh}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Islam}}\n* [[Ka'aba]]\n* [[Ishmael|Ismail]]\n* [[Hagar]]\n* [[Pilgrims]]\n* [[Masjid al-Haram]]\n* [[Tawaf]]\n* [[Abdul Muttalib]]\n* [[Kaaba]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://craftsman-saqib.blogspot.com/2010/12/normal-0-microsoftinternetexplorer4_21.html Holy Kaaba, Hateem, and Hajr-e-Ismail | Saqib Bashir]\n* [http://ahhrclub.blogspot.com/2013/05/facts-about-khana-kaaba-makkah.html AhhrClub: Facts about Khana Kaaba, Makkah]\n* [http://hateem-amazing.blogspot.com/p/xxx.html Amazing: THE OLDEST PLACE (KAABA)]\n* [http://islamandmuslimunity.blogspot.com/2012/11/holy-kaaba_19.html ISLAM: Holy Kaaba]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Kaaba]]\n[[Category:Hajj terminology]]\n[[Category:Great Mosque of Mecca]]"

It is draped annually on the 9th day of the month of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], the day pilgrims leave for the plains of [[Mount Arafat]] during the [[Hajj]].<ref name=\"Qiswa\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aulia-e-hind.com/Qiswa.htm|title=Qiswa, Kiswah & Kaaba|website=www.aulia-e-hind.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> The term ''kiswah'' is Arabic for '[[wikt:pall|pall]]', the cloth draped over a casket.\n\n==Current==\nEvery year, the old Kiswa is removed, cut into small pieces, and given to certain individuals, visiting foreign [[Muslim]] dignitaries and organizations. Some of them sell their share as souvenirs of the [[Hajj]]. In earlier times, [[Umar|Umar bin al-Khattab]] would cut it into pieces and distribute them among pilgrims who used them as shelter from the heat of [[Mecca]]. \n\nThe present cost of making the kiswa amounts to [[Saudi riyal|SAR]] 17,000,000 (~4,532,951.01 USD). The cover is 658m<sup>2</sup> and is made of 670&nbsp;kg of [[silk]]. The embroidery contains 15&nbsp;kg of [[gold]] threads. It consists of 47 pieces of cloth and each piece is 14m long and 101&nbsp;cm wide. The kiswa is wrapped around the Kaaba and fixed to its base with [[copper]] rings. The manually designed embroidery of the [[Quran]]ic verses are slowly being aided by computers, thus increasing the speed of production.<ref>[http://www.islamicvoice.com/february.2000/child.htm Islamic Voice] article ''Kiswa: Dressing up God's Abode'' Vol 14-02 No:158    *   FEBRUARY 2000 / Shawwal 1420H</ref>\n\n==History==\nKing [[Tubba Abu Karab As'ad]] of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] clothed Kaaba for the first time, during the rule of the [[Jurhum|Jurhum tribe]] of Mecca.<ref name=\"Qiswa\" />\n\n===The Kiswah in the reign of Muhammad===\n[[Muhammad]] and the Muslims in Mecca did not participate in the draping of the [[Kaaba]] until the conquest of the city at 630 AD (7 AH), as the ruling tribe, [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]], did not allow them to do so. When Mecca was taken by the Muslims, they decided to leave the Kiswah as it was until a woman lighting incense in the Kaaba accidentally set fire to the Kiswah. Muhammad then draped it with a white Yemeni cloth.<ref name=\"Qiswa\"/>\n\n===Under the Caliphs===\nMany notable [[Caliphs]] have had their share of ruling over the Kiswah. [[Muawiyah I]] used to drape the Kaaba twice a year, along with the help of [[Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], and [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]]. They brought the traditional [[silk]] covering into effect. \n\n[[Al-Nasir]], the [[Abbasid]] Caliph, established the current practise of dressing the Kaaba with only one Kiswah at a time, superseding the former custom of allowing old Kiswah to accumulate one over the other. When Al-Nasir performed [[Hajj]] in 160 AH, he saw that the accumulated Kiswah could cause damage to the Kaaba itself, and therefore decreed that only one Kiswah should drape the Kaaba at any one time. \n\nThe Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]], draped the Kaaba three times a year, each time with a different colour: red on the eighth of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], white ''gabati'' on the first of [[Rajab]], and another red [[brocade]] on the twenty-ninth of [[Ramadan]]. Later on, Al-Nasir draped the Kaaba with green; both he and Al-Ma'mun disagreed on the frequent colour changes and switched to black, the only colour that has since been used for Kiswah. Black Kiswah supported by Tradition of Prophet to Mourning, some associated it with [[Battle of Karbala]] however saying of Prophet to wrap Kaaba with black cloth after 100 Years or before when events of Sorrow took start.\n\n=== Location of manufacture===\nFrom the time of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]s, precisely during the reign of [[as-Salih Ayyub]], the Kiswah was manufactured in Egypt, with material sourced locally as well as from Sudan, India, and Iraq.<ref name=\"Aramco\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198505/a.gift.from.the.kingdom.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World : A Gift from the Kingdom|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saudiaramcoworld.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> The [[Amir al-Hajj]] (commander of the ''hajj'' caravan), who was directly designated by the sultans of the Mamluk, and later, Ottoman Empires, transported the Kiswah from Egypt to Mecca on an annual basis.<ref>{{Citation|first=Robert|last=Dunn|title=The Adventures of Ibn Battuta, a Muslim Traveler of the Fourteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC&pg=PA66&dq=Amir+al+hajj&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3ruVVZSAN4mnNp_UgpAE&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Amir%20hajj&f=false|publisher=University of California Press|year=1986|isbn=9780520057715|page=266}}</ref> The tradition continued until 1927, when its manufacture was moved to Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"Aramco\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.islamonline.net/English/hajj/2002/01/literature/article07.shtml A historical look at the Kiswah]\n*[http://www.aulia-e-hind.com/Qiswa.htm Qiswa]\n\n{{coord missing|Saudi Arabia}}\n{{Islamic architecture}}\n[[Category:Kaaba]]\n[[Category:Islamic architectural elements]]\n[[Category:Textiles]]\n[[Category:Hajj terminology]]"
