Thus its sides coincide with one side and the adjacent shorter and longer [[diagonal#Polygons|diagonals]] of the regular heptagon. All heptagonal triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] (have the same shape), and so they are collectively known as ''the'' heptagonal triangle. Its angles have measures <math>\\pi/7, 2\\pi/7,</math> and <math>4\\pi/7,</math> and it is the only triangle with angles in the ratios 1:2:4.

The Greek term was adopted into  [[Sanskrit]] as ''[[jyā]]''  \"bow-string\", later also in the variant ''[[jīvā]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\nSanskrit ''jīvā''  was rendered adopted into Arabic as ''jiba'', written ''jb'' جب.<ref name=\"Boyer91-jiba\">Boyer (1991), page 252: ''It was Robert of Chester's translation from the Arabic that resulted in our word \"sine\".

The Greeks, and after them the Hindus and the Arabs, used trigonometric ''lines''. These at first took the form, as we have seen, of chords in a circle, and it became incumbent upon Ptolemy to associate numerical values (or approximations) with the chords. [...] It is not unlikely that the 260-degree measure was carried over from astronomy, where the zodiac had been divided into twelve \"signs\" or 36 \"decans\". A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts. Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence. Moreover since the Babylonian position system for fractions was so obviously superior to the Egyptians unit fractions and the Greek common fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into sixty ''[[partes minutae primae]]'', each of these latter into sixty ''[[partes minutae secundae]]'', and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that translators used in this connection that our words \"minute\" and \"second\" have been derived. It undoubtedly was the sexagesimal system that led Ptolemy to subdivide the diameter of his trigonometric circle into 120 parts; each of these he further subdivided into sixty minutes and each minute of length sixty seconds.}}</ref> These roughly translate to \"first small parts\" and \"second small parts\".\n\n==Development==\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe ancient [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]]s and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]]s had known of theorems on the ratios of the sides of similar triangles for many centuries. However, as pre-Hellenic societies lacked the concept of an angle measure, they were limited to studying the sides of triangles instead.<ref name=\"Boyer Early Trigonometry\">{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |pages=158–159 |quote=Trigonometry, like other branches of mathematics, was not the work of any one man, or nation. Theorems on ratios of the sides of similar triangles had been known to, and used by, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. In view of the pre-Hellenic lack of the concept of angle measure, such a study might better be called \"trilaterometry\", or the measure of three sided polygons (trilaterals), than \"trigonometry\", the measure of parts of a triangle. With the Greeks we first find a systematic study of relationships between angles (or arcs) in a circle and the lengths of chords subtending these. Properties of chords, as measures of central and inscribed angles in circles, were familiar to the Greeks of Hippocrates' day, and it is likely that Eudoxus had used ratios and angle measures in determining the size of the earth and the relative distances of the sun and the moon. In the works of Euclid there is no trigonometry in the strict sense of the word, but there are theorems equivalent to specific trigonometric laws or formulas. Propositions II.12 and 13 of the ''Elements'', for example, are the laws of cosines for obtuse and acute angles respectively, stated in geometric rather than trigonometric language and proved by a method similar to that used by Euclid in connection with the Pythagorean theorem. Theorems on the lengths of chords are essentially applications of the modern law of sines. We have seen that Archimedes' theorem on the broken chord can readily be translated into trigonometric language analogous to formulas for sines of sums and differences of angles.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Babylonian astronomer]]s kept detailed records on the rising and setting of [[star]]s, the motion of the [[planet]]s, and the solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, all of which required familiarity with [[Angle|angular]] distances measured on the [[celestial sphere]].<ref name=\"Maor-20\">{{Cite book |title=Trigonometric Delights |first=Eli |last=Maor |year=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09541-7 |page=20}}</ref> Based on one interpretation of the [[Plimpton 322]] [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet (c. 1900 BC), some have even asserted that the ancient Babylonians had a table of secants.<ref>Joseph [[#joseph-2000b|(2000b, pp.383&ndash;84)]].</ref> There is, however, much debate as to whether it is a table of [[Pythagorean triple]]s, a solution of quadratic equations, or a [[Generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric table]].\n\nThe Egyptians, on the other hand, used a primitive form of trigonometry for building [[pyramid]]s in the 2nd millennium BC.<ref name=\"Maor-20\"/> The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]], written by the Egyptian scribe [[Ahmes]] (c. 1680–1620 BC), contains the following problem related to trigonometry:<ref name=\"Maor-20\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"If a pyramid is 250 cubits high and the side of its base 360 cubits long, what is its ''[[seked]]''?\"}}\nAhmes' solution to the problem is the ratio of half the side of the base of the pyramid to its height, or the run-to-rise ratio of its face.

Aristarchus had known that in a given circle the ratio of arc to chord decreases as the arc decreases from 180° to 0°, tending toward a limit of 1.

      "text": "'''Hypot''' is a mathematical function defined to calculate the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of a right-angle triangle. It was designed to avoid errors arising due to limited-precision calculations performed on computers.\n\n==Motivation and usage==\nCalculating the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle is possible using the square root function on the sum of two squares, but hypot(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') avoids problems that occur when squaring very large or very small numbers.\n\nThe magnitude of the hypotenuse from (0,&nbsp;0) to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') can be calculated using:\n\n:<math>r = \\sqrt { x^2 + y^2 } \\, </math>\n\nThis operation is also known as [[Pythagorean addition]].\n\nHowever the squares of very large or small values of ''x'' and ''y'' may exceed the range of machine precision when calculated on a computer, leading to an inaccurate result caused by [[arithmetic underflow]] and/or [[arithmetic overflow]]. The hypot function was designed to calculate the result without causing this problem.\n\nThe hypot function is often used together with the [[atan2]] function to convert from [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] to [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]]:\n\n:&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;hypot(''x'',&nbsp;''y'')&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''θ''&nbsp;=&nbsp;atan2(''y'',&nbsp;''x'')\n\n==Implementation==\nThe difficulty with the naive implementation is that ''x''<sup>2</sup> or ''y''<sup>2</sup> may overflow or underflow, unless the intermediate result is computed with [[extended precision]]. A common implementation technique is to exchange the values, if necessary, so that |''x''|&nbsp;≥&nbsp;|''y''|, and then use the equivalent form:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nr & = \\sqrt { x^2 + y^2 } \\\\\n  & = \\sqrt { x^2 \\left( 1 + \\left(\\tfrac{y}{x}\\right)^2\\right) } \\\\\n  & = |x| \\sqrt {1 + \\left(\\tfrac{y}{x}\\right)^2 }\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe computation of ''y''/''x'' cannot overflow. If ''y''/''x'' underflows, the final result is equal to |''x''|, which is correct within the precision of the calculation. The square root is computed of a value between 1 and 2. Finally, the multiplication by |''x''| cannot underflow, and overflows only when the result is too large to represent.\n\n=== Pseudocode ===\n<source lang=c>\nfloat function hypot(float a, float b) {\n    let [float x, float y] = [  // x ≥ y\n        max(abs(a), abs(b)),\n        min(abs(a), abs(b))\n    ];\n    if (x == 0)                 // x = y = 0\n        return 0;               // avoid division by zero\n    let float t = y / x;        // 0 < t ≤ 1\n    return x * sqrt(1 + t * t); // > 0 \n}\n</source>\n\n==Programming language support==\nThe function is present in several programming languages:\n\n*[[C99]]\n*[[CSS]]\n*[[C++11]]<ref>http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/hypot/</ref>\n*[[D (programming language)]]<ref>https://dlang.org/phobos/std_math.html#.hypot</ref>\n*[[Fortran 2008]]\n*[[Julia (programming language)]]\n*[[Swift (programming language)]]\n*[[Python (programming language)]]<ref>https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.hypot</ref>\n*Apple's PowerPC Numerics<ref>https://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/mac/PPCNumerics/PPCNumerics-141.html</ref>\n*MATLAB<ref>http://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hypot.html</ref>\n*Pascal<ref>http://www.frameworkpascal.com/helphtml/hypot_func.htm</ref>\n*PHP<ref>http://www.php.net/hypot</ref>\n*Java (since version 1.5)<ref>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#hypot(double,%20double)</ref>\n*Kotlin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.math/hypot.html|title=hypot - Kotlin Programming Language|website=Kotlin|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n*Ruby<ref>http://ruby-doc.org/core/Math.html#method-c-hypot</ref>\n*Go<ref>http://golang.org/pkg/math/#Hypot</ref>\n*Rust<ref>https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html#method.hypot</ref>\n*JavaScript<ref>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/hypot</ref>\n*Some C90 and C++ libraries have provided a hypot function.<ref>Single Unix Specification, Open Group, http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/hypot.html</ref><ref>IBM, ILE C/C++ Run-Time Library Functions, http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iadthelp/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.etools.iseries.langref.doc/rzan5mst144.htm</ref><ref>The GNU C Library, Mathematics, http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/glibc-manual-0.02/library_17.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alpha max plus beta min algorithm]], a faster algorithm yielding an approximate result\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Trigonometry]]\n[[Category:Numerical analysis]]\n[[Category:Articles with example pseudocode]]"

The [[length]] of the hypotenuse of a [[right triangle]] can be found using the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which states that the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For example, if one of the other sides has a length of 3 (when squared, 9) and the other has a length of 4 (when squared, 16), then their squares add up to 25. The length of the hypotenuse is the [[square root]] of 25, that is, 5.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{wiktionary|ὑποτείνουσα}}\nThe word ''hypotenuse'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡ τὴν ὀρθὴν γωνίαν <u>ὑποτείνουσα</u>}} (sc. {{lang|grc|γραμμή}} or {{lang|grc|πλευρά}}), meaning \"[side] <u>subtending</u> the right angle\" ([[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]]),<ref>{{LSJ|u(po/}}, {{LSJ|tei/nw}}, {{LSJ|pleura/|ref}}</ref> {{lang|grc|ὑποτείνουσα}} ''hupoteinousa'' being the feminine present active participle of the verb {{lang|grc|ὑποτείνω}} ''hupo-teinō'' \"to stretch below, to subtend\", from {{lang|grc|τείνω}} ''teinō'' \"to stretch, extend\". The nominalised participle, {{lang|grc|ἡ ὑποτείνουσα}},  was used for the hypotenuse of a triangle in the 4th century BC (attested in [[Plato]], ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 54d). The Greek term was [[Romanization of Greek|loaned]] into [[Late Latin]],<!--\"Late Latin\" is from etymonline, without specification; we have evidence for the term being used in New Latin, but so far we have no reference to actual Late Latin--> as ''hypotēnūsa''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/hypotenuse|title=hypotenuse {{!}} Origin and meaning of hypotenuse by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>{{Better source|date=May 2019|reason=The source is a SELF PUBLISHED dictionary.

Using the common notation that the length of the two legs of the triangle (the sides perpendicular to each other) are ''a'' and ''b'' and that of the hypotenuse is ''c'', we have\n\n:<math>c = \\sqrt { a^2 + b^2 } .</math>\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem, and hence this length, can also be derived from the [[law of cosines]] by observing that the angle opposite the hypotenuse is 90° and noting that its cosine is 0:\n\n:<math>c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos90^\\circ = a^2 + b^2 \\therefore c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.</math>\n\nMany computer languages support the ISO C standard function hypot(''x'',''y''), which returns the value above. The function is designed not to fail where the straightforward calculation might overflow or underflow and can be slightly more accurate.\n\nSome scientific calculators provide a function to convert from [[rectangular coordinates]] to [[polar coordinates]]. This gives both the length of the hypotenuse and the [[angle]] the hypotenuse makes with the base line (''c<sub>1</sub>'' above) at the same time when given ''x'' and ''y''. The angle returned is normally given by [[atan2]](''y'',''x'').\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:Triângulo retângulo.svg|thumb|225px|right|In the figure, '''a''' is the hypotenuse and '''b''' and '''c''' are the catheti.

Some authors have speculated that this table only covered the range from 0 to 45 degrees, but nothing seems to support this claim. Such tables were extremely important for [[navigation]] at sea.

The final cell's value is divided by two, and the next iteration starts. Finally, the values of the last column get normalized.

The cases of [[Acute and obtuse triangles|obtuse triangles and acute triangles]] (corresponding to the two cases of negative or positive cosine) are treated separately, in Propositions 12 and 13 of Book 2.

In the 15th century, [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]], a Persian mathematician and astronomer, provided the first explicit statement of the law of cosines in a form suitable for [[triangulation]]. He provided accurate trigonometric tables and expressed the theorem in a form suitable for modern usage.

It is even possible to obtain a result slightly greater than one for the cosine of an angle.\n\nThe third formula shown is the result of solving for ''a'' in the [[quadratic equation]] {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> − 2''ab'' cos ''γ'' + ''b''<sup>2</sup> − ''c''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 0}}. This equation can have 2, 1, or 0 positive solutions corresponding to the number of possible triangles given the data. It will have two positive solutions if {{math|''b'' sin ''γ'' &lt; ''c'' &lt; ''b''}}, only one positive solution if {{math|''c'' {{=}} ''b'' sin ''γ''}}, and no solution if {{math|''c'' &lt; ''b'' sin ''γ''}} or {{math|''c'' &ge; ''b''}}. These different cases are also explained by the [[Congruence (geometry)#Side-side-angle|side-side-angle congruence ambiguity]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Proofs==\n\n===Using the distance formula===\n[[File:Law of Cosines Coordinate Proof Diagram.gif|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 4 – Coordinate geometry proof]]\nConsider a triangle with sides of length {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}}, where {{math|''θ''}} is the measurement of the angle opposite the side of length {{math|''c''}}. This triangle can be placed on the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] by plotting the following points, as shown in Fig. 4:\n:<math>A = (b \\cos\\theta, b \\sin\\theta), B = (a, 0), \\text{ and } C = (0, 0).</math>\n\nBy the [[distance formula]], we have\n:<math>c = \\sqrt{(a - b \\cos\\theta)^2 + (0 - b \\sin\\theta)^2}.</math>\n\nNow, we just work with that equation:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nc^2 & {}  =  (a - b \\cos\\theta)^2 + (- b \\sin\\theta)^2 \\\\\nc^2 & {}  =  a^2 - 2 a b \\cos\\theta+ b^2 \\cos^2 \\theta+ b^2 \\sin^2 \\theta\\\\\nc^2 & {}  =  a^2 + b^2 (\\sin^2 \\theta+ \\cos^2 \\theta) - 2 a b \\cos\\theta\\\\\nc^2 & {}  =  a^2 + b^2  - 2 a b \\cos\\theta.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAn advantage of this proof is that it does not require the consideration of different cases for when the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse.\n\n===Using trigonometry===\n[[Image:Triangle-with-cosines.svg|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 5 – An acute triangle with perpendicular]]\nDropping the [[perpendicular]] onto the side {{math|''c''}} through point ''C'', an [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]] of the triangle, shows (see Fig.&nbsp;5)\n:<math>c=a\\cos\\beta+b\\cos\\alpha.</math> \n\n(This is still true if {{math|''α''}} or {{math|''β''}} is obtuse, in which case the perpendicular falls outside the triangle.)  Multiplying through by {{math|''c''}} yields\n:<math>c^2 = ac\\cos\\beta + bc\\cos\\alpha.</math>\n\nConsidering the two other altitudes of the triangle yields\n:<math>a^2 = ac\\cos\\beta + ab\\cos\\gamma,</math>\n:<math>b^2 = bc\\cos\\alpha + ab\\cos\\gamma.</math>\n\nAdding the latter two equations gives\n:<math>a^2 + b^2 = ac\\cos\\beta + bc\\cos\\alpha + 2ab\\cos\\gamma.</math>\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the last one results in\n:<math>a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = ac\\cos\\beta + bc\\cos\\alpha + 2ab\\cos\\gamma - ( ac\\cos\\beta + bc\\cos\\alpha )</math>\n\nwhich simplifies to\n:<math>c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos\\gamma.</math>\n\nThis proof uses [[trigonometry]] in that it treats the cosines of the various angles as quantities in their own right. It uses the fact that the cosine of an angle expresses the relation between the two sides enclosing that angle in ''any'' right triangle. Other proofs (below) are more geometric in that they treat an expression such as {{math|''a'' cos ''γ''}} merely as a label for the length of a certain line segment.\n{{clear}}\n\nMany proofs deal with the cases of obtuse and acute angles {{math|''γ''}} separately.\n\n===Using the Pythagorean theorem===\n[[Image:Obtuse Triangle With Altitude ZP.svg|thumb|200px|Obtuse triangle {{math|''ABC''}} with height {{math|''BH''}}]]\n\n====Case of an obtuse angle====\n[[Euclid]] proves this theorem by applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] to each of the two right triangles in the figure shown ({{math|''AHB''}} and {{math|''CHB''}}). Using {{math|''d''}} to denote the line segment {{math|''CH''}} and {{math|''h''}} for the height {{math|''BH''}}, triangle {{math|''AHB''}} gives us\n:<math>c^2 = (b+d)^2 + h^2,</math>\n\nand triangle {{math|''CHB''}} gives\n:<math>d^2 + h^2 = a^2.</math>\n\n[[Polynomial expansion|Expanding]] the first equation gives\n:<math>c^2 = b^2 + 2bd + d^2 +h^2.</math>\n\nSubstituting the second equation into this, the following can be obtained:\n:<math>c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2bd.</math>\n\nThis is Euclid's Proposition 12 from Book 2 of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.<ref name=Joyce>[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookII/propII12.html Java applet version] by Prof. D E Joyce of Clark University.</ref> To transform it into the modern form of the law of cosines, note that\n:<math>d = a\\cos(\\pi-\\gamma)= -a\\cos\\gamma.</math>\n\n====Case of an acute angle====\nEuclid's proof of his Proposition 13 proceeds along the same lines as his proof of Proposition 12: he applies the Pythagorean theorem to both right triangles formed by dropping the perpendicular onto one of the sides enclosing the angle {{math|''γ''}} and uses the binomial theorem to simplify.\n\n[[Image:Triangle with trigonometric proof of the law of cosines.svg|thumb|319px|left|Fig. 6 – A short proof using trigonometry for the case of an acute angle]]\n\n====Another proof in the acute case====\nUsing more trigonometry, the law of cosines can be deduced by using the Pythagorean theorem only ''once''. In fact, by using the right triangle on the left hand side of Fig. 6 it can be shown that:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nc^2 & {} = (b-a\\cos\\gamma)^2 + (a\\sin\\gamma)^2 \\\\\n& {} = b^2 - 2ab\\cos\\gamma + a^2\\cos^2\\gamma+a^2\\sin^2\\gamma \\\\\n& {} = b^2 + a^2 - 2ab\\cos\\gamma,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nusing the [[trigonometric identity]]\n:<math>\\cos^2\\gamma + \\sin^2\\gamma = 1.</math>\n\nThis proof needs a slight modification if {{math|''b'' &lt; ''a'' cos(''γ'')}}. In this case, the right triangle to which the Pythagorean theorem is applied moves ''outside'' the triangle {{math|''ABC''}}. The only effect this has on the calculation is that the quantity {{math|''b'' − ''a'' cos(''γ'')}} is replaced by {{math|''a'' cos(''γ'') − ''b''.}} As this quantity enters the calculation only through its square, the rest of the proof is unaffected. However, this problem only occurs when {{math|''β''}} is obtuse, and may be avoided by reflecting the triangle about the bisector of {{math|''γ''}}.\n\nReferring to Fig. 6 it is worth noting that if the angle opposite side {{math|''a''}} is {{math|''α''}} then:\n:<math>\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{a\\sin\\gamma}{b-a\\cos\\gamma}.</math>\n\nThis is useful for direct calculation of a second angle when two sides and an included angle are given.\n\n===Using Ptolemy's theorem===\n[[Image:Ptolemy cos.svg|thumb|300px|right|Proof of law of cosines using Ptolemy's theorem]]\nReferring to the diagram, triangle ''ABC'' with sides {{math|''AB''}} = {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''BC''}} = {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''AC''}} = {{math|''b''}} is drawn inside its circumcircle as shown.

English version George Allen and Unwin, 1964. Translated from the German version Meyers Rechenduden, 1960.</ref> is a relationship among the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cotangents of the halves of the three angles.\n\nJust as three quantities whose equality is expressed by the [[law of sines]] are equal to the diameter of the [[circumscribed circle]] of the triangle (or to its reciprocal, depending on how the law is expressed), so also the law of cotangents relates the radius of the [[inscribed circle]] of a [[triangle]] (the [[inradius]]) to its sides and angles.\n\n==Statement==\nUsing the usual notations for a triangle (see the figure at the upper right), where {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are the lengths of the three sides, {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} are the vertices opposite those three respective sides, {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, {{math|''γ''}} are the corresponding angles at those vertices, {{math|''s''}} is the semi-perimeter, that is, {{math|''s'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''|2}}}}, and {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the inscribed circle, the law of [[trigonometric function|cotangent]]s states that\n:<math>\\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}{s-a} = \\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\beta}{2}\\right)}{s-b} = \\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)}{s-c} = \\frac{1}{r}\\,</math>\n\nand furthermore that the inradius is given by\n:<math>r = \\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s}}\\,.</math>\n\n==Proof==\nIn the upper figure, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides of the triangle break the perimeter into 6 segments, in 3 pairs. In each pair the segments are of equal length. For example, the 2 segments adjacent to vertex {{math|''A''}} are equal. If we pick one segment from each pair, their sum will be the semiperimeter {{math|''s''}}. An example of this is the segments shown in color in the figure. The two segments making up the red line add up to {{math|''a''}}, so the blue segment must be of length {{math|''s'' − ''a''}}.

In some such cases, the triangle is not uniquely determined by this data (called the ''ambiguous case'') and the technique gives two possible values for the enclosed angle.\n\nThe law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations commonly applied to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles, with the other being the [[law of cosines]].\n\nThe law of sines can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature.<ref name=mathworld>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedLawofSines.html|website=mathworld|title=Generalized law of sines}}</ref>\n\n==Proof==\nThe area {{math|''T''}} of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height.  Selecting one side of the triangle as the base, the height of the triangle relative to that base is computed as the length of another side times the sine of the angle between the chosen side and the base.  Thus, depending on the selection of the base the area of the triangle can be written as any of:\n:<math>T = \\frac{1}{2}b(c \\sin A) = \\frac{1}{2}c(a \\sin B) = \\frac{1}{2}a(b \\sin C)\\,.</math>\nMultiplying these by {{math|{{sfrac|2|''abc''}}}} gives\n:<math>\\frac{2T}{abc} = \\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}\\,.</math>\n\n==The ambiguous case of triangle solution==\nWhen using the law of sines to find a side of a triangle, an ambiguous case occurs when two separate triangles can be constructed from the data provided (i.e., there are two different possible solutions to the triangle). In the case shown below they are triangles {{math|''ABC''}} and {{math|''AB′C′''}}.\n\n:[[File:PictureAmbitext.svg]]\n\nGiven a general triangle, the following conditions would need to be fulfilled for the case to be ambiguous:\n* The only information known about the triangle is the angle {{math|''A''}} and the sides {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n* The angle {{math|''A''}} is [[Angle#Types of angles|acute]] (i.e., {{math|''A''}} < 90°).\n* The side {{math|''a''}} is shorter than the side {{math|''c''}} (i.e., {{math|''a'' < ''c''}}).\n* The side {{math|''a''}} is longer than the altitude {{math|''h''}} from angle {{math|''B''}}, where {{math|''h'' {{=}} ''c'' sin ''A''}} (i.e., {{math|''a'' > ''h''}}).\n\nIf all the above conditions are true, then each of angles {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''C′''}} produces a valid triangle, meaning that both of the following are true:\n\n:<math> C' = \\arcsin\\frac{c \\sin A}{a} \\text{ or } C = \\pi - \\arcsin\\frac{c \\sin A}{a}.</math>\n\nFrom there we can find the corresponding {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''b''}} or {{math|''B′''}} and {{math|''b′''}} if required, where {{math|''b''}} is the side bounded by angles {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''b′''}} bounded by {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C′''}}.\n\nWithout further information it is impossible to decide which is the triangle being asked for.\n\n==Examples==\nThe following are examples of how to solve a problem using the law of sines.\n\n===Example 1===\nGiven: side {{math|''a'' {{=}} 20}}, side {{math|''c'' {{=}} 24}}, and angle {{math|''C'' {{=}} 40°}}.

Thus the angles {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are the angles {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, respectively. The arc {{math|BC}} subtends an angle of magnitude {{math|''a''}} at the centre. Introduce a Cartesian basis with {{math|'''OA'''}} along the {{math|''z''}}-axis and {{math|'''OB'''}} in the {{math|''xz''}}-plane making an angle {{math|''c''}} with the {{math|''z''}}-axis. The vector {{math|'''OC'''}} projects to {{math|ON}} in the {{math|''xy''}}-plane and the angle between {{math|ON}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis is {{math|''A''}}. Therefore, the three vectors have components:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{OA} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sin c \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\cos c\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{OC} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sin b\\cos A \\\\ \\sin b\\sin A \\\\ \\cos b\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe [[scalar triple product]], {{math|'''OA''' · ('''OB''' × '''OC''')}} is the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] formed by the position vectors of the vertices of the spherical triangle {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}}. This volume is invariant to the specific coordinate system used to represent {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}}. The value of the [[scalar triple product]] {{math|'''OA''' · ('''OB''' × '''OC''')}} is the 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 determinant with {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}} as its rows.

The law of [[trigonometric function|tangent]]s states that\n\n:<math>\\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \\frac{\\tan\\left(\\tfrac12(\\alpha-\\beta)\\right)}{\\tan\\left(\\tfrac12(\\alpha+\\beta)\\right)}.</math>\n\nThe law of tangents, although not as commonly known as the [[law of sines]] or the [[law of cosines]], is equivalent to the law of sines, and can be used in any case where two sides and the included angle, or two angles and a side, are known.\n\n==Proof==\nTo prove the law of tangents we can start with the [[law of sines]]:\n\n: <math>\\frac{a}{\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{b}{\\sin\\beta}.</math>\n\nLet\n\n: <math>d = \\frac{a}{\\sin\\alpha} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad d = \\frac{b}{\\sin\\beta}</math>\n\nso that\n\n: <math>a = d \\sin\\alpha \\quad\\text{and}\\quad b = d \\sin\\beta. </math>\n\nIt follows that\n\n: <math>\\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \\frac{d \\sin \\alpha - d\\sin\\beta}{d\\sin\\alpha + d\\sin\\beta} = \\frac{\\sin \\alpha - \\sin\\beta}{\\sin\\alpha + \\sin\\beta}.</math>\n\nUsing the [[List of trigonometric identities#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|trigonometric identity]], the factor formula for sines specifically\n\n: <math> \\sin(\\alpha) \\pm \\sin(\\beta) = 2 \\sin\\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\pm \\beta}{2} \\right) \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\mp \\beta}{2} \\right), </math>\n\nwe get\n\n:<math>\\frac{a-b}{a+b} =  \\frac{2\\sin\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha-\\beta\\right)\\cos\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha+\\beta\\right)}{2\\sin\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha+\\beta \\right)\\cos\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha-\\beta\\right)} = \\frac{\\sin\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha-\\beta\\right)}{\\cos\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha-\\beta\\right)} \\div \\frac{\\sin\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha+\\beta\\right)}{\\cos\\tfrac12\\left(\\alpha+\\beta\\right)} = \\frac{\\tan\\left(\\tfrac12(\\alpha-\\beta)\\right)}{\\tan\\left(\\tfrac12(\\alpha+\\beta)\\right)}.</math>\n\nAs an alternative to using the identity for the sum or difference of two sines, one may cite the trigonometric identity\n\n: <math> \\tan\\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\pm \\beta}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha \\pm \\sin\\beta}{\\cos\\alpha + \\cos\\beta} </math>\n\n(see [[tangent half-angle formula]]).\n\n==Application==\nThe law of tangents can be used to compute the missing side and angles of a triangle in which two sides {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and the enclosed angle {{math|''γ''}} are given. From \n:<math>\\tan\\left(\\tfrac12(\\alpha-\\beta)\\right) = \\frac{a-b}{a+b} \\tan\\left(\\tfrac12(\\alpha+\\beta)\\right)= \n\\frac{a-b}{a+b} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)</math>\none can compute {{math|''α'' − ''β''}}; together with {{math|''α'' + ''β'' {{=}} 180° − ''γ''}} this yields {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}; the remaining side {{math|''c''}} can then be computed using the [[law of sines]].   In the time before electronic calculators were available, this method\nwas preferable to an application of  the [[law of cosines]] {{math|''c'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''a''{{sup|2}} + ''b''{{sup|2}} − 2''ab'' cos ''γ''}}}}, as this latter law necessitated an additional lookup in a [[logarithm table]], in order to compute the square root.  In modern times the law of tangents may have better [[numerical analysis|numerical]] properties than the law of cosines: If {{math|''γ''}} is small, and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are almost equal, then an application of the law of cosines leads to a subtraction of almost equal values, which implies a [[Loss of significance|loss of significant digits]].\n\n== Spherical version ==\n\nOn a sphere of unit radius, the sides of the triangle are arcs of [[great circle]]s. Accordingly, their lengths can be expressed in radians or any other units of angular measure. Let {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} be the angles at the three vertices of the triangle and let  {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} be the respective lengths of the opposite sides. The spherical law of tangents says<ref>Daniel Zwillinger, ''CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae'', 32nd Edition, CRC Press, 2011, page 219.</ref>\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\tan\\left(\\dfrac{A-B}{2}\\right)}{\\tan\\left(\\dfrac{A+B}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\tan\\left(\\dfrac{a-b}{2}\\right)}{\\tan\\left(\\dfrac{a+b}{2}\\right)}. </math>\n\n==History==\nThe law of tangents for spherical triangles was described in the 13th century by [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian mathematician]] [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274), who also presented the law of sines for plane triangles in his five-volume work ''Treatise on the Quadrilateral''.<ref name=Debarnot>\n\n{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPGRYLlwbrEC&pg=PA182 |title=Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science, Volume 2 |editor=Rushdī Rāshid, Régis Morelon |author=Marie-Thérèse Debarnot |chapter=Trigonometry |isbn=0-415-12411-5 |year=1996 |page=182 |publisher=Routledge}}\n\n</ref><ref name= Bosworth>\n\n{{cite book |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Volume 4, Part 2 |editor=C.

This family of [[curve]]s was investigated by [[Nathaniel Bowditch]]  in 1815, and later in more detail by [[Jules Antoine Lissajous]] in 1857.\n\nThe appearance of the figure is highly sensitive to the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}. For a ratio of 1, the figure is an [[ellipse]], with special cases including [[circles]] ({{math|1=''A'' = ''B''}}, {{math|1=''δ'' = {{sfrac|[[pi|π]]|2}}}} [[radian]]s) and [[line (mathematics)|lines]] ({{math|1=''δ'' = 0}}). Another simple Lissajous figure is the [[parabola]] ({{math|1={{sfrac|''b''|''a''}} = 2}}, {{math|1=''δ'' = {{sfrac|π|4}}}}). Other ratios produce more complicated curves, which are closed only if {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is [[rational number|rational]]. The visual form of these curves is often suggestive of a three-dimensional [[knot (mathematical)|knot]], and indeed many kinds of knots, including those known as [[Lissajous knot]]s, project to the plane as Lissajous figures.\n\nVisually, the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} determines the number of \"lobes\" of the figure. For example, a ratio of {{sfrac|3|1}} or {{sfrac|1|3}} produces a figure with three major lobes (see image). Similarly, a ratio of {{sfrac|5|4}} produces a figure with five horizontal lobes and four vertical lobes. Rational ratios produce closed (connected) or \"still\" figures, while irrational ratios produce figures that appear to rotate. The ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''A''|''B''}}}} determines the relative width-to-height ratio of the curve. For example, a ratio of {{sfrac|2|1}} produces a figure that is twice as wide as it is high. Finally, the value of {{math|''δ''}} determines the apparent \"rotation\" angle of the figure, viewed as if it were actually a three-dimensional curve. For example, {{math|1=''δ'' = 0}} produces {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} components that are exactly in phase, so the resulting figure appears as an apparent three-dimensional figure viewed from straight on (0°). In contrast, any non-zero {{math|''δ''}} produces a figure that appears to be rotated, either as a left–right or an up–down rotation (depending on the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}).\n\n[[Image:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lissajous figure on an [[oscilloscope]], displaying a 1:3 relationship between the frequencies of the vertical and horizontal sinusoidal inputs, respectively.

This property is exploited to produce a set of points, called [[Padua points]], at which a function may be sampled in order to compute either a bivariate interpolation or quadrature of the function over the domain {{math|[−1,1] × [−1,1]}}.\n\nThe relation of some Lissajous curves to Chebyshev polynomials is clearer to understand if the Lissajous curve which generates each of them is expressed using cosine functions rather than sine functions.\n\n: <math>x=\\cos(t),\\quad y=\\cos(Nt)</math>\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Lissajous animation.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Animation showing curve adaptation as the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} increases from 0 to 1]]\n\nThe animation shows the curve adaptation with continuously increasing {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} fraction from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01 ({{math|1=''δ'' = 0}}).\n\nBelow are examples of Lissajous figures with {{math|1=''δ'' = {{sfrac|''π''|2}}}}, an odd [[natural number]] {{math|''a''}}, an even [[natural number]] {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|1={{abs|''a'' − ''b''}} = 1}}.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Lissajous_curve_1by2.svg|{{math|1=''a'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''b'' = 2}} (1:2)\nImage:Lissajous_curve_3by2.svg|{{math|1=''a'' = 3}}, {{math|1=''b'' = 2}} (3:2)\nImage:Lissajous_curve_3by4.svg|{{math|1=''a'' = 3}}, {{math|1=''b'' = 4}} (3:4)\nImage:Lissajous_curve_5by4.svg|{{math|1=''a'' = 5}}, {{math|1=''b'' = 4}} (5:4)\n</gallery>\n\n==Generation==\nPrior to modern electronic equipment, Lissajous curves could be generated mechanically by means of a [[harmonograph]].\n\n=== Practical application ===\nLissajous curves can also be generated using an [[oscilloscope]] (as illustrated). An [[Analog signature analysis|octopus circuit]] can be used to demonstrate the [[waveform]] images on an oscilloscope. Two phase-shifted sinusoid inputs are applied to the oscilloscope in X-Y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is presented as a Lissajous figure.\n\nIn the professional audio world, this method is used for realtime analysis of the phase relationship between the left and right channels of a stereo audio signal. On larger, more sophisticated audio mixing consoles an oscilloscope may be built-in for this purpose.\n\nOn an oscilloscope, we suppose {{math|''x''}} is CH1 and {{math|''y''}} is CH2, {{math|''A''}} is the amplitude of CH1 and {{math|''B''}} is the amplitude of CH2, {{math|''a''}} is the frequency of CH1 and {{math|''b''}} is the frequency of CH2, so {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is the ratio of frequencies of the two channels, and {{math|''δ''}} is the phase shift of CH1.\n\nA purely mechanical application of a Lissajous curve with {{math|1=''a'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''b'' = 2}} is in the driving mechanism of the [[Mars Light]] type of oscillating beam lamps popular with railroads in the mid-1900s. The beam in some versions traces out a lopsided figure-8 pattern on its side.\n\n==Application for the case of {{math|1= ''a'' = ''b''}}==\n[[Image:LissajousTechnion.png|thumb|250px|right|In this figure both input frequencies are identical, but the phase variance between them creates the shape of an [[ellipse]].]]\n[[File:Circular Lissajous.gif|thumb|250px|right|'''Top:''' Output signal as a function of time.<br>'''Middle:''' Input signal as a function of time.<br>'''Bottom:''' Resulting Lissajous curve when output is plotted as a function of the input.<br>In this particular example, because the output is 90 degrees out of phase from the input, the Lissajous curve is a circle, and is rotating counterclockwise.]]\nWhen the input to an [[LTI system]] is sinusoidal, the output is sinusoidal with the same frequency, but it may have a different amplitude and some [[phase shift]]. Using an [[oscilloscope]] that can plot one signal against another (as opposed to one signal against time) to plot the output of an LTI system against the input to the LTI system produces an ellipse that is a Lissajous figure for the special case of {{math|1= ''a'' = ''b''}}. The [[aspect ratio]] of the resulting ellipse is a function of the phase shift between the input and output, with an aspect ratio of 1 (perfect circle) corresponding to a phase shift of ±90° and an aspect ratio of ∞ (a line) corresponding to a phase shift of 0° or 180°.<ref name=Al-Khazali/>\n\nThe figure below summarizes how the Lissajous figure changes over different phase shifts. The phase shifts are all negative so that [[propagation delay|delay]] [[semantics]] can be used with a [[causal system|causal]] LTI system (note that −270° is equivalent to +90°).

[[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov orbits]] around a Lagrangian point are curved paths that lie entirely in the plane of the two primary bodies. In contrast, Lissajous orbits include components in this plane and perpendicular to it, and follow a [[Lissajous curve]]. [[Halo orbit]]s also include components perpendicular to the plane, but they are periodic, while Lissajous orbits are not.<ref>{{cite conference\n| last = Koon\n| first = Wang Sang\n| title = Dynamical Systems, the Three-Body Problem, and Space Mission Design\n| booktitle =  International Conference on Differential Equations\n| publisher = [[World Scientific]]\n| url = http://www.gg.caltech.edu/~mwl/publications/papers/dynamicalThreeBody.pdf\n| location = Berlin\n| date = 2000\n| pages = 1167–1181}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, any orbits around Lagrangian points {{L1}}, {{L2}}, or {{L3}} are dynamically unstable, meaning small departures from equilibrium grow over time.<ref>{{cite web |title= ESA Science & Technology: Orbit/Navigation |url= http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=34699 |date= 14 June 2009 |publisher= [[European Space Agency]] |accessdate = 2009-06-12}}</ref> As a result, spacecraft in these Lagrangian point orbits must use their propulsion systems to perform [[orbital station-keeping]].

Geometrically, these are [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] involving certain functions of one or more [[angle]]s. They are distinct from [[Trigonometry#Common formulae|triangle identities]], which are identities potentially involving angles but also involving side lengths or other lengths of a [[triangle]].\n\nThese identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. An important application is the [[integral|integration]] of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique involves first using the [[Trigonometric substitution|substitution rule with a trigonometric function]], and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.\n\n==Notation==\n\n===Angles===\n[[File:trigonometric function quadrant sign.svg|thumb|Signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.

Their usual abbreviations are {{math|sin(''θ'')}}, {{math|cos(''θ'')}} and {{math|tan(''θ'')}}, respectively, where {{mvar|θ}} denotes the angle. The parentheses around the argument of the functions are often omitted, e.g., {{math|sin ''θ''}} and {{math|cos ''θ''}}, if an interpretation is unambiguously possible.\n\nThe sine of an angle is defined, in the context of a [[right triangle]], as the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite to the angle divided by the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n:<math>\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}.</math>\nThe cosine of an angle in this context is the ratio of the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.\n:<math>\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}.</math>\nThe [[tangent function|tangent]] of an angle in this context is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite to the angle divided by the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle. This is the same as the [[ratio]] of the sine to the cosine of this angle, as can be seen by substituting the definitions of {{math|sin}} and {{math|cos}} from above:\n:<math>\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}=\\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}.</math>\n\nThe remaining trigonometric functions secant ({{math|sec}}), cosecant ({{math|csc}}), and cotangent ({{math|cot}}) are defined as the [[Trigonometric functions#Cosecant, secant, and cotangent|reciprocal functions]] of cosine, sine, and tangent, respectively. Rarely, these are called the secondary trigonometric functions:\n\n:<math>\\sec\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta},\\quad\\csc\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta},\\quad\\cot\\theta=\\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}=\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}.</math>\nThese definitions are sometimes referred to as [[Proofs of trigonometric identities#Ratio identities|ratio identities]].\n\n==Inverse functions==\n{{main|Inverse trigonometric functions}}\nThe inverse trigonometric functions are partial [[inverse function]]s for the trigonometric functions. For example, the inverse function for the sine, known as the '''inverse sine''' ({{math|sin<sup>−1</sup>}}) or '''arcsine''' ({{math|arcsin}} or {{math|asin}}), satisfies\n:<math>\\sin(\\arcsin x) = x\\quad\\text{for} \\quad |x| \\leq 1 </math>\nand\n:<math>\\arcsin(\\sin x) = x\\quad\\text{for} \\quad |x| \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}. </math>\n\nThis article uses the notation below for inverse trigonometric functions:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Some examples of shifts are shown below in the table.\n* A '''full turn''', or {{math|360°}}, or 2{{pi}} radian does not change anything along the unit circle and makes up the smallest interval for which the trigonometric functions {{math|sin, cos, sec, and csc}} repeat their values, and is thus their period. Shifting arguments of any periodic function by any integer multiple of a full period preserves the function value of the unshifted argument.\n* A '''half turn''', or {{math|180°}}, or {{pi}} radian is the period of {{math|tan(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|sin(''x'')|cos(''x'')}} and cot(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|cos(''x'')|sin(''x'')}}}}, as can be seen from these definitions and the period of the defining trigonometric functions. So shifting the arguments of {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} by any multiple of {{pi}}, does not change their function values.\n:For the functions {{math|sin, cos, sec, and csc}} with period 2{{pi}} half a turn is half of their period. For this shift they change the sign of their values, as can be seen from the unit circle again. This new value repeats after any additional shift of 2{{pi}}, so all together they change the sign for a shift by any odd multiple of {{pi}}, i.e., by {{math|(2''k'' + 1)⋅{{pi}}}}, with {{mvar|k}} an arbitrary integer. Any even multiple of {{pi}} is of course just a full period, and a backward shift by half a period is the same as a backward shift by one full period plus one shift forward by half a period.\n* A '''quarter turn''', or {{math|90°}}, or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radian is a half period shift for {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} with period {{math|{{pi}}}} ({{math|180°}}), and yields the function value of applying the complementary function to the unshifted argument. By the argument above this also holds for a shift by any odd multiple {{math|(2''k'' + 1)⋅{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}} of the half period.\n: For the four other trigonometric functions a quarter turn also represents a quarter period. A shift by an arbitrary multiple of a quarter period, that is not covered by a multiple of half periods, can be decomposed in an integer multiple of periods, plus or minus one quarter period. The terms expressing these multiples are {{math|(4''k'' ± 1)⋅{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}. The forward/backward shifts by one quarter period are reflected in the table below. Again, these shifts yield function values, employing the respective complementary function applied to the unshifted argument.\n: Shifting the arguments of {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} by their quarter period ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}}) does not yield such simple results.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF\"\n!Shift by one quarter period\n!Shift by one half period<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;72, 4.3.9</ref>\n!Shift by full periods<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;72, 4.3.7–8</ref>\n!Period\n|-\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\pm\\cos \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\sin \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\mp\\sin \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\cos \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\cos \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}) =  \\tfrac{\\tan \\theta \\pm 1}{1\\mp \\tan \\theta}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\cot \\theta </math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta + k\\cdot \\pi) = +\\tan \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\pm\\sec \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\csc \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\csc \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\mp\\csc \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sec \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\sec \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}) =  \\tfrac{\\cot \\theta \\pm 1}{1\\mp \\cot \\theta}</math>\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\tan\\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta + k\\cdot \\pi) = +\\cot \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>\\pi</math>\n|}\n\n==Angle sum and difference identities==\n[[File:AngleAdditionDiagramSine.svg|right|thumb|225px|Illustration of angle addition formulae for the sine and cosine.

The most intuitive derivation uses rotation matrices (see below).\n\n[[File:AngleAdditionDiagramTangent.svg|right|thumb|225px|Illustration of the angle addition formula for the tangent.

The {{math|cos ''β''}} leg is itself the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{mvar|α}}; that triangle's legs, therefore, have lengths given by {{math|sin ''α''}} and {{math|cos ''α''}}, multiplied by {{math|cos ''β''}}. The {{math|sin ''β''}} leg, as hypotenuse of another right triangle with angle {{mvar|α}}, likewise leads to segments of length {{math|cos ''α'' sin ''β''}} and {{math|sin ''α'' sin ''β''}}. Now, we observe that the \"1\" segment is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{math|''α'' + ''β''}}; the leg opposite this angle necessarily has length {{math|sin(''α'' + ''β'')}}, while the leg adjacent has length {{math|cos(''α'' + ''β'')}}. Consequently, as the opposing sides of the diagram's outer rectangle are equal, we deduce\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) &= \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\\\\n\\cos(\\alpha + \\beta) &= \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta - \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\end{align}</math>\nRelocating one of the named angles yields a variant of the diagram that demonstrates the angle difference formulae for sine and cosine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trigonography.com/2015/09/28/angle-sum-and-difference-for-sine-and-cosine/|title=Angle Sum and Difference for Sine and Cosine|last=The Trigonographer|date=28 September 2015|website=Trigonography.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2017}}</ref> (The diagram admits further variants to accommodate angles and sums greater than a right angle.)

Furthermore, matrix multiplication of the rotation matrix for an angle {{math|''α''}} with a column vector will rotate the column vector counterclockwise by the angle {{math|''α''}}.\n\nSince multiplication by a [[complex number]] of unit length rotates the complex plane by the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of the number, the above multiplication of rotation matrices is equivalent to a multiplication of complex numbers:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}(\\cos\\alpha + i\\sin\\alpha)(\\cos\\beta + i\\sin\\beta) \n&=& (\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta-\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\beta)+i(\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\beta)\\\\\n&=& \\cos(\\alpha{+}\\beta) + i\\sin(\\alpha{+}\\beta).\n\\end{array}</math></blockquote>In terms of [[Euler's formula]], this simply says <math>e^{i\\alpha} e^{i\\beta} = e^{i(\\alpha+\\beta)}</math>, showing that <math>\\theta\\ \\mapsto\\ e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta</math> is a one-dimensional complex representation of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(2)</math>.\n\n=== Sines and cosines of sums of infinitely many angles ===\nWhen the series <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i</math> [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]] then\n: <math> \\sin\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i\\right)\n=\\sum_{\\text{odd}\\ k \\ge 1} (-1)^\\frac{k-1}{2}\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} \\sin\\theta_i \\prod_{i \\not \\in A} \\cos\\theta_i\\right) </math>\n\n: <math> \\cos\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i\\right)\n=\\sum_{\\text{even}\\ k \\ge 0} ~ (-1)^\\frac{k}{2} ~~\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} \\sin\\theta_i \\prod_{i \\not \\in A} \\cos\\theta_i\\right) \\,.</math>\n\nBecause the series <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i</math> converges absolutely, it is necessarily the case that <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\theta_i = 0</math>, <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sin\\,\\theta_i = 0</math>, and <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\cos \\theta_i = 1</math>.  In particular, in these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many angles: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors but there are [[cofiniteness|cofinite]]ly many cosine factors.  Terms with infinitely many sine factors would necessarily be equal to zero.\n\nWhen only finitely many of the angles {{mvar|θ<sub>i</sub>}} are nonzero then only finitely many of the terms on the right side are nonzero because all but finitely many sine factors vanish.  Furthermore, in each term all but finitely many of the cosine factors are unity.\n\n=== Tangents and cotangents of sums ===\nLet {{mvar|e<sub>k</sub>}} (for {{mvar|k}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;...) be the {{mvar|k}}th-degree [[elementary symmetric polynomial]] in the variables\n\n: <math>x_i = \\tan \\theta_i</math>\n\nfor {{mvar|i}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;..., i.e.,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\ne_0 & = 1 \\\\[6pt]\ne_1 & = \\sum_i x_i & & = \\sum_i \\tan\\theta_i \\\\[6pt]\ne_2 & = \\sum_{i < j} x_i x_j & & = \\sum_{i < j} \\tan\\theta_i \\tan\\theta_j \\\\[6pt]\ne_3 & = \\sum_{i < j < k} x_i x_j x_k & & = \\sum_{i < j < k} \\tan\\theta_i \\tan\\theta_j \\tan\\theta_k \\\\\n& {}\\ \\ \\vdots & & {}\\ \\ \\vdots\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThen\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\\tan\\left(\\sum_i \\theta_i\\right)\n& = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\sum_i \\theta_i\\right) / \\prod_i \\cos \\theta_i}{\\cos\\left(\\sum_i \\theta_i\\right) / \\prod_i \\cos \\theta_i}\n\\\\& = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{odd}\\ k \\ge 1} (-1)^\\frac{k-1}{2}\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\prod_{i \\in A} \\tan\\theta_i}{\\sum_{\\text{even}\\ k \\ge 0} ~ (-1)^\\frac{k}{2} ~~\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\prod_{i \\in A} \\tan\\theta_i}\n= \\frac{e_1 - e_3 + e_5 -\\cdots}{e_0 - e_2 + e_4 - \\cdots}\n\\\\\n\\cot\\left(\\sum_i \\theta_i\\right)\n& = \\frac{e_0 - e_2 + e_4 - \\cdots}{e_1 - e_3 + e_5 -\\cdots}\n\\end{align}</math>\nusing the sine and cosine sum formulae above.\n\nThe number of terms on the right side depends on the number of terms on the left side.\n\nFor example:\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n\\tan(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2) &\n= \\frac{ e_1 }{ e_0 - e_2 }\n= \\frac{ x_1 + x_2 }{ 1 \\ - \\ x_1 x_2 }\n= \\frac{ \\tan\\theta_1 + \\tan\\theta_2 }{ 1 \\ - \\ \\tan\\theta_1 \\tan\\theta_2 },\n\\\\[8pt]\n\\tan(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 + \\theta_3) &\n= \\frac{ e_1 - e_3 }{ e_0 - e_2 }\n= \\frac{ (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) \\ - \\ (x_1 x_2 x_3) }{ 1 \\ - \\ (x_1x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3) },\n\\\\[8pt]\n\\tan(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 + \\theta_3 + \\theta_4) &\n= \\frac{ e_1 - e_3 }{ e_0 - e_2 + e_4 } \\\\[8pt] &\n= \\frac{ (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) \\ - \\ (x_1 x_2 x_3 + x_1 x_2 x_4 + x_1 x_3 x_4 + x_2 x_3 x_4) }{ 1 \\ - \\ (x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_1 x_4 + x_2 x_3 + x_2 x_4 + x_3 x_4) \\ + \\ (x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4) },\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand so on.

      "text": "{{Contains Indic text}}\n\n'''Madhava's sine table''' is the [[table (information)|table]] of [[sine|trigonometric sines]] of various [[angle]]s constructed by the 14th century [[Kerala]] [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]]. The table lists the trigonometric sines of the twenty-four angles 3.75°, 7.50°, 11.25°, ..., and 90.00° (angles that are [[integer|integral]] [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3.75°, i.e. 1/24 of a right angle, beginning with 3.75 and ending with 90.00). The table is [[character encoding|encoded]] in the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] of [[Devanagari]] using the [[Katapayadi system]]. This gives the entries in the table an appearance of the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of a [[poem]] in [[Sanskrit]].\n\nMadhava's original work containing the sine table has not yet been traced. The table is seen reproduced in the ''Aryabhatiyabhashya'' of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544) and also in the ''Yuktidipika/Laghuvivrti'' commentary of [[Tantrasamgraha]] by [[Sankara Variar]] (circa. 1500-1560).<ref name=\"Raju\">{{cite book|last=C.K.

Raju.<ref name=\"Raju\"/> The first twelve lines constitute the entries in the table. The last word in the thirteenth line indicates that these are \"as told by Madhava\".\n\n[[Image:Madhava sine tabe in Devanagari.JPG|thumb|center|350px|Madhava's sine table in [[Devanagari]]]]\n\n==Values in Madhava's table==\n[[Image:Madhavasine.jpeg|thumb|center|300px|Diagram explaining the meaning of the values in Madhava's table]]\n\nTo understand the meaning of the values tabulated by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Madhava]], consider some angle whose measure is A. Consider a [[circle]] of unit radius and center O. Let the arc PQ of the circle subtend an angle A at the center O. Drop the [[perpendicular]] QR from Q to OP; then the length of the line segment RQ is the  value of the trigonometric sine of the angle A. Let PS be an arc of the circle whose length is equal to the length of the segment RQ.  For various angles A, Madhava's  table gives the measures of the corresponding angles <math>\\angle</math>POS in [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]], [[arcsecond]]s and sixtieths of an [[arcsecond]].\n\nAs an example, let A be an angle whose measure is 22.50°. In Madhava's table, the entry corresponding to 22.50° is the measure in arcminutes, arcseconds and sixtieths of arcseconds of the angle whose radian measure is the modern value of sin 22.50°. The modern numerical value of sin 22.50° is 0.382683432363 and,\n\n:0.382683432363 radians = 180 / &pi; &times; 0.382683432363 degrees = 21.926145564094 degrees.\n\nand\n\n:21.926145564094 degrees = 1315 arcminutes  34 arcseconds   07 sixtieths of arcsecond.\n\nIn the [[Katapayadi system]] the digits are written in the reverse order. Thus in Madhava's table, the entry corresponding to 22.50° is 70435131.\n\n==Derivation of trigonometric sines from Madhava's table==\n\nFor an angle whose measure is  ''A'', let\n\n:<math>\\angle POS = m \\text{ arcminutes,  } s \\text{ arcseconds,  } t \\text{ sixtieths of an arcsecond}</math>\n\nThen\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin (A) & = RQ \\\\\n& = \\text{length of arc } PS \\\\\n& = \\angle POS \\text{ in radians}\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\pi}{180\\times 60}\\left( m + \\frac{s}{60}+ \\frac{t}{60\\times 60}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nEach of the lines in the table specifies eight digits. Let the digits corresponding to angle A (read from left to right) be\n\n:<math> d_1\\quad d_2\\quad d_3\\quad d_4\\quad d_5\\quad d_6\\quad d_7\\quad d_8 </math>\n\nThen according to the rules of the [[Katapayadi system]] of Kerala mathematicians we have\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nm & = d_8\\times 1000 + d_7\\times 100 + d_6 \\times 10 +d_5\\\\\ns & = d_4\\times 10 + d_3\\\\\nt & = d_2\\times 10 + d_1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n== Madhava's value of pi ==\n\nTo complete the numerical computations one must have a knowledge of the value of [[pi]] (<math>\\pi</math>). It is appropriate that we use the value of [[pi|&pi;]] computed by Madhava himself. [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] has given this value of π in his [[Āryabhaṭīya]]-Bhashya as follows:<ref name=\"Raju\"/>\n\n[[Image:Madhava value of pi.JPG|thumb|center|400px|Madhava's value of pi]]\n\nA transliteration of the last two lines:\n\n<poem>\n     vibudha-netra-gaja-ahi-hutāśana\n     tri-guṇa-veda-bha-vāraṇa-bāhavaḥ\n     nava-nikharva-mite vr̥tivistare\n     paridhi-mānam idaṁ jagadur budhāḥ\n</poem>\n\nThe various words indicate certain numbers encoded in a scheme known as the [[bhūtasaṃkhyā system]]. The meaning of the words and the numbers encoded by them (beginning with the units place) are detailed in the following translation of the verse: \n\"Gods (vibudha : 33), eyes (netra : 2), elephants (gaja : 8), snakes (ahi : 8), fires (hutāśana : 3), three (tri : 3), qualities (guṇa : 3), vedas (veda : 4), nakṣatras (bha : 27), elephants (vāraṇa : 8), and arms (bāhavaḥ : 2) - the wise say that this is the measure of the circumference when the diameter of a circle is nava-nikharva (900,000,000,000).\"\n\nSo, the translation of the poem using the [[bhūtasaṃkhyā system]] will simply read  \"2827433388233 is, as the wise say, the circumference of a circle whose diameter is nava-nikharva (900,000,000,000)\". That is, divide 2827433388233 (the number from the first two lines of the poem in reverse order) by nava-nikharva (900,000,000,000) to get the value of pi (π). This calculation yields the value π = 3.1415926535922. This is the value of π used by Madhava in his further calculations and is accurate to 11 decimal places.\n\n==Example==\n\nMadhava's table lists the following digits corresponding to the angle 45.00°:\n\n:<math>5\\quad 1\\quad 1\\quad 5\\quad 0\\quad 3\\quad 4\\quad 2</math>\n\nThis yields the angle with measure\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nm & = 2\\times 1000 + 4\\times 100 + 3\\times 10 + 0 \\text{ arcminutes}\\\\\n  & = 2430 \\text{ arcminutes} \\\\\ns & = 5\\times 10 + 1 \\text{ arcseconds}\\\\\n  & = 51 \\text{ arcseconds}\\\\\nt & = 1\\times 10 + 5 \\text{ sixtieths of an arcsecond}\\\\\n  & = 15 \\text{ sixtieths of an arcsecond}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe value of the trigonometric sine of 45.00° as given in Madhava's table is\n\n:<math>\n\\sin 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{180\\times 60}\\left( 2430 + \\frac{51}{60} + \\frac{15}{60\\times 60}\\right)\n</math>\n\nSubstituting the value of π computed by Madhava in the above expression, one gets sin 45° as 0.70710681.\n\nThis value may be compared with the modern exact value of sin 45.00°, namely, 0.70710678.\n\n== Comparison of Madhava's and modern sine values ==\nIn table below the first column contains the list of the twenty-four angles beginning with 3.75 and ending with 90.00. The second column contains the values tabulated by Madhava in [[Devanagari]] in the form in which it was given by Madhava. (These are taken from ''Malayalam Commentary of [[Karanapaddhati]]'' by P.K. Koru<ref>{{cite book|last=[[Puthumana Somayaji]]|title=[[Karanapaddhati]] (with a commentary in [[Malayalam]] by P.K. Koru)|publisher=Astro Printing and Publishing Company|location= [[Cherpu]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]}} (Published in 1953)</ref> and are slightly different from the table given in ''Cultural foundations of mathematics'' by C.K. Raju.<ref name=\"Raju\"/>)  The third column contains [[ISO 15919|ISO 15919 transliterations]] of the lines given in the second column. The digits encoded by the lines in second column are given in [[Arabic numeral]]s in the fourth column.

Here, the term ''parallax'' is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit.<ref>In the past [[#Diurnal parallax|diurnal parallax]] was also used to measure distances to celestial objects within the [[Solar System]]. This method has now been superseded by more accurate techniques.</ref> These distances form the lowest rung of what is called \"the [[cosmic distance ladder]]\", the first in a succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.\n\nParallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, [[binoculars]], [[microscope]]s, and [[twin-lens reflex camera]]s that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two [[human eye|eyes]] with overlapping [[visual perception|visual fields]] that use parallax to gain [[depth perception]]; this process is known as [[stereopsis]]. In [[computer vision]] the effect is used for [[computer stereo vision]], and there is a device called a [[Coincidence rangefinder|parallax rangefinder]] that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.\n\nA simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboard of motor vehicles that use a needle-style speedometer gauge. When viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly 60; but when viewed from the passenger seat the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed, due to the angle of viewing.\n\n== Visual perception ==\n{{main|stereopsis|depth perception|binocular vision|Binocular disparity}}\nAs the eyes of humans and other animals are in different positions on the head, they present different views simultaneously. This is the basis of [[stereopsis]], the process by which the brain exploits the parallax due to the different views from the eye to gain depth perception and estimate distances to objects.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Steinman | first=Scott B. | last2=Garzia | first2=Ralph Philip | date=2000 | title=Foundations of Binocular Vision: A Clinical perspective |  publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=978-0-8385-2670-5 | pages=2–5 | ref=harv | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Animals also use ''motion parallax'', in which the animals (or just the head) move to gain different viewpoints.

What is essential is relative motion. By observing parallax, [[measurement|measuring]] [[angle]]s, and using [[geometry]], one can determine [[distance]]. Astronomers also use the word \"parallax\" as a synonym for \"distance measurement\" by other methods: see [[parallax (disambiguation)#Astronomy]].\n\n=== Stellar parallax ===\n{{main|Stellar parallax}}\n\nStellar parallax created by the relative motion between the Earth and a [[star]] can be seen, in the Copernican model, as arising from the orbit of the Earth around the Sun: the star only ''appears'' to move relative to more distant objects in the sky. In a geostatic model, the movement of the star would have to be taken as ''real'' with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars.\n\nStellar parallax is most often measured using '''annual parallax''', defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i.&nbsp;e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The [[parsec]] (3.26 [[light-year]]s) is defined as the distance for which the annual parallax is 1&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]. Annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star at different times of the [[year]] as the Earth moves through its orbit. Measurement of annual parallax was the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. The first successful measurements of stellar parallax were made by [[Friedrich Bessel]] in 1838 for the star [[61 Cygni|61&nbsp;Cygni]] using a [[heliometer]].<ref name=ZG44>{{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998 | loc=p. 44}}.</ref> Stellar parallax remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods. Accurate calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, now based on [[radar]] reflection off the surfaces of planets.<ref>{{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998|loc=§ 22-3}}.</ref>\n\nThe angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult to measure.

It is clear from [[Euclid]]'s [[geometry]] that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of [[Tycho Brahe|Tycho]]'s principal objections to [[Copernican heliocentrism]] that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of [[Saturn]] (then the most distant known planet) and the eighth [[Celestial sphere|sphere]] (the fixed stars).<ref>See p.51 in ''The reception of Copernicus' heliocentric theory: proceedings of a symposium organized by the Nicolas Copernicus Committee of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science'', Torun, Poland, 1973, ed.

Thus, the careful measurement of the length of one baseline can fix the scale of an entire triangulation network. In parallax, the triangle is extremely long and narrow, and by measuring both its shortest side (the motion of the observer) and the small top angle (always less than 1 [[arcsecond]],<ref name=ZG44 /> leaving the other two close to 90 degrees), the length of the long sides (in practice considered to be equal) can be determined.\n\nAssuming the angle is small (see [[#Derivation|derivation]] below), the distance to an object (measured in [[parsec]]s) is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the parallax (measured in [[arcsecond]]s): <math>d (\\mathrm{pc}) = 1 / p (\\mathrm{arcsec}).</math> For example, the distance to [[Proxima Centauri]] is 1/0.7687={{convert|1.3009|pc|ly}}.<ref name=\"apj118\"/>\n\n=== Diurnal parallax ===\n''Diurnal parallax'' is a parallax that varies with rotation of the Earth or with difference of location on the Earth.

Instead of 'near star', read 'Moon', and instead of taking the circle at the bottom of the diagram to represent the size of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, take it to be the size of the Earth's globe, and of a circle around the Earth's surface. Then, the lunar (horizontal) parallax amounts to the difference in angular position, relative to the background of distant stars, of the Moon as seen from two different viewing positions on the Earth: one of the viewing positions is the place from which the Moon can be seen directly overhead at a given moment (that is, viewed along the vertical line in the diagram); and the other viewing position is a place from which the Moon can be seen on the horizon at the same moment (that is, viewed along one of the diagonal lines, from an Earth-surface position corresponding roughly to one of the blue dots on the modified diagram).\n\nThe lunar (horizontal) parallax can alternatively be defined as the angle subtended at the distance of the Moon by the radius of the Earth<ref>Astronomical Almanac, e.g. for 1981: see Glossary; for formulae see Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 1992, p.400</ref>—equal to angle p in the diagram when scaled-down and modified as mentioned above.\n\nThe lunar horizontal parallax at any time depends on the linear distance of the Moon from the Earth. The Earth–Moon linear distance varies continuously as the Moon follows its [[orbit of the moon|perturbed and approximately elliptical orbit]] around the Earth. The range of the variation in linear distance is from about 56 to 63.7 Earth radii, corresponding to horizontal parallax of about a degree of arc, but ranging from about 61.4' to about 54'.<ref name=aa1981>[[Astronomical Almanac]] e.g. for 1981, section D</ref> The [[Astronomical Almanac]] and similar publications tabulate the lunar horizontal parallax and/or the linear distance of the Moon from the Earth on a periodical e.g. daily basis for the convenience of astronomers (and of celestial navigators), and the study of the way in which this coordinate varies with time forms part of [[lunar theory]].\n\n[[File:Lunaparallax.png|thumb|410px|right|Diagram of daily lunar parallax]]\n\nParallax can also be used to determine the distance to the [[Moon]].\n\nOne way to determine the lunar parallax from one location is by using a lunar eclipse. A full shadow of the Earth on the Moon has an apparent radius of curvature equal to the difference between the apparent radii of the Earth and the Sun as seen from the Moon. This radius can be seen to be equal to 0.75 degree, from which (with the solar apparent radius 0.25 degree) we get an Earth apparent radius of 1 degree.

It also illustrates the important point that parallax need not be caused by any motion of the observer, contrary to some definitions of parallax that say it is, but may arise purely from motion of the observed.\n\nAnother method is to take two pictures of the Moon at exactly the same time from two locations on Earth and compare the positions of the Moon relative to the stars. Using the orientation of the Earth, those two position measurements, and the distance between the two locations on the Earth, the distance to the Moon can be triangulated:\n:<math>\\mathrm{distance}_{\\mathrm{moon}} = \\frac {\\mathrm{distance}_{\\mathrm{observerbase}}} {\\tan (\\mathrm{angle})}</math>\n\n[[File:Lunarparallax 22 3 1988.png|thumb|right|Example of lunar parallax: Occultation of Pleiades by the Moon]]\n\nThis is the method referred to by [[Jules Verne]] in ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'': <blockquote>Until then, many people had no idea how one could calculate the distance separating the Moon from the Earth. The circumstance was exploited to teach them that this distance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the Moon. If the word parallax appeared to amaze them, they were told that it was the angle subtended by two straight lines running from both ends of the Earth's radius to the Moon. If they had doubts on the perfection of this method, they were immediately shown that not only did this mean distance amount to a whole two hundred thirty-four thousand three hundred and forty-seven miles (94,330 leagues), but also that the astronomers were not in error by more than seventy miles (≈ 30 leagues).</blockquote>\n\n=== Solar parallax ===\nAfter [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] proposed his [[heliocentric system]], with the Earth in revolution around the Sun, it was possible to build a model of the whole Solar System without scale. To ascertain the scale, it is necessary only to measure one distance within the Solar System, e.g., the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun (now called an [[astronomical unit]], or AU). When found by [[triangulation]], this is referred to as the ''solar parallax'', the difference in position of the Sun as seen from the Earth's centre and a point one Earth radius away, i.&nbsp;e., the angle subtended at the Sun by the Earth's mean radius. Knowing the solar parallax and the mean Earth radius allows one to calculate the AU, the first, small step on the long road of establishing the size and [[Age of the Universe|expansion age]]<ref>{{cite journal | author=Freedman, W.L. | title=The Hubble constant and the expansion age of the Universe | journal=Physics Reports  | date=2000 | volume=333 | issue=1 | pages=13–31 | bibcode=2000PhR...333...13F | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00013-2 | ref=harv | arxiv=astro-ph/9909076}}</ref> of the visible Universe.\n\nA primitive way to determine the distance to the Sun in terms of the distance to the Moon was already proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in his book ''[[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]''. He noted that the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a right triangle (with the right angle at the Moon) at the moment of [[lunar phase|first or last quarter moon]]. He then estimated that the Moon, Earth, Sun angle was 87°. Using correct [[geometry]] but inaccurate observational data, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was slightly less than 20 times farther away than the Moon. The true value of this angle is close to 89° 50', and the Sun is actually about 390 times farther away.<ref name=Gutzwiller/> He pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal [[angle|apparent angular sizes]] and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth. He thus concluded that the Sun was around 20 times larger than the Moon; this conclusion, although incorrect, follows logically from his incorrect data. It does suggest that the Sun is clearly larger than the Earth, which could be taken to support the heliocentric model.<ref>{{citation|title=Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arabic Science|first=Jim|last=Al-Khalili|publisher=Penguin UK|date=2010|isbn=9780141965017|page=270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntLEUHTXxUMC&pg=PT270|quote=Some have suggested that his calculation of the relative size of the earth and sun led Aristarchus to conclude that it made more sense for the earth to be moving around the much larger sun than the other way round.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317231828/http://books.google.com/books?id=ntLEUHTXxUMC&pg=PT270|archivedate=2015-03-17|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venus Transit & Parallax.svg|thumb|right|Measuring Venus transit times to determine solar parallax]]\n\nAlthough Aristarchus' results were incorrect due to observational errors, they were based on correct geometric principles of parallax, and became the basis for estimates of the size of the Solar System for almost 2000 years, until the [[transit of Venus]] was correctly observed in 1761 and 1769.<ref name=Gutzwiller/> This method was proposed by [[Edmond Halley]] in 1716, although he did not live to see the results. The use of Venus transits was less successful than had been hoped due to the [[black drop effect]], but the resulting estimate, 153 million kilometers, is just 2% above the currently accepted value, 149.6 million kilometers.\n\nMuch later, the Solar System was \"scaled\" using the parallax of [[asteroid]]s, some of which, such as [[433 Eros|Eros]], pass much closer to Earth than Venus.

However this error in the measured parallax angle does not translate directly into an error for the distance, except for relatively small errors.

The approximation is far more accurate for parallax errors that are small relative to the parallax than for relatively large errors.

Then, eventfields in spacetime can be deduced directly without intermediate models of light bending by massive bodies such as the one used in the [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|PPN formalism]] for instance.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rubin, J.L. | title=Relativistic Pentametric Coordinates from Relativistic Localizing Systems and the Projective Geometry of the Spacetime Manifold | journal=Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics | date=2015 | volume=12 | issue=32 | pages=83–112 | url=http://www.ejtp.com/volumes.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208153753/http://www.ejtp.com/volumes.html | archivedate=2015-02-08 | df= }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor|Parallax error}}Metrology ==\n[[File:Parallax pointer error.PNG|thumb|The correct line of sight needs to be used to avoid parallax error.]]\nMeasurements made by viewing the position of some marker relative to something to be measured are subject to parallax error if the marker is some distance away from the object of measurement and not viewed from the correct position. For example, if measuring the distance between two ticks on a line with a ruler marked on its top surface, the thickness of the ruler will separate its markings from the ticks. If viewed from a position not exactly perpendicular to the ruler, the apparent position will shift and the reading will be less accurate than the ruler is capable of.\n\nA similar error occurs when reading the position of a pointer against a scale in an instrument such as an analog [[multimeter]]. To help the user avoid this problem, the scale is sometimes printed above a narrow strip of [[mirror]], and the user's eye is positioned so that the pointer obscures its own reflection, guaranteeing that the user's line of sight is perpendicular to the mirror and therefore to the scale. The same effect alters the speed read on a car's speedometer by a driver in front of it and a passenger off to the side, values read from a [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] not in actual contact with the display on an [[oscilloscope]], etc.\n\nThe newest [[iPhone]] includes an app that allows measuring distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-behind-the-magical-parallax-effect-running-your-ar-apps/|title=The Physics behind the magical parallax effect running your AR apps|archivedate=2017-01-28|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Photogrammetry ==\nAerial picture pairs, when viewed through a stereo viewer, offer a pronounced stereo effect of landscape and buildings. High buildings appear to 'keel over' in the direction away from the centre of the photograph. Measurements of this parallax are used to deduce the height of the buildings, provided that flying height and baseline distances are known. This is a key component to the process of [[photogrammetry]].\n\n== Photography ==\n[[File:Contax III IMG 5349-white.JPG|thumb|Contax III rangefinder camera with [[macro photography]] setting.

In such cameras, the eye sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder, or a second lens) than the one through which the photo is taken. As the viewfinder is often found above the lens of the camera, photos with parallax error are often slightly lower than intended, the classic example being the image of person with his or her head cropped off. This problem is addressed in [[single-lens reflex camera]]s, in which the viewfinder sees through the same lens through which the photo is taken (with the aid of a movable mirror), thus avoiding parallax error.\n\nParallax is also an issue in [[image stitching]], such as for panoramas.\n\n==Weapon sights==\nParallax affects [[sight (device)|sighting devices]] of [[ranged weapon]]s in many ways.  On sights fitted on [[small arms]] and [[Bow and arrow|bows]], etc. the perpendicular distance between the sight and the weapon's launch axis (e.g. the [[bore axis]] of a gun) — generally referred to as \"''sight height''\" — can induce significant aiming errors when shooting at close range, particularly when shooting at small targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dexadine.com/bexhelp/bexhelp23.htm|title=Ballistic Explorer Help|website=www.dexadine.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025148/http://www.dexadine.com/bexhelp/bexhelp23.htm|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}</ref>  This parallax error is compensated for (when needed) via calculations that also take in other variables such as [[bullet drop]], [[windage]], and the distance at which the target is expected to be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossbowmen.com/index.htm.trajectory.html|title=Crossbows / Arrows & Bolts / Trajectory / Trajectories.|website=www.crossbowmen.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708205657/http://www.crossbowmen.com/index.htm.trajectory.html|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}</ref>  Sight height can be used to advantage when \"sighting-in\" rifles for field use.

This is because when the reticle and the target are not at the same focus, the optically corresponded distances being projected through the [[eyepiece]] are also different, and the user's eye will register the difference in parallaxes between the reticle and the target (whenever eye position changes) as a relative displacement on top of each other.

Many low-tier telescopic sights may have no parallax compensation because in practice they can still perform very acceptably without eliminating parallax shift, in which case the scope is often set fixed at a designated parallax-free distance that best suits their intended usage.  Typical standard factory parallax-free distances for hunting scopes are 100&nbsp;yd (or 100&nbsp;m) to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300&nbsp;yd/m.  Some competition and military-style scopes without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300&nbsp;yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Scopes for guns with shorter practical ranges, such as [[airguns]], [[rimfire rifle]]s, [[shotgun]]s and [[muzzleloader]]s, will have parallax settings for shorter distances, commonly 50&nbsp;yd/m for rimfire scopes and 100&nbsp;yd/m for shotguns and muzzleloaders.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Airgun scopes are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually in the form of an adjustable objective (or \"AO\" for short) design, and may adjust down to as near as {{convert|3|yd|m|abbr=off}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nNon-magnifying [[Reflector sight|reflector or \"reflex\" sights]] have the ability to be theoretically \"parallax free.\" But since these sights use parallel [[collimated light]] this is only true when the target is at infinity.

The apparent displacement, or difference of position, of an object, as seen from two different stations, or points of view. In contemporary writing parallax can also be the same story, or a similar story from approximately the same time line, from one book told from a different perspective in another book. The word and concept feature prominently in [[James Joyce]]'s 1922 novel, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. [[Orson Scott Card]] also used the term when referring to [[Ender's Shadow]] as compared to [[Ender's Game]].\n\nThe metaphor is invoked by Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] in his work ''[[The Parallax View (book)|The Parallax View]]'', borrowing the concept of \"parallax view\" from the Japanese philosopher and literary critic [[Kojin Karatani]]. Žižek notes,\n{{Quote|text=The philosophical twist to be added (to parallax), of course, is that the observed distance is not simply subjective, since the same object that exists 'out there' is seen from two different stances, or points of view. It is rather that, as [[Hegel]] would have put it, subject and object are inherently mediated so that an '[[epistemological]]' shift in the subject's point of view always reflects an [[ontological]] shift in the object itself. Or—to put it in [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanese]]—the subject's gaze is always-already inscribed into the perceived object itself, in the guise of its 'blind spot,' that which is 'in the object more than object itself', the point from which the object itself returns the gaze.

The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re-inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In [[angle notation]], the operation shown above is written\n:<math>A_1 \\angle \\theta_1 + A_2 \\angle \\theta_2 = A_3 \\angle \\theta_3. \\, </math>\n\nAnother way to view addition is that two '''vectors''' with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub> cos(''ωt'' + ''θ''<sub>1</sub>), ''A''<sub>1</sub> sin(''ωt'' + ''θ''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;]}} and {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>2</sub> cos(''ωt'' + ''θ''<sub>2</sub>), ''A''<sub>2</sub> sin(''ωt'' + ''θ''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;]}} are [[vector (geometric)#Vector addition and subtraction|added vectorially]] to produce a resultant vector with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>3</sub> cos(''ωt'' + ''θ''<sub>3</sub>), ''A''<sub>3</sub> sin(''ωt'' + ''θ''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;]}}. (see animation)\n\n[[Image:destructive interference.png|thumb|right|Phasor diagram of three waves in perfect destructive interference]]\nIn physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other, constructively or destructively.  The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: \"''What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?''\" In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail.  Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral [[triangle]], so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120° ({{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;radians), or one third of a wavelength {{frac|{{var|λ}}|3}}. So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120°, as is the case in [[three-phase power]]\n\nIn other words, what this shows is that\n:<math>\\cos(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + \\cos(\\omega t -2\\pi/3) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIn the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240&nbsp;degrees, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180 degrees. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength <math>\\lambda</math>. This is why in single slit [[diffraction]], the minima occur when [[light]] from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge.\n\nAs the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360° or 2{{pi}}&nbsp;radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0°, 180°, and at 360°.\n\nLikewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, (&nbsp;+''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 90° or {{frac|{{pi}}|2}} and the negative peak value, (&nbsp;&minus;''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 270° or {{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represent a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is “frozen” at some point in time, (&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;) and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30°.\n\nSometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians.\n\nBut if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, {{var|Φ}} of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Circuit laws ===\n\nWith phasors, the techniques for solving [[Direct current|DC]] circuits can be applied to solve AC circuits.  A list of the basic laws is given below.\n\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors:''' a resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn't change the phase of a signal therefore ''V''=''IR'' remains valid.\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors:''' ''V''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''IZ'' where ''Z'' is the complex [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. <!-- we probably want a justification of this somewhere-->\n* In an AC circuit we have real power (''P'') which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (''Q'') which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the [[complex power]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''jQ'' and the apparent power which is the magnitude of ''S''. The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''VI''<sup>*</sup> (where ''I''<sup>*</sup> is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''I'', and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors ''V'' and ''I'' are the [[Root mean square#Definition|RMS]] values of the voltage and current, respectively).\n* [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] work with phasors in complex form\n\nGiven this we can apply the techniques of [[analysis of resistive circuits]] with phasors to analyze single frequency AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the [[superposition theorem]].\n\n===Power engineering===\nIn analysis of [[three phase]] AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of [[symmetrical components]]. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s, and the magnitude in [[Root Mean Square|rms]] value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid.\n\nThe technique of [[synchrophasor]]s uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network.  Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability.\n\n=== Telecommunications: analog modulations ===\n\nThe rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as [[amplitude modulation]] (and its variants <ref name=IJRES>de Oliveira, H.M. and Nunes, F.D.

Both methods involve taking [[azimuth]]s or [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] to two or more objects, then drawing ''lines of position'' along those recorded bearings or azimuths.\n\nWhen intersecting, lines of position are used to fix the position of an unmapped feature or point by fixing its position relative to two (or more) mapped or known points, the method is known as ''intersection''.<ref>Mooers, pp. 129&ndash;132</ref> At each known point (hill, lighthouse, etc.), the navigator measures the bearing to the same unmapped target, drawing a line on the map from each known position to the target. The target is located where the lines intersect on the map. In earlier times, the ''intersection'' method was used by forest agencies and others using specialized [[Osborne Fire Finder|alidades]] to plot the (unknown) location of an observed forest fire from two or more mapped (known) locations, such as forest fire observer towers.<ref>Mooers, pp. 130&ndash;131</ref>\n\nThe reverse of the ''intersection'' technique is appropriately termed ''resection''. Resection simply reverses the intersection process by using ''crossed back bearings'', where the navigator's position is the unknown.<ref>Mooers, p. 132&ndash;133</ref> Two or more bearings to mapped, known points are taken; their resultant lines of position drawn from those points to where they intersect will reveal the navigator's location.<ref>Mooers, p. 132&ndash;133</ref>\n\n==In navigation==\n{{broader|Position fixing}}\nWhen resecting or fixing a position, the geometric strength (angular disparity) of the mapped points affects the precision and accuracy of the outcome. Accuracy increases as the angle between the two position lines approaches 90 degrees.<ref>Seidman, David, and Cleveland, Paul, ''The Essential Wilderness Navigator'', Ragged Mountain Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-07-136110-3}}, p. 100</ref> Magnetic bearings are observed on the ground from the point under location to two or more features shown on a map of the area.<ref>Mooers, pp. 129&ndash;134</ref><ref>Kals, pp. 43&ndash;49</ref> Lines of reverse bearings, or ''lines of position'', are then drawn on the map from the known features; two and more lines provide the resection point (the navigator's location).<ref>Mooers, pp. 129&ndash;134</ref> When three or more lines of position are utilized, the method is often popularly (though erroneously) referred to as [[triangulation]] (in precise terms, using three or more lines of position is still correctly called ''resection'', as angular [[law of tangents]] ([[cotangent|cot]]) calculations are not performed).<ref>Touche, Fred, ''Wilderness Navigation Handbook'', Fred Touche (2004), {{ISBN|978-0-9732527-0-5}}, {{ISBN|0-9732527-0-7}}, pp. 60&ndash;67</ref> When using a map and compass to perform resection, it is important to allow for the difference between the magnetic bearings observed and grid north (or true north) bearings ([[magnetic north|magnetic declination]]) of the map or chart.<ref>Mooers, p. 133</ref>\n\nResection continues to be employed in land and inshore navigation today, as it is a simple and quick method requiring only an inexpensive magnetic compass and map/chart.<ref>Mooers, pp. 129&ndash;134</ref><ref>Kals, pp. 43&ndash;49</ref><ref>Touche, pp. 60&ndash;67</ref>\n\n==In surveying==\n{{distinguish-redirect|Resection (surveying)|Free stationing}}\n{{see also|Triangulation (surveying)}}\n\nIn surveying work,<ref>Glossary of the Mapping Sciences, American Society of Civil Engineers, page 451.

For the type of precision work involved in surveying, the unmapped point is located by measuring the angles subtended by lines of sight from it to a minimum of three mapped (coordinated) points. In [[geodesy|geodetic]] operations the observations are adjusted for [[spherical excess]] and [[projection variation]]s. Precise angular measurements between lines from the point under location using [[theodolite]]s provides more accurate results, with trig beacons erected on high points and hills to enable quick and unambiguous sights to known points.\nWhen planning to perform a resection, the surveyor must first plot the locations of the known points along with the approximate unknown point of observation. If all points, including the unknown point, lie close to a circle that can be placed on all four points, then there is no solution or the high risk of an erroneous solution. This is known as observing on the \"danger circle\". The poor solution stems from the property of a chord subtending equal angles to any other point on the circle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hand compass]]\n* [[Orienteering compass]]\n* [[Real time locating]]\n* [[Orienteering]]\n* [[Hansen's problem]]\n* [[Solving triangles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Mooers Jr., Robert L., ''Finding Your Way In The Outdoors'', Outdoor Life Press (1972), {{ISBN|0-943822-41-6}}\n* Kals, W.S., Practical Navigation, New York: Doubleday & Co.

For the 25 years preceding the invention of the [[logarithm]] in 1614, it was the only known generally applicable way of approximating products quickly. Its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''prosthesis'' (πρόσθεσις) and ''aphaeresis'' (ἀφαίρεσις), meaning addition and subtraction, two steps in the process.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pierce, R.

These voluminous charts prepared by [[astronomer]]s detailed the position of stars and planets at various points in time. The models used to compute these were based on [[spherical trigonometry]], which relates the angles and [[arc length]]s of spherical triangles (see diagram, right) using formulas such as:\n\n:<math>\\cos a = \\cos b \\cos c + \\sin b \\sin c \\cos \\alpha</math>\nand\n:<math>\\sin b \\sin \\alpha = \\sin a \\sin \\beta</math>\n\nwhere ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are the angles [[Subtended angle|subtended]] at the centre of the sphere by the corresponding arcs.\n\nWhen one quantity in such a formula is unknown but the others are known, the unknown quantity can be computed using a series of multiplications, divisions, and trigonometric table lookups. Astronomers had to make thousands of such calculations, and because the best method of multiplication available was [[Multiplication algorithm#Long multiplication|long multiplication]], most of this time was spent taxingly multiplying out products.\n\nMathematicians, particularly those who were also astronomers, were looking for an easier way, and trigonometry was one of the most advanced and familiar fields to these people. Prosthaphaeresis appeared in the 1580s, but its originator is not known for certain; its contributors included the mathematicians [[Ibn Yunis]], [[Johannes Werner]], [[Paul Wittich]], [[Joost Bürgi]], [[Christopher Clavius]], and [[François Viète]]. Wittich, Yunis, and Clavius were all astronomers and have all been credited by various sources with discovering the method. Its most well-known proponent was [[Tycho Brahe]], who used it extensively for astronomical calculations such as those described above. It was also used by [[John Napier]], who is credited with inventing the logarithms that would supplant it.\n\n[[Nicholas Copernicus]] mentions 'prosthaphaeresis' several times in his 1543 work ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium]]'', meaning the \"great parallax\" caused by the displacement of the observer due to the Earth's annual motion.\n\n== The identities ==\nThe [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] exploited by prosthaphaeresis relate products of [[trigonometric function]]s to sums. They include the following:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin a \\sin b & = \\frac{\\cos(a - b) - \\cos(a + b)}{2} \\\\[6pt]\n\\cos a \\cos b & = \\frac{\\cos(a - b) + \\cos(a + b)}{2} \\\\[6pt]\n\\sin a \\cos b & = \\frac{\\sin(a + b) + \\sin(a - b)}{2} \\\\[6pt]\n\\cos a \\sin b & = \\frac{\\sin(a + b) - \\sin(a - b)}{2}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe first two of these are believed to have been derived by [[Jost Bürgi]],{{fact|date=February 2018}} who related them to [Tycho?] Brahe;{{fact|date=February 2018}} the others follow easily from these two. If both sides are multiplied by 2, these formulas are also called the '''Werner formulas'''.\n\n== The algorithm ==\nUsing the second formula above, the technique for multiplication of two numbers works as follows:\n# '''Scale down''': By shifting the decimal point to the left or right, scale both numbers to values between <math> -1 </math> and <math> 1 </math>, to be referred to as <math> \\cos \\alpha </math> and <math> \\cos \\beta </math>.\n# '''Inverse cosine''': Using an inverse cosine table, find two angles <math>  \\alpha </math> and <math> \\beta </math> whose cosines are our two values.\n# '''Sum and difference''': Find the sum and difference of the two angles.\n# '''Average the cosines''': Find the cosines of the sum and difference angles using a cosine table and average them, giving (according to the second formula above) the product <math> \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta </math>.\n# '''Scale up''': Shift the decimal place in the answer the combined number of places we have shifted the decimal in the first step for each input, but in the opposite direction.\n\nFor example, say we want to multiply <math>105</math> and <math>720</math>. Following the steps:\n# '''Scale down''': Shift the decimal point three places to the left in each. We get <math> \\cos \\alpha = 0.105  </math> and <math> \\cos \\beta = 0.720 </math>.\n# '''Inverse cosine''': <math> \\cos84^\\circ </math> is about 0.105 and <math> \\cos44^\\circ </math> is about <math> 0.720 </math>.\n# '''Sum and difference''': <math> 84 + 44 = 128</math> and <math> 84 - 44 = 40</math>.\n# '''Average the cosines''': <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\cos128^\\circ + \\cos40^\\circ) </math> is about <math> \\tfrac{1}{2}(-0.616 + 0.766)</math> , or <math>0.075 </math>.\n# '''Scale up''': For each of <math>105</math> and <math>720</math> we shifted the decimal point three places to the left, so in the answer we shift six places to the right. The result is <math>75,000</math>. This is very close to the actual product, <math> 75,600</math> (a [[percent error]] of ≈0.8%).\n\nIf we want the product of the cosines of the two initial values, which is useful in some of the astronomical calculations mentioned above, this is surprisingly even easier: only steps 3 and 4 above are necessary.\n\nTo divide, we exploit the definition of the secant as the reciprocal of the cosine. To divide <math> 3500</math> by <math> 70 </math>, we scale the numbers to <math> 0.35 </math> and <math> 7.0 </math>. The cosine of <math> 69.5^\\circ </math> is <math> 0.35</math> . Then use a table of [[Trigonometric function|secant]]s to find out that <math> 7.0 </math> is the secant of <math> 81.8^\\circ </math>. This means that <math> 1/7.0 </math> is the cosine of <math> 81.8^\\circ </math>, and so we can multiply <math> 0.35</math> by <math> 1/7.0 </math> using the above procedure. Average the cosine of the sum of the angles, <math> 81.8^\\circ+69.5^\\circ=151.3^\\circ </math>, with the cosine of their difference, <math> 81.8^\\circ-69.5^\\circ=12.3^\\circ </math>\n: <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\cos151^\\circ + \\cos 12.3^\\circ) </math> is about <math> \\tfrac{1}{2}(-0.877 + 0.977) </math>, or <math> 0.050 </math>\nScaling up to locate the decimal point gives the approximate answer, <math> 50 </math>\n\nAlgorithms using the other formulas are similar, but each using different tables (sine, inverse sine, cosine, and inverse cosine) in different places. The first two are the easiest because they each only require two tables. Using the second formula, however, has the unique advantage that if only a cosine table is available, it can be used to estimate inverse cosines by searching for the angle with the nearest cosine value.\n\nNotice how similar the above algorithm is to the process for multiplying using logarithms, which follows these steps: scale down, take logarithms, add, take inverse logarithm, scale up. It's no surprise that the originators of logarithms had used prosthaphaeresis.\nIndeed the two are closely related mathematically. In modern terms, prosthaphaeresis can be viewed as relying on the logarithm of complex numbers, in particular on [[Euler's formula]]:\n:<math>e^{ix}=\\cos x + i \\sin x</math>\n\n== Decreasing the error ==\n\nIf all the operations are performed with high precision, the product can be as accurate as desired. Although sums, differences, and averages are easy to compute with high precision, even by hand, trigonometric functions and especially inverse trigonometric functions are not. For this reason, the accuracy of the method depends to a large extent on the accuracy and detail of the trigonometric tables used.\n\nFor example, a sine table with an entry for each degree can be off by as much as 0.0087 if we just [[Nearest-neighbor interpolation|round an angle off to the nearest degree]]; each time we double the size of the table (for example by giving entries for every half-degree instead of every degree) we halve this error. Tables were painstakingly constructed for prosthaphaeresis with values for every second, or 3600th of a degree.\n\nInverse sine and cosine functions are particularly troublesome, because they become steep near −1 and 1. One solution is to include more table values in this area. Another is to scale the inputs to numbers between −0.9 and 0.9. For example, 950 would become 0.095 instead of 0.950.\n\nAnother effective approach to enhancing the accuracy is [[linear interpolation]], which chooses a value between two adjacent table values. For example, if we know the sine of 45° is about 0.707 and the sine of 46° is about 0.719, we can estimate the sine of 45.7° as 0.707 &times; (1 − 0.7) + 0.719 &times; 0.7 = 0.7154.\n\nThe actual sine is 0.7157. A table of cosines with only 180 entries combined with linear interpolation is as accurate as a table with about 45000 entries without it. Even a quick estimate of the interpolated value is often much closer than the nearest table value. See [[lookup table]] for more details.\n\n== Reverse identities ==\n\nThe product formulas can also be manipulated to obtain formulas that express addition in terms of multiplication. Although less useful for computing products, these are still useful for deriving trigonometric results:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin a + \\sin b & = 2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{a + b}{2} \\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{a - b}{2} \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n\\sin a - \\sin b & = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{a + b}{2} \\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{a - b}{2} \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n\\cos a + \\cos b & = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{a + b}{2} \\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{a - b}{2} \\right) \\\\[5pt]\n\\cos a - \\cos b & = -2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{a + b}{2} \\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{a - b}{2} \\right)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Slide rule#Modern form|Slide rule]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://planetmath.org/prosthaphaeresisformulas Prosthaphaeresis formulas]\n* Daniel E.

Along with the [[trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|sum-of-angles formulae]], it is one of the basic relations between the [[sine]] and [[cosine]] functions.\n\nThe identity is\n:<math>\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1.</math> \n\nAs usual, {{math|sin<sup>2</sup> ''θ''}} means <math display=\"inline\">(\\sin\\theta)^2</math>.\n\n==Proofs and their relationships to the Pythagorean theorem==\n\n[[File:Trig functions.svg|thumb |Similar right triangles showing sine and cosine of angle θ]]\n\n===Proof based on right-angle triangles===\n\nAny  [[similar triangles]] have the property that if we select the same angle in all of them, the ratio of the two sides defining the angle is the same regardless of which similar triangle is selected, regardless of its actual size: the ratios depend upon the three angles, not the lengths of the sides. Thus for either of the similar right triangles in the figure, the ratio of its horizontal side to its hypotenuse is the same, namely cos θ.\n\nThe elementary definitions of the sine and cosine functions in terms of the sides of a right triangle are:\n\n:<math>\\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\mathrm{opposite}}{\\mathrm{hypotenuse}}= \\frac{b}{c}</math>\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathrm{adjacent}}{\\mathrm{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{a}{c} </math>\n\nThe Pythagorean identity follows by squaring both definitions above, and adding; the [[left-hand side]] of the identity then becomes\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{opposite}^2 + \\mathrm{adjacent}^2}{\\mathrm{hypotenuse}^2}</math>\n\nwhich by the Pythagorean theorem is equal to 1.  This definition is valid for all angles, due to the definition of defining <math>x = \\cos \\theta </math> and <math> y = \\sin \\theta </math> for the unit circle and thus <math>x = c\\cos \\theta </math> and <math> y = c\\sin \\theta </math> for a circle of radius c and reflecting our triangle in the y axis and setting <math> a=x </math> and <math> b=y </math>.\n\nAlternatively, the identities found at [[trigonometric identity#Symmetry, shifts, and periodicity|Trigonometric symmetry, shifts, and periodicity]] may be employed. By the periodicity identities we can say if the formula is true for {{nowrap|−π < ''θ'' ≤ π}} then it is true for all real ''θ''. Next we prove the range {{nowrap|π/2 < ''θ'' ≤ π,}} to do this we let {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} ''θ'' − π/2,}} ''t'' will now be in the range {{nowrap|0 < ''t'' ≤ π/2.}} We can then make use of squared versions of some basic shift identities (squaring conveniently removes the minus signs):\n\n: <math>\\sin^2\\theta+\\cos^2\\theta = \\sin^2\\left(t+\\frac{1}{2}\\pi\\right) + \\cos^2\\left(t+\\frac{1}{2}\\pi\\right) = \\cos^2t+\\sin^2t = 1.</math>\n\nAll that remains is to prove it for {{nowrap|−π < ''θ'' < 0;}} this can be done by squaring the symmetry identities to get\n\n: <math>\\sin^2\\theta=\\sin^2(-\\theta)\\text{ and }\\cos^2\\theta=\\cos^2(-\\theta).</math>\n\n====Related identities====\n\n[[File:Trig functions2.svg|thumb|Similar right triangles illustrating the tangent and secant trigonometric functions.]]\nThe identities\n\n:<math>1 + \\tan^2 \\theta = \\sec^2 \\theta</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>1 + \\cot^2 \\theta = \\csc^2 \\theta</math>\n\nare also called Pythagorean trigonometric identities.<ref name= Leff/> If one leg of a right triangle has length&nbsp;1, then the tangent of the angle adjacent to that leg is the length of the other leg, and the secant of the angle is the length of the hypotenuse.\n:<math> \\tan \\theta =\\frac{b}{a} \\ , </math>\nand:\n:<math> \\sec \\theta = \\frac{c}{a} \\ . </math>\n\nIn this way, this trigonometric identity involving the tangent and the secant follows from the Pythagorean theorem.

Point ''P'' has a positive ''y''-coordinate, and  sin''θ'' = sin(π−''θ'' ) > 0. As ''θ'' increases from zero to the full circle ''θ'' = 2π, the sine and cosine change signs in the various quadrants to keep ''x'' and ''y'' with the correct signs. The figure shows how the sign of the sine function varies as the angle changes quadrant.\n\nBecause the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are perpendicular, this Pythagorean identity is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem for triangles with hypotenuse of length 1 (which is in turn equivalent to the full Pythagorean theorem by applying a similar-triangles argument).

The identity is equivalent to the assertion that the function\n\n:<math>z = \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x</math>\n\nis constant and equal to 1.

A calculation confirms that ''z''(0) = 1, and ''z'' is a constant so ''z'' = 1 for all ''x'', so the Pythagorean identity is established.\n\nA similar proof can be completed using power series as above to establish that the sine has as its derivative the cosine, and the cosine has as its derivative the negative sine. In fact, the definitions by ordinary differential equation and by power series lead to similar derivations of most identities.\n\nThis proof of the identity has no direct connection with Euclid's demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pythagorean theorem]]\n*[[List of trigonometric identities]]\n*[[Unit circle]]\n*[[Power series]]\n*[[Differential equation]]\n\n==In-line notes and references==\n<references/>\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pythagorean Trigonometric Identity}}\n[[Category:Mathematical identities]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Trigonometry]]\n[[Category:Pythagorean theorem|Identity]]\n\n[[ar:متطابقة فيثاغورث]]\n[[pt:Identidade trigonométrica fundamental]]"

[[Distance]] is replaced with its squared value ('''quadrance''') and '[[angle]]' is replaced with the squared value of the usual [[sine]] ratio ('''spread''') associated to either angle between two lines. (The [[Angle#complementary angle|complement]] of Spread, known as '''cross''', also corresponds to a scaled form of the [[inner product]] between line segments taken as [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s). The three main laws in trigonometry – [[Pythagoras's theorem]], the [[sine law]] and the [[cosine law]] – are given in rational (square-equivalent) form, and are augmented by two further laws – the [[#Triple quad formula|triple quad formula]] (relating the quadrances of three collinear points) and the [[#Triple spread formula|triple spread formula]] (relating the spreads of three concurrent lines) –, giving the [[#Laws of rational trigonometry|five main laws]] of the subject.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nRational trigonometry is otherwise broadly based on Cartesian analytic geometry, with ''a point'' defined as an ordered pair of [[rational number]]s\n:<math>(x,y)</math>\n\nand ''a line'' \n:<math>ax + by + c = 0,</math>\n\nas a general [[linear equation]] with rational coefficients {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}}.\n\nBy avoiding calculations that rely on [[square root]] operations giving only ''approximate'' distances between points, or standard trigonometric functions (and their inverses), giving only truncated [[polynomial]] ''approximations'' of angles (or their projections) geometry becomes entirely algebraic. There is no assumption, in other words, of the existence of [[real number]] solutions to problems, with results instead given over the field of rational numbers, their [[algebraic field extension]]s, or [[finite field]]s. Following this, it is claimed, makes many [[Mathematical theorem|classical results]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] applicable in ''rational'' form (as quadratic analogs) over any field not of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] two.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe book ''Divine Proportions'' shows the application of calculus using rational trigonometric functions, including three-dimensional volume calculations. It also deals with rational trigonometry's application to situations involving irrationals, such as the proof that Platonic Solids all have rational 'spreads' between their faces.<ref group=\"nb\">See ''Divine Proportions'' for numerous examples of calculus done with rational trigonometric functions, as well as problems involving the application of rational trigonometry to situations containing irrationals.</ref>\n\n==Notability and criticism==\nRational trigonometry (''RT'') is mentioned in only a modest number of mathematical publications besides Wildberger's own articles and book. ''Divine Proportions'' was dismissed by reviewer Paul J. Campbell, in the ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA): \"the author claims that this new theory will take 'less than half the usual time to learn'; but I doubt it. and it would still have to be interfaced with the traditional concepts and notation.\" Reviewer William Barker, Isaac Henry Wing Professor of Mathematics at [[Bowdoin College]], also writing for the MAA, was more approving: \"''Divine Proportions'' is unquestionably a valuable addition to the mathematics literature. It carefully develops a thought provoking, clever, and useful alternate approach to trigonometry and Euclidean geometry. It would not be surprising if some of its methods ultimately seep into the standard development of these subjects. However, unless there is an unexpected shift in the accepted views of the foundations of mathematics, there is not a strong case for rational trigonometry to replace the classical theory\" <ref>http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/divine-proportions-rational-trigonometry-to-universal-geometry</ref> ''[[New Scientist]]'''s Amanda Gefter described the approach of Wildberger as an example of [[finitism]].<ref name=\"Gefter1\"/> [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] in the ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' argued that the book deserved careful consideration.<ref>J. Franklin, [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/wildbergerrev.pdf Review of ''Divine Proportions''], ''Mathematical Intelligencer'' 28 (3) (2006), 73-4.</ref>\n\nAn analysis by Michael Gilsdorf of the example problems given by Wildberger in an early paper disputed the claim that ''RT'' required fewer steps to solve ''most'' problems, if free selection of classical methods (such as the '[[shoelace formula]]' for the area of a triangle from the coordinates of its vertices or applying a [[Apollonius's theorem|special case of Stewart's theorem]] directly to a triangle with a median) is allowed to optimize the solution of problems. Concerning pedagogy, and whether using the quadratic quantities introduced by ''RT'' offers real benefits over traditional learning, the author observed that classical trigonometry was not initially based on use of [[Taylor series]] to approximate angles at all, but rather on measurements of [[chord (trigonometry)|chord]] (twice the sine of an angle) and thus with a proper understanding students could reap continued advantages from use of linear measurement without the claimed ''logical'' inconsistencies when circular parametrization by angle is subsequently introduced.<ref name=\"web.maths.unsw.edu.au\">http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/TrigComparison.pdf</ref>\n\n==Quadrance==\n<!-- Linked to from redirects and from inside this article -->\nQuadrance and distance (as its square root) both measure separation of points in Euclidean space.<ref name=\"Horizons\"/> Following Pythagoras's theorem, the quadrance of two points {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|''A''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} (''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}} in a plane is therefore defined as the sum of squares of differences in the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> coordinates:\n\n: <math>Q(A_1, A_2) = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.</math>\n\nThe [[triangle inequality]] <math> d_3 \\leq d_1 + d_2 </math> is expressed under rational trigonometry as <math> (Q_3 - Q_1 - Q_2)^2 \\leq 4 Q_1 Q_2 </math>.\n\n==Spread==\n<!-- Linked to from redirects -->\n[[Image:Spread as ratio.svg|thumb|left|Suppose {{math|''l''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''l''<sub>2</sub>}} intersect at the point {{mvar|A}}.

Given the triangle {{math|△''ABC''}} with a spread of 1 between sides {{mvar|AB}} and {{mvar|AC}},\n\n:<math>Q(AB) + Q(AC) = Q(BC)</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|Q}} is the \"quadrance\", i.e. the square of the distance.\n\n{{Hidden begin|title=Proof}}\n[[Image:PythagoreanTheoremProofIllustration.svg|thumbnail|250px|right|Illustration of nomenclature used in the proof.]]\nConstruct a line {{mvar|AD}} dividing the spread of 1, with the point {{mvar|D}} on line {{mvar|BC}}, and making a spread of 1 with {{mvar|DB}} and {{mvar|DC}}. The triangles {{math|△''ABC''}}, {{math|△''DBA''}} and {{math|△''DAC''}} are similar (have the same spreads but not the same quadrances).\n\nThis leads to two equations in ratios, based on the spreads of the sides of the triangle:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns_C &= \\frac{Q(AB)}{Q(BC)} &&= \\frac{Q(BD)}{Q(AB)} &&= \\frac{Q(AD)}{Q(AC)}.\\\\\ns_B &= \\frac{Q(AC)}{Q(BC)} &&= \\frac{Q(DC)}{Q(AC)} &&= \\frac{Q(AD)}{Q(AB)}.\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow in general, the two spreads resulting from dividing a spread into two parts, as line {{mvar|AD}} does for spread {{mvar|CAB}}, do not add up to the original spread since spread is a non-linear function. So we first prove that dividing a spread of 1, results in two spreads that do add up to the original spread of 1.\n\nFor convenience, but with no loss of generality, we orient the lines intersecting with a spread of 1 to the coordinate axes, and label the dividing line with coordinates {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}}. Then the two spreads are given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns_1 &= \\frac{(x_2 - x_2)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n&&= \\frac{(y_2 - y_1)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2},\\\\\ns_2 &= \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_2)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n&&= \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nHence\n:<math>s_1 + s_ 2 = \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 1,</math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math>s_C + s_B = 1.</math>\n\nUsing the first two ratios from the first set of equations, this can be rewritten:\n\n:<math>\\frac{Q(AB)}{Q(BC)} + \\frac{Q(AC)}{Q(BC)} = 1.</math>\n\nMultiplying both sides by {{math|''Q''(''BC'')}}:\n\n:<math>Q(AB) + Q(AC) = Q(BC).</math>\n\n[[Q.E.D.]]\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===Spread law===\nFor any triangle {{math|△''A''<sub>1</sub>''A''<sub>2</sub>''A''<sub>3</sub>}} with nonzero quadrances:<ref name=\"Wildberger_2005\"/>\n\n: <math>\\frac{s_1}{Q_1}=\\frac{s_2}{Q_2}=\\frac{s_3}{Q_3}.</math>\n\nThis is the [[law of sines]], just squared.\n\n===Cross law===\nFor any triangle {{math|△''A''<sub>1</sub>''A''<sub>2</sub>''A''<sub>3</sub>}},<ref name=\"Wildberger_2005\"/>\n\n: <math>(Q_1 + Q_2 - Q_3)^2 = 4Q_1 Q_2 (1-s_3).</math>\n\nThis is analogous to the [[law of cosines]].

Since two solutions are produced, further ''triangle spread rules'' must be used to select the appropriate one. While this appears more complex than obtaining a supplementary angle directly by subtraction, the irrational value of '{{pi}}' (implicitly present in the angle sum of a triangle) is avoided.\n\n==Trigonometry over arbitrary fields==\nAs the laws of rational trigonometry give algebraic (and not transcendental) relations, they apply in generality to algebraic number fields beyond the rational numbers.

The problem is as follows:\n\n[[Image:Regiomontanus.problem.png|right|thumb|550px|The two dots at eye level are possible locations of the viewer's eye.]]\n\n: A painting hangs from a wall.  Given the heights of the top and bottom of the painting above the viewer's eye level, how far from the wall should the viewer stand in order to maximize the angle [[subtended angle|subtended]] by the painting and whose vertex is at the viewer's eye?\n\nIf the viewer stands too close to the wall or too far from the wall, the angle is small; somewhere in between it is as large as possible.\n\nThe same approach applies to finding the optimal place from which to kick a ball in rugby.<ref>{{citation|title=Rugby and Mathematics: A Surprising Link among Geometry, the Conics, and Calculus|first1=Troy|last1=Jones|first2=Steven|last2=Jackson|journal=Mathematics Teacher|volume=94|issue=8|pages=649–654|year=2001|url=http://wesclark.com/rrr/rugby_and_math.pdf}}.</ref> For that matter, it is not necessary that the alignment of the picture be at right angles: we might be looking at a window of the Leaning Tower of Pisa or a realtor showing off the advantages of a sky-light in a sloping attic roof.\n\n== Solution by elementary geometry ==\n\n[[Image:Regiomontanus.solution.png|right|thumb|550px]]\n\nThere is a unique [[circle]] passing through the top and bottom of the painting and tangent to the eye-level line.  By elementary geometry, if the viewer's position were to move along the circle, [[inscribed angle|the angle subtended by the painting would remain constant]].  All positions on the eye-level line except the point of tangency are outside of the circle, and therefore the angle subtended by the painting from those points is smaller.\n\nBy Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''&nbsp;III.36 (alternatively the [[power of a point|power-of-a-point theorem]]), the distance from the wall to the point of tangency is the [[geometric mean]] of the heights of the top and bottom of the painting. This means, in turn, that if we reflect the bottom of the picture in the line at eye-level and draw the circle with the segment between the top of the picture and this reflected point as diameter, the circle intersects the line at eye-level in the required position (by Elements II.14).{{what|this sentence makes no sense to me - could it be explained better|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Solution by calculus ==\nIn the present day, this problem is widely known because it appears as an exercise in many first-year calculus textbooks (for example that of Stewart&nbsp;<ref>James Stewart, ''Calculus: Early Transcendentals'', Fifth Edition, Brooks/Cole, 2003, page&nbsp;340, exercise&nbsp;58</ref>).\n\nLet\n\n: ''a'' = the height of the bottom of the painting above eye level;\n: ''b'' = the height of the top of the painting above eye level;\n: ''x'' = the viewer's distance from the wall;\n: ''&alpha;'' = the angle of elevation of the bottom of the painting, seen from the viewer's position;\n: ''&beta;'' = the angle of elevation of the top of the painting, seen from the viewer's position.\n\nThe angle we seek to maximize is ''&beta;&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&alpha;''.  The [[trigonometric functions#Sine, cosine and tangent|tangent]] of the angle increases as the angle increases; therefore it suffices to maximize\n\n: <math> \\tan(\\beta - \\alpha) = \\frac{\\tan\\beta - \\tan\\alpha}{1 + \\tan\\beta\\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{\\frac{b}{x} - \\frac{a}{x}}{1 + \\frac{b}{x}\\cdot\\frac{a}{x}} = (b-a)\\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}. </math>\n\nSince ''b''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a'' is a positive constant, we only need to maximize the fraction that follows it.  Differentiating, we get\n\n: <math> {d \\over dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}\\right) = \\frac{ab - x^2}{(x^2 + ab)^2} \\qquad \\begin{cases} {} > 0 & \\text{if } 0 \\le x < \\sqrt{ab\\,{}}, \\\\ {} = 0 & \\text{if } x = \\sqrt{ab\\,{}}, \\\\ {} < 0 & \\text{if } x > \\sqrt{ab\\,{}}. \\end{cases} </math>\n\nTherefore the angle increases as ''x'' goes from 0 to {{radic|''ab''}} and decreases as ''x'' increases from {{radic|''ab''}}.  The angle is therefore as large as possible precisely when ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|''ab''}}, the [[geometric mean]] of ''a''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''b''.\n\n== Solution by algebra ==\n\nWe have seen that it suffices to maximize\n\n: <math> \\frac{x}{x^2 + ab}. </math>\n\nThis is equivalent to ''minimizing'' the reciprocal:\n\n:<math> \\frac{x^2 + ab}{x} = x + \\frac{ab}{x}. </math>\n\nObserve that this last quantity is equal to\n\n: <math> \\left( \\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt\\frac{ab}{x}\\, \\right)^2 + 2\\sqrt{ab\\,{}}.\n</math>\n\n{{show\n|(Click \"show\" at right to see the algebraic details or \"hide\" to hide them.)\n|\nRecall that \n: <math> (u-v)^2 = u^2 - 2uv + v^2. </math>\nThus when we have ''u''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''v''<sup>2</sup>, we can add the middle term &minus;2''uv'' to get a perfect square.

      "text": "[[image:Tondo e quadro (Bianco, 1436).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''tondo e quadro'' (circle and square) from [[Andrea Bianco]]'s 1436 atlas]]\nThe '''rule of marteloio''' is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] technique of [[navigation]]al computation that uses [[compass]] direction, [[distance]] and a simple [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] table known as the '''''toleta de marteloio'''''. The rule told [[mariner]]s how to plot the traverse between two different navigation [[Course (navigation)|courses]] by means of resolving [[triangle]]s with the help of the ''Toleta'' and basic [[arithmetic]].\n\nThose uncomfortable with manipulating numbers could resort to the visual '''''tondo e quadro''''' (circle-and-square) and achieve their answer with [[dividers]].  The rule of marteloio was commonly used by [[Mediterranean]] navigators during the 14th and 15th centuries, before the development of [[celestial navigation|astronomical navigation]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[etymology]] comes from the [[Venetian language]].  In his 1436 atlas, [[Venice|Venetian]] captain and cartographer [[Andrea Bianco]] introduced a table of numbers which he called the ''toleta de marteloio'' (\"table of marteloio\"), and the method of using it as the ''raxon de marteloio'' (\"reason of marteloio\").\n\nThe meaning of ''marteloio'' itself is uncertain.  The most widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld|A.E. Nordenskiöld]], is that ''marteloio'' relates to \"[[hammer]]\" (\"martelo\" in Venetian), referring to the small hammer that was used to hit the on-board [[ship's bell]] to mark the passage of time.<ref>Nordenskiöld (1897: p.51ff); Ruge (1900: [https://books.google.com/books?id=S6o9wHoZVZEC&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false p.177]).</ref>  It has been suggested that the -''oio'' suffix implies that ''marteloio'' meant not quite the hammer itself nor the hammerer, but rather \"the hammering\", intending to indicate \"the hammering, the din, the racket\" from the [[watch system|change of the watch]] every four hours.  As there were many hands on deck during a change of the watch, it would be an opportune moment for the ship's [[maritime pilot|pilot]] to order a change in [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] (if necessary).<ref>Kelley (1995: p. 2)</ref>\n\nAlternative hypotheses (not nearly as accepted) are that \"marteloio\" is a corruption of ''mari logio'' (meaning \"rule of the sea\"),<ref>This was forwarded by Giuseppe Toaldo (1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 44])</ref> or from ''mare tela'' (meaning \"sea network\"),<ref>This was proposed by Desimoni (1888: p. 15)</ref> or that it derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''homartologium'' (''όμαρτόλογίον'', meaning \"companion piece\"),<ref>Morelli (1810: [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ls6AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false p.42]).  Morelli's interpretation is cited already by Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false p.28]).</ref> or from the Greek ''imeralogium'' (''ήμερόλογίον'', meaning \"daily calculation\")<ref>This was proposed by Fincati, as reported by Albertis (1893)</ref> or that it might be from the northern [[French language|French]] ''matelot'', which in turn comes from [[Breton language|Breton]] ''martolod'' (meaning \"sailors\").<ref>This is proposed by Breusing (1881: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vnA9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 130])</ref>\n\n== Purpose ==\n\n[[image:Medieval ship and compass (Mandeville).jpg|thumb|300px|15th-century mariner consulting a compass aboard ship (from [[John Mandeville]]'s ''Travels'', 1403)]]\nThe \"rule of marteloio\" was used in European navigation in the [[Middle Ages]], most notably in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the 14th and 16th centuries, although it may have older roots.  It was an integral part of navigation by \"compass and chart\", before the advent of [[geographical coordinates]] and the development of [[celestial navigation]] in Europe.<ref>Taylor (1956); Parry (1974)</ref>\n\nMedieval navigation relied on two parameters, direction and distance.  On board ship, direction was determined by the [[mariner's compass]] (which emerged around 1300).<ref>Aczel (2001: p.76)</ref>  Distance was measured by [[dead reckoning]], (''i.e.'', distance = speed &times; time), where time was measured by a half-[[hour-glass]], and speed readings were taken with by some form of a [[chip log]] (the archaic method, used in the 14th and 15th centuries, involved heaving a piece of wood or flotsam overboard; the crew engaged in a rhythmic chant to mark the time it took for the chip to float past the length of the ship).<ref>Kelley (1995: p.12). This is slightly different from the later chip log, where the wood was tied to a rope with regularly spaced knots; the rope was allowed to unspool freely until a sandglass ran out, and the \"[[knot (unit)|knots]]\" counted up in the aftermath. The chip log was first mentioned by [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] in 1574.</ref>\n\n[[image:Mediterranean chart fourteenth century2.jpg|thumb|300px|Anonymous Genoese [[portolan chart]] from c. 1325 to c. 1350. ([[Library of Congress]], Washington DC)]]\nPlotting a course required knowing the compass direction and distance between point A and point B.  Knowledge of where ports lay relative to each other was acquired by navigators by long experience at sea.  This information was sometimes collected and written down in a pilot's handbook, known as a ''[[portolano]]'' (\"port book\", in Italian, equivalent to the Greek ''[[periplus]]'', the Portuguese ''roteiro'' and the English ''[[rutter (nautical)|rutter]]'').  These handbooks were used to construct a class of nautical maps known as [[portolan charts]].  Portolan charts began being produced in [[Genoa]] in the late 13th century, and soon spread to [[Venice]] and [[Majorca]].  Portolan charts were not gridded by longitude and latitude lines, but rather by a web of [[compass rose|compass]] [[rhumb lines]], giving mariners an idea of only the distance and direction between places.\n\n[[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|300px|32-wind [[compass rose]] with traditional names (and traditional color code).]]\nBy a handbook or a portolan chart, a navigator could see immediately that, for example, [[Pisa]] lay 85 miles southeast (\"Scirocco\" in the traditional [[compass rose]] nomenclature) of [[Genoa]], and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat.  A mariner wishing to sail from [[Majorca]] to [[Naples]] could tell the latter was due east (\"Levante\") by some 600 miles – but the island of [[Sardinia]] lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route.  This is easier said than done, as [[geographical coordinates]] did not exist during this era.  The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.<ref>Taylor (1956: p.123, 159, 167); Parry (1974: p.37)</ref>\n\nIslands were a predictable obstacle – circumventing Sardinia would be simply a matter of sailing southeast for a set distance then changing the bearing to northeast (\"Greco\") for the remainder.  More problematic is if the ship were blown off its intended route by fitful winds, or had to engage in [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]], changing bearing repeatedly. How does it return to its intended course?  This is where the rule of marteloio came in.\n\n== The traverse problem ==\n\nThe rule of marteloio addressed the problem of changing bearing at sea. More specifically, it helped a navigator plot the traverse from one navigational [[Course (navigation)|course]] to another.<ref>Taylor (1956: p.116ff.) Taylor (1960: p.10)</ref> For example, suppose a ship was to sail from [[Corsica]] to [[Genoa]], a course bearing straight north (\"Tramontana\") for some 130 miles. But the winds are not cooperative, and the ship was forced to sail northwest (\"Maestro\") for some 70 miles.  How does it return to its original route?  Re-setting its bearing to northeast (\"Greco\") seems sensible enough, but how long should it sail on that bearing?  How would a navigator know when the ship had reached its old route and should turn north again?   How to avoid overshooting or undershooting the old course?\n\n[[image:Marteloio on chart.jpg|thumb|150px|The traverse problem: intended course ''AB'' (bearing N), actual course ''AC'' (bearing NW). Calculating the ''ritorno'' (distance on return course ''CD'', bearing NE) and ''avanzo'' (distance made good on intended course) is a matter of solving the triangle ''ACD'']]\nThis is a mathematical problem of [[solution of triangles|solving a triangle]].  If a navigator knows how long the ship has sailed on the erroneous course, he can calculate its current distance from its intended course, and estimate how long it must sail back on a new bearing until it recovers its old course.  In the Corsica-to-Genoa example, there is an implied [[triangle]] ''ACD'', with one side given (''AC'' = 70 miles on actual NW course), a 45° angle at ''A'' (angle of difference between actual course NW and intended course N) and another angle of 90° at ''C'' (angle of difference between actual course NW and return course NE).  The challenge to the navigator is to find how long one must sail on the NE return course (the length of side ''CD'', what is called the ''ritorno'') and how far one has advanced on the intended course by the time one straightens out (the length of the hypotenuse ''AD'', or what is called the total ''avanzo'').\n\nThis is elementary [[trigonometry]], solving for two sides given one side (70) and two angles (45° and 90°). This is quickly done by applying the [[law of sines]]:\n\n:<math> \\frac {70 \\text{ miles}}{\\sin D} = \\frac {\\text{ritorno}}{\\sin 45} = \\frac {\\text{avanzo}}{\\sin 90}  </math>\n\nyielding up the solutions ''ritorno'' = 70 miles and total ''avanzo'' = 98.99 miles.  This means that if the ship bears NE from its current position (''C''), it will reach its original intended course after 70 miles of sailing on the NE bearing. By the time it reaches its junction point (''D''), it will have covered 98.99 miles of its original intended course.  There it can straighten its bearing N and sail the remaining 30 miles or so to Genoa.\n\nUnfortunately, Medieval sailors with the rudimentary educational levels of the 14th and 15th centuries, were not likely to know the Law of Sines or manipulate it with ease.<ref>Van Brunnelen (2010, p.67)</ref> As a result, Medieval navigators needed simpler and more accessible method of calculation.\n\n== Rules ==\n\n=== Ramon Llull's \"miliaria\" ===\n\nThe scholar-cleric [[Ramon Llull]] of [[Majorca]], was the first writer to refer to a rule to solve the traverse problem of navigation. In his ''Arbor Scientiae'' (1295), in the section of questions on geometry, Llul writes:\n\n{{Cquote|How do mariners measure miles at sea (''miliaria in mari'')?  Mariners consider the four general winds, that is to say the eastern, western, northern and southern, and also another four winds that lie between them, ''grec'' (NE),''exaloch'' (SE), ''lebeg'' (SW) and ''maestre'' (NW).   And they look carefully at the center of the circle in which the winds (rhumbs) meet at angles; they consider when a ship travels by the East wind (''levant'')  100 miles from the center, how many miles it would make on the southeast (''exaloch'') wind; and for 200 miles, they double the number by multiplying and then they know how many miles there are from the end of each 100 miles in an easterly direction to the corresponding point in a southeasterly direction.  And for this they have this instrument [a mathematical table?] and a chart, rutter, needle and the pole star.\"<ref>Llull ''Arbor Scientiae'' (1295, (1635 Latin ed.):[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1zSAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA570#v=onepage&q&f=false p.570] See also Edson (2007: p.51) and Cotter (1978:p.5)</ref>}}\n\nWhat Llull seems to be trying to explain is that a ship actually sailing E, but intending to sail SE, it can figure out how much of its intended southeastward distance it has already made good – what Italians called the \"''avanzar''\", but Lull seems to call the \"''miliaria in mari''\".  Llull does not explain exactly how, but refers only to an \"instrument\", presumably some sort of trigonometric table. Lull is implying that mariners can calculate the ''miliaria'' on the intended course by multiplying the distance actually sailed on the erroneous course by the [[cosine]] of the angle between the two routes.<ref>This interpretation is originally due to Taylor (1956: pp. 117–19).  See also Cortesão (1969: v. 1, pp. 206–7), Cotter (1978: pp. 6–7) and Campbell (1987: pp. 441–42).</ref>\n[[image:Marteloio of Ramon Llull.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ramon Lull]]'s ''miliaria in mari'', from his 1295 example.]]\n\n: ''Miliaria in mari'' = distance sailed &times; cos(''θ'')\n\nwhere ''θ'' is the angle of difference between the two routes.\n\nUsing Lull's example, a ship that intended to sail southeast (\"Exaloch\" is [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for \"Scirocco\") but was instead forced to sail east (\"Levant\"), then the angle of difference is ''θ''&nbsp;=&nbsp;45°.  After 100 miles on the erroneous route, the ''miliaria'' on the intended route is 100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;cos&nbsp;45° = 70.71.

See also Cotter (1978: p. 7)</ref>  Reversing his example, with a ship actually sailing Southeast but intending to sail East, Llull notes that for every four miles on the southeast bearing, it \"gains three miles\" (2.83 actually) on the intended eastward route.  Thus, Lull notes, the ship \"loses 25 miles\" (29 actually) of its intended course for every 100 miles it sails on the current course.\n\nNotice that in his passages, Ramon Lull is not recommending the rule, but reporting it, insinuating that this rule was already known and used by contemporary sailors in practice.<ref>\"To a mathematician familiar with contemporary mathematical knowledge and practice, it is quite clear that Lull did not fully understand what he was writing about.

In the first folio of his 1436 [[portolan chart|portolan atlas]], the [[Venice|Venetian]] captain [[Andrea Bianco]] explains the ''raxon de marteloio'', how to calculate the traverse and recover the course.  He lays out a simple trigonometric table he calls the ''toleta de marteloio'' and recommends that mariners commit the table to memory.<ref>For a transcription of Bianco's  1436 instructions, see Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false p.30]) or Gelgich (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6mtAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false p.73])</ref>\n\nThe ''toleta de marteloio'' is set out as follows:<ref>The ''Toleta'' we replicate here is the version of [[Michael of Rhodes]] (McGee et al., [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48b.html p.48b]).  Bianco's original table contains some small errors – specifically in the ''ritorno'' column, Bianco mistakenly inserts 14 rather than 12 in the fifth row (q = 5); in the ''avanzo di ritorno'' column, Bianco gives 5{{frac|1|10}} instead of 2{{frac|1|5}} in the seventh row and 8 instead of 10 in the eighth row. Gelgich (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6mtAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false p.74]).  It is possible that by the \"5{{frac|1|10}}\" entry, Bianco meant to write \"1/5th of 10\" = 2 (the number often given in modern reproductions of the toleta, e.g. Vernet, 2008)).  The 2{{frac|1|5}} is given only in the toleta version of Michael of Rhodes. The version in the Foscarini letter, that entry is given as 1{{frac|9|10}} 9/10 (Toaldo, 1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false p.43]).</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"2\"; style=\"text-align: center; width: 200px;\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

(notice that the numbers work with quarter-winds set at 11.15° intervals, rather than 11.25°, the usual definition of a quarter wind).\n\nThe ''Toleta'' is a simple table with several columns of numbers.  In the first column is the angle of difference between the actual and intended courses, expressed by number of [[quarter-winds]].  Once that difference is determined, the second column gives the ''Alargar'' (the \"Widening\", the current distance the ship is from the intended course) while the third column tells the ''Avanzar'' (the \"Advance\", how much of the distance on the intended course has already been covered by sailing on the current bearing – this is equivalent of Ramon Llull's ''miliaria di mari'').  The Alargar and Avanzar numbers are shown on the Bianco's table for 100 miles of sailing on the current course.\n\n[[image:Marteloio alargar.jpg|thumb|400px|Calculating ''alargar'' and ''avanzar'' from Bianco's ''Toleta''.]]\n'''Example''':  suppose a ship intended to sail bearing east (\"Levante\") from point A to point B. But suppose that winds forced it to sail on a southeast-by-east course (SEbE, \"Quarto di Scirocco verso Levante\").  Southeast-by-east is three quarter winds (or 33.75°) away from east (on a 32-point [[compass rose|compass]], in order of quarter-winds away from east, 1 quarter is east-by-south, 2 quarters is East-southeast, 3 quarters is southeast-by-east).  That means that the navigator should consult the third row,&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, on the toleta.\n\nSuppose the ship sailed 100 miles on the SE-by-E bearing. To check his distance from the intended eastward course, the mariner will read the corresponding entry on the ''alargar'' column and immediately see he is 55 miles away from the intended course.   The ''avanzar'' column informs him that having sailed 100 miles on the current SEbE course, he has covered 83 miles of the intended E course.\n\nThe next step is to determine how to return to the intended course.  Continuing the example, to get back to the intended Eastward course, our mariner has to re-orient the ship's bearing in a northeasterly direction. But there are various northeasterly angles – NbE, NNE, NE, ENE, etc.  The mariner has a choose the bearing – if he returns by a sharp angle (e.g. North by east), he will return to the intended course faster than at a more gentle gradient (e.g. East by north).  Whichever angle he chooses, he must deduce exactly how long he must sail on that bearing in order to reach his old course. If he sails too long, he risks overshooting it.\n\n[[File:Marteloio ritorno.jpg|thumb|400px|Calculating the ''ritorno'' and ''avanzo di ritorno'']]This is what the third column of the toleta is for.  The return angles are expressed as quarters from the ''intended'' course bearing (''not'' the current course bearing).  In our example, the mariner intended to go east, but has been sailing southeast-by-east for 100 miles.  Given the winds, he decides it is best to return to the original course by re-orienting the ship east-northeast (ENE, \"Greco-Levante\").  ENE is two quarter-winds above the ''intended'' bearing, East, so now he looks at second row (\"quarters = 2\") on the table.  In the third column, the ''ritorno'', shows the number 26.  This represents the required number of miles he must travel on ENE bearing for every 10 miles of alargar.  Remember, his alargar (distance from intended course) was 55 miles.  So in order to return to his intended course he must travel 5.5 &times; 26 = 143 miles on ENE.  In other words, he needs to hold his ENE bearing for 143 miles; once that distance is travelled, he should straighten his ship East, and he will be exactly on the intended course.\n\nThe final column (''avanzo di ritorno'') gives the length on the intended course he has made good by his return travel.  This is also expressed in terms per 10 miles alargar. His alargar was 55, and his angle of return was ENE (thus q = 2), that means his avanzo di ritorno is 5.5 &times; 24 = 132.  In other words, if everything goes right, and our mariner holds his ENE bearing for 143 miles (''ritorno''), then during that return, he will have covered an additional 132 miles on his intended eastward course (''avanzo di ritorno'').\n\nFinally, the total avanzo on the eastward bearing is the avanzar during the deviation (83 miles) plus the avanzo di ritorno (132 miles), thus on the whole, he has covered 83 + 132 = 215 miles on the intended course.  Measuring that distance on the map from the starting point (''A''), the mariner can figure out his exact current position.\n\nThis is the simplest use of the toleta de marteloio.  It is, at root, a trigonometric table. However, it does not tackle the traverse problem in one go, like the Law of Sines, but rather splits the problem into two [[right-angled triangle]]s which it proceeds to solve successively.  Modern [[trigonometry]] would dispense with the step of calculating the alargar, and calculate the ritorno directly – but for that, one needs to be armed with a full [[trigonometric tables|sine table]]. The toleta is a rather simple table, easy to consult and perform calculations with, and sufficiently compact to be memorized by navigators (as Bianco recommends).\n\n=== Rule of three ===\n\nThe ''toleta de marteloio'' is expressed for nice round numbers, 100 and 10.  But, in practice, a ship would not usually sail 100 miles before trying to return, but some other distance, say 65 miles.  To calculate this is a simple problem of solving [[ratio]]s.  For example, if the ship had sailed 65 miles on southeast-by-east, then calculating the alargar from the intended Eastward course is simply a matter of solving the following for {{math|<var>x</var>}}:\n\n: <math> \\frac {26}{100} = \\frac {x}{65} </math>\n\nwhere 26 is the alargar for 100 miles (as given in the second column of the table).  This is easily done by the simple \"[[Rule of three (mathematics)|Rule of Three]]\", a method of cross-multiplication, using three numbers to solve for the fourth by successive multiplication and division:\n\n: {{math|<var>x</var> {{=}} 65 × 26 ÷ 100}}\n\nSo, sailing for 65 miles on SE by E implies alargar = {{math|<var>x</var>}} =  16.9 miles.  The avanzar, etc. can be figured out analogously.\n\nWhile the \"rule of three\" was already known in the 14th century, skill in executing [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] could be elusive for Medieval sailors drawn from what was a largely illiterate society. Nonetheless, it was not inaccessible.  As Andrea Bianco urged, navigators should \"know how to multiply well and divide well\" (\"saver ben moltiplichar e ben partir\")<ref>As quoted in Gelgich (1892: p.73)</ref>   It is here where we see the important interface of [[commerce]] and navigation.   The mathematics of commerce – [[Arabic numerals]], multiplication, division, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], the tools needed to calculate purchases and sales of goods and other commercial transactions – was essentially the same as the mathematics of navigation.<ref>This is clearly shown in the book of Michael of Rhodes, where commercial and navigational calculations follow one another.  See the [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/math.html Michael of Rhodes website].</ref>  And this kind of mathematics was taught at the [[abacus school]]s which were set up in the 13th century in the commercial centers of northern Italy to train the sons of merchants, the very same class where Italian navigators were drawn from.  As historian E.G.R. Taylor notes, \"sailors were the first professional group to use mathematics in their everyday work\"<ref>Taylor (1960: p.12)</ref>\n\n=== Circle and square ===\n\n[[image:Tondo e quadro (basic features).jpg|thumb|300px|Reproduction of the basic features of the ''tondo e quadro'']]\nFor those troubled by the high art of manipulating numbers, there was an alternative. This was the visual device known as the \"circle and square\" (''tondo e quadro''), also supplied by [[Andrea Bianco]] in his 1436 atlas.<ref>Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 35]), Cotter (1978: ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5fAnNGk1xXwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 10])</ref>\n\nThe circle was a 32-wind [[compass rose]] (or gathering of rhumb-lines).  The circle was inscribed with an 8 × 8 square grid.\n\nThe compass rose in the center can be overlooked – indeed, the circle itself can be ignored, as it seems to have no other purpose than the construction of the rays that run across the grid.<ref>Kelley (1995)</ref>  The rose of interest is in the upper left corner of the square grid. From that corner, emanate a series of compass [[rhumb lines]].  In his original 1436 ''tondo e quadro'', Bianco has sixteen emanating rays – that is, Bianco includes half-quarter winds, or eighth-winds (''otava''), so that the emanating rays are at intervals of 5.625 degrees.  Other constructions of the circle-and-square, e.g. the [[Cornaro Atlas]], use only eight rays emanating at quarter-wind distances (11.25 degrees).  Visually, these rays replicate the bottom right quarter of a 32-wind [[compass rose]]: East (0q), E by S (1q), ESE (2q), SE by E (3q), SE (4q), SE by S (5q), SSE (6q), S by E (7q) and South (8q).\n\n[[image:Marteloio grid scale.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Reproduction of the bar scale of Bianco's ''tondo e quadro'']]\nAbove the grid is a distance [[Linear scale|bar scale]], notched with sub-units. There are two sets of numbers on the scale, one for measuring each grid square by 20 miles, another for measuring each grid square by 100 miles (see diagram).<ref>Taylor (1956: p. 116; 1960: p. 14)</ref> The top bar is the 20m-per-square scale, with every black dot denoting one mile.  The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where the length of a unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles.  So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20&nbsp;m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).\n\n[[image:Tondo e quadro detail (Bianco, 1436).jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of Bianco's ''tondo e quadro'']]\nThe cherub with the [[dividers]] suggests how a navigator is supposed to use the grid to calculate alargar and avanzar by visual measurement rather than manipulating numbers.\n\n[[image:Tondo e quadro (calculation).jpg|thumb|300px|Solving a triangle with the ''tondo e quadro'']]\n'''Example''': suppose the ship has travelled 120 miles at two quarter-winds below the intended course (e.g. traveled at ESE, when the intended course is East).   Using the dividers and the 20m scale, the navigator can measure out 120 miles with his dividers.  Then setting one end at the top left corner (''A''), he lays out the dividers along the ESE ray (= two quarter-winds below the East ray, or horizontal top of the grid) and marks the spot (point ''B'' on the diagram). Then using a [[straightedge]] ruler draws a line up to the East ray, and marks the corresponding spot ''C''.\n\nIt is easy to see immediately that a [[right-angled triangle]] ''ABC'' has been created. The length ''BC'' is the ''alargar'' (distance from intended course), which can be measured as 46 miles (this can be visually seen as two grid squares plus a bit, that is 20m + 20m and a little bit which can be assessed as 6m by using the dividers and the 20m bar scale).  The length ''AC'' is the ''avanzar'' (distance made good), which is 111 miles – visually, five grid squares and a bit, or (20 × 5) + 11, measured by dividers and scale again.\n\nThis is how the \"circle and square\" dispenses manipulating numbers by multiplication and division or the rule of three.  The navigator can assess the avanzar and alargar visually, by measurement alone.\n\nThis method can be used for any intended bearing and deviation, as the only purpose is to solve the triangle by dividers and scale.  e.g. using our first Corsica-to-Genoa example, where intended bearing was North but the ship actually sailed Northwest, the navigator would set the dividers at length 70 miles and lay it along the fourth quarter wind (= SE ray in the ''tondo e quadro'', as NW is four quarter winds away from North).  He would calculate the alargar and avanzar in exactly the same way – draw a line to the horizontal top of the grid, measure the squares, etc.\n\nThe ''tondo e quadro'' device is very similar to the Arab [[sine quadrant]] (''Rubul mujayyab''), with the corner rays replicating the role of the adjustable [[plumb line]].<ref>Kelley (1995: p. 3)</ref>\n\n== Other applications ==\n\nWhile the ''toleta de marteloio'' (and its visual counterpart, the ''tondo e quadro'') are designed for the explicit task of recovering an intended course, they can be used in more ways, for many classes of navigational problems, e.g. plotting out a course with multiple-bearing changes, etc.<ref>The [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/navigate_toolkit.html Michael of Rhodes website] shows various sort of problems Michael considered.</ref>\n\n=== Triangulation ===\n\nOne of the interesting applications of the rule of marteloio is for [[triangulation]], e.g. determining the distance of the ship from shore landmark. (This was the final exercise attempted in the notebook of the Venetian navigator [[Michael of Rhodes]], which we replicate here.)<ref>See Michael of Rhodes [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48a.html p.48a] and [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48b.html 48b]</ref>\n\n'''Example''': Suppose a ship sailing NW (\"Maestro\") spots a landmark due West (\"Ponente\") one evening, but distance unknown.  Suppose the ship continues sailing on the NW route overnight, and the next morning, 40 miles later, it notices that landmark is now west-southwest (WSW, \"Ponente-Libeccio\") of its current position.  Finding the distance of the landmark from the ship is just an application of the rule of marteloio.\n\n[[Image:Marteloio landmark triangulation.gif|thumb|401px|Application of the rule of marteloio to estimate the distance between the ship and a shore landmark.]]\nTo solve the problem, start from the evening position (''A'' on the map) and treat the distance between the ship and the landmark (length ''AB'') as the intended course, and the actual route of the ship (NW) as a deviation. To figure out the distance of the landmark from the ship's position in the morning (''C'') is a matter of treating the distance ''BC'' as the calculated ritorno. Since we need to know the alargar to calculate the ritorno, this is a two-step procedure.\n\nFirst, notice that NW is four quarter-winds above W, so looking up on the ''toleta'', in the q = 4 row, the ''alargar'' is 71 miles for every 100 miles on the NW course.  But the ship only sailed 40 miles overnight, so we have to solve the ratio 71/100 = ''x''/40, which by the rule of three means ''x'' = alargar = 28.4 miles.  In other words, by the overnight  sailing NW by 40 miles from A to C, the ship is now 28.4 miles away from its \"intended\" Westward course.\n\nNow for the ritorno.  The landmark, as noted, is WSW of the ship's morning position (''C'').  So to \"return\" to the landmark, the ship must change its bearing from its current NW bearing to a WSW bearing – that is, 6 quarter-winds below NW.  However, the toleta specifies quarter winds in terms of \"intended\" direction (in this case, West), and WSW is two quarter winds below West, so we need to look at the q = 2 row. This means the ritorno is 26 miles for every 10 miles alargar.  Since the alargar is 28.4, that means the ritorno is 26 &times; 2.84 = 73.84.  And there we have it.  The landmark is 73.84 miles away from the ship's morning position.\n\n(To complete the story, we might wish to find out the distance that landmark was the evening before (i.e. from point A to landmark B). That is simply a matter of adding the avanzar and the avanzo in ritorno. Quick calculations show the avanzar (@ q = 4, for 40 miles) is 28.4 miles (= 71 × 40/100) and the avanzo di ritorno (@ q = 2 for 28.4 miles alargar), is 2.84 × 24 = 68.16. So total avanzo = 28.4 + 68.16 = 96.56 miles. That was the distance between the landmark and the ship the evening before.)\n\n=== Finding locations ===\n\nThe rule of marteloio can also be used with the ''avanzar'' as a target, e.g. suppose a ship sets out with the intention of finding the [[Tordesillas Line]], the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] legally set in a 1494 treaty at 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]].  The ship need not set out from Cape Verde and set sail constantly at West bearing to find it.  Rather, it can sail out at a more convenient bearing (e.g. SW), and treat West as an \"intended\" course.  So using the marteloio rule, it can sail on until the ''avanzar'' on the \"intended\" West course reaches 370 leagues.\n\nIndeed, it need not even set out from Cape Verde, but can set out from another place, say, [[Seville]], and use the known distance and bearing of Cape Verde (viz. Seville) and the rule of marteloio to calculate when it has finally reached the Tordesillas meridian.  This takes a couple of steps.  Suppose Cape Verde (''B'' on map) is 400 leagues Southwest of Seville (''A'' on map), but the ship intends to go straight West from Seville to reach the Tordesillas meridian in the open sea.  How long does it need to sail?\n\n[[image:Marteloio tordesillas.gif|thumb|300px|Finding the [[Tordesillas Line]] via the rule of marteloio]]\nThe way to solve this by the rule of marteloio is to pose the problem in reverse: treat West as intended bearing and SW as the actual course.  SW is four quarter-winds below W, so looking up the toleta for q = 4, the ''avanzar'' is 71 for every 100 miles sailed.  So if a ship sailed 400 leagues on the \"actual\" SW course to Cape Verde, it would achieve an ''avanzar'' of 284 leagues (= 71 &times; 4) on the \"intended\" Westward course.  Of course, the ship is not actually sailing SW to Cape Verde, but sailing W into the open sea. In other words, when the ship sets sail West from Seville, it knows it needs to sail 284 leagues on the West bearing before it reaches the implied Cape Verde [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (point ''C'' on map), and should only start counting the 370 leagues to the Tordesillas line thereafter. In other words, it needs to sail a total of 284 + 370 = 654 leagues West of Seville to reach the Tordesillas line (point ''D'' on map).\n\nWhile this particular example shows the flexibility of the rule of marteloio, it also shows one of its principal drawbacks: the result completely ignores the [[curvature of the earth]], i.e. the fact that the [[longitude]] meridian lines converge on the [[North Pole]], and thus narrow at higher latitudes.  Contrary to what the marteloio suggests, 370 leagues West of Cape Verde is ''not'' on the same longitude meridian as 654 leagues West of Seville.  Because Seville is well north of Cape Verde, the meridians are clustered closer together at Seville's latitude than at Cape Verde's latitude.  A ship sailing west of Seville will, in fact, reach the real Tordesillas meridian (point ''T'' on map) well before 654 leagues are sailed (point ''D'').\n\nThe rule of marteloio has sailors plot routes by drawing [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] triangles on a chart, as if the world's surface were flat.  While this might be practical enough for sailing confined to the compact latitudes of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it is quite misleading on a grander scale.\n\n== Relation to later rules ==\n\n=== Relation to the \"regiment of the leagues\" ===\n\nIn the late 15th and 16th centuries, the improvement of [[celestial navigation|nautical astronomy]] and the introduction of [[latitude]] parallels allowed navigators to determine their position at sea by celestial readings, rather than relying on estimation of distance sailed.<ref>Taylor (1956), Albuquerque (1970), Parry (1974), Randles (1998)</ref>  The successor of the rule of marteloio was the \"Regiment of the Leagues\" (''regimento das léguas''),  that was used by Portuguese navigators sailing in the Atlantic Ocean.  Or, to use the term introduced by [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] (1571), the \"Rule to Raise or Lay a Degree\", also known as the \"Table of Leagues\" or the \"Rule for Raising the Pole\".<ref>Taylor (1956: pp. 163–4); Cotter (1978: p.11)</ref>  It was first written down in the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] navigation manual ''Regimento do astrolabio e do quadrante'' (published in Lisbon c. 1509, but written c. 1480)<ref>Diffie and Winius (1977: p.141); Parry (1974: [https://books.google.com/books?id=kCREcRCFD0QC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q&f=false p.149])</ref> It was popularized by [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]] in his 1551 ''Breve compendio la esfera y del arte de navegar''.\n\nThe \"Regiment of the Leagues\" is not very different from the rule of marteloio. The Regiment of the Leagues always considers the west-east bearing as the \"intended course\" and measures set deviations from it.  More specifically, the league table considers a fixed value of ''alargar'' – set at 1 [[Latitude#Degree length|latitude degree]] (or, in the measurements of the time, 17.5 (Portuguese) [[League (unit)|leagues]], or equivalently 70 (Italian) [[nautical mile|miles]]).<ref>Parry (pp. 149–50). One Portuguese league was four Italian miles. In modern nautical measures, one degree is 20 leagues, and one league is three nautical miles, thus 60 nautical miles to the degree.</ref>  It then gives for every different [[quarter wind]] of sailing direction (always designated as quarters away from the north-south axis, rather than away from the intended course), the ''relevar'' and the ''afastar''.  The ''relevar'' is the number of leagues on the actual course that a ship must sail in order to cover the pre-set 1 degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of ''alargar'' from the starting parallel). The ''afastar'' is merely the corresponding ''avanzar'' on the west-east bearing.\n\n[[image:Regiment of the leagues.gif|thumb|400px|Illustration of the \"Regiment of the Leagues\"]]\n'''Example''':  Suppose a ship sets out on an East-southeast (ESE) bearing.  That is six quarter-winds above South (remember: unlike the marteloio, the Regiment of the Leagues always measures quarter-winds away from the north–south meridian).  Looking at any regiment of the leagues table (e.g. [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], 1551),<ref>See Cotter (1978: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fAnNGk1xXwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false p.13])</ref> for ''q'' = 6, the table gives the ''relevar'' as 45{{frac|11|15}} leagues and the ''afastar'' as 42{{frac|1|4}} leagues.  This means that a ship sailing on the ESE bearing will have to sail 45.73 leagues to cover one degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of ''alargar'' from the east bearing, to use the marteloio language), and the corresponding ''afastar'' (''avanzar'' in marteloio terms) will be 42.25 leagues.\n\nIf, instead, the ship had set out on a SE bearing, that is four quarter-winds above South, the corresponding values of the Regiment of the Leagues table at ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 are ''relevar'' = 24{{frac|3|4}} and the ''afastar'' = 17 {{frac|1|2}}.\n\nNotice that the SE bearing reaches the 1 degree alargar faster (i.e. smaller ''relevar'') than that the ESE bearing, and will have less ''afastar'' (closer to the N–S meridian).\n\nMathematically,\n\n:''relevar'' = 17.5/cos θ\n:''afastar'' = 17.5 &times; tan θ\n\nwhere θ = 11.25 &times; number of quarters-winds away from the north-south axis.\n\nDespite the difference in terminology, notably the use of latitude degrees, the rule of marteloio and the Regiment of the Leagues are very similar – they are both about solving triangles on a plane chart.  The advantage of the regiment over the marteloio is the introduction of latitude parallels in the table, so that the position can be checked by astronomical observation (via [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], [[astrolabe]], etc.), and not have to rely wholly on sailor estimations of distance and direction.\n\nWith the regiment, geographical coordinates can also be used to guide navigation.  For instance, the search for the Todesillas line (meridian 370 leagues west of Cape Verde) is much simplified by reference to a precise latitude.  For instance, suppose two ships depart from Cape Verde (17° N), one on a West by North bearing (WbN, that is one quarter above West, or ''q'' = 7 from North axis), the other by a west-northwest bearing (WNW, two quarters above west, or ''q'' = 6 from the North axis). Using the Regiment of the Leagues, it is possible to calculate the precise latitudes when they will cross the Tordesillas meridian – simply divide 370 leagues west by the implied ''afastar'' at the different bearings. The WbN ship will reach the meridian when it achieves latitude 21° 21' N, while the WNW ship will reach it when it achieves latitude 29° N.<ref>Albuquerque (1973:[https://books.google.com/books?id=vOrDjQgDzQ8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA231#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 231])</ref> So rather than counting leagues with hourglass and speed readings, the ships can just maintain bearing, and take periodic astronomical observations to assess their latitude.\n\n=== Relation to \"traverse sailing\" ===\n\nThe toleta de marteloio is ancestral to the modern \"[[traverse table]]\" used in more modern navigation.<ref>For an example of a traverse table, see Gunmere (1822) ''Mathematical Tables'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAg1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false online].</ref> In the modern nomenclature, the ''traverse'' is the \"crooked path made by a ship when she sails in several successive directions\" and ''resolving the traverse'' is \"the method of finding a single course and distance which would bring a ship to the same place as two or more courses and distances\".<ref>Merrifield (1883: [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUYDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 58])</ref>  In marteloio language, when \"resolving the traverse\", the known information given is the \"actual course\" and the \"ritorno\", while the unknowns are the \"intended bearing\" and \"total avanzo\".\n\nTraverse tables use three values for each of the crooked course segments – the ''Distance'' (Dist.), ''Difference of Latitude'' (D.Lat., movement along N–S axis) and the ''Departure'' (Dep., movement along E–W axis), the latter two calculated by the formulas:\n\n: ''Difference of latitude'' = distance × cos ''θ'' \n: ''Departure'' =  distance × sin ''θ''\n\nwhere ''θ'' is the angular difference of the course from the N–S axis if the values of ''θ'' are less than 45°; if, however, the angle exceeds 45°, then ''θ'' is expressed as the angle of difference from the E–W axis, and the formulas are flipped, i.e. the Difference of Latitude formula becomes the Departure, and the Departure formula is the Difference of Latitude).  Or, even more simply, calculate  ''θ'' as the angle of difference from the nearest principal wind (N, S, E, W), run the formulas and then place the larger number in the appropriate column (D.Lat. or Dep.).\n\nFor each course segment, the navigator inserts the relevant trio (Dist., D.Lat., Dep.) and can calculate the implied bearing from the beginning to the endpoint and the distance made good on that bearing. He then combines, by addition and subtraction, all the differences of latitude and departure, to get the overall difference of latitude and departure, and converts that back to overall bearing and distance made good.<ref>For applications, see Merrifield (1883: p. 61)</ref>\n\n== Manuscript sources ==\n\n[[Ramon Llull]]'s suggestive 1295 remarks aside, the earliest known reference to ''marteloio'' is dated 1390, in the inventory of the estate of the mother of a certain Oberto Foglieto of Genoa, where an entry reads  ''unum martelogium....item carta una pro navegando''.<ref>This is reproduced in Albertis (1893: p. 118).

The computational complexity is directly proportional to the fineness of the direction grid, a highly dense grid is not computational practical. To overcome this resolution limitation imposed by the grid, the grid-free '''SAMV-SML''' ('''iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance - Stochastic Maximum Likelihood''') is proposed<ref name=AbeidaZhang/>, which refine the location estimates <math>\\boldsymbol{\\bf \\theta}=(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_K)^T</math> by iteratively minimizing a stochastic [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood]] cost function with respect to a single scalar parameter <math>\\theta_k</math>.\n\n==Application to range-Doppler imaging==\n\n[[File:IEEE transaction on Signal Processing Paper Results Sample.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Single-input single-output system|SISO]] range Doppler imaging results comparison with three 5 dB and six 25 dB targets.

The simulation conditions are identical to <ref name=\"Yardibi Li Stoica Xue 2010 pp. 425–443\"/>: A <math>30</math>-element polyphase [[Pulse compression|pulse compression]] P3 code is employed as the transmitted pulse, and a total of nine moving targets are simulated. Of all the moving targets, three are of <math>5</math> dB power and the rest six are of <math>25</math> dB power. The received signals are assumed to be contaminated with uniform white Gaussian noise of <math>0</math> dB power.\n\nThe [[matched filter]] detection result suffers from severe smearing and [[Spectral leakage|leakage]] effects both in the Doppler and range domain, hence it is impossible to distinguish the <math>5</math> dB targets. On contrary, the IAA algorithm offers enhanced imaging results with observable target range estimates and Doppler frequencies.

A sine wave is a [[continuous wave]].  It is named after the function [[sine]], of which it is the [[graph of a function|graph]]. It occurs often in pure and applied [[mathematics]], as well as [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[signal processing]] and many other fields. Its most basic form as a function of time (''t'') is:\n\n: <math>y(t) = A\\sin(2 \\pi f t + \\varphi) = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''A'', ''[[amplitude]]'', the peak deviation of the function from zero.\n* ''f'', ''[[frequency|ordinary frequency]]'', the ''[[Real number|number]]'' of oscillations (cycles) that occur each second of time.\n* ''ω'' = 2π''f'', ''[[angular frequency]]'', the rate of change of the function argument in units of [[radians per second]]\n* <math>\\varphi</math>, ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'', specifies (in [[radian]]s) where in its cycle the oscillation is at ''t'' = 0.{{paragraph}} When <math>\\varphi</math> is non-zero, the entire waveform appears to be shifted in time by the amount <math>\\varphi</math>/''ω'' seconds.  A negative value represents a delay, and a positive value represents an advance.\n\n{{Listen|filename=220 Hz sine wave.ogg|title=Sine wave|description=2.3 seconds of a 220 Hz sine wave}}\n[[Image:Animated-mass-spring.gif|right|frame|The oscillation of an undamped spring-mass system around the equilibrium is a sine wave.]]\nThe sine wave is important in physics because it retains its wave shape when added to another sine wave of the same frequency and arbitrary phase and magnitude. It is the only periodic waveform that has this property. This property leads to its importance in [[Fourier analysis]] and makes it acoustically unique.\n\n== General form ==\nIn general, the function may also have:\n\n* a spatial variable ''x'' that represents the ''position'' on the dimension on which the wave propagates, and a characteristic parameter ''k'' called [[wave number]] (or angular wave number), which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency ''ω'' and the linear speed ([[phase velocity|speed of propagation]]) ''ν''; \n* a non-zero center amplitude, ''D''\n\nwhich is\n\n:<math>y(x, t) = A\\sin(kx - \\omega t + \\varphi) + D\\,</math>, if the wave is moving to the right\n:<math>y(x, t) = A\\sin(kx + \\omega t + \\varphi) + D\\,</math>, if the wave is moving to the left.\n\nThe wavenumber is related to the angular frequency by''':'''.\n\n:<math> k = {\\omega \\over v} = {2 \\pi f \\over v} = {2 \\pi \\over \\lambda}</math>\n\nwhere λ (lambda) is the [[wavelength]], ''f'' is the [[frequency]], and ''v'' is the linear speed.\n\nThis equation gives a sine wave for a single dimension; thus the generalized equation given above gives the displacement of the wave at a position ''x'' at time ''t'' along a single line.\nThis could, for example, be considered the value of a wave along a wire.\n\nIn two or three spatial dimensions, the same equation describes a travelling [[plane wave]] if position ''x'' and wavenumber ''k'' are interpreted as vectors, and their product as a [[dot product]]. \nFor more complex waves such as the height of a water wave in a pond after a stone has been dropped in, more complex equations are needed.\n\n== Occurrences ==\n[[File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif|thumb|400px|Illustrating the cosine wave's fundamental relationship to the circle.]]\nThis [[wave]] pattern occurs often in nature, including [[wind wave]]s, [[sound]] waves, and [[light]] waves.\n\nA [[cosine]] wave is said to be ''sinusoidal'', because <math>\\cos(x) = \\sin(x + \\pi/2),</math>\nwhich is also a sine wave with a phase-shift of π/2 radians. Because of this [[head start (positioning)|head start]], it is often said that the cosine function ''leads'' the sine function or the sine ''lags'' the cosine.\n\nThe human [[ear]] can recognize single sine waves as sounding clear because sine waves are representations of a single [[frequency]] with no [[harmonic]]s.\n\nTo the human ear, a sound that is made of more than one sine wave will have perceptible harmonics; addition of different sine waves results in a different waveform and thus changes the [[timbre]] of the sound. Presence of higher harmonics in addition to the fundamental causes variation in the timbre, which is the reason why the same [[musical note]] (the same frequency) played on different instruments sounds different. On the other hand, if the sound contains aperiodic waves along with sine waves (which are periodic), then the sound will be perceived to be noisy, as [[noise (acoustic)|noise]] is characterized as being aperiodic or having a non-repetitive pattern.\n\n== Fourier series ==\n[[File:Waveforms.svg|thumb|400px|Sine, [[square wave|square]], [[triangle wave|triangle]], and [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] waveforms]]\n\n{{main|Fourier analysis}}\n\nIn 1822, French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] discovered that sinusoidal waves can be used as simple building blocks to describe and approximate any periodic waveform, including [[square wave]]s. Fourier used it as an analytical tool in the study of waves and heat flow. It is frequently used in [[signal processing]] and the statistical analysis of [[time series]].\n\n==Traveling and standing waves==\nSince sine waves propagate without changing form in distributed linear systems, they are often used to analyze [[wave]] propagation.  Sine waves traveling in two directions in space can be represented as\n\n:<math>u(t, x) = A \\sin(kx - \\omega t + \\varphi)</math>\n\nWhen two waves having the same amplitude and frequency, and traveling in opposite directions, [[superposition principle|superpose]] each other, then a [[standing wave]] pattern is created. Note that, on a plucked string, the interfering waves are the waves reflected from the fixed end points of the string. Therefore, standing waves occur only at certain frequencies, which are referred to as resonant frequencies and are composed of a fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. The resonant frequencies of a string are proportional to: the length between the fixed ends; the [[tension (physics)|tension]] of the string; and inversely proportional to the mass [[Linear_density|per unit length]] of the string.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Crest (physics)]]\n* [[Fourier transform]]\n* [[Harmonic series (mathematics)]]\n* [[Harmonic series (music)]]\n* [[Helmholtz equation]]\n* [[Instantaneous phase]]\n* [[Oscilloscope]]\n* [[Pure tone]]\n* [[Simple harmonic motion]]\n* [[Sinusoidal model]]\n* [[Wave (physics)]]\n* [[Wave equation]]\n<!--\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}-->\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Sinusoid |work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |title=Sinusoid |publisher=Springer |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}\n\n{{Waveforms}}\n\n[[Category:Trigonometry]]\n[[Category:Wave mechanics]]\n[[Category:Waves]]\n[[Category:Waveforms]]"

This can occur in surveying, astronomy, and also has military applications.\n\n===Astronomy===\n\nThe skinny triangle is frequently used in astronomy to measure the distance to [[solar system]] objects.  The base of the triangle is formed by the distance between two measuring stations and the angle ''θ'' is the [[parallax]] angle formed by the object as seen by the two stations.  This baseline is usually very long for best accuracy; in principle the stations could be on opposite sides of the [[Earth]].  However, this distance is still short compared to the distance to the object being measured (the height of the triangle) and the skinny triangle solution can be applied and still achieve great accuracy.  The alternative method of measuring the base angles is theoretically possible but not so accurate.  The base angles are very nearly right angles and would need to be measured with much greater precision than the parallax angle in order to get the same accuracy.<ref>Abell ''et al.'', p. 414</ref>\n\nThe same method of measuring parallax angles and applying the skinny triangle can be used to measure the distances to stars; at least the nearer ones.  In the case of stars however, a longer baseline than the diameter of the Earth is usually required.  Instead of using two stations on the baseline, two measurements are made from the same station at different times of year.  During the intervening period, the orbit of the Earth around the [[Sun]] moves the measuring station a great distance, so providing a very long baseline.  This baseline can be as long as the [[major axis]] of the Earth's orbit or, equivalently, two [[Astronomical unit]]s (AU).  The distance to a star with a parallax angle of only one [[arcsecond]] measured on a baseline of one AU is a unit known as the [[parsec]] (pc) in astronomy and is equal to about 3.26 [[light year]]s.<ref>Abell ''et al.'', inside front cover</ref>  There is an inverse relationship between the distance in parsecs and the angle in arcseconds.  For instance, two arcseconds corresponds to a distance of {{nowrap|0.5 pc}} and 0.5 arcsecond corresponds to a distance of two parsecs.<ref>Abell ''et al.'', pp. 414–416, 418–419</ref>\n\n===Gunnery===\n{{see also|Telemeter}}\n\nThe skinny triangle is useful in gunnery in that it allows a relationship to be calculated between the range and size of the target without the shooter needing to compute or look up any [[trigonometric functions]].  Military and hunting telescopic sights often have a [[reticle]] calibrated in [[milliradian]]s, in this context usually called just [[angular mil|mil]]s or mil-dots.  A target {{nowrap|1 metre}} in height and measuring {{nowrap|1 mil}} in the sight corresponds to a range of 1000 metres.  There is an inverse relationship between the angle measured in a sniper's sight and the distance to target.  For instance, if this same target measures {{nowrap|2 mils}} in the sight then the range is 500 metres.<ref name=Warlow87>Warlow, p. 87</ref>\n\nAnother unit which is sometimes used on gunsights is the [[minute of arc]] (MOA).  The distances corresponding to minutes of arc are not exact numbers in the [[metric system]] as they are with milliradians, however, there is a convenient approximate whole number correspondence in [[imperial units]].  A target {{nowrap|1 [[inch]]}} in height and measuring {{nowrap|1 MOA}} in the sight corresponds to a range of 100 [[yard]]s.<ref name=Warlow87/>  Or perhaps more usefully, a target 6 feet in height and measuring 4 MOA corresponds to a range of 1800 yards (just over a mile).\n\n===Aviation===\n\nA simple form of aviation navigation, [[dead reckoning]], relies on making estimates of wind speeds aloft over long distances to calculate a desired heading. Since predicted or reported wind speeds are rarely accurate, corrections to the aircraft's heading need to be made at regular intervals. Skinny triangles form the basis of the [[1 in 60 rule]], which is \"After travelling 60 miles, your heading is one degree off for every mile you're off course\". \"60\" is very close to 180 / π = 57.30.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Pendulum_(mathematics)#Infinitesimal_oscillations_of_a_pendulum|Infinitesimal oscillations of a pendulum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*George Ogden Abell, David Morrison, Sidney C.

      "text": "[[Image:SnellPotFigure1.png|right]]\nThe '''Snellius–Pothenot problem''' is a problem in planar [[surveying]].  Given three known points A, B and C, an observer at an unknown point P observes that the segment AC subtends an angle <math>\\alpha</math> and the segment CB subtends an angle  <math>\\beta</math>; the problem is to determine the position of the point P. (See figure; the point denoted C is between A and B as seen from P).\n\nSince it involves the observation of known points from an unknown point, the problem is an example of [[Resection (orientation)|resection]]. Historically it was first studied by [[Willebrord Snellius|Snellius]], who found a solution around 1615.\n\n==Formulating the equations==\n'''First equation'''\n\nDenoting the (unknown) angles ''CAP'' as ''x'' and ''CBP'' as ''y'' we get:\n\n:<math>x+y = 2 \\pi - \\alpha - \\beta - C</math>\n\nby using the sum of the angles formula for the [[quadrilateral]] ''PACB''.  The variable ''C'' represents the (known) internal angle in this quadrilateral at point ''C''.  (Note that in the case where the points ''C'' and ''P'' are on the same side of the line ''AB'', the angle C will be greater than <math>\\pi</math>).\n\n'''Second equation'''\n\nApplying the [[law of sines]] in triangles PAC and PBC we can express PC in two different ways:\n\n:<math>\\frac{{\\rm AC} \\sin x }{\\sin \\alpha} = {\\rm PC} = \\frac{{\\rm BC} \\sin y}{\\sin \\beta}.</math>\n\nA useful trick at this point is to define an auxiliary angle <math>\\phi</math> such that\n\n:<math>\\tan \\phi = \\frac{{\\rm BC} \\sin \\alpha}{{\\rm AC} \\sin \\beta}.</math>\n\n(A minor note: we should be concerned about division by zero, but consider that the problem is symmetric, so if one of the two given angles is zero we can, if needed, rename that angle alpha and call the other (non-zero) angle beta, reversing the roles of A and B as well.  This will suffice to guarantee that the ratio above is well defined. An alternative approach to the zero angle problem is given in the algorithm below.)\n\nWith this substitution the equation becomes\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sin x}{\\sin y}=\\tan \\phi.</math>\n\nWe can use two known [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]], namely\n\n:<math>\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\phi\\right) = \\frac{1- \\tan \\phi}{\\tan \\phi +1}</math> and\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\tan [(x-y)/2]}{\\tan [(x+y)/2]}=\\frac{\\sin x- \\sin y}{\\sin x + \\sin y}</math>\n\nto put this in the form of the second equation we need{{why?|date=June 2016}}\n\n:<math>\\tan \\frac{1}{2}(x-y) = \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha+\\beta+C) \\tan \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\phi\\right).</math>\n\nWe now need to solve these two equations in two unknowns. Once ''x'' and ''y'' are known the various triangles can be solved straightforwardly to determine the position of P.<ref>Bowser: A treatise</ref> The detailed procedure is shown below.\n\n==Solution algorithm==\nGiven are two lengths ''AC'' and ''BC'', and three angles <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\beta</math> and ''C'', the solution proceeds as follows.\n\n*calculate <math>\\phi= \\operatorname{atan2}( {\\rm BC} \\sin \\alpha, {\\rm AC} \\sin\\beta )</math>. Where [[atan2]] is a [[computer]] function, also called the arctangent of two arguments, that returns the arctangent of the ratio of the two values given. Note that in [[Microsoft Excel]] the two arguments are reversed, so the proper syntax would be '=atan2(AC*\\sin(beta),&nbsp;BC*\\sin(alpha))'. The atan2 function correctly handles the case where one of the two arguments is zero.\n*calculate <math>K = 2 \\pi -\\alpha-\\beta-C.</math>\n*calculate <math>W = 2\\cdot\\operatorname{atan}\\left[ \\tan(\\pi/4 - \\phi) \\tan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha+\\beta+C)\\right)\\right].</math>\n*find <math>x = (K+W)/2</math> and <math>y = (K-W)/2.</math>\n*if <math>|\\sin \\beta|>|\\sin \\alpha|</math> calculate <math>{\\rm PC} = \\frac{{\\rm BC} \\sin y}{\\sin \\beta}</math> else use <math>{\\rm PC} = \\frac{{\\rm AC} \\sin x}{\\sin \\alpha}.</math>\n*find <math>{\\rm PA} = \\sqrt{{\\rm AC}^2+{\\rm PC}^2 - 2\\cdot{\\rm AC}\\cdot{\\rm PC}\\cdot\\cos(\\pi-\\alpha-x)}.</math> (This comes from the [[law of cosines]].)\n*find <math>{\\rm PB} = \\sqrt{{\\rm BC}^2+{\\rm PC}^2 - 2\\cdot{\\rm BC}\\cdot{\\rm PC}\\cdot\\cos(\\pi-\\beta-y)}.</math>\n\nIf the coordinates of ''A'': ''x<sub>A</sub>,y<sub>A</sub>'' and ''C'': ''x<sub>C</sub>,y<sub>C</sub>'' are known in some appropriate Cartesian [[coordinate system]] then the coordinates of ''P'' can be found as well.\n\n==Geometric (graphical) solution==\nBy the [[inscribed angle theorem]] the locus of points from which AC subtends an angle <math>\\alpha</math> is a circle having its center on the midline of AC; from the center O of this circle AC subtends an angle <math>2 \\alpha</math>.  Similarly the locus of points from which CB subtends an angle <math>\\beta</math> is another circle. The desired point P is at the intersection of these two loci.\n\nTherefore, on a map or nautical chart showing the points A, B, C, the following graphical construction can be used:\n\n*Draw the segment AC, the midpoint M and the midline, which crosses AC perpendicularly at M.  On this line find the point O such that <math>MO=\\frac{AC}{2 \\tan \\alpha}</math>.

The triangle can be located on a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or on a [[sphere]]. Applications requiring triangle solutions include [[geodesy]], [[astronomy]], [[construction]], and [[navigation]].\n\n==Solving plane triangles==\n[[File:Triangle - angles, vertices, sides.svg|thumb|220px|right|<center>Standard notation for a triangle</center>]]\nA general form triangle has six main characteristics (see picture): three linear (side lengths {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}}) and three angular ({{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ''}}). The classical plane trigonometry problem is to specify three of the six characteristics and  determine the other three.  A triangle can be uniquely determined in this sense when given any of the following:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-triangles.html |title=Solving Triangles |publisher=Maths is Fun |accessdate=4 April 2012<!-- 6:37 (UTC)-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.horacemann.org/academics/math/pcbch/trig/triangle.html |title=Solving Triangles |publisher=web.horacemann.org |accessdate=4 April 2012<!-- 6:42 (UTC)--> |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107224746/http://web.horacemann.org/academics/math/pcbch/trig/triangle.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=}}</ref>\n\n*Three sides ('''SSS''')\n*Two sides and the included angle ('''SAS''')\n*Two sides and an angle not included between them ('''SSA'''), if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length.\n*A side and the two angles adjacent to it ('''ASA''')\n*A side, the angle opposite to it and an angle adjacent to it ('''AAS''').\n*Three angles ('''AAA''') on the sphere (but not in the plane).\n\nFor all cases in the plane, at least one of the side lengths must be specified. If only the angles are given, the side lengths cannot be determined, because any [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangle is a solution.\n\n===Trigonomic relations===\n[[File:Beliebiges Dreieck cen.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Overview of particular steps and tools used when solving plane triangles]]\nThe standard method of solving the problem is to use fundamental relations.\n;[[Law of cosines]]:\n:<math> a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c \\cos \\alpha </math>\n:<math> b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2 a c \\cos \\beta </math>\n:<math> c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \\cos \\gamma </math>\n;[[Law of sines]]:\n:<math>\\frac{a}{\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{b}{\\sin\\beta} = \\frac{c}{\\sin\\gamma}</math>\n;[[Sum of angles of a triangle|Sum of angles]]:\n:<math>\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ </math>\n;[[Law of tangents]]:\n:<math>\\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \\frac{\\tan[\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha-\\beta)]}{\\tan[\\frac 1 2 (\\alpha+\\beta)]}.</math>\nThere are other (sometimes practically useful) universal relations: the [[law of cotangents]] and [[Mollweide's formula]].\n\n====Notes====\n#To find an unknown angle, the [[law of cosines]] is safer than the [[law of sines]]. The reason is that the value of [[sine]] for the angle of the triangle does not uniquely determine this angle. For example, if {{math|sin ''β'' {{=}} 0.5}}, the angle {{math|''β''}} can equal either 30° or 150°. Using the law of cosines avoids this problem: within the interval from 0° to 180° the cosine value unambiguously determines its angle. On the other hand, if the angle is small (or close to 180°), then it is more robust numerically to determine it from its sine than its cosine because the arc-cosine function has a divergent derivative at 1 (or −1).\n#We assume that the relative position of specified characteristics is known. If not, the mirror reflection of the triangle will also be a solution. For example, three side lengths uniquely define either a triangle or its reflection.\n\n===Three sides given (SSS)===\n[[File:resolve triangle with a b c.png|thumb|right|250px|<center>Three sides given</center>]]\n\nLet three side lengths {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} be specified.

Assume that two sides {{math|''b'', ''c''}} and the angle {{math|''β''}} are known. The equation for the angle {{math|''γ''}} can be implied  from the [[law of sines]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-ssa-triangles.html |title=Solving SSA Triangles |publisher=Maths is Fun |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>\n:<math>\\sin\\gamma = \\frac c b \\sin\\beta.</math>\nWe denote further {{math|''D'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''b''}} sin ''β''}} (the equation's right side). There are four possible cases:\n#If {{math|''D'' > 1}}, no such triangle exists because the side {{math|''b''}} does not reach line {{math|''BC''}}. For the same reason a solution does not exist if the angle {{math|''β'' ≥ 90°}} and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''c''}}.\n#If {{math|''D'' {{=}} 1}}, a unique solution exists: {{math|''γ'' {{=}} 90°}}, i.e., the triangle is [[right triangle|right-angled]].\n# If {{math|''D'' < 1}} two alternatives are possible.\n## If {{math|''b'' ≥ ''c''}}, then {{math|''β'' ≥ ''γ''}} (the larger side corresponds to a larger angle). Since no triangle can have two obtuse angles, {{math|''γ''}} is an acute angle and the solution {{math|''γ'' {{=}} arcsin ''D''}} is unique.\n## If {{math|''b'' < ''c''}}, the angle {{math|''γ''}} may be acute: {{math|''γ'' {{=}} arcsin ''D''}} or obtuse: {{math|''γ′'' {{=}} 180° − ''γ''}}. The figure on right shows the point {{math|''C''}}, the side {{math|''b''}} and the angle {{math|''γ''}} as the first solution, and the point {{math|''C′''}}, side {{math|''b′''}} and the angle {{math|''γ′''}} as the second solution.\n\nOnce {{math|''γ''}} is obtained, the third angle {{math|''α'' {{=}} 180° − ''β'' − ''γ''}}.\n\nThe third side can then be found from the law of sines:\n:<math>a = b\\ \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{\\sin\\beta}</math>\n\nor\n:<math>a = c\\cos\\beta \\pm  \\sqrt{b^2 -c^2\\sin^2\\beta} </math>\n\n===A side and two adjacent angles given (ASA)===\n[[File:resolve triangle with c alpha beta.png|thumb|right|250px|<center>One side and two adjacent angles given</center>]]\n\nThe known characteristics are the side  {{math|''c''}} and the angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}}.

Posamentier and Lehmann<ref>Alfred S. Posamentier and Ingmar Lehmann, ''The Secrets of Triangles'', Prometheus Books, 2012: pp. 201–203.</ref> list the results for the question of solvability using no higher than square roots (i.e., [[Straightedge and compass construction|constructibility]]) for each of the 95 distinct cases; 63 of these are constructible.\n\n==Solving spherical triangles==\n[[File:Spherical triangle 3d opti.png|thumb|250 px|right|<center>Spherical triangle</center>]]\n\nThe general [[spherical triangle]] is fully determined by three of its six characteristics (3 sides and 3 angles). The lengths of the sides {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} of a spherical triangle are their [[central angle]]s, measured in angular units rather than linear units. (On a unit sphere, the angle (in [[radians]]) and length around the sphere are numerically the same. On other spheres, the angle (in radians) is equal to the length around the sphere divided by the radius.)\n\n[[Spherical geometry]] differs from planar [[Euclidean geometry]], so the solution of spherical triangles is built on different rules. For example, the [[sum of angles of a triangle|sum of the three angles]] {{math|''α'' + ''β'' + ''γ''}} depends on the size of the triangle. In addition, [[similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]] cannot be unequal, so the problem of constructing a triangle with specified three angles has a unique solution. The basic relations used to solve a problem are similar to those of the planar case: see [[Spherical law of cosines]] and [[Spherical law of sines]].\n\nAmong other relationships that may be useful are the [[half-side formula]] and [[Napier's analogies]]:<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NapiersAnalogies.html Napier's Analogies] at MathWorld</ref>\n*<math>\\tan\\frac c 2 \\cos\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta} 2  = \\tan\\frac{a+b}{2} \\cos\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}</math>\n*<math>\\tan\\frac c 2 \\sin\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta} 2  = \\tan\\frac{a-b} 2  \\sin\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta} 2</math>\n*<math>\\cot\\frac{\\gamma} 2 \\cos\\frac{a-b}{2} = \\tan\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta} 2 \\cos\\frac{a+b} 2</math>\n*<math>\\cot\\frac{\\gamma} 2 \\sin\\frac{a-b}{2} = \\tan\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta} 2 \\sin\\frac{a+b} 2.</math>\n\n[[File:Solve spherical triangle with a b c.png|thumb|right|250px|<center>Three sides given</center>]]\n\n===Three sides given (spherical SSS)===\nKnown: the sides {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} (in angular units).

It follows that <math>t = \\frac{\\sin \\varphi}{1+ \\cos \\varphi} = \\frac{\\sin \\varphi(1- \\cos \\varphi)}{(1+ \\cos \\varphi)(1- \\cos \\varphi)} = \\frac{1- \\cos \\varphi}{\\sin \\varphi}.</math>\n\n== The tangent half-angle substitution in integral calculus ==\n\n{{Main|Tangent half-angle substitution}}\n\nIn various applications of [[trigonometry]], it is useful to rewrite the [[trigonometric function]]s (such as [[sine]] and [[cosine]]) in terms of [[rational function]]s of a new variable {{math|''t''}}. These identities are known collectively as the '''tangent half-angle formulae''' because of the definition of {{math|''t''}}. These identities can be useful in [[calculus]] for converting rational functions in sine and cosine to functions of {{math|''t''}} in order to find their [[antiderivative]]s.\n\nTechnically, the existence of the tangent half-angle formulae stems from the fact that the [[circle]] is an [[algebraic curve]] of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] 0.  One then expects that the ''circular functions'' should be reducible to rational functions.\n\nGeometrically, the construction goes like this: for any point (cos φ, sin φ) on the [[unit circle]], draw the line passing through it and the point {{math|(−1, 0)}}. This point crosses the {{math|''y''}}-axis at some point {{math|1=''y'' = ''t''}}. One can show using simple geometry that {{math|1=''t'' = tan(φ/2)}}. The equation for the drawn line is {{math|1=''y'' = (1 + ''x'')''t''}}. The equation for the intersection of the line and circle is then a [[quadratic equation]] involving {{math|''t''}}. The two solutions to this equation are {{math|(−1, 0)}} and {{math|(cos ''φ'', sin ''φ'')}}.  This allows us to write the latter as rational functions of {{math|''t''}} (solutions are given below).\n\nNote also that the parameter {{math|''t''}} represents the [[stereographic projection]] of the point {{math|(cos ''φ'', sin ''φ'')}} onto the {{math|''y''}}-axis with the center of projection at {{math|(−1, 0)}}. Thus, the tangent half-angle formulae give conversions between the stereographic coordinate {{math|''t''}} on the unit circle and the standard angular coordinate {{math|''φ''}}.\n\nThen we have\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\cos\\varphi = \\frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2},\n& & \\sin\\varphi = \\frac{2t}{1 + t^2}, \\\\[8pt]\n& \\tan\\varphi = \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\n& & \\cot\\varphi = \\frac{1 - t^2}{2t}, \\\\[8pt]\n& \\sec\\varphi = \\frac{1 + t^2}{1 - t^2},\n& & \\csc\\varphi = \\frac{1 + t^2}{2t},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>e^{i \\varphi} = \\frac{1 + i t}{1 - i t}, \\qquad\ne^{-i \\varphi} = \\frac{1 - i t}{1 + i t}.\n</math>\n\nBy eliminating phi between the directly above and the initial definition of {{math|''t''}}, one arrives at the following useful relationship for the [[arctangent]] in terms of the [[natural logarithm]]\n:<math>\\arctan t = \\frac{1}{2i}\\ln\\frac{1+it}{1-it}.</math>\n\nIn [[calculus]], the Weierstrass substitution is used to find antiderivatives of [[rational functions]] of {{math|sin ''φ''}} and&nbsp;{{math|cos ''φ''}}.  After setting\n\n:<math>t=\\tan\\tfrac{1}{2}\\varphi.</math>\n\nThis implies that\n\n:<math>\\varphi=2\\arctan(t)+2\\pi n , </math>\n\nfor some integer {{math|''n''}}, and therefore\n\n:<math>d\\varphi = {{2\\,dt} \\over {1 + t^2}}.</math>\n\n==Hyperbolic identities==\nOne can play an entirely analogous game with the [[hyperbolic function]]s. A point on (the right branch of) a [[hyperbola]] is given by&nbsp;{{math|(cosh ''θ'', sinh ''θ'')}}. Projecting this onto {{math|''y''}}-axis from the center {{math|(−1, 0)}} gives the following:\n\n:<math>t = \\tanh\\tfrac{1}{2}\\theta = \\frac{\\sinh\\theta}{\\cosh\\theta+1} = \\frac{\\cosh\\theta-1}{\\sinh\\theta}</math>\n\nwith the identities\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\cosh\\theta = \\frac{1 + t^2}{1 - t^2},\n& & \\sinh\\theta = \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}, \\\\[8pt]\n& \\tanh\\theta = \\frac{2t}{1 + t^2},\n& & \\coth\\theta = \\frac{1 + t^2}{2t}, \\\\[8pt]\n& \\operatorname{sech}\\,\\theta = \\frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2},\n& & \\operatorname{csch}\\,\\theta = \\frac{1 - t^2}{2t},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>e^\\theta = \\frac{1 + t}{1 - t}, \\qquad\ne^{-\\theta} = \\frac{1 - t}{1 + t}.</math>\n\nThe use of this substitution for finding antiderivatives was introduced by [[Karl Weierstrass]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nFinding {{math|''θ''}} in terms of {{math|''t''}} leads to following relationship between the hyperbolic arctangent and the natural logarithm:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{artanh} t = \\frac 1 2 \\ln\\frac{1+t}{1-t}.</math>\n\n(\"ar-\" is used rather than \"arc-\" because \"arc\" is about arc length and \"ar\" abbreviates \"area\". It is the area between two rays and a hyperbola, rather than the arc length between two rays measure along an arc a circle.)\n\n==The Gudermannian function==\n{{Main|Gudermannian function}}\n\nComparing the hyperbolic identities to the circular ones, one notices that they involve the same functions of {{math|''t''}}, just permuted. If we identify the parameter {{math|''t''}} in both cases we arrive at a relationship between the circular functions and the hyperbolic ones. That is, if\n\n:<math>t = \\tan\\tfrac 1 2 \\varphi = \\tanh\\tfrac 1 2 \\theta</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>\\varphi = 2\\tan^{-1}\\tanh \\tfrac 1 2 \\theta \\equiv \\operatorname{gd} \\theta.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|gd(''θ'')}} is the [[Gudermannian function]]. The Gudermannian function gives a direct relationship between the circular functions and the hyperbolic ones that does not involve complex numbers. The above descriptions of the tangent half-angle formulae (projection the unit circle and standard hyperbola onto the {{math|''y''}}-axis) give a geometric interpretation of this function.\n\n==Pythagorean triples==\n{{main article|Pythagorean triple}}\nThe tangent of half of an acute angle of a [[right triangle]] whose sides are a Pythagorean triple will necessarily be a [[rational number]] in the interval {{math|(0, 1)}}.  Vice versa, when a half-angle tangent is a rational number in the interval {{math|(0, 1)}}, there is a right triangle that has the full angle and that has side lengths that are a Pythagorean triple.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of trigonometric identities]]\n*[[Half-side formula]]\n\n==External links==\n<!-- * {{springer|title=Tangent formula|id=p/t092150}} Invalid link. -->\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/TangentOfHalvedAngle.html ''Tangent Of Halved Angle''] at [[Planetmath]]\n \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tangent Half-Angle Formula}}\n[[Category:Trigonometry]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Mathematical identities]]"

First, the trigonometric functions of all angles that are integer multiples of those given can also be expressed in radicals, but some are omitted here.\n\nSecond, it is always possible to apply the half-angle formula to find an expression in radicals for a trigonometric function of one-half of any angle on the list, then half of that angle, etc.\n\nThird, expressions in real radicals exist for a trigonometric function of a rational multiple of {{pi}} if and only if the denominator of the fully reduced rational multiple is a power of 2 by itself or the product of a power of 2 with the product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s, of which the known ones are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537.\n\nFourth, this article only deals with trigonometric function values when the expression in radicals is in ''real'' radicals – roots of real numbers. Many other trigonometric function values are expressible in, for example, cube roots of [[complex number]]s that cannot be rewritten in terms of roots of real numbers. For example, the trigonometric function values of any angle that is one-third of an angle ''θ'' considered in this article can be expressed in cube roots and square roots by using the [[cubic equation|cubic equation formula]] to solve\n:<math>4\\cos^3 \\frac \\theta 3 - 3\\cos \\frac \\theta 3 = \\cos\\theta,</math>\n\nbut in general the solution for the cosine of the one-third angle involves the cube root of a complex number (giving ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'').\n\nIn practice, all values of sines, cosines, and tangents not found in this article are approximated using the techniques described at ''[[Trigonometric tables]]''.\n\n==Table of some common angles==\n<!-- copied from [[List of trigonometric identities#angles]]. -->\nSeveral different [[units of angle measure]] are widely used, including [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[radian]]s, and [[gradian]]s ([[gon (angle)<!-- deliberately going through redirect here -->|gon]]s):\n:1 full circle ([[turn (geometry)|turn]])&nbsp;=&nbsp;360&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;=&nbsp;2{{pi}} radians &nbsp;=&nbsp; 400 gons.\nThe following table shows the conversions and values for some common angles:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

(See [[List of trigonometric identities#Reflections, shifts, and periodicity|List of trigonometric identities]].)\n\nIn the entries below, when a certain number of degrees is related to a regular polygon, the relation is that the number of degrees in each angle of the polygon is (''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;2) times the indicated number of degrees (where ''n'' is the number of sides). This is because the sum of the angles of any ''n''-gon is 180°&nbsp;×&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;2) and so the measure of each angle of any regular ''n''-gon is 180°&nbsp;×&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;2)&nbsp;÷&nbsp;''n''. Thus for example the entry \"45°: square\" means that, with ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, 180°&nbsp;÷&nbsp;''n'' =&nbsp;45°, and the number of degrees in each angle of a square is (''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;2)&nbsp;×&nbsp;45° =&nbsp;90°.\n\n===0°: fundamental===\n:<math>\\sin 0=0\\,</math>\n:<math>\\cos 0=1\\,</math>\n:<math>\\tan 0=0\\,</math>\n:<math>\\cot 0\\text{ is

Therefore, the correct sign to use depends on the value of θ.\n\nFor the tan function, the equation is:\n\n:<math>\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\pm\\, \\sqrt\\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}.</math>\n\nThen multiplying the numerator and denominator inside the square root by (1 + cos θ) and using Pythagorean identities leads to:\n\n:<math>\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}.</math>\n\nAlso, if the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by (1 - cos θ), the result is:\n\n:<math>\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}.</math>\n\nThis also gives:\n\n:<math>\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\csc \\theta - \\cot \\theta.</math>\n\nSimilar manipulations for the cot function give:\n\n:<math>\\cot \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\pm\\, \\sqrt\\frac{1 + \\cos \\theta}{1 -

      "title": "Trigonometric interpolation",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''trigonometric interpolation''' is [[interpolation]] with [[trigonometric polynomial]]s. Interpolation is the process of finding a function which goes through some given [[data points]]. For trigonometric interpolation, this function has to be a trigonometric polynomial, that is, a sum of [[trigonometric function|sines and cosines]] of given periods. This form is especially suited for interpolation of [[periodic function]]s.\n\nAn important special case is when the given data points are equally spaced, in which case the solution is given by the [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\n==Formulation of the interpolation problem==\nA trigonometric polynomial of degree ''K'' has the form\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> p(x) = a_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^K a_k \\cos(kx) + \\sum_{k=1}^K b_k \\sin(kx). \\,  </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nThis expression contains 2''K'' + 1 coefficients, ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, … ''a''<sub>''K''</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''b''<sub>''K''</sub>, and we wish to compute those coefficients so that the function passes through ''N'' points:\n:<math> p(x_n) = y_n, \\quad n=0, \\ldots, N-1. \\, </math>\nSince the trigonometric polynomial is periodic with period 2π, the ''N'' points can be distributed and ordered in one period as \n:<math> 0 \\leq x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots  < x_{N-1} < 2  \\pi. \\, </math>\n(Note that we do ''not'' in general require these points to be equally spaced.) The interpolation problem is now to find coefficients such that the trigonometric polynomial ''p'' satisfies the interpolation conditions.\n\n==Formulation in the complex plane==\nThe problem becomes more natural if we formulate it in the [[complex plane]]. We can rewrite the formula for a trigonometric polynomial as\n<math> p(x) = \\sum_{k=-K}^K c_k e^{ikx}, \\, </math>\nwhere ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. If we set ''z'' = ''e''<sup>''ix''</sup>, then this becomes\n:<math> q(z) = \\sum_{k=-K}^K c_k z^{k}, \\, </math>\nwith\n:<math> q(e^{ix}) \\triangleq p(x). \\, </math>\nThis reduces the problem of trigonometric interpolation to that of polynomial interpolation on the [[unit circle]]. Existence and uniqueness for trigonometric interpolation now follows immediately from the corresponding results for polynomial interpolation.\n\nFor more information on formulation of trigonometric interpolating polynomials in the complex plane, see p.&nbsp;135 of [http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~restrepo/475A/Notes/sourcea.pdf Interpolation using Fourier Polynomials].\n\n==Solution of the problem==\nUnder the above conditions, there exists a solution to the problem for ''any'' given set of data points {''x''<sub>''k''</sub>, ''y''<sub>''k''</sub>} as long as ''N'', the number of data points, is not larger than the number of coefficients in the polynomial, i.e., ''N''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;2''K''+1  (a solution may or may not exist if ''N''>2''K''+1 depending upon the particular set of data points). Moreover, the  interpolating polynomial is unique if and only if the number of adjustable coefficients is equal to the number of data points, i.e., ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''K''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. In the remainder of this article, we will assume this condition to hold true.\n\n===Odd number of points===\nIf the number of points ''N'' is odd, say ''N=2K+1'', applying the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation]] to the polynomial formulation in the complex plane yields that the solution can be written in the form\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2K} y_k\\,t_k(x),</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\nwhere\n:<math> t_k(x) = e^{-iKx+iKx_k} \\prod_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K} \\frac{e^{ix}-e^{ix_m}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{ix_m}}.</math>\nThe factor  <math>e^{-iKx+iKx_k}</math> in this formula compensates for the fact that the complex plane formulation contains also negative powers of <math>e^{ix}</math> and is therefore not a polynomial expression in <math>e^{ix}</math>. The correctness of this expression can easily be verified by observing that <math>t_k(x_k)=1</math> and that <math>t_k(x)</math> is a linear combination of the right powers of <math>e^{ix}</math>.\nUpon using the identity\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>e^{iz_1}-e^{iz_2}=2i\\sin\\left(\\frac{z_1-z_2}{2}\\right)e^{i\\frac12 z_1+i\\frac12 z_2},</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\nthe coefficient <math>t_k(x)</math> can be written in the form\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> t_k(x) = \\prod_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K} \\frac{\\sin\\frac12(x-x_m)}{\\sin\\frac12(x_k-x_m)}.</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\n===Even number of points===\nIf the number of points ''N'' is even, say ''N=2K'', applying the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation]] to the polynomial formulation in the complex plane yields that the solution can be written in the form\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2K-1} y_k\\,t_k(x),</math>|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\nwhere\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> t_k(x) = e^{-iKx+iKx_k} \\frac{e^{ix}-e^{i\\alpha_k}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{i\\alpha_k}} \\prod_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K-1} \\frac{e^{ix}-e^{ix_m}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{ix_m}}.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nHere, the constants <math>\\alpha_k</math> can be chosen freely. This is caused by the fact that the interpolating function ({{EquationNote|1}}) contains an odd number of unknown constants. A common choice is to require that the highest frequency is of the form a constant times <math>\\cos(Kx)</math>, i.e. the <math>\\sin(Kx)</math> term vanishes, but in general the phase of the highest frequency can be chosen to be <math>\\varphi_K</math>. To get an expression for <math>\\alpha_k</math>, we obtain by using ({{EquationNote|2}}) that ({{EquationNote|3}}) can we written in the form\n:<math> t_k(x) = \\frac{\\cos\\left(Kx-\\frac12\\alpha_k+\\frac12\\sum\\limits_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K-1} x_m\\right)+\\sum\\limits_{m=-(K-1)}^{K-1}c_k e^{imx}}{2^N\\sin(\\frac{x_k-\\alpha_k}{2})\\prod\\limits_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K-1}\\sin(\\frac{x_k-x_m}{2})}.</math>\nThis yields\n:<math>\\alpha_k=\\sum_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K-1} x_m - 2 \\varphi_K</math>\nand\n:<math> t_k(x) = \\frac{\\sin\\frac12(x-\\alpha_k)}{\\sin\\frac12(x_k-\\alpha_k)}\\prod_{m=0,m\\ne k}^{2K-1} \\frac{\\sin\\frac12(x-x_m)}{\\sin\\frac12(x_k-x_m)}.</math>\n\nNote that care must be taken in order to avoid infinities caused by zeros in the denominators.\n\n==Equidistant nodes==\nFurther simplification of the problem is possible if nodes <math>x_m</math> are equidistant, i.e.\n:<math>x_m=\\frac{2\\pi m}{N},</math>\nsee Zygmund for more details.\n\n===Odd number of points===\nFurther simplification by using ({{EquationNote|4}}) would be an obvious approach, but is obviously involved. A much simpler approach is to consider the [[Dirichlet kernel]]\n:<math>D(x,N)=\\frac{1}{N} +\\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\frac12 (N-1)}\\cos(kx) = \\frac{\\sin\\frac12 Nx}{N\\sin\\frac12 x},</math>\nwhere <math>N>0</math> is odd. It can easily be seen that <math>D(x,N)</math> is a linear combination of the right powers of <math>e^{ix}</math> and satisfies\n:<math>D(x_m,N)=\\begin{cases}0\\text{ for } m\\neq0 \\\\1\\text{ for } m=0\\end{cases}.</math>\nSince these two properties uniquely define the coefficients <math>t_k(x)</math> in ({{EquationNote|5}}), it follows that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nt_k(x) &= D(x-x_k,N)=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\sin\\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{N\\sin\\frac12 (x-x_k)} \\text{ for } x\\neq x_k\\\\\n\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin\\frac12 Nx}{N\\sin\\frac12 x}=1 \\text{ for } x= x_k\n\\end{cases}\\\\&= \\frac{\\mathrm{sinc}\\,\\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{\\mathrm{sinc}\\,\\frac12 (x-x_k)}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nHere, the [[sinc]]-function prevents any singularities and is defined by\n:<math> \\mathrm{sinc}\\,x=\\frac{\\sin x}{x}.</math>\n\n===Even number of points===\nFor <math>N</math> even, we define the Dirichlet kernel as\n:<math>D(x,N)=\\frac{1}{N} +\\frac{1}{N}\\cos \\frac12 Nx + \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\frac12 N-1}\\cos(kx) = \\frac{\\sin\\frac12 Nx}{N\\tan\\frac12 x}.</math>\nAgain, it can easily be seen that <math>D(x,N)</math> is a linear combination of the right powers of <math>e^{ix}</math>, does not contain the term <math> \\sin \\frac12 Nx </math> and satisfies\n:<math>D(x_m,N)=\\begin{cases}0\\text{ for } m\\neq0 \\\\1\\text{ for } m=0\\end{cases}.</math>\nUsing these properties, it follows that the coefficients <math>t_k(x)</math> in ({{EquationNote|6}}) are given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nt_k(x) &= D(x-x_k,N)=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\sin\\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{N\\tan\\frac12 (x-x_k)}\\text{ for } x\\neq x_k\\\\\n\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin\\frac12 Nx}{N\\tan\\frac12 x}=1 \\text{ for } x= x_k.\n\\end{cases}\\\\&= \\frac{\\mathrm{sinc}\\,\\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{N \\mathrm{sinc}\\,\\frac12 (x-x_k)}\\cos\\frac12 (x-x_k)\n\\end{align}</math>\nNote that <math>t_k(x)</math> does not contain the <math> \\sin \\frac12 Nx </math> as well. Finally, note that the function <math> \\sin \\frac12 Nx </math> vanishes at all the points <math>x_m</math>. Multiples of this term can, therefore, always be added, but it is commonly left out.\n\n===Implementation===\nA MATLAB implementation of the above can be found [http://www.math.udel.edu/~braun/M428/Matlab/interpolation/triginterp.m here] and is given by:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nfunction P = triginterp(xi,x,y)\n% TRIGINTERP Trigonometric interpolation.\n% Input:\n%   xi  evaluation points for the interpolant (vector)\n%   x   equispaced interpolation nodes (vector, length N)\n%   y   interpolation values (vector, length N)\n% Output:\n%   P   values of the trigonometric interpolant (vector)\nN = length(x);\n% Adjust the spacing of the given independent variable.\nh = 2/N;\nscale = (x(2)-x(1)) / h;\nx = x/scale;  xi = xi/scale;\n% Evaluate interpolant.\nP = zeros(size(xi));\nfor k = 1:N\n  P = P + y(k)*trigcardinal(xi-x(k),N);\nend\n\nfunction tau = trigcardinal(x,N)\nws = warning('off','MATLAB:divideByZero');\n% Form is different for even and odd N.\nif rem(N,2)==1   % odd\n  tau = sin(N*pi*x/2) ./ (N*sin(pi*x/2));\nelse             % even\n  tau = sin(N*pi*x/2) ./ (N*tan(pi*x/2));\nend\nwarning(ws)\ntau(x==0) = 1;     % fix value at x=0\n</source>\n\n===Relation with the discrete Fourier transform===\nThe special case in which the points ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are equally spaced is especially important. In this case, we have\n:<math> x_n = 2 \\pi \\frac{n}{N}, \\qquad 0 \\leq n < N.</math>\n\nThe transformation that maps the data points ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> to the coefficients ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>, ''b''<sub>''k''</sub> is obtained from the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of order&nbsp;N.\n\n:<math> Y_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y_n \\ e^{-i 2 \\pi \\frac{nk}{N}} \\, </math>\n\n:<math> y_n = p(x_n) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} Y_k \\ e^{i 2 \\pi \\frac{nk}{N}} \\, </math>\n\n(Because of the way the problem was formulated above, we have restricted ourselves to odd numbers of points.  This is not strictly necessary; for even numbers of points, one includes another cosine term corresponding to the [[Nyquist frequency]].)\n\nThe case of the cosine-only interpolation for equally spaced points, corresponding to a trigonometric interpolation when the points have [[Even and odd functions|even symmetry]], was treated by [[Alexis Clairaut]] in 1754.  In this case the solution is equivalent to a [[discrete cosine transform]].  The sine-only expansion for equally spaced points, corresponding to odd symmetry, was solved by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] in 1762, for which the solution is a [[discrete sine transform]].  The full cosine and sine interpolating polynomial, which gives rise to the DFT, was solved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in unpublished work around 1805, at which point he also derived a [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|fast Fourier transform]] algorithm to evaluate it rapidly. Clairaut, Lagrange, and Gauss were all concerned with studying the problem of inferring the [[orbit]] of [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, etc., from a finite set of observation points; since the orbits are periodic, a trigonometric interpolation was a natural choice.  See also Heideman ''et al.'' (1984).\n\n==Applications in numerical computing==\n[[Chebfun]], a fully integrated software system written in MATLAB for computing with functions, uses trigonometric interpolation and Fourier expansions for computing with periodic functions. Many algorithms related to trigonometric interpolation are readily available in [[Chebfun]]; several examples are available [http://www.chebfun.org/docs/guide/guide11.html here].\n\n==References==\n* Kendall E.

In the complex case the trigonometric polynomials are spanned by the positive and negative powers of ''e''<sup>''ix''</sup>.\n\n==Formal definition==\nAny function ''T'' of the form\n\n:<math>T(x) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \\cos (nx) + i\\sum_{n=1}^N b_n \\sin(nx) \\qquad (x \\in \\mathbb{R})</math>\n\nwith <math>a_n, b_n \\in \\mathbb{C}</math> for <math>0 \\leq n \\leq N</math>, is called a '''complex trigonometric polynomial''' of degree ''N'' {{harv|Rudin|1987|p=88}}. Using [[Euler's formula]] the polynomial can be rewritten as\n\n:<math>T(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^N c_n e^{inx} \\qquad (x \\in \\mathbb{R}).</math>\n\nAnalogously, letting <math>a_n,  b_n \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\quad 0 \\leq n \\leq N</math> and <math>a_N \\neq 0</math> or <math>b_N \\neq 0</math>, then\n\n:<math>t(x) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \\cos (nx) + \\sum_{n=1}^N b_n \\sin(nx) \\qquad (x \\in \\mathbb{R})</math>\n\nis called a '''real trigonometric polynomial''' of degree ''N'' {{harv|Powell|1981|p=150}}.\n\n==Properties==\n\nA trigonometric polynomial can be considered a [[periodic function]] on the [[real line]], with [[Periodic function|period]] some multiple of 2{{pi}}, or as a function on the [[unit circle]].\n\nA basic result is that the trigonometric polynomials are [[dense set|dense]] in the space of [[continuous function]]s on the unit circle, with the [[uniform norm]] {{harv|Rudin|1987|loc=Thm 4.25}}; this is a special case of the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]]. More concretely, for every continuous function ''f'' and every ''&epsilon;'' > 0, there exists a trigonometric polynomial ''T'' such that |''f''(''z'') &minus; T(''z'')| < ''&epsilon;'' for all ''z''. [[Fejér's theorem]] states that the arithmetic means of the partial sums of the [[Fourier series]] of ''f'' converge uniformly to ''f'', provided ''f'' is continuous on the circle, thus giving an explicit way to find an approximating trigonometric polynomial ''T''.\n\nA trigonometric polynomial of degree ''N'' has a maximum of 2''N'' roots in any open interval <nowiki>[</nowiki>''a'', ''a'' + 2{{pi}}<nowiki>)</nowiki> with a in '''R''', unless it is the zero function {{harv|Powell|1981|p=150}}.\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Powell | first1=Michael J.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_tables",
      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=December 2018}}\n{{Trigonometry}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], tables of [[trigonometric function]]s are useful in a number of areas. Before the existence of [[pocket calculator]]s, '''trigonometric tables''' were essential for [[navigation]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. The calculation of [[mathematical table]]s was an important area of study, which led to the development of the [[history of computing|first mechanical computing devices]].\n\nModern computers and pocket calculators now generate trigonometric function values on demand, using special libraries of mathematical code. Often, these libraries use pre-calculated tables internally, and compute the required value by using an appropriate [[interpolation]] method. Interpolation of simple look-up tables of trigonometric functions is still used in [[computer graphics]], where only modest accuracy may be required and speed is often paramount.\n\nAnother important application of trigonometric tables and generation schemes is for [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms, where the same trigonometric function values (called ''twiddle factors'') must be evaluated many times in a given transform, especially in the common case where many transforms of the same size are computed. In this case, calling generic library routines every time is unacceptably slow. One option is to call the library routines once, to build up a table of those trigonometric values that will be needed, but this requires significant memory to store the table. The other possibility, since a regular sequence of values is required, is to use a recurrence formula to compute the trigonometric values on the fly. Significant research has been devoted to finding accurate, stable recurrence schemes in order to preserve the accuracy of the FFT (which is very sensitive to trigonometric errors).\n\n== On-demand computation ==\n[[File:Bernegger Manuale 137.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A page from a 1619 book of [[mathematical table]]s.]]\n\nModern computers and calculators use a variety of techniques to provide trigonometric function values on demand for arbitrary angles (Kantabutra, 1996). One common method, especially on higher-end processors with [[Floating point|floating-point]] units, is to combine a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function|rational]] [[approximation theory|approximation]] (such as [[Chebyshev approximation]], best uniform approximation, and [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]], and typically for higher or variable precisions, [[Taylor series|Taylor]] and [[Laurent series]]) with range reduction and a table lookup &mdash; they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Maintaining precision while performing such interpolation is nontrivial, however; and methods like [[Gal's accurate tables]], Cody and Waite reduction, and Payne and Hanek reduction algorithms can be used for this purpose. On simpler devices that lack a [[hardware multiplier]], there is an algorithm called [[CORDIC]] (as well as related techniques) that is more efficient, since it uses only [[shift operator|shift]]s and additions. All of these methods are commonly implemented in [[computer hardware|hardware]] for performance reasons.\n\nThe particular polynomial used to approximate a trig function is generated ahead of time using some approximation of a [[minimax approximation algorithm]].\n\nFor [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|very high precision]] calculations, when series-expansion convergence becomes too slow, trigonometric functions can be approximated by the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], which itself approximates the trigonometric function by the ([[complex number|complex]]) [[elliptic integral]] (Brent, 1976).\n\nTrigonometric functions of angles that are [[rational number|rational]] multiples of 2π are [[algebraic number]]s. The values for ''a/b·2π'' can be found by applying [[de Moivre's identity]] for ''n = a'' to a ''b<sup>th</sup>'' [[root of unity]], which is also a root of the polynomial ''x<sup>b</sup> - 1'' in the [[complex plane]].  For example, the cosine and sine of 2π&nbsp;⋅&nbsp;5/37 are the [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s, respectively, of the 5th power of the 37th root of unity cos(2π/37) + sin(2π/37)i, which is a root of the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]-37 polynomial ''x''<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. For this case, a root-finding algorithm such as [[Newton's method]] is much simpler than the arithmetic-geometric mean algorithms above while converging at a similar asymptotic rate. The latter algorithms are required for [[transcendental number|transcendental]] trigonometric constants, however.\n\n== Half-angle and angle-addition formulas ==\n\nHistorically, the earliest method by which trigonometric tables were computed, and probably the most common until the advent of computers, was to repeatedly apply the half-angle and angle-addition [[Trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] starting from a known value (such as sin(π/2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, cos(π/2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0). This method was used by the ancient astronomer [[Ptolemy]], who derived them in the ''[[Almagest]]'', a treatise on astronomy. In modern form, the identities he derived are stated as follows (with signs determined by the quadrant in which ''x'' lies;\n\n:<math>\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos x)}</math>\n\n:<math>\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos x)}</math>\n\n:<math>\\sin(x \\pm y) = \\sin(x) \\cos(y) \\pm \\cos(x) \\sin(y)\\,</math>\n\n:<math>\\cos(x \\pm y) = \\cos(x) \\cos(y) \\mp \\sin(x) \\sin(y)\\,</math>\n\nThese were used to construct [[Ptolemy's table of chords]], which was applied to astronomical problems.\n\nVarious other permutations on these identities are possible: for example, some early trigonometric tables used not sine and cosine, but sine and [[versine]]).\n\n== A quick, but inaccurate, approximation ==\n\nA quick, but inaccurate, algorithm for calculating a table of ''N'' approximations ''s''<sub>''n''</sub> for [[sine|sin]](2[[Pi|&pi;]]''n''/''N'') and ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> for [[cosine|cos]](2π''n''/''N'') is:\n\n:''s''<sub>0</sub> = 0\n:''c''<sub>0</sub> = 1\n:''s''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''s''<sub>''n''</sub> + ''d'' &times; ''c''<sub>''n''</sub>\n:''c''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> &minus; ''d'' &times; ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>\nfor ''n'' = 0,...,''N''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, where ''d'' = 2π/''N''.\n\nThis is simply the [[Numerical ordinary differential equations#Euler method|Euler method]] for integrating the [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>ds/dt = c</math>\n:<math>dc/dt = -s</math>\n\nwith initial conditions ''s''(0) = 0 and ''c''(0) = 1, whose analytical solution is ''s'' = sin(''t'') and ''c'' = cos(''t'').\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a useful algorithm for generating sine tables because it has a significant error, proportional to 1/''N''.\n\nFor example, for ''N'' = 256 the maximum error in the sine values is ~0.061 (''s''<sub>202</sub> = &minus;1.0368 instead of &minus;0.9757). For ''N'' = 1024, the maximum error in the sine values is ~0.015 (''s''<sub>803</sub> = &minus;0.99321 instead of &minus;0.97832), about 4 times smaller. If the sine and cosine values obtained were to be plotted, this algorithm would draw a logarithmic spiral rather than a circle.\n\n== A better, but still imperfect, recurrence formula ==\n{{original research|date=December 2018}}\n\nA simple recurrence formula to generate trigonometric tables is based on [[Euler's formula]] and the relation:\n\n:<math>e^{i(\\theta + \\Delta)} = e^{i\\theta} \\times e^{i\\Delta\\theta}</math>\n\nThis leads to the following recurrence to compute trigonometric values ''s''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> as above:\n\n:''c''<sub>0</sub> = 1\n:''s''<sub>0</sub> = 0\n:''c''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''w''<sub>''r''</sub> ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> &minus; ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>\n:''s''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> + ''w''<sub>''r''</sub> ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>\nfor ''n'' = 0, ..., ''N''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, where ''w''<sub>''r''</sub> = cos(2π/''N'') and ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> = sin(2π/''N''). These two starting trigonometric values are usually computed using existing library functions (but could also be found e.g. by employing [[Newton's method]] in the complex plane to solve for the primitive [[root of unity|root]] of ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1).\n\nThis method would produce an ''exact'' table in exact arithmetic, but has errors in finite-precision [[floating-point]] arithmetic. In fact, the errors grow as O(ε&nbsp;''N'') (in both the worst and average cases), where ε is the floating-point precision.\n\nA significant improvement is to use the following modification to the above, a trick (due to Singleton, 1967) often used to generate trigonometric values for FFT implementations:\n\n:''c''<sub>0</sub> = 1\n:''s''<sub>0</sub> = 0\n:''c''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''c''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(&alpha; ''c''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;&beta; ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>)\n:''s''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(&beta;&nbsp;''c''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&alpha;&nbsp;''s''<sub>''n''</sub>)\n\nwhere α = 2&nbsp;sin<sup>2</sup>(π/''N'') and β = sin(2π/''N''). The errors of this method are much smaller, O(ε&nbsp;√''N'') on average and O(ε&nbsp;''N'') in the worst case, but this is still large enough to substantially degrade the accuracy of FFTs of large sizes.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Numerical analysis]]\n* [[CORDIC]]\n* [[Exact trigonometric constants]]\n* [[Aryabhata's sine table]]\n* [[Madhava's sine table]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Carl B.

In [[quantum mechanics]], this is referred to as [[phase factor]].\n\n[[File:Unitycircle-complex.gif|thumb|Animation of the unit circle with angles(Click to view)]]\n\n==Trigonometric functions on the unit circle==\n[[Image:Circle-trig6.svg|right|thumb|300px|All of the trigonometric functions of the angle {{math|''θ''}} (theta) can be constructed geometrically in terms of a unit circle centered at ''O''.]]\n[[File:Periodic sine.PNG|thumb|Sine function on unit circle (top) and its graph (bottom)]]\nThe [[trigonometric function]]s cosine and sine of angle {{math|''θ''}} may be defined on the unit circle as follows: If {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is a point on the unit circle, and if the ray from the origin (0, 0) to {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} makes an [[angle]] {{math|''θ''}} from the positive {{math|''x''}}-axis, (where counterclockwise turning is positive), then\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta = x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sin \\theta = y.</math>\n\nThe equation {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}} gives the relation\n\n:<math> \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1.</math>\n\nThe unit circle also demonstrates that [[sine]] and [[cosine]] are [[periodic function]]s, with the identities\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta = \\cos(2\\pi k+\\theta)</math>\n:<math>\\sin \\theta = \\sin(2\\pi k+\\theta)</math>\nfor any [[integer]] {{math|''k''}}.\n\nTriangles constructed on the unit circle can also be used to illustrate the periodicity of the trigonometric functions. First, construct a radius OA from the origin to a point {{math|P(''x''<sub>1</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} on the unit circle such that an angle {{math|''t''}} with {{math|0 < ''t'' < {{sfrac|π|2}}}} is formed with the positive arm of the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Now consider a point {{math|Q(''x''<sub>1</sub>,0)}} and line segments {{math|PQ ⊥ OQ}}. The result is a right triangle {{math|△OPQ}} with {{math|∠QOP {{=}} ''t''}}. Because {{math|PQ}} has length {{math|''y''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|OQ}} length {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, and {{math|OA}} length 1, {{math|sin(''t'') {{=}} ''y''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|cos(''t'') {{=}} ''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Having established these equivalences, take another radius OR from the origin to a point  {{math|R(−''x''<sub>1</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} on the circle such that the same angle {{math|''t''}} is formed with the negative arm of the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Now consider a point {{math|S(−''x''<sub>1</sub>,0)}} and line segments {{math|RS ⊥ OS}}. The result is a right triangle {{math|△ORS}} with {{math|∠SOR {{=}} ''t''}}. It can hence be seen that, because {{math|∠ROQ {{=}} π − ''t''}}, {{math|R}} is at {{math|(cos(π − ''t''),sin(π − ''t''))}} in the same way that P is at {{math|(cos(''t''),sin(''t''))}}. The conclusion is that, since  {{math|(−''x''<sub>1</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} is the same as {{math|(cos(π − ''t''),sin(π − ''t''))}} and {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} is the same as {{math|(cos(''t''),sin(''t''))}}, it is true that {{math|sin(''t'') {{=}} sin(π − ''t'')}} and {{math|−cos(''t'') {{=}} cos(π − ''t'')}}. It may be inferred in a similar manner that {{math|tan(π − ''t'') {{=}} −tan(''t'')}}, since {{math|tan(''t'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''y''<sub>1</sub>|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}}} and {{math|tan(π − ''t'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''y''<sub>1</sub>|−''x''<sub>1</sub>}}}}. A simple demonstration of the above can be seen in the equality {{math|sin({{sfrac|π|4}}) {{=}} sin({{sfrac|3π|4}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|2}}}}}}.\n\nWhen working with right triangles, sine, cosine, and other trigonometric functions only make sense for angle measures more than zero and less than {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}. However, when defined with the unit circle, these functions produce meaningful values for any [[real number|real]]-valued angle measure&nbsp;– even those greater than 2{{pi}}. In fact, all six standard trigonometric functions&nbsp;– sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, as well as archaic functions like [[versine]] and [[exsecant]]&nbsp;– can be defined geometrically in terms of a unit circle, as shown at right.\n\nUsing the unit circle, the values of any trigonometric function for many angles other than those labeled can be calculated without the use of a calculator by using the [[Trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|angle sum and difference formulas]].\n\n[[Image:Unit circle angles color.svg|thumb|300px|left|The unit circle, showing [[Exact trigonometric constants|coordinates of certain points]]]] <!--Get a picture with the tangent values show-->\n\n==Circle group==\n{{Main|Circle group}}\n[[Complex number]]s can be identified with points in the [[Euclidean plane]], namely the number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is identified with the point {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}.

The mathematical topics of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transforms]] rely heavily on knowledge of trigonometric functions and find application in a number of areas, including [[statistics]].'''\n\n=='''''<u>Thomas Paine's statement</u>'''''==\n\nIn Chapter XI of [[The Age of Reason]], the American revolutionary and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinker [[Thomas Paine]] wrote:<ref>{{cite book |title=The Age of Reason |first1=Paine |last1=Thomas |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2004 |isbn= |page=52 |url=http://manybooks.net/pages/painethoetext03twtp410/51.html}}</ref> \n\n:''The scientific principles that man employs to obtain the foreknowledge of an eclipse, or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are contained chiefly in that part of science that is called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies, is called astronomy; when applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a ruler and compass, it is called geometry; when applied to the construction of plans of edifices, it is called architecture; when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth, it is called land-surveying. In fine, it is the soul of science. It is an eternal truth: it contains the ''mathematical demonstration'' of which man speaks, and the extent of its uses are unknown.\n\n=='''''<u>History</u>'''''==\n\n==='''''Great Trigonometrical Survey'''''===\n\n{{Main| Great Trigonometrical Survey}}\n\nFrom 1802 until 1871 , the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] was a project to survey the Indian subcontinent with high precision. Starting from the coastal baseline, mathematicians and geographers triangulated vast distances across the country. One of the key achievements was measuring the height of Himalayan mountains, and determining that [[Mount Everest]] is the highest point on Earth. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://mathigon.org/course/triangles-and-trigonometry/introduction#full | title=Triangles and Trigonometry | website=Mathigon | access-date= 2019-02-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Historical use for multiplication===\n\nFor the 25 years preceding the invention of the [[logarithm]] in 1614, [[prosthaphaeresis]] was the only known generally applicable way of approximating products quickly. It used the identities for the trigonometric functions of sums and differences of angles in terms of the products of trigonometric functions of those angles.\n\n=='''''<u>Some modern uses</u>'''''==\n\nScientific fields that make use of trigonometry include:\n\n:[[acoustics]], [[architecture]], [[astronomy]], [[cartography]], [[civil engineering]], [[geophysics]], [[crystallography]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], land [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], many [[physical science]]s, [[mechanical engineering]], [[machining]], [[medical imaging]], [[number theory]], [[oceanography]], [[optics]], [[pharmacology]], [[probability theory]], [[seismology]], [[statistics]], and [[visual perception]]\n\nThat these fields involve trigonometry does not mean knowledge of trigonometry is needed in order to learn anything about them. It ''does'' mean that ''some'' things in these fields cannot be understood without trigonometry. For example, a professor of [[music]] may perhaps know nothing of mathematics, but would probably know that [[Pythagoras]] was the earliest known contributor to the mathematical theory of music.\n\nIn ''some'' of the fields of endeavor listed above it is easy to imagine how trigonometry could be used. For example, in navigation and land surveying, the occasions for the use of trigonometry are in at least some cases simple enough that they can be described in a beginning trigonometry textbook. In the case of music theory, the application of trigonometry is related to work begun by Pythagoras, who observed that the sounds made by plucking two strings of different lengths are consonant if both lengths are small integer multiples of a common length. The resemblance between the shape of a vibrating string and the graph of the [[sine]] function is no mere coincidence. In oceanography, the resemblance between the shapes of some [[wave]]s and the graph of the sine function is also not coincidental. In some other fields, among them [[climatology]], biology, and economics, there are seasonal periodicities. The study of these often involves the periodic nature of the sine and cosine function.\n\n===Fourier series===\n\nMany fields make use of trigonometry in more advanced ways than can be discussed in a single article. Often those involve what are called [[Fourier series]], after the 18th- and 19th-century French mathematician and physicist [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Joseph Fourier]]. Fourier series have a surprisingly diverse array of applications in many scientific fields, in particular in all of the phenomena involving seasonal periodicities mentioned above, and in wave motion, and hence in the study of radiation, of acoustics, of seismology, of modulation of radio waves in electronics, and of electric power engineering.\n\nA Fourier series is a sum of this form:\n\n: <math> \\square + \\underbrace{\\square \\cos\\theta + \\square\\sin\\theta}_1 + \\underbrace{\\square \\cos(2\\theta) + \\square\\sin(2\\theta)}_2 + \\underbrace{\\square \\cos(3\\theta) + \\square\\sin(3\\theta)}_3 + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nwhere each of the squares (<math>\\square</math>) is a different number, and one is adding infinitely many terms. Fourier used these for studying [[heat]] flow and [[diffusion]] (diffusion is the process whereby, when you drop a sugar cube into a gallon of water, the sugar gradually spreads through the water, or a pollutant spreads through the air, or any dissolved substance spreads through any fluid).\n\nFourier series are also applicable to subjects whose connection with wave motion is far from obvious. One ubiquitous example is [[data compression|digital compression]] whereby [[image compression|images]], [[audio compression (data)|audio]] and [[video compression|video]] data are compressed into a much smaller size which makes their transmission feasible over [[telephone]], [[internet]] and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[computer network|networks]]. Another example, mentioned above, is diffusion. Among others are: the [[geometry of numbers]], [[isoperimetry|isoperimetric problems]], recurrence of [[random walk]]s, [[quadratic reciprocity]], the [[central limit theorem]], [[Heisenberg's inequality]].\n\n===Fourier transforms===\n\nA more abstract concept than Fourier series is the idea of [[Fourier transform]]. Fourier transforms involve [[integral]]s rather than sums, and are used in a similarly diverse array of scientific fields. Many natural laws are expressed by relating ''rates of change'' of quantities to the quantities themselves. For example: The rate of change of population is sometimes jointly proportional to (1) the present population and (2) the amount by which the present population falls short of the [[carrying capacity]]. This kind of relationship is called a [[differential equation]]. If, given this information, one tries to express population as a function of time, one is trying to \"solve\" the differential equation. Fourier transforms may be used to convert some differential equations to algebraic equations for which methods of solving them are known. Fourier transforms have many uses. In almost any scientific context in which the words spectrum, [[harmonic]], or [[resonance]] are encountered, Fourier transforms or Fourier series are nearby.\n\n===Statistics, including mathematical psychology===\n\nIntelligence quotients are sometimes held to be distributed according to the [[normal distribution|bell-shaped curve]]. About 40% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 100 to 120; correspondingly, about 40% of the population scores between 100 and 120 on IQ tests. Nearly 9% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 120 to 140; correspondingly, about 9% of the population scores between 120 and 140 on IQ tests, etc. Similarly many other things are distributed according to the \"bell-shaped curve\", including measurement errors in many physical measurements. Why the ubiquity of the \"bell-shaped curve\"? There is a theoretical reason for this, and it involves Fourier transforms and hence [[trigonometric function]]s. That is one of a variety of applications of Fourier transforms to [[statistics]].\n\nTrigonometric functions are also applied when statisticians study seasonal periodicities, which are often represented by Fourier series.\n\n===Number theory===\nThere is a hint of a connection between trigonometry and number theory. Loosely speaking, one could say that number theory deals with qualitative properties rather than quantitative properties of numbers.\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{42}, \\qquad \\frac{2}{42}, \\qquad \\frac{3}{42}, \\qquad\n\\dots\\dots, \\qquad \\frac{39}{42}, \\qquad \\frac{40}{42}, \\qquad\n\\frac{41}{42}.\n</math>\n\nDiscard the ones that are not in lowest terms; keep only those that are in lowest terms:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{42}, \\qquad \\frac{5}{42}, \\qquad \\frac{11}{42}, \\qquad\n\\dots, \\qquad \\frac{31}{42}, \\qquad \\frac{37}{42}, \\qquad\n\\frac{41}{42}.\n</math>\n\nThen bring in trigonometry:\n\n:<math>\n\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{1}{42}\\right)+\n\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{5}{42}\\right)+\n\\cdots+\n\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{37}{42}\\right)+\n\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{41}{42}\\right)\n</math>\n\nThe value of the sum is −1, because 42 has an ''odd'' number of prime factors and none of them is repeated: 42 = 2 × 3 × 7. (If there had been an ''even'' number of non-repeated factors then the sum would have been 1; if there had been any repeated prime factors (e.g., 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5) then the sum would have been 0; the sum is the [[Möbius function]] evaluated at 42.) This hints at the possibility of applying [[Fourier analysis]] to number theory.\n\n===Solving non-trigonometric equations===\n\nVarious types of [[equation]]s can be solved using trigonometry.\n\nFor example, a [[linear difference equation]] or [[linear differential equation]] with constant coefficients has solutions expressed in terms of the [[eigenvalue]]s of its characteristic equation; if some of the eigenvalues are [[Complex number|complex]], the complex terms can be replaced by trigonometric functions of real terms, showing that the dynamic variable exhibits [[oscillations]].\n\nSimilarly, [[Cubic function#Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions|cubic equations]] with three real solutions have an [[algebraic solution]] that is unhelpful in that it contains cube roots of complex numbers; again an alternative solution exists in terms of trigonometric functions of real terms.\n\n=='''''<u>References</u>'''''==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Trigonometry]]"

Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean and other spaces]]. These are called [[dihedral angle]]s. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the [[spherical angle]] formed by two [[great circle]]s on a [[sphere]] is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.\n\n''Angle'' is also used to designate the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of an angle or of a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. This measure is the ratio of the length of a [[arc (geometry)|circular arc]] to its [[radius]]. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\nThe word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning \"corner\"; [[cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀγκύλος}} ''(ankylοs)'', meaning \"crooked, curved,\" and the [[English language|English]] word \"[[ankle]]\". Both are connected with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*ank-'', meaning \"to bend\" or \"bow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Slocum|2007}}</ref>\n<!--Note: ἀγκύλος rather than ἀνκύλος is correct, the γκ is a digraph pronounced [ŋk].-->\n\n[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177–178}}</ref><!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.-->\n\n==Identifying angles==\nIn mathematical expressions, it is common to use [[Greek letter]]s (<var>α</var>, <var>β</var>, <var>γ</var>, <var>θ</var>, <var>φ</var>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) to serve as [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] standing for the size of some angle. (To avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol [[Pi|{{math|π}}]] is typically not used for this purpose.) Lower case Roman letters (''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) are also used, as are upper case Roman letters in the context of [[polygon]]s. See the figures in this article for examples.\n\nIn geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted ∠BAC (in Unicode {{unichar|2220|ANGLE|HTML=}}) or <math>\\widehat{\\rm BAC}</math>. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex (\"angle A\").\n\nPotentially, an angle denoted, say, ∠BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see [[#Positive and negative angles|Positive and negative angles]]). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that ∠BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and ∠CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.\n\n==Types of angles==\n{{Redirect|Oblique angle|the cinematographic technique|Dutch angle}}\n===Individual angles===\n* An angle equal to 0° or not turned is called a zero angle.\n* Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90°) are called ''acute angles'' (\"acute\" meaning \"sharp\").\n* An angle equal to {{sfrac|4}} turn (90° or {{sfrac|{{math|π}}|2}} radians) is called a ''[[right angle]]''. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be ''[[normal (geometry)|normal]]'', ''[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]'', or ''[[perpendicular]]''.\n* Angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90° and 180°) are called ''obtuse angles'' (\"obtuse\" meaning \"blunt\").\n* An angle equal to {{sfrac|2}} turn (180° or {{math|π}} radians) is called a ''straight angle''.\n* Angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180° and 360°) are called ''reflex angles''.\n* An angle equal to 1 turn (360° or 2{{math|π}} radians) is called a ''full angle'', ''complete angle'', ''round angle'' or a ''perigon''.\n* Angles that are not right angles or a multiple of a right angle are called ''oblique angles''.\n\nThe names, intervals, and measured units are shown in a table below:\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Right angle.svg\n|width1=140\n|caption1=[[Right angle]]\n\n|image2=Angle obtuse acute straight.svg\n|width2=250\n|caption2=Acute (<var>a</var>), obtuse (<var>b</var>), and straight (<var>c</var>) angles.

An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are equal in measure).\n* Two angles which share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called ''coterminal angles''.\n* A ''reference angle'' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180°, or {{math|π}} radians), to the results as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and {{sfrac|4}} turn, 90°, or {{sfrac|{{math|π}}|2}} radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180–150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750–720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|title=Mathwords: Reference Angle|author=|date=|website=www.mathwords.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023035017/http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|archivedate=23 October 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|adjacent}} Vertical and adjacent angle pairs===\n[[File:Vertical Angles.svg|thumb|150px|left|Angles A and B are a pair of vertical angles; angles C and D are a pair of vertical angles.]]\n\nWhen two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.\n* A pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an \"X\"-like shape, are called ''vertical angles'' or ''opposite angles'' or ''vertically opposite angles''. They are abbreviated as ''vert. opp. ∠s''.<ref name=\"tb\">{{harvnb|Wong|Wong|2009|pp=161–163}}</ref>\n:The equality of vertically opposite angles is called the ''vertical angle theorem''. [[Eudemus of Rhodes]] attributed the proof to [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Euclid]]|title=The Elements|year=c. 300 BC|title-link=Euclid's Elements}} Proposition I:13.</ref>{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25–27}} The proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical Note,{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25–27}} when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\n:In the figure, assume the measure of Angle ''A'' = ''x''. When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, the measure of Angle ''C'' = 180 − ''x''. Similarly, the measure of Angle ''D'' = 180 − ''x''. Both Angle ''C'' and Angle ''D'' have measures equal to 180 − ''x'' and are congruent. Since Angle ''B'' is supplementary to both Angles ''C'' and ''D'', either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle ''B''. Using the measure of either Angle ''C'' or Angle ''D'' we find the measure of Angle ''B'' = 180 − (180 − ''x'') = 180 − 180 + ''x'' = ''x''. Therefore, both Angle ''A'' and Angle ''B'' have measures equal to ''x'' and are equal in measure.\n\n[[File:Adjacentangles.svg|right|thumb|225px|Angles ''A'' and ''B'' are adjacent.]]\n* ''Adjacent angles'', often abbreviated as ''adj. ∠s'', are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle or full angle are special and are respectively called ''complementary'', ''supplementary'' and ''explementary'' angles (see \"Combine angle pairs\" below).\n\nA [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with ''alternate interior angles'', ''corresponding angles'', ''interior angles'', and ''exterior angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=255}}\n\n===Combining angle pairs===\n\nThere are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles:\n{{anchor|complementary angle}}\n[[File:Complement angle.svg|thumb|150px|The ''complementary'' angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> (<var>b</var> is the ''complement'' of <var>a</var>, and <var>a</var> is the complement of <var>b</var>).]]\n* ''Complementary angles'' are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle ({{sfrac|4}} turn, 90°, or {{sfrac|{{math|π}}|2}} radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because the sum of internal angles of a [[triangle]] is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.\n:The adjective complementary is from Latin ''complementum'', associated with the verb ''complere'', \"to fill up\". An acute angle is \"filled up\" by its complement to form a right angle.\n:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the ''complement'' of the angle.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}</ref>\n:If angles ''A'' and ''B'' are complementary, the following relationships hold:\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sin^2A + \\sin^2B = 1 & & \\cos^2A + \\cos^2B = 1 \\\\[3pt]\n& \\tan A = \\cot B  & & \\sec A = \\csc B\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:(The [[tangent]] of an angle equals the [[cotangent]] of its complement and its secant equals the [[cosecant]] of its complement.)\n:The [[prefix]] \"[[co (function prefix)|co-]]\" in the names of some trigonometric ratios refers to the word \"complementary\".\n{{clear|right}}\n[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|right|300px|The angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are ''supplementary'' angles.]]\n* {{anchor|Linear pair of angles|Supplementary angle}}Two angles that sum to a straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180°, or {{math|π}} radians) are called ''supplementary angles''.\n:If the two supplementary angles are [[#adjacent|adjacent]] (i.e. have a common [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a [[line (geometry)|straight line]]. Such angles are called a ''linear pair of angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=97}} However, supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line, and can be separated in space.  For example, adjacent angles of a [[parallelogram]] are supplementary, and opposite angles of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.\n:If a point P is exterior to a circle with center O, and if the [[tangent lines to circles|tangent lines]] from P touch the circle at points T and Q, then ∠TPQ and ∠TOQ are supplementary.\n:The sines of supplementary angles are equal. Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\n:In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n{{anchor|explementary angle}}\n[[File:Reflex angle.svg|thumb|right|150px|Sum of two ''explementary'' angles is a ''complete'' angle.]]\n* Two angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360°, or 2{{math|π}} radians) are called ''explementary angles'' or ''conjugate angles''.\n*: The difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the ''explement'' of the angle or ''conjugate'' of an angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Polygon-related angles===\n[[File:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and external angles.]]\n* An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an ''[[interior angle]]'' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple [[concave polygon]] has at least one interior angle that is a reflex angle.\n*: In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle]] add up to {{math|π}} radians, 180°, or {{sfrac|2}} turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2{{math|π}} radians, 360°, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to (''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2){{math|π}} radians, or 180(''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2) degrees, (2''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;4) right angles, or ({{sfrac|''n''|2}}&nbsp;−&nbsp;1) turn.\n* The supplement of an interior angle is called an ''[[exterior angle]]'', that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a [[#Linear pair of angles|linear pair of angles]]. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon.{{sfn|Henderson|Taimina|2005|p=104}} If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\n*: In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360°). The exterior angle here could be called a ''supplementary exterior angle''. Exterior angles are commonly used in [[Logo (programming language)|Logo Turtle Geometry]] when drawing regular polygons.\n* In a [[triangle]], the [[bisection|bisectors]] of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] (meet at a single point).<ref name=Johnson>Johnson, Roger A.

Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'' or ''congruent'' or ''equal in measure''.\n\nIn some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\n[[File:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle <var>θ</var> (in radians) is the quotient of <var>s</var> and <var>r</var>.]]\n\nIn order to measure an angle <var>[[theta|θ]]</var>, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length <var>s</var> of the arc by the radius <var>r</var> of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):\n\n:<math> \\theta = k \\frac{s}{2\\pi r}. </math>\n\nThe value of <var>θ</var> thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''θr''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''θ'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|π}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|π}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''θ'' and 2{{math|π}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|π}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|π}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=Note|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius <var>r</var>, in addition to the issue of \"measurement units chosen.\" A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc.

In this postulate it does not matter in which [[Units of measurement|unit]] the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.\n\n===Units===\n{{see also|Angular unit}}\n<!-- the less remarkable units may be removed from this section, add them to angular unit (if they are not there yet) -->\n\nUnits used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order. Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].\n\nMost units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.\n\n;[[turn (geometry)|Turn]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1): The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|τ}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application, but in the acronym ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute), just ''r'' is used. A ''turn'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}}} in the formula above. The equivalence of 1 ''turn'' is 360°, 2{{pi}} rad, 400 grad, and 4 right angles. The symbol {{mvar|τ}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians. Used in this way ({{math|1= ''k'' = {{sfrac|τ|2π}}}}) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn. For example, half a turn is {{math|1 ={{sfrac|τ|2}} = π}}.\n\n;[[Quadrant (circle)|Quadrant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4): The ''quadrant'' is {{sfrac|4}} of a turn, i.e. a ''[[right angle]]''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90° = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|4}} turn = 100&nbsp;grad. In German the symbol <sup>∟</sup> has been used to denote a quadrant.\n\n;[[Sextant (circle)|Sextant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6): The ''sextant'' (''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]'') is {{sfrac|6}} of a turn. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],<ref>[[J.H. Jeans]] (1947), ''The Growth of Physical Science'', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JX49AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA7 p. 7]; [[Francis Dominic Murnaghan (mathematician)|Francis Dominic Murnaghan]] (1946), ''Analytic Geometry'', p. 2</ref> and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60° = {{pi}}/3&nbsp;rad ≈ 1.047197551&nbsp;rad.\n[[File:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|<var>θ</var> = <var>s</var>/<var>r</var> rad = 1 rad.]]\n\n;[[Radian]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2{{pi}}&nbsp;=&nbsp; 6.283&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a ''radian'' of ''n'' = 2{{pi}} units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|2{{pi}}}} = 1. One turn is 2{{pi}} radians, and one radian is {{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}} degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and \"natural\" properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.\n\n;[[Clock position]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12): A clock position is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]]. One imagines a clock face lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve hour markings with the directions in which they point.\n\n;[[Hour angle]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;24): The astronomical ''hour angle'' is {{sfrac|24}} of a turn. As this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called ''minute of time'' and ''second of time''.  These are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&nbsp;hour = 15° = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|12}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|6}}&nbsp;quad. = {{sfrac|24}} ''turn'' = {{sfrac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;grad.\n\n;[[Points of the compass|(Compass) point or wind]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32): The ''point'', used in [[navigation]], is {{sfrac|32}} of a turn. 1&nbsp;point = {{sfrac|8}} of a right angle = 11.25° = 12.5&nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.\n\n;[[Hexacontade]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;60): The ''hexacontade'' is a unit of 6° that [[Eratosthenes]] used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.\n\n;[[Pechus]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;144–180): The ''pechus'' was a [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] unit equal to about 2° or {{sfrac|2|1|2}}°.\n\n;[[Binary degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256): The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{sfrac|256}} of a turn.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm ooPIC Programmer's Guide (archived)] ''oopic.com''</ref> The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2<sup>''n''</sup> equal parts for other values of ''n''.<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx Angles, integers, and modulo arithmetic] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110630202755/http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx |date=2011-06-30 }} Shawn Hargreaves ''blogs.msdn.com''</ref>\n\n;[[Degree (angle)|Degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;360): The ''degree'', denoted by a small superscript circle (°), is 1/360 of a turn, so one ''turn'' is 360°. The case of degrees for the formula given earlier, a ''degree'' of ''n'' = 360° units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|360°|2{{pi}}}}. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5° for three and a half degrees), but the \"minute\" and \"second\" sexagesimal subunits of the \"degree-minute-second\" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]].\n\n;[[Diameter part]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;376.99&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493°. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n;[[Grad (angle)|Grad]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;400): The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'', is {{sfrac|400}} of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].\n\n;[[Milliradian]]: The milliradian (mil or mrad) is defined as a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] consists of 2000π mil (or approximately 6283.185... mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578... degrees (3.43775... minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817... ≈ {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n;[[Minute of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;21,600):  The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree = {{sfrac|21,600}} turn. It is denoted by a single prime (&nbsp;′&nbsp;). For example, 3°&nbsp;30′ is equal to 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;=&nbsp;210 minutes or 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|30|60}} = 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3°&nbsp;5.72′ = 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5.72|60}} degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.\n\n;[[Second of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000): The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&nbsp;″&nbsp;). For example, 3°&nbsp;7′&nbsp;30″ is equal to 3 + {{sfrac|7|60}} + {{sfrac|30|3600}} degrees, or 3.125&nbsp;degrees.\n\n;[[Milliarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000): mas\n;[[Microarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000,000): µas\n\n===Positive and negative angles===\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent [[Orientation (geometry)|orientations]] and/or [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative ''y''-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the ''x''-axis rightward and the ''y''-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of −''θ'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''θ''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;−45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360°&nbsp;−&nbsp;45° or 315°.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of &nbsp;−45° is not the same as a rotation of 315° (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] or [[azimuth]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.\n\n===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===\nThere are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians.\n\nIn [[rational geometry]] the ''[[spread (rational trigonometry)|spread]]'' between two lines is defined as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.\n\n===Astronomical approximations===\nAstronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.\n* 0.5° is approximately the width of the sun or moon.\n* 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.\n* 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.\n* 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.\n\nThese measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.\n\n==Angles between curves==\n[[File:Curve angles.svg|thumb|right|The angle between the two curves at ''P'' is defined as the angle between the tangents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> at <var>P</var>.]]\nThe angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:—''amphicyrtic'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|ἀμφί}}, on both sides, κυρτός, convex) or ''cissoidal'' (Gr. κισσός, ivy), biconvex; ''xystroidal'' or ''sistroidal'' (Gr. ξυστρίς, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; ''amphicoelic'' (Gr. κοίλη, a hollow) or ''angulus lunularis'', biconcave.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|p=178}}</ref><!-- Again, most of this paragraph is from EB1911 with Heath used as its source. -->\n\n==Bisecting and trisecting angles==\n{{Main article|Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle trisection}}\n\nThe [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]] knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a [[compass and straightedge]], but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837 [[Pierre Wantzel]] showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.\n\n==Dot product and generalisations==\nIn the [[Euclidean space]], the angle ''θ'' between two [[Euclidean vector]]s '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\cos(\\theta) \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThis formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their [[normal vector]]s and between [[skew lines]] from their vector equations.\n\n===Inner product===\nTo define angles in an abstract real [[inner product space]], we replace the Euclidean dot product ( '''·''' ) by the inner product <math> \\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle </math>, i.e.\n\n:<math> \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\|\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nIn a complex [[inner product space]], the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Re} \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right) = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nor, more commonly, using the absolute value, with\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = | \\cos(\\theta) | \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThe latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> spanned by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> correspondingly.\n\n===Angles between subspaces===\nThe definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and  <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> given by\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = |\\cos(\\theta)| \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| </math>\n\nin a [[Hilbert space]] can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces <math> \\mathcal{U} </math>, <math> \\mathcal{W} </math> with <math> \\dim ( \\mathcal{U}) := k \\leq \\dim ( \\mathcal{W}) := l </math>, this leads to a definition of <math>k</math> angles called canonical or [[principal angles]] between subspaces.\n\n===Angles in Riemannian geometry===\nIn [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s. Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub> are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',\n\n:<math>\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}{\\sqrt{ \\left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \\right| \\left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \\right|}}.\n</math>\n\n===Hyperbolic angle===\nA [[hyperbolic angle]] is an [[argument of a function|argument]] of a [[hyperbolic function]] just as the ''circular angle'' is the argument of a [[circular function]]. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a [[hyperbolic sector]] and a [[circular sector]] since the [[area]]s of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as [[infinite series]] in their angle argument, the circular ones are just [[alternating series]] forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by [[Leonhard Euler]] in ''[[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]]''.\n\n==Angles in geography and astronomy==\nIn [[geography]], the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a ''[[geographic coordinate system]]''. This system specifies the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the [[equator]] and (usually) the [[Greenwich meridian]] as references.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], a given point on the [[celestial sphere]] (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several ''[[astronomical coordinate systems]]'', where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the ''[[angular separation]]'' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the centre of the [[Earth]], each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.\n\nIn both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a [[vertical angle]] such as [[altitude angle|altitude]] /[[elevation angle|elevation]] with respect to the [[horizon]] as well as the [[azimuth]] with respect to [[north]].\n\nAstronomers also measure the ''apparent size'' of objects as an [[angular diameter]]. For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5°, when viewed from Earth. One could say, \"The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.\" The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle bisector]]\n* [[Angular velocity]]\n* [[Argument (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Astrological aspect]]\n* [[Central angle]]\n* [[Clock angle problem]]\n* [[Dihedral angle]]\n* [[Exterior angle theorem]]\n* [[Great circle distance]]\n* [[Inscribed angle]]\n* [[Irrational angle]]\n* [[Phase angle]]\n* [[Protractor]]\n* [[Solid angle]] for a concept of angle in three dimensions.\n* [[Spherical angle]]\n* [[Transcendent angle]]\n* [[Trisection]]\n* [[Zenith angle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation |last1=Henderson |first1=David W. |last2=Taimina |first2=Daina |year=2005 |title=Experiencing Geometry / Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History |edition=3rd |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-143748-7|page=104}}\n* {{citation |last=Heiberg |first=Johan Ludvig |year=1908 |title=Euclid |editor-first=T.L. |editor-last=Heath |editor-link=T.

      "text": "The '''angle'''s are the four [[Cardinal sign (astrology)|Cardinal points]] of an [[natal chart|astrological chart]]:  the [[Ascendant]], the [[Midheaven]], the [[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]] and the [[Imum Coeli]].\n\nThe astrological chart is a schematic representation of the sky at any given moment of time, projected upon the [[ecliptic]]--or the apparent path of the [[Sun (astrology)|Sun]] as seen from the Earth—which forms the circle in which the chart is enclosed.  The longitudinal positions of the planets are plotted onto this circle, because the planets (except [[Pluto]]) and many stars, lie very close to the Sun's path in celestial latitude.\n\nHow this map of the sky is seen from the Earth is determined by where the [[horizon]] is at the time for which the chart is cast.  The horizon forms the boundary between what can be seen, or the visible sky, and sky which exists on the opposite side of the earth, which exists at the same time and space, but cannot be seen.\n\nThe line of the horizon cuts across the circle of the chart horizontally, and forms the most important '''angle''' of the chart:  the [[Ascendant]], or the exact place where the Sun's path crosses the horizon in the East.  It is at this point that all planets and many stars appears to rise up out of what cannot be seen and become apparent to the observer.  This is because the Earth's daily rotation reveals sky objects from East to West, and makes them appear to be moving from the eastern horizon across the sky to the western horizon, where they disappear again to the observer, dipping down again to the unseen sky.  The western horizon, where the Sun's path meets the horizon in the West, is called the [[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]].\n\nThe other very important ''angle'' of the chart is the [[Midheaven]] (also called the M.C. for the Latin ''Medium coeli'', or \"middle of the sky.\")  The Midheaven represents the highest point in the sky reached by the Sun, or its ''culmination'', as it crosses from one horizon to the other—the noon point in a chart which is plotted for dawn.  At the Earth's [[equator]], it is the point on the ecliptic which is directly overhead from the observer; as the observer moves north or south from the Equator, the midheaven appears to withdraw, so that from points north of the equator, the noon point of the Sun appears to lie in the southern sky, and south of the equator, it appears in the northern sky.  \n\nThe point opposite the Midheaven, which is in the unseen sky, and would be the midnight point in a chart cast for dawn, is the ''anticulmination'' of the Sun, or the [[Imum Coeli]], which is Latin for the \"bottom of the sky.\"  This is the last of the four ''angles.''\n\nThe angles are crucial to the understanding of the meaning of the sky map to the individual or event for which it was cast.  There are no more individual points in chart.  Much has been made by astrologers (deriving from the [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] tradition that is closely linked to much of modern astrological practice) of the quality of \"coming into being\" that they represent, as they represent going from the unseen to the seen.  Since Theosophical astrology was tied to the idea of manifesting from the spiritual to the bodily form, the angles have come to symbolize this connection.  However, even if this theory is discounted, as Bernadette Brady{{Ref|Brady}} has noted, to all ancient peoples, the horizon was the place where the gods came into contact with the earth and became available to human supplication.  Without this connection, the spiritual realm and the world had nothing to do with one another, and for that reason, astrology, which seeks to communicate between the two spheres, must use this place of connection to derive significance for the world from the sky.\n\nFor delineation of each of the angles, see:\n*[[Ascendant]]\n**[[Accidental Ascendant]]\n**[[Equatorial Ascendant]]\n*[[Midheaven]]\n*[[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]]\n*[[Imum Coeli]]\n*[[Angular house]]\n*[[Succedent house]]\n*[[Cadent house]]\n\n{{Portal|Astrology}}\n\n==References==\n# {{note|Brady}}Bernadette Brady.

      "text": "[[Image:Aircraft Angle of Incidence (improved)--1080x660--25Mar2009.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Angle of incidence of an airplane wing on an airplane.]]On [[fixed-wing aircraft]], the '''angle of incidence''' (sometimes referred to as the ''mounting angle''<ref>{{cite book | title=Mechanics of Flight | author=Phillips, Warren F. | edition=2nd | year=2010 | publisher=Wiley & Sons | isbn=978-0-470-53975-0}}</ref>) is the angle between the [[chord (aircraft)|chord line]] of the wing where the wing is mounted to the fuselage, and a reference axis along the fuselage (often the direction of minimum drag, or where applicable, the [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal_axis|longitudinal axis]]).  The angle of incidence is fixed in the design of the aircraft, and with [[Variable-incidence wing|rare exceptions]], cannot be varied in flight.\n\nThe term can also be applied to horizontal surfaces in general (such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] or horizontal stabilizers) for the angle they make relative the longitudinal axis of the fuselage.\n\nThe figure to the right shows a side view of an airplane.  The extended chord line of the wing root (red line) makes an angle with the longitudinal axis (roll axis) of the aircraft (blue line).  Wings are typically mounted at a small positive angle of incidence, to allow the fuselage to have a low angle with the airflow in cruising flight.  Angles of incidence of about 6° are common on most [[general aviation]] designs.\nOther terms for angle of incidence in this context are ''rigging angle'' and ''rigger's angle of incidence''. It should not be confused with the [[angle of attack]], which is the angle the wing chord presents to the airflow in flight. Note that some [[ambiguity]] in this terminology exists, as some engineering texts that focus solely on the study of airfoils and their medium may use either term when referring to angle of attack.<ref>Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, 8th edition, Pitman Publishing, London.  {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}</ref>\n\nOn rotary–wing aircraft, the AoA (''Angle of Attack'') is the angle between the airfoil chord line and resultant relative wind. AoA is an aerodynamic angle. It can change with no change in the AoI (''Angle of Incidence''). Several factors may change the rotor blade AoA. Pilots control some of those factors; others occur automatically due to the rotor system design. Pilots adjust AoA through normal control manipulation; however, even with no pilot input AoA will change as an integral part of travel of the rotor blade through the rotor-disc. This continuous process of change accommodates rotary-wing flight. Pilots have little control over blade flapping and flexing, gusty wind, and/or turbulent air conditions. AoA is one of the primary factors determining amount of lift and drag produced by an airfoil.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fundamentals of Flight |url=https://archive.org/stream/ost-military-doctrine-fm3_04x203/fm3_04x203_djvu.txt |publisher=Department of the Army |accessdate=29 May 2019 |date=7 May 2007}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angle Of Incidence}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]\n[[Category:Angle]]"

Incidence at grazing angles is called \"grazing incidence\".\n\n[[Grazing incidence diffraction]] is used in [[X-ray spectroscopy]] and [[atom optics]], where significant reflection can be achieved only at small values of the grazing angle.

Thus, the radius squared of ''Q'' is\n\n: <math> x^2 + y^2 = (1 - x)^2, </math>\n\nhence\n\n: <math> x = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - y^2). </math>\n\nThe [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] of the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of hyperbolic geometry parametrizes distance on the ray {(0,&nbsp;''y'') : ''y'' > 0 } with [[logarithmic measure]]. Let log&nbsp;''y'' = ''a'', so ''y'' = e<sup>''a''</sup> where [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] is the base of the [[natural logarithm]]. Then \nthe relation between ''&phi;'' and ''a'' can be deduced from the triangle {(''x'',&nbsp;0),&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;0),&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;''y'')}, for example:\n\n: <math> \\tan\\phi = \\frac{y}{-x} = \\frac{2y}{y^2 - 1} = \\frac{2e^a}{e^{2a} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\sinh a}. </math>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* [[Marvin Greenberg|Marvin J.

A complete [[rotation]] about the center point is equal to 1 [[turn (geometry)|turn]], 360[[degree (angle)|°]], or 2[[pi|π]] [[radian]]s.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''angle of rotation''' is a measurement of the amount, namely the [[angle]], that a [[shape|figure]] is [[rotation|rotated]] about a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], often the [[center (geometry)|center]] of a [[circle]]. A clockwise rotation is considered a negative rotation, so that, for instance, a rotation of 310° (counterclockwise) can also be called a rotation of &ndash;50° (since {{nowrap|1=310° + 50° = 360°}}, a full rotation ([[turn (geometry)|turn]])). A counterclockwise rotation of more than one complete turn is normally measured [[modulo (jargon)|modulo]] 360°, meaning that 360° is subtracted off as many times as possible to leave a non-negative measurement less than 360°.\n\nFor example, the carts on a [[Ferris wheel]] move along a circle around the center point of that circle. If a cart moves around the wheel once, the angle of rotation is 360 degrees. If the cart was stuck halfway, at the top of the wheel, at that point its angle of rotation was only 180 degrees. \n\nThis is also referred to as the \"order of symmetry.\"\n\nAngles are commonly measured in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[radian]]s, [[gon (angle)|gon]]s (gradians) and [[turn (geometry)|turns]], sometimes also in [[angular mil]]s and [[binary radian]]s.

It is used interchangeably with the more general term [[field of view]].\n\nIt is important to distinguish the angle of view from the '''angle of coverage''', which describes the angle range that a lens can image. Typically the [[image circle]] produced by a lens is large enough to cover the film or sensor completely, possibly including some [[vignetting]] toward the edge. If the angle of coverage of the lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and the effective angle of view will be limited to the angle of coverage.\n\n[[Image:Angle of View F V Chambers 1916.png|right|thumb|360px|In 1916, Northey showed how to calculate the angle of view using ordinary carpenter's tools.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = The Camera | author = Neil Wayne Northey | title = The Angle of View of your Lens | editor = Frank V.

At distances approaching infinity, the light rays are nearly parallel to each other, resulting in a \"flattened\" image. At low distances and high angles of view objects appear \"foreshortened\".]]\n\nA camera's angle of view depends not only on the lens, but also on the sensor. Digital sensors are usually smaller than [[35mm format|35&nbsp;mm film]], and this causes the lens to have a narrower angle of view than with 35&nbsp;mm film, by a constant factor for each sensor (called the [[crop factor]]). In everyday digital cameras, the crop factor can range from around 1 (professional [[digital SLR]]s), to 1.6 (consumer SLR), to 2 ([[Micro Four Thirds]] ILC) to 4 ([[enthusiast compact camera]]s) to 6 (most [[compact camera]]s). So a standard 50&nbsp;mm lens for 35&nbsp;mm photography acts like a 50&nbsp;mm standard \"film\" lens on a professional digital SLR, but would act closer to an 80&nbsp;mm lens (1.6 x 50mm) on many mid-market DSLRs, and the 40 degree angle of view of a standard 50&nbsp;mm lens on a film camera is equivalent to a 28–35&nbsp;mm lens on many digital SLRs.\n\n== Calculating a camera's angle of view ==\n\nFor lenses projecting [[rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] (non-spatially-distorted) images of distant objects, the effective [[focal length]] and the image format dimensions completely define the angle of view. Calculations for lenses producing non-rectilinear images are much more complex and in the end not very useful in most practical applications. (In the case of a lens with distortion, e.g., a [[fisheye lens]], a longer lens with distortion can have a wider angle of view than a shorter lens with low distortion)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-digital-picture.com/reviews/canon-ef-15mm-f-2.8-fisheye-lens-review.aspx|title=Canon EF 15mm f/2.8 Fisheye Lens Review|author=|date=|website=The-Digital-Picture.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807005837/http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-15mm-f-2.8-Fisheye-Lens-Review.aspx|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=}}</ref>\nAngle of view may be measured horizontally (from the left to right edge of the frame), vertically (from the top to bottom of the frame), or diagonally (from one corner of the frame to its opposite corner).\n\nFor a lens projecting a rectilinear image (focused at infinity, see [[#Derivation of the angle-of-view formula|derivation]]), the angle of view (''α'') can be calculated from the chosen dimension (''d''), and effective focal length (''f'') as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Industry: A Monthly Magazine Devoted to Science, Engineering and Mechanic Arts | title = Photographic Topography | author = Ernest McCollough | year = 1893 | pages = 399–406 | publisher = Industrial Publishing Company, San Francisco | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eCkAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA402&dq=%22field-of+view%22+%22focal+length%22+camera+tangent+%22length+of+the+plate%22 }}</ref>\n\n::<math>\\alpha = 2 \\arctan \\frac {d} {2 f}</math>\n\n<math>d</math> represents the size of the film (or sensor) in the direction measured ''(see [[#Crop factor|below: sensor effects]])''. For example, for 35&nbsp;mm film which is 36&nbsp;mm wide and 24&nbsp;mm high, <math>d = 36</math> mm would be used to obtain the horizontal angle of view and <math>d = 24</math> mm for the vertical angle.\n\nBecause this is a trigonometric function, the angle of view does not vary quite linearly with the reciprocal of the focal length. However, except for wide-angle lenses, it is reasonable to approximate <math>\\alpha\\approx \\frac{d}{f}</math> radians or <math>\\frac{180d}{\\pi f}</math> degrees.\n\nThe effective focal length is nearly equal to the stated focal length of the lens (''F''), except in [[macro photography]] where the lens-to-object distance is comparable to the focal length. In this case, the [[magnification]] factor (''m'') must be taken into account:\n\n::<math>f = F \\cdot ( 1 + m )</math>\n\n(In photography <math>m</math> is usually defined to be positive, despite the inverted image.) For example, with a magnification ratio of 1:2, we find <math>f = 1.5 \\cdot F</math> and thus the angle of view is reduced by 33% compared to focusing on a distant object with the same lens.\n\nAngle of view can also be determined using FOV tables or paper or software lens calculators.<ref>[http://www.jvsg.com/cctv-camera-lens-calculations/ CCTV Field of View Camera Lens Calculations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822113350/http://www.jvsg.com/cctv-camera-lens-calculations/ |date=2008-08-22 }} by JVSG, December, 2007</ref>\n\n{{wide image|camera_focal_length_vs_crop_factor_vs_angle_of_view.svg|600px|Log-log graphs of focal length vs crop factor vs diagonal, horizontal and vertical angles of view for film or sensors of 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios.

Treat the lens as if it were a [[pinhole camera model|pinhole]] at distance <math>S_2</math> from the image plane (technically, the center of perspective of a [[rectilinear lens]] is at the center of its [[entrance pupil]]):<ref>{{cite web | author=Kerr, Douglas A. | year=2008 | title=The Proper Pivot Point for Panoramic Photography | format=PDF | work=The Pumpkin | url=http://dougkerr.net/Pumpkin/articles/Pivot_Point.pdf | accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lens angle of view.svg|center]]\n\nNow <math>\\alpha/2</math> is the angle between the [[optical axis]] of the lens and the ray joining its optical center to the edge of the film. Here <math>\\alpha</math> is defined to be the angle-of-view, since it is the angle enclosing the largest object whose image can fit on the film. We want to find the relationship between:\n:: the angle <math>\\alpha</math>\n:: the \"opposite\" side of the right triangle, <math>d/2</math> (half the film-format dimension)\n:: the \"adjacent\" side, <math>S_2</math> (distance from the lens to the image plane)\nUsing basic trigonometry, we find:\n::<math>\\tan ( \\alpha / 2 ) = \\frac {d/2} {S_2} .</math>\nwhich we can solve for ''α'', giving:\n::<math>\\alpha = 2 \\arctan \\frac {d} {2 S_2}</math>\n\nTo project a sharp image of distant objects, <math>S_2</math> needs to be equal to the [[focal length]], <math>F</math>, which is attained by setting the lens for [[infinity focus]]. Then the angle of view is given by:\n\n::<math>\\alpha = 2 \\arctan \\frac {d} {2 f}</math> where <math>f=F</math>\n\nNote that the angle of view varies slightly when the focus is not at infinity (See [[breathing (lens)]]), given by <math>S_2=\\frac{S_1 f}{S_1 - f}</math> rearranging the lens equation.\n\n==== Macro photography ====\n\nFor macro photography, we cannot neglect the difference between <math>S_2</math> and <math>F</math>. From the [[Lens (optics)#Imaging properties|thin lens formula]],\n\n::<math>\\frac{1}{F} = \\frac{1}{S_1} + \\frac{1}{S_2}</math>.\n\nFrom the definition of [[magnification]], <math>m = S_2/S_1</math>, we can substitute <math>S_1</math> and with some algebra find:\n::<math>S_2 = F\\cdot(1+m)</math>\n\nDefining <math>f=S_2</math> as the \"effective focal length\", we get the formula presented above:\n\n::<math>\\alpha = 2 \\arctan \\frac {d} {2 f}</math> where <math>f=F\\cdot(1+m)</math>.\n\nA second effect which comes into play in macro photography is lens asymmetry (an asymmetric lens is a lens where the aperture appears to have different dimensions when viewed from the front and from the back). The lens asymmetry causes an offset between the nodal plane and pupil positions. The effect can be quantified using the ratio (''P'') between apparent exit pupil diameter and entrance pupil diameter.

(1998). Testing and Evaluation of Infrared Imaging Systems (2nd ed.). Florida:JCD Publishing, Washington:SPIE.</ref> Optical tests are commonly used for measuring the FOV of [[UV]], [[Visible spectrum|visible]], and [[infrared]] (wavelengths about 0.1–20&nbsp;µm in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]) sensors and cameras.\n\nThe purpose of this test is to measure the horizontal and vertical FOV of a lens and sensor used in an imaging system, when the lens focal length or sensor size is not known (that is, when the calculation above is not immediately applicable). Although this is one typical method that the [[optics]] industry uses to measure the FOV, there exist many other possible methods.\n\nUV/visible light from an [[integrating sphere]] (and/or other source such as a [[black body]]) is focused onto a square test target at the [[focal plane]] of a [[collimator]] (the mirrors in the diagram), such that a virtual image of the test target will be seen infinitely far away by the camera under test. The camera under test senses a real image of the virtual image of the target, and the sensed image is displayed on a monitor.<ref>Mazzetta, J.A.; Scopatz, S.D. (2007).

Assuming the sensed image includes the whole target, the angle seen by the camera, its FOV, is this angular extent of the target times the ratio of full image size to target image size.<ref>Electro Optical Industries, Inc.(2005).

For a given subject magnification (and thus different camera–subject distances), longer lenses appear to compress distance; wider lenses appear to expand the distance between objects.\n\nAnother result of using a wide angle lens is a greater apparent [[Perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] when the camera is not aligned perpendicularly to the subject: parallel lines converge at the same rate as with a [[normal lens]], but converge more due to the wider total field. For example, buildings appear to be falling backwards much more severely when the camera is pointed upward from ground level than they would if photographed with a normal lens at the same distance from the subject, because more of the subject building is visible in the wide-angle shot.\n\nBecause different lenses generally require a different camera–subject distance to preserve the size of a subject, changing the angle of view can indirectly [[Perspective distortion (photography)|distort]] perspective, changing the apparent relative size of the subject and foreground.\n\nIf the subject image size remains the same, then at any given aperture all lenses, wide angle and long lenses, will give the same depth of field.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reichmann|first=Michael|title=Do Wide Angle Lenses Really Have Greater Depth of Field Than Telephotos?|url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/dof2.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610032235/http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/dof2.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-10|df=|access-date=2011-07-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\n\nAn example of how lens choice affects angle of view.\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n| [[Image:Angleofview 28mm f4.jpg|frame|28&nbsp;mm lens, 65.5° × 46.4°]]\n| [[Image:Angleofview 50mm f4.jpg|frame|50&nbsp;mm lens, 39.6° × 27.0°]]\n|-\n| [[Image:Angleofview 70mm f4.jpg|frame|70&nbsp;mm lens, 28.9° × 19.5°]]\n| [[Image:Angleofview 210mm f4.jpg|frame|210&nbsp;mm lens, 9.8° × 6.5°]]\n|}\n\n== Common lens angles of view ==\n\nThis table shows the diagonal, horizontal, and vertical angles of view, in degrees, for lenses producing rectilinear images, when used with 36&nbsp;mm × 24&nbsp;mm format (that is, [[135 film]] or [[Full-frame digital SLR|full-frame 35&nbsp;mm digital]] using width 36&nbsp;mm, height 24&nbsp;mm, and diagonal 43.3&nbsp;mm for ''d'' in the formula above).<ref>However, most interchangeable-lens digital cameras do not use 24×36&nbsp;mm [[image sensor]]s and therefore produce narrower angles of view than set out in the table.

Digital sensors are usually smaller than 35&nbsp;mm film, causing the lens to usually behave as a longer focal length lens would behave, and have a narrower angle of view than with 35&nbsp;mm film, by a constant factor for each sensor (called the [[crop factor]]). In everyday digital cameras, the crop factor can range from around 1 (professional [[digital SLR]]s), to 1.6 (mid-market SLRs), to around 3 to 6 for [[compact camera]]s. So a standard 50&nbsp;mm lens for [[35 mm photography]] acts like a 50&nbsp;mm standard \"film\" lens even on a professional digital SLR, but would act closer to a 75mm (1.5×50&nbsp;mm Nikon) or 80mm lens (1.6×50&nbsp;mm Canon) on many mid-market DSLRs, and the 40 degree angle of view of a standard 50mm lens on a film camera is equivalent to a 28–35&nbsp;mm lens on many digital SLRs.\n\nThe table below shows the horizontal, vertical and diagonal angles of view, in degrees, when used with 22.2&nbsp;mm × 14.8&nbsp;mm format (that is Canon's [[APS-C|DSLR APS-C frame size]]) and a diagonal of 26.7&nbsp;mm.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0px;\"\n|- \n! style=\"width:6em;\" | Focal length (mm) || style=\"width:6em;\" | Diagonal (°) ||style=\"width:6em;\" |  Vertical (°) || style=\"width:6em;\" | Horizontal (°)\t \n|-\n| 2   || 162.9 || 149.8 || 159.6 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 4   || 146.6 || 123.2 || 140.4 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 7   || 124.6 || 93.2  || 115.5 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 9   || 112.0 || 78.9  || 101.9 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 12  || 96.1  || 63.3  || 85.5 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 14  || 87.2  || 55.7  || 76.8 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 16  || 79.6  || 49.6  || 69.5 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 17  || 76.2  || 47.0  || 66.3 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 18  || 73.1  || 44.7  || 63.3 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 20  || 67.4  || 40.6  || 58.1 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 24  || 58.1  || 34.3  || 49.6 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 35  || 41.7  || 23.9  || 35.2 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 50  || 29.9  || 16.8  || 25.0 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 70  || 21.6  || 12.1  || 18.0 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 85  || 17.8  || 10.0  || 14.9 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 105 || 14.5  || 8.1   || 12.1 \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 200 || 7.6   || 4.2   || 6.4  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 210 || 7.3   || 4.0   || 6.1  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 300 || 5.1   || 2.8   || 4.2  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 400 || 3.8   || 2.1   || 3.2  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 500 || 3.1   || 1.7   || 2.5  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 600 || 2.5   || 1.4   || 2.1  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 700 || 2.2   || 1.2   || 1.8  \t       \t\t \n|-\n| 800 || 1.9   || 1.1   || 1.6                          \n|}\n\n== Cinematography and video gaming ==\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n!Ratio\n!1080p resolution\n!Common name\n!Video format / lens\n|-\n!32:27\n|1280x1080p\n|\n|[[DV#DVCPRO HD|DVCPRO HD]]\n|-\n!4:3\n|1440x1080p \n|\n|\n|-\n!16:9\n|1920x1080p \n|Widescreen\n|\n|-\n!2:1\n|2160x1080\n|18:9\n|[[Univisium]]\n|-\n!64:27\n|2560x1080p \n|Ultra-Widescreen\n|[[Cinemascope]] / [[Anamorphic format#2.35, 2.39 or 2.40?|Anamorphic]]\n|-\n!32:9\n|3840x1080p\n|Super Ultra-Widescreen\n|[[Aspect ratio (image)#36:10 (3.6:1)|Ultra-Widescreen 3.6]] / [[Anamorphic format|Anamorphic]] 3.6\n|}\n\nModifying the angle of view over time (known as [[zooming (filmmaking)|zooming]]), is a frequently used [[cinematic techniques|cinematic technique]], often combined with camera movement to produce a \"[[dolly zoom]]\" effect, made famous by the film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.

To get a true representation of the sizes, view the image at a distance of 103 times the width of the \"Moon: max.\" circle. For example, if this circle is 5 cm wide on your monitor, view it from 5.15 m away.]]\n[[File:Jupiter.mit.Io.Ganymed.Europa.Calisto.Vollmond.10.4.2017.jpg|thumb|250px|This photo compares the apparent sizes of [[Jupiter]] and its four [[Galilean moons]] ([[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] at maximum [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]]) with the apparent diameter of the [[full moon|full Moon]] during their [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] on 10 April 2017.]]\n\nThe table shows that the angular diameter of Sun, when seen from Earth is approximately 32′ (1920″ or 0.53°), as illustrated above.\n\nThus the angular diameter of the Sun is about 250,000 times that of [[Sirius]]. (Sirius has twice the diameter and its distance is 500,000 times as much; the Sun is 10<sup>10</sup> times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 10<sup>5</sup>, so Sirius is roughly 6 times as bright per unit [[solid angle]].)\n\nThe angular diameter of the Sun is also about 250,000 times that of [[Alpha Centauri A]] (it has about the same diameter and the distance is 250,000 times as much; the Sun is 4×10<sup>10</sup> times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 200,000, so Alpha Centauri A is a little brighter per unit solid angle).\n\nThe angular diameter of the Sun is about the same as that of the [[Moon]]. (The Sun's diameter is 400 times as large and its distance also; the Sun is 200,000 to 500,000 times as bright as the full Moon (figures vary), corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 450 to 700, so a celestial body with a diameter of 2.5–4″ and the same brightness per unit solid angle would have the same brightness as the full Moon.)\n\nEven though Pluto is physically larger than Ceres, when viewed from Earth (e.g., through the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]) Ceres has a much larger apparent size.\n\nAngular sizes measured in degrees are useful for larger patches of sky. (For example, the three stars of [[Orion's Belt|the Belt]] cover about 4.5° of angular size.) However, much finer units are needed to measure the angular sizes of galaxies, nebulae, or other objects of the [[night sky]].\n\nDegrees, therefore, are subdivided as follows:\n* 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°) in a full circle\n* 60 [[arc-minute]]s (′) in one degree\n* 60 [[arc-second]]s (″) in one arc-minute\n\nTo put this in perspective, the [[full moon|full Moon]] as viewed from Earth is about {{frac|1|2}}°, or 30′ (or 1800″). The Moon's motion across the sky can be measured in angular size: approximately 15° every hour, or 15″ per second. A one-mile-long line painted on the face of the Moon would appear from Earth to be about 1″ in length.\n\nIn astronomy, it is typically difficult to directly measure the distance to an object, yet the object may have a known physical size (perhaps it is similar to a closer object with known distance) and a measurable angular diameter. In that case, the angular diameter formula can be inverted to yield the [[angular diameter distance]] to distant objects as \n:<math>d \\equiv 2 D \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\delta}{2} \\right)</math>.\n\nIn non-Euclidean space, such as our expanding universe, the angular diameter distance is only one of several definitions of distance, so that there can be different \"distances\" to the same object.  See [[Distance measures (cosmology)]].\n\n===Non-circular objects===\nMany [[deep-sky object]]s such as [[galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e appear non-circular and are thus typically given two measures of diameter: major axis and minor axis. For example, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] has a visual apparent diameter of {{DEC|5|20}} × {{DEC|3|5}}.\n\n===Defect of illumination===\nDefect of illumination is the maximum angular width of the unilluminated part of a celestial body seen by a given observer. For example, if an object is 40″ of arc across and is 75% illuminated, the defect of illumination is 10″.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angular diameter distance]]\n* [[Angular resolution]]\n* [[Solid angle]]\n* [[Visual acuity]]\n* [[Visual angle]]\n* [[Visual Angle Illusion]]\n* [[List of stars with resolved images]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19971007100829/http://ceres.hsc.edu/homepages/classes/astronomy/fall97/Mathematics/sec9.html Small-Angle Formula]\n*[http://www.astronomynotes.com/solarsys/s2.htm Visual Aid to the Apparent Size of the Planets]\n\n[[Category:Elementary geometry]]\n[[Category:Astrometry]]\n[[Category:Angle]]"

When a body rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, as in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time (''t'').  When dealing with the rotation of a body, it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid.  A body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the body's motion, so for example parts of its mass are not flying off.  In a realistic sense, all things can be deformable, however this impact is minimal and negligible.  Thus the rotation of a rigid body over a fixed axis is referred to as [[rotational motion]].\n\n==Example==\nIn the example illustrated to the right (or above in some mobile versions), a particle or body P is at a fixed distance ''r'' from the origin, ''O'', rotating counterclockwise. It becomes important to then represent the position of particle P in terms of its polar coordinates (''r'', ''θ'').  In this particular example, the value of ''θ'' is changing, while the value of the radius remains the same.  (In rectangular coordinates (''x'', ''y'') both ''x'' and ''y'' vary with time). As the particle moves along the circle, it travels an [[Arc (geometry)|arc length]] ''s'', which becomes related to the angular position through the relationship:-\n\n:<math>s = r\\theta \\,</math>\n\n==Measurements==\nAngular displacement may be measured in [[radian]]s or degrees. Using radians provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle and the distance ''r'' from the centre.\n\n:<math>\\theta = \\frac{s}{r}</math>\n\nFor example, if a body rotates 360° around a circle of radius ''r'', the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2π''r'' - divided by the radius: <math>\\theta= \\frac{2\\pi r}r</math> which easily simplifies to: <math>\\theta=2\\pi</math>. Therefore, 1 revolution is <math>2\\pi</math> radians.\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:angulardisplacement2.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A particle that is rotating from point P to point Q along the arc of the circle.  In the time that elapses, the change in time is equal to the final time minus the original time, and the radius travels an angle theta, or the original angle subtracted from the final angle.]]\n-->\nWhen a particle travels from point P to point Q over <math>\\delta t</math>, as it does in the illustration to the left, the radius of the circle goes through a change in angle <math>\\Delta \\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 </math>  which equals the ''angular displacement''.\n\n== Three dimensions ==\n[[Image:Euler Rotation 2.JPG|200px|left|thumb|'''Figure 1''': Euler's rotation theorem. A great circle transforms to another great circle under rotations, leaving always a diameter of the sphere in its original position.]]\n[[Image:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 2''': A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]\n\nIn three dimensions, angular displacement is an entity with a direction and a magnitude.  The direction specifies the axis of rotation, which always exists by virtue of the [[Euler's rotation theorem]]; the magnitude specifies the rotation in [[radian]]s about that axis (using the [[right-hand rule]] to determine direction). This entity is called an [[axis-angle]].\n\nDespite having direction and magnitude, angular displacement is not a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] because it does not obey the [[commutative law]] for addition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2=Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1973|pages=288–89}}</ref> Nevertheless, when dealing with infinitesimal rotations, second order infinitesimals can be discarded and in this case commutativity appears.\n\nSeveral ways to describe '''angular displacement''' exist, like [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] or [[Euler angles]]. See [[charts on SO(3)]] for others.\n\n=== Matrix notation ===\n\nGiven that any frame in the space can be described by a rotation matrix, the displacement among them can also be described by a rotation matrix. Being <math>A_0</math> and <math>A_f</math> two matrices, the angular displacement matrix between them can be obtained as <math>\\Delta A =  A_f . A_0^{-1}</math>. When this product is performed having a very small difference between both frames we will obtain a matrix close to the identity.\n\nIn the limit, we will have an infinitesimal rotation matrix.\n\n== Infinitesimal rotation matrices ==\n{{further\n|Euler's rotation theorem#Generators of rotations{{!}}Generators of rotations\n|Rotation matrix#Infinitesimal rotations{{!}}Infinitesimal rotations\n|Infinitesimal strain theory#Infinitesimal rotation tensor{{!}}Infinitesimal rotation tensor\n|Rotation group SO(3)#Infinitesimal rotations\n}}\n\nAn infinitesimal angular displacement is an [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Infinitesimal rotations|infinitesimal rotation]] matrix:\n\n* As any rotation matrix has a single real eigenvalue, which is +1, this eigenvalue shows the rotation axis.\n* Its module can be deduced from the value of the infinitesimal rotation.\n* The shape of the matrix is like this:\n\n:<math>\n  A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n     1          & -d\\phi_z(t) &  d\\phi_y(t) \\\\\n     d\\phi_z(t) &  1          & -d\\phi_x(t) \\\\\n    -d\\phi_y(t) &  d\\phi_x(t) &  1 \\\\\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nWe can introduce here the '''infinitesimal angular displacement tensor''' or '''rotation generator''' associated:\n\n:<math>\n  d\\Phi(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0          & -d\\phi_z(t) &  d\\phi_y(t) \\\\\n     d\\phi_z(t) &  0          & -d\\phi_x(t) \\\\\n    -d\\phi_y(t) &  d\\phi_x(t) &  0 \\\\\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nSuch that its associated rotation matrix is <math>A = I + d\\Phi(t)</math>. When it is divided by the time, this will yield the [[angular velocity]] vector.\n\n===Generators of rotations===\n{{Main|Rotation matrix|Rotation group SO(3)|Infinitesimal transformation}}\n\nSuppose we specify an axis of rotation by a unit vector [''x'', ''y'', ''z'']&nbsp;, and suppose we have an [[Infinitesimal rotation|infinitely small rotation]] of angle Δθ&nbsp; about that vector. Expanding the rotation matrix as an infinite addition, and taking the first order approach, the rotation matrix Δ''R''&nbsp; is represented as:\n\n: <math>\\Delta R =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  +\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 &  z & -y \\\\\n    -z &  0 &  x \\\\\n     y & -x &  0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\\,\\Delta \\theta\n  = \\mathbf{I} + \\mathbf{A}\\,\\Delta\\theta.\n</math>\n\nA finite rotation through angle θ about this axis may be seen as a succession of small rotations about the same axis. Approximating Δθ&nbsp; as θ/''N'' where ''N''&nbsp; is a large number, a rotation of θ about the axis may be represented as:\n\n:<math>R = \\left(\\mathbf{1} + \\frac{\\mathbf{A}\\theta}{N}\\right)^N \\approx e^{\\mathbf{A}\\theta}.</math>\n\nIt can be seen that Euler's theorem essentially states that <u>all</u> rotations may be represented in this form. The product <math>\\mathbf{A}\\theta</math> is the \"generator\" of the particular rotation, being the vector (''x'',''y'',''z'') associated with the matrix A. This shows that the rotation matrix and the [[axis-angle]] format are related by the exponential function.\n\nOne can derive a simple expression for the generator G. One starts with an arbitrary plane<ref>in Euclidean space</ref> defined by a pair of perpendicular unit vectors a and b. In this plane one can choose an arbitrary vector x with perpendicular y. One then solves for y in terms of x and substituting into an expression for a rotation in a plane yields the rotation matrix R which includes the generator G = ba<sup>T</sup> − ab<sup>T</sup>.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   x &=  a \\cos\\left( \\alpha \\right) + b \\sin\\left( \\alpha \\right) \\\\ \n   y &= -a \\sin\\left( \\alpha \\right) + b \\cos\\left( \\alpha \\right) \\\\ \n   \\cos\\left( \\alpha \\right) &= a^T x \\\\\n   \\sin\\left( \\alpha \\right) &= b^T x \\\\ \n   y &= -ab^T x + ba^T x = \\left( ba^T - ab^T \\right)x \\\\ \n \\\\ \n  x' &= x \\cos\\left( \\beta \\right) + y \\sin\\left( \\beta \\right) \\\\ \n     &= \\left[ I \\cos\\left( \\beta \\right) + \\left( ba^T - ab^T \\right) \\sin\\left( \\beta \\right) \\right]x \\\\\n \\\\ \n  R &= I \\cos\\left( \\beta \\right) + \\left( ba^T - ab^T \\right) \\sin\\left( \\beta \\right) \\\\ \n    &= I \\cos\\left( \\beta \\right) + G \\sin\\left( \\beta \\right) \\\\ \n \\\\ \n  G &= ba^T - ab^T \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo include vectors outside the plane in the rotation one needs to modify the above expression for R by including two [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operators]] that partition the space. This modified rotation matrix can be rewritten as an [[Matrix exponential#Rotation case|exponential function]].\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n P_{ab} &= -G^2 \\\\ \n      R &= I - P_{ab} + \\left[ I \\cos\\left( \\beta \\right) + G \\sin\\left( \\beta \\right) \\right] P_{ab} = e^{G\\beta} \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAnalysis is often easier in terms of these generators, rather than the full rotation matrix. Analysis in terms of the generators is known as the [[Lie algebra]] of the rotation group.\n\n===Relationship with Lie algebras===\nThe matrices in the [[Lie algebra]] are not themselves rotations; the skew-symmetric matrices are derivatives, proportional differences of rotations. An actual \"differential rotation\", or ''infinitesimal rotation matrix'' has the form\n:<math> I + A \\, d\\theta ~,</math>\nwhere {{math|''dθ''}} is vanishingly small and {{math|''A'' ∈ '''so'''(n)}}, for instance with {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''L''<sub>''x''</sub>}},\n:<math> dL_{x} = \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -d\\theta \\\\ 0 & d\\theta & 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right]. </math>\n\nThe computation rules are as usual except that infinitesimals of second order are routinely dropped. With these rules, these matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals.<ref>{{Harv|Goldstein|Poole|Safko|2002|loc=§4.8}}</ref> It turns out that ''the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant''. To see this exemplified, consult [[rotation group SO(3)#Infinitesimal rotations|infinitesimal rotations SO(3)]].\n\n=== Exponential map ===\n{{main|Rotation group SO(3)#Exponential map|Matrix exponential}}\nConnecting the Lie algebra to the Lie group is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]], which is defined using the standard [[matrix exponential]]  series for {{math|''e<sup>A</sup>''}}<ref>{{Harv|Wedderburn|1934|loc=§8.02}}</ref> For any [[skew-symmetric matrix]] {{mvar|A}}, exp({{mvar|A}}) is always a rotation matrix.<ref group=nb>Note that this exponential  map of skew-symmetric matrices to rotation matrices is quite different from the Cayley transform discussed earlier, differing to 3rd order, \n<math>e^{2A} - \\frac{I+A}{I-A}=- \\frac{2}{3} A^3 +\\mathrm{O}  (A^4)  ~.  </math> <br />\nConversely, a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] {{mvar|A}} specifying a rotation matrix through the Cayley map specifies the ''same'' rotation matrix through the map {{math|exp(2arctanh''A'')}}.</ref>\n\nAn important practical example is the {{math|3 × 3}} case. In [[rotation group SO(3)]], it is shown that one can identify every {{math|''A'' ∈ '''so'''(3)}} with an Euler  vector {{math|'''ω''' {{=}} ''θ'' '''u'''}}, where {{math|'''u''' {{=}} (''x'',''y'',''z'')}} is a unit magnitude vector.\n\nBy the properties of the identification {{math|'''su'''(2) ≅ ℝ<sup>3</sup>}}, {{math|'''u'''}} is in the null space of {{mvar|A}}. Thus, {{math|'''u'''}} is left invariant by {{math|exp(''A'')}} and is hence a rotation axis.\n\nUsing [[Rodrigues' rotation formula#Matrix notation|Rodrigues' rotation formula on matrix form]] with {{math|''θ'' {{=}} {{frac|''θ''|2}} + {{frac|''θ''|2}}}}, together with standard [[List of trigonometric identities#Double-angle, triple-angle, and half-angle formulae|double angle formulae]] one obtains,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\exp( A ) &{}= \\exp(\\theta(\\boldsymbol{u\\cdot L}))\n           = \\exp \\left( \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & -z \\theta & y \\theta \\\\ z \\theta & 0&-x \\theta \\\\ -y \\theta & x \\theta & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right] \\right)= \\boldsymbol{I} + 2\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}~\\boldsymbol{u\\cdot L} + 2\\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2} ~(\\boldsymbol{u\\cdot L} )^2 ,\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''c'' {{=}} cos {{frac|''θ''|2}}}}, {{math|''s'' {{=}} sin {{frac|''θ''|2}}}}.\n\nThis is the matrix for a rotation around axis {{math|'''u'''}}  by the angle {{mvar|θ}} in half-angle form.

In [[physics]] and geosciences, the term ''spatial resolution'' refers to the precision of a [[measurement]] with respect to space.\n\n==Definition of terms==\n\n''Resolving power'' is the ability of an imaging device to separate (i.e., to see as distinct) points of an object that are located at a small [[angular separation|angular distance]] or it is the power of an optical instrument to separate far away objects, that are close together, into individual images. The term ''[[Optical resolution|resolution]]'' or ''minimum resolvable distance'' is the minimum distance between distinguishable [[object (image processing)|objects]] in an image, although the term is loosely used by many users of microscopes and telescopes to describe resolving power. In scientific analysis, in general, the term \"resolution\" is used to describe the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] with which any instrument measures and records (in an image or spectrum) any variable in the specimen or sample under study.\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Airy disk spacing near Rayleigh criterion.png|thumb|right|[[Airy disk|Airy diffraction patterns]] generated by light from two [[point source]]s passing through a circular [[aperture]], such as the [[pupil]] of the eye. Points far apart (top) or meeting the Rayleigh criterion (middle) can be distinguished. Points closer than the Rayleigh criterion (bottom) are difficult to distinguish.]]\n\nThe imaging system's resolution can be limited either by [[optical aberration|aberration]] or by [[diffraction]] causing [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] of the image. These two phenomena have different origins and are unrelated. Aberrations can be explained by geometrical optics and can in principle be solved by increasing the optical quality — and consequently the cost — of the system. On the other hand, diffraction comes from the wave nature of light and is determined by the finite aperture of the optical elements. The [[lens (optics)|lens]]' circular [[aperture]] is analogous to a two-dimensional version of the [[Slit experiment|single-slit experiment]]. [[Light]] passing through the lens [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] with itself creating a ring-shape diffraction pattern, known as the [[Airy pattern]], if the [[wavefront]] of the transmitted light is taken to be spherical or plane over the exit aperture.\n\nThe interplay between diffraction and aberration can be characterised by the [[point spread function]]<!--Maybe should go after--> (PSF). The narrower the aperture of a lens the more likely the PSF is dominated by diffraction. In that case, the angular resolution of an optical system can be estimated (from the [[diameter]] of the aperture and the [[wavelength]] of the light) by the Rayleigh criterion defined by [[Lord Rayleigh]]: two point sources are regarded as just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum of one image coincides with the first minimum of the other.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Born |first=M. |authorlink=Max Born\n |last2=Wolf |first2=E. |author2link=Emil Wolf\n |date=1999\n |title=Principles of Optics\n |page=461\n |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n |isbn=0-521-64222-1\n}}</ref><ref name=rayleigy1879>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Lord Rayleigh |first=F.R.S.\n |date=1879\n |title=Investigations in optics, with special reference to the spectroscope\n |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]\n |series=5 |volume=8 |issue=49 |pages=261–274\n |bibcode=\n |doi=10.1080/14786447908639684\n}}</ref> If the distance is greater, the two points are well resolved and if it is smaller, they are regarded as not resolved.

The factor 1.220 is derived from a calculation of the position of the first dark circular ring surrounding the central [[Airy disc]] of the [[diffraction]] pattern.

This result is related to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|Fourier properties]] of a lens.\n\nA similar result holds for a small sensor imaging a subject at infinity: The angular resolution can be converted to a spatial resolution on the sensor by using ''f'' as the distance to the image sensor; this relates the spatial resolution of the image to the [[f-number]], {{f/}}#:\n:<math> \\Delta \\ell \\approx 1.220 \\frac{f \\lambda}{D}=1.22 \\lambda \\cdot (f/\\#)</math>.\nSince this is the radius of the Airy disk, the resolution is better estimated by the diameter, <math> 2.44 \\lambda \\cdot (f/\\#)</math>\n\n==Specific cases==\n[[Image:Diffraction limit diameter vs angular resolution.svg|thumb|Log-log plot of aperture diameter vs angular resolution at the diffraction limit for various light wavelengths compared with various astronomical instruments.

A single optical telescope may have an angular resolution less than one [[arcsecond]], but [[astronomical seeing]] and other atmospheric effects make attaining this very hard.\n\nThe angular resolution ''R'' of a telescope can usually be approximated by\n:<math>R = \\frac {\\lambda}{D} </math>\nwhere ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the observed radiation, and ''D'' is the diameter of the telescope's [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. The Resulting ''R'' is in [[radian]]s. For example, in the case of yellow light with a wavelength of 580&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], for a resolution of 0.1 arc second, we need D=1.2&nbsp;m. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.\n\nThis formula, for light with a wavelength of about 562&nbsp;nm, is also called the [[Dawes' limit]].\n\n===Telescope array===\nThe highest angular resolutions can be achieved by arrays of telescopes called [[astronomical interferometer]]s: These instruments can achieve angular resolutions of 0.001&nbsp;arcsecond at optical wavelengths, and much higher resolutions at x-ray wavelengths. In order to perform [[aperture synthesis|aperture synthesis imaging]], a large number of telescopes are required laid out in a 2-dimensional arrangement with a dimensional precision better than a fraction (0.25x) of the required image resolution.\n\nThe angular resolution ''R'' of an interferometer array can usually be approximated by\n:<math>R=\\frac {\\lambda}{B} </math>\nwhere ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the observed radiation, and ''B'' is the length of the maximum physical separation of the telescopes in the array, called the [[baseline (interferometry)|baseline]]. The resulting ''R'' is in [[radian]]s. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.\n\nFor example, in order to form an image in yellow light with a wavelength of 580&nbsp;nm, for a resolution of 1&nbsp;milli-arcsecond, we need telescopes laid out in an array that is 120&nbsp;m&nbsp;×&nbsp;120&nbsp;m with a dimensional precision better than 145&nbsp;nm.\n\n===Microscope===\nThe resolution ''R'' (here measured as a distance, not to be confused with the angular resolution of a previous subsection) depends on the [[angular aperture]] <math>\\alpha</math>:<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last1=Davidson |first1=M.

In the case that both NAs are the same, the equation may be reduced to:\n:<math>R=\\frac{0.61\\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}}\\approx\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mathrm{NA}}</math>\n\nThe practical limit for <math>\\theta</math> is about 70°. In a dry objective or condenser, this gives a maximum NA of 0.95. In a high-resolution [[oil immersion objective|oil immersion lens]], the maximum NA is typically 1.45, when using immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.52. Due to these limitations, the resolution limit of a light microscope using [[visible light]] is about 200&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]. Given that the shortest wavelength of visible light is [[Violet (color)|violet]] (<math>\\lambda</math> ≈ 400&nbsp;nm),\n\n:<math>R=\\frac{1.22 \\times 400\\,\\mbox{nm}}{1.45\\ +\\ 0.95}=203\\,\\mbox{nm}</math>\n\nwhich is near 200&nbsp;nm.\n\nOil immersion objectives can have practical difficulties due to their shallow depth of field and extremely short working distance, which calls for the use of very thin (0.17&nbsp;mm) cover slips, or, in an inverted microscope, thin glass-bottomed [[Petri dish]]es.\n\nHowever, resolution below this theoretical limit can be achieved using [[super-resolution microscopy]]. These include optical near-fields ([[Near-field scanning optical microscope]]) or a diffraction technique called [[4Pi STED microscopy]].

      "text": "Throughout history, [[angle]]s have been [[measure (mathematics)|measured]] in many different [[unit (measurement)|units]]. The most contemporary units are the [[degree (angle)|degree]] ( ° ) and [[radian]]  (rad), but many others have been used throughout [[History of Mathematics|history]]. The purpose of this page is to aggregate other concepts pertaining to the '''angular unit''', where additional explanation can be provided.\n\n==Angle measurement in general==\nThe size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'' or ''congruent'' or ''equal in measure''.\n\nIn some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\nIn order to measure an angle <var>[[theta|θ]]</var>, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length <var>s</var> of the arc by the radius <var>r</var> of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):\n\n:<math> \\theta = k \\frac{s}{2\\pi r}. </math>\n\nThe value of <var>θ</var> thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''θr''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''θ'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|π}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|π}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''θ'' and 2{{math|π}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|π}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|π}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=Note|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius <var>r</var>, in addition to the issue of \"measurement units chosen.\" A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc. Here \"unit\" can be chosen to be dimensionless in the sense that it is the real number 1 associated with the unit segment on the real line. See R. Dimitric for instance.<ref>R.

The radian is the derived quantity of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system. By definition, it is [[dimensionless]], though it may be specified as ''rad'' to avoid ambiguity. Angles measured in [[degree symbol|degree]]s, are shown with the symbol °. Subdivisions of the degree are [[Minute and second of arc|minute]] (symbol ', 1' = 1/60°) and [[Minute and second of arc|second]] {symbol \", 1\" = 1/3600°}. An angle of 360° corresponds to the angle subtended by a full circle, and is equal to 2π radians, or 400 gradians.\n\nOther units used to represent angles are listed in the following table.

One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493°. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n* [[Milliradian]] and derived definitions: The true milliradian is defined a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] would equal exactly 2000π mil (or approximately 6283.185 mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578 degrees (3.43775 minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817… ≈ {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n==Positive and negative angles==\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative y-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of −''θ'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''θ''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;−45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360°&nbsp;−&nbsp;45° or 315°.  However, a rotation of &nbsp;−45° would not be the same as a rotation of 315°.\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angle are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.\n\n==Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle==\nThere are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the corresponding angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. Gradients are often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of an angle in radians.\n\nIn [[rational geometry]] the ''spread'' between two lines is defined at the square of sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value of the spread between the lines.\n\n===Astronomical approximations===\nAstronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.\n* 0.5° is approximately the width of the sun or moon.\n* 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.\n* 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.\n* 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.\n\nThese measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.\n\n==Measurements that are not angular units==\n\nNot all angle measurements are angular units, for an angular measurement it is definitional that the [[angle addition postulate]] holds.\n\nSome angle measurements where the [[angle addition postulate]] does not holds.\n\n* [[Trigonometric functions]]\n* [[slope]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]"

The [[vector space|vector]] from an observer ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) to a point of interest is [[graphical projection|projected]] [[perpendicular]]ly onto a [[reference plane]]; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.\n\nWhen used as a [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial coordinate]], the azimuth is the [[horizon]]tal direction of a [[star]] or other [[astronomical object]] in the [[sky]]. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5&nbsp;km in radius at [[sea level]]) around an observer on [[planetary surface|Earth's surface]], and the reference vector points to [[true north]]. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the [[horizontal plane]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth |title=Azimuth |work=[[Dictionary.com]]}}</ref>\n\nAzimuth is usually measured in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°). The concept is used in [[navigation]], [[astrometry|astronomy]], [[engineering]], [[map]]ping, mining, and [[ballistics]].\n\n==Navigation==\n[[File:True North Mount Allen.fw.png|thumb|left|Azimuth Marker, Mount Allen ([[Sandstone Peak]]), Southern California, USA.]] In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted [[alpha]], ''α'', and defined as a horizontal angle measured [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] from a north base line or ''[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]''.<ref>U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2</ref><ref>U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, p. 63</ref> ''Azimuth'' has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.<ref>U.S. Army, ch. 6 p. 2</ref><ref>U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24–25</ref><ref>U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (23 December 1944), p. 15</ref>\n\nToday, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically [[true north]], measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units ([[grad (angle)|grad]], [[Angular mil|mil]]) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.\n\nQuite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as \"(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east\" (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated \"S30°E\", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the [[cardinal point]]s, a different notation, e.g. \"due east\", is used instead.\n\n===True north-based azimuths===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ From north\n|-\n| North || align=\"center\" | 0°\n| South || align=\"center\" | 180°\n|-\n| North-northeast || align=\"center\" | 22.5°\n| South-southwest || align=\"center\" | 202.5°\n|-\n| Northeast || align=\"center\" | 45°\n| Southwest || align=\"center\" | 225°\n|-\n| East-northeast || align=\"center\" | 67.5°\n| West-southwest || align=\"center\" | 247.5°\n|-\n| East || align=\"center\" | 90°\n| West || align=\"center\" | 270°\n|-\n| East-southeast || align=\"center\" | 112.5°\n| West-northwest || align=\"center\" | 292.5°\n|-\n| Southeast || align=\"center\" | 135°\n| Northwest || align=\"center\" | 315°\n|-\n| South-southeast || align=\"center\" | 157.5°\n| North-northwest || align=\"center\" | 337.5°\n|}\n\n==Cartographical azimuth==\nThe cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane ([[Spatial reference system|cartographical coordinates]]):\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)</math>\n\nRemark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical [[polar coordinate system]] and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.\nThis is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.\nIf the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.\n\nThe formula in [[radian]]s would be slightly easier:\n:<math>\\alpha = \\operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)</math>\n\n::'''Caveat:''' Most computer libraries (C/C++, Python, Java, ...) reverse the order of the [[atan2]] parameters.\n\n===Calculating coordinates===\nWhen the coordinates (''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''Y''<sub>1</sub>) of one point, the distance ''L'', and the azimuth ''α'' to another point (''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''Y''<sub>2</sub>) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  X_2 &= X_1 + L \\sin\\alpha \\\\\n  Y_2 &= Y_1 + L \\cos\\alpha\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is typically used in [[triangulation]].\n\n==Calculating azimuth==\n[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The azimuth between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projection in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]\nWe are standing at latitude <math>\\varphi_1</math>, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude <math>\\varphi_2</math>, longitude ''L'' (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth ''α'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin L}{\\cos\\varphi_1 \\tan\\varphi_2 - \\sin\\varphi_1 \\cos L}</math>\n\nA better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an ''[[oblate spheroid]]''); ''azimuth'' then has at least two very slightly different meanings. ''Normal-section azimuth'' is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; ''geodetic azimuth'' is the angle between north and the ''geodesic''; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100&nbsp;km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.\n\nVarious websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., [http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/datums/vincenty_inverse.jsp GeoScience Australia site]. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the [[Geographical distance#Ellipsoidal-surface formulae|distance article]].\n\nNormal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate; Bomford says Cunningham's formula is exact for any distance.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of (Guy) Bomford or Cunningham anywhere else on this page|date=September 2015}} If ''f'' is the flattening, and ''e'' the eccentricity, for the chosen spheroid (e.g., {{frac|{{val|298.257223563}}}} for [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]) then\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n         e^2 &= f(2 - f) \\\\\n     1 - e^2 &= (1 - f)^2 \\\\\n     \\Lambda &= \\left(1 - e^2\\right) \\frac{\\tan\\varphi_2}{\\tan\\varphi_1} + e^2\n       \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\left(\\tan\\varphi_2\\right)^2}\n                  {1 + \\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\left(\\tan\\varphi_1\\right)^2}} \\\\\n  \\tan\\alpha &= \\frac{\\sin L}{(\\Lambda - \\cos L)\\sin\\varphi_1}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf ''φ''<sub>1</sub> = 0 then\n\n: <math>\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin L}{\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\tan\\varphi_2}</math>\n\nTo calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace ''φ''<sub>2</sub> with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).\n\n==Mapping==\nThere is a wide variety of [[Map projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projections]]. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.\n[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|right|A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], commonly used by geologists and surveyors to measure azimuth]]\n{|align=left\n|{{comparison_azimuthal_projections.svg|820px|}}\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Astronomy==\nUsed in celestial navigation, an ''azimuth'' is the direction of a celestial body from the observer.<ref>Rutstrum, Carl, The Wilderness Route Finder, University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194</ref> In astronomy, an ''azimuth'' is sometimes referred to as a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]. In modern [[astronomy]] azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.\n(The article on [[Celestial coordinate system|coordinate systems]], for example, uses a convention measuring from the south.) In former times, it was common to refer to azimuth from the south, as it was then zero at the same time that the [[hour angle]] of a [[star]] was zero. This assumes, however, that the star [[culmination|(upper) culminates]] in the south, which is only true if the star's [[declination]] is less than (i.e. further south than) the observer's [[latitude]].\n\n==Other systems==\n\n===Right ascension===\nIf, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the [[celestial equator]], the angles are called [[right ascension]] if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the [[celestial meridian]].\n\n===Horizontal coordinate===\nIn the [[horizontal coordinate system]], used in [[celestial navigation]] and [[satellite dish]] installation, azimuth is one of the two [[coordinate system|coordinates]]. The other is [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], sometimes called elevation above the horizon. See also: [[Sat finder]].\n\n===Polar coordinate===\nIn mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] or [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] is the anticlockwise [[angle]] between the positive ''x''-axis and the projection of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] onto the ''xy''-[[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The angle is the same as an angle in [[polar coordinates]] of the component of the vector in the ''xy''-plane and is normally measured in [[radian]]s rather than degrees. As well as measuring the angle differently, in mathematical applications [[theta]], ''θ'', is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the representation of symbol  [[phi (letter)|phi]] ''φ''.\n\n==Other uses of the word==\nFor [[tape drive|magnetic tape drives]], ''azimuth'' refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.\n\nIn [[sound localization]] experiments and literature, the ''azimuth'' refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.\n\nAn [[azimuth thruster]] in [[shipbuilding]] is a [[propeller]] that can be rotated horizontally.\n\n==Etymology of the word==\nThe word azimuth is in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic ''al-sumūt'', pronounced ''as-sumūt'' in Arabic, meaning \"the directions\" (plural of Arabic ''al-samt'' = \"the direction\"). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the [[astrolabe]] astronomy instrument. The word's first record in English is in the 1390s in ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the ''[[Libros del saber de astronomía]]'' commissioned by [[King Alfonso X]] of Castile.<ref>\"Azimuth\" at [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/602/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']; \"azimut\" at [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/azimut ''Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'']; \"al-Samt\" at [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-samt-SIM_6591 ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam'']; \"azimuth\" at [http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 EnglishWordsOfArabicAncestry.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102020035/http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 |date=January 2, 2014 }}.

When ''unpolarized'' light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarized. This special angle of incidence is named after the Scottish physicist [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]] (1781–1868).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brewster |first1=David |title=On the laws which regulate the polarisation of light by reflexion from transparent bodies |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=U-U_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA125&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1815 |volume=105 |pages=125–159 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1815.0010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Lakhtakia |first=Akhlesh |date=June 1989 |title=Would Brewster recognize today's Brewster angle? |journal=Optics News |doi=10.1364/ON.15.6.000014 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=14–18 |url=http://www.esm.psu.edu/~axl4/lakhtakia/Documents/No087(ON).pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\nWhen light encounters a boundary between two [[medium (optics)|media]] with different [[refractive index|refractive indices]], some of it is usually reflected as shown in the figure above. The fraction that is reflected is described by the [[Fresnel equations]], and is dependent upon the incoming light's polarization and angle of incidence.\n\nThe Fresnel equations predict that light with the ''p'' polarization ([[electric field]] polarized in the same [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] as the [[incident ray]] and the [[surface normal]] at the point of incidence) will not be reflected if the angle of incidence is \n:<math>\\theta_\\mathrm{B} = \\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\!,</math>\nwhere ''n''<sub>1</sub> is the [[refractive index]] of the initial medium through which the light propagates (the \"incident medium\"), and ''n''<sub>2</sub> is the index of the other medium. This equation is known as '''Brewster's law''', and the angle defined by it is Brewster's angle.\n\nThe physical mechanism for this can be qualitatively understood from the manner in which electric [[dipole]]s in the media respond to ''p''-polarized light. One can imagine that light incident on the surface is absorbed, and then re-radiated by oscillating electric dipoles at the interface between the two media. The polarization of freely propagating light is always perpendicular to the direction in which the light is travelling. The dipoles that produce the transmitted (refracted) light oscillate in the polarization direction of that light. These same oscillating dipoles also generate the reflected light. However, dipoles do not radiate any energy in the direction of the [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]]. If the refracted light is ''p''-polarized and propagates exactly perpendicular to the direction in which the light is predicted to be [[specular reflection|specularly reflected]], the dipoles point along the specular reflection direction and therefore no light can be reflected. (See diagram, above)\n\nWith simple geometry this condition can be expressed as\n:<math>\\theta_1 + \\theta_2 = 90^\\circ,</math>\nwhere ''θ''<sub>1</sub> is the angle of reflection (or incidence) and ''θ''<sub>2</sub> is the angle of refraction.\n\nUsing [[Snell's law]],\n:<math>n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2,</math>\none can calculate the incident angle {{nobreak|1=''θ''<sub>1</sub> = ''θ''<sub>B</sub>}} at which no light is reflected:\n:<math>n_1 \\sin \\theta_\\mathrm{B} = n_2 \\sin(90^\\circ - \\theta_\\mathrm{B}) = n_2 \\cos \\theta_\\mathrm{B}.</math>\n\nSolving for ''θ''<sub>B</sub> gives\n:<math>\\theta_\\mathrm{B} = \\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\!.</math>\n\nFor a glass medium ({{nobreak|1=''n''<sub>2</sub> ≈ 1.5}}) in air ({{nobreak|1=''n''<sub>1</sub> ≈ 1}}), Brewster's angle for visible light is approximately 56°, while for an air-water interface ({{nobreak|1=''n''<sub>2</sub> ≈ 1.33}}), it is approximately 53°. Since the refractive index for a given medium changes depending on the wavelength of light, Brewster's angle will also vary with wavelength.\n\nThe phenomenon of light being polarized by reflection from a surface at a particular angle was first observed by [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] in 1808.<ref>See:\n*  Malus (1809) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hnJKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA143#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Sur une propriété de la lumière réfléchie\"] (On a property of reflected light), ''Mémoires de physique et de chimie de la Société d'Arcueil'', '''2''' :  143–158.\n*  Malus, E.L.

On new physical properties that light acquires by the influence of bodies that refract it or reflect it.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1LNIv6MFH2cC&pg=PA413#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 413–449.]</ref> He attempted to relate the polarizing angle to the refractive index of the material, but was frustrated by the inconsistent quality of glasses available at that time. In 1815, Brewster experimented with higher-quality materials and showed that this angle was a function of the refractive index, defining Brewster's law.\n\nBrewster's angle is often referred to as the \"polarizing angle\", because light that reflects from a surface at this angle is entirely polarized perpendicular to the [[plane of incidence]] (\"''s''-polarized\"). A glass plate or a stack of plates placed at Brewster's angle in a light beam can, thus, be used as a [[polarizer]]. The concept of a polarizing angle can be extended to the concept of a Brewster wavenumber to cover planar interfaces between two linear [[bianisotropic material]]s. In the case of reflection at Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted rays are mutually perpendicular.\n\nFor magnetic materials, Brewster's angle can exist for only one of the incident wave polarizations, as determined by the relative strengths of the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Giles |first1=C.

In a large range of angles around Brewster's angle, the reflection of ''p''-polarized light is lower than ''s''-polarized light. Thus, if the sun is low in the sky, reflected light is mostly ''s''-polarized. Polarizing sunglasses use a polarizing material such as [[Polaroid (polarizer)|Polaroid]] sheets to block horizontally-polarized light, preferentially blocking reflections from horizontal surfaces. The effect is strongest with smooth surfaces such as water, but reflections from roads and the ground are also reduced.\n\nPhotographers use the same principle to remove reflections from water so that they can photograph objects beneath the surface. In this case, the [[Polarizing filter (photography)|polarizing filter]] camera attachment can be rotated to be at the correct angle (see figure).\n\n[[Image:Poloriser-demo.jpg|center|frame|Photographs taken of a window with a camera polarizer filter rotated to two different angles. In the picture at left, the polarizer is aligned with the polarization angle of the window reflection. In the picture at right, the polarizer has been rotated 90°, eliminating the heavily polarized reflected sunlight.]]\n\nWhen recording a [[Holography|hologram]], light is typically incident at Brewster's angle. Because the incident light is p-polarized, it is not back reflected from the transparent back-plane of the holographic film. This avoids unwanted interference effects in the [[Holography|hologram]].\n\nBrewster angle prisms are used in laser physics. The polarized laser light enters the prism at Brewster's angle without any reflective losses.\n\nIn surface science, [[Brewster angle microscope]]s are used in imaging layers of particles or molecules at air-liquid interfaces. By using a laser aimed at Brewster's angle to the interface, the pure liquid appears black in the image whereas molecule layers give out a reflection that can be detected and presented with a camera.\n\n===Brewster windows=== <!--Brewster window redirects here.-->\n[[Image:Brewster window.svg|thumb|right|A Brewster window]]\n[[Gas laser]]s typically use a window tilted at Brewster's angle to allow the beam to leave the laser tube. Since the window reflects some ''s''-polarized light but no ''p''-polarized light, the round trip loss for the ''s'' polarization is higher than that of the ''p'' polarization. This causes the laser's output to be ''p'' polarized due to competition between the two modes.<ref name=Hecht>''Optics'', 3rd edition, Hecht, {{ISBN|0-201-30425-2}}</ref>\n\n== Pseudo-Brewster's angle {{anchor|Pseudo}} ==\nWhen the reflecting surface is absorbing, reflectivity at parallel polarization (''p'') goes through a non-zero minimum at the so-called '''pseudo-Brewster's angle'''.<ref>{{cite journal |date=14 September 1994 |title=Fresnel's interface reflection coefficients for the parallel and perpendicular polarizations: global properties and facts not found in your textbook |first=Rasheed M.

It is seen that <math>f</math> maps pairs of lines intersecting at 90° to pairs of curves still intersecting at 90°.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''conformal map''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that preserves [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] and [[angle]]s locally. In the most common case, the function has a [[Domain of a function|domain]] and an [[Image (mathematics)|image]] in the [[complex plane]].\n\nMore formally, let <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> be open subsets of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>.  A function <math>f:U\\to V</math> is called '''conformal''' (or '''angle-preserving''') at a point <math>u_0\\in U</math> if it preserves angles between directed [[curve]]s through <math>u_0</math>, as well as preserving  orientation  (i.e. mapping a tangent basis to a basis of the same orientation). Conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or [[curvature]].\n\nThe conformal property may be described in terms of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] derivative matrix of a [[coordinate transformation]]. If the Jacobian matrix of the transformation is everywhere a scalar times an orientation-preserving [[rotation matrix]], then the transformation is conformal.\n\nThe notion of conformality generalizes in a natural way to maps between [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or [[Semi-Riemannian manifold|semi-Riemannian manifolds]].\n\n==Complex analysis==\nAn important family of examples of conformal maps comes from  [[complex analysis]]. If <math>U</math> is an [[open set|open subset]] of the complex plane <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, then a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f:U\\to\\mathbb{C}</math> is conformal [[if and only if]] it is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] and its [[derivative]] is everywhere non-zero on <math>U</math>. If <math>f</math> is [[antiholomorphic function|antiholomorphic]] (that is, the [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] to a holomorphic function), it still preserves angles, but it reverses their orientation.\n\nIn the literature, there is another definition of conformal maps; a map <math>f</math> defined on an open set is said to be conformal if it is one-to-one and holomorphic. Since a one-to-one map defined on a non-empty open set cannot be constant, the open mapping theorem forces the inverse function (defined on the image of <math>f</math>) to be holomorphic. Thus, under this definition, a map is conformal [[if and only if]] it is biholomorphic. The two definitions for conformal maps are not equivalent. Being one-to-one and holomorphic implies having a non-zero derivative. However, the exponential function is a holomorphic function with a nonzero derivative, but is not one-to-one since it is periodic.<ref>Richard M. Timoney (2004), [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~richardt/414/414-ch7.pdf Riemann mapping theorem] from [[Trinity College, Dublin]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Riemann mapping theorem]], one of the profound results of complex analysis, states that any non-empty open [[simply connected]] proper subset of <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> admits a [[bijection|bijective]] conformal map to the open [[unit disk]] in <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nA map of the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] (which is [[conformally equivalent]] to a sphere) [[surjection|onto]] itself is conformal if and only if it is a [[Möbius transformation]]. Again, for the [[complex conjugate|conjugate]], angles are preserved, but orientation is reversed.\n\nAn example of the latter is taking the reciprocal of the conjugate, which corresponds to '''circle inversion''' with respect to the unit circle. This can also be expressed as taking the reciprocal of the radial coordinate in [[Circular coordinates#Circular coordinates|circular coordinates]], keeping the angle the same. See also [[inversive geometry]].\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\n{{see also|Conformal geometry}}\nIn [[Riemannian geometry]], two [[Riemannian metric]]s <math>g</math> and <math>h</math> on a smooth manifold <math>M</math> are called '''conformally equivalent''' if <math> g = u h </math> for some positive function <math>u</math> on <math>M</math>. The function <math>u</math> is called the '''conformal factor'''.\n\nA [[diffeomorphism]] between two Riemannian manifolds is called a '''conformal map''' if the pulled back metric is conformally equivalent to the original one.  For example, [[stereographic projection]] of a [[sphere]] onto the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] augmented with a [[point at infinity]] is a conformal map.\n\nOne can also define a '''conformal structure''' on a smooth manifold, as a class of conformally equivalent [[Riemannian metric]]s.\n\n==Higher-dimensional Euclidean space==\nA classical theorem of [[Joseph Liouville]] called [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] shows the higher-dimensions have less varied conformal maps:\n\nAny conformal map on a portion of [[Euclidean space]] of dimension greater than 2 can be composed from three types of transformation: a [[homothetic transformation]], an [[isometry]], and a special conformal transformation. (A ''[[special conformal transformation]]'' is the composition of a reflection and an [[Circle inversion|inversion in a sphere]].)  Thus, the set of conformal transformations in spaces of dimension greater than 2 is much more restricted than in the planar case, where the [[Riemann mapping theorem]] provides a large set of conformal transformations.\n\n==Uses==\nIn [[cartography]], several named [[map projection]]s, including the [[Mercator projection]] and the [[stereographic projection]] are conformal. These enjoy the property that the distortion of shapes can be made as small as desired by making the diameter of the mapped region small enough. See [[Conformal map projection]].\n\nConformal mappings are invaluable for solving problems in engineering and physics that can be expressed in terms of functions of a complex variable yet exhibit inconvenient geometries. By choosing an appropriate mapping, the analyst can transform the inconvenient geometry into a much more convenient one. For example, one may wish to calculate the electric field, <math>E(z)</math>, arising from a point charge located near the corner of two conducting planes separated by a certain angle (where <math>z</math> is the complex coordinate of a point in 2-space). This problem ''per se'' is quite clumsy to solve in closed form. However, by employing a very simple conformal mapping, the inconvenient angle is mapped to one of precisely <math>\\pi</math> radians, meaning that the corner of two planes is transformed to a straight line. In this new domain, the problem (that of calculating the electric field impressed by a point charge located near a conducting wall) is quite easy to solve. The solution is obtained in this domain, <math>E(w)</math>, and then mapped back to the original domain by noting that <math>w</math> was obtained as a function (''viz''., the [[function composition|composition]] of <math>E</math> and <math>w</math>) of <math>z</math>, whence <math>E(w)</math> can be viewed as <math>E(w(z))</math>, which is a function of <math>z</math>, the original coordinate basis. Note that this application is not a contradiction to the fact that conformal mappings preserve angles, they do so only for points in the interior of their domain, and not at the boundary. Another example is the application of conformal mapping technique for solving the [[boundary value problem]] of [[Slosh dynamics|liquid sloshing]] in tanks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kolaei|first=Amir|last2=Rakheja|first2=Subhash|last3=Richard|first3=Marc J.|date=2014-01-06|title=Range of applicability of the linear fluid slosh theory for predicting transient lateral slosh and roll stability of tank vehicles|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X13007360|journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration|volume=333|issue=1|pages=263–282|doi=10.1016/j.jsv.2013.09.002}}</ref>\n\nIf a function is [[harmonic function|harmonic]] (that is, it satisfies [[Laplace's equation]] <math>\\nabla^2 f=0</math>) over a plane domain (which is two-dimensional), and is transformed via a conformal map to another plane domain, the transformation is also harmonic.  For this reason, any function which is defined by a [[potential]] can be transformed by a conformal map and still remain governed by a potential.  Examples in [[physics]] of equations defined by a potential include the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and, in [[fluid dynamics]], [[potential flow]], which is an approximation to fluid flow assuming constant [[density]], zero [[viscosity]], and [[irrotational vector field|irrotational flow]].  One example of a fluid dynamic application of a conformal map is the [[Joukowsky transform]].\n\nA large group of conformal maps for relating solutions of [[Maxwell's equations]] was identified by [[Ebenezer Cunningham]] (1908) and [[Harry Bateman]] (1910) (see [[spherical wave transformation]]). Their training at Cambridge University had given them facility with the [[method of image charges]] and associated methods of images for spheres and inversion. As recounted by Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory'':\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warwick|first1=Andrew|title=Masters of theory : Cambridge and the rise of mathematical physics|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=404–424|isbn=978-0226873756}}</ref>\n\n: Each four-dimensional solution could be inverted in a four-dimensional hyper-sphere of pseudo-radius <math>K</math> in order to produce a new solution.\nWarwick highlights this \"new theorem of relativity\" as a Cambridge response to Einstein, and as founded on exercises using the method of inversion, such as found in [[James Hopwood Jeans]] textbook ''Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism''.\n\nIn [[general relativity]], conformal maps are the simplest and thus most common type of causal transformations. Physically, these describe different universes in which all the same events and interactions are still (causally) possible, but a new additional force is necessary to effect this (that is, replication of all the same trajectories would necessitate departures from [[geodesic]] motion because the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] is different). It is often used to try to make models amenable to extension beyond [[Gravitational singularity|curvature singularities]], for example to permit description of the universe even before the [[Big Bang]].\n\n==Pseudo-Riemannian geometry==\nIn differential geometry a mapping is conformal ''when angles are preserved''. When the angle is related to the metric, it is sufficient for the mapping to result in a metric that is proportional to the original, as expressed above for Riemannian geometry or in the case of a [[conformal manifold]] with the type of [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] used in [[general relativity]]. An elementary consideration of [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] mapping and linear algebra reveals potentially three types of angles: [[angle|circular angle]], [[hyperbolic angle]], and [[slope]]:\n\nSuppose <math>f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}</math> is a mapping of surfaces parameterized by <math>(x,y)</math> and <math>(u,v)</math>. The [[Jacobian matrix]] of <math>f</math> is formed by the four [[partial derivative]]s of <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> with respect to <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\nIf the Jacobian <math>g</math> has a non-zero [[determinant]], then <math>f</math> is '''conformal with respect to one of the three angle types''', depending on the [[2 × 2 real matrices|real matrix]] expressed by the Jacobian <math>g</math>.\n\nIndeed, any such <math>g</math> lies in a particular ''planar'' commutative [[subring]], and <math>g</math> has a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] determined by parameters of radial and angular nature. The radial parameter corresponds to a [[similarity (geometry)|similarity mapping]] and can be taken as 1 for purposes of conformal examination. The angular parameter of <math>g</math> is one of the three types, slope, hyperbolic, or circular:\n* When the subring is isomorphic to the [[dual number]] plane, then <math>g</math> acts as a [[shear mapping]] and preserves the dual angle.\n* When the subring is isomorphic to the [[split-complex number]] plane, then <math>g</math> acts as a [[squeeze mapping]] and preserves the hyperbolic angle.\n* When the subring is isomorphic to the ordinary [[complex number]] plane, then <math>g</math> acts as a [[rotation]] and preserves the circular angle.\nWhile describing analytic [[motor variable#Bireal variable|functions of a bireal variable]], U. Bencivenga and G. Fox have written about conformal maps that preserve the hyperbolic angle. In general, a [[linear fractional transformation]] on any one of the types of complex plane listed provides a conformal map.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Carathéodory's theorem (conformal mapping)|Carathéodory's theorem]] – A conformal map extends continuously to the boundary\n* [[Penrose diagram]]\n* [[Schwarz–Christoffel mapping]] – a conformal transformation of the upper half-plane onto the interior of a simple polygon\n* [[Special linear group]] – transformations that preserve volume (as opposed to angles) and orientation\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Ahlfors | first1=Lars V. | title=Conformal invariants: topics in geometric function theory | publisher=McGraw–Hill Book Co. | location=New York | mr=0357743 | year=1973}}\n* [[Constantin Carathéodory]] (1932) ''Conformal Representation'', Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Physics\n* {{Citation |last=Chanson |first=H. |authorlink=Hubert Chanson |title=Applied Hydrodynamics: An Introduction to Ideal and Real Fluid Flows |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:191112 |publisher=CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Leiden, The Netherlands, 478 pages |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-415-49271-3}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Churchill | first1=Ruel V. | authorlink=Ruel Churchill|title=Complex Variables and Applications | publisher=McGraw–Hill Book Co. | location=New York | isbn=978-0-07-010855-4 | year=1974}}\n* {{springer|id=C/c024780|title=Conformal mapping|author=E.P.

It quantifies the [[wetting|wettability]] of a solid surface by a liquid via the Young equation. A given system of solid, liquid, and vapor at a given temperature and pressure has a unique equilibrium contact angle.

This nonlinear equation correctly predicts the sign and magnitude of κ, the flattening of the contact angle at very small scales, and contact angle hysteresis.\n\n===Contact Angle Hysteresis===\nA given substrate-liquid-vapor combination yields a continuous range of contact angle values in practice. The maximum contact angle is referred to as the advancing contact angle and the minimum contact angle is referred to as the receding contact angle. The advancing and receding contact angles are measured from dynamic experiments where droplets or liquid bridges are in movement.<ref name=\"CAH\" /> In contrast, the equilibrium contact angle described by the Young-LaPlace equation is measured from a static state. Static measurements yield values in-between the advancing and receding contact angle depending on deposition parameters (e.g. velocity, angle, and drop size) and drop history (e.g. evaporation from time of deposition). Contact angle hysteresis is defined as <math>\\theta_\\mathrm{A} - \\theta_\\mathrm{R}</math>although the term is also used to describe the expression <math>\\cos\\theta_\\mathrm{R}-\\cos\\theta_\\mathrm{A}</math>.The static, advancing, or receding contact angle can be used in place of the equilibrium contact angle depending on the application.\n\nThe advancing contact angle can be described as a measure of the liquid-solid cohesion while the receding contact angle is a measure of liquid-solid adhesion. The advancing and receding contact angles can be measured directly using different methods and can also be calculated from other wetting measurements such as force tensiometery (aka [[Wilhelmy plate|Wilhemy-Plate]] method).\n\nAdvancing and receding contact angles can be measured directly from the same measurement if drops are moved linearly on a surface. For example, a drop of liquid will adopt a given contact angle when static, but when the surface is tilted the drop will initially deform so that the contact area between the drop and surface remains constant. The \"downhill\" side of the drop will adopt a higher contact angle while the \"uphill\" side of the drop will adopt a lower contact angle. As the tilt angle increases the contact angles will continue to change but the contact area between the drop and surface will remain constant. At a given surface tilt angle, the advancing and receding contact angles will be met and the drop will move on the surface. In practice, the measurement can be influenced by shear forces and momentum if the tilt velocity is high. The measurement method can also be challenging in practice for systems with high (>30 degrees) or low (<10 degrees) contact angle hysteresis.\n\nAdvancing and receding contact angle measurements can be carried out by adding and removing liquid from a drop deposited on a surface. If a sufficiently small volume of liquid is added to a drop, the contact line will still be pinned, and the contact angle will increase. Similarly, if a small  amount of liquid is removed from a drop, the contact angle will decrease.\n\nThe Young's equation assumes a homogeneous surface and does not account for surface texture or outside forces such as gravity. Real surfaces are not atomically smooth or chemically homogeneous so a drop will assume contact angle hysteresis.

One consequence of these barriers is contact angle [[hysteresis]]: the extent of wetting, and therefore the observed contact angle (averaged along the contact line), depends on whether the liquid is advancing or receding on the surface.\n\nBecause liquid advances over previously dry surface but recedes from previously wet surface, contact angle hysteresis can also arise if the solid has been altered due to its previous contact with the liquid (e.g., by a chemical reaction, or absorption). Such alterations, if slow, can also produce measurably time-dependent contact angles.\n\n===Effect of roughness to contact angles===\nSurface roughness has a strong effect on the contact angle and wettability of a surface. The effect of roughness depends on if the droplet will wet the surface grooves or if air pockets will be left between the droplet and the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/516902/Pdf/Attension/Theory%20Notes/AT-TN-07-Surface-roughness-CA-wettability.pdf?t=1509632879462|title=Influence of surface roughness on contact angle and wettability|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIf the surface is wetted homogeneously, the droplet is in Wenzel state.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wenzel|first=Robert N.|date=1936-08-01|title=RESISTANCE OF SOLID SURFACES TO WETTING BY WATER|journal=Industrial & Engineering Chemistry|volume=28|issue=8|pages=988–994|doi=10.1021/ie50320a024|issn=0019-7866}}</ref> In Wenzel state, adding surface roughness will enhance the wettability caused by the chemistry of the surface.

If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the solid molecules then the liquid drop will completely spread out on the solid surface, corresponding to a contact angle of 0°.

Many [[polymer]]s exhibit hydrophobic surfaces. Highly hydrophobic surfaces made of low surface energy (e.g. [[fluorination|fluorinated]]) materials may have water contact angles as high as ≈120°.<ref name=zisman/> Some materials with highly rough surfaces may have a water contact angle even greater than 150°, due to the presence of air pockets under the liquid drop. These are called [[superhydrophobe|superhydrophobic]] surfaces.\n\nIf the contact angle is measured through the gas instead of through the liquid, then it should be replaced by 180° minus their given value. Contact angles are equally applicable to the interface of two liquids, though they are more commonly measured in solid products such as [[cookware#Non-stick|non-stick pans]] and [[waterproof fabric]]s.\n\n==Control of contact angles==\nControl of the wetting contact angle can often be achieved through the deposition or incorporation of various organic and inorganic molecules onto the surface. This is often achieved through the use of specialty silane chemicals which can form a SAM (self-assembled monolayers) layer. With the proper selection of the organic molecules with varying molecular structures and amounts of hydrocarbon and/or perfluoronated terminations, the contact angle of the surface can tune. The deposition of these specialty silanes<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://ma.ecsdl.org/content/MA2006-01/23/781.abstract|author1=Kobrin, B. |author2=Zhang, T. |author3=Chinn, J.  |chapter=Choice of precursors in Vapor-phase Surface Modification|title=209th Electrochemical Society meeting, May 7–12, 2006, Denver, CO}}</ref> can be achieved in the gas phase through the use of a specialized vacuum ovens or liquid-phase process.

The angle formed between the liquid–solid interface and the liquid–vapor interface is the contact angle. Older systems used a microscope optical system with a back light. Current-generation systems employ high resolution cameras and software to capture and analyze the contact angle. Angles measured in such a way are often quite close to advancing contact angles. Equilibrium contact angles can be obtained through the application of well defined vibrations.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Volpe, C.

A common type of dynamic sessile drop study determines the largest contact angle possible without increasing its solid–liquid interfacial area by adding volume dynamically. This maximum angle is the advancing angle. Volume is removed to produce the smallest possible angle, the receding angle. The difference between the advancing and receding angle is the contact angle [[hysteresis]].\n\n===Dynamic Wilhelmy method===\n[[File:Dynamic contact angle Attension Sigma.png|alt=Measuring dynamic contact angle of a rod/fiber with a force tensiometer.|thumb|Measuring dynamic contact angle of a rod/fiber with a force tensiometer.]]\nA method for calculating average advancing and receding contact angles on solids of uniform geometry. Both sides of the solid must have the same properties. Wetting force on the solid is measured as the solid is immersed in or withdrawn from a liquid of known surface tension. Also in that case it is possible to measure the equilibrium contact angle by applying a very controlled vibration.

This effect, known as [[Axial precession|precession]], causes the coordinates of stationary celestial objects to change continuously, if rather slowly. Therefore, [[Equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]] (including declination) are inherently relative to the year of their observation, and astronomers specify them with reference to a particular year, known as an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. Coordinates from different epochs must be mathematically rotated to match each other, or to match a standard epoch.<ref>Moulton (1918), pp. 92–95.</ref>\n\nThe currently used standard epoch is [[J2000.0]], which is January 1, 2000 at 12:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]. The prefix \"J\" indicates that it is a [[Julian epoch]].

The declinations of [[Solar System]] objects change very rapidly compared to those of stars, due to [[orbit|orbital motion]] and close proximity.\n\nAs seen from locations in the Earth's [[Northern Hemisphere]], celestial objects with declinations greater than 90°&nbsp;−&nbsp;{{math|''φ''}} (where {{math|''φ''}} = observer's [[latitude]]) appear to circle daily around the [[celestial pole]] without dipping below the [[horizon]], and are therefore called [[circumpolar star]]s. This similarly occurs in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] for objects with declinations less (i.e. more negative) than −90°&nbsp;−&nbsp;{{math|''φ''}} (where {{math|''φ''}} is always a [[negative number]] for southern latitudes). An extreme example is the [[pole star]] which has a declination near to +90°, so is circumpolar as seen from anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere except very close to the equator.\n\nCircumpolar stars never dip below the horizon. Conversely, there are other stars that never rise above the horizon, as seen from any given point on the Earth's surface (except extremely close to the [[equator]]. Upon flat terrain, the distance has to be within approximately 2&nbsp;km, although this varies based upon the observer's altitude and surrounding terrain). Generally, if a star whose declination is {{math|''δ''}} is circumpolar for some observer (where {{math|''δ''}} is either positive or negative), then a star whose declination is −{{math|''δ''}} never rises above the horizon, as seen by the same observer. (This neglects the effect of [[atmospheric refraction]].) Likewise, if a star is circumpolar for an observer at latitude {{math|''φ''}}, then it never rises above the horizon as seen by an observer at latitude −{{math|''φ''}}.\n\nNeglecting atmospheric refraction, declination is always 0° at east and west points of the [[horizon]]. At the north point, it is 90°&nbsp;−&nbsp;|{{math|''φ''}}|, and at the south point, −90° + |{{math|''φ''}}|. From the [[Geographical pole|poles]], declination is uniform around the entire horizon, approximately 0°.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''[[Star]]s visible by [[latitude]]'''\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#89cff0; text-align:center;\" |'''Observer's [[latitude]] (°)'''\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#f4c2c2; text-align:center;\"| '''Declination'''\n|- align = \"center\"\n|  style=\"background:#f4c2c2;\" |'''of [[circumpolar star]]s (°)'''\n|  style=\"background:#f4c2c2;\" |'''of non-circumpolar stars (°)'''\n|  style=\"background:#f4c2c2;\" |'''of stars not visible (°)'''\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f4c2c2;\" | + for north latitude, − for south\n| style=\"background:#f4c2c2;\" | &nbsp;\n| style=\"background:#f4c2c2;\" | − for north latitude, + for south\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 90 ([[Geographical pole|Pole]])\n| 90 to 0 || {{N/A}} || 0 to 90\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 66.5 ([[arctic circle|Arctic]]/[[antarctic circle|Antarctic Circle]])\n| 90 to 23.5 || +23.5 to −23.5 || 23.5 to 90\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 45 ([[45th parallel north|midpoint]])\n| 90 to 45 || +45 to −45 || 45 to 90\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 23.5 ([[Tropic of Cancer]]/[[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]])\n| 90 to 66.5 || +66.5 to −66.5 || 66.5 to 90\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 0 ([[Equator]])\n| {{N/A}} || +90 to −90 || {{N/A}}\n|-\n|}\nNon-circumpolar stars are visible only during certain days or [[season]]s of the year.\n\n[[File:Stars and dec.png|thumb|600px|center|The night sky, divided into two halves.

Likewise, near the local winter solstice, the Sun remains below the horizon all day, which is called [[polar night]].\n\n==Relation to latitude==\nWhen an object is directly overhead its declination is almost always within 0.01 degrees of the observer's latitude; it would be exactly equal except for two complications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austincc.edu/jheath/Stellar/Hand/ccord.htm|title=Celestial Coordinates|website=www.austincc.edu|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>\n<ref>[https://web.ecs.baylor.edu/faculty/grady/EGR1301_FALL2015_Masters_1stEd_Chapter7_The_Solar_Resource.pdf ''baylor.edu'']</ref>\n\nThe first complication applies to all celestial objects: the object's declination equals the observer's astronomic latitude, but the term \"latitude\" ordinarily means geodetic latitude, which is the latitude on maps and GPS devices. In the continental United States and surrounding area, the difference (the [[vertical deflection]]) is typically a few [[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] (1 arcsecond = {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree) but can be as great as 41 arcseconds.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID/USDOV2009/\n|title = USDOV2009\n|date = 2011\n|publisher = [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]]\n|location = Silver Spring, Maryland\n}}</ref>\n\nThe second complication is that, assuming no deflection of the vertical, \"overhead\" means perpendicular to the ellipsoid at observer's location, but the perpendicular line does not pass through the center of the earth; almanacs provide declinations measured at the center of the Earth.

      "text": "{{Nofootnotes|date=April 2018}}\n\n:''For other senses of this word, see [[Elevation (disambiguation)]].''\n\nIn [[ballistics]], the '''elevation''' is the [[angle]] between the [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and the axial direction of the [[barrel (firearms)|barrel]] of a [[gun]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or heavy [[artillery]].  Originally, elevation was a ''linear'' measure of how high the gunners had to physically lift the [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] of a gun up from the [[gun carriage]] to compensate for projectile drop and hit targets at a certain distance.\n\n==Pre-WWI and WWI==\nThough early 20th-century firearms were relatively easy to fire, artillery was not. Before and during [[World War I]], the only way to effectively fire artillery was plotting points on a plane.\n\nMost artillery units seldom employed their cannons in small numbers. Instead of using pin-point artillery firing they used old means of \"[[fire for effect]]\" using artillery en masse. This tactic was employed successfully by past armies.\n\nBut changes have been made since past wars and in World War I, artillery was more accurate than before, although not as accurate as artillery one century newer. The tactics of artillery from previous wars were carried on, and still had similar success. [[Warships]] and [[battleships]] also carried large caliber guns that needed to be elevated to certain degrees to accurately hit targets, and they also had the similar drawbacks of land artillery.\n\n==WWII and beyond==\n\nAs time passed on, more accurate artillery guns were made, and they came in different varieties. Small artillery pieces were used as [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, medium sized artillery guns became [[tank gun]]s, and the largest artillery guns became long range land [[Artillery battery|batteries]] and battleship armaments.\n\nWith the introduction of better tanks in [[World War II]], elevation was once again a problem for tank gunners, which had to aim through the [[Gunner's Auxiliary Sight]]s (GAS) or even through [[iron sight]]s. Though the problem was not that evident as tanks fired rounds at a higher [[velocity]] than normal artillery, making aiming less of a hassle.\n\nAs with World War I, World War II artillery was almost like its old counterpart. But in the war came the introduction of the FCS or the [[fire-control system]], which made firing artillery accurately easier.\n\nWith the advancements in the 21st century, it has become easy to determine how much elevation a gun needed to hit a target. The [[laser rangefinder]] is a component of FCS, and can accurately determine the range of the target, thereby calculating how much elevation the gun needs, making today's guns highly accurate.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Altitude (astronomy)]]\n*[[Pitching moment]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* '''Gunnery Instructions, U.S. Navy''' (1913), Register No. 4090 [https://archive.org/stream/gunneryinstructi00unit]\n* '''Gunnery And Explosives For Artillery Officers''' (1911) [https://archive.org/details/gunneryexplosive00unitrich]\n* '''Fire Control Fundamentals''', NAVPERS 91900 (1953), Part C: The Projectile in Flight - Exterior Ballistics [http://www.maritime.org/doc/firecontrol/partc.htm]\n* '''FM 6-40''', Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Field Artillery Manual Cannon Gunnery (23 April 1996), Chapter 3 - Ballistics; Marine Corps Warfighting Publication No. 3-1.6.19 [https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/docs/fm6-40-ch3.htm]\n* '''FM 23-91''', Mortar Gunnery (1 March 2000), Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Mortar Gunnery [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/23-91/ch2.htm]\n* '''Fundamentals of Naval Weapons Systems: Chapter 19''' (Weapons and Systems Engineering Department United States Naval Academy) [https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/fun/index.html]\n* '''Naval Ordnance and Gunnery''' (Vol.1 - Naval Ordnance) NAVPERS 10797-A (1957)\n* '''Naval Ordnance and Gunnery''' (Vol.2 - Fire Control) NAVPERS 10798-A (1957)\n* '''Naval Ordnance and Gunnery''' [http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/sps/rotc/pdf/ms2/naval-ordinance-gunnery-b.pdf]\n{{refend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elevation (Ballistics)}}\n[[Category:Ballistics]]\n[[Category:Angle]]"

      "text": "[[Image:Hyperbolic sector.svg|thumb|200px|right|A hyperbolic angle is a figure enclosed by two rays and a hyperbolic arc]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''hyperbolic angle''' is a geometric figure that defines a [[hyperbolic sector]]. The relationship of a hyperbolic angle to a hyperbola parallels the relationship of an \"ordinary\" [[angle]] to a [[circle]].\n\nThe magnitude of the hyperbolic angle is the [[area]] of the corresponding hyperbolic sector.\n\nHyperbolic angle is used as the [[dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] for the [[hyperbolic function]]s sinh, cosh, and tanh, because these functions may be premised on hyperbolic analogies to the corresponding circular trigonometric functions by regarding a hyperbolic angle as defining a [[hyperbolic sector#Hyperbolic triangle|hyperbolic triangle]].\nThe parameter thus becomes one of the most useful in the [[calculus]] of [[real number|real]] variables.\n\n==Definition==\nConsider the rectangular hyperbola <math>\\textstyle\\{(x,\\frac 1 x): x>0\\}</math>, and (by convention) pay particular attention to the ''branch'' <math>x > 1</math>.\n\nFirst define:\n* The hyperbolic angle in ''standard position'' is the [[angle]] at <math>(0, 0)</math> between the ray to <math>(1, 1)</math> and the ray to <math>\\textstyle(x, \\frac 1 x)</math>, where <math>x > 1</math>.\n* The magnitude of this angle is the [[area]] of the corresponding [[hyperbolic sector]], which turns out to be <math>\\operatorname{ln}x</math>.\n\nNote that, because of the role played by the [[natural logarithm]]:\n* Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is ''unbounded'' (because <math>\\operatorname{ln}x</math> is unbounded); this is related to the fact that the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] is unbounded.\n* The formula for the magnitude of the angle suggests that, for <math>0 < x < 1</math>, the hyperbolic angle should be negative. This reflects the fact that, as defined, the angle is ''directed''.\n\nFinally, extend the definition of ''hyperbolic angle'' to that subtended by any interval on the hyperbola. Suppose <math>a, b, c, d</math> are [[positive real numbers]] such that <math>ab = cd = 1</math> and <math>c > a > 1</math>, so that <math>(a, b)</math> and <math>(c, d)</math> are points on the hyperbola <math>xy=1</math> and determine an interval on it. Then the [[squeeze mapping]] <math>\\textstyle f:(x, y)\\to(bx, ay)</math> maps the angle <math>\\angle\\!\\left ((a, b), (0,0), (c, d)\\right)</math> to the ''standard position'' angle <math>\\angle\\!\\left ((1, 1), (0,0), (bc, ad)\\right)</math>. By the result of [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]], the hyperbolic sectors determined by these angles have the same area, which is taken to be the magnitude of the angle. This magnitude is <math>\\operatorname{ln}{(bc)}=\\operatorname{ln}(c/a) =\\operatorname{ln}c-\\operatorname{ln}a</math>.\n\n==Comparison with circular angle==\n[[Image:Hyperbolic functions-2.svg|thumb|200px|right|The unit hyperbola has a sector with an area half of the hyperbolic angle]]\n\n[[File:HyperbolicAnimation.gif|thumb|right|Circular vs. hyperbolic angle]]\n\nA [[unit circle]] <math> x^2 + y^2 = 1 </math> has a [[circular sector]] with an area half of the circular angle in radians. Analogously, a [[unit hyperbola]] <math> x^2 - y^2 = 1 </math> has a [[hyperbolic sector]] with an area half of the hyperbolic angle.\n\nThere is also a projective resolution between circular and hyperbolic cases: both curves are [[conic section]]s, and hence are treated as [[projective range]]s in [[projective geometry]]. Given an origin point on one of these ranges, other points correspond to angles. The idea of addition of angles, basic to science, corresponds to addition of points on one of these ranges as follows:\n\nCircular angles can be characterised geometrically by the property that if two [[chord (geometry)|chord]]s ''P''<sub>0</sub>''P''<sub>1</sub> and ''P''<sub>0</sub>''P''<sub>2</sub> subtend angles ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub> at the centre of a circle, their sum {{nowrap|''L''<sub>1</sub> + ''L''<sub>2</sub>}} is the angle subtended by a chord ''PQ'', where ''PQ'' is required to be parallel to ''P''<sub>1</sub>''P''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe same construction can also be applied to the hyperbola.  If ''P''<sub>0</sub> is taken to be the point {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}, ''P''<sub>1</sub> the point {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, 1/''x''<sub>1</sub>)}}, and ''P''<sub>2</sub> the point {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, 1/''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}, then the parallel condition requires that ''Q'' be the point {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>, 1/''x''<sub>1</sub>1/''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}.  It thus makes sense to define the hyperbolic angle from ''P''<sub>0</sub> to an arbitrary point on the curve as a logarithmic function of the point's value of ''x''.<ref>Bjørn Felsager, [http://www.dynamicgeometry.com/Documents/advancedSketchGallery/minkowski/Minkowski_Overview.pdf Through the Looking Glass – A glimpse of Euclid's twin geometry, the Minkowski geometry], ICME-10 Copenhagen 2004; p.14.

Arcs with an angular magnitude on a circle generate a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on certain [[measurable set]]s on the circle whose magnitude does not vary as the circle turns or [[rotation|rotates]]. For the hyperbola the turning is by [[squeeze mapping]], and the hyperbolic angle magnitudes stay the same when the plane is squeezed by a mapping\n:(''x'', ''y'') ↦ (''rx'', ''y'' / ''r''), with ''r'' > 0 .\n\n==History==\nThe [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] of the [[hyperbola]] is the evaluation of the area of a [[hyperbolic sector]]. It can be shown to be equal to the corresponding area against an [[asymptote]]. The quadrature was first accomplished by [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] in 1647 in his momentous ''Opus geometricum quadrature circuli et sectionum coni''. As expressed by a historian,\n: [He made the] quadrature of a hyperbola to its [[asymptote]]s, and showed that as the [[area]] increased in [[arithmetic series]] the [[abscissa]]s increased in [[geometric series]].<ref>[[David Eugene Smith]] (1925) ''History of Mathematics'', pp. 424,5  v. 1</ref>\n\n[[A. A. de Sarasa]] interpreted the quadrature as a [[logarithm]] and thus the geometrically defined [[natural logarithm]] (or \"hyperbolic logarithm\") is understood as the area under {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 1/''x''}} to the right of {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 1}}.  As an example of a [[transcendental function]], the logarithm is more familiar than its motivator, the hyperbolic angle. Nevertheless, the hyperbolic angle plays a role when the [[Squeeze mapping#Bridge to transcendentals|theorem of Saint-Vincent]] is advanced with [[squeeze mapping]].\n\nCircular [[trigonometry]] was extended to the hyperbola by [[Augustus De Morgan]] in his [[textbook]] ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra''.<ref>[[Augustus De Morgan]] (1849) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7UwEAAAAQAAJ Trigonometry and Double Algebra], Chapter VI: \"On the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry\"</ref> In 1878 [[William Kingdon Clifford|W.K. Clifford]] used the hyperbolic angle to [[parametric equation|parametrize]] a [[unit hyperbola]], describing it as \"quasi-[[harmonic oscillator|harmonic motion]]\".\n\nIn 1894 [[Alexander Macfarlane]] circulated his essay \"The Imaginary of Algebra\", which used hyperbolic angles to generate [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versors]], in his book ''Papers on Space Analysis''.<ref>[[Alexander Macfarlane]](1894) [https://archive.org/details/principlesalgeb01macfgoog ''Papers on Space Analysis''], B.

He wrote:\n\n:It seems worth mentioning that to ''unit'' rapidity corresponds a huge velocity, amounting to 3/4 of the velocity of light; more accurately we have {{nowrap|1=''v'' = (.7616)''c''}} for {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}}.\n:[...] the rapidity {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}}, [...] consequently will represent the velocity .76&nbsp;''c'' which is a little above the velocity of light in water.\n\nSilberstein also uses [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]'s concept of [[angle of parallelism]] Π(''a'') to obtain {{nowrap|1=cos Π(''a'') = ''v''/''c''}}.<ref>[[Ludwik Silberstein]] (1914) [[List of important publications in physics#The Theory of Relativity|Theory of Relativity]], Cambridge University Press, pp.&nbsp;180–1</ref>\n\n==Imaginary circular angle==\nThe hyperbolic angle is often presented as if it were an [[imaginary number]]. Thus, if ''x'' is a real number and {{nowrap|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = −1}}, then\n:<math> \\cos(i x) = \\cosh(x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad  \\sin(i x) = i \\sinh(x)</math>\nso that the [[hyperbolic function]]s cosh and sinh can be presented through the circular functions. But these identities do not arise from a circle or rotation, rather they can be understood in terms of [[infinite series]]. In particular, the one expressing the [[exponential function]] (<math> e^x = \\cosh x + \\sinh x\\! </math> ) consists of even and odd terms, the former comprise the cosh function (<math>\\textstyle\\cosh x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}</math>), the latter the sinh function (<math>\\textstyle\\sinh x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}</math>). The infinite series for cosine is derived from cosh by turning it into an [[alternating series]], and the series for sine comes from making sinh into an alternating series. The above identities use the number ''i'' to remove the alternating factor (−1)<sup>''n''</sup> from terms of the series to restore the full halves of the exponential series. Nevertheless, in the theory of [[holomorphic function]]s, the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions are incorporated into the [[complex number|complex]] sine and cosine functions.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transcendent angle]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{wikibooks|Calculus|Hyperbolic angle|Hyperbolic angle}}\n* [[Janet Barnett|Janet Heine Barnett]] (2004) \"Enter, stage center: the early drama of the hyperbolic functions\", available in (a) [[Mathematics Magazine]] 77(1):15–30 or (b) chapter 7 of ''Euler at 300'', RE Bradley, LA D'Antonio, CE Sandifer editors, [[Mathematical Association of America]] {{ISBN|0-88385-565-8}} .\n* [[Arthur Kennelly]] (1912) [https://archive.org/details/applicationofhyp00kennrich Application of hyperbolic functions to electrical engineering problems]\n* William Mueller, ''Exploring Precalculus'', § The Number e, [http://www.wmueller.com/precalculus/e/e5.html Hyperbolic Trigonometry].\n* [[John Stillwell]] (1998) ''Numbers and Geometry'' exercise 9.5.3, p.&nbsp;298, Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|0-387-98289-2}}.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hyperbolic Angle}}\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Differential calculus]]\n[[Category:Integral calculus]]"

Two events will be simultaneous when they are on a line hyperbolically orthogonal to a particular time line. This dependence on a certain time line is determined by velocity, and is the basis for the [[relativity of simultaneity]].\n==Geometry==\nTwo lines are '''hyperbolic orthogonal''' when they are [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] of each other over the asymptote of a given [[hyperbola]].\nTwo particular hyperbolas are frequently used in the plane:\n:(A) ''xy'' = 1  with ''y'' = 0 as asymptote.\n:When reflected in the x-axis, a line ''y = mx'' becomes ''y'' = &minus;''mx''.\n:In this case the lines are hyperbolic orthogonal if their [[slope]]s are [[additive inverse]]s.\n\n:(B) ''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 1  with ''y'' = ''x'' as asymptote.\n:For lines ''y'' = ''mx'' with &minus;1 < ''m'' < 1, when ''x'' = 1/''m'', then ''y'' = 1.\n:The point (1/''m'' , 1) on the line is reflected across ''y'' = ''x'' to (1, 1/''m'').\n:Therefore the reflected line has slope 1/m and the slopes of hyperbolic orthogonal lines are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of each other.\n\nThe relation of hyperbolic orthogonality actually applies to classes of parallel lines in the plane, where any particular line can represent the class. Thus, for a given hyperbola and asymptote ''A'', a pair of lines (''a,b'') are hyperbolic orthogonal if there is a pair (''c,d'') such that <math>a \\rVert c ,\\  b \\rVert d </math>, and ''c'' is the reflection of ''d'' across ''A''.\n\nSimilar to the perpendularity of a circle radius to the [[tangent]], a radius to a hyperbola is hyperbolic orthogonal to a tangent to the hyperbola.<ref name=L&W/><ref>Bjørn Felsager (2004), [http://www.dynamicgeometry.com/Documents/advancedSketchGallery/minkowski/Minkowski_Overview.pdf Through the Looking Glass - A glimpse of Euclid’s twin geometry, the Minkowski geometry], ICME-10 Copenhagen; pages 6 & 7.</ref>\n\nA [[bilinear form]] is used to describe orthogonality in analytic geometry, with two elements orthogonal when their bilinear form vanishes.

When ''a'' = ''b'' the ellipse is a circle and the conjugate diameters are perpendicular while the hyperbola is rectangular and the conjugate diameters are hyperbolic-orthogonal.\n\nIn the terminology of [[projective geometry]], the operation of taking the hyperbolic orthogonal line is a [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]. Suppose the slope of a vertical line is denoted ∞ so that all lines have a slope in the [[projectively extended real line]]. Then whichever hyperbola (A) or (B) is used, the operation is an example of a [[involution (mathematics)#Projective geometry|hyperbolic involution]] where the asymptote is invariant. Hyperbolically orthogonal lines lie in different sectors of the plane, determined by the asymptotes of the hyperbola, thus the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality is a [[heterogeneous relation]] on sets of lines in the plane.\n\n==Simultaneity==\nSince [[Hermann Minkowski]]'s foundation for [[spacetime]] study in 1908, the concept of points in a spacetime plane being hyperbolic-orthogonal to a timeline (tangent to a [[world line]]) has been used to define '''simultaneity''' of events relative to the timeline. In Minkowski's development the hyperbola of type (B) above is in use.<ref>{{Citation|author=Minkowski, Hermann|year=1909|title=[[s:de:Raum und Zeit (Minkowski)|Raum und Zeit]]|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|volume=10|pages=75–88}}\n:*Various English translations on Wikisource: [[s:Space and Time|Space and Time]]</ref> Two vectors <math>x, y, z, t \\quad \\text {and}\\quad  x_1, y_1, z_ 1, t_1</math> are ''normal'' (meaning hyperbolic orthogonal) when\n:<math>c^{2} t \\ t_1 - x \\ x_1 - y \\ y_1 - z \\ z_1 = 0.</math>\nWhen ''c'' = 1 and the y's and z's are zero, x &ne; 0, t<sub>1</sub> &ne; 0, then <math>\\frac t x = \\frac{x_1} {t_1}</math>.\n\nGiven a hyperbola with asymptote ''A'', its reflection in ''A'' produces the ''conjugate hyperbola''.

Thus, the angle ''θ'' does not change as its vertex is moved around on the circle.]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], an '''inscribed angle''' is the [[angle]] formed in the interior of a [[circle]] when two [[secant line]]s (or, in a [[degenerate case]], when one [[secant line]] and one [[tangent line]] of that circle) intersect on the circle. It can also be defined as the angle subtended at a point on the circle by two given points on the circle.\n\nEquivalently, an inscribed angle is defined by two [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] of the circle sharing an endpoint.\n\nThe '''inscribed angle theorem''' relates the [[Angle#Measuring angles|measure]] of an inscribed angle to that of the [[central angle]] subtending the same [[circular arc|arc]].\n\n==Theorem==\n\n===Statement===\n\n[[File:ArcCapable.gif|thumb|For fixed points ''A'' and ''B'', the set of points ''M'' in the plane for which the angle ''AMB'' is equal to&nbsp;''&alpha;'' is an arc of a circle.

Therefore, the angle does not change as its [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] is moved to different positions on the circle.\n\n===Proof===\n\n====Inscribed angles where one chord is a diameter====\n[[File:InscribedAngle 1ChordDiam.svg|thumb|Case: One chord is a diameter]]\nLet ''O'' be the center of a circle, as in the diagram at right.  Choose two points on the circle, and call them ''V'' and ''A''.  Draw line ''VO'' and extended past ''O'' so that it intersects the circle at point ''B'' which is [[diametrically opposite]] the point ''V''. Draw an angle whose [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] is point ''V'' and whose sides pass through points ''A'' and ''B''.\n\nDraw line ''OA''.  Angle ''BOA'' is a [[central angle]]; call it ''θ''.  Lines ''OV'' and ''OA'' are both [[radius|radii]] of the circle, so they have equal lengths.  Therefore, triangle ''VOA'' is [[isosceles]], so angle ''BVA'' (the inscribed angle) and angle ''VAO'' are equal; let each of them be denoted as ''ψ''.\n\nAngles ''BOA'' and ''AOV'' are [[supplementary angle|supplementary]].  They add up to 180°, since line ''VB'' passing through ''O'' is a straight line.  Therefore, angle ''AOV'' measures 180°&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''θ''.\n\nIt is known that the three angles of a [[triangle]] add up to 180°, and the three angles of triangle ''VOA'' are:\n\n: 180° &minus; ''θ''\n: ''ψ''\n: ''ψ''.\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math> 2 \\psi + 180^\\circ - \\theta = 180^\\circ. </math>\n\nSubtract 180° from both sides,\n\n:<math> 2 \\psi = \\theta, </math>\n\nwhere ''θ'' is the central angle subtending arc ''AB'' and ''ψ'' is the inscribed angle subtending arc ''AB''.\n\n====Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their interior====\n[[File:InscribedAngle CenterCircle.svg|thumb|Case: Center interior to angle]]\nGiven a circle whose center is point ''O'', choose three points ''V'', ''C'', and ''D'' on the circle.  Draw lines ''VC'' and ''VD'': angle ''DVC'' is an inscribed angle.  Now draw line ''VO'' and extend it past point ''O'' so that it intersects the circle at point ''E''.  Angle ''DVC'' subtends arc ''DC'' on the circle.\n\nSuppose this arc includes point ''E'' within it.  Point ''E'' is diametrically opposite to point ''V''.  Angles ''DVE'' and ''EVC'' are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them.\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math> \\angle DVC = \\angle DVE + \\angle EVC. </math>\n\nthen let\n\n:<math> \\psi_0 = \\angle DVC, </math>\n:<math> \\psi_1 = \\angle DVE, </math>\n:<math> \\psi_2 = \\angle EVC, </math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math> \\psi_0 = \\psi_1 + \\psi_2. \\qquad \\qquad (1) </math>\n\nDraw lines ''OC'' and ''OD''.  Angle ''DOC'' is a central angle, but so are angles ''DOE'' and ''EOC'', and\n:<math> \\angle DOC = \\angle DOE + \\angle EOC. </math>\n\nLet\n\n:<math> \\theta_0 = \\angle DOC, </math>\n:<math> \\theta_1 = \\angle DOE, </math>\n:<math> \\theta_2 = \\angle EOC, </math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math> \\theta_0 = \\theta_1 + \\theta_2. \\qquad \\qquad (2) </math>\n\nFrom Part One we know that <math> \\theta_1 = 2 \\psi_1 </math> and that <math> \\theta_2 = 2 \\psi_2 </math>.

Draw lines ''VC'' and ''VD'': angle ''DVC'' is an inscribed angle.  Now draw line ''VO'' and extend it past point ''O'' so that it intersects the circle at point ''E''.  Angle ''DVC'' subtends arc ''DC'' on the circle.\n\nSuppose this arc does not include point ''E'' within it.  Point ''E'' is diametrically opposite to point ''V''.  Angles ''EVD'' and ''EVC'' are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them.\n\nTherefore,\n:<math> \\angle DVC = \\angle EVC - \\angle EVD </math>.\nthen let\n:<math> \\psi_0 = \\angle DVC, </math>\n:<math> \\psi_1 = \\angle EVD, </math>\n:<math> \\psi_2 = \\angle EVC, </math>\nso that\n:<math> \\psi_0 = \\psi_2 - \\psi_1. \\qquad \\qquad (3) </math>\n\nDraw lines ''OC'' and ''OD''.  Angle ''DOC'' is a central angle, but so are angles ''EOD'' and ''EOC'', and\n:<math> \\angle DOC = \\angle EOC - \\angle EOD. </math>\nLet\n:<math> \\theta_0 = \\angle DOC, </math>\n:<math> \\theta_1 = \\angle EOD, </math>\n:<math> \\theta_2 = \\angle EOC, </math>\nso that\n:<math> \\theta_0 = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1. \\qquad \\qquad (4) </math>\n\nFrom Part One we know that <math> \\theta_1 = 2 \\psi_1 </math> and that <math> \\theta_2 = 2 \\psi_2 </math>.  Combining these results with equation (4) yields\n:<math> \\theta_0 = 2 \\psi_2 - 2 \\psi_1 </math>\ntherefore, by equation (3),\n:<math> \\theta_0 = 2 \\psi_0. </math>\n\n===Corollary===\nBy a similar argument, the angle between a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] and the [[tangent]] line at one of its intersection points equals half of the central angle subtended by the chord.  See also [[Tangent lines to circles]].\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe inscribed angle [[theorem]] is used in many proofs of elementary [[Euclidean geometry of the plane]].  A special case of the theorem is [[Thales' theorem]], which states that the angle subtended by a [[diameter]] is always 90°, i.e., a right angle.  As a consequence of the theorem, opposite angles of [[cyclic quadrilateral]]s sum to 180°; conversely, any quadrilateral for which this is true can be inscribed in a circle.  As another example, the inscribed angle theorem is the basis for several theorems related to the [[power of a point]] with respect to a circle. Further, it allows one to prove that when two chords intersect in a circle, the products of the lengths of their pieces are equal.\n\n== Inscribed angle theorems for ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas ==\nInscribed angle theorems exist for  ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas, too.

N<sub>g</sub> is geographic or true north, N<sub>m</sub> is magnetic north, and δ is magnetic declination]]\n\n'''Magnetic declination''', or '''magnetic variation''', is the [[azimuth|angle]] on the [[horizontal plane]] between [[Magnetic North Pole|magnetic north]] (the direction the north end of a magnetized [[compass]] needle points, corresponding to the direction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] lines) and [[true north]] (the [[cardinal direction|direction]] along a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] towards the geographic [[North Pole]]). This angle varies depending on position on the Earth's surface and [[polar wandering|changes over time]].\n\nSomewhat more formally, [[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator|Bowditch]] defines variation as “the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. The angle between magnetic and grid meridians is called grid magnetic angle, grid variation, or grivation.”<ref>{{cite book |last=Bowditch |first=Nathaniel |title=American Practical Navigator|year=2002 |publisher=Paradise Cay Publications |isbn=9780939837540 |page=849}}</ref>\n\nBy convention, declination is positive when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative when it is to the west. ''[[Isogon]]ic lines'' are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called ''agonic lines''. The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.\n\nThe term ''[[magnetic deviation]]'' is sometimes used loosely to mean the same as magnetic declination, but more correctly it refers to the error in a compass reading induced by nearby metallic objects, such as iron on board a ship or aircraft.\n\nMagnetic declination should not be confused with ''[[magnetic inclination]]'', also known as magnetic dip, which is the angle that the Earth's magnetic field lines make with the downward side of the horizontal plane.\n\n== Declination change over time and location ==\nMagnetic declination varies both from place to place and with the passage of time. As a traveller cruises the east coast of the United States, for example, the declination varies from 16 degrees west in Maine, to 6 in Florida, to 0 degrees in Louisiana, to 4 degrees east (in Texas). The declination at London, UK was one degree 7 minutes west (2014), reducing to  5' as of early 2019, and as the country is quite small that figure is fairly good for the whole. It is reducing, and scientists predict that in about 2050 it will be zero.<ref>{{cite web|title=Find the magnetic declination at your location|url=http://www.magnetic-declination.com/ |publisher=Magnetic-Declination.com |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn most areas, the spatial variation reflects the irregularities of the flows deep in the Earth; in some areas, deposits of [[iron]] [[ore]] or [[magnetite]] in the Earth's crust may contribute strongly to the declination. Similarly, [[secular phenomena|secular]] changes to these flows result in slow changes to the field strength and direction at the same point on the Earth.\n\n{|\n|- valign = top\n|[[Image:World Magnetic Declination 2015.pdf|thumb|350px|Level curves drawn on a declination map to denote the magnetic declination, described by signed degrees.

For a location closer to the pole like [[Ivujivik]], the declination may change by 1&nbsp;degree every three years. This may be insignificant to most travellers, but can be important if using magnetic bearings from old charts or [[metes and bounds|metes]] (directions) in old deeds for locating places with any precision.\n\nAs an example of how variation changes over time, see the two charts of the same area (western end of [[Long Island Sound]]), below, surveyed 124 years apart.  The 1884 chart shows a variation of 8 degrees, 20 minutes West.  The 2008 chart shows 13 degrees, 15 minutes West.\n\n{|\n|- valign = top\n|[[File:USCGS Chart number 361 (1884).jpg|thumb|150px|Western Long Island Sound, 1884]]\n|[[File:NOAA Chart 12366 (2008).jpg|thumb|200px|Western Long Island Sound, 2008]]\n|[[Image:Earth Magnetic Field Declination from 1590 to 1990.gif|right|Estimated declination contours by year, 1590 to 1990]]\n|}\n\n== Determining declination ==\n[[Image:IsraelCVFRmag.jpg|thumb|130px|Magnetic declination indicated on an Israeli map. The arrows show true north, grid north and magnetic north, and the caption explains that the average yearly change in the magnetic declination is 0°03′ eastward.]]\n\n=== Direct measurement ===\n[[Image:Deklinationsnadel hg.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antique declinometer]]\nThe magnetic declination at any particular place can be measured directly by reference to the [[celestial pole]]s—the points in the heavens around which the stars appear to revolve, which mark the direction of true north and true south. The [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] used to perform this measurement is known as a ''declinometer''.\n\nThe approximate position of the north celestial pole is indicated by [[Polaris]] (the North Star). In the northern hemisphere, declination can therefore be approximately determined as the difference between the magnetic bearing and a visual bearing on Polaris.  Polaris currently traces a circle 0.73° in radius around the north celestial pole, so this technique is accurate to within a degree.  At high latitudes a [[plumb-bob]] is helpful to sight Polaris against a reference object close to the horizon, from which its bearing can be taken.<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthsci.org/education/fieldsk/declin.htm|title=Magnetic declination, what it is , how to compensate.}}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Determination from maps and models ===\nA rough estimate of the local declination (within a few degrees) can be determined from a general isogonic chart of the world or a continent, such as those illustrated above. Isogonic lines are also shown on [[aeronautical chart|aeronautic]]al and [[nautical chart]]s.\n\nLarger-scale local maps may indicate current local declination, often with the aid of a schematic diagram. Unless the area depicted is very small, declination may vary measurably over the extent of the map, so the data may be referred to a specific location on the map. The current rate and direction of change may also be shown, for example in [[arcminute]]s per year. The same diagram may show the angle of [[grid north]] (the direction of the map's north-south grid lines), which may differ from true north.\n\nOn the [[topographic map]]s of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS), for example, a diagram shows the relationship between magnetic north in the area concerned (with an arrow marked \"MN\") and true north (a vertical line with a five-pointed star at its top), with a label near the angle between the MN arrow and the vertical line, stating the size of the declination and of that angle, in degrees, [[angular mil|mil]]s, or both.\n\nA prediction of the current magnetic declination for a given location (based on a worldwide [[empirical model]] of the deep flows described above) can be obtained online from a web page operated by the [[National Geophysical Data Center]], a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|work=Geomagnetism |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination |title=Estimated Value of Magnetic Declination |publisher=NOAA National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> This model is built with all the information available to the map-makers at the start of the five-year period it is prepared for. It reflects a highly predictable rate of change,{{clarify | reason = Is this trying to say that changes in declination *are* highly predictable, or just that the model assumes this?|date=February 2014}} and is usually more accurate than a map—which is likely months or years out of date—and almost never less accurate.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Software===\nThe [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) provides source code written in C that is based on the [[World Magnetic Model]] (WMM). The source code is free to download and includes a data file updated every five years to account for movement of the magnetic north pole.\n\n== Using the declination ==\n\n=== Adjustable compasses ===\n[[Image:Boussole.jpg|thumb|left|x300px|Adjustable compass set to a declination of 0° and a bearing of 307°]]\nA magnetic compass points to magnetic north, not geographic north.  Compasses of the style commonly used for hiking include a declination adjustment in the form of a  [[bezel setting|bezel]] which swivels relative to the base plate. To establish a declination the bezel is rotated until the desired number of degrees plus or minus lie between the bezel's designation N (for North) and the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the needle (usually painted red). This allows the user to establish a true bearing for travel or orientation by aligning the embossed red indicator arrow on the base plate with a landmark or heading on a map. A compass thus adjusted can be said to be reading “true north” instead of magnetic north (as long as it remains within an area on the same isogonic line).\n\nIn the image above the bezel's N has been aligned with the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the compass needle, reflecting a magnetic declination of 0 degrees.  The arrow on the base plate indicates a bearing of 307 degrees. \n{{-}}\n\n=== Non-adjustable compasses ===\n[[Image:Compensating magnetic declination.svg|300px|thumb|left|How to compensate for magnetic declination when reading a compass. In this example, the declination is 14°E (+14°), so the compass card points to a \"north\" 14 degrees to the East of true North. To obtain a true bearing, add 14 degrees to the bearing shown by the compass.]]\nTo work with both true and magnetic bearings, the user of a non-adjustable compass needs to make simple calculations that take into account the local magnetic declination.  The example on the left shows how you would convert a magnetic bearing (one taken in the field using a non-adjustable compass) to a true bearing (one that you could plot on a map) by ''adding'' the magnetic declination.  The declination in the example is 14°E (+14°).  If, instead, the declination was 14°W (−14°), you would still “add” it to the magnetic bearing to obtain the true bearing:  40°+ (−14°) = 26°.\n\nThe opposite procedure is used in converting a true bearing to a magnetic bearing.  With a local declination of 14°E, a true bearing (perhaps taken from a map) of 54° is converted to a magnetic bearing (for use in the field) by ''subtracting'' the declination:  54° – 14° = 40°.  If, instead, the declination was 14°W (−14°), you would still “subtract” it from the true bearing to obtain the magnetic bearing:  54°- (−14°) = 68°.\n{{-}}\n\n== Navigation ==\nOn aircraft or vessels there are three types of [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]]: true, magnetic, and compass bearing. Compass error is divided into two parts, namely magnetic variation and [[magnetic deviation]], the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.\n\nCompass, magnetic and true bearings are related by:\n\n<math display=block>T = M - V</math>\n\n<math display=block>M = C - D</math>\n\nThe general equation relating compass and true bearings is\n\n<math display=block>C = T + V + D</math>\n\nWhere:\n\n* <math>C</math> is Compass bearing\n* <math>M</math> is Magnetic bearing\n* <math>T</math> is True bearing\n* <math>V</math> is Variation\n* <math>D</math> is compass Deviation\n* <math>V<0, D<0</math> for Westerly Variation and Deviation\n* <math>V>0, D>0</math> for Easterly Variation and Deviation\nFor example, if the compass reads 32°, the local magnetic variation is −5.5° (i.e. West) and the deviation is 0°, the true bearing will be:\n\n<math display=block>T = 32^\\circ - (-5.5^\\circ) - 0^\\circ = 37.5^\\circ</math>\n\nTo calculate true bearing from compass bearing (and known deviation and variation):\n\n*Compass bearing – deviation = magnetic bearing\n*Magnetic bearing – variation = true bearing\n\nTo calculate compass bearing from true bearing (and known deviation and variation):\n\n*True bearing + variation = Magnetic bearing \n*Magnetic bearing + deviation = Compass bearing\n\nThese rules are often combined with the mnemonic \"West is Best, East is least\"; that is to say, add W declinations when going True headings to Magnetic Compass, and subtract E ones.\n\nAnother simple way to remember which way to apply the correction for Continental USA is:\n* For locations east of the agonic line (zero declination), roughly east of the Mississippi: The magnetic bearing is always bigger.\n* For locations west of the agonic line (zero declination), roughly west of the Mississippi: The magnetic bearing is always smaller.\n\nCommon abbreviations are:\n*TC = true course;\n*V  = variation (of the Earth's magnetic field);\n*MC = magnetic course (what the course would be in the absence of local declination);\n*D  = deviation caused by magnetic material (mostly iron and steel) on the vessel;\n*CC = compass course.\n\n===Deviation===\n[[Magnetic deviation]] is the angle from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing mark of the compass. Deviation is positive if a compass bearing mark (e.g., compass north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°.  Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on the orientation of the boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to compass bearing to obtain magnetic bearing.\n\n===Air navigation===\nMagnetic declination has a very important influence on [[air navigation]], since the most simple aircraft navigation instruments are designed to determine headings by locating magnetic north through the use of a compass or similar magnetic device.\n\nAviation sectionals (maps / charts) and databases used for air navigation are based on true north rather than magnetic north, and the constant and significant slight changes in the actual location of magnetic north and local irregularities in the planet's magnetic field require that charts and databases be updated at least twice each year to reflect the current magnetic variation correction from true north.{{clarify | reason = Why would charts based on true north need to be updated to reflect changes in magnetic variation?|date=February 2014}}\n\nFor example, as of March 2010, near San Francisco, magnetic north is about 14.3 degrees east of true north, with the difference decreasing by about 6 minutes of arc per year.<ref>[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomagmodels/struts/calcDeclination According to NOAA Geophysical Data Center on-line model]</ref>\n\nWhen plotting a course, most small aircraft pilots plot a trip using true north on a sectional (map), then convert the true north bearings to magnetic north for in-plane navigation using the magnetic compass. During flight, the pilot derives the correct compass course by adding or subtracting the local variation displayed on a sectional.\n\nRadionavigation aids located on the ground, such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]s, are also checked and updated to keep them aligned with magnetic north to allow pilots to use their magnetic compasses for accurate and reliable in-plane navigation.\n\n[[Runway]]s are designated by a number between 01 and 36, which is generally one tenth of the magnetic [[azimuth]] of the runway's [[Course (navigation)|heading]]: a runway numbered 09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west (270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°).<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/Chap2/aim0203.html Federal Aviation Administration Aeronautical Information Manual, Chapter 2, Section 3 Airport Marking Aids and Signs part 3b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118165015/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap2/aim0203.html |date=2012-01-18 }}</ref> However, due to magnetic declination, changes in runway designators have to occur at times to keep their designation in line with the runway's magnetic heading. An exception is made for runways within the [[Northern Domestic Airspace]] of Canada; these are numbered relative to true north because proximity to the magnetic North Pole makes the magnetic declination large.\n\n[[GPS]] systems used for air navigation can use magnetic north or true north. In order to make them more compatible with systems that depend on magnetic north, magnetic north is often chosen, at the pilot's preference. The GPS receiver natively reads in true north, but can elegantly calculate magnetic north based on its true position and data tables; the unit can then calculate the current location and direction of the north magnetic pole and (potentially) any local variations, if the GPS is set to use magnetic compass readings.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n*{{Portal-inline|Nautical}}\n*{{books-inline|Geomagnetism}}\n* [[Compass survey]]\n* [[Geomagnetism]]\n* [[L-shell]]\n* [[Magnetic inclination]]\n* [[Pole star]]\n* [[Shen Kuo]]\n* [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://geomag.usgs.gov USGS Geomagnetism Program]\n* [http://www.magnetic-declination.com Looks up your IP address location and tells you your declination.]\n* [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination Online declination calculator at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)]\n* [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#igrfwmm Online declination and field strength calculator at the NGDC]\n* [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/calculators/mobileDeclination Mobile web-app for magnetic declination at the NGDC]\n* [http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/ Historical magnetic declination viewer at the NGDC]\n* [http://geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/apps/mdcal-eng.php Magnetic declination calculator at Natural Resources Canada]\n* [http://geomag.org/models/WMM/WMMGSpreadsheet.htm A Google spreadsheet application to bulk calculate magnetic declination]\n* [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml World Magnetic Model source code download site]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magnetic Declination}}\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]\n[[Category:Geomagnetism]]\n[[Category:Angle]]"

(More loosely, \"magnetic deviation\" is used by some to mean the same as \"magnetic declination\". This article is about the former meaning.)\n\n==Compass readings==\nCompasses are used to determine the direction of [[true North]]. However, the compass reading must be corrected for two effects. The first is [[magnetic declination]] or variation—the angular difference between ''magnetic North'' (the local direction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]]) and true North.<ref>Admiralty Manual of Navigation Vol 1 1964 p12</ref> The second is ''magnetic deviation''—the angular difference between magnetic North and the compass needle due to nearby sources of interference such as magnetically permeable bodies, or other magnetic fields within the field of influence.<ref name=Doerfler1>{{cite web|url=http://myreckonings.com/wordpress/2009/04/18/magnetic-deviation-comprehension-compensation-and-computation-part-i/ |title=Magnetic Deviation: Comprehension, Compensation and Computation (Part I) |first=Ron |last=Doerfler |work=Dead reckonings: Lost art in the mathematical sciences |date=April 18, 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Magnetic anomalies===\nThe Earth's magnetic field is modified by local [[magnetic anomalies]]. These include variations of the magnetization in the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] caused by [[geomagnetic reversals]] as well as nearby mountains and [[iron ore]] deposits. Generally, these are indicated on maps as part of the declination. Because the Earth's field [[Geomagnetic secular variation|changes over time]], the maps must be kept up to date for accurate navigation. Short term errors in compass readings are also caused by fields generated in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], particularly during [[geomagnetic storms]].\n\n===Internal sources===\nIn navigation manuals, ''magnetic deviation'' often refers specifically to compass error caused by magnetized iron within a ship or aircraft.<ref name=Dodds>{{cite book|last=Dodds|first=Don|title=Modern seamanship : a comprehensive ready-reference guide for all recreational boaters|year=2001|publisher=The Lyons Press|location=Guilford, Conn.|isbn=9781585745289}}</ref> This iron has a mixture of [[Remanence|permanent magnetization]] and an ''induced'' (temporary) magnetization that is induced by the Earth's magnetic field. Because the latter depends on the orientation of the craft relative to the Earth's field, it can be difficult to analyze and correct for it.\n\nThe deviation errors caused by magnetism in the ship's structure are minimised by precisely positioning small magnets and iron compensators close to the compass. To compensate for the induced magnetization, two magnetically soft iron spheres are placed on side arms. However, because the magnetic \"signature\" of every ship changes slowly with location, and with time, it is necessary to adjust the compensating magnets, periodically, to keep the deviation errors to a practical minimum.<ref name=NGIA>{{cite web |url=https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/NauticalHydrographicBathymetricProduct/Documents/HoMCA.pdf |title=Handbook of magnetic compass adjustment |author=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |year=2004 |accessdate=10 March 2012 |ref={{harvid|NGIA}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025153818/https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/NauticalHydrographicBathymetricProduct/Documents/HoMCA.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2011 |df= }}</ref> Magnetic compass adjustment and correction is one of the subjects in the examination curriculum for a shipmaster's certificate of competency.\n\nThe sources of magnetic deviation vary from compass to compass or vehicle to vehicle. However, they are independent of location, and thus the compass can be calibrated to accommodate them.\n\nNon-magnetic methods of taking bearings, such as with [[gyrocompass]], [[Astronomy|astronomical observation]]s, satellites (as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) or [[radio navigation]], are not subject to magnetic deviation. Thus, a comparison of bearings taken with such methods with the bearing given by a compass can be used to compute local magnetic deviation.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:PSM V34 D323 The compensating binnacle.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of a 19th-century [[binnacle]] housing a compass. It has two soft iron spheres (Q) to correct for induced magnetization.]]\nSailing ships generally had two kinds of compasses: ''steering compasses'', two of which would be mounted in a [[binnacle]] in front of the helm for use in maintaining a course; and a ''bearing compass'' that was used for taking the bearings of celestial objects, landmarks and the ship's wake. The latter could be moved around the ship, and it was soon observed that the bearing could vary from one part of the ship to another. The explorer [[Joao de Castro]] was the first to report such an inconsistency, in 1538, and attributed it to the ship's gun. Many other objects were found to be sources of deviation in ships, including iron particles in brass compass bowls; iron nails in a wooden compass box or binnacle; and metal parts of clothing. The two steering compasses themselves could interfere with each other if they were set too close together.<ref name=Jonkers168>* {{cite book|last=Jonkers|first=A.R.T.|title=The Earth's magnetism in the age of sail|year=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801871328|ref=harv |pages=168&ndash;169}}</ref> The \"bearing compass\" was eventually sited in a fixed position in a binicale with, as far as possible, an all round view and acquired the name \"standard compass\" It would nonetheless have a different deviation to the \"steering compass\" so the compass heading shown on the \"steering compass\" would be different to the compass heading shown on the \"standard compass\".\n\nThe source of deviation could not always be identified. To reduce this source of error, which was due to induced magnetization in the ship, the surveyor John Churchman proposed a solution known as ''swinging the ship'' in 1794. This involved measuring the magnetic deviation as the ship was oriented in several compass directions. These measurements could then be used to correct compass readings. This procedure became standard practice in the 19th century as iron became an increasing component of ships.<ref name=Jonkers168/>\n\n==Compass Deviation==\n\nCompass Deviation is caused by local magnetic effects.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceived_visual_angle",
      "text": "In human [[visual perception]], the [[visual angle]], denoted ''θ'', [[subtended angle|subtended]] by a viewed object sometimes looks larger or smaller than its actual value. One approach to this phenomenon posits a subjective correlate to the visual angle: the '''perceived visual angle''' or '''perceived angular size'''. An [[optical illusion]] where the physical and subjective angles differ is then called a '''visual angle illusion''' or '''angular size illusion'''.\n\nAngular size illusions are most obvious as relative angular size illusions, in which two objects that subtend the same visual angle appear to have different angular sizes; it is as if their equal-sized images on the [[retina]] were of different sizes. Angular size illusions are contrasted with linear size illusions, in which two objects that are the same physical size do not appear so. An angular size illusion may be accompanied by (or cause) a linear size illusion at the same time.\n\nThe perceived visual angle [[paradigm]] begins with a rejection of the classical [[size–distance invariance hypothesis]] (SDIH), which states that the ratio of perceived linear size to perceived distance is a simple function of the visual angle. The SDIH does not explain some illusions, such as the [[Moon illusion]], in which the Moon appears larger when it is near the horizon. It is replaced by a perceptual SDIH, in which the visual angle is replaced by the perceived visual angle. This new formulation avoids some of the paradoxes of the SDIH, but it remains difficult to explain why a given illusion occurs.\n\nThis paradigm is not universally accepted; many textbook explanations of size and distance perception do not refer to the perceived visual angle, and some researchers deny that it exists. Some recent evidence supporting the idea, reported by Murray, Boyaci and Kersten (2006), suggests a direct relationship between the perceived angular size of an object and the size of the [[neural]] activity pattern it excites in the [[primary visual cortex]].\n\n==A relatively new idea==\nVisual angle illusions have been explicitly described by many vision researchers, including {{harvtxt|Joynson|1949}}, {{harvs|last=McCready|year1=1963|year2=1965|year3=1985|year4=1999}}, {{harvtxt|Rock |McDermott|1964}}, Baird (1970), Ono (1970), Roscoe (1985, 1989), Hershenson (1982, 1989), Reed (1984, 1989), Enright (1989), Plug & Ross (1989, 1994), Higashiyama & Shimono (1994), Gogel, & Eby (1997), Ross & Plug (2002), and Murray, Boyaci & Kersten (2006). Specifically, these researchers cited have advocated a relatively new idea: that many of the best-known size illusions demonstrate that for most observers the (subjective) perceived visual angle, ''θ′'', can change for a viewed target that subtends a constant (physical) visual angle ''θ''.\n\nIndeed, various experiments have revealed most of the factors responsible for these visual angle illusions, and a few different explanations for them have been published (Baird, Wagner, & Fuld, 1990, Enright, 1987, 1989, Hershenson, 1982, 1989, Komoda & Ono, 1974, McCready, 1965, 1985, 1986, 1994, Ono, 1970, Oyama, 1977, Reed, 1984, 1989, Restle, 1970, Roscoe, 1985, 1989).\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all discussions (and explanations) of those classic size illusions found in textbooks, the popular media, and on the internet use, instead, an older hypothesis that the visual angle is not perceivable (Gregory, 2008, Kaufman & Kaufman, 2002). They can describe and explain only a linear size illusion, which is why they do not properly describe or explain the illusions that most people experience.\n\nIn order to clarify the new paradigm which replaces the old one, it helps to keep in mind that an [[angle]] is the difference between two directions from a common point (the vertex). Accordingly, as described below, the visual angle ''θ'' is the difference between two real (optical) directions in the [[field of view]], while the perceived visual angle ''θ′'', is the difference by which the directions of two viewed points from oneself appear to differ in the [[visual field]].\n\n==Physical measures ''S'', ''D'', ''R'', and ''θ''==\n{{main|Visual angle}}\n[[Image:VisualAngleAboveHorizonDefs.svg|right|thumb|413px|Figure 1: Physical measures]]\nFigure 1 illustrates an observer's eye looking at a frontal extent '''AB''' that has a linear size ''S'' (also called its \"metric size\" or \"tape-measure size\"). The extent's lower endpoint at '''B''' lies at a distance ''D'' from point '''O''', which for present purposes can represent the center of the eye's [[entrance pupil]].\n\nThe line from '''B''' through '''O''' indicates the [[chief ray]] of the bundle of light rays that form the optical image of '''B''' on the [[retina]] at point '''b''', let's say, on the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]. Likewise, endpoint '''A''' is imaged at point '''a'''.\n\nThe optical (physical) angle between those chief rays is the visual angle ''θ'' which can be calculated:\n:<math>\\tan \\theta = S/D\\,</math>\n\nThe retinal images at '''b''' and '''a''' are separated by the distance ''R'', given by the equation\n:<math>R/n = \\tan \\theta\\,</math>\nin which ''n'' is the eye's [[nodal distance]] that averages about 17&nbsp;mm. That is, a viewed object's retinal image size is approximately given by {{nowrap|1=''R'' = 17 ''S''/''D'' mm}}.\n\nThe line from point '''O''' outward through object point '''B''' specifies the optical direction, ''d''<sub>'''B'''</sub>, of the object's base from the eye, let's say toward the [[horizon]]. The line from point '''O''' through point '''A''' specifies that endpoint's optical direction, ''d''<sub>'''A'''</sub>, toward some specific elevation value (say, 18&nbsp;degrees). The difference between those real directions ({{nowrap|''d''<sub>'''A'''</sub> − ''d''<sub>'''B'''</sub>}}) is, again, the visual angle ''θ''.\n\n==Perceived measures==\nFigure 2 diagrams the perceived (subjective) values for a viewed object.\n\n[[Image:VisualAnglePerceivedAboveHorizonDefs.svg|right|thumb|331px|Figure 2: Subjective values]]\nPoint '''O'''′ represents the place from which the observer feels that he or she is viewing the world. For present purposes, '''O'''′ can represent the cyclopean eye (Ono, 1970, Ono, Mapp & Howard, 2002).<ref>In some theories the cyclopean eye is, in effect, approximately midway between where one feels one's eye are located in one's [[body image]] of one's head (Ono, 1970, Ono, Mapp, & Howard, 2002). Some other theories define the place from which one feels one is viewing the world as the visual egocenter (Roelofs, 19xx, McCready, 1964, 1965, Sakuma & Pfaff, 1979) which, among observers, ranges, in effect, from about midway between the eyes to at least as far back as the center of the head, about 4&nbsp;inches behind the eyes, approximately midway between the two ears, on the axis for horizontal head rotations.</ref>\n\n===Perceived linear values ''D′'' and ''S′''===\nIn Figure 2, ''D′'' is the perceived distance of the subjective point '''B'''′ from '''O'''′. The observer might simply say how far away point '''B'''′ looks, in inches or meters or miles.\n\nSimilarly, ''S′'' is the perceived linear extent by which the subjective point '''A'''′ appears directly above point '''B'''′. The observer could simply say how many inches or meters that vertical distance looks. For a viewed object, ''S′'' thus is its perceived linear size in meters, (or apparent linear size).\n\n===Perceived visual angle ''θ′''===\nThe perceived endpoint at '''B'''′ has the perceived direction, ''d′''<sub>'''B'''</sub>, and the observer might simply say \"it looks straight ahead and toward the horizon.\"\n\nThis concept of the (subjective) visual direction is very old.<ref>The subjective experiences of visual directions were fully researched by [[Ewald Hering]] (1942/1879) and by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1962/1910) who distinguished between the perceived oculocentric directions and the perceived egocentric directions. They, and other theorists, have pointed out that a viewed point's egocentric direction (d'B and d'A here) is determined by a process that necessarily combines the position of the point's image on the retina with information about the position of the eye with respect to the head (and body).</ref> However, as Wade, Ono & Mapp (2006) noted, it unfortunately has been ignored in many current theories of size perception, and size illusions.\n\nThe object's other perceived endpoint, '''A'''′, has a perceived direction ''d′''<sub>'''A'''</sub>;, about which the observer might say \"it appears toward a higher elevation than point '''B'''′.\" The difference between the two perceived directions ({{nowrap|''d′''<sub>'''A'''</sub> − ''d′''<sub>'''B'''</sub>}}) is the perceived visual angle ''θ′'', also called the perceived angular size or apparent angular size.\n\nIt is not easy to quantify ''θ′''. For instance, a well-trained observer might say that point '''A'''′ \"looks about 25&nbsp;degrees higher\" than '''B'''′, but most cannot reliably say how large a direction difference looks. That skill is not practiced because it is easier to use pointing gestures (Ono, 1970): For example, one often tells another person about the change in the directions seen for two viewed points by pointing something, say a finger or the eyes from one point to the other.\n\nTherefore, in some experiments the observers aimed a pointer from one viewed point to the other, so the angle through which the pointer rotated was the measure of ''θ′'', (Komodo, 1970, Komodo & Ono, 1974, Ono, Muter, & Mitson, 1974, Gogel & Eby, 1997).\n\nAlso, because ''θ′'', specifies the amount by which one should rotate one's eye to quickly look from one seen point to another [[eye tracking]], [[saccade]], observers in other experiments shifted their gaze from one object endpoint to the other, and the angle the eye rotated through was measured as ''θ′'' for that object (Yarbus (1967).\n\n===Difference between ''θ′'' and ''S′''===\nIt is important to understand how ''θ′'' differs from ''S′''. Consider an example illustrated by the sketch at the right.\n\n[[Image:Window 200x220.jpg|right]]\nSuppose one is looking through a window at a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} house 240&nbsp;feet away, so it subtends a visual angle of about 7&nbsp;degrees. The {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} window opening is 10&nbsp;feet away, so it subtends a visual angle of 14&nbsp;degrees.\n\nIt can be said that the house \"looks larger and farther away\" than the window, meaning that the perceived linear size ''S′'' for the house's width is much larger than ''S′'' for the window; for instance a person might say the house \"looks about 40&nbsp;feet wide\" and the window \"looks about 3&nbsp;feet wide.\"\n\nOne can also say that the house \"looks smaller and farther away\" than the window, and that does not contradict the other statement because now we mean that the amount (''θ′'') by which directions of the house's edges appear to differ is, say, about half the apparent direction difference for the window edges.\n\nNotice that humans experience both the linear size and the angular size comparisons at the same time, along with the distance comparison (Joynson, 1949). Thus any report merely that one object \"looks larger\" than another object is ambiguous. It needs to specify whether \"looks larger\" refers to the perceived angular size (''θ′'') or to the perceived linear size (''S′'') or to both of those qualitatively different \"size\" experiences (Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985, Ono, 1970). Notice that in everyday conversations \"looks larger\" often refers to an angular size comparison rather than a linear size comparison.\n\nAdditional confusion has resulted from widespread use of the ambiguous terms \"apparent size\" and \"perceived size\", because they sometimes have referred to ''θ′'' and sometimes to ''S′'' without clarification, so the reader must try to ascertain what they mean. Also, in astronomy, \"[[apparent size]]\" refers to the physical angle ''θ'' rather than to the ''subjective'' apparent visual angle ''θ′''.\n\n===The perceptual size–distance invariance hypothesis===\nHow the three perceived values ''θ′'', ''S′'', and ''D′'' would be expected to relate to each other for a given object is illustrated by Figure 2 and stated by the following equation (McCready, 1965, 1985, Ono, 1970, Komoda and Ono, 1974, Reed, 1989, Kaneko & Uchikawa, 1997).\n:<math>S' / D' = \\tan \\theta'\\,</math>\n\nRoss & Plug (2002, Page 31) dubbed this new rule the \"perceptual size–distance invariance hypothesis\".\n\n==Retinal size, \"cortical size\" and ''θ′''==\nAs already noted, the magnitude of an object's visual angle ''θ'' determines the size ''R'' of its retinal image. And, the size of the [[retina]]l image normally determines the extent of the neural activity pattern the retina's neural activity eventually generates in the [[primary visual cortex]], area V1 or [[Brodmann area 17]]. This cortical area harbors a distorted but spatially isomorphic \"map\" of the retina (see [[Retinotopy]]). This neurological relationship recently was confirmed by Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten (2006) using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]].\n\nThe retinal image is not perceived or sensed. That is, [[experimental psychologist]]s long ago rejected any idea that people \"sense\" a [[perception#terminology|proximal stimulus]] such as the retinal image. As Gogel (1969, 1997) has repeatedly emphasized, there is no \"sensation\" which could be called the \"perceived retinal image size\", ''R′''.\n\nAlso rejected is a popular idea that an object's \"perceived size\" results from a \"scaling of retinal size\"; an illogical process that somehow \"magnifies\" the very small \"retinal size\" to yield the viewed object's much larger perceived linear size ''S′''.\n\nInstead, the physical retinal extent ''R'' normally determines the magnitude of the perceived visual angle ''θ′''. But, as already noted, \"other factors\" can intervene to slightly change ''θ′'' for a target forming a constant sized retinal image (and thereby create a visual angle illusion). Indeed, the major discovery by Murray et al. (2006) concerns this flexible relationship between ''R'' and ''θ′'', as described below.\n\n===Visual angle illusions and area V1===\nThe Murray, et al. (2006) observers viewed a flat picture with two disks that subtended the same visual angle ''θ'' and formed retinal images of the same size (''R''), but the perceived angular size, ''θ′'', for one disk was larger than ''θ′'' for the other (say, 17% larger) due to differences in their background patterns. And, in cortical Area V1, the sizes of the activity patterns related to the disks were unequal, despite the fact that the retinal images were the same size. The difference between these \"cortical sizes\" in Area V1 for the illusion disks was essentially the same as the difference produced by two non-illusory disks whose retinal image sizes differed by, say, 17%.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that their findings dramatically disagree with the hypothetical models of neural events being proposed in nearly all current theories of visual spatial perception.\n\nMurray, et al. (2006) also noted that the flat illusion pattern they used can represent other classic \"size\" illusions, such as the [[Ponzo illusion]] and, as well, the [[moon illusion]] which is a visual angle illusion for most observers, (McCready, 1965, 1986, Restle 1970, Plug & Ross, 1989, p.&nbsp;21, Ross & Plug, 2002).\n\nA detailed meta-analysis of the Murray et al. (2006) results is available in McCready (2007, Appendix B).\n\n==The size–distance paradox==\n\n===The classical size–distance invariance hypothesis===\nConventional \"textbook\" theories of \"size\" and distance perception do not refer to the perceived visual angle (e.g., Gregory, 1963, 1970, 1998, 2008) and some researchers even deny that it exists (Kaufman & Kaufman, 2002). This idea that one does not see the different directions in which objects lie from oneself is a basis of the so-called \"size–distance invariance hypothesis\" (SDIH).\n\nThat old SDIH logic (geometry) is typically illustrated using a diagram that resembles Figure 2, but has the physical visual angle ''θ'' substituted for the perceived visual angle ''θ′''. The equation for the SDIH thus is\n:<math>S' / D' = \\tan \\theta\\,</math>\n\nHere, ''S′'' is typically called the \"perceived size\" or \"apparent size\"; more precisely it is the perceived linear size, measured in meters.\n\nWhen rearranged as {{nowrap|''S′'' {{=}} ''D′'' tan ''θ''}}, the equation expresses [[Emmert's law]].\n\nHowever, at least since 1962, researchers have pointed out that many classic \"size\" and distance illusions can be neither described nor explained using the SDIH, so a new hypothesis is needed (Boring 1962, Gruber, 1956, McCready, 1965, Baird, 1970, Ono 1970). For instance, consider the simple Ebbinghaus illusion.\n\n===Example: the Ebbinghaus illusion===\n{{main|Ebbinghaus illusion}}\n[[Image:Mond-vergleich.svg|240px|thumb|right|The two orange circles are exactly the same size; however, the one on the left ''seems'' smaller.]]\nThe two central circles are the same linear size ''S'' and the same viewing distance ''D'', so they subtend the same visual angle ''θ'' and form equal-sized retinal images. But the lower one \"looks larger\" than the upper one.\n\nAccording to the SDIH, \"looks larger\" can mean only that ''S′'' is greater, and with the physical angle ''θ'' the same for both, the SDIH requires that ''D′'' be greater for the lower one than for the upper one. However, for most observers, both circles appear unequal while also appearing at the same distance (on the same page).\n\nThis commonly found disagreement between published data and the SDIH is known as the \"size–distance paradox\" (Gruber, 1956, Ono, et al. 1974).\n\nThe \"paradox\" completely vanishes, however, when the illusion is described, instead, as basically a visual angle illusion: That is, the perceived visual angle ''θ′'' is larger for the lower circle than for the upper circle: It is as if its retinal image were larger. So. according to the \"new\" perceptual invariance hypothesis, ({{nowrap|''S′'' / ''D′'' {{=}} tan ''θ′''}}), with ''θ′'' larger for the lower circle, and with ''D′'' correctly the same for both circles, then ''S′'' becomes larger for the lower one by the same ratio that ''θ′'' is larger. That is, the reason the lower one looks a larger linear size on the page is because it looks a larger angular size than the upper one.\n\n===Explaining visual angle illusions remains difficult===\nThe new hypothesis that includes ''θ′'' along with ''S′'' describes the Ebbinghaus illusion and many other classic \"size\" illusions more completely and more logically than does the popular SDIH. What still needs to be explained, however, is why the basic visual angle illusion occurs in each example.\n\nDescribing the few existing explanations for visual angle illusions is beyond the scope of this present entry. The most recent theories have been presented mostly in articles concerning the moon illusion (Baird et al., 1990, Enright, 1989a, 1989b, Hershenson, 1982, 1989b, Higashiyama, 1992, McCready 1986, 1999–2007, Plug & Ross, 1989, Reed, 1989, Roscoe, 1989, and especially in two \"moon illusion\" books (Hershenson, 1989; Ross & Plug, 2002) which make it quite clear that vision scientists have not yet agreed upon any particular theory of visual angle illusions.\n\nThere also is the lesser-known, but evidently the largest visual angle illusion of oculomotor micropsia ([[convergence micropsia]]) for which a few different explanations are being considered (McCready, 1965, 2007, Ono, 1970, Komoda & Ono, 1974, Ono, et al. 1974, Enright, 1987b, 1989a, 1989b).\n\nThis is a partial list of \"size and distance\" illusions that begin as visual angle illusions (angular size illusions) for most observers.\n\n*[[Moon illusion]]\n*Oculomotor micropsia ([[convergence micropsia]])\n*[[Ebbinghaus illusion]] (Titchner circles)\n*[[Hering illusion]]\n*[[Ponzo illusion]]\n*[[Müller-Lyer illusion]]\n*[[Orbison illusion]]\n*[[Jastrow illusion]]\n*[[Wundt illusion]]\n*Curvature of the [[apparent fronto-parallel plane]] (AFPP)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{citation |last=Baird |first=J.C. |year=1970 |title=Psychophysical analysis of visual space |location=Oxford, London |publisher=Pergamon Press}}\n*{{citation |last1=Baird |first1=J.C. |last2=Wagner |first2=M. |last3=Fuld |first3=K. |year=1990 |title=A simple but powerful theory of the moon illusion |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=675–677 |doi=10.1037/0096-1523.16.3.675}}\n*{{citation |last1=Barbeito |first1=R. |last2=Ono |first2=H |year=1979 |title=Four methods of locating the egocenter: a comparison of their predictive validities and reliabilities |journal=Behav Res Methods Instrum |volume=11 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.3758/bf03205428}}\n*{{citation |last=Enright |first=J.T. |year=1987a |title=Art and the oculomotor system: Perspective illustrations evoke vergence changes |journal=Perception |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=731–746 |doi=10.1068/p160731 |pmid=3454431}}\n*{{citation |doi=10.1016/0042-6989(87)90160-X |last=Enright |first=J.T. |year=1987b |title=Perspective vergence: Oculomotor responses to line drawings |journal=Vision Research |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=1513–1526 |pmid=3445485|citeseerx=10.1.1.211.4341 }}\n*{{citation |doi=10.1016/0042-6989(89)90162-4 |last=Enright |first=J.T. |year=1989a |title=Manipulating stereopsis and vergence in an outdoor setting: Moon, sky and horizon |journal=Vision Research |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1815–1824 |pmid=2631401}}\n*{{citation |last=Enright |first=J.T. |year=1989b |chapter=4.

In this case, the phase angle is the phase difference between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.\n\nIn the context of periodic phenomena, such as a [[Sine wave|wave]], ''phase angle'' is synonymous with [[Phase (waves)|phase]].\n\n==Bioelectric impedance==\nIn [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]] in humans, an estimate of the phase angle can be obtained and is based on changes in resistance and reactance as alternating current passes through tissues, which causes a phase shift. The measured phase angle therefore depends on several biological factors.

In the context of astronomical observations, this is usually the angle [[Sun]]-object-observer.\n\nFor terrestrial observations, \"Sun–object–Earth\" is often nearly the same thing as \"Sun–object–observer\", since the difference depends on the [[parallax]], which in the case of observations of the [[Moon]] can be as much as 1°, or two full Moon diameters. With the development of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], as well as in hypothetical observations from other points in space, the notion of phase angle became independent of Sun and Earth.\n\nThe [[etymology]] of the term is related to the notion of [[planetary phase]]s, since the [[brightness]] of an object and its appearance as a \"phase\" is the function of the phase angle.\n\nThe phase angle varies from 0° to 180°. The value of 0° corresponds to the position where the illuminator, the observer, and the object are collinear, with the illuminator and the observer on the same side of the object. This is known as [[astronomical opposition]]. The value of 180° is the position where the object is between the illuminator and the observer. Values less than 90° represent [[backscatter]]ing; values greater than 90° represent [[forward scatter]]ing.\n\nFor some objects, such as the [[Moon]] (see [[lunar phases]]), [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] the phase angle (as seen from the Earth) covers the full 0&ndash;180° range. The [[superior planet]]s cover shorter ranges. For example, for [[Mars]] the maximum phase angle is about 45°.\n\nThe brightness of an object is a function of the phase angle, which is generally smooth, except for the so-called [[opposition spike]] near 0°, which does not affect gas giants or bodies with pronounced atmospheres, and when the object becomes fainter as the angle approaches 180°. This relationship is referred to as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Illumination angle]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/phase-angle?q=phase+angle Oxford dictionary definition]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phase Angle (Astronomy)}}\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n[[Category:Radiometry]]\n[[Category:Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)]]"

      "text": "[[File:Position angle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of how position angle is estimated through a telescope eyepiece; the primary star is at center.]]\n'''Position angle''', usually abbreviated '''PA''', is the convention for measuring angles on the sky  in astronomy. The [[International Astronomical Union]] defines it as the angle measured relative to the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]] (NCP), turning positive into the direction of the [[right ascension]]. In the standard (non-flipped) images this is a counterclockwise measure relative to the axis into the direction of positive [[declination]].\n\nIn the case of  observed [[Visual binary|visual binary stars]], it is defined as the angular offset of the secondary star from the primary relative to the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]].\n\nAs the example illustrates, if one were observing a hypothetical binary star with a PA of 135 degrees, that means an imaginary line in the eyepiece drawn from the north celestial pole to the primary (P) would be offset from the secondary (S) such that the NCP-P-S angle would be 135 degrees.\n\nWhen graphing visual binary orbits, the NCP line is traditionally drawn downward—that is, with north at bottom—and PA is measured counterclockwise.\n\nAlso the direction of the [[proper motion]] can for example be given by its position angle.\n\nThe definition of position angle is also applied to extended objects like galaxies, where it refers to the angle made by the major axis of the object with the NCP line.\n\n==Nautics==\nThe concept of the position angle is inherited from nautical navigation on the oceans, where the optimum [[compass]] course is the course from a known position {{math|'''s'''}} to a target position {{math|'''t'''}} with minimum effort. Setting aside the influence of winds and ocean currents, the optimum course is the course of smallest distance between the two positions on the ocean surface. Computing the compass course is known as the ''inverse problem'' of [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesics]].\n\nThis article considers only the abstraction of minimizing the distance between {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}} traveling on the surface of a sphere with some radius {{math|R}}.

Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum.\n\nA generalization of this theorem is the [[law of cosines]], which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them. If the angle between the other sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation.\n\n==Other proofs of the theorem==\nThis theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] being another contender for that distinction); the book ''The Pythagorean Proposition'' contains 370 proofs.<ref>{{Harv|Loomis|1968}}</ref>\n\n===Proof using similar triangles===\n[[File:Pythagoras similar triangles simplified.svg|thumb|Proof using similar triangles]]\nThis proof is based on the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of the sides of two [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangles, that is, upon the fact that the [[ratio]] of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.\n\nLet ''ABC'' represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at ''C'', as shown on the figure. Draw the [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]] from point ''C'', and call ''H'' its intersection with the side ''AB''. Point ''H'' divides the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' into parts ''d'' and ''e''. The new triangle ''ACH'' is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to triangle ''ABC'', because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at ''A'', meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as ''θ'' in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle ''CBH'' is also similar to ''ABC''. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the [[triangle postulate]]: the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]]. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:\n:<math> \\frac{BC}{AB}=\\frac{BH}{BC} \\text{ and } \\frac{AC}{AB}=\\frac{AH}{AC}.</math>\nThe first result equates the [[cosine]]s of the angles ''θ'', whereas the second result equates their [[sine]]s.\n\nThese ratios can be written as\n:<math>BC^2 = AB \\times BH \\text{ and } AC^2=AB \\times AH. </math>\nSumming these two equalities results in\n:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB\\times BH+AB\\times AH=AB\\times(AH+BH)=AB^2 ,</math>\nwhich, after simplification, expresses the Pythagorean theorem:\n:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB^2 \\ .</math>\n\nThe role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the ''Elements'', and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.<ref>{{Harv|Maor|2007| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&pg=PA39&dq=%22why+did+Euclid+choose+this+particular+proof%22&hl=en&ei=WckoTLv4JIKknQecwvWoAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22why%20did%20Euclid%20choose%20this%20particular%20proof%22&f=false  39]}}</ref><ref name=Hawking>\n{{cite book |title=God created the integers: the mathematical breakthroughs that changed history |author=Stephen W.

The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]], proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.\n\nLet ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a right triangle, with a right angle at ''A''.

The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}}, containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup> uncovered, the second of which leaves square ''c''<sup>2</sup> uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>.}}\n\nA second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area ''c''<sup>2</sup>, from four identical right triangles with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides ''a'' and ''b'' by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup>, which must have the same area as the initial large square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#10 |title= Pythagorean theorem, proof number 10|author=[[Alexander Bogomolny]] |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two.

In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.  Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle.  Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.\n\n===Algebraic proofs===\n[[File:Pythagoras algebraic2.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of the two algebraic proofs]]\n\nThe theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', arranged inside a square with side ''c'' as in the top half of the diagram.<ref name=rotate>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#3 |title=Cut-the-knot.org: Pythagorean theorem and its many proofs, Proof #3 |author=Alexander Bogomolny |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=4 November 2010}}\n</ref> The triangles are similar with area <math>\\tfrac12ab</math>, while the small square has side {{nowrap|''b'' − ''a''}} and area {{nowrap|(''b'' − ''a'')<sup>2</sup>}}.

L., ''A History of Greek Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 1921; reprinted by Dover, 1981.</ref> and was included by [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'':<ref name=Euclid_VI>Euclid's ''Elements'': Book VI, Proposition VI 31: \"In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle.\"</ref>\n\n<blockquote>If one erects similar figures (see [[Euclidean geometry]]) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.</blockquote>\n\nThis extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are ''a:b:c'').<ref name=Putz>Putz, John F. and Sipka, Timothy A. \"On generalizing the Pythagorean theorem\", ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 34 (4), September 2003, pp. 291–295.</ref> While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).<ref name=Putz/>\n\nThe basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are erected on sides with corresponding lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' then:\n\n:<math>\\frac{A}{a^2} = \\frac{B}{b^2} = \\frac{C}{c^2}\\, ,</math>\n:<math>\\Rightarrow A + B = \\frac{a^2}{c^2}C + \\frac{b^2}{c^2}C\\, .</math>\n\nBut, by the Pythagorean theorem, ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''c''<sup>2</sup>, so ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C''.\n\nConversely, if we can prove that ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle ''C'' on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (''A'' and ''B'' ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]]. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.

The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base ''b'' and height ''h''. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle.

Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure. The length of diagonal ''BD'' is found from Pythagoras's theorem as:\n\n:<math> \\overline{BD}^{\\,2} = \\overline{BC}^{\\,2} + \\overline{CD}^{\\,2} \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal ''BD'' and the vertical edge ''AB'', the length of diagonal ''AD'' then is found by a second application of Pythagoras's theorem as:\n\n:<math> \\overline{AD}^{\\,2} = \\overline{AB}^{\\,2} + \\overline{BD}^{\\,2} \\ ,</math>\nor, doing it all in one step:\n:<math> \\overline{AD}^{\\,2} = \\overline{AB}^{\\,2} + \\overline{BC}^{\\,2} + \\overline{CD}^{\\,2} \\ .</math>\n\nThis result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector '''v''' (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {'''v'''<sub>k</sub>} (the three mutually perpendicular sides):\n\n:<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\|\\mathbf{v}_k\\|^2.</math>\n\nThis one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras's theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.\n\nA substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is [[de Gua's theorem]], named for [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]: If a [[tetrahedron]] has a right angle corner (like a corner of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]]), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the \"''n''-dimensional Pythagorean theorem\":<ref name=Bhatia>\n\n{{cite book |title=Matrix analysis |author=Rajendra Bhatia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eay3HALl620C&pg=PA21 |page=21 |isbn=0-387-94846-5 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer}}\n\n</ref>\n{{Blockquote|text=Let <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots,x_n </math> be orthogonal vectors in ℝ<sup>n</sup>.

Fried |chapter=4 – Terrestrial Radio-Navigation Systems}}</ref>  Like [[radiolocation]], it is a type of [[radiodetermination]].\n\nThe basic principles are measurements from/to [[electric beacon]]s, especially\n* [[Direction (geometry)|Angular directions]], e.g. by bearing, radio phases or interferometry,\n* [[Distance measuring equipment|Distances]], e.g. [[ranging]] by measurement of [[time of flight]] between one transmitter and multiple receivers or vice versa,\n* Distance ''differences'' by measurement of [[multilateration|times of arrival]] of signals from one transmitter to multiple receivers or vice versa\n* Partly also [[velocity]], e.g. by means of radio [[Doppler shift]].\n\nCombinations of these measurement principles also are important—e.g., many radars measure range and azimuth of a target.\n\n==Bearing-measurement systems==\nThese systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground. Conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a [[radio fix]]. These were introduced prior to World War I, and remain in use today.\n\n===Radio direction finding===\n[[File:Earhart-electra 10.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amelia Earhart]]'s [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed Electra]] had a prominent RDF loop on the cockpit roof.]]\n{{Main|Radio direction finder}}\n\nThe first system of radio navigation was the ''Radio Direction Finder'', or RDF.<ref name=\"KF116\">Kayton, Fried 1977, p.116</ref>  By tuning in a [[radio station]] and then using a [[directional antenna]], one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna. A second measurement using another station was then taken. Using [[triangulation]], the two directions can be plotted on a map where their [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] reveals the location of the navigator. Commercial [[AM radio]] stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power, but strings of low-power [[Nondirectional beacon|radio beacon]]s were also set up specifically for this task, especially near [[airport]]s and harbours.\n\nEarly RDF systems normally used a [[loop antenna]], a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis.<ref name=\"KF116\"/> At most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern, but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other, producing a sharp drop in reception known as the \"null\". By rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null, the relative bearing of the station can be determined. Loop antennas can be seen on most pre-1950s aircraft and ships.\n\n===Reverse RDF===\n[[File:The 'Black Beacon', Orford Ness - geograph.org.uk - 935140.jpg|thumb|right|The Orfordness Beacon as it appears today.]]\n\nThe main problem with RDF is that it required a special antenna on the vehicle, which may not be easy to mount on smaller vehicles or single-crew aircraft. A smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna, but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult.\n\nDuring the era between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground. As the antenna rotated through a fixed position, typically due north, the antenna was keyed with the [[morse code]] signal of the station's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station. Then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction. By timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null, then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station, the bearing of the station could be calculated.\n\nThe first such system was the German [[Telefunken Kompass Sender]], which began operations in 1907 and was used operationally by the [[Zeppelin]] fleet until 1918.<ref name=bauer2004>{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Arthur O.|title=Some historical and technical aspects of radio navigation, in Germany, over the period 1907 to 1945|url=http://www.cdvandt.org/Navigati.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=Dec 26, 2004}}</ref>  An improved version was introduced by the UK as the [[Orfordness Beacon]] in 1929 and used until the mid-1930s. A number of improved versions followed, replacing the mechanical motion of the antennas with phasing techniques that produced the same output pattern with no moving parts. One of the longest lasting examples was [[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]], which went into operation just before [[World War II]] and was used operationally under the name Consol until 1991. The modern VOR system is based on the same principles (see below).\n\n=== ADF and NDB===\n{{Main|Non-directional beacon}}\n\nA great advance in the RDF technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas, or a single highly directional [[solenoid]]. These receivers were smaller, more accurate, and simpler to operate. Combined with the introduction of the [[transistor]] and [[integrated circuit]], RDF systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s, and were known by the new name, [[automatic direction finder]], or ADF.\n\nThis also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these RDF systems, now referred to as ''non-directional beacons'' (NDB). As the LF/MF signals used by NDBs can follow the curvature of earth, NDB has a much greater range than [[VHF Omnidirectional Range|VOR]] which travels only in ''line of sight''. NDB can be categorized as ''long range'' or ''short range'' depending on their power. The frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750&nbsp;kHz, but the same system can be used with any common AM-band commercial station.\n\n===VOR===\n[[File:VOR DME BUB.JPG|right|thumb|VOR transmitter station]]\n{{Main|VHF omnidirectional range}}\n\n[[VHF omnidirectional range]], or VOR, is an implementation of the reverse-RDF system, but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated.\n\nInstead of a single signal, the VOR transmitter sends out three signals – one is a simple voice channel that sends morse code to identify the station, another is a continuous signal sent in all directions, and the last is a signal that is rotated at 30 RPM. Like the Orfordness concept, the bearing of the station is measured by finding the rotating signal's peak or null. But instead of timing the signal, the rotating signal is changed in [[phase (waves)|phase]] in synchronicity with its rotation, such that it is in-phase when pointed north, 90 degrees off when it points east, and so forth. By comparing the phase of the received signal with the one being broadcast omnidirectionally, the angle can be determined using simple electronics. This angle is then displayed in the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] of the [[aircraft]], and can be used to take a [[position fixing|fix]] just like the earlier RDF systems, although it is easier to use.<ref name=\"KF123\">Kayton, Fried 1977, p.123</ref>\n\nAs VOR required two VHF receivers as well as a conventional radio for station identification, the system did not become popular until the era of miniaturized electronics, first with small tubes in the 1950s, and semiconductor systems in the 1960s. During this period it quickly took over from the older Radio Range system (see below). The signals from the stations could be received anywhere, as opposed to the beams which were only broadcast in certain directions, so in theory the VOR system could be used for free navigation from any to any point. In practice, the older Radio Range procedures were so widely used and standardized that VOR was used to produce a similar set of [[Airway (aviation)|airways]] that remained in use well into the 21st century.\n\nThe US military also introduced a VOR-like system known as [[TACAN]]. It differed from VOR primarily in its modulation system, adding a Lorentz-like signal to accurately define the center of the rotating beam and thereby improve accuracy. It requires five receiver channels and additional electronics, an expensive requirement when it was introduced.<ref name=\"KF133\">Kayton, Fried 1977, p.133</ref>\n\n==Beam systems==\nBeam systems broadcast narrow signals in the sky, and navigation is accomplished by keeping the aircraft centred in the beam. A number of stations are used to create an [[Airway (aviation)|airway]], with the navigator tuning in different stations along the direction of travel. These systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive, as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies. However, they did not provide navigation outside of the beams, and were thus less flexible in use. The rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after World War II made systems like VOR practical, and most beam systems rapidly disappeared.\n\n===Lorenz===\n{{Main|Lorenz beam}}\n\nIn the post-World War I era, the Lorenz company of Germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center. By broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams, the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones. The system was accurate to less than a degree in some forms.\n\nOriginally known as \"Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer\" (LFF), or simply \"Leitstrahl\" (guiding beam), little money was available to develop a network of stations. Deployment was instead led by the US, where it formed the basis of a wide-area navigation system through the 1930s and 40s (see LFF, below). Development was restarted in Germany in the 1930s as a short-range system deployed at airports as a [[blind landing]] aid. Although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the US LFF, deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the Orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate [[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]] system. In all of these roles, the system was generically known simply as a \"Lorenz beam\".\n\nIn the immediate pre-World War II era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system. This used very large antennas to provide the required accuracy at long distances (over England), and very powerful transmitters. Two such beams were used, crossing over the target to triangulate it. Bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver, using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs. The system was highly accurate, and the '[[Battle of the Beams]]' broke out when [[United Kingdom]] [[intelligence service]]s attempted, and then succeeded, in rendering the system useless through [[electronic warfare]]. Sonne, however, proved just as useful to the UK as Germany, and was left to operate unhindered throughout the war{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}.\n\n===Low frequency radio range===\n[[File:LFR-photo.jpg|thumb|right|LFR ground station]]\n{{Main|Low frequency radio range}}\nThe low-frequency radio range (LFR, also other names) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying]] in the 1930s and 1940s in the U.S. and other countries, until the advent of the VOR in the late 1940s. It was used for both en route navigation as well as [[instrument approach]]es.\n\nThe ground stations consisted of a set of four antennas that projected Lorenz beams in four cardinal directions. One of the beams was \"keyed\" with the morse code signal \"A\", dit-dah, with the second beam \"N\", dah-dit. Flying down the centreline produced a steady tone. The beams were pointed to the next station to produce a set of [[Airway (aviation)|airways]], allowing an aircraft to travel from airport to airport by following a selected set of stations. Effective course accuracy was about three degrees, which near the station provided sufficient safety margins for [[instrument approach]]es down to low minimums. At its peak deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR stations in the US.\n\n=== Glide path and the localizer of ILS ===\nThe remaining widely used beam systems are '''glide path''' and the '''localizer''' of the ''[[instrument landing system]]'' (ILS). ILS uses a ''localizer'' to provide horizontal position and ''glide path'' to provide vertical positioning. ILS can provide enough accuracy and redundancy to allow automated landings.<br />\nFor more information see also: {{main|Instrument landing system glide path|Instrument landing system localizer}}\n\n==Transponder systems==\n{{main|Transponder}}\n{{see also|Transponder landing system}}\nPositions can be determined with any two measures of angle or distance. The introduction of [[radar]] in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances. Navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared, and remained in widespread use until recently. Today they are used primarily for aviation, although GPS has largely supplanted this role.\n\n===Radar and transponders===\nEarly [[radar]] systems, like the UK's [[Chain Home]], consisted of large transmitters and separate receivers. The transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal, which is sent into space through broadcast antennas. When the signal reflects off a target, some of that signal is reflected back in the direction of the station, where it is received. The received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power, and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used.\n\nThe same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator's station, which is equipped with an [[oscilloscope]]. Electronics attached to the oscilloscope provides a signal that increases in voltage over a short period of time, a few microseconds. When sent to the X input of the oscilloscope, this causes a horizontal line to be displayed on the scope. This \"sweep\" is triggered by a signal tapped off the broadcaster, so the sweep begins when the pulse is sent. Amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the Y input, where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display. This causes a series of \"blips\" to appear along the horizontal axis, indicating reflected signals. By measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip, which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception, the distance to the object can be determined.\n\nSoon after the introduction of radar, the radio [[transponder]] appeared. Transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal, normally a pulse on a particular frequency, the transponder sends out a pulse in response, typically delayed by some very short time. Transponders were initially used as the basis for early [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] systems; aircraft with the proper transponder would appear on the display as part of the normal radar operation, but then the signal from the transponder would cause a second blip to appear a short time later. Single blips were enemies, double blips friendly.\n\nTransponder-based distance-distance navigation systems have a significant advantage in terms of positional accuracy. Any radio signal spreads out over distance, forming the fan-like beams of the Lorenz signal, for instance. As the distance between the broadcaster and receiver grows, the area covered by the fan increases, decreasing the accuracy of location within it. In comparison, transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals, and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else. This allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range.\n\nThe latest transponder systems (mode S) can also provide position information, possibly derived from [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]], allowing for even more precise positioning of targets.\n\n===Bombing systems===\nThe first distance-based navigation system was the German [[Y-Gerät (navigation)|Y-Gerät]] blind-bombing system. This used a [[Lorenz beam]] for horizontal positioning, and a transponder for ranging. A ground-based system periodically sent out pulses which the airborne transponder returned. By measuring the total round-trip time on a radar's oscilloscope, the aircraft's range could be accurately determined even at very long ranges. An operator then relayed this information to the bomber crew over voice channels, and indicated when to drop the bombs.\n\nThe British introduced similar systems, notably the [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] system. This used two stations in England that operated on different frequencies and allowed the aircraft to be triangulated in space. To ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations, and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator. The second station was used, as in Y-Gerät, to time the bomb drop. Unlike Y-Gerät, Oboe was deliberately built to offer very high accuracy, as good as 35&nbsp;m, much better than even the best optical [[bombsight]]s.\n\nOne problem with Oboe was that it allowed only one aircraft to be guided at a time. This was addressed in the later [[Gee-H (navigation)|Gee-H]] system by placing the transponder on the ground and broadcaster in the aircraft. The signals were then examined on existing [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] display units in the aircraft (see below). Gee-H did not offer the accuracy of Oboe, but could be used by as many as 90 aircraft at once. This basic concept has formed the basis of most distance measuring navigation systems to this day.\n\n===Beacons===\n{{main|Electric beacon}}\nThe key to the transponder concept is that it can be used with existing radar systems. The [[List of World War II British naval radar#ASV II|ASV]] radar introduced by [[RAF Coastal Command]] was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength. Adding a ground-based transponder immediately turned the same display into a system able to guide the aircraft towards a transponder, or \"beacon\" in this role, with high accuracy.\n\nThe British put this concept to use in their [[Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar|Rebecca/Eureka]] system, where battery-powered \"Eureka\" transponders were triggered by airborne \"Rebecca\" radios and then displayed on ASV Mk. II radar sets. Eureka's were provided to French resistance fighters, who used them to call in supply drops with high accuracy. The US quickly adopted the system for paratroop operations, dropping the Eureka with pathfinder forces or partisans, and then homing in on those signals to mark the drop zones.\n\nThe beacon system was widely used in the post-war era for blind bombing systems. Of particular note were systems used by the [[US Marines]] that allowed the signal to be delayed in such a way to offset the drop point. These systems allowed the troops at the front line to direct the aircraft to points in front of them, directing fire on the enemy. Beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well, as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered, able to be man portable or mounted on a [[Jeep]].\n\n===DME===\n{{main|Distance measuring equipment}}\n{{see also|Tactical air navigation system}}\nIn the post-war era, a general navigation system using transponder-based systems was deployed as the [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) system.\n\nDME was identical to Gee-H in concept, but used new electronics to automatically measure the time delay and display it as a number, rather than having the operator time the signals manually on an oscilloscope. This led to the possibility that DME interrogation pulses from different aircraft might be confused, but this was solved by having each aircraft send out a different series of pulses which the ground-based transponder repeated back.\n\nDME is almost always used in conjunction with VOR, and is normally co-located at a VOR station. This combination allows a single VOR/DME station to provide both angle and distance, and thereby provide a single-station fix. DME is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military [[TACAN]] system, and their DME signals can be used by civilian receivers.\n\n==Hyperbolic systems==\n{{main|Hyperbolic navigation}}\nHyperbolic navigation systems are a modified form of transponder systems which eliminate the need for an airborne transponder. The name refers to the fact that they do not produce a single distance or angle, but instead indicate a location along any number of hyperbolic lines in space. Two such measurements produces a fix. As these systems are almost always used with a specific [[navigational chart]] with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it, they generally reveal the receiver's location directly, eliminating the need for manual triangulation. As these charts were digitized, they became the first true location-indication navigational systems, outputting the location of the receiver as latitude and longitude. Hyperbolic systems were introduced during World War II and remained the main long-range advanced navigation systems until GPS replaced them in the 1990s.\n\n===Gee===\n{{main|Gee (navigation)}}\nThe first hyperbolic system to be developed was the British [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] system, developed during [[World War II]]. Gee used a series of transmitters sending out precisely timed signals, with the signals leaving the stations at fixed delays. An aircraft using Gee, [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s heavy [[bomber]]s, examined the time of arrival on an [[oscilloscope]] at the navigator's station. If the signal from two stations arrived at the same time, the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters, allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations. More typically, the signal from one station would be received earlier than the other. The ''difference'' in timing between the two signals would reveal them to be along a curve of possible locations. By making similar measurements with other stations, additional lines of position can be produced, leading to a fix. Gee was accurate to about 165&nbsp;yards (150&nbsp;m) at short ranges, and up to a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) at longer ranges over Germany. Gee remained in use long after World War II, and equipped RAF aircraft as late as the 1960s (approx freq was by then 68&nbsp;MHz).\n\n===LORAN===\n{{main|LORAN}}\nWith Gee entering operation in 1942, similar US efforts were seen to be superfluous. They turned their development efforts towards a much longer-ranged system based on the same principles, using much lower frequencies that allowed coverage across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The result was [[LORAN]], for \"LOng-range Aid to Navigation\". The downside to the long-wavelength approach was that accuracy was greatly reduced compared to the high-frequency Gee. LORAN was widely used during convoy operations in the late war period.<ref name=JBLoran-C>{{cite web|title=The Loran-C System of Navigation|url=http://www.loran-history.info/Loran-C/Jansky%20_%20Bailey%201962.pdf|publisher=Jansky & Bailey|accessdate=25 July 2013|pages=18–23|date=February 1962}}</ref>\n\n===Decca===\n{{main|Decca Navigator System}}\nAnother British system from the same era was Decca Navigator. This differed from Gee primarily in that the signals were not pulses delayed in time, but continuous signals delayed in phase. By comparing the phase of the two signals, the time difference information as Gee was returned. However, this was far easier to display; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation. As the circuitry for driving this display was quite small, Decca systems normally used three such displays, allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes. Decca found its greatest use post-war on ships, and remained in use into the 1990s.\n\n===LORAN-C===\n{{main|Loran-C}}\nAlmost immediately after the introduction of LORAN, in 1952 work started on a greatly improved version. LORAN-C (the original retroactively became LORAN-A) combined the techniques of pulse timing in Gee with the phase comparison of Decca.\n\nThe resulting system (operating in the [[low frequency]] (LF) radio spectrum from 90 to 110&nbsp;kHz) that was both long-ranged (for 60&nbsp;kW stations, up to 3400 miles) and accurate. To do this, LORAN-C sent a pulsed signal, but modulated the pulses with an AM signal within it. Gross positioning was determined using the same methods as Gee, locating the receiver within a wide area. Finer accuracy was then provided by measuring the phase difference of the signals, overlaying that second measure on the first. By 1962, high-power LORAN-C was in place in at least 15 countries.<ref>Jansky & Baily 1962, pp.23–37.</ref>\n\nLORAN-C was fairly complex to use, requiring a room of equipment to pull out the different signals. However, with the introduction of [[integrated circuit]]s, this was quickly reduced further and further. By the late 1970s, LORAN-C units were the size of a stereo amplifier and were commonly found on almost all commercial ships as well as some larger aircraft. By the 1980s, this had been further reduced to the size of a conventional radio, and it became common even on pleasure boats and personal aircraft. It was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s, and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down, like Gee and Decca. However, like the beam systems before it, civilian use of LORAN-C was short-lived when GPS technology drove it from the market.\n\n===Other hyperbolic systems===\nSimilar hyperbolic systems included the US global-wide [[VLF]]/[[Omega Navigation System]], and the similar [[Alpha (radio navigation)|Alpha]] deployed by the USSR. These systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals, but by comparison of a single signal with a local [[atomic clock]].

These are essentially hyperbolic<ref name=\"Abel1\">\"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee, ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748–53, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang2\">\"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", B.T. Fang, ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref> systems whose transmitters are in orbits. That the satellites move with respect to the receiver requires that the calculation of the positions of the satellites must be taken into account, which can only be handled effectively with a computer.\n\n[[Satellite navigation system]]s send several signals that are used to decode the satellite's position, distance between the user satellite, and the user's precise time. One signal encodes the satellite's ''ephemeris'' data, which is used to accurately calculate the satellite's location at any time. Space weather and other effects causes the orbit to change over time so the ephemeris has to be updated periodically. Other signals send out the time as measured by the satellite's onboard [[atomic clock]]. By measuring signal times of arrival (TOAs) from at least four satellites, the user's receiver can re-build an accurate clock signal of its own and allows hyperbolic navigation to be carried out.\n\n[[Satellite navigation system]]s offer better accuracy than any land-based system, are available at almost all locations on the Earth, can be implemented (receiver-side) a modest cost and complexity, with modern electronics, and require only a few dozen satellites to provide worldwide coverage{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}. As a result of these advantages, satellite navigation has led to almost all previous systems falling from use{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}. LORAN, Omega, Decca, Consol and many other systems disappeared during the 1990s and 2000s{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}.

It was directed by the cartographer and mathematician [[Martin Hotine]], head of the Trigonometrical and Levelling Division.\n\nErecting new trig points and making measurements frequently required materials and instruments to be carried on foot, up hills and mountains and to isolated islands, in all kinds of weather. The network of trig points was built and measured between 1936 and 1962, starting with a set of several hundred primary trig points, most of which were placed on high hills so as to be able to link to one another across long distances. In addition, a larger set of roughly six thousand secondary trig points were added to allow the construction of a finer mesh that extended the reference frame of the primary mesh over shorter distances.\n\nThe calculations were constrained; it was hoped to minimise the shifts from the coordinates based on the old triangulation. At eleven primary trig points from [[Dunnose, Isle of Wight|Dunnose]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] (456784 m E, 080150 m N) north to [[Great Whernside]] in Yorkshire (400202 E, 473904 N) the new lat-lons were adjusted to stay within a metre of the old ones. Once the new Latitude and Longitude of those eleven points were fixed the calculated location of every other point in the triangulation was based on them. By the time the retriangulation was completed, [[electronic distance measurement]] devices had come into use which could have greatly reduced the overall error (it now seems Great Britain is 20+ metres shorter than OSGB36 implies<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>) but starting over from scratch was out of the question<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book\n|ref= harv |year=1967\n|first=\n|last=Ordnance Survey\n|first2=\n|last2=\n|title=The history of the retriangulation of Great Britain 1935-1962\n|publisher=London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office\n|location=|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/ebooks/history-retriangulation-great-britain-1935-1962.pdf\n|oclc=\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|ref= harv  |year=1992\n|first=Tim\n|last=Owen\n|first2=Elaine\n|last2=Pilbeam\n|title=Ordnance Survey, map makers to Britain since 1791\n|page=\n|publisher=Ordnance Survey (HMSO)\n|location=Southampton\n|isbn=9780319002490\n|url=\n|oclc=28220563\n|postscript =  .

They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines.  Definition 10 does not use numerical degree measurements but rather touches at the very heart of what a right angle is, namely two straight lines intersecting to form two equal and adjacent angles.<ref>Heath p. 181</ref>  The straight lines which form right angles are called perpendicular.<ref>Heath p. 181</ref>  Euclid uses right angles in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those smaller than a right angle) and obtuse angles (those greater than a right angle).<ref>Heath p. 181</ref> Two angles are called [[Complementary angles|complementary]] if their sum is a right angle.<ref>Wentworth p. 9</ref>\n\nBook 1 Postulate 4 states that all right angles are equal, which allows Euclid to use a right angle as a unit to measure other angles with. Euclid's commentator [[Proclus]] gave a proof of this postulate using the previous postulates, but it may be argued that this proof makes use of some hidden assumptions. [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri|Saccheri]] gave a proof as well but using a more explicit assumption. In [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert's axioms|axiomatization of geometry]] this statement is given as a theorem, but only after much groundwork. One may argue that, even if postulate 4 can be proven from the preceding ones, in the order that Euclid presents his material it is necessary to include it since without it postulate 5, which uses the right angle as a unit of measure, makes no sense.<ref>Heath pp. 200-201 for the paragraph</ref>\n\n== Conversion to other units ==\nA right angle may be expressed in different units:\n* {{sfrac|1|4}} [[turn (geometry)|turn]]\n* 90° ([[Degree (angle)|degrees]])\n* {{sfrac|π|2}} [[radian]]s or {{sfrac|τ|4}} rad\n* 100 [[Grad (angle)|grad]] (also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'')\n* 8 points (of a 32-point [[compass rose]])\n* 6 hours (astronomical [[hour angle]])\n\n== Rule of 3-4-5 ==\nThroughout history, carpenters and masons have known a quick way to confirm if an angle is a true \"right angle\". It is based on the most widely known [[Pythagorean triple]] {{nowrap|(3, 4, 5)}} and so called the \"rule of 3-4-5\". From the angle in question, running a straight line along one side exactly 3 units in length, and along the second side exactly 4 units in length, will create a [[hypotenuse]] (the longer line opposite the right angle that connects the two measured endpoints) of exactly 5 units in length. This measurement can be made quickly and without technical instruments. The geometric law behind the measurement is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (\"The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides\").\n\n== Thales' theorem ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01-Rechter Winkel mittels Thaleskreis.gif\n| width1 = 254 \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Construction of the perpendicular to the half-line h from the point P (applicable not only at the end point A, M is freely selectable), animation at the end with pause 10 s\n| image2 = 01-Rechter Winkel mittels Thaleskreis-II.gif\n| width2 = 237\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =  Alternative construction if P outside of the half-line h and the distance A to P' is small (B is freely selectable),<br>animation at the end with pause 10 s\n| footer = \n}}\n{{main|Thales' theorem}}\n\nThales' theorem states that an angle inscribed in a [[semicircle]] (with a vertex on the semicircle and its defining rays going through the endpoints of the semicircle) is a right angle.\n\nTwo application examples in which the right angle and the Thales' theorem are included (see animations).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Right angles}}\n*[[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n*[[Orthogonality]]\n*[[Perpendicular]]\n*[[Rectangle]]\n*[[Angle#Types of angles|Types of angles]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book |title=A Text-Book of Geometry|first=G.A.|last=Wentworth\n|publisher=Ginn & Co.|year=1895|\nurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyUAAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n*Euclid, commentary and trans. by [[T.

Both right ascension and longitude measure an angle from a primary direction (a zero point) on an [[equator]]. Right ascension is measured from the Sun at the [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|March equinox]] i.e. the [[First Point of Aries]], which is the place on the [[celestial sphere]] where the Sun crosses the [[celestial equator]] from south to north at the March [[equinox]] and is currently located in the [[Pisces (constellation)|constellation Pisces]]. Right ascension is measured continuously in a full circle from that alignment of Earth and Sun in space, that equinox, the measurement increasing towards the east.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s_o4AAAAMAAJ\n|title=An Introduction to Astronomy\n|last=Moulton\n|first=Forest Ray\n|date=1916\n|publisher=Macmillan Co., New York\n|pages=125–126\n}}</ref>\n\nAs seen from Earth (except at the poles), objects noted to have 12{{Abbreviation|<sup>h</sup> RA|Hours right ascension}} are longest visible (appear throughout the night) at the March equinox; those with 0{{Abbreviation|<sup>h</sup> RA|hours right ascension}} (apart from the sun) do so at the September equinox. On those dates at midnight, such objects will reach (\"culminate\" at) their highest point (their meridian). How high depends on their declination; if 0° declination (i.e. on the [[celestial equator]]) then at Earth's equator they are directly overhead (at zenith).\n\nAny units of angular measure could have been chosen for right ascension, but it is customarily measured in hours (<sup>h</sup>), minutes (<sup>m</sup>), and seconds (<sup>s</sup>), with 24<sup>h</sup> being equivalent to a full circle. Astronomers have chosen this unit to measure right ascension because they measure a star's location by timing its passage through the highest point in the sky as the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]]. The line which passes through the highest point in the sky, called the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], is the projection of a longitude line onto the celestial sphere. Since a complete circle contains 24<sup>h</sup> of right ascension or 360° ([[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]]), {{sfrac|1|24}} of a circle is measured as 1<sup>h</sup> of right ascension, or 15°; {{sfrac|1|24×60}} of a circle is measured as 1<sup>m</sup> of right ascension, or [[arcminute|15 minutes of arc]] (also written as 15′); and {{sfrac|1|24×60×60}} of a circle contains 1<sup>s</sup> of right ascension, or [[arcsecond|15 seconds of arc]] (also written as 15″). A full circle, measured in right-ascension units, contains {{nobr|24 × 60 × 60 {{=}} {{val|86400}}<sup>s</sup>}}, or {{nobr|24 × 60 {{=}} {{val|1440|fmt=gaps}}<sup>m</sup>}}, or 24<sup>h</sup>.<ref>Moulton (1916), p. 126.</ref>\n\n{{see also|Hour angle}}\n\nBecause right ascensions are measured in hours (of [[Earth's rotation|rotation of the Earth]]), they can be used\nto time the positions of objects in the sky. For example, if a star with RA&nbsp;= {{nowrap|1<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> 00<sup>s</sup>}} is at its meridian, then a star with RA&nbsp;= {{nowrap|20<sup>h</sup> 00<sup>m</sup> 00<sup>s</sup>}} will be on the/at its meridian (at its apparent highest point) 18.5 [[Sidereal time|sidereal hours]] later.\n\nSidereal hour angle, used in [[celestial navigation]], is similar to right ascension, but increases westward rather than eastward. Usually measured in degrees (°), it is the complement of right ascension with respect to 24<sup>h</sup>.<ref>\n''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), p. 11.</ref>\nIt is important not to confuse sidereal hour angle with the astronomical concept of [[hour angle]], which measures angular distance of an object westward from the local [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].\n\n==Symbols and abbreviations==\n{|cellpadding=1 cellspacing=0 class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Unit !! scope=\"col\" | Value !! scope=\"col\" | Symbol !! scope=\"col\" | [[Sexagesimal]] system !! scope=\"col\" | In radians\n|-\n!

This movement, known as [[Axial precession|precession]], causes the coordinates of stationary celestial objects to change continuously, if rather slowly.  Therefore, [[Equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]] (including right ascension) are inherently relative to the year of their observation, and astronomers specify them with reference to a particular year, known as an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. Coordinates from different epochs must be mathematically rotated to match each other, or to match a standard epoch.<ref>\nMoulton (1916), pp. 92–95.</ref> Right ascension for \"fixed stars\" near the ecliptic and equator increases by about 3.05 seconds per year on average, or 5.1 minutes per century, but for fixed stars further from the ecliptic the rate of change can be anything from negative infinity to positive infinity. The right ascension of [[Polaris]] is increasing quickly. The [[North Ecliptic Pole]] in [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] and the [[South Ecliptic Pole]] in [[Dorado]] are always at right ascension 18<sup>h</sup> and 6<sup>h</sup> respectively.\n\nThe currently used standard epoch is [[J2000.0]], which is January 1, 2000 at 12:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]. The prefix \"J\" indicates that it is a [[Julian epoch]]. Prior to J2000.0, astronomers used the successive [[Epoch (astronomy)#Besselian epoch|Besselian epochs]] B1875.0, B1900.0, and B1950.0.<ref>\nsee, for instance,\n{{cite book\n | author1 = U.S. Naval Observatory Nautical Almanac Office\n | author2 = U.K. Hydrographic Office\n | author3 = H.M.

Ancient astronomy was very concerned with the rise and set of celestial objects. The ''ascension'' was the point on the [[celestial equator]] (red) which rose or set at the same time as an object (green) on the [[celestial sphere]]. As seen from the equator, both were on a [[great circle]] from pole to pole (left, ''sphaera recta'' or right sphere). From almost anywhere else, they were not (center, ''sphaera obliqua'' or oblique sphere). At the poles, objects did not rise or set (right, ''sphaera parallela'' or parallel sphere). An object's right ascension was its ascension on a right sphere.<ref>Bleau (1668), p. 40–41.</ref>]]\n\nThe concept of right ascension has been known at least as far back as [[Hipparchus]] who measured stars in equatorial coordinates in the 2nd century BC. But Hipparchus and his successors made their [[star catalog]]s in [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]], and the use of RA was limited to special cases.\n\nWith the invention of the [[telescope]], it became possible for astronomers to observe celestial objects in greater detail, provided that the telescope could be kept pointed at the object for a period of time. The easiest way to do that is to use an [[equatorial mount]], which allows the telescope to be aligned with one of its two pivots parallel to the Earth's axis.  A motorized clock drive often is used with an equatorial mount to cancel out the [[Earth's rotation]]. As the equatorial mount became widely adopted for observation, the equatorial coordinate system, which includes right ascension, was adopted at the same time for simplicity. Equatorial mounts could then be accurately pointed at objects with known right ascension and declination by the use of [[setting circles]]. The first star catalog to use right ascension and declination was [[John Flamsteed]]'s ''[[Historia Coelestis Britannica]]'' (1712, 1725).\n{{-}}\n[[File:Stars and ra.png|thumb|500px|center|The entire sky, divided into two halves.

To draw an angle, compasses describe an arc from origin with a radius taken from the 60 mark.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenographic_coordinates",
      "text": "[[Image:Moon-map.png|thumb|400px]]\n\n'''Selenographic coordinates''' are used to refer to locations on the surface of [[Earth]]'s [[moon]]. Any position on the lunar surface can be referenced by specifying two numerical values, which are comparable to the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of Earth. The longitude gives the position east or west of the Moon's prime meridian, which is the line  passing from the [[lunar north pole]] through the point on the lunar surface directly facing Earth to the [[lunar south pole]].  (See also [[prime meridian|Earth's prime meridian]].)  This can be thought of as the midpoint of the visible Moon as seen from the Earth. The latitude gives the position north or south of the lunar [[equator]]. Both of these coordinates are given in [[degree (angle)|degrees]].\n\nAstronomers defined the fundamental location in the selenographic coordinate system by the small, bowl-shaped satellite crater '[[Mösting (crater)|Mösting&nbsp;A]]'{{citation needed|reason=Probably wrong. See: https://the-moon.wikispaces.com/Selenographic+Coordinates|date=September 2015}}. The coordinates of this crater are defined as:\n\n:{| border=\"0\"\n|''Latitude:''\n|3°&nbsp;12'&nbsp;43.2\" South\n|-\n|''Longitude:''\n|5°&nbsp;12'&nbsp;39.6\" West\n|}\n\nThe coordinate system has become precisely defined due to the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]].\n\nAnything past 90°E or 90°W would not be seen from Earth, except for [[libration]], which makes [[Moon#Two sides of the Moon|59% of the Moon visible]].\n\n== Selenographic colongitude ==\nThe '''selenographic colongitude''' is the longitude of the morning [[Lunar terminator|terminator on the Moon]], as measured in degrees westward from the prime meridian. The morning terminator forms a half-circle across the Moon where the Sun is just starting to rise. As the Moon continues in its orbit, this line advances in longitude. The value of the selenographic colongitude increases from 0° to 359° in the direction of the advancing terminator.\n\nSunrise occurs at the prime meridian when the [[Lunar phase]] reaches First Quarter, after one fourth of a [[lunar day]]. At this location the selenographic colongitude at sunrise is defined as 0°. Thus, by the time of the [[Full Moon]] the colongitude increases to 90°; at Last Quarter it is 180°, and at the [[New Moon]] the colongitude reaches 270°.  Note that the Moon is nearly invisible from the Earth at New Moon phase except during a [[solar eclipse]].\n\nThe low [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of arriving sunlight tends to pick out features by the sharp shadows they cast, thus the area near the terminator is usually the most favorable for viewing or [[photograph]]ing lunar features through a [[telescope]]. The observer will need to know the location of the terminator to plan observations of selected features. The selenographic colongitude is useful for this purpose.\n\nThe selenographic longitude of the evening terminator is equal to the colongitude plus 180°.<ref name=\"ruklcolpres\">[[Antonín Rükl]]: ''Atlas Měsíce'', Aventinum (Praha 1991), chapter Tabulky pro výpočet hodnoty colongitudo, page 212, {{ISBN|80-85277-10-7}} {{cs icon}}</ref>\n\n== Longitude ==\n\nLongitude on the Moon is measured both east and west from its [[prime meridian]]. When no direction is specified, east is positive and west is negative.\n\nRoughly speaking, the Moon's prime meridian lies near the center of the Moon's disc as seen from Earth. For precise applications, many coordinate systems have been defined for the Moon, each with a slightly different prime meridian.
