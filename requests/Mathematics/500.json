Inspired as a boy to be an explorer after reading books about [[Sven Hedin]] that his mother Elsa Götsch had given to him, the young Kähler soon focused his passion for exploration on astronomy. He is said to have written a 50-page thesis on fractional differentiation while still in high school, hoping that it would earn him a PhD. His teachers replied that he would have to attend university courses first.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kahler.html|title=Kahler biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n\nKähler enrolled in the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1924. He read [[Galois theory]], met the mathematician [[Emil Artin]], and did research under the supervision of [[Leon Lichtenstein]]. Still fascinated by celestial mechanics, Kähler wrote a dissertation entitled, \"On the existence of equilibrium solutions of rotating liquids, which are derived from certain solutions of the n-body problem\", and received his doctorate in 1928.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=47619|title=The Mathematics Genealogy Project - Erich Kähler|website=www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref> He continued his studies at Leipzig for the following year, supported by fellowship from the [[Deutsche_Forschungsgemeinschaft#Background|Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaften]], except for a research assistantship at the [[Albertus-Universität Königsberg|University of Königsberg]] in 1929. In 1930 Kähler joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Hamburg to work under the direction of [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], writing a [[habilitation]] thesis entitled, \"About the integrals of algebraic equations\". He took a year in Rome to work with Italian geometers including Enriques, [[Guido Castelnuovo|Castelnuovo]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]], [[Francesco Severi|Severi]], and [[Beniamino Segre|Segre]] in 1931-1932,<ref name=\":0\" /> which led him to publish his acclaimed work on what are now called Kähler metrics in 1932.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kähler|first=Erich|date=1933-12-01|title=Über eine bemerkenswerte Hermitesche Metrik|journal=Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg|language=de|volume=9|issue=1|pages=173–186|doi=10.1007/BF02940642|issn=0025-5858}}</ref> Kähler returned to Hamburg after his year in Rome, where he continued to work until going to the [[University of Königsberg|University of Konigsberg]] in 1935, and was offered an ordinary professorship a year later. In 1938 he married his first wife Luise Günther.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the years leading up to [[World War II]] Kähler was a supporter of Hitler and of German nationalism, and reported that he volunteered for the German military in 1935, joined the navy in 1937, and the army on 24 August 1939 before the invasion of Poland.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GC7aBAAAQBAJ|title=Mathematicians under the Nazis|last=Segal|first=Sanford L.|date=2014-11-23|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400865383|language=en}}</ref> After being stationed at the [[Saint-Nazaire submarine base|Saint-Nazaire]] submarine base in German [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupied France]] towards the end of the war, Kähler was captured by the Allies and taken to the prisoner of war camp at [[Île de Ré|Ile de Ré]], and then to another camp in [[Mulsanne]]. Thanks to the French mathematicians [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frederic Joliot-Curie]] and [[Élie Cartan]], Kähler was able to study mathematics during this time, receiving books and mathematics papers and working during his imprisonment. He was released in 1947.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://cs.unitbv.ro/~acami/kaehler.htm|title=ERICH KÄHLER|website=cs.unitbv.ro|access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref> He reported that his oath to Hitler (as a civil servant) was important to him, and remained an apologist for the Third Reich decades later, in a 1988 interview with Sanford Segal.<ref name=\":2\" /> A former student reported in 1988 that he kept a Nazi navy flag in his office.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAfter his release as a prisoner of war Kähler returned to the University of Hamburg to take up a temporary lectureship. He accepted a professorship in 1948 at his alma mater the University of Leipzig, filling a post that had been left open by the death of [[Paul Koebe]] in 1945. But in this same year, Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative in the region to German communist leaders, and from October 1949 the region was a part of newly-formed [[East Germany]]. Kähler became increasingly unhappy with life in East Germany over the next decade, finally deciding to leave in 1958 to take up a lectureship at the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. There he was heralded as among the greatest living mathematicians, and his lectures overflowed with 600 students from engineering and the sciences.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkGoPd1QX4oC|title=Mathematische Werke / Mathematical Works|last=Kähler|first=Erich|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110905434|location=|pages=8|language=de|via=}}</ref> In 1964 he returned to the University of Hamburg to fill the post that opened when [[Emil Artin|Artin]] died in 1962. His wife Luise became ill and died in 1970, and Kähler married his second wife Charlotte Schulze, who was the widow of his brother who had died in the war. Kähler remained at the University of Hamburg until his retirement in 1974.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter retiring Kähler remained an active researcher, writing a number of important papers on the foundations of physics and the Poincaré group, as well as a number of philosophical papers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Contributions==\nAs a mathematician Kähler is known for a number of contributions: the [[Cartan&ndash;Kähler theorem]] on solutions of non-linear analytic differential systems; the idea of a [[Kähler metric]] on [[complex manifold]]s; and the [[Kähler differentials]], which provide a purely algebraic theory and have generally been adopted in [[algebraic geometry]]. In all of these the theory of [[differential form]]s plays a part, and Kähler counts as a major developer of the theory from its formal genesis with [[Élie Cartan]].\n\n[[Kähler manifold]]s &mdash; [[complex manifold]]s endowed with a [[Riemannian metric]] and a [[symplectic form]] so that the three structures are mutually compatible &mdash; are named after him.\n\nThe [[K3 surface]] is named after [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]], Kähler, and [[Kunihiko Kodaira|Kodaira]].\n\nHis earlier work was on [[celestial mechanics]]; and he was one of the forerunners of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] theory, though his ideas on that were never widely adopted.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Almost complex manifold]]\n*[[Hyper-Kähler manifold]]\n*[[Kähler&ndash;Einstein metric]]\n*[[Quaternion-Kähler manifold]]\n*[[Complex Poisson manifold]]\n*[[Special Kähler geometry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.worldwhoswho.com/views/entry.html?id=kah-0033 KÄHLER, Erich Ernst] International Who's Who. accessed September 3, 2006.\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=47619}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kahler, Erich}}\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:2000 deaths]]\n[[Category:German mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometers]]\n[[Category:People from Leipzig]]\n[[Category:People from the Kingdom of Saxony]]\n[[Category:University of Königsberg alumni]]\n[[Category:Leipzig University alumni]]\n[[Category:Leipzig University faculty]]\n[[Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]]"

Her doctoral work was on the [[topology]] of [[algebraic curves]].\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nMargarete Kahn was the daughter of [[Eschwege]] merchant and [[flannel]] factory owner Albert Kahn (1853–1905) and his wife Johanne (née Plaut, 1857–1882). She had an older brother Otto (born 1879). Five years after the untimely death of his wife Johanne, their father married her younger sister Julie (1860–1934), with whom he had a daughter, Margaret's half-sister Martha (born 1888).<ref name=\"yek\">{{cite journal |last=König |first=York-Egbert  |date=January 4, 2009 |title=Ein Leben für die Mathematik – Vor 90 Jahren legte Grete Kahn als erste Eschwegerin die Doktorprüfung ab |language=de |trans-title=A life for mathematics – 90 years ago Grete Kahn was the first woman from Eschwege to earn a doctorate |url=http://www.vhghessen.de/mhg/2009_nf50/2009_01_041.htm |journal= |publisher=vghessen.de |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter attending elementary school from 1887, and the Higher School for Girls from 1889 to 1896, Kahn until 1904 took private lessons to prepare for her ''[[Abitur]]'', because few high schools for girls existed at that time in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. In 1904 she was given permission to take her ''Abitur'' at the Royal ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Bad Hersfeld]]. Thus she belonged to the small elite of young women in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century who were allowed to take the ''Abitur'' externally at boys' schools. [[Konrad Duden]] signed her ''Abitur'' certificate as school principal.\n\nSince [[Prussia]] began to allow women to formally attend university only from the winter semester of 1908–09, Kahn and her friend [[Klara Löbenstein]] first attended the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] as guest students. In addition, Kahn attended lectures and tutorials in mathematics at the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. They studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[propaedeutics]] at [[Berlin]] and [[Göttingen]]. At the University of Göttingen she attended lectures given by, among others, [[David Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Woldemar Voigt]], and [[Georg Elias Müller]]; in Berlin she attended lectures by [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz]] and [[Paul Drude]] at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. Her field of expertise was [[algebraic geometry]]. Together with Löbenstein she made a contribution to [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]].<ref name=\"yek\" /> Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of [[Algebraic curve#Complex curves and realsurfaces|algebraic curves in the complex projective plane]]; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no [[List of curves#Degree 6|algebraic curves of degree 6]] consisting of 11 separate ovals. Kahn and Löbenstein developed methods to address this problem.\n\nAgainst opposition in particular from the Berlin faculty, but supported by the University of Göttingen and Felix Klein, Kahn obtained a doctorate in 1909 under David Hilbert in Göttingen, with a dissertation titled ''Eine allgemeine Methode zur Untersuchung der Gestalten algebraischer Kurven'' [A general method to investigate the shapes of algebraic curves] and was therefore one of the first German women to obtain a doctorate in mathematics (the mathematics division was part of the faculty of philosophy then). She took her oral examination – again, along with Löbenstein – on June 30, 1909.\n\nKahn could not pursue a scientific career because women in Germany were not admitted to [[habilitation]] before 1920. She therefore sought a career as a schoolteacher, and in October 1912 she obtained a job in the Prussian school system, where she worked as a teacher for secondary schools in [[Katowice]], [[Dortmund]], and from 1929, in [[Berlin-Tegel]].\n\nAs a [[Jew]], she was forced to go on leave by the [[Nazi]]s in 1933, and was dismissed from the school in 1936. She was [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced to work]] as a factory worker at the ''Nordland Schneeketten'' (Nordland snow chains) factory. On 28 March 1942, Kahn was deported to Piaski and is considered missing since then.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gottwaldt |first1=Alfred |last2=Schulle |first2=Diana |year=2005 |title=Die \"Judendeportationen\" aus dem Deutschen Reich von 1941–1945 – eine kommentierte Chronologie |trans-title=The \"deportation of Jews\" from the [[German Reich]] from 1941–1945: An annotated chronology |url= |language=de |location=[[Wiesbaden]] |isbn=978-3865390592 |pages=188 }}</ref>\n\nOn 13  September 2008, a ''[[Stolperstein]]'' was laid at 127 ''Rudolstädter Straße'' in [[Wilmersdorf]] in memory of Margaret Kahn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/bezirk/lexikon/rudolstaedter_127.html |title=Stolperstein Rudolstädter Str. 127|language=de |trans-title=|date=September 13, 2008 |website=berlin.de |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, a street in [[Leverkusen]] was named after her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leverkusen.com/strasse/index.php?view=Kahn |title=Grete-Kahn-Str. |language=de |year=2013 |website=leverkusen.com |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Stolperstein Rudolstädter Str 127 (Wilmd) Margarete Kahn.jpg|thumb|''[[Stolperstein]]'' at 127 ''Rudolstädter Straße'' in [[Wilmersdorf]], in memory of Margarete Kahn]]\n\n== Publications ==\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Kahn |first=Margarete |year=1909 |title=Eine allgemeine Methode zur Untersuchung der Gestalten algebraischer Kurven |language=de |trans-title=A general method for the study of the forms of algebraic curves |url= |journal=Doctoral Dissertation, University of Göttingen |publisher=W.

After that, at Princeton, he was an instructor, an assistant professor in 1968, associate professor in 1971 and professor in 1974. From 2002 to 2005 he was the chairman of faculty there. He was also a visiting scholar at the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Kyoto]], [[University of Pierre and Marie Curie|Paris VI]], [[Paris-Sud 11 University|Orsay]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|IHES]]. While in France, he adapted methods of [[scheme theory]] and [[category theory]] to the theory of [[modular form]]s. Subsequently, he has applied geometric methods to various [[exponential sum]]s.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1969, he was a NATO Postdoctoral Fellow, from 1975 to 1976 and from 1987–1988 [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and from 1971 to 1972 [[Sloan Fellow]]. In 1978 he was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Helsinki]] (''p-adic L functions, Serre-Tate local moduli and ratios of solutions of differential equations'') and 1970 in Nice (''The regularity theorem in algebraic geometry'').\n\nSince 2003 he is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and since 2004 the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. In 2003 he was awarded with [[Peter Sarnak]] the [[Levi L.

Since 2004 he is an editor of the ''Annals of Mathematics''.\n\nHe played a significant role as a sounding-board for [[Andrew Wiles]] when Wiles was developing in secret his proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]]. Mathematician and [[cryptographer]] [[Neal Koblitz]] was one of Katz's students.\n\nKatz studied, with Sarnak among others, the connection of the eigenvalue distribution of large random matrices of classical groups to the distribution of the distances of the zeros of various ''L'' and zeta functions in algebraic geometry. He also studied trigonometric sums ([[Gauss sum]]s) with algebro-geometric methods.\n\nHe introduced the [[Katz–Lang finiteness theorem]].\n\n== Writings ==\n* ''Gauss sums, Kloosterman sums, and monodromy groups.''

He was an Assistant at the [[University of Mannheim]] from 1977 to 1979 and a [[Miller Research Fellows|Miller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1981 to 1983. Kawamata is now a professor at the University of Tokyo. He won the Mathematical Society of Japan Autumn award (1988) and the Japan Academy of Sciences award (1990) for his work in algebraic geometry.\n\n==Research==\nKawamata was involved in the development of the [[minimal model program]] in the 1980s. The program aims to show that every [[algebraic variety]] is [[birational geometry|birational]] to one of an especially simple type: either a minimal model or a Fano fiber space. The [[Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem]], strengthening the [[Kodaira vanishing theorem]], is a method. Building on that, Kawamata proved the basepoint-free theorem. The cone theorem and contraction theorem, central results in the theory, are the result of a joint effort by Kawamata, [[Janos Kollar|Kollár]], [[Shigefumi Mori|Mori]], [[Miles Reid|Reid]], and [[Vyacheslav Shokurov|Shokurov]].<ref>Y. Kawamata, K. Matsuda, and K. Matsuki. Introduction to the minimal model program. ''Algebraic Geometry, Sendai 1985''. North-Holland (1987), 283-360.</ref>\n\nAfter Mori proved the existence of minimal models in dimension 3 in 1988, Kawamata and [[Yoichi Miyaoka|Miyaoka]] clarified the structure of minimal models by proving the [[abundance conjecture]] in dimension 3.<ref>Y. Kawamata. Abundance theorem for minimal threefolds. Invent.

Kawamata. Kodaira dimension of algebraic fiber spaces over curves. Invent.

He graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1938 with a degree in mathematics and also graduated from the physics department at the University of Tokyo in 1941. During the [[World War II|war]] years he worked in isolation, but was able to master [[Hodge theory]] as it then stood.  He obtained his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1949, with a thesis entitled ''Harmonic fields in Riemannian manifolds''. He was involved in cryptographic work from about 1944, while holding an academic post in Tokyo.\n\n== Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University ==\nIn 1949 he travelled to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] at the invitation of [[Hermann Weyl]]. He was subsequently also appointed Associate Professor at [[Princeton University]] in 1952 and promoted to Professor in 1955.  At this time the foundations of Hodge theory were being brought in line with contemporary technique in operator theory. Kodaira rapidly became involved in exploiting the tools it opened up in algebraic geometry, adding [[sheaf theory]] as it became available. This work was particularly influential, for example on [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]].\n\nIn a second research phase, Kodaira wrote a long series of papers in collaboration with [[Donald C. Spencer]], founding the [[deformation theory]] of complex structures on manifolds. This gave the possibility of constructions of [[moduli space]]s, since in general such structures depend continuously on parameters. It also identified the sheaf cohomology groups, for the sheaf associated with the [[holomorphic tangent bundle]], that carried the basic data about the dimension of the moduli space, and obstructions to deformations. This theory is still foundational, and also had an influence on the (technically very different) [[scheme theory]] of [[Grothendieck]]. Spencer then continued this work, applying the techniques to structures other than complex ones, such as [[G-structure]]s.\n\nIn a third major part of his work, Kodaira worked again from around 1960 through the [[classification of algebraic surfaces]] from the point of view of [[birational geometry]] of complex manifolds. This resulted in a typology of seven kinds of two-dimensional compact complex manifolds, recovering the five algebraic types known classically; the other two being non-algebraic. He provided also detailed studies of [[elliptic fibration]]s of surfaces over a curve, or in other language [[elliptic curve]]s over [[algebraic function field]]s, a theory whose arithmetic analogue proved important soon afterwards. This work also included a characterisation of [[K3 surface]]s as deformations of [[quartic surface]]s in ''P''<sup>4</sup>, and the theorem that they form a single [[diffeomorphism]] class. Again, this work has proved foundational.  (The K3 surfaces were named after [[Ernst Kummer]], [[Erich Kähler]], and Kodaira).\n\n==Later years==\nKodaira left Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961, and briefly served as chair at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Stanford University]].  In 1967, returned to the [[University of Tokyo]]. He was awarded a [[Wolf Prize]] in 1984/5. He died in [[Kofu]] on 26 July 1997.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation | last1=Morrow | first1=James | last2=Kodaira | first2=Kunihiko | title=Complex manifolds | origyear=1971 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=082184055X | publisher=AMS Chelsea Publishing, Providence, RI | isbn=978-0-8218-4055-9 | year=2006 | mr=0302937}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Kodaira | first1=Kunihiko | editor1-last=Baily | editor1-first=Walter L. | title=Kunihiko Kodaira: collected works | publisher=Iwanami Shoten, Publishers, Tokyo; Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.  | isbn=978-0-691-08158-8 | year=1975 | volume=I | mr=0366598}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Kodaira | first1=Kunihiko | editor1-last=Baily | editor1-first=Walter L. | title=Kunihiko Kodaira: collected works | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9vuAAAAMAAJ | publisher=Iwanami Shoten, Publishers, Tokyo; Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. | isbn=978-0-691-08163-2 | year=1975 | volume=II | mr=0366599}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Kodaira | first1=Kunihiko | editor1-last=Baily | editor1-first=Walter L. | title=Kunihiko Kodaira: collected works | publisher=Iwanami Shoten, Publishers, Tokyo; Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. | isbn=978-0-691-08164-9 | year=1975 | volume=III | mr=0366600}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Kodaira | first1=Kunihiko | title=Complex manifolds and deformation of complex structures | origyear=1981 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540226141 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Classics in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-22614-7 | id=[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183553844 review] by [[Andrew J.

His thesis outlines a proof of a conjecture by [[Edward Witten]] that two [[Quantum gravity|quantum gravitational models]] are equivalent.\n\nHis work concentrates on geometric aspects of [[mathematical physics]], most notably on [[knot theory]], [[quantization (physics)|quantization]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].  One of his results is a formal [[Quantization (physics)|deformation quantization]] that holds for any [[Poisson manifold]].  He also introduced knot invariants defined by complicated integrals analogous to [[path integral formulation|Feynman integrals]]. In [[topological field theory]], he introduced the [[stable map|moduli space of stable maps]], which may be considered a mathematically rigorous formulation of the [[path integral formulation|Feynman integral]] for topological string theory.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nIn 1998, he won the [[Fields Medal]] for his \"contributions to four problems of Geometry\".

He is emeritus professor at [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\nLazard was born in [[Carpentras]]. He began his academic career by working in [[commutative algebra]], especially on [[flat module]]s.  Around 1970, he began to work in [[computer algebra]], which, soon after, became his main research area. In this field, he is specially interested in [[multivariate polynomial]]s and more generally in [[algebraic geometry#Computational algebraic geometry|computational algebraic geometry]], with emphasis on [[systems of polynomial equations|polynomial system solving]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\nD.

As a consequence, one can deduce that every finitely-presented flat module is projective. (See [[flat module#Categorical colimits]])\n* In computer algebra, the [[resultant]] of two polynomials can be used to analyze modular images of the greatest common divisor of integer polynomials where the coefficients are taken modulo some prime number ''p''. The resultant of two polynomials is frequently computed in the Lazard-Rioboo-Trager method of finding the integral of a ratio of polynomials.\n* {{harvtxt|Lazard|1992}} introduced the ''lextriangular algorithm'' to obtain the [[triangular decomposition]] of a polynomial system.

Zassenhaus had conjectured that every semisimple [[Lie algebra]] ''L'' over a field of prime characteristic, with [''L'', ''L''] = ''L'', is the direct sum of simple ideals. Matsushima constructed a counterexample. He then developed a proof that Cartan subalgebras of a complex Lie algebra are conjugate. However, Japanese researchers were out of touch with the research done in the West, and Matsushima was unaware that [[France|French]] mathematician [[Claude Chevalley]] had already published a proof. When he obtained details of another paper of Chevalley through a review in Mathematical Reviews, he was able to construct the proofs for himself.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/>\n\nMatsushima published two papers in the 1947 volume of the Proceedings of the Japan Academy (which did not appear until 1950) and three papers in the first volume of Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/>\n\n==Professorship==\nMatsushima became a full professor at Nagoya University in 1953. Chevalley visited Matsushima in Nagoya in 1953 and invited him to spend the following year in France. He went to France in 1954 and returned to Nagoya in December 1955. He also spent time at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He presented some of his results to Ehresmann's seminar in Strasbourg, extending Cartan's classification of complex irreducible Lie algebras to the case of real Lie algebras.<ref name=\"MacTutor\"/>\n\nIn spring 1960, Matsushima became a professor of Osaka University as successor to the chair of Shoda.<ref name=\"Yozô Matsushima\"/> His research took a somewhat different direction and he wrote a series of papers on cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, collaborating with Murakami. He went to the Institute for Advanced Study in September 1962 and returned to Osaka after one year. He jointly began to organize the United States-Japan Seminar in Differential Geometry, which was held in Kyoto in June 1965. After this, he went to France and spent the academic year 1965-66 as visiting professor at the University of Grenoble. He accepted a chair at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]] in September 1966.<ref name=\"Yozô Matsushima\"/> He continued to collaborate with Murakami. He introduced [[Matsushima's formula]] for the Betti numbers of quotients of symmetric spaces.

He won the [[Fields Medal]] and was a [[MacArthur Fellow]]. In 2010 he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]]. He is currently a University Professor Emeritus in the Division of Applied Mathematics at [[Brown University]].\n\n==Early life==\nMumford was born in [[Worth, West Sussex]] in [[England]], of an English father and American mother. His father William started an experimental school in [[Tanzania]] and worked for the then newly created [[United Nations]].<ref name=fml>{{cite book|title=Fields Medallists' Lectures, World Scientific Series in 20th Century Mathematics, Vol 5|date=1997|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9810231170|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6eSjV-0egUC&pg=PA225}}</ref>\n\nIn high school, he was a finalist in the prestigious [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]]. After attending the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], Mumford went to Harvard, where he became a student of [[Oscar Zariski]]. At Harvard, he became a [[Putnam Fellow]] in 1955 and 1956. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1961, with a thesis entitled ''Existence of the moduli scheme for curves of any genus''.\n\n==Work in algebraic geometry==\nMumford's work in geometry combined traditional geometric insights with the latest algebraic techniques. He published on [[moduli space]]s, with a theory summed up in his book ''[[Geometric Invariant Theory]]'', on the equations defining an [[abelian variety]], and on [[algebraic surface]]s.\n\nHis books ''Abelian Varieties'' (with [[C. P. Ramanujam]]) and ''Curves on an Algebraic Surface'' combined the old and new theories. His lecture notes on [[scheme theory]] circulated for years in unpublished form, at a time when they were, beside the treatise [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]], the only accessible introduction. They are now available as ''The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes'' ({{isbn|3-540-63293-X}}).\n\nOther work that was less thoroughly written up were lectures on varieties defined by [[quadric]]s, and a study of [[Goro Shimura]]'s papers from the 1960s.\n\nMumford's research did much to revive the classical theory of [[theta function]]s, by showing that its algebraic content was large, and enough to support the main parts of the theory by reference to finite analogues of the [[Heisenberg group]]. This work on the [[equations defining abelian varieties]] appeared in 1966–7. He published some further books of lectures on the theory.\n\nHe also was one of the founders of the [[Toric geometry|toroidal embedding]] theory; and sought to apply the theory to [[Gröbner basis]] techniques, through students who worked in algebraic computation.\n\n==Work on pathologies in algebraic geometry==\nIn a sequence of four papers published in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' between 1961 and 1975, Mumford explored pathological behavior in [[algebraic geometry]], that is, phenomena that would not arise if the world of algebraic geometry were as well-behaved as one might expect from looking at the simplest examples.  These pathologies fall into two types: (a) bad behavior in characteristic p and (b) bad behavior in moduli spaces.\n\n===Characteristic-''p'' pathologies===\nMumford's philosophy in characteristic ''p'' was as follows:\n\n<blockquote>A nonsingular characteristic ''p'' variety is analogous to a general non-Kähler complex manifold;  in particular, a projective embedding of such a variety is not as strong as a [[Kähler metric]] on a complex manifold, and the Hodge–Lefschetz–Dolbeault theorems on [[sheaf cohomology]] break down in every possible way.</blockquote>\n\nIn the first Pathologies paper, Mumford finds an everywhere regular differential form on a smooth projective surface that is not closed, and shows that Hodge symmetry fails for classical [[Enriques surface]]s in characteristic two.  This second example is developed further in Mumford's third paper on classification of surfaces in characteristic ''p'' (written in collaboration with [[E. Bombieri]]).  This pathology can now be explained in terms of the [[Picard scheme]] of the surface, and in particular, its failure to be a [[reduced scheme]], which is a theme developed in Mumford's book \"Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface\".  Worse pathologies related to p-torsion in [[crystalline cohomology]] were explored by [[Luc Illusie]] (Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. (4) 12 (1979), 501–661).\n\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford gives a simple example of a surface in characteristic ''p'' where the [[geometric genus]] is non-zero, but the second Betti number is equal to the rank of the [[Néron–Severi group]]. Further such examples arise in [[Zariski surface]] theory.  He also conjectures that the [[Kodaira vanishing theorem]] is false for surfaces in characteristic ''p''.  In the third paper, he gives an example of a [[Normal variety|normal]] surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails.  The first example of a smooth surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails was given by [[Michel Raynaud]] in 1978.\n\n===Pathologies of moduli spaces===\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford finds that the [[Hilbert scheme]] parametrizing space curves of degree 14 and genus 24 has a multiple component.  In the fourth Pathologies paper, he finds reduced and irreducible complete curves which are not specializations of non-singular curves.\n\nThese sorts of pathologies were considered to be fairly scarce when they first appeared.  But recently, [[Ravi Vakil]] in a paper called \"Murphy's law in algebraic geometry\" has shown that Hilbert schemes of nice geometric objects can be arbitrarily \"bad\", with unlimited numbers of components and with arbitrarily large multiplicities (Invent. Math. 164 (2006), 569–590).\n\n==Classification of surfaces==\n\nIn three papers written between 1969 and 1976 (the last two in collaboration with [[Enrico Bombieri]]), Mumford extended the [[Enriques–Kodaira classification]] of smooth [[projective surface]]s from the case of the complex [[ground field]] to the case of an [[algebraically closed]] ground field of characteristic ''p''.  The final answer turns out to be essentially as the answer in the complex case (though the methods employed are sometimes quite different), once two important adjustments are made.  The first is that one may get \"non-classical\" surfaces, which come about when ''p''-torsion in the [[Picard scheme]] degenerates to a non-reduced group scheme.  The second is the possibility of obtaining [[quasi-elliptic surface]]s in characteristics two and three.  These are surfaces fibred over a curve where the general fibre is a curve of [[arithmetic genus]] one with a cusp.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made, the surfaces are divided into four classes by their [[Kodaira dimension]], as in the complex case.  The four classes are:\na) Kodaira dimension minus infinity.  These are the [[ruled surface]]s.\nb) Kodaira dimension 0.  These are the [[K3 surface]]s, [[abelian surface]]s, hyperelliptic and [[quasi-hyperelliptic surface]]s, and [[Enriques surface]]s.  There are classical and non-classical examples in the last two Kodaira dimension zero cases.\nc) Kodaira dimension 1. These are the elliptic and [[quasi-elliptic surface]]s not contained in the last two groups.\nd) Kodaira dimension 2. These are the [[surfaces of general type]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n[[File:Mumford2.jpg|thumb|220px|David Mumford in 1975]]\nMumford was awarded a [[Fields medal|Fields Medal]] in 1974.

He has been called \"one of the finest mathematicians of the nineteenth century\".<ref>Lederman, p. 69.</ref> He was the father of [[Emmy Noether]].\n\n==Biography==\nMax Noether was born in [[Mannheim]] in 1844, to a [[Jewish family]] of wealthy wholesale hardware dealers. His grandfather, Elias Samuel, had started the business in [[Bruchsal]] in 1797. In 1809 the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] established a \"Tolerance Edict\", which assigned a hereditary surname to the male head of every Jewish family which did not already possess one. Thus the Samuels became the Noether family, and as part of this Christianization of names, their son Hertz (Max's father) became Hermann. Max was the third of five children Hermann had with his wife Amalia Würzburger.<ref>Dick, pp. 4–7.</ref>\n\nAt 14, Max contracted [[polio]] and was afflicted by its effects for the rest of his life. Through [[autodidacticism|self-study]], he learned advanced mathematics and entered the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1865. He served on the faculty there for several years, then moved to the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1888. While there, he helped to found the field of [[algebraic geometry]].<ref name=\"Led6971\">Lederman, pp. 69–71.</ref>\n\nIn 1880 he married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of another wealthy Jewish merchant family. Two years later they had their first child, named Amalia (\"Emmy\") after her mother. [[Emmy Noether]] went on to become a central figure in [[abstract algebra]]. In 1883 they had a son named Alfred, who later studied [[chemistry]] before dying in 1918. Their third child, Fritz, was born in 1884. Like Emmy, [[Fritz Noether]] also found prominence as a mathematician. Little is known about their fourth child, Gustav Robert, born in 1889. He suffered from continual illness and died in 1928.<ref>Dick, pp. 9–45.</ref>\n\nMax Noether served as an ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) at Erlangen for many years, and died there on 13 December 1921.\n\n==Work on algebraic geometry==\n\n[[Alexander von Brill|Brill]] and Max Noether developed alternative proofs using algebraic methods for much of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s work on [[Riemann surface]]s. [[Brill–Noether theory]] went further by estimating the dimension of the space of maps of given degree ''d'' from an [[algebraic curve]] to [[projective space]] '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup>. In [[birational geometry]], Noether introduced the fundamental technique of [[blowing up]] in order to prove [[resolution of singularities]] for plane curves.\n\nMax Noether made major contributions to the theory of [[algebraic surface]]s. [[Noether's formula]] is the first case of the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. The [[Noether inequality]] is one of the main restrictions on the possible discrete invariants of a surface. The Noether-Lefschetz theorem (proved by [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]]) says that the [[Picard group]] of a very general surface of degree at least 4 in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> is generated by the restriction of the [[line bundle]] ''O''(1).\n\nMax Noether and [[Guido Castelnuovo|Castelnuovo]] showed that the [[Cremona group]] of birational automorphisms of the complex projective plane is generated by the \"quadratic transformation\"\n\n: [''x'',''y'',''z''] ↦ [1/''x'', 1/''y'', 1/''z'']\n\ntogether with the group ''PGL''(3,'''C''') of automorphisms of '''P'''<sup>2</sup>. Even today, no explicit generators are known for the group of birational automorphisms of '''P'''<sup>3</sup>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Noether's theorem on rationality for surfaces]]\n*[[Max Noether's theorem (disambiguation)|Max Noether's theorem]] – a list of several theorems\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Auguste Dick|Dick, Auguste]].

In his research on the [[three-body problem]], Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern [[chaos theory]]. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[topology]].\n\nPoincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the [[Lorentz transformations]] in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to [[Hendrik Lorentz]] in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of [[Maxwell's equations]], an important step in the formulation of the theory of [[special relativity]]. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed [[gravitational wave]]s (''ondes gravifiques'') emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe [[Poincaré group]] used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\n\n==Life==\nPoincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] into an influential family.<ref>Belliver, 1956</ref> His father Leon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the [[University of Nancy]].<ref>Sagaret, 1911</ref> His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher [[Emile Boutroux]]. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, [[Raymond Poincaré]], a fellow member of the [[Académie française]], who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.<ref name=\"IEP\">[http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/p/poincare.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Jules Henri Poincaré article by Mauro Murzi&nbsp;– Retrieved November 2006.</ref> \n\n===Education===\n[[File:Henri Poincaré maison natale Nancy plaque.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincaré at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy.]]\n\nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with [[diphtheria]] and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).\n\nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Nancy]] (now renamed the {{ill|Lycée Henri-Poincaré|fr}} in his honour, along with [[Henri Poincaré University]], also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the [[concours général]], a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".<ref>O'Connor et al., 2002</ref> However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.<ref>Carl, 1968</ref> He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\n\nPoincaré entered the [[École Polytechnique]] in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of [[Charles Hermite]], continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (''Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l'indicatrice d'une surface'') in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the [[École des Mines]], while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.<ref>F. Verhulst</ref>\n\nAs a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the [[Corps des Mines]] as an inspector for the [[Vesoul]] region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at [[Magny-lès-Jussey|Magny]] in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\n\nAt the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his [[Doctorate in Science]] in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of [[differential equations]]. It was named ''Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations aux différences partielles''. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the [[solar system]]. Poincaré graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1879.\n\n[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The young Henri Poincaré]]\n\n===First scientific achievements===\nAfter receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the [[Caen University|University of Caen]] in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of [[automorphic function]]s.\n\nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulin d'Andesi (Louise Poulain d'Andecy) and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).\n\nPoincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Paris]]; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in [[École Polytechnique]].\n\nIn 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: [[qualitative theory of differential equations]]. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]].\n\n===Career===\nHe never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\n\nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]). He was initially appointed as the ''maître de conférences d'analyse'' (associate professor of analysis).<ref>Sageret, 1911</ref> Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability<ref>Laurent Mazliak. « Poincaré’s Odds ».

Basel : Birkhäuser</ref>, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\n\nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 5 March 1908.\n\nIn 1887, he won [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II, King of Sweden]]'s mathematical competition for a resolution of the [[three-body problem]] concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See [[#Three-body problem|three-body problem]] section below.)\n\n[[File:Poincaré gravestone.jpg|upright|thumb|The Poincaré family grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]\nIn 1893, Poincaré joined the French [[Bureau des Longitudes]], which engaged him in the [[Clock synchronization|synchronisation of time]] around the world. In 1897 Poincaré backed an unsuccessful proposal for the [[Decimal degrees|decimalisation of circular measure]], and hence time and [[longitude]].<ref>see Galison 2003</ref> It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See [[#Work on relativity|work on relativity]] section below.)\n\nIn 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.\n\nPoincaré was the President of the [[Société astronomique de France|Société Astronomique de France (SAF)]], the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.<ref name=BSAF1911>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9626551q/f616.item ''Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France'', 1911, vol. 25, pp. 581–586]</ref>\n\n====Students====\nPoincaré had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, [[Louis Bachelier]] (1900) and [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] (1905).<ref>[http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=34227 Mathematics Genealogy Project] North Dakota State University.

He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincaré family vault in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse|Cemetery of Montparnasse]], Paris.\n\nA former French Minister of Education, [[Claude Allègre]], proposed in 2004 that Poincaré be reburied in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041127160356/http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribunes/dossier/allegre/dossier.asp?ida=430274 Lorentz, Poincaré et Einstein]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Summary===\nPoincaré made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: [[celestial mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[optics]], electricity, [[telegraphy]], [[capillarity]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[thermodynamics]], [[potential theory]], [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]].\n\nHe was also a populariser of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public.\n\nAmong the specific topics he contributed to are the following:\n*[[algebraic topology]]\n*[[several complex variables|the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables]]\n*[[abelian variety|the theory of abelian functions]]\n*[[algebraic geometry]]\n*Poincaré was responsible for formulating one of the most famous problems in mathematics, the [[Poincaré conjecture]], proven in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]].\n*[[Poincaré recurrence theorem]]\n*[[hyperbolic geometry]]\n*[[number theory]]\n*[[N-body problem|the three-body problem]]\n*[[diophantine equation|the theory of diophantine equations]]\n*[[electromagnetism|the theory of electromagnetism]]\n*[[Special relativity|the special theory of relativity]]\n*In an 1894 paper, he introduced the concept of the [[fundamental group]].\n*In the field of [[differential equations]] Poincaré has given many results that are critical for the qualitative theory of differential equations, for example the [[Poincaré homology sphere|Poincaré sphere]] and the [[Poincaré map]].\n*Poincaré on \"everybody's belief\" in the [[q:Henri Poincaré|''Normal Law of Errors'']] (see [[normal distribution]] for an account of that \"law\")\n*Published an influential paper providing a novel mathematical argument in support of [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=McCormmach>\n{{Citation\n  | last =McCormmach\n  | first =Russell\n  | title = Henri Poincaré and the Quantum Theory\n  | journal = Isis\n  | volume = 58\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 37–55\n  | date = Spring 1967\n  | doi =10.1086/350182\n}}</ref><ref name=Irons>\n{{Citation\n  | last =Irons\n  | first =F.

This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]], where ''n'' is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The ''n''-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II, King of Sweden]], advised by [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]], established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n\n<blockquote>Given a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each [[inverse-square law|according to Newton's law]], under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]].</blockquote>\n\nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished [[Karl Weierstrass]], said, ''\"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\"'' (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu<ref name=diacu>{{Citation\n| last=Diacu|first= Florin | year=1996 | title=The solution of the ''n''-body Problem | journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer | volume =18  | pages =66–70 | doi=10.1007/BF03024313\n| issue=3}}</ref> and the book by Barrow-Green<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poincaré and the three body problem|last=Barrow-Green|first=June|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0821803677|location=Providence, RI|series=History of Mathematics|volume=11|pages=|oclc=34357985}}</ref>).

Poincaré as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In [[s:The Measure of Time|The Measure of Time]] (1898), Poincaré said, \"\nA little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning.

While studying the conflict between the [[Newton's laws of motion|action/reaction principle]] and [[Lorentz ether theory]], he tried to determine whether the [[center of gravity]] still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included.<ref name=action /> He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious [[fluid]] (''fluide fictif'') with a mass density of ''E''/''c''<sup>2</sup>. If the [[center of mass frame]] is defined by both the mass of matter ''and'' the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a [[recoil]] from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a [[Lorentz boost]] (to order ''v''/''c'') to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow [[perpetual motion]], a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\n\nPoincaré himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904).<ref name=louis /> This time (and later also in 1908) he rejected<ref>Miller 1981, Secondary sources on relativity</ref> the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n\n{{quote|The apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance. It therefore becomes useless. }}\n\nHe also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass <math>\\gamma m</math>, Abraham's theory of variable mass and [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann]]'s experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of [[Madame Curie]].\n\nIt was [[Albert Einstein]]'s concept of [[mass–energy equivalence]] (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''E''/''c''<sup>2</sup> that resolved<ref name=darrigol>Darrigol 2005, Secondary sources on relativity</ref> Poincaré's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.<ref>{{Citation|author=Einstein, A. |year=1905b |title=Ist die Trägheit eines Körpers von dessen Energieinhalt abhängig? |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=18 |issue=13 |pages=639–643 |bibcode=1905AnP...323..639E |doi=10.1002/andp.19053231314 |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124051500/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 January 2005 |df=dmy-all }}.

However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincaré's outlook obliquely in a letter to [[Hans Vaihinger]] on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincaré's to be close to Vaihinger's.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein |url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-trans/52 |publisher=Princeton U.P. |accessdate=13 December 2014}}  See also this letter, with commentary, in {{cite journal |last=Sass |first=Hans-Martin | authorlink = Hans-Martin Sass|date=1979 |title=Einstein über \"wahre Kultur\" und die Stellung der Geometrie im Wissenschaftssystem: Ein Brief Albert Einsteins an Hans Vaihinger vom Jahre 1919 |journal=[[Zeitschrift für allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=316–319 |jstor=25170513 |language=de |doi=10.1007/bf01802352}}</ref> In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincaré posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called ''Geometrie und Erfahrung'' in connection with [[non-Euclidean geometry]], but not in connection with special relativity.

The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by [[Johann Benedict Listing]], instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by [[Enrico Betti]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.<ref>J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history. pages = 419–435</ref>\n\nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of [[homotopy]] and [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]]. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the [[fundamental group]]. Poincaré proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of ''n''-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler–Poincaré theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.<ref>{{citation|last=Aleksandrov|first=Pavel S. |authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|title= Poincaré and topology| pages = 27–81}}</ref>\n\n===Astronomy and celestial mechanics===\n[[File:N-body problem (3).gif|frame|left|150px |  <center> Chaotic motion in three-body problem (computer simulation).</center>]]\nPoincaré published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892–1899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V7mxZqjs5yUC&pg=PA254 page 254]</ref>\n\nThese monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the base for mathematical \"[[chaos theory]]\" (see, in particular, the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]]) and the general theory of [[dynamical system]]s.\nPoincaré authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).<ref>A. Kozenko, The theory of planetary figures, pages = 25–26</ref>\n\n===Differential equations and mathematical physics===\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincaré wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881–1882).<ref>French: \"Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle\"</ref> In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"[[qualitative theory of differential equations]]\". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincaré investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincaré also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.<ref>Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 {{isbn|978-3764358457}}</ref><ref>Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"The singular points of the integral curves\">\n   File: Phase Portrait Sadle.svg | Saddle\n   File: Phase Portrait Stable Focus.svg | Focus\n   File: Phase portrait center.svg | Center\n   File: Phase Portrait Stable Node.svg | Node\n</gallery>\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Henri Poincaré by H Manuel.jpg|thumb|right|Photographic portrait of H. Poincaré by Henri Manuel]]\nPoincaré's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincaré was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\n\nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was ''un intuitif'' (intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encounter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4-QLAQAAIAAJ&q=Poincaré+disliked+logic|year=1959|publisher=Martin Secker & Warburg.}}</ref> (Despite this opinion, [[Jacques Hadamard]] wrote that Poincaré's research demonstrated marvelous clarity<ref>J. Hadamard. L'oeuvre de H. Poincaré. Acta Mathematica, 38 (1921), p. 208</ref> and Poincaré himself wrote that he  <!-- TODO: Add Poincaré's opinion on rigorousness, see http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook/American_Journal_of_Mathematics_1890_v12_1000084889#233 — Each time I can I'm absolute rigour --> believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)\n\n===Toulouse's characterisation===\nPoincaré's mental organisation was not only interesting to Poincaré himself but also to Édouard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled ''Henri Poincaré'' (1910).<ref>[http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAS9989.0001.001 Toulouse, Édouard, 1910. ''Henri Poincaré'', E.

He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10&nbsp;a.m. and noon then again from 5&nbsp;p.m. to 7&nbsp;p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.\n* His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.\n* He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.\n* His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.\n\nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n* He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.\n* He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.\n* He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.\n\nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincaré started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\n\nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:\n\n{{quote|text=''Habitué à négliger les détails et à ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une à l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il découvrait se groupant d'eux-mêmes autour de leur centre étaient instantanément et automatiquement classés dans sa mémoire.''

Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] was the life of mathematics. Poincaré gives an interesting point of view in his book ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|text=For a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule.}}\n\nPoincaré believed that [[arithmetic]] is a [[Analytic/synthetic distinction|synthetic]] science. He argued that [[Peano's axioms]] cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' synthetic and not analytic. Poincaré then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of [[Immanuel Kant]] (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian [[set theory]], objecting to its use of [[Impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\nHowever, Poincaré did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean space]] can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"[[conventionalism]]\". Poincaré believed that [[Newton's first law]] was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012).<ref>{{Citation|author= Gargani Julien|title=Poincaré, le hasard et l'étude des systèmes complexes|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2012|page=124\n|url=http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&obj=livre&no=38754}}</ref> He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to [[Euclidean geometry]] that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.<ref>{{Citation|title=Science and Hypothesis|first1=Henri |last1=Poincaré |publisher=Cosimo, Inc.

''An Essay on the Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field''. Princeton Univ Press (1945)</ref>\n\nAlthough he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincaré said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves [[Randomness|chance]].\n<blockquote>\nIt is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.<ref>''Science and Method'', Chapter 3, Mathematical Discovery, 1914, pp.58</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPoincaré's two stages—random combinations followed by selection—became the basis for [[Daniel Dennett]]'s two-stage model of free will.<ref>Dennett, Daniel C. 1978.

His maternal grandmother, Clara Levenson, had been one of the first female doctors in Russia. His maternal grandfather Emmanuil Levenson was a wealthy businessman (he was also the illegitimate father of [[Korney Chukovsky]], who was thus Henrietta's half-brother).  Vladimir Rokhlin's father Abram Veniaminovich Rokhlin was a well-known social democrat (he was imprisoned  during Stalin's [[Great Purge]], and executed in 1941).<ref>see {{harvtxt|Turaev|Vershik|2001}}, p. 1</ref>\n\nVladimir Rokhlin entered [[Moscow State University]] in 1935. His advisor was [[Abraham Plessner]]. He volunteered for the army in 1941, leading to four years as a [[Prisoner of war|prisoner]] of a [[List of POW camps in Germany|German war camp]], and then two years in a Soviet checking camp after the end of the war on suspicion of being a German or/and Western spy. Due to intercession by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] and [[Lev Pontryagin]], he was released and then returned to mathematics.\n\nSince 1959 he was at [[Leningrad State University]], where he was a teacher.\n\nHe died in 1984 in [[Leningrad]]. His students include [[Viatcheslav M. Kharlamov|Viatcheslav Kharlamov]], [[Yakov Eliashberg]], [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]], [[Nikolai V. Ivanov]], [[Anatoly Vershik]] and [[Oleg Viro]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=42580|title=Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nRokhlin's contributions to topology include [[Rokhlin's theorem]], a result of 1952 on the [[signature (topology)|signature]] of [[4-manifold]]s, which was subsequently generalised by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]]. He also worked in the theory of [[characteristic class]]es, [[homotopy theory]] and [[cobordism theory]].\n\nIn [[measure theory]], Rokhlin introduced what are now called [[Rokhlin partition]]s. He introduced the notion of [[standard probability space]], and characterised such spaces up to [[standard probability space#Isomorphism modulo zero|isomorphism mod&nbsp;0]].

He earned his [[Ph.D.]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1967 under the direction of [[Phillip Griffiths]], and then taught at Berkeley and [[Columbia University]], becoming a Full Professor at Columbia at age 27.  In 1978 he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he is currently the Dwight Parker Robinson Professor of Mathematics.\n\nSchmid's early work concerns the construction of [[discrete series representation]]s of semi-simple [[Lie group]]s.  Notable accomplishments here include a proof of Langlands' conjecture on the [[discrete series]], along with a later proof (joint with [[Michael Atiyah]]) constructing all such discrete series representations on spaces of harmonic spinors.  Schmid along with his student Henryk Hecht proved [[Blattner's conjecture]] in 1975.  In the 1970s he described the singularities of the Griffith's period map by applying [[Lie theory|Lie-theoretic method]]s to problems in [[algebraic geometry]].\n\nSchmid has been very involved in K–12 mathematics education both nationally and internationally.  His interest arose in 1999 after being disturbed by the experiences of his 2nd-grade daughter in her mathematics class.  He was heavily involved in the drafting of the Massachusetts Mathematics Curriculum Framework in 2000.  Later, he served on the National Mathematics Advisory Panel of the U.S. Department of Education.<ref>[http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/bios/schmid.html Biography of Dr. Wilfried Schmid]</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-14.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=31755 |name=Wilfried Schmid}}\n*[http://www.math.harvard.edu/~schmid/ Schmid's Harvard website]\n*[http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/bios/schmid.html National Mathematics Panel Biography]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schmid, Wilfried}}\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:German mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometers]]\n[[Category:Differential geometers]]\n[[Category:Harvard University faculty]]\n[[Category:People from Hamburg]]\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]"

It was recently proved (OST) that the pentagram map is completely integrable, with the complete set of Poisson commuting integrals given by the polynomials O1,...,On/2,On and E1,...,En/2,En, previously constructed in S3. These polynomials are somewhat reminiscent of the symmetric polynomials. It was observed in computer experiments that if a polygon is inscribed into a conic then Oi=Ei for all i. The goal of the paper is to prove this theorem.

We find a Poisson structure on the space of twisted polygons and show that the pentagram map relative to this Poisson structure is completely integrable in the sense of Arnold–Liouville. For certain families of twisted polygons, such as those we call universally convex, we translate the integrability into a statement about the quasi-periodic motion for the dynamics of the pentagram map. We also explain how the pentagram map, in the continuous limit, corresponds to the classical Boussinesq equation. The Poisson structure we attach to the pentagram map is a discrete version of the first Poisson structure associated with the Boussinesq equation.

In 1883 he published a dissertation on [[quadric]]s in [[projective space]] and was named as assistant to professors in algebra and [[analytic geometry]]. In 1885 he also assisted in [[descriptive geometry]]. He began to instruct in projective geometry, as stand-in for [[Giuseppe Bruno (mathematician)|Giuseppe Bruno]], from 1885 to 1888. Then for 36 years he had the chair in higher geometry following D'Ovidio. Segre and [[Giuseppe Peano]] made Turin known in geometry, and their complementary instruction has been noted as follows:<ref>Maurizio Avellone, Aldo Brigaglia & Carmela Zappulla (2002) \"The Foundations of Projective Geometry in Italy from De Paolis to Pieri\", ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'' 56:363–425, esp 378</ref>\n{{quote|\"in the mid 1880's, these two very young researchers, Segre and Peano, both of them only just past twenty and both working at the University of Turin, were developing very advanced points of view on fundamental geometrical issues. Although their positions were quite different from one another, they were in some way more complementary than opposed. So it must come as no surprise that Turin was the cradle of some of the most interesting studies on such issues.\"}}\n\nThe [[Erlangen program]] of [[Felix Klein]] appealed early on to Segre, and he became a promulgator. First, in 1885 he published an article on conics in the plane where he demonstrated how group theory facilitated the study. As Hawkins says (page 252) \"the totality of all conics in the plane is identified with P<sup>5</sup>(C)\". The group of its projectivities is then the group that permutes conics. About Segre, Hawkins writes<ref>Thomas Hawkins (2000) ''Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups: an essay in the history of mathematics, 1869&nbsp;– 1926'', Springer {{ISBN|0-387-98963-3}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"shortly after he assumed the chair of projective geometry in Turin in 1888, he decided it would be worthwhile to have an Italian translation of the ''Erlangen Program'' because he felt its contents were not well enough known among young Italian geometers. ... Segre convinced one of the students at Turin, [[Gino Fano]], to make a translation which was published in ''Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata'' in 1889. Fano's translation thus became the first of many translations of the ''Erlangen Program''.\"}}\n\nThe inspiring ''Geometrie der Lage'' (1847) of [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] provided Segre with another project. He encouraged [[Mario Pieri]] to make a translation, ''Geometria di Posizione'' (1889), while Segre composed a biographical sketch of von Staudt that was included in the publication.\n\nSegre also expanded algebraic geometry by consideration of [[multicomplex number]]s, in particular the [[bicomplex number]]s. Segre's 1892 contribution to [[Mathematische Annalen]] shows him extending the work of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] on [[biquaternion]]s. But Segre was unaware of earlier study of tessarines that had anticipated his bicomplex numbers.\n\nIn English, the best known work of Segre is an inspirational essay meant for Italian students, translated by J.W. Young in 1904.<ref>Corrado Segre (1904) \"On some tendencies in geometric investigations\", translated by J. W. Young, [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 10(9):442–68.{{cite journal\n| title = online article\n| mr    = 1558145\n| doi   = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1904-01142-8\n}}</ref> It provides guidance and encouragement to young people studying mathematics.\n\nIn a 1926 memorial article, H.F.

He wrote books and articles that criticize [[socialism]], and was an important [[dissident]] during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime.\n\nShafarevich died on 19 February 2017 in [[Moscow]], at the age of 93.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://deita.ru/news/society/20.02.2017/5186530-ushel-iz-zhizni-matematik-i-filosof-igor-shafarevich/|script-title=ru:Ушел из жизни математик и философ Игорь Шафаревич|work=Deita.ru|date=20 February 2017|accessdate=20 February 2017|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n==Work in mathematics==\nShafarevich made fundamental contributions to several parts of [[mathematics]]\nincluding [[algebraic number theory]], [[algebraic geometry]] and arithmetic algebraic geometry. In algebraic number theory the [[Shafarevich–Weil theorem]] extends the commutative reciprocity map to the case of [[Galois group]]s which are extensions of [[abelian group]]s by [[finite group]]s.\nShafarevich was the first to give a completely self-contained formula for the pairing which coincides with the wild [[Hilbert symbol]] on [[local field]]s, thus initiating an important branch of the study of explicit formulas in [[number theory]]. Another famous result is [[Shafarevich's theorem on solvable Galois groups]] giving the realization of every finite [[solvable group]] as a Galois group over the [[Rational number|rationals]]. Another fundamental result is the [[Golod–Shafarevich theorem]] on towers of [[unramified extension]]s of [[number field]]s.\n\nShafarevich and his school greatly contributed to the study of algebraic geometry of [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]s.\nHe initiated a [[Moscow]] seminar on [[classification of algebraic surfaces]] that updated around 1960 the treatment of [[birational geometry]], and was largely responsible for the early introduction of the [[scheme theory]] approach to algebraic geometry in the Soviet school. His investigation in arithmetic of [[elliptic curve]]s led him independently of [[John Tate]] to the introduction of the most mysterious group related\nto [[elliptic curves]] over number fields, the [[Tate–Shafarevich group]] (usually called 'Sha', written 'Ш', his [[Cyrillic]] initial). He introduced the [[Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula]] and the [[Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion]]. He also formulated the [[Faltings's theorem|Shafarevich conjecture]] which stated the finiteness of the set of [[Abelian varieties]] over a number field having fixed dimension and prescribed set of primes of [[bad reduction]]. This conjecture was proved by [[Gerd Faltings]] as a step in his proof of the [[Mordell conjecture]].\n\nShafarevich was a student of [[Boris Delaunay]], and his students included [[Yuri Manin]], [[Alexey Parshin]], [[Igor Dolgachev]], [[Evgeny Golod]], [[Alexei Kostrikin]], Igor A. Kostrikin, [[Suren Arakelov]], [[G. V. Belyi]], Victor Abrashkin, Andrey N. Tyurin, and [[Victor Kolyvagin]]. He did major work in collaboration with [[Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro]] on [[K3 surface]]s. He was a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in the department of Mathematics, Physics and Earth Sciences.\nIn 1960 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/8289/|title=List of Members|website=www.leopoldina.org|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref> In 1981 he was elected as a foreign member of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"Royal Society 2015\">{{cite web | title=IgorShafarevich | website=Royal Society | date=1 September 2015 | url=https://royalsociety.org/people/igor-shafarevich-12257/ | access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn his 80th birthday, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] hailed his \"fundamental research\" in mathematics, and his creation of \"a great science school known both in Russia and abroad\".<ref>Putin congratulates prominent academician on 80th birthday TASS June 3, 2003</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Shafarevich was awarded the {{ill|Leonard Euler Gold Medal|ru|Золотая медаль имени Леонарда Эйлера|de|Leonhard-Euler-Goldmedaille}} by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].\n\n==Political activities==\nShafarevich came into conflict with the Soviet authorities in the early 1950s, but was protected by [[Ivan Petrovsky]], the Rector of [[Moscow University]]. He belonged to a group of [[Pochvennichestvo]]-influenced dissidents who endorsed the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] tradition. Shafarevich published a book, ''The Socialist Phenomenon'' (French edition 1975, English edition 1980), which was cited by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]] in his 1978 address to [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn the 1970s Shafarevich, with [[Valery Chalidze]], [[Grigori Podyapolski]] and [[Andrei Tverdokhlebov]], became one of Sakharov's [[human rights]] investigators, and was consequently dismissed from Moscow University. Shafarevich opposed political interference in universities. The algebraic geometer [[Miles Reid]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} gives the example of Shafarevich asserting that plagiarism and poor work was being ignored in a doctorate obtained by a [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] functionary.\n\n==''The Socialist Phenomenon''==\nShafarevich's book ''The Socialist Phenomenon'',<ref>The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) Translated by William Tjalsma. Foreword by Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. 319 pp. New York: Harper & Row.</ref> which was published in the [[United States|US]] by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Row]] in 1980, analyzed numerous examples of socialism, from ancient times, through various medieval heresies, to a variety of modern thinkers and socialist states. From these examples he claimed that all the basic principles of socialist ideology derive from the urge to suppress [[individual]]ity. ''The Socialist Phenomenon'' consists of three major parts:<ref>The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980). Contents.</ref>\n\n# [[Chiliastic]] Socialism: Identifies socialist ideas amongst the ancient Greeks, especially [[Plato]], and in numerous medieval heretic groups such as the [[Cathars]], [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]], [[Taborites]], [[Anabaptists]], and various religious groups in the [[English Civil War]], and modern writers such as [[Thomas More]], [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]], and numerous [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers in 18th-century France.<ref>The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) pp.7–79</ref>\n# State Socialism: Describes the socialism of the [[Incas]], the [[Jesuit]] state in [[Paraguay]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and [[China]].<ref>The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) pp.80–131</ref>\n# Analysis: Identifies three persistent abolition themes in socialism – the abolition of [[private property]], the abolition of the [[Nuclear family|family]], and the abolition of religion (mainly, but not exclusively [[Christianity]])<ref>The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) pp.132–192</ref>\n\nShafarevich argued that ancient socialism (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was a reaction to the emergence of individualism in the [[Axial Age]]. He compared [[Thomas More]]'s ([[Utopia]]) and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]]'s ([[The City of the Sun|City of the Sun]]) visions with what is known about the [[Inca Empire]], and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through our relationship with God, and argued that socialism is essentially [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of either pursuing death or life.\n\n==Religious views==\n\nShafarevich adhered to [[Russian Orthodox Christianity]] and incorporated the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonic]] views of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] into his understanding of the relation of mathematics and religion.<ref>The Mathematical Experience, by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hirsch. (1981) pp. 52–55</ref>\n\nIn his talk to the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]] upon receiving a prize, Shafarevich presented his view of the relationship between mathematics and religion. He notes the multiple discoveries in mathematics, such as that of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] to suggest that pure mathematics reflects an objective reality, not a set of conventional definitions or a formalism. He claimed that mathematics' growth in itself is not directed or organic. In order to have a unity and direction mathematics needs a goal. This goal can either be set by practical applications or by God as the source of the direction of development. Shafarevich opted for the latter, as pure mathematics is not in itself driven by practical applications.<ref>Ueber einige Tendenzen in der Entwicklung der Mathematik, Jarhrbuch der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Goettingen. (1973) pp. 31–42</ref>\n\n==In Russian politics==\n\nOn 21 December 1991 he took part in the first congress of the [[Russian All-People's Union]] headed by [[Sergei Baburin]]. In October 1992 he became a member of the founding committee of the [[National Salvation Front (Russia)|National Salvation Front]]. In 1993 he was a candidate for the [[State Duma]] with [[Mikhail Astafyev]]'s [[Constitutional Democratic Party - Party of Popular Freedom]], but failed to get elected.\n\nShafarevich was a member of the editorial board of the magazine ''[[Nash Sovremennik]]'', and in 1991–1992 of the editorial board of ''Den'' of [[Alexander Prokhanov]] (which ceased in October 1993, and later reopened under the title ''[[Zavtra]]''). In 1994 he joined the \"All-Russian National Right Wing Centre\" chaired by [[Mikhail Astafyev]].\n\n==Accusations of antisemitism==\n\nShafarevich's essay titled ''[[Russophobia]]'',<ref name=\"russophobiapdf\">{{cite book|title=Russophobia|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA335121|author=Shafarevich, Igor|date=Mar 1990|publisher=Joint Publications Research Service}}</ref> expanded into the book ''Three thousand year old mystery'' (Трехтысячелетняя загадка) resulted in accusations of [[antisemitism]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9-zvykby20kC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=shafarevich+antisemitic | title = Abram Tertz and the poetics of crime | isbn = 978-0-300-06210-6 | author1 = Nepomnyashchy | first1 = Catharine Theimer | year = 1995 | postscript = .}}</ref><ref>Alexei Miller, [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2002-05-24-miller-en.html The Communist Past in Post-Communist Russia], Eurozine, 2002-05-24.</ref><ref>Veljko Vujacic, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200403/ai_n9363937 Russian Intellectual Anti-Semitism in the Post-Communist Era], Canadian Slavonic Papers, Mar–Jun 2004.</ref> He completed the ''Russophobia'' essay in 1982 and it was initially circulated as ''[[samizdat]]''. In the USSR it was first officially published in 1989.\n\nIn the ''Russophobia'' essay he argued that great nations experience periods in their history when reformist elitist groups ('small nations') that have values that differ fundamentally from the values of the majority of the people, gain upper hand in the society. In Shafarevich's opinion, the role of such a 'small nation' in Russia was played by a small group of [[intelligentsiya]] dominated by [[Jews]]. They were full of hatred against traditional Russian way of life, playing an active role in the terrorist regimes of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name = srez/><ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=a-dbI7B6Vs0C&pg=PA328&dq=shafarevich+russophobia#v=onepage&q=shafarevich%20russophobia&f=false | title = Reinventing Russia: Russian nationalism and the Soviet state, 1953–1991 | isbn = 978-0-674-00438-2 | author1 = Brudny | first1 = Yitzhak M | date = 2000-10-02 | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nIts publication led to a request by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to Shafarevich to resign his membership,<ref>Warren E.

In this article Shafarevich further claimed that Jews effectively marginalize non-Jews to the point of exclusion in all types of intellectual endeavors. This work was published in Russian in 2002; an introductory section explains the relationship with the ''Russophobia'' essay, explaining that the essay developed from an Appendix to an intended work of wider scope which he started writing in ''samizdat''.<ref>{{ru icon}} http://shafarevich.voskres.ru/02.htm</ref>\n\nThe issue of Shafarevich's alleged anti-Semitism has been the subject of a 2009 doctoral thesis at the University of Helsinki, which was later turned into a book<ref name=\"berglund\"></ref>, in which the author, Krista Berglund, concludes that Shafarevich's views have been misconstrued as anti-Semitic.\n\n==Publications==\n\n* {{Citation | last1=Borevich | first1=A.

The most famous appeared in 1891, ''Fondamenti di geometria a più dimensioni e a più specie di unità rettilinee esposti in forma elementare'', normally referred to as ''Fondamenti di geometria'' to distinguish it from Veronese' other works also styled ''Fondamenti''.

His work in developing a [[homotopy theory]] for [[algebraic varieties]] and formulating [[motivic cohomology]] led to the award of a [[Fields Medal]] in 2002.

He learned the [[French language]] \"with the sole purpose of being able to read this text\" and started his research on some of the themes mentioned there.<ref>See the autobiographical story in {{cite web|last1=Voevodsky|first1=Vladimir|title=Univalent Foundations|url=http://www.math.ias.edu/~vladimir/Site3/Univalent_Foundations_files/2014_IAS.pdf|publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]]}}</ref>\n\n== Work ==\nVoevodsky's work was in the intersection of [[algebraic geometry]] with [[algebraic topology]]. Along with [[Fabien Morel]], Voevodsky introduced a [[homotopy theory]] for [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also formulated what is now believed to be the correct form of [[motivic cohomology]], and used this new tool to prove [[Milnor's conjecture]] relating the [[Milnor]] [[K-theory]] of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to its [[étale cohomology]].
