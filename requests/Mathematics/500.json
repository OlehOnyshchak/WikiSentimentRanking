      "text": "Erich Kähler (; 16 January 1906, Leipzig – 31 May 2000, Wedel) was a German mathematician with wide-ranging interests in geometry and mathematical physics, who laid important mathematical groundwork for algebraic geometry and for string theory.\n\nEducation and life\nErich Kähler was born in Leipzig, the son of a telegraph inspector Ernst Kähler. Inspired as a boy to be an explorer after reading books about Sven Hedin that his mother Elsa Götsch had given to him, the young Kähler soon focused his passion for exploration on astronomy. He is said to have written a 50-page thesis on fractional differentiation while still in high school, hoping that it would earn him a PhD. His teachers replied that he would have to attend university courses first.\n\nKähler enrolled in the University of Leipzig in 1924. He read Galois theory, met the mathematician Emil Artin, and did research under the supervision of Leon Lichtenstein. Still fascinated by celestial mechanics, Kähler wrote a dissertation entitled, \"On the existence of equilibrium solutions of rotating liquids, which are derived from certain solutions of the n-body problem\", and received his doctorate in 1928. He continued his studies at Leipzig for the following year, supported by fellowship from the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaften, except for a research assistantship at the University of Königsberg in 1929. In 1930 Kähler joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Hamburg to work under the direction of Wilhelm Blaschke, writing a habilitation thesis entitled, \"About the integrals of algebraic equations\". He took a year in Rome to work with Italian geometers including Enriques, Castelnuovo, Levi-Civita, Severi, and Segre in 1931-1932, which led him to publish his acclaimed work on what are now called Kähler metrics in 1932. Kähler returned to Hamburg after his year in Rome, where he continued to work until going to the University of Konigsberg in 1935, and was offered an ordinary professorship a year later. In 1938 he married his first wife Luise Günther.\n\nIn the years leading up to World War II Kähler was a supporter of Hitler and of German nationalism, and reported that he volunteered for the German military in 1935, joined the navy in 1937, and the army on 24 August 1939 before the invasion of Poland. After being stationed at the Saint-Nazaire submarine base in German Occupied France towards the end of the war, Kähler was captured by the Allies and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Ile de Ré, and then to another camp in Mulsanne. Thanks to the French mathematicians Frederic Joliot-Curie and Élie Cartan, Kähler was able to study mathematics during this time, receiving books and mathematics papers and working during his imprisonment. He was released in 1947. He reported that his oath to Hitler (as a civil servant) was important to him, and remained an apologist for the Third Reich decades later, in a 1988 interview with Sanford Segal. A former student reported in 1988 that he kept a Nazi navy flag in his office.\n\nAfter his release as a prisoner of war Kähler returned to the University of Hamburg to take up a temporary lectureship. He accepted a professorship in 1948 at his alma mater the University of Leipzig, filling a post that had been left open by the death of Paul Koebe in 1945. But in this same year, Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative in the region to German communist leaders, and from October 1949 the region was a part of newly-formed East Germany. Kähler became increasingly unhappy with life in East Germany over the next decade, finally deciding to leave in 1958 to take up a lectureship at the Technical University of Berlin. There he was heralded as among the greatest living mathematicians, and his lectures overflowed with 600 students from engineering and the sciences. In 1964 he returned to the University of Hamburg to fill the post that opened when Artin died in 1962. His wife Luise became ill and died in 1970, and Kähler married his second wife Charlotte Schulze, who was the widow of his brother who had died in the war. Kähler remained at the University of Hamburg until his retirement in 1974.\n\nAfter retiring Kähler remained an active researcher, writing a number of important papers on the foundations of physics and the Poincaré group, as well as a number of philosophical papers.\n\nContributions\nAs a mathematician Kähler is known for a number of contributions: the Cartan–Kähler theorem on solutions of non-linear analytic differential systems; the idea of a Kähler metric on complex manifolds; and the Kähler differentials, which provide a purely algebraic theory and have generally been adopted in algebraic geometry. In all of these the theory of differential forms plays a part, and Kähler counts as a major developer of the theory from its formal genesis with Élie Cartan.\n\nKähler manifolds — complex manifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric and a symplectic form so that the three structures are mutually compatible — are named after him.\n\nThe K3 surface is named after Kummer, Kähler, and Kodaira.\n\nHis earlier work was on celestial mechanics; and he was one of the forerunners of scheme theory, though his ideas on that were never widely adopted.\n\nSee also\nAlmost complex manifold\nHyper-Kähler manifold\nKähler–Einstein metric\nQuaternion-Kähler manifold\nComplex Poisson manifold\nSpecial Kähler geometry\n\nReferences\n\n KÄHLER, Erich Ernst International Who's Who. accessed September 3, 2006.\n \n\nCategory:1906 births\nCategory:2000 deaths\nCategory:German mathematicians\nCategory:20th-century mathematicians\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:People from Leipzig\nCategory:People from the Kingdom of Saxony\nCategory:University of Königsberg alumni\nCategory:Leipzig University alumni\nCategory:Leipzig University faculty\nCategory:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin"

      "text": "Margarete Kahn (known as Grete Kahn, born 27 August 1880, missing after deportation to Piaski, Poland on 28 March 1942) was a German mathematician and Holocaust victim. She was among the first women to obtain a doctorate in Germany. Her doctoral work was on the topology of algebraic curves.\n\n Life and work \n\nMargarete Kahn was the daughter of Eschwege merchant and flannel factory owner Albert Kahn (1853–1905) and his wife Johanne (née Plaut, 1857–1882). She had an older brother Otto (born 1879). Five years after the untimely death of his wife Johanne, their father married her younger sister Julie (1860–1934), with whom he had a daughter, Margaret's half-sister Martha (born 1888).\n\nAfter attending elementary school from 1887, and the Higher School for Girls from 1889 to 1896, Kahn until 1904 took private lessons to prepare for her Abitur, because few high schools for girls existed at that time in Hesse, Germany. In 1904 she was given permission to take her Abitur at the Royal Gymnasium in Bad Hersfeld. Thus she belonged to the small elite of young women in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century who were allowed to take the Abitur externally at boys' schools. Konrad Duden signed her Abitur certificate as school principal.\n\nSince Prussia began to allow women to formally attend university only from the winter semester of 1908–09, Kahn and her friend Klara Löbenstein first attended the universities of Berlin and Göttingen as guest students. In addition, Kahn attended lectures and tutorials in mathematics at the Technical University of Berlin. They studied mathematics, physics, and propaedeutics at Berlin and Göttingen. At the University of Göttingen she attended lectures given by, among others, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Woldemar Voigt, and Georg Elias Müller; in Berlin she attended lectures by Hermann Amandus Schwarz and Paul Drude at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences. Her field of expertise was algebraic geometry. Together with Löbenstein she made a contribution to Hilbert's sixteenth problem. Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of algebraic curves in the complex projective plane; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no algebraic curves of degree 6 consisting of 11 separate ovals. Kahn and Löbenstein developed methods to address this problem.\n\nAgainst opposition in particular from the Berlin faculty, but supported by the University of Göttingen and Felix Klein, Kahn obtained a doctorate in 1909 under David Hilbert in Göttingen, with a dissertation titled Eine allgemeine Methode zur Untersuchung der Gestalten algebraischer Kurven [A general method to investigate the shapes of algebraic curves] and was therefore one of the first German women to obtain a doctorate in mathematics (the mathematics division was part of the faculty of philosophy then). She took her oral examination – again, along with Löbenstein – on June 30, 1909.\n\nKahn could not pursue a scientific career because women in Germany were not admitted to habilitation before 1920. She therefore sought a career as a schoolteacher, and in October 1912 she obtained a job in the Prussian school system, where she worked as a teacher for secondary schools in Katowice, Dortmund, and from 1929, in Berlin-Tegel.\n\nAs a Jew, she was forced to go on leave by the Nazis in 1933, and was dismissed from the school in 1936. She was forced to work as a factory worker at the Nordland Schneeketten (Nordland snow chains) factory. On 28 March 1942, Kahn was deported to Piaski and is considered missing since then.\n\nOn 13  September 2008, a Stolperstein was laid at 127 Rudolstädter Straße in Wilmersdorf in memory of Margaret Kahn. In 2013, a street in Leverkusen was named after her.\nthumb|Stolperstein at 127 Rudolstädter Straße in Wilmersdorf, in memory of Margarete Kahn\n\n Publications \n\n References \n\n Further reading \n\n \n \n\n External links \n\n \n \n\nCategory:1880 births\nCategory:1942 deaths\nCategory:German mathematicians\nCategory:19th-century Jews\nCategory:19th-century women\nCategory:20th-century mathematicians\nCategory:Women mathematicians\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:German Jews who died in the Holocaust\nCategory:University of Göttingen alumni\nCategory:Women in World War II\nCategory:20th-century women scientists\nCategory:20th-century women mathematicians"

      "text": " was a Japanese mathematician known for distinguished work in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, and as the founder of the Japanese school of algebraic geometers. He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1954, being the first Japanese national to receive this honour.\n\n Early years \nKodaira was born in Tokyo. He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1938 with a degree in mathematics and also graduated from the physics department at the University of Tokyo in 1941. During the war years he worked in isolation, but was able to master Hodge theory as it then stood.  He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo in 1949, with a thesis entitled Harmonic fields in Riemannian manifolds. He was involved in cryptographic work from about 1944, while holding an academic post in Tokyo.\n\n Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University \nIn 1949 he travelled to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey at the invitation of Hermann Weyl. He was subsequently also appointed Associate Professor at Princeton University in 1952 and promoted to Professor in 1955.  At this time the foundations of Hodge theory were being brought in line with contemporary technique in operator theory. Kodaira rapidly became involved in exploiting the tools it opened up in algebraic geometry, adding sheaf theory as it became available. This work was particularly influential, for example on Friedrich Hirzebruch.\n\nIn a second research phase, Kodaira wrote a long series of papers in collaboration with Donald C. Spencer, founding the deformation theory of complex structures on manifolds. This gave the possibility of constructions of moduli spaces, since in general such structures depend continuously on parameters. It also identified the sheaf cohomology groups, for the sheaf associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle, that carried the basic data about the dimension of the moduli space, and obstructions to deformations. This theory is still foundational, and also had an influence on the (technically very different) scheme theory of Grothendieck. Spencer then continued this work, applying the techniques to structures other than complex ones, such as G-structures.\n\nIn a third major part of his work, Kodaira worked again from around 1960 through the classification of algebraic surfaces from the point of view of birational geometry of complex manifolds. This resulted in a typology of seven kinds of two-dimensional compact complex manifolds, recovering the five algebraic types known classically; the other two being non-algebraic. He provided also detailed studies of elliptic fibrations of surfaces over a curve, or in other language elliptic curves over algebraic function fields, a theory whose arithmetic analogue proved important soon afterwards. This work also included a characterisation of K3 surfaces as deformations of quartic surfaces in P4, and the theorem that they form a single diffeomorphism class. Again, this work has proved foundational.  (The K3 surfaces were named after Ernst Kummer, Erich Kähler, and Kodaira).\n\nLater years\nKodaira left Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961, and briefly served as chair at the Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University.  In 1967, returned to the University of Tokyo. He was awarded a Wolf Prize in 1984/5. He died in Kofu on 26 July 1997.\n\nBibliography\n\nSee also\nBochner–Kodaira–Nakano identity\nSpectral theory of ordinary differential equations\nKodaira vanishing theorem\nKodaira–Spencer mapping\nKodaira dimension\nKodaira embedding theorem\nEnriques–Kodaira classification\nKodaira's classification of singular fibers\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:20th-century Japanese mathematicians\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:Fields Medalists\nCategory:Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates\nCategory:University of Tokyo faculty\nCategory:Princeton University faculty\nCategory:Johns Hopkins University faculty\nCategory:Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty\nCategory:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars\nCategory:University of Tokyo alumni\nCategory:People from Tokyo\nCategory:People from Nagano Prefecture\nCategory:1915 births\nCategory:1997 deaths\nCategory:Recipients of the Order of Culture"

After ranking second in the All-Union Mathematics Olympiads, he attended Moscow State University but left without a degree in 1985 to become a researcher at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems in Moscow. While at the institute he published papers that caught the interest of the Max Planck Institute in Bonn and was invited for three months. Just before the end of his time there, he attended a five-day international meeting, the Arbeitstagung, where he sketched a proof of the Witten conjecture to the amazement of Michael Atiyah and other mathematicians and his invitation to the institute was subsequently extended to three years. The next year he finished the proof and worked on various topics on mathematical physics and in 1992 received his Ph.D. at the University of Bonn under Don Bernard Zagier. His thesis outlines a proof of a conjecture by Edward Witten that two quantum gravitational models are equivalent.\n\nHis work concentrates on geometric aspects of mathematical physics, most notably on knot theory, quantization, and mirror symmetry.  One of his results is a formal deformation quantization that holds for any Poisson manifold.  He also introduced knot invariants defined by complicated integrals analogous to Feynman integrals. In topological field theory, he introduced the moduli space of stable maps, which may be considered a mathematically rigorous formulation of the Feynman integral for topological string theory.\n\nHonors and awards\nIn 1998, he won the Fields Medal for his \"contributions to four problems of Geometry\".

Her doctoral work was on the topology of algebraic curves.\n\n Life and work \n\nLöbenstein was born in Hildesheim, Prussia on 15 February 1883 to merchant Lehmann Löbenstein and his wife Sofie (née Schönfeld).\n\nIn 1904, Löbenstein was given permission to take her Abitur at the Realgymnasium I Gymnasium in Hanover. Thus she belonged to a small group of talented young women in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century who were allowed to take the Abitur externally at boys' schools.\n \nSince Prussia began to allow women to formally attend university only from the winter semester of 1908–09, Löbenstein and her friend Margarete Kahn first attended the universities of Berlin and Göttingen as guest students. They studied mathematics, physics, and propaedeutics at Berlin and Göttingen. Löbenstein's field of expertise was algebraic geometry. Together with Kahn she made a contribution to Hilbert's sixteenth problem. Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of algebraic curves in the complex projective plane; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no algebraic curves of degree 6 consisting of 11 separate ovals. Löbenstein and Kahn developed methods to address this problem.\n\nLöbenstein obtained a doctorate in 1910 under David Hilbert in Göttingen, with a dissertation titled Über den Satz, daß eine ebene, algebraische Kurve 6. Ordnung mit 11 sich einander ausschließenden Ovalen nicht existiert [On the proposition that no plane algebraic curve of degree 6 with 11 mutually exclusive ovals exists], and was therefore one of the first German women to obtain a doctorate in mathematics (the mathematics division was part of the faculty of philosophy then). She took her oral examination – again, along with Kahn – on 30 June 1909. Afterwards Löbenstein worked as a high school teacher in Metz and Landsberg. She was dismissed on 1 January 1936 due to the Nazi racial laws. In 1941 she emigrated to Argentina. She died on 10 June 1968 in Buenos Aires, where she rests in the Cementerio alemán.\n\n Publications \n\n References \n\n External links \n\n \n\nCategory:1883 births\nCategory:1968 deaths\nCategory:20th-century German mathematicians\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:University of Göttingen alumni"

      "text": " was a Japanese mathematician.\n\nEarly life\nMatsushima was born on February 11, 1921 in Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. He studied at Osaka Imperial University (later named Osaka University) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in September 1942. At Osaka, he was taught by mathematicians Kenjiro Shoda. After completing his degree, he was appointed as an assistant in the Mathematical Institute of Nagoya Imperial University (later named Nagoya University). These were difficult years for Japanese students and researchers because of World War II.\n\nThe first paper published by Matsushima contained a proof that a conjecture of Hans Zassenhaus was false. Zassenhaus had conjectured that every semisimple Lie algebra L over a field of prime characteristic, with [L, L] = L, is the direct sum of simple ideals. Matsushima constructed a counterexample. He then developed a proof that Cartan subalgebras of a complex Lie algebra are conjugate. However, Japanese researchers were out of touch with the research done in the West, and Matsushima was unaware that French mathematician Claude Chevalley had already published a proof. When he obtained details of another paper of Chevalley through a review in Mathematical Reviews, he was able to construct the proofs for himself.\n\nMatsushima published two papers in the 1947 volume of the Proceedings of the Japan Academy (which did not appear until 1950) and three papers in the first volume of Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan.\n\nProfessorship\nMatsushima became a full professor at Nagoya University in 1953. Chevalley visited Matsushima in Nagoya in 1953 and invited him to spend the following year in France. He went to France in 1954 and returned to Nagoya in December 1955. He also spent time at the University of Strasbourg. He presented some of his results to Ehresmann's seminar in Strasbourg, extending Cartan's classification of complex irreducible Lie algebras to the case of real Lie algebras.\n\nIn spring 1960, Matsushima became a professor of Osaka University as successor to the chair of Shoda. His research took a somewhat different direction and he wrote a series of papers on cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, collaborating with Murakami. He went to the Institute for Advanced Study in September 1962 and returned to Osaka after one year. He jointly began to organize the United States-Japan Seminar in Differential Geometry, which was held in Kyoto in June 1965. After this, he went to France and spent the academic year 1965-66 as visiting professor at the University of Grenoble. He accepted a chair at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana in September 1966. He continued to collaborate with Murakami. He introduced Matsushima's formula for the Betti numbers of quotients of symmetric spaces. In 1967, he became an editor of the Journal of Differential Geometry and remained on the editorial board for the rest of his life. After 14 years at Notre Dame, he returned to Japan in 1980. A conference was organized in his honor in May 1980 before he left Notre Dame.\n\nLater life\nIn February 1981,  a volume of papers Manifolds and Lie groups, Papers in honour of Yozo Matsushima was published by his colleagues and former students at Osaka. It also contained some papers presented to the conference held in Notre Dame in the previous May. He died on April 9, 1983 in Osaka, Japan.\n\nHonours\nMatsushima received the Asahi Prize for his research on continuous groups in 1962.\n\n References \n\n \n\n \n\nCategory:1921 births\nCategory:1983 deaths\nCategory:20th-century Japanese mathematicians\nCategory:Japanese mathematicians\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Osaka University alumni\nCategory:University of Notre Dame faculty\nCategory:Nagoya University faculty\nCategory:Osaka University faculty\nCategory:People from Sakai, Osaka"

      "text": "David Bryant Mumford (born 11 June 1937) is an American mathematician known for distinguished work in algebraic geometry, and then for research into vision and pattern theory. He won the Fields Medal and was a MacArthur Fellow. In 2010 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He is currently a University Professor Emeritus in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University.\n\nEarly life\nMumford was born in Worth, West Sussex in England, of an English father and American mother. His father William started an experimental school in Tanzania and worked for the then newly created United Nations.\n\nIn high school, he was a finalist in the prestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search. After attending the Phillips Exeter Academy, Mumford went to Harvard, where he became a student of Oscar Zariski. At Harvard, he became a Putnam Fellow in 1955 and 1956. He completed his Ph.D. in 1961, with a thesis entitled Existence of the moduli scheme for curves of any genus.\n\nWork in algebraic geometry\nMumford's work in geometry combined traditional geometric insights with the latest algebraic techniques. He published on moduli spaces, with a theory summed up in his book Geometric Invariant Theory, on the equations defining an abelian variety, and on algebraic surfaces.\n\nHis books Abelian Varieties (with C. P. Ramanujam) and Curves on an Algebraic Surface combined the old and new theories. His lecture notes on scheme theory circulated for years in unpublished form, at a time when they were, beside the treatise Éléments de géométrie algébrique, the only accessible introduction. They are now available as The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes ().\n\nOther work that was less thoroughly written up were lectures on varieties defined by quadrics, and a study of Goro Shimura's papers from the 1960s.\n\nMumford's research did much to revive the classical theory of theta functions, by showing that its algebraic content was large, and enough to support the main parts of the theory by reference to finite analogues of the Heisenberg group. This work on the equations defining abelian varieties appeared in 1966–7. He published some further books of lectures on the theory.\n\nHe also was one of the founders of the toroidal embedding theory; and sought to apply the theory to Gröbner basis techniques, through students who worked in algebraic computation.\n\nWork on pathologies in algebraic geometry\nIn a sequence of four papers published in the American Journal of Mathematics between 1961 and 1975, Mumford explored pathological behavior in algebraic geometry, that is, phenomena that would not arise if the world of algebraic geometry were as well-behaved as one might expect from looking at the simplest examples.  These pathologies fall into two types: (a) bad behavior in characteristic p and (b) bad behavior in moduli spaces.\n\nCharacteristic-p pathologies\nMumford's philosophy in characteristic p was as follows:\n\nA nonsingular characteristic p variety is analogous to a general non-Kähler complex manifold;  in particular, a projective embedding of such a variety is not as strong as a Kähler metric on a complex manifold, and the Hodge–Lefschetz–Dolbeault theorems on sheaf cohomology break down in every possible way.\n\nIn the first Pathologies paper, Mumford finds an everywhere regular differential form on a smooth projective surface that is not closed, and shows that Hodge symmetry fails for classical Enriques surfaces in characteristic two.  This second example is developed further in Mumford's third paper on classification of surfaces in characteristic p (written in collaboration with E. Bombieri).  This pathology can now be explained in terms of the Picard scheme of the surface, and in particular, its failure to be a reduced scheme, which is a theme developed in Mumford's book \"Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface\".  Worse pathologies related to p-torsion in crystalline cohomology were explored by Luc Illusie (Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. (4) 12 (1979), 501–661).\n\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford gives a simple example of a surface in characteristic p where the geometric genus is non-zero, but the second Betti number is equal to the rank of the Néron–Severi group. Further such examples arise in Zariski surface theory.  He also conjectures that the Kodaira vanishing theorem is false for surfaces in characteristic p.  In the third paper, he gives an example of a normal surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails.  The first example of a smooth surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails was given by Michel Raynaud in 1978.\n\nPathologies of moduli spaces\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford finds that the Hilbert scheme parametrizing space curves of degree 14 and genus 24 has a multiple component.  In the fourth Pathologies paper, he finds reduced and irreducible complete curves which are not specializations of non-singular curves.\n\nThese sorts of pathologies were considered to be fairly scarce when they first appeared.  But recently, Ravi Vakil in a paper called \"Murphy's law in algebraic geometry\" has shown that Hilbert schemes of nice geometric objects can be arbitrarily \"bad\", with unlimited numbers of components and with arbitrarily large multiplicities (Invent. Math. 164 (2006), 569–590).\n\nClassification of surfaces\n\nIn three papers written between 1969 and 1976 (the last two in collaboration with Enrico Bombieri), Mumford extended the Enriques–Kodaira classification of smooth projective surfaces from the case of the complex ground field to the case of an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic p.  The final answer turns out to be essentially as the answer in the complex case (though the methods employed are sometimes quite different), once two important adjustments are made.  The first is that one may get \"non-classical\" surfaces, which come about when p-torsion in the Picard scheme degenerates to a non-reduced group scheme.  The second is the possibility of obtaining quasi-elliptic surfaces in characteristics two and three.  These are surfaces fibred over a curve where the general fibre is a curve of arithmetic genus one with a cusp.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made, the surfaces are divided into four classes by their Kodaira dimension, as in the complex case.  The four classes are:\na) Kodaira dimension minus infinity.  These are the ruled surfaces.\nb) Kodaira dimension 0.  These are the K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, hyperelliptic and quasi-hyperelliptic surfaces, and Enriques surfaces.  There are classical and non-classical examples in the last two Kodaira dimension zero cases.\nc) Kodaira dimension 1. These are the elliptic and quasi-elliptic surfaces not contained in the last two groups.\nd) Kodaira dimension 2. These are the surfaces of general type.\n\nAwards and honors\nthumb|220px|David Mumford in 1975\nMumford was awarded a Fields Medal in 1974.  He was a\nMacArthur Fellow from 1987 to 1992. He won the Shaw Prize in 2006.  In 2007 he was awarded the Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition by the American Mathematical Society.

      "text": "Max Noether (24 September 1844 – 13 December 1921) was a German mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and the theory of algebraic functions. He has been called \"one of the finest mathematicians of the nineteenth century\".Lederman, p. 69. He was the father of Emmy Noether.\n\nBiography\nMax Noether was born in Mannheim in 1844, to a Jewish family of wealthy wholesale hardware dealers. His grandfather, Elias Samuel, had started the business in Bruchsal in 1797. In 1809 the Grand Duchy of Baden established a \"Tolerance Edict\", which assigned a hereditary surname to the male head of every Jewish family which did not already possess one. Thus the Samuels became the Noether family, and as part of this Christianization of names, their son Hertz (Max's father) became Hermann. Max was the third of five children Hermann had with his wife Amalia Würzburger.Dick, pp. 4–7.\n\nAt 14, Max contracted polio and was afflicted by its effects for the rest of his life. Through self-study, he learned advanced mathematics and entered the University of Heidelberg in 1865. He served on the faculty there for several years, then moved to the University of Erlangen in 1888. While there, he helped to found the field of algebraic geometry.Lederman, pp. 69–71.\n\nIn 1880 he married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of another wealthy Jewish merchant family. Two years later they had their first child, named Amalia (\"Emmy\") after her mother. Emmy Noether went on to become a central figure in abstract algebra. In 1883 they had a son named Alfred, who later studied chemistry before dying in 1918. Their third child, Fritz, was born in 1884. Like Emmy, Fritz Noether also found prominence as a mathematician. Little is known about their fourth child, Gustav Robert, born in 1889. He suffered from continual illness and died in 1928.Dick, pp. 9–45.\n\nMax Noether served as an Ordinarius (full professor) at Erlangen for many years, and died there on 13 December 1921.\n\nWork on algebraic geometry\n\nBrill and Max Noether developed alternative proofs using algebraic methods for much of Riemann's work on Riemann surfaces. Brill–Noether theory went further by estimating the dimension of the space of maps of given degree d from an algebraic curve to projective space Pn. In birational geometry, Noether introduced the fundamental technique of blowing up in order to prove resolution of singularities for plane curves.\n\nMax Noether made major contributions to the theory of algebraic surfaces. Noether's formula is the first case of the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. The Noether inequality is one of the main restrictions on the possible discrete invariants of a surface. The Noether-Lefschetz theorem (proved by Lefschetz) says that the Picard group of a very general surface of degree at least 4 in P3 is generated by the restriction of the line bundle O(1).\n\nMax Noether and Castelnuovo showed that the Cremona group of birational automorphisms of the complex projective plane is generated by the \"quadratic transformation\"\n\n [x,y,z] ↦ [1/x, 1/y, 1/z]\n\ntogether with the group PGL(3,C) of automorphisms of P2. Even today, no explicit generators are known for the group of birational automorphisms of P3.\n\nSee also\nNoether's theorem on rationality for surfaces\nMax Noether's theorem – a list of several theorems\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Dick, Auguste.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 29 April 1854 – 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as \"The Last Universalist,\" since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.\n\nAs a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. He was responsible for formulating the Poincaré conjecture, which was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002–2003 by Grigori Perelman. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.\n\nPoincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe Poincaré group used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\n\nLife\nPoincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle into an influential family.Belliver, 1956 His father Leon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy.Sagaret, 1911 His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher Emile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincaré, a fellow member of the Académie française, who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Jules Henri Poincaré article by Mauro Murzi – Retrieved November 2006. \n\nEducation\nthumb|right|200px| Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincaré at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy.\n\nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).\n\nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in Nancy (now renamed the  in his honour, along with Henri Poincaré University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours général, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".O'Connor et al., 2002 However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.Carl, 1968 He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\n\nPoincaré entered the École Polytechnique in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l'indicatrice d'une surface) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the École des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.F. Verhulst\n\nAs a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\n\nAt the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations aux différences partielles. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the solar system. Poincaré graduated from the University of Paris in 1879.\n\nleft|upright|thumb|The young Henri Poincaré\n\nFirst scientific achievements\nAfter receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions.\n\nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulin d'Andesi (Louise Poulain d'Andecy) and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).\n\nPoincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in École Polytechnique.\n\nIn 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.\n\nCareer\nHe never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\n\nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the maître de conférences d'analyse (associate professor of analysis).Sageret, 1911 Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of ProbabilityLaurent Mazliak. « Poincaré’s Odds ».

Basel : Birkhäuser, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\n\nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Académie française on 5 March 1908.\n\nIn 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)\n\nupright|thumb|The Poincaré family grave at the Cimetière du Montparnasse\nIn 1893, Poincaré joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincaré backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude.see Galison 2003 It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)\n\nIn 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.\n\nPoincaré was the President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France, 1911, vol. 25, pp. 581–586\n\nStudents\nPoincaré had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).Mathematics Genealogy Project North Dakota State University. Retrieved April 2008.\n\n Death \n\nIn 1912, Poincaré underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincaré family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris.\n\nA former French Minister of Education, Claude Allègre, proposed in 2004 that Poincaré be reburied in the Panthéon in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.Lorentz, Poincaré et Einstein\n\nWork\n\nSummary\nPoincaré made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, quantum theory, theory of relativity and physical cosmology.\n\nHe was also a populariser of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public.\n\nAmong the specific topics he contributed to are the following:\nalgebraic topology\nthe theory of analytic functions of several complex variables\nthe theory of abelian functions\nalgebraic geometry\nPoincaré was responsible for formulating one of the most famous problems in mathematics, the Poincaré conjecture, proven in 2003 by Grigori Perelman.\nPoincaré recurrence theorem\nhyperbolic geometry\nnumber theory\nthe three-body problem\nthe theory of diophantine equations\nthe theory of electromagnetism\nthe special theory of relativity\nIn an 1894 paper, he introduced the concept of the fundamental group.\nIn the field of differential equations Poincaré has given many results that are critical for the qualitative theory of differential equations, for example the Poincaré sphere and the Poincaré map.\nPoincaré on \"everybody's belief\" in the Normal Law of Errors (see normal distribution for an account of that \"law\")\nPublished an influential paper providing a novel mathematical argument in support of quantum mechanics.\n\nThree-body problem\nThe problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the solar system had eluded mathematicians since Newton's time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the n-body problem, where n is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The n-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by Gösta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n\nGiven a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton's law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly.\n\nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, \"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\" (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu and the book by Barrow-Green). The version finally printed contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for n = 3 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of n > 3 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s.\n\nWork on relativity\nthumb|right|Marie Curie and Poincaré talk at the 1911 Solvay Conference\n\nLocal time\nPoincaré's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"luminiferous aether\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called \"local time\"  , Section A5a, p 37\nand introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson–Morley experiment).\nPoincaré was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincaré as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In The Measure of Time (1898), Poincaré said, \"\nA little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.. See also the English translation\n\nPrinciple of relativity and Lorentz transformations\n\nIn 1881 Poincaré described hyperbolic geometry in terms of Weierstrass coordinates of the hyperboloid model. There, he formulated transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval , which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions.\n\nPoincare developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of  the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincaré sphere.H. Poincare (1889) Theorie Mathematique de la Lumiere, volume 1 and Volume 2 (1892) via Internet Archive.H. Poincare (1901) Electricite et Optique : La Lumiere et les Theories Electrodynamique, via Internet Archive\n\nHe discussed the \"principle of relative motion\" in two papers in 1900. Reprinted in \"Science and Hypothesis\", Ch. 9–10.\nand named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest. available in online chapter from 1913 book\nIn 1905 Poincaré wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincaré described as a \"paper of supreme importance.\" In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.\nIn a second letter to Lorentz, Poincaré gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all—it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group—and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.\nPoincaré later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote: (PDF) Membres de l'Académie des sciences depuis sa création : Henri Poincare. Sur la dynamique de l' electron.  Note de H. Poincaré. C.R. T.140 (1905) 1504–1508.\n\nThe essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:\n\nand showed that the arbitrary function  must be unity for all  (Lorentz had set  by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincaré pointed out that the combination  is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing  as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. (Wikisource translation) Poincaré expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit.Walter (2007), Secondary sources on relativity So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.\n\nMass–energy relation\nLike others before, Poincaré (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\n\nPoincaré himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904). This time (and later also in 1908) he rejectedMiller 1981, Secondary sources on relativity the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n\nHe also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass , Abraham's theory of variable mass and Kaufmann's experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Madame Curie.\n\nIt was Albert Einstein's concept of mass–energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m = E/c2 that resolvedDarrigol 2005, Secondary sources on relativity Poincaré's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.. See also English translation. The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincaré's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincaré's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.\n\nGravitational waves\nIn 1905 Henri Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.   \"Il importait d'examiner cette hypothèse de plus près et en particulier de rechercher quelles modifications elle nous obligerait à apporter aux lois de la gravitation. C'est ce que j'ai cherché à déterminer; j'ai été d'abord conduit à supposer que la propagation de la gravitation n'est pas instantanée, mais se fait avec la vitesse de la lumière.\"\n\nPoincaré and Einstein\nEinstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincaré's short paper, but before Poincaré's longer version. Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincaré (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincaré never acknowledged Einstein's work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincaré's outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincaré's to be close to Vaihinger's.  See also this letter, with commentary, in  In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincaré posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called Geometrie und Erfahrung in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincaré as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying \"Lorentz had already recognised that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincaré deepened this insight still further ....\"Darrigol 2004, Secondary sources on relativity\n\nAssessments on Poincaré and relativity\n\nPoincaré's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised, though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.Galison 2003 and Kragh 1999, Secondary sources on relativity Poincaré developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincaré tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.Holton (1988), 196–206Hentschel (1990), 3–13Miller (1981), 216–217Darrigol (2005), 15–18Katzir (2005), 286–288\n\nWhile this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincaré and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.Whittaker 1953, Secondary sources on relativity\n\nAlgebra and number theory\nPoincaré introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations.Poincaré, Selected works in three volumes. page = 682 He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.\nright|frame |50px |Topological transformation of the torus into a mug \n\nTopology\nThe subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his \"Erlangen Program\" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history. pages = 419–435\n\nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincaré proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of n-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler–Poincaré theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.\n\nAstronomy and celestial mechanics\nframe|left|150px |   Chaotic motion in three-body problem (computer simulation).\nPoincaré published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892–1899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history, page 254\n\nThese monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the base for mathematical \"chaos theory\" (see, in particular, the Poincaré recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.\nPoincaré authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).A. Kozenko, The theory of planetary figures, pages = 25–26\n\nDifferential equations and mathematical physics\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincaré wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881–1882).French: \"Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle\" In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincaré investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincaré also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174\n\nCharacter\nthumb|right|Photographic portrait of H. Poincaré by Henri Manuel\nPoincaré's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincaré was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\n\nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic. (Despite this opinion, Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincaré's research demonstrated marvelous clarityJ. Hadamard. L'oeuvre de H. Poincaré. Acta Mathematica, 38 (1921), p. 208 and Poincaré himself wrote that he   believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)\n\nToulouse's characterisation\nPoincaré's mental organisation was not only interesting to Poincaré himself but also to Édouard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled Henri Poincaré (1910).Toulouse, Édouard, 1910. Henri Poincaré, E. Flammarion, Paris In it, he discussed Poincaré's regular schedule:\n He worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10 a.m. and noon then again from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.\n His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.\n He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.\n His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.\n\nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.\n He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.\n He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.\n\nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincaré started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\n\nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:\n\nAttitude towards transfinite numbers\nPoincaré was dismayed by Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers, and referred to it as a \"disease\" from which mathematics would eventually be cured.Dauben 1979, p. 266.\nPoincaré said, \"There is no actual infinite; the Cantorians have forgotten this, and that is why they have fallen into contradiction.\", p 190\n\nHonours\nAwards\nOscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition (1887)\nForeign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1897)\nAmerican Philosophical Society 1899\nGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of London (1900)\nBolyai Prize in 1905\nMatteucci Medal 1905\nFrench Academy of Sciences 1906\nAcadémie française 1909\nBruce Medal (1911)\n\nNamed after him\nInstitut Henri Poincaré (mathematics and theoretical physics center)\nPoincaré Prize (Mathematical Physics International Prize)\nAnnales Henri Poincaré (Scientific Journal)\nPoincaré Seminar (nicknamed \"Bourbaphy\")\nThe crater Poincaré on the Moon\nAsteroid 2021 Poincaré\nList of things named after Henri Poincaré\n\nHenri Poincaré did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had influential advocates like Henri Becquerel or committee member Gösta Mittag-Leffler. The nomination archive reveals that Poincaré received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death. Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincaré. Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).\n\nThe fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincaré, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory. In Poincaré's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.\n\nPhilosophy\nPoincaré had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincaré gives an interesting point of view in his book Science and Hypothesis:\n\nPoincaré believed that arithmetic is a synthetic science. He argued that Peano's axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is a priori synthetic and not analytic. Poincaré then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"conventionalism\". Poincaré believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012). He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.\n\nFree will\nPoincaré's famous lectures before the Société de Psychologie in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.Hadamard, Jacques. An Essay on the Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field. Princeton Univ Press (1945)\n\nAlthough he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincaré said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance.\nIt is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.Science and Method, Chapter 3, Mathematical Discovery, 1914, pp.58\n\nPoincaré's two stages—random combinations followed by selection—became the basis for Daniel Dennett's two-stage model of free will.Dennett, Daniel C. 1978.

His maternal grandmother, Clara Levenson, had been one of the first female doctors in Russia. His maternal grandfather Emmanuil Levenson was a wealthy businessman (he was also the illegitimate father of Korney Chukovsky, who was thus Henrietta's half-brother).  Vladimir Rokhlin's father Abram Veniaminovich Rokhlin was a well-known social democrat (he was imprisoned  during Stalin's Great Purge, and executed in 1941).see , p. 1\n\nVladimir Rokhlin entered Moscow State University in 1935. His advisor was Abraham Plessner. He volunteered for the army in 1941, leading to four years as a prisoner of a German war camp, and then two years in a Soviet checking camp after the end of the war on suspicion of being a German or/and Western spy. Due to intercession by Andrey Kolmogorov and Lev Pontryagin, he was released and then returned to mathematics.\n\nSince 1959 he was at Leningrad State University, where he was a teacher.\n\nHe died in 1984 in Leningrad. His students include Viatcheslav Kharlamov, Yakov Eliashberg, Mikhail Gromov, Nikolai V. Ivanov, Anatoly Vershik and Oleg Viro.\n\nWork\nRokhlin's contributions to topology include Rokhlin's theorem, a result of 1952 on the signature of 4-manifolds, which was subsequently generalised by Friedrich Hirzebruch. He also worked in the theory of characteristic classes, homotopy theory and cobordism theory.\n\nIn measure theory, Rokhlin introduced what are now called Rokhlin partitions. He introduced the notion of standard probability space, and characterised such spaces up to isomorphism mod 0. He also proved the famous Rokhlin lemma.\n\nFamily\nHis son Vladimir Rokhlin, Jr. is a well-known mathematician and computer scientist at Yale University.\n\nRokhlin's uncle was Korney Chukovsky, a well-known Russian poet, most famous for his popular children's books.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n\n Rokhlin – an article by Sergei Novikov\nOn teaching mathematics to non-mathematicians, a 1981 lecture by V.A.

In 1978 he moved to Harvard University, where he is currently the Dwight Parker Robinson Professor of Mathematics.\n\nSchmid's early work concerns the construction of discrete series representations of semi-simple Lie groups.  Notable accomplishments here include a proof of Langlands' conjecture on the discrete series, along with a later proof (joint with Michael Atiyah) constructing all such discrete series representations on spaces of harmonic spinors.  Schmid along with his student Henryk Hecht proved Blattner's conjecture in 1975.  In the 1970s he described the singularities of the Griffith's period map by applying Lie-theoretic methods to problems in algebraic geometry.\n\nSchmid has been very involved in K–12 mathematics education both nationally and internationally.

      "text": "Richard Evan Schwartz (born August 11, 1966) is an American mathematician notable for his contributions to geometric group theory and to an area of mathematics known as billiards. Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics beginning around the late 1980sM. Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups, in \"Essays in Group Theory\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75–263. which explores finitely generated groups, and seeks connections between their algebraic properties and the geometric spaces on which these groups act. He has worked on what mathematicians refer to as billiards, which are dynamical systems based on a convex shape in a plane. He has explored geometric iterations involving polygons, and he has been credited for developing the mathematical concept known as the pentagram map. In addition, he is a bestselling author of a mathematics picture book for young children. His published work usually appears under the name Richard Evan Schwartz. In 2018 he is a professor of mathematics at Brown University.\n\nCareer\nSchwartz was born in Los Angeles on August 11, 1966. In his youth he played tennis and enjoyed video games. He attended John F. Kennedy High School in Los Angeles from 1981 to 1984, then earned a B. S. in mathematics from U.C.L.A. in 1987, and then a Ph. D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1991 under the supervision of William Thurston.http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18909 He taught at the University of Maryland. He is currently the Chancellor's Professor of Mathematics at Brown University. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Barrington, Rhode Island.\n\nSchwartz is credited by other mathematicians for introducing the concept of the pentagram map.\nAccording to Schwartz's conception, a convex polygon would be inscribed with diagonal lines inside it, by drawing a line from one point to the next point—that is, by skipping over the immediate point on the polygon. The intersection points of the diagonals would form an inner polygon, and the process could be repeated. Schwartz observed these geometric patterns, partly by experimenting with computers. \nHe has collaborated with mathematicians Valentin Ovsienko \nand Sergei Tabachnikov \nto show that the pentagram map is  \"completely integrable.\"\n\nIn his spare time he draws comic books, writes computer programs, listens to music and exercises. He admired the late Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold and dedicated a paper to him. He played an April Fool's joke on fellow mathematics professors at Brown University by sending an email suggesting that students could be admitted randomly, along with references to bogus studies which purportedly suggested that there were benefits to having a certain population of the student body selected at random; the story was reported in the Brown Daily Herald. Colleagues such as mathematician Jeffrey Brock describe Schwartz as having a \"very wry sense of humor.\"\n\nIn 2003, Schwartz was teaching one of his young daughters about number basics and developed a poster of the first 100 numbers using colorful monsters. This project gelled into a mathematics book published in 2010, entitled You Can Count on Monsters for young children which became a bestseller. Each monster has a graphic which gives a mini-lesson about its properties, such as being a prime number or a lesson about factoring; for example, the graphic monster for the number five was a five-sided star or pentagram. He estimated that he wrote the book during 1000 hours. A year after publication, it was featured prominently on National Public Radio in January 2011 and became a bestseller for a few days on the online bookstore Amazon as well as earning international acclaim. The Los Angeles Times suggested that the book helped to \"take the scariness out of arithmetic.\" Mathematician Keith Devlin, on NPR, agreed, saying that Schwartz \"very skillfully and subtly embeds mathematical ideas into the drawings.\" \nHe's been compared to a mathematical version of Dr. Seuss.\n\nPublications\n\nSelected contributions\nThe quasi-isometry classification of rank one lattices:  Any quasi-isometry of a hyperbolic lattice is equivalent to a commensurator.\nA proof  of the 1989  Goldman–Parker conjecture:  This is a complete description of the moduli space of the complex hyperbolic ideal triangle groups.\nA proof that a triangle has a periodic billiard path provided all its angles are less than 100 degrees\nA solution of the 1960 Moser–Neumann problem:  There exists an outer billiards system with an unbounded orbit.\nA solution of the 5-electron case of  J.

      "text": "Corrado Segre (20 August 1863 – 18 May 1924) was an Italian mathematician who is remembered today as a major contributor to the early development of algebraic geometry.\n\n Early life \nCorrado's parents were Abramo Segre and Estella De Benedetti.\n\n Career \nSegre developed his entire career at the University of Turin, first as a student of Enrico D'Ovidio. In 1883 he published a dissertation on quadrics in projective space and was named as assistant to professors in algebra and analytic geometry. In 1885 he also assisted in descriptive geometry. He began to instruct in projective geometry, as stand-in for Giuseppe Bruno, from 1885 to 1888. Then for 36 years he had the chair in higher geometry following D'Ovidio. Segre and Giuseppe Peano made Turin known in geometry, and their complementary instruction has been noted as follows:Maurizio Avellone, Aldo Brigaglia & Carmela Zappulla (2002) \"The Foundations of Projective Geometry in Italy from De Paolis to Pieri\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences 56:363–425, esp 378\n\nThe Erlangen program of Felix Klein appealed early on to Segre, and he became a promulgator. First, in 1885 he published an article on conics in the plane where he demonstrated how group theory facilitated the study. As Hawkins says (page 252) \"the totality of all conics in the plane is identified with P5(C)\". The group of its projectivities is then the group that permutes conics. About Segre, Hawkins writesThomas Hawkins (2000) Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups: an essay in the history of mathematics, 1869 – 1926, Springer \n\nThe inspiring Geometrie der Lage (1847) of Karl Georg Christian von Staudt provided Segre with another project. He encouraged Mario Pieri to make a translation, Geometria di Posizione (1889), while Segre composed a biographical sketch of von Staudt that was included in the publication.\n\nSegre also expanded algebraic geometry by consideration of multicomplex numbers, in particular the bicomplex numbers. Segre's 1892 contribution to Mathematische Annalen shows him extending the work of William Rowan Hamilton and William Kingdon Clifford on biquaternions. But Segre was unaware of earlier study of tessarines that had anticipated his bicomplex numbers.\n\nIn English, the best known work of Segre is an inspirational essay meant for Italian students, translated by J.W. Young in 1904.Corrado Segre (1904) \"On some tendencies in geometric investigations\", translated by J. W. Young, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 10(9):442–68. It provides guidance and encouragement to young people studying mathematics.\n\nIn a 1926 memorial article, H.F. Baker called Segre the \"father of\" the Italian school of algebraic geometry.\n\nThe 1912 article \"Higher-dimensional Space\" (Mehr-dimensional RaumeCorrado Segre (1912) Mehrdimensionale Räume, Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften, weblink to University of Göttingen) for Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften spanned 200 pages. In admiration, Baker (1926) wrote and Coolidge (1927) reiterated\nFor completeness of detail, breadth of view, and generous recognition of the work of a host of other writers, this must remain for many years a monument of the comprehensiveness of the man.\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n .\n .\n \n \n .

Together with Federigo Enriques, he won the Bordin prize from the French Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe contributed in a major way to birational geometry, the theory of algebraic surfaces, in particular of the curves lying on them, the theory of moduli spaces and the theory of functions of several complex variables. He wrote prolifically, and some of his work has subsequently been shown to be not rigorous according to the then new standards set in particular by Oscar Zariski and David Mumford. At the personal level, according to  he was easily offended, and he was involved in a number of controversies. Most notably, he was a staunch supporter of the Italian fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and was included on a committee of academics that was to conduct an anti-semitic purge of all scholarly societies and academic institutions.

      "text": "Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich  (; 3 June 1923 – 19 February 2017) was a Russian mathematician who contributed to algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. He wrote books and articles that criticize socialism, and was an important dissident during the Soviet regime.\n\nShafarevich died on 19 February 2017 in Moscow, at the age of 93.\n\nWork in mathematics\nShafarevich made fundamental contributions to several parts of mathematics\nincluding algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic algebraic geometry. In algebraic number theory the Shafarevich–Weil theorem extends the commutative reciprocity map to the case of Galois groups which are extensions of abelian groups by finite groups.\nShafarevich was the first to give a completely self-contained formula for the pairing which coincides with the wild Hilbert symbol on local fields, thus initiating an important branch of the study of explicit formulas in number theory. Another famous result is Shafarevich's theorem on solvable Galois groups giving the realization of every finite solvable group as a Galois group over the rationals. Another fundamental result is the Golod–Shafarevich theorem on towers of unramified extensions of number fields.\n\nShafarevich and his school greatly contributed to the study of algebraic geometry of surfaces.\nHe initiated a Moscow seminar on classification of algebraic surfaces that updated around 1960 the treatment of birational geometry, and was largely responsible for the early introduction of the scheme theory approach to algebraic geometry in the Soviet school. His investigation in arithmetic of elliptic curves led him independently of John Tate to the introduction of the most mysterious group related\nto elliptic curves over number fields, the Tate–Shafarevich group (usually called 'Sha', written 'Ш', his Cyrillic initial). He introduced the Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula and the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion. He also formulated the Shafarevich conjecture which stated the finiteness of the set of Abelian varieties over a number field having fixed dimension and prescribed set of primes of bad reduction. This conjecture was proved by Gerd Faltings as a step in his proof of the Mordell conjecture.\n\nShafarevich was a student of Boris Delaunay, and his students included Yuri Manin, Alexey Parshin, Igor Dolgachev, Evgeny Golod, Alexei Kostrikin, Igor A. Kostrikin, Suren Arakelov, G. V. Belyi, Victor Abrashkin, Andrey N. Tyurin, and Victor Kolyvagin. He did major work in collaboration with Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro on K3 surfaces. He was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in the department of Mathematics, Physics and Earth Sciences.\nIn 1960 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1981 he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Society.\n\nOn his 80th birthday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed his \"fundamental research\" in mathematics, and his creation of \"a great science school known both in Russia and abroad\".Putin congratulates prominent academician on 80th birthday TASS June 3, 2003\n\nIn 2017, Shafarevich was awarded the  by the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nPolitical activities\nShafarevich came into conflict with the Soviet authorities in the early 1950s, but was protected by Ivan Petrovsky, the Rector of Moscow University. He belonged to a group of Pochvennichestvo-influenced dissidents who endorsed the Orthodox Christian tradition. Shafarevich published a book, The Socialist Phenomenon (French edition 1975, English edition 1980), which was cited by Solzhenitsyn in his 1978 address to Harvard University.\n\nIn the 1970s Shafarevich, with Valery Chalidze, Grigori Podyapolski and Andrei Tverdokhlebov, became one of Sakharov's human rights investigators, and was consequently dismissed from Moscow University. Shafarevich opposed political interference in universities. The algebraic geometer Miles Reid gives the example of Shafarevich asserting that plagiarism and poor work was being ignored in a doctorate obtained by a Communist Party functionary.\n\nThe Socialist Phenomenon\nShafarevich's book The Socialist Phenomenon,The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) Translated by William Tjalsma. Foreword by Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. 319 pp. New York: Harper & Row. which was published in the US by Harper & Row in 1980, analyzed numerous examples of socialism, from ancient times, through various medieval heresies, to a variety of modern thinkers and socialist states. From these examples he claimed that all the basic principles of socialist ideology derive from the urge to suppress individuality. The Socialist Phenomenon consists of three major parts:The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980). Contents.\n\n Chiliastic Socialism: Identifies socialist ideas amongst the ancient Greeks, especially Plato, and in numerous medieval heretic groups such as the Cathars, Brethren of the Free Spirit, Taborites, Anabaptists, and various religious groups in the English Civil War, and modern writers such as Thomas More, Campanella, and numerous Enlightenment writers in 18th-century France.The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) pp.7–79\n State Socialism: Describes the socialism of the Incas, the Jesuit state in Paraguay, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China.The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) pp.80–131\n Analysis: Identifies three persistent abolition themes in socialism – the abolition of private property, the abolition of the family, and the abolition of religion (mainly, but not exclusively Christianity)The Socialist Phenomenon, by Igor Shafarevich. (1980) pp.132–192\n\nShafarevich argued that ancient socialism (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was a reaction to the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire, and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through our relationship with God, and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic, unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of either pursuing death or life.\n\nReligious views\n\nShafarevich adhered to Russian Orthodox Christianity and incorporated the neo-Platonic views of Eastern Orthodoxy into his understanding of the relation of mathematics and religion.The Mathematical Experience, by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hirsch. (1981) pp. 52–55\n\nIn his talk to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences upon receiving a prize, Shafarevich presented his view of the relationship between mathematics and religion. He notes the multiple discoveries in mathematics, such as that of non-Euclidean geometry to suggest that pure mathematics reflects an objective reality, not a set of conventional definitions or a formalism. He claimed that mathematics' growth in itself is not directed or organic. In order to have a unity and direction mathematics needs a goal. This goal can either be set by practical applications or by God as the source of the direction of development. Shafarevich opted for the latter, as pure mathematics is not in itself driven by practical applications.Ueber einige Tendenzen in der Entwicklung der Mathematik, Jarhrbuch der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Goettingen. (1973) pp. 31–42\n\nIn Russian politics\n\nOn 21 December 1991 he took part in the first congress of the Russian All-People's Union headed by Sergei Baburin. In October 1992 he became a member of the founding committee of the National Salvation Front. In 1993 he was a candidate for the State Duma with Mikhail Astafyev's Constitutional Democratic Party - Party of Popular Freedom, but failed to get elected.\n\nShafarevich was a member of the editorial board of the magazine Nash Sovremennik, and in 1991–1992 of the editorial board of Den of Alexander Prokhanov (which ceased in October 1993, and later reopened under the title Zavtra). In 1994 he joined the \"All-Russian National Right Wing Centre\" chaired by Mikhail Astafyev.\n\nAccusations of antisemitism\n\nShafarevich's essay titled Russophobia, expanded into the book Three thousand year old mystery (Трехтысячелетняя загадка) resulted in accusations of antisemitism.Alexei Miller, The Communist Past in Post-Communist Russia, Eurozine, 2002-05-24.Veljko Vujacic, Russian Intellectual Anti-Semitism in the Post-Communist Era, Canadian Slavonic Papers, Mar–Jun 2004. He completed the Russophobia essay in 1982 and it was initially circulated as samizdat. In the USSR it was first officially published in 1989.\n\nIn the Russophobia essay he argued that great nations experience periods in their history when reformist elitist groups ('small nations') that have values that differ fundamentally from the values of the majority of the people, gain upper hand in the society. In Shafarevich's opinion, the role of such a 'small nation' in Russia was played by a small group of intelligentsiya dominated by Jews. They were full of hatred against traditional Russian way of life, playing an active role in the terrorist regimes of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.\n\nIts publication led to a request by the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to Shafarevich to resign his membership,Warren E. Leary, \"Alleging Bias, Science Group Urges Russian to Quit,\" The New York Times, July 29, 1992. because the NAS charter prohibited stripping an existing membership.Joan Birman, AMS Condemns Russophobia, The Scientist, 1993, 7(8):12.<ref>Semyon Reznik, On Shafarevich And NAS: Tolerance Vs. Indifference, The Scientist, 1993, 7(8):11.</ref> In an open letter to the NAS, Shafarevich denied that Russophobia is antisemitic. Shafarevich also noted that since NAS enlisted him without his request or knowledge, it is its internal matter to delist him as well. Nevertheless, when the United States invaded Iraq, Shafarevich faxed his resignation.\"The Steklov Legacy\", Ulf Persson, Baltic Worlds, Pages 34–38, Vol 1, 2011\n\nAccusations of anti-semitism have continued, involving Shafarevich's other publications.Шовинизм Шафаревича и Ко | Альтернативы Semyon Reznik targets the Russophobia essay for alleged factual inaccuracies, that Shafarevich misassigned Jewish ethnicity to a number of non-Jewish individuals involved in the execution of Nicholas II, perpetuating the false assertion that there was graffiti in Yiddish at the murder site, and suggested that Shafarevich's phrase \"Nicholas II was shot specifically as the Tsar, and this ritual act drew a line under an epoch in Russian history\" – may be read as blood libel.Семён Резник. Кровавый навет в России (An accusation which ignores the remainder of Shafarevich's sentence: \"so it can only be compared with the execution of Charles I in England or of Louis XVI in France\".) Aron Katsenelinboigen, wrote that Shafarevish's work \"lives up to the best traditions of anti-Semitic propaganda\".Aron J. Katsenelinboigen, The Soviet Union: Empire, Nation, and System (New Brunswick, New Jersey: 1990), page 176. http://aronkatsenelinboigen.net/Downloads/SovietUnion_empire_nation_system.htm\n\nLater, Shafarevich expanded on his views in his book \"Three thousand year old mystery\". In this article Shafarevich further claimed that Jews effectively marginalize non-Jews to the point of exclusion in all types of intellectual endeavors. This work was published in Russian in 2002; an introductory section explains the relationship with the Russophobia essay, explaining that the essay developed from an Appendix to an intended work of wider scope which he started writing in samizdat. http://shafarevich.voskres.ru/02.htm\n\nThe issue of Shafarevich's alleged anti-Semitism has been the subject of a 2009 doctoral thesis at the University of Helsinki, which was later turned into a book, in which the author, Krista Berglund, concludes that Shafarevich's views have been misconstrued as anti-Semitic.\n\nPublications\n\n \n \n Shafarevich, Igor (1975), \"Socialism in Our Past and Future.\" In From under the Rubble, with Solzhenitsyn, Alexander; Agursky, Mikhail; Barabanov, Evgeny; Borisov, Vadim; Korsakov, F.

He studies moduli problems in algebraic geometry, and ‘mirror symmetry’ — a phenomenon in pure mathematics predicted by string theory in theoretical physics.Richard Thomas FRS Biography\n\nEducation\nThomas obtained his PhD on gauge theory on Calabi–Yau manifolds in 1997 under the supervision of Simon Donaldson at the University of Oxford. Together with Donaldson, he defined the Donaldson–Thomas invariants of Calabi–Yau 3-folds, now a major topic in geometry and the mathematics of string theory.\n\nCareer and research\nBefore joining Imperial College, he was member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,https://www.ias.edu/scholars/richard-thomas and affiliated with Harvard University and the University of Oxford. He was made professor of pure mathematics in 2005.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/pictures/imperial_acad_proms_05.pdf\n\nThomas has made contributions to algebraic geometry, differential Geometry, and symplectic geometry. His doctoral thesis, which introduced the invariants that later became known as Donaldson-Thomas invariants, was published in the Journal of Differential Geometry as `A holomorphic Casson invariant for Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and bundles on K3 fibrations'.https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214341649 Motivated by homological mirror symmetry, he produced braid group actions on derived categories of coherent sheaves in joint work with Paul Seidel.https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1091737124 With Shing-Tung Yau he formulated a conjecture (now known as the Thomas–Yau conjecture) concerning the existence of a special Lagrangian in the Hamiltonian deformation class of a fixed Lagrangian submanifold of a Calabi–Yau manifold.https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/files/_fulltext/journals/cag/2002/0010/0005/CAG-2002-0010-0005-a008.pdf Together with Rahul Pandharipande he formulated a refinement of the Donaldson–Thomas invariants for the special case of curve counting, the Pandharipande–Thomas (PT) stable pair invariants. With Martijn Kool and Vivek Shende, he used the PT invariants to prove the Göttsche conjecture — a classical algebro-geometric problem going back more than a century.A short proof of the Göttsche conjecture  With Davesh Maulik and Pandharipande he proved the Katz–Klemm–Vafa (KKV) conjecture, establishing links between the Gromov-Witten theory of K3 surfaces and modular forms. His collaboration with Daniel Huybrechts led to contributions to the deformation theory of complexes. With Nick Addington he established a compatibility result for two rationality conjectures on cubic fourfolds.https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1404824304\n\nHe coauthored a book on mirror symmetry.http://www.claymath.org/library/monographs/cmim-1.pdf Thomas also wrote expository notes on derived categories, curve counting, and homological projective duality.

His work in developing a homotopy theory for algebraic varieties and formulating motivic cohomology led to the award of a Fields Medal in 2002. He is also known for the proof of the Milnor conjecture and motivic Bloch-Kato conjectures and for the univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory.\n\n Early life and education \n\nVladimir Voevodsky's father, Aleksander Voevodsky, was head of the Laboratory of High Energy Leptons in the Institute for Nuclear Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences. His mother Tatyana was a chemist. Voevodsky attended Moscow State University for a while, but was forced to leave without a diploma for refusing to attend classes and failing academically. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University in 1992 after being recommended without ever applying, following several independent publications; he was advised there by David Kazhdan.\n\nWhile he was a first year undergraduate, he was given a copy of Esquisse d'un Programme (submitted a few months earlier by Alexander Grothendieck to CNRS) by his advisor George Shabat. He learned the French language \"with the sole purpose of being able to read this text\" and started his research on some of the themes mentioned there.See the autobiographical story in \n\n Work \nVoevodsky's work was in the intersection of algebraic geometry with algebraic topology. Along with Fabien Morel, Voevodsky introduced a homotopy theory for schemes. He also formulated what is now believed to be the correct form of motivic cohomology, and used this new tool to prove Milnor's conjecture relating the Milnor K-theory of a field to its étale cohomology. For the above, he received the Fields Medal at the 24th International Congress of Mathematicians held in Beijing, China.The second medal at the same congress was received by Laurent Lafforgue\n\nIn 1998 he gave a plenary lecture (A1-Homotopy Theory) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. He coauthored (with Andrei Suslin and Eric M. Friedlander) Cycles, Transfers and Motivic Homology Theories, which develops the theory of motivic cohomology in some detail.\n\nFrom 2002, Voevodsky was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nIn January 2009, at an anniversary conference in honor of  Alexander Grothendieck, held at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, Voevodsky announced a proof of the full Bloch-Kato conjectures.\n\nIn 2009, he constructed the univalent model of Martin-Löf type theory in simplicial sets. This led to important advances in type theory and in the development of new Univalent foundations of mathematics that Voevodsky worked on in his final years. He worked on a Coq library UniMath using univalent ideas.\n\nIn April 2016, the University of Gothenburg awarded an honorary doctorate to Voevodsky.\n\nDeath and legacy \nVoevodsky died on 30 September 2017 at his home in Princeton, from an aneurysm.
