      "text": "{{distinguish|spherical angle}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2011}}\nIn [[geometry]], a '''solid angle''' (symbol: {{math|Ω}}) is a measure of the amount of the [[field of view]] from some particular point that a given object covers. That is, it is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer looking from that point.\nThe point from which the object is viewed is called the ''apex'' of the solid angle, and the object is said to ''[[Subtended angle|subtend]]'' its solid angle from that point.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), a solid angle is expressed in a [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[unit of measurement|unit]] called a ''[[steradian]]'' (symbol: sr). One steradian corresponds to one unit of area on the [[unit sphere]] surrounding the apex, so an object that blocks all rays from the apex would cover a number of steradians equal to the total [[surface area]] of the unit sphere, <math>4\\pi</math>. Solid angles can also be measured in squares of angular measures such as [[Square degree|degrees]], minutes, and seconds.\n\nA small object nearby may subtend the same solid angle as a larger object farther away. For example, although the [[Moon]] is much smaller than the [[Sun]], it is also much closer to [[Earth]]. Indeed, as  viewed from any point on Earth, both objects have approximately the same solid angle as well as apparent size. This is evident during a [[solar eclipse]].\n\n== {{anchor|Square minute|Square second}}Definition and properties ==\n{{See also|Spherical polygon area}}\nAn object's solid angle in [[steradian]]s is equal to the [[area (geometry)|area]] of the segment of a [[unit sphere]], centered at the apex, that the object covers. A solid angle in steradians equals the area of a segment of a unit sphere in the same way a planar [[angle]] in [[radian]]s equals the length of an arc of a [[unit circle]]; therefore, just like a planar angle in radians is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius, a solid angle in steradians is the following ratio:\n\n: <math>\\Omega=\\frac{A}{r^2}</math>\n\nwhere A is the spherical surface area and r is the radius of the considered sphere.\n\nSolid angles are often used in [[astronomy]], [[physics]], and in particular [[astrophysics]]. The solid angle of an object that is very far away is roughly proportional to the ratio of area to squared distance. Here \"area\" means the area of the object when projected along the viewing direction.\n\n[[Image:Steradian.svg|thumb|Any area on a sphere which is equal in area to the square of its radius, when observed from its center, subtends precisely one [[steradian]].]]\n\nThe solid angle of a sphere measured from any point in its interior is 4[[Pi|{{pi}}]]&nbsp;sr, and the solid angle subtended at the center of a cube by one of its faces is one-sixth of that, or {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|3}}&nbsp;sr. Solid angles can also be measured in [[square degree]]s (1&nbsp;sr = ({{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}})<sup>2</sup> square degrees), in [[square minute]]s and [[square second]]s, or in fractions of the sphere (1&nbsp;sr = {{sfrac|1|4{{pi}}}} fractional area), also known as [[spat (unit)|spat]] (1&nbsp;sp = 4{{pi}}&nbsp;sr).\n\nIn [[spherical coordinates#Integration_and_differentiation_in_spherical_coordinates|spherical coordinates]] there is a formula for the [[Differential of a function|differential]],\n\n: <math>d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\\,d\\varphi</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|θ}} is the [[colatitude]] (angle from the North pole) and {{mvar|φ}} is the longitude.\n\nThe solid angle for an arbitrary [[oriented surface]] S subtended at a point P is equal to the solid angle of the projection of the surface S to the unit sphere with center P, which can be calculated as the [[surface integral]]:\n\n: <math>\\Omega = \\iint\\limits_S \\frac{ \\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{n} \\,d\\Sigma }{r^2}\\ = \\iint\\limits_S \\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\\,d\\varphi</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\hat{r} = \\tfrac{\\vec{r} }{ r} </math> is the [[unit vector]] corresponding to <math> \\vec{r} </math>, the [[position vector]] of an infinitesimal area of surface {{math|''d''Σ}} with respect to point P, and where <math> \\hat{n} </math> represents the unit [[normal vector]] to {{math|''d''Σ}}. Even if the projection on the unit sphere to the surface S is not [[isomorphic]], the multiple folds are correctly considered according to the surface orientation described by the sign of the [[scalar product]] <math>\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{n}</math>.\n\nThus one can approximate the solid angle subtended by a small [[facet]] having flat surface area {{math|''d''Σ}}, orientation <math>\\hat{n}</math>, and distance {{math|''r''}} from the viewer as:\n\n: <math>d\\Omega = 4 \\pi \\left(\\frac{d\\Sigma}{A}\\right) \\, (\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{n})</math>\n\nwhere the [[surface area of a sphere]] is {{math|''A'' {{=}} 4π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\n==Practical applications==\n*Defining [[luminous intensity]] and [[luminance]], and the correspondent radiometric quantities [[radiant intensity]] and [[radiance]]\n*Calculating [[Spherical trigonometry#Area and spherical excess|spherical excess]] {{math|''E''}} of a [[spherical triangle]]\n*The calculation of potentials by using the [[boundary element method]] (BEM)\n*Evaluating the size of [[ligand]]s in metal complexes, see [[ligand cone angle]]\n*Calculating the [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] strength around charge distributions\n*Deriving [[Gauss's Law]]\n*Calculating emissive power and irradiation in heat transfer\n*Calculating cross sections in [[Rutherford scattering]]\n*Calculating cross sections in [[Raman scattering]]\n*The solid angle of the [[acceptance cone]] of the [[optical fiber]]\n\n== Solid angles for common objects ==\n\n=== Cone, spherical cap, hemisphere ===\n[[Image:Steradian cone and cap.svg|thumb|right|250px|Section of cone (1) and spherical cap (2) inside a sphere.

Define the vertex angle {{mvar|θ<sub>a</sub>}} to be the angle BOC and define {{mvar|θ<sub>b</sub>}}, {{mvar|θ<sub>c</sub>}} correspondingly. Let <math>\\phi_{ab}</math> be the [[dihedral angle]] between the planes that contain the tetrahedral faces OAC and OBC and define <math>\\phi_{ac}</math>, <math>\\phi_{bc}</math> correspondingly.

One source of potential errors is that the scalar triple product can be negative if {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}} have the wrong [[determinant|winding]]. Computing <code>abs(det)</code> is a sufficient solution since no other portion of the equation depends on the winding. The other pitfall arises when the scalar triple product is positive but the divisor is negative. In this case <code>atan</code> returns a negative value that must be increased by {{pi}}.\n\nAnother useful formula for calculating the solid angle of the tetrahedron at the origin O that is purely a function of the vertex angles {{mvar|θ<sub>a</sub>}}, {{mvar|θ<sub>b</sub>}}, {{mvar|θ<sub>c</sub>}} is given by [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier|L'Huilier]]'s theorem<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LHuiliersTheorem.html|title=L'Huilier's Theorem – from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2015-10-19|accessdate=2015-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalExcess.html|title=Spherical Excess – from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2015-10-19|accessdate=2015-10-19}}</ref> as\n\n: <math> \\tan \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\Omega \\right) =\n    \\sqrt{ \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right) \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\theta_s - \\theta_a}{2}\\right) \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\theta_s - \\theta_b}{2}\\right) \\tan \\left(\\frac{\\theta_s - \\theta_c}{2}\\right)} </math>\n\nwhere\n: <math> \\theta_s = \\frac {\\theta_a + \\theta_b + \\theta_c}{2} </math>\n\n===Pyramid===\nThe solid angle of a four-sided right rectangular [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] with [[apex (geometry)|apex]] angles {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} ([[dihedral angle]]s measured to the opposite side faces of the pyramid) is\n: <math>\\Omega = 4 \\arcsin \\left( \\sin \\left({a \\over 2}\\right) \\sin \\left({b \\over 2}\\right) \\right) </math>\n\nIf both the side lengths ({{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}) of the base of the pyramid and the distance ({{math|''d''}}) from the center of the base rectangle to the apex of the pyramid (the center of the sphere) are known, then the above equation can be manipulated to give\n\n: <math>\\Omega = 4 \\arctan \\frac {\\alpha\\beta} {2d\\sqrt{4d^2 + \\alpha^2 + \\beta^2}} </math>\n\nThe solid angle of a right {{mvar|n}}-gonal pyramid, where the pyramid base is a regular {{mvar|n}}-sided polygon of circumradius {{mvar|r}}, with a \npyramid height {{mvar|h}} is\n\n:<math>\\Omega = 2\\pi - 2n \\arctan\\left(\\frac {\\tan \\left({\\pi\\over n}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1 + {r^2 \\over h^2}}} \\right) </math>\n\nThe solid angle of an arbitrary pyramid with an {{math|''n''}}-sided base defined by the sequence of unit vectors representing edges {{math|{''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>}, ...

It may be used to compute point-of-aim for a [[fire-control]] problem when vehicle range and speed can be estimated from other information. Target angle may be best explained from the example of a [[submarine]] preparing to launch a straight-run (non-homing) [[torpedo]] at a moving target ship.  Since the torpedo travels relatively slowly, the torpedo course must be set not toward the target, but toward where the target will be when the torpedo reaches it. Target angle is used to estimate target course.<ref name =\"ipc\">{{cite web|url=http://navyadministration.tpub.com/12968a/css/12968a_25.htm|title=Target Angle|publisher=Integrated Publishing|accessdate=2012-11-26}}</ref>\n\nThe submarine observer estimating target angle pictures himself on the target ship looking back at the submarine. Relative bearing of the submarine is the clockwise angle in degrees from the heading of the target ship to a straight line drawn from the target ship to the submarine.<ref name =\"ipc\"/>\n\nWhen target angle is 0°&nbsp; (or 360°&nbsp;) the target ship is coming directly toward the submarine.\n\nTarget angles between 0°&nbsp; and 90°&nbsp; indicate the target ship is moving toward and to the right of the submarine.\n\nTarget angles between 90°&nbsp; and 180°&nbsp; indicate the target ship is moving to the right and away from the submarine.\n\nWhen target angle is 180°&nbsp; the target ship is moving directly away from the submarine.\n\nTarget angles between 180°&nbsp; and 270°&nbsp; indicate the target ship is moving away from and to the left of the submarine.\n\nTarget angles between 270°&nbsp; and 360°&nbsp; indicate the target ship is moving to the left and toward the submarine.\n\nA target passing a stationary observer from left to right might have target angles progressing from 45°&nbsp; to 135°&nbsp;, with broadside facing of 90°&nbsp; marking the minimum distance between target and observer.  A target moving from right to left on the same track would have target angles progressing downward from 315°&nbsp; to 225°&nbsp; with the closest point of approach occurring at 270°&nbsp;.\n\n==Angle on the bow==\nAngle on the bow is a variation of target angle used by [[United States Navy]] submarines.  Angle on the bow is measured over an arc of 180°&nbsp; clockwise from the bow if viewing the starboard side of the target, or counterclockwise from the bow if viewing the port side of the target.  Target angles from 0°&nbsp; to 180°&nbsp; are reported as \"starboard [''target angle'']\", while target angles from 180°&nbsp; to 360°&nbsp; are reported as \"port [360°&nbsp;-''target angle'']\".<ref name=\"stfcm\">Commander Submarine Force United States Atlantic Fleet ''Submarine Torpedo Fire Control Manual'' May 1950</ref>\n\nAngle on the bow provided the basis for submarine attack decisions through the [[World war#World wars of the 20th century|world wars]].  When angle on the bow was less than 90°&nbsp;, the submarine would continue a submerged approach toward the target to launch torpedoes when angle on the bow increased to 90°&nbsp; indicating the minimum range torpedo launch opportunity for the submarine with the given target course and speed.  Unless the target was already within torpedo range, angle on the bow greater than 90°&nbsp; required the submarine to attempt to surface and run around the target beyond visual range to submerge ahead of the target.  As a practical matter, the speed differential required to run around a target meant most [[warship]]s and [[ocean liner]]s could not be attacked when angle on the bow was greater than 90°&nbsp;.<ref name=\"stfcm\"/>\n\nEstimation of target angle is based on the observer's visual identification of target features like differentiating the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] from the [[stern]].

      "text": "{{About|measurement by the use of triangles}}\n{{distinguish| Trilateration}}\nIn [[trigonometry]] and [[geometry]], '''triangulation''' is the process of determining the location of a point by forming [[triangle]]s to it from known points.\n\nSpecifically in [[surveying]], [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]] per se involves only [[angle]] measurements, rather than measuring distances to the point directly as in [[trilateration]]; the use of both angles and distance measurements is referred to as [[wikt:triangulateration|triangulateration]].\n\n== Applications ==\nOptical 3D measuring systems use this principle as well in order to determine the spatial dimensions and the geometry of an item. Basically, the configuration consists of two sensors observing the item. One of the sensors is typically a digital camera device, and the other one can also be a camera or a light projector. The projection centers of the sensors and the considered point on the object's surface define a (spatial) triangle. Within this triangle, the distance between the sensors is the base ''b'' and must be known. By determining the angles between the projection rays of the sensors and the basis, the intersection point, and thus the 3D coordinate, is calculated from the triangular relations.\n\n==History==\nTriangulation today is used for many purposes, including [[surveying]], [[navigation]], [[metrology]], [[astrometry]], [[binocular vision]], [[model rocketry]] and gun direction of [[weapon]]s.\n\nThe use of triangles to estimate distances dates to antiquity. In the 6th century BC, about 250 years prior to the establishment of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], the Greek philosopher [[Thales]] is recorded as using [[similar triangles]] to estimate the height of the [[pyramids]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. He measured the length of the pyramids' shadows and that of his own at the same moment, and compared the ratios to his height (intercept theorem).<ref name=\"Life of Thales\">{{citation|last=[[Diogenes Laërtius]]|contribution=Life of Thales|title=The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlthales.htm|accessdate=2008-02-22}} I, 27</ref> Thales also estimated the distances to ships at sea as seen from a clifftop by measuring the horizontal distance traversed by the line-of-sight for a known fall, and scaling up to the height of the whole cliff.<ref>[[Proclus]], ''In Euclidem''</ref> Such techniques would have been familiar to the ancient Egyptians. Problem 57 of the [[Rhind papyrus]], a thousand years earlier, defines the ''seqt'' or ''seked'' as the ratio of the run to the rise of a [[slope]], ''i.e.'' the reciprocal of gradients as measured today.  The slopes and angles were measured using a sighting rod that the Greeks called a ''[[dioptra]]'', the forerunner of the Arabic [[alidade]].  A detailed contemporary collection of constructions for the determination of lengths from a distance using this instrument is known, the ''Dioptra'' of [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD), which survived in Arabic translation; but the knowledge became lost in Europe. In China, [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271) identified \"measuring right angles and acute angles\" as the fifth of his six principles for accurate map-making, necessary to accurately establish distances;<ref>[[Joseph Needham]] (1986).

      "text": "{{other uses|Triangulation}}\n[[File:Theb1604 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Triangulation of [[Kodiak Island]] in 1929.]]\n\nIn [[surveying]], '''triangulation''' is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring only [[angle]]s to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly as in [[trilateration]]. The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.\n\nTriangulation can also refer to the accurate [[surveying]] of systems of very large triangles, called '''triangulation networks'''. This followed from the work of [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] in 1615–17, who showed how a point could be located from the angles subtended from ''three'' known points, but measured at the new unknown point rather than the previously fixed points, a problem called [[Resection (orientation)|resectioning]]. Surveying error is minimized if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate scale is established first. Points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to it. Such triangulation methods were used for accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of [[global navigation satellite system]]s in the 1980s.\n\n== Distance to a point by measuring two fixed angles ==\n[[Image:Triangulation-boat.png|thumb|310px|]]Triangulation may be used to find the position of the ship when the positions of A and B are known. An observer at ''A''  measures the [[angle]] ''α'', while the observer at ''B'' measures ''β'' .(remember that in triangulation only one angle is measured)\n\nThe position of any vertex of a triangle can be calculated if the position of one side, and two angles, are known.  The following [[formulae]] are strictly correct only for a flat surface. If the curvature of the Earth must be allowed for, then   [[spherical trigonometry]] must be used.\n\n=== Calculation ===\nWith ''l'' being the distance between ''A'' and ''B'' we have:\n:<math> \\ell = \\frac{d}{\\tan \\alpha} + \\frac{d}{\\tan \\beta}</math>\n\nUsing the [[trigonometric identities]] tan&nbsp;α =&nbsp;sin&nbsp;α&nbsp;/&nbsp;cos&nbsp;α and sin(α&nbsp;+&nbsp;β) =&nbsp;sin&nbsp;α&nbsp;cos&nbsp;β&nbsp;+&nbsp;cos&nbsp;α&nbsp;sin&nbsp;β, this is equivalent to:\n:<math>\\ell= d \\left(\\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\sin \\alpha} + \\frac{\\cos \\beta}{\\sin \\beta}\\right)</math>\n\n:<math>\\ell = d\\ \\frac{ \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)}{\\sin\\alpha \\sin\\beta }</math>\ntherefore:\n:<math>d = \\ell\\ \\frac{ \\sin\\alpha \\sin\\beta }{ \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)}</math>\n\nFrom this, it is easy to determine the distance of the unknown point from either observation point, its north/south and east/west offsets from the observation point, and finally its full coordinates.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Sea island survey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liu Hui]] (c. 263), How to measure the height of a sea island.

But it was rare for such methods to be [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] (a manual on geometry, the eleventh century ''Geomatria incerti auctoris'' is a rare exception), and such techniques appear to have percolated only slowly into the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"Hill\" />  Increased awareness and use of such techniques in Spain may be attested by the medieval [[Jacob's staff]], used specifically for measuring angles, which dates from about 1300; and the appearance of accurately surveyed coastlines in the [[Portolan charts]], the earliest of which that survives is dated 1296.\n\n=== Gemma Frisius and triangulation for mapmaking ===\nOn land, the cartographer [[Gemma Frisius]] proposed using triangulation to accurately position far-away places for map-making in his 1533 pamphlet ''Libellus de Locorum describendorum ratione'' (''Booklet concerning a way of describing places''), which he bound in as an appendix in a new edition of [[Peter Apian]]'s best-selling 1524 ''Cosmographica''.  This became very influential, and the technique spread across Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.  The astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] applied the method in Scandinavia, completing a detailed triangulation in 1579 of the island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hven]], where his observatory was based, with reference to key landmarks on both sides of the [[Øresund]], producing an estate plan of the island in 1584.<ref>Michael Jones (2004), \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=_tsvf51Z4ocC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=portolan+triangulation&source=web&ots=ZrtTrVrU11&sig=iUMgeFF6fXDdfFStUWPLRyI5OOw&hl=en Tycho Brahe, Cartography and Landscape in 16th Century Scandinavia]\", in Hannes Palang (ed), European Rural Landscapes: Persistence and Change in a Globalising Environment, p.210</ref>  In England Frisius's method was included in the growing number of books on surveying which appeared from the middle of the century onwards, including [[William Cuningham]]'s ''Cosmographical Glasse'' (1559), Valentine Leigh's ''Treatise of Measuring All Kinds of Lands'' (1562), [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]]'s ''Rules of Navigation'' (1571), [[Thomas Digges]]'s ''Geometrical Practise named Pantometria'' (1571), and [[John Norden]]'s ''Surveyor's Dialogue'' (1607). It has been suggested that [[Christopher Saxton]] may have used rough-and-ready triangulation to place features in his county maps of the 1570s; but others suppose that, having obtained rough bearings to features from key vantage points, he may have estimated the distances to them simply by guesswork.<ref>Martin and Jean Norgate (2003), [http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/saxton1/sax1svy1.htm Saxton's Hampshire: Surveying], University of Portsmouth</ref>\n\n=== Willebrord Snell and modern triangulation networks ===\nThe modern systematic use of triangulation networks stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]], who in 1615 surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Breda]], approximately 72 miles (116 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell underestimated the distance by 3.5%. The two towns were separated by one degree on the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]], so from his measurement he was able to calculate a value for the circumference of the earth – a feat celebrated in the title of his book ''Eratosthenes Batavus'' (''The Dutch [[Eratosthenes]]''), published in 1617. Snell calculated how the planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the earth. He also showed how to [[Snellius–Pothenot problem|resection]], or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured much more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. This established the key idea of surveying a large-scale primary network of control points first, and then locating secondary subsidiary points later, within that primary network.\n\nSnell's methods were taken up by [[Jean Picard]] who in 1669–70 surveyed one degree of latitude along the [[Paris Meridian]] using a chain of thirteen triangles stretching north from [[Paris]] to the clocktower of [[Sourdon]], near [[Amiens]]. Thanks to improvements in instruments and accuracy, Picard's is rated as the first reasonably accurate measurement of the radius of the earth. Over the next century this work was extended most notably by the Cassini family: between 1683 and 1718 [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Jean-Dominique Cassini]] and his son [[Jacques Cassini]] surveyed the whole of the Paris meridian from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Perpignan]]; and between 1733 and 1740 Jacques and his son [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César Cassini]] undertook the first triangulation of the whole country, including a re-surveying of the [[meridian arc]], leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles.\n\nTriangulation methods were by now well established for local mapmaking, but it was only towards the end of the 18th century that other countries began to establish detailed triangulation network surveys to map whole countries. The [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]] was begun by the [[Ordnance Survey]] in 1783, though not completed until 1853; and the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India, which ultimately named and mapped [[Mount Everest]] and the other Himalayan peaks, was begun in 1801. For the Napoleonic French state, the French triangulation was extended by [[Jean Joseph Tranchot]] into the German [[Rhineland]] from 1801, subsequently completed after 1815 by the Prussian general [[Karl von Müffling]]. Meanwhile, the famous mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] was entrusted from 1821 to 1825 with the triangulation of the [[kingdom of Hanover]], for which he developed the [[least squares|method of least squares]] to find the best fit solution for problems of large systems of [[simultaneous equation]]s given more real-world measurements than unknowns.\n\nToday, large-scale triangulation networks for positioning have largely been superseded by the [[global navigation satellite system]]s established since the 1980s, but many of the control points for the earlier surveys still survive as valued historical features in the landscape, such as the concrete [[trig point|triangulation pillars]] set up for [[retriangulation of Great Britain]] (1936–1962), or the triangulation points set up for the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (1816–1855), now scheduled as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bilby tower]]\n* [[Multilateration]], where a point is calculated using the time-difference-of-arrival between other known points\n* [[Parallax]]\n* [[Resection (orientation)]]\n* [[SOCET SET]]\n* [[Stellar triangulation]]\n* [[Stereopsis]]\n* [[Trig point]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- not consulted, but probably useful-->\n* Bagrow, L.

(See [[visual system]]). For small angles, the size of this retinal image <math>R</math> is\n\n:<math>\\frac{R}{n} = \\tan V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>n</math> is the distance from the nodal points to the retina, about 17&nbsp;mm.\n\n==Examples==\nIf one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57°.  Thus they have the same retinal image size <math>R \\approx 0.17 \\text{ mm}</math>.\n\nThat is just a bit larger than the retinal image size for the moon, which is about <math>0.15 \\text{ mm}</math>, because, with moon's mean diameter <math>S = 3474\\text{ kilometers}</math> <math>(2159 \\text{ miles})</math> , and  earth to moon mean distance <math>D</math> averaging  <math>383,000 \\text{ kilometers}</math> (<math>238,000 \\text{ miles}</math>), <math>V \\approx 0.009 \\text{ rad}</math><math>\\approx 0.52 \\text{ deg}</math>.\n\nAlso, for some  easy observations, if one holds one's index finger at arm's length, the width of the index fingernail subtends approximately one degree, and the width of the thumb at the first joint subtends approximately two degrees.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = O'Shea | first = Robert P. | year = 1991 | title = Thumb's rule tested: Visual angle of thumb's width is about 2 deg | journal = [[Perception (journal)|Perception]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–418 | doi = 10.1068/p200415 | url = http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p200415 | pmid=1762884}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, if one is interested in the performance of the eye or the first processing steps in the [[visual cortex]], it does not make sense to refer to the absolute size of a viewed object (its linear size <math>S</math>). What matters is the visual angle <math>V</math> which determines the size of the retinal image.\n\n==Terminological confusions==\nIn astronomy the term ''apparent size'' refers to the physical angle <math>V</math> or [[angular diameter]].\n\nBut in [[psychophysics]] and [[experimental psychology]] the adjective \"apparent\" refers to a person's subjective experience.\nSo, \"apparent size\" has  referred to how large an object looks, also often called its \"perceived size\".\n\nAdditional confusion has occurred because there are two qualitatively different \"size\" experiences for a viewed object.<ref>Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985, Baird, 1970</ref> One is the perceived  visual angle <math>V'</math> (or apparent visual angle) which is the subjective correlate of <math>V</math>, also called the object's perceived or apparent angular size.\nThe perceived  visual angle is best defined as the difference between the perceived directions of the object's endpoints from oneself.<ref>Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985</ref>\n\nThe other \"size\" experience  is the object's perceived linear size <math>S'</math> (or apparent linear size) which is the subjective correlate of <math>S</math>, the object's physical width or height or diameter.\n\nWidespread  use of the ambiguous  terms \"apparent size\" and \"perceived size\" without specifying the units of  measure has caused confusion.\n\n==Representation of visual angle in visual cortex==\nThe brain's [[primary visual cortex]] (area V1 or Brodmann area 17) contains a spatially [[isomorphic]] representation of the retina (see [[retinotopy]]).  Loosely speaking,  it is a distorted \"map\" of the retina. Accordingly, the size <math>R</math> of a given retinal image determines the extent of the neural activity pattern eventually generated in area V1 by the associated retinal activity pattern. Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten (2006) recently used [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]  (fMRI) to show that an increase in a viewed target's visual angle, which increases <math>R</math>, also increases the extent of the corresponding neural activity pattern in area V1.\n\nThe observers in Murray 'et al.'s' experiment viewed a flat picture with two discs that subtended the same visual angle <math>V</math> and formed retinal images of the same size <math>R</math>, but the perceived angular size <math>V'</math> of one was about 17% larger than for the other, due to differences in the background patterns for the disks. It was shown that the areas of the activity in V1 related to the disks were of unequal size, despite the fact that the retinal images were the same size.  This size difference in area V1 correlated with the 17% illusory difference between the perceived visual angles. This finding has implications for spatial illusions such as the [[visual angle illusion]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = An Analysis of the Experiment by Murray, S. O., Boyaci, H., & Kersten, D.

It was superseded by the [[theodolite]] in the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=|title=Scientific Instruments, 1500-1900: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThXH7xmUskIC&pg=PA43|accessdate=3 July 2014|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21728-7|page=43}}</ref> \n\nA circumferentor consists of a circular [[brass]] box containing a magnetic needle, which moves freely over a brass circle, or [[compass]] divided into 360 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref name=\"Turner\"/><ref name=\"Nesbit\">{{cite book|last1=Nesbit|first1=Anthony |last2=Baker|first2=Thomas |title=A complete Treatise on practical Land-Surveying, etc. With an engraved \"Field-Book,\" being the notes on an estate in the Parish of Preston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIFaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA343|accessdate=3 July 2014|year=1855|pages=343–344}}</ref> The needle is protected by a glass covering. <ref name=\"Nesbit\"/> A pair of [[Sight (device)|sights]] is located on the North-South axis of the compass.<ref name=\"Turner\"/> Circumferentors were typically mounted on [[tripod]]s and rotated on [[ball-and-socket joint]]s.<ref name=\"Nesbit\"/>\n\nCircumferentors were made throughout Europe, including in England, France, Italy, and Holland. By the early 19th century, Europeans preferred theodolites to circumferentors. However, the circumferentor remained in common use in [[Mining|mines]] and in wooded or uncleared areas, such as in America.<ref name=\"Turner\"/><ref name=\"Nesbit\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n[[Image:Open angle with letters.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: Angle EKG]]\n[[Image:Figure 21, Table of Surveying, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|frame|right|Figure 2: Region ABCDEFGHK]]\n\n===Measuring angles===\nTo measure an angle with a circumferentor, such as angle EKG (Figure 1), place the instrument at K, with the [[fleur-de-lis]] in the card towards you. Then direct the sights, until through them you see E; and note the degree pointed at by the south end of the needle, such as 296°. Then, turn the instrument around, with the fleur-de-lis still towards you, and direct the sights to G; note the degree at which the south end of the needle point, such as 182°. Finally, subtract the lesser number, 182, from the greater, 296°; the remainder, 114°, is the number of degrees in the angle EKG.\n\nIf the remainder is more than 180 degrees, it must be subtracted from 360 degrees.\n\n===Surveying a region===\n\nTo take the plot of a field, forest, park, etc., with a circumferentor, consider region ABCDEFGHK in Figure 2, an area to be surveyed.\n\n#Placing the instrument at A, the fleur-de-lis towards you, direct the sights to B; where suppose the south end of the needle cuts 191°; and the ditch, wall, or hedge, measuring with a [[Gunter's chain]], contains 10 chains, 75 links.\n#Placing the instrument at B, direct the sights as before to C; the south end of the needle, ''e.g.'' will cut 279°; and the line BC contains 6 chains and 83 links.\n\nThen move the instrument to C; turn the sights to measure D, and measure CD as before. In the same manner, proceed to D, E, F, G, H, and lastly to K; still noting the degrees of every bearing, or angle, and the distances of every side. This will result in a table of the following form:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n!Station\n!Degrees\n!Min.\n!Chains\n!Link\n|-\n|A\n|191\n|00\n|10\n|75\n|-\n|B\n|297\n|00\n|6\n|83\n|-\n|C\n|216\n|30\n|7\n|82\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"|etc.\n|}\n\nFrom this table, the field is to be plotted, or protracted.\n\nAlternative plotting method:\n\nAn alternative way to plot the area in Figure 2 is to use several angles and only a few measurements and calculate their positions. \n\nThis could be done by starting at the center point in Figure 2 which is not labeled, but which will be referred to as \"Center.\" Assume each point can be seen from each other point. From the \"center\" point, sight and record the angle to each point using the sights as described above. Then move to, and measure the distance to, one of the other points referenced, such as point B. At point B, measure the angles to all the other points. Then, move to an additional point such as point F. Again, measure the distance from the center to the point chosen (F). At that point, measure and record the angles to each of the other points as was done at point B. Chose a scale (a ratio between the size of the area to be plotted and the size of the paper on which you will draw the plot) that will allow the plot to fit on your paper and plot the angles and distances.\n\nThe advantage of this method over the first one above is that there are fewer distance measurements and any errors in angles or distances will not be cumulative; that is, if you use the first survey method, any angle that is slightly off will distort the remainder of the plot. The second method can also be used when it is not possible to measure some of the distances, for example, if there is a water barrier between two of the points. Also, if there are any inaccuracies in the measurements, they will be revealed in the plot because the points plotted from various angles will not coincide.\n\nAdditional considerations include the number of times the circumferentor must be set up and aligned. With the first method, the instrument must be set up at each point with a compass. With the second method, the initial set up is at \"center.\" After that, for example at point B, the instrument can be set up by aligning the sight with the reciprocal of the angle between \"center\" and B. Thus, any local change in the magnetic field that would affect the compass would be nullified.\n\n==Surveyor's double prism==\n\n[[Image:Doppelpenta.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Double prism as used in surveying.]]\n\nA double prism is a device to measure right angles, consisting of two five sided prisms stacked on top of each other and a [[plumb-bob]]. It is used to stake out [[right angle]]s, for example on a [[construction]] site.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Graphometer]]\n*[[Alidade]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*{{1728}}\n*\"Circumferentor\".

      "text": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Goniometer IMG 4841.jpg|thumb|Goniometer made by Develey le Jeune in Lausanne, late 18th–early 19th century]]\n\nA '''goniometer''' is an instrument that either measures an angle or allows an object to be rotated to a precise angular position. The term '''goniometry''' is derived from two Greek words, ''[[Wikt:γωνία|gōnia]]'', meaning [[angle]], and ''[[Wikt:μέτρον#Ancient Greek|metron]]'', meaning [[Measurement|measure]].\n\nThe first description of a goniometer, derived from the [[astrolabe]], was apparently in 1538, by [[Gemma Frisius]].\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Goniometr-1900.png|thumb|right|Manual (1), and [[Eilhard Mitscherlich|Mitscherlich's]] optical (2) goniometers for use in crystallography, c. 1900]]\n\n===Surveying===\n\nPrior to the invention of the [[theodolite]], the goniometer was used in [[surveying]]. The application of triangulation to [[geodesy]] was described in the second (1533) edition of ''Cosmograficus liber'' by Petri Appiani as a 16-page appendix by Frisius entitled ''Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione''.<ref>Claude Brezinski and Dominique Tournès, ''André-Louis Cholesky: Mathematician, Topographer, and Army Officer'', Birkhäuser, Basel (2014) {{ISBN|978-3-319-08134-2}}</ref>\n\n===Communications===\nThe [[Bellini–Tosi direction finder]] was a type of [[radio direction finder]] that was widely used from [[World War I]] to [[World War II]]. It used the signals from two crossed antennas, or four individual antennas simulating two crossed ones, to re-create the radio signal in a small area between two loops of wire. The operator could then measure the angle to the target radio source by performing direction finding within this small area. The advantage to the Bellini–Tosi system is that the antennas do not move, allowing them to be built at any required size.\n\nThe basic technique remains in use, although the equipment has changed dramatically. Goniometers are widely used for military and civil purposes,<ref name=\"boucher\">{{cite web|title=Radio receiver workload accelerates|author=Jacqueline Boucher|date=2007-05-03|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/05/03/2975-radio-receiver-workload-accelerates/|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> e.g. interception of satellite and naval communications on the French warship [[French ship Dupuy de Lôme (A759)|Dupuy de Lôme]] uses multiple goniometers.\n\n===Crystallography===\nIn [[crystallography]], goniometers are used for measuring angles between crystal faces. They are also used in [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]] to rotate the samples. The groundbreaking investigations of physicist [[Max von Laue]] and colleagues into the [[crystal structure|atomic structure of crystals]] in 1912 involved a goniometer.\n\n===Light measurement===\n[[Goniophotometer]]s measure the spatial distribution of light visible to the human eye at a specific angular position.\n\n===In medicine===\nA goniometer is used to document initial and subsequent range of motion, at the visits for occupational injuries, and by [[disability]] evaluators to determine a permanent disability. This is to evaluate progress, and also for medico-legal purposes. It is a tool to evaluate [[Waddell's signs]] (findings that may indicate symptom magnification.)\n\n===Rehabilitative therapy===\nIn physical therapy, occupational therapy and athletic training, a goniometer is an instrument which measures [[range of motion]] joint angles of the body. This measurement instrument is a helpful, clinical tool that allows for objective measurements in order to accurately track progress in a rehabilitation program. When a patient has a decreased range of motion, a therapist will assess the joint before performing an intervention and will continue to use the tool to make sure that progress is made. These range of motion measurements can be taken at any joint and they typically involve some knowledge about the anatomy of the body, particularly bony landmarks. For example, when measuring the knee joint, the axis (point of rotation) would be placed on the lateral [[epicondyle]] of the femur, while the stationary arm would be lined up with the [[greater trochanter]] of the [[femur]]. Finally, the moveable arm of the goniometer would be lined up with the lateral [[malleolus]] of the [[fibula]] and a measurement will be taken using the degree scale on the circular portion of the tool. The only problem with goniometers is the [[accuracy]] of the reading is not always the greatest. Issues with the intra-measure (between measures) and inter-tester (between clinicians) [[data reliability|reliability]] seem to increase as the experience of the examiner decreases. Some studies suggest that these errors can be anywhere between 5 and 10 degrees when completing repeated measures{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}.\n\nThese goniometers do come in different forms that some would argue will actually increase the reliability of the tool.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Milanese|first1=Gordon|title=Reliability and concurrent validity of knee angle measurement: Smart phone app versus universal goniometer used by experienced and novice clinicians|journal=Manual Therapy|volume=5|pages=1–6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Sealey|title=Concurrent validity and reliability of the simple goniometer iPhone app compared with the universal goniometer|journal=Physiotherapy Theory and Practice|volume=30|issue=7|pages=512–516}}</ref> The universal standard goniometer is a plastic or metal tool with 1 degree increments. The arms usually are not longer than 12-inches so it can be hard to accurately pinpoint the exact landmark needed for measurement. A more reliable goniometer would be the telescopic-armed goniometer. There is a plastic circular axis as a classic goniometer but the arms extend out to as long as two feet in either direction.\n\nMore recently in the twenty-first century, [[smartphone]] application developers have created mobile applications that are intended to perform like a goniometer. These applications (such as Knee Goniometer and Goniometer Pro) use the accelerometers in phones to calculate the angles of the joints measured. There has been a lot of research recently that supports these applications and their devices as reliable and valid tools that have just as much accuracy as a universal goniometer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ockendon|first1=Matthew|title=Validation of a novel smartphone accelerometer-based knee goniometer|journal=The Journal of Knee Surgery|volume=25|issue=4|pages=341–345}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=A|title=Concurrent validity and reliability of the simple goniometer iphone app compared with the universal goniometer|journal=Physiotherapy Theory and Practice|date=2014|volume=30|issue=7|pages=512–516}}</ref><ref name=\"KueglerGoni15\">{{cite journal |title=Goniometer-apps in hand surgery and their applicability in daily clinical practice |journal=Safety in Health |author1=Kuegler, P. |author2=Wurzer, P. |author3=Tuca, A. |display-authors=etal |volume=1 |pages=11 |year=2015 |doi=10.1186/s40886-015-0003-4}}</ref>\n\nModern rehabilitative therapy motion capture systems perform goniometry at the very least measuring active range of motion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eumotus.com|title=Markerless Motion Capture. Biomechanical Analysis {{!}} EuMotus|website=www.eumotus.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>. While in some cases accuracy may be inferior to using a goniometer, measuring angles using a motion capture system is superior in providing measurement during dynamic, as opposed to static situations. Furthermore, use of a traditional goniometer takes valuable time. In the clinical context, performing manual measurements takes valuable time and may not be practical.\n\n===Surface science===\n\n====Contact angle goniometer====\n[[File:Rame-hart goniometer.jpg|thumb|Surface scientists use a contact angle goniometer to measure [[contact angle]], [[surface energy]] and [[surface tension]].]]\n[[File:Contact angle measurement with Attension Theta.png|left|alt=Contact angle measurement.|thumb|In a contact angle measurement, the angle between the droplet and solid surface indicates the wettability of the surface.]]\nIn [[surface science]], an instrument generally called a contact angle goniometer or [[tensiometer (surface tension)|tensiometer]] is used to measure the static [[contact angle]], advancing & receding contact angles, and in some cases surface tension. The first contact angle goniometer was designed by Dr. [[William Zisman]] of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and manufactured by ramé-hart (now ramé-hart instrument company), New Jersey, USA. The original manual contact angle goniometer used an eyepiece with microscope. Today's contact angle goniometer uses a camera and software to capture and analyze the drop shape and is better suited for dynamic and advanced studies.\n\n====Surface tension====\n[[File:WassermoleküleInTröpfchen.svg|thumb|150px|Surface tension exists because the molecules inside a liquid experience roughly equal cohesive forces in all directions, but molecules at the surface experience larger attractive forces toward the liquid than toward gas]]\n\n[[Contact angle]] goniometers (q.v.)can also determine the [[surface tension]] for any liquid in gas or the [[interfacial tension]] between any two liquids. If the difference in densities between the two fluids is known, the surface tension or interfacial tension can be calculated by using the pendant drop method. An advanced instrument often called a goniometer / tensiometer will include software tools to measure [[surface tension]] and [[interfacial tension]] using the pendant drop, inverted pendant drop, and sessile drop methods - in addition to [[contact angle]].\n\nA [[centrifugal adhesion balance]] is used to relate the contact angles to the adhesion of the drop to the surface.\n\nA [[gonioreflectometer]] is used to measure the reflectivity of a surface at a variety of angles.\n\n===Positioning===\n{{Main|Positioning goniometer}}\n[[File:Positioning goniometer stage.jpg|thumb|A miniature electro-mechanical goniometer stage. This type of stage is used primarily in the field of lasers and optics.]]\nA positioning goniometer or goniometric stage is a device used to rotate an object precisely about a fixed axis in space. It is similar to a [[linear stage]], however, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. Positioning goniometers typically use a [[worm drive]] with a partial worm wheel fixed to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base. The worm may be rotated manually or by a motor as in automated positioning systems.\n\n===Knife and blade cutting edge angle measurement===\nThe included cutting angles of all kinds of sharp edge blades is measured using a laser reflecting goniometer. Developed by the [[Cutlery and Allied Trades Research Association]] (CATRA) in the UK, a range of devices can accurately determine the cutting edge profile including a rounding of the tip to ½°. The included angle of a blade is important in controlling its cutting ability and edge strength, i.e. a low angle makes the edge thin and optimized for cutting while a large angle makes it thick, which cuts poorly, but is very strong.\n\n===Doctor blade inspection===\nUsed [[doctor blade]]s, from [[gravure]] and other [[printing]] and [[coating]] processes, may be inspected using a goniometer, typically with a built-in light source, to examine the blade edge to see whether the blade has worn at the desired angle and whether there are signs of wear at other angles. A difference in angle from that set on the machine may indicate excessive pressure, and a range of angles (\"rounding\") probably indicates a lack of stiffness, or wear, in the blade holder assembly.\n\n==See also==\n{{EB1911 poster|Goniometer}}\n*[[Instrumentation]]\n*[[Protractor]]\n*[[SCR-277]]\n*[[Trigonometry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.radarpages.co.uk/mob/ch/chainhome3.htm Reference for the famous Chain Home British Radar of WWII]\n*[http://stefanelli.eng.br/en/goniometer-degree-decimal-simulator.html Simulator of goniometer in degree]\n\n[[Category:Angle measuring instruments]]\n[[Category:Dimensional instruments]]\n[[Category:Laboratory equipment]]\n[[Category:Occupational therapy]]\n[[Category:Physical therapy]]\n[[Category:Surface science]]\n[[Category:Surveying instruments]]"

In its most basic form, a Jacob's staff is a stick or pole with length markings; most staffs are much more complicated than that, and usually contain a number of measurement and stabilization features. The two most frequent uses are:\n* in [[astronomy]] and [[navigation]] for a simple device to measure [[angle]]s, later replaced by the more precise [[sextant]]s;\n* in [[surveying]] (and scientific fields that use surveying techniques, such as [[geology]] and [[ecology]]) for a vertical rod that penetrates or sits on the ground and supports a compass or other instrument.\n\nThe simplest use of a Jacob's staff is to make qualitative judgements of the height and angle of an object relative to the user of the staff.\n\n==In astronomy and navigation==\nIn [[navigation]] the instrument is also called a '''cross-staff''' and was used to determine angles, for instance the angle between the horizon and [[Polaris]] or the [[sun]] to determine a vessel's [[latitude]], or the angle between the top and bottom of an object to determine the distance to said object if its height is known, or the height of the object if its distance is known, or the horizontal angle between two visible locations to determine one's point on a map.\n\nThe Jacob's staff, when used for astronomical observations, was also referred to as a '''radius astronomicus'''.  With the demise of the cross-staff, in the modern era the name \"Jacob's staff\" is applied primarily to the device used to provide support for surveyor's instruments.\n\n===History===\nThe origin of the name of the instrument is not certain.  Some refer to the Biblical patriarch [[Jacob]],<ref name=\"turnerASI\"/> specifically {{bibleverse||Gen|32:11|HE}}.<ref name=\"turnerASI\">Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Antique Scientific Instruments'', Blandford Press Ltd. 1980 {{ISBN|0-7137-1068-3}}</ref> It may also take its name after its resemblance to [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], referred to by the name of [[Jacob]] on some medieval [[star chart]]s.<ref name=\"wynter\">Harriet Wynter and Anthony Turner, ''Scientific Instruments'', Studio Vista, 1975,  {{ISBN|0-289-70403-0}}</ref><ref name=\"orion\">[http://www.maa.mhn.de/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/orion.html Orion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612163005/http://www.maa.mhn.de/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/orion.html |date=2007-06-12 }} This article indicates the three belt stars are sometimes called Jacob's Ladder or Jacob's Stick</ref> Another possible source is the Pilgrim's staff, the symbol of St James (Jacobus in Latin). The name ''cross staff'' simply comes from its [[cruciform]] shape.\n\nThe original Jacob's staff was developed as a single pole device in the 14th century that was used in making astronomical measurements.  It was first described by the French-Jewish mathematician [[Levi ben Gerson]]<ref>[http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~tsaban/Pdf/MathofLevi.pdf \"The Mathematics of Levi ben Gershon, the Ralbag\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.surveyhistory.org/jacob's_staff1.htm David G.

Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}</ref> states that its origins can be traced to the [[Chaldea]]ns around 400 [[Before Christ|BC]].\n\nAlthough it has become quite accepted that ben Gerson first described Jacob's staff, the British Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] theorizes that the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&ndash;1095), in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, described a Jacob's staff.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 573 575\">Needham, Joseph. (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Pages 573&ndash;575.</ref> Shen was an [[antiquarian]] interested in ancient objects; after he unearthed an ancient crossbow-like device from a home's garden in [[Jiangsu]], he realized it had a sight with a graduated scale that could be used to measure the heights of distant mountains, likening it to how mathematicians measure heights by using right-angle triangles.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 573 575\"/> He wrote that when one viewed the whole breadth of a mountain with it, the distance on the instrument was long; when viewing a small part of the mountainside, the distance was short; this, he wrote, was due to the cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the eye, while the graduation started from the further end. Needham does not mention any practical application of this observation.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 573 575\"/>\n\nDuring the medieval European [[Renaissance]], the Dutch mathematician and surveyor [[Metius]] is known to have developed his own Jacob's staff. Fellow Dutch mathematician [[Gemma Frisius]] is also known to have made improvements to this instrument. The German mathematician Johannes Müller, called [[Regiomontanus]], made the Jacob's staff in the 15th century to a popular instrument in geodesic and astronomical measurements.<ref>Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit. Band 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck. Cologne, 2010. p. 214.</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Jacobstaff.JPG|thumb|right|A Jacob's staff, from [[John Seller]]s' ''Practical Navigation'' (1672)]]\nIn the original form of the cross-staff, the pole or main staff was marked with [[graduation (instrument)|graduations]] for length.   The cross-piece (''BC'' in the drawing to the right), also called the ''transom'' or ''transversal'', slides up and down on the main staff.  On older instruments, the ends of the transom were cut straight across.  Newer instruments had [[brass]] fittings on the ends with holes in the brass for observation.  In [[marine archaeology]], these fittings are often the only components of a cross-staff that survive.<ref name=\"swanick\">Swanick, Lois Ann. ''An Analysis Of Navigational Instruments In The Age Of Exploration: 15th Century To Mid-17th Century'', MA Thesis, Texas A&M University, December, 2005</ref>\n\nIt was common to provide several transoms, each with a different range of angles it would measure.  Three transoms were common.  In later instruments, separate transoms were switched in favour of a single transom with pegs to indicate the ends.  These pegs mounted in one of several pairs of holes symmetrically located on either side of the transom.  This provided the same capability with fewer parts.<ref name=\"may\"/>  The transom on [[Gemma Frisius|Frisius]]' version had a sliding vane on the transom as an end point.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\n===Usage===\nThe navigator places one end of the main staff against his cheek just below his eye.  He sights the horizon at the end of the lower part of the transom (or through the hole in the brass fitting) (''B''), adjusting the cross arm on the main arm until the sun is at the other end of the transom (''C'').  The altitude can then be determined by reading the position of the transom on the scale on the main staff.  This value was converted to an angular measurement by looking up the value in a table.\n\n===Cross-staff for navigation===\n[[File:Cross-staff-MnM 11 NA 5-IMG 5989-black.jpg|thumb|Nautical cross-staff dated 1776, on display at [[Musée national de la Marine]], Paris.]]\nThe original version was not reported to be used at sea, until the [[Age of Discoveries]]. Its use was reported by [[João de Lisboa]] in his ''Treatise on the Nautical Needle'' of 1514.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Goldstein, B. R.|date=2011|journal=Aleph|volume=11|issue=2|pages=365–383|title=Levi ben Gerson and the Cross Staff Revisited|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~brg/pdfs/brg_v_5.pdf|doi=10.2979/aleph.11.2.365}}</ref>  [[Johannes Werner]] suggested the cross-staff be used at sea in 1514<ref name=\"may\"/> and improved instruments were introduced for use in navigation.  [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] introduced it to England in the 1550s.<ref name=\"turnerASI\"/>  In the improved versions, the rod was graduated directly in degrees.  This variant of the instrument is not correctly termed a ''Jacob's staff'' but is a cross-staff.<ref name=\"oxfordShipsAndSea\">''The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea'', Peter Kemp ed., 1976 {{ISBN|0-586-08308-1}}</ref>\n\nThe cross-staff was difficult to use.  In order to get consistent results, the observer had to position the end of the pole precisely against his cheek.  He had to observe the horizon and a star in two different directions while not moving the instrument when he shifted his gaze from one to the other.  In addition, observations of the sun required the navigator to look directly at the sun.  This could be a painful exercise and made it difficult to obtain an accurate [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] for the sun. Mariners took to mounting [[smoked glass|smoked-glass]] to the ends of the transoms to reduce the glare of the sun.<ref name=\"may\"/><ref>[[William Bourne (mathematician)|Bourne, William]], ''A Regiment for the Sea'', 1574</ref>\n\nAs a navigational tool, this instrument was eventually replaced, first by the [[backstaff]] or [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], neither of which required the user to stare directly into the sun, and later by the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and the [[sextant]].  Perhaps influenced by the backstaff, some navigators modified the cross-staff to operate more like the former.  Vanes were added to the ends of the longest cross-piece and another to the end of the main staff.  The instrument was reversed so that the shadow of the upper vane on the cross piece fell on the vane at the end of the staff.  The navigator held the instrument so that he would view the horizon lined up with the lower vane and the vane at the end of the staff.  By aligning the horizon with the shadow of the sun on the vane at the end of the staff, the elevation of the sun could be determined.<ref name=\"daumas\">Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}</ref>  This actually increased the accuracy of the instrument, as the navigator no longer had to position the end of the staff precisely on his cheek.\n\nAnother variant of the cross-staff was a [[Reflecting instrument#Joost van Breen's reflecting cross-staff|spiegelboog]], invented in 1660 by the Dutchman, Joost van Breen.\n\nUltimately, the cross-staff could not compete with the backstaff in many countries.  In terms of handling, the backstaff was found to be more easy to use.<ref name=\"dehilster\">[http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/crossstaff/index.html  Nicolàs de Hilster's web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311225816/http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/crossstaff/index.html |date=2014-03-11 }} Tests performed on various instruments are described.  In addition, de Hilster describes the handling characteristics found by the testers on the Nav List mailing list.</ref>  However, it has been proven by several authors that in terms of accuracy, the cross-staff was superior to the backstaff.<ref name=\"bruyns\">Bruyns, Willem Mörzer, ''The Cross-staff, History and development of a navigational instrument'', Nederlandsch Historisch Sheepvaart Museum, Amsterdam, and Walburg Instituut, Zutphen, Netherlands, 1994 {{ISBN|90-6011-907-X}}</ref>  Backstaves were no longer allowed on board [[Dutch East India Company]] vessels as per 1731, with octants not permitted until 1748.<ref name=\"bruyns\"/>\n\n==In surveying==\nIn [[surveying]] the ''Jacob's staff'', contemporaneously referred to as a ''jacob staff'', is a single straight rod or staff made of nonferrous material, pointed and metal-clad at the bottom for penetrating the ground.<ref>Rutstrum, ''The Wilderness Route Finder'', University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, pp. 47-55, 64-72</ref>  It also has a screw base and occasionally a ball joint on the mount, and is used for supporting a [[compass]], transit, or other instrument.<ref>Rutstrum, pp. 47-55, 64-72</ref>\n\nThe term ''cross-staff'' may also have a different meaning in the history of surveying.  While the astronomical cross-staff was used in surveying for measuring angles, two other devices referred to as a cross-staff were also employed.<ref name=\"turner\">Turner, Gerard L'E., ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}</ref>\n\n#'''Cross-head''', '''cross-sight''', '''surveyor's cross''' or '''cross''' - a drum or  box shaped device mounted on a pole.  It had two sets of mutually perpendicular sights. This device was used by surveyors to measure offsets.  Sophisticated versions had a compass and spirit levels on the top.  The French versions were frequently eight-sided rather than round.<ref name=\"turner\"/>\n#'''Optical square''' - an improved version of the cross-head, the optical square used two silvered mirrors at 45° to each other.  This permitted the surveyor to see along both axes of the instrument at once.<ref name=\"rankine\">Rankine, William J. M., ''A Manual of Civil Engineering'', Charles Griffin & Company (1926), p.21</ref>\n\nIn the past, many surveyor's instruments were used on a Jacob's staff.  These include:\n*Cross-head, cross-sight, surveyor's cross or cross\n*[[Graphometer]]\n*[[Circumferentor]]\n*[[Holland circle]]\n*[[Miner's dial]]\n*[[Optical square]]\n*[[Reflecting instrument#Types of sextants|Surveyor's sextant]]\n*[[Surveyor's target]]\n*[[Abney level]]\n\nSome devices, such as the modern optical targets for laser-based surveying, are still in common use on a Jacob's staff.\n\n===In geology===\nIn geology, the Jacob's staff is mainly used to measure stratigraphic thicknesses in the field, especially when [[Bed (geology)|bedding]] is not visible or unclear (e.g., covered outcrop) and when due to the configuration of an [[outcrop]], the apparent and real thicknesses of beds diverge therefore making the use of a tape measure difficult. There is a certain level of error to be expected when using this tool, due to the lack of an exact reference mean for measuring stratigraphic thickness. High-precision designs include a laser able to slide vertically along the staff and to rotate on a plane parallel to bedding.<ref>Patacci, M.

It is a special case of the [[slope]], where zero indicates [[horizontal plane|horizontality]]. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of \"tilt\". Often slope is calculated as a ratio of \"rise\" to \"run\", or as a fraction (\"rise over run\") in which ''run'' is the horizontal distance (not the distance along the slope) and ''rise'' is the vertical distance.\n\nThe grades or slopes of existing physical features such as [[canyon]]s and hillsides, [[River bank|stream and river banks]] and [[stream bed|bed]]s are often described. Grades are typically specified for new linear constructions (such as roads, [[landscape]] grading, [[roof pitch]]es, [[Rail tracks|railroad]]s, [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], and pedestrian or bicycle circulation routes). The grade may refer to the [[Geometric_terms_of_location|longitudinal]] slope or the [[Geometric_terms_of_location|perpendicular]] [[cross slope|cross]] slope.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Slope quadrant.svg|thumb|upright=1.8 |Illustration of grades (percentages), angles in degrees and ratio.]]\n\nThere are several ways to express slope:\n# as an ''angle'' of inclination to the horizontal. (This is the angle α opposite the \"rise\" side of a triangle with a right angle between vertical rise and horizontal run.)\n# as a ''[[Percent sign|percentage]]'', the formula for which is <math> 100 \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}</math> which could also be expressed as the tangent of the angle of inclination times 100. In the U.S., this percentage \"grade\" is the most commonly used unit for communicating slopes in transportation (streets, roads, [[highway]]s and [[Track (rail transport)|rail tracks]]), surveying, construction, and civil engineering.\n# as a ''[[per mille]]'' figure, the formula for which is <math> 1000 \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}</math> which could also be expressed as the tangent of the angle of inclination times 1000. This is commonly used in Europe to denote the incline of a railway.\n# as a ''ratio'' of one part rise to so many parts run. For example, a slope that has a rise of 5 feet for every 100 feet of run would have a slope ratio of 1 in 20.  (The word \"in\" is normally used rather than the mathematical ratio notation of \"1:20\"). This is generally the method used to describe railway grades in Australia and the UK. It is used for roads in Hong Kong, and was used for roads in the UK until the 1970s.\n# as a ''ratio'' of many parts run to one part rise, which is the inverse of the previous expression (depending on the country and the industry standards). For example, \"slopes are expressed as ratios such as 4:1. This means that for every 4 units (feet or meters) of horizontal distance there is a 1-unit (foot or meter) vertical change either up or down.\"<ref>page 71, \"SLOPES EXPRESSED AS RATIOS AND DEGREES\" in Site Engineering For Landscape Architects 6th Edition. (c)2013, Steven Strom, Kurt Nathan, & Jake Woland. Wiley Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1118090862}}</ref>\n\nAny of these may be used. Grade is usually expressed as a percentage, but this is easily converted to the angle α by taking the inverse tangent of the standard math slope, which is rise/run or the grade/100.  If one looks at red numbers on the chart specifying grade, one can see the quirkiness of using the grade to specify slope; the numbers go from 0 for flat, to 100% at 45 degrees, to infinity as it approaches vertical.\n\nSlope may still be expressed when the horizontal run is not known: the rise can be divided by the [[hypotenuse]] (the slope length).  This is not the usual way to specify slope; this nonstandard expression follows the [[sine]] function rather than the tangent function, so it calls a 45-degree slope a 71-percent grade instead of a 100-percent. But in practice the usual way to calculate slope is to measure the distance along the slope and the vertical rise, and calculate the horizontal run from that, in order to calculate the grade (100% x rise/run) or standard slope (rise/run).  When the angle of inclination is small, using the slope length rather than the horizontal displacement (i.e., using the sine of the angle rather than the tangent) makes only an insignificant difference and can then be used as an approximation. Railway gradients are often expressed in terms of the rise in relation to the distance along the track as a practical measure.  In cases where the difference between sin and tan is significant, the tangent is used. In any case, the following identity holds for all inclinations up to 90 degrees:\n<math>\\tan{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\sin{\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2{\\alpha}}}</math>.  Or more simply, one can calculate the horizontal run by using the Pythagorean theorem, after which it is trivial to calculate the (standard math) slope or the grade (percentage).\n\nIn Europe, road gradients are signed as a percentage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/traffic-signs|title=Traffic signs - The Highway Code - Guidance - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref>\n\n===Equations===\nGrades are related using the following equations with symbols from the figure at top.\n\n====Tangent as a ratio====\n:<math>\\tan{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\Delta h}{d}</math>\nThis ratio can also be expressed as a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n\n====Angle from a tangent gradient====\n:<math>\\alpha = \\arctan \\quad{\\frac{\\Delta h}{d}}</math>\n\nIf the tangent is expressed as a percentage, the angle can be determined as:\n:<math>\\alpha = \\arctan{\\frac{\\%\\,\\text{slope}}{100}}</math>\n\nIf the angle is expressed as a ratio ''(1 in n)'' then:\n:<math>\\alpha = \\arctan{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>\n\n== Roads ==\nIn [[vehicle|vehicular]] [[engineering]], various [[landform|land]]-based designs ([[automobiles]], [[sport utility vehicle]]s, [[truck]]s, [[train]]s, etc.) are rated for their ability to ascend [[terrain]].

The highest grade a vehicle can ascend while maintaining a particular speed is sometimes termed that vehicle's \"gradeability\" (or, less often, \"grade ability\").

So, for example, \"northeast by east\" means \"one quarter from NE towards E\", \"southwest by south\" means \"one quarter from SW towards S\", etc.\n\nIn summary, the '''32-wind compass rose''' is yielded from the eight '''principal winds''', eight '''half-winds''' and sixteen '''quarter-winds''' combined together, with each compass direction point at an {{frac|11|1|4}}° angle from the next.\n\nIn the mariner's exercise of '''boxing the compass''', all thirty-two points of the [[compass]] are named in [[clockwise]] order.<ref>George Payn Quackenbos A Natural Philosophy: Embracing the Most Recent Discoveries  1860 \"Mentioning the mariner's compass: the points of the compass in their order is called boxing the compass. — The compass box is suspended within a larger box by means of two brass hoops, or gimbals as they are called, supported at opposite ...\"</ref>\n\n== Traditional names ==\nThe traditional compass rose of eight winds (and its 16-wind and 32-wind derivatives) was invented by seafarers in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (with no obvious connection to the twelve [[classical compass winds]] of the ancient Greeks and Romans). The traditional mariner's wind names were expressed in [[Italian language|Italian]], or more precisely, the Italianate  [[Mediterranean lingua franca]] common among sailors in the 13th and 14th centuries, which was principally composed of Genoese ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]]), mixed with [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]] terms from around the Mediterranean basin.\n\n[[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|400px|32-wind compass with traditional names (and traditional colour code)]]\nThis Italianate [[patois]] was used to designate the names of the principal winds on the compass rose found in mariners' compasses and [[portolan chart]]s of the 14th and 15th centuries. The \"traditional\" names of the eight principal winds are:\n* (N) – ''Tramontana''\n* (NE) – ''Greco''  (or ''[[Bora (wind)|Bora]]'' in some Venetian sources)\n* (E) – ''Levante'' (sometimes ''Oriente'')\n* (SE) – ''Scirocco'' (or ''Exaloc'' in Catalan)\n* (S) – ''Ostro'' (or  ''Mezzogiorno'' in Venetian)\n* (SW) – ''Libeccio'' (or ''Garbino'', ''Eissalot'' in Provençal)\n* (W) – ''Ponente'' (or ''Zephyrus'' in Greek)\n* (NW) – ''Maestro'' (or ''Mistral'' in Provençal)\n\nLocal spelling variations are far more numerous than listed, e.g. Tramutana, Gregale, Grecho, Sirocco, Xaloc, Lebeg, Libezo, Leveche, Mezzodi, Migjorn, Magistro, Mestre, etc. Traditional compass roses will typically have the initials T, G, L, S, O, L, P, and M on the main points. Portolan charts also colour-coded the compass winds: black for the eight principal winds, green for the eight half-winds, and red for the sixteen quarter-winds.\n\nEach half-wind name is simply a combination of the two principal winds that it bisects, with the shortest name usually placed first, for example: NNE is \"Greco-Tramontana\"; ENE is \"Greco-Levante\"; SSE is \"Ostro-Scirocco\", etc. The quarter winds are expressed with an Italian phrase, \"''Quarto di ''X'' verso ''Y\" ({{IPA-it|ˈkwarto di ''X'' ˈvɛrso ''Y''|pron}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/quarto|title=quarto|website=WordReference.com|quote=English translation: fourth, quarter|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/di|title=di|website=WordReference.com|quote=English translation: of, from...|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/verso|title=verso|website=WordReference.com|quote=English translation: towards, toward, close to, near to|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> one quarter from X towards Y),  or \"X ''al'' Y\" (X to Y) or \"X ''per'' Y\" (X by Y).

Chambers ''Cyclopaedia: or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Science'', 5th Ed, 1743, pp.&nbsp;206–7, \"Points ''of the Compass'', or ''Horizon'', &c., in Geography and Navigation, are the points of division when the whole circle, quite around, is divided into 32 equal parts. These points are therefore at the distance of the 32d part of the circult, or 11°&thinsp;15′, from each other; hence 5°&thinsp;{{sfrac|37|1|2}}′ is the distance of the half points and 2°&thinsp;{{sfrac|48|3|4}}′ is the distance of the quarter points.</ref>\nThese fractional points are named by appending, for example {{sfrac|1|4}}east, {{sfrac|1|2}}east, or {{sfrac|3|4}}east to the name of one of the 32 points. Each of the 96 fractional points can be named in two ways, depending on which of the two adjoining whole points is used, for example, N{{sfrac|3|4}}E is equivalent to NbE{{sfrac|1|4}}N. Either form is easily understood but alternative conventions as to correct usage developed in different countries and organisations. \"It is the custom in the United States Navy to box ''from'' north and south ''toward'' east and west, with the exception that divisions adjacent to a cardinal or inter-cardinal point are always referred to that point.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=American Practical Navigator: An Epitome of Navigation and Nautical Astronomy |author-last=Bowditch |author-first=Nathaniel |publisher=United States Hydrographic Office |year=1916 |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanpracnavi00bowdrich}}</ref> The Royal Navy used the additional \"rule that quarter points were never read from a point beginning and ending with the same letter.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |editor-last=Kemp |editor-first=Peter |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-282084-2 |contribution=Box the Compass |page=103}}</ref>\n\nCompass roses very rarely named the fractional points and only showed small, unlabelled markers as a guide for helmsmen.\n\n===128 compass directions===\nThe table below shows how each of the 128 directions are named. The first two columns give the number of points and degrees clockwise from north. The third gives the equivalent bearing to the nearest degree from north or south towards east or west. The \"CW\" column gives the fractional-point bearings increasing in the [[clockwise]] direction and \"CCW\" [[counterclockwise]]. The final three columns show three common naming conventions: No \"by\" avoids the use of \"by\" with fractional points; \"USN\" is the system used by the US Navy; and \"RN\" is the Royal Navy system. Colour coding shows whether each of the three naming systems matches the \"CW\" or \"CCW\" column.\n\n:::{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Points !!

Since one degree is {{sfrac|1|360}} of a [[turn (geometry)|turn]] (or complete rotation), one minute of arc is {{sfrac|1|{{val|21,600}}}} of a turn.  The [[nautical miles|nautical mile]] was originally defined as a minute of latitude on a hypothetical spherical Earth so the actual Earth circumference is very near 21 600 nautical miles.  A minute of arc is {{sfrac|{{pi}}|{{val|10,800}}}} of a [[radian]].\n\nA '''second of arc''', '''arcsecond''' (arcsec), or '''arc second''' is {{sfrac|1|60}} of an arcminute, {{sfrac|1|{{val|3,600}}}} of a degree, {{sfrac|1|{{val|1,296,000}}}} of a turn, and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|{{val|648,000}}}} (about {{sfrac|1|{{val|206,265}}}}) of a radian.\nThese units originated in [[Babylonian astronomy]] as [[sexagesimal]] subdivisions of the degree; they are used in fields that involve very small angles, such as [[astronomy]], [[optometry]], [[ophthalmology]], [[optics]], [[navigation]], [[land surveying]], and [[marksmanship]].\n\nTo express even smaller angles, standard [[SI prefix]]es can be employed; the '''milliarcsecond''' (mas) and '''microarcsecond''' (μas), for instance, are commonly used in astronomy.\n\nThe number of square arcminutes in a complete sphere is <math>4 \\pi \\left(\\frac{10\\,800}{\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{466\\,560\\,000}{\\pi} \\approx </math> {{val|148,510,660}} square arcminutes (the surface area of a unit sphere in square units divided by the solid angle area subtended by a square arcminute, also in square units – so that the final result is a dimensionless number).\n\nThe names \"minute\" and \"second\" have nothing to do with the identically named units of time \"[[minute]]\" or \"[[second]]\". The identical names reflect the ancient [[Babylonian number system]], based on the number 60.<ref>Volume Library Vol. 1, Southwestern</ref>\n\n==Symbols and abbreviations==\nThe standard<ref name=\"ASME Y14.5-2009 Dimension PDF\">{{cite web |url=http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~far/ME481/Dimensioing%20Rules%20From%20Standard.pdf |title=ASME Y14.5-2009 Dimensioning |access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> symbol for marking the arcminute is the [[prime (symbol)|prime]] (′) (U+2032), though a single quote (') (U+0027) is commonly used where only [[ASCII]] characters are permitted.

For example, if the \"Moon: max.\" circle is 10&nbsp;cm wide on a monitor, viewing it from 10.3&nbsp;m away will show true representation of the sizes.]]\n\nSince antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in [[astronomy]]. In the [[ecliptic coordinate system]], latitude (β) and longitude (λ); in the [[Horizontal coordinate system|horizon system]], altitude (Alt) and [[azimuth]] (Az); and in the [[equatorial coordinate system]], [[declination]] (δ), are all measured in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. The principal exception is [[right ascension]] (RA) in equatorial coordinates, which is measured in time units of hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nThe arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets (e.g. the angular diameter of Venus which varies between 10″ and 60″), the [[proper motion]] of stars, the separation of components of [[binary star system]]s, and [[parallax]], the small change of position of a star in the course of a year or of a solar system body as the Earth rotates. These small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds (mas), or thousandths of an arcsecond. The unit of distance, the [[parsec]], named from the ''par''allax of one arc ''sec''ond, was developed for such parallax measurements. It is the distance at which the mean radius of the Earth's orbit would subtend an angle of one arcsecond.\n\nThe ESA [[astrometry|astrometric]] space probe [[Gaia mission|Gaia]], launched in 2013, can approximate star positions to 7 microarcseconds (µas).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37355154|title=Celestial mapper plots a billion stars|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2016-09-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nApart from the Sun, the star with the largest [[angular diameter]] from Earth is [[R Doradus]], a [[red giant]] with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond.{{efn|Some studies have shown a larger angular diameter for [[Betelgeuse]]. Various studies have produced figures of between 0.042 and 0.069 arcseconds for the star's diameter. The variability of Betelgeuse and difficulties in producing a precise reading for its angular diameter make any definitive figure conjectural.}} Because of the effects of atmospheric [[astronomical seeing|seeing]], ground-based [[telescope]]s will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond; in poor seeing conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more. The dwarf planet [[Pluto]] has proven difficult to resolve because its [[angular diameter]] is about 0.1 arcsecond.<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html NASA.gov] Pluto Fact Sheet</ref>{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}\n\nSpace telescopes are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere but are [[Diffraction limit#Diffraction limit of telescopes|diffraction limited]]. For example, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1″. Techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground. [[Adaptive optics]], for example, can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10&nbsp;m class telescope.\n\n===Cartography===\n\nMinutes (′) and seconds (″) of arc are also used in [[cartography]] and [[navigation]]. At [[sea level]] one minute of arc along the [[equator]] or a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (indeed, any [[great circle]]) equals exactly one [[geographical mile]] along the Earth's equator or approximately one [[nautical mile]] (1852 meters, or ≈1.15078 [[statute mile]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oceannavigator.com/January-February-2003/Nautical-mile-approximates-an-arcminute/ |title=Nautical mile approximates an arcminute |date=January 1, 2003 |first=George H. |last=Kaplan |magazine=Ocean Navigator |publisher=Navigator Publishing |access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref> A second of arc, one sixtieth of this amount, is roughly 30 meters or 100 feet. The exact distance varies along [[meridian arc]]s because the [[figure of the Earth]] is slightly [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] (bulges a third of a percent at the equator).\n\nPositions are traditionally given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of arcs for [[latitude]], the arc north or south of the equator, and for [[longitude]], the arc east or west of the [[Prime Meridian]]. Any position on or above the Earth's [[reference ellipsoid]] can be precisely given with this method. However, when it is inconvenient to use  [[radix|base]]-60 for minutes and seconds, positions are frequently expressed as decimal fractional degrees to an equal amount of precision. Degrees given to three decimal places ({{sfrac|1|{{val|1000}}}} of a degree) have about {{sfrac|1|4}} the precision of degrees-minutes-seconds ({{sfrac|1|{{val|3600}}}} of a degree) and specify locations within about 120 meters or 400 feet.\n\n===Property cadastral surveying===\n\nRelated to cartography, property boundary [[surveying]] using the [[metes and bounds]] system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines' angles in reference to [[cardinal direction]]s. A boundary \"mete\" is described with a beginning reference point, the cardinal direction North or South followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction, and a linear distance. The boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point, the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction. For example, ''North&nbsp;65°&nbsp;39′ 18″ West&nbsp;85.69&nbsp;feet'' would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65° 39′ 18″ (or 65.655°) away from north toward the west.\n\n===Firearms===\n[[File:Ballistic table for 7.62x51 mm NATO (mil and moa).png|thumb|right|Example ballistic table for a given [[7.62×51mm NATO]] load. Bullet drop and wind drift are shown both in [[milliradian|mil]] and minute of angle.]]\n\nThe arcminute is commonly found in the [[firearm]]s industry and literature, particularly concerning the accuracy of [[rifle]]s, though the industry refers to it as '''minute of angle''' (MOA). It is especially popular with shooters familiar with the [[imperial measurement system]] because 1&nbsp;MOA is [[subtend]]ed by a sphere with a diameter of 1.047 [[inch]]es at 100 [[yard]]s (2.908&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m), a traditional distance on U.S. [[Shooting range|target ranges]]. The subtension is linear with the distance, for example, at 500 yards, 1&nbsp;MOA is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 5.235 inches, and at 1000 yards 1&nbsp;MOA is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 10.47 inches.\nSince many modern [[telescopic sight]]s are adjustable in half ({{sfrac|1|2}}), quarter ({{sfrac|1|4}}), or eighth ({{sfrac|1|8}}) MOA increments, also known as ''clicks'', zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2, 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.\n\nFor example, if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards (which for instance could be measured by using a [[spotting scope]] with a calibrated reticle), the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down, and 1.5 MOA right. Such adjustments are trivial when the scope's adjustment dials have a MOA scale printed on them, and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that ''click'' in fractions of MOA. This makes zeroing and adjustments much easier:\n* To adjust a {{frac|1|2}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 × 2 = 6 clicks down and 1.5 x 2 = 3 clicks right\n* To adjust a {{frac|1|4}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 4 = 12 clicks down and 1.5 × 4 = 6 clicks right\n* To adjust a {{frac|1|8}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 8 = 24 clicks down and 1.5 × 8 = 12 clicks right\n\nAnother common system of measurement in firearm scopes is the [[milliradian]] or mil. Zeroing a mil based scope is easy for users familiar with [[decimal|base ten]] systems. The most common adjustment value in mil based scopes is {{sfrac|1|10}} mil (which approximates {{frac|1|3}} MOA).\n* To adjust a {{sfrac|1|10}} mil scope 0.9 mil down and 0.4 mil right, the scope needs to be adjusted 9 clicks down and 4 clicks right (which equals approximately 3 and 1.5 MOA respectively).\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that some MOA scopes, including some higher-end models,{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 MOA on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards, rather than the mathematically correct 1.047\". This is commonly known as the Shooter's MOA (SMOA) or Inches Per Hundred Yards (IPHY). While the difference between one true MOA and one SMOA is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mann |first=Richard |url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/6227/mil-moa-or-inches/ |title=Mil, MOA or inches? |publisher=Shooting Illustrated |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2015-04-13}}</ref> this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 20–30 MOA to compensate for the bullet drop. If a shot requires an adjustment of 20 MOA or more, the difference between true MOA and SMOA will add up to 1 inch or more. In competitive target shooting, this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.\n\nThe physical group size equivalent to ''m'' minutes of arc can be calculated as follows: group size = tan({{sfrac|''m''|60}})&nbsp;×&nbsp;distance. In the example previously given, for 1 minute of arc, and substituting 3,600&nbsp;inches for 100 yards, 3,600 tan({{sfrac|1|60}}) ≈ 1.047&nbsp;inches. In [[metric units]] 1 MOA at 100 meters ≈ 2.908 centimeters.\n\nSometimes, a precision firearm's accuracy will be measured in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions i.e. no wind, match-grade ammo, clean barrel, and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error, the gun is capable of producing a [[shot grouping|group of shots]] whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example, a ''1 MOA rifle'' should be capable, under ideal conditions, of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards. Most higher-end rifles are warrantied by their manufacturer to shoot under a given MOA threshold (typically 1 MOA or better) with specific ammunition and no error on the shooter's part. For example, Remington's [[M24 Sniper Weapon System]] is required to shoot 0.8 MOA or better, or be rejected.\n\nRifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as ''sub-MOA'', meaning it shoots under 1 MOA. This means that a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards, or the average of several groups, will measure less than 1 MOA between the two furthest shots in the group, i.e. all shots fall within 1 MOA. If larger samples are taken (i.e., more shots per group) then group size typically increases, however this will ultimately average out. If a rifle was truly a 1 MOA rifle, it would be just as likely that two consecutive shots land exactly on top of each other as that they land 1 MOA apart. For 5 shot groups, based on 95% [[confidence interval|confidence]] a rifle that normally shoots 1 MOA can be expected to shoot groups between 0.58 MOA and 1.47 MOA, although the majority of these groups will be under 1 MOA. What this means in practice is if a rifle that shoots 1-inch groups on average at 100 yards shoots a group measuring 0.7 inches followed by a group that is 1.3 inches this is not statistically abnormal.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert E. |last=Wheeler |date= |title=Statistical notes on rifle group patterns |url=http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926154900/http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Denton |last=Bramwell |date=January 2009 |title=Group Therapy The Problem: How accurate is your rifle? |url=http://www.longrangehunting.com/articles/accurate-rifle-groups-1.php |journal=Varmint Hunter |volume=69 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Metric system|Metric System]] counterpart of the MOA is the [[milliradian]] or '''mil''', being equal to one 1000th of the target range, laid out on a circle that has the observer as centre and the target range as radius. The number of mils on a full such circle therefore always is equal to 2 × {{pi}} × 1000, regardless the target range. Therefore, 1 MOA ≈ 0.2908 mil. This means that an object which spans 1 mil on the [[reticle]] is at a range that is in meters equal to the object's size in millimeters (e.g. an object of 100&nbsp;mm @ 1 mrad is 100 meters away). So there is no conversion factor required, contrary to the MOA system.  A reticle with markings (hashes or dots) spaced with a one mil apart (or a fraction of a mil) are collectively called a mil reticle. If the markings are round they are called '''mil-dots'''.\n\nIn the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters), while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.\n\n[[File:Mil and moa comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of [[milliradian]] (mil) and minute of arc (moa).]]\n\n{{Conversion between common sight adjustments based on milliradian and minute of arc}}\n* 1′ at 100 yards equals 22619/ 21600 = 1.04717593 in<ref>[http://dexadine.com/WhatMOA.htm Dexadine Ballistics Software – ballistic data for shooting and reloading]</ref> ≈ 1.047 inches\n* 1′ ≈ 0.291&nbsp;mil (or 2.91&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m, approximately  3&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m)\n* 1&nbsp;mil ≈ 3.44′, so {{sfrac|1|10}}&nbsp;mil ≈ {{sfrac|1|3}}′\n* 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m, or approximately 0.36 inches at 100 yards\n\n===Human vision===\nIn humans, [[Normal vision|20/20 vision]] is the ability to resolve a [[spatial pattern]] separated by a [[visual angle]] of one minute of arc.\nA 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.\n\n===Materials===\nThe deviation from parallelism between two surfaces, for instance in [[optical engineering]], is usually measured in arcminutes or arcseconds.\nIn addition, arcseconds are sometimes used in [[rocking curve]] (ω-scan) [[x ray diffraction]] measurements of high-quality [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] thin films.\n\n===Manufacturing===\nSome measurement devices make use of arcminutes and arcseconds to measure angles when the object being measured is too small for direct visual inspection.

The use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of [[sexagesimal]] numbers.\n\nAnother theory is that the Babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an [[equilateral triangle]] as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their [[sexagesimal]] numeric system.<ref>{{cite book | first=James Hopwood | last=Jeans | authorlink=James Hopwood Jeans | title=The Growth of Physical Science | date=1947 | url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JX49AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA7 | pages=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Francis Dominic | last=Murnaghan | authorlink=Francis Dominic Murnaghan (mathematician) | title=Analytic Geometry | date=1946 | pages=2}}</ref> The [[history of trigonometry|earliest trigonometry]], used by the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] and their [[Greek astronomy|Greek]] successors, was based on [[chord (geometry)|chords]] of a circle.

According to that theory, the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above.\n\n==Subdivisions==\nFor many practical purposes, a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision. When this is not the case, as in [[astronomy]] or for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] ([[latitude]] and [[longitude]]), degree measurements may be written using [[decimal degrees]], with the degree symbol behind the decimals; for example, 40.1875°.\n\nAlternatively, the traditional [[sexagesimal]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] subdivisions can be used. One degree is divided into 60 ''minutes (of arc)'', and one minute into 60 ''seconds (of arc)''. Use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called DMS notation. These subdivisions, also called the ''[[arcminute]]'' and ''[[arcsecond]]'', are respectively represented by a single and double [[Prime (symbol)|prime]]. For example, {{nowrap|40.1875° {{=}} 40° 11′ 15″}}, or, using [[quotation mark]] characters, {{nowrap|40° 11' 15\"}}. Additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds component.\n\nMaritime charts are marked in degrees and decimal minutes to facilitate measurement; 1 minute of latitude is 1 [[nautical mile]].  The example above would be given as 40° 11.25′ (commonly written as 11′25 or 11′.25).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hopkinson|first=Sara|title=RYA day skipper handbook - sail|year=2012|isbn=9781-9051-04949|publisher=The Royal Yachting Association|place=Hamble|p=76}}</ref>\n\nThe older system of [[third (angle)|thirds]], [[fourth (angle)|fourths]], etc., which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision, was used by [[al-Kashi]] and other ancient astronomers, but is rarely used today. These subdivisions were denoted by writing the [[Roman numeral]] for the number of sixtieths in superscript: 1<sup>I</sup> for a \"[[prime (symbol)|prime]]\" (minute of arc), 1<sup>II</sup> for a [[Double prime|second]], 1<sup>III</sup> for a [[Triple prime|third]], 1<sup>IV</sup> for a [[Quadruple prime|fourth]], etc. Hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc, and the word \"second\" also refer to this system.{{OR|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Alternative units==\n{{See also|Angle#Measuring angles|l1=Measuring angles}}\n\n[[File:Degree-Radian Conversion.svg|thumb|300px|A chart to convert between degrees and radians]]\nIn most [[mathematics|mathematical]] work beyond practical geometry, angles are typically measured in [[radian]]s rather than degrees. This is for a variety of reasons; for example, the [[trigonometric function]]s have simpler and more \"natural\" properties when their arguments are expressed in radians. These considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360. One complete [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] (360°) is equal to 2''[[Pi|{{pi}}]]'' radians, so 180° is equal to {{pi}} radians, or equivalently, the degree is a [[mathematical constant]]: 1° = {{frac|{{pi}}|180}}.\n\nThe [[turn (geometry)|turn]] (or revolution, full circle, full rotation, cycle) is used in technology and science. One turn is equal to 360°.\n\nWith the invention of the [[metric system]], based on powers of ten, there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal \"degrees\"<ref group=\"note\">These new and decimal \"degrees\" must not be confused with [[decimal degrees]].</ref> called ''[[grad (angle)|grad]]'' or ''[[gon (angle)|gon]]'', where the number in a right angle is equal to 100&nbsp;gon with 400&nbsp;gon in a full circle (1° = {{frac|10|9}} gon). Although that idea was abandoned by Napoleon, grades continued to be used in several fields and many [[scientific calculator]]s support them.  Decigrades ({{frac|1|4,000}}) were used with French artillery sights in World War I.\n\nAn [[angular mil]], which is most used in military applications, has at least three specific variants, ranging from {{frac|1|6,400}} to {{frac|1|6,000}}. It is approximately equal to one [[milliradian]] ({{circa}} {{frac|1|6,283}}). A mil measuring {{frac|1|6,000}} of a revolution originated in the imperial Russian army, where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units. This may be seen on a lining plane (an early device for aiming [[indirect fire]] artillery) dating from about 1900 in the [[St. Petersburg]] Museum of Artillery.\n\n{{Table of angles}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Compass]]\n* [[Geographic coordinate system]]\n* [[Gradian]]\n* [[Meridian arc]]\n* [[Square degree]]\n* [[Square minute]]\n* [[Square second]]\n* [[Steradian]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive />\n\n==References==\n<references responsive />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Degree (angle)}}\n* {{cite web | url=http://www.mathopenref.com/degrees.html | title=Degrees as an angle measure}}, with interactive animation\n* {{cite web | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Degree.html | title=Degree}} at [[MathWorld]]\n* {{cite web | last1=Gray | first1=Meghan | title=° Degree of Angle | url=http://www.sixtysymbols.com/videos/degree.htm | work=Sixty Symbols | publisher=[[Brady Haran]] for the [[University of Nottingham]] | last2=Merrifield | first2=Michael | last3=Moriarty | first3=Philip | date=2009}}\n\n{{SI units}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Degree (Angle)}}\n[[Category:Units of plane angle]]\n[[Category:Imperial units]]\n[[Category:Mathematical constants]]\n[[Category:Customary units of measurement in the United States]]"

On [https://books.google.com/books?id=IwwAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42 p.&nbsp;42] Frasier argues for using grads instead of radians as a standard unit of angle, but for renaming grads to \"radials\" instead of renaming the temperature scale.</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Metrication problems in the construction codes and standards sector|series=NBS Technical Note 915|first=Charles T.|last=Mahaffey|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Commerce, Institute for Applied Technology, Center for Building Technology|year=1976|url=https://archive.org/stream/metricationprobl915maha|quote=The term \"Celsius\" was adopted instead of the more familiar \"centigrade\" because in France the word centigrade has customarily been applied to angles.}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe unit originated in connection with the [[French Revolution]] in [[France]] as the ''grade'', along with the [[metric system]], hence it is occasionally referred to as a \"metric degree\". Due to confusion with the existing term ''grad(e)'' in some northern European countries (meaning a standard degree, {{sfrac|1|360}} of a turn), the name ''gon'' was later adopted, first in those regions, later as the international standard. In [[German language|German]], the unit was formerly also called ''Neugrad'' (new degree), likewise ''nygrad'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (also ''gradian''), and ''nýgráða'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].\n\nAlthough attempts at a general introduction were made, the unit was only adopted in some countries and for specialised areas such as [[surveying]], [[mining]] and [[geology]]. The French artillery has used the grad for decades. Today, the degree, {{sfrac|1|360}} of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]], or the mathematically more convenient radian, {{sfrac|1|2{{pi}}}} of a turn (used in the [[SI]] system of units) are generally used instead.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s most [[scientific calculator]]s offered the grad as well as radians and degrees for their [[trigonometric functions]].<ref>{{citation|title=Electricity: Fundamental Concepts and Applications|first=Timothy J.|last=Maloney|publisher=Delmar Publishers|year=1992|isbn=9780827346758|page=453|quote=On most scientific calculators, this [the unit for angles] is set by the DRG key}}</ref> In the 2010s, some scientific calculators<!-- from Texas Instruments and at least one from Hewlett-Packard --> lack support for gradians.<ref>{{citation|title=Mathematics for Primary and Early Years: Developing Subject Knowledge|first=Heather|last=Cooke|publisher=SAGE|year=2007|isbn=9781847876287|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3t4B3stB0UC&pg=PA53|quote=Scientific calculators commonly have two modes for working with angles – degrees and radians}}</ref>\n\nThe international standard symbol for this unit today is \"gon\" (see [[ISO 31-1]]). Other symbols used in the past include \"gr\", \"grd\", and \"g\", the last sometimes written as a superscript, similarly to a degree sign: 50ᵍ = 45°.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n\nEach quadrant is assigned a range of 100 gon, which eases recognition of the four quadrants, as well as arithmetic involving perpendicular or opposite angles.\n:{|\n|-\n|align=\"right\"| 0° ||align=\"center\"| = ||align=\"right\"| 0 gradians\n|-\n|align=\"right\"| 90° ||align=\"center\"| = ||align=\"right\"| 100 gradians\n|-\n|align=\"right\"| 180° ||align=\"center\"| = ||align=\"right\"| 200 gradians\n|-\n|align=\"right\"| 270° ||align=\"center\"| = ||align=\"right\"| 300 gradians\n|-\n|align=\"right\"| 360° ||align=\"center\"| = ||align=\"right\"| 400 gradians\n|-\n|}\n\nOne advantage of this unit is that right angles to a given angle are easily determined. If one is sighting down a compass course of 117 grad, the direction to one's left is 17 grad, to one's right 217 grad and behind one 317 grad. A disadvantage is that the common angles of 30° and 60° in geometry must be expressed in fractions ({{sfrac|33|1|3}} grad and {{sfrac|66|2|3}} grad, respectively). Similarly, in one hour ({{sfrac|1|24}} day), Earth rotates by 15° or {{sfrac|16|2|3}} gon. These observations are a consequence of the fact that the number 360 has more divisors than the number 400 does; notably, 360 is divisible by 3, while 400 is not. There are eleven factors of 360 less than or equal to its square root: {{nowrap|{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}. However, there are only seven for 400: {{nowrap|{2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}.\n\nIn the 18th century, the [[metre]] was defined as the forty-millionth part of a meridian. Thus, one grad of arc along the Earth's surface corresponded to 100 kilometres of distance at the [[equator]]; 1 centigrad of arc equaled 1 kilometre; 0.1&nbsp;cc (centi-centigrads) of arc equaled 1 metre.<ref>[http://webdav-noauth.unit-c.fr/files/perso/pbarbier/cours_unit/Elements_de_base_de_la_cartographie.pdf Cartographie – lecture de carte – Partie H Quelques exemples à retenir]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302111251/http://webdav-noauth.unit-c.fr/files/perso/pbarbier/cours_unit/Elements_de_base_de_la_cartographie.pdf|date=2 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Use in surveying ==\nThe gradian is sometimes used in surveying in some parts of the world.<ref>http://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-4492.html</ref> Subdivisions of the gradian used in surveying can be referred to as c (short for centigrad), sometimes referred to as a \"new minute,\" and cc (effectively centi-centigrad), sometimes referred to as a \"new second,\" where 1&nbsp;c = 0.01 grad and 1&nbsp;cc = 0.0001 grad.\n\n== Conversion ==\n\n{{Table of angles}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Angular frequency]]\n* [[Angular mil]] (military measurement)\n* [[Harmonic analysis]]\n* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]]\n* [[Repeating circle]]\n* [[Spread (rational trigonometry)]]\n* [[Steradian]] (the \"square radian\")\n* [[Trigonometry]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Gradian.html Gradian] at [[MathWorld]]\n* [http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55451.html Ask Dr Math]\n* [http://www.sizes.com/units/grade.htm grade]\n* [http://www.sizes.com/units/gon.htm gon]\n* [http://www.sizes.com/units/temperature_centigrade.htm centigrade]\n* [http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/dictunit/notesa.htm Dictionary of Units]\n\n[[Category:Units of plane angle]]\n[[Category:Decimalisation]]\n[[Category:Metrication]]"

Mils are used in adjustment of [[firearm]] sights by adjusting the angle of the sight compared to the barrel (up, down, left or right). Mils are also used for comparing [[shot grouping]]s, or to compare the difficulty of hitting different sized [[shooting target]]s at different distances. When using a scope with both mil adjustment and a [[reticle]] with mil markings (called a mil/mil scope), the shooter can use the reticle as a \"ruler\" to count the number of mils a shot was off target which directly translates to the sight adjustment needed to hit the target with a follow up shot. Optics with mil markings in the reticle can also be used to make a [[stadiametric rangefinding|range estimation]] of a known size target, or vice versa to determine a target size if the distance is known, a practice called \"milling\".\n\nMilliradians are generally used for very small angles, which allows for precise mathematical simplifications to more easily calculate back and forth between the [[angular distance|angular separation]] observed in an optic, linear subtension on target and range. In such applications it is useful to use a unit for target size that is a thousandth of the unit for range, for instance by using the metric units [[millimeter]]s for target size and [[meter]]s for range. This coincides with the definition of the milliradian where the arc length is defined as {{sfrac|1|1000}} of the radius. A common adjustment value in firearm sights is 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters which equals {{sfrac|10 mm|100 m}} = {{sfrac|1|10}}&nbsp;mil.\n\nThe true definition of a milliradian is based on a [[unit circle]] with a radius of [[1|one]] and an [[arc (geometry)|arc]] divided into 1000 mils per radian, hence 2000[[Pi|π]] or approximately 6283.185 milliradians in one [[turn (geometry)|turn]], and rifle scope adjustments and reticles are calibrated to this definition.<ref>[https://www.outdoorhub.com/how-to/2011/07/14/how-to-use-milliradian-adjustable-scopes/ How To Use Milliradian-Adjustable Scopes | OutdoorHub]</ref> There are also other definitions used for [[surveying|land mapping]] and [[artillery]] which are rounded to more easily be divided into smaller parts for use with [[compass]]es. For instance there are artillery sights and compasses with 6400 '''NATO mils''', 6000 '''Warsaw Pact mils''' or 6300 '''Swedish \"streck\"''' per turn instead of 360° or 2000{{pi}}, achieving higher resolution than a 360° compass while also being easier to divide into parts than if true milliradians were used.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Palais de Rumine 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palais de Rumine]], one of the former buildings of the [[University of Lausanne]].]]\n\nThe milliradian (approximately 6283.185 in a circle) was first used in the mid nineteenth century by Charles-Marc Dapples (1837–1920), a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] engineer and professor at the [[University of Lausanne]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse | publisher=Fonds, AV Laussane | author=Renaud, Hugues | date=2002-05-31 | url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F23879.php | quote=Dapples: ...

Une branche de la famille s'est fixée à Gênes à la fin du XVIIIe s.}}</ref> Degrees and minutes were the usual units of angular measurement but others were being proposed, with \"[[Gradian|grads]]\" (400 gradians in a circle) under various names having considerable popularity in much of northern Europe. However, Imperial Russia used a different approach, dividing a circle into [[equilateral triangle]]s (60° per triangle, 6 triangles in a circle){{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and hence 600 units to a circle.\n\nAround the time of the start of [[World War I]], France was experimenting with the use of [[millieme (angle)|millieme]]s (6400 in a circle) for use with artillery sights instead of [[decigrade]]s (4000 in a circle). The United Kingdom was also trialing them to replace degrees and minutes. They were adopted by France although decigrades also remained in use throughout World War I. Other nations also used decigrades.  The United States, which copied many French artillery practices, adopted mils (6400 in a circle). Before 2007 the Swedish defence forces used \"streck\" (6300 in a circle, streck meaning lines or marks) (together with degrees for some navigation) which is closer to the milliradian but then changed to NATO mils. After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and the adoption of the metric system of measurement (e.g. artillery replaced \"units of base\" with meters) the Red Army expanded the 600 unit circle into a 6000 mil one. Hence the Russian mil has a somewhat different origin than those derived from French artillery practices.\n\nIn the 1950s, [[NATO]] adopted metric units of measurement for land and general use. Mils, meters, and kilograms became standard, although degrees remained in use for naval and air purposes, reflecting civil practices.\n\n== Mathematical principle ==\n{{multiple image\n | width = 160\n | footer = \n'''Left''': An angle of 1 [[radian]] (marked green, approximately 57.3°) corresponds to an angle where the length of the arc (blue) is equal to the radius of the circle (red).<br/>\n'''Right''': A milliradian corresponds to {{sfrac|1|1000}} of the angle of a radian. (The image on the right is exaggerated for illustration, as a milliradian is much smaller in reality).\n | image1 = Radian cropped color.svg\n | image2 = Milliradian unit circle exaggerated.png\n }}\n[[File:Observed angle, arc length and subtension.png|thumb|right|For small observed angles (green) the arc length (blue) approaches the subtension (orange).]]\nUse of the milliradian is practical because it is concerned with [[skinny triangle|small angles]], and when using radians the [[small angle approximation]] shows that the angle approximates to the [[sine]] of the angle, that is <math>\\sin \\theta \\simeq \\theta</math>. This allows a user to dispense with [[trigonometry]] and use simple ratios to determine size and distance with high accuracy for rifle and short distance artillery calculations by using the handy property of subtension: ''One mil approximately subtends one meter at a distance of one thousand meters''.\n\nMore in detail, because <math>\\text{subtension} \\simeq \\text{arc length}</math>, instead of finding the [[angular distance]] denoted by θ (Greek letter [[theta]]) by using the [[tangent function]]\n\n<math> \\theta_\\text{trig} = \\arctan \\frac \\text{subtension} \\text{range}</math>,\n\none can instead make a [[Taylor series#Approximation and convergence|good approximation]] by using the definition of a radian and the simplified formula:\n\n<math> \\theta_\\text{rad} = \\frac \\text{subtension} \\text{range}</math>\n\nSince a [[radian]] is mathematically defined as the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals the radius of the circle, a milliradian, is the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals {{sfrac|1|1000}} of the radius of the circle. Just like the radian, the milliradian is [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], but unlike the radian where the same unit must be used for radius and arc length, the milliradian needs to have a ratio between the units where the subtension is a thousandth of the radius when using the simplified formula.\n\n=== Approximation error ===\nThe [[approximation error]] by using the simplified linear formula will increase as the angle increases.

Bullet drop and wind drift are shown both in mil and [[minute of angle|moa]].]]\n\nMil adjustment is commonly used as a unit for clicks in the mechanical adjustment knobs (turrets) of [[iron sights|iron]] and [[telescopic sight|scope sights]] both in the military and civilian [[shooting sports]]. New shooters are often explained the principle of subtensions in order to understand that a milliradian is an angular measurement. Subtension is the physical amount of space covered by an angle and varies with distance. Thus, the subtension corresponding to a mil (either in a mil reticle or in mil adjustments) varies with range. Knowing subtensions at different ranges can be useful for sighting in a firearm if there is no optic with a mil reticle available, but involve mathematical calculations and are therefore not used very much in practical applications. Subtensions always change with distance, but a mil (as observed through an optic) is always a mil regardless of distance. Therefore, [[ballistic table]]s and shot corrections are given in mils thereby avoiding the need for mathematical calculations.\n\nIf a rifle scope has mil markings in the reticle (or there is a [[spotting scope]] with a mil reticle available), the reticle can be used to measure how many mils to correct a shot even without knowing the shooting distance. For instance, assuming a precise shot fired by an experienced shooter missed the target by 0.8 mils as seen through an optic, and the firearm sight has 0.1 mil adjustments, the shooter must then dial 8 clicks on the scope to hit the same target under the same conditions.\n\n=== Common click values ===\n\n;General purpose scopes:\nGradations (clicks) of {{sfrac|1|4}}′, {{sfrac|1|10}}&nbsp;mil and {{sfrac|1|2}}′   are used in general purpose sights for hunting, target and [[long range shooting]] at varied distances. The click values are fine enough to get dialed in for most target shooting and coarse enough to keep the number of clicks down when dialing.\n\n;Speciality scopes:\n{{sfrac|0.25|10}}&nbsp;mil, {{sfrac|1|8}}′ and {{sfrac|0.5|10}}&nbsp;mil are used in speciality scope sights for extreme precision at fixed target ranges such as [[benchrest shooting]]. Some specialty iron sights used in [[10 meter air rifle|ISSF 10 m]], [[50 meter rifle prone|50 m]] and [[300 meter rifle prone|300 meter rifle]] come with adjustments in either {{sfrac|0.5|10}} mil or {{sfrac|0.25|10}} mil. The small adjustment value means these sights can be adjusted in very small increments. These fine adjustments are however not very well suited for dialing between varied distances such as in field shooting because of the high number of clicks that will be required to move the line of sight, making it easier to lose track of the number of clicks than in scopes with larger click adjustments. For instance to move the line of sight 0.4 mil, a 0.1 mil scope must be adjusted 4 clicks, while comparably a 0.05 mil and 0.025 mil scope must be adjusted 8 and 16 clicks respectively.\n\n;Other:\n{{sfrac|1.5|10}}&nbsp;mil and {{sfrac|2|10}}&nbsp;mil can be found in some short range sights, mostly with capped turrets, but are not very widely used.\n\n=== Subtensions at different distances ===\n[[File:Mil sight adjustment.png|thumb|right|Illustration of sight adjustment with 0.1 milliradian increment.]]\nSubtension refers to the length between two points on a target, and is usually given in either centimeters, millimeters or inches. Since a mil is an angular measurement, the subtension covered by a given angle ([[angular distance]] or [[angular diameter]]) increases with viewing distance to the target. For instance the same angle of 0.1 mil will subtend 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters, 2&nbsp;cm at 200 meters, etc., or similarly 0.39 inches at 100 m, 0.78 inches at 200 m, etc.\n\nSubtensions in mil based optics are particularly useful together with target sizes and shooting distances in [[metric system|metric units]]. The most common scope adjustment increment in mil based rifle scopes is 0.1&nbsp;mil, which are sometimes called \"one centimeter clicks\" since 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters, 2&nbsp;cm at 200 meters, etc. Similarly, an adjustment click on a scope with 0.2&nbsp;mil adjustment will move the point of bullet impact 2&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m and 4&nbsp;cm at 200&nbsp;m, etc.\n\nWhen using a scope with both mil adjustment and a reticle with mil markings (called a mil/mil scope), the shooter can spot his own bullet impact and easily correct the sight if needed. If the shot was a miss, the mil reticle can simply be used as a \"ruler\" to count the number of mils the shot was off target. The number of mils to correct is then multiplied by ten if the scope has 0.1 mil adjustments. If for instance the shot was 0.6 mil to the right of the target, 6 clicks will be needed to adjust the sight. This way there is no need for math, conversions, knowledge of target size or distance. This is true for a first focal plane scope at all magnifications, but a variable second focal plane must be set to a given magnification (usually its maximum magnification) for any mil scales to be correct.\n\nWhen using a scope with mil adjustments, but without mil markings in the reticle (i.e. a standard duplex cross-hair on a hunting or benchrest scope), sight correction for a known target subtension and known range can be calculated by the following formula, which utilizes the fact that an adjustment of 1 mil changes the impact as many millimeters as there are meters:\n\n:<math>\\text{adjustment in mils} = \\frac \\text{subtension in mm} \\text{range in m}</math>\n\nFor instance:\n* {{sfrac|20&nbsp;mm|50&nbsp;m}} =  0.4 mils, or 4 clicks with a {{sfrac|1|10}} mil adjustment scope.\n* {{sfrac|50&nbsp;mm|1000&nbsp;m}} =  0.05 mils, or 1 click with a 0.05 mil adjustment scope.\n\nIn firearm optics, where 0.1 mil per click is the most common mil based adjustment value, another common rule of thumb is that:\n\n<blockquote>''An adjustment of {{frac|1|10}} mil changes the impact as many centimeters as there are hundreds of meters.''</blockquote>\n\nI.e 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters, 2.25&nbsp;cm at 225 meters, 0.5&nbsp;cm at 50 meters, etc., see the table below\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!Range in<br/>meters\n!1 mil <br/>subtension<br/>in mm\n!{{frac|1|10}} mil <br/>subtension<br/>in mm\n!1 mil <br/>subtension<br/>in cm\n!{{frac|1|10}} mil <br/>subtension<br/>in cm\n|-\n|100&nbsp;m\n|100&nbsp;mm\n|10&nbsp;mm\n|10&nbsp;cm\n|1&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|200&nbsp;m\n|200&nbsp;mm\n|20&nbsp;mm\n|20&nbsp;cm\n|2&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|300&nbsp;m\n|300&nbsp;mm\n|30&nbsp;mm\n|30&nbsp;cm\n|3&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|400&nbsp;m\n|400&nbsp;mm\n|40&nbsp;mm\n|40&nbsp;cm\n|4&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|500&nbsp;m\n|500&nbsp;mm\n|50&nbsp;mm\n|50&nbsp;cm\n|5&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|600&nbsp;m\n|600&nbsp;mm\n|60&nbsp;mm\n|60&nbsp;cm\n|6&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|700&nbsp;m\n|700&nbsp;mm\n|70&nbsp;mm\n|70&nbsp;cm\n|7&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|800&nbsp;m\n|800&nbsp;mm\n|80&nbsp;mm\n|80&nbsp;cm\n|8&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|900&nbsp;m\n|900&nbsp;mm\n|90&nbsp;mm\n|90&nbsp;cm\n|9&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|1000&nbsp;m\n|1000&nbsp;mm\n|100&nbsp;mm\n|100&nbsp;cm\n|10&nbsp;cm\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Adjustment range and base tilt ===\n[[File:Figure 2- Illustration of a Rifle Showing Line of Sight and Bore Angle.jpg|thumb|right|The concept of a tilted scope mount can be explained as the angle between the [[bore-axis]] of a rifle and its scope.]]\nThe horizontal and vertical adjustment range of a firearm sight is often advertised by the manufacturer using mils. For instance a rifle scope may be advertised as having a vertical adjustment range of 20 mils, which means that by turning the turret the bullet impact can be moved a total of 20 meters at 1000 meters (or 2&nbsp;m at 100&nbsp;m, 4&nbsp;m at 200&nbsp;m, 6&nbsp;m at 300&nbsp;m etc.). The horizontal and vertical adjustment ranges can be different for a particular sight, for instance a scope may have 20 mils vertical and 10 mils horizontal adjustment. Elevation differ between models, but about 10–11 mils are common in hunting scopes, while scopes made for [[long range shooting]] usually have an adjustment range of 20–30 mils (70–100 moa).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nSights can either be mounted in neutral or tilted mounts. In a neutral mount (also known as \"flat base\" or non-tilted mount) the sight will point reasonably parallel to the barrel, and be close to a zero at 100 meters (about 1 mil low depending on rifle and caliber). After zeroing at 100 meters the sight will thereafter always have to be adjusted upwards to compensate for bullet drop at longer ranges, and therefore the adjustment below zero will never be used. This means that when using a neutral mount only about half of the scope's total elevation will be usable for shooting at longer ranges:\n\n<math>\\text{usable elevation in neutral mount} = \\frac\\text{scope's total elevation}{2}</math>\n\nIn most regular sport and hunting rifles (except for in long range shooting), sights are usually mounted in neutral mounts. This is done because the optical quality of the scope is best in the middle of its adjustment range, and only being able to use half of the adjustment range to compensate for bullet drop is seldom a problem at short and medium range shooting.\n\nHowever, in long range shooting tilted scope mounts are common since it is very important to have enough vertical adjustment to compensate for the bullet drop at longer distances. For this purpose scope mounts are sold with varying degrees of tilt, but some common values are:\n\n* 3 mils, which equals 3&nbsp;m at 1000&nbsp;m (or 0.3&nbsp;m at 100&nbsp;m)\n* 6 mils, which equals 6&nbsp;m at 1000&nbsp;m (or 0.6&nbsp;m at 100&nbsp;m)\n* 9 mils, which equals 9&nbsp;m at 1000&nbsp;m (or 0.9&nbsp;m at 100&nbsp;m)\n\nWith a tilted mount the maximum usable scope elevation can be found by:\n\n<math>\\text{maximum elevation with tilted mount} = \\frac\\text{scope's total elevation}{2} + \\text{base tilt}</math>\n\nThe adjustment range needed to shoot at a certain distance vary with firearm, caliber and load. For example, with a certain [[.308 Winchester|.308]] load and firearm combination, the bullet may drop 13 mils at 1000 meters (13 meters). To be able to reach out, one could either:\n\n* Use a scope with 26 mils of adjustment in a neutral mount, to get a usable adjustment of {{sfrac|26 mils|2}} = 13 mils\n* Use a scope with 14 mils of adjustment and a 6 mil tilted mount to achieve a maximum adjustment of {{sfrac|14 mils|2}} + 6 = 13 mils\n\n== Shot groupings ==\n{{Main|Shot grouping}}\n{{multiple image\n | width = 180\n | footer = Two shot groupings obtained with different firearms at different distances. <br/>'''The group on the left''' measures about 13 mm and was fired at about 45 meters, which equals {{sfrac|13 mm|45 m}} = 0.289 mils. <br/>'''The group on the right''' measures about 7 mm and was fired at about 90 meters, which equals {{sfrac|7 mm|90 m}} = 0.078 mils.\n | image1 = Target 22mag Striker.jpg\n | image2 = Target 223 Savage 10FP 5 shot.jpg\n }}\nA shot grouping is the spread of multiple shots on a target, taken in one shooting session. The group size on target in milliradians can be obtained\nby measuring the spread of the rounds on target in [[millimeter]]s with a [[calipers|caliper]] and dividing by the shooting distance in meters. This way, using mils, one can easily compare shot groupings or target difficulties at different shooting distances.\n\n:<math>\\text{group size in mils} = \\frac{\\text{group size in mm}}{\\text{range in m}}</math>\n\nIf the firearm is attached in a fixed mount and aimed at a target, the shot grouping measures the firearms mechanical precision and the uniformity of the ammunition. When the firearm also is held by a shooter, the shot grouping partly measures the precision of the firearm and ammunition, and partly the shooter's consistency and skill. Often the shooters' skill is the most important element towards achieving a tight shot grouping{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, especially when competitors are using the same match grade firearms and ammunition.\n\n== Range estimation with mil reticles ==\n[[File:S&B P4 reticle at 25x zoom.png|thumb|right|P4L mil reticle as used in the [[Schmidt & Bender]] 5-25×56 PM II LP [[Telescopic sight|scope sight]] as seen at 25× magnification.]]\n[[File:Table for range estimation using milliradians.svg|thumb|right|Premade table for range estimation showing target sizes, distances and corresponding angular measurements. Angular sizes are given in milliradians, ranges in meters, and target sizes are shown in both in centimeters, millimeters and inches.]]\n\nMany telescopic sights used on rifles have [[reticle]]s that are marked in mils. This can either be accomplished with lines or dots, and the latter is generally called mil-dots. The mil reticle serves two purposes, range estimation and trajectory correction.\n\nWith a mil reticle-equipped scope the distance to an object can be estimated with a fair degree of accuracy by a trained user by determining how many angular mils an object of known size subtends. Once the distance is known, the drop of the bullet at that range (see [[external ballistics]]), converted back into angular mils, can be used to adjust the aiming point. Generally mil-reticle scopes have both horizontal and vertical crosshairs marked; the horizontal and vertical marks are used for range estimation and the vertical marks for bullet drop compensation. Trained users, however, can also use the horizontal dots to compensate for bullet drift due to wind. Mil-reticle-equipped scopes are well suited for long shots under uncertain conditions, such as those encountered by military and law enforcement [[sniper]]s, [[varmint rifle|varmint hunters]] and other field shooters. These riflemen must be able to aim at varying targets at unknown (sometimes long) distances, so accurate compensation for bullet drop is required.\n\n[[File:USMC-19556.jpg|thumbnail|right|Mildot chart as used by [[snipers]].]]\nAngle can be used for either calculating target size or range if one of them are known. Where the range is known the angle will give the size, where the size is known then the range is given. When out in the field angle can be measured approximately by using calibrated optics or roughly using one's fingers and hands. With an outstretched arm one finger is approximately 30 mils wide, a fist 150 mils and a spread hand 300 mils.\n\nMil reticles often have dots or marks with a spacing of one mil in between, but graduations can also be finer and coarser (i.e. 0.8 or 1.2 mil).\n\n=== Units for target size and range ===\nWhile a radian is defined as an angle on the unit circle where the arc and radius have equal length, a milliradian is defined as the angle where the arc length is one thousandth of the radius. Therefore, when using milliradians for range estimation, the unit used for target distance needs to be thousand times as large as the unit used for target size. Metric units are particularly useful in conjunction with a mil reticle because the [[mental calculation|mental arithmetic]] is much simpler with decimal units, thereby requiring less mental calculation in the field. Using the range estimation formula with the units meters for range and millimeters for target size it is just a matter of moving decimals and do the division, without the need of multiplication with additional constants, thus producing fewer rounding errors.\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in meters} = \\frac{\\text{target in millimeters}}{\\text{angle in mils}} </math>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of the range formula\n|-\n|These relations can easily be derived by looking at the units:\n\nmil = {{sfrac|millimeter|meter}} = {{sfrac| milli-{{strikethrough|meter}}|{{strikethrough|meter}} }} = mil, (short {{sfrac| m{{strikethrough|m}}|{{strikethrough|m}} }} = mil)\n\nand vice versa\n\nmeter = {{sfrac|millimeter|mil}} = {{sfrac| {{strikethrough|milli}}-meter|{{strikethrough|mil}} }} = meter, (short {{sfrac| {{strikethrough|m}}m|{{strikethrough|mil}} }} = m).\n|}\n\nThe same holds true for calculating target distance in kilometers using target size in meters.\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in kilometers} = \\frac{\\text{target in meters}}{\\text{angle in mils}} </math>\n\nAlso, in general the same unit can be used for subtension and range if multiplied with a factor of thousand, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in meters} = \\frac{\\text{target in meters}}{\\text{angle in mils}} \\times 1,000</math>\n\nIf using the [[imperial units]] yards for distance and inches for target size, one has to multiply by a factor of {{frac|1000|36}} ≈ 27.78, since there are 36 inches in one yard.\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in yards} = \\frac{\\text{target in inches}}{\\text{angle in mils}} \\times 27.78</math>\n\nIf using the metric unit meters for distance and the imperial unit inches for target size, one has to multiply by a factor of 25.4, since one inch is defined as 25.4 millimeters.\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in meters} = \\frac{\\text{target in inches}}{\\text{angle in mils}} \\times 25.4</math>\n\n=== Practical examples ===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stadiametric rangefinding|Estimating range]] using the hands on an extended arm as a reference for the angular size in mils.]]\n[[Land Rover Series|Land Rovers]] are about 3 to 4&nbsp;m long, \"smaller tank\" or [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]/[[Infantry fighting vehicle|MICV]] at about 6&nbsp;m (e.g. [[T-34]] or [[BMP-3|BMP]]) and about 10&nbsp;m for a \"big tank.\" From the front a Land Rover is about 1.5&nbsp;m wide, most tanks around 3–3.5&nbsp;m. So a SWB Land Rover from the side are one finger wide at about 100&nbsp;m. A modern tank would have to be at a bit over 300&nbsp;m.\n\nIf for instance a target known to be 1.5&nbsp;m in height (1500&nbsp;mm) is measured to 2.8 mils in the reticle, the range can be estimated to:\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in meters} = \\frac{1500 ~ \\text{mm}}{2.8 ~ \\text{mils}} = 535.7 ~ \\text{m} </math>\n\nSo if the above-mentioned 6&nbsp;m long BMP (6000&nbsp;mm) is viewed at 6 mils its distance is 1000&nbsp;m, and if the angle of view is twice as large (12 mils) the distance is half as much, 500&nbsp;m.\n\nWhen used with some riflescopes of variable objective magnification and fixed reticle magnification (where the reticle is in the second focal plane), the formula can be modified to:\n\n:<math>\\text{distance in meters} = \\frac{\\text{size in mm}}{\\text{angle in mils}} \\times \\frac{\\text{mag}}{10} </math>\n\nWhere mag is scope magnification. However, a user should verify this with their individual scope since some are not calibrated at 10×. As above target distance and target size can be given in any two units of length with a ratio of 1000:1.\n\n== Mixing mil and minutes of arc ==\nIt is possible to purchase rifle scopes with a mil reticle and minute-of-arc turrets, but it is general consensus that such mixing should be avoided. It is preferred to either have both a mil reticle and mil adjustment (mil/mil), or a minute-of-arc reticle and minute-of-arc adjustment to utilize the strength of each system. Then the shooter can know exactly how many clicks to correct based on what he sees in the reticle.\n\nIf using a mixed system scope that has a mil reticle and arcminute adjustment, one way to make use of the reticle for shot corrections is to exploit that 14′ approximately equals 4&nbsp;mils, and thereby multiplying an observed corrections in mils by a fraction of {{sfrac|14|4}} when adjusting the turrets.\n\n=== Conversion table for firearms ===\n[[File:Mil and moa comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of milliradian (mil) and [[minute of arc]] (moa).]]\nIn the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters), while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.\n\n{{Conversion between common sight adjustments based on milliradian and minute of arc}}\n\n* 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m\n* 1&nbsp;mil ≈ 3.44′, so {{sfrac|1|10}}&nbsp;mil ≈ {{sfrac|1|3}}′\n* 1′ ≈ 0.291&nbsp;mil (or 2.91&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m, approximately  3&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m)\n\n== Definitions for maps and artillery ==\n[[File:Kortmaal M70.jpg|thumb|Map measure M/70 of the NATO member [[Denmark]] with the full circle divided into 6400 NATO mils]]\n[[File:Schweizer Artillerie Promille.svg|thumb|In the Swiss Army, 6400 \"artillery [[per mille]]s\" (\"Artilleriepromille\") are used to indicate an absolute indication of direction by using the notation that 0 A ‰ (corresponding to 6400 A ‰) points to the north, instead of using NATO mils where direction is always relative to the target (0 or 6400 NATO mils is always towards target).]]\nBecause of the definition of pi, in a circle with a diameter of one there are 2000{{pi}} milliradians (≈ 6283.185&nbsp;mil) per full turn. In other words, one real milliradian covers just under {{sfrac|6283}} of the circumference of a circle, which is the definition used by telescopic rifle sight manufacturers in reticles for [[stadiametric rangefinding]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFor maps and artillery, three rounded definitions are used which are close to the real definition, but more easily can be divided into parts. The different map and artillery definitions are sometimes referred to as \"angular mils\", and are:\n* {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle in [[NATO]] countries.\n* {{sfrac|6000}} of a circle in [[Soviet Union|the former Soviet Union]] and [[Finland]] <small>(Finland phasing out the  standard in favour of the NATO standard{{citation needed|date=May 2019}})</small>.\n* {{sfrac|6300}} of a circle in [[Sweden]]. The Swedish term for this is ''streck'', literally \"line\". Sweden (and Finland) have not been part of NATO nor the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Note however that Sweden has changed its map grid systems and angular measurement to those used by NATO, so the \"streck\" measurement is obsolete.\n\nReticles in some artillery sights are calibrated to the relevant artillery definition for that military, i.e. the Carl Zeiss OEM-2 artillery sight made in [[East Germany|DDR]] from 1969 to 1976 is calibrated for the eastern block 6000 mil circle.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nVarious symbols have been used to represent angular mils for compass use:\n* '''mil''', '''MIL''' and similar abbreviations are often used by militaries in the English speaking part of the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n* '''‰''', called \"artillery [[per mille]]s\" (German: ''Artilleriepromille''), a symbol used by the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n* '''¯''', called \"artillery line\" (German: ''artilleristische Strich''), a symbol used by the [[German Army]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} (not to be confused with [[Points of the compass|Compass Point]] (German: ''Nautischer Strich'', 32 \"nautical lines\" per circle) which sometimes use the same symbol.

This means that artillery uses mils to graduate indirect fire azimuth sights (called ''dial sights'' or ''panoramic telescopes''), their associated instruments (''directors'' or ''aiming circles''), their elevation sights ([[clinometer]]s or [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s), together with their manual plotting devices, firing tables and fire control computers.\n\nArtillery spotters typically use their calibrated binoculars to walk fire onto a target.

The length of an arc of a [[unit circle]] is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the [[angle]] that it [[wikt:subtend|subtend]]s; one radian is just under 57.3 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (expansion at {{OEIS2C|A072097}}). The unit was formerly an [[SI supplementary unit]], but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an [[SI derived unit]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Resolution 8 of the CGPM at its 20th Meeting (1995) |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/20/8/ |access-date=2014-09-23 |publisher=[[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]]}}</ref>\n\nSeparately, the SI unit of [[solid angle]] measurement is the [[steradian]].\n\nThe radian is most commonly represented by the symbol '''rad'''.<ref>[[Unicode]]-encoded as {{unichar|33AD}} for compatibility with legacy encodings</ref> An alternative symbol is <sup>c</sup>, the superscript letter c (for \"circular measure\"), the letter r, or a superscript {{sup|R}},<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> but these symbols are infrequently used as it can be easily mistaken for a [[degree symbol]] (°) or a radius (r). So, for example, a value of 1.2 radians could be written as 1.2&nbsp;rad, 1.2&nbsp;r, 1.2{{sup|rad}}, 1.2{{sup|c}}, or 1.2{{sup|R}}.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nRadian describes the plane [[angle]] [[subtended]] by a circular [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] as the length of the arc divided by the [[radius]] of the arc. One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a [[circle]] by an [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] that is equal in length to the [[radius]] of the circle. More generally, the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] in radians of such a subtended angle is equal to the ratio of the arc length to the radius of the circle; that is, {{nowrap|1=''[[θ]]'' = ''s'' / ''r''}}, where ''θ'' is the subtended angle in radians, ''s'' is arc length, and ''r'' is radius. Conversely, the length of the enclosed arc is equal to the radius multiplied by the magnitude of the angle in radians; that is, {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''rθ''}}.\n\nAs the ratio of two lengths, the radian is a \"[[pure number]]\" that needs no unit symbol, and in mathematical writing the symbol \"rad\" is almost always omitted. When quantifying an angle in the absence of any symbol, radians are assumed, and when degrees are meant the symbol [[°]] is used.\n\n[[File:2pi-unrolled.gif|thumb|right|A complete revolution is 2{{pi}} radians (shown here with a circle of radius one and thus [[circumference]] 2{{pi}}).]]\nIt follows that the magnitude in radians of one complete revolution (360 degrees) is the length of the entire circumference divided by the radius, or {{nowrap|2[[pi|{{pi}}]]''r'' / ''r''}}, or 2{{pi}}. Thus 2{{pi}} radians is equal to 360 degrees, meaning that one radian is equal to 180/{{pi}} degrees.\n\nThe relation <math>2\\pi\\text{ rad}=360^{\\circ}</math> can be derived using the formula for [[arc length]]. Taking the formula for arc length, or <math>\\ell_{arc}=2\\pi r\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{360^{\\circ}}\\right)</math>. Assuming a unit circle; the radius is therefore one. Knowing that the definition of radian is the measure of an angle that subtends an arc of a length equal to the radius of the circle, we know that <math>1=2\\pi\\left(\\frac{1\\text{ rad}}{360^{\\circ}}\\right)</math>. This can be further simplified to <math>1=\\frac{2\\pi\\text{ rad}}{360^{\\circ}}</math>. Multiplying both sides by <math>360^{\\circ}</math> gives <math>360^{\\circ}=2\\pi\\text{ rad}</math>.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe concept of radian measure, as opposed to the degree of an angle, is normally credited to [[Roger Cotes]] in 1714.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Printonly/Cotes.html | title = Biography of Roger Cotes | work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics |date = February 2005 | last1= O'Connor|first1= J.

By 1722, his cousin Robert Smith had collected and published Cotes' mathematical writings in a book, ''Harmonia mensurarum'' … .  In a chapter of editorial comments by Smith, he gives, for the first time, the value of one radian in degrees.  See:  Roger Cotes with Robert Smith, ed., ''Harmonia mensurarum'' … (Cambridge, England:  1722), chapter: Editoris notæ ad Harmoniam mensurarum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6BGAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false top of page 95].  From page 95:  After stating that 180° corresponds to a length of {{pi}} (3.14159…) along a unit circle (i.e., {{pi}} radians), Smith writes:  ''\"Unde Modulus Canonis Trigonometrici prodibit 57.2957795130 &c. \"'' (Whence the unit of trigonometric measure, 57.2957795130… [degrees per radian], will appear.)</ref> He described the radian in everything but name, and he recognized its naturalness as a unit of angular measure. Prior to the term ''radian'' becoming widespread, the unit was commonly called ''circular measure'' of an angle.<ref>Isaac Todhunter, ''Plane Trigonometry: For the Use of Colleges and Schools'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bo5FAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA10 p. 10], Cambridge and London: MacMillan, 1864 {{OCLC|500022958}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of measuring angles by the length of the arc was already in use by other mathematicians. For example, [[al-Kashi]] (c. 1400) used so-called ''diameter parts'' as units where one diameter part was {{sfrac|1|60}} radian and they also used sexagesimal subunits of the diameter part.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last= Luckey|editor-first=A. |editor-last=Siggel|location=Berlin|publisher= Akademie Verlag| origyear=Translation of 1424 book|year=1953| title=Der Lehrbrief über den kreisumfang von Gamshid b.

All the large polygons in this diagram are [[regular polygon]]s.]]\n\nIn [[calculus]] and most other branches of mathematics beyond practical geometry, angles are universally measured in radians. This is because radians have a mathematical \"naturalness\" that leads to a more elegant formulation of a number of important results.\n\nMost notably, results in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] involving [[trigonometric function]]s are simple and elegant when the functions' arguments are expressed in radians. For example, the use of radians leads to the simple [[limit of a function|limit]] formula\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\sin h}{h}=1,</math>\n\nwhich is the basis of many other identities in mathematics, including\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx} \\sin x = \\cos x</math>\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\sin x = -\\sin x.</math>\n\nBecause of these and other properties, the trigonometric functions appear in solutions to mathematical problems that are not obviously related to the functions' geometrical meanings (for example, the solutions to the differential equation <math> \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = -y </math>, the evaluation of the integral <math> \\int \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} </math>, and so on). In all such cases it is found that the arguments to the functions are most naturally written in the form that corresponds, in geometrical contexts, to the radian measurement of angles.\n\nThe trigonometric functions also have simple and elegant series expansions when radians are used; for example, the following [[Taylor series]] for sin&nbsp;''x'' :\n\n:<math>\\sin x = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots .</math>\n\nIf ''x'' were expressed in degrees then the series would contain messy factors involving powers of {{pi}}/180: if ''x'' is the number of degrees, the number of radians is {{nowrap|1=''y'' = {{pi}}''x'' / 180}}, so\n\n:<math>\\sin x_\\mathrm{deg} = \\sin y_\\mathrm{rad} = \\frac{\\pi}{180} x - \\left (\\frac{\\pi}{180} \\right )^3\\ \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\left (\\frac{\\pi}{180} \\right )^5\\ \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\left (\\frac{\\pi}{180} \\right )^7\\ \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots .</math>\n\nMathematically important relationships between the sine and cosine functions and the [[exponential function]] (see, for example, [[Euler's formula]]) are, again, elegant when the functions' arguments are in radians and messy otherwise.\n\n== Dimensional analysis ==\n\nAlthough the radian is a unit of measure, it is a [[dimensionless quantity]]. This can be seen from the definition given earlier: the angle subtended at the centre of a circle, measured in radians, is equal to the ratio of the length of the enclosed arc to the length of the circle's radius. Since the units of measurement cancel, this ratio is dimensionless.\n\nAlthough [[Polar coordinates|polar]] and [[spherical coordinates]] use radians to describe coordinates in two and three dimensions, the unit is derived from the radius coordinate, so the angle measure is still dimensionless.<ref>For a debate on this meaning and use see:\n{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.18616|title=Angles—Let's treat them squarely|year=1997|last1=Brownstein|first1=K.

One revolution per second is equal to 2{{pi}} radians per second.\n\nSimilarly, [[angular acceleration]] is often measured in radians per second per second (rad/s<sup>2</sup>).\n\nFor the purpose of dimensional analysis, the units of angular velocity and angular acceleration are s<sup>−1</sup> and s<sup>−2</sup> respectively.\n\nLikewise, the [[phase difference]] of two waves can also be measured in radians. For example, if the phase difference of two waves is (''k''⋅2{{pi}}) radians, where ''k'' is an integer, they are considered in [[phase (waves)|phase]], whilst if the phase difference of two waves is ({{nowrap|''k''⋅2{{pi}} + {{pi}}}}), where ''k'' is an integer, they are considered in antiphase.\n\n== SI multiples ==\n[[Metric prefix]]es have limited use with radians, and none in mathematics. A [[milliradian]] (mrad) is a thousandth of a radian and a microradian (μrad) is a millionth of a radian, i.e. {{nowrap|1=1 rad = 10<sup>3</sup> mrad = 10<sup>6</sup> μrad}}.\n\nThere are 2[[pi|{{pi}}]] × 1000 milliradians (≈ 6283.185&nbsp;mrad) in a circle. So a trigonometric milliradian is just under {{sfrac|1|6283}} of a circle. This “real” trigonometric unit of angular measurement of a circle is in use by [[telescopic sight]] manufacturers using [[Stadiametric rangefinding|(stadiametric) rangefinding]] in [[reticle]]s. The [[beam divergence|divergence]] of [[laser]] beams is also usually measured in milliradians.\n\nAn approximation of the trigonometric milliradian (0.001&nbsp;rad) is used by [[NATO]] and other military organizations in [[gun]]nery and [[Sniper#Targeting|targeting]]. Each angular mil represents {{sfrac|1|6400}} of a circle and is {{sfrac|15|8}}% or 1.875% smaller than the trigonometric milliradian. For the small angles typically found in targeting work, the convenience of using the number 6400 in calculation outweighs the small mathematical errors it introduces. In the past, other gunnery systems have used different approximations to {{sfrac|1|2000{{pi}}}}; for example Sweden used the {{sfrac|1|6300}} ''streck'' and the USSR used {{sfrac|1|6000}}. Being based on the milliradian, the NATO mil subtends roughly 1&nbsp;m at a range of 1000&nbsp;m (at such small angles, the curvature is negligible).\n\nSmaller units like microradians (μrad) and nanoradians (nrad) are used in astronomy, and can also be used to measure the beam quality of lasers with ultra-low divergence. More common is [[arc second]], which is {{sfrac|{{pi}}|648,000}}&nbsp;rad (around 4.8481&nbsp;microradians). Similarly, the prefixes smaller than milli- are potentially useful in measuring extremely small angles.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Angular frequency]]\n* [[Milliradian]]\n* [[Gradian]] (also known as gon)\n* [[Harmonic analysis]]\n* [[Steradian]] – the \"square radian\"\n* [[Trigonometry]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Hall_1909\">{{cite book |title=Trigonometry |volume=Part I: Plane Trigonometry |author-first1=Arthur Graham |author-last1=Hall |author-first2=Fred Goodrich |author-last2=Frink |date=January 1909 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA |chapter=Chapter VII.

The sum of external angles of a polygon equals one turn. Angle [[doubling map]] is used. \n* [[Pie chart]]s illustrate proportions of a whole as fractions of a turn. Each one percent is shown as an angle of one centiturn.\n\n==Kinematics of turns==\nIn [[kinematics]], a '''turn''' is a rotation less than a full revolution.\nA turn may be represented in a [[mathematical model]] that uses expressions of [[complex number]]s or [[quaternion]]s. In the [[complex plane]] every non-zero number has a [[polar coordinate]] expression {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''r'' [[cis (mathematics)|cis]](''a'') = ''r'' cos(''a'') + ''r''i sin(''a'')}} where {{nowrap|''r'' > 0}} and ''a'' is in {{nowrap|[0, 2{{pi}})}}.\nA turn of the complex plane arises from multiplying {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + i''y''}} by an element {{nowrap|1=''u'' = exp(''b'' i)}} that lies on the [[unit circle]]:\n: ''z'' ↦ ''uz''.\n[[Frank Morley]] consistently referred to elements of the unit circle as ''turns'' in the book ''Inversive Geometry'', (1933) which he coauthored with his son Frank Vigor Morley.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inversive Geometry |author-first1=Frank |author-last1=Morley |author-link1=Frank Morley |author-first2=Frank Vigor |author-last2=Morley |orig-year=1933 |date=2014 |publisher=Ginn and Company, reprint: [[Courier Corporation]], [[Dover Publications]] |location=Boston, USA; New York, USA |isbn=978-0-486-49339-8 |id=0-486-49339-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gu8WAgAAQBAJ |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref>\n\nThe Latin term for ''turn'' is [[versor]], which is a [[quaternion]] that can be visualized as an [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a [[great circle]].

For the kinematics of rotation in [[three dimensions]], see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]. This algebraic expression of rotation was initiated by [[W. R.

It is used in three-[[dimension]]al geometry, and is analogous to the [[radian]], which quantifies [[planar angles]]. Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, gives a ''length'' on the circumference, a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, gives an ''area'' on the surface. The name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] στερεός ''stereos'' 'solid' + radian.\n\nThe steradian, like the radian, is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] unit, the area subtended and the square of its distance from the center: both the numerator and denominator of this ratio have dimension length squared (i.e. {{nowrap|1=L{{sup|2}}/L{{sup|2}} = 1}}, dimensionless). It is useful, however, to distinguish between dimensionless quantities of a different nature, so the symbol \"sr\" is used to indicate a solid angle. For example, [[radiant intensity]] can be measured in watts per steradian (W⋅sr<sup>−1</sup>). The steradian was formerly an [[SI supplementary unit]], but this category was abolished in 1995 and the steradian is now considered an [[SI derived unit]].\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA steradian can be defined as the solid angle [[subtended angle|subtended]] at the center of a [[unit sphere]] by a unit [[area]] on its surface. For a general sphere of [[radius]] ''r'', any portion of its surface with area {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''r''<sup>2</sup>}} subtends one steradian at its center.<ref>\"Steradian\", ''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms'', fifth edition, Sybil P. Parker, editor in chief. McGraw-Hill, 1997. {{ISBN|0-07-052433-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe solid angle is related to the area it cuts out of a sphere:\n::<math>\\Omega = \\frac{A}{r^2}\\ \\mathrm{sr} \\, = \\frac{2\\pi h}{r}\\ \\mathrm{sr}</math>\n:where\n::{{mvar|A}} is the [[surface area]] of the [[spherical cap]], <math>2\\pi rh</math>,\n::{{mvar|r}} is the radius of the sphere, and\n::sr is the unit, steradian.\n\nBecause the surface area ''A'' of a sphere is 4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>, the definition implies that a sphere subtends 4{{pi}} steradians (≈&nbsp;12.56637&nbsp;sr) at its center. By the same argument, the maximum solid angle that can be subtended at any point is 4{{pi}}&nbsp;sr.\n\n== Other properties ==\n[[File:Steradian cone and cap.svg|thumb|right|Section of cone (1) and spherical cap (2) that subtend a solid angle of one steradian inside a sphere]]\nIf {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''r''<sup>2</sup>}}, it corresponds to the area of a [[spherical cap]] ({{nowrap|1=''A'' = 2{{pi}}''rh''}}) (where ''h'' stands for the \"height\" of the cap) and the relationship {{nowrap|1={{sfrac|''h''|''r''}} = {{sfrac|1|2{{pi}}}}}} holds. Therefore, in this case, one steradian corresponds to the plane (i.e. radian) angle of the cross-section of a simple cone subtending the plane angle 2''θ'', with ''θ'' given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\theta & = \\arccos \\left( \\frac{r-h}{r} \\right)\\\\\n       & = \\arccos \\left( 1 - \\frac{h}{r} \\right)\\\\\n       & = \\arccos \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\right) \\approx 0.572 \\,\\text{ rad,} \\text{ or } 32.77^\\circ.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis angle corresponds to the plane aperture angle of 2''θ'' ≈&nbsp;1.144 rad or 65.54°.\n\nA steradian is also equal to the spherical area of a [[polygon]] having an [[angle excess]] of 1&nbsp;radian, to {{sfrac|1|4{{pi}}}} of a complete [[sphere]], or to {{resize|150%|(}}{{sfrac|180°|{{pi}}}}{{resize|150%|)}}{{su|p=2}} ≈ 3282.80635 [[square degree]]s.\n\nThe solid angle of a cone whose cross-section subtends the angle 2''θ'' is:\n\n:<math>\\Omega = 2\\pi\\left(1 - \\cos\\theta\\right)\\,\\mathrm{sr}</math>.\n\n== SI multiples ==\n\nMillisteradians (msr) and microsteradians (μsr) are occasionally used to describe [[light beam|light]] and [[particle beam|particle]] beams.<ref>Stephen M.

Originally defined as the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]], it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].  It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter \"[[Pi (letter)|{{pi}}]]\" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as \"'''pi'''\". It is also called '''Archimedes' constant'''.\n\nBeing an [[irrational number]], {{pi}} cannot be expressed as a [[common fraction]] (equivalently, its [[decimal representation]] never ends and never [[repeating decimal|settles into a permanently repeating pattern]]). Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to [[Approximations of π|approximate]] {{pi}}. The digits appear to be [[random sequence|randomly distributed]]. In particular, the digit sequence of {{pi}} is conjectured to satisfy a [[normal number|specific kind of statistical randomness]], but to date, no proof of this has been discovered. Also, {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]]; that is, it is not the [[Root of a polynomial|root]] of any [[polynomial]] having [[Rational number|rational]] [[coefficient]]s. This transcendence of {{pi}} implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of [[squaring the circle]] with a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]].\n\n[[History of mathematics|Ancient civilizations]] required fairly accurate computed values to approximate {{pi}} for practical reasons, including the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]]. Around 250 BC the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archimedes]] created an algorithm for calculating it. In the 5th century AD [[Chinese mathematics]] approximated {{pi}} to seven digits, while [[Indian mathematics]] made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The historically first exact formula for {{pi}}, based on [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], was not available until a millennium later, when in the 14th century the [[Leibniz formula for pi|Madhava–Leibniz series]] was discovered in Indian mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Special Functions |first1=George E. |last1=Andrews |first2=Richard |last2=Askey |first3=Ranjan |last3=Roy |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-78988-2|page=58|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|first=R.C.|last=Gupta|title=On the remainder term in the Madhava–Leibniz's series|journal=Ganita Bharati|volume=14|issue=1–4|year=1992|pages=68–71|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and [[computer science|computer scientists]] discovered new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of {{pi}} to many trillions of digits after the decimal point.<ref>[http://www.pi2e.ch/ π<sup>e</sup> trillion digits of π] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206063441/http://www.pi2e.ch/ |date=6 December 2016 }} <!-- – the exact number of digits increases periodically – it should not be included in this article by citing only a [[WP:PRIMARY|primary reference source]]. --></ref><ref>[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/calculating-31-4-trillion-digits-of-archimedes-constant-on-google-cloud Pi in the sky: Calculating a record-breaking 31.4 trillion digits of Archimedes’ constant on Google Cloud]</ref> Practically all scientific applications require no more than a few hundred digits of {{pi}}, and many substantially fewer, so the primary motivation for these computations is the quest to find more efficient algorithms for calculating lengthy numeric series, as well as the desire to break records.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first1=David |last1=Bailey |first2=Jonathan |last2=Borwein |first3=Peter |last3=Borwein |first4=Simon |last4=Plouffe |title=The Quest for Pi|journal=[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]|year=1997|volume=19|issue=1|pages=50–56|doi=10.1007/bf03024340|citeseerx=10.1.1.138.7085}}</ref> The extensive calculations involved have also been used to test [[supercomputer]]s and high-precision multiplication [[algorithms]].\n\nBecause its most elementary definition relates to the circle, {{pi}} is found in many formulae in [[trigonometry]] and [[geometry]], especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres. In more modern [[mathematical analysis]], the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the [[real number]] system, as an [[eigenvalue]] or a [[periodic function|period]], without any reference to geometry.  It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as [[number theory]] and [[statistics]], as well as in almost all areas of [[physics]]. The ubiquity of {{pi}} makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community. Several books devoted to {{pi}} have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of {{pi}} often result in news headlines.

First, the discovery of new [[iterative algorithm]]s for computing {{pi}}, which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of [[Multiplication algorithm#Fast multiplication algorithms for large inputs|fast multiplication algorithms]] that could multiply large numbers very rapidly.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=15–17}}</ref> Such algorithms are particularly important in modern {{pi}} computations because most of the computer's time is devoted to multiplication.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=131}}</ref> They include the [[Karatsuba algorithm]], [[Toom–Cook multiplication]], and [[FFT multiplication#Fourier transform methods|Fourier transform-based methods]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=132, 140}}</ref>\n\nThe iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by physicist [[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|Eugene Salamin]] and scientist [[Richard Brent (scientist)|Richard Brent]].<ref name=\"Arndt_j\">{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=87}}</ref> These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in what is now termed the [[AGM method|arithmetic–geometric mean method]] (AGM method) or [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]].<ref name=\"Arndt_j\" /> As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.\n\nThe iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally ''multiply'' the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, brothers [[Jonathan Borwein|John]] and [[Peter Borwein]] produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=111 (5 times); pp. 113–114 (4 times)}}.<br />See {{harvnb|Borwein|Borwein|1987}} for details of algorithms.</ref> Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician [[Yasumasa Kanada]] to set several records for computing {{pi}} between 1995 and 2002.<ref name=\"Background\" /> This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.<ref name=\"Background\">{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David H.|url=http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|title=Some Background on Kanada's Recent Pi Calculation|date=16 May 2003|accessdate=12 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415102439/http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Motives for computing {{pi}}===\n[[File:Record pi approximations.svg|thumb|400px|right|As mathematicians discovered new algorithms, and computers became available, the number of known decimal digits of {{pi}} increased dramatically.

The associated eigenvalues form the [[arithmetic progression]] of integer multiples of {{pi}}.]]\nMany of the appearances of {{pi}} in the formulas of mathematics and the sciences have to do with its close relationship with geometry.  However, {{pi}} also appears in many natural situations having apparently nothing to do with geometry.\n\nIn many applications, it plays a distinguished role as an [[eigenvalue]].  For example, an idealized [[vibrating string]] can be modelled as the graph of a function {{math|''f''}} on the unit interval {{math|[0,1]}}, with [[boundary conditions|fixed ends]] {{math|1=''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = 0}}.  The modes of vibration of the string are solutions of the [[differential equation]] {{math|1=''f'' \"(''x'') + λ ''f''(''x'') = 0}}.  Here {{math|λ}} is an associated eigenvalue, which is constrained by [[Sturm–Liouville theory]] to take on only certain specific values.  It must be positive, since the second derivative is [[negative definite]], so it is convenient to write {{math|1=λ = ν<sup>2</sup>}} where {{math|ν > 0}} is called the [[wavenumber]].  Then {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = sin(π ''x'')}} satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation with {{math|1=ν = π}}.<ref>{{citation |last=Hilbert |first=David |author1link=David Hilbert |last2=Courant |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Courant |title=Methods of mathematical physics, volume 1 |pages=286–290 |year=1966 |publisher=Wiley}}</ref>\n\nThe value {{pi}} is, in fact, the ''least'' such value of the wavenumber, and is associated with the [[fundamental mode]] of vibration of the string.  One way to obtain this is by estimating the [[energy]]. The energy satisfies an inequality, [[Wirtinger's inequality for functions]],<ref>{{citation|first1=H. |last1=Dym |first2=H.P. |last2=McKean |title=Fourier series and integrals |publisher=Academic Press |year=1972 |page=47}}</ref> which states that if a function {{math|''f'' : [0, 1] → ℂ}} is given such that {{math|1=''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = 0}} and {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''f'' '}} are both [[square integrable]], then the inequality holds:\n:<math>\\pi^2\\int_0^1|f(x)|^2\\,dx\\le \\int_0^1|f'(x)|^2\\,dx,</math>\nand the case of equality holds precisely when {{math|''f''}} is a multiple of {{math|sin(π ''x'')}}. So {{pi}} appears as an optimal constant in Wirtinger's inequality, and from this it follows that it is the smallest such wavenumber, using the [[variational theorem|variational characterization]] of the eigenvalue.  As a consequence, {{pi}} is the smallest [[singular value]] of the derivative on the space of functions on {{math|[0,1]}} vanishing at both endpoints (the [[Sobolev space]] <math>H^1_0[0,1]</math>).\n\n===Inequalities===\n[[File:Sir William Thompson illustration of Carthage.png|thumb|right|The [[ancient Carthage|ancient city of Carthage]] was the solution to an isoperimetric problem, according to a legend recounted by [[Lord Kelvin]] {{harv|Thompson|1894}}: those lands bordering the sea that [[Dido|Queen Dido]] could enclose on all other sides within a single given oxhide, cut into strips.]]\nThe number {{pi}} serves appears in similar eigenvalue problems in higher-dimensional analysis.

This interpretation implies a brim about 0.225 cubit (or, assuming an 18-inch \"cubit\", some 4&nbsp;inches), or one and a third \"[[handbreadth]]s,\" thick (cf. {{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:24||NKJV|}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|4:3||NKJV}}).\n* [[Maimonides]] states (ca. 1168 CE) that {{pi}} can only be known approximately, so the value 3 was given as accurate enough for religious purposes. This is taken by some<ref>[[Wilbur Knorr|Wilbur Richard Knorr]], The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems, New York: Dover Publications, 1993.</ref> as the earliest assertion that {{pi}} is irrational.\n* Another rabbinical explanation{{by whom|date=April 2015}}{{year needed|date=April 2015}} invokes [[gematria]]: In {{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:23||NKJV}} the word translated 'measuring line' appears in the Hebrew text spelled QWH קַוה, but elsewhere the word is most usually spelled QW קַו. The ratio of the numerical values of these Hebrew spellings is {{frac|111|106}}. If the putative value of 3 is multiplied by this ratio, one obtains {{frac|333|106}} = 3.141509433...&nbsp;– giving 5 correct digits, which is within 1/10,000 of the true value of {{pi}}. For this to work, it must be assumed that the measuring line is different for the diameter and circumference.\n\nThere is still some debate on this passage in biblical scholarship.{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}<ref>\n{{cite web\n|first=H.

He started with inscribed and circumscribed regular hexagons, whose perimeters are readily determined. He then shows how to calculate the perimeters of regular polygons of twice as many sides that are inscribed and circumscribed about the same circle. This is a recursive procedure which would be described today as follows: Let {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''P''<sub>''k''</sub>}} denote the perimeters of regular polygons of {{math|''k''}} sides that are inscribed and circumscribed about the same circle, respectively. Then,\n:<math>P_{2n} = \\frac{2p_nP_n}{p_n + P_n}, \\quad \\quad p_{2n} = \\sqrt{p_n P_{2n}}.</math>\nArchimedes uses this to successively compute {{math|''P''<sub>12</sub>, ''p''<sub>12</sub>, ''P''<sub>24</sub>, ''p''<sub>24</sub>, ''P''<sub>48</sub>, ''p''<sub>48</sub>, ''P''<sub>96</sub>}} and {{math|''p''<sub>96</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1992|page=131}}</ref> Using these last values he obtains\n:<math>3 \\frac{10}{71} < \\pi < 3 \\frac{1}{7}.</math>\nIt is not known why Archimedes stopped at a 96-sided polygon; it only takes patience to extend the computations.

Trigonometry, in the form of a table of chord lengths in a circle, was probably used by [[Claudius Ptolemaeus|Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria]] to obtain the value of {{pi}} given in the ''Almagest'' (circa 150 CE).<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1992|page=118}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in the approximation of {{pi}} (when the methods are known) were made by increasing the number of sides of the polygons used in the computation. A trigonometric improvement by [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] (1621) obtains better bounds from a pair of bounds gotten from the polygon method. Thus, more accurate results were obtained from polygons with fewer sides.<ref name=EvesSnell>{{harvnb|Eves|1992|page=119}}</ref> [[Viète's formula]], published by [[François Viète]] in 1593, was derived by Viète using a closely related polygonal method, but with areas rather than perimeters of polygons whose numbers of sides are powers of two.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckmann|1971|pages=94–95}}</ref>\n\nThe last major attempt to compute {{pi}} by this method was carried out by Grienberger in 1630 who calculated 39 decimal places of {{pi}} using Snell's refinement.<ref name=EvesSnell/>\n\n===Machin-like formula===\n{{main|Machin-like formula}}\nFor fast calculations, one may use formulae such as [[John Machin|Machin's]]:\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi}{4} = 4 \\arctan\\frac{1}{5} - \\arctan\\frac{1}{239} </math>\ntogether with the [[Taylor series]] expansion of the function [[arctan]](''x'').

The following Machin-like formulæ were used for this:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 12 \\arctan\\frac{1}{49} + 32 \\arctan\\frac{1}{57} - 5 \\arctan\\frac{1}{239} + 12 \\arctan\\frac{1}{110443}</math>\n:K.

In this base, {{pi}} can be approximated to eight (decimal) significant figures with the number 3:8:29:44{{sub|60}}, which is\n\n:<math> 3 + \\frac{8}{60} + \\frac{29}{60^2} + \\frac{44}{60^3} = 3.14159\\ 259^+</math>\n\n(The next [[sexagesimal]] digit is 0, causing truncation here to yield a relatively good approximation.)\n\nIn addition, the following expressions can be used to estimate {{pi}}:\n* accurate to three digits:\n::<math>\\frac{22}{7} = 3.143^+</math>\n* accurate to three digits:\n:: <math>\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = 3.146^+</math>\n: [[Karl Popper]] conjectured that [[Plato]] knew this expression, that he believed it to be exactly {{pi}}, and that this is responsible for some of Plato's confidence in the [[omnicompetence]] of mathematical geometry—and Plato's repeated discussion of special [[right triangle]]s that are either [[isosceles]] or halves of [[equilateral]] triangles.\n:: <math>\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt {3} + 1 = 3.140^+</math>\n* accurate to four digits:\n::<math>\\sqrt[3]{31} = 3.1413^+</math><ref>{{Cite journal|first=Martin|last=Gardner|authorlink=Martin Gardner|title=New Mathematical Diversions|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=1995|page=92}}</ref>\n* accurate to four digits (or five significant figures):\n::<math>\\sqrt{7+\\sqrt{6+\\sqrt{5}}} = 3.1416^+</math><ref>[http://www.mschneider.cc/papers/pi.pdf A nested radical approximation for {{pi}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706215615/http://www.mschneider.cc/papers/pi.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }}</ref>\n* an approximation by [[Ramanujan]], accurate to 4 digits (or five significant figures):\n::<math>\\frac{9}{5}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{5}} = 3.1416^+</math>\n* accurate to five digits:\n::<math>\\frac{7^7}{4^9} = 3.14156^+</math>\n* accurate to seven digits:\n::<math>\\frac{355}{113} = 3.14159\\ 29^+</math>\n*accurate to nine digits:\n:: <math> \\sqrt[4]{3^4+2^4+\\frac{1}{2+(\\frac{2}{3})^2}} =\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2143}{22}} = 3.14159\\ 2652^+</math>\n: This is from [[Ramanujan]], who claimed the [[Namagiri Thayar|Goddess of Namagiri]] appeared to him in a dream and told him the true value of {{pi}}.<ref>\"Lost notebook page 16\" ,Ramanujan</ref>\n* accurate to ten digits:\n::<math>\\frac{63}{25} \\times \\frac{17 + 15\\sqrt{5}}{7 + 15\\sqrt{5}} = 3.14159\\ 26538^+</math>\n* accurate to ten digits (or eleven significant figures):\n::<math>\\sqrt[193]{\\frac{10^{100}}{11222.11122}} = 3.14159\\ 26536^+</math>\n:This curious approximation follows the observation that the 193rd power of 1/{{pi}} yields the sequence 1122211125...

These approximations are the best possible rational approximations of {{pi}} relative to the size of their denominators. Here is a list of the first thirteen of these:<ref>{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A002485 |name=Numerators of convergents to Pi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A002486 |name=Denominators of convergents to Pi}}</ref>\n:: <math>\\frac{3}{1}, \\frac{22}{7}, \\frac{333}{106}, \\frac{355}{113}, \\frac{103993}{33102}, \\frac{104348}{33215}, \\frac{208341}{66317}, \\frac{312689}{99532}, \\frac{833719}{265381}, \\frac{1146408}{364913}, \\frac{4272943}{1360120}, \\frac{5419351}{1725033}</math>\n:Of all of these, <math>\\frac{355}{113}</math> is the only fraction in this sequence that gives more exact digits of {{pi}} (i.e. 7) than the number of digits needed to approximate it (i.e. 6). The accuracy can be improved by using other fractions with larger numerators and denominators, but, for most such fractions, more digits are required in the approximation than correct significant figures achieved in the result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qin.laya.com/tech_projects_approxpi.html|title=Fractional Approximations of Pi|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Summing a circle's area===\n[[File:Pi 30K.gif|thumb|right|Numerical approximation of {{pi}}: as points are randomly scattered inside the unit square, some fall within the unit circle. The fraction of points inside the circle approaches {{math|π/4}} as points are added.]]\n\nPi can be obtained from a circle if its radius and area are known using the relationship:\n:<math> A = \\pi r^2.</math>\n\nIf a circle with radius ''{{math|r}}'' is drawn with its center at the point (0,&nbsp;0), any point whose distance from the origin is less than ''{{math|r}}'' will fall inside the circle. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] gives the distance from any point ({{math|''x''}},&nbsp;{{math|''y''}}) to the center:\n:<math>d=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.</math>\n\nMathematical \"graph paper\" is formed by imagining a 1×1 square centered around each cell ({{math|''x''}},&nbsp;{{math|''y''}}), where {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[integer]]s between −{{math|r}} and {{math|r}}. Squares whose center resides inside or exactly on the border of the circle can then be counted by testing whether, for each cell ({{math|''x''}},&nbsp;{{math|''y''}}),\n:<math>\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\le r.</math>\n\nThe total number of cells satisfying that condition thus approximates the area of the circle, which then can be used to calculate an approximation of {{pi}}. Closer approximations can be produced by using larger values of {{math|r}}.\n\nMathematically, this formula can be written:\n:<math>\\pi = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\sum_{x=-r}^{r} \\; \\sum_{y=-r}^{r} \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\le r \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} > r. \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nIn other words, begin by choosing a value for {{math|r}}. Consider all cells ({{math|''x''}},&nbsp;{{math|''y''}}) in which both {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are integers between −{{math|r}} and {{math|r}}. Starting at 0, add 1 for each cell whose distance to the origin (0,0) is less than or equal to ''{{math|r}}''. When finished, divide the sum, representing the area of a circle of radius {{math|r}}, by {{math|r}}<sup>2</sup> to find the approximation of {{pi}}.\nFor example, if {{math|r}} is 5, then the cells considered are:\n:{| style=\"font-size:75%;text-align:center;color:blue;height:1em\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|- style=\"color:black\"\n| (−5,5) || (−4,5) || (−3,5) || (−2,5) || (−1,5) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (0,5) || (1,5) || (2,5) || (3,5) || (4,5) || (5,5)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,4) || style=\"color:black\" | (−4,4) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (−3,4) || (−2,4) || (−1,4) || (0,4) || (1,4) || (2,4) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (3,4) || style=\"color:black\" | (4,4) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,4)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,3) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (−4,3) || (−3,3) || (−2,3) || (−1,3) || (0,3) || (1,3) || (2,3) || (3,3) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (4,3) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,3)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,2) || (−4,2) || (−3,2) || (−2,2) || (−1,2) || (0,2) || (1,2) || (2,2) || (3,2) || (4,2) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,2)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,1) || (−4,1) || (−3,1) || (−2,1) || (−1,1) || (0,1) || (1,1) || (2,1) || (3,1) || (4,1) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,1)\n|-\n| style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (−5,0) || (−4,0) || (−3,0) || (−2,0) || (−1,0) || (0,0) || (1,0) || (2,0) || (3,0) || (4,0) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (5,0)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,−1) || (−4,−1) || (−3,−1) || (−2,−1) || (−1,−1) || (0,−1) || (1,−1) || (2,−1) || (3,−1) || (4,−1) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,−1)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,−2) || (−4,−2) || (−3,−2) || (−2,−2) || (−1,−2) || (0,−2) || (1,−2) || (2,−2) || (3,−2) || (4,−2) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,−2)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,−3) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (−4,−3) || (−3,−3) || (−2,−3) || (−1,−3) || (0,−3) || (1,−3) || (2,−3) || (3,−3) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (4,−3) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,−3)\n|-\n| style=\"color:black\" | (−5,−4) || style=\"color:black\" | (−4,−4) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (−3,−4) || (−2,−4) || (−1,−4) || (0,−4) || (1,−4) || (2,−4) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (3,−4) || style=\"color:black\" | (4,−4) || style=\"color:black\" | (5,−4)\n|- style=\"color:black\"\n| (−5,−5) || (−4,−5) || (−3,−5) || (−2,−5) || (−1,−5) || style=\"color:#bc1e47\" | (0,−5) || (1,−5) || (2,−5) || (3,−5) || (4,−5) || (5,−5)\n|}\n\n[[File:Kreuz-5.svg|right|250px|thumb|This circle as it would be drawn on a [[Cartesian coordinate]] graph.

They typically implement [[checkpointing]] and efficient [[paging|disk swapping]] to facilitate extremely long-running and memory-expensive computations.\n* '''{{math|''y''}}-cruncher''' by Alexander Yee<ref name=\"Yee2016\"/> is the program which every world record holder since Shigeru Kondo in 2010 have used to compute [[#21st century – current claimed world record|world record numbers of digits]]. {{math|''y''}}-cruncher can also be used to calculate other constants and holds world records for several of them.\n* '''PiFast''' by Xavier Gourdon was the fastest program for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2003. According to its author, it can compute one million digits in 3.5 seconds on a 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[Pentium 4]].<ref>\"[http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/PiProgram/timings.html PiFast timings]\"</ref> PiFast can also compute other irrational numbers like ''[[e (mathematical constant)|{{math|''e''}}]]'' and [[square root of 2|{{math|{{radic|2}}}}]]. It can also work at lesser efficiency with very little memory (down to a few tens of megabytes to compute well over a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) digits). This tool is a popular benchmark in the [[overclocking]] community. PiFast 4.4 is available from [http://members.shaw.ca/francislyster/pi/pi.html Stu's Pi page]. PiFast 4.3 is available from Gourdon's page.\n* '''QuickPi''' by Steve Pagliarulo for Windows is faster than PiFast for runs of under 400 million digits.

See in particular pp. 283–285.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe most familiar examples of curves of constant width are the [[circle]] and the [[Reuleaux triangle]].  For a circle, the width is the same as the [[diameter]]; a circle of width ''w'' has [[perimeter]] π''w''.  A Reuleaux triangle of width ''w'' consists of three [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]s of circles of [[radius]] ''w''.  Each of these arcs has [[central angle]] π/3, so the perimeter of the Reuleaux triangle of width ''w'' is equal to half the perimeter of a circle of radius ''w'' and therefore is equal to π''w''.  A similar analysis of other simple examples such as [[Reuleaux polygon]]s gives the same answer.\n\n==Proofs==\nOne proof of the theorem uses the properties of [[Minkowski sum]]s. If ''K'' is a body of constant width ''w'', then the Minkowski sum of ''K'' and its 180° rotation is a disk with radius ''w'' and perimeter 2π''w''. However, the Minkowski sum acts linearly on the perimeters of convex bodies, so the perimeter of ''K'' must be half the perimeter of this disk, which is π''w'' as the theorem states.<ref>[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Barbier.shtml The Theorem of Barbier (Java)] at [[cut-the-knot]].</ref>\n\nAlternatively, the theorem follows immediately from the [[Crofton formula]] in [[integral geometry]] according to which the length of any curve equals the measure of the set of lines that cross the curve, multiplied by their numbers of crossings. Any two curves that have the same constant width are crossed by sets of lines with the same measure, and therefore they have the same length. Historically, Crofton derived his formula later than, and independently of, Barbier's theorem.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Sylvester | first = J.

In relative chronology, they predate  [[Apastamba|Āpastamba]], which is dated by [[Robert Lingat]] to the ''sutra'' period proper,  between c. 500 to 200 BCE. Robert Lingat, The Classical Law of India, (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt Ltd, 1993), p. 20</ref>\n\nThe Baudhayana sūtras consist of six texts:\n# the [[Baudhayana Shrauta Sutra|{{IAST|Śrautasûtra}}]], probably in 19 {{IAST|Praśnas}} (questions), \n# the {{IAST|Karmāntasûtra}} in 20 {{IAST|Adhyāyas}} (chapters), \n# the {{IAST|Dvaidhasûtra}} in 4 {{IAST|Praśnas}}, \n# the [[Grhyasutra|Grihyasutra]] in 4 {{IAST|Praśnas}}, \n# the [[Dharmasutra|{{IAST|Dharmasûtra}}]] in 4 {{IAST|Praśnas}} and \n# the [[Sulba Sutras|{{IAST|Śulbasûtra}}]] in 3 {{IAST|Adhyāyas}}.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe14/sbe1403.htm ''Sacred Books of the East'', vol.14 – Introduction to Baudhayana]</ref>\n\nThe '''''{{IAST |Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra}}''''' is noted for  containing several early mathematical results, including  an approximation of the [[square root of 2]] and the statement of a version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].<ref>{{citation |first=Meera |last=Nanda |title=Hindutva's science envy |url=http://www.frontline.in/science-and-technology/hindutvas-science-envy/article9049883.ece |newspaper=Frontline |date=16 September 2016 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Baudhāyana Shrautasūtra==\n{{main|Baudhayana Shrauta Sutra}}\nHis [[Śrauta|shrauta]] sūtras related to performing [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[sacrifice]]s has followers in some [[Smartism|Smārta]] [[brāhmaṇa]]s ([[Iyers]]) and some [[Iyengar]]s of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Yajurveda|Yajurvedis]] or [[Namboothiri]]s of [[Kerala]], Gurukkal Brahmins (Aadi Saivas), among others.  The followers of this sūtra follow a different method and do 24 Tila-tarpaṇa, as  Lord [[Krishna]] had done tarpaṇa on the day before [[Amavasya|amāvāsyā]];  they call themselves Baudhāyana Amavasya.\n\n==Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra==\nThe Dharmasūtra of Baudhāyana like that of [[Apastamba]] also forms a part of the larger [[Kalpa Sūtra|Kalpasutra]]. Likewise, it is composed of ''[[praśna]]s'' which literally means 'questions' or books. The structure of this Dharmasūtra is not very clear because it came down in an incomplete manner. Moreover, the text has undergone alterations in the form of additions and explanations over a period of time. The ''praśnas'' consist of the [[Srautasutra]] and other ritual treatises, the Sulvasutra which deals with vedic geometry, and the [[Grhyasutra]] which deals with domestic rituals.<ref name=\"Patrick Olivelle 1999 p.127\">Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999), p. 127</ref>\n\nThere are no commentaries on this Dharmasūtra with the exception of [[Govindasvāmi]]n's ''Vivaraṇa''. The date of the commentary is uncertain but according to Olivelle it is not very ancient. Also the commentary is inferior in comparison to that of Haradatta on Āpastamba and Gautama.<ref name=\"Patrick Olivelle 1999\">Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999), p. xxxi</ref> \n\nThis Dharmasūtra is divided into four books. Olivelle states that Book One and the first sixteen chapters of Book Two are the 'Proto-Baudhayana'<ref name=\"Patrick Olivelle 1999 p.127\" /> even though this section has undergone alteration. Scholars like Bühler and Kane agree that the last two books of the Dharmasūtra are later additions. Chapter 17 and 18 in Book Two lays emphasis on various types of ascetics and acetic practices.<ref name=\"Patrick Olivelle 1999 p.127\" />\n\nThe first book is primarily devoted to the student and deals in topics related to studentship. It also refers to social classes, the role of the king, marriage, and suspension of Vedic recitation. Book two refers to penances, inheritance, women, householder, orders of life, ancestral offerings. Book three refers to holy householders, forest hermit and penances. Book four primarily refers to the yogic practices and penances along with offenses regarding marriage.<ref>Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999), pp. 128–131</ref>\n\n==Baudhāyana Sulbasūtra==\n\n===Pythagorean theorem===\n\nIt is also referred to as Baudhayana theorem.\nThe most notable of the rules—the Sulbasūtra-s do not generally contain axiomatic proofs for the rules which they describe—in the ''Baudhāyana Sulba Sūtra'' says:\n\n<blockquote>\nदीर्घचतुरश्रस्याक्ष्णया रज्जु: पार्श्र्वमानी तिर्यग् मानी च यत् पृथग् भूते कुरूतस्तदुभयं करोति ॥<br /><br />\n''dīrghachatursrasyākṣaṇayā rajjuḥ pārśvamānī, tiryagmānī,''<br />\n''cha yatpṛthagbhūte kurutastadubhayāṅ karoti.''<br />\n:A rope stretched along the length of the [[diagonal]] produces an [[area]] which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.<ref>[[Subhash Kak]], Pythagorean Triples and Cryptographic Coding, https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+kak/0/1/0/all/0/1?skip=25&query_id=a7b95a2782affe4b </ref></blockquote>\n\nThe diagonal and sides referred to are those of a rectangle, and the areas are those of the squares having these line segments as their sides.  Since the diagonal of a rectangle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by two adjacent sides, the statement is seen to be equivalent to the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nBaudhāyana also provides a statement using a rope measure of the reduced form of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles [[right triangle]]:\n\n:''The cord which is stretched across a square produces an area double the size of the original square.''\n\n===Circling the square===\nAnother problem tackled by Baudhāyana is that of finding a circle whose area is the same as that of a square (the reverse of [[squaring the circle]]). His sūtra i.58 gives this construction:\n\n:''Draw half its diagonal about the centre towards the East–West line; then describe a circle together with a third part of that which lies outside the square. ''\n\nExplanation:\n*Draw the half-diagonal of the square, which  is larger than the half-side by <math>x = {a \\over 2}\\sqrt{2}- {a \\over 2}</math>.\n*Then draw a circle with radius <math>{a \\over 2} + {x \\over 3}</math>, or <math>{a \\over 2} + {a \\over 6}(\\sqrt{2}-1)</math>, which equals <math>{a \\over 6}(2 + \\sqrt{2})</math>.\n* Now <math>(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\approx 11.66 \\approx {36.6\\over \\pi}</math>, so the area <math>{\\pi}r^2 \\approx \\pi \\times {a^2 \\over 6^2} \\times {36.6\\over \\pi} \\approx a^2</math>.\n\n===Square root of 2===\nBaudhāyana i.61-2 (elaborated in Āpastamba Sulbasūtra i.6)\ngives the length of the diagonal of a square in terms of its sides, which is equivalent to a formula for the [[square root of 2]]:\n\n:''samasya dvikaraṇī. pramāṇaṃ tṛtīyena vardhayet <br /> tac caturthenātmacatustriṃśonena saviśeṣaḥ''\n\n: The diagonal [lit. \"doubler\"] of a square. The measure is to be increased by a third and by a fourth decreased by the 34th. That is its diagonal approximately.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThat is,\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} \\approx  1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot4 \\cdot 34} = \\frac{577}{408} \\approx 1.414216,</math>\n\nwhich is correct to five decimals.<ref name=\"Baudhayana\">O'Connor, \"Baudhayana\".</ref>\n\nOther theorems include: diagonals of rectangle bisect each other, diagonals of rhombus bisect at right angles, area of a square formed by joining the middle points of a square is half of original, the\nmidpoints of a rectangle joined forms a rhombus whose area is half the rectangle, etc.\n\nNote the emphasis on rectangles and squares; this arises from the need to specify ''yajña bhūmikā''s—i.e. the altar on which a rituals were conducted, including fire offerings (yajña).  This is an aspect of [[Vastu Shastra|Vaastu Shastras]] and [[Shilpa Shastras]].  These theroms are derived from those texts.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indian mathematics]]\n*[[List of Indian mathematicians]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* George Gheverghese Joseph.

He is known as a co-author of the paper which presented the [[Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula|Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe  algorithm]] (discovered by [[Simon Plouffe]]) for computing [[Pi|π]].\n\n==First interest in mathematics==\n\nBorwein became interested in [[number theory]] and classical analysis during his second year of university. He had not previously been interested in math, although his father was the head of the [[University of Western Ontario]]'s mathematics department and his mother is associate dean of medicine there. Borwein and his two siblings majored in mathematics.\n\n==Academic career==\n\nAfter completing a Bachelor of Science in Honours Math at the University of Western Ontario in 1974, he went on to complete an [[Master's degree|MSc]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of British Columbia]]. He joined the Department of Mathematics at [[Dalhousie University]]. While he was there, he, his brother [[Jonathan Borwein]] and [[David H. Bailey (mathematician)|David H. Bailey]] of [[NASA]] wrote the 1989 paper that showed a proof for computing one billion digits of π. They won the 1993 [[Chauvenet Prize]] and [[Hasse Prize]].\n\nIn 1993, he moved to Simon Fraser University, joining his brother Jonathan in establishing the [[Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics]] (CECM) where he developed the [[Inverse Symbolic Calculator]].\n\n== Research ==\n\nIn 1995, the Borweins collaborated with [[Yasumasa Kanada]] of the [[University of Tokyo]] to compute [[pi|π]] to more than four billion digits.\n\nBorwein has developed an algorithm that applies [[Chebyshev polynomial]]s to the [[Dirichlet eta function]] to produce a [[Dirichlet eta function#Borwein's method|very rapidly convergent series suitable for high precision numerical calculations]], which he published on the occasion of the awarding of an honorary doctorate to his brother, Jonathan.<ref>{{cite book|first = Peter|last = Borwein|chapter-url = http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/pborwein/PAPERS/P155.pdf|chapter = An Efficient Algorithm for the Riemann Zeta Function|series = Conference Proceedings, Canadian Mathematical Society|year = 2000|title = Constructive, Experimental, and Nonlinear Analysis|volume = 27|pages = 29–34|isbn = 978-0-8218-2167-1|editor-first = Michel A.|editor-last = Théra|publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]], on behalf of the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]]|location = Providence, RI}}</ref>\n\nPeter Borwein also collaborated with [[NASA]]'s David Bailey and the [[Université du Québec]]'s [[Simon Plouffe]] to calculate the individual [[hexadecimal]] digits of π. This provided a way for mathematicians to determine the ''n''th digit of π without calculating preceding digits.

He emigrated to the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Biography==\nVan Ceulen moved to [[Delft]] to teach [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]] and [[mathematics]] and in 1594 opened a fencing school in [[Leiden]]. In 1600 he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at the Engineering School,  Duytsche Mathematique, established by Prince Maurice of Orange at the relatively new [[Leiden University]].  He shared this professorial level at the school with the surveyor and cartographer, {{Interlanguage link multi|Simon Fransz van Merwen|nl}},  which shows that the intention was to promote practical, rather than theoretical instruction.\n\nThe curriculum for the new Engineering School was devised by [[Simon Stevin]] who continued to act as the personal advisor to the Prince. At first the professors at Leiden refused to accept the status of Van Ceulen and Van Merwen, especially as they taught in Dutch rather than Latin.  Theological professors generally believed that practical courses were not acceptable studies for a university, but they were not willing to reject the School outright since it was founded by Prince Maurice.\n\nLeiden University governors heard in April 1600 that [[Adriaan Metius]], a fortification advisor to Prince Maurice and the States General, had been recruited and raised to the level of a full professor to teach mathematics at the rival [[Franeker University]] The Leiden governors' main problem was to match Franeker University, without raising the status too much of Duytsche Mathematique.  So they quickly recruited mathematician [[Rudolf Snellius]] to the university—as distinct from the Engineering School—but then  relegated him to the Arts faculty.\n\nWhen the first degrees were to be conferred on Engineering School graduates in 1602 (under protest from the University) the governors and University's senate refused to award them except  via an examination conducted by the Universities' own mathematics professor, [[Rudolf Snellius]]—ensuring that Van Ceulen and Van Merwen were seen as inferior to the university's own mathematician.\n\nHowever Rudolf Snellius and his son [[Willebrord Snellius]] (the formulator of [[Snell's law]]—who replaced his father) both taught mathematics at Leiden University and appear to have cooperated closely with Van Ceulen, Van Merwen, Simon Stevin and the Engineering School.  Willebrord Snellius, in fact, worked closely with Stevin.\n\nVan Ceulen died in Leiden in 1610.\n\n== Calculating {{pi}}==\n[[Image:Ceulen - De circulo & adscriptis liber, 1619 - BEIC 175795.jpg|thumb|''De circulo & adscriptis liber'' (1619)]]\n\nLudolph van Ceulen spent a major part of his life calculating the numerical value of the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]], using essentially the same methods as those employed by [[Archimedes]] some seventeen hundred years earlier. He published a 20-decimal value in his 1596 book ''Van den Circkel'' (\"On the Circle\"), which was published before he moved to Leiden, and he later expanded this to 35 decimals. After his death, the \"[[pi|Ludolphine number]]\",\n\n:3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...,\n\nwas engraved on his [[headstone|tombstone]] in Leiden.

In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]].\n\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using [[calculus of variations]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}{{Clear}}<!--To avoid layout breaking when TOC is hidden-->\n\n==Euclid's definition==\n{{quotation|A circle is a plane figure bounded by one line, and such that all right lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal.

The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term ''segment'' is used only for regions not containing the center of the circle to which their arc belongs to.\n* [[Secant line|Secant]]: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.\n* [[Semicircle]]: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as center. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the  two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-[[Disk (mathematics)|disc]]. A half-disc is a special case of a [[Circular segment|segment]], namely the largest one.\n* [[Tangent]]: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\"touches the circle at this point\").\nAll of the specified regions may be considered as ''open'', that is, not containing their boundaries, or as ''closed'', including their respective boundaries.\n{{Clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[Image:CIRCLE LINES.svg|right|thumb|Chord, secant, tangent, radius, and diameter]]\n|[[Image:Circle slices.svg|right|thumb|Arc, sector, and segment]]\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|\nThe [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]].

Thus the length of the circumference ''C'' is related to the radius ''r'' and diameter ''d'' by:\n:<math>C = 2\\pi r = \\pi d.\\,</math>\n\n===Area enclosed===\n[[Image:Circle Area.svg|thumb|Area enclosed by a circle = {{pi}} × area of the shaded square]]\n{{Main article|Area of a circle}}\nAs proved by [[Archimedes]], in his [[Measurement of a Circle]], the [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius,<ref>{{citation|first=Victor J.|last=Katz|title=A History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=2nd|year=1998|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=978-0-321-01618-8|page=108}}</ref> which comes to {{pi}} multiplied by the radius squared:\n:<math>\\mathrm{Area} = \\pi r^2.\\,</math>\n\nEquivalently, denoting diameter by ''d'',\n:<math>\\mathrm{Area} = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\approx 0{.}7854d^2,</math>\n\nthat is, approximately 79% of the [[Circumscribe|circumscribing]] square (whose side is of length ''d'').\n\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the [[calculus of variations]], namely the [[isoperimetric inequality]].\n\n===Equations===\n\n====Cartesian coordinates====\n[[Image:Circle center a b radius r.svg|thumb|right|Circle of radius ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, centre (''a'', ''b'') =&nbsp;(1.2,&nbsp;−0.5)]]\n'''Equation of a circle'''<br>\nIn an ''x''–''y'' [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the circle with centre [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'' is the set of all points (''x'', ''y'') such that\n:<math>\\left(x - a \\right)^2 + \\left( y - b \\right)^2=r^2.</math>\n\nThis [[equation]], known as the Equation of the Circle, follows from the [[Pythagorean theorem]] applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |''x'' − ''a''| and |''y'' − ''b''|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\n'''Parametric form '''<br>\nThe equation can be written in [[parametric equation|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as\n:<math>x = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,</math>\nwhere ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]] in the range 0 to 2{{pi}}, interpreted geometrically as the [[angle]] that the ray from (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the positive ''x''-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\n:<math>x = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,</math>\n\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of ''t'' to ''r'' can be interpreted geometrically as the [[stereographic projection]] of the line passing through the centre parallel to the ''x''-axis (see [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]). However, this parameterisation works only if ''t'' is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted.\n\n'''3-point-form '''<br>\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points <math>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)</math> not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [[Ellipse#Circles|''3-point-form of a circle's equation'']]\n::<math>\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}\n             {({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\\color{red}y}-y_2)({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}=\n        \\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}\n             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.</math>\n\n'''Homogeneous form'''<br>\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]], each [[conic section]] with the equation of a circle has the form\n:<math>x^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [[complex projective plane]]) the points ''I''(1: ''i'': 0) and ''J''(1:&nbsp;−''i'':&nbsp;0). These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].\n\n====Polar coordinates====\nIn [[polar coordinates]], the equation of a circle is:\n:<math>r^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the radius of the circle, <math>(r, \\theta)</math> is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and <math>(r_0, \\phi)</math> is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., ''r''<sub>0</sub> is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and ''φ'' is the anticlockwise angle from the positive ''x''-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. ''r''<sub>0</sub> = 0, this reduces to simply {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''a''}}. When {{nowrap|''r''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n:<math>r = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,</math>\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for ''r'', giving\n:<math>r = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},</math>\nNote that without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\n====Complex plane====\nIn the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation:\n\n:<math>|z-c| = r\\,</math>.\n\nIn [[Parametric equation|parametric form]], this can be written:\n\n:<math>z = re^{it}+c</math>.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n:<math>pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q</math>\n\nfor real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with <math>p = 1,\\ g=-\\overline{c},\\ q=r^2-|c|^2</math>, since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}</math>. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].\n\n===Tangent lines===\n{{Main article|Tangent lines to circles}}\nThe [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''. If {{nowrap|P {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and the circle has centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'', then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (''a'', ''b'') to (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>), so it has the form {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub> − ''a'')''x'' + (''y''<sub>1</sub> – ''b'')''y'' {{=}} ''c''}}. Evaluating at (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) determines the value of ''c'' and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n:<math>(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> ≠ ''b''}} then the slope of this line is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.</math>\n\nThis can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n:<math>x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ </math>\nand its slope is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)\n* The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,''R''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.\n* All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n** A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.\n* The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].\n** Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].\n* Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].\n\n===Chord===\n* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n* The [[perpendicular bisector]] of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n** The [[line segment]] through the centre bisecting a chord is [[perpendicular]] to the chord.\n* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n** For a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], the [[exterior angle]] is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).\n* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n** Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\n* If the [[Intersecting chords theorem|intersection of any two chords]] divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''ab'' {{=}} ''cd''}}.\n* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104–105, #4–23.</ref>\n* The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r'' <sup>2</sup> – 4''p'' <sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n* The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.<ref>Johnson, Roger A., ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.</ref>{{rp|p.71}}\n\n===Tangent===\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n* Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n* If a tangent at ''A'' and a tangent at ''B'' intersect at the exterior point ''P'', then denoting the centre as ''O'', the angles ∠''BOA'' and ∠''BPA'' are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n* If ''AD'' is tangent to the circle at ''A'' and if ''AQ'' is a chord of the circle, then {{nowrap|∠''DAQ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}arc(''AQ'')}}.\n\n===Theorems===\n[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Secant-secant theorem]]\n{{See also|Power of a point}}\n* The chord theorem states that if two chords, ''CD'' and ''EB'', intersect at ''A'', then {{nowrap|''AC'' × ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' × ''AE''}}.\n* If two secants, ''AE'' and ''AD'', also cut the circle at ''B'' and ''C'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AC'' × ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' × ''AE''}}. (Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n* A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a [[tangent]] from an external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''F'' and a [[Secant line|secant]] from the external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''C'' and ''D'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AF''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''AC'' × ''AD''}}. (Tangent-secant theorem.)\n* The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n* If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} ''r'' {{radic|2}}}}, where ''ℓ'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.\n* If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (<math>\\overset{\\frown}{DE}</math> and <math>\\overset{\\frown}{BC}</math>). That is, <math>2\\angle{CAB}= \\angle{DOE} - \\angle{BOC}</math> where ''O'' is the centre of the circle. This is the secant-secant theorem.\n\n===Inscribed angles===\n{{See also|Inscribed angle theorem}}\n[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]\nAn [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sagitta===\n[[Image:circle Sagitta.svg|thumb|277px|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]\n* The [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]] (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n* Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n:: <math>r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.</math>\n\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is ({{nowrap|2''r'' − ''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ({{nowrap|2''r'' − ''x'')''x'' {{=}} (''y'' / 2)<sup>2</sup>}}. Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.\n\n==Compass and straightedge constructions==\n\nThere are many [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n=== Construct a circle with a given diameter ===\n* Construct the [[midpoint (geometry)|midpoint]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre {{math|'''M'''}} passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\n[[File:Circunferencia 10.svg|thumb|Construct a circle through points A, B and C by finding the perpendicular bisectors (red) of the sides of the triangle (blue).

Stanley Ogilvy|Ogilvy, C. Stanley]], ''Excursions in Geometry'', Dover, 1969, 14–17.</ref> (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment ''AB'', a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci ''A'' and ''B'' and a ratio of distances, any point ''P'' satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let ''C'' be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ''AB''. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment ''PC'' will bisect the [[interior angle]] ''APB'', since the segments are similar:\n:<math>\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, a line segment ''PD'' through some point ''D'' on ''AB'' extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] ''BPQ'' where ''Q'' is on ''AP'' extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle ''CPD'' is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points ''P'' such that angle ''CPD'' is a right angle forms a circle, of which ''CD'' is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see<ref>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).</ref>{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n===Cross-ratios===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ </math>\n\nStated another way, ''P'' is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.\n\n==={{anchor|Generalized circles}} Generalised circles===\n{{See also|Generalised circle}}\nIf ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition\n:<math>\\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>{{pad|1em}}\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n==Circles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures==\nIn every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle – from Wolfram MathWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111333/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html |date=2012-01-21 }}.

A well-studied example is the [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [[bicentric polygon]].\n\nA [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n==Circle as limiting case of other figures==\nThe circle can be viewed as a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of each of various other figures:\n* A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n* A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form <math>\\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1</math> for positive ''a'', ''b'', and ''n''. A supercircle has {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.\n* A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n* A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n==Circles in other ''p''-norms==\n[[Image:Vector-p-Norms qtl1.svg|thumb|right|Illustrations of [[unit circle]]s (see also [[superellipse]]) in different {{math|''p''}}-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding {{math|''p''}}).]]\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [[p-norm|''p''-norm]], distance is determined by\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _p = \\left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dotsb + |x_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p} .</math>\nIn Euclidean geometry, ''p'' = 2, giving the familiar\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _2 = \\sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \\dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .</math>\n\nIn [[taxicab geometry]], ''p'' = 1. Taxicab circles are [[square (geometry)|squares]] with sides oriented at a 45° angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length <math>\\sqrt{2}r</math> using a [[Euclidean metric]], where ''r'' is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2''r''. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8''r''. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to [[Pi|<math>\\pi </math>]] is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is <math>|x| + |y| = 1</math> in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and\n\n:<math>r = \\frac{1}{| \\sin \\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|}</math>\n\nin [[polar coordinates]].\n\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] of its center.\n\nA circle of radius ''r'' for the [[Chebyshev distance]] ([[Lp space|L<sub>∞</sub> metric]]) on a plane is also a square with side length 2''r'' parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>∞</sub> metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n==Squaring the circle==\n\n[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]].\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]], which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Circles}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Affine sphere]]\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)]]\n* [[Apeirogon]]\n* [[Circle fitting]]\n* [[List of circle topics]]\n* [[Sphere]]\n* [[Three points determine a circle]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n\n===Specially named circles===\n* [[Unit circle]]\n* [[Apollonian circles]]\n* [[Chromatic circle]]\n* [[Ford circle]]\n* [[Circle of antisimilitude]]\n* [[Carlyle circle]]\n* [[Bankoff circle]]\n* [[Archimedes' twin circles]]\n* [[Archimedean circle]]\n* [[Johnson circles]]\n* [[Schoch circles]]\n* [[Woo circles]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of a triangle====\n* [[Mandart circle]]\n* [[Spieker circle]]\n* [[Nine-point circle]]\n* [[Lemoine circle]]\n* [[Circumcircle]]\n* [[Incircle]]\n* [[Excircle]]\n* [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Other excircle properties|Apollonius circle of the excircles]]\n* [[Lester circle]]\n* [[Malfatti circles]]\n* [[Brocard circle]]\n* [[Orthocentroidal circle]]\n* [[Van Lamoen circle]]\n* [[Parry circle]]\n* [[Polar circle (geometry)]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of certain quadrilaterals====\n* [[Eight-point circle]] of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral\n* [[Tangential quadrilateral|Incircle of a tangential quadrilateral]]\n* [[Cyclic quadrilateral|Circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral]]\n\n====Of certain polygons====\n* [[Cyclic polygon|Circumcircle of a cyclic polygon]]\n* [[Tangential polygon|Incircle of a tangential polygon]]\n\n====Of a conic section====\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Directrix circle]]\n\n====Of a sphere====\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Riemannian circle]]\n\n====Of a torus====\n* [[Villarceau circles]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Pedoe, Dan |title=Geometry: a comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988}}\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Curves/Circle.html \"Circle\" in The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Circles|Circles}}\n{{wikiquote|Circles}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Circle}}\n* {{springer|title=Circle|id=p/c022260}}\n* [[planetmath:4236|Circle (PlanetMath.org website)]]\n* {{MathWorld |urlname=Circle |title=Circle}}\n* [http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/circlestoc.html Interactive Java applets] for the properties of and elementary constructions involving circles.\n* [http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/circle/interactive-circle-equation.php Interactive Standard Form Equation of Circle] Click and drag points to see standard form equation in action\n* [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/circle.shtml Munching on Circles] at [[cut-the-knot]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Circles| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary shapes]]\n[[Category:Curves]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Pi]]"

      "text": "[[File:Quadratrix des Dinostratos.svg|thumb|<center><math>\\frac{|AE|}{|AB|}=\\frac{2}{\\pi}</math></center>]]\nIn geometry, '''Dinostratus' theorem''' describes a property of [[Quadratrix of Hippias|Hippias' trisectrix]], that allows for the [[squaring the circle]] if the trisectrix can be used in addition to straightedge and compass. The theorem is named after the Greek mathematician [[Dinostratus]] who proved it around 350 BC when he attempted to square the circle himself.\n\nThe theorem states that Hippias' trisectrix divides one of the sides of its associated square in a ratio of <math>2:\\pi </math>.\n\nArbitrary points on Hippias' trisectrix itself however cannot be constructed by circle and compass alone but only a dense subset. In particular it is not possible to construct the exact point where the trisectrix meets the edge of the square. For this reason Dinostratus' approach is not considered a \"real\" solution of the classical problem of squaring the circle.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Thomas Little Heath]]: ''A History of Greek Mathematics.

Even his trips to the toilet were filmed to prove that the exercise was legitimate.\n\nHis previous world record of 83,431 was performed from July 1, 2005, to July 2, 2005.\n\nOn Pi Day, 2015, he claimed to be able to recite 111,701 digits.<ref name=\"theguardian\"/>\n\nDespite Haraguchi's efforts and detailed documentation, the [[Guinness World Records]] have not yet accepted any of his records set.\n\nHaraguchi views the memorization of pi as \"the religion of the universe\",<ref name=\"japantimes\"/> and as an expression of his lifelong quest for eternal truth.\n\n=== Haraguchi's mnemonic system ===\nHaraguchi uses a system he developed, which assigns [[kana]] symbols to numbers, allowing for the memorization of Pi as a collection of stories. The same system was developed by [[C.S. Lewis]] to assign letters from the alphabet to numbers, and creating stories to memorize numbers. This system preceded the system above which Haraguchi developed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n;Example<ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Bellos|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/mar/13/pi-day-2015-memory-memorisation-world-record-japanese-akira-haraguchi|title=He ate all the pi : Japanese man memorises π to 111,700 digits|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-03-13|accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"japantimes\">{{cite news|first=Tomoko|last=Otake|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2006/12/17/to-be-sorted/how-can-anyone-remember-100000-numbers/|title=How can anyone remember 100,000 numbers?|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2006-12-17|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref>\n:'''0''' => can be substituted by ''o, ra, ri, ru, re, ro, wo, on'' or ''oh'';\n:'''1''' => can be substituted by ''a, i, u, e, hi, bi, pi, an, ah, hy, hyan, bya'' or ''byan'';\n\nThe same is done for each number from 2 through 9.

He moved the indefinite postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.<ref name=purdue /></blockquote>\n\n== Mathematics ==\n\n=== Approximation of {{pi}} ===\n\nAlthough the bill has become known as the \"Pi Bill\", its text does not mention the name \"pi\" at all, and Goodwin appears to have thought of the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle as distinctly secondary to his main aim of squaring the circle. Towards the end of Section 2 the following passage appears:\n\n{{quote|Furthermore, it has revealed the ratio of the chord and arc of ninety degrees, which is as seven to eight, and also the ratio of the diagonal and one side of a square which is as ten to seven, disclosing the fourth important fact, that the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four[.]<ref name=\"bill_text\">[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/indiana_pi_bill.htm Text of the bill]</ref>}}\n\nThis comes close to an explicit claim that {{pi}} = {{sfrac|4|1.25}} = 3.2, and that {{sqrt|2}} = {{sfrac|10|7}} ≈ 1.429.\n\nThis quotation is often read as three mutually incompatible assertions, but they fit together well if the statement about {{radic|2}} is taken to be about the inscribed square (with the circle's diameter as diagonal) rather than the square on the radius (with the chord of 90° as diagonal). Together they describe the circle shown in the figure, whose diameter is 10 and circumference is 32; the chord of 90° is taken to be 7. Both of the values 7 and 32 are within a few percent of the true lengths for a diameter-10 circle (which does not justify Goodwin's presentation of them as exact). The circumference should be nearer to 31.4159 and the diagonal \"7\" should be the [[square root]] of 50 (=25+25), or nearer to 7.071.\n\n=== Area of the circle ===\n\nGoodwin's main goal was not to measure lengths in the circle but to ''square'' it, which he interpreted literally as finding a square with the same area as the circle. He knew that [[Archimedes]]' formula for the area of a circle, which calls for multiplying the diameter by one fourth of the circumference, is not considered a solution to the ancient problem of squaring the circle. This is because the problem is to ''construct'' the area using [[compass and straightedge]] only, and Archimedes did not give a method for constructing a straight line with the same length as the circumference. Apparently, Goodwin was unaware of this central requirement; he believed that the problem with the Archimedean formula is that it gives wrong numerical results, and that a solution of the ancient problem should consist of replacing it with a \"correct\" formula. In the bill he proposed, without argument, his own method:\n\n{{quote|It has been found that a circular area is to the square on a line equal to the quadrant of the circumference, as the area of an equilateral rectangle is to the square on one side.<ref name=\"bill_text\" />}}\n\nThis appears needlessly convoluted, as an \"[[equilateral]] rectangle\" is, by definition, a [[square]]. In simple terms, the assertion is that the area of a circle is the same as that of a square with the same perimeter. This claim results in other mathematical contradictions to which Goodwin attempts to respond. For example, right after the above quotation, the bill goes on to say:\n\n{{quote|The diameter employed as the linear unit according to the present rule in computing the circle's area is entirely wrong, as it represents the circle's area one and one-fifth times the area of a square whose perimeter is equal to the circumference of the circle.}}\n\nIn the model circle above, the Archimedean area (accepting Goodwin's values for the circumference and diameter) would be 80, whereas Goodwin's proposed rule leads to an area of 64. Now, 80 exceeds 64 by one fifth ''of 80'', and Goodwin appears to confuse 64 = 80&nbsp;×&nbsp;(1&nbsp;−&nbsp;{{sfrac|5}}) with 80 = 64&nbsp;×&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5}}), an approximation that works only for fractions much smaller than {{sfrac|5}}.\n\nThe area found by Goodwin's rule is {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} times the true area of the circle, which in many accounts of the Pi Bill is interpreted as a claim that {{pi}} = 4. However, there is no internal evidence in the bill that Goodwin intended to make such a claim; on the contrary, he repeatedly denies that the area of the circle has anything to do with its diameter.\n\nThe relative ''area'' error of 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} works out to about 21 percent, which is much more grave than the approximations of the ''lengths'' in the model circle of the previous section. It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see [[isoperimetry]]); the typical demonstration of this fact is to compare a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of notable cranks]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* \"Indiana's squared circle\" by Arthur E.

Then he studied three years in the Faculty of Law in [[Toulouse]].\n\nIn 1686, he went to [[Paris]] and became a mathematics tutor to the [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles|Noailles]] family. He collaborated with [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|de l'Hospital]] under the name of ''de Lagny'', and at that time he started publishing his first mathematical papers.<br>\nHe came back to [[Lyon]] when, in 11 December 1695, he was named an associate of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie Royale des Sciences]]. Then, in 1697, he became professor of [[hydrography]] at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] for 16 years.\n\nDe Lagny returned to [[Paris]] in 1714, and became a librarian at the ''Bibliothèque du roi'', and a deputy director of the ''Banque Générale'' between 1716 and 1718. On 7 July 1719, he was awarded a pension by the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie Royale des Sciences]], finally earning his living from science. In 1723, he became a pensionnaire at the Academy, replacing [[Pierre Varignon]] who died in 1722, but had to retire in 1733.\n\nDe Lagny died in 11 April 1734, and while he was dying, someone asked him:\"What's the square of 12?\" and he answered immediately:\"144!\"\n\n== Computing π ==\nIn 1719, de Lagny calculated [[pi|π]] to 120 decimal places, using [[Gregory's series]] for arctangent, but only 112 decimals were correct. This remained the record until 1789, when [[Jurij Vega]] calculated 126 digits of π.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*  ''Méthode nouvelle infiniment générale et infiniment abrégée pour l’extraction des racines quarrées, cubiques...''

Leaving school at 12, he continued to study in his free time whilst undertaking a series of jobs.  These included assistant to his father (a tailor), a clerk at a nearby iron works, a private tutor, secretary to the editor of ''Basler Zeitung'' and, at the age of 20, private tutor to the sons of Count Salis in [[Chur]].  Travelling Europe with his charges (1756–1758) allowed him to meet established mathematicians in the German states, The Netherlands, France and the Italian states. On his return to Chur he published his first books (on optics and cosmology) and began to seek an academic post. After a few short posts he was rewarded (1763) by an invitation to a position at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, where he gained the sponsorship of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Prussia]], and became a friend of [[Euler]]. In this stimulating and financially stable environment, he worked prodigiously until his death in 1777.<ref>[[W. W.

Also, he made conjectures regarding [[non-Euclidean]] space. Lambert is credited with the first proof that [[Proof that π is irrational|π is irrational]] by using a [[generalized continued fraction]] for the function tan x.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendentes circulaires et logarithmiques |trans-title=Memoir on some remarkable properties of circular transcendental and logarithmic quantities |publication-date=1768|date=1761|journal=Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles-Lettres de Berlin |volume=17|pages=265–322 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433009864251;view=1up;seq=303 |language=French }}</ref> [[Euler]] believed the conjecture but could not prove that π was irrational, and it is speculated that [[Aryabhata]] also believed this, in 500 CE.<ref>{{cite book |first= S. Balachandra |last=Rao |title = Indian Mathematics and Astronomy: Some Landmarks | publisher = Jnana Deep Publications |date = 1994 |location = Bangalore | isbn = 81-7371-205-0}}</ref> Lambert also devised theorems regarding [[conic section]]s that made the calculation of the [[orbit]]s of [[comet]]s simpler.\n\nLambert devised a formula for the relationship between the angles and the area of [[hyperbolic triangle]]s. These are triangles drawn on a concave surface, as on a [[saddle]], instead of the usual flat Euclidean surface. Lambert showed that the angles  added up to less than [[π]] ([[radian]]s), or 180°. The amount of shortfall, called the defect, increases with the area. The larger the triangle's area, the smaller the sum of the angles and hence the larger the defect C△ = π — (α + β + γ). That is, the area of a hyperbolic triangle (multiplied by a constant C) is equal to π (in radians), or 180°, minus the sum of the angles α, β, and γ. Here C denotes, in the present sense, the negative of the [[curvature]] of the surface (taking the negative is necessary as the curvature of a saddle surface is defined to be negative in the first place). As the triangle gets larger or smaller, the angles change in a way that forbids the existence of [[similar triangle|similar]] hyperbolic triangles, as only triangles that have the same angles will have the same area. Hence, instead of expressing the area of the triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides, as in Euclid's geometry, the area of Lambert's hyperbolic triangle can be expressed in terms of its angles.\n\n===Map projection===\nLambert was the first mathematician to address the general properties of [[map projection]]s (of a spherical earth).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13452701&search_terms=DTL47|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1763|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=143}}</ref> In particular he was the first to discuss the properties of conformality and equal area\npreservation and to point out that they were mutually exclusive.\n(Snyder 1993<ref name=flattening>{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. | title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =[[University of Chicago Press]]| date=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7}}.</ref>  p77).

In 1760, he published a book on photometry, the ''[[Photometria]]''. From the assumption that light travels in straight lines, he showed that illumination was proportional to the strength of the source, inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the illuminated surface and the [[Lambert's cosine law|sine of the angle]] of inclination of the light's direction to that of the surface. These results were supported by experiments involving the visual comparison of illuminations and used for the calculation of illumination. In ''Photometria'' Lambert also formulated the law of light absorption—the [[Beer–Lambert law]]) and introduced the term ''[[albedo]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mach|first=Ernst|title=The Principles of Physical Optics|publisher=Dover|date=2003|isbn=0-486-49559-0|pages=14–20}}</ref> [[Lambertian reflectance]] is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert, who introduced the concept of perfect diffusion in his 1760 book Photometria. He wrote a classic work on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and contributed to [[geometrical optics]]. The photometric unit [[lambert (luminance)|lambert]] is named in recognition of his work in establishing the study of [[photometry (optics)|photometry]]. Lambert was also a pioneer in the development of three-dimensional [[colour models]]. Late in life, he published a description of a triangular colour pyramid (''Farbenpyramide''), which shows a total of 107 colours on six different levels, variously combining red, yellow and blue pigments, and with an increasing amount of white to provide the vertical component.<ref>Lambert, ''Beschreibung einer mit dem Calauschen Wachse ausgemalten Farbenpyramide wo die Mischung jeder Farben aus Weiß und drey Grundfarben angeordnet, dargelegt und derselben Berechnung und vielfacher Gebrauch gewiesen wird'' (Berlin, 1772).

This connects with his work in the [[science]] of [[optics]]. In 1765 he began corresponding with [[Immanuel Kant]] who intended to dedicate to him the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' but the work was delayed, appearing after his death.<ref>O'Leary M., ''Revolutions of Geometry'', London:Wiley, 2010, p.385</ref>\n\n=== Astronomy ===\nLambert also developed a theory of the generation of the [[universe]] that was similar to the [[nebular hypothesis]] that [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] had (independently) developed. Wright published his account in ''An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe'' (1750), Kant in ''Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels'', published anonymously in 1755. Shortly afterward, Lambert published his own version of the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the [[solar system]] in ''Cosmologische Briefe über die Einrichtung des Weltbaues'' (1761). Lambert hypothesized that the stars near the [[sun]] were part of a group which travelled together through the [[Milky Way]], and that there were many such groupings ([[star system]]s) throughout the [[galaxy]]. The former was later confirmed by Sir [[William Herschel]]. In [[astrodynamics]] he also solved the problem of determination of time of flight along a section of orbit, known now as [[Lambert's problem]]. \nHis work in this area is commemorated by the [[Asteroid]] [[187 Lamberta]] named in his honour.\n\n===Logic===\nJohann-Heinrich Lambert is the author of a treatise on logic, which he called ''Neues Organon'' (1764), that is to say, the New Organon. The most recent edition of this work named after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'' was issued in 1990 by the Akademie-Verlag of Berlin. This contains one of the first appearances of the term ''phenomenology'',<ref>In his Preface, p. 4, of vol. I, Lambert called phenomenology \"the doctrine of appearance.\" In vol. ii, he discussed sense appearance, psychological appearance, moral appearance, probability, and perspective.</ref> and one can find therein a very pedagogical presentation of the various kinds of syllogism. In ''A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive'', [[John Stuart Mill]] expresses his admiration for Johann Heinrich Lambert.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of things named after Johann Lambert]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology |author-link=Isaac Asimov |first=Isaac |last=Asimov |publisher=Doubleday & Co., Inc., |year=1972 |ISBN=0-385-17771-2}}\n* {{cite book |first1=A. |last1=Papadopoulos |first2=G. |last2=Théret |year=2014 |title=La théorie des parallèles de Johann Heinrich Lambert: French translation, with historical and mathematical commentaries |publisher=Collection Sciences dans l'histoire, Librairie Albert Blanchard |location=Paris |ISBN=978-2-85367-266-5}}\n* {{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. dissertation |url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:21862/eth-21862-02.pdf |first=Max E. |last=Eisenring |title=Johann Heinrich Lambert und die wissenschaftliche Philosophie der Gegenwart |institution=ETH Zürich |date=Nov 1941 |language=German}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons|Johann Heinrich Lambert}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Lambert, Johann Heinrich}}\n* [http://www.kuttaka.org/~JHL/Main.html Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777): Collected Works - Sämtliche Werke Online]\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Lambert}}\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046942/Johann-Heinrich-Lambert Britannica]\n* [http://docnum.unistra.fr:8080/cdm4/results.php?CISOOP1=any&CISOBOX1=Jean+Henri+Lambert&CISOFIELD1=CISOSEARCHALL&CISOOP2=all&CISOBOX2=lambert%2C+jean-henri&CISOFIELD2=creato&CISOROOT=all&t=s Digitized works] at [[Université de Strasbourg]]\n* \"Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables...\" (1761), demonstration of irrationality of π, online and analyzed ''[https://www.bibnum.education.fr/sites/default/files/24-lambert-analysis.pdf BibNum]'' (PDF).\n\n{{Scientists whose names are used as non SI units}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lambert, Johann Heinrich}}\n[[Category:Swiss mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Swiss philosophers]]\n[[Category:1728 births]]\n[[Category:1777 deaths]]\n[[Category:Swiss astronomers]]\n[[Category:Swiss male writers]]\n[[Category:Swiss non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Alsatian-German people]]\n[[Category:People from Mulhouse]]\n[[Category:Swiss people of Walloon descent]]\n[[Category:Pi]]\n[[Category:German astronomers]]\n[[Category:German philosophers]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]\n[[Category:18th-century German mathematicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swiss mathematicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swiss scientists]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swiss writers]]"

Using [[Liu Hui's π algorithm#Later developments|Liu Hui's algorithm]] (which is based on the areas of regular polygons approximating a circle), Zu famously computed {{pi}} to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927 and gave two rational approximations of {{pi}}, {{sfrac|22|7}} and {{sfrac|355|113}}, naming them respectively Yuelü 约率 (approximate ratio) and Milü.\n\n{{sfrac|355|113}} is the best [[rational number|rational]] approximation of {{pi}} with a denominator of four digits or fewer, being accurate to 6 decimal places. It is within 0.000009% of the value of {{pi}}, or in terms of common fractions overestimates {{pi}} by less than {{sfrac|1|{{val|3748629}}}}. The next rational number (ordered by size of denominator) that is a better rational approximation of {{pi}} is {{sfrac|{{val|52163}}|{{val|16604}}}}, still only correct to 6 decimal places and hardly closer to {{pi}} than {{sfrac|355|113}}. To be accurate to 7 decimal places, one needs to go as far as {{sfrac|{{val|86953}}|{{val|27678}}}}.

A property of continued fractions is that truncating the expansion of a given number at any point will give the \"[[Continued fraction#Best rational approximations|best rational approximation]]\" to the number. To obtain Milü, truncate the continued fraction expansion of {{Pi}} immediately before the term 292; that is, {{Pi}} is approximated by the finite continued fraction <math>[3; 7, 15, 1]</math>, which is equivalent to Milü. Since 292 is an unusually large term in a continued fraction expansion, this convergent will be very close to the true value of {{Pi}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiContinuedFraction.html|title=Pi Continued Fraction|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}</ref>\n\nAn easy [[mnemonic]] helps memorize this useful fraction by writing down each of the first three [[odd numbers]] twice: 1 1 3 3 5 5, then dividing the decimal number represented by the last 3 digits by the decimal number given by the first three digits.

      "text": "{{Pi box}}\n'''Piphilology''' comprises the creation and use of [[mnemonic]] techniques to remember a span of digits of the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The word is a play on the word \"pi\" itself and of the linguistic field of [[philology]].\n\nThere are many ways to memorize {{pi}}, including the use of ''piems'' (a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]], formed by combining '''pi''' and po'''em'''), which are poems that represent {{pi}} in a way such that the length of each word (in letters) represents a digit. Here is an example of a piem: \"Now I need a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.\" Notice how the first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. In longer examples, 10-letter words are used to represent the digit [[0 (number)|zero]], and this rule is extended to handle repeated digits in so-called [[Pilish]] writing. The short story \"[[Cadaeic Cadenza]]\" records the first 3834 digits of {{pi}} in this manner, and a 10,000-word novel, ''Not A Wake'', has been written accordingly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cadaeic.net/notawake.htm|accessdate=2011-03-03|title=Not A Wake: A Dream Embodying π's Digits Fully For 10000 Decimals}}</ref>\n\nHowever, piems prove to be inefficient for large memorizations of {{pi}}. Other methods include remembering patterns in the numbers (for instance, the year 1971 appears in the first fifty digits of {{pi}}) and the [[method of loci]] (which has been used to memorize {{pi}} to 67,890 digits).<ref>Raz A, Packard MG, Alexander GM, Buhle JT, Zhu H, Yu S, Peterson BS.

This famous example for 15 digits has several variations, including:\n\n:''How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum mechanics!'' - Sir James Hopwood Jeans<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkesworth |first1=Alan S. |title=Two Mnemonics |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |date=March 1931 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=158 |doi=10.2307/2300971 |quote=The following mnemonic for π is due to Sir James Hopwood Jeans|jstor=2300971 }}</ref>\n\nShort mnemonics such as these, of course, do not take one very far down π's infinite road. Instead, they are intended more as amusing [[doggerel]]. If even less accuracy suffices, the following examples can be used:\n\n:''How I wish I could recollect pi easily today!''\n:''May I have a large container of coffee, cream and sugar?''\n\nThis second one gives the value of π as 3.1415926535, while the first only brings it to the second five. Indeed, many published poems use [[truncation]] instead of one of the several [[rounding]]s, thereby producing a less-accurate result when the first omitted digit is greater than or equal to five. It is advantageous to use truncation in memorizing if the individual intends to study more places later on, otherwise one will be remembering erroneous digits.\n\nAnother mnemonic is:\n: ''The point I said a blind Bulgarian in France would know''\nIn this mnemonic the word \"point\" represents the decimal point itself.\n\nYet another example is:\n:''How I wish I could recollect, of circle round, the exact relation Arkimedes (or Archimede) learned''\nIn this example, the spelling of Archimedes is normalised to nine. (Although 'Archimedes' is, today, a more correct spelling of the ancient Greek mathematician's name in English, Archimede is also often seen when this mnemonic is given, since Archimède is the more correct spelling in some languages, such as French.)\n\nLonger mnemonics employ the same concept. This example created by Peter M. Brigham incorporates twenty decimal digits:\n:''How I wish I could enumerate pi easily, since all these bullshit mnemonics prevent recalling any of pi's sequence more simply.''\n\n===Poems===\nSome mnemonics, such as this poem which gives the three and the first 20 decimal digits, use the separation of the poem's title and main body to represent the decimal point:\n: ''Pie''\n: ''I wish I could determine pi''\n: ''Eureka, cried the great inventor''\n: ''Christmas pudding, Christmas pie''\n: ''Is the problem's very center.''\n\nAnother, more poetic version is:\n:''Sir, I have a rhyme excelling,''\n:''In mystic power and magic spelling,''\n:''Celestial spirits elucidate,''\n:''For my own problems can't relate.''\n\nExtensions to 30 or 31 decimals of the same proceed as follows:\n{|\n|\n:''Sir, I send a rhyme excelling,''\n:''In sacred truth and rigid spelling,''\n:''Numerical sprites elucidate,''\n:''For me the lexicon's full weight,''\n:''If nature gain, who can complain,''\n:''Tho' Dr Johnson fulminate?''\n|\n::''Sir, I bear a rhyme excelling''\n::''In mystic force and magic spelling''\n::''Celestial sprites elucidate''\n::''All my own striving can't relate''\n::''Or locate they who can cogitate''\n::''And so finally terminate.  Finis.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbpimem.htm|title=Mnemonics for the Number Pi|website=camosun.bc.ca|access-date=2016-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219155554/http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbpimem.htm|archive-date=2016-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fun-with-words.com/mnem_numbers.html|title=Mnemonics > Number mnemonics|website=fun-with-words.com}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThere are minor variations on the above rhyme, which still allow pi to be worked out correctly.  However, one variation replaces the word \"lexicon's\" with \"lesson's\" and in doing so, incorrectly indicates that the 18th digit is seven.\n\nThe logologist [[Dmitri Borgmann]] gives the following 30-word poem in his book, ''[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]'':<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Dmitri Borgmann |last=Borgmann|first=Dmitri A.|title=Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities |year=1965|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|title-link=Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities}}</ref> \n:''Now, a moon, a lover refulgent in flight,''\n:''Sails the black silence's loneliest ellipse.''\n:''Computers use pi, the constant, when polite,''\n:''Or gentle data for sad tracking aid at eclipse.''\n\nThe following [[sonnet]] is a mnemonic for pi to 75 decimal places in [[iambic pentameter]]:\n:''Now I defy a tenet gallantly''\n:''Of circle canon law: these integers''\n:''Importing circles' quotients are, we see,''\n:''Unwieldy long series of cockle burs''\n\n:''Put all together, get no clarity;''\n:''Mnemonics shan't describeth so reformed''\n:''Creating, with a grammercy plainly,''\n:''A sonnet liberated yet conformed.''\n\n:''Strangely, the queer'st rules I manipulate''\n:''Being followéd, do facilitate''\n:''Whimsical musings from geometric bard.''\n\n:''This poesy, unabashed as it's distressed,''\n:''Evolvéd coherent - a simple test,''\n:''Discov'ring poetry no numerals jarred.''\n\nNote that in this example, 10-letter words are used to represent the digit [[0 (number)|zero]].\n\nOther poems use sound as a mnemonic technique, as in the following poem<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://vimeo.com/41050242\n|accessdate=2012-04-26\n|title=Sonnet 72 (Ode to Pi)\n|last1=Doerfel\n|first1=Joel\n}}</ref> which rhymes with the first 140 decimal places of pi using a blend of [[assonance]], [[slant rhyme]], and [[perfect rhyme]]:\n:''dreams number us like pi.  runes shift.  nights rewind''\n:''daytime pleasure-piles. dream-looms create our id.''\n:''moods shift. words deviate. needs brew. pleasures rise.''\n:''time slows. too late?  wait!  foreign minds live in''\n\n:''us! quick-minds, free-minds, minds-we-never-mind,''\n:''unknown, gyrate! neuro-rhymes measure our ''\n:''minds, for our minds rhyme. crude ego-emanations''\n:''distort nodes. id, (whose basic neuro-spacetime rhymes),''\n\n:''plays its tune. space drones before fate unites''\n:''dreams’ lore to unsung measures. whole dimensions''\n:''gyrate. new number-games donate quick minds &''\n:''weave through fate’s loom. fears, hopes, digits, or devils''\n\n:''collide here—labor stored in gold-mines, lives, lightcone-''\n:''piles. fate loops through dreams & pleasure-looms….''\nNote that \"dreams number us like pi\" corresponds to \"314159,\" and so on.  Sound-based mnemonic techniques, unlike pilish, do not require that the letters in each word be counted in order to recall the digits of pi.  However, where sound-based mnemonics use assonance, extra care must be taken to distinguish \"nine\" and \"five,\" which contain the same vowel sound.  In this example, the author assumes the convention that [[0 (number)|zero]] is often called \"O.\"\n\n===Piku===\n\nThe piku follows the rules of conventional haiku (three lines of 5, 7 and 5 syllables), but with the added mnemonic trick that each word contains the same number of letters as the numerals of pi, e.g.\n\n:''How I love a verse''\n:''Contrived to unhusk dryly''\n:''One image nutshell''\n\n===Songs===\nIn 2004, [[Andrew Huang (musician)|Andrew Huang]] wrote a song that was a mnemonic for the first fifty digits of pi, titled \"I am the first 50 digits of pi\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/songs/i-am-the-first-fifty-digits-of-pi/|title=SONGS TO WEAR PANTS TO \" Blog Archive \" I AM THE FIRST FIFTY DIGITS OF PI|website=songstowearpantsto.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/lyrics/|title=SONGS TO WEAR PANTS TO \" Lyrics|website=songstowearpantsto.com}}</ref> The first line is:\n:''Man, I can’t - I shan’t! - formulate an anthem where the words comprise mnemonics, dreaded mnemonics for pi.''\nIn 2013, Huang extended the song to include the first 100 digits of pi, and changed the title to \"Pi Mnemonic Song\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaDm9G4Ig18|title=PI MNEMONIC SONG|date=14 March 2013|website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Lengthier works===\nThere are piphilologists who have written texts that encode hundreds or thousands of digits. This is an example of [[constrained writing]], known as \"[[Pilish]]\".

One of these proofs, more recently developed but requiring only elementary techniques from calculus, has attracted attention in modern mathematics due to its [[mathematical elegance]] and its connections to the theory of [[diophantine approximations]]. Stephen Lucas calls this proof \"one of the more beautiful results related to approximating {{pi}}\".<ref name=\"Lucas2005\">{{Citation\n  | last = Lucas\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = Integral proofs that&nbsp;355/113&nbsp;>&nbsp;{{pi}}\n  | journal = Australian Mathematical Society Gazette\n  | volume = 32\n  | issue = 4\n  | pages = 263–266\n  | year = 2005\n  | url = http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2005/Sep05/Lucas.pdf\n  | mr = 2176249\n  | zbl = 1181.11077}}</ref>\nJulian Havil ends a discussion of [[continued fraction]] approximations of {{pi}} with the result, describing it as \"impossible to resist mentioning\" in that context.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Havil\n  | first = Julian\n  | title = Gamma.

If one knows that {{pi}} is approximately 3.14159, then it trivially follows that {{pi}}&nbsp;<&nbsp;{{sfrac|22|7}}, which is approximately 3.142857. But it takes much less work to show that {{pi}}&nbsp;<&nbsp;{{sfrac|22|7}} by the method used in this proof than to show that {{pi}} is approximately&nbsp;3.14159.\n\n==Background==\n{{sfrac|22|7}} is a widely used [[Diophantine approximation]] of {{pi}}. It is a convergent in the simple [[continued fraction]] expansion of {{pi}}. It is greater than {{pi}}, as can be readily seen in the [[decimal expansion]]s of these values:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{22}{7} & = 3. \\overline{142\\,857}, \\\\\n  \\pi\\,        & = 3.141 \\,592\\,65\\ldots\n  \\end{align}</math>\n\nThe approximation has been known since antiquity. [[Archimedes]] wrote the first known proof that {{sfrac|22|7}} is an overestimate in the 3rd century BCE, although he may not have been the first to use that approximation. His proof proceeds by showing that {{sfrac|22|7}} is greater than the ratio of the [[perimeter]] of a [[circumscribe]]d [[regular polygon]] with 96 sides to the diameter of the circle.{{refn|group=note|Proposition 3: The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is less than {{sfrac|3|1|7}} but greater than {{sfrac|3|10|71}}.<ref>{{Citation | author=Archimedes | editor-last=Heath | editor-first=T.L. | editor-link=Thomas Little Heath | origyear=1897 | date=2002 | title=The Works of Archimedes | publisher=Dover Publications | pages=93-96 | chapter=Measurement of a circle | isbn=0-486-42084-1 | url=https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp}}</ref>}}\n\n== The proof ==\nThe proof can be expressed very succinctly:\n\n:<math> 0 < \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^4\\left(1-x\\right)^4}{1+x^2} \\, dx = \\frac{22}{7} - \\pi. </math>\n\nTherefore, {{sfrac|22|7}}&nbsp;>&nbsp;{{pi}}.\n\nThe evaluation of this integral was the first problem in the 1968 [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Competition]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | editor1-last = Alexanderson\n  | editor1-first = Gerald L. | editor1-link = Gerald L.

In addition, one can easily check that the integrand is strictly positive for at least one point in the range of integration, say at {{sfrac|1|2}}. Since the integrand is continuous at that point and non-negative elsewhere, the integral from 0 to 1 must be strictly positive.\n\nIt remains to show that the integral in fact evaluates to the desired quantity:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & < \\int_0^1\\frac{x^4\\left(1-x\\right)^4}{1+x^2}\\, dx  \\\\[8pt]\n& = \\int_0^1\\frac{x^4-4x^5+6x^6-4x^7+x^8}{1+x^2}\\, dx & \\text{expansion of terms in the numerator} \\\\[8pt]\n& = \\int_0^1 \\left(x^6-4x^5+5x^4-4x^2+4-\\frac{4}{1+x^2}\\right) \\, dx & \\text{ using polynomial long division} & \\\\[8pt]\n& = \\left.\\left(\\frac{x^7}{7}-\\frac{2x^6}{3}+ x^5- \\frac{4x^3}{3}+4x-4\\arctan{x}\\right)\\,\\right|_0^1 & \\text{definite integration} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{1}{7}-\\frac{2}{3}+1-\\frac{4}{3}+4-\\pi\\quad & \\text{with }\\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ and } \\arctan(0) = 0 \\\\[8pt]\n& = \\frac{22}{7}-\\pi. & \\text{addition}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n(See [[polynomial long division]].)\n\n==Quick upper and lower bounds==\nIn {{harvtxt|Dalzell|1944}}, it is pointed out that if 1 is substituted for {{math|''x''}} in the denominator, one gets a lower bound on the integral, and if 0 is substituted for {{math|''x''}} in the denominator, one gets an upper bound:<ref>{{citation|last=Dalzell|first=D.

In the 19th century, [[Charles Hermite]] found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic [[calculus]]. Three simplifications of Hermite's proof are due to [[Mary Cartwright]], [[Ivan Niven]], and [[Nicolas Bourbaki]].

Now, take a natural number ''c'' such that all three numbers ''bc''/''k'', ''ck''/''x''<sup>2</sup> and ''c''/''x''<sup>2</sup> are integers and consider the sequence\n\n:<math>g_n=\\begin{cases}f_k(x) & n=0\\\\ \\dfrac{c^n}{k(k+1)\\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n}(x) & n \\neq 0 \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen\n\n:<math>g_0=f_k(x)=ay\\in\\Z y \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad g_1=\\frac ckf_{k+1}(x)=\\frac{bc}ky\\in\\Z y.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, it follows from claim 1 that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ng_{n+2}&=\\frac{c^{n+2}}{x^2k(k+1)\\cdots(k+n-1)}\\cdot\\frac{x^2}{(k+n)(k+n+1)}f_{k+n+2}(x)\\\\[5pt]\n& =\\frac{c^{n+2}}{x^2k(k+1)\\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n+1}(x)-\\frac{c^{n+2}}{x^2k(k+1)\\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n}(x)\\\\[5pt]\n&=\\frac{c(k+n)}{x^2}g_{n+1}-\\frac{c^2}{x^2}g_n\\\\[5pt]\n&=\\left(\\frac{ck}{x^2}+\\frac c{x^2}n\\right)g_{n+1}-\\frac{c^2}{x^2}g_n,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is a linear combination of ''g''<sub>''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sub> and ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> with integer coefficients. Therefore, each ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> is an integer multiple of ''y''. Besides, it follows from claim 2 that each ''g<sub>n</sub>'' is greater than&nbsp;0 (and therefore that ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;≥&nbsp;|''y''|) if ''n'' is large enough and that the sequence of all ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to 0. But a sequence of numbers greater than or equal to |''y''| cannot converge to 0.\n\nSince ''f''<sub>1/2</sub>({{pi}}/4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;cos({{pi}}/2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, it follows from claim 3 that {{pi}}<sup>2</sup>/16 is irrational and therefore that {{pi}} is irrational.\n\nOn the other hand, since\n\n:<math>\\tan x=\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}=x\\frac{f_{3/2}(x/2)}{f_{1/2}(x/2)},</math>\n\nanother consequence of Claim 3 is that, if ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;'''Q'''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}, then tan&nbsp;''x'' is irrational.\n\nLaczkovich's proof is really about the [[hypergeometric function]]. In fact, ''f''<sub>''k''</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sub>0</sub>''F''<sub>1</sub>(''k'';&nbsp;&minus;''x''<sup>2</sup>) and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] found a continued fraction expansion of the hypergeometric function using its [[functional equation]].<ref>{{citation | last = Gauss | first = Carl Friedrich | authorlink = Carl Friedrich Gauss | title = Disquisitiones generales circa seriem infinitam | journal = Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis recentiores | volume = 2 | year = 1811–1813 | language = latin}}</ref> This allowed Laczkovich to find a new and simpler proof of the fact that the tangent function has the continued fraction expansion that Lambert had discovered.\n\nLaczkovich's result can also be expressed in [[Bessel function#Bessel functions of the first kind : J.CE.B1|Bessel functions of the first kind ''J''<sub>''ν''</sub>(''x'')]].

Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable [[Mumbai|Bombay]] mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|80}} Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed [[elliptic integral]]s, [[Gaussian hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], and his theory of [[divergent series]], which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|80}} When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.''<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|86}}\n\nOne of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of:\n\n: <math>\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3 \\sqrt{1+\\cdots}}}.</math>\n\nHe waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.\n\n: <math>x+n+a = \\sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\sqrt{\\cdots}}}</math>\n\nUsing this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers were always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:\n\nIt will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,\n# {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,\n# the denominator of {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,\n# {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1){{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2<sup>''n''</sup> − 1)''B<sub>n</sub>''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.\n\nIn his 17-page paper, \"Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers\" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|91}} Ramanujan's writing initially had many flaws. As ''Journal'' editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:\n<blockquote>\nMr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seshu Iyer |first=P.

Ramanujan, B.A., F.R.S.|journal=Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society|volume=12 |issue=3 |page=83|ref=harv }}</ref></blockquote>\nRamanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the ''Journal''.<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> In early 1912, he got a temporary job in the Madras [[Accountant General]]'s office, with a salary of 20 rupees per month. He lasted only a few weeks.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 176.</ref> Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.\n\nIn a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:\n<blockquote>\nSir,<br>\n{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 31.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAttached to his application was a recommendation from [[E. W. Middlemast]], a mathematics professor at the [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]], who wrote that Ramanujan was \"a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics\".<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 49.</ref> Three weeks after he had applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|96}} At his office, Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given, so he spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.\n\n===Contacting British mathematicians===\nIn the spring of 1913, Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and [[E. W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had \"a taste for mathematics, and some ability,\" he lacked the educational background and foundation needed to be accepted by mathematicians.<ref>Letter from M. J. M. Hill to a C. L. T. Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.</ref> Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he did give thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nThe first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|170–171}} On 16 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]]. Coming from an unknown mathematician, the nine pages of mathematics made Hardy initially view Ramanujan's manuscripts as a possible fraud.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snow|first=C.

Bauer]] in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called [[hypergeometric series]], which had first been researched by [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. Hardy found these results \"much more intriguing\" than Gauss's work on integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} He figured that Ramanujan's theorems \"must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J. E. Littlewood]], to take a look at the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were \"certainly the most remarkable I have received\" and said that Ramanujan was \"a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power\".<ref name=\"Hardy1920\" />{{rp|494–495}} One colleague, [[Eric Harold Neville|E.

Secretary Arthur Davies of the Advisory Committee for Indian Students met with Ramanujan to discuss the overseas trip.<ref>Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 22 January 1914.</ref> In accordance with his Brahmin upbringing, Ramanujan refused to leave his country to \"go to a foreign land\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|185}} Meanwhile, he sent Hardy a letter packed with theorems, writing, \"I have found a friend in you who views my labour sympathetically.\"<ref>Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 27 February 1913, [[Cambridge University Library]].</ref>\n\nTo supplement Hardy's endorsement, [[Gilbert Walker]], a former mathematical lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging the young man to spend time at Cambridge.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|175}} As a result of Walker's endorsement, B. Hanumantha Rao, a mathematics professor at an engineering college, invited Ramanujan's colleague Narayana Iyer to a meeting of the Board of Studies in Mathematics to discuss \"what we can do for S. Ramanujan\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ram|first=Suresh |title= Srinivasa Ramanujan |year= 1972|publisher= National Book Trust |location=New Delhi|isbn= | page=29}}</ref> The board agreed to grant Ramanujan a research scholarship of 75 rupees per month for the next two years at the [[University of Madras]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|pp=30–31}}</ref> While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.'' In one instance, Narayana Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, \"The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University.\" Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, \"Does Ramanujan know Polish?\" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}</ref> In his quarterly papers, Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|183}}\n\nHardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|184}} Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; as Neville put it, \"Ramanujan needed no converting and that his parents' opposition had been withdrawn\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Apparently, Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, [[Namagiri Thayar|the deity of Namagiri]], commanded her \"to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.\n\n==Life in England==\n[[File:RamanujanCambridge.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ramanujan (centre) and his colleague [[G.

''Nevasa'' on 17 March 1914.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|196}} When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville was waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|202}} [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G. H. |title= Ramanujan|year= 1940 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge|isbn=| page=10}}</ref> Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, \"I can believe that he's at least a [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]]\",<ref>Letter, Littlewood to Hardy, early March 1913.</ref> while Hardy said he \"can compare him only with [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] or Jacobi.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G.

Hardy|year= 1979 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford, England|isbn=| page=720|volume=7|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nRamanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and published part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the [[foundations of mathematics]] had come into question and the need for [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration—a conflict that neither found easy.\n\nRamanujan was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on [[highly composite number]]s, the first part of which was published as a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]].'' The paper was more than 50 pages long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers seen in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} On 6 December 1917, he was elected to the London Mathematical Society. In 1918 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], the second Indian admitted to the Royal Society, following [[Ardaseer Cursetjee]] in 1841. At age 31 Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the history of the Royal Society. He was elected \"for his investigation in [[Elliptic function]]s and the Theory of Numbers.\" On 13 October 1918, he was the first Indian to be elected a [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Notable fellows and alumni|Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|299–300}}\n\n===Illness and death===\nThroughout his life, Ramanujan was plagued by health problems. His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion in England and wartime rationing during 1914–1918. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency at the time, and was confined to a [[sanatorium]]. In 1919 he returned to [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madras Presidency]], and soon thereafter, in 1920, died at the age of 32. After his death, his brother Tirunarayanan chronicled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions and compiled them.<ref name=\"express\"/>\n\nRamanujan's widow, [[Smt.]] Janaki Ammal, moved to [[Bombay]]; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in [[Triplicane]], where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950, she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the [[State Bank of India]] and raised a family. In her later years, she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and was also granted pensions from, among others, the [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the state governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts towards increasing his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, [[Bruce C. Berndt]] and [[Béla Bollobás]] made it a point to visit her while in India. She died at her Triplicane residence in 1994.<ref name=\"Janaki\"/><ref name=\"express\"/>\n\nA 1994 analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B.

Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. [[G.&nbsp;H. Hardy]] said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most interesting of these formulae include the intriguing infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]], one of which is given below:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt 2}{9801} \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}.</math>\n\nThis result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] {{nowrap|1={{mvar|d}} = −4 × 58 = −232}} with class number {{nowrap|1={{math|''h''(''d'')}} = 2}}. Further, {{nowrap|1=26390 = 5 × 7 × 13 × 58}} and {{nowrap|1=16 × 9801 = 396<sup>2</sup>}} and is related to the fact that\n\n:<math display=\"inline\"> e^{\\pi\\sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\\dots. </math>\n\nThis might be compared to [[Heegner number]]s, which have [[Ideal class group|class number]] 1 and yield similar formulae.\n\nRamanujan's series for {{pi}} converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation {{sfrac|9801{{sqrt|2}}|4412}} for {{pi}}, which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general [[Ramanujan–Sato series]].\n\nOne of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which [[Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] posed a problem:\n\n{{quote|Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through {{mvar|n}}. There is a house in between ({{mvar|x}}) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If {{mvar|n}} is between 50 and 500, what are {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|x}}?' This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a [[continued fraction]]. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems.  Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=82}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Statistics and truth: putting chance to work|year=1997|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqWd4oe3iwIC&pg=PA185&dq=%22Which+continued+fraction%22|author=Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao|accessdate=7 June 2010|page=185|isbn=978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref>}}\n\nHis intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left ( 1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} + \\left (1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cosh(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac {2 \\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac34 \\right )} \\pi = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{\\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac14 \\right )}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''θ''}}, where {{math|Γ(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], and related to a special value of the [[Dedekind eta function#Special values|Dedekind eta function]]. Expanding into series of powers and equating coefficients of {{math|''θ''<sup>0</sup>}}, {{math|''θ''<sup>4</sup>}}, and {{math|''θ''<sup>8</sup>}} gives some deep identities for the [[hyperbolic secant]].\n\nIn 1918 Hardy and Ramanujan studied the [[Partition function (number theory)#Partition function|partition function]] {{math|''P''(''n'')}} extensively. They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. [[Hans Rademacher]], in 1937, was able to refine their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method|circle method]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title = Partition Formula |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063949/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |archivedate = 9 February 2010 |df = dmy-all |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered [[mock theta function]]s.<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite news | url=https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | work=Fox News | title=100-Year-Old Deathbed Dreams of Mathematician Proved True | date=28 December 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107003536/https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | archivedate=7 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak [[Maass forms]].\n\n===The Ramanujan conjecture===\n{{Main|Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture}}\n\nAlthough there are numerous statements that could have borne the name ''Ramanujan conjecture,'' there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of [[André Weil]] in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[Ramanujan tau function|tau-function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 for that work.<ref name=ono/>\n\nIn his paper \"On certain arithmetical functions\", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function whose coefficients are called {{math|''τ''(''n'')}} (the [[Ramanujan tau function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ramanujan |first= Srinivasa |title= On certain arithmetical functions |journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= XXII |number= 9 |year= 1916 |url= https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |accessdate= 15 May 2016 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611175341/https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }} The tau function is discussed in pages 194–197.</ref> He proved many congruences for these numbers such as {{math|''τ''(''p'') ≡ 1 + ''p''<sup>11</sup> mod 691}} for primes {{mvar|p}}. This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of [[Galois module|Galois representations]] which \"explains\" these congruences and more generally all modular forms. {{math|Δ(''z'')}} is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Pierre Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] proceeds by first reinterpreting [[elliptic curve]]s and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Ono |first1= Ken |authorlink1= Ken Ono |last2= Aczel|first2= Amir D. |authorlink2= Amir Aczel |title= My Search for Ramanujan: How I Learned to Count |date= 13 April 2016 |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages= 236–237 |isbn= 978-3319255668 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JZkFDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=%22ideas+that+were+critical+to+the+proof+of+Fermat's+last+theorem%22#v=onepage&q=%22ideas%20that%20were%20critical%20to%20the%20proof%20of%20Fermat's%20last%20theorem%22&f=false |quote= ideas that were critical to the proof of Fermat's last theorem}}</ref>\n\n===Ramanujan's notebooks===\n{{Further|Ramanujan's lost notebook}}\n\nWhile still in Madras, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of [[loose leaf|loose-leaf]] paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce C. Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.\n\nThis may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the [[Madras Presidency]] at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of [[G. S. Carr]]'s book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\">{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0387949413 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks|last1 = Berndt|first1 = Bruce C.|date = 12 December 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second notebook has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, with the third notebook containing 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself created papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did [[G. N. Watson]], [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]], and Bruce Berndt.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\"/> A fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|\"lost notebook\"]], was rediscovered in 1976 by [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]].<ref name=\"lostnotebook\"/>\n\n==Hardy–Ramanujan number 1729==\n{{Main|1729 (number)}}\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital.

It was copied by the scribe [[Ahmes]] (''i.e.,'' Ahmose; ''Ahmes'' is an older [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] favoured by historians of mathematics), from a now-lost text from the reign of [[Pharaoh|king]] [[Amenemhat III]] ([[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]]).  Written in the [[hieratic]] script, this Egyptian [[manuscript]] is {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and consists of multiple parts which in total make it over {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.  The papyrus began to be transliterated and mathematically translated in the late 19th century.  The mathematical translation aspect remains incomplete in several respects. The document is dated to Year 33 of the [[Hyksos]] king [[Apepi I|Apophis]] and also contains a separate later historical note on its [[verso]] likely dating from the period (\"Year 11\") of his successor, [[Khamudi]].<ref>cf. {{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Schneider |chapter=The Relative Chronology of the Middle Kingdom and the Hyksos Period (Dyns. 12–17) |editor-first=Erik |editor-last=Hornung |editor2-first=Rolf |editor2-last=Krauss |editor3-first=David |editor3-last=Warburton |title=Ancient Egyptian Chronology |series=Handbook of Oriental Studies |location= |publisher=Brill |year=2006 |pages=194–195 }}</ref>\n\nIn the opening paragraphs of the papyrus, Ahmes presents the papyrus as giving \"Accurate reckoning for inquiring into things, and the knowledge of all things, mysteries...all secrets\". He continues with: \n<blockquote>This book was copied in regnal year 33, month 4 of [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], under the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Awserre, given life, from an ancient copy made in the time of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Nimaatre.

The problems start out with simple fractional expressions, followed by completion (''sekem'') problems and more involved linear equations ([[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus#Aha problems|''aha'' problems]]).<ref name=\"Spalinger\"/>\n\nThe first part of the papyrus is taken up by the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus 2/n table|2/''n'' table]]. The fractions 2/''n'' for odd ''n'' ranging from 3 to 101 are expressed as sums of [[Egyptian fraction|unit fractions]]. For example, <math>2/15 = 1/10 + 1/30 </math>. The decomposition of 2/''n'' into unit fractions is never more than 4 terms long as in for example <math>2/101 = 1/101 + 1/202 + 1/303 + 1/606</math>.\n\nThis table is followed by a much smaller, tiny table of fractional expressions for the numbers 1 through 9 divided by 10.  For instance the division of 7 by 10 is recorded as:\n: 7 divided by 10 yields 2/3 + 1/30\n\nAfter these two tables, the papyrus records 91 problems altogether, which have been designated by moderns as problems (or numbers) 1-87, including four other items which have been designated as problems 7B, 59B, 61B and 82B.  Problems 1-7, 7B and 8-40 are concerned with arithmetic and elementary algebra.\n\nProblems 1–6 compute divisions of a certain number of loaves of bread by 10 men and record the outcome in unit fractions. Problems 7–20 show how to multiply the expressions 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 7/4 and 1 + 2/3 + 1/3 = 2 by different fractions.\nProblems 21–23 are problems in completion, which in modern notation are simply subtraction problems.  Problems 24–34 are ‘’aha’’ problems; these are [[linear equations]]. Problem 32 for instance corresponds (in modern notation) to solving x + 1/3 x + 1/4 x = 2 for x. Problems 35–38 involve divisions of the heqat, which is an ancient Egyptian [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|unit]] of volume.  Beginning at this point, assorted units of measurement become much more important throughout the remainder of the papyrus, and indeed a major consideration throughout the rest of the papyrus is [[dimensional analysis]] .  Problems 39 and 40 compute the division of loaves and use [[arithmetic progressions]].<ref name=\"Clagett\" />\n\n==Book II - Geometry==\n[[File:Egyptian A'h-mosè or Rhind Papyrus (1065x1330).png|right|thumb|A portion of the Rhind Papyrus]]\nThe second part of the Rhind papyrus, being problems 41-59, 59B and 60, consists of [[geometry]] problems. Peet referred to these problems as \"mensuration problems\".<ref name=\"Spalinger\"/>\n\n===Volumes===\nProblems 41 – 46 show how to find the volume of both cylindrical and rectangular granaries. In problem 41 Ahmes computes the volume of a cylindrical granary. Given the diameter d and the height h, the volume V is given by:\n: <math> V = [(1-1/9) d]^2 h</math>\nIn modern mathematical notation (and using d = 2r) this gives <math> V = (8/9)^2 d^2 h = (256/81) r^2 h</math>. The fractional term 256/81 approximates the value of π as being 3.1605..., an error of less than one percent.\n\nProblem 47 is a table with fractional equalities which represent the ten situations where the physical volume quantity of \"100 quadruple heqats\" is divided by each of the multiples of ten, from ten through one hundred. The quotients are expressed in terms of [[Eye of Horus|Horus eye]] fractions, sometimes also using a much smaller unit of volume known as a \"quadruple ro\".  The quadruple heqat and the quadruple ro are units of volume derived from the simpler heqat and ro, such that these four units of volume satisfy the following relationships: 1 quadruple heqat = 4 heqat = 1280 ro = 320 quadruple ro.  Thus,\n\n: 100/10  quadruple heqat = 10 quadruple heqat\n: 100/20  quadruple heqat = 5 quadruple heqat\n: 100/30  quadruple heqat = (3 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64) quadruple heqat + (1 + 2/3) quadruple ro\n: 100/40  quadruple heqat = (2 + 1/2) quadruple heqat\n: 100/50  quadruple heqat = 2 quadruple heqat\n: 100/60  quadruple heqat = (1 + 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32) quadruple heqat + (3 + 1/3) quadruple ro\n: 100/70  quadruple heqat = (1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64) quadruple heqat + (2 + 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42) quadruple ro\n: 100/80  quadruple heqat = (1 + 1/4) quadruple heqat\n: 100/90  quadruple heqat = (1 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64) quadruple heqat + (1/2 + 1/18) quadruple ro\n: 100/100 quadruple heqat = 1 quadruple heqat <ref name=\"Clagett\"/>\n\n===Areas===\nProblems 48–55 show how to compute an assortment of [[area]]s. Problem 48 is notable in that it succinctly computes the [[Area of a disk|area of a circle]] by approximating [[Pi|π]]. Specifically, problem 48 explicitly reinforces the convention (used throughout the geometry section) that \"a circle's area stands to that of its circumscribing square in the ratio 64/81.\"  Equivalently, the papyrus approximates π as 256/81, as was already noted above in the explanation of problem 41.\n\nOther problems show how to find the area of rectangles, triangles and trapezoids.\n\n===Pyramids===\nThe final six problems are related to the slopes of [[pyramid]]s. \nA [[seked]] problem is reported by :<ref name=Maor-7/>\n: If a pyramid is 250 cubits high and the side of its base 360 cubits long, what is its ''seked''?\"\nThe solution to the problem is given as the ratio of half the side of the base of the pyramid to its height, or the run-to-rise ratio of its face. In other words, the quantity found for the seked is the cotangent of the angle to the base of the pyramid and its face.<ref name=Maor-7>{{Cite book|title=Trigonometric Delights|first=Eli|last=Maor|year=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-09541-8|page=20}}</ref>\n\n==Book III - Miscellany ==\nThe third part of the Rhind papyrus consists of the remainder of the 91 problems, being 61, 61B, 62-82, 82B, 83-84, and \"numbers\" 85-87, which are items that are not mathematical in nature.  This final section contains more complicated tables of data (which frequently involve Horus eye fractions), several ''pefsu'' problems which are elementary algebraic problems concerning food preparation, and even an amusing problem (79) which is suggestive of geometric progressions, geometric series, and certain later problems and riddles in history.  The third part of the Rhind papyrus is therefore a kind of miscellany, building on what has already been presented.\nProblem 61 is concerned with multiplications of fractions. Problem 61B, meanwhile, gives a general expression for computing 2/3 of 1/n, where n is odd. In modern notation the formula given is \n: <math> \\frac{2}{3n} = \\frac{1}{2n} + \\frac{1}{6n} </math>\nThe technique given in 61B is closely related to the derivation of the 2/n table.\n\nProblems 62–68 are general problems of an algebraic nature.  Problems 69–78 are all ''pefsu'' problems in some form or another. They involve computations regarding the strength of bread and beer, with respect to certain raw materials used in their production.<ref name=\"Clagett\" />\n\nProblem 79 sums five terms in a [[geometric progression]]. Its language is strongly suggestive of the more modern riddle and nursery rhyme \"[[As I was going to St Ives]]\" .<ref name=\"Spalinger\"/>\nProblems 80 and 81 compute [[Horus eye]] fractions of hinu (or heqats). The last four mathematical items, problems 82, 82B and 83-84 compute the amount of feed necessary for various animals, such as fowl and oxen.<ref name=\"Clagett\" />  However, these problems, especially 84, are plagued by pervasive ambiguity, confusion, and simple inaccuracy.\n\nThe final three items on the Rhind papyrus are designated as \"numbers\" 85-87, as opposed to \"problems\", and they are scattered widely across the papyrus' back side, or verso.  They are, respectively, a small phrase which ends the document (and has a few possibilities for translation, given below), a piece of scrap paper unrelated to the body of the document, used to hold it together (yet containing words and Egyptian fractions which are by now familiar to a reader of the document), and a small historical note which is thought to have been written some time after the completion of the body of the papyrus' writing.  This note is thought to describe events during the \"[[Hyksos]] domination\", a period of external interruption in ancient Egyptian society which is closely related with its second intermediary period.  With these non-mathematical yet historically and philologically intriguing errata, the papyrus' writing comes to an end.\n\n==Unit Concordance==\n\nSince much of the more complex material in the Rhind Papyrus is concerned with [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement]] , and especially the dimensional analysis which is used to convert between them, it can be helpful to a new reader to have a summarized account of exactly which units of measurement are used and mentioned at exactly which points in the papyrus.  This is also a sensible item to present as an aid to a person who has no knowledge of ancient Egyptian units, to more rapidly make sense of the document (or of expositions of the document).  Therefore, a concordance of the units of measurement which are used throughout the papyrus is given below.\n\n[[File:Rhind Papyrus Unit Concordance.png|thumb|center|Units of Measure used in the Rhind Papyrus.]]\n\nDetailed contextual explanations of the units as they are actually used throughout the papyrus is given in the below \"Content\" section.\n\n==Content==\n\nThis table summarizes the content of the Rhind Papyrus by means of a concise modern paraphrase.  It is based upon the two-volume exposition of the papyrus which was published by [[Arnold Buffum Chace]] in 1927, and in 1929.<ref name=\"Chace, Arnold Buffum 1929\"/>  In general, the papyrus consists of four sections: a title page, the 2/n table, a tiny \"1-9/10 table\", and 91 problems, or \"numbers\".  The latter are numbered from 1 through 87 and include four mathematical items which have been designated by moderns as problems 7B, 59B, 61B, and 82B.  Numbers 85-87, meanwhile, are not mathematical items forming part of the body of the document, but instead are respectively: a small phrase ending the document, a piece of \"scrap-paper\" used to hold the document together (having already contained unrelated writing), and a historical note which is thought to describe a time period shortly after the completion of the body of the papyrus.  These three latter items are written on disparate areas of the papyrus' [[Recto and verso|verso]] (back side), far away from the mathematical content.  Chace therefore differentiates them by styling them as ''numbers'' as opposed to ''problems'', like the other 88 numbered items.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Section or Problem Numbers !!

However, since every positive rational number has infinitely many representations as an Egyptian fraction, these solutions are not unique.  Also bear in mind that the fraction 2/3 is the single exception, used in addition to integers, that Ahmes uses alongside all (positive) rational unit fractions to express Egyptian fractions.  The 2/n table can be said to partially follow an algorithm (see problem 61B) for expressing 2/n as an Egyptian fraction of 2 terms, when n is composite.

After problem 40, there is even a large section of blank space on the papyrus, which visually indicates the end of the section.  As for problem 40 itself, Ahmes works out his solution by first considering the analogous case where the number of loaves is 60 as opposed to 100. He then states that in this case the difference is 5 1/2 and that the smallest share is equal to one, lists the others, and then scales his work back up to 100 to produce his result.  Although Ahmes does not state the solution itself as it has been given here, the quantity is implicitly clear once he has re-scaled his first step by the multiplication 5/3 x 11/2, to list the five shares (which he does).  It bears mentioning that this problem can be thought of as having four conditions: a) five shares sum to 100, b) the shares range from smallest to largest, c) consecutive shares have a constant difference and d) the sum of the three larger shares is equal to seven times the sum of the smaller two shares.  Beginning with the first three conditions only, one can use elementary algebra and then consider whether adding the fourth condition yields a consistent result.  It happens that once all four conditions are in place, the solution is unique.

However, this attempt (which failed due to confusing part of the process used in 41 and 42 with that which was probably intended to be used in 43, giving consistent results by a different method) instead resulted in a new volume formula which is inconsistent with (and worse than) the approximation used in 41 and 42.\n|-\n| 44, 45 || One cubic cubit is equal to 15/2 quadruple heqats.

Happily the context of 51 and 52, together with the base, mid-line, and smaller triangle area (which ''are'' given as 4 + 1/2, 2 + 1/4 and 7 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8, respectively) make it possible to interpret the problem and its solution as has been done here.  The given paraphrase therefore represents a consistent best guess as to the problem's intent, which follows Chace.  Ahmes also refers to the \"cubit strips\" again in the course of calculating for this problem, and we therefore repeat their usage here.  It bears mentioning that neither Ahmes nor Chace explicitly give the area for the middle trapezoid in their treatments (Chace suggests that this is a triviality from Ahmes' point of view); liberty has therefore been taken to report it in a manner which is consistent with what Chace had thus far advanced.\n|-\n| 54 || There are 10 plots of land.

One ''royal'' cubit, or one cubit, is equal to seven palms, and one palm is equal to four fingers.  In other words, the following equalities hold: 1 (royal) cubit = 1 cubit = 7 palms = 28 fingers.\n\n2) Consider a [[Pyramid (geometry)|right regular square]] [[pyramid]] whose base, the square face is coplanar with a plane (or the ground, say), so that any of the planes containing its triangular faces has the [[dihedral angle]] of <math> \\theta </math> with respect to the ground-plane (that is, on the interior of the pyramid).  In other words, <math> \\theta </math> is the angle of the triangular faces of the pyramid with respect to the ground.  The [[seked]] of such a pyramid, then, having altitude <math> a </math> and base edge length <math> b </math> , is defined as ''that physical length'' <math> S </math> such that <math> \\frac{S}{1 \\;\\;\\; royal \\;\\;\\;cubit} = </math> [[cotangent|<math> \\cot{ \\theta } </math>]] .  Put another way, the seked of a pyramid can be interpreted as the ratio of its triangular faces' ''run per one unit (cubit) rise'' .  Or, for the appropriate right triangle on a pyramid's interior having legs <math> a, \\frac{b}{2} </math> and the perpendicular bisector of a triangular face as the hypotenuse, then the pyramid's seked <math> S </math> satisfies <math> \\cot{ \\theta } = \\frac{b}{2a} = \\frac{S}{1 \\;\\;\\; royal \\;\\;\\;cubit} </math> .

In this connection, the concept of a [[seked]] suggests early beginnings of [[trigonometry]] .  Unlike modern trigonometry however, note especially that a seked is found with respect to some pyramid, and is itself a ''physical length measurement'', which may be given in terms of any physical length units.  For obvious reasons however, we (and the papyrus) confine our attention to situations involving ancient Egygtian units.  We have also clarified that royal cubits are used throughout the papyrus, to differentiate them from \"short\" cubits which were used elsewhere in ancient Egypt.  One \"short\" cubit is equal to six palms.\n|-\n| 57, 58 || The seked of a pyramid is 5 palms and 1 finger, and the side of its base is 140 cubits.

However, the overall context of the problem, together with its accompanying diagram (which differs from the previous diagrams), leads Chace to conclude that a cone is meant.  The notion of seked is easily generalized to the lateral face of a cone; he therefore reports the problem in these terms.  Problem 60 concludes the geometry section of the papyrus.  Moreover, it is the last problem on the [[Recto and verso|recto]] (front side) of the document; all later content in this summary is present on the [[Recto and verso|verso]] (back side) of the papyrus.

That is, the pefsu is not immediately concerned with matters like production time, or (in any one given case) the relationship of other raw materials or equipment to the production process, etc.  Still, the notion of the pefsu is another hint of abstraction in the papyrus, capable of being applied to ''any'' binary relationship between a food product (or finished good, for that matter) and a raw material.

In general however, they assume a ''common raw material'' of some kind.  Specifically, the common raw material assumed throughout all of 72-78 is called ''wedyet flour'' , which is even implicated in the production of beer, so that beer can be exchanged for bread in the latter problems.  74's original statement also mentions \"Upper Egyptian barley\", but for our purposes this is cosmetic.  What problems 72-78 say, then, is really this: equal amounts of raw material are used in two different production processes, to produce two different units of finished food, where each type has a different pefsu.  One of the two finished food units is given.  Find the other.  This can be accomplished by dividing both units (known and unknown) by their respective pefsu, where the units of finished food vanish in dimensional analysis, and only the same raw material is considered.  One can then easily solve for x.  72-78 therefore really require that x be given so that equal amounts of raw material are used in two different production processes.\n|-\n| 73 || 100 bread loaves of pefsu 10 are to be evenly exchanged for <math> x </math> loaves of pefsu 15.

He also indicates that a suspiciously familiar third instance of these types of problems is to be found in Fibonacci's [[Liber Abaci]] .  Chace suggests the interpretation that 79 is a kind of savings example, where a certain amount of grain is saved by keeping cats on hand to kill the mice which would otherwise eat the spelt used to make the grain.  In the original document, the 2401 term is written as 2301 (an obvious mistake), while the other terms are given correctly; it is therefore corrected here.\n\nMoreover, one of Ahmes' methods of solution for the sum suggests an understanding of finite [[geometric series]] .  Ahmes performs a direct sum, but he also presents a simple multiplication to get the same answer: \"2801 x 7 = 19607\".  Chace explains that since the first term, the number of houses (7) is ''equal'' to the common ratio of multiplication (7), then the following holds (and can be generalized to any similar situation):\n\n<math> \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{n} 7^{k} = 7 \\bigg( 1 + \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{n-1} 7^{k} \\bigg) </math>\n\nThat is, when the first term of a geometric sequence is equal to the common ratio, partial sums of geometric sequences, or finite geometric series, can be reduced to multiplications involving the finite series having one less term, which does prove convenient in this case.  In this instance then, Ahmes simply adds the first four terms of the sequence (7 + 49 + 343 + 2401 = 2800) to produce a partial sum, adds one (2801), and then simply multiplies by 7 to produce the correct answer.\n\n|-\n| 80 || The hinu is a further unit of volume such that one heqat equals ten hinu.

The first part of problem 81 is an exact repetition of the table in problem 80, without the first row which states that 1 heqat = 10 hinu - it is therefore not repeated here.  The second part of problem 81, or its \"body\" is the large table which is given here.  The attentive reader will notice two things: several rows repeat identical information, and several forms (but not all) given in both of the \"heqat\" areas on either side of the table are in fact identical.  There are two points worth mentioning, to explain why the table looks the way that it does.  For one thing, Ahmes does in fact exactly repeat certain groups of information in different areas of the table, and they are accordingly repeated here.  On the other hand, Ahmes also starts out with certain \"left-hand\" heqat forms, and makes some mistakes in his early calculations.  However, in many cases he corrects these mistakes later in his writing of the table, producing a consistent result.  Since the present information is simply a re-creation of Chace's translation and interpretation of the papyrus, and since Chace elected to interpret and correct Ahmes' mistakes by substituting the later correct information in certain earlier rows, thereby fixing Ahmes' mistakes and also therefore repeating information in the course of translation, this method of interpretation explains the duplication of information in certain rows.  As for the duplication of information in certain columns (1/4 heqat = ... = 1/4 heqat, etc.), this seems simply to have been a convention that Ahmes filled in while considering certain important Horus-eye fractional ratios from both the standpoint of the hinu, and also of the heqat (and their conversions).  In short, the various repetitions of information are the result of choices made by Ahmes, his potential source document, and the editorial choices of Chace, in order to present a mathematically consistent translation of the larger table in problem 81.\n|-\n| 82 || Estimate in wedyet-flour, made into bread, the daily portion of feed for ten [[Foie gras|fattening]] geese.  To do this, perform the following calculations, expressing the quantities in Egyptian fractional terms of ''hundreds'' of heqats, heqats and ro, except where specified otherwise:\n\nBegin with the statement that \"10 fattening geese eat 2 + 1/2 heqats in one day\".  In other words, the daily rate of consumption (and initial condition) <math> i </math> is equal to 2 + 1/2.  Determine the number of heqats which 10 fattening geese eat in 10 days, and in 40 days.

However, it is yet possible to make some sense of 82.  Simply put, there seem to exist established rules, or good estimates, for fractions to be taken of this-or-that food material in a cooking or production process.  Ahmes' 82 simply gives expression to some of these quantities, in what is after all declared in the original document to be an \"estimate\", its somewhat contradictory and confused language notwithstanding.  In addition to their strangeness, problems 82, 82B, 83 and 84 are also notable for continuing the \"food\" train of thought of the recent pefsu problems, this time considering how to feed animals instead of people.  Both 82 and 82B make use of the \"hundred heqat\" unit with regard to t and f; these conventions are cosmetic, and not repeated here.  Licence is also taken throughout these last problems (per Chace) to fix numerical mistakes of the original document, to attempt to present a coherent paraphrase.\n|-\n| 82B || Estimate the amount of feed for other geese.  That is, consider a situation which is identical to problem 82, with the single exception that the initial condition, or daily rate of consumption, is exactly half as large.  That is, let <math> i </math> = 1 + 1/4.

In both cases, it appears that Ahmes' real goal is to find g_2 .  Now that he has a \"procedure\", he feels free to skip 82's onerous steps.  One could simply observe that the division by two carries through the entire problems' work, so that g_2 is also exactly half as large as in problem 82.  A slightly more thorough approach using elementary algebra would be to backtrack the relationships between the quantities in 82, make the essential observation that g = 14/15 x f, and then perform the unit conversions to transform g into g_2 .\n|-\n| 83 || Estimate the feed for various kinds of birds.  This is a \"problem\" with multiple components, which can be interpreted as a series of remarks:\n\nSuppose that four geese are cooped up, and their collective daily allowance of feed is equal to one hinu.

The portion shared by the goose, terp-goose and crane is equal to 5/3 hinu, the set-ducks' portion is equal to 1/2 hinu, the ser-gooses' portion is equal to 1/4 hinu (compare the first item in the problem), and the portion shared by the dove and quail is equal to 1/16 + 1/32 hinu.  The presence of various Horus eye fractions is familiar from the rest of the papyrus, and the table seems to consider feed estimates for birds, ranging from largest to smallest.  The \"5/3 hinu\" portions at the top of the table, specifically its factor of 5/3, reminds one of the method for finding s in problem 82.  Problem 83 makes mention of \"Lower-Egyptian grain\", or barley, and it also uses the \"hundred-heqat\" unit in one place; these are cosmetic, and left out of the present statement.\n|-\n| 84 || Estimate the feed for a stable of oxen. ||\n\n<math> \\begin{bmatrix}\n\n                  & Loaves                                        & Common \\; food                               \\\\\n4 \\; fine \\; oxen & 24 \\; heqat                                   & 2 \\; heqat                                   \\\\\n2 \\; fine \\; oxen & 22 \\; heqat                                   & 6 \\; heqat                                   \\\\\n3 \\; cattle       & 20 \\; heqat                                   & 2 \\; heqat                                   \\\\\n1 \\; ox           & 20 \\; heqat                                   &                                              \\\\\nTotal             & 86 \\; heqat                                   & 10 \\; heqat                                  \\\\\nin \\; spelt       & 9  \\; heqat                                   & ( 7 + \\frac{1}{2} ) \\; heqat                 \\\\\n10 \\; days        & ( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} ) \\; c. \\; heqat  & ( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} ) \\; c. \\; heqat \\\\\n                  & + 15 \\; heqat                                 &                                              \\\\\none \\; month      & 200 \\; heqat                                  & ( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} ) \\; c. \\; heqat \\\\\n                  &                                               & + 15 \\; heqat                                \\\\\ndouble \\; heqat   & \\frac{1}{2} \\; c. \\; heqat                    & \\frac{1}{4} \\; c. \\; heqat                   \\\\\n                  & + ( 11 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} ) \\; heqat & + 5 \\; heqat                                 \\\\\n                  & + 3 \\; ro                                     &                                              \\\\\n\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\n|| 84 is the last problem, or number, comprising the mathematical content of the Rhind papyrus.  With regard to 84 itself, Chace echoes Peet: \"One can only agree with Peet that 'with this problem the papyrus reaches its limit of unintelligibility and inaccuracy.' \" - (Chace, V.2, Problem 84).  Here, instances of the \"hundred heqat\" unit have been expressed by \"c. heqat\" in order to conserve space.  The three \"cattle\" mentioned are described as \"common\" cattle, to differentiate them from the other animals, and the two headers concerning loaves and \"common food\" are with respect to heqats.  The \"fine oxen\" at the table's beginning are described as Upper Egyptian oxen, a phrase also removed here for space reasons.\n\nProblem 84 seems to suggest a procedure to estimate various food materials and allowances in similar terms as the previous three problems, but the extant information is deeply confused.  Still, there are hints of consistency.  The problem seems to start out like a conventional story problem, describing a stable with ten animals of four different types.  It seems that the four types of animals consume feed, or \"loaves\" at different rates, and that there are corresponding amounts of \"common\" food.  These two columns of information are correctly summed in the \"total\" row, however they are followed by two \"spelt\" items of dubious relationship to the above.  These two spelt items are indeed each multiplied by ten to give the two entries in the \"10 days\" row, once unit conversions are accounted for.  The \"one month\" row items do not seem to be consistent with the previous two, however.  Finally, information in \"double heqats\" (read hundred double heqats, double heqats and double ro for these items) concludes the problem, in a manner reminiscent of 82 and 82B.  The two items in the final row are in roughly, but not exactly, the same proportion to one another as the two items in the \"one month\" row.\n\n|-\n| '''Number 85''' || '''A small group of cursive hieroglyphic signs is written, which Chace suggests may represent the scribe \"trying his pen\".

Number 85, for example, is some distance away from problem 84 on the verso - but not too far away.

      "text": "{{Hinduism}}\n\nThe '''''Shulba Sutras''''' or '''''Śulbasūtras''''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|śulba}}'': \"string, cord, rope\") are [[sutra]] texts belonging to  the [[Śrauta]] ritual and containing  geometry related to [[vedi (altar)|fire-altar]] construction.\n\n== Purpose and origins ==\nThe Shulba Sutras are part of the larger corpus of texts called the [[Shrauta Sutra]]s, considered to be appendices to the [[Vedas]]. They are the only sources of knowledge of [[Indian mathematics]] from the [[Vedic period]]. Unique fire-altar shapes were associated with unique gifts from the Gods. For instance, \"he who desires heaven is to construct a fire-altar in the form of a falcon\"; \"a fire-altar in the form of a tortoise is to be constructed by one desiring to win the world of Brahman\" and \"those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, p. 387, \"Certain shapes and sizes of fire-altars were associated with particular gifts that the sacrificer desired from the gods: 'he who desires heaven is to construct a fire-altar in the form of a falcon'; 'a fire-altar in the form of a tortoise is to be constructed by one desiring to win the world of Brahman'; 'those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus' [Sen and Bag 1983, 86, 98, 111].\"</ref>\n\nThe four major Shulba Sutras, which are mathematically the most significant, are those attributed to  [[Baudhayana]], [[Manava]], [[Apastamba]] and [[Katyayana (mathematician)|Katyayana]].<ref name=Plofker387>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, p. 387</ref> Their language is late [[Vedic Sanskrit]], pointing to a composition roughly during the 1st millennium [[BCE]].<ref name=Plofker387/> The oldest is the sutra attributed to Baudhayana, possibly compiled around 800 BCE to 500 BCE.<ref name=Plofker387/>  Pingree says that the Apastamba is likely the next oldest; he places the Katyayana and the Manava third and fourth chronologically, on the basis of apparent borrowings.<ref name=Pingree4>{{harvtxt|Pingree|1981}}, p. 4</ref>  According to Plofker, the Katyayana was composed after \"the great grammatical codification of Sanskrit by [[Pāṇini]] in probably the mid-fourth century BCE\", but she places the Manava in the same period as the Baudhayana.<ref name=Plofker18>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2009}}, p.18</ref>\n\nWith regard to the composition of Vedic texts, Plofker writes,<blockquote>The Vedic veneration of Sanskrit as a sacred speech, whose divinely revealed texts were meant to be recited, heard, and memorized rather than transmitted in writing, helped shape Sanskrit literature in general. … Thus texts were composed in formats that could be easily memorized: either condensed prose aphorisms (''sūtras,'' a word later applied to mean a rule or algorithm in general) or verse, particularly in the Classical period.  Naturally, ease of memorization sometimes interfered with ease of comprehension.  As a result, most treatises were supplemented by one or more prose commentaries …\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2009}}, p. 11</ref></blockquote>  There are multiple commentaries for each of the Shulba Sutras, but these were written long after the original works.  The commentary of Sundararāja on the Apastamba, for example, comes from the late 15th century CE<ref>{{harvtxt|Pingree|1981}}, p. 6</ref> and the commentary of Dvārakãnātha on the Baudhayana appears to borrow from Sundararāja.<ref>{{harvtxt|Delire|2009}}, p. 50</ref>  According to Staal, certain aspects of the tradition described in the Shulba Sutras would have been \"transmitted orally\", and he points to places in southern India where the fire-altar ritual is still practiced and an oral tradition preserved.<ref>{{harvtxt|Staal|1999}}, p. 111</ref>  The fire-altar tradition largely died out in India, however, and Plofker warns that those pockets where the practice remains may reflect a later Vedic revival rather than an unbroken tradition.<ref name=Plofker18/>  Archaeological evidence of the altar constructions described in the Shulba Sutras is sparse.  A large falcon-shaped fire altar (''śyenaciti''), dating to the second century BCE, was found in the excavations by [[G. R. Sharma]] at [[Kausambi]], but this altar does not conform to the dimensions prescribed by the Shulba Sutras.<ref name=Pingree4/><ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2009}}, p 19.</ref>\n\nThe content of the Shulba Sutras is likely older than the works themselves.  The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' and the ''[[Taittiriya Samhita]]'', whose contents date to the late second millennium or early first millennium BCE, describe altars whose dimensions appear to be based on the right triangle with legs of 15 ''pada'' and 36 ''pada'', one of the triangles listed in the Baudhayana Shulba Sutra.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bürk|1901}}, p. 554</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Heath|1925}}, p. 362</ref>\n\nThe origin of the mathematics in the Shulba Sutras is not known.  It is possible, as proposed by Gupta, that the geometry was developed to meet the needs of ritual.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|1997}}, p. 154</ref>  Some scholars go farther: Staal hypothesizes a common ritual origin for Indian and Greek geometry, citing similar interest and approach to doubling and other geometric transformation problems.  (Cf. the ancient Greek problem of [[doubling the cube]], linked by [[Plutarch]] with the task of doubling the altar of Apollo, a task that was given by an oracle to the citizens of Delos as a condition for averting a certain misfortune, possibly a plague.)<ref>{{harvtxt|Staal|1999}}, pp. 106, 109&ndash;110</ref>  Seidenberg, followed by van der Waerden, sees a ritual origin for mathematics more broadly, postulating that the major advances, such as discovery of the Pythagorean theorem, occurred in only one place, and diffused from there to the rest of the world.<ref>{{harvtxt|Seidenberg|1978}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|van der Waerden|1983}}</ref>  While Boyer mentions [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian]] mathematics (c. 2000 BCE&ndash;1600 BCE) as a possible origin,<ref>{{harvtxt|Boyer|1991}}, p. 207, \"We find rules for the construction of right angles by means of triples of cords the lengths of which form Pythagorean triages, such as 3, 4, and 5, or 5, 12, and 13, or 8, 15, and 17, or 12, 35, and 37. However all of these triads are easily derived from the old Babylonian rule; hence, Mesopotamian influence in the ''Sulvasutras'' is not unlikely. Aspastamba knew that the square on the diagonal of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the two adjacent sides, but this form of the Pythagorean theorem also may have been derived from Mesopotamia. ... So conjectural are the origin and period of the ''Sulbasutras'' that we cannot tell whether or not the rules are related to early Egyptian surveying or to the later Greek problem of altar doubling. They are variously dated within an interval of almost a thousand years stretching from the eighth century B.C. to the second century of our era.\"</ref> Seidenberg argues that either \"Old Babylonia got the theorem of Pythagoras from India or that Old Babylonia and India got it from a third source\".  Seidenberg suggests that this source might be [[Sumer]]ian and may predate 1700 BC.<ref>{{harvtxt|Seidenberg|1983}}, p. 121</ref>  In contrast, Pingree cautions that \"it would be a mistake to see in [the altar builders'] works the unique origin of geometry; others in India and elsewhere, whether in response to practical or theoretical problems, may well have advanced as far without their solutions having been committed to memory or eventually transcribed in manuscripts.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Pingree|1981}}, p. 5</ref>  Plofker also raises the possibility that \"existing geometric knowledge [was] consciously incorporated into ritual practice\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2009}}, p. 17</ref>\n\n== List of Shulba Sutras ==\n# [[Apastamba]]\n# [[Baudhayana]]\n# [[Manava]]\n# [[Katyayana]]\n# [[Maitrayaniya]] (somewhat similar to Manava text)\n# [[Varaha]] (in manuscript)\n# [[Vadhula]] (in manuscript)\n# [[Hiranyakeshin]] (similar to Apastamba Shulba Sutras)\n\n== Mathematics ==\n\n=== Pythagorean theorem and Pythagorean triples===\nThe sutras contain statements of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], both in the case of an [[isosceles]] [[right triangle]] and in the general case, as well as lists of [[Pythagorean triples]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Thibaut|1875}}, pp. 232&ndash;238</ref>\nIn Baudhayana, for example, the rules are given as follows:\n<blockquote>1.9. The diagonal of a square produces double the area [of the square].<BR>[...]<BR> 1.12. The areas [of the squares] produced separately by the lengths of the breadth of a rectangle together equal the area [of the square] produced by the diagonal.<BR>1.13. This is observed in rectangles having sides 3 and 4, 12 and 5, 15 and 8, 7 and 24, 12 and 35, 15 and 36.<ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, pp. 388–389</ref></blockquote>\nSimilarly, Apastamba's rules for constructing right angles in fire-altars use the following Pythagorean triples:<ref>{{harvtxt|Boyer|1991}}, p. 207</ref><ref name=joseph>{{Cite book\n|last=Joseph |first=G.G.  |date=2000  |title=The Crest of the Peacock: The Non-European Roots of Mathematics\n|publisher= Princeton University Press |ISBN=0-691-00659-8  |page=229}}</ref>\n \n* <math>(3, 4, 5)</math>\n* <math>(5, 12, 13)</math>\n* <math>(8, 15, 17)</math>\n* <math>(12, 35, 37)</math>\n\nIn addition, the sutras describe procedures for constructing a square with area equal either to the sum or to the difference of two given squares.  Both constructions proceed by letting the largest of the squares be the square on the diagonal of a rectangle, and letting the two smaller squares be the squares on the sides of that rectangle.  The assertion that each procedure produces a square of the desired area is equivalent to the statement of the Pythagorean theorem.  Another construction produces a square with area equal to that of a given rectangle.  The procedure is to cut a rectangular piece from the end of the rectangle and to paste it to the side so as to form a [[gnomon]] of area equal to the original rectangle.  Since a gnomon is the difference of two squares, the problem can be completed using one of the previous constructions.<ref>{{harvtxt|Thibaut|1875}}, pp. 243&ndash;246</ref>\n\n=== Geometry ===\n{{Pi box}}\nThe ''Baudhayana Shulba sutra'' gives the construction of geometric shapes such as squares and rectangles.<ref name=Plofker388-391>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, pp. 388-391</ref> It also gives, sometimes approximate, geometric area-preserving transformations from one geometric shape to another. These include transforming a [[Square (geometry)|square]] into a [[rectangle]], an [[isosceles]] [[trapezoid|trapezium]], an isosceles [[triangle]], a [[rhombus]], and a [[circle]], and transforming a circle into a square.<ref name=Plofker388-391/>\nIn these texts approximations, such as the transformation of a circle into a square, appear side by side with more accurate statements. As an example, the statement of circling the square is given in Baudhayana  as:\n<blockquote>2.9. If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, [a cord of length] half the diagonal [of the square] is stretched from the centre to the east [a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square]; with one-third [of the part lying outside] added to the remainder [of the half diagonal], the [required] circle is drawn.<ref name=Plofker391>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, p. 391</ref></blockquote>\nand the statement of squaring the circle is given as:\n<blockquote>2.10. To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into eight parts; one [such] part after being divided into twenty-nine parts is reduced by twenty-eight of them and further by the sixth [of the part left] less the eighth [of the sixth part].<BR>2.11. Alternatively, divide [the diameter] into fifteen parts and reduce it by two of them; this gives the approximate side of the square [desired].<ref name=Plofker391/></blockquote>\n\nThe constructions in 2.9 and 2.10 give a value of π as 3.088, while the construction in 2.11 gives π as 3.004.<ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, p. 392, \"The 'circulature' and quadrature techniques in 2.9 and 2.10, the first of which is illustrated in figure 4.4, imply what we would call a value of π of 3.088, [...] The quadrature in 2.11, on the other hand, suggests that π = 3.004 (where <math>s = 2r\\cdot13/15</math>), which is already considered only 'approximate.' In 2.12, the ratio of a square's diagonal to its side (our <math>\\sqrt{2})</math> is considered to be 1 + 1/3 + 1/(3·4) - 1/(3·4·34) = 1.4142.</ref>\n\n=== Square roots ===\nAltar construction also led to an estimation of the [[square root of 2]] as found in three of the sutras. In the Baudhayana sutra it appears as:\n<blockquote>2.12. The measure is to be increased by its third and this [third] again by its own fourth less the thirty-fourth part [of that fourth]; this is [the value of] the diagonal of a square [whose side is the measure].<ref name=Plofker391/></blockquote>\nwhich leads to the value of the square root of two as being:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot4 \\cdot 34} = \\frac{577}{408} = 1.4142...</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Plofker|2007}}, p. 392</ref><ref name=Cooke200>{{harvtxt|Cooke|2005}}, p. 200</ref>\n\nOne conjecture about how such an approximation was obtained is that it was taken by the formula:\n:<math> \\sqrt{a^2+r} \\approx a + \\frac{r}{2a} - \\frac{(r/2a)^2}{2(a+\\frac{r}{2a})}, </math> with <math>a = 4/3</math> and <math>r = 2/9</math>, which is an approximation that follows a rule given by the twelfth century Muslim mathematician [[Al-Hassar]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Cooke|2005}}, p. 200, \"The Hindus had a very good system of approximating irrational square roots. Three of the ''Sulva Sutras'' contain the approximation <math>1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot4 \\cdot 34}</math> for the diagonal of a square of side 1 (that is <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>). [...] We can only conjecture how such an approximation was obtained. One guess is the approximation <math>\\sqrt{a^2+r} = a + \\frac{r}{2a} - \\frac{(r/2a)^2}{2(a+\\frac{r}{2a})}</math> with <math>a = 4/3</math> and <math>r = 2/9</math>. This approximation follows a rule given by the twelfth century Muslim mathematician Al-Hassar.</ref>  The result is correct to 5 decimal places.\n\nThis formula is similar in structure to the formula found on a Mesopotamian tablet<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neugebauer|first1=O.|last2=Sachs|first2=A.|year=1945|title=Mathematical Cuneiform Texts|place=New Haven, Connecticut|publisher=Yale University Press|page=45}}</ref> from the Old Babylonian period (1900-1600 [[BCE]]):<ref name=Cooke200/>\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{24}{60} + \\frac{51}{60^2} + \\frac{10}{60^3} \\approx 1.41421297,</math>\nwhich expresses <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> in the [[sexagesimal]] system, and is accurate to 5 decimal places after rounding.\n\nIndeed, an early method for calculating square roots can be found in some Sutras, the method involves the [[recursion|recursive]] formula: <math>\\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{x-1} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot \\sqrt{x-1}}</math> for large values of x, which bases itself on the non-recursive identity <math>\\sqrt{a ^2+ r} \\approx a + \\frac{r}{2 \\cdot a}</math> for values of ''r'' extremely small relative to ''a''.\n\nIt has also been suggested, for example by Bürk<ref>{{harvtxt|Bürk|1901}}, p. 575</ref> that this approximation of &radic;2 implies knowledge that &radic;2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. In his translation of Euclid's ''Elements'', Heath outlines a number of milestones necessary for irrationality to be considered to have been discovered, and points out the lack of evidence that Indian mathematics had achieved those milestones in the era of the Shulba Sutras.<ref>{{harvtxt|Heath|1925}}, p. 364: \"As [Heinrich] Vogt says, three stages had to be passed through before the irrationality of the diagonal of a square was discovered in any real sense.  (1) All values found by direct measurement of calculations based thereon have to be recognized as being inaccurate.  Next (2) must supervene the conviction that it is ''impossible'' to arrive at an accurate arithmetical expression of the value.  And lastly (3) the impossibility must be proved.  Now there is no real evidence that the Indians, at the date in question, had even reached the first stage, still less the second or third.\"</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Kalpa (Vedanga)]]\n\n== Citations and footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book\n | first=Carl B.\n | last=Boyer\n | authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer\n | title=A History of Mathematics\n | edition=Second\n | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n | year=1991\n | isbn=0-471-54397-7\n }}\n*{{cite journal\n | first=Albert\n | last=Bürk\n | title=Das Āpastamba-Śulba-Sūtra, herausgegeben, übersetzt und mit einer Einleitung versehen\n | journal=Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft\n | url=http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/63295\n | volume=55\n | year=1901\n | pages=543&ndash;591\n | language=de\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | first=Jean Michele\n | last=Delire\n | editor-first=Dominik\n | editor-last=Wujastyk\n | title=Mathematics and Medicine in Sanskrit\n | contribution=Chronological inferences from a comparison between commentaries on different ''Śulbasūtras''\n | year=2009\n | pages=37&ndash;62\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | first=Edwin\n | last=Bryant\n | author-link=Edwin Bryant (author)\n | title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate\n | year=2001\n | publisher=Oxford University Press\n | ISBN=9780195137774\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last1=Cooke\n | first1=Roger\n | authorlink=Roger Cooke\n | year=2005\n | orig-year=First published 1997\n | title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course\n | publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]\n | isbn=0-471-44459-6\n }}\n*{{cite book\n | first=Bibhutibhushan\n | last=Datta\n | authorlink=Bibhutibhushan Datta\n | title=The Science of the Sulba.

It was named after [[Theodorus of Cyrene]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe spiral is started with an [[isosceles]] right triangle, with each [[Cathetus|leg]] having unit [[length]]. Another right triangle is formed, an [[automedian triangle|automedian right triangle]] with one leg being the [[hypotenuse]] of the prior triangle (with length [[square root of 2|{{radic|2}}]]) and the other leg having length of 1; the length of the hypotenuse of this second triangle is [[square root of 3|{{radic|3}}]]. The process then repeats; the ''n''th triangle in the sequence is a right triangle with side lengths {{radic|''n''}} and 1, and with hypotenuse {{sqrt|''n'' + 1}}.

It is the challenge of constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] with the same area as a given [[circle]] by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]]. It may be taken to ask whether specified [[axiom]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]] concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]] which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the [[zero of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients. It had been known for some decades before then that the construction would be impossible if {{pi}} were transcendental, but {{pi}} was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to {{pi}}.\n\nThe expression \"squaring the circle\" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ammer|first=Christine|title=Square the Circle.

The Egyptian [[Rhind papyrus]] of 1800&nbsp;BC gives the area of a circle as {{sfrac|64|81}}&nbsp;{{math|''d''}}<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>, where {{math|''d''}} is the diameter of the circle. In modern terms, this is equivalent to approximating {{pi}} as {{sfrac|256|81}} (approximately 3.1605), a number that appears in the older [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] and is used for volume approximations (i.e. [[hekat (volume unit)|hekat]]). [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] also found an approximate method, though less accurate, documented in the ''[[Shulba Sutras]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|author1=O'Connor, John J.  |author2=Robertson, Edmund F.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_sulbasutras.html|title=The Indian Sulbasutras|work=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St Andrews University}}</ref> [[Archimedes]] proved the formula for the area of a circle ({{math|1=''A'' = {{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>}}, where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the circle) and showed that the value of {{pi}} lay between {{sfrac|3|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and {{sfrac|3|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408). See [[Numerical approximations of π|Numerical approximations of {{pi}}]] for more on the history.\n\nThe first known Greek to be associated with the problem was [[Anaxagoras]], who worked on it while in prison. [[Hippocrates of Chios]] squared certain [[Lune (mathematics)|lunes]], in the hope that it would lead to a solution — see [[Lune of Hippocrates]]. [[Antiphon the Sophist]] believed that inscribing regular polygons within a circle and doubling the number of sides will eventually fill up the area of the circle, and since a polygon can be squared, it means the circle can be squared. Even then there were skeptics—[[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]] argued that magnitudes cannot be divided up without limit, so the area of the circle will never be used up.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Heath | first = Thomas | year = 1981 | title = History of Greek Mathematics | publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 0-486-24074-6}}</ref> The problem was even mentioned in [[Aristophanes]]'s play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]''.\n\nIt is believed that [[Oenopides]] was the first Greek who required a plane solution (that is, using only a compass and straightedge). [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] attempted a proof of its impossibility in ''Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura'' (The True Squaring of the Circle and of the Hyperbola) in 1667.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gregory |first1=James |title=Vera Circuli et Hyperbolæ Quadratura … |trans-title=The true squaring of the circle and of the hyperbola … |date=1667 |publisher=Giacomo Cadorino |location=Padua }}  Available at:  [https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/wihibe/content/titleinfo/1254563 ETH Bibliothek (Zürich, Switzerland)]</ref> Although his proof was faulty, it was the first paper to attempt to solve the problem using algebraic properties of {{pi}}.

In one of his diary entries for 1855, Dodgson listed books he hoped to write including one called \"Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers\". In the introduction to \"A New Theory of Parallels\", Dodgson recounted an attempt to demonstrate logical errors to a couple of circle-squarers, stating:<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Martin Gardner\n|title=The Universe in a Handkerchief\n|isbn=0-387-94673-X\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=1996\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The first of these two misguided visionaries filled me with a great ambition to do a feat I have never heard of as accomplished by man, namely to convince a circle squarer of his error! The value my friend selected for Pi was 3.2: the enormous error tempted me with the idea that it could be easily demonstrated to BE an error. More than a score of letters were interchanged before I became sadly convinced that I had no chance.\n</blockquote>\n\nA ridiculing of circle-squaring appears in [[Augustus de Morgan]]'s [[A Budget of Paradoxes]] published posthumously by his widow in 1872. Having originally published the work as a series of articles in the ''Athenæum'', he was revising it for publication at the time of his death. Circle squaring was very popular in the nineteenth century, but hardly anyone indulges in it today and it is believed that de Morgan's work helped bring this about.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Underwood|last=Dudley|title=A Budget of Trisections|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-96568-8|pages=xi–xii|ref=harv}} Reprinted as ''The Trisectors''.</ref>\n\n==Impossibility==\nThe solution of the problem of squaring the circle by compass and straightedge requires the construction of the number {{sqrt|{{pi}}}}. If {{sqrt|{{pi}}}} is [[constructible number|constructible]], it follows from [[Straightedge and compass|standard constructions]] that {{pi}} would also be constructible. In 1837, [[Pierre Wantzel]] showed that lengths that could be constructed with compass and straightedge had to be solutions of certain polynomial equations with rational coefficients.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wantzel |first1=L. |title=Recherches sur les moyens de reconnaître si un problème de géométrie peut se résoudre avec la règle et le compas |journal=Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées |date=1837 |volume=2 |pages=366–372 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433110146044;view=1up;seq=380 |trans-title=Investigations into means of knowing if a problem of geometry can be solved with a straightedge and compass |language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Cajori, Florian|title=Pierre Laurent Wantzel|journal=Bull.

If the problem of the quadrature of the circle could be solved using only compass and straightedge, then {{pi}} would have to be an algebraic number.

If a rational number is used as an approximation of {{pi}}, then squaring the circle becomes possible, depending on the values chosen. However, this is only an approximation and does not meet the constraints of the ancient rules for solving the problem. Several mathematicians have demonstrated workable procedures based on a variety of approximations.\n\nBending the rules by allowing an infinite number of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] also makes squaring the circle possible in some sense. For example, although the circle cannot be squared in [[Euclidean space]], it sometimes can be in [[hyperbolic geometry]] under suitable interpretations of the terms.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF03024895   | last = Jagy  | first = William C. | title = Squaring circles in the hyperbolic plane | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer  | volume = 17  | issue = 2  | pages = 31–36  | year = 1995   | url = http://zakuski.math.utsa.edu/~jagy/papers/Intelligencer_1995.pdf   | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]   | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Greenberg\n  | first = Marvin Jay\n  |authorlink= Marvin Greenberg\n  | title =  Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries\n  | publisher = W H Freeman\n  | year = 2008\n  | pages = 520–528\n  | edition = Fourth\n  | isbn =  0-7167-9948-0\n  | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>  As there are no squares in the hyperbolic plane, their role needs to be taken by ''regular quadrilaterals'', meaning quadrilaterals with all sides congruent and all angles congruent (but these angles are strictly smaller than right angles).\nThere exist, in the hyperbolic plane, (countably) infinitely many pairs of constructible circles and constructible regular quadrilaterals of equal area, which, however, are constructed simultaneously.\nThere is no method for starting with a regular quadrilateral and constructing the circle of equal area, and there is no method for starting with a circle and constructing a regular quadrilateral of equal area (even when the circle has small enough radius such that a regular quadrilateral of equal area exists).\n\n==Modern approximative constructions==\nThough squaring the circle is an impossible problem using only compass and straightedge, approximations to squaring the circle can be given by constructing lengths close to&nbsp;{{pi}}.\nIt takes only minimal knowledge of elementary geometry to convert any given rational approximation of {{pi}} into a corresponding [[compass-and-straightedge construction]], but constructions made in this way tend to be very long-winded in comparison to the accuracy they achieve. After the exact problem was proven unsolvable, some mathematicians applied their ingenuity to finding elegant approximations to squaring the circle, defined roughly and informally as constructions that are particularly simple among other imaginable constructions that give similar precision.\n\nAmong the modern approximate constructions was one by [[E.

Since the techniques of calculus were unknown, it was generally presumed that a squaring should be done via geometric constructions, that is, by compass and straightedge.  For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] wrote to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] in 1676 \"I believe M. Leibnitz will not dislike the Theorem towards the beginning of my letter pag. 4 for '''squaring Curve lines''' Geometrically\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OVPJ6c9_kKgC&pg=PA259&vq=squaring&dq=newton+squaring-curves+date:0-1923|title=Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Cotes: Including letters of other eminent men|author1=Cotes|first1=Roger|year=1850}}</ref>  After Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented calculus, they still referred to this integration problem as squaring a curve.\n\n==Claims of circle squaring==\n\n===Connection with the longitude problem===\nThe mathematical proof that the [[numerical integration|quadrature]] of the circle is impossible using only compass and straightedge has not proved to be a hindrance to the many people who have invested years in this problem anyway.  Having squared the circle is a famous [[crank (person)|crank]] assertion. (''See also'' [[pseudomathematics]].) In his old age, the English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] convinced himself that he had succeeded in squaring the circle.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th century, the notion that the problem of squaring the circle was somehow related to the [[History of longitude#Problem of longitude|longitude problem]] seems to have become prevalent among would-be circle squarers. Using \"cyclometer\" for circle-squarer, [[Augustus de Morgan]] wrote in 1872:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Jean Etienne Montucla|Montucla]] says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions prevalent among cyclometers: 1. That there is a large reward offered for success; 2. That the longitude problem depends on that success; 3. That the solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three notions are equally prevalent among the same class in England. No reward has ever been offered by the government of either country.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Augustus de Morgan]] |year=1872|title=[[A Budget of Paradoxes]]|page= 96}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough from 1714 to 1828 the British government did indeed sponsor a £20,000 prize for finding a solution to the longitude problem, exactly why the connection was made to squaring the circle is not clear; especially since two non-geometric methods (the astronomical [[Lunar distance (navigation)|method of lunar distances]] and the mechanical [[marine chronometer|chronometer]]) had been found by the late 1760s. De Morgan goes on to say that \"[t]he longitude problem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond what can be wanted.\" In his book, de Morgan also mentions receiving many threatening letters from would-be circle squarers, accusing him of trying to \"cheat them out of their prize\".\n\n===Other modern claims===\nEven after it had been proved impossible, in 1894, amateur mathematician Edwin J. Goodwin claimed that he had developed a method to square the circle. The technique he developed did not accurately square the circle, and provided an incorrect area of the circle which essentially redefined pi as equal to 3.2. Goodwin then proposed the [[Indiana Pi Bill]] in the Indiana state legislature allowing the state to use his method in education without paying royalties to him. The bill passed with no objections in the state house, but the bill was tabled and never voted on in the Senate, amid increasing ridicule from the press.<ref>{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=How Pi was nearly changed to 3.2 - Numberphile|date=2013-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFNjA9LOPsg|accessdate=2017-10-26}}</ref>\n\nThe mathematical crank [[Carl Theodore Heisel]] also claimed to have squared the circle in his book, \"Behold! : the grand problem no longer unsolved: the circle squared beyond refutation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heisel |first1=Carl Theodore |title=Behold! : the grand problem the circle squared beyond refutation no longer unsolved |date=1934 |publisher=Heisel |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Behold_the_grand_problem_the_circle_squa.html?id=Uqe3swEACAAJ |accessdate=16 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref> [[Paul Halmos]] referred to the book as a \"classic crank book.\" <ref>{{cite web |last1=Halmos |first1=Paul |title=How to Write Mathematics |url=https://www.math.uh.edu/~tomforde/Books/Halmos-How-To-Write.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1874, [[John A.

The problems cover [[logic]], [[algebra]], [[metaphysics]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[geodesy]], [[stereometry]], [[geometry]] of [[curve]]s, [[ballistics]], and general and special [[physics]].\n\n==Military service==\nVega left Ljubljana five years after graduation and entered military service in 1780 as a professor of mathematics at the Artillery School in Vienna. At that time he started to sign his last name as ''Vega'' and no longer ''Veha''. When Vega was 33 he married Josefa Svoboda (Jožefa Swoboda) (1771&ndash;1800), a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] noble from [[České Budějovice]] who was 16 at that time.\n\nVega participated in several wars. In 1788 he served under Austrian Imperial Field-Marshal [[Ernst Gideon von Laudon]] (1717&ndash;1790) in a campaign against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] at [[Belgrade]]. His command of several [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] batteries contributed considerably to the fall of the Belgrade fortress. Between 1793 and 1797 he fought [[French Revolution]]aries under the command of Austrian General [[Dagobert Wurmser|Dagobert-Sigismond de Wurmser]] (1724–1797) with the European coalition on the Austrian side. He fought at [[Fort-Louis|Fort Louis]], [[Mannheim]], [[Mainz]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Kehl]], and [[Dietz]]. In 1795 he had two 30-pound (14&nbsp;kilogram) mortars cast, with conically drilled bases and a greater charge, for a firing range up to 3000&nbsp;metres (3300&nbsp;yards). The old 60&nbsp;lb (27&nbsp;kg) mortars had a range of only 1800&nbsp;m (2000&nbsp;yd).\n\nIn September 1802 Vega was reported missing. After a few days' search his body was found. The police report concluded that his death was an accident. It is believed that he died on 26 September 1802 in [[Nußdorf, Vienna|Nußdorf]] on the [[Danube]], near the [[Austria]]n capital, [[Vienna]].\n\n==Mathematical accomplishments==\n[[File:Houghton Math 837.97 - Logarithmisch-trigonometrische, tabula.jpg|thumb|right|\"Tabula logarithmorum vulgarium\", 1797]]\nVega published a series of books of [[logarithm]] tables. The first one appeared in 1783. Much later, in 1797 it was followed by a second volume that contained a collection of integrals and other useful formulae. His ''Handbook'', which was originally published in 1793, was later translated into several languages and appeared in over 100 issues. His major work was ''[[Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus]]'' (''Treasury of all Logarithms'') that was first published 1794 in [[Leipzig]] (its 90th edition was published in 1924). This [[mathematical table]] was actually based on [[Adriaan Vlacq]]'s tables, but corrected a number of errors and extended the logarithms of trigonometric functions for the small angles. An engineer, Franc Allmer, honourable senator of the [[Graz University of Technology]], has found Vega's logarithmic tables with 10 [[decimal]] places in the Museum of Carl Friedrich Gauss in [[Göttingen]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] used this work frequently and he has written in it several calculations. Gauss has also found some of Vega's errors in the calculations in the range of numbers, of which there are more than a million. A copy of Vega's Thesaurus belonging to the private collection of the British mathematician and computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] (1791–1871) is preserved at the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh]].\n\nOver the years Vega wrote a four volume textbook ''Vorlesungen über die Mathematik'' (''Lectures about Mathematics''). ''Volume I'' appeared in 1782 when he was 28&nbsp;years old, ''Volume II'' in 1784, ''Volume III'' in 1788 and ''Volume IV'' in 1800. His textbooks also contain interesting tables: for instance, in ''Volume II'' one can find [[Exact trigonometric constants|closed form expressions for sines of multiples of 3 degrees]], written in a form easy to work with.\n\nVega wrote at least six scientific papers. On August 20, 1789 Vega achieved a world record when he calculated [[pi]] to 140 places, of which the first 126 were correct.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204040635/http://www.southernct.edu/~sandifer/Ed/History/Preprints/Talks/Jurij%20Vega/Vega%20math%20script.pdf] This calculation he proposed to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in the booklet ''V. razprava (The fifth discussion)'', where he had found with his calculating method an error on the 113th place from the estimation of [[Thomas Fantet de Lagny]] (1660&ndash;1734) from 1719 of 127 places. Vega retained his record 52&nbsp;years until 1841 and his method is mentioned still today. His article was not published by the Academy until six years later, in 1795. Vega had improved [[John Machin]]'s formula from 1706:\n\n:<math> {\\pi\\over 4} = 4 \\arctan \\left({1\\over 5}\\right) - \\arctan \\left({1\\over 239}\\right)</math>\n\nwith his formula, which is equal to [[Leonhard Euler|Euler's]] formula from 1755:\n\n:<math> {\\pi\\over 4} = 5 \\arctan \\left({1\\over 7}\\right) + 2 \\arctan \\left({3\\over 79}\\right) \\; ,</math>\n\nand which converges faster than Machin's formula. He had checked his result with the similar [[Hutton's formula]]:\n\n:<math> {\\pi\\over 4} = 2 \\arctan \\left({1\\over 3}\\right) + \\arctan \\left({1\\over 7}\\right) \\; .</math>\n\nHe had developed the second term in the series only once.\n\nAlthough he worked in the subjects of [[ballistics]], [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], his major contributions are to the mathematics of the second half of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1781 Vega tried to push further his idea in the Austrian [[Habsburg|Habsburg monarchy]] about the usage of the decimal [[metric system]] of units. His idea was not accepted, but it was introduced later under the emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Josef I]] in 1871.\n\nVega was a member of the [[University of Applied Sciences Mainz|Academy of Practical Sciences in Mainz]], the Physical and Mathematical Society of [[Erfurt]], the Bohemian Scientific Society in [[Prague]], and the Prussian Academy of Sciences in [[Berlin]]. He was also an associate member of the British Scientific Society in [[Göttingen]]. He was awarded the Order of [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] on May 11, 1796. In 1800 Vega obtained a title of hereditary baron including the right to his own coat of arms.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Jurij Vega High School]] (''Gimnazija Jurija Vege'') in [[Idrija]] was founded in 1901 as the first Slovene ''[[Realschule]]''. In 1935, [[Vega (crater)]] on the Moon was named after Vega. The National Bank of Slovenia issued a 50 [[Slovenian tolar|tolar]] banknote in his honour in 1993, and the [[Post of Slovenia|Slovene Post Office]] issued a stamp honouring Vega in 1994. The [[asteroid]] [[14966 Jurijvega]], discovered on July 30, 1997, is named after him. [[Slovenia]]'s [[Ljubljana Vega Astronomical Society Vega]] is named after both Jurij Vega and the star [[Vega]]. The star, however, is ''not'' named after Jurij Vega and its name is much older. A free open-source physics library for 3D deformable object simulation, Vega FEM, has also been named after Vega.\n\n==Scientific genealogy==\nVega is also notable as the tutor and academic advisor of {{Interlanguage link multi|Ignaz Lindner|sl|3=Ignaz Lindner|lt=Ignaz Lindner}},<ref name=SZ/> resulting in a notable [[scientific genealogy]] (see [[Academic genealogy of theoretical physicists#Jurij Vega|Academic genealogy of theoretical physicists: Jurij Vega]]).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Jurij Vega}}\n* [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jbourj/money2.htm Jurij Vega on the Slovenian 50 Tolars banknote.]\n* [[University of St Andrews]]' page on Vega: http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Vega.html\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040405042918/http://www.ijp.si/JurijVega/conference.html Vega and his time]\n* [http://www.jernejbarbic.com/vega Vega FEM library]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vega, Jurij}}\n[[Category:1754 births]]\n[[Category:1802 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century Carniolan people]]\n[[Category:18th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century physicists]]\n[[Category:18th-century astronomers]]\n[[Category:Carniolan mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Carniolan physicists]]\n[[Category:Carniolan astronomers]]\n[[Category:Ballistics experts]]\n[[Category:Pi]]\n[[Category:Barons of Austria]]\n[[Category:Slovene nobility]]\n[[Category:Carniolan nobility]]\n[[Category:People from the Municipality of Dol pri Ljubljani]]"
