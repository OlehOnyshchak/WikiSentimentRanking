It is a [[perfect totient number]], the smallest such number to be neither a power of three nor thrice a prime.\n\nSince 255 is the product of the first three [[Fermat prime]]s, the regular 255-gon is [[constructible polygon|constructible]].\n\nIn base 10, it is a [[self number]].\n\n255 is a [[repdigit]] in base 2 (11111111), in base 4 (3333), and in base 16 (FF).\n\n==In computing==\n255 is a special number in some tasks having to do with computing. This is the maximum value representable by an eight-digit [[Binary numeral system|binary]] number, and therefore the maximum representable by an unsigned [[8 (number)|8]]-bit [[byte]] (the most common size of byte, also called an [[octet (computing)|octet]]), the smallest common [[Variable (programming)|variable]] size used in high level [[programming language]]s ([[bit]] being smaller, but rarely used for value storage). The range is [[0 (number)|0]] to 255, which is [[256 (number)|256]] total values.\n\n:<math>255 = 2^8-1 = \\mbox{FF}_{16} = 11111111_2</math>\n\nFor example, 255 is the maximum value\n* that can be assigned to elements in the [[RGB#24-bit representation|24-bit RGB]] [[color]] model, since each color channel is allotted eight bits.\n* of any dotted quad in an [[IP address|IPv4 address]].\n* of the [[Alpha compositing#Alpha blending|alpha blending]] scale in [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]] (255 being 100% visible and 0 being fully transparent)\n\nThe use of eight bits for storage in older video games has had the consequence of it appearing as a hard limit in many video games. For example, in the original ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' game, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] can carry a maximum of 255 rupees.<ref>Hoovler, Evan.  \"[http://www.gamespy.com/articles/105/1051691p1.html The History of Annoying Side-Quests in Videogames] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071831/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/105/1051691p1.html |date=2011-07-11 }}.\"  ''[[GameSpy]]''.  2009-12-04.</ref>  It was often used for numbers where casual gameplay would not cause anyone to exceed the number.

As a perfect number, it is tied to the [[Mersenne prime]] [[thirty-one|31]], 2<sup>5</sup> &minus; 1, with 2<sup>4</sup> (2<sup>5</sup> &minus; 1) yielding 496. Also related to its being a perfect number, 496 is a [[harmonic divisor number]], since the number of proper divisors of 496 divided by the sum of the reciprocals of its divisors, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248 and 496, (the [[harmonic mean]]), yields an integer, 5 in this case.\n\nA [[triangular number]] and a [[hexagonal number]], 496 is also a [[centered nonagonal number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A060544|title=Centered 9-gonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref> Being the 31st triangular number, 496 is the smallest counterexample to the hypothesis that one more than an even triangular number is a [[prime number]].

In 1984, [[Michael Green (physicist)|Michael Green]] and [[John H. Schwarz]] realized that one of the necessary conditions for a superstring theory to make sense is that the [[dimension]] of the [[gauge group]] of [[type I string theory]] must be 496. The group is therefore [[SO(32)]]. Their discovery started the [[first superstring revolution]].

A [[prime reciprocal magic square]] based on 1/149 in base 10 has a magic total of 666.\n\nThe prime factorization of 666 is 2 • 3<sup>2</sup> • 37. Also, 666 is the sum of squares of first seven primes: <math>2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 + 13^2 + 17^2</math>\n\nThe [[Roman numeral]] for 666, DCLXVI, has exactly one occurrence of all symbols whose value is less than 1000 in decreasing order (D = 500, C = 100, L = 50, X = 10, V = 5, I = 1).\n\n== In religion ==\n\n=== Number of the Beast ===\n[[Image:DVinfernoLuciferKingOfHell m.jpg|thumb|right|222px|666 is often associated with the [[devil]].]]\n{{Main|Number of the Beast}}\nIn the [[Textus Receptus]] manuscripts of the [[New Testament]], the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|13:17–18|}}) cryptically asserts 666 to be \"man's number\" or \"the number of a man\" (depending on how the text is translated) associated with [[The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast]], an antagonistic creature that appears briefly about two-thirds into the apocalyptic vision.

The number 666 is purportedly used to invoke [[Satan]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Earnest references to the number occur both among [[apocalypticism|apocalypticist]] [[Christianity|Christian]] groups and in explicitly anti-Christian subcultures.\nReferences in contemporary Western art or literature are, more likely than not, intentional references to ''the Beast'' symbolism. Such popular references are therefore too numerous to list.\n\nIt is common to see the symbolic role of the ''integer'' 666 transferred to the ''digit sequence'' 6-6-6. Some people take the Satanic associations of 666 so seriously that they actively avoid things related to 666 or the digits 6-6-6. This is known as [[hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia]].\n\nThe Number of the Beast is cited as [[616 (number)#The Number of the Beast|616]] in some early biblical manuscripts, the earliest known instance being in [[Papyrus 115]].<ref>''Novum Testamentum Graece'', Nestle and Aland, 1991, footnote to verse 13:18 of Revelation, page 659: \"{{lang|grc|-σιοι δέκα ἕξ}}\" as found in ''C'' [''C''=[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]]; for English see Metzger's ''Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'', note on verse 13:18 of Revelation, page 750: \"the numeral 616 was also read ...\"</ref><ref>[http://archive.is/http://web.archive.org/web/20000301070625/www.csad.ox.ac.uk/POxy/beast616.htm The Other Number of the Beast]</ref>\n\n=== Other occurrences ===\n* In the [[Bible]], 666 is the number of [[wiktionary:talent#Noun|talents]] of gold [[Solomon]] collected each year (see {{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:14}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|9:13}}).\n* In the Bible, 666 is the number of [[Adonikam]]'s descendants who return to [[Jerusalem]] and [[Judea|Judah]] from the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian]] exile (see {{bibleverse||Ezra|2:13}}).\n* Using gematria, [[Number of the beast#Neron Caesar|Neron Caesar]] transliterated from Greek into Hebrew produces the number 666.
