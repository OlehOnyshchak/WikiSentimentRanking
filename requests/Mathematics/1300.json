      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''composition ring''', introduced in {{harv|Adler|1962}}, is a [[commutative ring]] (''R'', 0,  +, &minus;, ·), possibly without an identity 1 (see [[non-unital ring]]), together with an operation\n\n: <math>\\circ: R \\times R \\rightarrow R</math>\n\nsuch that, for any three elements <math>f,g,h\\in R</math> one has\n\n# <math>(f+g)\\circ h=(f\\circ h)+(g\\circ h)</math>\n# <math>(f\\cdot g)\\circ h = (f\\circ h)\\cdot (g\\circ h)</math>\n# <math>(f\\circ g)\\circ h = f\\circ  (g\\circ h).</math>\n\nIt is ''not'' generally the case that <math>f\\circ g=g\\circ f</math>, ''nor'' is it generally the case that <math>f\\circ (g+h)</math> (or <math>f\\circ (g\\cdot h)</math>) has any algebraic relationship to <math>f\\circ g</math> and <math>f\\circ h</math>.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThere are a few ways to make a commutative ring ''R'' into a composition ring without introducing anything new.\n*Composition may be defined by <math>f\\circ g=0</math> for all ''f'',''g''. The resulting composition ring is a rather uninteresting.\n*Composition may be defined by <math>f\\circ g=f</math> for all ''f'',''g''. This is the composition rule for constant functions.\n*If ''R'' is a [[boolean ring]], then multiplication may double as composition: <math>f\\circ g=fg</math> for all ''f'',''g''.\nMore interesting examples can be formed by defining a composition on another ring constructed from ''R''.\n*The polynomial ring ''R''[''X''] is a composition ring where <math>(f\\circ g) (x)=f(g(x))</math> for all <math>f, g \\in R</math>.\n*The formal power series ring ''R''{{brackets|''X''}} also has a substitution operation, but it is only defined if the series ''g'' being substituted has zero constant term (if not, the constant term of the result would be given by an infinite series with arbitrary coefficients). Therefore, the subset of ''R''{{brackets|''X''}} formed by power series with zero constant coefficient can be made into a composition ring with composition given by the same substitution rule as for polynomials. Since nonzero constant series are absent, this composition ring does not have a multiplicative unit.\n*If ''R'' is an integral domain, the field ''R''(''X'') of rational functions also has a substitution operation derived from that of polynomials: substituting a fraction ''g''<sub>1</sub>/''g''<sub>2</sub> for ''X'' into a polynomial of degree ''n'' gives a rational function with denominator <math>g_2^n</math>, and substituting into a fraction is given by\n::<math>\\frac{f_1}{f_2}\\circ g=\\frac{f_1\\circ g}{f_2\\circ g}.</math>\n:However, as for formal power series, the composition cannot always be defined when the right operand ''g'' is a constant: in the formula given the denominator <math>f_2\\circ g</math> should not be identically zero. One must therefore restrict to a subring of ''R''(''X'') to have a well-defined composition operation; a suitable subring is given by the rational functions of which the numerator has zero constant term, but the denominator has nonzero constant term. Again this composition ring has no multiplicative unit; if ''R'' is a field, it is in fact a subring of the formal power series example.\n*The set of all functions from ''R'' to ''R'' under pointwise addition and multiplication, and with <math>\\circ</math> given by composition of functions, is a composition ring. There are numerous variations of this idea, such as the ring of continuous, smooth, holomorphic, or polynomial functions from a ring to itself, when these concepts makes sense.\n\nFor a concrete example take the ring <math>{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math>, considered as the ring of polynomial maps from the integers to itself.  A ring endomorphism\n: <math>F:{\\mathbb Z}[x]\\rightarrow{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math>\nof <math>{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math> is determined by the image under <math> F</math> of the variable <math>x</math>, which we denote by\n: <math>f=F(x)</math>\nand this image <math>f</math> can be any element of <math>{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math>.    Therefore, one may consider the elements <math>f\\in{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math> as endomorphisms and assign <math>\\circ:{\\mathbb Z}[x]\\times{\\mathbb Z}[x]\\rightarrow{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math>, accordingly.  One easily verifies that <math>{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math> satisfies the above axioms.  <!-- Is <math>{\\mathbb Z}[x]</math>  the free composition ring on one generator?--> For example, one has\n: <math>(x^2+3x+5)\\circ(x-2)=(x-2)^2+3(x-2)+5=x^2-x+3.</math>\nThis example is isomorphic to the given example for ''R''[''X''] with ''R'' equal to <math>\\mathbb Z</math>, and also to the subring of all functions <math>\\mathbb Z\\to\\mathbb Z</math> formed by the polynomial functions.\n\n== See also==\n* [[Composition operator]]\n* [[Polynomial decomposition]]\n* [[Carleman matrix]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | authorlink=Irving Adler | last1=Adler | first1=Irving | title=Composition rings | mr=0142573 | year=1962 | journal=[[Duke Mathematical Journal]] | issn=0012-7094 | volume=29 | pages=607–623 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1077470398 | doi=10.1215/S0012-7094-62-02961-7 | issue=4}}\n\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]\n[[Category:Ring theory]]"

      "title": "Damm algorithm",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damm_algorithm",
      "text": "In [[error detection]], the '''Damm algorithm''' is a [[check digit]] [[algorithm]] that detects all [[Transcription error|single-digit errors]] and all [[Transcription error#Transposition error|adjacent transposition errors]]. It was presented by H. Michael Damm in 2004.<ref name=\"fenwick2014\" />\n\n== Strengths and weaknesses ==\n===Strengths===\nThe Damm algorithm is similar to the [[Verhoeff algorithm]]. It too will detect ''all'' occurrences of the two most frequently appearing types of [[transcription error]]s, namely altering one single digit, and transposing two adjacent digits (including the transposition of the trailing check digit and the preceding digit).<ref name=\"fenwick2014\" /><ref name=\"Salomon2005\" /> But the Damm algorithm has the benefit that it makes do without the dedicatedly constructed [[permutation]]s and its position specific [[Exponentiation#In abstract algebra|powers]] being inherent in the [[Verhoeff algorithm|Verhoeff scheme]]. Furthermore, a table of [[Inverse element|inverses]] can be dispensed with provided all main diagonal entries of the operation table are zero.\n\nThe Damm algorithm does not suffer from exceeding the number of 10 possible values, resulting in the need for using a non-digit character (as the [[X]] in the [[ISBN#ISBN-10 check digit calculation|10-digit ISBN]] [[Check digit#ISBN 10|check digit]] scheme).\n\nPrepending leading zeros does not affect the check digit.<ref name=\"fenwick2014\" />\n\nThere are totally anti-symmetric quasigroups that detect all phonetic errors associated with the English language (13 ↔ 30, 14 ↔ 40, ..., 19 ↔ 90). The table used in the illustrating example is based on an instance of such kind.\n\n===Weaknesses===\nDespite its desirable properties in typical contexts where similar algorithms are used, the Damm algorithm is largely unknown and scarcely used in practice.\n\nSince prepending leading zeros does not affect the check digit<ref name=\"fenwick2014\" />, variable length codes should not be verified together since, e.g., 0, 01, and 001, etc. produce the same check digit. However, all checksum algorithms are vulnerable to this.\n\n== Design ==\n\nIts essential part is a [[quasigroup]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 10 (i.e. having a {{nowrap|10 × 10}} [[Latin square]] as the body of its [[Cayley table|operation table]]) with the special feature of being [[Quasigroup#Total antisymmetry|weakly totally anti-symmetric]].<ref name=\"dhmd\" /><ref name=\"damm2007\" /><ref group=\"lower-roman\" name=\"BIS2003\" /><ref group=\"lower-roman\" name=\"Chen2009\" /><ref group=\"lower-roman\" name=\"Mileva2009\" /> Damm revealed several methods to create totally anti-symmetric quasigroups of order 10 and gave some examples in his doctoral dissertation.<ref name=\"dhmd\" /><ref group=\"lower-roman\" name=\"BIS2003\" /> With this, Damm also disproved an old conjecture that totally anti-symmetric quasigroups of order 10 do not exist.<ref name=\"damm2003\" />\n\nA quasigroup {{math|(''Q'', ∗)}} is called totally anti-symmetric if for all {{math|''c'', ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''Q''}}, the following implications hold:<ref name=\"damm2007\" />\n# {{math|1=(''c'' ∗ ''x'') ∗ ''y'' = (''c'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x'' ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''}}\n# {{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''y'' = ''y'' ∗ ''x'' ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''}},\n\nand it is called weak totally anti-symmetric if only the first implication holds. Damm proved that the existence of a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup of order {{math|''n''}} is equivalent to the existence of a weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup of order {{math|''n''}}. For the Damm algorithm with the check equation\n{{math|1=(…((0 ∗ ''x<sub>m</sub>'') ∗ ''x''<sub>''m''−1</sub>) ∗ …) ∗ ''x''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}\na weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup with the property \n{{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''x'' = 0}}\nis needed. Such a quasigroup can be constructed from any totally anti-symmetric quasigroup by rearranging the columns in such a way that all zeros lay on the diagonal. And, on the other hand, from any weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup can be constructed by rearranging the columns in such a way that the first row is in natural order.<ref name=\"dhmd\" />\n\n== Algorithm ==\nThe validity of a digit sequence containing a check digit is defined over a quasigroup. A quasigroup table ready for use can be taken from Damm's dissertation (pages 98, 106, 111).<ref name=\"dhmd\" /> It is useful if each main diagonal entry is 0,<ref name=fenwick2014 /> because it simplifies the check digit calculation.\n\n=== Validating a number against the included check digit ===\n#Set up an interim digit and initialize it to 0.\n#Process the number digit by digit: Use the number's digit as column index and the interim digit as row index, take the table entry and replace the interim digit with it.\n#The number is valid if and only if the resulting interim digit has the value of 0.<ref name=fenwick2014 />\n\n=== Calculating the check digit ===\n'''Prerequisite:''' The main diagonal entries of the table are 0.\n#Set up an interim digit and initialize it to 0.\n#Process the number digit by digit: Use the number's digit as column index and the interim digit as row index, take the table entry and replace the interim digit with it.\n#The resulting interim digit gives the check digit and will be appended as trailing digit to the number.<ref name=fenwick2014 />\n\n== Example ==\nThe following operation table will be used.<ref name=\"fenwick2014\" /> It may be obtained from the totally anti-symmetric quasigroup in Damm's doctoral dissertation page 111<ref name=\"dhmd\" /> by rearranging the rows and changing the entries correspondingly.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;background:none;color:#E000E0\"\n|- style=\"color:#00A000\"\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | \n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 0\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 1\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 2\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 3\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 4\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 5\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 6\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 7\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 8\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 9\n|-\n| 0\n|'''0'''||'''3'''||'''1'''||'''7'''||'''5'''||'''9'''||'''8'''||'''6'''||'''4'''||'''2'''\n|-\n| 1\n|'''7'''||'''0'''||'''9'''||'''2'''||'''1'''||'''5'''||'''4'''||'''8'''||'''6'''||'''3'''\n|-\n| 2\n|'''4'''||'''2'''||'''0'''||'''6'''||'''8'''||'''7'''||'''1'''||'''3'''||'''5'''||'''9'''\n|-\n| 3\n|'''1'''||'''7'''||'''5'''||'''0'''||'''9'''||'''8'''||'''3'''||'''4'''||'''2'''||'''6'''\n|-\n| 4\n|'''6'''||'''1'''||'''2'''||'''3'''||'''0'''||'''4'''||'''5'''||'''9'''||'''7'''||'''8'''\n|-\n| 5\n|'''3'''||'''6'''||'''7'''||'''4'''||'''2'''||'''0'''||'''9'''||'''5'''||'''8'''||'''1'''\n|-\n| 6\n|'''5'''||'''8'''||'''6'''||'''9'''||'''7'''||'''2'''||'''0'''||'''1'''||'''3'''||'''4'''\n|-\n| 7\n|'''8'''||'''9'''||'''4'''||'''5'''||'''3'''||'''6'''||'''2'''||'''0'''||'''1'''||'''7'''\n|-\n| 8\n|'''9'''||'''4'''||'''3'''||'''8'''||'''6'''||'''1'''||'''7'''||'''2'''||'''0'''||'''5'''\n|-\n| 9\n|'''2'''||'''5'''||'''8'''||'''1'''||'''4'''||'''3'''||'''6'''||'''7'''||'''9'''||'''0'''\n|}\nSuppose we choose the number (digit sequence) '''572'''.\n\n=== Calculating the check digit ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;background:none;color:#E000E0\"\n|- style=\"color:#00A000\"\n! style=\"color:black\" | <span style=\"color:#00A000\">digit to be processed</span> → column index\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 5\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 7\n| style=\"width:1.5em\" | 2\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" | old <span style=\"color:#E000E0\">interim digit</span> → row index\n|'''0'''\n|9\n|7\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" | table entry → new <span style=\"color:#E000E0\">interim digit</span>\n|9\n|7\n|'''4'''\n|}\nThe resulting interim digit is '''4'''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[algebra]], a '''domain''' is a [[zero ring|nonzero]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] in which {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = 0}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 0}} or {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 0}}.<ref name=\"Lam\">Lam (2001), p. 3</ref> (Sometimes such a ring is said to \"have the [[zero-product property]]\".) Equivalently, a domain is a ring in which 0 is the only left [[zero divisor]] (or equivalently, the only right zero divisor).   A [[commutative ring|commutative]] domain is called an [[integral domain]].<ref name=\"Lam\" /><ref>Rowen (1994), p. 99.</ref>  Mathematical literature contains multiple variants of the definition of \"domain\".<ref>Some authors also consider the [[zero ring]] to be a domain: see Polcino M. & Sehgal (2002), p. 65.  Some authors apply the term \"domain\" also to [[rng_(mathematics)|rngs]] with the zero-product property; such authors consider ''n'''''Z''' to be a domain for each positive integer ''n'': see Lanski (2005), p. 343.  But integral domains are always required to be nonzero and to have a 1.</ref>\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}\n\n== Examples and non-examples ==\n\n* The ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''' is not a domain, because the images of 2 and 3 in this ring are nonzero elements with product 0.  More generally, for a positive integer ''n'', the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is a domain if and only if ''n'' is prime.\n* A ''finite'' domain is automatically a [[finite field]], by [[Wedderburn's little theorem]].\n* The [[quaternions]] form a noncommutative domain. More generally, any [[division algebra]] is a domain, since all its nonzero elements are [[invertible]].\n* The set of all [[integral quaternion]]s is a noncommutative ring which is a subring of quaternions, hence a noncommutative domain.\n* A [[matrix ring]] M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') for ''n'' ≥ 2 is never a domain: if ''R'' is nonzero, such a matrix ring has nonzero zero divisors and even [[nilpotent]] elements other than 0. For example, the square of the [[matrix unit]] ''E''<sub>12</sub> is 0.\n* The [[tensor algebra]] of a [[vector space]], or equivalently, the algebra of polynomials in noncommuting variables over a field, <math> \\mathbb{K}\\langle x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\rangle, </math> is a domain. This may be proved using an ordering on the noncommutative monomials.\n* If ''R'' is a domain and ''S'' is an [[Ore extension]] of ''R'' then ''S'' is a domain.\n* The [[Weyl algebra]] is a noncommutative domain. Indeed, it is a domain by the [[#Constructions of domains|theorem below]], as it has two natural [[filtration (mathematics)|filtration]]s, by the degree of the derivative and by the total degree, and the associated graded ring for either one is isomorphic to the ring of polynomials in two variables.\n* The [[universal enveloping algebra]] of any [[Lie algebra]] over a field is a domain. The proof uses the standard filtration on the universal enveloping algebra and the [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]].\n\n== Constructions of domains ==\n\nOne way of proving that a ring is a domain is by exhibiting a filtration with special properties.\n\n'''Theorem:''' If ''R'' is a [[filtered algebra|filtered ring]] whose associated graded ring gr(''R'') is a domain, then ''R'' itself is a domain.\n\nThis theorem needs to be complemented by the analysis of the [[graded algebra|graded ring]] gr(''R'').\n\n== Group rings and the zero divisor problem ==\n\nSuppose that ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Is the [[group ring]] {{nowrap|1=''R'' = ''K''[''G'']}} a domain?  The identity\n\n: <math> (1-g)(1+g+\\ldots+g^{n-1})=1-g^n,</math>\n\nshows that an element ''g'' of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] {{nowrap|''n'' > 1}} induces a zero divisor {{nowrap|1 − ''g''}} in ''R''. The '''zero divisor problem''' asks whether this is the only obstruction; in other words,\n\n: Given a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' and a [[torsion-free group]] ''G'', is it true that ''K''[''G''] contains no zero divisors?\n\nNo counterexamples are known, but the problem remains open in general (as of 2017).\n\nFor many special classes of groups, the answer is affirmative. Farkas and Snider proved in 1976 that if ''G'' is a torsion-free [[polycyclic group|polycyclic-by-finite]] group and {{nowrap|1=char ''K'' = 0}} then the group ring ''K''[''G''] is a domain. Later (1980) Cliff removed the restriction on the characteristic of the field. In 1988, Kropholler, Linnell and Moody generalized these results to the case of torsion-free [[solvable group|solvable]] and solvable-by-finite groups. Earlier (1965) work of [[Michel Lazard]], whose importance was not appreciated by the specialists in the field for about 20 years, had dealt with the case where ''K'' is the ring of [[p-adic integers]] and ''G'' is the ''p''th [[congruence subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''Z''')}}.\n\n== Spectrum of an integral domain ==\n\nZero divisors have a topological interpretation, at least in the case of commutative rings: a ring ''R'' is an integral domain if and only if it is [[reduced ring|reduced]] and its [[Spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] Spec ''R'' is an [[irreducible topological space]]. The first property is often considered to encode some infinitesimal information, whereas the second one is more geometric.\n\nAn example: the ring {{nowrap|''k''[''x'', ''y'']/(''xy'')}}, where ''k'' is a field, is not a domain, since the images of ''x'' and ''y'' in this ring are zero divisors. Geometrically, this corresponds to the fact that the spectrum of this ring, which is the union of the lines {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 0}}, is not irreducible.

Let <math>(X,A,C)</math> be a triple of spaces, i.e. <math>C \\subseteq A \\subseteq X</math>. Define <math> \\rho(X,A,C)</math> to be the set of homotopy classes rel vertices of maps of a square into '''X''' which take the edges into '''A''' and the vertices into '''C'''. It is not entirely trivial to prove that the natural compositions of such squares in two directions are inherited by these homotopy classes to give a double groupoid, which also has an extra structure of so-called connections necessary to discuss the idea of commutative cube in a double groupoid.  This double groupoid is used in an essential way to prove a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which gives new information and computations on second relative homotopy groups as part of a crossed module.

For each idempotent ''e'' of ''S'', the set: <math> K_e= \\{ x \\in S\\;|\\; \\exists n>0:\\; x^n \\in G_e \\} </math> is called a ''unipotency class'' (whereas for periodic semigroups the usual name is torsion class.)<ref name=\"MikhalevPilz2002\"/>\n\nSubsemigroups of an epigroup need not be epigroups, but if they are, then they are called subepigroups. If an epigroup ''S'' has a partition in unipotent subepigroups (i.e. each containing a single idempotent), then this partition is unique, and its components are precisely the unipotency classes defined above; such an epigroup is called ''unipotently partionable''. However, not every epigroup has this property. A simple counterexample is the [[Brandt semigroup]] with five elements ''B<sub>2</sub>'' because the unipotency class of its zero element is not a subsemigroup. ''B<sub>2</sub>'' is actually the quintessential epigroup which is not unipotently partionable. An epigroup is unipotently partionable [[iff]] it contains no subsemigroup that is an [[ideal extension]] of an unipotent epigroup by ''B<sub>2</sub>''.<ref name=\"MikhalevPilz2002\"/>\n\n==See also==\n[[Special classes of semigroups]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Semigroup theory]]\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]"

For example, a [[quadratic form]] q : V → K over a field K, where V is a K-[[vector space]], is said to be defined over a subfield L of K if there exists a K-[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] e<sub>1</sub>,...,e<sub>n</sub> of V such that q can be expressed in the form <math>q(\\sum x_i e_i) = \\sum a_{ij} x_ix_j</math> with all coefficients a<sub>ij</sub> belonging to L. If K has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different from 2, every quadratic form is [[quadratic form#Equivalence of Quadratic Forms|diagonalizable]]. Therefore, q has a field of definition generated by n elements. Technically, one always works over a (fixed) base field k and the fields K and L in consideration are supposed to contain k. The essential dimension of q is then defined as the least [[transcendence degree]] over k of a subfield L of K over which q is defined.\n\n==Formal definition==\nFix an arbitrary field k and let ''Fields/k'' denote the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of finitely generated [[field extension]]s of k with inclusions as [[morphism]]s. Consider a (covariant) [[functor]] F : Fields/k → [[category of sets|Set]].\nFor a field extension K/k and an element ''a'' of F(K/k) a ''field of definition of a'' is an [[intermediate field]] K/L/k such that ''a'' is contained in the image of the map F(L/k) → F(K/k) induced by the inclusion of L in K.\n\nThe ''essential dimension of a'', denoted by ''ed(a)'', is the least transcendence degree (over k) of a field of definition for ''a''. The '''essential dimension of the functor F''', denoted by ''ed(F)'', is the supremum of ''ed(a)'' taken over all elements ''a'' of F(K/k) and objects K/k of Fields/k.\n\n==Examples==\n* Essential dimension of [[quadratic form]]s: For a natural number ''n'' consider the functor Q<sub>n</sub> : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of [[isomorphism class]]es of non-degenerate n-dimensional quadratic forms over K and taking a morphism L/k → K/k (given by the inclusion of L in K) to the map sending the isomorphism class of a quadratic form q : V → L to the isomorphism class of the quadratic form <math> q_K : V\\otimes_L K \\to K </math>.\n* Essential dimension of [[algebraic group]]s: For an algebraic group G over k denote by H<sup>1</sup>(-,G) : Fields/k → Set the functor taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes of G-[[torsor]]s over K (in the [[flat topology|fppf]]-topology). The essential dimension of this functor is called the ''essential dimension of the algebraic group G'', denoted by ed(G).\n* Essential dimension of a [[fibered category]]: Let <math> \\mathcal{F}</math> be a category fibered over the category <math>Aff/k </math> of affine k-schemes, given by a functor <math> p : \\mathcal{F} \\to Aff/k. </math> For example, <math> \\mathcal{F} </math> may be the [[Moduli of algebraic curves|moduli stack]] <math> \\mathcal{M}_g </math> of genus g curves or the classifying stack <math>\\mathcal{BG}</math> of an algebraic group. Assume that for each <math> A \\in Aff/k </math> the isomorphism classes of objects in the fiber p<sup>−1</sup>(A) form a set. Then we get a functor F<sub>p</sub> : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes in the fiber <math>p^{-1}(Spec(K))</math>. The essential dimension of the fibered category <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> is defined as the essential dimension of the corresponding functor F<sub>p</sub>. In case of the classifying stack <math>\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{BG}</math> of an algebraic group G the value coincides with the previously defined essential dimension of G.\n\n==Known results==\n\n* The essential dimension of a linear algebraic group G is always finite and bounded by the minimal dimension of a generically free [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] minus the dimension of G.\n* The essential dimension of a finite algebraic [[p-group]] over k equals the minimal dimension of a faithful representation, provided that the base field k contains a primitive p-th root of unity.\n* The essential dimension of the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> (viewed as algebraic group over k) is known for n≤5 (for every base field k), for n=6 (for k of characteristic not 2) and for n=7 (in characteristic 0).\n* Let T be an [[algebraic torus]] admitting a [[Galois field|Galois splitting field]] L/k of degree a power of a prime p. Then the essential dimension of T equals the least rank of the kernel of a homomorphism of Gal(L/k)-[[lattice (group)|lattice]]s P → X(T) with [[cokernel]] finite and of order prime to p, where P is a permutation lattice.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]"

A primary cyclic group is one whose [[order of a group|order]] is a power of a [[prime number|prime]].

Again, the rank ''n'' and the ''[[invariant factor]]s'' ''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''u''</sub> are uniquely determined by ''G'' (here with a unique order).

Stickelberger, Uber Grubben von vertauschbaren Elementen, J. reine u. angew.

There is the additional technicality of showing that a finitely ''presented'' abelian group is in fact finitely ''generated'', so Smith's classification is not a complete proof for finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nThe fundamental theorem for ''finitely generated'' abelian groups was proven by [[Henri Poincaré]] in {{harv|Poincaré|1900}}, using a matrix proof (which generalizes to principal ideal domains). This was done in the context of computing the\n[[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of a complex, specifically the [[Betti number]] and [[Torsion coefficient (topology)|torsion coefficient]]s of a dimension of the complex, where the Betti number corresponds to the rank of the free part, and the torsion coefficients correspond to the torsion part.<ref name=stillwell175 />\n\nKronecker's proof was generalized to ''finitely generated'' abelian groups by Emmy Noether in {{harv|Noether|1926}}.<ref name=stillwell175 />\n\n==Corollaries==\nStated differently the fundamental theorem says that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a [[free abelian group]] of finite [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] and a finite abelian group, each of those being unique up to isomorphism. The finite abelian group is just the [[torsion subgroup]] of ''G''. The rank of ''G'' is defined as the rank of the torsion-free part of ''G''; this is just the number ''n'' in the above formulas.\n\nA [[corollary]] to the fundamental theorem is that every finitely generated [[torsion-free abelian group]] is free abelian. The finitely generated condition is essential here: <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> is torsion-free but not free abelian.\n\nEvery [[subgroup]] and [[factor group]] of a finitely generated abelian group is again finitely generated abelian. The finitely generated abelian groups, together with the [[group homomorphism]]s, form an [[abelian category]] which is a [[Subcategory#Types_of_subcategories|Serre subcategory]] of the [[category of abelian groups]].\n\n==Non-finitely generated abelian groups==\nNote that not every abelian group of finite rank is finitely generated; the rank 1 group <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> is one counterexample, and the rank-0 group given by a direct sum of [[infinite set|countably infinitely many]] copies of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{2}</math> is another one.\n\n==See also==\n* The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] is a non-abelian generalization\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Henry J.

In algebraic geometry, the polynomial ring <math>k[t, \\dots, t_m]</math> is the coordinate ring of the affine space <math>k^m</math> and to give a point of <math>k^m</math> is to give a ring homomorphism (evaluation) <math>k[t, \\dots, t_m] \\to k</math> (either by the [[Hilbert nullstellensatz]] or by the [[scheme theory]]). The free ring <math>k\\langle t_1, \\dots, t_m \\rangle</math> plays the role of the coordinate ring of the affine space in the [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] (i.e., we don't demand free variables to commute) and thus a generic matrix ring of size ''n'' is the coordinate ring of a noncommutative affine variety whose points are the Spec's of matrix rings of size ''n'' (see below for a more concrete discussion.)\n\n=== The maximal spectrum of a generic matrix ring ===\n{{expand section|date=June 2014}}\n\nFor simplicity, assume ''k'' is algebraically closed.

      "title": "Grothendieck group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_group",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Grothendieck group''' construction constructs an [[abelian group]] from a [[commutative monoid]] {{math|''M''}} in the most universal way, in the sense that any abelian group containing a [[group homomorphism|homomorphic]] image of {{math|''M''}} will also contain a homomorphic image of the Grothendieck group of {{math|''M''}}. The Grothendieck group construction takes its name from a specific case in [[category theory]], introduced by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in his proof of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]], which resulted in the development of [[K-theory]]. This specific case is the monoid of isomorphism classes of objects of an [[abelian category]], with the [[direct sum]] as its operation.\n\n==Grothendieck group of a commutative monoid==\n\n===Motivation===\nGiven a commutative monoid ''M'', we want to construct \"the most general\" abelian group ''K'' that arises from ''M'' by introducing additive inverses. Such an abelian group ''K'' always exists; it is called the Grothendieck group of ''M''. It is characterized by a certain [[universal property]] and can also be concretely constructed from ''M''.\n\n===Universal property===\nLet ''M'' be a commutative monoid. Its Grothendieck group ''K'' is an abelian group with the following universal property: There exists a monoid homomorphism\n\n:<math>i : M \\to K</math>\n\nsuch that for any monoid homomorphism\n\n:<math>f : M \\to A</math>\n\nfrom the commutative monoid ''M'' to an abelian group ''A'', there is a unique group homomorphism\n\n:<math>g : K \\to A</math>\n\nsuch that\n\n:<math>f = g \\circ i.</math>\n\nThis expresses the fact that any abelian group ''A'' that contains a homomorphic image of ''M'' will also contain a homomorphic image of ''K'', ''K'' being the \"most general\" abelian group containing a homomorphic image of ''M''.\n\n===Explicit constructions===\nTo construct the Grothendieck group ''K'' of a commutative monoid ''M'', one forms the Cartesian product <math>M \\times M.</math> The two coordinates are meant to represent a positive part and a negative part, so (''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) corresponds to ''m''<sub>1</sub> − ''m''<sub>2</sub> in ''K''.\n\nAddition on ''M'' × ''M'' is defined coordinate-wise:\n\n:(''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) + (''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>) = (''m''<sub>1</sub> + ''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub>).\n\nNext we define an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'' × ''M''. We say that (''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) is equivalent to (''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>) if, for some element ''k'' of ''M'', ''m''<sub>1</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub> + ''k'' = ''m''<sub>2</sub> + ''n''<sub>1</sub> + ''k'' (the element ''k'' is necessary because the [[cancellation law]] does not hold in all monoids). The [[equivalence class]] of the element (''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) is denoted by [(''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>)]. We define ''K'' to be the set of equivalence classes. Since the addition operation on ''M'' × ''M'' is compatible with our equivalence relation, we obtain an addition on ''K'', and ''K'' becomes an abelian group. The identity element of ''K'' is [(0, 0)], and the inverse of [(''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>)] is [(''m''<sub>2</sub>, ''m''<sub>1</sub>)]. The homomorphism <math>i:M\\to K</math> sends the element ''m'' to [(''m'', 0)].\n\nAlternatively, the Grothendieck group ''K'' of ''M'' can also be constructed using [[presentation of a group|generators and relations]]: denoting by <math>(Z(M), +')</math> the [[free abelian group]] generated by the set ''M'', the Grothendieck group ''K'' is the [[quotient group|quotient]] of <math>Z(M)</math> by the subgroup generated by <math>\\{(x+'y)-'(x+y)\\mid x,y\\in M\\}</math>. (Here +′ and −′ denote the addition and subtraction in the free abelian group <math>Z(M)</math> while + denotes the addition in the monoid ''M''.) This construction has the advantage that it can be performed for any [[semigroup]] ''M'' and yields a group which satisfies the corresponding universal properties for semigroups, i.e. the \"most general and smallest group containing a homomorphic image of ''M''\". This is known as the \"group completion of a semigroup\" or \"group of fractions of a semigroup\".\n\n===Properties===\nIn the language of [[category theory]], any universal construction gives rise to a [[functor]]; we thus obtain a functor from the category of commutative monoids to the [[category of abelian groups]] which sends the commutative monoid ''M'' to its Grothendieck group ''K''. This functor is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of abelian groups to the category of commutative monoids.\n\nFor a commutative monoid ''M'', the map ''i''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&rarr;''K'' is injective if and only if ''M'' has the [[cancellation property]], and it is bijective if and only if ''M'' is already a group.\n\n===Examples: the integers, the Grothendieck group of a manifold and of a ring===\nThe easiest example of a Grothendieck group is the construction of the [[integer]]s <math>\\Z</math> from the [[natural numbers]] <math>\\N.</math> First one observes that the natural numbers (including 0) together with the usual addition indeed form a commutative monoid <math>(\\N, +).</math> Now when we use the Grothendieck group construction we obtain the formal differences between natural numbers as elements ''n'' − ''m'' and we have the equivalence relation\n\n:<math>n - m \\sim n' - m' \\Leftrightarrow n + m' = n'+ m</math>.\n\nNow define\n\n:<math>\\forall n \\in \\N: \\qquad \\begin{cases} n := [n - 0] \\\\ -n := [0 - n] \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThis defines the integers <math>\\Z</math> Indeed, this is the usual construction to obtain the integers from the natural numbers. See [[Integers#Construction|\"Construction\" under Integers]] for a more detailed explanation.\n\nThe Grothendieck group is the fundamental construction of [[K-theory]]. The group <math>K_0(M)</math> of a compact [[manifold]] ''M'' is defined to be the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of all isomorphism classes of [[vector bundle]]s of finite rank on ''M'' with the monoid operation given by direct sum. This gives a [[contravariant functor]] from manifolds to abelian groups. This functor is studied and extended in [[topological K-theory]].\n\nThe zeroth algebraic K group <math>K_0(R)</math> of a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''R'' is the Grothendieck group of the monoid consisting of isomorphism classes of finitely generated [[projective modules]] over ''R'', with the monoid operation given by the direct sum. Then <math>K_0</math> is a covariant functor from rings to abelian groups.\n\nThe two previous examples are related: consider the case where ''R'' is the ring <math>C^\\infty(M)</math> of complex-valued [[smooth function]]s on a compact manifold ''M''. In this case the projective ''R''-modules are [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to vector bundles over ''M'' (by the [[Serre-Swan theorem]]). Thus <math>K_0(R)</math> and <math>K_0(M)</math> are the same group.\n\n==Grothendieck group and extensions<!-- Ext functor links here -->==\n\n===Definition===\n\nAnother construction that carries the name '''Grothendieck group''' is the following: Let ''R'' be a finite-dimensional algebra over some field ''k'' or more generally an [[artinian ring]]. Then define the Grothendieck group <math>G_0(R)</math> as the abelian group generated by the set <math>\\{[X] | X \\in R\\mathrm{-Mod}\\}</math> of isomorphism classes of finitely generated ''R''-modules and the following relations: For every [[short exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0\\to A\\to B\\to C\\to 0</math>\n\nof ''R''-modules add the relation\n\n:<math>[A] - [B] + [C] = 0</math>\n\nNote that the proposed definition of Grothendieck group <math>G_0(R)</math> is well-defined. Let ''R'' be an Artinian ring, and suppose <math>M</math> and <math>M'</math> are isomorphic finitely generated ''R''-modules. Then there exists the following short exact sequence\n\n:<math> 0 \\to 0 \\to M \\to M' \\to 0 </math>\n\nThe exact sequence hence implies that <math>[0] - [M] + [M'] = 0</math>. Since <math>[0] = 0</math>, it follows that <math> [M] = [M']</math>. The proposed definition also implies that for any two finitely generated ''R''-modules ''M'' and ''N'', <math>[M \\oplus N] = [M] + [N]</math>. This follows from the given split short exact sequence.\n\n:<math> 0 \\to M \\to M \\oplus N \\to N \\to 0 </math>\n\n===Examples===\n\nLet ''K'' be a field. Then the Grothendieck group <math>G_0(K)</math> is an abelian group generated by symbols <math>[V]</math> for any finite dimensional ''K''-vector space ''V''. In fact, <math>G_0(K)</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\Z </math> whose generator is the element <math>[K]</math>. Here, the symbol <math>[V]</math> for a finite ''K''-vector space ''V'' is defined as <math>[V] = \\dim_K V</math>, the dimension of the vector space ''V''. Suppose we have the following short exact sequence of ''K''-vector spaces.\n\n:<math> 0 \\to V \\to T \\to W \\to 0 </math>\n\nSince any short exact sequence of vector spaces splits, it holds that <math>T \\cong V \\oplus W </math>. In fact, for any two finite dimensional vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' the following holds.\n\n:<math>\\dim_K(V \\oplus W) = \\dim_K(V) + \\dim_K(W)</math>\n\nThe above equality hence satisfies the condition of the symbol <math>[V]</math> in the Grothendieck group.\n\n:<math> [T] = [V \\oplus W] = [V] + [W] </math>\n\nNote that any two isomorphic finite dimensional ''K''-vector space has the same dimension. Also, any two finite dimensional ''K''-vector space ''V'' and ''W'' of same dimension are isomorphic to each other. In fact, every finite ''n''-dimensional ''K''-vector space ''V'' is isomorphic to <math>K^{\\oplus n}</math>. The observation from the previous paragraph hence proves the following equation. \n\n:<math>[V] = \\left [K^{\\oplus n} \\right ] = n[K]</math>\n\nHence, every symbol <math>[V]</math> is generated by the element <math>[K]</math> with integer coefficients, which implies that <math>G_0(K)</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\Z</math> with the generator <math>[K]</math>.\n\nMore generally, let <math>\\Z</math> be the set of integers. The Grothendieck group <math>G_0(\\Z)</math> is an abelian group generated by symbols <math>[A]</math> for any finitely generated abelian groups ''A''. We first note that any finite abelian group ''G'' satisfies that <math>[G] = 0</math>. The following short exact sequence holds, where the map <math>\\Z \\to \\Z</math> is multiplication by ''n''.\n\n:<math> 0 \\to \\Z \\to \\Z \\to \\Z /n\\Z \\to 0</math>\n\nThe exact sequence implies that <math>[\\Z /n\\Z] = [\\Z] - [\\Z] = 0</math>, so every cyclic group has its symbol equal to 0. This in turn implies that every finite abelian group ''G'' satisfies <math>[G] = 0</math> by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian groups. \n\nObserve that by the [[Finitely generated abelian group#Classification|Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]], every abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of a torsion subgroup and a torsion-free abelian group isomorphic to <math>\\Z^r</math> for some non-negative integer ''r''. Note that the integer ''r'' is defined as the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank of the abelian group]] ''A''. Define the symbol <math>[A]</math> as <math>[A] = Rank(A)</math>. Then the Grothendieck group <math>G_0(\\Z)</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\Z</math> with generator <math>[\\Z].</math> Indeed, the observation made from the previous paragraph shows that every abelian group ''A'' has its symbol <math>[A]</math> the same to the symbol <math>[\\Z^r] = r[\\Z]</math> where <math>r = Rank(A)</math>. Furthermore, the rank of the abelian group satisfies the conditions of the symbol <math>[A]</math> of the Grothendieck group. Suppose we have the following short exact sequence of abelian groups.\n\n:<math> 0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0 </math>\n\nThen tensoring with the rational numbers <math>\\Q</math> implies the following equation.\n\n:<math> 0 \\to A \\otimes_\\Z \\Q \\to B \\otimes_\\Z \\Q \\to C \\otimes_\\Z \\Q \\to 0 </math>\n\nSince the above is a short exact sequence of <math>\\Q</math>-vector spaces, the sequence splits. Therefore, we have the following equation.\n\n:<math> \\dim_\\Q (B \\otimes_\\Z \\Q ) = \\dim_\\Q (A \\otimes_\\Z \\Q) + \\dim_\\Q (C \\otimes_\\Z \\Q ) </math>\n\nOn the other hand, we also have the following relation. For more information, see: [[Rank_of_an_abelian_group|Rank of Abelian Group]].\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rank}(A) = \\dim_\\Q (A \\otimes_\\Z \\Q ) </math>\n\nTherefore, the following equation holds.\n\n:<math>[B] = \\operatorname{rank}(B) = \\operatorname{rank}(A) + \\operatorname{rank}(C) = [A] + [C]</math>\n\nHence we have shown that <math>G_0(\\Z)</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\Z</math> with generator <math>[\\Z].</math>\n\n===Universal Property===\n\nGrothendieck group satisfies a universal property. We make a preliminary definition: A function <math>\\chi</math> from the set of isomorphism classes to an abelian group <math>X</math> is called ''additive'' if, for each exact sequence <math>0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0</math>, we have <math>\\chi(A)-\\chi(B)+\\chi(C)= 0.</math> Then, for any additive function <math>\\chi: R\\text{-mod} \\to X</math>, there is a ''unique'' group homomorphism <math>f:G_0(R) \\to X</math> such that <math>\\chi</math> factors through ''<math>f</math>'' and the map that takes each object of <math>\\mathcal A</math> to the element representing its isomorphism class in <math>G_0(R).</math> Concretely this means that <math>f</math> satisfies the equation <math>f([V])=\\chi(V)</math> for every finitely generated <math>R</math>-module <math>V</math> and <math>f</math> is the only group homomorphism that does that.\n\nExamples of additive functions are the [[Character theory|character function]] from [[representation theory]]: If <math>R</math> is a finite-dimensional <math>k</math>-algebra, then we can associate the character <math>\\chi_V: R \\to k</math> to every finite-dimensional <math>R</math>-module <math>V: \\chi_V(x)</math> is defined to be the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the <math>k</math>-linear map that is given by multiplication with the element <math>x \\in R</math> on <math>V</math>.\n\nBy choosing a suitable basis and writing the corresponding matrices in block triangular form one easily sees that character functions are additive in the above sense. By the universal property this gives us a \"universal character\" <math>\\chi: G_0(R)\\to \\mathrm{Hom}_K(R,K)</math> such that <math>\\chi([V]) = \\chi_V</math>.\n\nIf <math>k=\\Complex</math> and <math>R</math> is the [[group ring]] <math>\\Complex[G]</math> of a [[finite group]] <math>G</math> then this character map even gives a [[natural transformation|natural]] isomorphism of <math>G_0(\\Complex[G])</math> and the character ring <math>Ch(G)</math>. In the [[modular representation theory]] of finite groups <math>k</math> can be a field <math>\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p},</math> the [[algebraic closure]] of the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements. In this case the analogously defined map that associates to each <math>k[G]</math>-module its [[Brauer character]] is also a natural isomorphism <math>G_0(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}[G])\\to \\mathrm{BCh}(G)</math> onto the ring of Brauer characters. In this way Grothendieck groups show up in representation theory.\n\nThis universal property also makes <math>G_0(R)</math> the 'universal receiver' of generalized [[Euler characteristic]]s. In particular, for every [[bounded complex]] of objects in <math>R\\text{-mod}</math>\n\n:<math> \\cdots \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to A^n \\to A^{n+1} \\to \\cdots \\to A^{m-1} \\to A^m \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to \\cdots </math>\n\nwe have a canonical element\n\n:<math> [A^*] = \\sum_i (-1)^i [A^i] = \\sum_i (-1)^i [H^i (A^*)] \\in G_0(R). </math>\n\nIn fact the Grothendieck group was originally introduced for the study of Euler characteristics.\n\n==Grothendieck groups of exact categories==\nA common generalization of these two concepts is given by the Grothendieck group of an [[exact category]] <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>. Simply put, an exact category is an additive category together with a class of distinguished short sequences ''A'' → ''B'' → ''C''. The distinguished sequences are called \"exact sequences\", hence the name. The precise axioms for this distinguished class do not matter for the construction of the Grothendieck group.\n\nThe Grothendieck group is defined in the same way as before as the abelian group with one generator [''M''] for each (isomorphism class of) object(s) of the category <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> and one relation\n\n:<math>[A]-[B]+[C] = 0</math>\n\nfor each exact sequence\n\n:<math>A\\hookrightarrow B\\twoheadrightarrow C</math>.\n\nAlternatively one can define the Grothendieck group using a similar universal property: An abelian group ''G'' together with a mapping <math>\\phi: \\mathrm{Ob}(\\mathcal{A})\\to G</math> is called the Grothendieck group of <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> iff every \"additive\" map <math>\\chi: \\mathrm{Ob}(\\mathcal{A})\\to X</math> from <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> into an abelian group ''X'' (\"additive\" in the above sense, i.e. for every exact sequence <math>A\\hookrightarrow B\\twoheadrightarrow C</math> we have <math>\\chi(A)-\\chi(B)+\\chi(C)=0</math>) factors uniquely through φ.\n\nEvery [[abelian category]] is an exact category if we just use the standard interpretation of \"exact\". This gives the notion of a Grothendieck group in the previous section if we choose <math>\\mathcal{A}:=R</math>-'''mod''' the category of finitely generated ''R''-modules as <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>. This is really abelian because ''R'' was assumed to be artinian and (hence noetherian) in the previous section.\n\nOn the other hand, every [[additive category]] is also exact if we declare those and only those sequences to be exact that have the form <math>A\\hookrightarrow A\\oplus B\\twoheadrightarrow B</math> with the canonical inclusion and projection morphisms. This procedure produces the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid <math>(\\mathrm{Iso}(\\mathcal{A}),\\oplus)</math> in the first sense (here <math>\\mathrm{Iso}(\\mathcal{A})</math> means the \"set\" [ignoring all foundational issues] of isomorphism classes in <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.)\n\n== Grothendieck groups of triangulated categories==\nGeneralizing even further it is also possible to define the Grothendieck group for [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]]. The construction is essentially similar but uses the relations [''X''] - [''Y''] + [''Z''] = 0 whenever there is a distinguished triangle ''X'' → ''Y'' → ''Z'' → ''X''[1].\n\n==Further examples==\n* In the abelian category of finite-dimensional [[vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', two vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. Thus, for a vector space ''V'' \n\n::<math>[V] = \\left [k^{\\dim(V)} \\right ] \\in K_0 (\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathrm{fin}}).</math> \n\n:Moreover, for an exact sequence\n\n::<math> 0 \\to k^l \\to k^m \\to k^n \\to 0 </math>\n\n:''m'' = ''l'' + ''n'', so\n\n::<math> \\left [k^{l+n} \\right ] = \\left [k^l \\right ] + \\left [k^n \\right ] = (l+n)[k]. </math>\n\n:Thus \n\n::<math>[V] = \\dim(V)[k],</math>\n\n:and <math>K_0(\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathrm{fin}})</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\Z</math> and is generated by <math>[k].</math> Finally for a bounded complex of finite-dimensional vector spaces ''V''*,\n\n::<math> [V^*] = \\chi(V^*)[k] </math>\n\n:where <math> \\chi </math> is the standard Euler characteristic defined by\n\n::<math> \\chi(V^*)= \\sum_i (-1)^i \\dim V = \\sum_i (-1)^i \\dim H^i(V^*). </math>\n\n* For a [[ringed space]] <math>(X,\\mathcal{O}_X)</math>, one can consider the category <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> of all [[locally free sheaf|locally free sheaves]] over ''X''. <math>K_0(X)</math> is then defined as the Grothendieck group of this exact category and again this gives a functor.\n\n* For a ringed space <math>(X,\\mathcal{O}_X)</math>, one can also define the category <math>\\mathcal A</math> to be the category of all [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on ''X''. This includes the special case (if the ringed space is an [[affine scheme]]) of <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> being the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian ring ''R''. In both cases <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> is an abelian category and a fortiori an exact category so the construction above applies.\n\n* In the case where ''R'' is a finite-dimensional algebra over some field, the Grothendieck groups <math>G_0(R)</math> (defined via short exact sequences of finitely generated modules) and <math>K_0(R)</math> (defined via direct sum of finitely generated projective modules) coincide. In fact, both groups are isomorphic to the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes of [[simple module|simple]] ''R''-modules.\n\n* There is another Grothendieck group <math>G_0</math> of a ring or a ringed space which is sometimes useful. The category in the case is chosen to be the category of all [[coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] on the ringed space which reduces to the category of all modules over some ring ''R'' in case of affine schemes. <math>G_0</math> is ''not'' a functor, but nevertheless it carries important information.\n\n* Since the (bounded) derived category is triangulated, there is a Grothendieck group for derived categories too. This has applications in representation theory for example. For the unbounded category the Grothendieck group however vanishes. For a derived category of some complex finite-dimensional positively graded algebra there is a subcategory in the unbounded derived category containing the abelian category A of finite-dimensional graded modules whose Grothendieck group is the ''q''-adic completion of the Grothendieck group of A.\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Topological K-theory]]\n* [[Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] for computing topological K-theory\n\n==References==\n* [[Michael F.

One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of [[integer]]s together with the [[addition]] operation, but groups are encountered in numerous areas within and outside mathematics, and help focusing on essential structural aspects, by detaching them from the concrete nature of the subject of the study.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2, p. 26|nb = yes}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Hall|year = 1967|loc = §1.1, p. 1|nb = yes}}: \"The idea of a group is one which pervades the whole of mathematics both pure and applied.\"</ref>\n\nGroups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of [[symmetry]]. For example, a [[symmetry group]] encodes symmetry features of a [[geometry|geometrical]] object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. [[Lie group]]s are the symmetry groups used in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]; [[Poincaré group]]s, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying [[special relativity]]; and [[point group]]s are used to help understand [[Molecular symmetry|symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry]].\n\nThe concept of a group arose from the study of [[polynomial equations]], starting with [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s.  After contributions from other fields such as [[number theory]] and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870.  Modern [[group theory]]—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.{{cref|a}} To explore groups, mathematicians have devised [[Glossary of group theory|various notions]] to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as [[subgroup]]s, [[quotient group]]s and [[simple group]]s. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of [[representation theory]] (that is, through the [[group representation|representations of the group]]) and of [[computational group theory]].  A theory has been developed for [[finite group]]s, which culminated with the [[classification of finite simple groups]], completed in 2004.{{cref|aa}} Since the mid-1980s, [[geometric group theory]], which studies [[finitely generated group]]s as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory.\n\n{{Group theory sidebar |image_param= |style_param=}}\n{{Algebraic structures |Group}}\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of group theory}}\nThe modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Wussing|year = 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|nb = yes}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Smith|year = 1906|nb = yes}}</ref> The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician [[Évariste Galois]], extending prior work of [[Paolo Ruffini]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the [[symmetry group]] of its [[root of a function|roots]] (solutions).  The elements of such a [[Galois group]] correspond to certain [[permutation]]s of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Galois|year = 1908|nb = yes}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 202|nb = yes}}</ref> More general [[permutation group]]s were investigated in particular by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. [[Arthur Cayley]]'s ''On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ<sup>n</sup> = 1'' (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a [[finite group]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Cayley|year=1889|nb=yes}}</ref>\n\nGeometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of [[Felix Klein]]'s 1872 [[Erlangen program]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §III.2|nb = yes}}</ref> After novel geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] and [[projective geometry]] had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, [[Sophus Lie]] founded the study of [[Lie group]]s in 1884.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Lie|year=1973|nb=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe third field contributing to group theory was [[number theory]]. Certain [[abelian group]] structures had been used implicitly in [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' number-theoretical work ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798), and more explicitly by [[Leopold Kronecker]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 204|nb = yes}}</ref> In 1847, [[Ernst Kummer]] made early attempts to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]  by developing [[class group|groups describing factorization]] into [[prime number]]s.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §I.3.4|nb = yes}}</ref>\n\nThe convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with [[Camille Jordan]]'s ''Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques'' (1870).<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Jordan|year=1870|nb=yes}}</ref> [[Walther von Dyck]] (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an \"abstract group\", in the terminology of the time.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=von Dyck|year=1882|nb=yes}}</ref> As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] and [[William Burnside]], who worked on [[representation theory]] of finite groups, [[Richard Brauer]]'s [[modular representation theory]] and [[Issai Schur]]'s papers.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Curtis |year = 2003|nb = yes}}</ref> The theory of Lie groups, and more generally [[locally compact group]]s was studied by [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Élie Cartan]] and many others.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Mackey|year=1976|nb=yes}}</ref> Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of [[algebraic group]]s, was first shaped by [[Claude Chevalley]] (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of [[Armand Borel]] and [[Jacques Tits]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Borel|year=2001|nb=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe [[University of Chicago]]'s 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as [[Daniel Gorenstein]], [[John G. Thompson]] and [[Walter Feit]], laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], with the final step taken by [[Michael Aschbacher|Aschbacher]] and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|nb = yes}}</ref> These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.{{cref|a}}\n\n== Definition and illustration==\n\n===First example: the integers===\nOne of the most familiar groups is the set of [[integers]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> which consists of the numbers\n:..., −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&nbsp;...,<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = App. 2, p. 360|nb = yes}}</ref> together with [[addition]].\nThe following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms given in the definition below.\n\n*For any two integers ''a'' and ''b'', the [[Summation|sum]] ''a'' + ''b'' is also an integer. That is, addition of integers always yields an integer. This property is known as ''[[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]'' under addition.\n*For all integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'').   Expressed in words, adding ''a'' to ''b'' first, and then adding the result to ''c'' gives the same final result as adding ''a'' to the sum of ''b'' and ''c'', a property known as ''[[associativity]]''.\n*If ''a'' is any integer, then 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''. [[Zero]] is called the ''[[identity element]]'' of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.\n*For every integer ''a'', there is an integer ''b'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' = 0. The integer ''b''  is called the ''[[inverse element]]'' of the integer ''a'' and is denoted −''a''.\n\nThe integers, together with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following [[definition]] is developed.\n\n===Definition===\n{{quote box\n|align = right\n|width=33%\n|quote=The axioms for a group are short and natural... Yet somehow hidden behind these axioms is the [[Monster group|monster simple group]], a huge and extraordinary mathematical object, which appears to rely on numerous bizarre coincidences to exist. The axioms for groups give no obvious hint that anything like this exists.\n|source=[[Richard Borcherds]] in ''Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World'' <ref>{{Citation |last=Cook |first=Mariana R. |year=2009 |title=Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-place=Princeton, N.J. |page=24 | isbn=9780691139517 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06h8NT77OgMC&vq=Richard%20Ewen%20Borcherds&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q=Richard%20Ewen%20Borcherds&f=false |accessdate= }}</ref>\n}}\n\nA group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''G'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] • (called the ''group law'' of ''G'') that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element, denoted {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} or ''ab''. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}, must satisfy four requirements known as the ''group axioms'':<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.1, p. 27|nb = yes}}</ref>\n\n;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''G'', the result of the operation, ''a'' • ''b'', is also in ''G''.{{cref|b}}\n;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''G'', (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'').\n;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''G'' such that, for every element ''a'' in ''G'', the equation {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''}} holds. Such an element is unique ([[#Uniqueness of identity element and inverses|see below]]), and thus one speaks of ''the'' identity element. \n;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''G'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''G'', commonly denoted ''a''<sup>−1</sup> (or −''a'', if the operation is denoted \"+\"), such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.\n\nThe result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element ''a'' with element ''b'' need not yield the same result as combining element ''b'' with element ''a''; the equation\n:{{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}}\nmay not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} for any two integers  ([[commutativity]] of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}} always holds are called ''[[abelian group]]s'' (in honor of [[Niels Henrik Abel]]). The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian.\n\nThe identity element of a group ''G'' is often written as 1 or 1<sub>''G''</sub>,<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Identity Element |urlname=IdentityElement}}</ref> a notation inherited from the [[multiplicative identity]]. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as ''id''.\n\nThe set ''G'' is called the ''underlying set'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Often the group's underlying set ''G'' is used as a short name for the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Along the same lines, shorthand expressions such as \"a subset of the group ''G''\" or \"an element of group ''G''\" are used when what is actually meant is \"a subset of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}\" or \"an element of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}\".  Usually, it is clear from the context whether a symbol like ''G'' refers to a group or to an underlying set.\n\nAn alternate (but equivalent) definition is to expand the structure of a group to define a group as a set equipped with three operations satisfying the same axioms as above, with the \"there exists\" part removed in the two last axioms, these operations being\nthe group law, as above, which is a [[binary operation]],\nthe ''inverse operation'', which is a [[unary operation]] and maps {{mvar|a}} to <math>a^{-1},</math>\nand the identity element, which is viewed as a [[0-ary function|0-ary operation]].\n\nAs this formulation of the definition avoids [[existential quantifier]]s, it is generally preferred for [[computational group theory|computing with groups]] and for [[computer-aided proof]]s. This formulation exhibits groups as a variety of [[universal algebra]]. It is also useful for talking of properties of the inverse operation, as needed for defining [[topological group]]s and [[group object]]s.\n\n=== Second example: a symmetry group ===\nTwo figures in the plane are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if one can be changed into the other using a combination of [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s, and [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s.  Any figure is congruent to itself.  However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called [[symmetry|symmetries]]. A square has eight symmetries. These are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ The elements of the symmetry group of the square (D<sub>4</sub>). Vertices are identified by color or number.\n|-\n| [[Image:group D8 id.svg|140px]] <br /> id (keeping it as it is) || [[Image:group D8 90.svg|140px]] <br /> r<sub>1</sub> (rotation by 90° clockwise) || [[Image:group D8 180.svg|140px]] <br /> r<sub>2</sub> (rotation by 180° clockwise) || [[Image:group D8 270.svg|140px]] <br /> r<sub>3</sub> (rotation by 270° clockwise)\n|-\n| [[Image:group D8 fv.svg|140px]] <br /> f<sub>v</sub> (vertical reflection) || [[Image:group D8 fh.svg|140px]] <br /> f<sub>h</sub> (horizontal reflection)|| [[Image:group D8 f13.svg|140px]] <br /> f<sub>d</sub> (diagonal reflection) || [[Image:group D8 f24.svg|140px]] <br /> f<sub>c</sub> (counter-diagonal reflection)\n|}\n* the [[identity operation]] leaving everything unchanged, denoted id;\n* rotations of the square around its center by 90° clockwise, 180° clockwise, and 270° clockwise, denoted by r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub> and r<sub>3</sub>, respectively;\n* reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line (f<sub>h</sub> and f<sub>v</sub>), or through the two [[diagonal]]s (f<sub>d</sub> and f<sub>c</sub>).\n{{clear}}\n\nThese symmetries are represented by functions. Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r<sub>1</sub> sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and f<sub>h</sub> sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function.  These symmetries determine a group called the [[dihedral group]] of degree 4 and denoted D<sub>4</sub>.  The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is [[function composition]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.6, p. 54|nb = yes}}</ref> Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application.  The result of performing first ''a'' and then ''b'' is written symbolically ''from right to left'' as\n:{{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} (\"apply the symmetry ''b'' after performing the symmetry ''a''\").\nThe right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions.\n\nThe [[group table]] on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r<sub>3</sub>) and then reflecting horizontally (f<sub>h</sub>) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (f<sub>d</sub>).

A left and right [[coset]] of this subgroup is highlighted in {{color box|#9DFF93}} green (in the last row) and {{color box|#FFFC93}} yellow (last column), respectively.\n|}\nGiven this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:\n{{ordered list\n|1= The closure axiom demands that the composition {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} of any two symmetries ''a'' and ''b'' is also a symmetry. Another example for the group operation is\n:{{nowrap|r<sub>3</sub> • f<sub>h</sub> {{=}} f<sub>c</sub>,}}\ni.e., rotating 270° clockwise after reflecting horizontally equals reflecting along the counter-diagonal (f<sub>c</sub>). Indeed every other combination of two symmetries still gives a symmetry, as can be checked using the group table.\n\n|2= The associativity constraint deals with composing more than two symmetries: Starting with three elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of D<sub>4</sub>, there are two possible ways of using these three symmetries in this order to determine a symmetry of the square.  One of these ways is to first compose ''a'' and ''b'' into a single symmetry, then to compose that symmetry with ''c''.  The other way is to first compose ''b'' and ''c'', then to compose the resulting symmetry with ''a''.  The associativity condition\n:{{nowrap|1=(''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')}}\nmeans that these two ways are the same, i.e., a product of many group elements can be simplified in any grouping.\nFor example, {{nowrap|1=(f<sub>d</sub> • f<sub>v</sub>) • r<sub>2</sub> = f<sub>d</sub> • (f<sub>v</sub> • r<sub>2</sub>)}} can be checked using the group table at the right\n{{aligned table|cols=5|style=margin-left:1.2em\n|(f<sub>d</sub> • f<sub>v</sub>) • r<sub>2</sub>|&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;|r<sub>3</sub> • r<sub>2</sub>|&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;|r<sub>1</sub>, which equals\n|f<sub>d</sub> • (f<sub>v</sub> • r<sub>2</sub>)|{{=}}|f<sub>d</sub> • f<sub>h</sub>|{{=}}|r<sub>1</sub>.\n}}\nWhile associativity is true for the symmetries of the square and addition of numbers, it is not true for all operations.  For instance, subtraction of numbers is not associative: {{nowrap|(7 − 3) − 2 {{=}} 2}} is not the same as {{nowrap|7 − (3 − 2) {{=}} 6.}}\n\n|3= The identity element is the symmetry id leaving everything unchanged: for any symmetry ''a'', performing id after ''a'' (or ''a'' after id) equals ''a'', in symbolic form,\n: {{nowrap|1=id • ''a'' = ''a'',}}\n: {{nowrap|1=''a'' • id = ''a''.}}\n\n|4= An inverse element undoes the transformation of some other element. Every symmetry can be undone: each of the following transformations—identity id, the reflections f<sub>h</sub>, f<sub>v</sub>, f<sub>d</sub>, f<sub>c</sub> and the 180° rotation r<sub>2</sub>—is its own inverse, because performing it twice brings the square back to its original orientation. The rotations r<sub>3</sub> and r<sub>1</sub> are each other's inverses, because rotating 90° and then rotation 270° (or vice versa) yields a rotation over 360° which leaves the square unchanged. In symbols,\n:{{nowrap|f<sub>h</sub> • f<sub>h</sub> {{=}} id,}}\n:{{nowrap|r<sub>3</sub> • r<sub>1</sub> {{=}} r<sub>1</sub> • r<sub>3</sub> {{=}} id.}}\n}}\n\nIn contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is irrelevant, it does matter in D<sub>4</sub>: {{nowrap|f<sub>h</sub> • r<sub>1</sub> {{=}} f<sub>c</sub>}} but {{nowrap|r<sub>1</sub> • f<sub>h</sub> {{=}} f<sub>d</sub>.}} In other words, D<sub>4</sub> is not abelian, which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first.\n\n==Elementary consequences of the group axioms ==\nBasic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under ''elementary group theory''.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Ledermann|year = 1953|loc = §1.2, pp. 4–5|nb = yes}}</ref> For example, [[Mathematical induction|repeated]] applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of\n:''a'' • ''b'' • ''c'' = (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')\ngeneralizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §I.1, p. 3}}</ref>\n\nThe axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a [[left identity]] and [[left inverse element|left inverse]]s. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Uniqueness of identity element and inverses===\nTwo important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of ''the'' identity, and ''the'' inverse of an element.<ref name=\"lang2005\">{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 17}}</ref>\n\nTo prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of ''a'', suppose that ''a'' has two inverses, denoted ''b'' and ''c'', in a group (''G'', •). Then\n\n:{|\n|''b'' ||=||''b'' • ''e'' ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||as ''e'' is the identity element\n|-\n| ||=||''b'' • (''a'' • ''c'') ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||because ''c'' is an inverse of ''a'', so ''e'' = ''a'' • ''c''\n|-\n| ||=||(''b'' • ''a'') • ''c'' ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||by associativity, which allows rearranging the parentheses\n|-\n| ||=||''e'' • ''c''||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||since ''b'' is an inverse of ''a'', i.e., ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e''\n|-\n| ||=||''c''||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| for ''e'' is the identity element\n|}\n\nThe term ''b'' on the first line above and the ''c'' on the last are equal, since they are connected by a chain of equalities. In other words, there is only one inverse element of ''a''.  Similarly, to prove that the identity element of a group is unique, assume ''G'' is a group with two identity elements ''e'' and ''f''. Then ''e'' = ''e'' • ''f'' = ''f'', hence ''e'' and ''f'' are equal.\n\n===<span id=\"translation\"></span>Division===\nIn groups, the existence of inverse elements implies that [[division (mathematics)|division]] is possible: given elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the group ''G'', there is exactly one solution ''x'' in ''G'' to the [[equation]] {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''<sup>−1</sup>}}.<ref name=\"lang2005\"/> In fact, we have \n:{{nowrap|1= (''b'' • ''a''<sup>−1</sup>) • ''a'' =  ''b'' • (''a''<sup>−1</sup> • ''a'') = ''b'' • ''e'' = ''b''.}}\nUniqueness results by multiplying the two sides of the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}} by {{nowrap|''a''<sup>−1</sup>}}. The element {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''<sup>−1</sup>}}, often denoted {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}, is called the ''right quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', or the result of the ''right division'' of ''b'' by ''a''.\n\nSimilarly there is exactly one solution ''y'' in ''G'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''y'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''a''<sup>−1</sup> • ''b''}}. This solution is the ''left quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', and is sometimes denoted {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}.\n\nIn general {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}} may be different, but, if the group operation is [[commutative]] (that is, if the group is [[abelian group|abelian]]), they are equal. In this case, the group operation is often denoted as an [[addition]], and one talks of ''subtraction'' and ''difference'' instead of division and quotient.\n\nA consequence of this is that multiplication by a group element ''g'' is a [[bijection]]. Specifically, if ''g'' is an element of the group ''G'', the [[function (mathematics)]] from ''G'' to itself that maps {{nowrap|''h'' ∈ ''G''}} to {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}} is a bijection. This function is called the ''left translation'' by ''g'' . Similarly, the ''right translation'' by ''g'' is the bijection from ''G'' to itself, that maps ''h'' to {{nowrap|''h'' • ''g''}}. If ''G'' is abelian, the left and the right translation by a group element are the same.\n\n== Basic concepts ==\n:<div class=\"dablink\">''The following sections use [[table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] such as'' {{nowrap|1=''X'' = {''x'', ''y'', ''z''} }} ''to denote a [[set (mathematics)|set]]'' ''X'' ''containing [[element (mathematics)|elements]]'' ''x'', ''y'', ''and'' ''z'', ''or alternatively'' {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} ''to restate that'' ''x'' ''is an element of'' ''X''. ''The notation'' {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} ''means'' ''f'' ''is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] assigning to every element of'' ''X'' ''an element of'' ''Y''.</div>\n\nTo understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed.{{cref|c}} There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being \"structureless\", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be ''compatible'' with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of \"preserving structures\"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], in this case the [[category of groups]].<ref name=\"MacLane\"/>\n\n===Group homomorphisms===\n{{Main|Group homomorphism}}\n''Group homomorphisms''{{cref|g}} are functions that preserve group structure.  A function {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} between two groups {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}} and {{nowrap|(''H'', ∗)}} is called a ''homomorphism'' if the equation\n:{{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'' • ''k'') = ''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''k'')}}\nholds for all elements ''g'', ''k'' in ''G''. In other words, the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map ''a''. This requirement ensures that {{nowrap|1=''a''(1<sub>''G''</sub>) = 1<sub>''H''</sub>}}, and also {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'')<sup>−1</sup> = ''a''(''g''<sup>−1</sup>)}} for all ''g'' in ''G''. Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of ''G'' provided by the group axioms.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.3, p. 34}}</ref>\n\nTwo groups ''G'' and ''H'' are called ''[[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]]'' if there exist group homomorphisms {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} and {{nowrap|''b'': ''H'' → ''G''}}, such that applying the two functions [[function composition|one after another]] in each of the two possible orders gives the [[identity function]]s of ''G'' and ''H''. That is, {{nowrap|1=''a''(''b''(''h'')) = ''h''}} and {{nowrap|1=''b''(''a''(''g'')) = ''g''}} for any ''g'' in ''G'' and ''h'' in ''H''. From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that {{nowrap|1=''g'' • ''g'' = 1<sub>''G''</sub>}} for some element ''g'' of ''G'' is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] to proving that {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''g'') = 1<sub>''H''</sub>}}, because applying ''a'' to the first equality yields the second, and applying ''b'' to the second gives back the first.\n\n===Subgroups===\n{{Main|Subgroup}}\nInformally, a ''subgroup'' is a group ''H'' contained within a bigger one, ''G''.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 19}}</ref> Concretely, the identity element of ''G'' is  contained in ''H'', and whenever ''h''<sub>1</sub> and ''h''<sub>2</sub> are in ''H'', then so are {{nowrap|''h''<sub>1</sub> •  ''h''<sub>2</sub>}} and ''h''<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>, so the elements of ''H'', equipped with the group operation on ''G'' restricted to ''H'', indeed form a group.\n\nIn the example above, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>3</sub>},}} highlighted in red in the group table above: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations  270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270° (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined). The [[subgroup test]] is a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient condition]] for a nonempty subset ''H'' of a group ''G'' to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that {{nowrap|''g''<sup>−1</sup>''h'' ∈ ''H''}} for all elements {{nowrap|''g'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''}}. Knowing [[lattice of subgroups|the subgroups]] is important in understanding the group as a whole.{{cref|d}}\n\nGiven any subset ''S'' of a group ''G'', the subgroup generated by ''S'' consists of products of elements of ''S'' and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of ''G'' containing ''S''.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §II.12, p. 39}}</ref> In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r<sub>2</sub> and f<sub>v</sub> consists of these two elements, the identity element id and {{nowrap|1=f<sub>h</sub> = f<sub>v</sub> • r<sub>2</sub>}}. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.\n\n===Cosets===\n{{Main|Coset}}\nIn many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D<sub>4</sub> above, once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r<sub>2</sub> configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e., the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup ''H'' defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of ''H'' by arbitrary group elements ''g''. In symbolic terms, the ''left'' and ''right'' cosets of ''H'' containing ''g'' are\n\n:{{nowrap|1=''gH'' = {''g'' • ''h'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''} }} and {{nowrap|1=''Hg'' = {''h'' • ''g'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''},}} respectively.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 41}}</ref>\n\nThe left cosets of any subgroup ''H'' form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of ''G''; that is, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of all left cosets is equal to ''G'' and two left cosets are either equal or have an [[empty set|empty]] [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 12}}</ref> The first case {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>1</sub>''H'' = ''g''<sub>2</sub>''H''}} happens [[if and only if|precisely when]] {{nowrap|''g''<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup> • ''g''<sub>2</sub> ∈ ''H''}}, i.e., if the two elements differ by an element of ''H''. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of ''H''. The left and right cosets of ''H'' may or may not be equal. If they are, i.e., for all ''g'' in ''G'', {{nowrap|1=''gH'' = ''Hg''}}, then ''H'' is said to be a ''[[normal subgroup]]''.\n\nIn D<sub>4</sub>, the introductory symmetry group, the left cosets ''gR'' of the subgroup ''R'' consisting of the rotations are either equal to ''R'', if ''g'' is an element of ''R'' itself, or otherwise equal to {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f<sub>c</sub>''R'' = {f<sub>c</sub>, f<sub>v</sub>, f<sub>d</sub>, f<sub>h</sub>} }} (highlighted in green). The subgroup ''R'' is also normal, because {{nowrap|1=f<sub>c</sub>''R'' = ''U'' = ''R''f<sub>c</sub>}} and similarly for any element other than f<sub>c</sub>. (In fact, in the case of D<sub>4</sub>, observe that all such cosets are equal, such that {{nowrap|1=f<sub>h</sub>''R'' = f<sub>v</sub>''R'' = f<sub>d</sub>''R'' = f<sub>c</sub>''R''}}.)\n\n===Quotient groups===\n{{Main|Quotient group}}\nIn some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law, giving a ''quotient group'' or ''factor group''. For this to be possible, the subgroup has to be [[normal subgroup|normal]]. Given any normal subgroup ''N'', the quotient group is defined by\n:''G'' / ''N'' = {''gN'', ''g'' ∈ ''G''}, \"''G'' modulo ''N''\".<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 45}}</ref>\n\nThis set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication, or coset addition) from the original group ''G'': {{nowrap|1=(''gN'') • (''hN'') = (''gh'')''N''}} for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''. This definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}} that associates to any element ''g'' its coset ''gN'' be a group homomorphism, or by general abstract considerations called [[universal property|universal properties]]. The coset {{nowrap|1=''eN '' = ''N''}} serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of ''gN'' in the quotient group is {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')<sup>−1</sup> = (''g''<sup>−1</sup>)''N''}}.{{cref|e}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:.5em 0 .5em 1em; width:200px;\"\n|+ Group table of the quotient group {{nowrap|D<sub>4</sub> / ''R''}}\n|-\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| •\n! style=\"width:33%;\"| R\n! style=\"width:33%;\"| U\n|-\n! ''R''\n| ''R'' || ''U''\n|-\n! ''U''\n| ''U'' || ''R''\n|}\nThe elements of the quotient group {{nowrap|D<sub>4</sub> / ''R''}} are ''R'' itself, which represents the identity, and {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f<sub>v</sub>''R''}}. The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right. For example, {{nowrap|1=''U'' • ''U'' = f<sub>v</sub>''R'' • f<sub>v</sub>''R'' = (f<sub>v</sub> • f<sub>v</sub>)''R'' = ''R''}}. Both the subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>3</sub>},}} as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian, whereas D<sub>4</sub> is not abelian. Building bigger groups by smaller ones, such as D<sub>4</sub> from its subgroup ''R'' and the quotient {{nowrap|D<sub>4</sub> / ''R''}} is abstracted by a notion called [[semidirect product]].\n\nQuotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its ''[[presentation of a group|presentation]]'': any group is the quotient of the [[free group]] over the ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of the group, quotiented by the subgroup of ''relations''. The dihedral group D<sub>4</sub>, for example, can be generated by two elements ''r'' and ''f'' (for example, ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;r<sub>1</sub>, the right rotation and ''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;f<sub>v</sub> the vertical (or any other) reflection), which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses. Together with the relations\n:''r ''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f ''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''r'' • ''f'')<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 9}}</ref>\nthe group is completely described. A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the [[Cayley graph]], a device used to graphically capture [[discrete group]]s.\n\nSub- and quotient groups are related in the following way: a subset ''H'' of ''G'' can be seen as an [[injective]] map {{nowrap|''H'' → ''G''}}, i.e., any element of the target has at most one [[preimage|element that maps to it]]. The counterpart to injective maps are [[surjective]] maps (every element of the target is mapped onto), such as the canonical map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}}.{{cref|y}} Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction. In general, homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective. [[Kernel (algebra)|Kernel]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of group homomorphisms and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] address this phenomenon.\n\n==Examples and applications==\n{{Main|Examples of groups|Applications of group theory}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 180\n| image1    = Wallpaper group-cm-6.jpg\n| width1    = 150\n| caption1  = A periodic wallpaper pattern gives rise to a [[wallpaper group]].\n| image2    = Fundamental group.svg\n| width2    = 180\n| caption2  = The fundamental group of a plane minus a point (bold) consists of loops around the missing point. This group is isomorphic to the integers.\n}}\nExamples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group '''Z''' of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition [[multiplication]] is considered, one obtains [[multiplicative group]]s. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in [[abstract algebra]].\n\nGroups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by [[functor|associating]] groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, [[Henri Poincaré]] founded what is now called [[algebraic topology]] by introducing the [[fundamental group]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Hatcher|year = 2002|loc = Chapter I, p. 30}}</ref> By means of this connection, [[Glossary of topology|topological properties]] such as [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|proximity]] and [[continuous function|continuity]] translate into properties of groups.{{cref|i}} For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered [[null-homotopic]] (and thus irrelevant), because it can be [[homotopy|continuously shrunk]] to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop [[winding number|winding once]] around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.\n\nIn more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background.{{cref|j}} In a similar vein, [[geometric group theory]] employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of [[hyperbolic group]]s.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Coornaert|last2 = Delzant|last3=Papadopoulos|year = 1990}}</ref> Further branches crucially applying groups include [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].<ref>for example, [[class group]]s and [[Picard group]]s; see {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}, in particular §§I.12 and I.13</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. [[Cryptography]] relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with [[algorithm]]ical knowledge obtained in [[computational group theory]], in particular when implemented for finite groups.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Seress|year = 1997}}</ref> Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[computer science]] benefit from the concept.\n\n=== Numbers ===\nMany number systems, such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Further [[abstract algebra]]ic concepts such as [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[algebra over a field|algebras]] also form groups.\n\n==== Integers ====\nThe group of integers <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> under addition, denoted <math>\\left(\\mathbb{Z},+\\right)</math>, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of [[multiplication]] instead of addition, <math>\\left(\\mathbb{Z},\\cdot\\right)</math> do ''not'' form a group. The closure, associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 2}} is an integer, but the only solution to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a · b'' = 1}} in this case is {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1/2}}, which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> has a (multiplicative) inverse.{{cref|k}}\n\n==== Rationals ====\nThe desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n:<math alt=\"a/b\">\\frac{a}{b}.</math>\nFractions of integers (with ''b'' nonzero) are known as [[rational number]]s.{{cref|l}} The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>. There is still a minor obstacle for <math>\\left(\\mathbb{Q},\\cdot\\right)</math>, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because the rational number [[0 (number)|0]] does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' · 0 = 1}}), <math>\\left(\\mathbb{Q},\\cdot\\right)</math> is still not a group.\n\nHowever, the set of all ''nonzero'' rational numbers <math>\\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\left\\{0\\right\\}=\\left\\{q\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\mid q\\neq 0\\right\\}</math> does form an abelian group under multiplication, generally denoted <math>\\mathbb{Q}^*</math>.{{cref|m}} Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of ''a''/''b'' is ''b''/''a'', therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.\n\nThe rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and—if division is possible, such as in <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>—[[field (mathematics)|fields]], which occupy a central position in [[abstract algebra]]. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.{{cref|n}}\n\n===Modular arithmetic===\n\n[[File:Clock group.svg|thumb|right|The hours on a clock form a group that uses [[Modular arithmetic|addition modulo]] 12. Here 9 + 4 = 1.]]\nIn [[modular arithmetic]], two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the ''modulus.'' The result of modular addition is the [[remainder]] of that division. For any modulus, ''n'', the set of integers from 0 to {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element ''a'' is {{nowrap|''n'' − ''a''}}, and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a [[12-hour clock|clock]]: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 \"modulo 12\" or, in symbols,\n:9 + 4 ≡ 1 modulo 12.\nThe group of integers modulo ''n'' is written <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math> or <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\nFor any [[prime number]] ''p'', there is also the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''p'']].<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = Chapter VII}}</ref> Its elements are the integers 1 to {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}. The group operation is multiplication modulo ''p''. That is, the usual product is divided by ''p'' and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, {{nowrap|1=4 · 4 = 1}}, because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1.  for 5 divides {{nowrap|1=16 − 1 = 15}}, denoted\n:16 ≡ 1 (mod 5).\nThe primality of ''p'' ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by ''p'' is not divisible by ''p'' either, hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication.{{cref|o}} The identity element is 1, as usual for a multiplicative group, and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer ''a'' not divisible by ''p'', there exists an integer ''b'' such that\n:''a''&nbsp;·&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;≡&nbsp;1 (mod ''p''), i.e., ''p'' divides the difference {{nowrap|''a'' · ''b'' − 1}}.\nThe inverse ''b'' can be found by using [[Bézout's identity]] and the fact that the [[greatest common divisor]] {{nowrap|gcd(''a'', ''p'')}} equals 1.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rosen|year = 2000|loc = p. 54 (Theorem 2.1)}}</ref> In the case {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}} above, the inverse of 4 is 4, and the inverse of 3 is 2, as {{nowrap|1=3 · 2 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)}}. Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. Actually, this example is similar to <math>\\left(\\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\left\\{0\\right\\},\\cdot\\right)</math> above: it consists of exactly those elements in <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}</math> that have a multiplicative inverse.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §VIII.1, p. 292}}</ref> These groups are denoted '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>×</sup>.

In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as\n: ..., −''a''−''a'', −''a'', 0, ''a'', ''a''+''a'', ...\n\nIn the groups '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' introduced above, the element 1 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1.  Any cyclic group with ''n'' elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of [[root of unity|''n''-th complex roots of unity]], given by [[complex number]]s ''z'' satisfying {{nowrap|1=''z''<sup>''n''</sup> = 1}}. These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular ''n''-gon, as shown in blue at the right for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with ''z'' corresponds to a [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] rotation by 60°.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.2, p. 26}}</ref> Using some [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], the group '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>×</sup> can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, 3 is a generator since {{nowrap|1=3<sup>1</sup> = 3}}, {{nowrap|1=3<sup>2</sup> = 9 ≡ 4}}, {{nowrap|3<sup>3</sup> ≡ 2}}, and {{nowrap|3<sup>4</sup> ≡ 1}}.\n\nSome cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements.  In these groups, for every non-zero element ''a'', all the powers of ''a'' are distinct; despite the name \"cyclic group\", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}, the group of integers under addition introduced above.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22 (example 11)}}</ref> As these two prototypes are both abelian, so is any cyclic group.\n\nThe study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as [[Center (group theory)|center]] and [[commutator]], describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.5, p. 26, 29}}</ref>\n\n===Symmetry groups===\n{{Main|Symmetry group}}\n{{see also|Molecular symmetry|Space group|Symmetry in physics}}\n''Symmetry groups'' are groups consisting of [[symmetry|symmetries]] of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as [[polynomial equation]]s and their solutions.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Weyl|year = 1952}}</ref> Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.{{cref|t}} [[Symmetry in mathematics|Symmetries in mathematics]] greatly simplify the study of [[geometry|geometrical]] or [[analysis|analytical objects]]. A group is said to [[Group action (mathematics)|act]] on another mathematical object ''X'' if every group element performs some operation on ''X'' compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.\n\n[[Image:Sixteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|right|thumb|200px|Rotations and reflections form the symmetry group of a [[great icosahedron]].]]\nIn chemical fields, such as [[crystallography]], [[space group]]s and [[point group]]s describe [[molecular symmetry|molecular symmetries]] and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] analysis of these properties.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Conway|last2= Delgado Friedrichs|last3 = Huson|last4 = Thurston|year = 2001}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Bishop|year = 1993}}</ref> For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.\n\nNot only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The [[Jahn-Teller effect]] is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.<ref name=Bersuker>{{citation |title=The Jahn-Teller Effect |first= Isaac |last= Bersuker |page=2 |isbn=0-521-82212-2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006  }}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Jahn|last2=Teller|year = 1937}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a [[phase transition]], for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is [[ferroelectric]] materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the [[Curie temperature]] and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft [[phonon]] mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.<ref name=Dove>{{citation |title=Structure and Dynamics: an atomic view of materials |first=Martin T|last= Dove |page=265 |isbn=0-19-850678-3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003  }}</ref>\n\nSuch [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of [[Goldstone boson]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n|width=15%| [[Image:C60a.png|125px]]\n|width=20%| [[Image:Ammonia-3D-balls-A.png|125px]]\n|width=14%| [[Image:Cubane-3D-balls.png|125px]]\n|width=36%| [[Image:Hexaaquacopper(II)-3D-balls.png|125px]]\n|width=15%| [[Image:Uniform tiling 73-t2 colored.png|125px]]\n|-\n| [[Buckminsterfullerene]] displays<br />[[icosahedral symmetry]], though the double bonds reduce this to [[pyritohedral symmetry]].\n|[[Ammonia]], [[nitrogen|N]][[hydrogen|H<sub>3</sub>]].

The number of elements is called the [[order (group theory)|order]] of the group.<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Kurzweil|last2= Stellmacher|year = 2004}}</ref>  An important class is the ''[[symmetric group]]s'' S<sub>''N''</sub>, the groups of [[permutation]]s of ''N'' letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters [[dihedral group of order 6|S<sub>3</sub>]] is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ''ABC'', i.e., contains the elements ''ABC'', ''ACB'', ''BAC'', ''BCA'', ''CAB'', ''CBA'', in total 6 ([[factorial]] of 3) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group S<sub>''N''</sub> for a suitable integer ''N'', according to [[Cayley's theorem]]. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S<sub>3</sub> can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]].\n\nThe order of an element ''a'' in a group ''G'' is the least positive integer ''n'' such that ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''e'', where ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> represents\n\n: <math>\\underbrace{a \\cdots a}_{n \\text{ factors}},</math>\n\ni.e., application of the operation • to ''n'' copies of ''a''. (If • represents multiplication, then ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> corresponds to the ''n''th power of ''a''.) In infinite groups, such an ''n'' may not exist, in which case the order of ''a'' is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.\n\nMore sophisticated counting techniques, for example counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's Theorem]] states that for a finite group ''G'' the order of any finite subgroup ''H'' [[divisor|divides]] the order of ''G''. The [[Sylow theorems]] give a partial converse.\n\nThe [[dihedral group]] (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8. The order of r<sub>1</sub> is 4, as is the order of the subgroup ''R'' it generates (see above). The order of the reflection elements f<sub>v</sub> etc. is 2.

The [[natural number]]s '''N''' (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as {{nowrap|('''Q''' ∖ {0}, ·)}} is derived from {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, known as the [[Grothendieck group]].\n[[Groupoid]]s are similar to groups except that the composition {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} need not be defined for all ''a'' and ''b''. They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in [[topology|topological]] and [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] structures, such as the [[fundamental groupoid]] or [[stack (mathematics)|stacks]]. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary [[arity|''n''-ary]] one (i.e., an operation taking ''n'' arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Dudek|year = 2001}}</ref> The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of group theory topics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{clear}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}<span class=\"small\">\n{{cnote|a|[[Mathematical Reviews]] lists 3,224 research papers on group theory and its generalizations written in 2005.}}\n{{cnote|aa|The classification was announced in 1983, but gaps were found in the proof.

We write ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' to indicate that ''f'' is an element of ''G''(''x'',''y'').\n* For every object ''x'', a designated element <math>\\mathrm{id}_x</math> of ''G''(''x'',''x'');\n* For each triple of objects ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>\\mathrm{comp}_{x,y,z} : G(y, z)\\times G(x, y) \\rightarrow G(x, z): (g, f) \\mapsto gf</math>;\n* For each pair of objects ''x'', ''y'' a function <math>\\mathrm{inv}: G(x, y) \\rightarrow G(y, x): f \\mapsto f^{-1}</math>;\n\nsatisfying, for any ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'', ''g'' : ''y'' → ''z'', and ''h'' : ''z'' → ''w'':\n* <math>f\\ \\mathrm{id}_x = f</math> and <math>\\mathrm{id}_y\\ f = f</math>;\n* <math>(h g) f = h (g f)</math>;\n* <math>f f^{-1} = \\mathrm{id}_y</math> and <math>f^{-1} f = \\mathrm{id}_x</math>.\n\nIf ''f'' is an element of ''G''(''x'',''y'') then ''x'' is called the '''source''' of ''f'', written ''s''(''f''), and ''y'' the '''target''' of ''f'' (written ''t''(''f'')).\n\nMore generally, one can consider a [[groupoid object]] in an arbitrary category admitting finite fiber products.\n\n===Comparing the definitions===\nThe algebraic and category-theoretic definitions are equivalent, as follows. Given a groupoid in the category-theoretic sense, let ''G'' be the [[disjoint union]] of all of the sets ''G''(''x'',''y'') (i.e. the sets of morphisms from ''x'' to ''y'').\n\nThen <math>\\mathrm{comp}</math> and <math>\\mathrm{inv}</math> become partially defined operations on ''G'', and <math>\\mathrm{inv}</math> will in fact be defined everywhere; so we define ∗ <!--this is Unicode character U+2217, and should look similar to <math>*</math>--> to be <math>\\mathrm{comp}</math> and <sup>−1</sup> to be <math>\\mathrm{inv}</math>. Thus we have a groupoid in the algebraic sense. Explicit reference to ''G''<sub>0</sub> (and hence to <math>\\mathrm{id}</math>) can be dropped.\n\nConversely, given a groupoid ''G'' in the algebraic sense, and define an equivalence relation <math>\\sim</math> between its elements as\n<math>a\\sim b</math> if  ''a'' ∗ ''a''<sup>−1</sup> =  ''b'' ∗ ''b''<sup>−1</sup>. \n\nLet ''G''<sub>0</sub> be the set of equivalence classes of <math>\\sim</math>, that is, <math>G_0:=G/\\sim</math>. Denote  ''a'' ∗ ''a''<sup>−1</sup> with <math>1_x</math> if <math>a\\in x</math> with <math>x\\in G_0</math>.\n\nDefine\n\n<math>G(x, y)</math>\n\nas the set of all elements ''f'' such that\n\n:<math>1_x*f*1_y</math>\n\nexists. Given\n\n:<math>f \\in G(x,y) \\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad \ng \\in G(y, z)</math>,\n\ntheir composite is defined as\n\n:<math>gf:=f*g \\in G(x,z)</math>.\n\nTo see this is well defined, observe that since\n\n: <math>(1_x*f)*1_y</math> and <math>1_y*(g*1_z)</math>\n\nexist, so does\n\n:<math>(1_x*f*1_y)*(g*1_z)=f*g</math>.\n\nThe identity morphism on ''x'' is then <math>1_x</math>, and the category-theoretic inverse of ''f'' is ''f''<sup>−1</sup>.\n\n''Sets'' in the definitions above may be replaced with [[class (set theory)|class]]es, as is generally the case in [[category theory]].\n\n===Vertex groups===\nGiven a groupoid ''G'', the '''vertex groups''' or '''isotropy groups''' or '''object groups''' in ''G'' are the subsets of the form ''G''(''x'',''x''), where ''x'' is any object of ''G''.  It follows easily from the axioms above that these are indeed groups, as every pair of elements is composable and inverses are in the same vertex group.\n\n===Category of groupoids===\nA '''subgroupoid''' is a [[subcategory]] that is itself a groupoid. A '''groupoid morphism''' is simply a functor between two (category-theoretic) groupoids. The category whose objects are groupoids and whose morphisms are groupoid morphisms is called the '''groupoid category''', or the '''category of groupoids''', denoted '''Grpd'''.\n\nIt is useful that this category is, like the category of small categories,  [[Cartesian closed]]. That is, we can construct  for any groupoids <math>H,K</math> a groupoid  C<math>\\operatorname{GPD}(H,K)</math> whose objects are the morphisms <math> H \\to K </math> and whose arrows are the natural equivalences  of morphisms. Thus if <math> H,K </math> are just groups, then such arrows are the conjugacies of morphisms. The main result is that for any groupoids <math> G,H,K </math> there is a natural bijection\n\n<math>\\operatorname{Grpd}(G \\times H, K) \\cong \\operatorname{Grpd}(G, \\operatorname{GPD}(H,K)).</math>\n\nThis result is of interest even if all the groupoids <math> G,H,K </math> are just groups.\n\n===Fibrations and coverings===\nParticular kinds of morphisms of groupoids are of interest. A morphism <math>p: E \\to B</math> of groupoids is called a [[fibration]] if for each object <math>x</math> of <math>E</math> and each morphism <math>b</math> of <math>B</math> starting at <math>p(x)</math> there is a morphism <math>e</math> of <math>E</math> starting at <math>x</math>  such that <math>p(e)=b</math>. A fibration is called a [[covering morphism]] or [[covering of groupoids]] if further such an <math>e</math> is unique. The covering morphisms of groupoids are especially useful because they can be used to model [[covering map]]s of spaces.<ref>J.P. May, ''A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology'', 1999, The University of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-51183-9}} (''see chapter 2'')</ref>\n\nIt is also true that the category of covering morphisms of a given groupoid <math>B</math> is equivalent to the category of actions of the groupoid <math>B</math> on sets.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Linear algebra===\nGiven a [[field (algebra)|field]] ''K'', the corresponding '''general linear groupoid''' ''GL''<sub>*</sub>(''K'') consists of all [[matrix inversion|invertible]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], of any size, whose entries range over ''K''. [[Matrix multiplication]] interprets composition. If ''G'' = ''GL''<sub>*</sub>(''K''), then the set of [[natural number]]s is a [[proper subset]] of ''G''<sub>0</sub>, since for each [[natural number]] ''n'', there is a corresponding [[identity matrix]] of dimension ''n''.  ''G''(''m'',''n'') is [[empty set|empty]] unless ''m''=''n'', in which case it is the set of all ''n''x''n'' invertible matrices.\n\n===Topology===\n{{Main|Fundamental groupoid}}\nGiven a [[topological space]] <math>X</math>, let <math>G_0</math> be the set <math>X</math>. The morphisms from the point <math>p</math> to the point <math>q</math> are [[equivalence class]]es of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[path (topology)|path]]s from <math>p</math> to <math>q</math>, with two paths being equivalent if they are [[homotopic]].\nTwo such morphisms are composed by first following the first path, then the second; the homotopy equivalence guarantees that this composition is [[associative]]. This groupoid is called the [[fundamental groupoid]] of <math>X</math>, denoted <math>\\pi_1(X)</math> (or sometimes, <math>\\Pi_1(X)</math>).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fundamental+groupoid|title=fundamental groupoid in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}</ref>  The usual fundamental group <math>\\pi_1(X,x)</math> is then the vertex group for the point <math>x</math>.\n\nAn important extension of this idea is to consider the fundamental groupoid <math>\\pi_1(X,A)</math> where <math>A\\subset X</math> is a chosen set of \"base points\". Here, one considers only paths whose endpoints belong to <math>A</math>. <math>\\pi_1(X,A)</math> is a sub-groupoid of <math>\\pi_1(X)</math>. The set <math>A</math> may be chosen according to the geometry of the situation at hand.\n\n===Equivalence relation===\nIf <math>X</math> is a set with an [[equivalence relation]] denoted by [[infix]] <math>\\sim</math>, then a groupoid \"representing\" this equivalence relation can be formed as follows:\n* The objects of the groupoid are the elements of <math>X</math>;\n*For any two elements <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>X</math>, there is a single morphism from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math> [[if and only if]] <math>x\\sim y</math>.\n\n===Group action===\nIf the [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>G</math> acts on the set <math>X</math>, then we can form the '''action groupoid''' (or '''transformation groupoid''') representing this [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] as follows:\n*The objects are the elements of <math>X</math>;\n*For any two elements <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>X</math>, the [[morphism]]s from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math> correspond to the elements <math>g</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>gx = y</math>;\n*[[Function composition|Composition]] of morphisms interprets the [[binary operation]] of <math>G</math>.\n\nMore explicitly, the ''action groupoid'' is a small category with  <math>\\mathrm{ob}(C)=X</math> and <math>\\mathrm{hom}(C)=G\\times X</math> with source and target maps <math>s(g,x) = x</math> and <math>t(g,x) = gx</math>.  It is often denoted <math>G \\ltimes X</math> (or <math>X\\rtimes G</math>). Multiplication (or composition) in the groupoid is then <math>(h,y)(g,x) = (hg,x)</math> which is defined provided <math>y=gx</math>.\n\nFor <math>x</math> in <math>X</math>, the vertex group consists of those <math>(g,x)</math> with <math>gx=x</math>, which is just the isotropy subgroup at <math>x</math> for the given action (which is why vertex groups are also called isotropy groups).\n\nAnother way to describe <math>G</math>-sets is the [[functor category]] <math>[\\mathrm{Gr},\\mathrm{Set}]</math>, where <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math> is the groupoid (category) with one element and [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group <math>G</math>. Indeed, every functor <math>F</math> of this category defines a set <math>X=F(\\mathrm{Gr})</math> and for every <math>g</math> in <math>G</math> (i.e. for every morphism in <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math>) induces a [[bijection]] <math>F_g</math> : <math>X\\to X</math>. The categorical structure of the functor <math>F</math> assures us that <math>F</math> defines a <math>G</math>-action on the set <math>G</math>. The (unique) [[representable functor]] <math>F</math> : <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math>→<math>\\mathrm{Set}</math> is the [[Cayley's theorem|Cayley representation]] of <math>G</math>. In fact, this functor is isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathrm{Gr},-)</math> and so sends <math>\\mathrm{ob}(\\mathrm{Gr})</math> to the set <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathrm{Gr},\\mathrm{Gr})</math> which is by definition the \"set\" <math>G</math> and the morphism <math>g</math> of <math>\\mathrm{Gr}</math> (i.e. the element <math>g</math> of <math>G</math>) to the permutation <math>F_g</math> of the set <math>G</math>. We deduce from the [[Yoneda embedding]] that the group <math>G</math> is isomorphic to the group <math>{F_g\\mid g\\in G}</math>, a [[subgroup]] of the group of [[permutation group|permutation]]s of <math>G</math>.\n\n===Fifteen puzzle===\n\nThe transformations of the [[fifteen puzzle]] form a groupoid (not a group, as not all moves can be composed).<ref>Jim Belk (2008) [https://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/puzzles-groups-and-groupoids/ Puzzles, Groups, and Groupoids], The Everything Seminar</ref><ref>[http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-15-puzzle-groupoid-1 The 15-puzzle groupoid (1)], Never Ending Books</ref><ref>[http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-15-puzzle-groupoid-2 The 15-puzzle groupoid (2)], Never Ending Books</ref> This [[Group action (mathematics)#Variants_and_generalizations|groupoid acts]] on configurations.\n\n===Mathieu groupoid===\n\nThe [[Mathieu groupoid]] is a groupoid introduced by [[John Horton Conway]] acting on 13 points such that the elements fixing a point form a copy of the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>12</sub>.\n\n== Relation to groups ==\n{{Group-like structures}}\nIf a groupoid has only one object, then the set of its morphisms forms a [[group (algebra)|group]]. Using the algebraic definition, such a groupoid is literally just a group.<ref>Mapping a group to the corresponding groupoid with one object is sometimes called delooping, especially in the context of [[Homotopy|homotopy theory]], see {{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/delooping#delooping_of_a_group_to_a_groupoid|title=delooping in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}.</ref> Many concepts of [[group theory]] generalize to groupoids, with the notion of [[functor]] replacing that of [[group homomorphism]].\n\nIf <math>x</math> is an object of the groupoid <math>G</math>, then the set of all morphisms from <math>x</math> to <math>x</math> forms a group <math>G(x)</math> (called the vertex group, defined above). If there is a morphism <math>f</math> from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math>, then the groups <math>G(x)</math> and <math>G(y)</math> are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]], with an isomorphism given by the [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] <math>g\\to fgf^{-1}</math>.\n\nEvery [[connected (category theory)|connected]] groupoid - that is, one in which any two objects are connected by at least one morphism - is isomorphic to an action groupoid (as defined above) <math>(G, X)</math>. By connectedness, there will only be one [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] under the action. If the groupoid is not connected, then it is isomorphic to a [[disjoint union]] of groupoids of the above type (possibly with different groups <math>G</math> and sets <math>X</math> for each connected component).\n\nNote that the isomorphism described above is not unique, and there is no [[natural equivalence|natural]] choice. Choosing such an isomorphism for a connected groupoid essentially amounts to picking one object <math>x_0</math>, a [[group isomorphism]] <math>h</math> from <math>G(x_0)</math> to <math>G</math>, and for each <math>x</math> other than <math>x_0</math>, a morphism in <math>G</math> from <math>x_0</math> to <math>x</math>.\n\nIn category-theoretic terms, each connected component of a groupoid is [[equivalent categories|equivalent]] (but not [[isomorphic categories|isomorphic]]) to a groupoid with a single object, that is, a single group. Thus any groupoid is equivalent to a [[multiset]] of unrelated groups. In other words, for equivalence instead of isomorphism, one need not specify the sets <math>X</math>, only the groups <math>G</math>.\n\nConsider the examples in the previous section. The general linear groupoid is both equivalent and isomorphic to the disjoint union of the various [[general linear group]]s <math>GL_n(F)</math>. On the other hand:\n*The fundamental groupoid of <math>X</math> is equivalent to the collection of the [[fundamental group]]s of each [[path-connected component]] of <math>X</math>, but an isomorphism requires specifying the set of points in each component;\n*The set <math>X</math> with the equivalence relation <math>\\sim</math> is equivalent (as a groupoid) to one copy of the [[trivial group]] for each [[equivalence class]], but an isomorphism requires specifying what each equivalence class is:\n*The set <math>X</math> equipped with an [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the group <math>G</math> is equivalent (as a groupoid) to one copy of <math>G</math> for each [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of the action, but an [[isomorphism]] requires specifying what set each orbit is.\n\nThe collapse of a groupoid into a mere collection of groups loses some information, even from a category-theoretic point of view, because it is not [[natural (category theory)|natural]]. Thus when groupoids arise in terms of other structures, as in the above examples, it can be helpful to maintain the full groupoid. Otherwise, one must choose a way to view each <math>G(x)</math> in terms of a single group, and this choice can be arbitrary. In our example from [[topology]], you would have to make a coherent choice of paths (or equivalence classes of paths) from each point <math>p</math> to each point <math>q</math> in the same path-connected component.\n\nAs a more illuminating example, the classification of groupoids with one [[endomorphism]] does not reduce to purely group theoretic considerations. This is analogous to the fact that the classification of [[vector space]]s with one endomorphism is nontrivial.\n\nMorphisms of groupoids come in more kinds than those of groups: we have, for example,  [[fibration]]s, [[covering morphism]]s, [[universal morphism]]s, and [[quotient morphism]]s. Thus a subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> yields an action of <math>G</math> on the set of [[coset]]s of <math>H</math> in <math>G</math> and hence a covering morphism <math>p</math> from, say, <math>K</math> to <math>G</math>, where <math>K</math> is a groupoid with [[#Vertex groups|vertex group]]s isomorphic to <math>H</math>. In this way, presentations of the group <math>G</math> can be \"lifted\" to presentations of the groupoid <math>K</math>, and this is a useful way of obtaining information about presentations of the subgroup <math>H</math>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Hardy field''' is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] consisting of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of [[real-valued function]]s at infinity that is closed under [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]].  They are named after the English mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nInitially at least, Hardy fields were defined in terms of germs of real functions at infinity.  Specifically we consider a collection ''H'' of functions that are defined for all large real numbers, that is functions ''f'' that map (''u'',∞) to the real numbers '''R''', where ''u'' is some real number depending on ''f''.  Here and in the rest of the article we say a function has a property \"[[Eventually (mathematics)|eventually]]\" if it has the property for all sufficiently large ''x'', so for example we say a function ''f'' in ''H'' is ''eventually zero'' if there is some real number ''U'' such that ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for all ''x''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''U''.  We can form an [[equivalence relation]] on ''H'' by saying ''f'' is equivalent to ''g'' if and only if ''f''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''g'' is eventually zero.  The equivalence classes of this relation are called germs at infinity.\n\nIf ''H'' forms a field under the usual addition and multiplication of functions then so will ''H'' modulo this equivalence relation under the induced addition and multiplication operations.  Moreover, if every function in ''H'' is eventually differentiable and the derivative of any function in ''H'' is also in ''H'' then ''H'' modulo the above equivalence relation is called a Hardy field.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Boshernitzan | first1=Michael | title=Hardy fields and existence of transexponential functions | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f853371068v83301/ | year=1986 | journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]] | doi=10.1007/BF02189932 | volume=30 | number=1 | pages=258&ndash;280}}</ref>\n\nElements of a Hardy field are thus equivalence classes and should be denoted, say, [''f'']<sub>∞</sub> to denote the class of functions that are eventually equal to the representative function ''f''.  However, in practice the elements are normally just denoted by the representatives themselves, so instead of [''f'']<sub>∞</sub> one would just write ''f''.\n\n==Examples==\n\nIf ''F'' is a [[Field extension|subfield]] of '''R''' then we can consider it as a Hardy field by considering the elements of ''F'' as constant functions, that is by considering the number α in ''F'' as the constant function ''f''<sub>α</sub> that maps every ''x'' in '''R''' to α.  This is a field since ''F'' is, and since the derivative of every function in this field is 0 which must be in ''F'' it is a Hardy field.\n\nA less trivial example of a Hardy field is the field of [[rational function]]s on '''R''', denoted '''R'''(''x'').  This is the set of functions of the form ''P''(''x'')/''Q''(''x'') where ''P'' and ''Q'' are polynomials with real coefficients.  Since the polynomial ''Q'' can have only finitely many zeros by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], such a rational function will be defined for all sufficiently large ''x'', specifically for all ''x'' larger than the largest real root of ''Q''.  Adding and multiplying rational functions gives more rational functions, and the [[quotient rule]] shows that the derivative of rational function is again a rational function, so '''R'''(''x'') forms a Hardy field.\n\nAnother example is the field of functions that can be expressed using the standard arithmetic operations, exponents, and logarithms, and are well-defined on some interval of the form <math>(x,\\infty)</math>.<ref> G. H. Hardy, ''Properties of Logarithmico-Exponential Functions'', Proc. London Math. Soc. (2), 54-90, '''10''', 1911 </ref> Such functions are sometimes called ''Hardy L-functions''.  Much bigger Hardy fields (that contain Hardy L-functions as a subfield) can be defined using [[transseries]].\n\n==Properties==\n\nAny element of a Hardy field is eventually either strictly positive, strictly negative, or zero.  This follows fairly immediately from the facts that the elements in a Hardy field are eventually differentiable and hence [[Continuous function|continuous]] and eventually either have a multiplicative inverse or are zero.  This means periodic functions such as the sine and cosine functions cannot exist in Hardy fields.\n\nThis avoidance of periodic functions also means that every element in a Hardy field has a (possibly infinite) limit at infinity, so if ''f'' is an element of ''H'', then\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\rightarrow\\infty}f(x)</math>\nexists in '''R'''&nbsp;∪&nbsp;{&minus;∞,+∞}.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Rosenlicht | first1=Maxwell | title=The Rank of a Hardy Field | jstor=1999639 | year=1983 | journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society | volume=280 | number=2 | pages=659&ndash;671 | doi=10.2307/1999639}}</ref>\n\nIt also means we can place an [[Total order|ordering]] on ''H'' by saying ''f''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''g'' if ''g''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''f'' is eventually strictly positive.  Note that this is not the same as stating that ''f''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''g'' if the limit of ''f'' is less than the limit of ''g''.  For example, if we consider the germs of the identity function ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' and the exponential function ''g''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''e''<sup>''x''</sup> then since ''g''(''x'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''f''(''x'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 for all ''x'' we have that ''g''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''f''.  But they both tend to infinity.  In this sense the ordering tells us how quickly all the unbounded functions diverge to infinity.\n\n==In model theory==\n\nThe modern theory of Hardy fields doesn't restrict to real functions but to those defined in certain structures expanding [[real closed field]]s.  Indeed, if ''R'' is an [[o-minimal theory|o-minimal]] expansion of a field, then the set of unary definable functions in ''R'' that are defined for all sufficiently large elements forms a Hardy field denoted ''H''(''R'').<ref>{{Citation | last1=Kuhlmann | first1=Franz-Viktor | last2=Kuhlmann | first2=Salma | title=Valuation theory of exponential Hardy fields I | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/jbkltyacb2mfq10w/ | year=2003 | journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift | doi=10.1007/s00209-002-0460-4 | volume=243 | number=4 | pages=671&ndash;688}}</ref>  The properties of Hardy fields in the real setting still hold in this more general setting.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Asymptotic analysis]]\n[[Category:Model theory]]\n[[Category:Field theory]]\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]"

The elements of the heap may be identified with the morphisms from A to B, such that three morphisms x, y, z define a heap operation according to: \n:<math>[x,y,z] = x y^{-1} z . </math>\nThis reduces to the heap of a group if a particular morphism between the two objects is chosen as the identity.

Conversely, let ''H'' be a heap, and choose an element {{nowrap|''e'' ∈ ''H''}}.

      "text": "{{redirect|Ideal Product|products named \"Ideal\"|Ideal (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[ring theory]], a branch of [[abstract algebra]], an '''ideal''' is a special [[subset]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Ideals generalize certain subsets of the [[integer]]s, such as the [[even numbers]] or the multiples of 3. Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number;  these [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal.  An ideal can be used to construct a [[quotient ring]] similarly to the way that, in [[group theory]], a [[normal subgroup]] can be used to construct a [[quotient group]].\n\nAmong the integers, the ideals correspond one-for-one with the [[non-negative integer]]s: in this ring, every ideal is a [[principal ideal]] consisting of the multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, the ideals may be distinct from the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring. For instance, the [[prime ideal]]s of a ring are analogous to [[prime number]]s, and the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] can be generalized to ideals.  There is a version of [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique prime factorization]] for the ideals of a [[Dedekind domain]] (a type of ring important in [[number theory]]).\n\nThe concept of an [[order ideal]] in [[order theory]] is derived from the notion of ideal in ring theory. A [[fractional ideal]] is a generalization of an ideal, and the usual ideals are sometimes called '''integral ideals''' for clarity.\n\n== History ==\nIdeals were first proposed by [[Richard Dedekind]] in 1876 in the third edition of his book ''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' (English: ''Lectures on Number Theory''). They were a generalization of the concept of [[ideal number]]s developed by [[Ernst Kummer]].<ref name=\"flt\">{{cite book\n| author = Harold M. Edwards\n| title = Fermat's last theorem. A genetic introduction to algebraic number theory\n| year = 1977\n| page = 76\n}}</ref><ref name=\"everest_ward\">{{cite book\n| author = Everest G., Ward T.\n| title = An introduction to number theory\n| year = 2005\n| page = 83\n}}</ref>  Later the concept was expanded by [[David Hilbert]] and especially [[Emmy Noether]].\n\n== Definitions and motivation ==\nFor an arbitrary ring <math>(R,+,\\cdot)</math>, let <math>(R,+)</math> be its [[additive group]]. A subset <math>I</math> is called a '''left ideal''' of <math>R</math> if it is an additive subgroup of <math>R</math> that \"absorbs multiplication from the left by elements of <math>R</math>\"; that is, <math>I</math> is a '''left ideal''' if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n# <math>(I,+)</math> is a [[subgroup]] of <math>(R,+),</math>\n# For every <math>r \\in R</math> and every <math>x \\in I</math>, the product <math>r x</math> is in <math>I</math>.\n\nA '''right ideal''' is defined with the condition \"''r x'' ∈ ''I''\" replaced by \"''x r'' ∈ ''I''. A '''two-sided ideal''' is a left ideal that is also a right ideal, and is sometimes simply called an ideal.  \nWe can view a left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal of ''R'' as a left (resp. right, bi-) ''R''-[[module (mathematics)#Submodules and homomorphisms|submodule]] of ''R'' viewed as an ''R''-module.  When ''R'' is a commutative ring, the definitions of left, right, and two-sided ideal coincide, and the term '''ideal''' is used alone.\n\nTo understand the concept of an ideal, consider how ideals arise in the construction of rings of \"elements modulo\".  For concreteness, let us look at the ring ℤ<sub>''n''</sub> of integers modulo a given integer ''n'' ∈ ℤ (note that ℤ is a commutative ring).  The key observation here is that we obtain ℤ<sub>''n''</sub> by taking ℤ and wrapping it around itself so that ''n'' gets identified with 0 (since ''n'' is congruent to 0 modulo ''n'').  However, when doing so we must ensure that the resulting structure is again a ring.  This requirement forces us to make some additional identifications.  The notion of an ideal arises when we ask the question: <blockquote>What is the exact set of integers that we are forced to identify with 0?</blockquote>  The answer is the set ''n''ℤ = {''nm'' | ''m''∈ℤ} of all integers congruent to 0 modulo ''n''.  That is, we must wrap ℤ around itself infinitely many times so that the integers ..., ''n ⋅ -2'', ''n ⋅ -1'', ''n ⋅ +1'', ''n ⋅ +2'', ... will all align with 0.  If we look at what properties this set must satisfy in order to ensure that ℤ<sub>''n''</sub> is a ring, then we arrive at the definition of an ideal.  Indeed, one can directly verify that ''n''ℤ is an ideal of ℤ.\n\n'''Remark.''' Identifications with elements other than 0 also need to be made.  For example, the elements in 1 + ''n''ℤ must be identified with 1, the elements in 2 + ''n''ℤ must be identified with 2, and so on.  Those, however, are uniquely determined by ''n''ℤ since ''ℤ'' is an additive group.\n\nWe can make a similar construction in any commutative ring ''R'': start with an arbitrary ''x'' ∈ ''R'', and then identify with 0 all elements of the ideal ''xR'' = { ''x r'' : ''r'' ∈ ''R'' }.  It turns out that the ideal ''xR'' is the smallest ideal that contains ''x'', called the ideal '''generated''' by ''x''.  More generally, we can  start with an arbitrary subset ''S'' ⊆ ''R'', and then identify with 0 all the elements in the ideal generated by ''S'': the smallest ideal (''S'') such that ''S'' ⊆ (''S'').  The ring that we obtain after the identification depends only on the ideal (''S'') and not on the set ''S'' that we started with.  That is, if (''S'') = (''T''), then the resulting rings will be the same.\n\nTherefore, an ideal ''I'' of a commutative ring ''R'' captures canonically the information needed to obtain the ring of elements of ''R'' modulo a given subset ''S'' ⊆ ''R''.  The elements of ''I'', by definition, are those that are congruent to zero, that is, identified with zero in the resulting ring.  The resulting ring is called the '''[[quotient ring|quotient]]''' of ''R'' by ''I'' and is denoted ''R/I''.  Intuitively, the definition of an ideal postulates two natural conditions necessary for ''I'' to contain all elements designated as \"zeroes\" by ''R/I'':\n# ''I'' is an additive subgroup of ''R'': the zero 0 of ''R'' is a \"zero\" 0 ∈ ''I'', and if ''x''<sub>1</sub>'' ∈ ''I'' and ''x''<sub>2</sub>'' ∈ ''I'' are \"zeros\", then ''x''<sub>1</sub>'' - ''x''<sub>2</sub>'' ∈ ''I'' is a \"zero\" too.\n# Any ''r'' ∈ ''R'' multiplied by a \"zero\" ''x'' ∈ ''I'' is a \"zero\" ''rx'' ∈ ''I''.\nIt turns out that the above conditions are also sufficient for ''I'' to contain all the necessary \"zeroes\": no other elements have to be designated as \"zero\" in order to form ''R/I''.  (In fact, no other elements should be designated as \"zero\" if we want to make the least amount of identifications.)\n\n'''Remark.''' If ''R'' is not necessarily commutative, the above construction still works using two-sided ideals.\n\n== Examples and properties ==\n''For the sake of succinctness, some results are stated only for left ideals but are usually also true for right ideals with appropriate notation changes.''\n* In a ring ''R'', the set ''R'' itself forms a two-sided ideal of ''R'' called the '''unit ideal'''. It is often also denoted by <math>(1)</math> since it is precisely the two-sided ideal generated (see below) by the unity <math>1_R</math>. Also, the set <math>\\{ 0_R \\}</math> consisting of only the additive identity 0<sub>''R''</sub> forms a two-sided ideal called the '''zero ideal''' and is denoted by <math>(0)</math>.<ref group=note>Some authors call the zero and unit ideals of a ring ''R'' the '''trivial ideals''' of ''R''.</ref> Every (left, right or two-sided) ideal contains the zero ideal and is contained in the unit ideal.\n* A (left, right or two-sided) ideal that is not the unit ideal is called a '''proper ideal''' (as it is a [[proper subset]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|2005|loc=Section III.2}}</ref> Note: a left ideal <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is proper if and only if it does not contain a unit element, since if <math>u \\in \\mathfrak{a}</math> is a unit element, then <math>r = (r u^{-1}) u \\in \\mathfrak{a}</math> for every <math>r \\in R</math>. Typically there are plenty of proper ideals. In fact, if ''R'' is a [[skew-field]], then <math>(0), (1)</math> are its only ideals and conversely: that is, a nonzero ring ''R'' is a skew-field if <math>(0), (1)</math> are the only left (or right) ideals. (Proof: if <math>x</math> is a nonzero element, then the principal left ideal <math>Rx</math> (see below) is nonzero and thus <math>Rx = (1)</math>; i.e., <math>yx = 1</math> for some nonzero <math>y</math>. Likewise, <math>zy = 1</math> for some nonzero <math>z</math>. Then <math>z = z(yx) = (zy)x = x</math>.)\n* The even [[integer]]s form an ideal in the ring <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of all integers; it is usually denoted by <math>2\\mathbb{Z}</math>. This is because the sum of any even integers is even, and the product of any integer with an even integer is also even. Similarly, the set of all integers divisible by a fixed integer ''n'' is an ideal denoted <math>n\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n* The set of all [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients which are divisible by the polynomial ''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 is an ideal in the ring of all polynomials.\n* The set of all ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] whose last row is zero forms a right ideal in the ring of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices. It is not a left ideal. The set of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices whose last ''column'' is zero forms a left ideal but not a right ideal.\n* The ring <math>C(\\mathbb{R})</math> of all [[continuous function]]s ''f'' from <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> to <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> under [[pointwise multiplication]] contains the ideal of all continuous functions ''f'' such that ''f''(1) = 0. Another ideal in <math>C(\\mathbb{R})</math> is given by those functions which vanish for large enough arguments, i.e. those continuous functions ''f'' for which there exists a number ''L'' > 0 such that ''f''(''x'') = 0 whenever |''x''| > ''L''.\n* A ring is called a [[simple ring]] if it is nonzero and has no two-sided ideals other than <math>(0), (1)</math>. Thus, a skew-field is simple and a simple commutative ring is a field. The [[matrix ring]] over a skew-field is a simple ring.\n* If <math>f: R \\to S</math> is a [[ring homomorphism]], then the kernel <math>\\ker(f) = f^{-1}(0_S)</math> is a two-sided ideal of <math>R</math>. By convention, <math>f(1_R) = 1_S</math> and thus if <math>S \\ne 0</math>, then <math>\\ker(f)</math> is a proper ideal. More generally, for each left ideal ''I'' of ''S'', the pre-image <math>f^{-1}(I)</math> is a left ideal. If ''I'' is a left ideal of ''R'', then <math>f(I)</math> is a left ideal of the subring <math>f(R)</math> of ''S'': unless ''f'' is surjective, <math>f(I)</math> need not be an ideal of ''S''; see also [[#Extension and contraction of an ideal]] below.\n* '''Ideal correspondence''': Given a surjective ring homomorphism <math>f: R \\to S</math>, there is a bijective order-preserving correspondence between the left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of <math>R</math> containing the kernel of <math>f</math> and the left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of <math>S</math>: the correspondence is given by <math>I \\mapsto f(I)</math> and the pre-image <math>J \\mapsto f^{-1}(J)</math>.\n* (For those who know modules) If ''M'' is a left ''R''-module and <math>S \\subset M</math> a subset, then the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] <math>\\operatorname{Ann}_R(S) = \\{ r \\in R \\mid rs = 0, s \\in S \\}</math> of ''S'' is a left ideal. Given ideals <math>\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{b}</math> of a commutative ring ''R'', the ''R''-annihilator of <math>(\\mathfrak{b} + \\mathfrak{a})/\\mathfrak{a}</math> is an ideal of ''R'' called the [[ideal quotient]] of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> by <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> and is denoted by <math>(\\mathfrak{a} : \\mathfrak{b})</math>; it is an instance of [[idealizer]] in commutative algebra.\n* Let <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i, i \\in S</math> be an '''[[ascending chain]] of left ideals''' in a ring ''R''; i.e., <math>S</math> is a totally ordered set and <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i \\subset \\mathfrak{a}_j</math> for each <math>i < j</math>. Then the union <math>\\bigcup_{i \\in S} \\mathfrak{a}_i</math> is a left ideal of ''R''. (Note: this fact remains true even if ''R'' is without the unity 1.)\n* The above fact together with [[Zorn's lemma]] proves the following: if <math>E \\subset R</math> is a possibly empty subset and <math>\\mathfrak{a}_0 \\subset R</math> is a left ideal that is disjoint from ''E'', then there is an ideal that is maximal among the ideals containing <math>\\mathfrak{a}_0</math> and disjoint from ''E''. (Again this is still valid if the ring ''R'' lacks the unity 1.) When <math>R \\ne 0</math>, taking <math>\\mathfrak{a}_0 = (0)</math> and <math>E = \\{ 1 \\}</math>, in particular, there exists a left ideal that is maximal among proper left ideals (often simply called a maximal left ideal); see [[Krull's theorem]] for more. \n*An arbitrary union of ideals need not be an ideal, but the following is still true: given a possibly empty subset ''X'' of ''R'', there is the smallest left ideal containing ''X'', called the left ideal generated by ''X'' and is denoted by <math>RX</math>. Such an ideal exists since it is the intersection of all left ideals containing ''X''. Equivalently, <math>RX</math> is the set of all the [[linear combinations|(finite) left ''R''-linear combinations]] of elements of ''X'' over ''R'':\n*:<math>RX = \\{r_1x_1+\\dots+r_nx_n \\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}, r_i\\in R, x_i\\in X\\}.</math>\n:(since such a span is the smallest left ideal containing ''X''.)<ref>If ''R'' does not have a unit, then the internal descriptions above must be modified slightly. In addition to the finite sums of products of things in ''X'' with things in ''R'', we must allow the addition of ''n''-fold sums of the form ''x''+''x''+...+''x'', and ''n''-fold sums of the form (''−x'')+(''−x'')+...+(''−x'') for every ''x'' in ''X'' and every ''n'' in the natural numbers. When ''R'' has a unit, this extra requirement becomes superfluous.</ref> A right (resp. two-sided) ideal generated by ''X'' is defined in the similar way. For \"two-sided\", one has to use linear combinations from both sides; i.e.,\n::<math>RXR = \\{r_1x_1s_1+\\dots+r_nx_ns_n \\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}, r_i\\in R,s_i\\in R, x_i\\in X\\}.\\,</math>\n*A left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal generated by a single element ''x'' is called the principal left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal generated by ''x'' and is denoted by <math>Rx</math> (resp. <math>xR, RxR</math>). The principal two-sided ideal <math>RxR</math> is often also denoted by <math>(x)</math>. If <math>X = \\{ x_1, \\dots, x_n \\}</math> is a finite set, then <math>RXR</math> is also written as <math>(x_1, \\dots, x_n)</math>.\n* In the ring <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers, every ideal can be generated by a single number (so <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> is a [[principal ideal domain]]), as a consequence of [[Euclidean division]] (or some other way).\n*There is a bijective correspondence between ideals and [[congruence relation]]s (equivalence relations that respect the ring structure) on the ring: Given an ideal ''I'' of a ring ''R'', let ''x'' ~ ''y'' if ''x'' − ''y'' ∈ ''I''.  Then ~ is a congruence relation on ''R''. Conversely, given a congruence relation ~ on ''R'', let ''I'' = {''x'' : ''x'' ~ 0}.  Then ''I'' is an ideal of ''R''.\n\n== Types of ideals ==\n''To simplify the description all rings are assumed to be commutative. The non-commutative case is discussed in detail in the respective articles.''\n\nIdeals are important because they appear as kernels of ring homomorphisms and allow one to define [[factor ring]]s. Different types of ideals are studied because they can be used to construct different types of factor rings.\n\n* '''[[Maximal ideal]]''': A proper ideal ''I'' is called a '''maximal ideal''' if there exists no other proper ideal ''J'' with ''I'' a proper subset of ''J''.  The factor ring of a maximal ideal is a [[simple ring]] in general and is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] for commutative rings.<ref>Because simple commutative rings are fields. See {{cite book|author=Lam|year=2001|title=A First Course in Noncommutative Rings|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=f15FyZuZ3-4C|page=39|text=simple commutative rings}}|page=39}}</ref>\n* '''[[Minimal ideal]]''': A nonzero ideal is called minimal if it contains no other nonzero ideal.\n* '''[[Prime ideal]]''': A proper ideal ''I'' is called a '''prime ideal''' if for any ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', if ''ab'' is in ''I'', then at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' is in ''I''. The factor ring of a prime ideal is a [[prime ring]] in general and is an [[integral domain]] for commutative rings.\n* '''[[Radical of an ideal|Radical ideal]]''' or [[semiprime ideal]]: A proper ideal ''I'' is called '''radical''' or '''semiprime''' if for any ''a'' in ''R'', if ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> is in ''I'' for some ''n'', then ''a'' is in ''I''. The factor ring of a radical ideal is a [[semiprime ring]] for general rings, and is a [[reduced ring]] for commutative rings.\n* '''[[Primary ideal]]''': An ideal ''I'' is called a '''primary ideal''' if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', if ''ab'' is in ''I'', then at least one of ''a'' and ''b''<sup>''n''</sup> is in ''I'' for some [[natural number]] ''n''. Every prime ideal is primary, but not conversely. A semiprime primary ideal is prime.\n* '''[[Principal ideal]]''': An ideal generated by ''one'' element.\n* '''Finitely generated ideal''': This type of ideal is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as a module.\n* '''[[Primitive ideal]]''': A left primitive ideal is the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of a [[simple module|simple]] left [[module (mathematics)|module]].\n* '''[[Irreducible ideal]]''': An ideal is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as an intersection of ideals which properly contain it.\n* '''Comaximal ideals''': Two ideals <math>\\mathfrak{i}, \\mathfrak{j}</math> are said to be '''comaximal''' if <math>x + y = 1</math> for some <math>x \\in \\mathfrak{i}</math> and <math>y \\in \\mathfrak{j}</math>.\n* '''[[Regular ideal]]''': This term has multiple uses. See the article for a list.\n* '''[[Nil ideal]]''':  An ideal is a nil ideal if each of its elements is nilpotent.\n* '''[[Nilpotent ideal]]''':  Some power of it is zero.\n* '''[[Parameter ideal]]''': an ideal generated by a [[system of parameters]].\n\nTwo other important terms using \"ideal\" are not always ideals of their ring. See their respective articles for details:\n*'''[[Fractional ideal]]''': This is usually defined when ''R'' is a commutative domain with [[quotient field]] ''K''. Despite their names, fractional ideals are ''R'' submodules of ''K'' with a special property. If the fractional ideal is contained entirely in ''R'', then it is truly an ideal of ''R''.\n*'''[[Invertible ideal]]''': Usually an invertible ideal ''A'' is defined as a fractional ideal for which there is another fractional ideal ''B'' such that ''AB''=''BA''=''R''. Some authors may also apply \"invertible ideal\" to ordinary ring ideals ''A'' and ''B'' with ''AB''=''BA''=''R'' in rings other than domains.\n\n== Ideal operations ==\nThe sum and product of ideals are defined as follows. For  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math>, left (resp. right) ideals of a ring ''R'', their sum is\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}:=\\{a+b \\mid a \\in \\mathfrak{a} \\mbox{ and } b \\in \\mathfrak{b}\\}</math>,\nwhich is a left (resp. right) ideal,\nand, if <math>\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{b}</math> are two-sided,\n:<math>\\mathfrak{a} \\mathfrak{b}:=\\{a_1b_1+ \\dots + a_nb_n \\mid a_i \\in \\mathfrak{a} \\mbox{ and } b_i \\in \\mathfrak{b}, i=1, 2, \\dots, n; \\mbox{ for } n=1, 2, \\dots\\},</math>\ni.e. the product is the ideal generated by all products of the form ''ab'' with ''a'' in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> and ''b'' in <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math>.\n\nNote <math>\\mathfrak{a} + \\mathfrak{b}</math> is the smallest left (resp. right) ideal containing both <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> (or the union <math>\\mathfrak{a} \\cup \\mathfrak{b}</math>), while  the product <math>\\mathfrak{a}\\mathfrak{b}</math> is contained in the intersection of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math>.\n\nThe distributive law holds for two-sided ideals <math>\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{b}, \\mathfrak{c}</math>,\n*<math>\\mathfrak{a}(\\mathfrak{b} + \\mathfrak{c}) = \\mathfrak{a} \\mathfrak{b} + \\mathfrak{a} \\mathfrak{c}</math>,\n*<math>(\\mathfrak{a} + \\mathfrak{b}) \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{a}\\mathfrak{c} + \\mathfrak{b}\\mathfrak{c}</math>.\nIf a product is replaced by an intersection, a partial distributive law holds:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{a} \\cap (\\mathfrak{b} + \\mathfrak{c}) \\supset \\mathfrak{a} \\cap \\mathfrak{b} + \\mathfrak{a} \\cap \\mathfrak{c}</math>\nwhere the equality holds if <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> contains <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> or <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math>.\n\n'''Remark''': The sum and the intersection of ideals is again an ideal; with these two operations as join and meet, the set of all ideals of a given ring forms a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[modular lattice]]. The lattice is not, in general, a [[distributive lattice]]. The three operations of intersection, sum (or join), and product make the set of ideals of a commutative ring into a [[quantale]].\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{b}</math> are ideals of a commutative ring ''R'', then <math>\\mathfrak{a} \\cap \\mathfrak{b} = \\mathfrak{a} \\mathfrak{b}</math> in the following two cases (at least) \n*<math>\\mathfrak{a} + \\mathfrak{b} = (1)</math>\n*<math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is generated by elements that form a regular sequence modulo <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math>.\n(More generally, the difference between a product and an intersection of ideals is measured by the [[Tor functor]]:<math>\\operatorname{Tor}^R_1(R/\\mathfrak{a}, R/\\mathfrak{b}) = (\\mathfrak{a} \\cap \\mathfrak{b})/ \\mathfrak{a} \\mathfrak{b}.</math><ref>{{harvnb|Eisenbud|loc=Exercise A 3.17}}</ref>)\n\nAn integral domain is called a [[Dedekind domain]] if for each pair of ideals <math>\\mathfrak{a} \\subset \\mathfrak{b}</math>, there is an ideal <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> such that <math>\\mathfrak \\mathfrak{a} = \\mathfrak{b} \\mathfrak{c}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Milnor|loc=page 9.}}</ref> It can then be shown that every nonzero ideal of a Dedekind domain can be uniquely written as a product of maximal ideals, a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].\n\n== Examples of ideal operations ==\nIn <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> we have\n:<math>(n)\\cap(m) = \\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)\\mathbb{Z}</math>\nsince <math>(n)\\cap(m)</math> is the set of integers which are divisible by both <math>n</math> and <math>m</math>.\n\nLet <math>R = \\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]</math> and let <math>I = (z, w),\\text{ }J = (x+z,y+w),\\text{ }K = (x+z, w)</math>.

By definition, a [[primitive ideal]] of ''R'' is the annihilator of a (nonzero) [[simple module|simple ''R''-module]]. The [[Jacobson radical]] <math>J = \\operatorname{Jac}(R)</math> of ''R'' is the intersection of all primitive ideals. Equivalently,\n:<math>J = \\bigcap_{\\mathfrak{m} \\text{ maximal ideals}} \\mathfrak{m}.</math>\nIndeed, if <math>M</math> is a simple module and ''x'' is a nonzero element in ''M'', then <math>Rx = M</math> and <math>R/\\operatorname{Ann}(M) = R/\\operatorname{Ann}(x) \\simeq M</math>, meaning <math>\\operatorname{Ann}(M)</math> is a maximal ideal. Conversely, if <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> is a maximal ideal, then <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> is the annihilator of the simple ''R''-module <math>R/\\mathfrak{m}</math>. There is also another characterization (the proof is not hard):\n:<math>J = \\{ x \\in R \\mid 1 - yx \\, \\text{ is a unit element for every } y \\in R\\}.</math>\nFor a not-necessarily-commutative ring, it is a general fact that <math>1 - yx</math> is a [[unit element]] if and only if <math>1 - xy</math> is (see the link) and so this last characterization shows that the radical can be defined both in terms of left and right primitive ideals.\n\nThe following simple but important fact ([[Nakayama's lemma]]) is built-in to the definition of a Jacobson radical: if ''M'' is a module such that <math>JM = M</math>, then ''M'' does not admit a [[maximal submodule]], since if there is a maximal submodule <math>L \\subsetneq M</math>, <math>J \\cdot (M/L) = 0</math> and so <math>M = JM \\subset L \\subset M</math>, a contradiction. Since a nonzero [[finitely generated module]] admits a maximal submodule, in particular, one has:\n:If <math>JM = M</math> and ''M'' is finitely generated, then <math>M = 0.</math>\n\nA maximal ideal is a prime ideal and so one has\n:<math>\\operatorname{nil}(R) =\n\\bigcap_{\\mathfrak{p} \\text { prime ideals }} \\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\operatorname{Jac}(R)</math>\nwhere the intersection on the left is called the [[Nilradical of a ring|nilradical]] of ''R''. As it turns out, <math>\\operatorname{nil}(R)</math> is also the set of [[nilpotent element]]s of ''R''.\n\nIf ''R'' is an [[Artinian ring]], then <math>\\operatorname{Jac}(R)</math> is nilpotent and <math>\\operatorname{nil}(R) = \\operatorname{Jac}(R)</math>. (Proof: first note the DCC implies <math>J^n = J^{n+1}</math> for some ''n''. If (DCC) <math>\\mathfrak{a} \\supsetneq \\operatorname{Ann}(J^n)</math> is an ideal properly minimal over the latter, then <math>J \\cdot (\\mathfrak{a}/\\operatorname{Ann}(J^n)) = 0</math>. That is, <math>J^n \\mathfrak{a} = J^{n+1} \\mathfrak{a} = 0</math>, a contradiction.)\n\n== Extension and contraction of an ideal ==\n\nLet ''A'' and ''B'' be two [[commutative ring]]s, and let ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' be a [[ring homomorphism]]. If <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is an ideal in ''A'', then <math>f(\\mathfrak{a})</math> need not be an ideal in ''B'' (e.g. take ''f'' to be the [[inclusion map|inclusion]] of the ring of integers '''Z''' into the field of rationals '''Q'''). The '''extension''' <math>\\mathfrak{a}^e</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> in ''B'' is defined to be the ideal in ''B'' generated by <math>f(\\mathfrak{a})</math>. Explicitly,\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{a}^e = \\Big\\{ \\sum y_if(x_i) : x_i \\in \\mathfrak{a}, y_i \\in B \\Big\\}</math>\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> is an ideal of ''B'', then <math>f^{-1}(\\mathfrak{b})</math> is always an ideal of ''A'', called the '''contraction''' <math>\\mathfrak{b}^c</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> to ''A''.\n\nAssuming ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is a ring homomorphism, <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is an ideal in ''A'', <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> is an ideal in ''B'', then:\n\n* <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> is prime in ''B'' <math>\\Rightarrow</math> <math>\\mathfrak{b}^c</math> is prime in ''A''.\n* <math>\\mathfrak{a}^{ec} \\supseteq \\mathfrak{a}</math>\n* <math>\\mathfrak{b}^{ce} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{b}</math>\n\nIt is false, in general, that <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> being prime (or maximal) in ''A'' implies that <math>\\mathfrak{a}^e</math> is prime (or maximal) in ''B''. Many classic examples of this stem from algebraic number theory. For example, [[embedding]] <math>\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}\\left\\lbrack i \\right\\rbrack</math>. In <math>B = \\mathbb{Z}\\left\\lbrack i \\right\\rbrack</math>, the element 2 factors as <math>2 = (1 + i)(1 - i)</math> where (one can show) neither of <math>1 + i, 1 - i</math> are units in ''B''. So <math>(2)^e</math> is not prime in ''B'' (and therefore not maximal, as well). Indeed, <math>(1 \\pm i)^2 = \\pm 2i</math> shows that <math>(1 + i) = ((1 - i) - (1 - i)^2)</math>, <math>(1 - i) = ((1 + i) - (1 + i)^2)</math>, and therefore <math>(2)^e = (1 + i)^2</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, if ''f'' is [[surjective_function|surjective]] and [[kernel_(algebra)|<math> \\mathfrak{a} \\supseteq \\ker f</math>]] then:\n\n* <math>\\mathfrak{a}^{ec}=\\mathfrak{a} </math> and <math>\\mathfrak{b}^{ce}=\\mathfrak{b}</math>.\n* <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is a [[prime ideal]] in ''A'' <math>\\Leftrightarrow</math> <math>\\mathfrak{a}^e</math> is a prime ideal in ''B''.\n* <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is a [[maximal ideal]] in ''A'' <math>\\Leftrightarrow</math> <math>\\mathfrak{a}^e</math> is a maximal ideal in ''B''.\n\n'''Remark''': Let ''K'' be a [[field extension]] of ''L'', and let ''B'' and ''A'' be the [[ring of integers|rings of integers]] of ''K'' and ''L'', respectively. Then ''B'' is an [[integral extension]] of ''A'', and we let ''f'' be the [[inclusion map]] from ''A'' to ''B''. The behaviour of a [[prime ideal]] <math>\\mathfrak{a} = \\mathfrak{p}</math> of ''A'' under extension is one of the central problems of [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nThe following is sometimes useful:<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|loc=Proposition 3.16.}}</ref> a prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is a contraction of a prime ideal if and only if <math>\\mathfrak{p} = \\mathfrak{p}^{ec}</math>. (Proof: Assuming the latter, note <math>\\mathfrak{p}^e B_{\\mathfrak{p}} = B_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\Rightarrow \\mathfrak{p}^e</math> intersects <math>A - \\mathfrak{p}</math>, a contradiction. Now, the prime ideals of <math>B_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> correspond to those in ''B'' that are disjoint from <math>A - \\mathfrak{p}</math>. Hence, there is a prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> of ''B'', disjoint from <math>A - \\mathfrak{p}</math>, such that <math>\\mathfrak{q} B_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> is a maximal ideal containing <math>\\mathfrak{p}^e B_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math>. One then checks that <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> lies over <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. The converse is obvious.)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Modular arithmetic]]\n* [[Noether isomorphism theorem]]\n* [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]]\n* [[Ideal theory]]\n* [[Ideal (order theory)]]\n* [[Ideal norm]]\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions]]\n* [[Ideal sheaf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[M.

      "text": "In algebra, the '''integral closure''' of an ideal ''I'' of a commutative ring ''R'', denoted by <math>\\overline{I}</math>, is the set of all elements ''r'' in ''R'' that are integral over ''I'': there exist <math>a_i \\in I^i</math> such that\n:<math>r^n + a_1 r^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} r + a_n = 0.</math>\nIt is similar to the [[integral closure]] of a subring. For example, if ''R'' is a domain, an element ''r'' in ''R'' belongs to <math>\\overline{I}</math> if and only if there is a finitely generated ''R''-module ''M'', annihilated only by zero, such that <math>r M \\subset I M</math>. It follows that <math>\\overline{I}</math> is an ideal of ''R'' (in fact, the integral closure of an ideal is always an ideal; see below.) ''I'' is said to be '''integrally closed''' if <math>I = \\overline{I}</math>.\n\nThe integral closure of an ideal appears in a theorem of [[David Rees (mathematician)|Rees]] that characterizes an [[analytically unramified ring]].\n\n== Examples ==\n*In <math>\\mathbb{C}[x, y]</math>, <math>x^i y^{d-i}</math> is integral over <math>(x^d, y^d)</math>.\n*[[Radical ideal]]s (e.g., prime ideals) are integrally closed. The intersection of integrally closed ideals is integrally closed.\n*In a [[normal ring]], for any non-zerodivisor ''x'' and any ideal ''I'', <math>\\overline{xI} = x \\overline{I}</math>. In particular, in a normal ring, a principal ideal generated by a non-zerodivisor is integrally closed.\n*Let <math>R = k[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]</math> be a polynomial ring over a field ''k''. An ideal ''I'' in ''R'' is called [[monomial ideal|monomial]] if it is generated by monomials; i.e., <math>X_1^{a_1} \\cdots X_n^{a_n}</math>. The integral closure of a monomial ideal is monomial.\n\n== Structure results ==\nLet ''R'' be a ring. The [[Rees algebra]] <math>R[It] = \\oplus_{n \\ge 0} I^n t^n</math> can be used to compute the integral closure of an ideal. The structure result is the following: the integral closure of <math>R[It]</math> in <math>R[t]</math>, which is graded, is <math>\\oplus_{n \\ge 0} \\overline{I^n} t^n</math>. In particular, <math>\\overline{I}</math> is an ideal and <math>\\overline{I} = \\overline{\\overline{I}}</math>; i.e., the integral closure of an ideal is integrally closed. It also follows that the integral closure of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.\n\nThe following type of results is called the '''Briancon–Skoda theorem''': let ''R'' be a regular ring and {{mvar|I}} an ideal generated by {{mvar|l}} elements. Then <math>\\overline{I^{n+l}} \\subset I^{n+1}</math> for any <math>n \\ge 0</math>.\n\nA theorem of Rees states: let (''R'', ''m'') be a noetherian local ring.

Given an element ''b'' in ''B'', the following conditions are equivalent:\n:(i) ''b'' is integral over ''A'';\n:(ii) the subring ''A''[''b''] of ''B'' generated by ''A'' and ''b'' is a [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated ''A''-module]];\n:(iii) there exists a subring ''C'' of ''B'' containing ''A''[''b''] and which is a finitely-generated ''A''-module;\n:(iv) there exists a finitely generated ''A''-submodule ''M'' of ''B'' such that ''bM'' ⊂ ''M'' and ''M'' is [[faithful module|faithful]] over ''A''[''b''] (i.e., the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of ''M'' in ''A''[''b''] is zero.)\n\nThe usual proof of this uses the following variant of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] on [[determinant]]s:\n:'''Theorem''' Let ''u'' be an [[endomorphism]] of an ''A''-module ''M'' generated by ''n'' elements and ''I'' an ideal of ''A'' such that <math>u(M) \\subset IM</math>. Then there is a relation:\n:: <math>u^n + a_1 u^{n-1} + \\cdots  + a_{n-1} u + a_n = 0, \\, a_i \\in I^i.</math>\nThis theorem (with ''I'' = ''A'' and ''u'' multiplication by ''b'') gives (iv) ⇒ (i) and the rest is easy. Coincidentally, [[Nakayama's lemma]] is also an immediate consequence of this theorem.\n\nIt follows from the above that the set of elements of ''B'' that are integral over ''A'' forms a subring of ''B'' containing ''A''.<ref>Proof: If ''x'', ''y'' are elements of ''B'' that are integral over ''A'', then <math>x + y, xy, -x</math> are integral over ''A'' since they stabilize <math>A[x]A[y]</math>, which is a finitely generated module over ''A'' and is annihilated only by zero.</ref> It is called the '''integral closure''' of ''A'' in ''B''.<ref>The proof is due to Dedekind (Milne, ANT). Alternatively, one can use symmetric polynomials to show integral elements form a ring. (loc cit.)</ref> If ''A'' happens to be the integral closure of ''A'' in ''B'', then ''A'' is said to be '''integrally closed''' in ''B''. If ''B'' is the [[total ring of fractions]] of ''A'' (e.g., the field of fractions when ''A'' is an integral domain), then one sometimes drops qualification \"in B\" and simply says \"integral closure\" and \"[[integrally closed domain|integrally closed]].\"<ref>Chapter 2 of [[#Reference-idHS2006|Huneke and Swanson 2006]]</ref> Let ''A'' be an integral domain with the field of fractions ''K'' and ''A' '' the integral closure of ''A'' in an algebraic field extension ''L'' of ''K''. Then the field of fractions of ''A' '' is ''L''. In particular, ''A' '' is an [[integrally closed domain]].\n\nSimilarly, \"integrality\" is transitive. Let ''C'' be a ring containing ''B'' and ''c'' in ''C''. If ''c'' is integral over ''B'' and ''B'' integral over ''A'', then ''c'' is integral over ''A''. In particular, if ''C'' is itself integral over ''B'' and ''B'' is integral over ''A'', then ''C'' is also integral over ''A''.\n\nNote that (iii) implies that if ''B'' is integral over ''A'', then ''B'' is a union (equivalently an [[inductive limit]]) of subrings that are finitely generated ''A''-modules.\n\nIf ''A'' is [[Noetherian ring|noetherian]], (iii) can be weakened to:\n\n:(iii) bis There exists a finitely generated ''A''-submodule of ''B'' that contains ''A''[''b''].\n\nFinally, the assumption that ''A'' be a subring of ''B'' can be modified a bit. If ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' is a [[ring homomorphism]], then one says ''f'' is '''integral''' if ''B'' is integral over ''f''(''A''). In the same way one says ''f'' is '''finite''' (''B'' finitely generated ''A''-module) or of '''finite type''' (''B'' finitely generated ''A''-algebra). In this viewpoint, one has that\n:''f'' is finite if and only if ''f'' is integral and of finite-type.\nOr more explicitly,\n:''B'' is a finitely generated ''A''-module if and only if ''B'' is generated as an ''A''-algebra by a finite number of elements integral over ''A''.\n\n== Integral extensions ==\nAn integral extension ''A''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''B'' has the [[Going up and going down|going-up property]], the [[lying over]] property, and the [[Going up and going down#Lying over and incomparability|incomparability]] property ([[Going up and going down|Cohen–Seidenberg theorems]]). Explicitly, given a chain of prime ideals <math>\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathfrak{p}_n</math> in ''A'' there exists a <math>\\mathfrak{p}'_1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathfrak{p}'_n</math> in ''B'' with <math>\\mathfrak{p}_i = \\mathfrak{p}'_i \\cap A</math> (going-up and lying over) and two distinct prime ideals with inclusion relation cannot contract to the same prime ideal (incomparability). In particular, the [[Krull dimension]]s of ''A'' and ''B'' are the same. Furthermore, if ''A'' is an integrally closed domain, then the going-down holds (see below).\n\nIn general, the going-up implies the lying-over.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaplansky|1970|loc=Theorem 42}}</ref> Thus, in the below, we simply say the \"going-up\" to mean \"going-up\" and \"lying-over\".\n\nWhen ''A'', ''B'' are domains such that ''B'' is integral over ''A'', ''A'' is a field if and only if ''B'' is a field. As a corollary, one has: given a prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> of ''B'', <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> is a [[maximal ideal]] of ''B'' if and only if <math>\\mathfrak{q} \\cap A</math> is a maximal ideal of ''A''. Another corollary: if ''L''/''K'' is an algebraic extension, then any subring of ''L'' containing ''K'' is a field.\n\nLet ''B'' be a ring that is integral over a subring ''A'' and ''k'' an algebraically closed field. If <math>f: A \\to k</math> is a homomorphism, then ''f'' extends to a homomorphism ''B'' → ''k''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|2006|loc=Ch 5, §2, Corollary 4 to Theorem 1.}}</ref> This follows from the going-up.\n\nLet <math>f: A \\to B</math> be an integral extension of rings. Then the induced map\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f^\\#: \\operatorname{Spec} B \\to \\operatorname{Spec} A \\\\ p \\mapsto f^{-1}(p)\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis a [[closed map]]; in fact, <math>f^\\#(V(I)) = V(f^{-1}(I))</math> for any ideal ''I'' and <math>f^\\#</math> is surjective if ''f'' is injective. This is a geometric interpretation of the going-up.\n\nIf ''B'' is integral over ''A'', then <math>B \\otimes_A R</math> is integral over ''R'' for any ''A''-algebra ''R''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|2006|loc=Ch 5, §1, Proposition 5}}</ref> In particular, <math>\\operatorname{Spec} (B \\otimes_A R) \\to \\operatorname{Spec} R</math> is closed; i.e., the integral extension induces a \"universally closed\" map. This leads to a geometric characterization of integral extension. Namely, let ''B'' be a ring with only finitely many [[minimal prime ideal]]s (e.g., integral domain or noetherian ring). Then ''B'' is integral over a (subring) ''A'' if and only if <math>\\operatorname{Spec} (B \\otimes_A R) \\to \\operatorname{Spec} R</math> is closed for any ''A''-algebra ''R''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch 5. Exercise 35}}</ref>\n\n:'''Proposition.''' Let ''A'' be an integrally closed domain with the field of fractions ''K'', ''L'' a finite [[normal extension]] of ''K'', ''B'' the integral closure of ''A'' in ''L''. Then the group <math>G = \\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)</math> acts transitively on each fiber of <math>\\operatorname{Spec} B \\to \\operatorname{Spec} A</math>. \n\n'''Proof.''' Suppose <math>\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\ne \\sigma(\\mathfrak{p}_1)</math> for any <math>\\sigma</math> in ''G''. Then, by [[prime avoidance]], there is an element ''x'' in <math>\\mathfrak{p}_2</math> such that <math>\\sigma(x) \\not\\in \\mathfrak{p}_1</math> for any <math>\\sigma</math>. ''G'' fixes the element <math>y = \\prod\\nolimits_{\\sigma} \\sigma(x)</math> and thus ''y'' is [[purely inseparable]] over ''K''. Then some power <math>y^e</math> belongs to ''K''; since ''A'' is integrally closed we have: <math>y^e \\in A.</math> Thus, we found <math>y^e</math> is in <math>\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\cap A</math> but not in <math>\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\cap A</math>; i.e., <math>\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\cap A \\ne \\mathfrak{p}_2 \\cap A</math>.\n\n'''Remark.''' The same idea in the proof shows that if <math>L/K</math> is a purely inseparable extension (need not be normal), then <math>\\operatorname{Spec} B \\to \\operatorname{Spec} A</math> is bijective.\n\nLet ''A'', ''K'', etc. as before but assume ''L'' is only a finite field extension of ''K''. Then\n:(i) <math>\\operatorname{Spec} B \\to \\operatorname{Spec} A</math> has finite fibers.\n:(ii) the going-down holds between ''A'' and ''B'': given <math>\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathfrak{p}_n = \\mathfrak{p}'_n \\cap A</math>, there exists <math>\\mathfrak{p}'_1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathfrak{p}'_n</math> that contracts to it.\nIndeed, in both statements, by enlarging ''L'', we can assume ''L'' is a normal extension. Then (i) is immediate. As for (ii), by the going-up, we can find a chain <math>\\mathfrak{p}''_i</math> that contracts to <math>\\mathfrak{p}'_i</math>. By transitivity, there is <math>\\sigma \\in G</math> such that <math>\\sigma(\\mathfrak{p}''_n) = \\mathfrak{p}'_n</math> and then <math>\\mathfrak{p}'_i = \\sigma(\\mathfrak{p}''_i)</math> are the desired chain.\n\nLet ''B'' be a ring and ''A'' a subring that is a noetherian integrally closed domain (i.e., <math>\\operatorname{Spec} A</math> is a [[normal scheme]].) If ''B'' is integral over ''A'', then <math>\\operatorname{Spec} B \\to \\operatorname{Spec} A</math> is [[submersion (algebra)|submersive]]; i.e., the topology of <math>\\operatorname{Spec} A</math> is the [[quotient topology]].<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1970|loc=Ch 2. Theorem 7}}</ref> The proof uses the notion of [[constructible set (topology)|constructible set]]s. (See also: [[torsor (algebraic geometry)]].)\n\n== Integral closure ==\n{{see also|Integral closure of an ideal}}\nLet ''A'' ⊂ ''B'' be rings and ''A' '' the integral closure of ''A'' in ''B''.  (See above for the definition.)\n\nIntegral closures behave nicely under various constructions. Specifically, for a [[multiplicatively closed subset]] ''S'' of ''A'', the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] ''S''<sup>−1</sup>''A' '' is the integral closure of ''S''<sup>−1</sup>''A'' in ''S''<sup>−1</sup>''B'', and <math>A'[t]</math> is the integral closure of <math>A[t]</math> in <math>B[t]</math>.<ref>An exercise in Atiyah–MacDonald.</ref> If <math>A_i</math> are subrings of rings <math>B_i, 1 \\le i \\le n</math>, then the integral closure of <math>\\prod A_i</math> in <math>\\prod B_i</math> is <math>\\prod {A_i}'</math> where <math>{A_i}'</math> are the integral closures of <math>A_i</math> in <math>B_i</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|2006|loc=Ch 5, §1, Proposition 9}}</ref>\n\nThe integral closure of a local ring ''A'' in, say, ''B'', need not be local. (If this is the case, the ring is called [[Unibranch local ring|unibranch]].) This is the case for example when ''A'' is [[Henselian ring|Henselian]] and ''B'' is a field extension of the field of fractions of ''A''.\n\nIf ''A'' is a subring of a field ''K'', then the integral closure of ''A'' in ''K'' is the intersection of all [[valuation ring]]s of ''K'' containing ''A''.\n\nLet ''A'' be an <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>-graded subring of an <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>-[[graded ring]] ''B''. Then the integral closure of ''A'' in ''B'' is an <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>-graded subring of ''B''.<ref>Proof: Let <math>\\phi: B \\to B[t]</math> be a ring homomorphism such that <math>\\phi(b_n) = b_n t^n</math> if <math>b_n</math> is homogeneous of degree ''n''. The integral closure of <math>A[t]</math> in <math>B[t]</math> is <math>A'[t]</math>, where <math>A'</math> is the integral closure of ''A'' in ''B''. If ''b'' in ''B'' is integral over ''A'', then <math>\\phi(b)</math> is integral over <math>A[t]</math>; i.e., it is in <math>A'[t]</math>. That is, each coefficient <math>b_n</math> in the polynomial <math>\\phi(b)</math> is in ''A<nowiki>'</nowiki>''.</ref>\n\nThere is also a concept of the [[integral closure of an ideal]].  The integral closure of an ideal <math>I \\subset R</math>, usually denoted by <math>\\overline I</math>, is the set of all elements <math>r \\in R</math> such that there exists a monic polynomial \n:<math>x^n + a_{1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} x^1 + a_n</math> \nwith <math>a_i \\in I</math> with <math>r</math> as a root. Note this is the definition that appears, for example, in Eisenbud and is different from Bourbaki's and Atiyah–MacDonald's definition.<!--The integral closure of an ideal is easily seen to be in the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of this ideal. dubious?-->\n\nFor noetherian rings, there are alternate definitions as well.\n\n*<math>r \\in \\overline I</math> if there exists a <math>c \\in R</math> not contained in any minimal prime, such that <math>c r^n \\in I^n</math> for all <math>n \\ge 1</math>.\n*<math> r \\in \\overline I</math> if in the normalized blow-up of ''I'', the pull back of ''r'' is contained in the inverse image of ''I''.  The blow-up of an ideal is an operation of schemes which replaces the given ideal with a principal ideal.  The normalization of a scheme is simply the scheme corresponding to the integral closure of all of its rings.\n\nThe notion of integral closure of an ideal is used in some proofs of the [[Going up and going down|going-down theorem]].\n\n== Conductor ==\n{{main|Conductor (ring theory)}}\n\nLet ''B'' be a ring and ''A'' a subring of ''B'' such that ''B'' is integral over ''A''. Then the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of the ''A''-module ''B''/''A'' is called the ''conductor'' of ''A'' in ''B''. Because the notion has origin in [[algebraic number theory]], the conductor is denoted by <math>\\mathfrak{f} = \\mathfrak{f}(B/A)</math>. Explicitly, <math>\\mathfrak{f}</math> consists of elements ''a'' in ''A'' such that <math>aB \\subset A</math>. (cf. [[idealizer]] in abstract algebra.) It is the largest [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''A'' that is also an ideal of ''B''.<ref>Chapter 12 of [[#Reference-idHS2006|Huneke and Swanson 2006]]</ref> If ''S'' is a multiplicatively closed subset of ''A'', then\n:<math>S^{-1}\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) = \\mathfrak{f}(S^{-1}B/S^{-1}A)</math>.\nIf ''B'' is a subring of the [[total ring of fractions]] of ''A'', then we may identify\n:<math>\\ \\mathfrak{f}(B/A)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(B, A)</math>.\n\nExample: Let ''k'' be a field and let <math>A = k[t^2, t^3] \\subset B = k[t]</math> (i.e., ''A'' is the coordinate ring of the affine curve <math>x^2 = y^3</math>.) ''B'' is the integral closure of ''A'' in <math>k(t)</math>. The conductor of ''A'' in ''B'' is the ideal <math>(t^2, t^3) A</math>. More generally, the conductor of <math>A = k[[t^a, t^b]]</math>, ''a'', ''b'' relatively prime, is <math>(t^c, t^{c+1}, \\dots) A</math> with <math>c = (a-1)(b-1)</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2006|loc=Example 12.2.1}}</ref>\n\nSuppose ''B'' is the integral closure of an integral domain ''A'' in the field of fractions of ''A'' such that the ''A''-module <math>B/A</math> is finitely generated. Then the conductor <math>\\mathfrak{f}</math> of ''A'' is an ideal defining the [[support of a module|support of]] <math>B/A</math>; thus, ''A'' coincides with ''B'' in the complement of <math>V(\\mathfrak{f})</math> in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}A</math>. In particular, the set <math>\\{ \\mathfrak{p} \\in \\operatorname{Spec}A \\mid A_\\mathfrak{p} \\text{ is integrally closed} \\}</math>, the complement of <math>V(\\mathfrak{f})</math>, is an open set.\n\n== Finiteness of integral closure ==\nAn important but difficult question is on the finiteness of the integral closure of a finitely generated algebra. There are several known results.\n\nThe integral closure of a Dedekind domain in a finite extension of the field of fractions is a Dedekind domain; in particular, a noetherian ring. This is a consequence of the [[Krull–Akizuki theorem]]. In general, the integral closure of a noetherian domain of dimension at most 2 is noetherian; Nagata gave an example of dimension 3 noetherian domain whose integral closure is not noetherian.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2006|loc=Exercise 4.9}}</ref> A nicer statement is this: the integral closure of a noetherian domain is a [[Krull domain]] ([[Mori–Nagata theorem]]). Nagata also gave an example of dimension 1 noetherian local domain such that the integral closure is not finite over that domain.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nLet ''A'' be a noetherian integrally closed domain with field of fractions ''K''. If ''L''/''K'' is a finite separable extension, then the integral closure <math>A'</math> of ''A'' in ''L'' is a finitely generated ''A''-module.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch 5. Proposition 5.17}}</ref> This is easy and standard (uses the fact that the trace defines a non-degenerate bilinear form.)\n\nLet ''A'' be a finitely generated algebra over a field ''k'' that is an integral domain with field of fractions ''K''. If ''L'' is a finite extension of ''K'', then the integral closure <math>A'</math> of ''A'' in ''L'' is a finitely generated ''A''-module and is also a finitely generated ''k''-algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Ch I. Theorem 3.9 A}}</ref> The result is due to Noether and can be shown using the [[Noether normalization lemma]] as follows. It is clear that it is enough to show the assertion when ''L''/''K'' is either separable or purely inseparable. The separable case is noted above; thus, assume ''L''/''K'' is purely inseparable. By the normalization lemma, ''A'' is integral over the polynomial ring <math>S = k[x_1, ..., x_d]</math>. Since ''L''/''K'' is a finite purely inseparable extension, there is a power ''q'' of a prime number such that every element of ''L'' is a ''q''-th root of an element in ''K''. Let <math>k'</math> be a finite extension of ''k'' containing all ''q''-th roots of coefficients of finitely many rational functions that generate ''L''. Then we have: <math>L \\subset k'(x_1^{1/q}, ..., x_d^{1/q}).</math> The ring on the right is the field of fractions of <math>k'[x_1^{1/q}, ..., x_d^{1/q}]</math>, which is the integral closure of ''S''; thus, contains <math>A'</math>. Hence, <math>A'</math> is finite over ''S''; a fortiori, over ''A''. The result remains true if we replace ''k'' by '''Z'''.\n\nThe integral closure of a complete local noetherian domain ''A'' in a finite extension of the field of fractions of ''A'' is finite over ''A''.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2006|loc=Theorem 4.3.4}}</ref> More precisely, for a local noetherian ring ''R'', we have the following chains of implications:<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1970|loc=Ch 12}}</ref>\n:(i) ''A'' complete <math>\\Rightarrow</math> ''A'' is a [[Nagata ring]]\n:(ii) ''A'' is a Nagata domain <math>\\Rightarrow</math> ''A'' [[analytically unramified]] <math>\\Rightarrow</math> the integral closure of the completion <math>\\widehat{A}</math> is finite over <math>\\widehat{A}</math> <math>\\Rightarrow</math> the integral closure of ''A'' is finite over A.\n\n==Noether's normalization lemma==\n{{main|Noether normalization lemma}}\n\nNoether's normalisation lemma is a theorem in [[commutative algebra]].  Given a field ''K'' and a finitely generated ''K''-algebra ''A'', the theorem says it is possible to find elements ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''y''<sub>''m''</sub> in ''A'' that are [[Algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] over ''K'' such that ''A'' is finite (and hence integral) over ''B'' = ''K''[''y''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''y''<sub>''m''</sub>].  Thus the extension ''K'' ⊂ ''A'' can be written as a composite ''K'' ⊂ ''B'' ⊂ ''A'' where ''K'' ⊂ ''B'' is a purely transcendental extension and ''B'' ⊂ ''A'' is finite.<ref>Chapter 4 of Reid.</ref>\n\n==Integral morphisms==\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], a morphism <math>f:X\\to Y</math> of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] is ''integral'' if it is [[Sheaf of algebras#Affine morphism|affine]] and if for some (equivalently, every) affine open cover <math>U_i</math> of ''Y'', every map <math>f^{-1}(U_i)\\to U_i</math> is of the form <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(A)\\to\\operatorname{Spec}(B)</math> where ''A'' is an integral ''B''-algebra. The class of integral morphisms is more general than the class of [[Finite morphism|finite morphisms]] because there are integral extensions that are not finite, such as, in many cases, the algebraic closure of a field over the field.\n\n== Absolute integral closure ==\nLet ''A'' be an integral domain and ''L'' (some) [[algebraic closure]] of the field of fractions of ''A''. Then the integral closure <math>A^+</math> of ''A'' in ''L'' is called the '''absolute integral closure''' of ''A''.<ref>[[Melvin Hochster]], [http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/711F07/L09.07.pdf Math 711: Lecture of September 7, 2007]</ref> It is unique up to a non-canonical isomorphism.

Inverse semigroups appear in a range of contexts; for example, they can be employed in the study of [[partial symmetries]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lawson|1998}}</ref>\n\n(The convention followed in this article will be that of writing a function on the right of its argument, and \ncomposing functions from left to right—a convention often observed in semigroup theory.)\n\n== Origins ==\nInverse semigroups were introduced independently by [[Viktor Vladimirovich Wagner]]<ref>Since his father was German, Wagner preferred the German transliteration of his name (with a \"W\", rather than a \"V\") from Cyrillic — see {{harvnb|Schein|1981}}.</ref> in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1952,<ref>First a short announcement in {{harvnb|Wagner|1952}}, then a much more comprehensive exposition in {{harvnb|Wagner|1953}}.</ref> and by [[Gordon Preston]] in [[Great Britain]] in 1954.<ref>{{harvnb|Preston|1954a}},b,c.</ref> Both authors arrived at inverse semigroups via the study of [[partial one-to-one transformation]]s of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]: a [[partial function|partial transformation]] ''α'' of a set ''X'' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''A'' to \n''B'', where ''A'' and ''B'' are subsets of ''X''. Let ''α'' and ''β'' be partial transformations of a set ''X''; ''α'' and ''β'' can be composed (from left to right) on the largest [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] upon which it \"makes sense\" to compose them:\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{dom}\\alpha\\beta = [\\operatorname{im} \\alpha \\cap \\operatorname{dom} \\beta] \\alpha^{-1} \\, </math>\n\nwhere ''α''<sup>&minus;1</sup> denotes the [[preimage]] under&nbsp;''α''. Partial transformations had already been studied in the context of [[pseudogroup]]s.<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Gołab|1939}}.</ref> It was Wagner, however, who \nwas the first to observe that the composition of partial transformations is a special case of the [[composition of relations|composition of binary relations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Schein|2002|p=152}}</ref> He recognised also that the domain of composition of two partial transformations may be the [[empty set]], so he introduced an ''empty transformation'' to take account of this. With the addition of this empty transformation, the composition of partial transformations of a set becomes an  everywhere-defined [[associative]] [[binary operation]]. Under this composition, the collection <math>\\mathcal{I}_X</math> of all partial one-one transformations of a set ''X'' forms an inverse semigroup, called the ''[[symmetric inverse semigroup]]'' (or monoid) on ''X'', with inverse the functional inverse defined from image to domain (equivalently, the [[converse relation]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Howie|1995|p=149}}</ref> This is the \"archetypal\" inverse semigroup, in the same way that a [[symmetric group]] is the archetypal [[group (mathematics)|group]]. For example, just as every [[group (mathematics)|group]] can be embedded in a [[symmetric group]], every inverse semigroup can be embedded in a symmetric inverse semigroup (see [[#Homomorphisms and representations of inverse semigroups|\"Homomorphisms and representations of inverse semigroups\"]] below).\n\n== The basics ==\nThe inverse of an element ''x'' of an inverse semigroup ''S'' is usually written ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Inverses in an \ninverse semigroup have many of the same properties as inverses in a [[group (mathematics)|group]], for example, \n(''ab'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. In an inverse [[monoid]], ''xx''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and \n''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'' are not necessarily equal to the identity, but they are both [[idempotent]].<ref>{{harvnb|Howie|1995|loc=Proposition 5.1.2(1)}}</ref> An inverse monoid ''S'' in which ''xx''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = 1 = \n''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'', for all ''x'' in ''S'' (a ''unipotent'' inverse monoid), is, of course, a [[group (mathematics)|group]].\n\nThere are a number of equivalent characterisations of an inverse semigroup ''S'':<ref>{{harvnb|Howie|1995|loc=Theorem 5.1.1}}</ref>\n* Every element of ''S'' has a unique inverse, in the above sense.\n* Every element of ''S'' has at least one inverse (''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]]) and [[idempotent]]s commute (that is, the [[idempotent]]s of ''S'' form a [[semilattice]]).\n* Every <math>\\mathcal{L}</math>-class and every <math>\\mathcal{R}</math>-class contains precisely one [[idempotent]], where <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{R}</math> are two of [[Green's relations]].\nThe [[idempotent]] in the <math>\\mathcal{L}</math>-class of ''s'' is ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''s'', whilst the \n[[idempotent]] in the <math>\\mathcal{R}</math>-class of ''s'' is ''ss''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.

In a symmetric inverse semigroup, the [[partial order]] reduces to restriction of mappings, \ni.e., α ≤ β if, and only if, the domain of α is contained in the domain of β and \n''x''α = ''x''β, for all ''x'' in the domain of α.<ref>{{harvnb|Howie|1995|p=153}}</ref>\n\nThe natural partial order on an inverse semigroup interacts with [[Green's relations]] as follows: if ''s'' ≤ \n''t'' and ''s''<math>\\,\\mathcal{L}\\,</math>''t'', then ''s'' = ''t''.

A [[presentation]] of the free inverse semigroup on a set ''X'' may be obtained by considering the [[free semigroup with involution]], where involution is the taking of the inverse, and then [[Semigroup#Homomorphisms and congruences|taking the quotient]] by the '''Vagner congruence'''\n\n:<math>\\{ (xx^{-1}x, x),\\; (xx^{-1}yy^{-1}, yy^{-1}xx^{-1})\\;|\\;x,y \\in (X\\cup X^{-1})^+ \\}. </math>\n\nThe [[Word problem for groups|word problem]] for free inverse semigroups is much more intricate than that of free groups. A celebrated result in this area due to [[W. D. Munn]] who showed that elements of the free inverse semigroup can be naturally regarded as trees, known as Munn trees. Multiplication in the free inverse semigroup has a correspondent on [[Munn tree]]s, which essentially consists of overlapping common portions of the trees. (see Lawson 1998 for further details) <!-- can't say much more without getting into way more details-->\n\nAny free inverse semigroup is ''F''-inverse.<ref name=Lawson97p230/>\n\n== Connections with category theory ==\nThe above composition of partial transformations of a set gives rise to a symmetric inverse semigroup. There is another way of composing partial transformations, which is more restrictive than that used above: two partial transformations ''α'' and ''β'' are composed if, and only if, the image of α is equal to the domain of ''β''; otherwise, the composition αβ is undefined. Under this alternative composition, the collection \nof all partial one-one transformations of a set forms not an inverse semigroup but an [[inductive groupoid]], in the sense of [[category theory]]. This close connection between inverse semigroups and inductive groupoids is embodied in the ''Ehresmann–Schein–Nambooripad Theorem'', which states that an inductive groupoid can always be \nconstructed from an inverse semigroup, and conversely.<ref>{{harvnb|Lawson|1998|loc=4.1.8}}</ref> More precisely, an inverse semigroup is precisely a groupoid in the category of posets which is an [[étale groupoid]] with respect to its (dual) [[Alexandrov topology]] and whose poset of objects is a meet-semilattice.\n\n== Generalisations of inverse semigroups ==\nAs noted above, an inverse semigroup ''S'' can be defined by the conditions (1) ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]], \nand (2) the [[idempotent]]s in ''S'' commute; this has led to two distinct classes of generalisations of \nan inverse semigroup: semigroups in which (1) holds, but (2) does not, and vice versa.\n\nExamples of regular generalisations of an inverse semigroup are:<ref>{{harvnb|Howie|1995|loc=Section 2.4 & Chapter 6}}</ref>\n*''[[Regular semigroup]]s'': a [[semigroup]] ''S'' is ''regular'' if every element has at least one inverse; equivalently, for each ''a'' in ''S'', there is an ''x'' in ''S'' such that ''axa'' = ''a''.\n*''Locally inverse semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is ''locally inverse'' if ''eSe'' is an inverse semigroup, for each [[idempotent]] ''e''.\n*''Orthodox semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is ''orthodox'' if its subset of [[idempotent]]s forms a subsemigroup.\n*''Generalised inverse semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is called a ''generalised inverse semigroup'' if its [[idempotent]]s form a normal band, i.e., ''xyzx'' = ''xzyx'', for all [[idempotent]]s ''x'', ''y'', ''z''.\n\nThe [[class (set theory)|class]] of generalised inverse semigroups is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the class of \nlocally inverse semigroups and the class of orthodox semigroups.<ref>{{harvnb|Howie|1995|p=222}}</ref>\n\nAmongst the non-regular generalisations of an inverse semigroup are:<ref>{{harvnb|Fountain 1979}}, {{harvnb|Gould}}</ref>\n*(Left, right, two-sided) adequate semigroups.\n*(Left, right, two-sided) ample semigroups.\n*(Left, right, two-sided) semiadequate semigroups.\n*Weakly (left, right, two-sided) ample semigroups.\n\n=== Inverse category ===\nThis notion of inverse also readily generalizes to [[Category (mathematics)|categories]]. An '''inverse category''' is simply a category in which every [[morphism]] ''f'':''X''→''Y'' has a generalized inverse ''g'':''Y''→''X'' such that ''fgf'' = ''f'' and ''gfg'' = ''g''. An inverse category is [[selfdual]].

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''J-structure''' is an [[algebraic structure]] over a [[field (algebra)|field]] related to a [[Jordan algebra]].  The concept was introduced by {{harvtxt|Springer|1973}} to develop a theory of Jordan algebras using [[linear algebraic group]]s and axioms taking the Jordan inversion as basic operation and [[Hua's identity]] as a basic relation.  There is a classification of simple structures deriving from the classification of [[semisimple algebraic group]]s.  Over fields of [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''V'' be a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] over a field ''K'' and ''j'' a [[rational map]] from ''V'' to itself, expressible in the form ''n''/''N'' with ''n'' a [[polynomial map]] from ''V'' to itself and ''N'' a polynomial in ''K''[''V''].  Let ''H'' be the subset of GL(''V'') × GL(''V'') containing the pairs (''g'',''h'') such that ''g''∘''j'' = ''j''∘''h'': it is a closed [[subgroup]] of the product and the projection onto the first factor, the set of ''g'' which occur, is the ''structure group'' of ''j'', denoted ''G'''(''j'').\n\nA ''J-structure'' is a triple (''V'',''j'',''e'') where ''V'' is a vector space over ''K'', ''j'' is a [[birational map]] from ''V'' to itself and ''e'' is a non-zero element of ''V'' satisfying the following conditions.<ref name=Spr10>Springer (1973) p.10</ref>\n* ''j'' is a homogeneous birational [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] of degree −1\n* ''j'' is regular at ''e'' and ''j''(''e'') = ''e''\n* if ''j'' is regular at ''x'', ''e'' + ''x'' and ''e'' + ''j''(''x'') then\n:<math> j(e+x) + j(e+j(x)) = e </math>\n* the orbit ''G'' ''e'' of ''e'' under the structure group ''G'' = ''G''(''j'') is a [[Zariski open]] subset of ''V''.\n\nThe ''norm'' associated to a J-structure (''V'',''j'',''e'') is the numerator ''N'' of ''j'', normalised so that ''N''(''e'') = 1.  The ''degree'' of the J-structure is the degree of ''N'' as a homogeneous polynomial map.<ref name=Spr11>Springer (1973) p.11</ref>\n\nThe ''quadratic map'' of the structure is a map ''P'' from ''V'' to End(''V'') defined in terms of the [[Differential (mathematics)#Algebraic geometry|differential]] d''j'' at an invertible ''x''.<ref name=Spr16>Springer (1973) p.16</ref>  We put\n:<math>P(x) = - (d j)_x^{-1} . </math>\n\nThe quadratic map turns out to be a quadratic polynomial map on ''V''.\n\nThe subgroup of the structure group ''G'' generated by the invertible quadratic maps is the ''inner structure group'' of the J-structure.  It is a closed connected normal subgroup.<ref name=Spr18>Springer (1973) p.18</ref>\n\n==J-structures from quadratic forms==\nLet ''K'' have [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] not equal to 2. Let ''Q'' be a [[quadratic form]] on the vector space ''V'' over ''K'' with associated [[bilinear form]] ''Q''(''x'',''y'') = ''Q''(''x''+''y'') − ''Q''(''x'') − ''Q''(''y'') and distinguished element ''e'' such that ''Q''(''e'',.) is not trivial.

Then (''K''<sup>''r''</sup>, ''Q'', ''e''<sup>''r''</sup>) is a J-structure of degree 2.  It is denoted O<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=Spr33>Springer (1973) p.33</ref>\n\n==Link with Jordan algebras==\nIn [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2, which we assume in this section, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.\n\nLet ''A'' be a finite-dimensional commutative [[non-associative algebra]] over ''K'' with identity ''e''.   Let ''L''(''x'') denote multiplication on the left by ''x''.  There is a unique birational map ''i'' on ''A'' such that ''i''(''x'').''x'' = ''e'' if ''i'' is regular on ''x'': it is homogeneous of degree −1 and an involution with ''i''(''e'') = ''e''.  It may be defined by ''i''(''x'') = ''L''(''x'')<sup>−1</sup>.''e''.

If (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure, then there exists a unique Jordan algebra structure on ''V'' with identity ''e'' with inversion ''j''.\n\n==Link with quadratic Jordan algebras==\nIn general characteristic, which we assume in this section, J-structures are related to [[quadratic Jordan algebra]]s.  We take a quadratic Jordan algebra to be a finite dimensional vector space ''V'' with a quadratic map ''Q'' from ''V'' to End(''V'') and a distinguished element ''e''.  We let ''Q'' also denote the bilinear map ''Q''(''x'',''y'') = ''Q''(''x''+''y'') − ''Q''(''x'') − ''Q''(''y'').

If the squaring is [[dominant morphism|dominant]] (has [[Zariski dense]] image) then the algebra is termed ''separable''.<ref name=Spr74>Springer (1973) p.74</ref>\n\nThere is a unique birational involution ''i'' such that ''Q''(''x'')''i'' ''x'' = ''x'' if ''Q'' is regular at ''x''.  As before, ''i'' is the ''inversion'', definable by ''i''(''x'') = ''Q''(''x'')<sup>−1</sup> ''x''.\n\nIf (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure, with quadratic map ''Q'' then (''V'',''Q'',''e'') is a quadratic Jordan algebra.  In the opposite direction, if (''V'',''Q'',''e'') is a separable quadratic Jordan algebra with inversion ''i'', then (''V'',''i'',''e'') is a J-structure.<ref name=Spr76>Springer (1973) p.76</ref>\n\n===H-structure===\nMcCrimmon proposed a notion of ''H-structure'' by dropping the density axiom and strengthening the third (a form of Hua's identity) to hold in all [[Mutation (algebra)|isotopes]].  The resulting structure is categorically equivalent to a quadratic Jordan algebra.<ref name=McC1977>McCrimmon (1977)</ref><ref name=McC1978>McCrimmon (1978)</ref>\n\n==Peirce decomposition==\nA J-structure has a [[Peirce decomposition]] into subspaces determined by idempotent elements.<ref name=Spr90>Springer (1973) p.90</ref>  Let ''a'' be an idempotent of the J-structure (''V'',''j'',''e''), that is, ''a''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''.

      "text": "In [[ring theory]], a subfield of [[abstract algebra]], a '''right Kasch ring''' is a ring ''R'' for which every [[simple module|simple]] right ''R'' [[module (mathematics)|module]] is isomorphic to a [[right ideal]] of ''R''.<ref>This ideal is necessarily a [[minimal right ideal]].</ref> Analogously the notion of a '''left Kasch ring''' is defined, and the two properties are independent of each other.\n\nKasch rings are named in honor of mathematician [[Friedrich Kasch]]. Kasch originally called [[Artinian ring]]s whose proper [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s have nonzero [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s ''S-rings''. {{harv|Kasch|1954}}{{harv|Morita|1966}} The characterizations below show that Kasch rings generalize S-rings.\n\n==Definition==\nEquivalent definitions will be introduced only for the right-hand version, with the understanding that the left-hand analogues are also true. The Kasch conditions have a few equivalent statements using the concept of [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s, and this article uses the same notation appearing in the annihilator article.\n\nIn addition to the definition given in the introduction, the following properties are equivalent definitions for a ring ''R'' to be right Kasch. They appear in {{harv|Lam|1999|loc=p. 281}}:\n# For every simple right ''R'' module ''S'', there is a nonzero module [[homomorphism]] from ''M'' into ''R''.\n# The [[maximal ideal|maximal right ideal]]s of ''R'' are right annihilators of ring elements, that is, each one is of the form <math>\\mathrm{r.ann}(x)\\,</math> where ''x'' is in ''R''.\n# For any maximal right ideal ''T'' of ''R'', <math>\\mathrm{\\ell.ann}(T)\\neq\\{0\\}</math>.\n# For any proper right ideal ''T'' of ''R'', <math>\\mathrm{\\ell.ann}(T)\\neq\\{0\\}</math>.\n# For any maximal right ideal ''T'' of ''R'', <math>\\mathrm{r.ann}(\\mathrm{\\ell.ann}(T))=T</math>.\n# ''R'' has no [[dense submodule|dense]] right ideals except ''R'' itself.\n\n==Examples==\nThe content below can be found in references such as {{harv|Faith|1999|loc=p. 109}}, {{harv|Lam|1999|loc=§§8C,19B}}, {{harv|Nicholson|Yousif|2003|loc=p.51}}.\n\n*Let ''R'' be a [[semiprimary ring]] with [[Jacobson radical]] ''J''. If ''R'' is commutative, or if ''R''/''J'' is a [[simple ring]], then ''R'' is right (and left) Kasch. In particular, commutative [[Artinian ring]]s are right and left Kasch.\n* For a division ring ''k'', consider a certain subring ''R'' of the four-by-four matrix ring with entries from ''k''. The subring ''R'' consists of matrices of the following form:\n:: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na & 0 & b & c \\\\\n0 & a & 0 & d \\\\\n0 & 0 & a & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & e \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n:This is a right and left Artinian ring which is right Kasch, but ''not'' left Kasch.\n* Let ''S'' be the ring of [[power series]] on two noncommuting variables ''X'' and ''Y'' with coefficients from a field ''F''. Let the ideal ''A'' be the ideal generated by the two elements ''YX'' and ''Y''<sup>2</sup>. The [[quotient ring]] ''S''/''A'' is a [[local ring]] which is right Kasch but ''not'' left Kasch.\n* Suppose ''R'' is a ring [[direct product]] of infinitely many nonzero rings labeled ''A''<sub>k</sub>. The [[direct sum]] of the ''A''<sub>k</sub> forms a proper ideal of ''R''. It is easily checked that the left and right annihilators of this ideal are zero, and so ''R'' is not right or left Kasch.\n* The two-by-two upper (or lower) [[triangular matrix ring]] is not right or left Kasch.\n* A ring with right [[Socle (mathematics)#Socle of a module|socle]] zero (i.e. <math>\\mathrm{soc}(R_R)=\\{0\\}</math>) cannot be right Kasch, since the ring contains no [[minimal ideal|minimal right ideal]]s. So, for example, [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]s which are not [[division ring]]s are not right or left Kasch.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{citation |author=Faith, Carl |title=Rings and things and a fine array of twentieth century associative algebra |series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs |volume=65 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |place=Providence, RI |year=1999 |pages=xxxiv+422 |isbn=978-0-8218-0993-8 |mr=1657671}}\n*{{citation |author=Kasch, Friedrich |title=Grundlagen einer Theorie der Frobeniuserweiterungen\n|language=German |journal=Math.

There exists an element 1 in ''A'' such that for all ''a'' in ''A'': ''a''1 = 1''a'' = ''a''.\n* [[absorbing element|Annihilation]] by 0: ''a''0 = 0''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''A''.\nThe above axioms define a [[semiring]]. We further require:\n* + is [[idempotent]]: ''a'' + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.\nIt is now possible to define a [[partial order]] ≤ on ''A'' by setting ''a'' ≤ ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' (or equivalently: ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists an ''x'' in ''A'' such that ''a'' + ''x'' = ''b''; with any definition, ''a'' ≤ ''b'' ≤ ''a'' implies ''a'' = ''b''). With this order we can formulate the last four axioms about the operation <sup>*</sup>:\n* 1 + ''a''(''a''<sup>*</sup>) ≤ ''a''<sup>*</sup>  for all ''a'' in ''A''.\n* 1 + (''a''<sup>*</sup>)''a'' ≤ ''a''<sup>*</sup>  for all ''a'' in ''A''.\n* if ''a'' and ''x'' are in ''A'' such that ''ax'' ≤ ''x'', then ''a''<sup>*</sup>''x'' ≤ ''x''\n* if ''a'' and ''x'' are in ''A'' such that ''xa'' ≤ ''x'', then ''x''(''a''<sup>*</sup>) ≤ ''x'' <ref>Kozen (1990), sect.2.1, p.3</ref>\n\nIntuitively, one should think of ''a'' + ''b'' as the \"union\" or the \"least upper bound\" of ''a'' and ''b'' and of ''ab'' as some multiplication which is [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in order theory|monotonic]], in the sense that ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''ax'' ≤ ''bx''. The idea behind the star operator is ''a''<sup>*</sup> = 1 + ''a'' + ''aa'' + ''aaa'' + ... From the standpoint of [[programming language theory]], one may also interpret + as \"choice\", · as \"sequencing\" and <sup>*</sup> as \"iteration\".\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|+ Notational correspondence between \n|-\n!

[[Regular expression#Formal language theory|Regular expressions]] \n| | | || not written  || <sup>*</sup> || ∅  || ε\n|}\nLet Σ be a finite set (an \"alphabet\") and let ''A'' be the set of all [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expression]]s over Σ. We consider two such regular expressions equal if they describe the same [[formal language|language]]. Then ''A'' forms a Kleene algebra. In fact, this is a [[free object|free]] Kleene algebra in the sense that any equation among regular expressions follows from the Kleene algebra axioms and is therefore valid in every Kleene algebra.\n\nAgain let Σ be an alphabet. Let ''A'' be the set of all [[regular language]]s over Σ (or the set of all [[context-free language]]s over Σ; or the set of all [[recursive language]]s over Σ; or the set of ''all'' languages over Σ). Then the [[union (set theory)|union]] (written as +) and the [[concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] (written as ·) of two elements of ''A'' again belong to ''A'', and so does the [[Kleene star]] operation applied to any element of ''A''. We obtain a Kleene algebra ''A'' with 0 being the [[empty set]] and 1 being the set that only contains the [[empty string]].\n\nLet ''M'' be a [[monoid]] with identity element ''e'' and let ''A'' be the set of all [[subset]]s of ''M''. For two such subsets ''S'' and ''T'', let ''S'' + ''T'' be the union of ''S'' and ''T'' and set ''ST'' = {''st'' : ''s'' in ''S'' and ''t'' in ''T''}. ''S''<sup>*</sup> is defined as the submonoid of ''M'' generated by ''S'', which can be described as {''e''} ∪ ''S'' ∪ ''SS'' ∪ ''SSS'' ∪ ... Then ''A'' forms a Kleene algebra with 0 being the empty set and 1 being {''e''}. An analogous construction can be performed for any small [[category theory|category]].\n\nThe [[linear subspace]]s of a unital [[algebra over a field]] form a Kleene algebra.  Given linear subspaces ''V'' and ''W'', define ''V'' + ''W'' to be the sum of the two subspaces, and 0 to be the trivial subspace {0}.  Define ''V'' · ''W'' = span {v · w | v ∈ V, w ∈ W}, the [[linear span]] of the product of vectors from ''V'' and ''W'' respectively.  Define 1 = span {I}, the span of the unit of the algebra.  The closure of ''V'' is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of all powers of ''V''.\n\n:<math>V^{*} = \\bigoplus_{i = 0}^{\\infty} V^{i}</math>\n\nSuppose ''M'' is a set and ''A'' is the set of all [[binary relation]]s on ''M''. Taking + to be the union, · to be the composition and <sup>*</sup> to be the [[reflexive transitive closure]], we obtain a Kleene algebra.\n\nEvery [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with operations <math>\\lor</math> and <math>\\land</math> turns into a Kleene algebra if we use <math>\\lor</math> for +, <math>\\land</math> for · and set ''a''<sup>*</sup> = 1 for all ''a''.\n\nA quite different Kleene algebra can be used to implement the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], computing the [[shortest path problem|shortest path's length]] for every two vertices  of a [[graph theory|weighted directed graph]], by [[Kleene's algorithm]], computing a regular expression for every two states of a [[deterministic finite automaton]].\nUsing the [[extended real number line]], take ''a'' + ''b'' to be the minimum of ''a'' and ''b'' and ''ab'' to be the ordinary sum of ''a'' and ''b'' (with the sum of +∞ and −∞ being defined as +∞). ''a''<sup>*</sup> is defined to be the real number zero for nonnegative ''a'' and −∞ for negative ''a''. This is a Kleene algebra with zero element +∞ and one element the real number zero. \nA weighted directed graph can then be considered as a deterministic finite automaton, with each transition labelled by its weight.\nFor any two graph nodes (automaton states), the regular expressions computed from Kleene's algorithm evaluates, in this particular Kleene algebra, to the shortest path length between the nodes.<ref>{{citation|title=Handbook of Graph Theory|series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|first1=Jonathan L.|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKkIGIea_BkC&pg=PA65|isbn=9780203490204}}.</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\nZero is the smallest element: 0 ≤ ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.\n\nThe sum ''a'' + ''b'' is the [[least upper bound]] of ''a'' and ''b'': we have ''a'' ≤ ''a'' + ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'' + ''b'' and if ''x'' is an element of ''A'' with ''a'' ≤ ''x'' and ''b'' ≤ ''x'', then ''a'' + ''b'' ≤ ''x''.

It consists of a [[partially ordered set]] in which every two elements have a unique [[supremum]] (also called a least upper bound or [[Join and meet|join]]) and a unique [[infimum]] (also called a greatest lower bound or [[Join and meet|meet]]). An example is given by the [[natural number]]s, partially ordered by [[divisibility]], for which the unique supremum is the [[least common multiple]] and the unique infimum is the [[greatest common divisor]].\n\nLattices can also be characterized as [[algebraic structure]]s satisfying certain [[axiom]]atic [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Since the two definitions are equivalent, lattice theory draws on both [[order theory]] and [[universal algebra]]. [[Semilattice]]s include lattices, which in turn include [[Heyting algebra|Heyting]] and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s. These \"lattice-like\" structures all admit [[order theory|order-theoretic]] as well as algebraic descriptions.\n\n== Lattices as partially ordered sets ==\n<!---joined into examples section: [[File:Lattice of partitions of an order 4 set.svg|thumb|360px|The name \"lattice\" is suggested by the form of the [[Hasse diagram]] depicting it.

A set may have many upper bounds, or none at all. An upper bound ''u'' of ''S'' is said to be its '''least upper bound''', or '''[[Join (mathematics)|join]]''', or '''supremum''', if {{nowrap|''u'' ≤ ''x''}} for each upper bound ''x'' of ''S''. A set need not have a least upper bound, but it cannot have more than one. [[duality (order theory)|Dually]], {{nowrap|''l'' ∈ ''L''}} is said to be a '''lower bound''' of ''S'' if {{nowrap|''l'' ≤ ''s''}} for each {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. A lower bound ''l'' of ''S'' is said to be its '''greatest lower bound''', or '''[[meet (mathematics)|meet]]''', or '''infimum''', if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''l''}} for each lower bound ''x'' of ''S''. A set may have many lower bounds, or none at all, but can have at most one greatest lower bound.\n\nA partially ordered set {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called a '''[[join-semilattice]]''' if each two-element subset {{nowrap|{''a'', ''b''} ⊆ ''L''}} has a join (i.e. least upper bound), and is called a '''[[meet-semilattice]]''' if each two-element subset has a meet (i.e. greatest lower bound), denoted by {{nowrap|''a'' ∨ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ∧ ''b''}} respectively. {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called a '''lattice''' if it is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. \nThis definition makes ∨ and ∧ [[binary operation]]s. Both operations are monotone with respect to the order: {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''a''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''b''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>2</sub>}} implies that {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''b''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''a''<sub>2</sub> ∨ ''b''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ''b''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''a''<sub>2</sub> ∧ ''b''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nIt follows by an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument that every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; ''see'' [[Completeness (order theory)]] for more discussion of this subject. That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable [[Galois connection]]s between related partially ordered sets — an approach of special interest for the [[category theory|category theoretic]] approach to lattices, and for [[formal concept analysis]].\n\nA '''bounded lattice''' is a lattice that additionally has a '''[[greatest element|greatest]]''' element (also called '''maximum''', or '''top''' element, and denoted by 1, or by <math>\\top</math>) and a '''[[least element|least]]''' element (also called '''minimum''', or '''bottom''', denoted by 0 or by <math>\\bot</math>), which satisfy\n: 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 for every ''x'' in ''L''.\nEvery lattice can be embedded into a bounded lattice by adding an artificial greatest and least element, and every non-empty finite lattice is bounded, by taking the join (resp., meet) of all elements, denoted by <math>\\bigvee L=a_1\\lor\\cdots\\lor a_n</math> (resp.<math>\\bigwedge L=a_1\\land\\cdots\\land a_n</math>) where <math>L=\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}</math>.\n\nA partially ordered set is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements (including the empty set) has a join and a meet. For every element ''x'' of a poset it is trivially true (it is a [[vacuous truth]]) that \n<math>\\forall a\\in\\varnothing :  x \\le a</math> and\n<math>\\forall a\\in\\varnothing :  a \\le x</math>, and therefore every element of a poset is both an upper bound and a lower bound of the empty set.  This implies that the join of an empty set is the least element <math>\\bigvee\\varnothing=0</math>, and the meet of the empty set is the greatest element <math>\\bigwedge\\varnothing=1</math>. This is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join: the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets, and dually, the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets, i.e., for finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a poset ''L'',\n\n:<math>\\bigvee \\left( A \\cup B \\right)= \\left( \\bigvee A \\right) \\vee \\left( \\bigvee B \\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\bigwedge \\left( A \\cup B \\right)= \\left(\\bigwedge A \\right) \\wedge \\left( \\bigwedge B \\right)</math>\n\nhold.

The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its '''rank'''.\n\nGiven a subset of a lattice, {{nowrap|''H'' ⊂ ''L''}}, meet and join restrict to [[partial function]]s – they are undefined if their value is not in the subset ''H''. The resulting structure on ''H'' is called a '''{{visible anchor|partial lattice}}'''. In addition to this extrinsic definition as a subset of some other algebraic structure (a lattice), a partial lattice can also be intrinsically defined as a set with two partial binary operations satisfying certain axioms.{{sfn|Grätzer|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoGLVCPuOz0C&pg=PA52 52]}}\n\n== Lattices as algebraic structures ==\n\n===General lattice===\nAn [[algebraic structure]] {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}}, consisting of a set ''L'' and two binary [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] ∨, and ∧, on ''L'' is a '''lattice''' if the following axiomatic identities hold for all elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L''.\n\n{| style=\"margin:0em\" cellpadding=0 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|\n;[[commutative property|Commutative laws]]\n:''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ ''a'',\n:''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a''.\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[Associative property|Associative laws]]\n:''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∨ ''c'',\n:''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∧ ''c''.\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[Absorption law]]s:\n:''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''a'',\n:''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''a''.\n|}\n\nThe following two identities are also usually regarded as axioms, even though they follow from the two absorption laws taken together.<ref group=note>{{nowrap|1=''a'' ∨ ''a'' = ''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''a'')) = ''a''}}, and dually for the other idempotent law. {{Citation | last1=Dedekind | first1=Richard | author1-link=Richard Dedekind | title=Über Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre grössten gemeinsamen Teiler | year=1897 | journal=Braunschweiger Festschrift | pages=1–40}}.</ref>\n;[[Idempotence|Idempotent laws]]\n:''a'' ∨ ''a'' = ''a'',\n:''a'' ∧ ''a'' = ''a''.\n\nThese axioms assert that both {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨)}} and {{nowrap|(''L'', ∧)}} are [[semilattice]]s. The absorption laws, the only axioms above in which both meet and join appear, distinguish a lattice from an arbitrary pair of semilattices and assure that the two semilattices interact appropriately. In particular, each semilattice is the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of the other.\n\n===Bounded lattice===\nA '''bounded lattice''' is an algebraic structure of the form {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧, 0, 1)}} such that {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} is a lattice, 0 (the lattice's bottom) is the [[identity element]] for the join operation ∨, and 1 (the lattice's top) is the identity element for the meet operation ∧.\n\n;[[Identity (mathematics)|Identity laws]]\n:''a'' ∨ 0 = ''a'',\n:''a'' ∧ 1 = ''a''.\n\nSee [[semilattice]] for further details.\n\n===Connection to other algebraic structures===\nLattices have some connections to the family of [[magma (algebra)|group-like algebraic structures]]. Because meet and join both commute and associate, a lattice can be viewed as consisting of two commutative [[semigroups]] having the same domain. For a bounded lattice, these semigroups are in fact commutative [[monoid]]s. The [[absorption law]] is the only defining identity that is peculiar to lattice theory.\n\nBy commutativity and associativity one can think of join and meet as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, rather than on elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join and the empty meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.\n\nThe algebraic interpretation of lattices plays an essential role in [[universal algebra]].\n\n== Connection between the two definitions ==\nAn order-theoretic lattice gives rise to the two binary operations ∨ and ∧. Since the commutative, associative and absorption laws can easily be verified for these operations, they make {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} into a lattice in the algebraic sense.\n\nThe converse is also true. Given an algebraically defined lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}}, one can define a partial order ≤ on ''L'' by setting\n: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if  {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b''}}, or\n: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if  {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''}},\nfor all elements ''a'' and ''b'' from ''L''. The laws of absorption ensure that both definitions are equivalent:\n\n''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b'' implies ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''a'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ ''b'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''\n\nand dually for the other direction.\n\nOne can now check that the relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering within which binary meets and joins are given through the original operations ∨ and ∧.\n\nSince the two definitions of a lattice are equivalent, one may freely invoke aspects of either definition in any way that suits the purpose at hand.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:N-Quadrat, gedreht.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.5:''' Lattice of nonnegative integer pairs, ordered componentwise.]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.4:''' Lattice of positive integers, ordered by <.]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:Lattice of partitions of an order 4 set.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.3:''' Lattice of [[partition (set theory)|partition]]s of {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 4},}} ordered by \"''refines''\".]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.2:''' Lattice of integer divisors of 60, ordered by \"''divides''\".]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.1:''' Lattice of subsets of {{nowrap|{x, y, z},}} ordered by \"''is subset of''\".

Pic.2 shows a finite sublattice.\n* Every [[complete lattice]] (also see [[#Completeness|below]]) is a (rather specific) bounded lattice. This class gives rise to a broad range of practical [[Complete lattice#Examples|examples]].\n* The set of [[compact element]]s of an [[arithmetic lattice|arithmetic]] complete lattice is a lattice with a least element, where the lattice operations are given by restricting the respective operations of the arithmetic lattice.

In particular the two-element discrete poset is not a lattice.\n* Although the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 6}{{null}}}} partially ordered by divisibility is a lattice, the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3}{{null}}}} so ordered is not a lattice because the pair 2, 3 lacks a join, and it lacks a meet in {{nowrap|{2, 3, 6}.}}\n* The set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 12, 18, 36}{{null}}}} partially ordered by divisibility is not a lattice.  Every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower bound, but the pair 2, 3 has three upper bounds, namely 12, 18, and 36, none of which is the least of those three under divisibility (12 and 18 do not divide each other).  Likewise the pair 12, 18 has three lower bounds, namely 1, 2, and 3, none of which is the greatest of those three under divisibility (2 and 3 do not divide each other).\n\n<!---stop floating mode before next section--->{{clear}}\n\n== Morphisms of lattices ==\n[[File:Monotonic but nonhomomorphic map between lattices.gif|thumb|'''Pic.9:''' Monotonic map ''f'' between lattices that preserves neither joins nor meets, since {{nowrap|''f''(''u'') ∨ ''f''(''v'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ∨ ''u''′}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ≠ 1′}} {{nowrap|1== ''f''(1) = ''f''(''u'' ∨ ''v'')}} and {{nowrap|''f''(''u'') ∧ ''f''(''v'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ∧ ''u''′}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ≠ 0′}} {{nowrap|1== ''f''(0) = ''f''(''u'' ∧ ''v'')}}.]]\nThe appropriate notion of a [[morphism]] between two lattices flows easily from the [[#Lattices as algebraic structures|above]] algebraic definition. Given two lattices {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨<sub>''L''</sub>, ∧<sub>''L''</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(''M'', ∨<sub>''M''</sub>, ∧<sub>''M''</sub>)}}, a '''lattice homomorphism''' from ''L'' to ''M'' is a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''L'' → ''M''}} such that for all {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''L''}}:\n\n: ''f''(''a'' ∨<sub>''L''</sub> ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∨<sub>''M''</sub> ''f''(''b''), and\n: ''f''(''a'' ∧<sub>''L''</sub> ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∧<sub>''M''</sub> ''f''(''b'').\n\nThus ''f'' is a [[homomorphism]] of the two underlying [[semilattice]]s. When lattices with more structure are considered, the morphisms should \"respect\" the extra structure, too. In particular, a '''bounded-lattice homomorphism''' (usually called just \"lattice homomorphism\") ''f'' between two bounded lattices ''L'' and ''M'' should also have the following property:\n\n: ''f''(0<sub>''L''</sub>) = 0<sub>''M''</sub> , and\n: ''f''(1<sub>''L''</sub>) = 1<sub>''M''</sub> .\n\nIn the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of lattices is a function [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserving]] binary meets and joins. For bounded lattices, preservation of least and greatest elements is just preservation of join and meet of the empty set.\n\nAny homomorphism of lattices is necessarily [[monotone function|monotone]] with respect to the associated ordering relation; see [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preservation of limits]]. The converse is not true: monotonicity by no means implies the required preservation of meets and joins (see pic.9), although an [[Monotonic function|order-preserving]] [[bijection]] is a homomorphism if its [[inverse function|inverse]] is also order-preserving.\n\nGiven the standard definition of [[isomorphism]]s as invertible morphisms, a ''lattice isomorphism'' is just a [[bijective]] lattice homomorphism. Similarly, a ''lattice endomorphism'' is a lattice homomorphism from a lattice to itself, and a ''lattice automorphism'' is a bijective lattice endomorphism.  Lattices and their homomorphisms form a [[category theory|category]].\n\n== Sublattices ==\nA ''sublattice'' of a lattice ''L'' is a nonempty subset of ''L'' that is a lattice with the same meet and join operations as ''L''.  That is, if ''L'' is a lattice and {{nowrap|''M'' ≠ <math>\\varnothing</math>}} is a subset of ''L'' such that for every pair of elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'' both {{nowrap|''a'' ∧ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ∨ ''b''}} are in ''M'', then ''M'' is a sublattice of ''L''.<ref>Burris, Stanley N., and H.P.

One, boundedness, has already been discussed.\n\n=== Completeness ===\n{{main|Complete lattice}}\nA poset is called a '''complete lattice''' if ''all'' its subsets have both a join and a meet. In particular, every complete lattice is a bounded lattice. While bounded lattice homomorphisms in general preserve only finite joins and meets, complete lattice homomorphisms are required to preserve arbitrary joins and meets.\n\nEvery poset that is a complete semilattice is also a complete lattice. Related to this result is the interesting phenomenon that there are various competing notions of homomorphism for this class of posets, depending on whether they are seen as complete lattices, complete join-semilattices, complete meet-semilattices, or as join-complete or meet-complete lattices.\n\nNote that \"partial lattice\" is not the opposite of \"complete lattice\" – rather, \"partial lattice\", \"lattice\", and \"complete lattice\" are increasingly restrictive definitions.\n\n=== Conditional completeness ===\nA '''conditionally complete lattice''' is a lattice in which every ''nonempty'' subset ''that has an upper bound'' has a join (i.e., a least upper bound).  Such lattices provide the most direct generalization of the [[completeness axiom]] of the [[real number]]s.  A conditionally complete lattice is either a complete lattice, or a complete lattice without its maximum element 1, its minimum element 0, or both.\n\n=== Distributivity ===\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n| [[File:N 5 mit Beschriftung.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.11:''' Smallest non-modular (and hence non-distributive) lattice N<sub>5</sub>. <br>The labelled elements violate the distributivity equation {{nowrap|1=''c'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = (''c'' ∧ ''a'') ∨ (''c'' ∧ ''b'')}}, but satisfy its dual {{nowrap|1=''c'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = (''c'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ (''c'' ∨ ''b'')}}.]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n| [[File:M 3 mit Beschriftung.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.10:''' Smallest non-distributive (but modular) lattice M<sub>3</sub>.]]\n|}\n{{main|Distributive lattice}}\nSince lattices come with two binary operations, it is natural to ask whether one of them [[distributivity|distributes]] over the other, i.e. whether one or the other of the following [[duality (order theory)|dual]] laws holds for every three elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L'':\n\n;Distributivity of ∨ over ∧\n: ''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''c'').\n;Distributivity of ∧ over ∨\n: ''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''c'').\n\nA lattice that satisfies the first or, equivalently (as it turns out), the second axiom, is called a '''distributive lattice'''.\nThe only non-distributive lattices with fewer than 6 elements are called M<sub>3</sub> and N<sub>5</sub>;<ref>{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Exercise 4.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&pg=PA104 p.&nbsp;104].</ref> they are shown in picture 10 and 11, respectively.

A lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} is '''modular''' if, for all elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L'', the following identity holds.\n;'''Modular identity''': (''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = [(''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ ''b''] ∧ ''c''.\nThis condition is equivalent to the following axiom.\n;'''Modular law''': {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ ''c''}}.\nA lattice is modular if and only if it doesn't have a [[#Sublattices|sublattice]] isomorphic to N<sub>5</sub> (shown in pic.11).<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.2002.10.6\"/> \nBesides distributive lattices, examples of modular lattices are the lattice of [[two-sided ideal]]s of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], the lattice of submodules of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], and the lattice of [[normal subgroup]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The [[Subsumption lattice|set of first-order terms]] with the ordering \"''is more specific than''\" is a non-modular lattice used in [[automated reasoning]].\n\n===Semimodularity===\n{{main|Semimodular lattice}}\nA finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower [[semimodular lattice|semimodular]]. For a graded lattice, (upper) semimodularity is equivalent to the following condition on the rank function ''r'':\n:''r''(''x'') + ''r''(''y'') ≥ ''r''(''x'' ∧ ''y'') + ''r''(''x'' ∨ ''y'').\nAnother equivalent (for graded lattices) condition is Birkhoff's condition:\n: for each ''x'' and ''y'' in ''L'', if ''x'' and ''y'' both cover {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y''}}, then {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y''}} covers both ''x'' and ''y''.\n\nA lattice is called lower semimodular if its dual is semimodular. For finite lattices this means that the previous conditions hold with ∨ and ∧ exchanged, \"covers\" exchanged with \"is covered by\", and inequalities reversed.<ref>{{Citation | last=Stanley | first=Richard P | authorlink=Richard P.

This leads to the class of [[continuous poset]]s, consisting of posets where every element can be obtained as the supremum of a [[directed set]] of elements that are [[way-below relation|way-below]] the element. If one can additionally restrict these to the [[compact element]]s of a poset for obtaining these directed sets, then the poset is even [[algebraic poset|algebraic]]. Both concepts can be applied to lattices as follows:\n\n* A '''continuous lattice''' is a complete lattice that is continuous as a poset.\n* An '''[[algebraic lattice]]''' is a complete lattice that is algebraic as a poset.\n\nBoth of these classes have interesting properties. For example, continuous lattices can be characterized as algebraic structures (with infinitary operations) satisfying certain identities. While such a characterization is not known for algebraic lattices, they can be described \"syntactically\" via [[Scott information system]]s.\n\n=== Complements and pseudo-complements ===\nLet ''L'' be a bounded lattice with greatest element 1 and least element 0. Two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''L'' are '''complements''' of each other if and only if:\n\n: {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∨ ''y'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''y'' = 0}}.\n\nIn general, some elements of a bounded lattice might not have a complement, and others might have more than one complement. For example, the set {0, ½, 1} with its usual ordering is a bounded lattice, and ½ does not have a complement. In the bounded lattice N<sub>5</sub>, the element ''a'' has two complements, viz. ''b'' and ''c'' (see Pic.11). A bounded lattice for which every element has a complement is called a [[complemented lattice]]. \n\nA complemented lattice that is also distributive is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. For a distributive lattice, the complement of ''x'', when it exists, is unique.\n\nIn the case the complement is unique, we write {{nowrap|1=¬''x'' = ''y''}} and equivalently, {{nowrap|1=¬''y'' = ''x''}}. The corresponding unary [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] over ''L'', called complementation, introduces an analogue of logical [[negation]] into lattice theory.\n\n[[Heyting algebra]]s are an example of distributive lattices where some members might be lacking complements. Every element ''x'' of a Heyting algebra has, on the other hand, a ''pseudo-complement'', also denoted ¬''x''. The pseudo-complement is the greatest element ''y'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''y'' = 0}}. If the pseudo-complement of every element of a Heyting algebra is in fact a complement, then the Heyting algebra is in fact a Boolean algebra.\n\n=== Jordan–Dedekind chain condition ===\nA '''chain''' from ''x''<sub>0</sub> to ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a set <math>\\{ x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}</math>, where <math>x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots < x_n</math>.\nThe '''length''' of this chain is ''n'', or one less than its number of elements. A chain is '''maximal''' if ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> covers ''x''<sub>''i''−1</sub> \nfor all {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}.\n\nIf for any pair, ''x'' and ''y'', where {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}}, all maximal chains from ''x'' to ''y'' have the same length, then the lattice is said to satisfy the '''Jordan–Dedekind chain condition'''.\n\n== Free lattices ==\n{{main|Free lattice}}\nAny set ''X'' may be used to generate the '''free semilattice''' ''FX''. The free semilattice is defined to consist of all of the finite subsets of ''X'', with the semilattice operation given by ordinary [[set union]].  The free semilattice has the [[universal property]]. For the '''free lattice''' over a set ''X'', [[Philip M. Whitman|Whitman]] gave a construction based on polynomials over ''X''{{'}}s members.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Philip Whitman | title=Free Lattices I | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=42 |  pages=325–329 |  year=1941 | doi=10.2307/1969001}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Philip Whitman | title=Free Lattices II | journal=Annals of Mathematics | volume=43 |  pages=104–115 |  year=1942 | doi=10.2307/1968883}}</ref>\n\n== Important lattice-theoretic notions ==\nWe now define some order-theoretic notions of importance to lattice theory. In the following, let ''x'' be an element of some lattice ''L''. If ''L'' has a bottom element 0, {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ 0}} is sometimes required. ''x'' is called:\n*'''Join irreducible''' if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a''}} or {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''b''}} for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''L''. When the first condition is generalized to arbitrary joins <math>\\bigvee_{i \\in I} a_i</math>, ''x'' is called '''completely join irreducible''' (or ∨-irreducible). The dual notion is '''meet irreducibility''' (∧-irreducible). For example, in pic.2, the elements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are join irreducible, while 12, 15, 20, and 30 are meet irreducible. In the lattice of [[real numbers]] with the usual order, each element is join irreducible, but none is completely join irreducible.\n*'''Join prime''' if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a'' ∨ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a''}} or {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''b''}}. This too can be generalized to obtain the notion '''completely join prime'''. The dual notion is '''meet prime'''. Every join-prime element is also join irreducible, and every meet-prime element is also meet irreducible. The converse holds if ''L'' is distributive.\n\nLet ''L'' have a bottom element 0. An element ''x'' of ''L'' is an [[atom (order theory)|atom]] if {{nowrap|0 < ''x''}} and there exists no element ''y'' of ''L'' such that {{nowrap|0 < ''y'' < ''x''}}. Then ''L'' is called:\n* [[atomic (order theory)|Atomic]] if for every nonzero element ''x'' of ''L'', there exists an atom ''a'' of ''L'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''x''}};\n* [[atomic (order theory)|Atomistic]] if every element of ''L'' is a [[supremum]] of atoms.\n\nThe notions of [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]]s and the dual notion of [[filter (mathematics)|filters]] refer to particular kinds of [[subset]]s of a partially ordered set, and are therefore important for lattice theory.

That is, two sentences are equivalent if the theory ''T'' proves that each implies the other. The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this [[congruence relation]].\n\nThe algebra is named for [[logician]]s [[Adolf Lindenbaum]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]. \nIt was first introduced by Tarski in 1935<ref>{{cite book| author=A.

These typically include [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[disjunction]], which are [[well-defined]] on the equivalence classes. When [[negation]] is also present in ''T'', then ''A'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], provided the logic is [[classical logic|classical]]. If the theory ''T'' consists of the [[propositional calculus|propositional tautologies]], the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is the [[free Boolean algebra]] generated by the [[propositional variable]]s.\n\n== Related algebras ==\n\n[[Heyting algebra]]s and [[interior algebra]]s are the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras for [[intuitionistic logic]] and the [[modal logic]] '''S4''', respectively. \n\nA logic for which Tarski's method is applicable, is called ''algebraizable''. There are however a number of logics where this is not the case, for instance the modal logics '''S1''', '''S2''', or '''S3''', which lack the [[rule of necessitation]] (⊢φ implying ⊢□φ), so  ~ (defined above) is not a congruence (because ⊢φ→ψ does not imply ⊢□φ→□ψ). Another type of logics where Tarski's method is inapplicable are [[relevance logic]]s, because given two theorems an implication from one to the other may not itself be a theorem in a relevance logic.<ref name=BP/> The study of the algebraization process (and notion) as topic of interest by itself, not necessarily by Tarski's method, has led to the development of [[abstract algebraic logic]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)]]\n*[[Leibniz operator]]\n*[[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book | author = Hinman, P. | title = Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic | publisher = A K Peters | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-56881-262-0}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra}}\n[[Category:Algebraic logic]]\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]"

In a couple of reviews of subsequent papers in [[Zentralblatt]], Brandt strongly disagreed with this overloading of terminology. The Brandt groupoid is a [[groupoid]] in the sense used in category theory, but not in the sense used by Hausmann and Ore. Nevertheless, influential books in semigroup theory, including [[Alfred Hoblitzelle Clifford|Clifford]] and [[G. B. Preston|Preston]] (1961) and [[John Mackintosh Howie|Howie]] (1995) use groupoid in the sense of Hausmann and Ore.

The symbol, •, is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. To qualify as a magma, the set and operation {{nowrap|(''M'', •)}} must satisfy the following requirement (known as the ''magma or closure axiom''):\n\n: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'', the result of the operation {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} is also in ''M''.\n\nAnd in mathematical notation:\n: <math>a,b \\in M \\implies a \\cdot b \\in M</math>.\n\nIf • is instead a [[partial operation]], then {{math|''S''}} is called a '''partial magma'''<ref name=\"Müller-HoissenPallo2012\">{{citation |editor-first=Folkert |editor-last=Müller-Hoissen |editor2-first=Jean Marcel |editor2-last=Pallo |editor3-first=Jim |editor3-last=Stasheff |title=Associahedra, Tamari Lattices and Related Structures: Tamari Memorial Festschrift |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y01d6g5UemQC&pg=PA11 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-0348-0405-9 |page=11}}</ref> or more often a [[partial groupoid]].<ref name=\"Müller-HoissenPallo2012\"/><ref name=\"Silver\">{{citation |editor-first=Ben |editor-last=Silver |title=Nineteen Papers on Algebraic Semigroups |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=0-8218-3115-1 |last=Evseev |first=A.

Also, the operation, •, is often omitted and notated by juxtaposition:\n: {{math|1= (''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')) • ''d'' = (''a''(''bc''))''d''}}\n\nA shorthand is often used to reduce the number of parentheses, in which the innermost operations and pairs of parentheses are omitted, being replaced just with juxtaposition, {{math|1=''xy'' • ''z'' = (''x'' • ''y'') • ''z''}}. For example, the above is abbreviated to the following expression, still containing parentheses:\n:{{math|1= (''a'' • ''bc'')''d''}}.\nA way to avoid completely the use of parentheses is [[prefix notation]], in which the same expression would be written {{math|1= ••''a''•''bcd''}}.  Another way, familiar to programmers, is [[postfix notation]] ([[Reverse Polish notation]]), in which the same expression would be written {{math|1= ''abc''••''d''•}}, in which the order of execution is simply left-to-right (no [[Currying]]).\n\nThe set of all possible [[string (computer science)|string]]s consisting of symbols denoting elements of the magma, and sets of balanced parentheses is called the [[Dyck language]].  The total number of different ways of writing {{math|''n''}} applications of the magma operator is given by the [[Catalan number]], {{math|''C<sub>n</sub>''}}.  Thus, for example, {{math|1=''C''<sub>2</sub> = 2}}, which is just the statement that {{math|(''ab'')''c''}} and {{math|''a''(''bc'')}} are the only two ways of pairing three elements of a magma with two operations. Less trivially, {{math|1=''C''<sub>3</sub> = 5}}: {{math|((''ab'')''c'')''d''}}, {{math|(''a''(''bc''))''d''}}, {{math|(''ab'')(''cd'')}}, {{math|''a''((''bc'')''d'')}}, and {{math|''a''(''b''(''cd''))}}.\n\nThere are <math>n^{n^2}</math> magmas with <math>n</math> elements so 1, 1, 16, 19683, 4294967296, ... {{OEIS|A002489}} magmas with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... elements.

      "text": "\nIn [[abstract algebra]], a '''matrix field''' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] as elements. In [[field (mathematics)|field theory]] we come across two type of fields: [[finite field]] and [[infinite set|infinite]] field. There are several examples of matrix fields of finite and infinite order. In general, corresponding to each field of numbers there is a matrix field. \n\nThere is a finite matrix field of order ''p'' for each positive [[prime]]&nbsp;''p''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pandey|first1=S. K.|title=Matrix Field of Finite and Infinite Order|journal=International Research Journal of Pure Algebra|volume=5|issue=12|pages=214–216 | year=2015 |}}</ref> One can find several finite matrix field of [[order theory|order]] p for any given positive prime p. In general, corresponding to each finite field there is a matrix field. However any two finite fields of equal order are algebraically equivalent. The [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of a [[finite field]] can be represented by matrices.<ref>{{cite book| | last=Lidl | first=Rudolf | last2=Niederreiter | first2=Harald | author2-link = Harald Niederreiter | title=Introduction to finite fields and their applications| edition=1st | year=1986 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=0-521-30706-6 }}</ref> In this way one can construct a finite matrix field.\n\nContrary to the general case for matrix multiplication, multiplication is [[commutative property|commutative]] in a matrix field (if the usual operations are used). Since addition and multiplication of matrices have all needed properties for field operations except for commutativity of multiplication, one way to verify if a set of matrices is a field with the usual operations of matrix sum and multiplication is to check whether \n\n# the neutral elements for sum and multiplication (that is, the [[zero matrix]] and the [[identity matrix]]) are included; \n# the set is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition and multiplication; and \n# multiplication is commutative. \n\nHowever, it may be possible to construct fields of matrices using other operations -- in which case it would be necessary to verify all properties of the operations in the set in order to guarantee that it is a field.\n\n==Examples==\n1. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[diagonal matrices]] of [[square matrix|order]] n over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational]] ([[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]]) [[number]]s is a matrix field of infinite order under [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of matrices.\n\n2. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all diagonal matrices of order two over the field of [[integer]]s modulo ''p'' (a positive prime) forms a finite matrix field of order ''p'' under [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of matrices modulo ''p''.\n\n3. (a negative example) It does not suffice for multiplication to commute in order to obtain a field of matrices. Take the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all <math>n\\times n</math> matrices of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na      & a      & \\cdots & a \\\\\n0      & 0      &        & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\ddots &   \\\\\n0      & 0      & \\cdots & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nwith <math>a\\in \\mathbb{R}</math> -- that is, matrices filled with zeroes except for the <math>i</math>-th row, which is filled with the same real constant <math>k</math>.\nThese matrices are commutative for multiplication:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na      & a      & \\cdots & a \\\\\n0      & 0      &        & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\ddots &   \\\\\n0      & 0      & \\cdots & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb      & b      & \\cdots & b \\\\\n0      & 0      &        & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\ddots &   \\\\\n0      & 0      & \\cdots & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\begin{pmatrix}\nb      & b      & \\cdots & b \\\\\n0      & 0      &        & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\ddots &   \\\\\n0      & 0      & \\cdots & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na      & a      & \\cdots & a \\\\\n0      & 0      &        & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\ddots &   \\\\\n0      & 0      & \\cdots & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nab      & ab      & \\cdots & ab \\\\\n0      & 0      &        & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\ddots &   \\\\\n0      & 0      & \\cdots & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nHowever, there is no neutral element for multiplication, since this needs to be the identity matrix, and it is not included in the set, so this is ''not'' a matrix field.\n\n4. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all matrices of order two of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & bc \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nover the [[real number|real numbers]] (or over any other [[field (mathematics)|field]]), with the usual operations of matrix sum and matrix multiplication.\nThe zero matrix (<math>a=b=0</math>) and the identity matrix (<math>a=1, b=0</math>) are included. Summing two of these matrices results in another matrix of the same form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & bc \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx & yc \\\\\ny & x\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na+x & c(b+y) \\\\\nb+y & a+x\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe same is true for multiplication:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & bc \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx & yc \\\\\ny & x\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nbcy+ax & c(ay+bx) \\\\\nay+bx  & bcy+ax\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nFinally, multiplication is commutative for these matrices:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & bc \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx & yc \\\\\ny & x\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nbcy+ax & c(ay+bx) \\\\\nay+bx  & bcy+ax\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx & yc \\\\\ny & x\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & bc \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\n5. As a particular case of example 4, taking <math>c=-1</math> and <math>a, b</math> ranging over the reals, one obtains the field of matrices of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & -b \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhich is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the field <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> of the [[complex number|complex numbers]]: <math>a</math> corresponds to the real part of the number, while <math>b</math> correspods to the imaginary part. So the number <math>2+3i</math>, for example, would be represented as\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & -3 \\\\\n3 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nOne can easily verify, for example, that <math>i^2 = -1</math>:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}^2\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nand also, by computing a [[matrix exponential]], that [[euler's identity|Euler's identity, <math>e^{i\\pi}=-1</math>]] is also valid:\n:<math>\ne^{\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\pi & 0 \\\\\n0   & \\pi\n\\end{pmatrix}}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n6.

      "text": "{{Redirect|Matrix algebra|the algebraic theory of matrices|Matrix (mathematics)|and|Linear algebra}}\n\nIn [[abstract algebra]], a '''matrix ring''' is any collection of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some ring ''R'' that form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]] {{harv|Lam|1999}}. The set of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with entries from ''R'' is a matrix ring denoted M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), as well as some subsets of infinite matrices which form '''infinite matrix rings'''. Any subring of a matrix ring is a matrix ring.\n\nWhen ''R'' is a commutative ring, the matrix ring M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is an [[associative algebra]], and may be called a '''matrix algebra'''.  For this case, if ''M'' is a matrix and ''r'' is in ''R'', then the matrix ''Mr'' is the matrix ''M'' with each of its entries multiplied by ''r''.\n\nThis article assumes that ''R'' is an [[associative ring]] with a unit {{nowrap|1 ≠ 0}}, although matrix rings can be formed over rings without unity.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices over an arbitrary ring ''R'', denoted M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'').  This is usually referred to as the \"full ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices\".  These matrices represent endomorphisms of the free module ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n* The set of all upper (or set of all lower) [[triangular matrices]] over a ring.\n* If ''R'' is any ring with unity, then the ring of endomorphisms of <math>M=\\bigoplus_{i\\in I}R</math> as a right ''R''-module is isomorphic to the ring of '''column finite matrices''' <math>\\mathbb{CFM}_I(R)\\,</math> whose entries are indexed by {{nowrap|''I'' × ''I''}}, and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries.  The endomorphisms of ''M'' considered as a left ''R'' module result in an analogous object, the '''row finite matrices''' <math>\\mathbb{RFM}_I(R)</math> whose rows each only have finitely many nonzero entries.\n* If ''R'' is a [[Banach algebra]], then the condition of row or column finiteness in the previous point can be relaxed.  With the norm in place, [[absolutely convergent series]] can be used instead of finite sums.  For example, the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring.  Analogously of course, the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring.  This idea can be used to represent [[Hilbert space#Operators on Hilbert spaces|operators on Hilbert spaces]], for example.\n* The intersection of the row and column finite matrix rings also forms a ring, which can be denoted by <math>\\mathbb{RCFM}_I(R)</math>.\n* The algebra M<sub>2</sub>('''R''') of [[2 × 2 real matrices]], which is [[ring isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[split-quaternion]]s, is a simple example of a non-commutative associative algebra. Like the [[quaternion]]s, it has [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] 4 over '''R''', but unlike the quaternions, it has [[zero divisor]]s, as can be seen from the following product of the [[matrix unit]]s: {{nowrap|1=''E''<sub>11</sub>''E''<sub>21</sub> = 0}}, hence it is not a [[division ring]]. Its invertible elements are [[nonsingular matrix|nonsingular matrices]] and they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}.\n*If ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]], the matrix ring has a structure of a [[*-algebra]] over ''R'', where the [[involution (mathematics)#Ring theory|involution]] * on M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is the [[matrix transpose|matrix transposition]]. \n*If ''A'' is a [[C*-algebra]], then M<sub>n</sub>(''A'') consists of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with entries from the C*-algebra ''A'', which is itself a C*-algebra. If ''A'' is non-unital, then M<sub>n</sub>(''A'') is also non-unital. Viewing ''A'' as a norm-closed subalgebra of the continuous operators ''B''(''H'') for some Hilbert space ''H'' (that there exists such a Hilbert space and isometric *-isomorphism is the content of the [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]]), we can identify M<sub>n</sub>(''A'') with a subalgebra of ''B''(''H''<sup><math>\\oplus n</math></sup>). For simplicity, if we further suppose that ''H'' is separable and ''A'' <math>\\subseteq</math> ''B''(''H'') is a unital C*-algebra, we can break up ''A'' into a matrix ring over a smaller C*-algebra. One can do so by fixing a [[Projection_(linear_algebra)#Orthogonal_projections|projection]] ''p'' and hence its orthogonal projection 1 - ''p''; one can identify ''A'' with <math>\\begin{pmatrix} pAp & pA(1-p) \\\\ (1-p)Ap & (1-p)A(1-p) \\end{pmatrix}</math>, where matrix multiplication works as intended because of the orthogonality of the projections. In order to identify ''A'' with a matrix ring over a C*-algebra, we require that ''p'' and 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''p'' have the same ″rank″; more precisely, we need that ''p'' and 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''p'' are Murray–von Neumann equivalent, i.e. there exists a [[partial isometry]] ''u'' such that ''p'' = ''uu''* and 1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''p'' = ''u''*''u''. One can easily generalize this to matrices of larger sizes.\n* Complex matrix algebras M<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') are, up to isomorphism, the only simple associative algebras over the field '''C''' of [[complex number]]s. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the matrix algebra M<sub>''2''</sub>('''C''') plays an important role in the theory of [[angular momentum]]. It has an alternative basis given by the [[identity matrix]] and the three [[Pauli matrices]]. ''M''<sub>''2''</sub>('''C''') was the scene of early abstract algebra in the form of [[biquaternion]]s.\n* A matrix ring over a field is a [[Frobenius algebra]], with Frobenius form given by the trace of the product: {{nowrap|1=''σ''(''A'', ''B'') = tr(''AB'')}}.\n\n==Structure==\n* The matrix ring M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') can be identified with the [[ring of endomorphisms]] of the [[free module|free ''R''-module]] of rank ''n'', {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') ≅ End<sub>''R''</sub>(''R''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}.{{clarify|Is R^n here a right module?|date=June 2017}} The procedure for [[matrix multiplication]] can be traced back to compositions of endomorphisms in this endomorphism ring.\n* The ring M<sub>''n''</sub>(''D'') over a [[division ring]] ''D'' is an [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] [[simple ring]], a special type of [[semisimple ring]].  The rings <math>\\mathbb{CFM}_I(D)</math> and <math>\\mathbb{RFM}_I(D)</math> are ''not'' simple and not Artinian if the set ''I'' is infinite, however they are still [[full linear ring]]s.\n* In general, every semisimple ring is isomorphic to a finite direct product of full matrix rings over division rings, which may have differing division rings and differing sizes.  This classification is given by the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]].\n* There is a one-to-one correspondence between the two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') and the two-sided ideals of ''R''.  Namely, for each ideal ''I'' of ''R'', the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''I'' is an ideal of M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), and each ideal of M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') arises in this way.  This implies that M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is [[simple ring|simple]] if and only if ''R'' is simple. For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, not every left ideal or right ideal of M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') arises by the previous construction from a left ideal or a right ideal in ''R''. For example, the set of matrices whose columns with indices 2 through ''n'' are all zero forms a left ideal in M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'').\n* The previous ideal correspondence actually arises from the fact that the rings ''R'' and M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') are [[Morita equivalent]]. Roughly speaking, this means that the category of left ''R'' modules and the category of left M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') modules are very similar. Because of this, there is a natural bijective correspondence between the ''isomorphism classes'' of the left ''R''-modules and the left M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')-modules, and between the isomorphism classes of the left ideals of ''R'' and M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''). Identical statements hold for right modules and right ideals.  Through Morita equivalence, M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') can inherit any properties of ''R'' which are Morita invariant, such as being [[simple ring|simple]], [[Artinian ring|Artinian]], [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]], [[Prime ring|prime]] and numerous other properties as given in the [[Morita equivalence]] article.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n* The matrix ring ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is [[commutative ring|commutative]] if and only if ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]] and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}. In fact, this is also true for the subring of upper triangular matrices.  Here is an example for 2×2 matrices (in fact, upper triangular matrices) which do not commute:\n::<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 \n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\\,\n</math>\nand \n:: <math>  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0 \n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\\,\n</math>\n: This example is easily generalized to ''n''×''n'' matrices.\n* For ''n'' &ge; 2, the matrix ring M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') has [[zero divisor]]s and [[nilpotent element]]s, and again, the same thing can be said for the upper triangular matrices. An example in 2×2 matrices would be\n:: <math>  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0 \n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\\,\n</math>.\n\n* The [[center (ring theory)|center]] of a matrix ring over a ring ''R'' consists of the matrices which are scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]], where the scalar belongs to the center of ''R''.\n* In linear algebra, it is noted that over a field ''F'', M<sub>''n''</sub>(''F'') has the property that for any two matrices ''A'' and ''B'', {{nowrap|1=''AB'' = 1}} implies {{nowrap|1=''BA'' = 1}}.  This is not true for every ring ''R'' though.  A ring ''R'' whose matrix rings all have the mentioned property is known as a [[stably finite ring]] {{harv|Lam|1999|p=5}}.\n\n==Diagonal subring==\n\nLet ''D'' be the set of [[diagonal matrices]] in the matrix ring M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''), that is the set of the matrices such that every nonzero entry, if any, is on the main diagonal.  Then ''D'' is closed under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]], and contains the [[identity matrix]], so it is a [[subalgebra]] of ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'').\n\nAs an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra over R]], ''D'' is [[algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[product of rings|direct product]] of ''n'' copies of ''R''. It is a [[free module|free ''R''-module]] of dimension ''n''. The [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s of ''D'' are the diagonal matrices such that the diagonal entries are themselves idempotent.\n\n===Two dimensional diagonal subrings===\nWhen ''R'' is the field of [[real number]]s, then the diagonal subring of M<sub>2</sub>(''R'') is isomorphic to [[split-complex number]]s. When ''R'' is the field of [[complex number]]s, then the diagonal subring is isomorphic to [[bicomplex number]]s. When ''R'' = ℍ, the [[division ring]] of [[quaternion]]s, then the diagonal subring is isomorphic to the ring of [[split-biquaternion]]s, presented in 1873 by [[William K. Clifford]].\n\n==Matrix semiring==\nIn fact, ''R'' only needs to be a [[semiring]] for M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') to be defined. In this case, M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is a semiring, called the '''matrix semiring'''. Similarly, if ''R'' is a commutative semiring, then M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is a '''{{visible anchor|matrix semialgebra}}'''.\n\nFor example, if ''R'' is the [[Boolean semiring]] (the [[Two-element Boolean algebra]] ''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{0,1} with 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), then M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is the semiring of [[binary relation]]s on an ''n''-element set with union as addition, [[composition of relations]] as multiplication, the [[empty relation]] ([[zero matrix]]) as the zero, and the [[identity relation]] ([[identity matrix]]) as the unit.<ref name=\"droste\">Droste, M., & Kuich, W.

A '''module over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> is a generalization of the notion of [[vector space]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], wherein the corresponding [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] are the elements of an arbitrary given ring (with identity) and a multiplication (on the left and/or on the right) is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module.\n\nThus, a module, like a vector space, is an additive [[abelian group]]; a product is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module that is distributive over the addition operation of each parameter and is [[Semigroup action|compatible]] with the ring multiplication.\n\nModules are very closely related to the [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. They are also one of the central notions of [[commutative algebra]] and [[homological algebra]], and are used widely in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]].\n\n== Introduction and definition ==\n\n=== Motivation ===\nIn a vector space, the set of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and acts on the vectors by scalar multiplication, subject to certain axioms such as the [[distributive law]].  In a module, the scalars need only be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], so the module concept represents a significant generalization.  In commutative algebra, both [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] and [[quotient ring]]s are modules, so that many arguments about ideals or quotient rings can be combined into a single argument about modules.  In non-commutative algebra the distinction between left ideals, ideals, and modules becomes more pronounced, though some ring-theoretic conditions can be expressed either about left ideals or left modules.<!-- (semi)perfect rings for instance have a litany of \"Foo is true for all left ideals iff foo is true for all finitely generated left ideals iff foo is true for all cyclic modules iff foo is true for all modules\" -->\n\nMuch of the theory of modules consists of extending as many of the desirable properties of vector spaces as possible to the realm of modules over a \"[[well-behaved]]\" ring, such as a [[principal ideal domain]]. However, modules can be quite a bit more complicated than vector spaces; for instance, not all modules have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], and even those that do, [[free module]]s, need not have a unique rank if the underlying ring does not satisfy the [[invariant basis number]] condition, unlike vector spaces, which always have a (possibly infinite) basis whose cardinality is then unique. (These last two assertions require the [[axiom of choice]] in general, but not in the case of finite-dimensional spaces, or certain well-behaved infinite-dimensional spaces such as [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> space]]s.)\n\n=== Formal definition ===\nSuppose that ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and 1<sub>''R''</sub> is its multiplicative identity.\nA '''left ''R''-module''' ''M'' consists of an  [[abelian group]] {{nowrap|(''M'', +)}} and an operation {{nowrap|⋅ : ''R'' × ''M'' → ''M''}} such that for all ''r'', ''s'' in ''R'' and ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'', we have:\n#<math> r \\cdot ( x + y ) = r \\cdot x + r \\cdot y </math>\n#<math> ( r + s ) \\cdot x = r \\cdot x + s \\cdot x </math>\n#<math> ( r s ) \\cdot x = r \\cdot ( s \\cdot x ) </math>\n#<math> 1_R \\cdot x = x .</math>\n\nThe operation of the ring on ''M'' is called ''scalar multiplication'', and is usually written by juxtaposition, i.e. as ''rx'' for ''r'' in ''R'' and ''x'' in ''M'', though here it is denoted as {{nowrap|''r'' ⋅ ''x''}} to distinguish it from the ring multiplication operation, denoted here by juxtaposition. The notation <sub>''R''</sub>''M'' indicates a left ''R''-module ''M''. A '''right ''R''-module''' ''M'' or ''M''<sub>''R''</sub> is defined similarly, except that the ring acts on the right; i.e., scalar multiplication takes the form {{nowrap|⋅ : ''M'' × ''R'' → ''M''}}, and the above axioms are written with scalars ''r'' and ''s'' on the right of ''x'' and ''y''.\n\nAuthors who do not require rings to be [[unital algebra|unital]] omit condition 4 above in the definition of an ''R''-module, and so would call the structures defined above \"unital left ''R''-modules\". In this article, consistent with the [[glossary of ring theory]], all rings and modules are assumed to be unital.<ref name=\"DummitFoote\">{{cite book | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |author1=Dummit, David S.  |author2=Foote, Richard M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | location=Hoboken, NJ | isbn=978-0-471-43334-7}}</ref>\n\nIf one writes the scalar action as ''f''<sub>''r''</sub> so that {{nowrap|1=''f''<sub>''r''</sub>(''x'') = ''r'' ⋅ ''x''}}, and ''f'' for the map that takes each ''r'' to its corresponding map ''f''<sub>''r''</sub>&nbsp;, then the first axiom states that every ''f''<sub>''r''</sub> is a [[endomorphism|group endomorphism]] of ''M'', and the other three axioms assert that the map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''R'' → End(''M'')}} given by {{nowrap|''r'' ↦ ''f''<sub>''r''</sub>}}  is a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to the [[endomorphism ring]] End(''M'').<ref>This is the endomorphism ring of the additive group ''M''. If ''R'' is commutative, then these endomorphisms are additionally ''R'' linear.</ref>  Thus a module is a ring action on an abelian group (cf. [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]. Also consider [[monoid action]] of multiplicative structure of ''R'').  In this sense, module theory generalizes [[representation theory]], which deals with group actions on vector spaces, or equivalently [[group ring]] actions.\n\nA [[bimodule]] is a module that is a left module and a right module such that the two multiplications are compatible.\n\nIf ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]], then left ''R''-modules are the same as right ''R''-modules and are simply called ''R''-modules.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n*If ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then ''K''-[[vector space]]s (vector spaces over ''K'') and ''K''-modules are identical.\n*If ''K'' is a field, and ''K''[''x''] a univariate [[polynomial ring]], then a [[Polynomial ring#Modules|''K''[''x'']-module]] ''M'' is a ''K''-module with an additional action of ''x'' on ''M'' that commutes with the action of ''K'' on ''M''. In other words, a ''K''[''x'']-module is a ''K''-vector space ''M'' combined with a linear map from ''M'' to ''M''. Applying the [[Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]] to this example shows the existence of the [[Rational canonical form|rational]] and [[Jordan normal form|Jordan canonical]] forms.\n*The concept of a '''Z'''-module agrees with the notion of an abelian group. That is, every [[abelian group]] is a module over the ring of [[integer]]s '''Z''' in a unique way. For {{nowrap|''n'' > 0}}, let {{nowrap|1=''n'' ⋅ ''x'' = ''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x''}} (''n'' summands), {{nowrap|1=0 ⋅ ''x'' = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1=(−''n'') ⋅ ''x'' = −(''n'' ⋅ ''x'')}}. Such a module need not have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]—groups containing [[torsion element]]s do not. (For example, in the group of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 3, one cannot find even one element which satisfies the definition of a linearly independent set since when an integer such as 3 or 6 multiplies an element, the result is 0. However, if a [[finite field]] is considered as a module over the same finite field taken as a ring, it is a vector space and does have a basis.)\n*The [[decimal fractions]] (including negative ones) form a module over the integers. Only [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] are linearly independent sets, but there is no singleton that can serve as a basis, so the module has no basis and no rank.\n*If ''R'' is any ring and ''n'' a [[natural number]], then the [[cartesian product]] ''R''<sup>''n''</sup> is both a left and right ''R''-module over if we use the component-wise operations. Hence when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}, ''R'' is an ''R''-module, where the scalar multiplication is just ring multiplication. The case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 0}} yields the trivial ''R''-module {0} consisting only of its identity element. Modules of this type are called [[free module|free]] and if ''R'' has [[invariant basis number]] (e.g. any commutative ring or field) the number ''n'' is then the rank of the free module.\n*If M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') is the ring of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices over a ring ''R'', ''M'' is an M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')-module, and ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> is the {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrix with 1 in the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''i'')}}-entry (and zeros elsewhere), then ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>''M'' is an ''R''-module, since {{nowrap|1=''re''<sub>''i''</sub>''m'' = ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>''rm'' ∈ ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>''M''}}. So ''M'' breaks up as the direct sum of ''R''-modules, {{nowrap|1=''M'' = ''e''<sub>1</sub>''M'' ⊕ ... ⊕ ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''M''}}. Conversely, given an ''R''-module ''M''<sub>0</sub>, then ''M''<sub>0</sub><sup>⊕''n''</sup> is an M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')-module. In fact, the category of ''R''-modules and the category of M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')-modules are equivalent. The special case is that the module ''M'' is just ''R'' as a module over itself, then ''R''<sup>''n''</sup> is an M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')-module.\n*If ''S'' is a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]], ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, and ''M''<sup>''S''</sup> is the collection of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S'' → ''M''}}, then with addition and scalar multiplication in ''M''<sup>''S''</sup> defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''s'') = ''f''(''s'') + ''g''(''s'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''rf'')(''s'') = ''rf''(''s'')}}, ''M''<sup>''S''</sup> is a left ''R''-module.  The right ''R''-module case is analogous.  In particular, if ''R'' is commutative then the collection of ''R-module homomorphisms'' {{nowrap|''h'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} (see below) is an ''R''-module (and in fact a ''submodule'' of ''N''<sup>''M''</sup>).\n*If ''X'' is a [[smooth manifold]], then the [[smooth function]]s from ''X'' to the [[real number]]s form a ring ''C''<sup>∞</sup>(''X''). The set of all smooth [[vector field]]s defined on ''X'' form a module over ''C''<sup>∞</sup>(''X''), and so do the [[tensor field]]s and the [[differential form]]s on ''X''.  More generally, the sections of any [[vector bundle]] form a [[projective module]] over ''C''<sup>∞</sup>(''X''), and by [[Swan's theorem]], every projective module is isomorphic to the module of sections of some bundle; the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of ''C''<sup>∞</sup>(''X'')-modules and the category of vector bundles over ''X'' are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]].\n*If ''R'' is any ring and ''I'' is any [[ring ideal|left ideal]] in ''R'', then ''I'' is a left ''R''-module, and analogously right ideals in ''R'' are right ''R''-modules.\n*If ''R'' is a ring, we can define the ring ''R''<sup>op</sup> which has the same underlying set and the same addition operation, but the opposite multiplication:  if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = ''c''}} in ''R'', then {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''c''}} in ''R''<sup>op</sup>.  Any ''left'' ''R''-module ''M'' can then be seen to be a ''right'' module over ''R''<sup>op</sup>, and any right module over ''R'' can be considered a left module over ''R''<sup>op</sup>.\n* There are [[Glossary of Lie algebras#Representation theory|modules of a Lie algebra]] as well.\n\n== Submodules and homomorphisms ==\n\nSuppose ''M'' is a left ''R''-module and ''N'' is a [[subgroup]] of ''M''.  Then ''N'' is a '''submodule''' (or more explicitly an ''R''-submodule) if for any ''n'' in ''N'' and any ''r'' in ''R'', the product {{nowrap|''r'' ⋅ ''n''}} is in ''N'' (or {{nowrap|''n'' ⋅ ''r''}} for a right ''R''-module).\n\nThe set of submodules of a given module ''M'', together with the two binary operations + and ∩, forms a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] which satisfies the '''[[modular lattice|modular law]]''':\nGiven submodules ''U'', ''N''<sub>1</sub>, ''N''<sub>2</sub> of ''M'' such that {{nowrap|''N''<sub>1</sub> ⊂ ''N''<sub>2</sub>}}, then the following two submodules are equal: {{nowrap|1=(''N''<sub>1</sub> + ''U'') ∩ ''N''<sub>2</sub> = ''N''<sub>1</sub> + (''U'' ∩ ''N''<sub>2</sub>)}}.\n\nIf ''M'' and ''N'' are left ''R''-modules, then a [[map (mathematics)|map]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a '''[[module homomorphism|homomorphism of ''R''-modules]]''' if for any ''m'', ''n'' in ''M'' and ''r'', ''s'' in ''R'',\n:<math>f(r \\cdot m + s \\cdot n) = r \\cdot f(m) + s \\cdot f(n)</math>.\nThis, like any [[homomorphism]] of mathematical objects, is just a mapping which preserves the structure of the objects.  Another name for a homomorphism of ''R''-modules is an ''R''-[[linear map]].\n\nA [[bijective]] module homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] of modules, and the two modules are called ''isomorphic''. Two isomorphic modules are identical for all practical purposes, differing solely in the notation for their elements.\n\nThe [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of a module homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is the submodule of ''M'' consisting of all elements that are sent to zero by ''f''. The [[isomorphism theorem]]s familiar from groups and vector spaces are also valid for ''R''-modules.\n\nGiven a ring ''R'', the set of all left ''R''-modules together with their module homomorphisms forms an [[abelian category|abelian]] [[category theory|category]], denoted by ''R''-'''Mod''' (see [[category of modules]]).\n\n== Types of modules ==\n\n'''Finitely generated.''' An ''R''-module ''M'' is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] if there exist finitely many elements ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> in ''M'' such that every element of ''M'' is a [[linear combination]] of those elements with coefficients from the ring ''R''.\n\n'''Cyclic.''' A module is called a [[cyclic module]] if it is generated by one element.\n\n'''Free.''' A [[free module|free ''R''-module]] is a module that has a basis, or equivalently, one that is isomorphic to a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of copies of the ring ''R''. These are the modules that behave very much like vector spaces.\n\n'''Projective.''' [[Projective module]]s are [[direct summand]]s of free modules and share many of their desirable properties.\n\n'''Injective.''' [[Injective module]]s are defined dually to projective modules.\n\n'''Flat.''' A module is called [[flat module|flat]] if taking the [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]] of it with any [[exact sequence]] of ''R''-modules preserves exactness.\n\n'''Torsionless module.''' A module is called [[torsionless module|torsionless]] if it embeds into its algebraic dual.\n\n'''Simple.''' A [[simple module]] ''S'' is a module that is not {0} and whose only submodules are {0} and ''S''.  Simple modules are sometimes called ''irreducible''.<ref>Jacobson (1964), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KlMDjaJxZAkC&pg=PA4 p. 4], Def. 1; {{PlanetMath|urlname=IrreducibleModule|title=Irreducible Module}}</ref>\n\n'''Semisimple.''' A [[semisimple module]] is a direct sum (finite or not) of simple modules.  Historically these modules are also called ''completely reducible''.\n\n'''Indecomposable.''' An [[indecomposable module]] is a non-zero module that cannot be written as a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of two non-zero submodules. Every simple module is indecomposable, but there are indecomposable modules which are not simple (e.g. [[uniform module]]s).\n\n'''Faithful.''' A [[faithful module]] ''M'' is one where the action of each {{nowrap|''r'' ≠ 0}} in ''R'' on ''M'' is nontrivial (i.e. {{nowrap|''r'' ⋅ ''x'' ≠ 0}} for some ''x'' in ''M'').  Equivalently, the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of ''M'' is the zero ideal.\n\n'''Torsion-free.''' A [[torsion-free module]] is a module over a ring such that 0 is the only element annihilated by a regular element (non zero-divisor) of the ring.\n\n'''Noetherian.''' A [[Noetherian module]] is a module which satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on submodules, that is, every increasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.  Equivalently, every submodule is finitely generated.\n\n'''Artinian.''' An [[Artinian module]] is a module which satisfies the [[descending chain condition]] on submodules, that is, every decreasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.\n\n'''Graded.''' A [[graded module]] is a module with a decomposition as a direct sum {{nowrap|1=''M'' = {{resize|140%|⨁}}<sub>''x''</sub> ''M''<sub>''x''</sub>}} over a [[graded ring]] {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {{resize|140%|⨁}}<sub>''x''</sub> ''R''<sub>''x''</sub>}} such that {{nowrap|''R''<sub>''x''</sub>''M''<sub>''y''</sub> ⊂ ''M''<sub>''x''+''y''</sub>}} for all ''x'' and ''y''.\n\n'''Uniform.'''  A [[uniform module]] is a module in which all pairs of nonzero submodules have nonzero intersection.\n\n== Further notions ==\n\n=== Relation to representation theory ===\n\nIf ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, then the ''action'' of an element ''r'' in ''R'' is defined to be the map {{nowrap|''M'' → ''M''}} that sends each ''x'' to ''rx'' (or ''xr'' in the case of a right module), and is necessarily a [[group homomorphism|group endomorphism]] of the abelian group {{nowrap|(''M'', +)}}.  The set of all group endomorphisms of ''M'' is denoted End<sub>'''Z'''</sub>(''M'') and forms a ring under addition and composition, and sending a ring element ''r'' of ''R'' to its action actually defines a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to End<sub>'''Z'''</sub>(''M'').\n\nSuch a ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' → End<sub>'''Z'''</sub>(''M'')}} is called a ''representation'' of ''R'' over the abelian group ''M''; an alternative and equivalent way of defining left ''R''-modules is to say that a left ''R''-module is an abelian group ''M'' together with a representation of ''R'' over it.\n\nA representation is called ''faithful'' if and only if the map {{nowrap|''R'' → End<sub>'''Z'''</sub>(''M'')}} is [[injective]]. In terms of modules, this means that if ''r'' is an element of ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''rx'' = 0}} for all ''x'' in ''M'', then {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 0}}. Every abelian group is a faithful module over the [[integer]]s or over some [[modular arithmetic]] '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nAny ring ''R'' can be viewed as a [[preadditive category]] with a single object. With this understanding, a left ''R''-module is just a covariant [[additive functor]] from ''R'' to the category '''Ab''' of abelian groups, and right ''R''-modules are contravariant additive functors. This suggests that, if ''C'' is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from ''C'' to '''Ab''' should be considered a generalized left module over ''C''. These functors form a [[functor category]] ''C''-'''Mod''' which is the natural generalization of the module category ''R''-'''Mod'''.\n\nModules over ''commutative'' rings can be generalized in a different direction: take a [[ringed space]] (''X'', O<sub>''X''</sub>) and consider the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of O<sub>''X''</sub>-modules (see [[sheaf of modules]]). These form a category O<sub>''X''</sub>-'''Mod''', and play an important role in modern [[algebraic geometry]]. If ''X'' has only a single point, then this is a module category in the old sense over the commutative ring O<sub>''X''</sub>(''X'').\n\nOne can also consider modules over a [[semiring]]. Modules over rings are abelian groups, but modules over semirings are only [[commutative]] [[monoid]]s. Most applications of modules are still possible. In particular, for any [[semiring]] ''S'', the matrices over ''S'' form a semiring over which the tuples of elements from ''S'' are a module (in this generalized sense only). This allows a further generalization of the concept of [[vector space]] incorporating the semirings from theoretical computer science.\n\nOver [[near-rings]], one can consider near-ring modules, a nonabelian generalization of modules.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[group ring]]\n* [[algebra (ring theory)]]\n* [[module (model theory)]]\n* [[module spectrum]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* F.W.

[[Trace monoid]]s and [[history monoid]]s provide a foundation for [[process calculi]] and [[concurrent computing]].\n\nIn [[theoretical computer science]], the study of monoids is fundamental for [[automata theory]] ([[Krohn–Rhodes theory]]), and [[formal language theory]] ([[star height problem]]).\n\nSee [[Semigroup]] the history of the subject, and some more general properties of monodies.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nSuppose that ''S'' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] and • is some [[binary operation]] {{math|1=''S'' × ''S'' → ''S''}}, then ''S'' with • is a '''monoid''' if it satisfies the following two axioms:\n\n; Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S'', the equation {{math|1=(''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')}} holds.\n; Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''S'' such that for every element ''a'' in ''S'', the equations {{math|1=''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''}} hold.\n\nIn other words, a monoid is a [[semigroup]] with an [[identity element]]. It can also be thought of as a [[magma (algebra)|magma]] with associativity and identity. The identity element of a monoid is unique.<ref>If both ''e''<sub>1</sub> and ''e''<sub>2</sub> satisfy the above equations, then ''e''<sub>1</sub> = ''e''<sub>1</sub> • ''e''<sub>2</sub> = ''e''<sub>2</sub>.</ref>  For this reason the identity is regarded as a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], i. e. 0-ary (or nullary) operation. The monoid therefore is characterized by specification of the [[Tuple|triple]] (''S'', • , ''e'').\n\nDepending on the context, the symbol for the binary operation may be omitted, so that the operation is denoted by juxtaposition; for example, the monoid axioms may be written <math>(ab)c = a(bc)</math> and <math>ea=ae=a</math>. This notation does not imply that it is numbers being multiplied.\n\nA monoid in which each element has an [[inverse element|inverse]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]].\n\n== Monoid structures ==\n\n===Submonoids===\nA '''submonoid''' of a monoid {{math|(''M'', •)}} is a [[subset]] ''N'' of ''M'' that is closed under the monoid operation and contains the identity element ''e'' of ''M''.<ref>Jacobson (2009)</ref><ref>Some authors omit the requirement that a submonoid must contain the identity element from its definition, requiring only that it have ''an'' identity element, which can be distinct from that of ''M''.</ref> Symbolically, ''N'' is a submonoid of ''M'' if {{math|''N'' ⊆ ''M''}}, {{math|''x'' • ''y'' ∈ ''N''}} whenever {{math|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, and {{math|''e'' ∈ ''N''}}. ''N'' is thus a monoid under the binary operation inherited from ''M''.\n\n===Generators===\nA subset ''S'' of ''M'' is said to be a '''generator''' of ''M'' if ''M'' is the smallest set containing ''S'' that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the monoid operation, or equivalently ''M'' is the result of applying the [[finitary closure operator]] to ''S''. If there is a generator of ''M'' that has finite cardinality, then ''M'' is said to be '''finitely generated'''. Not every set ''S'' will generate a monoid, as the generated structure may lack an identity element.\n\n===Commutative monoid===\nA monoid whose operation is [[commutative]] is called a '''commutative monoid''' (or, less commonly, an '''abelian monoid'''). Commutative monoids are often written additively. Any commutative monoid is endowed with its '''algebraic''' [[preorder]]ing ≤, defined by {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} if there exists ''z'' such that {{math|1=''x'' + ''z'' = ''y''}}.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Michel | last1=Gondran| first2=Michel | last2=Minoux | title=Graphs, Dioids and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms | year=2008 | location=Dordrecht | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-0-387-75450-5 | zbl=1201.16038 | series=Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces Series | volume=41 | page=13}}</ref>  An '''order-unit''' of a commutative monoid ''M'' is an element ''u'' of ''M'' such that for any element ''x'' of ''M'', there exists a positive integer ''n'' such that {{math|''x'' ≤ ''nu''}}. This is often used in case ''M'' is the [[Ordered group|positive cone]] of a [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]] [[abelian group]] ''G'', in which case we say that ''u'' is an order-unit of ''G''.\n\n===Partially commutative monoid===\nA monoid for which the operation is commutative for some, but not all elements is a [[trace monoid]]; trace monoids commonly occur in the theory of [[concurrent computation]].\n\n== Examples ==\n* Out of the 16 possible [[truth table#Truth table for all binary logical operators|binary Boolean operator]]s, each of the four that has a two sided identity is also commutative and associative and thus makes the set {False, True} a commutative monoid. Under the standard definitions, [[Logical conjunction|AND]] and [[Logical biconditional|XNOR]] have the identity True while [[Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] and [[Logical disjunction|OR]] have the identity False. The monoids from AND and OR are also [[idempotent]] while those from XOR and XNOR are not.\n* The [[natural number]]s, '''N''', form a commutative monoid under addition (identity element [[0 (number)|zero]]), or multiplication (identity element [[1 (number)|one]]). A submonoid of {{math|'''N'''}} under addition is called a [[numerical monoid]].\n* The [[positive integer]]s, {{math|'''N''' ∖ {{mset|0}}}}, form a commutative monoid under multiplication (identity element one).\n* Given a set {{mvar|A}}, all subsets of {{mvar|A}} form a commutative monoid under intersection operation (identity element is {{mvar|A}} itself).\n* Given a set {{mvar|A}}, all subsets of {{mvar|A}} form a commutative monoid under union operation (identity element is the empty set).\n* Generalizing the previous example, every bounded [[semilattice]] is an [[idempotent]] commutative monoid.\n** In particular, any bounded [[lattice (order)|lattice]] can be endowed with both a [[Join and meet|meet]]- and a [[Join and meet|join]]- monoid structure. The identity elements are the lattice's top and its bottom, respectively. Being lattices, [[Heyting algebra]]s and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are endowed with these monoid structures.\n* Every [[singleton set]] {{math|{{mset|''x''}}}} closed under a binary operation • forms the trivial (one-element) monoid, which is also the [[trivial group]].\n* Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a monoid and every [[abelian group]] a commutative monoid.\n* Any [[semigroup]] {{math|''S''}} may be turned into a monoid simply by adjoining an element {{math|''e''}} not in {{math|''S''}} and defining {{math|1=''e'' • ''s'' = ''s'' = ''s'' • ''e''}} for all {{math|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. This conversion of any semigroup to the monoid is done by the [[free functor]] between the category of semigroups and the category of monoids.<ref>{{citation|title=The {{math|''q''}}-theory of Finite Semigroups: A New Approach|volume=71|series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics|first1=John|last1=Rhodes|first2=Benjamin|last2=Steinberg|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387097817|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8L0QIEj0PI4C&pg=PA22}}.</ref>\n** Thus, an idempotent monoid (sometimes known as ''find-first'') may be formed by adjoining an identity element {{math|''e''}} to the [[left zero semigroup]] over a set {{math|''S''}}. The opposite monoid (sometimes called ''find-last'') is formed from the [[right zero semigroup]] over {{math|''S''}}.\n*** Adjoin an identity {{math|''e''}} to the left-zero semigroup with two elements {{math|{{mset|lt, gt}}}}. Then the resulting idempotent monoid {{math|{{mset|lt, ''e'', gt}}}} models the [[lexicographical order]] of a sequence given the orders of its elements, with ''e'' representing equality.\n* The elements of any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (algebra)|ring]], with addition or multiplication as the operation.\n** The [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s or [[complex number]]s, with addition or multiplication as operation.<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 29, examples 1, 2, 4 & 5.</ref>\n** The set of all {{math|''n''}} by {{math|''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over a given ring, with [[matrix addition]] or [[matrix multiplication]] as the operation.\n* The set of all finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] over some fixed alphabet {{math|Σ}} forms a monoid with [[string concatenation]] as the operation. The [[empty string]] serves as the identity element. This monoid is denoted {{math|Σ<sup>∗</sup>}} and is called the '''[[free monoid]]''' over {{math|Σ}}.\n* Given any monoid {{math|''M''}}, the ''opposite monoid'' {{math|''M''<sup>op</sup>}} has the same carrier set and identity element as {{math|''M''}}, and its operation is defined by {{math|1=''x'' •<sup>op</sup> ''y'' = ''y'' • ''x''}}. Any [[commutative monoid]] is the opposite monoid of itself.\n* Given two sets {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} endowed with monoid structure (or, in general, any finite number of monoids, {{math|''M''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''M<sub>k</sub>'')}}, their [[cartesian product]] {{math|''M'' × ''N''}} is also a monoid (respectively, {{math|''M<sub>1</sub>'' × ... × ''M<sub>k</sub>''}}). The associative operation and the identity element are defined pairwise.<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 35</ref>\n* Fix a monoid {{math|''M''}}. The set of all functions from a given set to {{math|''M''}} is also a monoid. The identity element is a [[constant function]] mapping any value to the identity of {{math|''M''}}; the associative operation is defined [[pointwise]].\n* Fix a monoid {{math|''M''}} with the operation {{math|•}} and identity element {{math|''e''}}, and consider its [[power set]] {{math|''P''(''M'')}} consisting of all [[subset]]s of {{math|''M''}}. A binary operation for such subsets can be defined by {{math|1=''S'' • ''T'' = {{mset| ''s'' • ''t'' : ''s'' ∈ ''S'', ''t'' ∈ ''T'' }}}}. This turns {{math|''P''(''M'')}} into a monoid with identity element {{math|{{mset|''e''}}}}. In the same way the power set of a group {{math|''G''}} is a monoid under the [[product of group subsets]].\n* Let {{math|''S''}} be a set. The set of all functions {{math|''S'' → ''S''}} forms a monoid under [[function composition]]. The identity is just the [[identity function]]. It is also called the '''[[full transformation monoid]]''' of {{math|''S''}}. If {{math|''S''}} is finite with {{math|''n''}} elements, the monoid of functions on {{math|''S''}} is finite with {{math|''n''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements.\n* Generalizing the previous example, let {{math|''C''}} be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] and {{math|''X''}} an object of {{math|''C''}}. The set of all [[endomorphism]]s of {{math|''X''}}, denoted {{math|End<sub>''C''</sub>(''X'')}}, forms a monoid under composition of [[morphism]]s. For more on the relationship between category theory and monoids see below.\n* The set of [[homeomorphism]] [[Class (set theory)|classes]] of [[compact surface]]s with the [[connected sum]]. Its unit element is the class of the ordinary 2-sphere. Furthermore, if {{math|''a''}} denotes the class of the [[torus]], and ''b'' denotes the class of the projective plane, then every element ''c'' of the monoid has a unique expression the form {{math|1=''c'' = ''na'' + ''mb''}} where {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and {{math|1=''m'' = 0, 1}}, or {{math|2}}. We have {{math|1=3''b'' = ''a'' + ''b''}}.\n* Let <math>\\langle f\\rangle</math> be a cyclic monoid of order {{math|''n''}}, that is, <math>\\langle f\\rangle = \\{f^0,f^1,\\dots,f^{n-1}\\}</math>. Then <math>f^n = f^k</math> for some <math>0 \\le k < n</math>. In fact, each such {{math|''k''}} gives a distinct monoid of order {{math|''n''}}, and every cyclic monoid is isomorphic to one of these.<br/>Moreover, {{math|''f''}} can be considered as a function on the points <math>\\{0,1,2,\\dots,n-1\\}</math> given by\n:: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 2 & \\dots & n-2 & n-1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & \\dots & n-1 & k\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n:or, equivalently\n:: <math>f(i) := \\begin{cases} i+1, & \\text{if }  0 \\le i < n-1  \\\\ k,  & \\text{if } i = n-1. \\end{cases} </math>\n:Multiplication of elements in <math>\\langle f\\rangle</math> is then given by function composition.\n:When <math>k = 0</math> then the function {{math|''f''}} is a permutation of <math>\\{0,1,2,\\dots,n-1\\},</math> and gives the unique [[cyclic group]] of order {{math|''n''}}.\n\n== Properties ==\nIn a monoid, one can define positive integer powers of an element ''x'' : ''x''<sup>1</sup> = ''x'', and ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''x'' • ... • ''x'' (''n'' times) for ''n'' > 1 . The rule of powers ''x''<sup>''n'' + ''p''</sup> = ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> • ''x''<sup>''p''</sup> is obvious.\n\nFrom the definition of a monoid, one can show that the identity element ''e'' is unique. Then, for any ''x'', one can set ''x''<sup>0</sup> = ''e'' and the rule of powers is still true with nonnegative exponents.\n\nIt is possible to define [[inverse element|invertible elements]]: an element ''x'' is called invertible if there exists an element ''y'' such that {{math|1=''x'' • ''y'' = ''e''}} and {{math|1=''y'' • ''x'' = ''e''}}. The element ''y'' is called the inverse of ''x''. If ''y'' and ''z'' are inverses of ''x'', then by associativity {{math|1=''y'' = (''zx'')''y'' = ''z''(''xy'') = ''z''}}. Thus inverses, if they exist, are unique.<ref>Jacobson, I.5. p. 22</ref>\n\nIf ''y'' is the inverse of ''x'', one can define negative powers of ''x'' by setting {{math|1=''x''<sup>−1</sup> = ''y''}} and  {{math|1=''x''<sup>−''n''</sup> = ''y'' • ... • ''y''}} (''n'' times) for {{math|''n'' > 1}}. And the rule of exponents is still verified for all integers {{math|''n'', ''p''}}. This is why the inverse of ''x'' is usually written {{math|''x''<sup>−1</sup>}}. The set of all invertible elements in a monoid ''M'', together with the operation •, forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. In that sense, every monoid contains a group (possibly only the [[trivial group]] consisting of only the identity).\n\nHowever, not every monoid sits inside a group. For instance, it is perfectly possible to have a monoid in which two elements ''a'' and ''b'' exist such that {{math|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''a''}} holds even though ''b'' is not the identity element. Such a monoid cannot be embedded in a group, because in the group we could multiply both sides with the inverse of ''a'' and would get that {{math|1=''b'' = ''e''}}, which isn't true. A monoid {{math|(''M'', •)}} has the [[cancellation property]] (or is [[cancellative]]) if for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''M'', {{math|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''a'' • ''c''}} always implies {{math|1=''b'' = ''c''}} and {{math|1=''b'' • ''a'' = ''c'' • ''a''}} always implies {{math|1=''b'' = ''c''}}. A commutative monoid with the cancellation property can always be embedded in a group via the [[Grothendieck group|Grothendieck construction]]. That is how the additive group of the integers (a group with operation +) is constructed from the additive monoid of natural numbers (a commutative monoid with operation + and cancellation property). However, a non-commutative cancellative monoid need not be embeddable in a group.\n\nIf a monoid has the cancellation property and is ''finite'', then it is in fact a group. Proof: Fix an element ''x'' in the monoid. Since the monoid is finite, {{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''x''<sup>''m''</sup>}} for some {{math|''m'' > ''n'' > 0}}. But then, by cancellation we have that {{math|1=''x''<sup>''m'' − ''n''</sup> = ''e''}} where ''e'' is the identity. Therefore, {{math|1=''x'' • ''x''<sup>''m'' − ''n'' − 1</sup> = ''e''}}, so ''x'' has an inverse.\n\nThe right- and left-cancellative elements of a monoid each in turn form a submonoid (i.e. obviously include the identity and not so obviously are closed under the operation). This means that the cancellative elements of any commutative monoid can be extended to a group.\n\nIt turns out that requiring the cancellative property in a monoid is not required to perform the Grothendieck construction – commutativity is sufficient. However, if the original monoid has an [[absorbing element]] then its Grothendieck group is the trivial group. Hence the homomorphism is, in general, not injective.\n\nAn '''inverse monoid''' is a monoid where for every ''a'' in ''M'', there exists a unique ''a''<sup>−1</sup> in ''M'' such that {{math|1=''a'' = ''a'' • ''a''<sup>−1</sup> • ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a''<sup>−1</sup> = ''a''<sup>−1</sup> • ''a'' • ''a''<sup>−1</sup>}}. If an inverse monoid is cancellative, then it is a group.\n\nIn the opposite direction, a '''[[zerosumfree monoid]]''' is an additively written monoid in which {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = 0}} implies that {{math|1=''a'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tensor products of structures with interpolation| first=Friedrich | last=Wehrung|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|volume=176|issue=1|year=1996|pages=267–285 | zbl=0865.06010 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102352063 }}\n</ref> equivalently, that no element other than zero has an additive inverse.\n\n==Acts and operator monoids==\n{{main|monoid act}}\nLet ''M'' be a monoid, with the binary operation denoted by • and the identity element denoted by ''e''. Then a (left) '''''M''-act''' (or left act over ''M'') is a set ''X'' together with an operation {{math|⋅ : ''M'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} which is compatible with the monoid structure as follows:\n* for all ''x'' in ''X'': {{math|1=''e'' ⋅ ''x'' = ''x''}};\n* for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'' and ''x'' in ''X'': {{math|1=''a'' ⋅ (''b'' ⋅ ''x'') = (''a'' • ''b'') ⋅ ''x''}}.\nThis is the analogue in monoid theory of a (left) [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]. Right ''M''-acts are defined in a similar way. A monoid with an act is also known as an '''[[operator monoid]]'''. Important examples include [[transition system]]s of [[semiautomata]]. A [[transformation semigroup]] can be made into an operator monoid by adjoining the identity transformation.\n\n== Monoid homomorphisms ==\n[[File:Exponentiation as monoid homomorphism svg.svg|thumb|x150px|Example monoid homomorphism {{math|''x'' ↦ 2<sup>''x''</sup>}} from {{math|{{color|#004000|('''N''', +, 0)}}}} to {{math|{{color|#400000|('''N''', ×, 1)}}}}. It is injective, but not surjective.]]\nA [[homomorphism]] between two monoids {{math|(''M'', ∗)}} and {{math|(''N'', •)}} is a function {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} such that\n* {{math|1=''f''(''x'' ∗ ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') • ''f''(''y'')}} for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''M''\n* {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>''M''</sub>) = ''e''<sub>''N''</sub>}},\nwhere ''e''<sub>''M''</sub> and ''e''<sub>''N''</sub> are the identities on ''M'' and ''N'' respectively. Monoid homomorphisms are sometimes simply called '''monoid morphisms'''.\n\nNot every [[semigroup homomorphism]] is a monoid homomorphism, since it may not map the identity to the identity of the target monoid, even though the element it maps the identity to will be an identity of the image of the mapping. In contrast, a semigroup homomorphism between groups is always a [[group homomorphism]], as it necessarily preserves the identity. Since for monoids this isn't always true, it is necessary to state this as a separate requirement.\n\nA [[bijective]] monoid homomorphism is called a monoid [[isomorphism]]. Two monoids are said to be isomorphic if there is a monoid isomorphism between them.\n\n==Equational presentation==\n{{main|Presentation of a monoid}}\n\nMonoids may be given a '''presentation''', much in the same way that groups can be specified by means of a [[group presentation]]. One does this by specifying a set of generators Σ, and a set of relations on the [[free monoid]] Σ<sup>∗</sup>. One does this by extending (finite) [[binary relation]]s on Σ<sup>∗</sup> to monoid congruences, and then constructing the quotient monoid, as above.\n\nGiven a binary relation {{math|''R'' ⊂ Σ<sup>∗</sup> × Σ<sup>∗</sup>}}, one defines its symmetric closure as {{math|''R'' ∪ ''R''<sup>−1</sup>}}. This can be extended to a symmetric relation {{math|''E'' ⊂ Σ<sup>∗</sup> × Σ<sup>∗</sup>}} by defining {{math|''x'' ~<sub>''E''</sub> ''y''}} if and only if {{math|1=''x'' = ''sut''}} and {{math|1=''y'' = ''svt''}} for some strings {{math|''u'', ''v'', ''s'', ''t'' ∈ Σ<sup>∗</sup>}} with {{math|(''u'',''v'') ∈ ''R'' ∪ ''R''<sup>−1</sup>}}. Finally, one takes the reflexive and transitive closure of ''E'', which is then a monoid congruence.\n\nIn the typical situation, the relation ''R'' is simply given as a set of equations, so that <math>R=\\{u_1=v_1,\\cdots,u_n=v_n\\}</math>. Thus, for example,\n: <math>\\langle p,q\\,\\vert\\; pq=1\\rangle</math>\nis the equational presentation for the [[bicyclic monoid]], and\n\n: <math>\\langle a,b \\,\\vert\\; aba=baa, bba=bab\\rangle</math>\nis the [[plactic monoid]] of degree 2 (it has infinite order). Elements of this plactic monoid may be written as <math>a^ib^j(ba)^k</math> for integers ''i'', ''j'', ''k'', as the relations show that ''ba'' commutes with both ''a'' and ''b''.\n\n== Relation to category theory ==\n{{Group-like structures}}\nMonoids can be viewed as a special class of [[category theory|categories]]. Indeed, the axioms required of a monoid operation are exactly those required of [[morphism]] composition when restricted to the set of all morphisms whose source and target is a given object.<ref name=Awo10>{{cite book | zbl=1100.18001 | title=Category Theory | volume=49 | series=Oxford Logic Guides | first=Steve | last=Awodey | authorlink=Steve Awodey | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-19-856861-4 | page=10 }}</ref> That is,\n: ''A monoid is, essentially, the same thing as a category with a single object.''\nMore precisely, given a monoid {{math|(''M'', •)}}, one can construct a small category with only one object and whose morphisms are the elements of ''M''. The composition of morphisms is given by the monoid operation •.\n\nLikewise, monoid homomorphisms are just [[functor]]s between single object categories.<ref name=Awo10/>  So this construction gives an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the [[category of monoids|category of (small) monoids]] '''Mon''' and a full subcategory of the category of (small) categories '''Cat'''. Similarly, the [[category of groups]] is equivalent to another full subcategory of '''Cat'''.\n\nIn this sense, category theory can be thought of as an extension of the concept of a monoid. Many definitions and theorems about monoids can be generalised to small categories with more than one object. For example, a quotient of a category with one object is just a quotient monoid.\n\nMonoids, just like other algebraic structures, also form their own category, '''Mon''', whose objects are monoids and whose morphisms are monoid homomorphisms.<ref name=Awo10/>\n\nThere is also a notion of [[monoid (category theory)|monoid object]] which is an abstract definition of what is a monoid in a category. A monoid object in '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' is just a monoid.\n\n== Monoids in computer science ==\nIn computer science, many [[abstract data types]] can be endowed with a monoid structure. In a common pattern, a [[sequence]] of elements of a monoid is \"[[fold (higher-order function)|folded]]\" or \"accumulated\" to produce a final value. For instance, many iterative algorithms need to update some kind of \"running total\" at each iteration; this pattern may be elegantly expressed by a monoid operation. Alternatively, the associativity of monoid operations ensures that the operation can be [[parallelization|parallelized]] by employing a [[prefix sum]] or similar algorithm, in order to utilize multiple cores or processors efficiently.\n\nGiven a sequence of values of type ''M'' with identity element <math>\\varepsilon</math> and associative operation <math>\\bullet</math>, the ''fold'' operation is defined as follows:\n: <math>\\mathrm{fold}: M^{*} \\rarr M = l \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\varepsilon & \\mbox{if } l = \\mathrm{nil} \\\\ m \\bullet \\mathrm{fold} \\, l' & \\mbox{if } l = \\mathrm{cons} \\, m \\, l' \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIn addition, any [[data structure]] can be 'folded' in a similar way, given a serialization of its elements. For instance, the result of \"folding\" a [[binary tree]] might differ depending on pre-order vs. post-order [[tree traversal]].\n\n== MapReduce ==\nAn application of monoids in computer science is so-called [[MapReduce]] programming model (see [https://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2016/09/05/expressing-map-reduce-as-a-left-folding-monoid/ Encoding Map-Reduce As A Monoid With Left Folding]). MapReduce, in computing, consists of two or three operations. Given a dataset, \"Map\" consists of mapping arbitrary data to elements of a specific monoid. \"Reduce\" consists of folding those elements, so that in the end we produce just one element.\n\nFor example, if we have a [[multiset]], in a program it is represented as a map from elements to their numbers. Elements are called keys in this case. The number of distinct keys may be too big, and in this case the [[multiset]] is being sharded. To finalize reduction properly, the \"Shuffling\" stage regroups the data among the nodes. If we do not need this step, the whole Map/Reduce consists of mapping and reducing; both operation are parallelizable, the former due to its element-wise nature, the latter due to associativity of the monoid.\n\n==Complete monoids==\nA '''complete monoid''' is a commutative monoid equipped with an [[infinitary sum]] operation <math>\\Sigma_I</math> for any [[index set]] {{mvar|I}} such that:<ref name=\"droste\">Droste, M., & Kuich, W.

For instance, a '''naturally ordered semiring''' (sometimes called a '''dioid'''<ref>[http://marcpouly.ch/pdf/internal_100712.pdf Semirings for breakfast], slide 17</ref>) is a semiring where the commutative monoid induced by the addition operator is naturally ordered.

In this identification, the points and lines of the plane correspond to the vertices of the building.\nReal forms of [[Lie groups]] give rise to examples which are the three main types of Moufang 3-gons. There are four real [[division algebras]]: the real numbers, the [[complex numbers]], the [[quaternions]], and the [[octonions]], of dimensions 1,2,4 and 8, respectively. The projective plane over such a division algebra then gives rise to a Moufang 3-gon.\n\nThese projective planes correspond to the building attached to SL<sub>3</sub>('''R'''), SL<sub>3</sub>('''C'''), a real form of A<sub>5</sub> and to a real form of E<sub>6</sub>, respectively.\n\nIn the first diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-spaces and 2-spaces in a three-dimensional vector space. In the second diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-space and 2-spaces in a 3-dimensional vector space over the [[quaternions]], which in turn represent certain 2-spaces and 4-spaces in a 6-dimensional complex vector space, as expressed by the circled nodes in the A<sub>5</sub> diagram. \nThe fourth case — a form of E<sub>6</sub> — is exceptional, and its analogue for Moufang 4-gons is a major feature of Weiss’s book.\n\nGoing from the real numbers to an arbitrary field, Moufang 3-gons can be divided into three cases as above. The split case in the first diagram exists over any field. The second case extends to all associative, non-commutative division algebras; over the reals these are limited to the algebra of quaternions, which has degree 2 (and dimension 4), but some fields admit central division algebras of other degrees. \nThe third case involves ‘alternative’ division algebras (which satisfy a weakened form of the associative law), and a theorem of [[Richard Bruck]] and Erwin Kleinfeld<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard H. |last=Bruck |author1-link=Richard Bruck|first2=Erwin |last2=Kleinfeld |title=The structure of alternative division rings |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=2 |issue=6 |year=1951 |pages=878–890 |doi= 10.2307/2031702 |jstor=2031702|mr=0045099 |pmc=1063309 }}</ref> shows that these are Cayley-Dickson algebras.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Erwin |last=Kleinfeld |title=Alternative division rings of characteristic 2 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=37 |issue=12 |year=1951 |pages=818–820 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.37.12.818|pmc=1063478|mr=0041834 }}</ref> This concludes the discussion of Moufang 3-gons.\n\n== Moufang 4-gons ==\nMoufang 4-gons are also called Moufang quadrangles.\nThe classification of Moufang 4-gons was the hardest of all, and when Tits and Weiss started to write it up, a hitherto unnoticed type came into being, arising from groups of type F4. They can be divided into three classes:\n\n*  (i) Those arising from classical groups.\n* (ii) Those arising from “mixed groups” (in which there are two imperfect fields of characteristic 2, K and L, with K2 ⊂ L ⊂ K).\n* (iii) Those arising from quadrangular algebras.\n\nThere is some overlap here, in the sense that some classical groups arising from pseudo-quadratic spaces can be obtained from quadrangular algebras (which Weiss calls special), but there are other, non-special ones. The most important of these arise from algebraic groups of types E6, E7, and E8. They are k-forms of algebraic groups belonging to the following diagrams:\nE6\nE7\nE8. \nThe E6 one exists over the real numbers, though the E7 and E8 ones do not. Weiss calls the quadrangular algebras in all these cases Weiss regular, but not special. \nThere is a further type that he calls defective arising from groups of type F4. These are the most exotic of all—they involve purely inseparable field extensions in characteristic 2—and Weiss only discovered them during the joint work with Tits on the classification of Moufang 4-gons by investigating a strange lacuna that should not have existed but did.\n\nThe classification of Moufang 4-gons by Tits and Weiss is related to their intriguing monograph in two ways. One is that the use of quadrangular algebras short-cuts some of the methods known before. The other is that the concept is an analogue to the octonion algebras, and quadratic Jordan division algebras of degree 3, that give rise to Moufang 3-gons and 6-gons.\n\nIn fact all the exceptional Moufang planes, quadrangles, and hexagons that do not arise from \"mixed groups\" (of characteristic 2 for quadrangles or characteristic 3 for hexagons) come from octonions, quadrangular algebras, or Jordan algebras.\n\n== Moufang 6-gons ==\nMoufang 6-gons are also called Moufang hexagons. A classification of Moufang 6-gons was stated by Tits,<ref>J. Tits, Classification of buildings of spherical type and Moufang polygons: a survey, in\nColl. Internaz. Teorie Combinatorie, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17, Rome 1976, pp. 229–246.</ref> though the details remained unproven until the joint work with Weiss on Moufang Polygons.\n\n== Moufang 8-gons ==\nMoufang 8-gons are also called Moufang octagons. They were classified by Tits,<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tits |title=Moufang octagons and Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub> |journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics|Amer. J. Math.]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=539–594 |jstor=2374268 }}</ref> where he showed that they all arise from [[Ree groups]] of type ²F₄.\n\n==Quadrangular algebras==\nA potential use for quadrangular algebras is to analyze two open questions. One is the Kneser-Tits conjecture<ref>J. Tits, Groupes de Whitehead de groupes algébriques simples sur un corps, Séminaire Bourbaki, 1976–77, no. 505; Lecture Notes in Mathematics 677, Springer-Verlag, 1977.</ref> that concerns the full group of '''linear transformations''' of a building (e.g. GL<sub>''n''</sub>) factored out by the subgroup generated by root groups (e.g. SL<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nThe conjecture is proved for all Moufang buildings except the 6-gons and 4-gons of type E8, in which case the group of linear transformations is conjectured to be equal to the subgroup generated by root groups. For the E8 hexagons this can be rephrased as a question on quadratic Jordan algebras, and for the E8 quadrangles it can now be rephrased in terms of quadrangular algebras.\n\nAnother open question about the E8 quadrangle concerns fields that are complete with respect to a discrete valuation: is there, in such cases, an affine building that yields the quadrangle as its structure at infinity?\n\n==See also==\n* [[Moufang loop]]\n* [[Moufang plane]]\n* [[Moufang–Lie algebra]]\n* [[Generalized n-gon]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n {{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Tits, J. \"Classification of algebraic semisimple groups.\"  1966  ''Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups'' (Proc.

If <math>F</math> is [[finite field|finite]] of order ''q'' (for example ''q'' = ''p'' a prime, and <math>F = \\mathbb F_p=\\mathbb Z/p\\mathbb Z</math>), then the [[finite field#multiplicative_structure|multiplicative group]] is cyclic: <math>F^\\times \\cong C_{q-1}</math>.\n\n==Group scheme of roots of unity==\nThe '''group scheme of ''n''-th [[roots of unity]]''' is by definition the kernel of the ''n''-power map on the multiplicative group GL(1), considered as a [[group scheme]]. That is, for any integer ''n'' > 1 we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes ''n''-th powers, and take an appropriate [[fiber product of schemes]], with the morphism ''e'' that serves as the identity.\n\nThe resulting group scheme is written μ<sub>''n''</sub> (or <math>\\mu\\!\\!\\mu_n</math><ref>{{cite book | last=Milne | first=James S. | title=Étale cohomology | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1980 | pages=xiii, 66 }}</ref>). It gives rise to a [[reduced scheme]], when we take it over a field ''K'', [[if and only if]] the [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of ''K'' does not divide ''n''. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with [[nilpotent element]]s in their [[structure sheaf|structure sheaves]]); for example μ<sub>''p''</sub> over a [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements for any [[prime number]] ''p''. \n\nThis phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. It turns out to be of major importance, for example, in expressing the [[duality theory of abelian varieties]] in characteristic ''p'' (theory of [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]]). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing [[Kummer theory]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* [[Michiel Hazewinkel]], Nadiya Gubareni, Nadezhda Mikhaĭlovna Gubareni, Vladimir V.

      "text": "In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a [[binary operation]] <math>\\oplus</math>, a [[unary operation]] <math>\\neg</math>, and the constant <math>0</math>, satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]]; the letters MV refer to the [[Many-valued logic|''many-valued'' logic]] of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative [[BCK algebra]]s.\n\n==Definitions==\nAn '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] <math>\\langle A, \\oplus, \\lnot, 0\\rangle,</math> consisting of\n* a [[empty set|non-empty]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] <math>A,</math>\n* a [[binary operation]] <math>\\oplus</math> on <math>A,</math>\n* a [[unary operation]] <math>\\lnot</math> on <math>A,</math> and\n* a constant <math>0</math> denoting a fixed [[element (mathematics)|element]] of <math>A,</math>\nwhich satisfies the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]:\n* <math> (x \\oplus y) \\oplus z = x \\oplus (y \\oplus z),</math>\n* <math> x \\oplus 0 = x,</math>\n* <math> x \\oplus y = y \\oplus x,</math>\n* <math> \\lnot \\lnot x = x,</math>\n* <math> x \\oplus \\lnot 0 = \\lnot 0,</math> and\n* <math> \\lnot ( \\lnot x \\oplus y)\\oplus y = \\lnot ( \\lnot y \\oplus x) \\oplus x.</math>\n\nBy virtue of the first three axioms, <math>\\langle A, \\oplus, 0 \\rangle</math> is a commutative [[monoid]]. Being defined by identities, MV-algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras. The variety of MV-algebras is a subvariety of the variety of [[BL (logic)|BL]]-algebras and contains all [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.\n\nAn MV-algebra can equivalently be defined (Hájek 1998) as a prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]] <math>\\langle L, \\wedge, \\vee, \\otimes, \\rightarrow, 0, 1 \\rangle </math> satisfying the additional identity <math>x \\vee y = (x \\rightarrow y) \\rightarrow y.</math>\n\n==Examples of MV-algebras==\nA simple numerical example is <math>A=[0,1],</math> with operations <math>x \\oplus y = \\min(x+y,1)</math> and <math>\\lnot x=1-x.</math> In mathematical fuzzy logic, this MV-algebra is called the ''standard MV-algebra'', as it forms the standard real-valued semantics of [[Łukasiewicz logic]].\n\nThe ''trivial'' MV-algebra has the only element 0 and the operations defined in the only possible way, <math>0\\oplus0=0</math> and <math>\\lnot0=0.</math>\n\nThe ''two-element'' MV-algebra is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] <math>\\{0,1\\},</math> with <math>\\oplus</math> coinciding with Boolean disjunction and <math>\\lnot</math> with Boolean negation. In fact adding the axiom <math>x \\oplus x = x</math> to the axioms defining an MV-algebra results in an axiomatization of Boolean algebras.\n\nIf instead the axiom added is <math>x \\oplus x \\oplus x = x \\oplus x</math>, then the axioms define the MV<sub>3</sub> algebra corresponding to the three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł<sub>3</sub>{{Citation needed|reason=Axiomatizations of Ln need Grigolia's axioms|date=February 2013}}. Other finite linearly ordered MV-algebras are obtained by restricting the universe and operations of the standard MV-algebra to the set of <math>n</math> equidistant real numbers between 0 and 1 (both included), that is, the set <math>\\{0,1/(n-1),2/(n-1),\\dots,1\\},</math> which is closed under the operations <math>\\oplus</math> and <math>\\lnot</math> of the standard MV-algebra; these algebras are usually denoted MV<sub>n</sub>.\n\nAnother important example is ''Chang's MV-algebra'', consisting just of infinitesimals (with the [[order type]] &omega;) and their co-infinitesimals.\n\nChang also constructed an MV-algebra from an arbitrary [[Linearly ordered group|totally ordered abelian group]] ''G'' by fixing a positive element ''u'' and defining the segment [0, ''u''] as { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' }, which becomes an MV-algebra with ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = min(''u'', ''x''+''y'') and ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x''. Furthermore, Chang showed that every linearly ordered MV-algebra is isomorphic to an MV-algebra constructed from a group in this way.\n\nD. Mundici extended the above construction to abelian [[lattice-ordered group]]s. If ''G'' is such a group with strong (order) unit ''u'', then the \"unit interval\" { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' } can be equipped with ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x'', ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = ''u''∧<sub>G</sub> (x+y), ''x'' ⊗ ''y'' = 0∨<sub>G</sub>(''x''+''y''−''u''). This construction establishes a [[categorical equivalence]] between lattice-ordered abelian groups with strong unit and MV-algebras.\n\n==Relation to Łukasiewicz logic==\n[[C. C. Chang]] devised MV-algebras to study [[many-valued logic]]s, introduced by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in 1920. In particular, MV-algebras form the [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]], as described below.\n\nGiven an MV-algebra ''A'', an ''A''-[[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] is a [[homomorphism]] from the algebra of [[propositional formula]]s (in the language consisting of <math>\\oplus,\\lnot,</math> and 0) into ''A''. Formulas mapped to 1 (or <math>\\lnot</math>0) for all ''A''-valuations are called ''A''-[[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. If the standard MV-algebra over [0,1] is employed, the set of all [0,1]-tautologies determines so-called infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]].\n\nChang's (1958, 1959) completeness theorem states that any MV-algebra equation holding in the standard MV-algebra over the interval [0,1] will hold in every MV-algebra. Algebraically, this means that the standard MV-algebra generates the variety of all MV-algebras. Equivalently, Chang's completeness theorem says that MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]], defined as the set of [0,1]-tautologies.\n\nThe way the [0,1] MV-algebra characterizes all possible MV-algebras parallels the well-known fact that identities holding in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] hold in all possible Boolean algebras. Moreover, MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]] in a manner analogous to the way that [[Boolean algebras]] characterize classical [[two-element Boolean algebra|bivalent logic]] (see [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]).\n\nIn 1984, Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced the [[Wajsberg algebra]] as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. Wajsberg algebras and MV-algebras are isomorphic.<Ref>{{Cite web |url=http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf |title=citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A.

However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for ''n'' ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] the Łukasiewicz ''n''-valued logic. Although C. C. Chang published his MV-algebra in 1958, it is faithful model only for the ℵ<sub>0</sub>-valued (infinitely-many-valued) [[Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic]].

Ternary associativity is the polynomial identity {{nowrap|(''abc'')''de''&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''a''(''bcd'')''e''&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''ab''(''cde'')}}, i.e. the equality of the three possible bracketings of the string ''abcde'' in which any three consecutive symbols are bracketed. (Here it is understood that the equations hold for arbitrary choices of elements ''a,b,c,d,e'' in ''G''.)  In general, ''n''-ary associativity is the equality of the ''n'' possible bracketings of a string consisting of ''n''+(''n''-1) = ''2n-1'' distinct symbols with any ''n'' consecutive  symbols bracketed.  A set ''G'' which is closed under an associative ''n''-ary operation is called an '''''n''-ary semigroup.''' A set ''G'' which is closed under any (not necessarily associative) ''n''-ary operation is called an '''''n''-ary [[Magma (algebra)|groupoid]]'''.\n\n===Inverses / unique solutions===\nThe inverse axiom is generalized as follows: in the case of binary operations the existence of an inverse means {{nowrap|''ax'' {{=}} ''b''}} has a unique solution for ''x'', and likewise {{nowrap|''xa'' {{=}} ''b''}} has a unique solution. In the ternary case we generalize this to {{nowrap|''abx'' {{=}} ''c''}}, {{nowrap|''axb'' {{=}} ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''xab'' {{=}} ''c''}} each having unique solutions, and the ''n''-ary case follows a similar pattern of existence of unique solutions and we get an '''''n''-ary quasigroup.'''\n\n===Definition of ''n-ary'' group===\nAn '''''n''-ary group''' is an ''n''-ary semigroup which is also an ''n''-ary quasigroup.\n\n===Identity / neutral elements===\nIn the 2-ary case, i.e. for an ordinary group, the existence of an identity element is a consequence of the associativity and inverse axioms, however in n-ary groups for n ≥ 3 there can be zero, one, or many identity elements.\n\nAn ''n''-ary groupoid (''G'',&nbsp;''ƒ'') with ''ƒ'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub> ◦ ''x''<sub>2</sub> ◦ . . . ◦ ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), where (''G'',&nbsp;◦) is a group is called reducible or derived from the group (''G'',&nbsp;◦). In 1928 Dörnte <ref name=\"Dornte\"/> published the first main results: An ''n''-ary groupoid which is reducible is an ''n''-ary group, however for all ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 there exist ''n''-ary groups which are not reducible. In some ''n''-ary groups there exists an element ''e'' (called an ''n''-ary identity or neutral element) such that any string of ''n''-elements consisting of all ''e''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s, apart from one place, is mapped to the element at that place. E.g., in a quaternary group with identity ''e'', ''eeae''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'' for every ''a''.\n\nAn ''n''-ary group containing a neutral element is reducible. Thus, an ''n''-ary group that is not reducible does not contain such elements. There exist ''n''-ary groups with more than one neutral element. If the set of all neutral elements of an ''n''-ary group is non-empty it forms an ''n''-ary subgroup.<ref>Wiesław A.

Under the assumption of ''n''-ary associativity it suffices to postulate the existence of the solution of equations with the unknown at the start or end of the string, or at one place other than the ends; e.g., in the 6-ary case, ''xabcde''=''f'' and ''abcdex''=''f'', or an expression like ''abxcde''=''f''.

      "text": "{{About|the mathematical concept|the electromagnetic concept|Near and far field}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''near-field''' is an [[algebraic structure]] similar to a [[division ring]], except that it has only one of the two distributive laws. Alternatively, a near-field is a [[near-ring]] in which there is a [[multiplicative identity]], and every non-zero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]].\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA near-field is a set <math>Q</math>, together with two [[binary operations]], <math>+</math> (addition) and <math>\\cdot</math> (multiplication), satisfying the following axioms:\n:A1: <math>(Q, +)</math> is an [[abelian group]].\n:A2: <math>(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c</math> =  <math>a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)</math> for all elements <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, <math>c</math> of <math>Q</math> (The [[associative law]] for multiplication).\n:A3: <math>(a + b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot c  +  b \\cdot c</math>  for all elements <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, <math>c</math> of <math>Q</math> (The right [[distributive law]]).\n:A4: <math>Q</math> contains an element 1 such that <math>1 \\cdot a = a \\cdot 1 = a</math>  for every element <math>a</math> of <math>Q</math> ([[Multiplicative identity]]).\n:A5: For every non-zero element a of <math>Q</math> there exists an element <math>a^{-1}</math> such that <math> a \\cdot a^{-1} = 1 = a^{-1} \\cdot a </math> ([[Multiplicative inverse]]).\n\n=== Notes on the definition ===\n# The above is strictly a definition of a ''right'' near-field. By replacing A3 by the left distributive law <math> c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot  a  +  c\\cdot b </math> we get a left near-field instead. Most commonly, \"near-field\" is taken as meaning \"right near-field\", but this is not a universal convention.\n# A (right) near-field is called \"planar\" if it is also a right [[quasifield]]. Every finite near-field is planar, but infinite near-fields need not be.  \n# It is not necessary to specify that the additive group is abelian, as this follows from the other axioms, as proved by B.H. Neumann and J.L. Zemmer.<ref>J.L. Zemmer, \"The additive group of an infinite near-field is abelian\" in ''J. London Math. Soc.'' 44 (1969), 65-67.</ref><ref name=\"Zassenhaus\">H Zassenhaus, Abh. Math. Sem. Hans. Univ. 11, pp 187-220.</ref><ref>B.H. Neumann, \"On the commutativity of addition\" in ''J. London Math. Soc.'' 15 (1940), 203-208.</ref> However, the proof is quite difficult, and it is more convenient to include this in the axioms so that progress with establishing the properties of near-fields can start more rapidly.\n# Sometimes a list of axioms is given in which A4 and A5 are replaced by the following single statement:\n#:A4*: The non-zero elements form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication.\n#:However, this alternative definition includes one exceptional structure of order 2 which fails to satisfy various basic theorems (such as <math> x \\cdot 0  = 0</math>  for all <math> x </math>). Thus it is much more convenient, and more usual, to use the axioms in the form given above. The difference is that A4 requires 1 to be an identity for all elements, A4* only for non-zero elements.\n#:The exceptional structure can be defined by taking an additive group of order 2, and defining multiplication by <math> x \\cdot y  = x </math> for all <math> x </math> and <math> y</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\n# Any [[division ring]] (including any [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is a near-field.\n# The following defines a (right) near-field of order 9. It is the smallest near-field which is not a field.\n#:Let <math>K</math> be the [[Finite field|Galois field]] of order 9. Denote multiplication in <math>K</math> by ' <math>*</math> '. Define a new binary operation ' '''·''' ' by:\n#::If <math> b </math> is any element of <math>K</math> which is a square and <math> a </math> is any element of <math>K</math> then <math> a \\cdot b = a*b</math>.\n#::If <math> b </math> is any element of <math>K</math> which is not a square and <math> a </math> is any element of <math>K</math> then <math> a \\cdot b = a^3*b</math>.\n#:Then <math>K</math> is a near-field with this new multiplication and the same addition as before.<ref>G. Pilz, Near-Rings, page 257.</ref>\n\n== History and applications ==\nThe concept of a near-field was first introduced by [[Leonard Dickson]] in 1905. He took division rings and modified their multiplication, while leaving addition as it was, and thus produced the first known examples of near-fields that were not division rings. The near-fields produced by this method are known as Dickson near-fields; the near-field of order 9 given above is a  Dickson near-field.\n[[Hans Zassenhaus]] proved that all but 7 finite near-fields are either fields or  Dickson near-fields.<ref name=\"Zassenhaus\"/>\n\nThe earliest application of the concept of near-field was in the study of geometries, such as [[projective geometry|projective geometries]].<ref>O. Veblen and J. H. Wedderburn \"Non-desarguesian and non-pascalian geometrie\" in ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 8 (1907), 379-388.</ref><ref>P. Dembrowski \"Finite geometries\" Springer, Berlin, (1968).</ref> Many projective geometries can be defined in terms of a coordinate system over a division ring, but others can not. It was found that by allowing coordinates from any near-ring the range of geometries which could be coordinatized was extended. For example, [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall]] used the near-field of order 9 given above to produce a [[Hall plane]], the first of a sequence of such planes based on Dickson near-fields of order the square of a prime. In 1971 [[T. G. Room]] and P.B. Kirkpatrick provided an alternative development.<ref>[[T. G. Room]] & P.B.

Wähling \"Theorie der Fastkörper\", Thales Verlag, Essen, (1987).</ref> A more recent application of near-fields is in the construction of ciphers for data-encryption, such as [[Hill cipher]]s.<ref>M. Farag, \"Hill Ciphers over Near-Fields\" in ''Mathematics and Computer Education'' v41 n1 (2007) 46-54.</ref>\n\n== Description in terms of Frobenius groups and group automorphisms ==\n\nLet <math>K</math> be a near field. Let <math>K_m</math> be its multiplicative group and let <math>K_a</math> be its additive group. Let <math>c \\in K_m</math> act on <math>b \\in K_a</math> by <math>b \\mapsto b \\cdot c</math>. The axioms of a near field show that this is a right group action by group automorphisms of <math>K_a</math>, and the nonzero elements of <math>K_a</math> form a single orbit with trivial stabilizer.\n\nConversely, if <math>A</math> is an abelian group and <math>M</math> is a subgroup of <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(A)</math> which acts freely and transitively on the nonzero elements of <math>A</math>, then we can define a near field with additive group <math>A</math> and multiplicative group <math>M</math>. Choose an element in <math>A</math> to call <math>1</math> and let <math>\\phi: M \\to A \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}</math> be the bijection <math>m \\mapsto 1 \\ast m</math>. Then we define addition on <math>A</math> by the additive group structure on <math>A</math> and define multiplication by <math>a \\cdot b = 1 \\ast \\phi^{-1}(a) \\phi^{-1}(b)</math>.\n\nA [[Frobenius group]] can be defined as a finite group of the form <math>A \\rtimes M</math> where <math>M</math> acts without stabilizer on the nonzero elements of <math>A</math>. Thus, near fields are in bijection with Frobenius groups where <math>|M| = |A|-1</math>.\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAs described above, Zassenhaus proved that all finite near fields either arise from a construction of Dickson or are one of seven exceptional examples. We will describe this classification by giving pairs <math>(A,M)</math> where <math>A</math> is an abelian group and <math>M</math> is a group of automorphisms of <math>A</math> which acts freely and transitively on the nonzero elements of <math>A</math>.\n\nThe construction of Dickson proceeds as follows.<ref>M. Hall, 20.7.2, ''The Theory of Groups'', Macmillan, 1959</ref> Let <math>q</math> be a prime power and choose a positive integer <math>n</math> such that all prime factors of <math>n</math> divide <math>q-1</math> and, if <math>q \\equiv 3 \\bmod 4</math>, then <math>n</math> is not divisible by <math>4</math>. Let <math>F</math> be the [[finite field]] of order <math>q^n</math> and let <math>A</math> be the additive group of <math>F</math>. The multiplicative group of <math>F</math>, together with the [[Finite field#Frobenius automorphism and Galois theory|Frobenius automorphism]] <math>x \\mapsto x^q</math> generate a group of automorphisms of <math>F</math> of the form <math>C_n \\ltimes C_{q^n-1}</math>, where <math>C_k</math> is the cyclic group of order <math>k</math>. The divisibility conditions on <math>n</math> allow us to find a subgroup of <math>C_n \\ltimes C_{q^n-1}</math> of order <math>q^n-1</math> which acts freely and transitively on <math>A</math>. The case <math>n=1</math> is the case of commutative finite fields; the nine element example above is <math>q=3</math>, <math>n=2</math>.\n\nIn the seven exceptional examples, <math>A</math> is of the form <math>C_p^2</math>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''near-semiring''' (also ''seminearring'') is an [[abstract algebra|algebraic]] [[algebraic structure|structure]] more general than a [[near-ring]] or a [[semiring]]. Near-semirings arise naturally from [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] on [[monoid]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nA near-semiring is a set ''S'' with two binary operations \"+\" and \"·\", and a constant 0 such that (''S''; +; 0) is a [[monoid]] (not necessarily commutative), (''S''; ·) is a semigroup, these structures are related by one (right or left) [[distributive law]], and accordingly the 0 is one (right or left, respectively) side [[absorbing element]].\n\nFormally, an algebraic structure (''S''; +, ·, 0) is said to be a near-semiring if it satisfies the following axioms:\n\n# (''S''; +, 0) is a monoid,\n# (''S''; ·) is a semigroup,\n# (''a'' + ''b'') · ''c'' = ''a'' · ''c'' + ''b'' · ''c'', for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''S'', and\n# 0 · ''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''S''. \n\nNear-semirings are a common abstraction of semirings and near-rings [Golan, 1999; Pilz, 1983]. The standard examples of near-semirings are typically of the form ''M''(Г), the set of all mappings on a monoid (Г; +, 0), equipped with composition of mappings, pointwise addition of mappings, and the constantly 0 function. Subsets of ''M''(Г) closed under the operations provide further examples of near-semirings. Another example is the ordinals under the usual operations of [[ordinal arithmetic]] (here Clause 3 should be replaced with its symmetric form ''c'' · (''a'' + ''b'')  =  ''c'' · ''a'' + ''c'' · ''b''. Strictly speaking, the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all ordinals is not a set, so the above example should be more appropriately called a ''class near-semiring''. We get a near-semiring in the standard sense if we restrict to those ordinals strictly less than some [[Additively indecomposable ordinal|multiplicatively indecomposable ordinal]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://math.haifa.ac.il/JSGOLAN/golan2.html Golan, Jonathan S.], ''Semirings and their applications''.

The ordered field <math>K\\,</math> together with the additional function <math>E\\,</math> is called an ordered exponential field.\n\n==Examples==\n* The canonical example for an ordered exponential field is the ordered field of real numbers '''R''' with any function of the form <math display=\"inline\"> a^x</math> where <math display=\"inline\">a</math> is a real number greater than&nbsp;1. One such function is the usual [[exponential function]], that is {{nowrap|1=''E''(''x'') = [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]<sup>''x''</sup>}}. The ordered field '''R''' equipped with this function gives the ordered real exponential field, denoted by {{nowrap|1='''R'''<sub>exp</sub>}}. It was proved in the 1990s that '''R'''<sub>exp</sub> is [[Model complete theory|model complete]], a result known as [[Wilkie's theorem]]. This result, when combined with Khovanskiĭ's theorem on [[pfaffian function]]s, proves that '''R'''<sub>exp</sub> is also [[o-minimal]].<ref>A.J. Wilkie, ''Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and the exponential function'', J. Amer. Math. Soc., '''9''' (1996), pp.&nbsp;1051–1094.</ref> [[Alfred Tarski]] posed the question of the decidability of '''R'''<sub>exp</sub> and hence it is now known as [[Tarski's exponential function problem]]. It is known that if the real version of [[Schanuel's conjecture]] is true then '''R'''<sub>exp</sub> is decidable.<ref>A.J. Macintyre, A.J. Wilkie, ''On the decidability of the real exponential field'', Kreisel 70th Birthday Volume, (2005).</ref>\n* The ordered field of [[surreal number]]s <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{No}</math> admits an exponential which extends the exponential function exp on '''R'''. Since <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{No}</math> does not have the [[Archimedean property]], this is an example of a non-Archimedean ordered exponential field.\n* The ordered field of [[Transseries|logarithmic-exponential transseries]] <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbb{T}^{LE}</math> is constructed specifically in a way such that it admits a canonical exponential.\n\n==Formally exponential fields==\nA formally exponential field, also called an exponentially closed field, is an ordered field that can be equipped with an exponential <math display=\"inline\">E</math>. For any formally exponential field <math display=\"inline\">K</math>, one can choose an exponential <math display=\"inline\">E</math> on <math display=\"inline\">K</math> such that \n<math display=\"inline\">1+1/n<E(1)<n</math> for some natural number <math display=\"inline\">n</math>.<ref>Salma Kuhlmann, ''Ordered Exponential Fields'', Fields Institute Monographs, 12, (2000), p.&nbsp;24.</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n* Every ordered exponential field <math display=\"inline\">K</math> is ''root-closed'', i.e., every positive element of <math>K\\,</math> has an <math display=\"inline\">n</math>-th root for all positive integer <math display=\"inline\">n</math> (or in other words the multiplicative group of positive elements of <math>K\\,</math> is [[Divisible group|divisible]]). This is so because <math display=\"inline\">E\\left(\\frac{1}{n}E^{-1}(a)\\right)^n=E(E^{-1}(a))=a</math> for all <math display=\"inline\">a>0</math>. \n* Consequently, every ordered exponential field is a [[Euclidean field]]. \n* Consequently, every ordered exponential field is an ordered [[Pythagorean field]].\n* Not every [[real-closed field]] is a formally exponential field, e.g., the field of real [[algebraic number]]s does not admit an exponential. This is so because an exponential <math display=\"inline\">E</math> has to be of the form <math>E(x)=a^x\\,</math> for some <math display=\"inline\"> 1<a\\in K</math> in every formally exponential subfield <math display=\"inline\">K</math> of the real numbers; however, <math>E(\\sqrt{2})=a^\\sqrt{2}</math> is not algebraic if <math display=\"inline\"> 1<a </math> is algebraic by the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]].\n* Consequently, the class of formally exponential fields is not an [[elementary class]] since the field of real numbers and the field of real algebraic numbers are [[elementarily equivalent]] structures. \n* The class of formally exponential fields is a [[pseudoelementary class]]. This is so since a field <math>K\\,</math> is exponentially closed if and only if there is a surjective function <math display=\"inline\">E_2\\colon K\\rightarrow K^+</math> such that <math display=\"inline\">E_2(x+y)=E_2(x)E_2(y)</math> and <math display=\"inline\">E_2(1)=2</math>; and these properties of <math display=\"inline\">E_2</math> are axiomatizable.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Exponential field]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | first=Norman L. | last=Alling | title=On Exponentially Closed Fields | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=13 | number=5 | year=1962 | pages=706–711 | zbl=0136.32201 | doi=10.2307/2034159| jstor=2034159 }}\n* {{Citation|last=Kuhlmann|first=Salma|title=Ordered Exponential Fields|series=Fields Institute Monographs|volume=12|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2000|isbn=0-8218-0943-1|mr=1760173|doi=10.1090/fim/012}}\n\n[[Category:Model theory]]\n[[Category:Field theory]]\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]"

      "text": "{{Short description|1=Overview of and topical guide to algebraic structures}}\n{{Algebraic structures}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], there are many types of [[algebraic structure]]s which are studied. [[Abstract algebra]] is primarily the study of specific algebraic structures and their properties. Algebraic structures may be viewed in different ways, however the common starting point of algebra texts is that an algebraic object incorporates one or more [[set theory|set]]s with one or more [[binary operation]]s or [[unary operation]]s satisfying a collection of [[axiom]]s.\n\nAnother branch of mathematics known as [[universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures in general.   From the universal algebra viewpoint, most structures can be divided into [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] and [[quasivariety|quasivarieties]] depending on the axioms used. Some [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called ''nonvarieties'', are sometimes included among the algebraic structures by tradition.\n\nConcrete examples of each structure will be found in the articles listed.\n\nAlgebraic structures are so numerous today that this article will inevitably be incomplete. In addition to this, there are sometimes multiple names for the same structure, and sometimes one name will be defined by disagreeing axioms by different authors. Most structures appearing on this page will be common ones which most authors agree on. Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include [http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php Jipsen] and [http://planetmath.org/browse/objects/ PlanetMath.] These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Study of algebraic structures ==\n\nAlgebraic structures appear in most branches of mathematics, and one can encounter them in many different ways.\n*Beginning study: In American universities, [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s are generally the first structures encountered in subjects such as [[linear algebra]]. They are usually introduced as sets with certain axioms.\n*Advanced study:\n**[[Abstract algebra]] studies properties of specific algebraic structures.\n**[[Universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures abstractly, rather than specific types of structures. \n***[[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]]\n**[[Category theory]] studies interrelationships between different structures, algebraic and non-algebraic. To study a non-algebraic object, it is often useful to use category theory to relate the object to an algebraic structure. \n***Example: The [[fundamental group]] of a [[topological space]] gives information about the topological space.\n\n== Types of algebraic structures ==\n\nIn full generality, an algebraic structure may use any number of sets and any number of axioms in its definition. The most commonly studied structures, however, usually involve only one or two sets and one or two [[binary operation]]s. The structures below are organized by how many sets are involved, and how many binary operations are used. Increased indentation is meant to indicate a more exotic structure, and the least indented levels are the most basic.\n\n===One binary operation on one set===\n{{Group-like structures}}\nThe following structures consist of a set with a binary operation. The most common structure is that of a ''group''. Other structures involve weakening or strengthening the axioms for groups, and may additionally use unary operations.\n\n*[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s are key structures. [[Abelian group]]s are an important special type of group.\n**[[semigroup]]s and [[monoid]]s: These are like groups, except the operation need not have inverse elements.\n**[[quasigroup]]s and [[quasigroup|loops]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative.\n**[[Magma (algebra)|Magmas]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative or have inverse elements.\n*[[Semilattice]]: This is basically \"half\" of a lattice structure (see below).\n\n===Two binary operations on one set===\nThe main types of structures with one set having two binary operations are ''rings'' and ''lattices''. The axioms defining many of the other structures are modifications of the axioms for rings and lattices. One major difference between rings and lattices is that their two operations are related to each other in different ways. In ring-like structures, the two operations are linked by the [[distributive law]]; in lattice-like structures, the operations are linked by the [[absorption law]].\n\n*[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s: The two operations are usually called addition and multiplication. [[Commutative ring]]s are an especially important type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. [[Integral domain]]s and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are especially important types of commutative rings.\n**[[Nonassociative ring]]s: These are like rings, but the multiplication operation need not be associative.\n***[[Lie ring]]s and [[Jordan ring]]s are special examples of nonassociative rings.\n**[[semiring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not have inverses.\n**[[nearring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not be commutative.\n**[[*-ring]]s: These are rings with an additional unary operation known as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]].\n*[[lattice (order theory)|Lattice]]s: The two operations are usually called [[meet and join]].\n**[[Latticoid]]: meet and join [[Commutativity|commute]] but need not [[Integral domain|associate]].\n**[[Skew lattice]]: meet and join associate but need not commute.\n\n===Two binary operations and two sets===\nThe following structures have the common feature of having two sets, ''A'' and ''B'', so that there is a binary operation from ''A''×''A'' into ''A'' and another operation from ''A''×''B'' into ''A''.\n\n*[[Vector space]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, and the set ''B'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n**[[Graded vector space]]s: Vector spaces which are equipped with a [[direct sum]] decomposition into subspaces.\n*[[module (mathematics)|Module]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, but the ''B'' is only a general ring and not necessarily a field.\n**Special types of modules, including [[free module]]s, [[projective module]]s, [[injective module]]s and [[flat module]]s are studied in abstract algebra.\n*[[Group with operators]]: In this case, the set ''A'' is a group, and the set ''B'' is just a set.\n\n===Three binary operations and two sets===\nMany structures here are actually hybrid structures of the previously mentioned ones.\n\n*[[Algebra over a field]]: This is a ring which is also a vector space over a field. There are axioms governing the interaction of the two structures. Multiplication is usually assumed to be associative.\n**[[Algebra over a ring]]: These are defined the same way as algebras over fields, except that the field may now be any commutative ring.\n**[[Graded algebra]]: These algebras are equipped with a decomposition into ''grades''.\n*[[Non-associative algebra]]s: These are algebras for which the associativity of ring multiplication is relaxed. \n**[[Lie algebra]]s and [[Jordan algebra]]s are special examples of non-associative algebras.\n*[[Coalgebra]]: This structure has axioms which make its multiplication [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to those of an associative algebra.\n**[[Bialgebra]]: These structures are simultaneously algebras and coalgebras whose operations are compatible. There are actually four operations for this structure.\n\n==Algebraic structures with additional non-algebraic structure==\nThere are many examples of mathematical structures where algebraic structure exists alongside non-algebraic structure.\n\n*[[Topological vector space]]s are vector spaces with a compatible [[topology]].\n*[[Lie group]]s: These are topological manifolds that also carry a compatible group structure.\n*[[Ordered group]]s, [[ordered ring]]s and [[ordered field]]s have algebraic structure compatible with an [[order theory|order]] on the set.\n*[[Von Neumann algebra]]s: these are *-algebras on a [[Hilbert space]] which are equipped with the [[weak operator topology]].\n\n==Algebraic structures in different disciplines==\nSome algebraic structures find uses in disciplines outside of abstract algebra. The following is meant to demonstrate some specific applications in other fields.\n\nIn [[Physics]]:\n*[[Lie group]]s are used extensively in physics. A few well-known ones include the [[orthogonal group]]s and the [[unitary group]]s.\n*[[Lie algebra]]s\n*[[Inner product space]]s\n*[[Kac–Moody algebra]]\n*The [[quaternions]] and more generally [[geometric algebra]]s\n\nIn [[Mathematical logic]]:\n*[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are both rings and lattices, under their two operations.\n**[[Heyting algebra]]s are a special example of boolean algebras.\n*[[Peano arithmetic]]\n*[[Boundary algebra]]\n*[[MV-algebra]]\n\nIn [[Computer science]]:\n*[[Max-plus algebra]]\n*[[Syntactic monoid]]\n*[[Transition monoid]]\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Abstract algebra]]\n**[[Outline of abstract algebra]]\n*[[Universal algebra]]\n**[[Variety (universal algebra)]]\n*[[Linear algebra]]\n**[[Outline of linear algebra]]\n*[[Arity]]\n*[[Category theory]]\n*[[Free object]]\n*[[Operation (mathematics)]]\n*[[Signature (logic)]]\n*[[List of first-order theories|First-order theories]]\n*[[List of mathematics lists|Mathematical lists]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[[Garrett Birkhoff]], 1967.

The term \"ternary ring\" often means a planar ternary ring, but it can also simply mean a ternary system.\n\n==Definition==\n\nA '''planar ternary ring''' is a structure <math>(R,T)</math> where <math>R</math> is a set containing at least two distinct elements, called 0 and 1, and <math>T\\colon R^3\\to R \\,</math> is a mapping which satisfies these five axioms:\n# <math>T(a,0,b)=T(0,a,b)=b,\\quad \\forall a,b \\in R</math>;\n# <math>T(1,a,0)=T(a,1,0)=a,\\quad \\forall a \\in R</math>;\n# <math>\\forall a,b,c,d \\in R, a\\neq c</math>, there is a unique <math>x\\in R</math> such that : <math>T(x,a,b)=T(x,c,d) \\,</math>;\n# <math>\\forall a,b,c \\in R</math>, there is a unique <math>x \\in R</math>, such that <math>T(a,b,x)=c \\,</math>; and\n# <math>\\forall a,b,c,d \\in R, a\\neq c</math>, the equations <math>T(a,x,y)=b,T(c,x,y)=d \\,</math> have a unique solution <math>(x,y)\\in R^2</math>.\n\nWhen <math>R</math> is finite, the third and fifth axioms are equivalent in the presence of the fourth.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|loc=p. 118, Theorem 5.4}}</ref>\n\nNo other pair (0', 1') in <math>R^2</math> can be found such that <math>T</math> still satisfies the first two axioms.\n\n==Binary operations==\n===Addition===\nDefine <math>a\\oplus b=T(a,1,b)</math>.<ref>In the literature there are two versions of this definition. This is the form used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1959|loc=p. 355}}, {{harvtxt|Albert|Sandler|1968|loc=p. 50}}, and {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 128}}, while <math>a \\oplus b = T(1,a,b)</math> is used by {{harvtxt|Hughes|Piper|1973|loc=p. 117}}, {{harvtxt|Pickert|1975|loc=p. 38}}, and {{harvtxt|Stevenson|1972|loc=p. 274}}. The difference comes from the alternative ways these authors coordinatize the plane.</ref> The structure <math>(R,\\oplus)</math> is a [[Loop (algebra)|loop]] with [[identity element]] 0.\n\n===Multiplication===\nDefine <math>a\\otimes b=T(a,b,0)</math>. The set <math>R_{0} = R \\setminus \\{0\\} \\,</math> is closed under this multiplication.  The structure <math>(R_{0},\\otimes)</math> is also a loop, with identity element 1.\n\n===Linear PTR===\nA planar ternary ring <math>(R,T)</math> is said to be ''linear'' if <math>T(a,b,c)=(a\\otimes b)\\oplus c,\\quad \\forall a,b,c \\in R</math>.\nFor example, the planar ternary ring associated to a [[quasifield]] is (by construction) linear.{{cn|date=July 2013}}\n\n==Connection with projective planes==\n[[File:Projective_Plane_Coordinates.svg |thumb|400px|Coordinates of a projective plane to establish a planar ternary ring]]\n\nGiven a planar ternary ring <math>(R,T)</math>, one can construct a [[projective plane]] with point set ''P'' and line set ''L'' as follows:<ref>R. H. Bruck, ''Recent Advances in the Foundations of Euclidean Plane Geometry'', (1955) Appendix I.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1943|loc=p.247 Theorem 5.4}}</ref>  (Note that <math>\\infty</math> is an extra symbol not in <math>R</math>.)\n\nLet\n* <math>P=\\{(a,b)|a,b\\in R\\}\\cup \\{(a)|a \\in R \\}\\cup \\{(\\infty)\\}</math>, and \n* <math>L=\\{[a,b]|a,b \\in R\\}\\cup\\{[a]|a \\in R \\}\\cup \\{[\\infty]\\}</math>.\n\nThen define, <math>\\forall a,b,c,d \\in R</math>, the [[incidence relation]] <math>I</math> in this way:\n:<math>((a,b),[c,d])\\in I \\Longleftrightarrow T(a,c,d)=b</math>\n:<math>((a,b),[c])\\in I \\Longleftrightarrow a=c</math>\n:<math> ((a,b),[\\infty])\\notin I</math>\n:<math>((a), [c,d])\\in I \\Longleftrightarrow a=c</math>\n:<math>((a), [c])\\notin I</math>\n:<math>((a),[\\infty])\\in I</math>\n:<math>((\\infty),[c,d])\\notin I</math>\n:<math>((\\infty),[a])\\in I</math>\n:<math>((\\infty),[\\infty])\\in I</math>\n\nEvery projective plane can be constructed in this way, starting with an appropriate planar ternary ring.  However, two nonisomorphic planar ternary rings can lead to the construction of isomorphic projective planes.\n\nConversely, given any projective plane π, by choosing four points, labelled ''o'', ''e'', ''u'', and ''v'', no three of which lie on the same line, coordinates can be introduced in π so that these special points are given the coordinates: ''o'' = (0,0), ''e'' = (1,1), ''v'' = (<math>\\infty</math>) and ''u'' = (0).<ref>This can be done in several ways. A short description of the method used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1943}} can be found in {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 127}}.</ref> The ternary operation is now defined on the coordinate symbols (except <math>\\infty</math>) by ''y'' = T(''x'',''a'',''b'') if and only if the point (''x'',''y'') lies on the line which joins (''a'') with (0,''b''). The axioms defining a projective plane are used to show that this gives a planar ternary ring. \n\nLinearity of the PTR is equivalent to a geometric condition holding in the associated projective plane.<ref>{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 129}}</ref>\n\n==Related algebraic structures==\nPTR's which satisfy additional algebraic conditions are given other names. These names are not uniformly applied in the literature. The following listing of names and properties is taken from {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 129}}.\n \nA linear PTR whose additive loop is [[Associative property|associative]] (and thus a [[Group (mathematics)|group ]]), is called a '''cartesian group'''. In a cartesian group, the mappings\n\n<math>x \\longrightarrow -x \\otimes a + x \\otimes b </math>, and\n<math>x \\longrightarrow a \\otimes x - b \\otimes x </math>\n\nmust be permutations whenever <math>a \\neq b</math>. Since cartesian groups are groups under addition, we revert to using a simple \"+\" for the additive operation.\n\nA [[quasifield]] is a cartesian group satisfying the right distributive law:\n<math> (x+y) \\otimes z = x \\otimes z + y \\otimes z </math>.\nAddition in any quasifield is [[Commutative property|commutative]].\n\nA [[semifield]] is a quasifield which also satisfies the left distributive law:\n<math> x \\otimes (y + z) = x \\otimes y + x \\otimes z.</math>\n\nA '''planar [[Near-field (mathematics)|nearfield]]''' is a quasifield whose multiplicative loop is associative (and hence a group). Not all nearfields are planar nearfields.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last1=Albert|first=A.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_ring",
      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=June 2015}}\nIn the branch of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[ring theory]], a '''left primitive ring''' is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which has a [[faithful module|faithful]] [[simple module|simple]] [[left module]]. Well known examples include [[endomorphism ring]]s of [[vector spaces]] and [[Weyl algebra]]s over fields of characteristic zero.\n\n== Definition ==\nA [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is said to be a '''left primitive ring''' if and only if it has a [[faithful module|faithful]] [[simple module|simple]] [[module (mathematics)|left ''R''-module]].  A '''right primitive ring''' is defined similarly with right ''R''-modules. There are rings which are primitive on one side but not on the other. The first example was constructed by [[George Bergman|George M. Bergman]] in {{harv|Bergman|1964}}.  Another example found by Jategaonkar showing the distinction can be found in {{harv|Rowen|1988, p.159}}\n\nAn internal characterization of left primitive rings is as follows: a ring is left primitive if and only if there is a maximal [[left ideal]] containing no nonzero two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]]. The analogous definition for right primitive rings is also valid.\n\nThe structure of left primitive rings is completely determined by the [[Jacobson density theorem]]: A ring is left primitive if and only if it is isomorphic to a [[Jacobson density theorem#Topological characterization|dense]] subring of the [[ring of endomorphisms]] of a left [[vector space]] over a division ring.\n\nAnother equivalent definition states that a ring is left primitive if and only if it is a [[prime ring]] with a faithful left module of [[length of a module|finite length]] ({{harvnb|Lam|2001}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2T5DAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 Ex.&nbsp;11.19, p.&nbsp;191]).\n\n==Properties==\nOne sided primitive rings are both [[semiprimitive ring]]s and [[prime ring]]s.  Since the ring product of two or more nonzero rings is not prime, it is clear that the product of primitive rings is never primitive.  \n\nFor a left [[Artinian ring]], it is known that the conditions \"left primitive\", \"right primitive\", \"prime\", and \"[[simple ring|simple]]\" are all equivalent, and in this case it is a [[semisimple ring]] isomorphic to a square matrix ring over a division ring.  More generally, in any ring with a minimal one sided ideal, \"left primitive\"=\"right primitive\"=\"prime\".\n\nA [[commutative ring]] is left primitive if and only if it is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nBeing left primitive is a [[Morita equivalence|Morita invariant property]].\n\n== Examples ==\nEvery [[simple ring]] ''R'' with unity is both left and right primitive.  (However, a simple non-unital ring may not be primitive.)  This follows from the fact that [[maximal ideal#Properties|''R'' has a maximal left ideal]] ''M'', and the fact that the [[quotient module]] ''R''/''M'' is a simple left ''R''-module, and that its [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] is a proper two-sided ideal in ''R''. Since ''R'' is a simple ring, this annihilator is {0} and therefore ''R''/''M'' is a faithful left ''R''-module.\n\n[[Weyl algebra]]s over fields with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero are primitive, and since they are [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]s, they are examples without minimal one-sided ideals.<!-- how about positive char? -->\n\n===Full linear rings===\nA special case of primitive rings is that of ''full linear rings''.  A '''left full linear ring''' is the ring of ''all'' linear transformations of an infinite dimensional left vector space over a division ring.  (A '''right full linear ring''' differs by using a right vector space instead.)  In symbols, <math>R=\\mathrm{End}(_D V)\\,</math> where ''V'' is a vector space over a division ring ''D''.  It is known that ''R'' is a left full linear ring if and only if ''R'' is [[von Neumann regular]], [[Injective module#Self-injective rings|left self-injective]] with [[socle (mathematics)|socle]] soc(<sub>''R''</sub>''R'')≠{0}. {{harv|Goodearl|1991|p=100}} Through linear algebra arguments, it can be shown that <math>\\mathrm{End}(_D V)\\,</math> is isomorphic to the ring of [[matrix ring#Examples|row finite matrices]] <math>\\mathbb{RFM}_I(D)\\,</math>, where ''I'' is an index set whose size is the dimension of ''V'' over ''D''.  Likewise right full linear rings can be realized as column finite matrices over ''D''.\n\nUsing this we can see that there are non-simple left primitive rings.  By the Jacobson Density characterization, a left full linear ring ''R'' is always left primitive. When dim<sub>''D''</sub>''V'' is finite ''R'' is a square matrix ring over ''D'', but when dim<sub>''D''</sub>''V'' is infinite, the set of finite rank linear transformations is a proper two-sided ideal of ''R'', and hence ''R'' is not simple.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[primitive ideal]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation | doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1964-0167497-4 | last1=Bergman | first1=G.

The further requirement on a pseudogroup is related to the possibility of ''patching'' (in the sense of [[descent (category theory)|descent]], [[Transition map|transition functions]], or a [[gluing axiom]]).\n\nSpecifically, a '''pseudogroup''' on  a topological space ''S'' is a collection ''Γ'' of homeomorphisms between open subsets of ''S'' satisfying the following properties.<ref>Kobayashi, Shoshichi & Nomizu, Katsumi.

The properties of this pseudogroup are what makes it possible to define [[Riemann surface]]s by local data patched together.\n\nIn general, pseudogroups were studied as a possible theory of [[infinite-dimensional Lie group]]s. The concept of a '''local Lie group''', namely a pseudogroup of functions defined in neighbourhoods of the origin of ''E'', is actually closer to Lie's original concept of [[Lie group]], in the case where the transformations involved depend on a finite number of [[parameter]]s, than the contemporary definition via [[manifold]]s. One of Cartan's achievements was to clarify the points involved, including the point that a local Lie group always gives rise to a ''global'' group, in the current sense (an analogue of [[Lie's third theorem]], on [[Lie algebra]]s determining a group). The [[formal group]] is yet another approach to the specification of Lie groups, infinitesimally. It is known, however, that ''local [[topological group]]s'' do not necessarily have global counterparts.\n\nExamples of infinite-dimensional pseudogroups abound, beginning with the pseudogroup of all [[diffeomorphism]]s of ''E''. The interest is mainly in sub-pseudogroups of the diffeomorphisms, and therefore with objects that have a Lie algebra analogue of [[vector field]]s. Methods proposed by Lie and by Cartan for studying these objects have become more practical given the progress of [[computer algebra]].\n\nIn the 1950s Cartan's theory was reformulated by [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], and a general [[deformation theory]] for pseudogroups was developed by [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[D. C. Spencer]]. In the 1960s [[homological algebra]] was applied to the basic [[partial differential equation|PDE]] questions involved, of over-determination; this though revealed that the algebra of the theory is potentially very heavy. In the same decade the interest for [[theoretical physics]] of infinite-dimensional Lie theory appeared for the first time, in the shape of [[current algebra]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n*{{cite journal | author=St. Golab | title=Über den Begriff der \"Pseudogruppe von Transformationen\" | journal=Mathematische Annalen | year=1939 | volume=116 | pages=768–780 | doi=10.1007/BF01597390}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{springer|id=p/p075710|title=Pseudo-groups|author=Alekseevskii, D.V.}}\n\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n[[Category:Differential topology]]"

      "text": "In [[quantum geometry]] or [[noncommutative geometry]] a '''quantum differential calculus''' or '''noncommutative differential structure''' on an algebra <math>A</math> over a field <math>k</math> means the specification of a space of [[differential form]]s over the algebra.  The algebra <math>A</math> here is regarded as a [[coordinate ring]] but it is important that it may be noncommutative and hence not an actual algebra of coordinate functions on any actual space, so this represents a point of view replacing the specification of a differentiable structure for an actual space. In ordinary differential geometry one can multiply differential 1-forms by functions from the left and from the right, and there exists an exterior derivative.  Correspondingly, a first order quantum differential calculus means at least the following:\n\n1. An <math>A</math>-<math>A</math>-bimodule <math>\\Omega^1</math> over <math>A</math>, i.e. one can multiply elements of <math>\\Omega^1</math> by elements of <math>A</math> in an associative way:\n\n: <math> a(\\omega b)=(a\\omega)b,\\ \\forall a,b\\in A,\\ \\omega\\in\\Omega^1</math>.\n\n2. A linear map <math>{\\rm d}:A\\to\\Omega^1</math> obeying the Leibniz rule\n: <math>{\\rm d}(ab)=a({\\rm d}b)+({\\rm d}a)b,\\ \\forall a,b\\in A</math>\n\n3. <math>\\Omega^1=\\{a({\\rm d}b)\\ |\\ a,b\\in A\\}</math>\n\n4. (optional connectedness condition) <math>\\ker\\ {\\rm d}=k1</math>\n\nThe last condition is not always imposed but holds in ordinary geometry when the manifold is connected. It says that the only functions killed by <math>{\\rm d}</math> are constant functions.\n\nAn ''[[exterior algebra]]'' or ''differential [[graded algebra]]'' structure over <math>A</math> means a compatible extension of <math>\\Omega^1</math> to include analogues of higher order differential forms\n\n: <math>\\Omega=\\oplus_n\\Omega^n,\\ {\\rm d}:\\Omega^n\\to\\Omega^{n+1}</math>\n\nobeying a graded-Leibniz rule with respect to an associative product on <math>\\Omega</math> and obeying <math>{\\rm d}^2=0</math>. Here <math>\\Omega^0=A</math> and it is usually required that <math>\\Omega</math> is generated by <math>A,\\Omega^1</math>. The product of differential forms is called the [[wedge product|exterior or wedge product]] and often denoted <math>\\wedge</math>. The noncommutative or quantum [[de Rham cohomology]] is defined as the cohomology of this complex.\n\nA higher order differential calculus can mean an exterior algebra, or it can mean the partial specification of one, up to some highest degree, and with products that would result in a degree beyond the highest being unspecified.\n\nThe above definition lies at the crossroads of two approaches to noncommutative geometry. In the Connes approach a more fundamental object is a replacement for the [[Dirac operator]] in the form of a [[spectral triple]], and an exterior algebra can be constructed from this data. In the [[quantum group]]s approach to noncommutative geometry one starts with the algebra and a choice of first order calculus but constrained by covariance under a quantum group symmetry.\n\n==Note==\nThe above definition is minimal and gives something more general than classical differential calculus even when the algebra <math>A</math> is commutative or functions on an actual space. This is because we do ''not'' demand that\n\n: <math>a({\\rm d}b)=({\\rm db})a,\\ \\forall a,b\\in A</math>\n\nsince this would imply that <math>{\\rm d}(ab-ba)=0,\\ \\forall a,b\\in A</math>, which would violate axiom 4 when the algebra was noncommutative. As a byproduct, this enlarged definition includes finite difference calculi and quantum differential calculi on finite sets and finite groups (finite group [[Lie algebra]] theory).\n\n==Examples==\n1. For <math>A={\\mathbb C}[x]</math> the algebra of polynomials in one variable the translation-covariant quantum differential calculi are parametrized by <math>\\lambda\\in \\mathbb C</math> and take the form\n\n: <math> \\Omega^1={\\mathbb C}.{\\rm d}x,\\quad ({\\rm d}x)f(x)=f(x+\\lambda)({\\rm d}x),\\quad {\\rm d}f={f(x+\\lambda)-f(x)\\over\\lambda}{\\rm d}x</math>\n\nThis shows how finite differences arise naturally in quantum geometry. Only the limit <math>\\lambda\\to 0</math> has functions commuting with 1-forms, which is the special case of high school differential calculus.\n\n2. For <math>A={\\mathbb C}[t,t^{-1}]</math> the algebra of functions on an algebraic circle, the translation (i.e. circle-rotation)-covariant differential calculi are  parametrized by <math>q\\ne 0\\in \\mathbb C</math> and take the form\n\n: <math> \\Omega^1={\\mathbb C}.{\\rm d}t,\\quad ({\\rm d}t)f(t)=f(qt)({\\rm d}t),\\quad {\\rm d}f={f(qt)-f(t)\\over q(t-1)}\\,{\\rm dt}</math>\n\nThis shows how <math>q</math>-differentials arise naturally in quantum geometry.\n\n3. For any algebra <math>A</math> one has a '''universal differential calculus''' defined by\n\n: <math>\\Omega^1=\\ker(m:A\\otimes A\\to A),\\quad {\\rm d}a=1\\otimes a-a\\otimes 1,\\quad\\forall a\\in A</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the algebra product. By axiom 3., any first order calculus is a quotient of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quantum geometry]]\n*[[Noncommutative geometry]]\n*[[Quantum calculus]]\n*[[Quantum group]]\n*[[Quantum spacetime]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation| first=A.|last=Connes|title=Noncommutative geometry|publisher=[[Academic Press]]| year=1994| isbn=0-12-185860-X}}\n*{{citation | last1=Majid | first1=S. | title=A quantum groups primer | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | isbn=978-0-521-01041-2 |mr=1904789 | year=2002 | volume=292 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511549892}}\n\n[[Category:Noncommutative geometry]]\n[[Category:Algebraic structures]]"

To avoid this, we may write the unique <math>\\scriptstyle c \\;\\in\\; \\mathrm{R}</math> such that <math>\\scriptstyle a \\, \\triangleleft\\, c \\;=\\; b</math> as <math>\\scriptstyle b \\,\\triangleright\\, a</math>.

The third and fourth rack axioms then say that these left and right actions are inverses of each other.  Using this, we can eliminate either one of these actions from the definition of rack.  If we eliminate the right action and keep the left one, we obtain the terse definition given initially.\n\nMany different conventions are used in the literature on racks and quandles.  For example, many authors prefer to work with just the ''right'' action.  Furthermore, the use of the symbols <math>\\scriptstyle \\triangleleft </math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\triangleright </math> is by no means universal: many authors use exponential notation\n:<math>a \\triangleleft b = {}^a b</math>\n\nand\n:<math>b \\triangleright a = b^{a}</math>\n\nwhile many others write\n:<math>b \\triangleright a = b \\star a </math>\n\nYet another equivalent definition of a rack is that it is a set where each element acts on the left and right as [[automorphism]]s of the rack, with the left action being the inverse of the right one.  In this definition, the fact that each element acts as automorphisms encodes the left and right self-distributivity laws, and also these laws:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  a \\triangleleft(b \\triangleright c) &= (a \\triangleleft b) \\triangleright(a\\ \\triangleleft c) \\\\\n  (c \\triangleleft b) \\triangleright a &= (c \\triangleright a) \\triangleleft(b \\triangleright a)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich are consequences of the definition(s) given earlier.\n\n==Quandles==\nA '''quandle''' is defined as a rack, <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathrm{Q}\\,</math>, such that <math>\\scriptstyle \\forall a \\;\\in\\; \\mathrm{Q}</math>\n: <math>a \\triangleleft a = a</math>\n\nor equivalently\n: <math>a \\triangleright a = a</math>\n\n==Examples and applications==\nEvery group gives a quandle where the operations come from conjugation:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  a \\triangleleft b &= a b a^{-1} \\\\\n   b \\triangleright a &= a^{-1} b a \\\\\n                     &= a^{-1} \\triangleleft b\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn fact, every equational law satisfied by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] in a group follows from the quandle axioms.  So, one can think of a quandle as what is left of a group when we forget multiplication, the identity, and inverses, and only remember the operation of conjugation.\n\nEvery [[tame knot]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] has a 'fundamental quandle'.  To define this, one can note that the [[fundamental group]] of the knot complement, or [[knot group]], has a presentation (the [[Wirtinger presentation]]) in which the relations only involve conjugation.  So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle.  The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots.  In particular, if two knots have [[isomorphic]] fundamental quandles then there is a [[homeomorphism]] of three-dimensional Euclidean space, which may be [[orientation reversing]], taking one knot to the other.\n\nLess powerful but more easily computable invariants of knots may be obtained by counting the homomorphisms from the knot quandle to a fixed quandle <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathrm{Q}\\,</math>.  Since the Wirtinger presentation has one generator for each strand in a [[knot diagram]], these invariants can be computed by counting ways of labelling each strand by an element of <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathrm{Q}\\,</math>, subject to certain constraints.

Consider a pair (''A'',''L'') where ''A'' is a finite subset of ''M'' that generates ''M'' as a monoid, and ''L'' is a language on ''A'' (that is, a subset of the set of all strings ''A''<sup>∗</sup>).  Let φ be the map from the [[free monoid]] ''A''<sup>∗</sup> to ''M'' given by evaluating a string as a product in ''M''.  We say that ''L'' is a ''rational cross-section'' if φ induces a bijection between ''L'' and ''M''.  We say that (''A'',''L'') is a ''rational structure'' for ''M'' if in addition the [[Kernel (algebra)#Monoid homomorphisms|kernel]] of φ, viewed as a subset of the product monoid ''A''<sup>∗</sup>×''A''<sup>∗</sup> is a [[rational set]].\n\nA '''quasi-rational monoid''' is one for which ''L'' is a [[rational relation]]: a '''rational monoid''' is one for which there is also a [[rational function (monoid)|rational function]] cross-section of ''L''.  Since ''L'' is a subset of a free monoid, [[Kleene's theorem]] holds and a rational function is just one that can be instantiated by a finite state transducer.\n\n==Examples==\n* A finite monoid is rational.\n* A group is a rational monoid if and only if it is finite.\n* A finitely generated free monoid is rational.\n* The monoid M4 generated by the set {0,''e'', ''a'',''b'', ''x'',''y''} subject to relations in which ''e'' is the identity, 0 is an [[absorbing element]], each of ''a'' and ''b'' commutes with each of ''x'' and ''y'' and ''ax'' = ''bx'', ''ay'' = ''by'' = ''bby'', ''xx'' = ''xy'' = ''yx'' = ''yy'' = 0 is rational but not automatic.\n* The '''Fibonacci monoid''', the quotient of the free monoid on two generators {''a'',''b''}<sup>∗</sup> by the congruence ''aab'' = ''bba''.\n\n==Green's relations==\nThe [[Green's relations]] for a rational monoid satisfy ''D'' = ''J''.<ref name=Sak87>Sakarovitch (1987)</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nKleene's theorem holds for rational monoids: that is, a subset is a recognisable set if and only if it is a rational set.\n\nA rational monoid is not necessarily [[Automatic semigroup|automatic]], and vice versa.  However, a rational monoid is asynchronously automatic and [[Hyperbolic monoid|hyperbolic]].\n\nA rational monoid is a [[regulator monoid]] and a [[quasi-rational monoid]]: each of these implies that it is a [[Kleene monoid]], that is, a monoid in which Kleene's theorem holds.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Fichtner | first1=Ina | last2=Mathissen | first2=Christian | chapter=Rational transformations and a Kleene theorem for power series over rational monoids | zbl=1350.68191 | editor1-last=Gomes | editor1-first=Gracinda M.

A. Green]] in his influential 1951 paper \"On the structure of semigroups\"; this was also the paper in which [[Green's relations]] were introduced.  The concept of ''regularity'' in a semigroup was adapted from an analogous condition for [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], already considered by [[John von Neumann]].<ref>von Neumann 1936.</ref>  It was Green's study of regular semigroups which led him to define his celebrated [[Green's relations|relations]].  According to a footnote in Green 1951, the suggestion that the notion of regularity be applied to [[semigroup]]s was first made by [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]].\n\nThe term '''inversive semigroup''' (French: demi-groupe inversif) was historically used as synonym in the papers of [[Gabriel Thierrin]] (a student of [[Paul Dubreil]]) in the 1950s,<ref name=\"Hollings2014\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA181|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=181}}</ref><ref>http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~gab/pubr.html</ref> and it is still used occasionally.<ref name=\"Golan1999\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan S.

Then ''b'' serves as the required ''x'' in (1).  Conversely, if ''S'' is defined by (1), then ''xax'' is an inverse for ''a'', since ''a''(''xax'')''a'' = ''axa''(''xa'') = ''axa'' = ''a'' and (''xax'')''a''(''xax'') = ''x''(''axa'')(''xax'') = ''xa''(''xax'') = ''x''(''axa'')''x'' = ''xax''.<ref>Clifford and Preston 1961 : Lemma 1.14.</ref>\n\nThe set of inverses (in the above sense) of an element ''a'' in an arbitrary [[semigroup]] ''S'' is denoted by ''V''(''a'').<ref>Howie 1995 : p. 52.</ref>  Thus, another way of expressing definition (2) above is to say that in a regular semigroup, ''V''(''a'') is nonempty, for every ''a'' in ''S''.  The product of any element ''a'' with any ''b'' in ''V''(''a'') is always [[idempotent]]: ''abab'' = ''ab'', since ''aba'' = ''a''.<ref>Clifford and Preston 1961 : p. 26.</ref>\n\n=== Examples of regular semigroups ===\n*Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a regular semigroup.\n*Every [[band (mathematics)|band]] (idempotent semigroup) is regular in the sense of this article, though this is not what is meant by a [[band (mathematics)#Regular bands|regular band]].\n*The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is regular.\n*Any [[transformation semigroup|full transformation semigroup]] is regular.\n*A [[Rees matrix semigroup]] is regular.\n* The [[homomorphic image]] of a regular semigroup is regular.<ref>Howie 1995 : Lemma 2.4.4.</ref>\n\n=== Unique inverses and unique pseudoinverses ===\nA regular semigroup in which idempotents commute is an [[inverse semigroup]], or equivalently, every element has a ''unique'' inverse.  To see this, let ''S'' be a regular semigroup in which idempotents commute.  Then every element of ''S'' has at least one inverse.  Suppose that ''a'' in ''S'' has two inverses ''b'' and ''c'', i.e.,\n:''aba'' = ''a'', ''bab'' = ''b'', ''aca'' = ''a'' and ''cac'' = ''c''. Also ''ab'', ''ba'', ''ac'' and ''ca'' are idempotents as above.\nThen\n:''b'' = ''bab'' = ''b''(''aca'')''b'' = ''bac''(''a'')''b =''bac''(''aca'')''b = ''bac''(''ac'')(''ab'') = ''bac''(''ab'')(''ac'') = ''ba''(''ca'')''bac'' = ''ca''(''ba'')''bac'' = ''c''(''aba'')''bac'' = ''cabac'' = ''cac'' = ''c''.\nSo, by commuting the pairs of idempotents ''ab'' & ''ac'' and ''ba'' & ''ca'', the inverse of ''a'' is shown to be unique.  Conversely, it can be shown that any [[inverse semigroup]] is a regular semigroup in which idempotents commute.<ref name=\"Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1\">Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1.</ref>\n\nThe existence of a unique pseudoinverse implies the existence of a unique inverse, but the opposite is not true. For example, in the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]], the empty transformation Ø does not have a unique pseudoinverse, because Ø = Ø''f''Ø for any transformation ''f''. The inverse of Ø is unique however, because only one ''f'' satisfies the additional constraint that ''f'' = ''f''Ø''f'', namely ''f'' = Ø. This remark holds more generally in any semigroup with zero. Furthermore, if every element has a unique pseudoinverse, then the semigroup is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], and the unique pseudoinverse of an element coincides with the group inverse.<ref>Proof: http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&id=6391</ref>\n\n== Green's relations ==\nRecall that the [[principal ideal]]s of a semigroup ''S'' are defined in terms of ''S''<sup>1</sup>, the ''semigroup with identity adjoined''; this is to ensure that an element ''a'' belongs to the principal right, left and two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s which it generates.  In a regular semigroup ''S'', however, an element ''a'' = ''axa'' automatically belongs to these ideals, without recourse to adjoining an identity.  [[Green's relations]] can therefore be redefined for regular semigroups as follows:\n:<math>a\\,\\mathcal{L}\\,b</math> if, and only if, ''Sa'' = ''Sb'';\n:<math>a\\,\\mathcal{R}\\,b</math> if, and only if, ''aS'' = ''bS'';\n:<math>a\\,\\mathcal{J}\\,b</math> if, and only if, ''SaS'' = ''SbS''.<ref>Howie 1995 : 55.</ref>\n\nIn a regular semigroup ''S'', every <math>\\mathcal{L}</math>- and <math>\\mathcal{R}</math>-class contains at least one [[idempotent]].

The chapter title is Die Zahlringe des Körpers, literally \"the number rings of the field\". The word \"ring\" is the contraction of \"Zahlring\".]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''ring''' is one of the fundamental [[algebraic structure]]s used in [[abstract algebra]]. It consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] equipped with two [[binary operation]]s that generalize the [[arithmetic operation]]s of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. Through this generalization, theorems from [[arithmetic]] are extended to non-numerical objects such as [[polynomial]]s, [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[function (mathematics)|functions]].\n\nA ring is an [[abelian group]] with a second [[binary operation]] that is [[Associative property|associative]], is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over the abelian group operation, and has an [[identity element]] (this last property is not required by some authors, see {{slink||Notes on the definition}}). By extension from the [[integer]]s, the abelian group operation is called ''addition'' and the second binary operation is called ''multiplication''.\n\nWhether a ring is commutative or not (i.e., whether the order in which two elements are multiplied changes the result or not) has profound implications on its behavior as an abstract object. As a result, commutative ring theory, commonly known as [[commutative algebra]], is a key topic in [[ring theory]]. Its development has been greatly influenced by problems and ideas occurring naturally in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. Examples of commutative rings include the set of integers equipped with the addition and multiplication operations, the set of polynomials equipped with their addition and multiplication, the [[coordinate ring]] of an [[affine algebraic variety]], and the [[ring of integers]] of a number field. Examples of noncommutative rings include the ring of ''n'' × ''n'' real [[square matrix|square matrices]] with ''n'' ≥ 2, [[group ring]]s in [[representation theory]], [[operator algebra]]s in [[functional analysis]], [[ring of differential operators|rings of differential operators]] in the theory of [[differential operator]]s, and the [[cohomology ring]] of a [[topological space]] in [[topology]].\n\nThe conceptualization of rings began in the 1870s and was completed in the 1920s. Key contributors include [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Abraham Fraenkel|Fraenkel]], and [[Emmy Noether|Noether]]. Rings were first formalized as a generalization of [[Dedekind domain]]s that occur in [[number theory]], and of [[polynomial ring]]s and rings of invariants that occur in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[invariant theory]]. Afterward, they also proved to be useful in other branches of mathematics such as [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis]].\n{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}\n\n== Definition and illustration ==\n\nThe most familiar example of a ring is the set of all [[integer]]s, <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>, consisting of the [[number]]s\n\n: …&nbsp;, −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&nbsp;…\n\nThe familiar properties for addition and multiplication of integers serve as a model for the axioms for rings.\n\n=== Definition ===\nA '''ring''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s<ref>This means that each operation is defined and produces a unique result in ''R'' for each ordered pair of elements of ''R''.</ref> + and '''·''' satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the '''ring axioms'''<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|section=§I.8|year=1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Algebra|author1=[[Saunders MacLane]]|author2=Garrett Birkhoff|publisher=AMS Chelsea|page=85|year=1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=[[Serge Lang]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=83|year=2002|edition=Third}}</ref>\n\n# ''R'' is an [[abelian group]] under addition, meaning that:\n#* (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(that is, + is [[associativity|associative]]).\n#* ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(that is, + is [[commutativity|commutative]]).\n#* There is an element 0 in ''R'' such that ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(that is, 0 is the [[additive identity]]).\n#* For each ''a'' in ''R'' there exists −''a'' in ''R'' such that ''a'' + (−''a'') = 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(that is, −''a'' is the [[additive inverse]] of ''a'').\n# ''R'' is a [[monoid]] under multiplication, meaning that:\n#* (''a'' · ''b'') · ''c'' = ''a'' · (''b'' · ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(that is, · is associative).\n#* There is an element 1 in ''R'' such that ''a'' · 1 = ''a'' and 1 · ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(that is, 1 is the [[multiplicative identity]]).<ref>The existence of 1 is not assumed by some authors; here, the term ''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]'' is used if existence of a multiplicative identity is not assumed.<!-- This is the most common convention, and is adopted throughout wikipedia, please do not change --> See [[Ring (mathematics)#Notes on the definition|next subsection]]</ref>\n# Multiplication is [[distributive law|distributive]] with respect to addition, meaning that:\n#* ''a'' ⋅ (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(left distributivity).\n#* (''b'' + ''c'') · ''a'' = (''b'' · ''a'') + (''c'' · ''a'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(right distributivity).\n\n=== Notes on the definition ===\nAs explained in {{section link||History}} below, many authors follow an alternative convention in which a ring is not defined to have a multiplicative identity. This article adopts the convention that, unless otherwise stated, a ring is assumed to have such an identity.<!--- This is also the convention in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics]]. ---> A structure satisfying all the axioms ''except'' the requirement that there exists a multiplicative identity element is called a '''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]''' (commonly pronounced ''rung'', and sometimes called a '''[[pseudo-ring]]'''). For example, the set of even integers with the usual + and ⋅ is a rng, but not a ring.\n\nThe operations + and ⋅ are called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'', respectively. The multiplication symbol ⋅ is often omitted, so the [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] of ring elements is interpreted as multiplication. For example, ''xy'' means {{nowrap|''x'' ⋅ ''y''}}.\n\nAlthough ring addition is [[commutative law|commutative]], ring multiplication is not required to be commutative: ''ab'' need not necessarily equal ''ba''. Rings that also satisfy commutativity for multiplication (such as the ring of [[integer]]s) are called '''[[commutative ring]]s'''. Books on commutative algebra or algebraic geometry often adopt the convention that ''ring'' means ''commutative ring'', to simplify terminology.\n\nIn a ring, multiplication does not have to have an inverse. A (non-[[zero ring|trivial]]) commutative ring such that every nonzero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]] is called a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nThe additive group of a ring is the ring equipped just with the structure of addition. Although the definition assumes that the additive group is abelian, this can be inferred from the other ring axioms.<ref>I. M. Isaacs, Algebra: A Graduate Course, AMS, 1994, p. 160.</ref>\n\nSome authors define a ring without the requirement of associativity for multiplication <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Non-associative_rings_and_algebras |title=Non-associative rings and algebras |website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics}}</ref>. This general definition of a ring (that is, not necessary associative and not necessary unitary) is useful in the sense that then every [[Algebra over a field|Algebra]] is a ring.\n\n=== Basic properties ===\nSome basic properties of a ring follow immediately from the axioms:\n* The additive identity, the additive inverse of each element, and the multiplicative identity are unique.\n* For any element ''x'' in a ring ''R'', one has ''x''0 = 0 = 0''x'' (zero is an [[absorbing element]] with respect to multiplication) and (–1)''x'' = –''x''.\n* If 0 = 1 in a ring ''R'' (or more generally, 0 is a unit element), then ''R'' has only one element, and is called the [[zero ring]].\n* The [[binomial formula]] holds for any commuting pair of elements (i.e., any ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''xy'' = ''yx'').\n\n=== Example: Integers modulo 4 ===\n{{see also| Modular arithmetic}}\n\nEquip the set <math>\\mathbf{Z}_4 = \\left\\{\\overline{0}, \\overline{1}, \\overline{2}, \\overline{3}\\right\\}</math> with the following operations:\n\n* The sum <math>\\overline{x} + \\overline{y}</math> in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is the remainder when the integer ''x'' + ''y'' is divided by 4 (as ''x'' + ''y'' is always smaller than 8, this remainder is either ''x'' + ''y'' or ''x'' + ''y'' – 4). For example, <math>\\overline{2} + \\overline{3} = \\overline{1}</math> and <math>\\overline{3} + \\overline{3} = \\overline{2}</math>.\n* The product <math>\\overline{x} \\cdot \\overline{y}</math> in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is the remainder when the integer ''xy'' is divided by 4. For example, <math>\\overline{2} \\cdot \\overline{3} = \\overline{2}</math> and <math>\\overline{3} \\cdot \\overline{3} = \\overline{1}</math>.\n\nThen '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is a ring: each axiom follows from the corresponding axiom for '''Z'''. If ''x'' is an integer, the remainder of ''x'' when divided by 4 may be considered as an element of '''Z'''<sub>4</sub>, and this element is often denoted by {{nowrap|\"''x'' mod 4\"}} or <math>\\overline{x}</math>, which is consistent with the notation for 0, 1, 2, 3. The additive inverse of any <math>\\overline{x}</math> in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is <math>\\overline{-x}</math>. For example, <math>-\\overline{3} = \\overline{-3} = \\overline{1}.</math>\n\n=== Example: 2-by-2 matrices ===\n{{main|Matrix ring}}\nThe set of 2-by-2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with [[real number]] entries is written\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{M}_2(\\mathbb{R}) = \\left\\{ \\left.\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\right|\\  a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}. </math>\n\nWith the operations of matrix addition and [[matrix multiplication]], this set satisfies the above ring axioms. The element <math> \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math> is the multiplicative identity of the ring. If <math>A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math> and <math>B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>, then <math>AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math> while <math>BA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>; this example shows that the ring is noncommutative.\n\nMore generally, for any ring ''R'', commutative or not, and any nonnegative integer ''n'', one may form the ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with entries in ''R'': see [[Matrix ring]].\n\n== History ==\n\n{{See also|Ring theory#History}}\n[[File:Dedekind.jpeg|thumb|100px|right|[[Richard Dedekind]], one of the founders of [[ring theory]].]]\n\n=== Dedekind ===\nThe study of rings originated from the theory of [[polynomial ring]]s and the theory of [[algebraic integer]]s.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html The development of Ring Theory]</ref> In 1871, [[Richard Dedekind]] defined the concept of the ring of integers of a number field.<ref>Kleiner 1998, p.&nbsp;27.</ref> In this context, he introduced the terms \"ideal\" (inspired by [[Ernst Kummer]]'s notion of ideal number) and \"module\" and studied their properties. But Dedekind did not use the term \"ring\" and did not define the concept of a ring in a general setting.\n\n=== Hilbert ===\nThe term \"Zahlring\" (number ring) was coined by [[David Hilbert]] in 1892 and published in 1897.<ref>Hilbert 1897.</ref> In 19th century German, the word \"Ring\" could mean \"association\", which is still used today in English in a limited sense (e.g., spy ring),<ref>[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/117292/why-is-a-ring-called-a-ring Why is a ring called a \"ring\"? - MathOverflow]</ref> so if that were the etymology then it would be similar to the way \"group\" entered mathematics by being a non-technical word for \"collection of related things\". According to Harvey Cohn, Hilbert used the term for a ring that had the property of \"circling directly back\" to an element of itself.<ref>{{Citation|last=Cohn|first=Harvey|title=Advanced Number Theory|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|year=1980|page=49|isbn=978-0-486-64023-5}}</ref> Specifically, in a ring of algebraic integers, all high powers of an algebraic integer can be written as an integral combination of a fixed set of lower powers, and thus the powers \"cycle back\". For instance, if {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>3</sup> − 4''a'' + 1 = 0}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>3</sup> = 4''a'' − 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>4</sup> = 4''a''<sup>2</sup> − ''a''}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>5</sup> = −''a''<sup>2</sup> + 16''a'' − 4}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>6</sup> = 16''a''<sup>2</sup> − 8''a'' + 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>7</sup> = −8''a''<sup>2</sup> + 65''a'' − 16}}, and so on; in general, ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> is going to be an integral linear combination of 1, ''a'', and ''a''<sup>2</sup>.\n\n=== Fraenkel and Noether ===\nThe first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by [[Abraham Fraenkel|Adolf Fraenkel]] in 1914,<ref>Fraenkel, pp.&nbsp;143–145</ref><ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 86, footnote 1.</ref> but his axioms were stricter than those in the modern definition. For instance, he required every [[zero divisor|non-zero-divisor]] to have a [[multiplicative inverse]].<ref>Fraenkel, p.&nbsp;144, axiom&nbsp;''R''<sub>8)</sub>.</ref> In 1921, [[Emmy Noether]] gave the modern axiomatic definition of [[commutative ring|(commutative) ring]] and developed the foundations of commutative ring theory in her paper ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen''.<ref name=\"Noether, p. 29\">Noether, p.&nbsp;29.</ref>\n\n=== Multiplicative identity: mandatory vs. optional ===\nFraenkel required a ring to have a multiplicative identity 1,<ref>Fraenkel, p.&nbsp;144, axiom&nbsp;''R''<sub>7)</sub>.</ref> whereas Noether did not.<ref name=\"Noether, p. 29\"/>\n\nMost or all books on algebra<ref>Van der Waerden, 1930.</ref><ref>Zariski and Samuel, 1958.</ref> up to around 1960 followed Noether's convention of not requiring a 1. Starting in the 1960s, it became increasingly common to see books including the existence of 1 in the definition of ring, especially in advanced books by notable authors such as Artin,<ref>Artin, p.&nbsp;346.</ref> Atiyah and MacDonald,<ref>Atiyah and MacDonald, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Bourbaki,<ref>Bourbaki, p.&nbsp;96.</ref> Eisenbud,<ref>Eisenbud, p.&nbsp;11.</ref> and Lang.<ref>Lang, p.&nbsp;83.</ref> But even today, there are many books that do not require a 1.<ref>Gallian, p.&nbsp;235.</ref><ref>Hungerford, p.&nbsp;42.</ref><ref>Warner, p.&nbsp;188.</ref>\n\nFaced with this terminological ambiguity, some authors have tried to impose their views, while others have tried to adopt more precise terms.\n\nIn the first category, we find for instance Gardner and Wiegandt, who argue that if one requires all rings to have a 1, then some consequences include the lack of existence of infinite direct sums of rings, and the fact that proper direct summands of rings are not subrings. They conclude that \"in many, maybe most, branches of ring theory the requirement of the existence of a unity element is not sensible, and therefore unacceptable.\"<ref>Gardner and Wiegandt 2003.</ref>  [[Bjorn Poonen|Poonen]] makes the counterargument that rings without a multiplicative identity are not totally associative (the product of any finite sequence of ring elements, including the empty sequence, is well-defined, independent of the order of operations) and writes \"the natural extension of associativity demands that rings should contain an empty product, so it is natural to require rings to have a 1\" <ref>Poonen 2018.</ref>.\n\nIn the second category, we find authors who use the following terms:<ref>Wilder 1965, p. 176.</ref><ref>Rotman 1998, p. 7.</ref>\n\n:* rings with multiplicative identity: ''unital ring'', ''unitary ring'', ''unit ring'', ''ring with unity'', ''ring with identity'', or ''ring with 1''\n:* rings not requiring multiplicative identity: ''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]'' or ''[[pseudo-ring]]'',<ref>Bourbaki, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> although the latter may be confusing, as having other meanings.\n\n== Basic examples ==\n\n=== Commutative rings ===\n* The prototype example is the ring of [[integer]]s with the two operations of addition and multiplication.\n* The rational, real and complex numbers are commutative rings of a type called [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n* An [[algebra over a ring]] is itself a ring. These are also [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. Some examples:\n** Any [[algebra over a field]].\n** The [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''X''] of polynomials over a ring ''R'' is itself a ring. A [[free module]] over ''R'' of infinite dimension.\n** <math>\\mathbf{Z}[c]</math>, the integers with an irrational number ''c'' adjoined. A free module of infinite dimension if ''c'' is a [[transcendental number]], a free module of finite dimension if ''c'' is an [[algebraic integer]].\n** <math>\\mathbf{Z}[1/n]</math>, the set of [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] whose denominators are a power of ''n'' (including negative ones). A non-free module.\n** <math>\\mathbf{Z}[1/10]</math>, the set of [[decimal fraction]]s.\n** <math>\\mathbf{Z}\\left[\\left(1 + \\sqrt{d}\\right)/2\\right]</math>, where ''d'' is a [[square-free]] integer of the form 4''n'' + 1. A free module of rank two. Cf. [[Quadratic integer]]s.\n** <math>\\mathbf{Z}[i]</math>, the [[Gaussian integer]]s.\n** <math>\\mathbf{Z}\\left[\\left(1 + \\sqrt{-3}\\right)/2\\right]</math>, the [[Eisenstein integer]]s. Also their generalization, a [[Kummer ring]].\n* The set of all [[algebraic integer]]s forms a ring. This follows for example from the fact that it is the [[integral closure]] of the ring of rational integers in the field of complex numbers. The rings in the three previous examples are subrings of this ring.\n* The set of [[formal power series]] ''R''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''X''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub><nowiki>]]</nowiki> over a commutative ring ''R'' is a ring.\n* If ''S'' is a set, then the [[power set]] of ''S'' becomes a ring if we define addition to be the [[symmetric difference]] of sets and multiplication to be [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. This corresponds to a [[ring of sets]] and is an example of a [[Boolean ring]].\n* The set of all [[continuous function|continuous]] real-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on the real line forms a commutative ring. The operations are [[pointwise]] addition and multiplication of functions.\n* Let ''X'' be a set and ''R'' a ring. Then the set of all functions from ''X'' to ''R'' forms a ring, which is commutative if ''R'' is commutative. The ring of continuous functions in the previous example is a subring of this ring if ''X'' is the real line and ''R'' is the field of real numbers.\n\n=== Noncommutative rings ===\n* For any ring ''R'' and any natural number ''n'', the set of all square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from ''R'', forms a ring with matrix addition and matrix multiplication as operations. For ''n'' = 1, this matrix ring is isomorphic to ''R'' itself. For ''n'' > 1 (and ''R'' not the zero ring), this matrix ring is noncommutative.\n* If ''G'' is an [[abelian group]], then the [[group homomorphism|endomorphisms]] of ''G'' form a ring, the [[endomorphism ring]] End(''G'') of ''G''. The operations in this ring are addition and composition of endomorphisms. More generally, if ''V'' is a [[left module]] over a ring ''R'', then the set of all ''R''-linear maps forms a ring, also called the endomorphism ring and denoted by End<sub>''R''</sub>(''V'').\n* If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''R'' is a ring, the [[group ring]] of ''G'' over ''R'' is a [[free module]] over ''R'' having ''G'' as basis. Multiplication is defined by the rules that the elements of ''G'' commute with the elements of ''R'' and multiply together as they do in the group ''G''.\n* Many rings that appear in analysis are noncommutative. For example, most [[Banach algebra]]s are noncommutative.\n\n=== Non-rings ===\n{{unordered list\n| The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the usual operations is not a ring, since ('''N''', +) is not even a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (the elements are not all [[invertible]] with respect to [[addition]]). For instance, there is no [[natural number]] which can be added to 3 to get 0 as a result. There is a natural way to make it a ring by adding negative numbers to the set, thus obtaining the ring of [[integer]]s. The natural numbers (including 0) form an algebraic structure known as a [[semiring]] (which has all of the properties of a ring except the additive inverse property).\n| Let ''R'' be the set of all continuous functions on the real line that vanish outside a bounded interval depending on the function, with addition as usual but with multiplication defined as [[convolution]]:\n: <math>(f * g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(y)g(x - y)dy.</math>\n\nThen ''R'' is a [[rng (algebra)|rng]], but not a ring: the [[Dirac delta function]] has the property of a multiplicative identity, but it is not a function and hence is not an element of ''R''.\n}}\n\n== Basic concepts ==\n\n=== Elements in a ring ===\nA left [[zero divisor]] of a ring <math>R</math> is a nonzero element <math>a</math> in the ring such that there exists a nonzero element <math>b</math> of <math>R</math> such that <math>ab = 0</math>.<ref>This is the definition of Bourbaki. Some other authors such as Lang require a zero divisor to be nonzero.</ref> A right zero divisor is defined similarly.\n\nA [[nilpotent element]] is an element <math>a</math> such that <math>a^n = 0</math> for some <math>n > 0</math>. One example of a nilpotent element is a [[nilpotent matrix]]. A nilpotent element in a [[zero ring|nonzero ring]] is necessarily a zero divisor.\n\nAn [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]] <math>e</math> is an element such that <math>e^2 = e</math>. One example of an idempotent element is a [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] in linear algebra.\n\nA [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] is an element <math>a</math> having a [[multiplicative inverse]]; in this case the inverse is unique, and is denoted by <math>a^{-1}</math>. The set of units of a ring is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under ring multiplication; this group is denoted by <math>R^\\times</math> or <math>R^*</math> or <math>U(R)</math>. For example, if ''R'' is the ring of all square matrices of size ''n'' over a field, then <math>R^\\times</math> consists of the set of all invertible matrices of size ''n'', and is called the [[general linear group]].\n\n=== Subring ===\n{{main|Subring}}\nA subset ''S'' of ''R'' is said to be a [[subring]] if it can be regarded as a ring with the addition and the multiplication [[restricted function|restricted]] from ''R'' to ''S''. Equivalently, ''S'' is a subring if it is not empty, and for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'', <math>xy</math>, <math>x+y</math> and <math>-x</math> are in ''S''. If all rings have been assumed, by convention, to have a multiplicative identity, then to be a subring one would also require ''S'' to share the same identity element as ''R''.<ref>In the unital case, like addition and multiplication, the multiplicative identity must be restricted from the original ring. The definition is also equivalent to requiring the set-theoretic inclusion is a ring homomorphism.</ref> So if all rings have been assumed to have a multiplicative identity, then a proper ideal is not a subring.\n\nFor example, the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is a subring of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s and also a subring of the ring of [[polynomial]]s '''Z'''[''X''] (in both cases, '''Z''' contains 1, which is the multiplicative identity of the larger rings). On the other hand, the subset of even integers 2'''Z''' does not contain the identity element 1 and thus does not qualify as a subring of '''Z'''.\n\nAn intersection of subrings is a subring. The smallest subring containing a given subset ''E'' of ''R'' is called a subring generated by ''E''. Such a subring exists since it is the intersection of all subrings containing ''E''.\n\nFor a ring ''R'', the smallest subring containing 1 is called the ''characteristic subring'' of ''R''. It can be obtained by adding copies of 1 and −1 together many times in any mixture. It is possible that <math>n\\cdot 1=1+1+\\ldots+1</math> (''n'' times) can be zero. If ''n'' is the smallest positive integer such that this occurs, then ''n'' is called the ''[[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]'' of ''R''. In some rings, <math>n\\cdot 1</math> is never zero for any positive integer ''n'', and those rings are said to have ''characteristic zero''.<!-- By using a homomorphism from the integers into ''R'' that sends 1 to 1, it can be shown by an isomorphism theorem that the characteristic subring is always a quotient ring of the integers. The problem: we haven't introduced homomorphisms and quotient rings yet. -->\n\nGiven a ring ''R'', let <math>\\operatorname{Z}(R)</math> denote the set of all elements ''x'' in ''R'' such that ''x'' commutes with every element in ''R'': <math>xy = yx</math> for any ''y'' in ''R''. Then <math>\\operatorname{Z}(R)</math> is a subring of ''R''; called the [[center (algebra)|center]] of ''R''. More generally, given a subset ''X'' of ''R'', let ''S'' be the set of all elements in ''R'' that commute with every element in ''X''. Then ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', called the [[centralizer (ring theory)|centralizer]] (or commutant) of ''X''. The center is the centralizer of the entire ring ''R''. Elements or subsets of the center are said to be ''central'' in ''R''; they generate a subring of the center.\n\n=== Ideal ===\n{{main|Ideal (ring theory)}}\nThe definition of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a ring is analogous to that of [[normal subgroup]] in a group. But, in actuality, it plays a role of an idealized generalization of an element in a ring; hence, the name \"ideal\". Like elements of rings, the study of ideals is central to structural understanding of a ring.\n\nLet ''R'' be a ring. A nonempty subset ''I'' of ''R'' is then said to be a '''left ideal''' in ''R'' if, for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' and ''r'' in ''R'', <math>x+y</math> and <math>rx</math> are in ''I''. If <math>R I</math> denotes the span of ''I'' over ''R''; i.e., the set of finite sums\n:<math>r_1 x_1 + \\cdots + r_n x_n, \\quad r_i \\in R, \\quad x_i \\in I,</math>\nthen ''I'' is a left ideal if <math>R I \\subseteq I</math>. Similarly, ''I'' is said to be '''right ideal''' if <math>I R \\subseteq I</math>. A subset ''I'' is said to be a '''two-sided ideal''' or simply '''ideal''' if it is both a left ideal and right ideal. A one-sided or two-sided ideal is then an additive subgroup of ''R''. If ''E'' is a subset of ''R'', then <math>R E</math> is a left ideal, called the left ideal generated by ''E''; it is the smallest left ideal containing ''E''. Similarly, one can consider the right ideal or the two-sided ideal generated by a subset of ''R''.\n\nIf ''x'' is in ''R'', then <math>Rx</math> and <math>xR</math> are left ideals and right ideals, respectively; they are called the [[principal ideal|principal]] left ideals and right ideals generated by ''x''. The principal ideal <math>RxR</math> is written as <math>(x)</math>. For example, the set of all positive and negative multiples of 2 along with 0 form an ideal of the integers, and this ideal is generated by the integer 2. In fact, every ideal of the ring of integers is principal.\n\nLike a group, a ring is said to be [[simple ring|simple]] if it is nonzero and it has no proper nonzero two-sided ideals. A commutative simple ring is precisely a field.\n\nRings are often studied with special conditions set upon their ideals. For example, a ring in which there is no strictly increasing infinite [[total order#Chains|chain]] of left ideals is called a left [[Noetherian ring]]. A ring in which there is no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left [[Artinian ring]]. It is a somewhat surprising fact that a left Artinian ring is left Noetherian (the [[Hopkins–Levitzki theorem]]). The integers, however, form a Noetherian ring which is not Artinian.\n\nFor commutative rings, the ideals generalize the classical notion of divisibility and decomposition of an integer into prime numbers in algebra. A proper ideal ''P'' of ''R'' is called a [[prime ideal]] if for any elements <math>x, y\\in R</math> we have that <math>xy \\in P</math> implies either <math>x \\in P</math> or <math>y\\in P</math>. Equivalently, ''P'' is prime if for any ideals <math>I, J</math> we have that <math>IJ \\subseteq P</math> implies either <math>I \\subseteq P</math> or <math>J \\subseteq P.</math> This latter formulation illustrates the idea of ideals as generalizations of elements.\n\n=== Homomorphism ===\n{{main|Ring homomorphism}}\nA '''[[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]]''' from a ring (''R'', +, '''·''') to a ring (''S'', ‡, *) is a function ''f'' from ''R'' to ''S'' that preserves the ring operations; namely, such that, for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' the following identities hold:\n\n* ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ‡ ''f''(''b'')\n* ''f''(''a'' '''·''' ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') * ''f''(''b'')\n* ''f''(1<sub>''R''</sub>) = 1<sub>''S''</sub>\n\nIf one is working with not necessarily unital rings, then the third condition is dropped.\n\nA ring homomorphism is said to be an '''[[isomorphism]]''' if there exists an inverse homomorphism to ''f'' (i.e., a ring homomorphism which is an [[inverse function]]). Any [[bijection|bijective]] ring homomorphism is a ring isomorphism. Two rings <math>R, S</math> are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them and in that case one writes <math>R \\simeq S</math>. A ring homomorphism between the same ring is called an endomorphism and an isomorphism between the same ring an automorphism.\n\nExamples:\n* The function that maps each integer ''x'' to its remainder modulo 4 (a number in {0, 1, 2, 3}) is a homomorphism from the ring '''Z''' to the quotient ring '''Z'''/4'''Z''' (\"quotient ring\" is defined below).\n* If <math>u</math> is a unit element in a ring ''R'', then <math>R \\to R, x \\mapsto uxu^{-1}</math> is a ring homomorphism, called an [[inner automorphism]] of ''R''.\n* Let ''R'' be a commutative ring of prime characteristic ''p''. Then <math>x \\mapsto x^p</math> is a ring endomorphism of ''R'' called the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].\n* The [[Galois group]] of a field extension <math>L/K</math> is the set of all automorphisms of ''L'' whose restrictions to ''K'' are the identity.\n* For any ring ''R'', there are a unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' → ''R'' and a unique ring homomorphism ''R'' → 0.\n* An [[epimorphism]] (i.e., right-cancelable morphism) of rings need not be surjective. For example, the unique map <math>\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Q}</math> is an epimorphism.\n* An algebra homomorphism from a ''k''-algebra to the [[endomorphism algebra]] of a vector space over ''k'' is called a [[algebra representation|representation of the algebra]].\n\nGiven a ring homomorphism <math>f:R \\to S</math>, the set of all elements mapped to 0 by ''f'' is called the [[kernel of a ring homomorphism|kernel]] of ''f''. The kernel is a two-sided ideal of ''R''. The image of ''f'', on the other hand, is not always an ideal, but it is always a subring of ''S''.\n\nTo give a ring homomorphism from a commutative ring ''R'' to a ring ''A'' with image contained in the center of ''A'' is the same as to give a structure of an [[associative algebra|algebra]] over ''R'' to ''A'' (in particular gives a structure of ''A''-module).\n\n=== Quotient ring ===\n{{main|Quotient ring}}\nThe '''[[quotient ring]]''' of a ring, is analogous to the notion of a [[quotient group]] of a group. More formally, given a ring (''R'', +, '''·''' ) and a [[Ideal (ring theory)|two-sided ideal]] ''I'' of (''R'', +, '''·''' ), the '''quotient ring''' (or '''factor ring''') ''R/I'' is the set of cosets of ''I'' (with respect to the [[additive group]] of (''R'', +, '''·''' ); i.e. cosets with respect to (''R'', +)) together with the operations:\n\n:(''a'' + ''I'') + (''b'' + ''I'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''I'' and\n:(''a'' + ''I'')(''b'' + ''I'') = (''ab'') + ''I''.\n\nfor every ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''.\n\nLike the case of a quotient group, there is a canonical map <math>p: R \\to R/I</math> given by <math>x \\mapsto x + I</math>. It is surjective and satisfies the universal property: if <math>f:R \\to S</math> is a ring homomorphism such that <math>f(I) = 0</math>, then there is a unique <math>\\overline{f}: R/I \\to S</math>\nsuch that <math>f = \\overline{f} \\circ p</math>. In particular, taking ''I'' to be the kernel, one sees that the quotient ring <math>R / \\operatorname{ker} f</math> is isomorphic to the image of ''f''; the fact known as the first [[isomorphism theorem]]. The last fact implies that actually ''any'' surjective ring homomorphism satisfies the universal property since the image of such a map is a quotient ring.\n<!-- need more work: A subset of ''R'' and the quotient <math>R/I</math> are related in the following way. A subset of ''R'' is called a [[system of representatives]] of <math>R/I</math> if no two elements in the set belong to the same coset; i.e., each element in the set represents a unique coset. It is said to be complete if the restriction of <math>R \\to R/I</math> to it is surjective. -->\n\n== Module ==\n{{main|Module (mathematics)}}\n\nThe concept of a ''module over a ring'' generalizes the concept of a [[vector space]] (over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) by generalizing from multiplication of vectors with elements of a field ([[scalar multiplication]]) to multiplication with elements of a ring. More precisely, given a ring {{math|''R''}} with 1, an {{math|''R''}}-module {{math|''M''}} is an [[abelian group]] equipped with an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] {{math|''R'' &times; ''M'' → ''M''}} (associating an element of {{math|''M''}} to every pair of an element of {{math|''R''}} and an element of {{math|''M''}}) that satisfies certain [[axiom#Non-logical axioms|axioms]]. This operation is commonly denoted multiplicatively and called multiplication. The axioms of modules are the following: for all {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{math|''R''}} and all {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in {{math|''M''}}, we have:\n* {{math|''M''}} is an abelian group under addition.\n* <math>a(x+y)=ax+ay</math>\n* <math>(a+b)x=ax+bx</math>\n* <math>1x=x</math>\n* <math>(ab)x=a(bx)</math>\nWhen the ring is [[noncommutative ring|noncommutative]] these axioms define ''left modules''; ''right modules'' are defined similarly by writing {{math|''xa''}} instead of {{math|''ax''}}. This is not only a change of notation, as the last axiom of right modules (that is {{math|1=''x''(''ab'') = (''xa'')''b''}}) becomes {{math|1=(''ab'')''x'' = ''b''(''ax'')}}, if left multiplication (by ring elements) is used for a right module.\n\nBasic examples of modules are ideals, including the ring itself.\n\nAlthough similarly defined, the theory of modules is much more complicated than that of vector space, mainly, because, unlike vector spaces, modules are not characterized (up to an isomorphism) by a single invariant (the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension of a vector space]]). In particular, not all modules have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].\n\nThe axioms of modules imply that {{math|1=(−1)''x'' = −''x''}}, where the first minus denotes the [[additive inverse]] in the ring and the second minus the additive inverse in the module. Using this and denoting repeated addition by a multiplication by a positive integer allows identifying abelian groups with modules over the ring of integers.\n\nAny ring homomorphism induces a structure of a module: if {{math|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} is a ring homomorphism, then {{math|''S''}} is a left module over {{math|''R''}} by the multiplication: {{nowrap|1=''rs'' = ''f''(''r'')''s''}}. If {{math|''R''}} is commutative or if {{math|''f''(''R'')}} is contained in the [[center of a ring|center]] of {{math|''S''}}, the ring {{math|''S''}} is called a {{math|''R''}}-[[algebra over a ring|algebra]]. In particular, every ring is an algebra over the integers.\n\n== Constructions ==\n\n=== Direct product ===\n{{Main|Direct product of rings}}\n\nLet ''R'' and ''S'' be rings. Then the [[cartesian product|product]] {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} can be equipped with the following natural ring structure:\n\n* (''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub>) + (''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>) = (''r''<sub>1</sub> + ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub> + ''s''<sub>2</sub>)\n* (''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub>) ⋅ (''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>) = (''r''<sub>1</sub> ⋅ ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub> ⋅ ''s''<sub>2</sub>)\n\nfor every ''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub> in ''R'' and ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> in ''S''. The ring {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} with the above operations of addition and multiplication and the multiplicative identity <math>(1, 1)</math> is called the '''[[Direct product of rings|direct product]]''' of ''R'' with ''S''. The same construction also works for an arbitrary family of rings: if <math>R_i</math> are rings indexed by a set ''I'', then <math>\\prod_{i \\in I} R_i</math> is a ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.\n\nLet ''R'' be a commutative ring and <math>\\mathfrak{a}_1, \\cdots,  \\mathfrak{a}_n</math> be ideals such that <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i +  \\mathfrak{a}_j = (1)</math> whenever <math>i \\ne j</math>. Then the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] says there is a canonical ring isomorphism:\n:<math>R /{\\textstyle \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\\mathfrak{a}_i}} \\simeq \\prod_{i=1}^{n}{R/ \\mathfrak{a}_i}, \\qquad x \\;\\operatorname{mod}\\; {\\textstyle \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\\mathfrak{a}_i}} \\mapsto (x \\;\\operatorname{mod}\\; \\mathfrak{a}_1, \\ldots , x \\;\\operatorname{mod}\\; \\mathfrak{a}_n)</math>.\n\nA \"finite\" direct product may also be viewed as a direct sum of ideals.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=Theorem 4.5.1}}</ref> Namely, let <math>R_i, 1 \\le i \\le n</math> be rings, <math>R_i \\to R = \\prod R_i</math> the inclusions with the images <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i</math> (in particular <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i</math> are rings though not subrings). Then <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i</math> are ideals of ''R'' and\n:<math>R = \\mathfrak{a}_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus  \\mathfrak{a}_n, \\quad \\mathfrak{a}_i \\mathfrak{a}_j = 0, i \\ne j, \\quad \\mathfrak{a}_i^2 \\subseteq \\mathfrak{a}_i</math>\nas a direct sum of abelian groups (because for abelian groups finite products are the same as direct sums). Clearly the direct sum of such ideals also defines a product of rings that is isomorphic to ''R''. Equivalently, the above can be done through [[central idempotent]]s. Assume ''R'' has the above decomposition. Then we can write\n:<math>1 = e_1 + \\cdots + e_n, \\quad e_i \\in \\mathfrak{a}_i.</math>\nBy the conditions on <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i</math>, one has that <math>e_i</math> are central idempotents and <math>e_i e_j = 0, i \\ne j</math> (orthogonal). Again, one can reverse the construction. Namely, if one is given a partition of 1 in orthogonal central idempotents, then let <math>\\mathfrak{a}_i = R e_i</math>, which are two-sided ideals. If each <math>e_i</math> is not a sum of orthogonal central idempotents,<ref>such a central idempotent is called [[centrally primitive]].</ref> then their direct sum is isomorphic to ''R''.\n\nAn important application of an infinite direct product is the construction of a [[projective limit]] of rings (see below). Another application is a [[restricted product]] of a family of rings (cf. [[adele ring]]).\n\n=== Polynomial ring ===\n{{main|Polynomial ring}}\n\nGiven a symbol ''t'' (called a variable) and a commutative ring ''R'', the set of polynomials\n\n: <math>R[t] = \\left\\{ a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n -1} + \\dots + a_1 t + a_0  \\mid n \\ge 0, a_j \\in R \\right\\}</math>\n\nforms a commutative ring with the usual addition and multiplication, containing ''R'' as a subring. It is called the [[polynomial ring]] over ''R''. More generally, the set <math>R\\left[t_1, \\ldots, t_n\\right]</math> of all polynomials in variables <math>t_1, \\ldots, t_n</math> forms a commutative ring, containing <math>R\\left[t_i\\right]</math> as subrings.\n\nIf ''R'' is an integral domain, then <math>R[t]</math> is also an integral domain; its field of fractions is the field of [[rational function]]s. If ''R'' is a noetherian ring, then <math>R[t]</math> is a noetherian ring. If ''R'' is a unique factorization domain, then <math>R[t]</math> is a unique factorization domain. Finally, ''R'' is a field if and only if <math>R[t]</math> is a principal ideal domain.\n\nLet <math>R \\subseteq S</math> be commutative rings. Given an element ''x'' of ''S'', one can consider the ring homomorphism\n: <math>R[t] \\to S, \\quad f \\mapsto f(x)</math>\n\n(i.e., the [[substitution (algebra)|substitution]]). If ''S'' = ''R''[''t''] and ''x'' = ''t'', then ''f''(''t'') = ''f''. Because of this, the polynomial ''f'' is often also denoted by <math>f(t)</math>. The image of the map <math>f \\mapsto f(x)</math> is denoted by <math>R[x]</math>; it is the same thing as the subring of ''S'' generated by ''R'' and ''x''.\n\nExample: <math>k\\left[t^2, t^3\\right]</math> denotes the image of the homomorphism\n:<math>k[x, y] \\to k[t], \\, f \\mapsto f\\left(t^2, t^3\\right).</math>\n\nIn other words, it is the subalgebra of <math>k[t]</math> generated by ''t''<sup>2</sup> and ''t''<sup>3</sup>.\n\nExample: let ''f'' be a polynomial in one variable; i.e., an element in a polynomial ring ''R''. Then <math>f(x+h)</math> is an element in <math>R[h]</math> and <math>f(x + h) - f(x)</math> is divisible by ''h'' in that ring. The result of substituting zero to ''h'' in <math>(f(x + h) - f(x))/h</math> is <math>f'(x)</math>, the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.\n\nThe substitution is a special case of the universal property of a polynomial ring. The property states: given a ring homomorphism <math>\\phi: R \\to S</math> and an element ''x'' in ''S'' there exists a unique ring homomorphism <math>\\overline{\\phi}: R[t] \\to S</math> such that <math>\\overline{\\phi}(t) = x</math> and <math>\\overline{\\phi}</math> restricts to <math>\\phi</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobson|1974|loc=Theorem 2.10}}</ref> For example, choosing a basis, a [[symmetric algebra]] satisfies the universal property and so is a polynomial ring.\n\nTo give an example, let ''S'' be the ring of all functions from ''R'' to itself; the addition and the multiplication are those of functions. Let ''x'' be the identity function. Each ''r'' in ''R'' defines a constant function, giving rise to the homomorphism <math>R \\to S</math>. The universal property says that this map extends uniquely to\n:<math>R[t] \\to S, \\quad f \\mapsto \\overline{f}</math>\n(''t'' maps to ''x'') where <math>\\overline{f}</math> is the [[polynomial function]] defined by ''f''. The resulting map is injective if and only if ''R'' is infinite.\n\nGiven a non-constant monic polynomial ''f'' in <math>R[t]</math>, there exists a ring ''S'' containing ''R'' such that ''f'' is a product of linear factors in <math>S[t]</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|Algèbre commutative|loc=Ch 5. §1, Lemma 2}}</ref>\n\nLet ''k'' be an algebraically closed field. The [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] (theorem of zeros) states that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of all prime ideals in <math>k\\left[t_1, \\ldots, t_n\\right]</math> and the set of closed subvarieties of <math>k^n</math>. In particular, many local problems in algebraic geometry may be attacked through the study of the generators of an ideal in a polynomial ring. (cf. [[Gröbner basis]].)\n\nThere are some other related constructions. A [[formal power series ring]] <math>R[\\![t]\\!]</math> consists of formal power series\n: <math>\\sum_0^\\infty a_i t^i, \\quad a_i \\in R</math>\n\ntogether with multiplication and addition that mimic those for convergent series. It contains <math>R[t]</math> as a subring. Note a formal power series ring does not have the universal property of a polynomial ring; a series may not converge after a substitution. The important advantage of a formal power series ring over a polynomial ring is that it is [[local ring|local]] (in fact, [[complete ring|complete]]).\n\n=== Matrix ring and endomorphism ring ===\n{{Main|Matrix ring|Endomorphism ring}}\n\nLet ''R'' be a ring (not necessarily commutative). The set of all square matrices of size ''n'' with entries in ''R'' forms a ring with the entry-wise addition and the usual [[matrix multiplication]]. It is called the [[matrix ring]] and is denoted by M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R''). Given a right ''R''-module <math>U</math>, the set of all ''R''-linear maps from ''U'' to itself forms a ring with addition that is of function and multiplication that is of [[composition of functions]]; it is called the endomorphism ring of ''U'' and is denoted by <math>\\operatorname{End}_R(U)</math>.\n\nAs in linear algebra, a matrix ring may be canonically interpreted as an endomorphism ring: <math>\\operatorname{End}_R(R^n) \\simeq \\operatorname{M}_n(R)</math>. This is a special case of the following fact: If <math>f: \\oplus_1^n U \\to \\oplus_1^n U</math> is an ''R''-linear map, then ''f'' may be written as a matrix with entries <math>f_{ij}</math> in <math>S = \\operatorname{End}_R(U)</math>, resulting in the ring isomorphism:\n:<math>\\operatorname{End}_R(\\oplus_1^n U) \\to \\operatorname{M}_n(S), \\quad f \\mapsto (f_{ij}).</math>\n\nAny ring homomorphism ''R'' → ''S'' induces {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') → M<sub>''n''</sub>(''S'')}}; in fact, any ring homomorphism between matrix rings arises in this way.<ref name=\"Cohn matrix\">{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=4.4}}</ref>\n\n[[Schur's lemma]] says that if ''U'' is a simple right ''R''-module, then <math>\\operatorname{End}_R(U)</math> is a division ring.<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch. XVII. Proposition 1.1.}}</ref> If <math>\\displaystyle U = \\bigoplus_{i = 1}^r U_i^{\\oplus m_i}</math> is a direct sum of ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>-copies of simple ''R''-modules <math>U_i</math>, then\n:<math>\\operatorname{End}_R(U) \\simeq \\bigoplus_1^r \\operatorname{M}_{m_i} (\\operatorname{End}_R(U_i))</math>.\nThe [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] states any [[semisimple ring]] (cf. below) is of this form.\n\nA ring ''R'' and the matrix ring M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') over it are [[Morita equivalent]]: the category of right modules of ''R'' is equivalent to the category of right modules over M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'').<ref name=\"Cohn matrix\" /> In particular, two-sided ideals in ''R'' correspond in one-to-one to two-sided ideals in M<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'').\n\nExamples:\n* The automorphisms of the [[projective line over a ring]] are given by [[homography|homographies]] from the 2 x 2 matrix ring.\n\n=== Limits and colimits of rings ===\nLet ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> be a sequence of rings such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> is a subring of ''R''<sub>''i''+1</sub> for all ''i''. Then the union (or [[filtered colimit]]) of ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ring <math>\\varinjlim R_i</math> defined as follows: it is the disjoint union of all ''R''<sub>''i''</sub>'s modulo the equivalence relation <math>x \\sim y</math> if and only if <math>x = y</math> in ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> for sufficiently large ''i''.\n\nExamples of colimits:\n* A polynomial ring in infinitely many variables: <math>R[t_1, t_2, \\cdots] = \\varinjlim R[t_1, t_2, \\cdots, t_m].</math>\n* The [[algebraic closure]] of [[finite field]]s of the same characteristic <math>\\overline{\\mathbf{F}}_p = \\varinjlim \\mathbf{F}_{p^m}.</math>\n* The field of [[formal Laurent series]] over a field ''k'': <math>k(\\!(t)\\!) = \\varinjlim t^{-m}k[\\![t]\\!]</math> (it is the field of fractions of the [[formal power series ring]] <math>k[\\![t]\\!]</math>.)\n* The [[function field of an algebraic variety]] over a field ''k'' is <math>\\varinjlim k[U]</math> where the limit runs over all the coordinate rings <math>k[U]</math> of nonempty open subsets ''U'' (more succinctly it is the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the structure sheaf at the [[generic point]].)\n\nAny commutative ring is the colimit of [[finitely generated ring|finitely generated subrings]].<!-- non-commutative case? -->\n\nA [[projective limit]] (or a [[filtered limit]]) of rings is defined as follows. Suppose we're given a family of rings <math>R_i</math>, ''i'' running over positive integers, say, and ring homomorphisms <math>R_j \\to R_i, j \\ge i</math> such that <math>R_i \\to R_i</math> are all the identities and <math>R_k \\to R_j \\to R_i</math> is <math>R_k \\to R_i</math> whenever <math>k \\ge j \\ge i</math>. Then <math>\\varprojlim R_i</math> is the subring of <math>\\prod R_i</math> consisting of <math>(x_n)</math> such that <math>x_j</math> maps to <math>x_i</math> under <math>R_j \\to R_i, j \\ge i</math>.\n\nFor an example of a projective limit, see {{slink||Completion}}.\n\n=== Localization ===\nThe [[localization of a ring|localization]] generalizes the construction of the [[field of fractions]] of an integral domain to an arbitrary ring and modules. Given a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''R'' and a subset ''S'' of ''R'', there exists a ring <math>R[S^{-1}]</math> together with the ring homomorphism <math>R \\to R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math> that \"inverts\" ''S''; that is, the homomorphism maps elements in ''S'' to unit elements in <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math>, and, moreover, any ring homomorphism from ''R'' that \"inverts\" ''S'' uniquely factors through <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=Proposition 1.3.1.}}</ref> The ring <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math> is called the '''localization''' of ''R'' with respect to ''S''. For example, if ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''f'' an element in ''R'', then the localization <math>R\\left[f^{-1}\\right]</math> consists of elements of the form <math>r/f^n, \\, r \\in R , \\, n \\ge 0</math> (to be precise, <math>R\\left[f^{-1}\\right] = R[t]/(tf - 1).</math>)<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenbud|2004|loc=Exercise 2.2}}</ref>\n\nThe localization is frequently applied to a commutative ring ''R'' with respect to the complement of a prime ideal (or a union of prime ideals) in ''R''. In that case <math>S = R - \\mathfrak{p}</math>, one often writes <math>R_\\mathfrak{p}</math> for <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math>. <math>R_\\mathfrak{p}</math> is then a local ring with the maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p} R_\\mathfrak{p}</math>. This is the reason for the terminology \"localization\". The field of fractions of an integral domain ''R'' is the localization of ''R'' at the prime ideal zero. If <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is a prime ideal of a commutative ring ''R'', then the field of fractions of <math>R/\\mathfrak{p}</math> is the same as the residue field of the local ring <math>R_\\mathfrak{p}</math> and is denoted by <math>k(\\mathfrak{p})</math>.<!-- In algebraic geometry, the field of fractions is the localization at the \"[[generic point]]\" -->\n\nIf ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, then the localization of ''M'' with respect to ''S'' is given by a [[change of rings]] <math>M\\left[S^{-1}\\right] = R\\left[S^{-1}\\right] \\otimes_R M</math>.<!-- intuitively, M_p corresponds to the fiber over ''p'' in ''M''. In particular, there is the canonical map <math>M \\to M\\left[S^{-1}\\right], \\, m \\mapsto m / 1</math>. Its kernel consists of elements ''m'' such that <math>sm = 0</math> for some ''s'' in ''S''. -->\n\nThe most important properties of localization are the following: when ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''S'' a multiplicatively closed subset\n* <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\mapsto \\mathfrak{p}\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math> is a bijection between the set of all prime ideals in ''R'' disjoint from ''S'' and the set of all prime ideals in <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=Proposition 6.4}}</ref>\n* <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right] = \\varinjlim R\\left[f^{-1}\\right]</math>, ''f'' running over elements in ''S'' with partial ordering given by divisibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=The end of Chapter 7}}</ref>\n* The localization is exact:\n*: <math>0 \\to M'\\left[S^{-1}\\right] \\to M\\left[S^{-1}\\right] \\to M''\\left[S^{-1}\\right] \\to 0</math> is exact over <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math> whenever <math>0 \\to M' \\to M \\to M'' \\to 0</math> is exact over ''R''.\n* Conversely, if <math>0 \\to M'_\\mathfrak{m} \\to M_\\mathfrak{m} \\to M''_\\mathfrak{m} \\to 0</math> is exact for any maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>, then <math>0 \\to M' \\to M \\to M'' \\to 0</math> is exact.\n* A remark: localization is no help in proving a global existence. One instance of this is that if two modules are isomorphic at all prime ideals, it does not follow that they are isomorphic. (One way to explain this is that the localization allows one to view a module as a sheaf over prime ideals and a sheaf is inherently a local notion.)\n\nIn category theory, a [[localization of a category]] amounts to making some morphisms isomorphisms. An element in a commutative ring ''R'' may be thought of as an endomorphism of any ''R''-module. Thus, categorically, a localization of ''R'' with respect to a subset ''S'' of ''R'' is a functor from the category of ''R''-modules to itself that sends elements of ''S'' viewed as endomorphisms to automorphisms and is universal with respect to this property. (Of course, ''R'' then maps to <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math> and ''R''-modules map to <math>R\\left[S^{-1}\\right]</math>-modules.)\n\n=== Completion ===\nLet ''R'' be a commutative ring, and let ''I'' be an ideal of ''R''.\nThe '''[[Completion (ring theory)|completion]]''' of ''R'' at ''I'' is the projective limit <math>\\hat{R} = \\varprojlim R/I^n</math>; it is a commutative ring. The canonical homomorphisms from ''R'' to the quotients <math>R/I^n</math> induce a homomorphism <math>R \\to \\hat{R}</math>. The latter homomorphism is injective if ''R'' is a noetherian integral domain and ''I'' is a proper ideal, or if ''R'' is a noetherian local ring with maximal ideal ''I'', by [[Krull's intersection theorem]].<ref>Atiyah and Macdonald, Theorem 10.17 and its corollaries.</ref> The construction is especially useful when ''I'' is a maximal ideal.\n\nThe basic example is the completion '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> of '''Z''' at the principal ideal (''p'') generated by a prime number ''p''; it is called the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]. The completion can in this case be constructed also from the [[p-adic absolute value|''p''-adic absolute value]] on '''Q'''. The ''p''-adic absolute value on '''Q''' is a map <math>x \\mapsto |x|</math> from '''Q''' to '''R''' given by <math>|n|_p=p^{-v_p(n)}</math> where <math>v_p(n)</math> denotes the exponent of ''p'' in the prime factorization of a nonzero integer ''n'' into prime numbers (we also put <math>|0|_p=0</math> and <math>|m/n|_p = |m|_p/|n|_p</math>). It defines a distance function on '''Q''' and the completion of '''Q''' as a [[metric space]] is denoted by '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>. It is again a field since the field operations extend to the completion. The subring of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> consisting of elements ''x'' with <math>|x|_p \\le 1</math> is isomorphic to '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>.\n\nSimilarly, the formal power series ring <math>R[{[t]}]</math> is the completion of <math>R[t]</math> at <math>(t)</math> (see also [[Hensel's lemma]])<!-- need to be discussed with concrete examples. Start of a para: The notion of the completion formalizes the construction of a solution by successive approximation. -->\n\nA complete ring has much simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the [[Cohen structure theorem]], which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends to look like a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the [[integral closure]] and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of [[excellent ring]].\n\n=== Rings with generators and relations ===\nThe most general way to construct a ring is by specifying generators and relations. Let ''F'' be a [[free ring]] (i.e., free algebra over the integers) with the set ''X'' of symbols; i.e., ''F'' consists of polynomials with integral coefficients in noncommuting variables that are elements of ''X''. A free ring satisfies the universal property: any function from the set ''X'' to a ring ''R'' factors through ''F'' so that <math>F \\to R</math> is the unique ring homomorphism. Just as in the group case, every ring can be represented as a quotient of a free ring.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-4ADgUgpSMC&pg=PA242 pg. 242]}}.</ref>\n\nNow, we can impose relations among symbols in ''X'' by taking a quotient. Explicitly, if ''E'' is a subset of ''F'', then the quotient ring of ''F'' by the ideal generated by ''E'' is called the ring with generators ''X'' and relations ''E''. If we used a ring, say, ''A'' as a base ring instead of '''Z''', then the resulting ring will be over ''A''. For example, if <math>E = \\{ xy - yx \\mid x, y \\in X \\}</math>, then the resulting ring will be the usual polynomial ring with coefficients in ''A'' in variables that are elements of ''X'' (It is also the same thing as the [[symmetric algebra]] over ''A'' with symbols ''X''.)\n\nIn the category-theoretic terms, the formation <math>S \\mapsto \\text{the free ring generated by the set } S</math> is the left adjoint functor of the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of rings to '''Set''' (and it is often called the free ring functor.)<!-- Note: we need to discuss a ring as a solution to a universal problem with some specific application. -->\n\nLet ''A'', ''B'' be algebras over a commutative ring ''R''. Then the tensor product of ''R''-modules <math>A \\otimes_R B</math> is a ''R''-module. We can turn it to a ring by extending linearly <math>(x \\otimes u) (y \\otimes v) = xy \\otimes uv</math>. See also: [[tensor product of algebras]], [[change of rings]].\n\n== Special kinds of rings ==\n\n=== Domains ===\nA [[zero ring|nonzero]] ring with no nonzero [[zero-divisor]]s is called a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]. A commutative domain is called an [[integral domain]]. The most important integral domains are principal ideals domains, PID for short, and fields. A principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. An important class of integral domains that contain a PID is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD), an integral domain in which every nonunit element is a product of [[prime element]]s (an element is prime if it generates a [[prime ideal]].) The fundamental question in [[algebraic number theory]] is on the extent to which the [[ring of integers|ring of (generalized) integers]] in a [[number field]], where an \"ideal\" admits prime factorization, fails to be a PID.\n\nAmong theorems concerning a PID, the most important one is the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. The theorem may be illustrated by the following application to linear algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch XIV, §2}}</ref> Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field ''k'' and <math>f: V \\to V</math> a linear map with minimal polynomial ''q''. Then, since <math>k[t]</math> is a unique factorization domain, ''q'' factors into powers of distinct irreducible polynomials (i.e., prime elements):\n:<math>q = p_1^{e_1} \\ldots p_s^{e_s}.</math>\n\nLetting <math>t \\cdot v = f(v)</math>, we make ''V'' a ''k''[''t'']-module. The structure theorem then says ''V'' is a direct sum of [[cyclic module]]s, each of which is isomorphic to the module of the form <math>k[t]/\\left(p_i^{k_j}\\right)</math>. Now, if <math>p_i(t) = t - \\lambda_i</math>, then such a cyclic module (for <math>p_i</math>) has a basis in which the restriction of ''f'' is represented by a [[Jordan matrix]]. Thus, if, say, ''k'' is algebraically closed, then all <math>p_i</math>'s are of the form <math>t - \\lambda_i</math> and the above decomposition corresponds to the [[Jordan canonical form]] of ''f''.\n\nIn algebraic geometry, UFDs arise because of smoothness. More precisely, a point in a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at the point is a [[regular local ring]]. A regular local ring is a UFD.<ref>{{harvnb|Weibel|loc=Ch 1, Theorem 3.8}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a chain of [[subclass (set theory)|class inclusions]] that describes the relationship between rings, domains and fields:\n\n: '''[[Commutative ring]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integral domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integrally closed domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[unique factorization domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[principal ideal domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[Euclidean domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[field (mathematics)|fields]]'''\n\n=== Division ring ===\nA [[division ring]] is a ring such that every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division ring is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A prominent example of a division ring that is not a field is the ring of [[quaternion]]s. Any centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In particular, the center of a division ring is a field. It turned out that every ''finite'' domain (in particular finite division ring) is a field; in particular commutative (the [[Wedderburn's little theorem]]).\n\nEvery module over a division ring is a free module (has a basis); consequently, much of linear algebra can be carried out over a division ring instead of a field.\n\nThe study of conjugacy classes figures prominently in the classical theory of division rings. Cartan famously asked the following question: given a division ring ''D'' and a proper sub-division-ring ''S'' that is not contained in the center, does each inner automorphism of ''D'' restrict to an automorphism of ''S''? The answer is negative: this is the [[Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem]].<!--\nneed more context. To give a concrete example, we consider a division ring ''D'' whose center ''k'' is the field <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p</math> of ''p''-adic rational numbers (or more generally a nonarchimedean local field).<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §4}}</ref> The valuation of ''k'' uniquely extends to any subfield of ''D''. Since ''D'' is a union of subfields, we thus obtain the valuation ''v'' of ''D''. (This has to be verified; it is not a priori obvious that ''v'' is indeed a valuation). Define\n:<math>O_D = \\{ x \\in D | v(x) \\ge 0 \\}, \\quad \\mathfrak{P} = \\{ x \\in D | v(x) > 0 \\}</math>.\nThen <math>O_D</math> is a subring of ''D'' with the unique maximal ideal that is <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math>. It is called the [[ring of integers]] of ''D''.\n-->\n\nA [[cyclic algebra]], introduced by [[L. E. Dickson]], is a generalization of a [[quaternion algebra]].\n\n=== Semisimple rings ===\nA ring is called a [[semisimple ring]] if it is [[semisimple module|semisimple as a left module]] (or right module) over itself; i.e., a direct sum of simple modules. A ring is called a [[semiprimitive ring]] if its [[Jacobson radical]] is zero. (The Jacobson radical is the intersection of all maximal left ideals.) A ring is semisimple if and only if it is [[artinian ring|artinian]] and is semiprimitive.\n\nAn algebra over a field ''k'' is artinian if and only if it has finite dimension. Thus, a semisimple algebra over a field is necessarily finite-dimensional, while a simple algebra may have infinite dimension; e.g., the [[ring of differential operators]].\n\nAny module over a semisimple ring is semisimple. (Proof: any free module over a semisimple ring is clearly semisimple and any module is a quotient of a free module.)\n\nExamples of semisimple rings:\n* A matrix ring over a division ring is semisimple (actually simple).\n* The group ring <math>k[G]</math> of a finite group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is semisimple if the characteristic of ''k'' does not divide the order of ''G''. ([[Maschke's theorem]])\n* The [[Weyl algebra]] (over a field) is a simple ring; it is not semisimple since it has infinite dimension and thus not artinian.\n* [[Clifford algebra]]s are semisimple.\n\nSemisimplicity is closely related to separability. An [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' over a field ''k'' is said to be [[separable algebra|separable]] if the base extension <math>A \\otimes_k F</math> is semisimple for any [[field extension]] <math>F/k</math>. If ''A'' happens to be a field, then this is equivalent to the usual definition in field theory (cf. [[separable extension]].)\n\n=== Central simple algebra and Brauer group ===\n{{main|Central simple algebra}}\n\nFor a field ''k'', a ''k''-algebra is central if its center is ''k'' and is simple if it is a [[simple ring]]. Since the center of a simple ''k''-algebra is a field, any simple ''k''-algebra is a central simple algebra over its center. In this section, a central simple algebra is assumed to have finite dimension. Also, we mostly fix the base field; thus, an algebra refers to a ''k''-algebra. The matrix ring of size ''n'' over a ring ''R'' will be denoted by <math>R_n</math>.\n\nThe [[Skolem–Noether theorem]] states any automorphism of a central simple algebra is inner.\n\nTwo central simple algebras ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be ''similar'' if there are integers ''n'' and ''m'' such that <math>A \\otimes_k k_n \\approx B \\otimes_k k_m</math>.<ref name=\"harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §2\">{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §2}}</ref> Since <math>k_n \\otimes_k k_m \\simeq k_{nm}</math>, the similarity is an equivalence relation. The similarity classes <math>[A]</math> with the multiplication <math>[A][B] = \\left[A \\otimes_k B\\right]</math> form an abelian group called the [[Brauer group]] of ''k'' and is denoted by <math>\\operatorname{Br}(k)</math>. By the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]], a central simple algebra is the matrix ring of a division ring; thus, each similarity class is represented by a unique division ring.\n\nFor example, <math>\\operatorname{Br}(k)</math> is trivial if ''k'' is a finite field or an algebraically closed field (more generally [[quasi-algebraically closed field]]; cf. [[Tsen's theorem]]). <math>\\operatorname{Br}(\\mathbb{R})</math> has order 2 (a special case of the [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|theorem of Frobenius]]). Finally, if ''k'' is a nonarchimedean [[local field]] (e.g., <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p</math>), then <math>\\operatorname{Br}(k) = \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}</math> through the [[Hasse invariant of an algebra|invariant map]].\n\nNow, if ''F'' is a field extension of ''k'', then the base extension <math>- \\otimes_k F</math> induces <math>\\operatorname{Br}(k) \\to \\operatorname{Br}(F)</math>. Its kernel is denoted by <math>\\operatorname{Br}(F/k)</math>. It consists of <math>[A]</math> such that <math>A \\otimes_k F</math> is a matrix ring over ''F'' (i.e., ''A'' is split by ''F''.) If the extension is finite and Galois, then <math>\\operatorname{Br}(F/k)</math> is canonically isomorphic to <math>H^2\\left(\\operatorname{Gal}(F/k), k^*\\right)</math>.<ref>Serre, J-P ., Applications algébriques de la cohomologie des groupes, I, II, Séminaire Henri Cartan, 1950/51 [http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1950-1951__3_]</ref>\n\n[[Azumaya algebra]]s generalize the notion of central simple algebras to a commutative local ring.\n\n=== Valuation ring ===\n{{main|valuation ring}}\n\nIf ''K'' is a field, a [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] ''v'' is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group ''K''<sup>*</sup> to a totally ordered abelian group ''G'' such that, for any ''f'', ''g'' in ''K'' with ''f'' + ''g'' nonzero, ''v''(''f'' + ''g'') ≥ min{''v''(''f''), ''v''(''g'')}. The [[valuation ring]] of ''v'' is the subring of ''K'' consisting of zero and all nonzero ''f'' such that ''v''(''f'') ≥ 0.\n\nExamples: {{unordered list\n| The field of [[formal Laurent series]] <math>k(\\!(t)\\!)</math> over a field ''k'' comes with the valuation ''v'' such that ''v''(''f'') is the least degree of a nonzero term in ''f''; the valuation ring of ''v'' is the [[formal power series ring]] <math>k[\\![t]\\!]</math>.\n| More generally, given a field ''k'' and a totally ordered abelian group ''G'', let <math>k(\\!(G)\\!)</math> be the set of all functions from ''G'' to ''k'' whose supports (the sets of points at which the functions are nonzero) are [[well ordered]]. It is a field with the multiplication given by [[convolution]]:\n: <math>(f*g)(t) = \\sum_{s \\in G} f(s)g(t - s)</math>.\n\nIt also comes with the valuation ''v'' such that ''v''(''f'') is the least element in the support of ''f''. The subring consisting of elements with finite support is called the [[group ring]] of ''G'' (which makes sense even if ''G'' is not commutative). If ''G'' is the ring of integers, then we recover the previous example (by identifying ''f'' with the series whose ''n''-th coefficient is ''f''(''n'').)\n}}\n\nSee also: [[Novikov ring]] and [[uniserial ring]].\n\n== Rings with extra structure ==\n\nA ring may be viewed as an [[abelian group]] (by using the addition operation), with extra structure: namely, ring multiplication. In the same way, there are other mathematical objects which may be considered as rings with extra structure. For example:\n* An [[associative algebra]] is a ring that is also a [[vector space]] over a field ''K'' such that the scalar multiplication distributes over the ring multiplication. For instance, the set of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over the real field '''R''' has dimension ''n''<sup>2</sup> as a real vector space.\n* A ring ''R'' is a [[topological ring]] if its set of elements ''R'' is given a [[topological space|topology]] which makes the addition map ( <math>+ : R\\times R \\to R\\,</math>) and the multiplication map ( <math>\\cdot : R\\times R \\to R\\,</math>) to be both [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] as maps between topological spaces (where ''X'' × ''X'' inherits the [[product topology]] or any other product in the category). For example, ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over the real numbers could be given either the [[Euclidean topology]], or the [[Zariski topology]], and in either case one would obtain a topological ring.\n* A [[λ-ring]] is a commutative ring ''R'' together with operations λ<sup>''n''</sup>: ''R'' → ''R'' that are like ''n''-th [[exterior power]]s:\n::<math>\\lambda^n(x + y) = \\sum_0^n \\lambda^i(x) \\lambda^{n-i}(y)</math>.\n:For example, '''Z''' is a λ-ring with <math>\\lambda^n(x) = \\binom{x}{n}</math>, the [[binomial coefficient]]s. The notion plays a central rule in the algebraic approach to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].\n* A [[totally ordered ring]] is a ring with a [[total ordering]] that is compatible with ring operations.<!-- Z is characterized as a certain unique ordered ring. Can’t remember the precise statement.-->\n\n== Some examples of the ubiquity of rings ==\n\nMany different kinds of [[mathematical object]]s can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of some [[functor|associated ring]].\n\n=== Cohomology ring of a topological space ===\nTo any [[topological space]] ''X'' one can associate its integral [[cohomology ring]]\n:<math>H^*(X,\\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\infty} H^i(X,\\mathbb{Z}),</math>\na [[graded ring]]. There are also [[homology group]]s <math>H_i(X,\\mathbb{Z})</math> of a space, and indeed these were defined first, as a useful tool for distinguishing between certain pairs of topological spaces, like the [[sphere]]s and [[torus|tori]], for which the methods of [[point-set topology]] are not well-suited. [[Cohomology group]]s were later defined in terms of homology groups in a way which is roughly analogous to the dual of a [[vector space]]. To know each individual integral homology group is essentially the same as knowing each individual integral cohomology group, because of the [[universal coefficient theorem]]. However, the advantage of the cohomology groups is that there is a [[cup product|natural product]], which is analogous to the observation that one can multiply pointwise a ''k''-[[multilinear form]] and an ''l''-multilinear form to get a (''k'' + ''l'')-multilinear form.\n\nThe ring structure in cohomology provides the foundation for [[characteristic class]]es of [[fiber bundle]]s, intersection theory on manifolds and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], [[Schubert calculus]] and much more.\n\n=== Burnside ring of a group ===\nTo any [[group (mathematics)|group]] is associated its [[Burnside ring]] which uses a ring to describe the various ways the group can [[Group action (mathematics)|act]] on a finite set. The Burnside ring's additive group is the [[free abelian group]] whose basis are the transitive actions of the group and whose addition is the disjoint union of the action. Expressing an action in terms of the basis is decomposing an action into its transitive constituents. The multiplication is easily expressed in terms of the [[representation ring]]: the multiplication in the Burnside ring is formed by writing the tensor product of two permutation modules as a permutation module. The ring structure allows a formal way of subtracting one action from another. Since the Burnside ring is contained as a finite index subring of the representation ring, one can pass easily from one to the other by extending the coefficients from integers to the rational numbers.\n\n=== Representation ring of a group ring ===\nTo any [[group ring]] or [[Hopf algebra]] is associated its [[representation ring]] or \"Green ring\". The representation ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the indecomposable modules and whose addition corresponds to the direct sum. Expressing a module in terms of the basis is finding an indecomposable decomposition of the module. The multiplication is the tensor product. When the algebra is semisimple, the representation ring is just the character ring from [[character theory]], which is more or less the [[Grothendieck group]] given a ring structure.\n\n=== Function field of an irreducible algebraic variety ===\nTo any irreducible [[algebraic variety]] is associated its [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]]. The points of an algebraic variety correspond to [[valuation ring]]s contained in the function field and containing the [[coordinate ring]]. The study of [[algebraic geometry]] makes heavy use of [[commutative algebra]] to study geometric concepts in terms of ring-theoretic properties. [[Birational geometry]] studies maps between the subrings of the function field.\n\n=== Face ring of a simplicial complex ===\nEvery [[simplicial complex]] has an associated face ring, also called its [[Stanley–Reisner ring]]. This ring reflects many of the combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex, so it is of particular interest in [[algebraic combinatorics]]. In particular, the algebraic geometry of the Stanley–Reisner ring was used to characterize the numbers of faces in each dimension of [[simplicial polytope]]s.\n\n== Category theoretical description ==\n{{main|Category of rings}}\n\nEvery ring can be thought of as a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in '''Ab''', the [[category of abelian groups]] (thought of as a [[monoidal category]] under the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product of <math>{\\mathbb Z}</math>-modules]]). The monoid action of a ring ''R'' on an abelian group is simply an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]]. Essentially, an ''R''-module is a generalization of the notion of a [[vector space]] – where rather than a vector space over a field, one has a \"vector space over a ring\".\n\nLet (''A'', +) be an abelian group and let End(''A'') be its [[endomorphism ring]] (see above). Note that, essentially, End(''A'') is the set of all morphisms of ''A'', where if ''f'' is in End(''A''), and ''g'' is in End(''A''), the following rules may be used to compute ''f'' + ''g'' and ''f'' '''·''' ''g'':\n\n* (''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')\n* (''f'' '''·''' ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))\n\nwhere + as in ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'') is addition in ''A'', and function composition is denoted from right to left. Therefore, [[functor|associated]] to any abelian group, is a ring. Conversely, given any ring, (''R'', +, '''·''' ), (''R'', +) is an abelian group. Furthermore, for every ''r'' in ''R'', right (or left) multiplication by ''r'' gives rise to a morphism of (''R'', +), by right (or left) distributivity. Let ''A'' = (''R'', +). Consider those [[endomorphism]]s of ''A'', that \"factor through\" right (or left) multiplication of ''R''. In other words, let End<sub>R</sub>(''A'') be the set of all morphisms ''m'' of ''A'', having the property that ''m''(''r'' '''·''' ''x'') = ''r'' '''·''' ''m''(''x''). It was seen that every ''r'' in ''R'' gives rise to a morphism of ''A'': right multiplication by ''r''. It is in fact true that this association of any element of ''R'', to a morphism of ''A'', as a function from ''R'' to End<sub>R</sub>(''A''), is an isomorphism of rings. In this sense, therefore, any ring can be viewed as the endomorphism ring of some abelian ''X''-group (by ''X''-group, it is meant a group with ''X'' being its [[Group with operators|set of operators]]).<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2.</ref> In essence, the most general form of a ring, is the endomorphism group of some abelian ''X''-group.\n\nAny ring can be seen as a [[preadditive category]] with a single object. It is therefore natural to consider arbitrary preadditive categories to be generalizations of rings. And indeed, many definitions and theorems originally given for rings can be translated to this more general context. [[Additive functor]]s between preadditive categories generalize the concept of ring homomorphism, and ideals in additive categories can be defined as sets of [[morphism]]s closed under addition and under composition with arbitrary morphisms.\n\n== Generalization ==\n\nAlgebraists have defined structures more general than rings by weakening or dropping some of ring axioms.\n\n=== Rng ===\nA [[rng (algebra)|rng]] is the same as a ring, except that the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]] is not assumed.<ref>Jacobson 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Nonassociative ring ===\nA [[nonassociative ring]] is an algebraic structure that satisfies all of the ring axioms except the [[associative property]] and the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]]. A notable example is a [[Lie algebra]]. There exists some structure theory<!-- developed by Jacobson? --> for such algebras that generalizes the analogous results for Lie algebras and associative algebras.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n=== Semiring ===\nA [[semiring]] is obtained by weakening the assumption that (''R'',+) is an abelian group to the assumption that (''R'',+) is a commutative monoid, and adding the axiom that 0 · ''a'' = ''a'' · 0 = 0 for all ''a'' in ''R'' (since it no longer follows from the other axioms).\n\nExamples:\n* the non-negative integers <math>\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}</math> with ordinary addition and multiplication;\n* the [[tropical semiring]].\n\n== Other ring-like objects ==\n\n=== Ring object in a category ===\nLet ''C'' be a category with finite products. Let pt denote a [[terminal object]] of ''C'' (an empty product). A '''ring object''' in ''C'' is an object ''R'' equipped with morphisms <math>R \\times R \\stackrel{a}\\to R</math> (addition), <math>R \\times R \\stackrel{m}\\to R</math> (multiplication), <math>\\operatorname{pt} \\stackrel{0}\\to R</math> (additive identity), <math>R \\stackrel{i}\\to R</math> (additive inverse), and <math>\\operatorname{pt} \\stackrel{1}\\to R</math> (multiplicative identity) satisfying the usual ring axioms. Equivalently, a ring object is an object ''R'' equipped with a factorization of its functor of points <math>h_R = \\operatorname{Hom}(-,R) : C^{\\operatorname{op}} \\to \\mathbf{Sets}</math> through the category of rings: <math>C^{\\operatorname{op}} \\to \\mathbf{Rings} \\stackrel{\\textrm{forgetful}}\\longrightarrow \\mathbf{Sets}</math>.\n\n=== Ring scheme ===\nIn algebraic geometry, a '''ring scheme''' over a base [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] {{math|''S''}} is a ring object in the category of {{math|''S''}}-schemes. One example is the ring scheme {{math|W<sub>''n''</sub>}} over {{math|Spec '''Z'''}}, which for any commutative ring {{math|''A''}} returns the ring {{math|W<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} of {{math|''p''}}-isotypic Witt vectors of length {{math|''n''}} over {{math|''A''}}.<ref>Serre, p.&nbsp;44.</ref>\n\n=== Ring spectrum ===\nIn [[algebraic topology]], a [[ring spectrum]] is a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] ''X'' together with a multiplication <math>\\mu \\colon X \\wedge X \\to X</math> and a unit map <math>S \\to X</math> from the [[sphere spectrum]] ''S'', such that the ring axiom diagrams commute up to homotopy. In practice, it is common to define a ring spectrum as a [[monoid object]] in a good category of spectra such as the category of [[symmetric spectrum|symmetric spectra]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikibooks|Abstract Algebra/Rings}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Algebra over a commutative ring]]\n* [[Algebraic structure]]\n* [[Categorical ring]]\n* [[Category of rings]]\n* [[Glossary of ring theory]]\n* [[Nonassociative ring]]\n* [[Ring theory]]\n* [[Ring of sets]]\n* [[Semiring]]\n* [[Spectrum of a ring]]\n* [[Simplicial commutative ring]]\n{{Div col end}}\nSpecial types of rings:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Boolean ring]]\n* [[Commutative ring]]\n* [[Dedekind ring]]\n* [[Differential ring]]\n* [[Division ring]] (skew field)\n* [[Exponential field|Exponential ring]]\n* [[Field (mathematics)|Field]]\n* [[Finite ring]]\n* [[Integral domain]]\n* [[Lie ring]]\n* [[Local ring]]\n* [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] and [[artinian ring]]s\n* [[Ordered ring]]\n* [[Poisson ring]]\n* [[Principal ideal domain]] (PID)\n* [[Reduced ring]]\n* [[Regular ring]]\n* [[Ring of periods]]\n* [[SBI ring]]\n* [[Unique factorization domain]] (UFD)\n* [[Valuation ring]] and [[discrete valuation ring]]\n* [[Zero ring]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{cnote|a|Some authors only require that a ring be a [[semigroup]] under multiplication; that is, do not require that there be a multiplicative identity (1).

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[abstract algebra]], a '''rng''' (or '''[[pseudo-ring]]''' or '''non-unital ring''') is an [[algebraic structure]] satisfying the same properties as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], without assuming the existence of a multiplicative identity. The term \"rng\" (pronounced ''rung'') is meant to suggest that it is a \"ring\" without \"i\", i.e. without the requirement for an \"identity element\".\n\nThere is no consensus in the community as to whether the existence of a multiplicative identity must be one of the ring axioms (see the [[Ring (mathematics)#History|history section]] of the article on [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]). The term \"rng\" was coined to alleviate this ambiguity when people want to refer explicitly to a ring without the axiom of multiplicative identity.\n\nA number of algebras of functions considered in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] are not unital, for instance the algebra of functions decreasing to zero at infinity, especially those with [[compact support]] on some (non-[[compact space|compact]]) space.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nFormally, a '''rng''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' with two [[binary operations]] {{nowrap|(+, ·)}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'' such that\n* (''R'', +) is an [[abelian group]],\n* (''R'', ·) is a [[semigroup]],\n* Multiplication [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition.\n\nRng [[homomorphism]]s are defined in the same way as [[ring homomorphism]]s except that the requirement {{nowrap|1=''f''(1) = 1}} is dropped. That is, a '''rng homomorphism''' is a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} from one rng to another such that\n* ''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'')\n* ''f''(''x'' · ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') · ''f''(''y'')\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nAll rings are rngs. A simple example of a rng that is not a ring is given by the [[even number|even integers]] with the ordinary addition and multiplication of integers. Another example is given by the set of all 3-by-3 real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] whose bottom row is zero. Both of these examples are instances of the general fact that every (one- or two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] is a rng.\n\nRngs often appear naturally in [[functional analysis]] when [[linear operator]]s on infinite-[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimensional]] [[vector space]]s are considered.  Take for instance any infinite-dimensional vector space ''V'' and consider the set of all linear operators {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} with finite [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] (i.e. {{nowrap|dim ''f''(''V'') < ∞}}). Together with addition and [[functional composition|composition]] of operators, this is a rng, but not a ring. Another example is the rng of all real [[sequence]]s that [[limit of a sequence|converge to]] 0, with component-wise operations.\n\nAlso, many [[test function]] spaces occurring in the [[theory of distributions]] consist of functions\ndecreasing to zero at infinity, like e.g. [[Schwartz space]]. Thus, the function everywhere equal to one, which would be the only possible identity element for pointwise multiplication, cannot exist in such spaces, which therefore are rngs (for pointwise addition and multiplication). In particular, the real-valued [[continuous function]]s with [[compact space|compact]] [[support (mathematics)|support]] defined on some [[topological space]], together with pointwise addition and multiplication, form a rng; this is not a ring unless the underlying space is [[compact space|compact]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\nIdeals and [[quotient ring]]s can be defined for rngs in the same manner as for rings. The ideal theory of rngs is complicated by the fact that a nonzero rng, unlike a nonzero ring, need not contain any [[maximal ideal]]s. Some theorems of [[ring theory]] are false for rngs.\n\nA rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} maps any [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]] to an idempotent element; this applies in particular to 1<sub>''R''</sub> if it exists.\n\nIf ''R'' and ''S'' are rings, a rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' → ''S''}} whose image contains a non-zero-divisor maps 1<sub>''R''</sub> to 1<sub>''S''</sub>.\n\n== Adjoining an identity element ==\n\nEvery rng ''R'' can be turned into a ring ''R''^ by adjoining an identity element.  The most general way in which to do this is to formally add an identity element 1 and let ''R''^ consist of integral linear combinations of 1 and elements of ''R''.  That is, elements of ''R''^ are of the form\n:''n'' &middot; 1 + ''r''\nwhere ''n'' is an [[integer]] and {{nowrap|''r'' ∈ ''R''}}.  Multiplication is defined by linearity:\n:(''n''<sub>1</sub> + ''r''<sub>1</sub>) &middot; (''n''<sub>2</sub> + ''r''<sub>2</sub>) = ''n''<sub>1</sub>''n''<sub>2</sub> + ''n''<sub>1</sub>''r''<sub>2</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub>''r''<sub>1</sub> + ''r''<sub>1</sub>''r''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nMore formally, we can take ''R''^ to be the [[cartesian product]] {{nowrap|'''Z''' × ''R''}} and define addition and multiplication by\n:(''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>) + (''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) = (''n''<sub>1</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub> + ''r''<sub>2</sub>),\n:(''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>) &middot; (''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) = (''n''<sub>1</sub>''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''n''<sub>1</sub>''r''<sub>2</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub>''r''<sub>1</sub> + ''r''<sub>1</sub>''r''<sub>2</sub>).\nThe multiplicative identity of ''R''^ is then {{nowrap|(1, 0)}}.  There is a natural rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''j'' : ''R'' → ''R''^}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''j''(''r'') = (0, ''r'')}}.  This map has the following [[universal property]]:\n:Given any ring ''S'' and any rng homomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}}, there exists a unique ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''g'' : ''R''^ → ''S''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''gj''}}.\nThe map ''g'' can be defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''n'', ''r'') = ''n'' · 1<sub>''S''</sub> + ''f''(''r'')}}.  In a sense then, ''R''^ is \"the most general\" ring containing ''R''.\n\nThere is a natural surjective ring homomorphism {{nowrap|''R''^ → '''Z'''}} which sends {{nowrap|(''n'', ''r'')}} to ''n''.  The [[kernel (ring theory)|kernel]] of this homomorphism is the image of ''R'' in ''R''^.  Since ''j'' is injective, we see that ''R'' is embedded as a (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ''R''^ with the [[quotient ring]] ''R''^/''R'' isomorphic to '''Z'''.  It follows that\n:''Every rng is an ideal in some ring, and every ideal of a ring is a rng.''\n\nNote that ''j'' is never surjective.  So even when ''R'' already has an identity element the ring ''R''^ will be a larger one with a different identity.\n\nThe process of adjoining an identity element to a rng can be formulated in the language of [[category theory]].  If we denote the [[category of all rings]] and ring homomorphisms by '''Ring''' and the category of all rngs and rng homomorphisms by '''Rng''', then '''Ring''' is a (nonfull) [[subcategory]] of '''Rng'''.  The construction of ''R''^ given above yields a [[left adjoint]] to the  [[inclusion functor]] {{nowrap|''I'' : '''Ring''' → '''Rng'''}}.  This means that '''Ring''' is a [[reflective subcategory]] of '''Rng''' with reflector {{nowrap|''j'' : ''R'' → ''R''^}}.\n\n== Properties weaker than having an identity ==\n\nThere are several properties that have been considered in the literature that are weaker than having an identity element, but not so general. \nFor example:\n\n* Rings with enough idempotents: A rng ''R'' is said to be a ring with enough idempotents when there exists a subset ''E'' of ''R'' given by orthogonal (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''ef'' = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''e'' ≠ ''f''}} in ''E'') idempotents (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>2</sup> = ''e''}} for all ''e'' in ''E'') such that {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {{big|⊕}}<sub>''e''∈''E''</sub> ''eR'' = {{big|⊕}}<sub>''e''∈''E''</sub> ''Re''}}.\n* Rings with local units: A rng ''R'' is said to be a ring with local units in case for every finite set ''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''r<sub>t</sub>'' in ''R'' we can find ''e'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>2</sup> = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''er<sub>i</sub>'' = ''r<sub>i</sub>'' = ''r<sub>i</sub>e''}} for every ''i''.\n* ''s''-unital rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be ''s''-unital in case for every finite set ''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''r<sub>t</sub>'' in ''R'' we can find ''s'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''sr<sub>i</sub>'' = ''r<sub>i</sub>'' = ''r<sub>i</sub>s''}} for every ''i''.\n* Firm rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be firm if the canonical homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' ⊗<sub>''R''</sub> ''R'' → ''R''}} given by {{nowrap|''r'' ⊗ ''s'' ↦ ''rs''}} is an isomorphism.\n* Idempotent rings: A rng ''R'' is said to be idempotent (or an irng) in case {{nowrap|1=''R''<sup>2</sup> = ''R''}}, that is, for every element ''r'' of ''R'' we can find elements ''r<sub>i</sub>'' and ''s<sub>i</sub>'' in ''R'' such that <math>r = \\Sigma_i r_i s_i</math>.\n\nIt is not hard to check that these properties are weaker than having an identity element and weaker than the previous one.\n\n* Rings are rings with enough idempotents, using {{nowrap|1=''E'' = {1}.}} A ring with enough idempotents that has no identity is for example the ring of infinite matrices over a field with just a finite number of nonzero entries. The matrices that have just 1 over one element in the main diagonal and 0 otherwise are the orthogonal idempotents.\n* Rings with enough idempotents are rings with local units just taking finite sums of the orthogonal idempotents to satisfy the definition.\n* Rings with local units are in particular ''s''-unital; ''s''-unital rings are firm and firm rings are idempotent.\n\n== Rng of square zero ==\n\nA '''rng of square zero''' is a rng ''R'' such that {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R''.<ref>See Bourbaki, p.&nbsp;102, where it is called a pseudo-ring of square zero.  Some other authors use the term \"zero ring\" to refer to any rng of square zero; see e.g. {{harvtxt|Szele|1949}} and {{harvtxt|Kreinovich|1995}}.</ref>\nAny [[abelian group]] can be made a rng of square zero by defining the multiplication so that {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} for all ''x'' and ''y'';<ref>Bourbaki, p.&nbsp;102.</ref> thus every abelian group is the additive group of some rng.\nThe only rng of square zero with a multiplicative identity is the [[zero ring]] {0}.<ref>Bourbaki, p.&nbsp;102.</ref>\n\nAny additive [[subgroup]] of a rng of square zero is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].  Thus a rng of square zero is [[simple ring|simple]] if and only if its additive group is a simple abelian group, i.e., a [[cyclic group]] of prime order.<ref>Zariski and Samuel, p.&nbsp;133.</ref>\n\n== Unital homomorphism ==\n\nGiven two unital algebras ''A'' and ''B'', an algebra [[homomorphism]]\n\n:''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''\n\nis '''unital''' if it maps the identity element of ''A'' to the identity element of ''B''.\n\nIf the associative algebra ''A'' over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is ''not'' unital, one can adjoin an identity element as follows: take {{nowrap|''A'' × ''K''}} as underlying ''K''-[[vector space]] and define multiplication ∗ by\n\n:(''x'',''r'') ∗ (''y'',''s'') = (''xy'' + ''sx'' + ''ry'', ''rs'')\n\nfor ''x'',''y'' in ''A'' and ''r'',''s'' in ''K''. Then ∗ is an associative operation with identity element (0,1). The old algebra ''A'' is contained in the new one, and in fact {{nowrap|1=''A'' × ''K''}} is the \"most general\" unital algebra containing ''A'', in the sense of [[universal construction]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Semiring]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{Cite book\n | last1=Bourbaki\n | first1=N.\n | author1-link=Nicolas Bourbaki\n | title=Algebra I, Chapters 1–3\n | publisher=Springer\n | year=1998\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last1=Dummit\n | first1=David S.\n | last2=Foote\n | first2=Richard M.\n | title=Abstract Algebra\n | edition=3rd\n | publisher=Wiley\n | year=2003\n | isbn=978-0-471-43334-7\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Kreinovich | first = V.\n | doi = 10.1007/BF01190935\n | issue = 2\n | journal = Algebra Universalis\n | mr = 1318988\n | pages = 237–242\n | title = If a polynomial identity guarantees that every partial order on a ring can be extended, then this identity is true only for a zero-ring\n | volume = 33\n | year = 1995\n | ref = harv}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last=Herstein\n | first=I.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]],  a '''semifield''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with two [[binary operation]]s, addition and multiplication, which is similar to a [[field (mathematics)|field]], but with some axioms relaxed. \n\n==Overview==\nThe term semifield has two conflicting meanings, both of which include fields as a special case.\n\n* In [[projective geometry]] and [[finite geometry]] ([[Mathematics Subject Classification|MSC]] 51A, 51E, 12K10), a '''semifield''' is a  [[Division_algebra#Not_necessarily_associative_division_algebras|nonassociative division ring]] with multiplicative identity element.<ref name=\"Knuth\" />  More precisely, it is a [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative ring]] whose nonzero elements form a [[loop (mathematics)|loop]] under multiplication. In other words, a semifield is a set ''S'' with two operations + (addition) and · (multiplication), such that \n** (''S'',+) is an [[abelian group]], \n** multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] on both the left and right, \n** there exists a multiplicative [[identity element]], and \n** [[division (mathematics)|division]] is always possible: for every ''a'' and every nonzero ''b'' in ''S'', there exist unique ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'' for which ''b''·''x'' = ''a'' and ''y''·''b'' = ''a''. \n: Note in particular that the multiplication is not assumed to be [[commutative property|commutative]] or [[associative property|associative]]. A semifield that is associative is a [[division ring]], and one that is both associative and commutative is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A semifield by this definition is a special case of a [[quasifield]]. If ''S'' is finite, the last axiom in the definition above can be replaced with the assumption that there are no [[zero divisor]]s, so that ''a''&middot;''b'' = 0 implies that ''a'' = 0 or ''b'' = 0.<ref name=\"Landquist\" /> Note that due to the lack of associativity, the last axiom is ''not'' equivalent to the assumption that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, as is usually found in definitions of fields and division rings.\n\n* In [[ring theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[functional analysis]], and [[theoretical computer science]] ([[Mathematics Subject Classification|MSC]] 16Y60), a '''semifield''' is a [[semiring]] (''S'',+,·) in which all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse.<ref name=\"Golan\" /><ref name=\"HW\" /> These objects are also called '''proper semifields'''. A variation of this definition arises if ''S'' contains an absorbing zero that is different from the multiplicative unit ''e'', it is required that the non-zero elements be invertible, and ''a''·0 = 0·''a'' = 0. Since multiplication is [[associative]], the (non-zero) elements of a semifield form a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. However, the pair (''S'',+) is only a [[semigroup]], i.e. additive inverse need not exist, or, colloquially, 'there is no subtraction'. Sometimes, it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative.\n\n== Primitivity of semifields==\nA semifield D is called right (resp. left) primitive if it has an element w such that the set of nonzero elements of D* is equal to the set of all right (resp. left) principal powers of w.\n\n== Examples ==\nWe only give examples of semifields in the second sense, i.e. additive semigroups with distributive multiplication. Moreover, addition is commutative and multiplication is associative in our examples.\n\n* [[Positive real numbers]] with the usual addition and multiplication form a commutative semifield.\n*:This can be extended by an absorbing 0, forming the [[probability semiring]], which is isomorphic to the [[log semiring]].\n* [[Rational function]]s of the form ''f'' /''g'', where ''f'' and ''g'' are [[polynomial]]s in one variable with positive coefficients, form a commutative semifield.\n*:This can be extended to include 0.\n* The [[real numbers]] '''R''' can be viewed a semifield where the sum of two elements is defined to be their maximum and the product to be their ordinary sum; this semifield is more compactly denoted ('''R''', max, +).  Similarly ('''R''', min, +) is a semifield. These are called the [[tropical semiring]].\n*:This can be extended by −∞ (an absorbing 0); this is the limit ([[tropicalization]]) of the [[log semiring]] as the base goes to infinity.\n* Generalizing the previous example, if (''A'',·,≤) is a [[lattice-ordered group]] then (''A'',+,·) is an additively [[idempotent]] semifield with the semifield sum defined to be the [[supremum]] of two elements. Conversely, any additively idempotent semifield (''A'',+,·) defines a lattice-ordered group (''A'',·,≤), where ''a''≤''b'' if and only if ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b''.\n* The boolean semifield '''B''' = {0, 1} with addition defined by [[logical or]], and multiplication defined by [[logical and]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Planar ternary ring]] (first sense)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|\nrefs=\n<ref name=\"Landquist\">Landquist, E.J., \"On Nonassociative Division Rings and Projective Planes\", Copyright 2000.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Knuth\">[[Donald Knuth]], ''Finite semifields and projective planes''.

      "text": "[[File:Semigroup associative image.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.75|The associative property of string concatenation.]]\n\nIn mathematics, a '''semigroup''' is an [[algebraic structure]] consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] together with an [[associative]] [[binary operation]].\n\nThe binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted [[multiplication|multiplicatively]]: ''x''·''y'', or simply ''xy'', denotes the result of applying the semigroup operation to the [[ordered pair]] {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}. Associativity is formally expressed as that {{nowrap|1=(''x''·''y'')·''z'' = ''x''·(''y''·''z'')}} for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in the semigroup.\n\nSemigroups may be considered a special case of [[magma (algebra)|magmas]], where the operation is associative, or as a generalization of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], without requiring the existence of an identity element or inverses.<ref group=\"note\"> The closure axiom is implied by the definition of a binary operation on a set. Some authors thus omit it and specify three axioms for a group and only axiom (associativity) for a semigroup.</ref> As in the case of groups or magmas, the semigroup operation need not be [[commutativity|commutative]], so ''x''·''y'' is not necessarily equal to ''y''·''x''; a well-known example of an operation that is associative but non-commutative is [[matrix multiplication]]. If the semigroup operation is commutative, then the semigroup is called a ''commutative semigroup'' or (less often than in the [[abelian group|analogous case of groups]]) it may be called an ''abelian semigroup''.\n\nA [[monoid]] is an algebraic structure intermediate between groups and semigroups, and is a semigroup having an [[identity element]], thus obeying all but one of the axioms of a group; existence of inverses is not required of a monoid. A natural example is [[string (computer science)|strings]] with [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the empty string as the identity element. Restricting to non-empty [[string (computer science)|strings]] gives an example of a semigroup that is not a monoid. Positive [[integer]]s with addition form a commutative semigroup that is not a monoid, whereas the non-negative [[integer]]s do form a monoid. A semigroup without an identity element can be easily turned into a monoid by just adding an identity element. Consequently, monoids are studied in the theory of semigroups rather than in group theory. Semigroups should not be confused with [[quasigroup]]s, which are a generalization of groups in a different direction; the operation in a quasigroup need not be associative but quasigroups [[Group (mathematics)#Division|preserve from groups]] a notion of [[Division (mathematics)|division]]. Division in semigroups (or in monoids) is not possible in general.\n\nThe formal study of semigroups began in the early 20th century. Early results include [[Transformation semigroup#Cayley representation|a Cayley theorem for semigroups]] realizing any semigroup as [[transformation semigroup]], in which arbitrary functions replace the role of bijections from group theory. Other fundamental techniques of studying semigroups like [[Green's relations]] do not imitate anything in group theory though. A deep result in the classification of finite semigroups is [[Krohn–Rhodes theory]]. The theory of finite semigroups has been of particular importance in [[theoretical computer science]] since the 1950s because of the natural link between finite semigroups and [[finite automata]] via the [[syntactic monoid]]<!-- ({{harvnb|Eilenberg|1973}}, [[#CITEREFEilenberg1976|1976]])-->.  In [[probability theory]], semigroups are associated with [[Markov process]]es.<ref>{{harv|Feller|1971}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = On the variety of linear recurrences and numerical semigroups|journal = [[Semigroup Forum]]|date = 2013-11-14|issn = 0037-1912|pages = 569–574|volume = 88|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00233-013-9551-2|language = en|first = Ivan|last = Martino|first2 = Luca|last2 = Martino|arxiv = 1207.0111}}</ref> In other areas of [[applied mathematics]], semigroups are fundamental models for [[linear time-invariant system]]s.  In [[partial differential equations]], a semigroup is associated to any equation whose spatial evolution is independent of time. There are numerous [[special classes of semigroups]], semigroups with additional properties, which appear in particular applications. Some of these classes are even closer to groups by exhibiting some additional but not all properties of a group. Of these we mention: [[regular semigroup]]s, [[orthodox semigroup]]s, [[semigroup with involution|semigroups with involution]], [[inverse semigroup]]s and [[cancellative semigroup]]s. There also interesting classes of semigroups that do not contain any groups except the [[trivial group]]; examples of the latter kind are [[band (mathematics)|bands]] and their commutative subclass&mdash;[[semilattice]]s, which are also [[:Category:Ordered algebraic structures|ordered algebraic structure]]s.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Group}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA semigroup is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] <math>S</math> together with a [[binary operation]] \"<math>\\cdot</math>\" (that is, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>\\cdot:S\\times S\\rightarrow S</math>) that satisfies the [[associative property]]:\n\n:For all <math>a,b,c\\in S</math>, the equation <math>(a\\cdot b)\\cdot c = a\\cdot(b\\cdot c)</math> holds.\n\nMore succinctly, a semigroup is an associative [[magma (algebra)|magma]].\n\n== Examples of semigroups ==\n* [[Empty semigroup]]: the [[empty set]] forms a semigroup with the [[empty function]] as the binary operation.\n* [[Semigroup with one element]]: there is essentially only one (specifically, only one [[up to]] [[isomorphism]]), the singleton {''a''} with operation {{nowrap|1=''a'' · ''a'' = ''a''}}.\n* [[Semigroup with two elements]]: there are five which are essentially different.\n* The set of positive [[integer]]s with addition. (With 0 included, this becomes a [[monoid]].)\n* The set of [[integer]]s with minimum or maximum. (With positive/negative infinity included, this becomes a monoid.)\n* Square [[Nonnegative matrix|nonnegative matrices]] of a given size with matrix multiplication.\n* Any [[ring ideal|ideal]] of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] with the multiplication of the ring.\n* The set of all finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] over a fixed alphabet Σ with [[concatenation]] of strings as the semigroup operation — the so-called \"[[free semigroup]] over Σ\". With the empty string included, this semigroup becomes the [[free monoid]] over Σ.\n* A probability distribution F together with all [[convolution power]]s of F, with convolution as the operation. This is called a convolution semigroup.\n* A [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a monoid in which every element has an [[inverse element]].\n* [[Transformation semigroup]]s and [[transformation monoid|monoids]].\n* The set of [[continuous function]]s  from a [[topological space]] to itself with composition of functions forms a monoid with the [[identity function]] acting as the identity. More generally, the [[Endomorphism|endomorphisms]] of any object of a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] form a monoid under composition.\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n=== Identity and zero ===\nA '''[[left identity]]''' of a semigroup <math>S</math> (or more generally, [[magma (algebra)|magma]]) is an element <math>e</math> such that for all <math>x</math> in <math>S</math>, <math>ex = x</math>.  Similarly, a '''[[right identity]]''' is an element <math>f</math> such that for all <math>x</math> in <math>S</math>, <math>xf = x</math>. Left and right identities are both called '''one-sided identities'''.  A semigroup may have one or more left identities but no right identity, and vice versa.\n\nA '''two-sided identity''' (or just '''identity''') is an element that is both a left and right identity.  Semigroups with a two-sided identity are called '''[[monoid]]s'''.  A semigroup may have at most one two-sided identity.  If a semigroup has a two-sided identity, then the two-sided identity is the only one-sided identity in the semigroup.  If a semigroup has both a left identity and a right identity, then it has a two-sided identity (which is therefore the unique one-sided identity).\n\nA semigroup <math>S</math> without identity may be [[embedding|embedded]] in a monoid formed by adjoining an element <math>e \\notin S</math> to <math>S</math> and defining <math>e \\cdot s = s \\cdot e = s</math> for all <math>s \\in S \\cup \\{e\\}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobson|2009|p=30, ex. 5}}</ref><ref name=\"lawson98\">{{harvnb|Lawson|1998|loc=[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=_F78nQEACAAJ|page=20|text=adjoining an identity}} p. 20]}}</ref> The notation <math>S^1</math> denotes a monoid obtained from <math>S</math> by adjoining an identity ''if necessary'' (<math>S^1 = S</math> for a monoid).<ref name=\"lawson98\"/>\n\nSimilarly, every magma has at most one [[absorbing element]], which in semigroup theory is called a '''zero'''. Analogous to the above construction, for every semigroup <math>S</math>, one can define <math>S^0</math>, a semigroup with 0 that embeds <math>S</math>.\n\n=== Subsemigroups and ideals ===\n\nThe semigroup operation induces an operation on the collection of its subsets: given subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a semigroup ''S'', their product {{nowrap|''A'' · ''B''}}, written commonly as ''AB'', is the set {{nowrap|{ ''ab'' {{!}} ''a'' in ''A'' and ''b'' in ''B'' }.}} (This notion is defined identically as [[Product of group subsets|it is for groups]].) In terms of this operation, a subset ''A'' is called\n* a '''subsemigroup''' if ''AA'' is a subset of ''A'',\n* a '''right ideal''' if ''AS'' is a subset of ''A'', and\n* a '''left ideal''' if ''SA'' is a subset of ''A''.\n\nIf ''A'' is both a left ideal and a right ideal then it is called an '''ideal''' (or a '''two-sided ideal''').\n\nIf ''S'' is a semigroup, then the intersection of any collection of subsemigroups of ''S'' is also a subsemigroup of ''S''.\nSo the subsemigroups of ''S'' form a [[complete lattice]].\n\nAn example of a semigroup with no minimal ideal is the set of positive integers under addition. The minimal ideal of a [[commutative]] semigroup, when it exists, is a group.\n\n[[Green's relations]], a set of five [[equivalence relation]]s that characterise the elements in terms of the [[principal ideal]]s they generate, are important tools for analysing the ideals of a semigroup and related notions of structure.\n\nThe subset with the property that every element commutes with any other element of the semigroup is called the '''[[center (algebra)|center]]''' of the semigroup.<ref name=\"KilpKilʹp2000\">{{cite book |first=Mati |last=Kilp |first2=U. |last2=Knauer |first3=Aleksandr V. |last3=Mikhalev |title=Monoids, Acts, and Categories: With Applications to Wreath Products and Graphs : a Handbook for Students and Researchers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gPhmmW-EGcC&pg=PA25 |year=2000 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-015248-7 |page=25 |zbl=0945.20036}}</ref> The center of a semigroup is actually a subsemigroup.<ref name=\"Li͡apin1968\">{{cite book |first=E.

A function {{nowrap|''f'': ''S'' → ''T''}} between two semigroups is a homomorphism if the equation\n:{{nowrap|1=''f''(''ab'') = ''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'')}}.\nholds for all elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', i.e. the result is the same when performing the semigroup operation after or before applying the map ''f''.\n\nA semigroup homomorphism between monoids preserves identity if it is a [[monoid homomorphism]]. But there are semigroup homomorphisms which are not monoid homomorphisms, e.g. the canonical embedding of a semigroup <math>S</math> without identity into <math>S^1</math>. Conditions characterizing monoid homomorphisms are discussed further. Let <math>f:S_0\\to S_1</math> be a semigroup homomorphism. The image of <math>f</math> is also a semigroup. If <math>S_0</math> is a monoid with an identity element <math>e_0</math>, then <math>f(e_0)</math> is the identity element in the image of <math>f</math>. If <math>S_1</math> is also a monoid with an identity element <math>e_1</math> and <math>e_1</math> belongs to the image of <math>f</math>, then <math>f(e_0)=e_1</math>, i.e. <math>f</math> is a monoid homomorphism. Particularly, if <math>f</math> is [[surjective]], then it is a monoid homomorphism.\n\nTwo semigroups ''S'' and ''T'' are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if there is a [[bijection]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S'' ↔ ''T''}} with the property that, for any elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''ab'') = ''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'')}}. Isomorphic semigroups have the same structure.\n\nA '''semigroup congruence''' <math>\\sim</math> is an [[equivalence relation]] that is compatible with the semigroup operation. That is, a subset <math>\\sim\\;\\subseteq S\\times S</math> that is an equivalence relation and <math>x\\sim y\\,</math> and <math>u\\sim v\\,</math> implies <math>xu\\sim yv\\,</math> for every <math>x,y,u,v</math> in ''S''. Like any equivalence relation, a semigroup congruence <math>\\sim</math> induces [[equivalence class|congruence class]]es\n\n:<math>[a]_\\sim = \\{x\\in S\\vert\\; x\\sim a\\}</math>\n\nand the semigroup operation induces a binary operation <math>\\circ</math> on the congruence classes:\n\n:<math>[u]_\\sim\\circ [v]_\\sim = [uv]_\\sim</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\sim</math> is a congruence, the set of all congruence classes of <math>\\sim</math> forms a semigroup with <math>\\circ</math>, called the '''quotient semigroup''' or '''factor semigroup''', and denoted <math>S/\\sim</math>. The mapping <math>x \\mapsto [x]_\\sim</math> is a semigroup homomorphism, called the '''quotient map''', '''canonical [[surjection]]''' or '''projection'''; if S is a monoid then quotient semigroup is a monoid with identity <math>[1]_\\sim</math>. Conversely, the [[Kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of any semigroup homomorphism is a semigroup congruence. These results are nothing more than a particularization of the [[Isomorphism theorems#First Isomorphism Theorem 4|first isomorphism theorem in universal algebra]].  Congruence classes and factor monoids are the objects of study in [[string rewriting system]]s.\n\nA '''nuclear congruence''' on ''S'' is one which is the kernel of an endomorphism of ''S''.<ref name=LotII463>{{harvnb|Lothaire|2011|p=463}}</ref>\n\nA semigroup ''S'' satisfies the '''maximal condition on congruences''' if any family of congruences on ''S'', ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element.  By [[Zorn's lemma]], this is equivalent to saying that the [[ascending chain condition]] holds: there is no infinite strictly ascending chain of congruences on ''S''.<ref name=LotII465>{{harvnb|Lothaire|2011|p=465}}</ref>\n\nEvery ideal ''I'' of a semigroup induces a subsemigroup, the [[Rees factor semigroup]] via the congruence {{nowrap|''x'' ρ ''y''}} &nbsp; ⇔ &nbsp;  either {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}} or both ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''I''.\n\n=== Quotients and divisions ===\nThe following notions<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pin|first1=Jean-Éric|title=Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory|date=November 30, 2016|page=19|url=http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~jep/PDF/MPRI/MPRI.pdf}}</ref> introduce the idea that a semigroup is contained in another one.\n\nA semigroup '''T''' is a quotient of a semigroup '''S''' if there is a surjective semigroup morphism from '''S''' to '''T'''. For example, <math>(\\mathbb Z/2\\mathbb Z,+)</math> is a quotient of <math>(\\mathbb Z/4\\mathbb Z,+)</math>, using the morphism consisting of taking the remainder modulo '''2''' of an integer.\n\nA semigroup '''T''' divides a semigroup '''S''', noted <math>T\\preceq S</math> if '''T''' is a quotient of a subsemigroup '''S'''. In particular, subsemigroups of '''S''' divides '''T''', while it is not necessarily the case that there are a quotient of '''S'''.\n\nBoth of those relation are transitive.\n\n== Structure of semigroups ==\nFor any subset ''A'' of ''S'' there is a smallest subsemigroup ''T'' of ''S'' which contains ''A'', and we say that ''A'' '''generates''' ''T''. A single element ''x'' of ''S'' generates the subsemigroup { ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> {{!}} ''n'' ∈ '''Z'''<sup>+</sup> }. If this is finite, then ''x'' is said to be of '''finite order''', otherwise it is of '''infinite order'''.\nA semigroup is said to be '''periodic''' if all of its elements are of finite order.\nA semigroup generated by a single element is said to be [[monogenic semigroup|monogenic]] (or [[Cyclic semigroup|cyclic]]). If a monogenic semigroup is infinite then it is isomorphic to the semigroup of positive [[integer]]s with the operation of addition.\nIf it is finite and nonempty, then it must contain at least one [[idempotent]].\nIt follows that every nonempty periodic semigroup has at least one idempotent.\n\nA subsemigroup which is also a group is called a '''[[subgroup]]'''. There is a close relationship between the subgroups of a semigroup and its idempotents. Each subgroup contains exactly one idempotent, namely the identity element of the subgroup. For each idempotent ''e'' of the semigroup there is a unique maximal subgroup containing ''e''. Each maximal subgroup arises in this way, so there is a one-to-one correspondence between idempotents and maximal subgroups. Here the term ''[[maximal subgroup]]'' differs from its standard use in group theory.\n\nMore can often be said when the order is finite. For example, every nonempty finite semigroup is periodic, and has a minimal [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] and at least one idempotent. The number of finite semigroups of a given size (greater than 1) is (obviously) larger than the number of groups of the same size. For example, of the sixteen possible \"multiplication tables\" for a set of two elements {{nowrap|{a, b},}} eight form semigroups<ref group=\"note\">Namely: the trivial semigroup in which (for all ''x'' and ''y'') {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = a}} and its counterpart in which {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = b}}, the semigroups based on multiplication modulo 2 (choosing a or b as the identity element 1), the groups equivalent to addition modulo 2 (choosing a or b to be the identity element 0), and the semigroups in which the elements are either both left identities or both right identities.</ref> whereas only four of these are monoids and only two form groups. For more on the structure of finite semigroups, see [[Krohn–Rhodes theory]].\n\n== Special classes of semigroups ==\n{{Main|Special classes of semigroups}}\n* A [[monoid]] is a semigroup with identity.\n* A subsemigroup is a [[subset]] of a semigroup that is closed under the semigroup operation.\n* A [[cancellative semigroup]] is one having the [[cancellation property]]:<ref>{{harvnb|Clifford|Preston|1967|p=3}}</ref> {{nowrap|1=''a'' · ''b'' = ''a'' · ''c''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} and similarly for {{nowrap|1=''b'' · ''a'' = ''c'' · ''a''}}.\n* A [[band (algebra)|band]] is a semigroup whose operation is [[idempotent]].\n* A [[semilattice]] is a semigroup whose operation is idempotent and [[commutativity|commutative]].\n* [[0-simple]] semigroups.\n* [[Transformation semigroup]]s: any finite semigroup ''S'' can be represented by transformations of a (state-) set ''Q'' of at most {{nowrap|{{abs|''S''}} + 1}} states. Each element ''x'' of ''S'' then maps ''Q'' into itself {{nowrap|''x'': ''Q'' → ''Q''}} and sequence ''xy'' is defined by {{nowrap|1=''q''(''xy'') = (''qx'')''y''}} for each ''q'' in ''Q''. Sequencing clearly is an associative operation, here equivalent to [[function composition]]. This representation is basic for any [[automaton]] or [[finite state machine]] (FSM).\n* The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is in fact a monoid, which can be described as the [[free semigroup]] on two generators ''p'' and ''q'', under the relation {{nowrap|1=''pq'' = 1}}.\n* [[C0-semigroup|C<sub>0</sub>-semigroups]].\n* [[Regular semigroup]]s. Every element ''x'' has at least one inverse ''y'' satisfying {{nowrap|1=''xyx''=''x''}} and {{nowrap|1=''yxy''=''y''}}; the elements ''x'' and ''y'' are sometimes called \"mutually inverse\".\n* [[Inverse semigroup]]s are regular semigroups where every element has exactly one inverse. Alternatively, a regular semigroup is inverse if and only if any two idempotents commute.\n* Affine semigroup: a semigroup that is isomorphic to a finitely-generated subsemigroup of Z<sup>d</sup>.  These semigroups have applications to [[commutative algebra]].\n\n==Structure theorem for commutative semigroups==\n\nThere is a structure theorem for commutative semigroups in terms of [[semilattice]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Grillet|2001}}</ref> A semilattice (or more precisely a meet-semilattice) <math> (L, \\le) </math> is a [[partially ordered set]] where every pair of elements <math>a,b \\in L</math> has a [[greatest lower bound]], denoted <math>a \\wedge b</math>.  The operation <math>\\wedge</math> makes <math> L</math> into a semigroup satisfying the additional [[idempotence]] law <math> a \\wedge a = a </math>.\n\nGiven a homomorphism <math> f: S \\to L </math> from an arbitrary semigroup to a semilattice, each inverse image <math> S_a = f^{-1} \\{a \\} </math> is a (possibly empty) semigroup.  Moreover, <math> S</math> becomes '''graded''' by <math> L</math>, in the sense that\n\n<math> S_a S_b \\subseteq S_{a \\wedge b} </math>\n\nIf <math> f </math> is onto, the semilattice <math> L</math> is isomorphic to the [[quotient]] of <math>S</math> by the equivalence relation <math> \\sim </math> such that <math> x \\sim y </math> iff <math> f(x) = f(y) </math>.  This equivalence relation is a semigroup congruence, as defined above.\n\nWhenever we take the quotient of a commutative semigroup by a congruence, we get another commutative semigroup.  The structure theorem says that for any commutative semigroup <math>S</math>, there is a finest congruence <math> \\sim </math> such that the quotient of <math> S</math> by this equivalence relation is a semilattice.

Roughly speaking, the semigroup approach is to regard a time-dependent partial differential equation as an [[ordinary differential equation]] on a function space.  For example, consider the following initial/boundary value problem for the [[heat equation]] on the spatial [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{nowrap|(0, 1) ⊂ '''R'''}} and times {{nowrap|''t'' ≥ 0}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} \\partial_{t} u(t, x) = \\partial_{x}^{2} u(t, x), & x \\in (0, 1), t > 0; \\\\ u(t, x) = 0, & x \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}, t > 0; \\\\ u(t, x) = u_{0} (x), & x \\in (0, 1), t = 0. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nLet {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''L''<sup>2</sup>((0, 1) '''R''')}} be the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>''p''</sup> space]] of square-integrable real-valued functions with domain the interval {{nowrap|(0, 1)}} and let ''A'' be the second-derivative operator with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]\n\n:<math>D(A) = \\big\\{ u \\in H^{2} ((0, 1); \\mathbf{R}) \\big| u(0) = u(1) = 0 \\big\\},</math>\n\nwhere ''H''<sup>2</sup> is a [[Sobolev space]]. Then the above initial/boundary value problem can be interpreted as an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation on the space ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} \\dot{u}(t) = A u (t); \\\\ u(0) = u_{0}. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nOn an heuristic level, the solution to this problem \"ought\" to be {{nowrap|1=''u''(''t'') = exp(''tA'')''u''<sub>0</sub>}}.  However, for a rigorous treatment, a meaning must be given to the [[exponentiation|exponential]] of ''tA''.  As a function of ''t'', exp(''tA'') is a semigroup of operators from ''X'' to itself, taking the initial state ''u''<sub>0</sub> at time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}} to the state {{nowrap|1=''u''(''t'') = exp(''tA'')''u''<sub>0</sub>}} at time ''t''.  The operator ''A'' is said to be the [[C0 semigroup#Infinitesimal generator|infinitesimal generator]] of the semigroup.\n\n==History==\nThe study of semigroups trailed behind that of other algebraic structures with more complex axioms such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]] or [[ring (algebra)|rings]].

The term is used in English in 1908 in Harold Hinton's ''Theory of Groups of Finite Order''.\n\n[[Anton Sushkevich]] obtained the first non-trivial results about semigroups. His 1928 paper \"Über die endlichen Gruppen ohne das Gesetz der eindeutigen Umkehrbarkeit\" (\"On finite groups without the rule of unique invertibility\") determined the structure of finite [[simple semigroup]]s and showed that the minimal ideal (or [[Green's relations]] J-class) of a finite semigroup is simple.<ref name=Hollings/> From that point on, the foundations of semigroup theory were further laid by [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]], [[James Alexander Green]], [[Evgenii Sergeevich Lyapin]], [[Alfred H. Clifford]] and [[Gordon Preston]]. The latter two published a two-volume monograph on semigroup theory in 1961 and 1967 respectively. In 1970, a new periodical called ''[[Semigroup Forum]]'' (currently edited by [[Springer Verlag]]) became one of the few mathematical journals devoted entirely to semigroup theory.\n\nThe [[representation theory]] of semigroups was developed in 1963 by [[Boris Schein]] using [[binary relation]]s on a set ''A'' and [[composition of relations]] for the semigroup product.<ref>B.

''N''-ary associativity is a string of length {{math|''n'' + (''n'' − ''1'')}} with any ''n'' adjacent elements bracketed. A 2-ary semigroup is just a semigroup. Further axioms lead to an [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]].\n\nA third generalization is the [[semigroupoid]], in which the requirement that the binary relation be total is lifted. As categories generalize monoids in the same way, a semigroupoid behaves much like a category but lacks identities.\n\nInfinitary generalizations of commutative semigroups have sometimes been considered by various authors.<ref>See references in Udo Hebisch and Hanns Joachim  Weinert, ''Semirings  and  Semifields'', in particular, Section 10, ''Semirings  with  infinite sums'', in M.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[abstract algebra]], a '''semigroup with involution''' or a '''*-semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] equipped with an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]], which&mdash;roughly speaking&mdash;brings it closer to a [[group (mathematics)|group]] because this involution, considered as [[unary operator]], exhibits certain fundamental properties of the operation of taking the inverse in a group: uniqueness, double application \"cancelling itself out\", and the same interaction law with the binary operation as in the case of the group inverse. It is thus not a surprise that any group is a semigroup with involution. However, there are significant natural examples of semigroups with involution that are not groups.\n\nAn example from [[linear algebra]] is the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] [[monoid]] of [[Real number|real]] square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order&nbsp;''n'' (called the [[full linear monoid]]). The [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a matrix to its [[transpose]] is an involution because the transpose is well defined for any matrix and obeys the law {{nowrap|1=(''AB'')<sup>T</sup> = ''B''<sup>T</sup>''A''<sup>T</sup>}}, which has the same form of interaction with multiplication as taking inverses has in the [[general linear group]] (which is a subgroup of the full linear monoid). However, for an arbitrary matrix, ''AA''<sup>T</sup> does not equal the identity element (namely the [[diagonal matrix]]). Another example, coming from [[formal language]] theory, is the [[free semigroup]] generated by a [[nonempty set]] (an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]), with string [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the involution being the map which [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reverse]]s the [[linear order]] of the letters in a string. A third example, from basic [[set theory]], is the set of all [[binary relation]]s between a set and itself, with the involution being the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]].\n\nSemigroups with involution appeared explicitly named in a 1953 paper of [[Viktor Wagner]] (in Russian) as result of his attempt to bridge the theory of semigroups with that of [[semiheap]]s.<ref name=\"Hollings2014\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=265}}</ref>\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet ''S'' be a [[semigroup]] with its binary operation written multiplicatively.

As noted in the previous example, the inversion map is not necessarily the only map with this property in an inverse semigroup. There may well be other involutions that leave all idempotents invariant; for example the identity map on a commutative regular, hence inverse, semigroup, in particular, an abelian group. A [[regular semigroup]] is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if it admits an involution under which each idempotent is an invariant.<ref>Munn, Lemma 1</ref>\n# Underlying every [[C*-algebra]] is a *-semigroup.

This semigroup is also a [[regular semigroup]], as all bands are.<ref name=\"Nordahl and Scheiblich\">Nordahl and Scheiblich</ref>\n\n==Basic concepts and properties==\nAn element ''x'' of a semigroup with involution is sometimes called ''hermitian'' (by analogy with a [[Hermitian matrix]]) when it is left invariant by the involution, meaning ''x''* = ''x''. Elements of the form ''xx''* or ''x''*''x'' are always hermitian, and so are all powers of a hermitian element. As noted in the examples section,  a semigroup ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]] and admits an involution such that every idempotent is hermitian.<ref>Easdown, David, and W. D. Munn. \"On semigroups with involution.\" Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 48.01 (1993): 93-100.</ref>\n\nCertain basic concepts may be defined on *-semigroups in a way that parallels the notions stemming from a [[Regular semigroup|regular element in a semigroup]]. A ''partial isometry'' is an element ''s''  such that ''ss''*''s'' = ''s''; the set of partial isometries of a semigroup ''S'' is usually abbreviated PI(''S'').<ref>Lawson, p. 116</ref> A ''projection'' is an idempotent element ''e'' that is also hermitian, meaning that ''ee'' = ''e'' and ''e''* = ''e''. Every projection is a partial isometry, and for every partial isometry ''s'', ''s''*''s'' and ''ss''* are projections. If ''e'' and ''f'' are projections, then ''e'' = ''ef'' if and only if ''e'' = ''fe''.<ref name=\"L117\">Lawson, p. 117</ref>\n\nPartial isometries can be [[partial order|partially ordered]] by ''s'' ≤ ''t'' defined as holding whenever ''s'' = ''ss''*''t'' and ''ss''* = ''ss''*''tt''*.<ref name=\"L117\"/> Equivalently, ''s'' ≤ ''t'' if and only if  ''s'' = ''et'' and ''e'' = ''ett''* for some projection ''e''.<ref name=\"L117\"/> In a *-semigroup, PI(''S'') is an [[ordered groupoid]] with the [[Partial groupoid|partial product]] given by ''s''&sdot;''t'' = ''st'' if ''s''*''s'' = ''tt''*.<ref>Lawson, p. 118</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\nIn terms of examples for these notions, in the *-semigroup of binary relations on a set, the partial isometries are the relations that are [[difunctional]]. The projections in this *-semigroup are the [[partial equivalence relation]]s.<ref>Lawson p.122 and p.35</ref>\n\nThe [[partial isometry|partial isometries]] in a C*-algebra are exactly those defined in this section. In the case of ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') more can be said. If ''E'' and ''F'' are projections, then ''E'' ≤ ''F'' if and only if [[Image (mathematics)|im]]''E'' ⊆ im''F''. For any two projection, if ''E'' ∩ ''F'' = ''V'', then the unique projection ''J'' with image ''V'' and kernel the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''V'' is the meet of ''E'' and ''F''. Since projections form a meet-[[semilattice]], the partial isometries on ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') form an inverse semigroup with the product <math>A(A^*A\\wedge BB^*)B</math>.<ref>Lawson p.120</ref>\n\nAnother simple example of these notions appears in the next section.\n\n== Notions of regularity ==\nThere two related, but not identical notions of regularity in *-semigroups. They were introduced nearly simultaneously by Nordahl & Scheiblich (1978) and respectively Drazin (1979).<ref>Crvenkovic and Dolinka</ref>\n\n=== Regular *-semigroups (Nordahl & Scheiblich) ===\nAs mentioned in the [[#Examples|previous examples]], [[inverse semigroup]]s are a subclass of *-semigroups. It is also textbook knowledge that an inverse semigroup can be characterized as a regular semigroup in which any two idempotents commute. In 1963, [[Boris M. Schein]] has published the following two axioms providing an analogous characterization of inverse semigroups as a [[Variety (universal algebra)|subvariety]] of *-semigroups:\n\n* ''x'' = ''xx''*''x''\n* (''xx''*)(''x''*''x'') = (''x''*''x'')(''xx''*)\n\nThe first of these looks like the definition of a regular element, but is actually in terms of the involution. Likewise, the second axiom appears to be describing the commutation of two idempotents. It is known however that regular semigroups do not form a variety because their class does not contain [[free object]]s (a result established by [[D. B. McAlister]] in 1968). This line of reasoning motivated Nordahl and Scheiblich to begin in 1977 the study of the (variety of) *-semigroups that satisfy only the first these two axioms; because of the similarity in form with the property defining regular semigroups, they named this variety regular *-semigroups.\n\nIt is a simple calculation to establish that a regular *-semigroup is also a regular semigroup because ''x''* turns out to be an inverse of ''x''. The rectangular band from [[#ex7|Example 7]] is a regular *-semigroup that is not an inverse semigroup.<ref name=\"Nordahl and Scheiblich\"/> It is also easy to verify that in a regular *-semigroup the product of any two projections is an idempotent.<ref>Nordahl and Scheiblich, Theorem 2.5</ref> In the aforementioned rectangular band example, the projections are elements of the form (''x'', ''x'') and [like all elements of a band] are idempotent. However, two different projections in this band need not commute, nor is their product necessarily a projection since (''a'', ''a'')(''b'', ''b'') = (''a'', ''b'').\n\nSemigroups that satisfy only ''x''** = ''x'' = ''xx''*''x'' (but not necessarily the antidistributivity of * over multiplication) have also been studied under the name of [[I-semigroup]]s.\n\n====P-systems====\nThe problem of characterizing when a regular semigroup is a regular *-semigroup (in the sense of Nordahl & Scheiblich) was addressed by M. Yamada (1982). He defined a '''P-system''' F(S) as subset of the idempotents of S, denoted as usual by E(S). Using the usual notation V(''a'') for the inverses of ''a'', F(S) needs to satisfy the following axioms:\n\n# For any ''a'' in S, there exists a unique a° in V(''a'') such that ''aa''° and ''a''°''a'' are in F(S)\n# For any ''a'' in S, and b in F(S), ''a°ba'' is in F(S), where ° is the well-defined operation from the previous axiom\n# For any ''a'', ''b'' in F(S), ''ab'' is in E(S); note: not necessarily in F(S)\n\nA regular semigroup S is a *-regular semigroup, as defined by Nordahl & Scheiblich, if and only if it has a p-system F(S). In this case F(S) is the set of projections of S with respect to the operation ° defined by F(S). In an [[inverse semigroup]] the entire semilattice of idempotents is a p-system. Also, if a regular semigroup S has a p-system that is multiplicatively closed (i.e. subsemigroup), then S is an inverse semigroup. Thus, a p-system may be regarded as a generalization of the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup.\n\n===*-regular semigroups (Drazin)===\n{{anchor|Drazin}}\n{{expand section|clarify motivation for studying these|date=April 2015}}\nA semigroup ''S'' with an involution * is called a '''*-regular semigroup''' (in the sense of Drazin) if for every ''x'' in ''S'', ''x''* is ''H''-equivalent to some inverse of ''x'', where ''H'' is the [[Green's relations|Green’s relation]] ''H''. This defining property can be formulated in several equivalent ways. Another is to say that every [[Green's relations#The L.2C R.2C and J relations|''L''-class]] contains a projection. An axiomatic definition is the condition that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exists an  element ''x''′ such that {{nowrap|1=''x''′''xx′'' = ''x''′}}, {{nowrap|1=''xx''′''x'' = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=(''xx''′)* = ''xx''′}}, {{nowrap|1=(''x''′''x'')* = ''x''′''x''}}. [[Michael P. Drazin]] first proved that given ''x'', the element ''x′'' satisfying these axioms is unique. It is called the Moore&ndash;Penrose inverse of ''x''. This agrees with the classical definition of the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]] of a square matrix.\nIn the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] semigroup ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''C'') of square matrices of order ''n'', the map which assigns a matrix ''A'' to its [[Hermitian conjugate]] ''A''* is an involution. The semigroup ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''C'') is a *-regular semigroup with this involution. The Moore–Penrose inverse of A in this *-regular semigroup is the classical Moore–Penrose inverse of ''A''.\n\n==Free semigroup with involution ==\nAs with all varieties, the [[category theory|category]] of semigroups with involution admits [[free object]]s. The construction of a free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that of a [[free semigroup]] (and respectively that of a free monoid). Moreover, the construction of a [[free group]] can easily be derived by refining the construction of a free monoid with involution.<ref name=\"L51\">Lawson p. 51</ref>\n\nThe [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]] of a free semigroup with involution are the elements of the union of two ([[equinumerous]]) [[disjoint sets]] in [[Bijection|bijective correspondence]]: <math>Y=X\\sqcup X^\\dagger</math>. (Here the notation <math>\\sqcup\\,</math> emphasized that the union is actually a [[disjoint union]].) In the case were the two sets are finite, their union ''Y'' is sometimes called an ''[[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] with involution''<ref name=\"EhrenfeuchtHarju1999\">{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Ehrenfeucht|author2=T.

Thus, the semigroup <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> with the map <math>{ }^\\dagger\\,</math> is a semigroup with involution, called a '''free semigroup with involution''' on ''X''.<ref name=\"L172\">Lawson p. 172</ref> (The irrelevance of the concrete identity of <math>X^\\dagger</math> and of the bijection <math>\\theta</math> in this choice of terminology is explained below in terms of the universal property of the construction.) Note that unlike in [[#ex6|Example 6]], the involution ''of every letter'' is a distinct element in an alphabet with involution, and consequently the same observation extends to a free semigroup with involution.\n\nIf in the above construction instead of <math>Y^+\\,</math> we use the [[free monoid]]  <math>Y^*=Y^+\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}</math>, which is just the free semigroup extended with the [[empty word]] <math>\\varepsilon\\,</math> (which is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] <math>Y^*\\,</math>), and suitably extend the involution with <math>\\varepsilon^\\dagger = \\varepsilon</math>,\nwe obtain a '''free monoid with involution'''.<ref name=\"Lipscomb1996\"/>\n\nThe construction above is actually the only way to extend a given map <math>\\theta\\,</math> from <math>X\\,</math> to <math>X^\\dagger\\,</math>, to an involution on <math>Y^+\\,</math> (and likewise on <math>Y^*\\,</math>). The qualifier \"free\" for these constructions is justified in the usual sense that they are [[universal algebra|universal construction]]s. In the case of the free semigroup with involution, given an arbitrary semigroup with involution <math>S\\,</math> and a map <math>\\Phi:X\\rightarrow S</math>, then a [[semigroup homomorphism]] <math>\\overline\\Phi:(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+\\rightarrow S</math> exists such that <math>\\Phi = \\iota \\circ \\overline\\Phi</math>, where <math>\\iota : X \\rightarrow (X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> is the [[inclusion map]] and [[composition of functions]] is taken in [[Function composition#Alternative notations|diagram order]].<ref name=\"L172\"/> The construction of <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> as a semigroup with involution is unique up to [[isomorphism]]. An analogous argument holds for the free monoid with involution in terms of [[monoid homomorphism]]s and the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the construction of <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^*</math> as a monoid with involution.\n\nThe construction of a [[free group]] is not very far off from that of a free monoid with involution. The additional ingredient needed is to define a notion of [[reduced word]] and a [[rewriting]] rule for producing such words simply by deleting any adjacent pairs of letter of the form <math>xx^\\dagger</math> or <math>x^\\dagger x</math>. It can be shown than the order of rewriting (deleting) such pairs does not matter, i.e. any order of deletions produces the same result.<ref name=\"L51\"/> (Otherwise put, these rules define a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] rewriting system.) Equivalently, a free group is constructed from a free monoid with involution by taking the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient]] of the latter by the [[Congruence relation|congruence]] <math>\\{ (yy^\\dagger, \\varepsilon) : y\\in Y\\}</math>, which is sometimes called the '''Dyck congruence'''&mdash;in a certain sense it generalizes [[Dyck language]] to multiple kinds of \"parentheses\" However simplification in the Dyck congruence takes place regardless of order. For example, if \")\" is the inverse of \"(\", then <math>()=)(=\\varepsilon</math>; the one-sided congruence that appears in the Dyck language proper <math>\\{ (xx^\\dagger, \\varepsilon) : x\\in X\\}</math>, which instantiates only to <math>()=\\varepsilon</math> is (perhaps confusingly) called the '''Shamir congruence'''. The quotient of a free monoid with involution by the Shamir congruence is not a group, but a monoid <!--with involution?-->; nevertheless it has been called the '''free half group''' by its first discoverer&mdash;[[Eli Shamir]]&mdash;although more recently it has been called the '''involutive monoid''' generated by ''X''.<ref name=\"Sakarovitch\"/><ref name=\"DrosteKuich2009\">{{cite book|editors=Manfred Droste, Werner Kuich, Heiko Vogler|title=Handbook of Weighted Automata|year=2009|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-01492-5|page=271|authors=Ion Petre and [[Arto Salomaa]]|chapter=Algebraic Systems and Pushdown Automata}}</ref> (This latter choice of terminology conflicts however with the use of \"involutive\" to denote any semigroup with involution&mdash;a practice also encountered in the literature.<ref name=\"Neeb2000\">{{cite book|author=Karl-Hermann Neeb|title=Holomorphy and Convexity in Lie Theory|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-015669-0|page=21}}</ref><ref name=\"BeltramettiCassinelli2010\">{{cite book|author1=Enrico G.

The basic example would be the three integers 0, 1, and −1, together with the operation of multiplication. Multiplication of integers is associative, and the product of any two of these three integers is again one of these three integers.\n\nThere are 18 inequivalent ways to define an associative operation on three elements: while there are, altogether, a total of 3<sup>9</sup> = 19683 different binary operations that can be defined, only 113 of these are associative, and many of these are [[isomorphic]] or [[antiisomorphic]] so that there are essentially only 18 possibilities. <ref name=distler>Andreas Distler, [http://bcc2009.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Theses/andreasDthesis.pdf Classification and enumeration of finite semigroups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121217/http://bcc2009.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Theses/andreasDthesis.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}, PhD thesis, [[University of St. Andrews]]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Friðrik Diego|author2=Kristín Halla Jónsdóttir |title=Associative Operations on a Three-Element Set|journal=The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast|date=July 2008|volume=5|issue=2 & 3|pages=257–268|url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol5no2and3/TMME_vol5nos2and3_a8_pp.257_268.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne of these is ''C''<sub>3</sub>, the [[cyclic group]] with three elements. The others all have a [[semigroup with two elements]] as [[subsemigroup]]s. In the example above, the set {−1,0,1} under multiplication contains both {0,1} and {−1,1} as subsemigroups (the latter is a sub''group'', [[cyclic group|''C''<sub>2</sub>]]). \n\nSix of these are [[band (mathematics)|bands]], meaning that all three elements are [[idempotent]], so that the product of any element with itself is itself again. Two of these bands are [[commutative]], therefore [[semilattices]] (one of them is the three-element totally ordered set, and the other is a three-element semilattice that is not a lattice). The other four come in anti-isomorphic pairs. \n\nOne of these non-commutative bands results from adjoining an [[identity element]] to ''LO''<sub>2</sub>, the [[left zero semigroup]] with two elements (or, dually, to ''RO''<sub>2</sub>, the [[right zero semigroup]]). It is sometimes called the '''flip-flop monoid''', referring to [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop circuits]] used in electronics: the three elements can be described as \"set\", \"reset\", and \"do nothing\". This semigroup occurs in the [[Krohn–Rhodes theory|Krohn–Rhodes decomposition]] of finite semigroups.<ref>\"This innocuous three-element semigroup plays an important role in what follows...\" – [https://books.google.ca/books?id=0ukzw5VszNwC Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra] by [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|John L.

For instance, if we choose 1 to be the [[truth value]] \"[[Truth|true]]\" and 0 to be the [[truth value]] \"[[False (logic)|false]]\" and the operation to be the [[logical connective]] \"[[Logical conjunction|and]]\", we obtain this semigroup in [[logic]].

[[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a '''meet-semilattice''' (or '''lower semilattice''') is a partially ordered set which has a [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] (or [[greatest lower bound]]) for any nonempty finite subset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the [[inverse order]] and vice versa.\n\nSemilattices can also be defined [[algebra|algebraically]]: join and meet are [[associativity|associative]], [[commutativity|commutative]], [[idempotency|idempotent]] [[binary operation]]s, and any such operation induces a partial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the operation for any two elements is the least upper bound (or greatest lower bound) of the elements with respect to this partial order. \n\nA [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is a partially ordered set that is both a meet- and join-semilattice with respect to the same partial order. Algebraically, a lattice is a set with two associative, commutative idempotent binary operations linked by corresponding [[absorption law]]s.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Lattice}}\n\n== Order-theoretic definition ==\n\nA [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by the [[binary relation]] ≤ is a ''meet-semilattice'' if\n\n: For all elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''S'', the [[infimum|greatest lower bound]] of the set {{nowrap begin}}{''x'', ''y''}{{nowrap end}} exists.\n\nThe greatest lower bound of the set {{nowrap begin}}{''x'', ''y''}{{nowrap end}} is called the [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] of ''x'' and ''y'', denoted {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y''}}.\n\nReplacing \"greatest lower bound\" with \"[[supremum|least upper bound]]\" results in the dual concept of a ''join-semilattice''. The least upper bound of {''x'', ''y''} is called the [[Join (mathematics)|join]] of ''x'' and ''y'', denoted {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y''}}. Meet and join are [[binary operation]]s on ''S''. A simple [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument shows that the existence of all possible pairwise suprema (infima), as per the definition, implies the existence of all non-empty finite suprema (infima).\n\nA join-semilattice is '''bounded''' if it has a [[least element]], the join of the empty set. [[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a meet-semilattice is '''bounded''' if it has a [[greatest element]], the meet of the empty set.\n\nOther properties may be assumed; see the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness in order theory]] for more discussion on this subject. That article also discusses how we may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable [[Galois connection]]s between related posets — an approach of special interest for [[category theory|category theoretic]] investigations of the concept.\n\n== Algebraic definition ==\nA ''meet-semilattice'' is an [[algebraic structure]] <math>\\langle S, \\land \\rangle</math> consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' with a [[binary operation]] ∧, called '''meet''', such that for all members ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' of ''S'', the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] hold:\n\n; [[Associativity]]: ''x'' ∧ (''y'' ∧ ''z'') = (''x'' ∧ ''y'') ∧ ''z''\n; [[Commutativity]]: ''x'' ∧ ''y'' = ''y'' ∧ ''x''\n; [[Idempotency]]: ''x'' ∧ ''x'' = ''x''\n\nA meet-semilattice <math>\\langle S, \\land \\rangle</math> is '''bounded''' if ''S'' includes an [[identity element]] 1 such that {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ 1 {{=}} ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''S''. \n\nIf the symbol ∨, called '''join''', replaces ∧ in the definition just given, the structure is called a ''join-semilattice''. One can be ambivalent about the particular choice of symbol for the operation, and speak simply of ''semilattices''.\n\nA semilattice is a [[commutativity|commutative]], [[idempotency|idempotent]] [[semigroup]]; i.e., a commutative [[band (mathematics)|band]]. A bounded semilattice is an idempotent commutative [[monoid]].\n\nA partial order is induced on a meet-semilattice by setting {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}. For a join-semilattice, the order is induced by setting {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y'' {{=}} ''y''}}. In a bounded meet-semilattice, the identity 1 is the greatest element of ''S''. Similarly, an identity element in a join semilattice is a least element.\n\n== Connection between both definitions ==\nAn order theoretic meet-semilattice {{nowrap|&lang;''S'', ≤&rang;}} gives rise to a [[binary operation]] ∧ such that {{nowrap|&lang;''S'', ∧&rang;}} is an algebraic meet-semilattice. Conversely, the meet-semilattice {{nowrap|&lang;''S'', ∧&rang;}} gives rise to a [[binary relation]] ≤ that partially orders ''S'' in the following way: for all elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' = ''x'' ∧ ''y''.\n\nThe relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering from which the binary operation ∧ may be recovered. Conversely, the order induced by the algebraically defined semilattice {{nowrap|&lang;''S'', ∧&rang;}} coincides with that induced by ≤.\n\nHence both definitions may be used interchangeably, depending on which one is more convenient for a particular purpose. A similar conclusion holds for join-semilattices and the dual ordering ≥.\n\n== Examples ==\nSemilattices are employed to construct other order structures, or in conjunction with other completeness properties.\n* A [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. The interaction of these two semilattices via the [[absorption law]] is what truly distinguishes a lattice from a semilattice.\n* The [[compact element]]s of an algebraic [[lattice (order)|lattice]], under the induced partial ordering, form a bounded join-semilattice.\n* Any finite semilattice is bounded, by induction.\n* A [[totally ordered set]] is a [[distributive lattice]], hence in particular a meet-semilattice and join-semilattice: any two distinct elements have a greater and lesser one, which are their meet and join.\n** A [[well-ordered set]] is further a ''bounded'' join-semilattice, as the set as a whole has a least element, hence it is bounded.\n*** The nonnegative integers ℕ, with their usual order ≤, are a bounded join-semilattice, with least element 0, although they have no greatest element: they are the smallest infinite well-ordered set.\n* Any single-rooted [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] (with the single root as the least element) of height <math>\\leq \\omega</math> is a (generally unbounded) meet-semilattice. Consider for example the set of finite words over some alphabet, ordered by the [[prefix order]]. It has a least element (the empty word), which is an annihilator element of the meet operation, but no greatest (identity) element.\n* A [[Scott domain]] is a meet-semilattice.\n* Membership in any set ''L'' can  be taken as a [[model theory|model]] of a semilattice with base set ''L'', because a semilattice captures the essence of set [[extensionality]]. Let ''a''∧''b'' denote ''a''∈''L'' & ''b''∈''L''. Two sets differing only in one or both of the:\n# Order in which their members are listed;\n# Multiplicity of one or more members,\n:are in fact the same set. Commutativity and associativity of ∧ assure (1), [[idempotence]], (2). This semilattice is the [[free semilattice]] over ''L''.  It is not bounded by ''L'', because a set is not a member of itself.\n* Classical extensional [[mereology]] defines a join-semilattice, with join read as binary fusion. This semilattice is bounded from above by the world individual.\n* Given a set ''S'', the collection of partitions <math> \\xi </math> of ''S'' is a join-semilattice. In fact, the partial order is given by <math> \\xi \\leq \\eta </math> if <math> \\forall Q \\in \\eta, \\exists P \\in \\xi </math> such that <math> Q \\subset P </math> and the join of two partitions is given by <math> \\xi \\vee \\eta = \\{ P \\cap Q \\mid P \\in \\xi \\ \\& \\ Q \\in \\eta \\} </math>.  This semilattice is bounded, with the least element being the singleton partition <math> \\{ S \\} </math>.\n\n== Semilattice morphisms ==\nThe above algebraic definition of a semilattice suggests a notion of [[morphism]] between two semilattices. Given two join-semilattices {{nowrap|(''S'', ∨)}} and {{nowrap|(''T'', ∨)}}, a [[homomorphism]] of (join-) semilattices is a function ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' such that\n\n:''f''(''x'' ∨ ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') ∨ ''f''(''y'').\n\nHence ''f'' is just a homomorphism of the two [[semigroups]] associated with each semilattice. If ''S'' and ''T'' both include a least element 0, then ''f'' should also be a [[monoid]] homomorphism, i.e. we additionally require that\n\n: ''f''(0) = 0.\n\nIn the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of join-semilattices is a function that [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserves binary joins]] and least elements, if such there be. The obvious dual—replacing ∧ with ∨ and 0 with 1—transforms this definition of a join-semilattice homomorphism into its meet-semilattice equivalent.\n\nNote that any semilattice homomorphism is necessarily [[monotone function|monotone]] with respect to the associated ordering relation. For an explanation see the entry [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preservation of limits]].\n\n== Equivalence with algebraic lattices ==\n\nThere is a well-known [[Equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the category <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> of join-semilattices with zero with <math>(\\vee,0)</math>-homomorphisms and the category <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> of [[algebraic lattice]]s with [[compact element|compactness]]-preserving complete join-homomorphisms, as follows. With a join-semilattice <math>S</math> with zero, we associate its ideal lattice <math>\\operatorname{Id}\\ S</math>. With a <math>(\\vee,0)</math>-homomorphism <math>f \\colon S \\to T</math> of <math>(\\vee,0)</math>-semilattices, we associate the map <math>\\operatorname{Id}\\ f \\colon \\operatorname{Id}\\ S \\to \\operatorname{Id}\\ T</math>, that with any ideal <math>I</math> of <math>S</math> associates the ideal of <math>T</math> generated by <math>f(I)</math>. This defines a functor <math>\\operatorname{Id} \\colon \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathcal{A}</math>. Conversely, with every algebraic lattice <math>A</math> we associate the <math>(\\vee,0)</math>-semilattice <math>K(A)</math> of all [[compact element]]s of <math>A</math>, and with every compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphism <math>f \\colon A \\to B</math> between algebraic lattices we associate the restriction <math>K(f) \\colon K(A) \\to K(B)</math>. This defines a functor <math>K \\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{S}</math>. The pair <math>(\\operatorname{Id},K)</math> defines a category equivalence between <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.\n\n== Distributive semilattices ==\nSurprisingly, there is a notion of \"distributivity\" applicable to semilattices, even though distributivity conventionally requires the interaction of two binary operations. This notion requires but a single operation, and generalizes the distributivity condition for lattices. A join-semilattice is '''distributive''' if for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''x'' with {{nowrap|''x'' &le; ''a'' &or; ''b''}} there exist {{nowrap|''a' '' &le; ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''b' '' &le; ''b''}} such that {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = ''a' '' &or; ''b' ''.{{nowrap end}} Distributive meet-semilattices are defined dually. These definitions are justified by the fact that any distributive join-semilattice in which binary meets exist is a distributive lattice. See the entry [[distributivity (order theory)]].\n\nA join-semilattice is distributive if and only if the lattice of its [[ideal (order theory)|ideals]] (under inclusion) is distributive.\n\n== Complete semilattices ==\nNowadays, the term \"complete semilattice\" has no generally accepted meaning, and various inconsistent definitions exist. If completeness is taken to require the existence of all infinite joins, or all infinite meets, whichever the case may be, as well as finite ones, this immediately leads to partial orders that are in fact [[complete lattice]]s. For why the existence of all possible infinite joins entails the existence of all possible infinite meets (and vice versa), see the entry [[completeness (order theory)]].\n\nNevertheless, the literature on occasion still takes complete join- or meet-semilattices to be complete lattices. In this case, \"completeness\" denotes a restriction on the scope of the [[homomorphism]]s. Specifically, a complete join-semilattice requires that the homomorphisms preserve all joins, but contrary to the situation we find for completeness properties, this does not require that homomorphisms preserve all meets. On the other hand, we can conclude that every such mapping is the lower adjoint of some [[Galois connection]]. The corresponding (unique) upper adjoint will then be a homomorphism of complete meet-semilattices. This gives rise to a number of useful [[duality (category theory)|categorical dualities]] between the categories of all complete semilattices with morphisms preserving all meets or joins, respectively.\n\nAnother usage of \"complete meet-semilattice\" refers to a [[bounded complete]] [[Complete partial order|cpo]]. A complete meet-semilattice in this sense is arguably the \"most complete\" meet-semilattice that is not necessarily a complete lattice. Indeed, a complete meet-semilattice has all ''non-empty'' meets (which is equivalent to being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. Thus a complete semilattice turns out to be \"a complete lattice possibly lacking a top\". This definition is of interest specifically in [[domain theory]], where bounded complete [[algebraic poset|algebraic]] cpos are studied as [[Scott domain]]s. Hence Scott domains have been called ''algebraic semilattices''.\n\nCardinality-restricted notions of completeness for semilattices have been rarely considered in the literature.<ref>E. G. Manes, ''Algebraic theories'', Graduate Texts in Mathematics Volume 26, Springer 1976, p. 57</ref><ref>[http://planetmath.org/completesemilattice complete semilattices] on Planetmath.org</ref>\n\n== Free semilattices ==\n\nThis section presupposes some knowledge of [[category theory]]. In various situations, [[free object|free]] semilattices exist. For example, the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of join-semilattices (and their homomorphisms) to the [[category theory|category]] of sets (and functions) admits a [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]]. Therefore, the free join-semilattice '''F'''(''S'') over a set ''S'' is constructed by taking the collection of all non-empty ''finite'' [[subset]]s of ''S'', ordered by subset inclusion. Clearly, ''S'' can be embedded into '''F'''(''S'') by a mapping ''e'' that takes any element ''s'' in ''S'' to the singleton set {''s''}. Then any function ''f'' from a ''S'' to a join-semilattice ''T'' (more formally, to the underlying set of ''T'') induces a unique homomorphism ''f' '' between the join-semilattices '''F'''(''S'') and ''T'', such that ''f'' = ''f' '' o ''e''. Explicitly, ''f' '' is given by ''f' ''(''A'') = <math>\\vee</math>{''f''(''s'') | ''s'' in ''A''}. Now the obvious uniqueness of ''f' '' suffices to obtain the required adjunction—the morphism-part of the functor '''F''' can be derived from general considerations (see [[adjoint functors]]). The case of free meet-semilattices is dual, using the opposite subset inclusion as an ordering. For join-semilattices with bottom, we just add the empty set to the above collection of subsets.\n\nIn addition, semilattices often serve as generators for free objects within other categories. Notably, both the forgetful functors from the category of [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] and frame-homomorphisms, and from the category of distributive lattices and lattice-homomorphisms, have a left adjoint.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Directed set]], generalization of join semilattice\n*[[List of order topics]]\n*[[Semiring]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Cite book |last1=Davey |first1=B.

Similarly, an [[order of operations]] is accepted, according to which &sdot; is applied before +; that is, {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bc''}} is {{nowrap|''a'' + (''bc'').}}\n\nCompared to a [[ring (algebra)|ring]], a semiring omits the requirement for inverses under addition; that is, it requires only a [[commutative monoid]], not a [[commutative group]]. In a ring, this implies the existence of a multiplicative zero, so here it must be specified explicitly. If a semiring's multiplication is [[commutative]], then it is called a '''commutative semiring'''.<ref name=LotIII212>Lothaire (2005) p.212</ref>\n\nThere are some authors who prefer to leave out the requirement that a semiring have a 0 or 1. This makes the analogy between ''[[ring (algebra)|ring]]'' and ''semiring'' on the one hand and ''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'' and ''[[semigroup]]'' on the other hand work more smoothly. These authors often use ''rig'' for the concept defined here.<ref group=\"note\">[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Rig For an example see the definition of rig on Proofwiki.org]</ref>\n\n== Theory ==\n\nMuch of the theory of rings continues to make sense when applied to arbitrary semirings{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.\nIn particular, one can generalise the theory of (associative) [[algebra (ring theory)|algebras]] over [[commutative ring]]s directly to a theory of algebras over commutative semirings.\nThen a ring is simply an algebra over the commutative semiring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s.\n\nA semiring in which every element is an additive [[idempotent]] (that is, ''a'' + ''a'' = ''a'' for all elements ''a'') is called an '''{{visible anchor|idempotent semiring}}'''.<ref name=Esik08/> Idempotent semirings are special to semiring theory as any ring which is idempotent under addition is [[Trivial ring|trivial]].<ref group=note>i.e. is a ring consisting of just one element.</ref> One can define a [[partial order]] &le; on an idempotent semiring by setting {{nowrap|''a'' &le; ''b''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b''}} (or, equivalently, if there exists an ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''x'' = ''b''}}). It is easy to see that 0 is the [[least element]] with respect to this order: {{nowrap|0 &le; ''a''}} for all ''a''. Addition and multiplication respect the ordering in the sense that {{nowrap|''a'' &le; ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|''ac'' &le; ''bc''}} and {{nowrap|''ca'' &le; ''cb''}} and {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'') &le; (''b'' + ''c'')}}.\n\n=== Applications ===\n\nThe {{nowrap|(max, +)}} and {{nowrap|(min, +)}} [[tropical semiring]]s on the reals, are often used in [[performance evaluation]] on discrete event systems. The real numbers then are the \"costs\" or \"arrival time\"; the \"max\" operation corresponds to having to wait for all prerequisites of an events (thus taking the maximal time) while the \"min\" operation corresponds to being able to choose the best, less costly choice; and + corresponds to accumulation along the same path.\n\nThe [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] for [[shortest path]]s can thus be reformulated as a computation over a {{nowrap|(min, +)}} algebra.  Similarly, the [[Viterbi algorithm]] for finding the most probable state sequence corresponding to an observation sequence in a [[Hidden Markov model]] can also be formulated as a computation over a {{nowrap|(max, ×)}} algebra on probabilities.  These [[dynamic programming]] algorithms rely on the [[distributive property]] of their associated semirings to compute quantities over a large (possibly exponential) number of terms more efficiently than enumerating each of them.<ref name=\"Pair1966\">\n{{citation\n | first = Claude | last = Pair\n | chapter =  Sur des algorithmes pour des problèmes de cheminement dans les graphes finis (On algorithms for path problems in finite graphs)\n | title = Théorie des graphes (journées internationales d'études) -- Theory of Graphs (international symposium)\n | publisher = Dunod (Paris) et  Gordon and Breach (New York)\n | date = 1967\n | location = Rome (Italy), July 1966\n | page  = 271\n | editor = Rosentiehl\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{citation\n | first1 = Jean Claude | last1 = Derniame\n | first2 = Claude | last2 = Pair\n | title = Problèmes de cheminement dans les graphes (Path Problems in Graphs)\n | publisher = Dunod (Paris)\n | year = 1971\n}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\nBy definition, any ring is also a semiring. A motivating example of a semiring is the set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' (including [[0 (number)|zero]]) under ordinary addition and multiplication. Likewise, the non-negative [[rational number]]s and the non-negative [[real number]]s form semirings.

An example of a semiring of sets is the collection of half-open, half-closed real [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] <math>[a,b) \\subset \\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\n===Specific examples===\n{{unordered list\n| The (non-negative) [[positional notation#Terminating fractions|''terminating fractions'']] <math>\\frac{\\N_0}{b^{\\N_0}} := \\left\\{mb^{-n} \\mid m, n \\in \\N_0 \\right\\}</math> in a [[positional notation|positional number system]] to a given base <math>b\\in \\N</math>.

For example, the matrices with non-negative entries, <math>M_n(\\N)</math>, form a matrix semiring.<ref name=Gut08/>\n| If ''A'' is a commutative monoid, the set End(''A'') of [[endomorphism]]s {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} almost forms a semiring, where addition is pointwise addition and multiplication is [[function composition]]. The [[zero morphism]] and the identity are the respective neutral elements. This is not a true semiring because composition does not distribute on the left over pointwise addition: {{nowrap|''a''{{Thin space}}·{{Thin space}}(''b''+''c'') ≠ (''a''·''b'') + (''a''·''c'')}}. If ''A'' is the additive monoid of natural numbers we obtain the semiring of natural numbers as End(''A''), and if {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''S''<sup>''n''</sup>}} with ''S'' a semiring, we obtain (after associating each morphism to a matrix) the semiring of square ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with coefficients in ''S''.\n| The '''{{visible anchor|Boolean semiring}}''' is the commutative semiring '''B''' formed by the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] and defined by {{nowrap|1=1 + 1 = 1}}.<ref name=LotIII211/><ref name=Sak28/><ref name=BR4>Berstel & Reutenauer (2011) p.&nbsp;4</ref> It is idempotent<ref name=Esik08/> and is the simplest example of a semiring that is not a ring. Given two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', [[binary relation]]s between ''X'' and ''Y'' correspond to matrices indexed by ''X'' and ''Y'' with entries in the Boolean semiring, [[matrix addition]] corresponds to union of relations, and [[matrix multiplication]] corresponds to [[composition of relations]].<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=quantum mechanics over a commutative rig |author=[[John C.

In fact, this is the [[free object|free]] commutative semiring on a single generator {''x''}.\n| [[Tropical semiring]]s are variously defined.  The ''max-plus'' semiring '''R''' &cup; {−∞} is a commutative, idempotent semiring with {{nowrap|max(''a'', ''b'')}} serving as semiring addition (identity −∞) and ordinary addition (identity 0) serving as semiring multiplication.  In an alternative formulation, the tropical semiring is {{nowrap|'''R''' &cup; {∞},}} and min replaces max as the addition operation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Speyer |first=David |last2=Sturmfels |first2=Bernd | author2-link=Bernd Sturmfels | arxiv=math/0408099 |title=Tropical Mathematics | origyear=2004 | year= 2009 | zbl=1227.14051 | journal=Math.

Such structures are called ''hemirings''<ref>Jonathan S. Golan, ''Semirings and their applications'', Chapter 1, p1</ref> or ''pre-semirings''.<ref>Michel Gondran, Michel Minoux, ''Graphs, Dioids, and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms'', Chapter 1, Section 4.2, p22</ref> A further generalization are ''left-pre-semirings'',<ref>Michel Gondran, Michel Minoux, ''Graphs, Dioids, and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms'', Chapter 1, Section 4.1, p20</ref> which additionally do not require right-distributivity (or ''right-pre-semirings'', which do not require left-distributivity).\n\nYet a further generalization are ''[[near-semiring]]s'': in addition to not requiring a neutral element for product, or right-distributivity (or left-distributivity), they do not require addition to be commutative. Just as cardinal numbers form a (class) semiring, so do [[ordinal number]]s form a [[near-ring]], when the standard [[Ordinal arithmetic|ordinal addition and multiplication]] are taken into account. However, the class of ordinals can be turned into a semiring by considering the so-called [[Ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural (or Hessenberg) operations]] instead.\n\nIn [[category theory]], a ''2-rig'' is a category with [[functor]]ial operations analogous to those of a rig. That the cardinal numbers form a rig can be categorified to say that the [[category of sets]] (or more generally, any [[topos]]) is a 2-rig.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ring of sets]]\n*[[Valuation algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citation | first1 = Jean Claude | last1 = Derniame| first2 = Claude | last2 = Pair| title = Problèmes de cheminement dans les graphes (Path Problems in Graphs)| publisher = Dunod (Paris)| year = 1971}}\n* [[François Baccelli]], Guy Cohen, Geert Jan Olsder, Jean-Pierre Quadrat, ''[http://cermics.enpc.fr/~cohen-g//SED/book-online.html Synchronization and Linearity (online version)]'', Wiley, 1992, {{isbn|0-471-93609-X}}\n* Golan, Jonathan S., ''Semirings and their applications''.

      "text": "In algebra, a '''simplicial commutative ring''' is a commutative [[monoid]] in the category of [[simplicial abelian group]]s, or, equivalently, a [[simplicial object]] in the category of commutative rings. If ''A'' is a simplicial commutative ring, then it can be shown that <math>\\pi_0 A</math> is a commutative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and <math>\\pi_i A</math> are modules over that ring (in fact, <math>\\pi_* A</math> is a [[graded ring]] over <math>\\pi_0 A</math>.)\n\nA topology-counterpart of this notion is a [[commutative ring spectrum]].\n\n== Graded ring structure ==\nLet ''A'' be a simplicial commutative ring. Then the ring structure of ''A'' gives <math>\\pi_* A = \\oplus_{i \\ge 0} \\pi_i A</math> the structure of a graded-commutative graded ring as follows.\n\nBy the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]], <math>\\pi_* A</math> is the homology of the chain complex corresponding to ''A''; in particular, it is a graded abelian group. Next, to multiply two elements, writing <math>S^1</math> for the [[simplicial circle]], let <math>x:(S^1)^{\\wedge i} \\to A, \\, \\, y:(S^1)^{\\wedge j} \\to A</math> be two maps. Then the composition\n:<math>(S^1)^{\\wedge i} \\times (S^1)^{\\wedge j} \\to A \\times A \\to A</math>,\nthe second map the multiplication of ''A'', induces <math>(S^1)^{\\wedge i} \\wedge (S^1)^{\\wedge j} \\to A</math>. This in turn gives an element in <math>\\pi_{i + j} A</math>. We have thus defined the graded multiplication <math>\\pi_i A \\times \\pi_j A \\to \\pi_{i + j} A</math>. It is associative since the smash product is. It is graded-commutative (i.e., <math>xy = (-1)^{|x||y|} yx</math>) since the involution <math>S^1 \\wedge S^1 \\to S^1 \\wedge S^1</math> introduces minus sign.\n\nIf ''M'' is a simplicial module over ''A'' (that is, ''M'' is a [[simplicial abelian group]] with an action of ''A''), then the similar argument shows that <math>\\pi_* M </math> has the structure of a graded module over <math>\\pi_* A</math>. (cf. [[module spectrum]].)\n\n== Spec ==\nBy definition, the category of affine [[derived scheme]]s is the opposite category of the category of simplicial commutative rings; an object corresponding to ''A'' will be denoted by <math>\\operatorname{Spec} A</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[En-ring]]\n\n== References ==\n*http://mathoverflow.net/questions/118500/what-is-a-simplicial-commutative-ring-from-the-point-of-view-of-homotopy-theory/\n*http://mathoverflow.net/questions/45273/what-facts-in-commutative-algebra-fail-miserably-for-simplicial-commutative-ring\n*http://mathoverflow.net/questions/94846/reference-request-cdga-vs-salg-in-char-0\n*A.

      "title": "Special classes of semigroups",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_classes_of_semigroups",
      "text": "{{Cleanup|reason=various, see talk|date=October 2012}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[semigroup]] is a [[nonempty set]] together with an [[associative]] [[binary operation]]. A '''special class of semigroups'''  is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[semigroup]]s satisfying additional [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or conditions. Thus the class of [[commutative]] semigroups consists of all those semigroups in which the binary operation satisfies the commutativity property that ''ab'' = ''ba'' for all elements ''a'' and ''b'' in the semigroup.\nThe class of [[Finite set|finite]] semigroups consists of those semigroups for which the [[underlying set]] has finite [[cardinality]]. Members of the class of [[Brandt semigroup]]s are required to satisfy not just one condition but a set of additional properties. A large collection of special classes of semigroups have been defined though not all of them have been studied equally intensively.\n\nIn the [[algebra]]ic [[theory]] of semigroups, in constructing special classes, attention is focused only on those properties, restrictions and conditions which can be expressed in terms of the binary operations in the semigroups and occasionally on the cardinality and similar properties of [[subset]]s of the [[underlying set]].  The underlying [[set (mathematics)|sets]] are not assumed to carry any other mathematical [[structure]]s like [[Partial order|order]] or [[topology]].\n\nAs in any algebraic theory,  one of the main problems of the theory of semigroups is the [[classification theorems|classification]] of all semigroups and a complete description of their structure. In the case of semigroups, since the binary operation is required to satisfy only the associativity property the problem of classification is considered extremely difficult. Descriptions of structures have been obtained for certain special classes of semigroups. For example, the structure of the sets of idempotents of regular semigroups is completely known. Structure descriptions are presented in terms of better known types of semigroups. The best known type of semigroup is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]].\n\nA (necessarily incomplete) list of various special classes of semigroups is presented below. To the extent possible the defining properties are formulated in terms of the binary operations in the semigroups. The references point to the locations from where the defining properties are sourced.\n\n== Notations ==\n\nIn describing the defining properties of the various special classes of semigroups, the following notational conventions are adopted.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Notations\n|-\n!

      "text": "{{Multiple issues|{{more citations needed|date=April 2018}}{{more footnotes|date=April 2018}}}}\n\n{{expert needed|Mathematics|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn mathematics, and more precisely in [[semigroup]] theory, a '''variety of finite semigroups''' is a set of semigroups having some nice algebraic properties. Those sets can be defined in two distinct way, using either algebraic notions or topological notions.  Varieties of finite [[monoid]]s, varieties of finite [[ordered semigroup]]s and varieties of finite [[ordered monoid]]s are defined similarly.\n\nThis notion is very similar to the general notion of [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] in universal algebra.\n\n== Definition ==\nTwo equivalent definitions are now given.\n\n=== Algebraic definition ===\nA variety ''V'' of finite (ordered) semigroups  is a set of finite (ordered) semigroups which:\n*is closed under [[Semigroup#Quotients and divisions|division]]. \n*is closed under taking finite Cartesian products.\n\nThe first condition is equivalent to stating that ''V'' is closed under taking subsemigroups and under taking quotients. The second property implies that the empty product—that is, the trivial semigroup of one element—belongs to each variety. Hence a variety is necessarily non-empty.\n\nA variety of finite (ordered) monoids is a variety of finite (ordered) semigroups whose elements are monoids. That is, it is a set of (ordered) monoids satisfying the two conditions stated above.\n\n=== Topological definition ===\nIn order to give the topological definition of a variety of finite semigroups, some other definitions related to [[profinite word]]s are needed.\n\nLet ''A'' be an arbitrary finite [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. Let ''A''<sup>+</sup> be its [[free semigroup]].  Then let <math>\\hat A</math> be the set of [[profinite word]]s. Given a semigroup [[morphism]] <math>\\phi:A^+\\to S</math>, let <math>\\hat\\phi:\\hat A\\to S</math> be the unique continuous extension of <math>\\phi</math> to <math>\\hat A</math>.\n\nA profinite identity is a pair ''u'' and ''v'' of profinite words.  A semigroup ''S'' is said to satisfy the profinite identity ''u'' = ''v'' if, for each semigroup morphism <math>\\phi:A^+\\to S</math>, the equality <math>\\hat\\phi(u)=\\hat\\phi(v)</math> holds.\n\nA variety of finite semigroup is the set of finite semigroups satisfying a set of profinite identities ''P''.\n\nA variety of finite monoids is defined like a variety of finite semigroups, with the difference that one should consider monoid morphisms <math>\\phi:A^*\\to M</math> instead of semigroup morphisms <math>\\phi:A^+\\to\\phi</math>.\n\nA variety of finite ordered semigroups/monoids is also given by a similar definition, with the difference that one should consider morphisms of ordered semigroups/monoids.\n\n== Examples ==\nA few examples of sets of semigroups are given. The first examples uses finite identities—that is, profinite identities whose two words are finite words. The next example uses profinite identities. The last one is an example of set that is not a variety.\n\nMore examples are given in the article [[Special classes of semigroups]].\n\n=== Using finite identities ===\n*The most trivial example is the variety '''S''' of all finite semigroups. This variety is defined by the empty set of profinite equalities. It is trivial to see that this set of finite semigroups is closed under finite product and quotient.\n*The second most trivial example is the variety '''1''' containing only the trivial semigroup. This variety is defined by the set of profinite equalities {''x'' = ''y''}. Intuitively, this equality states that all elements of the semigroup are equal.  This set is vacuously closed under finite products and under quotients.\n*The variety '''Com''' of  commutative finite semigroups is defined by the profinite equality ''xy'' = ''yx''. Intuitively, this equality states that each pair of elements of the semigroup commutes.\n*The variety of idempotent finite semigroups is defined by the profinite equality ''xx'' = ''x''.\n\nMore generally, given a profinite word ''u'' and a letter ''x'', the profinite equality ''ux'' = ''xu'' states that the images of ''u'' contains only elements of the centralizer. Similarly, ''ux'' = ''x'' states that the image of ''u'' contains left identities. Finally ''ux'' = ''u'' states that  the image of ''u'' is composed of left zeros.\n\n=== Using profinite identities ===\nExamples using profinite words that are not finite are now given.\n\nGiven a profinite word, ''x'', let  <math>x^\\omega</math> denote <math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^{n!}</math>. Hence, given a semigroup morphism <math>\\phi:A^+\\to S</math>, <math>\\hat\\phi(x^\\omega)</math> is the only idempotent power of <math>\\phi(x)</math>.  Thus, in profinite equalities, <math>x^\\omega</math> represents an arbitrary idempotent.\n\nThe set of finite semigroups  is a variety, called '''G'''. Note that a finite group can be defined as a finite semigroup, with a unique idempotent that is a left and right identity. Once those two properties are translated in terms of profinite equality, one can see that the variety ''G''  is defined by the set of profinite equalities <math> \\{ x^\\omega=y^\\omega \\text{ and } x^\\omega y=yx^\\omega=y\\}.</math>\n\n=== Sets that are not varieties ===\nNote that the set of finite monoids is not a variety of finite semigroups. Indeed, this set is not closed under quotient. For example, takes the monoid of non-negative numbers with addition.  The set of positive numbers with addition is a semigroup quotient of this monoid and it is not a monoid.\n\n== Reiterman's theorem ==\n\nReiterman's theorem states that the two definitions above are equivalent. A scheme of the proof is now given.\n\nGiven a variety  ''V'' of semigroups as in the algebraic definition, one can choose the set ''P'' of profinite identities to be the set of profinite identities satisfied by every semigroup of ''V''.\n\nReciprocally, given a profinite identity ''u'' = ''v'', one can remark that the set of semigroups satisfying this profinite identity is closed under quotients and finite products. Thus this set is a variety of finite semigroups. Furthermore, varieties are closed under arbitrary intersection, thus, given an arbitrary set ''P'' of profinite identities ''u<sup>i</sup>'' = ''v<sup>i</sup>'', the set of semigroups satisfying ''P'' is the intersection of the set of semigroups satisfying all of those profinite identities. That is, it is an intersection of varieties of finite semigroups, and this a variety of finite semigroups.\n\n==Comparison with the notion of variety of universal algebra==\nThe definition of a variety of finite semigroups is inspired by the notion of a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety of universal algebra]]s. We recall the definition of a variety in universal algebra. Such a variety is, equivalently:\n*a set of structure, closed under [[homomorphism|homomorphic]] images, [[subalgebra]]s and [[Direct product#Direct product in universal algebra|(direct) products]].\n*a set of structures satisfying a set of [[mathematical identity|identities]].\n\nThe main differences between the two notions of variety are now given. In this section \"variety of (arbitrary) semigroups\" means \"the set of semigroups as a variety of universal algebra over the vocabulary of one binary operator\". It follows from the definitions of those two kind of varieties that, for any variety ''V'' of (arbitrary) semigroups, the set of finite semigroups of ''V'' is a variety of finite semigroups.\n\nWe first give an example of a variety of finite semigroups that is not similar to any subvariety of the variety of (arbitrary) semigroups. We then give the difference between the two definition using identities. Finally, we give the difference between the algebraic definitions.\n\nAs shown above, the set of finite groups is a variety of finite semigroups. However, the set of group is not a subvariety of the variety of (arbitrary) semigroups. Indeed, <math>\\langle\\mathbb Z,+\\rangle</math> is a monoid which is an infinite group. However, its submonoid <math>\\langle\\mathbb N,+\\rangle</math> is not a group. Since the set of (arbitrary) groups contains a semigroup and does not contain one of its subsemigroups, it is not a variety. The main difference between the finite case and the infinite case, when groups are considered, is that a submonoid of a finite group is a finite group. While infinite groups are not closed under taking submonoids.\n\nThe set of finite groups is a variety of finite semigroups, while it is not a subvariety of the variety of (arbitrary) semigroups. Thus, Reiterman's theorem shows that this set can be defined using profinite identities. And [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] shows that this set can not be defined using identities (of finite words). This illustrates why the definition of a variety of finite semigroups uses the notion of profinite words and not the notion of identities.\n\nWe now consider the algebraic definitions of varieties. Requiring that varieties are closed under arbitrary direct products implies that a variety is either trivial or contains infinite structures. In order to restrict varieties to contain only finite structures, the definition of variety of finite semigroups uses the notion of finite product instead of notion of arbitrary direct product.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite book|last1=Pin|first1=Jean-Éric|title=Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory|date=2016-11-30|pages=141–160|url=http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~jep/PDF/MPRI/MPRI.pdf}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Pin|first1=Jean-Éric|title=Varieties of formal language|date=1986|publisher=Plenum Publishing Corp.|location=New York}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Eilenberg|first1=S|title=Automata, languages, and machines|date=1976|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Publishers|location=New york|pages=chapters \"Depth decomposition theorem” and “Complexity of semigroups and morphisms”}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Almeida|first1=J|title=Finite semigroups and universal algebra|date=1994|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.

      "text": "{{Algebraic structures |Algebra}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''algebra over a field''' (often simply called an '''algebra''') is a [[vector space]] equipped with a [[bilinear map|bilinear]] [[product (mathematics)|product]]. Thus, an algebra is an [[algebraic structure]], which consists of a [[set (mathematics)|set]], together with operations of multiplication, addition, and [[scalar multiplication]] by elements of the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]], and satisfies the axioms implied by \"vector space\" and \"bilinear\".<ref>See also {{cite book|author=Hazewinkel|title=Algebras, rings and modules|volume=1|year=2004|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=AibpdVNkFDYC|page=3|text=an algebra over a field k}}|page=3|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe multiplication operation in an algebra may or may not be [[associative]], leading to the notions of [[associative algebra]]s and [[nonassociative algebra]]s. Given an integer ''n'', the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[real matrix|real]] [[square matrix|square matrices]] of order ''n'' is an example of an associative algebra over the field of [[real number]]s under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]] since matrix multiplication is associative. Three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] with multiplication given by the [[vector cross product]] is an example of a nonassociative algebra over the field of real numbers since the vector cross product is nonassociative, satisfying the [[Jacobi identity]] instead.\n\nAn algebra is '''unital''' or '''unitary''' if it has an [[identity element]] with respect to the multiplication. The ring of real square matrices of order ''n'' forms a unital algebra since the [[identity matrix]] of order ''n'' is the identity element with respect to matrix multiplication. It is an example of a unital associative algebra, a [[unital ring|(unital) ring]] that is also a vector space.\n\nMany authors use the term ''algebra'' to mean ''associative algebra'', or ''unital associative algebra'', or in  some subjects such as [[algebraic geometry]], ''unital associative commutative algebra''.\n\nReplacing the field of scalars by a [[commutative ring]] leads to the more general notion of an [[#Generalization: algebra over a ring|algebra over a ring]]. Algebras are not to be confused with vector spaces equipped with a [[bilinear form]], like [[inner product space]]s, as, for such a space, the result of a product is not in the space, but rather in the field of coefficients.\n\n== Definition and motivation ==\n===First example: The complex numbers ===\nAny [[complex number]] may be written ''a'' + ''bi'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[real number]]s and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. In other words, a complex number is represented by the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] (''a'', ''b'') over the field of real numbers. So the complex numbers form a two-dimensional real vector space, where addition is given by (''a'', ''b'') + (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'') and scalar multiplication is given by ''c''(''a'', ''b'') = (''ca'', ''cb''), where all of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are real numbers. We use the symbol · to multiply two vectors together, which we use complex multiplication to define: (''a'', ''b'') · (''c'', ''d'') = (''ac'' − ''bd'', ''ad'' + ''bc'').\n\nThe following statements are basic properties of the complex numbers. If '''x''', '''y''', '''z''' are complex numbers and ''a,'' ''b'' are real numbers, then\n\n:* ('''x''' + '''y''') · '''z''' = ('''x''' · '''z''') + ('''y''' · '''z'''). In other words, multiplying a complex number by the sum of two other complex numbers, is the same as multiplying by each number in the sum, and then adding.\n:* (''a'''''x''') · (''b'''''y''') = (''ab'') ('''x''' · '''y'''). This shows that complex multiplication is compatible with the scalar multiplication by the real numbers.\n\nThis example fits into the following definition by taking the field ''K'' to be the real numbers, and the vector space ''A'' to be the complex numbers.\n\n=== Definition ===\nLet ''K'' be a field, and let ''A'' be a [[vector space]] over ''K'' equipped with an additional [[binary operation]] from ''A'' &times; ''A'' to ''A'', denoted here by · (i.e. if '''x''' and '''y''' are any two elements of ''A'', '''x''' · '''y''' is the ''product'' of '''x''' and '''y''').  Then ''A'' is an '''algebra''' over ''K'' if the following identities hold for all elements '''x''', '''y''', and '''z''' of ''A'', and all elements (often called [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s) ''a'' and ''b'' of ''K'':\n* Right [[distributivity]]: ('''x''' + '''y''') · '''z''' = '''x''' · '''z''' + '''y''' · '''z'''\n* Left distributivity: '''x''' · ('''y''' + '''z''') = '''x''' · '''y''' + '''x''' · '''z'''\n* Compatibility with scalars: (''a'''''x''') · (''b'''''y''') = (''ab'') ('''x''' · '''y''').\n\nThese three axioms are another way of saying that the binary operation is [[bilinear operator|bilinear]]. An algebra over ''K'' is sometimes also called a ''K-algebra'', and ''K'' is called the ''base field'' of ''A''. The binary operation is often referred to as ''multiplication'' in ''A''. The convention adopted in this article is that multiplication of elements of an algebra is not necessarily [[associativity|associative]], although some authors use the term ''algebra'' to refer to an [[associative algebra]].\n\nNotice that when a binary operation on a vector space is [[commutative]], as in the above example of the complex numbers, it is left distributive exactly when it is right distributive. But in general, for non-commutative operations (such as the next example of the quaternions), they are not equivalent, and therefore require separate axioms.\n\n=== A motivating example: quaternions ===\n{{main|Quaternion}}\nThe [[real numbers]] may be viewed as a ''one''-dimensional vector space with a compatible multiplication, and hence a one-dimensional algebra over itself. Likewise, as we saw above, the complex numbers form a ''two''-dimensional vector space over the field of real numbers, and hence form a two dimensional algebra over the reals. In both these examples, every [[null vector|non-zero vector]] has an [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]], making them both [[division algebras]]. \nAlthough there are no division algebras in 3 dimensions, in 1843, the [[quaternions]] were defined and provided the now famous 4-dimensional example of an algebra over the real numbers, where one can not only multiply vectors, but also divide. Any quaternion may be written as (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') = ''a'' + ''b'''''i''' + ''c'''''j''' + ''d'''''k'''. Unlike the complex numbers, the quaternions are an example of a [[Commutativity|non-commutative]] algebra: for instance, (0,1,0,0) · (0,0,1,0) = (0,0,0,1) but (0,0,1,0) · (0,1,0,0) = (0,0,0,&minus;1).\n\nThe quaternions were soon followed by several other [[hypercomplex number]] systems, which were the early examples of algebras over a field.\n\n===Another motivating example: the cross product===\n{{main|Cross product}}\nThe previous examples are associative algebras. An example of a [[non-associative algebra]] is a three dimensional vector space equipped with the [[cross product]]. This is a simple example of a class of nonassociative algebras, which is widely used in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the [[Lie algebra]]s.\n\n== Basic concepts ==\n\n=== Algebra homomorphisms ===\n{{main|Algebra homomorphism}}\nGiven ''K''-algebras ''A'' and ''B'', a ''K''-algebra [[homomorphism]] is a ''K''-[[linear map]] ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' such that ''f''('''xy''') = ''f''('''x''') ''f''('''y''') for all '''x''', '''y''' in ''A''. The space of all ''K''-algebra homomorphisms between ''A'' and ''B'' is frequently written as\n:<math>\\mathbf{Hom}_{K\\text{-alg}} (A,B).</math>\nA ''K''-algebra [[isomorphism]] is a [[bijective]] ''K''-algebra homomorphism. For all practical purposes, isomorphic algebras differ only by notation.\n\n=== Subalgebras and ideals ===\n{{main|Substructure (mathematics)}}\nA ''subalgebra'' of an algebra over a field ''K'' is a [[linear subspace]] that has the property that the product of any two of its elements is again in the subspace. In other words, a subalgebra of an algebra is a subset of elements that is closed under addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication. In symbols, we say that a subset ''L'' of a ''K''-algebra ''A'' is a subalgebra if for every ''x'', ''y'' in ''L'' and ''c'' in ''K'', we have that ''x'' · ''y'', ''x'' + ''y'', and ''cx'' are all in ''L''.\n\nIn the above example of the complex numbers viewed as a two-dimensional algebra over the real numbers, the one-dimensional real line is a subalgebra.\n\nA ''left ideal'' of a ''K''-algebra is a linear subspace that has the property that any element of the subspace multiplied on the left by any element of the algebra produces an element of the subspace. In symbols, we say that a subset ''L'' of a ''K''-algebra ''A'' is a left ideal if for every ''x'' and ''y'' in ''L'', ''z'' in ''A'' and ''c'' in ''K'', we have the following three statements.\n*1)  ''x'' + ''y'' is in ''L'' (''L'' is closed under addition),\n*2)  ''cx'' is in ''L'' (''L'' is closed under scalar multiplication),\n*3)  ''z'' · ''x'' is in ''L'' (''L'' is closed under left multiplication by arbitrary elements).\n\nIf (3) were replaced with ''x'' · ''z'' is in ''L'', then this would define a ''right ideal''. A ''two-sided ideal'' is a subset that is both a left and a right ideal. The term ''ideal'' on its own is usually taken to mean a two-sided ideal. Of course when the algebra is commutative, then all of these notions of ideal are equivalent. Notice that conditions (1) and (2) together are equivalent to ''L'' being a linear subspace of ''A''. It follows from condition (3) that every left or right ideal is a subalgebra.\n\nIt is important to notice that this definition is different from the definition of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal of a ring]], in that here we require the condition (2). Of course if the algebra is unital, then condition (3) implies condition (2).\n\n=== Extension of scalars ===\n{{main|Extension of scalars}}\nIf we have a [[field extension]] ''F''/''K'', which is to say a bigger field ''F'' that contains ''K'', then there is a natural way to construct an algebra over ''F'' from any algebra over ''K''. It is the same construction one uses to make a vector space over a bigger field, namely the tensor product <math> V_F:=V \\otimes_K F </math>. So if ''A'' is an algebra over ''K'', then <math>A_F</math> is an algebra over ''F''.\n\n== Kinds of algebras and examples ==\n\nAlgebras over fields come in many different types. These types are specified by insisting on some further axioms, such as [[commutativity]] or [[associativity]] of the multiplication operation, which are not required in the broad definition of an algebra. The theories corresponding to the different types of algebras are often very different.\n\n=== Unital algebra ===\n\nAn algebra is ''unital'' or ''unitary'' if it has a [[Unit (algebra)|unit]] or identity element ''I'' with ''Ix'' = ''x'' = ''xI'' for all ''x'' in the algebra.\n\n=== Zero algebra ===\n\n<!--The term '''zero algebra''' may have other uses outside ring theory-->\nAn algebra is called '''zero algebra''' if {{nowrap|1=''uv'' = 0}} for all ''u'', ''v'' in the algebra,<ref>João B. Prolla, ''Approximation of vector valued functions'', Elsevier, 1977, p. 65</ref> not to be confused with the algebra with one element.  It is inherently non-unital (except in the case of only one element), associative and commutative.\n\nOne may define a '''unital zero algebra''' by taking the [[direct sum of modules]] of a field (or more generally a ring) ''K'' and a ''K''-vector space (or module) ''V'', and defining the product of every pair of elements of ''V'' to be zero. That is, if {{nowrap|''λ'', ''μ'' ∈ ''K''}} and {{nowrap|''u'', ''v'' ∈ ''V''}}, then {{nowrap|1=(''λ'' + ''u'') (''μ'' + ''v'') = ''λμ'' + (''λv'' + ''μu'')}}. If {{nowrap|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ... ''e''<sub>''d''</sub>}} is a basis of ''V'', the unital zero algebra is the quotient of the polynomial ring {{nowrap|''K''[''E''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''E''<sub>''n''</sub>]}} by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>''E''<sub>''j''</sub> for every pair {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')}}.\n\nAn example of unital zero algebra is the algebra of [[dual number]]s, the unital zero '''R'''-algebra built from a one dimensional real vector space.\n\nThese unital zero algebras may be more generally useful, as they allow to translate any general property of the algebras to properties of vector spaces or [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. For example, the theory of [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]] was introduced by [[Bruno Buchberger]] for [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in a polynomial ring {{nowrap|1=''R'' = ''K''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}} over a field. The construction of the unital zero algebra over a free ''R''-module allows extending this theory as a Gröbner basis theory for submodules of a free module. This extension allows, for computing a Gröbner basis of a submodule, to use, without any modification, any algorithm and any software for computing Gröbner bases of ideals.\n\n=== Associative algebra ===\n\n{{main|Associative algebra}}\nExamples of associative algebras include\n* the algebra of all ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over a field (or commutative ring) ''K''. Here the multiplication is ordinary [[matrix multiplication]].\n* [[Group algebra]]s, where a [[group (mathematics)|group]] serves as a basis of the vector space and algebra multiplication extends group multiplication.\n* the commutative algebra ''K''[''x''] of all [[polynomial]]s over ''K'' (see [[polynomial ring]]).\n* algebras of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, such as the '''R'''-algebra of all real-valued [[continuous function|continuous]] functions defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1], or the '''C'''-algebra of all [[holomorphic function]]s defined on some fixed open set in the [[complex plane]]. These are also commutative.\n* [[Incidence algebra]]s are built on certain [[partially ordered set]]s.\n* algebras of [[linear operator]]s, for example on a [[Hilbert space]]. Here the algebra multiplication is given by the [[functional composition|composition]] of operators. These algebras also carry a [[topological space|topology]]; many of them are defined on an underlying [[Banach space]], which turns them into [[Banach algebra]]s. If an involution is given as well, we obtain [[B*-algebra]]s and [[C*-algebra]]s. These are studied in [[functional analysis]].\n\n=== Non-associative algebra ===\n\n{{main|Non-associative algebra}}\n\nA ''non-associative algebra''<ref name=Schafer>Richard D. Schafer, ''An Introduction to Nonassociative Algebras'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-486-68813-5}} [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25156 Gutenberg eText]</ref> (or ''distributive algebra'') over a field ''K'' is a ''K''-vector space ''A'' equipped with a ''K''-[[bilinear map]] <math>A \\times A \\rightarrow A</math>. The usage of \"non-associative\" here is meant to convey that associativity is not assumed, but it does not mean it is prohibited. That is, it means \"not necessarily associative\".\n\nExamples detailed in the main article include:\n* [[Octonion]]s\n* [[Lie algebra]]s\n* [[Jordan algebra]]s \n* [[Alternative algebra]]s\n* [[Flexible algebra]]s\n* [[Power-associative algebra]]s\n\n==Algebras and rings==\nThe definition of an associative ''K''-algebra with unit is also frequently given in an alternative way. In this case, an algebra over a field ''K'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''A'' together with a [[ring homomorphism]]\n\n:<math>\\eta\\colon K\\to Z(A),</math>\n\nwhere ''Z''(''A'') is the [[center (ring theory)|center]] of ''A''. Since ''η'' is a ring homomorphism, then one must have either that ''A'' is the [[zero ring]], or that ''η'' is [[injective function|injective]].  This definition is equivalent to that above, with scalar multiplication\n:<math>K\\times A \\to A</math>\ngiven by\n:<math>(k,a) \\mapsto \\eta(k) a.</math>\nGiven two such associative unital ''K''-algebras ''A'' and ''B'', a unital ''K''-algebra homomorphism ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' is a ring homomorphism that commutes with the scalar multiplication defined by ''η'', which one may write as\n:<math>f(ka)=kf(a)</math>\nfor all <math>k\\in K</math> and <math>a \\in A</math>. In other words, the following diagram commutes:\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\n&& K &&   \\\\\n& \\eta_A \\swarrow & \\, & \\eta_B \\searrow & \\\\\nA &&  \\begin{matrix} f \\\\ \\longrightarrow \\end{matrix}  && B\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\n== Structure coefficients ==\n{{main|Structure constants}}\nFor algebras over a field, the bilinear multiplication from ''A'' &times; ''A'' to ''A'' is completely determined by the multiplication of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] elements of ''A''.\nConversely, once a basis for ''A'' has been chosen, the products of basis elements can be set arbitrarily, and then extended in a unique way to a bilinear operator on ''A'', i.e., so the resulting multiplication satisfies the algebra laws.\n\nThus, given the field ''K'', any finite-dimensional algebra can be specified [[up to]] [[isomorphism]] by giving its [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] (say ''n''), and specifying ''n''<sup>3</sup> ''structure coefficients'' ''c''<sub>''i'',''j'',''k''</sub>, which are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]].\nThese structure coefficients determine the multiplication in ''A'' via the following rule:\n: <math>\\mathbf{e}_{i} \\mathbf{e}_{j} = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_{i,j,k} \\mathbf{e}_{k}</math>\nwhere '''e'''<sub>1</sub>,...,'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> form a basis of ''A''.\n\nNote however that several different sets of structure coefficients can give rise to isomorphic algebras.\n\nIn [[mathematical physics]], the structure coefficients are generally written with upper and lower indices, so as to distinguish their transformation properties under coordinate transformations. Specifically, lower indices are [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] indices, and transform via [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]s, while upper indices are [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]], transforming under [[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]s. Thus, the structure coefficients are often written ''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub><sup>''k''</sup>, and their defining rule is written using the [[Einstein notation]] as\n: '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub>'''e'''<sub>''j''</sub> = ''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub><sup>''k''</sup>'''e'''<sub>''k''</sub>.\nIf you apply this to vectors written in [[index notation]], then this becomes\n: ('''xy''')<sup>''k''</sup> = ''c''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub><sup>''k''</sup>''x''<sup>''i''</sup>''y''<sup>''j''</sup>.\n\nIf ''K'' is only a commutative ring and not a field, then the same process works if ''A'' is a [[free module]] over ''K''. If it isn't, then the multiplication is still completely determined by its action on a set that spans ''A''; however, the structure constants can't be specified arbitrarily in this case, and knowing only the structure constants does not specify the algebra up to isomorphism.\n\n==Classification of low-dimensional algebras==\n\nTwo-dimensional, three-dimensional and four-dimensional unital associative algebras over the field of complex numbers were completely classified up to isomorphism by [[Eduard Study]].<ref>{{ citation | last=Study | first=E. | year=1890 | title=Über Systeme complexer Zahlen und ihre Anwendungen in der Theorie der Transformationsgruppen | journal=Monatshefte für Mathematik | volume=1 |issue=1 | pages=283&ndash;354 | doi=10.1007/BF01692479 }}</ref>\n\nThere exist two two-dimensional algebras. Each algebra consists of linear combinations (with complex coefficients) of two basis elements, 1 (the identity element) and ''a''. According to the definition of an identity element,\n:<math>\\textstyle 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\, , \\quad 1 \\cdot a = a \\, , \\quad a \\cdot 1 = a \\, . </math>\nIt remains to specify\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = 1 </math> &nbsp; for the first algebra,\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = 0 </math> &nbsp; for the second algebra.\n\nThere exist five three-dimensional algebras. Each algebra consists of linear combinations of three basis elements, 1 (the identity element), ''a'' and ''b''. Taking into account the definition of an identity element, it is sufficient to specify\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = a \\, , \\quad b b = b \\, , \\quad a b = b a = 0 </math> &nbsp; for the first algebra,\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = a \\, , \\quad b b = 0 \\, , \\quad a b = b a = 0 </math> &nbsp; for the second algebra,\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = b \\, , \\quad b b = 0 \\, , \\quad a b = b a = 0 </math> &nbsp; for the third algebra,\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = 1 \\, , \\quad b b = 0 \\, , \\quad a b = - b a = b </math> &nbsp; for the fourth algebra,\n:<math>\\textstyle a a = 0 \\, , \\quad b b = 0 \\, , \\quad a b = b a = 0 </math> &nbsp; for the fifth algebra.\nThe fourth algebra is non-commutative, others are commutative.\n\n== Generalization: algebra over a ring ==\n \nIn some areas of mathematics, such as [[commutative algebra]], it is common to consider the more general concept of an '''algebra over a ring''', where a commutative unital ring ''R'' replaces the field ''K''. The only part of the definition that changes is that ''A'' is assumed to be an [[Module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] (instead of a vector space over ''K''). \n\n===Associative algebras over rings===\n{{main|Associative algebra}}\n\nA [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''A'' is always an associative algebra over its [[Center (ring theory)|center]], and over the [[integer]]s. A classical example of an algebra over its center, is the [[split-biquaternion|split-biquaternion algebra]], which is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{H} \\times \\mathbb{H}</math>, the direct product of two [[quaternion|quaternion algebras]]. The center of that ring is <math>\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}</math>, and hence it has the structure of an algebra over its center, which is not a field. Note that the split-biquaternion algebra is also naturally an 8-dimensional <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>-algebra.\n\nIn commutative algebra, if ''A'' is a [[commutative ring]], then any unital ring homomorphism <math>R \\to A</math> defines an ''R''-module structure on ''A'', and this is what is known as the ''R''-algebra structure.<ref> H.

The * [[additive inverse|flips the sign]] of that square root.\n* A [[quadratic integer]] ring (for some {{mvar|D}}) is a commutative *-ring with the * defined in the similar way; [[quadratic field]]s are *-algebras over appropriate quadratic integer rings.\n* [[Quaternion]]s, [[split-complex number]]s, [[dual number]]s, and possibly other [[hypercomplex number]] systems form *-rings (with their built-in conjugation operation) and *-algebras over reals (where * is trivial). Note that neither of the three is a complex algebra.\n* [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s form a non-commutative *-ring with the quaternion conjugation.\n* The [[Matrix ring|matrix algebra]] of {{math|''n'' × ''n'' }}[[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''R''' with * given by the [[transpose|transposition]].\n* The matrix algebra of {{math|''n'' × ''n'' }}matrices over '''C''' with * given by the [[conjugate transpose]].\n* Its generalization, the [[Hermitian adjoint]] in the algebra of [[bounded linear operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] also defines a *-algebra.\n* The [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''R''[''x'']}} over a commutative trivially-*-ring {{mvar|R}} is a *-algebra over {{mvar|R}} with {{math|1=''P ''*(''x'') = ''P ''(−''x'')}}.\n* If {{math|(''A'', +, ×, *)}} is simultaneously a *-ring, an [[algebra over a ring]] {{mvar|R}} (commutative), and {{math|1=(''r x'')* = ''r'' (''x''*)&nbsp; ∀''r'' ∈ ''R'', ''x'' ∈ ''A''}}, then {{mvar|A}} is a *-algebra over {{mvar|R}} (where * is trivial).\n** As a partial case, any *-ring is a *-algebra over [[integer]]s.\n* Any commutative *-ring is a *-algebra over itself and, more generally, over any its [[#*-objects|*-subring]].\n* For a commutative *-ring {{mvar|R}}, its [[quotient ring|quotient]] by any its [[#*-objects|*-ideal]] is a *-algebra over {{mvar|R}}.\n** For example, any commutative trivially-*-ring is a *-algebra over its [[dual number#Generalization|dual numbers ring]], a *-ring with ''non-trivial'' *, because the quotient by {{math|1=ε = 0}} makes the original ring.<!-- is the same true for a non-trivially-* ring? -->\n** The same about a commutative ring {{mvar|K}} and its polynomial ring {{math|''K''[''x'']}}: the quotient by {{math|1=''x'' = 0}} restores {{mvar|K}}.\n* In [[Hecke algebra of a Coxeter group|Hecke algebra]], an involution is important to the [[Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial]].\n* The [[endomorphism ring]] of an [[elliptic curve]] becomes a *-algebra over the integers, where the involution is given by taking the [[dual abelian variety|dual isogeny]]. A similar construction works for [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]] with a [[abelian variety|polarization]], in which case it is called the [[Rosati involution]] (see Milne's lecture notes on abelian varieties).\n[[Hopf algebra#Examples|Involutive Hopf algebras]] are important examples of *-algebras (with the additional structure of a compatible [[comultiplication]]); the most familiar example being:\n* The [[group Hopf algebra]]: a [[group ring]], with involution given by {{math|''g'' ↦ ''g''<sup>−1</sup>}}.\n\n==Non-Example==\n\nNot every algebra admits an involution:\n\nRegard the 2x2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over the complex numbers.<br>\nConsider the following subalgebra:\n\n<math>\\mathcal{A}:=\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}:a,b\\in\\mathbb{C}\\right\\}</math>\n\nAny nontrivial antiautomorphism necessarily has the form:\n\n<math>\\varphi_z\\left[\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\right]=\\begin{pmatrix}1&z\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\\varphi_z\\left[\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\right]=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nfor any complex number <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>.<br>\nIt follows that any nontrivial antiautomorphism fails to be idempotent:\n\n<math>\\varphi_z^2\\left[\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\right]=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\neq\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nConcluding that the subalgebra admits no involution.\n\n==Additional structures==\nMany properties of the [[transpose]] hold for general *-algebras:\n* The Hermitian elements form a [[Jordan algebra]];\n* The skew Hermitian elements form a [[Lie algebra]];\n* If [[away from 2|2 is invertible]] in the *-ring, then {{sfrac|1|2}}{{math|(1 + *)}} and {{sfrac|1|2}}{{math|(1 − *)}} are [[idempotent|orthogonal idempotents]],<ref name=\":0\" /> called ''symmetrizing'' and ''anti-symmetrizing'', so the algebra decomposes as a direct sum of [[module (algebra)|modules]] ([[vector space]]s if the *-ring is a field) of symmetric and anti-symmetric (Hermitian and skew Hermitian) elements. These spaces do not, generally, form associative algebras, because the idempotents are [[linear operator|operators]], not elements of the algebra.\n\n===Skew structures===\nGiven a *-ring, there is also the map {{math|−* : ''x'' ↦ −''x''*}}.\nIt does not define a *-ring structure (unless the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is 2, in which case −* is identical to the original *), as {{math|1 ↦ −1}}<!-- (so * is not a ring homomorphism)  /irrelevant -->, neither is it antimultiplicative,  but it satisfies the other axioms (linear, involution) and hence is quite similar to *-algebra where {{math|size=120%|''x'' ↦ ''x''*}}.\n\nElements fixed by this map (i.e., such that {{math|1=''a'' = −''a''*}}) are called ''skew Hermitian''.\n\nFor the complex numbers with complex conjugation, the real numbers are the Hermitian elements, and the imaginary numbers are the skew Hermitian.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Semigroup with involution]]\n*[[B*-algebra]]\n*[[C*-algebra]]\n*[[Dagger category]]\n*[[von Neumann algebra]]\n*[[Baer ring]]\n*[[operator algebra]]\n*[[conjugate (algebra)]]\n*[[Cayley–Dickson construction]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:-algebra}}\n[[Category:Algebras]]\n[[Category:Ring theory]]"

      "text": "{{unref|date=May 2014}}\n{{distinguish|algebraic representation}}\nIn [[abstract algebra]], a '''representation of an [[associative algebra]]''' is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] for that algebra. Here an associative algebra is a (not necessarily [[unital algebra|unital]]) [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. If the algebra is not unital, it may be made so in a standard way (see the [[adjoint functors]] page); there is no essential difference between modules for the resulting unital ring, in which the identity acts by the identity mapping, and representations of the algebra.\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Linear complex structure ===\n{{main|Linear complex structure}}\nOne of the simplest non-trivial examples is a [[linear complex structure]], which is a representation of the [[complex number]]s '''C''', thought of as an associative algebra over the [[real number]]s '''R'''. This algebra is realized concretely as <math>\\mathbb{C} = \\mathbb{R}[i]/(i^2+1),</math> which corresponds to {{math|1={{mvar|i}}<sup>2</sup> = −1 }}. Then a representation of '''C''' is a real vector space ''V'', together with an action of '''C''' on ''V'' (a map <math>\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathrm{End}(V)</math>). Concretely, this is just an action of {{mvar|i}} , as this generates the algebra, and the operator representing {{mvar|i}} (the image of ''i'' in End(''V'')) is denoted ''J'' to avoid confusion with the identity matrix ''I'').\n\n=== Polynomial algebras ===\nAnother important basic class of examples are representations of [[polynomial algebra]]s, the free commutative algebras – these form a central object of study in [[commutative algebra]] and its geometric counterpart, [[algebraic geometry]]. A representation of a polynomial algebra in {{mvar|k}} variables over the field ''K'' is concretely a ''K''-vector space with {{mvar|k}} commuting operators, and is often denoted <math>K[T_1,\\dots,T_k],</math> meaning the representation of the abstract algebra <math>K[x_1,\\dots,x_k]</math> where <math>x_i \\mapsto T_i.</math>\n\nA basic result about such representations is that, over an algebraically closed field, the representing matrices are [[Triangular matrix#Simultaneous triangularisability|simultaneously triangularisable]].\n\nEven the case of representations of the polynomial algebra in a single variable are of interest – this is denoted by <math>K[T]</math> and is used in understanding the structure of a single linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space. Specifically, applying the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]] to this algebra yields as [[Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain#Corollaries|corollaries]] the various canonical forms of matrices, such as [[Jordan canonical form]].\n\nIn some approaches to [[noncommutative geometry]], the free noncommutative algebra (polynomials in non-commuting variables) plays a similar role, but the analysis is much more difficult.\n\n==Weights==\n{{main|Weight (representation theory)}}\n[[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] can be generalized to algebra representations.\n\nThe generalization of an [[eigenvalue]] of an algebra representation is, rather than a single scalar, a one-dimensional representation <math>\\lambda\\colon\\ A \\to R</math> (i.e., an algebra homomorphism from the algebra to its underlying ring: a [[linear functional]] that is also multiplicative).<ref group=\"note\">Note that for a field, the endomorphism algebra of a one-dimensional vector space (a line) is canonically equal to the underlying field: End(''L'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K''', since all endomorphisms are scalar multiplication; there is thus no loss in restricting to concrete maps to the base field, rather than to abstract 1-dimensional representations. For rings there are also maps to quotients rings, which need not factor through maps to the ring itself, but again abstract 1-dimensional modules are not needed.</ref> This is known as a [[Weight (representation theory)|weight]], and the analog of an eigenvector and eigenspace are called ''weight vector'' and ''weight space''.\n\nThe case of the eigenvalue of a single operator corresponds to the algebra <math>R[T],</math> and a map of algebras <math>R[T] \\to R</math> is determined by which scalar it maps the generator ''T'' to. A weight vector for an algebra representation is a vector such that any element of the algebra maps this vector to a multiple of itself – a one-dimensional submodule (subrepresentation). As the pairing <math>A \\times M \\to M</math> is bilinear, \"which multiple\" is an ''A''-linear functional of ''A'' (an algebra map ''A'' → ''R''), namely the weight. In symbols, a weight vector is a vector <math>m \\in M</math> such that <math>am = \\lambda(a)m</math> for all elements <math>a \\in A,</math> for some linear functional <math>\\lambda</math> – note that on the left, multiplication is the algebra action, while on the right, multiplication is scalar multiplication.\n\nBecause a weight is a map to a commutative ring, the map factors through the abelianization of the algebra <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> – equivalently, it vanishes on the [[derived algebra]] – in terms of matrices, if <math>v</math> is a common eigenvector of operators <math>T</math> and <math>U</math>, then <math>T U v = U T v</math> (because in both cases it is just multiplication by scalars), so common eigenvectors of an algebra must be in the set on which the algebra acts commutatively (which is annihilated by the derived algebra). Thus of central interest are the free commutative algebras, namely the [[polynomial algebra]]s. In this particularly simple and important case of the polynomial algebra <math>\\mathbf{F}[T_1,\\dots,T_k]</math> in a set of commuting matrices, a weight vector of this algebra is a [[simultaneous eigenvector]] of the matrices, while a weight of this algebra is simply a <math>k</math>-tuple of scalars <math> \\lambda = (\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_k)</math> corresponding to the eigenvalue of each matrix, and hence geometrically to a point in <math>k</math>-space. These weights – in particularly their geometry – are of central importance in understanding the [[representation theory of Lie algebras]], specifically the [[Lie algebra representation#Finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras|finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras]].\n\nAs an application of this geometry, given an algebra that is a quotient of a polynomial algebra on <math>k</math> generators, it corresponds geometrically to an [[algebraic variety]] in <math>k</math>-dimensional space, and the weight must fall on the variety – i.e., it satisfies defining equations for the variety. This generalizes the fact that eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in one variable.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Representation theory]]\n*[[Intertwiner]]\n*[[Representation theory of Hopf algebras]]\n*[[Lie algebra representation]]\n*[[Schur’s lemma]]\n*[[Jacobson density theorem]]\n*[[Double commutant theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Algebras]]\n[[Category:Module theory]]\n[[Category:Representation theory]]"

The addition and multiplication operations together give ''A'' the structure of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give ''A'' the structure of a [[vector space]] over ''K''. In this article we will also use the term [[algebra over a field|''K''-algebra''']] to mean an associative algebra over the field ''K''. A standard first example of a ''K''-algebra is a ring of [[Square matrix|square matrices]] over a field ''K'', with the usual [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIn this article associative algebras are assumed to have a multiplicative unit, denoted 1; they are sometimes called '''unital associative algebras''' for clarification. In some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made, and we will call such structures [[unital algebra|non-unital]] associative algebras. We will also assume that all rings are unital, and all ring homomorphisms are unital.\n\nMany authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', instead of a field: An '''''R''-algebra''' is an [[Module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] with an associative ''R''-bilinear binary operation, which also contains a multiplicative identity. For examples of this concept, if ''S'' is any ring with [[center (ring theory)|center]] ''C'', then ''S'' is an associative ''C''-algebra.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Algebra}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nLet ''R'' be a fixed [[commutative ring]] (so ''R'' could be a field). An '''associative ''R''-algebra''' (or more simply, an '''''R''-algebra''') is an additive [[abelian group]] ''A'' which has the structure of both a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] in such a way that the [[scalar multiplication]] satisfies\n:<math>r\\cdot(xy) = (r\\cdot x)y = x(r\\cdot y)</math>\nfor all ''r'' ∈ ''R'' and ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A''. Furthermore, ''A'' is assumed to be unital, which is to say it contains an element 1 such that\n:<math>1 x = x = x 1 </math>\nfor all ''x'' ∈ ''A''. Note that such an element 1 must be unique.\n\nIn other words, ''A'' is an ''R''-module together with (1) an [[bilinear map|''R''-bilinear map]] ''A'' &times; ''A'' → ''A'', called the multiplication, and (2) the multiplicative identity, such that the multiplication is associative:\n:<math>x(yz) = (xy)z\\,</math>\nfor all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''A''. (Technical note: the multiplicative identity is a datum,<ref>Put in another way, there is the forgetful functor from the category of unital associative algebras to the category of possibly non-unital associative algebras.</ref> while associativity is a property. By the uniqueness of the multiplicative identity, \"unitarity\" is often treated like a property.) If one drops the requirement for the associativity, then one obtains a [[non-associative algebra]].\n\nIf ''A'' itself is commutative (as a ring) then it is called a '''commutative ''R''-algebra'''.\n\n=== As a monoid object in the category of modules ===\nThe definition is equivalent to saying that a unital associative ''R''-algebra is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid object]] in [[category of modules|'''''R''-Mod''']] (the [[monoidal category]] of ''R''-modules). By definition, a ring is a monoid object in the [[category of abelian groups]]; thus, the notion of an associative algebra is obtained by replacing the category of abelian groups with the [[category of modules]].\n\nPushing this idea further, some authors have introduced a \"generalized ring\" as a monoid object in some other category that behaves like the category of modules. Indeed, this reinterpretation allows one to avoid making an explicit reference to elements of an algebra ''A''. For example, the associativity can be expressed as follows. By the universal property of a [[tensor product of modules]], the multiplication (the ''R''-bilinear map) corresponds to a unique ''R''-linear map\n:<math>m: A \\otimes_R A \\to A</math>.\nThe associativity then refers to the identity:\n:<math>m \\circ (\\operatorname {id} \\otimes m) = m \\circ (m \\otimes \\operatorname {id}).</math>\n\n===From ring homomorphisms===\nAn associative algebra amounts to a [[ring homomorphism]] whose image lies in the [[center of a ring|center]]. Indeed, starting with a ring ''A'' and a ring homomorphism <math>\\eta\\colon R \\to A</math> whose image lies in the [[center (ring theory)|center]] of ''A'', we can make ''A'' an ''R''-algebra by defining\n:<math>r\\cdot x = \\eta(r)x</math>\nfor all ''r'' ∈ ''R'' and ''x'' ∈ ''A''. If ''A'' is an ''R''-algebra, taking ''x'' = 1, the same formula in turn defines a ring homomorphism <math>\\eta\\colon R \\to A</math> whose image lies in the center.\n\nIf a ring is commutative then it equals its center, so that a commutative ''R''-algebra can be defined simply as a commutative ring ''A'' together with a commutative ring homomorphism <math>\\eta\\colon R \\to A</math>.\n\nThe ring homomorphism η appearing in the above is often called a [[structure map]]. In the commutative case, one can consider the category whose objects are ring homomorphisms ''R'' → ''A''; i.e., commutative ''R''-algebras and whose morphisms are ring homomorphisms ''A'' → ''A{{'}}'' that are under ''R''; i.e., ''R'' → ''A'' → ''A{{'}}'' is ''R'' → ''A{{'}}'' (i.e., the [[coslice category]] of the category of commutative rings under ''R''.)  The [[prime spectrum]] functor Spec then determines an anti-equivalence of this category to the category of [[affine scheme]]s over Spec ''R''.\n\nHow to weaken the commutativity assumption is a subject matter of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and, more recently, of [[derived algebraic geometry]]. See also: [[generic matrix ring]].\n\n==Algebra homomorphisms==\n{{main|algebra homomorphism}}\nA [[homomorphism]] between two ''R''-algebras is an [[module homomorphism|''R''-linear]] [[ring homomorphism]]. Explicitly, <math>\\varphi : A_1 \\to A_2</math> is an '''associative algebra homomorphism''' if\n:<math>\\varphi(r\\cdot x) = r\\cdot \\varphi(x)</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(x+y) = \\varphi(x)+\\varphi(y)\\,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y)\\,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(1) = 1\\,</math>\n\nThe class of all ''R''-algebras together with algebra homomorphisms between them form a [[category (mathematics)|category]], sometimes denoted '''''R''-Alg'''.\n\nThe [[subcategory]] of commutative ''R''-algebras can be characterized as the [[coslice category]] ''R''/'''CRing''' where '''CRing''' is the [[category of commutative rings]].\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe most basic example is a ring itself; it is an algebra over its center or any subring lying in the center. In particular, any commutative ring is an algebra over any of its subrings. Other examples abound both from algebra and other fields of mathematics.\n\n===Algebra===\n\n*Any ring ''A'' can be considered as a '''Z'''-algebra. The unique ring homomorphism from '''Z''' to ''A'' is determined by the fact that it must send 1 to the identity in A. Therefore, rings and '''Z'''-algebras are equivalent concepts, in the same way that [[abelian group]]s and '''Z'''-modules are equivalent.\n*Any ring of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''n'' is a ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')-algebra in the same way.\n*Given an ''R''-module ''M'', the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''M'', denoted End<sub>''R''</sub>(''M'') is an ''R''-algebra by defining (''r''·φ)(''x'') = ''r''·φ(''x'').\n*Any ring of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with coefficients in a commutative ring ''R'' forms an ''R''-algebra under matrix addition and multiplication. This coincides with the previous example when ''M'' is a finitely-generated, [[free module|free]] ''R''-module.\n* The square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from the field ''K'' form an associative algebra over ''K''. In particular, the [[2 &times; 2 real matrices]] form an associative algebra useful in plane mapping.\n* The [[complex number]]s form a 2-dimensional associative algebra over the [[real number]]s.\n* The [[quaternion]]s form a 4-dimensional associative algebra over the reals (but not an algebra over the complex numbers, since the complex numbers are not in the center of the quaternions).\n* The [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients form an associative algebra over the reals.\n* Every [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''] is a commutative ''R''-algebra. In fact, this is the free commutative ''R''-algebra on the set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''}.\n* The [[free algebra|free ''R''-algebra]] on a set ''E'' is an algebra of polynomials with coefficients in ''R'' and noncommuting indeterminates taken from the set ''E''.\n* The [[tensor algebra]] of an ''R''-module is naturally an ''R''-algebra. The same is true for quotients such as the [[exterior algebra|exterior]] and [[symmetric algebra]]s. Categorically speaking, the [[functor]] which maps an ''R''-module to its tensor algebra is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ''R''-module (forgetting the ring structure).\n*The following ring is used in the theory of [[λ-ring]]s. Given a commutative ring ''A'', let <math>G(A) = 1 + tA[\\![t]\\!],</math> the set of formal power series with constant term 1. It is an abelian group with the group operation that is the multiplication of power series. It is then a ring with the multiplication, denoted by <math>\\circ</math>, such that <math>(1 + at) \\circ (1 + bt) = 1 + abt,</math> determined by this condition and the ring axioms. The additive identity is 1 and the multiplicative identity is <math>1 + t</math>. Then <math>A</math> has a canonical structure of a <math>G(A)</math>-algebra given by the ring homomorphism\n::<math>\\begin{cases} G(A) \\to A \\\\ 1 + \\sum_{i > 0} a_i t^i \\mapsto a_1 \\end{cases}</math>\n:On the other hand, if ''A'' is a λ-ring, then there is a ring homomorphism\n::<math>\\begin{cases} A \\to G(A) \\\\ a \\mapsto 1 + \\sum_{i > 0} \\lambda^i(a)t^i \\end{cases}</math>\n:giving <math>G(A)</math> a structure of an ''A''-algebra.\n\n===Representation theory===\n\n* The [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra is an associative algebra that can be used to study the given Lie algebra.\n* If ''G'' is a group and ''R'' is a commutative ring, the set of all functions from ''G'' to ''R'' with finite support form an ''R''-algebra with the convolution as multiplication. It is called the [[group algebra]] of ''G''. The construction is the starting point for the application to the study of (discrete) groups.\n* If ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] (e.g., semisimple [[complex Lie group]]), then the [[coordinate ring]] of ''G'' is the [[Hopf algebra]] ''A'' corresponding to ''G''. Many structures of ''G'' translate to those of ''A''.\n\n===Analysis===\n\n* Given any [[Banach space]] ''X'', the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear operator]]s ''A'' : ''X'' → ''X'' form an associative algebra (using composition of operators as multiplication); this is a [[Banach algebra]].\n* Given any [[topology|topological space]] ''X'', the continuous real- or complex-valued functions on ''X'' form a real or complex associative algebra; here the functions are added and multiplied pointwise.\n* The set of [[semimartingale]]s defined on the [[filtration (mathematics)#Measure theory|filtered probability space]] (&Omega;,''F'',(''F<sub>t</sub>'')<sub>''t''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0</sub>,P) forms a ring under [[stochastic calculus|stochastic integration]].\n* The [[Weyl algebra]]\n* An [[Azumaya algebra]]\n\n===Geometry and combinatorics===\n* The [[Clifford algebra]]s, which are useful in [[geometry]] and [[physics]].\n* [[Incidence algebra]]s of locally finite [[partially ordered set]]s are associative algebras considered in [[combinatorics]].\n\n==Constructions==\n;Subalgebras: A subalgebra of an ''R''-algebra ''A'' is a subset of ''A'' which is both a [[subring]] and a [[submodule]] of ''A''. That is, it must be closed under addition, ring multiplication, scalar multiplication, and it must contain the identity element of ''A''.\n;Quotient algebras: Let ''A'' be an ''R''-algebra. Any ring-theoretic [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' in ''A'' is automatically an ''R''-module since ''r''·''x'' = (''r''1<sub>''A''</sub>)''x''. This gives the [[quotient ring]] ''A''/''I'' the structure of an ''R''-module and, in fact, an ''R''-algebra. It follows that any ring homomorphic image of ''A'' is also an ''R''-algebra.\n;Direct products: The direct product of a family of ''R''-algebras is the ring-theoretic direct product. This becomes an ''R''-algebra with the obvious scalar multiplication.\n;Free products: One can form a [[free product of associative algebras|free product]] of ''R''-algebras in a manner similar to the free product of groups. The free product is the [[coproduct]] in the category of ''R''-algebras.\n;Tensor products: The tensor product of two ''R''-algebras is also an ''R''-algebra in a natural way. See [[tensor product of algebras]] for more details. Given a commutative ring ''R'' and any ring ''A'' the [[tensor product of rings|tensor product]] ''R''⊗<sub>'''Z'''</sub>''A'' can be given the structure of an ''R''-algebra by defining ''r''·(''s''⊗''a'') = (''rs''⊗''a''). The functor which sends ''A'' to ''R''⊗<sub>'''Z'''</sub>''A'' is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ring (forgetting the module structure). See also: [[change of rings]].\n\n==Coalgebras==\n{{Main|Coalgebra}}\nAn associative algebra over ''K'' is given by a ''K''-vector space ''A'' endowed with a bilinear map ''A''&times;''A''→''A'' having 2 inputs (multiplicator and multiplicand) and one output (product), as well as a morphism ''K''→''A'' identifying the scalar multiples of the multiplicative identity. If the bilinear map ''A''&times;''A''→''A'' is reinterpreted as a linear map (i. e., [[morphism]] in the category of ''K''-vector spaces) ''A''&otimes;''A''→''A'' (by the [[Tensor product#Characterization by a universal property|universal property of the tensor product]]), then we can view an associative algebra over ''K'' as a ''K''-vector space ''A'' endowed with two morphisms (one of the form ''A''&otimes;''A''→''A'' and one of the form ''K''→''A'') satisfying certain conditions which boil down to the algebra axioms. These two morphisms can be dualized using [[categorial duality]] by reversing all arrows in the [[commutative diagram]]s which describe the algebra [[axiom]]s; this defines the structure of a [[coalgebra]].\n\nThere is also an abstract notion of [[F-coalgebra]], where ''F'' is a [[functor]]. This is vaguely related to the notion of coalgebra discussed above.\n\n==Representations==\n{{main|Algebra representation}}\nA [[representation theory|representation]] of an algebra ''A'' is an algebra homomorphism ρ: ''A'' → End(''V'') from ''A'' to the endomorphism algebra of some vector space (or module) ''V''. The property of ρ being an algebra homomorphism means that ρ preserves the multiplicative operation (that is, ρ(''xy'')=ρ(''x'')ρ(''y'') for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''), and that ρ sends the unity of ''A'' to the unity of End(''V'') (that is, to the identity endomorphism of ''V'').\n\nIf ''A'' and ''B'' are two algebras, and ρ: ''A'' → End(''V'') and &tau;: ''B'' → End(''W'') are two representations, then there is a (canonical) representation ''A <math>\\otimes</math> B'' → End(''V <math>\\otimes</math> W'') of the tensor product algebra ''A <math>\\otimes</math> B'' on the vector space ''V <math>\\otimes</math> W''. However, there is no natural way of defining a [[tensor product]] of two representations of a single associative algebra in such a way that the result is still a representation of that same algebra (not of its tensor product with itself), without somehow imposing additional conditions. Here, by ''[[tensor product of representations]]'',  the usual meaning is intended: the result should be a linear representation of the same algebra on the product vector space. Imposing such additional structure typically leads to the idea of a [[Hopf algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]], as demonstrated below.\n\n===Motivation for a Hopf algebra===\nConsider, for example, two representations <math>\\sigma:A\\rightarrow \\mathrm{End}(V)</math> and <math>\\tau:A\\rightarrow \\mathrm{End}(W)</math>.  One might try to form a tensor product representation <math>\\rho: x \\mapsto \\sigma(x) \\otimes \\tau(x)</math> according to how it acts on the product vector space, so that\n\n:<math>\\rho(x)(v \\otimes w) = (\\sigma(x)(v)) \\otimes (\\tau(x)(w)).</math>\n\nHowever, such a map would not be linear, since one would have\n\n:<math>\\rho(kx) = \\sigma(kx) \\otimes \\tau(kx) = k\\sigma(x) \\otimes k\\tau(x) = k^2 (\\sigma(x) \\otimes \\tau(x)) = k^2 \\rho(x)</math>\n\nfor ''k'' ∈ ''K''. One can rescue this attempt and restore linearity by imposing additional structure, by defining an algebra homomorphism Δ: ''A'' → ''A'' &otimes; ''A'', and defining the tensor product representation as\n\n:<math>\\rho = (\\sigma\\otimes \\tau) \\circ \\Delta.</math>\n\nSuch a homomorphism Δ is called a [[comultiplication]] if it satisfies certain axioms.  The resulting structure is called a [[bialgebra]].  To be consistent with the definitions of the associative algebra, the coalgebra must be co-associative, and, if the algebra is unital, then the co-algebra must be co-unital as well. A [[Hopf algebra]] is a bialgebra with an additional piece of structure (the so-called antipode), which allows not only to define the tensor product of two representations, but also the Hom module of two representations (again, similarly to how it is done in the representation theory of groups).\n\n===Motivation for a Lie algebra===\n{{See also|Lie algebra representation}}\nOne can try to be more clever in defining a tensor product. Consider, for example,\n\n:<math>x \\mapsto \\rho (x) = \\sigma(x) \\otimes \\mbox{Id}_W + \\mbox{Id}_V \\otimes \\tau(x)</math>\n\nso that the action on the tensor product space is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho(x) (v \\otimes w) = (\\sigma(x) v)\\otimes w + v \\otimes (\\tau(x) w) </math>.\n\nThis map is clearly linear in ''x'', and so it does not have the problem of the earlier definition.  However, it fails to preserve multiplication:\n\n:<math>\\rho(xy) = \\sigma(x) \\sigma(y) \\otimes \\mbox{Id}_W + \\mbox{Id}_V \\otimes \\tau(x) \\tau(y)</math>.\n\nBut, in general, this does not equal\n\n:<math>\\rho(x)\\rho(y) = \\sigma(x) \\sigma(y) \\otimes \\mbox{Id}_W + \\sigma(x) \\otimes \\tau(y) + \\sigma(y) \\otimes \\tau(x) + \\mbox{Id}_V \\otimes \\tau(x) \\tau(y)</math>.\n\nThis shows that this definition of a tensor product is too naive; the obvious fix is to define it such that it is antisymmetric, so that the middle two terms cancel. This leads to the concept of a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Non-unital algebras==\n\nSome authors use the term \"associative algebra\" to refer to structures which do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity, and hence consider homomorphisms which are not necessarily unital.\n\nOne example of a non-unital associative algebra is given by the set of all functions ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' whose [[limit of a function|limit]] as ''x'' nears infinity is zero.\n\nAnother example is the vector space of continuous periodic functions, together with the [[convolution|convolution product]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abstract algebra]]\n* [[Algebraic structure]]\n* [[Algebra over a field]]\n* [[Sheaf of algebras]], a sort of an algebra over a [[ringed space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|author=Bourbaki, N.|title=Algebra I|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=3-540-64243-9}}\n* James Byrnie Shaw (1907) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=05160001 A Synopsis of Linear Associative Algebra], link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs.\n*  Ross Street (1998) ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050825034431/http://www-texdev.ics.mq.edu.au/Quantum/Quantum.ps Quantum Groups: an entrée to modern algebra]'', an overview of index-free notation.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Associative Algebra}}\n[[Category:Algebras]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''Azumaya algebra''' is a generalization of [[central simple algebra]]s to ''R''-algebras where ''R'' need not be a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Such a notion was introduced in a 1951 paper of [[Goro Azumaya]], for the case where ''R'' is a [[commutative local ring]]. The notion was developed further in [[ring theory]], and in [[algebraic geometry]], where [[Alexander Grothendieck]] made it the basis for his geometric theory of the [[Brauer group]] in [[Bourbaki seminar]]s from 1964-5. There are now several points of access to the basic definitions.\n\n==Over a ring==\nAn Azumaya algebra over a commutative local ring ''R'' is an ''R''-algebra ''A'' that is free and of finite rank ''r''≥1 as an ''R''-module, such that the [[tensor product]] <math>A \\otimes_R A^\\circ</math> (where ''A''<sup>o</sup> is the [[opposite ring|opposite algebra]])  is isomorphic to the [[matrix algebra]] End<sub>''R''</sub>(''A'') ≈ M<sub>''r''</sub>(''R'') via the map sending <math>a \\otimes b</math> to the endomorphism ''x'' → ''axb'' of ''A''.\n\n==On a scheme==\nAn Azumaya algebra on a scheme ''X'' with [[structure sheaf]] ''O''<sub>''X''</sub>, according to the original Grothendieck seminar, is a sheaf ''A'' of ''O''<sub>''X''</sub>-algebras that is étale locally isomorphic to a matrix algebra sheaf; one should, however, add the condition that each matrix algebra sheaf is of positive rank.  Milne, ''Étale Cohomology'', starts instead from the definition that it is a sheaf ''A'' of ''O''<sub>''X''</sub>-algebras whose stalk ''A''<sub>''x''</sub> at each point ''x'' is an Azumaya algebra over the [[local ring]] ''O''<sub>''X,x''</sub> in the sense given above.  \nTwo Azumaya algebras ''A''<sub>1</sub> and ''A''<sub>2</sub> are ''equivalent'' if there exist [[locally free sheaves]] ''E''<sub>1</sub> and ''E''<sub>2</sub> of finite positive rank at every point such that \n:<math>A_1\\otimes\\mathrm{End}(E_1) \\simeq A_2\\otimes\\mathrm{End}(E_2),</math>\nwhere End(''E''<sub>i</sub>) is the endomorphism sheaf of ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>.  The Brauer group of ''X'' (an analogue of the [[Brauer group]] of a field) is the set of equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras.  The group operation is given by tensor product, and the inverse is given by the opposite algebra.  \n\n==Applications==\nThere have been significant applications of Azumaya algebras in [[diophantine geometry]], following work of [[Yuri Manin]].  The [[Manin obstruction]] to the [[Hasse principle]] is defined using the Brauer group of schemes.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation | last=Knus | first=Max-Albert | title=Quadratic and Hermitian forms over rings | series=Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften | volume=294 | location=Berlin etc. | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1991 | isbn=3-540-52117-8 | zbl=0756.11008 }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Knus | first1=Max-Albert | last2=Ojanguren | first2=Manuel | title=Théorie de la descente et algèbres d'Azumaya | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics | doi=10.1007/BFb0057799 | mr=0417149 | zbl=0284.13002 | year=1974 | volume=389}}\n* {{cite book | last=Saltman | first=David J. | title=Lectures on division algebras | series=Regional Conference Series in Mathematics | volume=94 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1999 | isbn=0-8218-0979-2 | zbl=0934.16013 }}\n\n[[Category:Ring theory]]\n[[Category:Scheme theory]]\n[[Category:Algebras]]"

The BV formalism, based on an [[Action (physics)|action]] that contains both [[Field (physics)|fields]] and \"antifields\", can be thought of as a vast generalization of the original [[BRST formalism]] for [[Yang–Mills theory|pure Yang&ndash;Mills]] theory to an arbitrary Lagrangian gauge theory. Other names for the Batalin&ndash;Vilkovisky formalism are '''field-antifield formalism''', '''Lagrangian BRST formalism''', or '''BV–BRST formalism'''.

A '''BV 1-algebra''' that satisfies normalization Δ(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is the same as a [[differential graded algebra|differential graded algebra (DGA)]] with differential Δ. A BV 1-algebra has vanishing antibracket.\n\n==Odd Poisson manifold with volume density==\nLet there be given an (n|n) [[supermanifold]] with an odd Poisson bi-vector <math> \\pi^{ij}</math> and a Berezin volume density <math>\\rho</math>, also known as a '''P-structure''' and an '''S-structure''', respectively.

Khudaverdian's <math>\\Delta_{\\pi}</math> operator depends only on the P-structure. It is manifestly nilpotent <math>\\Delta_{\\pi}^{2}=0</math>, and of degree&nbsp;−1. Nevertheless, it is technically '''not''' a BV Δ operator as the vector space of semidensities has no multiplication. (The product of two semidensities is a density rather than a semidensity.) Given a fixed density <math>\\rho</math>, one may construct a nilpotent BV Δ operator as\n:<math> \\Delta(f) :=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\Delta_{\\pi}(\\sqrt{\\rho}f),</math>\nwhose corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions, or equivalently, [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s. The odd symplectic structure <math> \\pi^{ij}</math> and density <math>\\rho</math> are compatible if and only if Δ(1) is an odd constant.\n\n==Examples==\n* The [[Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket]] for multi-vector fields is an example of an antibracket.\n* If ''L'' is a Lie superalgebra, and Π is the operator exchanging the even and odd parts of a super space, then the [[symmetric algebra]] of Π(''L'') (the \"exterior algebra\" of ''L'') is a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra with Δ given by the usual differential used to compute Lie algebra [[cohomology]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[BRST quantization]]\n*[[Gerstenhaber algebra]]\n*[[Supermanifold]]\n*[[Analysis of flows]]\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{Cite journal |first=I.
