      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''Artin group''' (or '''generalized braid group''') is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of the form\n\n:<math>\\left \\langle x_1,x_2,\\ldots, x_n \\Big| \\langle x_1, x_2 \\rangle^{m_{1,2}} =\\langle x_2, x_1 \\rangle^{m_{2,1}}, \\ldots, \\langle x_{n-1}, x_n \\rangle^{m_{n-1,n}} = \\langle x_n, x_{n-1} \\rangle^{m_{n,n-1}} \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>m_{i,j} = m_{j,i} \\in \\{2,3,\\ldots, \\infty\\}.</math>\n\nFor <math>m</math> finite <math>\\langle x_i, x_j \\rangle^m</math> denotes an alternating product of <math>x_i</math> and <math>x_j</math> of length <math>m</math>, beginning with <math>x_i</math>. For example,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle x_i, x_j \\rangle^2 &= x_ix_j \\\\\n\\langle x_i, x_j \\rangle^3 &= x_ix_jx_i \\\\\n\\langle x_i, x_j \\rangle^4 &= x_ix_jx_ix_j \\\\\n&\\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf <math>m=\\infty</math> then there is (by convention) no relation for <math>x_i</math> and <math>x_j</math>.\n\nThe integers <math>m_{i,j}</math> can be organized into a [[symmetric matrix]], known as the [[Coxeter matrix]] of the group. Each Artin group has as a quotient the [[Coxeter group]] with the same set of generators and Coxeter matrix. The [[kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of the [[homomorphism]] to the associated Coxeter group, known as the '''pure Artin group''', is generated by relations of the form <math>x_i^2=1.</math>\n\n== Classes of Artin groups ==\n\n[[Braid group]]s are examples of Artin groups, with Coxeter matrix <math>m_{i,i+1} = 3</math> and <math>m_{i,j}=2</math> for <math>|i-j|>1.</math> Several important classes of Artin groups can be defined in terms of the properties of the Coxeter matrix.\n\n=== Artin groups of finite type ===\n\nIf ''M'' is a Coxeter matrix of finite type, so that the corresponding [[Coxeter group]] ''W''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''(''M'') is finite, then the Artin group ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''(''M'') is called an '''Artin group of finite type'''. The 'irreducible types' are labeled as ''A<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp;, ''B<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''C<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp;, ''D<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp;, ''I''<sub>2</sub>(''n'')&thinsp;, ''F''<sub>4</sub>&thinsp;, ''E''<sub>6</sub>&thinsp;, ''E''<sub>7</sub>&thinsp;, ''E''<sub>8</sub>&thinsp;, ''H''<sub>3</sub>&thinsp;, ''H''<sub>4</sub>&thinsp;. A pure Artin group of finite type can be realized as the [[fundamental group]] of the complement of a finite [[hyperplane arrangement]] in '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>. [[Pierre Deligne]] as well as [[Egbert Brieskorn]] and [[Kyoji Saito]] have used this geometric description to compute the center of ''A'', its [[group cohomology|cohomology]], and to solve the [[word problem for groups|word]] and [[conjugacy problem|conjugacy]] problems.\n\n=== Right-angled Artin groups ===\n\nIf ''M'' is a matrix all of whose elements are equal to 2 or ∞, then the corresponding Artin group is called a '''right-angled Artin group''', but also a '''(free) partially commutative group''', '''graph group''', '''trace group''', '''semifree group''' or even '''locally free group'''. For this class of Artin groups, a different labeling scheme is commonly used. Any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] <math>\\Gamma</math> on ''n'' vertices labeled 1, 2, &hellip;, ''n'' defines a matrix ''M'', for which ''m<sub>i,j</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 if ''i'' and ''j'' are connected by an edge in <math>\\Gamma,</math> and ''m<sub>i,j</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;∞ otherwise. The right-angled Artin group <math>A(\\Gamma)</math> associated with the matrix ''M'' has ''n'' generators ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, ''x<sub>n</sub>'' and relations \n\n: <math> x_i x_j = x_j x_i,</math> \n\nwhenever ''i'' and ''j'' are connected by an edge in <math>\\Gamma.</math>\n\nThe class of right-angled Artin groups includes the [[free group]]s of finite rank, corresponding to a graph with no edges, and the finitely-generated [[free abelian group]]s, corresponding to a [[complete graph]]. In fact, every right-angled Artin group of rank ''r'' can be constructed as [[HNN extension]] of a right-angled Artin group of rank ''r''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1, with the [[free product]] and [[Direct product of groups|direct product]] as the extreme cases. A generalization of this construction is called a [[Graph of groups|graph product of groups]]. A right-angled Artin group is a special case of this product, with every vertex/operand of the graph-product being a free group of rank one (the [[infinite cyclic group]]).\n\nEvery right-angled Artin group acts freely on a finite-dimensional [[CAT(0)]] cube complex, its ''Salvetti complex''<ref>Ruth Charney, ''An introduction to right-angled Artin groups'', Geometriae Dedicata 125 (2007) 141--158.</ref>. \n\nMladen Bestvina and Joel Brady used right-angled Artin groups and their Salvetti complexes to construct groups with given [[Finiteness properties of groups|finiteness properties]].\n\n== Other Artin Groups ==\n\nWe define that an Artin group or a [[Coxeter group]] is of ''large type'' if <math>m_{i,j} \\ge 3</math> for all ''i'' ≠ ''j''. We say that an Artin group or a [[Coxeter group]] is of ''extra-large'' type if <math>m_{i,j} \\ge 4</math> for all ''i'' ≠ ''j''.\n\n[[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Paul Schupp]] looked further into Artin groups and the properties that hold true for them. They proved four theorems, which were known to be true for [[Coxeter group]]s, and showed that they also held for Artin groups. Appel and Schupp had discovered that they could study extra-large Artin and [[Coxeter group]]s through the techniques of small cancellation theory. They also discovered that they could use a refinement of these same techniques to work with groups of large type.<ref name=\"Artin\">{{citation |last=Appel |first=Kenneth I. |first2=P.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-group",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], in the realm of [[group theory]], a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] is said to be a '''CA-group''' or '''centralizer abelian group''' if the [[centralizer]] of any nonidentity element is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[subgroup]].  Finite CA-groups are of historical importance as an early example of the type of classifications that would be used in the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] and the [[classification of finite simple groups]].  Several important infinite groups are CA-groups, such as [[free group]]s, [[Tarski monster]]s, and some [[Burnside group]]s, and the [[locally finite group|locally finite]] CA-groups have been classified explicitly.  CA-groups are also called '''commutative-transitive groups''' (or '''CT-groups''' for short) because commutativity is a [[transitive relation]] amongst the non-identity elements of a group if and only if the group is a CA-group.\n\n==History==\nLocally finite CA-groups were classified by several mathematicians from 1925 to 1998.  First, finite CA-groups were shown to be [[simple group|simple]] or [[solvable group|solvable]] in {{harv|Weisner|1925}}.  Then in the [[Brauer-Suzuki-Wall theorem]] {{harv|Brauer|Suzuki|Wall|1958}}, finite CA-groups of even order were shown to be [[Frobenius group]]s, abelian groups, or two dimensional [[projective special linear group]]s over a [[finite field]] of even order, PSL(2, 2<sup>''f''</sup>) for ''f'' ≥ 2. Finally, finite CA-groups of odd order were shown to be [[Frobenius group]]s or abelian groups in {{harv|Suzuki|1957}}, and so in particular, are never non-abelian simple.\n\nCA-groups were important in the context of the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. [[Michio Suzuki]] showed that every [[finite group|finite]], [[simple group|simple]], non-abelian, CA-group is of even [[order (group theory)|order]]. This result was first extended to the Feit–Hall–Thompson theorem showing that finite, simple, non-abelian, [[CN-group]]s had even order, and then to the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] which states that every finite, simple, non-abelian group is of even order.  A textbook exposition of the classification of finite CA-groups is given as example 1 and 2 in {{harv|Suzuki|1986|pp=291–305}}.  A more detailed description of the Frobenius groups appearing is included in {{harv|Wu|1998}}, where it is shown that a finite, solvable CA-group is a [[semidirect product]] of an abelian group and a fixed-point-free automorphism, and that conversely every such semidirect product is a finite, solvable CA-group.  Wu also extended the classification of Suzuki et al. to [[locally finite group]]s.\n\n==Examples==\nEvery [[abelian group]] is a CA-group, and a group with a non-trivial [[center (group theory)|center]] is a CA-group if and only if it is abelian.  The finite CA-groups are classified: the solvable ones are semidirect products of abelian groups by cyclic groups such that every non-trivial element acts fixed-point-freely and include groups such as the [[dihedral group]]s of order 4''k''+2, and the [[alternating group]] on 4 points of order 12, while the nonsolvable ones are all simple and are the  2-dimensional projective special linear groups PSL(2, 2<sup>''n''</sup>) for ''n'' ≥ 2. Infinite CA-groups include [[free group]]s, [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2, '''R''')]], and [[Burnside group]]s of large prime exponent, {{harv|Lyndon|Schupp|2001|p=10}}.  Some more recent results in the infinite case are included in {{harv|Wu|1998}}, including a classification of [[locally finite group|locally finite]] CA-groups.  Wu also observes that [[Tarski monster]]s are obvious examples of infinite simple CA-groups.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Brauer | first1=R. | author1-link=Richard Brauer | last2=Suzuki | first2=Michio | author2-link=Michio Suzuki | last3=Wall | first3=G.

Such [[group (mathematics)|groups]] are called '''completely factorizable groups''' in the Russian literature, following {{harv|Baeva|1953}} and {{harv|Černikov|1953}}.\n\nThe following are equivalent for any [[finite group]] ''G'':\n* ''G'' is complemented\n* ''G'' is a subgroup of a [[direct product of groups]] of square-free [[order (group theory)|order]] (a special type of [[Z-group]])\n* ''G'' is a [[supersolvable group]] with [[elementary abelian group|elementary abelian]] [[Sylow subgroup]]s (a special type of [[A-group]]), {{harv|Hall|1937|loc=Theorem 1 and 2}}.\n\nLater, in {{harv|Zacher|1953}}, a group is said to be complemented if the [[lattice of subgroups]] is a [[complemented lattice]], that is, if for every subgroup ''H'' there is a subgroup ''K'' such that ''H''∩''K''=1 and ⟨''H'',''K''⟩ is the whole group.  Hall's definition required in addition that ''H'' and ''K'' permute, that is, that ''HK'' = { ''hk'' : ''h'' in ''H'', ''k'' in ''K'' } form a subgroup.  Such groups are also called '''K-groups''' in the Italian and lattice theoretic literature, such as {{harv|Schmidt|1994|loc=Chapter 3.1|pp=114–121}}.  The [[Frattini subgroup]] of a K-group is trivial; if a group has a [[core-free]] [[maximal subgroup]] that is a K-group, then it itself is a K-group; hence subgroups of K-groups need not be K-groups, but [[quotient group]]s and direct products of K-groups are K-groups, {{harv|Schmidt|1994|pp=115–116}}.  In {{harv|Costantini|Zacher|2004}} it is shown that every [[finite simple group]] is a complemented group.  Note that in the [[classification of finite simple groups]], ''K''-group is more used to mean a group whose proper subgroups only have composition factors amongst the known finite simple groups.\n\nAn example of a group that is not complemented (in either sense) is the [[cyclic group]] of order ''p''<sup>2</sup>, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]]. This group only has one nontrivial subgroup ''H'', the cyclic group of order ''p'', so there can be no other subgroup ''L'' to be the complement of ''H''.\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Baeva | first1=N.

For the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, the group has a non-trivial center, while for the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 6}}, there is an [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|outer automorphism]].\n\nThe automorphism group of a simple group, {{math|''G''}}, is an [[almost simple group]]; for a non-abelian [[simple group]], {{math|''G''}}, the automorphism group of {{math|''G''}} is complete.\n\n== Properties ==\nA complete group is always [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to its [[automorphism group]] (via sending an element to conjugation by that element), although the reverse need not hold: for example, the [[dihedral group]] of 8 elements is isomorphic to its automorphism group, but it is not complete.  For a discussion, see {{harv|Robinson|1996|loc=section 13.5}}.\n\n== Extensions of complete groups ==\n\nAssume that a group, {{math|''G''}}, is a group extension given as a [[short exact sequence]] of groups\n: {{math|1 ⟶ ''N'' ⟶ ''G'' ⟶ ''G''′ ⟶ 1}}\n\nwith [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]], {{math|''N''}}, and quotient, {{math|''G''′}}. If the kernel, {{math|''N''}}, is a complete group then the extension splits: {{math|''G''}} is [[isomorphic]] to the [[direct product of groups|direct product]], {{math|''N'' × ''G''′}}. A proof using homomorphisms and exact sequences can be given in a natural way: The action of {{math|''G''}} (by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]) on the normal subgroup, {{math|''N''}} gives rise to a [[group homomorphism]], {{math|φ: ''G'' → Aut(''N'') ≅ ''N''}}.  Since {{math|Out(''N'') {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''N''}} has trivial center the homomorphism {{math|φ}} is [[surjective]] and has an obvious section given by the inclusion of {{math|''N''}} in {{math|''G''}}.  The kernel of {{math|φ}} is the [[centralizer]] {{math|C{{sub|''G''}}(''N'')}} of {{math|''N''}} in {{math|''G''}}, and so {{math|''G''}} is at least a [[semidirect product]], {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'') ⋊ ''N''}}, but the action of {{math|''N''}} on {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'')}} is trivial, and so the product is direct.  This proof is somewhat interesting since the original exact sequence is reversed during the proof.\n\nThis can be restated in terms of elements and internal conditions: If {{math|''N''}} is a normal, complete subgroup of a group, {{math|''G''}}, then {{math|''G'' {{=}} C{{sub|''G''}}(''N'') × ''N''}} is a direct product.  The proof follows directly from the definition: {{math|''N''}} is centerless giving {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'') &cap; ''N''}} is trivial.  If {{math|''g''}} is an element of {{math|''G''}} then it induces an automorphism of {{math|''N''}} by conjugation, but {{math|''N'' {{=}} Aut(''N'')}} and this conjugation must be equal to conjugation by some element {{math|''n''}} of {{math|''N''}}.  Then conjugation by {{math|''gn''{{sup|−1}}}} is the identity on {{math|''N''}} and so {{math|''gn''<sup>−1</sup>}} is in {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'')}} and every element, {{math|''g''}}, of {{math|''G''}} is a product {{math|(''gn''<sup>−1</sup>)''n''}} in {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'')''N''}}.\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Robinson | first1=Derek John Scott | title=A course in the theory of groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-94461-6 | year=1996}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Rotman | first1=Joseph J. | title=An introduction to the theory of groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-94285-8 | year=1994}} (chapter 7, in particular theorems 7.15 and 7.17).\n\n== External links ==\n* [[Joel David Hamkins]]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9808094v1 How tall is the automorphism tower of a group?]\n\n[[Category:Properties of groups]]"

The [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''g'' is the number of elements in ⟨''g''⟩; that is, the order of an element is equal to the order of its cyclic subgroup. \n\nA ''cyclic group'' is a group which is equal to one of its cyclic subgroups: {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ⟨''g''⟩}} for some element ''g'', called a [[Generating set of a group|''generator'']].\n\nFor a '''finite cyclic group''' ''G'' of order ''n'' we have ''G'' = {''e'', ''g'', ''g''<sup>2</sup>, . . . , ''g''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>}, where ''e'' is the identity element and ''g''<sup>''i''</sup> = ''g''<sup>''j''</sup> whenever ''i'' &equiv; ''j'' ([[modular arithmetic|mod]] ''n'');  in particular ''g''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''g''<sup>0</sup> = ''e'', and ''g''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''g''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>. An abstract group defined by this multiplication is often denoted C''<sub>n</sub>,'' and we say that ''G'' is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the standard cyclic group C''<sub>n</sub>''.

The [[lattice of subgroups]] of '''Z''' is isomorphic to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of the lattice of natural numbers ordered by [[divisibility]].<ref>{{Harv|Aluffi|2009|pp=82–84|loc=6.4 Example: Subgroups of Cyclic Groups}}.</ref> Thus, since a prime number ''p'' has no nontrivial divisors, ''p'''''Z''' is a maximal proper subgroup, and the quotient group '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' is [[simple group|simple]]; in fact, a cyclic group is simple if and only if its order is prime.<ref>{{Harv|Gannon|2006|p=18|}}.</ref>\n\nAll quotient groups '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' are finite, with the exception {{nowrap|1='''Z'''/0'''Z''' = '''Z'''/{0}.}} For every positive divisor ''d'' of ''n'', the quotient group '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' has precisely one subgroup of order ''d'', generated by the [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence classes|residue class]] of ''n''/''d''. There are no other subgroups.\n\n==Additional properties==\nEvery cyclic group is [[abelian group|abelian]].<ref name=\"eom\"/> That is, its group operation is [[Commutative property|commutative]]: {{nowrap|1=''gh'' = ''hg''}} (for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''). This is clear for the groups of integer and modular addition since {{nowrap|''r'' + ''s'' ≡ ''s'' + ''r'' (mod ''n'')}}, and it follows for all cyclic groups since they are all isomorphic to these standard groups.\nFor a finite cyclic group of order ''n'', ''g''<sup>''n''</sup> is the identity element for any element ''g''. This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since {{nowrap|''kn'' ≡ 0 (mod ''n'')}} for every integer ''k''. (This is also true for a general group of order ''n'', due to [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]].)\n\nFor a [[prime power]] ''p<sup>k</sup>,'' the group '''Z'''/''p<sup>k</sup>'''''Z''' is called a [[primary cyclic group]]. The [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups|fundamental theorem of abelian groups]] states that every [[finitely generated abelian group]] is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups.\n\nBecause a cyclic group is abelian, each of its [[Conjugacy class|conjugacy classes]] consists of a single element. A cyclic group of order ''n'' therefore has ''n'' conjugacy classes.\n\nIf ''d'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'', then the number of elements in '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' which have order ''d'' is ''φ''(''d''), and the number of elements whose order divides ''d'' is exactly ''d''.\nIf ''G'' is a finite group in which, for each {{nowrap|''n'' > 0}}, ''G'' contains at most ''n'' elements of order dividing ''n'', then ''G'' must be cyclic.{{refn|group=note|This implication remains true even if only prime values of ''n'' are considered.<ref>{{Harv|Gallian|2010|loc = Exercise&nbsp;43|p=84}}.</ref> (And observe that when ''n'' is prime, there is exactly one element whose order is a proper divisor of ''n'', namely the identity.)}}\nThe order of an element ''m'' in '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is ''n''/[[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'',''m'').\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]], then the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of two cyclic groups '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' and '''Z'''/''m'''''Z''' is isomorphic to the cyclic group '''Z'''/''nm'''''Z''', and the converse also holds: this is one form of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. For example, '''Z'''/12'''Z''' is isomorphic to the direct product '''Z'''/3'''Z''' × '''Z'''/4'''Z''' under the isomorphism (''k'' mod 12) → (''k'' mod 3, ''k'' mod 4); but it is not isomorphic to '''Z'''/6'''Z''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', in which every element has order at most 6.\n\nIf ''p'' is a [[prime number]], then any group with ''p'' elements is isomorphic to the simple group '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''.\nA number ''n''  is called a [[cyclic number (group theory)|cyclic number]] if '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is the only group of order ''n'', which is true exactly when {{nowrap|1=gcd(''n'',''φ''(''n'')) = 1}}.<ref>{{Harv|Jungnickel|1992|pp=545–547}}.</ref> The cyclic numbers include all primes, but some are [[composite number|composite]] such as&nbsp;15. However, all cyclic numbers are odd except 2. The cyclic numbers are:\n\n:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 51, 53, 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 95, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 141, 143, ... {{OEIS|id=A003277}}\n\nThe definition immediately implies that cyclic groups have [[presentation of a group|group presentation]] {{nowrap|1=C<sub>∞</sub> = {{langle}}''x'' {{!}} {{rangle}}}} and {{nowrap|1=C<sub>''n''</sub> = {{langle}}''x'' {{!}} ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>{{rangle}}}} for finite ''n''.<ref>{{Harv|Coxeter|Moser|1980|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n==Associated objects==\n\n===Representations===\nThe [[Representation theory of finite groups|representation theory]] of the cyclic group is a critical base case for the representation theory of more general finite groups.  In the [[character theory|complex case]], a representation of a cyclic group decomposes into a direct sum of linear characters, making the connection between character theory and representation theory transparent.  In the [[modular representation theory|positive characteristic case]], the indecomposable representations of the cyclic group form a model and inductive basis for the representation theory of groups with cyclic [[Sylow subgroup]]s and more generally the representation theory of blocks of cyclic defect.\n\n===Cycle graph===\n{{Further|Cycle graph (algebra)}}\n{{anchor|Z_sub2}}\nA '''cycle graph''' illustrates the various cycles of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small [[finite group]]s. A cycle graph for a cyclic group is simply a [[circular graph]], where the group order is equal to the number of nodes. A single generator defines the group as a directional path on the graph, and the inverse generator defines a backwards path. Trivial paths (identity) can be drawn as a [[Loop (graph theory)|loop]] but are usually suppressed. Z<sub>2</sub> is sometimes drawn with two curved edges as a [[multigraph]].<ref>{{MathWorld|title=Cycle Graph|id=CycleGraph}}</ref>\n\nCyclic groups Z<sub>''n''</sub>, order ''n'', is a single cycle graphed simply as an ''n''-sided polygon with the elements at the vertices.  When {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''ab''}} with ''a'' and ''b'' being [[relatively prime]] (i.e., {{nowrap|1=[[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''a'', ''b'') = 1}}), a cyclic group Z<sub>''n''</sub> can be decomposed into a [[direct product]] {{nowrap|Z<sub>''a''</sub> × Z<sub>''b''</sub>}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Cycle graphs up to order 24\n|- align=center\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC1.svg|40px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC2.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC3.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC4.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC5.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC6.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC7.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC8.svg|60px]]\n|- align=center\n| Z<sub>1</sub>|| Z<sub>2</sub>|| Z<sub>3</sub>|| Z<sub>4</sub>|| Z<sub>5</sub>|| Z<sub>6</sub> = Z<sub>3</sub>×Z<sub>2</sub>|| Z<sub>7</sub>|| Z<sub>8</sub>\n|- align=center\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC9.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC10.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC11.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC12.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC13.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC14.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC15.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC16.svg|60px]]\n|- align=center\n| Z<sub>9</sub>||Z<sub>10</sub> = Z<sub>5</sub>×Z<sub>2</sub>||Z<sub>11</sub>||Z<sub>12</sub> = Z<sub>4</sub>×Z<sub>3</sub>||Z<sub>13</sub>||Z<sub>14</sub> = Z<sub>7</sub>×Z<sub>2</sub>||Z<sub>15</sub> = Z<sub>5</sub>×Z<sub>3</sub>||Z<sub>16</sub>\n|- align=center\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC17.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC18.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC19.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC20.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC21.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC22.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC23.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC24.svg|60px]]\n|- align=center\n| Z<sub>17</sub>||Z<sub>18</sub> = Z<sub>9</sub>×Z<sub>2</sub>||Z<sub>19</sub>||Z<sub>20</sub> = Z<sub>5</sub>×Z<sub>4</sub>||Z<sub>21</sub> = Z<sub>7</sub>×Z<sub>3</sub>||Z<sub>22</sub> = Z<sub>11</sub>×Z<sub>2</sub>||Z<sub>23</sub>||Z<sub>24</sub> = Z<sub>8</sub>×Z<sub>3</sub>\n|}\n\n===Cayley graph===\n{{main|Circulant graph}}\n[[File:Paley13.svg|thumb|240px|The [[Paley graph]] of order 13, a circulant graph formed as the Cayley graph of '''Z'''/13 with generator set {1,3,4}]]\nA [[Cayley graph]] is a graph defined from a pair (''G'',''S'') where ''G'' is a group and ''S'' is a set of generators for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a [[cycle graph]], and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite [[path graph]]. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called [[circulant graph]]s.<ref>{{Harv|Alspach|1997|pp=1–22}}.</ref> These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point.

Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring '''Z''', i.e. to {{nowrap|({−1, +1}, ×) ≅ C<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\n===Tensor product and Hom of cyclic groups===\nThe [[tensor product]] <math>\\mathbf{Z}/m{\\mathbf{Z}} \\otimes \\mathbf{Z}/n{\\mathbf{Z}}</math> can be shown to be isomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{Z}/\\gcd(m, n){\\mathbf{Z}}</math>. So we can form the collection of group [[Group_homomorphism|homomorphisms]] from <math>\\mathbf{Z}/m{\\mathbf{Z}}</math> to <math>\\mathbf{Z}/n{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>, denoted <math>\\hom(\\mathbf{Z}/m{\\mathbf{Z}}, \\mathbf{Z}/n{\\mathbf{Z}})</math>, which is itself a group.\n\nFor the tensor product, this is a consequence of the general fact that <math>R/I \\otimes_R R/J \\cong R/(I+J)</math>, where <math>R</math> is a commutative [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] with unit and <math>I</math> and <math>J</math> are [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of the ring.

In other words, any element in a virtually cyclic group can be arrived at by applying a member of the cyclic subgroup to a member in a certain finite set. Every cyclic group is virtually cyclic, as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually cyclic if and only if it is [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and has exactly two [[End (graph theory)|ends]];{{refn|group=note|If ''G'' has two ends, the explicit structure of ''G'' is well known: ''G'' is an extension of a finite group by either the infinite cyclic group or the infinite dihedral group.<ref>{{Harv|Stallings|1970|pp=124–128}}.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially in the field of [[group theory]], a '''divisible group''' is an [[abelian group]] in which every element can, in some sense, be divided by positive integers, or more  accurately, every element is an ''n''th multiple for each positive integer ''n''.  Divisible groups are important in understanding the structure of abelian groups, especially because they are the [[injective module|injective]] abelian groups.\n\n==Definition==\n\nAn abelian group <math>(G, +)</math> is '''divisible''' if, for every positive integer <math>n</math> and every <math>g \\in G</math>, there exists <math>y \\in G</math> such that <math>ny=g</math>.<ref>Griffith, p.6</ref>  An equivalent condition is:  for any  positive integer <math>n</math>, <math>nG=G</math>, since the existence of <math>y</math> for every <math>n</math> and <math>g</math> implies that <math>n G\\supset G</math>, and in the other direction <math>n G\\subset G</math> is true for every group. A third equivalent condition is that an abelian group <math>G</math> is divisible if and only if <math>G</math> is an [[injective object]] in the [[category of abelian groups]]; for this reason, a divisible group is sometimes called an '''injective group'''.\n\nAn abelian group is <math>p</math>-'''divisible''' for a [[prime number|prime]] <math>p</math> if for every <math>g \\in G</math>, there exists <math>y \\in G</math> such that <math>py=g</math>.  Equivalently, an abelian group is <math>p</math>-divisible if and only if <math>pG=G</math>.\n\n==Examples==\n\n* The [[rational number]]s <math>\\mathbb Q</math> form a divisible group under addition.\n* More generally, the underlying additive group of any [[vector space]] over <math>\\mathbb Q</math> is divisible.\n* Every [[quotient group|quotient]] of a divisible group is divisible. Thus, <math>\\mathbb Q/\\mathbb Z</math> is divisible.\n* The ''p''-[[primary component]] <math>\\mathbb Z[1/p]/\\mathbb Z</math> of <math>\\mathbb Q/ \\mathbb Z</math>, which is isomorphic to the ''p''-[[quasicyclic group]] <math>\\mathbb Z[p^\\infty]</math> is divisible.\n* The multiplicative group of the [[complex number]]s <math>\\mathbb C^*</math> is divisible.\n* Every [[existentially closed]] abelian group (in the [[model theory|model theoretic]] sense) is divisible.\n\n==Properties==\n* If a divisible group is a subgroup of an abelian group then it is a [[direct summand]].<ref>Hall, p.197</ref>\n* Every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group.<ref>Griffith, p.17</ref>\n* Non-trivial divisible groups are not [[finitely generated abelian group|finitely generated]].\n* Further, every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group as an [[essential subgroup]] in a unique way.<ref>Griffith, p.19</ref>\n* An abelian group is divisible if and only if it is ''p''-divisible for every prime ''p''.\n* Let <math>A</math> be a ring. If <math>T</math> is a divisible group, then <math>\\mathrm{Hom}_\\mathbf{Z} (A,T)</math> is injective in the category of <math>A</math>-modules.<ref>Lang, p. 106</ref>\n\n==Structure theorem of divisible groups==\n\nLet ''G'' be a divisible group. Then the [[torsion subgroup]] Tor(''G'') of ''G'' is divisible. Since a divisible group is an [[injective module]], Tor(''G'') is a [[direct summand]] of ''G''. So\n\n:<math>G = \\mathrm{Tor}(G) \\oplus  G/\\mathrm{Tor}(G).</math>\n\nAs a quotient of a divisible group, ''G''/Tor(''G'') is divisible. Moreover, it is [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]]. Thus, it is a vector space over '''Q''' and so there exists a set ''I'' such that\n\n:<math>G/\\mathrm{Tor}(G) = \\oplus_{i \\in I} \\mathbb Q = \\mathbb Q^{(I)}.</math>\n\nThe structure of the torsion subgroup is harder to determine, but one can show{{sfn|Kaplansky|1965}}{{sfn|Fuchs|1970}} that for all [[prime number]]s ''p'' there exists <math>I_p</math> such that\n\n:<math>(\\mathrm{Tor}(G))_p = \\oplus_{i \\in I_p} \\mathbb Z[p^\\infty] = \\mathbb Z[p^\\infty]^{(I_p)},</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\mathrm{Tor}(G))_p</math> is the ''p''-primary component of Tor(''G'').\n\nThus, if '''P''' is the set of prime numbers,\n\n:<math>G = \\left(\\bigoplus_{p \\in \\mathbf P} \\mathbb Z[p^\\infty]^{(I_p)}\\right) \\oplus \\mathbb Q^{(I)}.</math>\n\nThe cardinalities of the sets ''I'' and ''I''<sub>''p''</sub> for ''p''&isin;'''P''' are uniquely determined by the group ''G''.\n\n==Injective envelope==\n{{main|Injective envelope}}\nAs stated above, any abelian group ''A'' can be uniquely embedded in a divisible group ''D'' as an [[essential subgroup]].  This divisible group ''D'' is the '''injective envelope''' of ''A'', and this concept is the [[injective hull]] in the category of abelian groups.\n\n==Reduced abelian groups==\n\nAn abelian group is said to be '''reduced''' if its only divisible subgroup is {0}. Every abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible subgroup and a reduced subgroup.  In fact, there is a unique largest divisible subgroup of any group, and this divisible subgroup is a direct summand.<ref>Griffith, p.7</ref> This is a special feature of [[hereditary ring]]s like the integers '''Z''': the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of injective modules is injective because the ring is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]], and the quotients of injectives are injective because the ring is hereditary, so any submodule generated by injective modules is injective.  The converse is a result of {{harv|Matlis|1958}}: if every module has a unique maximal injective submodule, then the ring is hereditary.\n\nA complete classification of countable reduced periodic abelian groups is given by [[Ulm's theorem]].\n\n==Generalization==\n\nSeveral distinct definitions which generalize divisible groups to divisible modules. The following definitions have been used in the literature to define a divisible [[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'' over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'':\n# ''rM''=''M'' for all nonzero ''r'' in ''R''.{{sfn|Feigelstock|2006}} (It is sometimes required that ''r'' is not a zero-divisor, and some authors{{sfn|Cartan|Eilenberg|1999}}{{sfn|Rotman|2009}} require that ''R'' is a domain.)\n# For every principal left ideal ''Ra'', any homomorphism from ''Ra'' into ''M'' extends to a homomorphism from ''R'' into ''M''.{{sfn|Lam|1999}}{{sfn|Nicholson|Yousif\n|2003}} (This type of divisible module is also called ''principally injective module''.)\n# For every [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] left ideal ''L'' of ''R'', any homomorphism from ''L'' into ''M'' extends to a homomorphism from ''R'' into ''M''.{{sfn|Damiano|1979}}\n\nThe last two conditions are \"restricted versions\" of the [[Baer's criterion]] for [[injective module]]s. Since injective left modules extend homomorphisms from ''all'' left ideals to ''R'', injective modules are clearly divisible in sense 2 and 3.\n\nIf ''R'' is additionally a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] then all three definitions coincide.  If ''R'' is a principal left ideal domain, then divisible modules coincide with injective modules.{{sfn|Lam|1999|loc=p.70—73}} Thus in the case of the ring of integers '''Z''', which is a principal ideal domain, a '''Z'''-module (which is exactly an abelian group) is divisible if and only if it is injective.\n\nIf ''R'' is a commutative domain, then the injective ''R'' modules coincide with the divisible ''R'' modules if and only if ''R'' is a [[Dedekind domain]].{{sfn|Lam|1999|loc=p.70—73}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Injective object]]\n* [[Injective module]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |last1=Cartan |first1=Henri  |last2=Eilenberg |first2=Samuel |title=Homological algebra |series=Princeton Landmarks in Mathematics |publisher=Princeton University Press |place=Princeton, NJ |year=1999 |pages=xvi+390 |isbn=0-691-04991-2 |mr=1731415}} With an appendix by David A.

      "text": "In [[abstract algebra]], a '''free abelian group''' or '''free Z-module''' is an [[abelian group]] with a [[Free module|basis]].\nBeing an abelian group means that it is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with an addition operation that is [[associative]], [[commutative]], and invertible. A basis is a subset such that every element of the group can be found by adding or subtracting basis elements, and such that every element's expression as a [[linear combination]] of basis elements is unique. For instance, the [[integer]]s under addition form a free abelian group with basis {1}. Addition of integers is commutative, associative, and has subtraction as its inverse operation, each integer is the sum or difference of some number of copies of the number&nbsp;1, and each integer has a unique representation as an integer multiple of the number&nbsp;1.\n\nFree abelian groups have properties which make them similar to [[vector space]]s. They have applications in [[algebraic topology]], where they are used to define [[Chain (algebraic topology)|chain groups]], and in [[algebraic geometry]], where they are used to define [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisors]].  [[Integer lattice]]s also form examples of free abelian groups, and [[Lattice (group)|lattice theory]] studies free abelian [[subgroup]]s of real vector spaces.\n\nThe elements of a free abelian group with basis ''B'' may be described in several equivalent ways.\nThese include '''formal sums''' over ''B'', which are expressions of the form <math>\\sum a_i b_i </math> where each coefficient ''a<sub>i</sub>'' is a nonzero integer, each factor  ''b<sub>i</sub>'' is a distinct basis element, and the sum has finitely many terms. Alternatively, the elements of a free abelian group may be thought of as signed [[multiset]]s containing finitely many elements of ''B'', with the multiplicity of an element in the multiset equal to its coefficient in the formal sum. \nAnother way to represent an element of a free abelian group is as a function from ''B'' to the integers with finitely many nonzero values; for this functional representation, the group operation is the [[pointwise]] addition of functions.\n\nEvery set ''B'' has a free abelian group with ''B'' as its basis. This group is unique in the sense that every two free abelian groups with the same basis are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]]. Instead of constructing it by describing its individual elements, a free group with basis ''B'' may be constructed as a [[direct sum]] of copies of the additive group of the integers, with one copy per member of ''B''. Alternatively, the free abelian group with basis ''B'' may be described by a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] with the elements of ''B'' as its generators and with the [[commutator]]s of pairs of members as its relators. The ''rank'' of a free abelian group is the cardinality of a basis; every two bases for the same group give the same rank, and every two free abelian groups with the same rank are isomorphic. Every subgroup of a free abelian group is itself free abelian; this fact allows a general abelian group to be understood as a [[quotient group|quotient]] of a free abelian group by \"relations\", or as a [[cokernel]] of an injective [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] between free abelian groups.\n\n==Examples and constructions==\n\n===Integers and lattices===\n[[File:Lattice in R2.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|A lattice in the [[Euclidean plane]].

The free abelian group with basis ''B'' has a presentation in which the generators are the elements of ''B'', and the relators are the [[commutator]]s of pairs of elements of ''B''. Here, the commutator of two elements ''x'' and ''y'' is the product ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''y''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''xy''; setting this product to the identity causes ''xy'' to equal ''yx'', so that ''x'' and ''y'' commute. More generally, if all pairs of generators commute, then all pairs of products of generators also commute. Therefore, the group generated by this presentation is abelian, and the relators of the presentation form a minimal set of relators needed to ensure that it is abelian.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hungerford|1974}}, Exercise&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;75.</ref>\n\nWhen the set of generators is finite, the presentation is also finite. This fact, together with the fact that every subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian ([[#Subgroups|below]]) can be used to show that every finitely generated abelian group is finitely presented. For, if ''G'' is finitely generated by a set ''B'', it is a quotient of the free abelian group over ''B'' by a free abelian subgroup, the subgroup generated by the relators of the presentation of ''G''. But since this subgroup is itself free abelian, it is also finitely generated, and its basis (together with the commutators over ''B'') forms a finite set of relators for a presentation of ''G''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Johnson|2001}}, p.&nbsp;71.</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nEvery abelian group may be considered as a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over the integers by considering the scalar multiplication of a group member by an integer defined as follows:<ref>{{citation|title=Algebra|first1=Vivek|last1=Sahai|first2=Vikas|last2=Bist|publisher=Alpha Science Int'l Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=9781842651575|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsoyRX_nHLkC&pg=PA152}}.</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\\,x&=0\\\\\n1\\,x&=x\\\\\nn\\,x&= x+ (n-1)\\,x \\qquad \\text{if} \\quad n>1\\\\\nn\\,x&= -((-n)\\,x) \\qquad \\text{if} \\quad n<0\n\\end{align}</math>\nA [[free module]] is a module that can be represented as a direct sum over its base ring, so free abelian groups and free <math>\\mathbb Z</math>-modules are equivalent concepts: each free abelian group is (with the multiplication operation above) a free <math>\\mathbb Z</math>-module, and each free <math>\\mathbb Z</math>-module comes from a free abelian group in this way.<ref>{{citation|title=Advanced Modern Algebra|first=Joseph J.|last=Rotman|authorlink= Joseph J.

The system of chain groups linked by boundary operators in this way forms a [[chain complex]], and the study of chain complexes forms the basis of [[homology theory]].<ref>{{citation|title=Computational Topology: An Introduction|first1=Herbert|last1=Edelsbrunner|author1-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|first2=John|last2=Harer|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2010|isbn=9780821849255|pages=79–81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDXa6gFRZuIC&pg=PA79}}.</ref>\n\n===Algebraic geometry and complex analysis===\n{{main|Divisor (algebraic geometry)}}\n[[File:Z4 over z4minus1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[rational function]] <math>z^4/(z^4-1)</math> has a zero of order four at 0 (the black point at the center of the plot), and simple poles at the four complex numbers <math>\\pm 1</math> and <math>\\pm i</math> (the white points at the ends of the four petals).

The multiplicity <math>m_i</math> of a point in this multiset is its order as a zero of the function, or the negation of its order as a pole.\nThen the function itself can be recovered from this data, up to a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] factor, as\n:<math>f(q)=\\prod (q-c_i)^{m_i}.</math>\nIf these multisets are interpreted as members of a free abelian group over the complex numbers, then the product or quotient of two rational functions corresponds to the sum or difference of two group members. Thus, the multiplicative group of rational functions can be factored into the multiplicative group of complex numbers (the associated scalar factors for each function) and the free abelian group over the complex numbers. The rational functions that have a nonzero limiting value at infinity (the [[meromorphic function]]s on the [[Riemann sphere]]) form a subgroup of this group in which the sum of the multiplicities is zero.<ref name=\"dw\"/>\n\nThis construction has been generalized, in [[algebraic geometry]], to the notion of a [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]]. There are different definitions of divisors, but in general they form an abstraction of a codimension-one subvariety of an [[algebraic variety]], the set of solution points of a system of polynomial equations. In the case where the system of equations has one degree of freedom (its solutions form an [[algebraic curve]] or [[Riemann surface]]), a subvariety has codimension one when it consists of isolated points, and in this case a divisor is again a signed multiset of points from the variety. The meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface have finitely many zeros and poles, and their divisors can again be represented as elements of a free abelian group, with multiplication or division of functions corresponding to addition or subtraction of group elements. However, in this case there are additional constraints on the divisor beyond having zero sum of multiplicities.<ref name=\"dw\">{{citation|title=Theory of Algebraic Functions of One Variable|volume=39|series=History of mathematics|first1=Richard|last1=Dedekind|author1-link=Richard Dedekind|first2=Heinrich|last2=Weber|author2-link=Heinrich Martin Weber|others=Translated by [[John Stillwell]]|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2012|isbn=9780821890349|pages=13–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxte2mhlEOYC&pg=PA13}}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Free Abelian Group}}\n[[Category:Abelian group theory]]\n[[Category:Properties of groups]]\n[[Category:Free algebraic structures]]"

Each vertex represents an element of the free group, and each edge represents multiplication by ''a'' or ''b''.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''free group''' ''F''<sub>''S''</sub> over a given set ''S'' consists of all expressions (a.k.a. [[Word (group theory)|words]], or [[term (logic)#Formal definition|terms]]) that can be built from members of ''S'', considering two expressions different unless their equality follows from the [[group axioms]] (e.g. ''st'' = ''suu''<sup>−1</sup>''t'', but ''s'' ≠ ''t''<sup>−1</sup> for ''s'',''t'',''u'' ∈ ''S''). The members of ''S'' are called '''generators''' of ''F''<sub>''S''</sub>.\nAn arbitrary [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is called '''free''' if it is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''F''<sub>''S''</sub> for some [[subset]] ''S'' of ''G'', that is, if there is a subset ''S'' of ''G'' such that every element of ''G'' can be written in one and only one way as a product of finitely many elements of ''S'' and their inverses (disregarding trivial variations such as ''st'' = ''suu''<sup>−1</sup>''t'').\n\nA related but different notion is a [[free abelian group]], both notions are particular instances of a [[free object]] from [[universal algebra]].\n\n== History ==\nFree groups first arose in the study of [[hyperbolic geometry]], as examples of [[Fuchsian group]]s (discrete groups acting by [[isometry|isometries]] on the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]).

A free group on a two-element set ''S'' occurs in the proof of the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] and is described there.\n\nOn the other hand, any nontrivial finite group cannot be free, since the elements of a free generating set of a free group have infinite order.\n\nIn [[algebraic topology]], the [[fundamental group]] of a [[bouquet of circles|bouquet of ''k'' circles]] (a set of ''k'' loops having only one point in common) is the free group on a set of ''k'' elements.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe '''free group''' ''F<sub>S</sub>'' with '''free generating set''' ''S'' can be constructed as follows.  ''S'' is a set of symbols, and we suppose for every ''s'' in ''S'' there is a corresponding \"inverse\" symbol, ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, in a set ''S''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.   Let ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;∪&nbsp;''S''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and define a '''[[word (group theory)|word]]''' in ''S'' to be any written product of elements of ''T''. That is, a word in ''S'' is an element of the [[monoid]] generated by ''T''. The empty word is the word with no symbols at all. For example, if ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c''}, then ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a'',&nbsp;''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>,&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>,&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;''c''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}, and\n:<math>a b^3 c^{-1} c a^{-1} c\\,</math>\nis a word in ''S''.\n\nIf an element of ''S'' lies immediately next to its inverse, the word may be simplified by omitting the c,&nbsp;c<sup>&minus;1</sup> pair:\n:<math>a b^3 c^{-1} c a^{-1} c\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;a b^3 \\, a^{-1} c.</math>\nA word that cannot be simplified further is called '''reduced'''.\n\nThe free group ''F<sub>S</sub>'' is defined to be the group of all reduced words in ''S'', with [[concatenation]] of words (followed by reduction if necessary) as group operation.  The identity is the empty word.\n\nA word is called '''cyclically reduced''', if its first and last letter are not inverse to each other. Every word is [[Inner automorphism|conjugate]] to a cyclically reduced word, and a cyclically reduced conjugate of a cyclically reduced word is a cyclic permutation of the letters in the word.  For instance ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''abcb'' is not cyclically reduced, but is conjugate to ''abc'', which is cyclically reduced.  The only cyclically reduced conjugates of ''abc'' are ''abc'', ''bca'', and ''cab''.\n\n== Universal property ==\nThe free group ''F<sub>S</sub>'' is the [[Universal (mathematics)|universal]] group generated by the set ''S''.  This can be formalized by the following [[universal property]]: given any function ƒ from ''S'' to a group ''G'', there exists a unique [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''φ'':&nbsp;''F<sub>S</sub>''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''G'' making the following [[commutative diagram|diagram]] commute (where the unnamed mapping denotes the [[Inclusion_map|inclusion]] from ''S'' into ''F<sub>S</sub>''):\n[[Image:Free Group Universal.svg|center|100px]]\nThat is, homomorphisms ''F<sub>S</sub>''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''G'' are in one-to-one correspondence with functions ''S''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''G''. For a non-free group, the presence of [[group presentation|relations]] would restrict the possible images of the generators under a homomorphism.\n\nTo see how this relates to the constructive definition, think of the mapping from ''S'' to ''F<sub>S</sub>'' as sending each symbol to a word consisting of that symbol. To construct ''φ'' for given ƒ, first note that ''φ'' sends the empty word to the identity of ''G'' and it has to agree with ƒ on the elements of ''S''. For the remaining words (consisting of more than one symbol) ''φ'' can be uniquely extended since it is a homomorphism, i.e., ''φ''(''ab'') = ''φ''(''a'') ''φ''(''b'').\n\nThe above property characterizes free groups up to [[isomorphism]], and is sometimes used as an alternative definition.  It is known as the [[universal property]] of free groups, and the generating set ''S'' is called a '''basis''' for ''F<sub>S</sub>''.  The basis for a free group is not uniquely determined.\n\nBeing characterized by a universal property is the standard feature of [[free object]]s in [[universal algebra]].  In the language of [[category theory]], the construction of the free group (similar to most constructions of free objects) is a [[functor]] from the [[category of sets]] to the [[category of groups]].  This functor is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from groups to sets.\n\n==Facts and theorems==\nSome properties of free groups follow readily from the definition:\n\n#Any group ''G'' is the homomorphic image of some free group F(''S''). Let ''S'' be a set of ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of ''G''. The natural map ''f'': F(''S'') → ''G'' is an [[epimorphism]], which proves the claim. Equivalently, ''G'' is isomorphic to a [[quotient group]] of some free group F(''S''). The kernel of ''φ'' is a set of ''relations'' in the [[Presentation of a group|presentation]] of ''G''. If ''S'' can be chosen to be finite here, then ''G'' is called '''finitely generated'''.\n#If ''S'' has more than one element, then F(''S'') is not [[abelian group|abelian]], and in fact the [[center of a group|center]] of F(''S'') is trivial (that is, consists only of the identity element).\n#Two free groups F(''S'') and F(''T'') are isomorphic if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the '''rank''' of the free group ''F''. Thus for every cardinal number ''k'', there is, [[up to]] isomorphism, exactly one free group of rank ''k''.\n#A free group of finite rank ''n'' > 1 has an [[exponential growth|exponential]] [[growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] of order 2''n'' − 1.\n\nA few other related results are:\n#The [[Nielsen–Schreier theorem]]:  Every [[subgroup]] of a free group is free.\n#A free group of rank ''k'' clearly has subgroups of every rank less than ''k''. Less obviously, a (''nonabelian!'') free group of rank at least 2 has subgroups of all [[countable set|countable]] ranks.\n#The [[commutator subgroup]] of a free group of rank ''k'' > 1 has infinite rank; for example for F(''a'',''b''), it is freely generated by the [[commutator]]s [''a''<sup>''m''</sup>, ''b''<sup>''n''</sup>] for non-zero ''m'' and ''n''.\n#The free group in two elements is [[SQ universal]]; the above follows as any SQ universal group has subgroups of all countable ranks.\n#Any group that [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on a tree, [[free action|freely]] and preserving the [[oriented graph|orientation]], is a free group of countable rank (given by 1 plus the [[Euler characteristic]] of the [[Group action (mathematics)|quotient]] [[graph theory|graph]]).\n#The [[Cayley graph]] of a free group of finite rank, with respect to a free generating set, is a [[tree (mathematics)|tree]] on which the group acts freely, preserving the orientation.\n#The [[groupoid]] approach to these results, given in the work by P.J. Higgins below, is kind of extracted from an approach using [[covering space]]s. It allows more powerful results, for example on [[Grushko's theorem]], and a normal form for the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups. In this approach there is considerable use of free groupoids on a directed graph.\n# [[Grushko's theorem]] has the consequence that if a subset ''B'' of a free group ''F'' on  ''n'' elements generates ''F'' and has ''n'' elements, then ''B'' generates ''F'' freely.\n\n== Free abelian group ==\n{{further|Free abelian group}}\n\nThe free abelian group on a set ''S'' is defined via its universal property in the analogous way, with obvious modifications:\nConsider a pair (''F'', ''φ''), where ''F'' is an abelian group and ''φ'': ''S'' → ''F'' is a function. ''F'' is said to be the '''free abelian group on ''S'' with respect to ''φ'' ''' if for any abelian group ''G'' and any function ''ψ'': ''S'' → ''G'', there exists a unique homomorphism ''f'': ''F'' → ''G'' such that\n\n:''f''(''φ''(''s'')) = ''ψ''(''s''), for all ''s'' in ''S''.\n\nThe free abelian group on ''S'' can be explicitly identified as the free group F(''S'') modulo the subgroup generated by its commutators, [F(''S''), F(''S'')], i.e.\nits [[abelianisation]]. In other words, the free abelian group on ''S'' is the set of words that are distinguished only up to the order of letters. The rank of a free group can therefore also be defined as the rank of its abelianisation as a free abelian group.\n\n==Tarski's problems==\nAround 1945, [[Alfred Tarski]] asked whether the free groups on two or more generators have the same [[model theory|first order theory]], and whether this theory is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. {{harvtxt|Sela|2006}} answered the first question by showing that any two nonabelian free groups have the same first order theory, and {{harvtxt|Kharlampovich|Myasnikov|2006}} answered both questions, showing that this theory is decidable.\n\nA similar unsolved (as of 2011) question in [[free probability theory]] asks whether the [[von Neumann group algebra]]s  of any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups are isomorphic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Generating set of a group]]\n* [[Presentation of a group]]\n* [[Nielsen transformation]], a factorization of elements of the [[automorphism group of a free group]]\n* [[Normal form for free groups and free product of groups]]\n* [[Free product]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Kharlampovich|first= Olga|last2= Myasnikov|first2= Alexei|title=Elementary theory of free non-abelian groups|journal=[[Journal of Algebra]] |volume=302 |year=2006|issue= 2|pages= 451–552|doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2006.03.033|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~olga/p3new.PDF|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->|mr=2293770}} \n*W.

The [[triangle group]] corresponding to this tiling has a circle as its Gromov boundary.]]\n\nIn mathematics, the '''Gromov boundary''' of a [[δ-hyperbolic space]] (especially a [[hyperbolic group]]) is an abstract concept generalizing the boundary sphere of [[hyperbolic space]]. Conceptually, the Gromov boundary is the set of all [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]]. For instance, the Gromov boundary of the [[real line]] is two points, corresponding to positive and negative infinity.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThere are several equivalent definitions of the Gromov boundary of a geodesic and proper δ-hyperbolic space. One of the most common uses equivalence classes of [[geodesic#Metric geometry|geodesic]] rays.<ref> {{harvnb|Kapovich|Benakli|2002}}</ref>\n\nPick some point <math>O</math> of a hyperbolic metric space <math>X</math> to be the origin. A '''geodesic ray''' is a path given by an [[isometry]] <math>\\gamma:[0,\\infty)\\rightarrow X</math> such that each segment <math>\\gamma([0,t])</math> is a path of shortest length from <math>O</math> to <math>\\gamma(t)</math>.\n\nTwo geodesics <math>\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2</math> are defined to be equivalent if there is a constant <math>K</math> such that <math>d(\\gamma_1(t),\\gamma_2(t))\\leq K</math> for all <math>t</math>. The [[equivalence class]] of <math>\\gamma</math> is denoted <math>[\\gamma]</math>.\n\nThe '''Gromov boundary''' of a geodesic and proper hyperbolic metric space <math>X</math> is the set <math>\\partial X=\\{[\\gamma]|\\gamma</math> is a geodesic ray in <math>X\\}</math>.\n\n===Topology===\n\nIt is useful to use the '''Gromov product''' of three points. The Gromov product of three points <math>x,y,z</math> in a metric space is\n<math>(x,y)_z=1/2(d(x,z)+d(y,z)-d(x,y))</math>. In a [[tree (graph theory)]], this measures how long the paths from <math>z</math> to <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> stay together before diverging. Since hyperbolic spaces are tree-like, the Gromov product measures how long geodesics from <math>z</math> to <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> stay close before diverging.\n\nGiven a point <math>p</math> in the Gromov boundary, we define the sets <math>V(p,r)=\\{q\\in \\partial X|</math> there are geodesic rays <math>\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2</math> with <math>[\\gamma_1]=p, [\\gamma_2]=q</math> and <math>\\lim \\inf_{s,t\\rightarrow \\infty}(\\gamma_1(s),\\gamma_2(t))_O\\geq r\\}</math>. These open sets form a [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the topology of the Gromov boundary.\n\nThese open sets are just the set of geodesic rays which follow one fixed geodesic ray up to a distance <math>r</math> before diverging.\n\nThis topology makes the Gromov boundary into a [[compact space|compact]] [[metrization theorem|metrizable]] space. \n\nThe number of [[end (topology)|ends]] of a hyperbolic group is the number of [[connected set|components]] of the Gromov boundary.\n\n==Properties of the Gromov boundary==\nThe Gromov boundary has several important properties. One of the most frequently used properties in group theory is the following: if a group <math>G</math> [[geometric group action|acts geometrically]] on a [[δ-hyperbolic space]], then <math>G</math> is [[hyperbolic group]] and <math>G</math> and <math>X</math> have homeomorphic Gromov boundaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Gromov|1987}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most important properties is that it is a [[quasi-isometry]] invariant; that is, if two hyperbolic metric spaces are quasi-isometric, then the quasi-isometry between them gives a [[homeomorphism]] between their boundaries.<ref> {{harvnb|Coornaert|Delzant|Papadopoulos|1990}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ghys|de la Harpe|1996}}</ref> This is important because homeomorphisms of compact spaces are much easier to understand than quasi-isometries of spaces.\n\n==Examples==\n*The Gromov boundary of a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] is a [[Cantor space]].\n*The Gromov boundary of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic n-space]] is an ''(n-1)''-dimensional [[sphere]].\n*The Gromov boundary of the fundamental group of a [[compact Riemann surface]] is the unit circle.\n*The Gromov boundary of ''most'' hyperbolic groups is a [[Menger sponge]].<ref>{{harvnb|Champetier|1995}}</ref>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Visual boundary of CAT(0) space===\n{{Expand section|date=November 2013}}\nFor a [[complete space|complete]] [[CAT(0) space]] ''X'', the visual boundary of ''X'', like the Gromov boundary of  δ-hyperbolic space, consists of equivalence class of asymptotic geodesic rays. However, the Gromov product cannot be used to define a topology on it. For example, in the case of a flat plane, any two geodesic rays issuing from a point not heading in opposite directions will have infinite Gromov product with respect to that point. The visual boundary is instead endowed with the '''cone topology'''. Fix a point ''o'' in ''X''. Any boundary point can be represented by a unique geodesic ray issuing from ''o''. Given a ray <math>\\gamma</math> issuing from ''o'', and positive numbers ''t'' > 0 and ''r'' > 0, a [[neighborhood basis]] at the boundary point <math>[\\gamma]</math> is given by sets of the form\n: <math>U(\\gamma, t, r) = \\{[\\gamma_1]\\in\\partial X | \\gamma_1(0)=o, d( \\gamma_1(t),\\gamma(t))< r\\}.</math>\nThe cone topology as defined above is independent of the choice of ''o''.\n\nIf ''X'' is [[proper metric space|proper]], then the visual boundary with the cone topology is [[compact (topology)|compact]]. When ''X'' is both CAT(0) and proper geodesic δ-hyperbolic space, the cone topology coincides with the topology of Gromov boundary.<ref>{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999}}</ref>\n\n==Cannon's Conjecture==\n{{Main|Cannon's conjecture}}\nCannon's conjecture concerns the classification of groups with a 2-sphere at infinity:\n\n'''Cannon's conjecture''': Every [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Gromov]] [[hyperbolic group]] with a 2-sphere at infinity [[Geometric group action|acts geometrically]] on [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]].<ref name=\"RM\">{{harvnb|Cannon|1994}}</ref>\n\nThe analog to this conjecture is known to be true for 1-spheres and false for spheres of all dimension greater than 2.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation| last1 = Bridson| first1 = Martin R.| last2 = Haefliger| first2 = André | title = Metric spaces of non-positive curvature | series = Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften |volume = 319| publisher = Springer-Verlag| year = 1999| isbn = 3-540-64324-9| mr = 1744486}}\n*{{citation|first=James W.|last= Cannon|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9w0608p039151254/|title=The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem'|journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]|volume= 173 |year=1994|pages= 155–234|doi=10.1007/bf02398434}}\n*{{citation|first=C. |last=Champetier|title=Propriétés statistiques des groupes de presentation finie|journal=Adv.

      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Discrete}}\nIn [[group theory]], more precisely in [[geometric group theory]], a '''hyperbolic group''', also known as a ''word hyperbolic group'' or ''Gromov hyperbolic group'', is a finitely generated [[group (mathematics)|group]] equipped with a [[word metric]] satisfying certain properties abstracted from classical [[hyperbolic geometry]]. The notion of a hyperbolic group was introduced and developed by {{harvs|first=Mikhail|last=Gromov|year=1987|author-link=Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|txt=yes}}. The inspiration came from various existing mathematical theories: hyperbolic geometry but also low-dimensional topology (in particular the results of [[Max Dehn]] concerning the [[fundamental group]] of a hyperbolic [[Riemann surface]], and more complex phenomena in [[3-manifold|three-dimensional topology]]), and [[combinatorial group theory]]. In a very influential (over 1000 citations <ref>{{cite book |last1=Gromov |first1=Mikhail  |editor1-last=Gersten |editor1-first=S.M. |chapter=Hyperbolic Groups|title=Essays in Group Theory. Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications, vol 8. |date=1987 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |pages=75-263 |ref=Gromov_1987 |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=919829}}</ref>) chapter from 1987, Gromov proposed a wide-ranging research program. Ideas and foundational material in the theory of hyperbolic groups also stem from the work of [[George Mostow]], [[William Thurston]], [[James W. Cannon]], [[Eliyahu Rips]], and many others.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a finitely generated group, and <math>X</math> be its [[Cayley graph]] with respect to some finite set <math>S</math> of generators. The set <math>X</math> is endowed with its [[Distance (graph theory)|graph metric]] (in which edges are of length one and the distance between two vertices is the minimal number of edges in a path connecting them) which turns it into a [[length space]]. The group <math>G</math> is then said to be ''hyperbolic'' if <math>X</math> is a [[δ-hyperbolic space|hyperbolic space]] in the sense of Gromov. Shortly, this means that there exists a <math>\\delta > 0</math> such that any triangle in <math>X</math> is  <math>\\delta</math>-thin, as illustrated in the figure on the right (the space is then said to be <math>\\delta</math>-hyperbolic).\n\n{{ Annotated image | caption=The δ-thin triangle condition\n| image= Delta thin triangle condition.svg|\n| width=230\n| height = 155\n| image-width = 200\n| image-left = 30\n| annotations =\n{{Annotation|105|12|<math>x</math>}}\n{{Annotation|45|105|<math>y</math>}}\n{{Annotation|205|110|<math>z</math>}}\n{{Annotation|0|40|<math>B_\\delta([x,y])</math>}}\n{{Annotation|150|40|<math>B_\\delta([z,x])</math>}}\n{{Annotation|80|135|<math>B_\\delta([y,z])</math>}}\n}}\n\nA priori this definition depends on the choice of a finite generating set <math>S</math>. That this is not the case follows from the two following facts:\n\n*the Cayley graphs corresponding to two finite generating sets are always [[Quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] one to the other;\n*any geodesic space which is quasi-isometric to a geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space is itself Gromov-hyperbolic.\n\nThus we can legitimately speak of a finitely generated group <math>G</math> being hyperbolic without referring to a generating set. On the other hand, a space which is quasi-isometric to a <math>\\delta</math>-hyperbolic space is itself <math>\\delta'</math>-hyperbolic for some <math>\\delta' > 0</math> but the latter depends on both the original <math>\\delta</math> and on the quasi-isometry, thus it does not make sense to speak of <math>G</math> being <math>\\delta</math>-hyperbolic.\n\n=== Remarks ===\n\nThe Svarc--[[John Milnor|Milnor]] lemma{{sfn|Bowditch|2006|Theorem 3.6}} states that if a group <math>G</math> acting [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|properly discontinuously]] and with compact quotient (such an action is often called ''geometric'') on a proper length space <math>Y</math>, then it is finitely generated, and any Cayley graph for <math>G</math> is quasi-isometric to <math>Y</math>. Thus a group is (finitely generated and) hyperbolic if and only if it has a geometric action on a proper hyperbolic space.\n\nIf <math>G' \\subset G</math> is a subgroup with finite index (i.e., the set <math>G/G'</math> is finite), then the inclusion induces a quasi-isometry on the vertices of any (locally finite) Cayley graph of <math>G'</math> into any (ditto) Cayley graph of <math>G</math>. Thus <math>G'</math> is hyperbolic if and only if <math>G</math> itself is. More generally if two groups are [[Commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]], then one is hyperbolic if and only if the other is.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Elementary hyperbolic groups ===\n\nThe simplest examples of hyperbolic groups are [[finite groups]] (whose Cayley graphs are of finite diameter hence <math>\\delta</math>-hyperbolic with <math>\\delta</math> equal to this diameter).\n\nAnother very simple example is given by infinite cyclic group <math>\\Z</math> (with the generating set <math>\\{ 1 \\}</math> triangles are line segments, hence the Cayley graph is <math>0</math>-hyperbolic). It follows also that any group which is [[Virtually cyclic group|virtually cyclic]] (contains a copy of <math>\\Z</math> of finite index) is also hyperbolic, for example the [[infinite dihedral group]].\n\nMembers in this class of groups are often called ''elementary hyperbolic groups'' (the terminology is adapted from that of actions on the hyperbolic plane).\n\n=== Free groups and groups acting on trees ===\n\nLet <math>S = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}</math> be a finite set and <math>F</math> be the [[free group]] with generating set <math>S</math>. Then the Cayley graph of <math>F</math> with respect to <math>S</math> is a locally finite [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] and hence a 0-hyperbolic space. Thus <math>F</math> is an hyperbolic group.\n\nMore generally we see that any group <math>G</math> which acts properly discontinuously on a locally finite tree (in this context this means exactly that the stabilizers in <math>G</math> of the vertices are finite) is hyperbolic. Indeed, this follows from the fact that <math>G</math> has an invariant subtree on which it acts with compact quotient, and the Svarc—Milnor lemma. Such groups are in fact virtually free (i.e. contain a finitely generated free subgroup of finite index), which gives another proof of their hyperbolicity.\n\nAn interesting example is the [[modular group]] <math>G = \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z)</math>: it acts on the tree given by the 1-skeleton of the associated [[Modular group#Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane|tessellation of the hyperbolic plane]] and it has a finite index free subgroup (on two generators) of index 6 (for example the set of matrices in <math>G</math> which reduce to the identity modulo 2 is such a group). Note an interesting feature of this example: it acts properly discontinuously on a hyperbolic space (the [[hyperbolic plane]]) but the action is not cocompact (and indeed <math>G</math> is ''not'' quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane).\n\n=== Fuchsian groups ===\n\n{{main article|Fuchsian group}}\n\nGeneralising the example of the modular group a [[Fuchsian group]] is a group admitting a properly discontinuous action on the hyperbolic plane (equivalently, a discrete subgroup of <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)</math>). The hyperbolic plane is a <math>\\delta</math>-hyperbolic space and hence the Svarc—Milnor lemma tells us that cocompact Fuchsian groups are hyperbolic.\n\nExamples of such are the [[fundamental group]]s of [[Surface (topology)#Closed surfaces|closed surfaces]] of negative [[Euler characteristic]]. Indeed, these surfaces can be obtained as quotients of the hyperbolic plane, as implied by the Poincaré—Koebe [[Uniformisation theorem#Geometric classification of surfaces|Uniformisation theorem]].\n\nAnother family of examples of cocompact Fuchsian groups is given by [[Triangle group#The hyperbolic case|triangle groups]]: all but finitely many are hyperbolic.\n\n=== Negative curvature ===\n\nGeneralising the example of closed surfaces, the fundamental groups of compact [[Riemannian manifold]]s with strictly negative [[sectional curvature]] are hyperbolic. For example, cocompact [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in the [[orthogonal]] or [[unitary group|unitary]] group of a form of signature <math>(n,1)</math> are hyperbolic.\n\nA further generalisation is given by groups admitting a geometric action on a [[CAT(k) space]].<ref>for a proof that this includes the previous examples see https://lamington.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/upper-curvature-bounds-and-catk/</ref> There exists examples which are not commensurable to any of the previous constructions (for instance groups acting geometrically on hyperbolic [[Building (mathematics)|buildings]]).\n\n=== Small cancellation groups ===\n\n{{main article|Small cancellation theory}}\n\nGroups having presentations which satisfy [[Small cancellation theory|small cancellation]] conditions are hyperbolic. This gives a source of examples which do not have a geometric origin as the ones given above. In fact one of the motivations for the initial development of hyperbolic groups was to give a more geometric interpretation of small cancellation.\n\n=== Random groups ===\n\n{{main article|Random group}}\n\nIn some sense, \"most\" finitely presented groups with large defining relations are hyperbolic. For a quantitative statement of what this means see [[Random group]].\n\n=== Non-examples ===\n\n*The simplest example of a group which is not hyperbolic is the [[free abelian group|free rank 2 abelian group]] <math>\\mathbb Z^2</math>. Indeed, it is quasi-isometric to the [[Euclidean plane]] which is easily seen not to be hyperbolic (for example because of the existence of [[Homothetic transformation|homotheties]]).\n* More generally, any group which contains <math>\\Z^2</math> as a [[subgroup]] is not hyperbolic.{{sfn|Ghys|de la Harpe|1990|loc=Ch. 8, Th. 37}}{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter 3.Γ, Corollary 3.10.}} In particular, [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in higher rank [[semisimple Lie group]]s and the [[fundamental group]]s <math>\\pi_1(S^3\\setminus K)</math> of nontrivial [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] complements fall into this category and therefore are not hyperbolic. This is also the case for [[mapping class group]]s of closed hyperbolic surfaces.\n* The [[Baumslag–Solitar group]]s ''B''(''m'',''n'') and any group that contains a subgroup isomorphic to some ''B''(''m'',''n'') fail to be hyperbolic (since ''B''(1,1) = <math>\\Z^2</math>, this generalizes the previous example).\n* A non-uniform lattice in a rank 1 simple Lie group is hyperbolic if and only if the group is [[Isogeny|isogenous]] to <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\R)</math> (equivalently the associated symmetric space is the hyperbolic plane). An example of this is given by [[Hyperbolic link|hyperbolic]] [[knot group]]s. Another is the [[Bianchi group]]s, for example <math>\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\sqrt{-1})</math>.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Algebraic properties ===\n\n*Hyperbolic groups satisfy the [[Tits alternative]]: they are either virtually solvable (this possibility is satisfied only by elementary hyperbolic groups) or they have a subgroup isomorphic to a nonabelian free group.\n*Non-elementary hyperbolic groups are not [[Simple group|simple]] in a very strong sense: if <math>G</math> is non-elementary hyperbolic then there exists an infinite subgroup <math>H \\triangleleft G</math> such that <math>H</math> and <math>G/H</math> are both infinite.\n*It is not known whether there exists an hyperbolic group which is not [[Residually finite group|residually finite]].\n\n=== Geometric properties ===\n\n*Non-elementary (infinite and not virtually cyclic) hyperbolic groups have always exponential [[Growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] (this is a consequence of the Tits alternative).\n*Hyperbolic groups satisfy a linear [[isoperimetric inequality]].{{sfn|Bowditch|2006|loc=(F4) in paragraph 6.11.2}} In fact this is a characterisation of hyperbolicity.\n\n=== Homological properties ===\n\n*Hyperbolic groups are always [[Presentation of a group|finitely presented]]. In fact one can explicitly construct a complex (the [[Rips complex]]) which is [[Contractible space|contractible]] and on which the group acts geometrically{{sfn|Ghys|de la Harpe|1990|loc=Chapitre 4}} so it is [[Finiteness properties of groups|of type F]]. When the group is torsion-free the action is free, showing that the group has finite [[cohomological dimension]].\n*In 2002, I. Mineyev showed that hyperbolic groups are exactly those finitely generated groups for which the comparison map between the [[bounded cohomology]] and [[Group cohomology|ordinary cohomology]] is surjective in all degrees, or equivalently, in degree 2.{{sfn|Mineyev|2002}}\n\n=== Algorithmic properties ===\n\n*Hyperbolic groups have a solvable [[word problem for groups|word problem]]. They are [[biautomatic group|biautomatic]] and [[automatic group|automatic]].{{sfn|Charney|1992}} Indeed, they are [[automatic group|strongly geodesically automatic]], that is, there is an automatic structure on the group, where the language accepted by the word acceptor is the set of all geodesic words.\n*It was shown in 2010 that hyperbolic groups have a [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] marked isomorphism problem.{{sfn|Dahmani|Guirardel|2011}} It is notable that this means that the isomorphism problem, orbit problems (in particular the conjugacy problem) and Whitehead's problem are all decidable.\n*Cannon and Swenson have shown that hyperbolic groups with a 2-sphere at infinity have a natural [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]].{{sfn|Cannon|Swenson|1998}} This is related to [[Cannon's conjecture]].\n\n== Generalisations ==\n\n=== Relatively hyperbolic groups ===\n\n{{main article|Relatively hyperbolic group}}\n\n[[Relatively hyperbolic group]]s are a class generalising hyperbolic groups. ''Very'' roughly{{sfn|Bowditch|2012}} <math>G</math> is hyperbolic relative to a collection <math>\\mathcal G</math> of subgroups if it admits a (''not necessarily cocompact'') properly discontinuous action on a proper hyperbolic space <math>X</math> which is \"nice\" on the boundary of <math>X</math> and such that the stabilisers in <math>G</math> of points on the boundary are subgroups in <math>\\mathcal G</math>. This is interesting when both <math>X</math> and the action of <math>G</math> on <math>X</math> are not elementary (in particular <math>X</math> is infinite: for example every group is hyperbolic relatively to itself via its action on a single point!).\n\nInteresting examples in this class include in particular non-uniform lattices in rank 1 semisimple Lie groups, for example fundamental groups of non-compact hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. Non-examples are lattices in higher-rank Lie groups and mapping class groups.\n\n=== Acylindrically hyperbolic groups ===\n\nAn even more general notion is that of an acylindically hyperbolic group.{{sfn|Osin|2016}} Acylindricity of an action of a group <math>G</math> on a metric space <math>X</math> is a weakening of proper discontinuity of the action.<ref>In some detail: it asks that for every <math>\\varepsilon > 0</math> there exist <math>R, N > 0</math> such that for every two points <math>x, y \\in X</math> which are at least <math>R</math> apart there are at most <math>N</math> elements <math>g \\in G</math> satisfying <math>d(x, gx) < \\varepsilon</math> and <math>d(y, gy) < \\varepsilon </math>.</ref>\n\nA group is said to be acylindrically hyperbolic if it admits a non-elementary acylindrical action on a (''not necessarily proper'') Gromov-hyperbolic space. This notion includes mapping class groups via their actions on [[curve complex]]es. Lattices in higher-rank Lie groups are (still!) not acylindrically hyperbolic.\n\n=== CAT(0) groups ===\n\nIn another direction one can weaken the assumption about curvature in the examples above: a ''CAT(0) group'' is a group admitting a geometric action on a [[CAT(0) space]]. This includes [[Space group|Euclidean crystallographic groups]] and uniform lattices in higher-rank Lie groups.\n\nIt is not known whether there exists a hyperbolic group which is not CAT(0).<ref>http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1141526/are-all-delta-hyperbolic-groups-cat0</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite book\n| last1 = Bridson\n| first1 = Martin R.\n| last2 = Haefliger\n| first2 = André\n| title = Metric spaces of non-positive curvature\n| series = Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences]\n| volume = 319\n| publisher = Springer-Verlag\n| location = Berlin\n| year = 1999\n| isbn = 3-540-64324-9\n| nopp = true\n| page = xxii+643\n| mr = 1744486\n| doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-12494-9\n| ref = harv\n}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| last = Bowditch\n| first1 = Brian\n| title = A course on geometric group theory\n| series = Memoirs of the Math.

(''Proof.'' Let ''G'' be a locally finite group and ''S'' a subgroup. Every finitely generated subgroup of ''S'' is a (finitely generated) subgroup of ''G''.)\n* [[Hall's universal group]] is a countable locally finite group containing each ''countable locally finite'' group as subgroup.\n* Every group has a unique maximal normal locally finite subgroup {{harv|Robinson|1996|p=436}}\n* Every [[periodic group|periodic subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] over the complex numbers is locally finite.

If a locally finite group has a finite [[p-group|''p''-subgroup]] contained in no other ''p''-subgroups, then all maximal ''p''-subgroups are finite and conjugate.  If there are finitely many conjugates, then the number of conjugates is congruent to 1 modulo ''p''.  In fact, if every countable subgroup of a locally finite group has only countably many maximal ''p''-subgroups, then every maximal ''p''-subgroup of the group is conjugate {{harv|Robinson|1996|p=429}}.\n\nThe class of locally finite groups behaves somewhat similarly to the class of finite groups.  Much of the 1960s theory of formations and Fitting classes, as well as the older 19th century and 1930s theory of Sylow subgroups has an analogue in the theory of locally finite groups {{harv|Dixon|1994|p=v.}}.\n\nSimilarly to the [[Burnside problem]], mathematicians have wondered whether every infinite group contains an infinite [[abelian group|abelian subgroup]].  While this need not be true in general, a result of [[Philip Hall]] and others is that every infinite locally finite group contains an infinite abelian group.  The proof of this fact in infinite group theory relies upon the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] on the solubility of finite groups of odd order {{harv|Robinson|1996|p=432}}.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{Citation | last1=Dixon | first1=Martyn R. | title=Sylow theory, formations and Fitting classes in locally finite groups | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.

This is called the '''normalizer property''' and can be phrased simply as \"normalizers grow\".\n*(c) Every Sylow subgroup of ''G'' is normal.\n*(d) ''G'' is the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of its [[Sylow subgroup]]s.\n*(e) If ''d'' divides the [[Order of a group|order]] of ''G'', then ''G'' has a [[normal subgroup]] of order ''d''.\n\nProof:\n(a)→(b): By induction on |''G''|. If ''G'' is abelian, then for any ''H'', ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''H'')=''G''. If not, if ''Z''(''G'') is not contained in ''H'', then ''h''<sub>''Z''</sub>''H''<sub>''Z''</sub><sup>−1</sup>''h<sup>−1</sup>''=''h''''H''''h<sup>−1</sup>''=''H'', so ''H''·''Z''(''G'') normalizers ''H''. If ''Z''(''G'') is contained in ''H'',then ''H''/''Z''(''G'') is contained in ''G''/''Z''(''G''). Note, ''G''/''Z''(''G'') is a nilpotent group. Thus, there exists an subgroup of ''G''/''Z''(''G'') which normalizers ''H''/''Z''(''G'')  and ''H''/''Z''(''G'') is a proper subgroup of it. Therefore, pullback this subgroup to the subgroup in ''G'' and it normalizes ''H''. (This proof is the same argument as for ''p''-groups{{snd}}the only fact we needed was if ''G'' is nilpotent then so is ''G''/''Z''(''G''){{snd}}so the details are omitted.)\n\n(b)→(c): Let ''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>,...,''p''<sub>''s''</sub> be the distinct primes dividing its order and let ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''Syl''<sub>''p''<sub>''i''</sub></sub>(''G''),1≤''i''≤''s''. Let ''P''=''P''<sub>''i''</sub> for some ''i'' and let ''N''=''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''P''). Since ''P'' is a normal subgroup of ''N'', ''P'' is characteristic in ''N''. Since ''P'' char ''N'' and ''N'' is a normal subgroup of ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''N''), we get that ''P'' is a normal subgroup of ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''N''). This means ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'') is a subgroup of ''N'' and hence ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''N'')=''N''. By (b) we must therefore have ''N''=''G'', which gives (c).\n\n(c)→(d): Let ''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>,...,''p''<sub>''s''</sub> be the distinct primes dividing its order and let ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''Syl''<sub>''p''<sub>''i''</sub></sub>(''G''),1≤''i''≤''s''. For any ''t'', 1≤''t''≤''s'' we show inductively that ''P''<sub>1</sub>''P''<sub>2</sub>…''P''<sub>''t''</sub> is isomorphic to ''P''<sub>1</sub>×''P''<sub>2</sub>×…×''P''<sub>''t''</sub>.\nNote first that each ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> is normal in ''G'' so ''P''<sub>1</sub>''P''<sub>2</sub>…''P''<sub>''t''</sub> is a subgroup of ''G''. Let ''H'' be the product ''P''<sub>1</sub>''P''<sub>2</sub>…''P''<sub>''t-1''</sub> and let ''K''=''P''<sub>''t''</sub>,so by induction ''H'' is isomorphic to ''P''<sub>1</sub>×''P''<sub>2</sub>×…×''P''<sub>''t-1''</sub>. In particular,|''H''|=|''P''<sub>1</sub>|·|''P''<sub>2</sub>|·…·|''P''<sub>''t-1''</sub>|. Since |''K''|=|''P''<sub>''t''</sub>|, the orders of ''H'' and ''K'' are relatively prime. Lagrange's Theorem implies the intersection of ''H'' and ''K'' is equal to 1. By definition,''P''<sub>1</sub>''P''<sub>2</sub>…''P''<sub>''t''</sub>=''HK'', hence ''HK'' is isomorphic to ''H''×''K'' which is equal to ''P''<sub>1</sub>×''P''<sub>2</sub>×…×''P''<sub>''t''</sub>. This completes the induction. Now take ''t''=''s'' to obtain (d).\n\n(d)→(e): Note that a [[P-group]] of order ''p''<sup>''k''</sup> has a normal subgroup of order ''p''<sup>''m''</sup> for all 1≤''m''≤''k''. Since ''G'' is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and normality is preserved upon direct product of groups, ''G'' has a normal subgroup of order ''d'' for every divisor ''d'' of |''G''|.\n\n(e)→(a): For any prime ''p'' dividing |''G''|, the [[Sylow group|Sylow ''p''-subgroup]] is normal. Thus we can apply (c) (since we already proved (c)→(e)).\n\nStatement (d) can be extended to infinite groups: if ''G'' is a nilpotent group, then every Sylow subgroup ''G''<sub>''p''</sub> of ''G'' is normal, and the direct product of these Sylow subgroups is the subgroup of all elements of finite order in ''G'' (see [[torsion subgroup]]).\n\nMany properties of nilpotent groups are shared by [[hypercentral group]]s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |author=Bechtell, Homer |title=The Theory of Groups |publisher= [[Addison-Wesley]] |location= |year=1971 |oclc= |doi= }}\n* {{cite book |author-first=Friedrich | author-last= Von Haeseler |title=Automatic Sequences | series= De Gruyter Expositions in Mathematics | volume= 36 |publisher= [[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=Berlin |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=3-11-015629-6 |oclc= |doi= }}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Hungerford | author-first=Thomas W. | author-link=Thomas W.

      "text": "{{short description|Mathematical group with trivial abelianization}}\nIn [[mathematics]], more specifically in the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[group theory]], a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] is said to be '''perfect''' if it equals its own [[commutator subgroup]], or equivalently, if the group has no nontrivial [[abelian group|abelian]] [[quotient group|quotients]] (equivalently, its [[abelianization]], which is the universal abelian quotient, is trivial). In symbols, a perfect group is one such that ''G''<sup>(1)</sup> = ''G'' (the commutator subgroup equals the group), or equivalently one such that ''G''<sup>ab</sup> = {1} (its abelianization is trivial).\n\n== Examples ==\nThe smallest (non-trivial) perfect group is the [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>5</sub>. More generally, any non-[[abelian group|abelian]] [[simple group]] is perfect since the commutator subgroup is a [[normal subgroup]] with abelian quotient. Conversely, a perfect group need not be simple; for example, the [[special linear group]] over the field with 5 elements, SL(2,5) (or the [[binary icosahedral group]] which is isomorphic to it) is perfect but not simple (it has a non-trivial [[center (group)|center]] containing <math>\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{smallmatrix}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)</math>).\n\nMore generally, a [[quasisimple group]] (a perfect [[Central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of a simple group) which is a non-trivial extension (and therefore not a simple group itself) is perfect but not simple; this includes all the insoluble non-simple finite special linear groups SL(''n'',''q'') as extensions of the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(''n'',''q'') (SL(2,5) is an extension of PSL(2,5), which is isomorphic to ''A''<sub>5</sub>). Similarly, the special linear group over the real and complex numbers is perfect, but the general linear group GL is never perfect (except when trivial or over '''F'''<sub>2</sub>, where it equals the special linear group), as the [[determinant]] gives a non-trivial abelianization and indeed the commutator subgroup is SL.\n\nA non-trivial perfect group, however, is necessarily not [[solvable group|solvable]]; and 4 divides its order (if finite), moreover, if 8 does not divide the order, then 3 does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathoverflow.net/a/210974/34538|title=an answer|website=mathoverflow|date=7 July 2015|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nEvery [[acyclic group]] is perfect, but the converse is not true: ''A''<sub>5</sub> is perfect but not acyclic (in fact, not even [[Superperfect group|superperfect]]), see {{harv|Berrick|Hillman|2003}}. In fact, for ''n'' ≥ 5 the alternating group ''A<sub>n</sub>'' is perfect but not superperfect, with ''H''<sub>2</sub>(''A<sub>n</sub>'', '''Z''') = '''Z'''/2 for ''n'' ≥ 8.\n\nAny [[quotient group|quotient]] of a perfect group is perfect. A non-trivial finite perfect group which is not simple must then be an extension of at least one smaller simple non-abelian group. But it can be the extension of more than one simple group. In fact, the direct product of perfect groups is also perfect.\n\nEvery perfect group ''G'' determines another perfect group ''E'' (its [[universal central extension]]) together with a surjection ''f:E'' → ''G'' whose kernel is in the center of ''E,''\nsuch that ''f'' is universal with this property. The kernel of ''f'' is called the [[Schur multiplier]] of ''G'' because it was first studied by [[Issai Schur|Schur]] in 1904; it is isomorphic to the\nhomology group ''H<sub>2</sub>(G)''.\n\nIn the '''plus construction''' of [[algebraic K-theory]], if we consider the group <math>GL(A) = \\text{colim} GL_n(A)</math> for a commutative ring <math>A</math>, then the subgroup of elementary matrices <math>E(R)</math> forms a perfect subgroup.\n\n== Ore's conjecture ==\nAs the commutator subgroup is ''generated'' by commutators, a perfect group may contain elements that are products of commutators but not themselves commutators. [[Øystein Ore]] proved in 1951 that the alternating groups on five or more elements contained only commutators, and made the conjecture that this was so for all the finite non-abelian simple groups. Ore's conjecture was finally proven in 2008. The proof relies on the [[classification of finite simple groups|classification theorem]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liebeck|first1=O'Brien|last2=Shalev|first2=Aner|authorlink2=Aner Shalev|title=The Ore conjecture|url=https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~obrien/research/ore.pdf|journal=J.

If ''H'' and ''K'' are subgroups of ''G'', denote the [[commutator]] of ''H'' and ''K'' by [''H'', ''K''] and note that [''Z''<sub>1</sub>, ''G''] = 1 and [''Z''<sub>2</sub>, ''G''] ⊆ ''Z''<sub>1</sub>, and consequently (the convention that [''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''] = [[''X'', ''Y''], ''Z''] is followed):\n\n:<math>[Z_2,G,G]=[[Z_2,G],G]\\subseteq [Z_1,G]=1</math>\n:<math>[G,Z_2,G]=[[G,Z_2],G]=[[Z_2,G],G]\\subseteq [Z_1,G]=1.</math>\n\nBy the [[three subgroups lemma]] (or equivalently, by the [[Commutator#Identities (group theory)|Hall-Witt identity]]), it follows that [''G'', ''Z''<sub>2</sub>] = [[''G'', ''G''], ''Z''<sub>2</sub>] = [''G'', ''G'', ''Z''<sub>2</sub>] = {1}. Therefore, ''Z''<sub>2</sub> ⊆ ''Z''<sub>1</sub> = ''Z''(''G''), and the center of the quotient group ''G'' ⁄ ''Z''(''G'') is the [[trivial group]].</blockquote>\n\nAs a consequence, all [[Center (group theory)#Higher centers|higher centers]] (that is, higher terms in the [[upper central series]]) of a perfect group equal the center.\n\n==Group homology==\nIn terms of [[group homology]], a perfect group is precisely one whose first homology group vanishes: ''H''<sub>1</sub>(''G'', '''Z''') = 0, as the first homology group of a group is exactly the abelianization of the group, and perfect means trivial abelianization. An advantage of this definition is that it admits strengthening:\n* A [[superperfect group]] is one whose first two homology groups vanish: ''H''<sub>1</sub>(''G'', '''Z''')  = ''H''<sub>2</sub>(''G'', '''Z''')  = 0.\n* An [[acyclic group]] is one ''all'' of whose (reduced) homology groups vanish <math>\\tilde H_i(G;\\mathbf{Z}) = 0.</math> (This is equivalent to all homology groups other than ''H''<sub>0</sub> vanishing.)\n\n==Quasi-perfect group==\nEspecially in the field of [[algebraic K-theory]], a group is said to be '''quasi-perfect''' if its commutator subgroup is perfect; in symbols, a quasi-perfect group is one such that ''G''<sup>(1)</sup> = ''G''<sup>(2)</sup> (the commutator of the commutator subgroup is the commutator subgroup), while a perfect group is one such that ''G''<sup>(1)</sup> = ''G'' (the commutator subgroup is the whole group).

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''random groups''' are certain [[Group (mathematics)|group]]s obtained by a [[probabilistic]] construction. They were introduced by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Misha Gromov]] to answer questions such as \"What does a typical group look like?\"\n\nIt so happens that, once a precise definition is given, random groups satisfy some properties with very high probability, whereas other properties fail with very high probability. For instance, very probably random groups are [[hyperbolic group]]s. In this sense, one can say that \"most groups are hyperbolic\".\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe definition of random groups depends on a probabilistic model on the set of possible groups. Various such probabilistic models yield different (but related) notions of random groups.\n\nAny group can be defined by a [[Presentation of a group|group presentation]] involving generators and relations. For instance, the Abelian group <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}</math> has a presentation with two generators <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, and the relation <math>ab=ba</math>, or equivalently <math>aba^{-1}b^{-1}=1</math>. The main idea of random groups is to start with a fixed number of group generators <math>a_1,\\,a_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_m</math>, and imposing relations of the form <math>r_1=1,\\,r_2=1,\\,\\ldots,\\,r_k=1</math> where each <math>r_j</math> is a random word involving the letters <math>a_i</math> and their formal inverses <math>a_i^{-1}</math>. To specify a model of random groups is to specify a precise way in which <math>m</math>, <math>k</math> and the random relations <math>r_j</math> are chosen.\n\nOnce the random relations <math>r_k</math> have been chosen, the resulting random group <math>G</math> is defined in the standard way for group presentations, namely: <math>G</math> is the quotient of the [[free group]] <math>F_m</math> with generators <math>a_1,\\,a_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_m</math>, by the normal subgroup <math>R\\subset F_m</math> generated by the relations <math>r_1\\,r_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,r_k</math> seen as elements of <math>F_m</math>:\n\n: <math>G=F_m/\\langle r_1,\\,r_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,r_k \\rangle.</math>\n\n==The few-relator model of random groups==\n\nThe simplest model of random groups is the ''few-relator model''. In this model, a number of generators <math>m\\geq 2</math> and a number of relations <math>k\\geq 1</math> are fixed. Fix an additional parameter <math>\\ell</math> (the length of the relations), which is typically taken very large.\n\nThen, the model consists in choosing the relations <math>r_1\\,r_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,r_k</math> at random, uniformly and independently among all possible [[reduced word]]s of length at most <math>\\ell</math> involving the letters <math>a_i</math> and their formal inverses <math>a_i^{-1}</math>.\n\nThis model is especially interesting when the relation length <math>\\ell</math> tends to infinity:  with probability tending to <math>1</math> as <math>\\ell\\to\\infty</math> a random group in this model is [[hyperbolic group|hyperbolic]] and satisfies other nice properties.\n\n==Further remarks==\n\nMore refined models of random groups have been defined.\n\nFor instance, in the ''density model'', the number of relations is allowed to grow with the length of the relations. Then there is a sharp \"phase transition\" phenomenon: if the number of relations is larger than some threshold, the random group \"collapses\" (because the relations allow to show that any word is equal to any other), whereas below the threshold the resulting random group is infinite and hyperbolic.\n\nConstructions of random groups can also be twisted in specific ways to build group with particular properties. For instance, Gromov used this technique to build new groups that are counter-examples to an extension of the [[Baum-Connes conjecture]].\n\n== References ==\n\n* [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]].

In particular, a [[Generating set of a group|finitely generated]] group with property FA has finite [[Derived group|abelianization]].\n\nProperty FA is equivalent for [[Countable set|countable]] ''G''  to the three properties: ''G'' is not an amalgamated product; ''G'' does not have '''Z''' as a [[quotient group]]; ''G'' is [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]].  For general groups ''G'' the third condition may be replaced by requiring that ''G'' not be the union of a strictly increasing sequence of subgroup.\n\nExamples of groups with property FA include SL<sub>3</sub>('''Z''') and more generally ''G''('''Z''') where ''G'' is a simply-connected simple [[Chevalley group]] of rank at least 2.

      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''simple group''' is a nontrivial [[Group (mathematics)|group]] whose only [[normal subgroup]]s are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself.  A group that is not simple can be broken into two smaller groups, namely a nontrivial normal subgroup and the corresponding [[quotient group]]. This process can be repeated, and for [[finite group]]s one eventually arrives at uniquely determined simple groups, by the [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]].\n\nThe complete [[classification of finite simple groups]], completed in 2004, is a major milestone in the history of mathematics.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Finite simple groups ===\nThe [[cyclic group]] ''G'' = '''Z'''/3'''Z''' of [[congruence class]]es [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 3 (see  [[modular arithmetic]]) is simple. If ''H'' is a subgroup of this group, its [[Order (group theory)|order]] (the number of elements) must be a [[divisor]] of the order of ''G'' which is 3. Since 3 is prime, its only divisors are 1 and 3, so either ''H'' is ''G'', or ''H'' is the trivial group. On the other hand, the group ''G'' = '''Z'''/12'''Z''' is not simple. The set ''H'' of congruence classes of 0, 4, and 8 modulo 12 is a subgroup of order 3, and it is a normal subgroup since any subgroup of an [[abelian group]] is normal. Similarly, the additive group '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is not simple; the set of even integers is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.<ref>Knapp (2006), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=KVeXG163BggC|page=170|text=Z is not simple, having the nontrivial subgroup 2Z}} p. 170]</ref>\n\nOne may use the same kind of reasoning for any abelian group, to deduce that the only simple abelian groups are the cyclic groups of [[prime number|prime]] order. The classification of nonabelian simple groups is far less trivial. The smallest nonabelian simple group is the [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>5</sub> of order 60, and every simple group of order 60 is [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''A''<sub>5</sub>.<ref>Rotman (1995), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=lYrsiaHSHKcC|page=226|text=simple groups of order 60 are isomorphic}} p. 226]</ref> The second smallest nonabelian simple group is the projective special linear group [[PSL(2,7)]] of order 168, and it is possible to prove that every simple group of order 168 is isomorphic to [[PSL(2,7)]].<ref>Rotman (1995), p. 281</ref><ref>Smith & Tabachnikova (2000), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=DD0TW28WjfQC|page=144|text=any two simple groups of order 168 are isomorphic}} p. 144]</ref>\n\n=== Infinite simple groups ===\nThe infinite alternating group, i.e. the group of even finitely supported permutations of the integers, <math>A_\\infty</math> is simple. This group can be written as the increasing union of the finite simple groups <math>A_n</math> with respect to standard embeddings <math>A_n\\to A_{n+1}</math>. Another family of examples of infinite simple groups is given by <math>\\mathrm{PSL}_n(F)</math>, where <math>F</math> is an infinite field and <math>n\\geq 2</math>.\n\nIt is much more difficult to construct ''finitely generated'' infinite simple groups. The first existence result is non-explicit; it is due to [[Graham Higman]] and consists of simple quotients of the [[Higman group]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Higman | first1=Graham | author1-link=Graham Higman | title=A finitely generated infinite simple group | doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-26.1.59  |mr=0038348 | year=1951 | journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society |series=Second Series | issn=0024-6107 | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=61–64}}</ref> Explicit examples, which turn out to be finitely presented, include the infinite [[Thompson groups]] ''T'' and ''V''.

This is expressed by the [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] which states that any two [[composition series]] of a given group have the same length and the same factors, [[up to]] [[permutation]] and [[isomorphism]]. In a huge collaborative effort, the [[classification of finite simple groups]] was declared accomplished in 1983 by [[Daniel Gorenstein]], though some problems surfaced (specifically in the classification of [[quasithin group]]s, which were plugged in 2004).\n\nBriefly, finite simple groups are classified as lying in one of 18 families, or being one of 26 exceptions:\n* Z<sub>''p''</sub> – [[cyclic group]] of prime order\n* ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> – [[alternating group]] for <math>n \\geq 5</math>\n*:The alternating groups may be considered as groups of Lie type over the [[field with one element]], which unites this family with the next, and thus all families of non-abelian finite simple groups may be considered to be of Lie type.\n* One of 16 families of [[groups of Lie type]]\n*:The [[Tits group]] is generally considered of this form, though strictly speaking it is not of Lie type, but rather index 2 in a group of Lie type.\n* One of 26 exceptions, the [[sporadic group]]s, of which 20 are subgroups or [[subquotient]]s of the [[monster group]] and are referred to as the \"Happy Family\", while the remaining 6 are referred to as [[pariah group|pariahs]].\n\n== Structure of finite simple groups ==\nThe famous [[Feit–Thompson theorem|theorem]] of [[Walter Feit|Feit]] and [[John G. Thompson|Thompson]] states that every group of odd order is [[solvable group|solvable]]. Therefore, every finite simple group has even order unless it is cyclic of prime order.\n\nThe [[Schreier conjecture]] asserts that the group of [[outer automorphism]]s of every finite simple group is solvable.  This can be proved using the classification theorem.\n\n== History for finite simple groups ==\nThere are two threads in the history of finite simple groups – the discovery and construction of specific simple groups and families, which took place from the work of Galois in the 1820s to the construction of the Monster in 1981; and proof that this list was complete, which began in the 19th century, most significantly took place 1955 through 1983 (when victory was initially declared), but was only generally agreed to be finished in 2004. {{as of|2010}}, work on improving the proofs and understanding continues; see {{Harv|Silvestri|1979}} for 19th century history of simple groups.\n\n=== Construction ===\nSimple groups have been studied at least since early [[Galois theory]], where [[Évariste Galois]] realized that the fact that the [[alternating group]]s on five or more points are simple (and hence not solvable), which he proved in 1831, was the reason that one could not solve the quintic in radicals. Galois also constructed the [[projective special linear group]] of a plane over a prime finite field, PSL(2,''p''), and remarked that they were simple for ''p'' not 2 or 3. This is contained in his last letter to Chevalier,<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\">{{Citation\n | last = Galois\n | first = Évariste\n | year = 1846\n | title = Lettre de Galois à M.

Since these five groups were constructed by methods which did not yield infinitely many possibilities, they were called \"[[sporadic group|sporadic]]\" by [[William Burnside]] in his 1897 textbook.\n\nLater Jordan's results on classical groups were generalized to arbitrary finite fields by [[Leonard Dickson]], following the classification of [[complex simple Lie algebra]]s by [[Wilhelm Killing]]. Dickson also constructed exception groups of type G<sub>2</sub> and [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]] as well, but not of types F<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, or E<sub>8</sub> {{harv|Wilson|2009|p=2}}. In the 1950s the work on groups of Lie type was continued, with [[Claude Chevalley]] giving a uniform construction of the classical groups and the groups of exceptional type in a 1955 paper. This omitted certain known groups (the projective unitary groups), which were obtained by \"twisting\" the Chevalley construction. The remaining groups of Lie type were produced by Steinberg, Tits, and Herzig (who produced <sup>3</sup>''D''<sub>4</sub>(''q'') and <sup>2</sup>''E''<sub>6</sub>(''q'')) and by Suzuki and Ree (the [[Suzuki–Ree group]]s).\n\nThese groups (the groups of Lie type, together with the cyclic groups, alternating groups, and the five exceptional Mathieu groups) were believed to be a complete list, but after a lull of almost a century since the work of Mathieu, in 1964 the first [[Janko group]] was discovered, and the remaining 20 sporadic groups were discovered or conjectured in 1965–1975, culminating in 1981, when [[Robert Griess]] announced that he had constructed [[Bernd Fischer (mathematician)|Bernd Fischer]]'s \"[[Monster group]]\". The Monster is the largest sporadic simple group having order of 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000. The Monster has a faithful 196,883-dimensional representation in the 196,884-dimensional [[Griess algebra]], meaning that each element of the Monster can be expressed as a 196,883 by 196,883 matrix.\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe full classification is generally accepted as starting with the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] of 1962/63, largely lasting until 1983, but only being finished in 2004.\n\nSoon after the construction of the Monster in 1981, a proof, totaling more than 10,000 pages, was supplied that group theorists had successfully [[List of finite simple groups|listed all finite simple groups]], with victory declared in 1983 by Daniel Gorenstein. This was premature – some gaps were later discovered, notably in the classification of [[quasithin group]]s, which were eventually replaced in 2004 by a 1,300 page classification of quasithin groups, which is now generally accepted as complete.\n\n==Tests for nonsimplicity==\n''[[Sylow theorems#Example applications|Sylow's test]]'': Let ''n'' be a positive integer that is not prime, and let ''p'' be a prime divisor of ''n''. If 1 is the only divisor of ''n'' that is equal to 1 modulo p, then there does not exist a simple group of order ''n''.\n\nProof: If ''n'' is a prime-power, then a group of order ''n'' has a nontrivial [[center (group theory)|center]]<ref>See the proof in [[p-group]], for instance.</ref> and, therefore, is not simple. If ''n'' is not a prime power, then every Sylow subgroup is proper, and, by [[Sylow theorems|Sylow's Third Theorem]], we know that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order ''n'' is equal to 1 modulo ''p'' and divides ''n''. Since 1 is the only such number, the Sylow p-subgroup is unique, and therefore it is normal. Since it is a proper, non-identity subgroup, the group is not simple.\n\n''Burnside'': A non-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes. This follows from [[Burnside theorem|Burnside's p-q theorem]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Almost simple group]]\n* [[Characteristically simple group]]\n* [[Quasisimple group]]\n* [[Semisimple group]]\n* [[List of finite simple groups]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Textbooks ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wilson | first1=Robert A. | authorlink = Robert Arnott Wilson | title=The finite simple groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] 251 | isbn=978-1-84800-987-5 | doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2 | zbl=1203.20012 | year=2009 | postscript =, [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html 2007 preprint]. | volume=251 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Burnside | first1=William | author1-link=William Burnside | title=Theory of groups of finite order | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1897}}\n{{refend}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Knapp |first1=Anthony W. |last2= |first2= |title=Basic algebra |url= |edition= |volume= |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8176-3248-9 }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Rotman |first1=Joseph J. |last2= |first2= |title=An introduction to the theory of groups |url= |edition= |series=Graduate texts in mathematics |volume=148 |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-94285-8 }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Smith |first1=Geoff |last2=Tabachnikova |first2=Olga |title=Topics in group theory |url= |edition=2 |series=Springer undergraduate mathematics series |volume= |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-85233-235-8 |doi= }}\n\n=== Papers ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation \n| doi = 10.1007/BF00327738 \n| title = Simple groups of finite order in the nineteenth century \n| date=September 1979 | last = Silvestri | first = R.\n| journal = Archive for History of Exact Sciences \n| volume = 20\n| pages = 313–356 \n| issue = 3–4\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{planetmath reference|id=3569|title=The alternating group A_n is simple}}\n\n[[Category:Properties of groups]]"

      "title": "Solvable group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvable_group",
      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], more specifically in the field of [[group theory]], a '''solvable group''' or '''soluble group''' is a group that can be constructed from [[abelian group]]s using [[Group extension|extensions]].  Equivalently, a solvable group is a group whose [[derived series]] terminates in the [[trivial subgroup]].\n\nHistorically, the word \"solvable\" arose from [[Galois theory]] and the [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the general unsolvability of [[quintic]] equation.  Specifically, a [[polynomial equation]] is solvable by [[Nth root|radicals]] if and only if the corresponding [[Galois group]] is solvable.\n\n==Definition==\nA group ''G'' is called '''solvable''' if it has a [[subnormal series]] whose [[factor group]]s (quotient groups) are all [[Abelian group|abelian]], that is, if there are subgroups 1 = ''G''<sub>0</sub> < ''G''<sub>1</sub> < ⋅⋅⋅ < ''G<sub>k</sub>'' = ''G'' such that ''G''<sub>''j''−1</sub> is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in ''G<sub>j</sub>'', and ''G<sub>j</sub>''/''G''<sub>''j''−1</sub> is an abelian group, for ''j'' = 1, 2, &hellip;, ''k''. \n\nOr equivalently, if its [[derived series]], the descending normal series\n:<math>G\\triangleright G^{(1)}\\triangleright G^{(2)} \\triangleright \\cdots,</math>\nwhere every subgroup is the [[commutator subgroup]] of the previous one, eventually reaches the trivial subgroup of ''G''. These two definitions are equivalent, since for every group ''H'' and every [[normal subgroup]] ''N'' of ''H'', the quotient ''H''/''N'' is abelian [[if and only if]] ''N'' includes ''H''<sup>(1)</sup>. The least ''n'' such that ''G''<sup>(''n'')</sup> = 1 is called the '''derived length''' of the solvable group ''G''.\n\nFor finite groups, an equivalent definition is that a solvable group is a group with a [[composition series]] all of whose factors are [[cyclic groups]] of [[prime number|prime]] [[order (group theory)|order]]. This is equivalent because a finite group has finite composition length, and every [[simple group|simple]] abelian group is cyclic of prime order. The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] guarantees that if one composition series has this property, then all composition series will have this property as well. For the Galois group of a polynomial, these cyclic groups correspond to ''n''th roots (radicals) over some field. The equivalence does not necessarily hold for infinite groups: for example, since every nontrivial subgroup of the group '''Z''' of integers under addition is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to '''Z''' itself, it has no composition series, but the normal series {0, '''Z'''}, with its only factor group isomorphic to '''Z''', proves that it is in fact solvable.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nAll abelian groups are trivially solvable – a subnormal series being given by just the group itself and the trivial group. But non-abelian groups may or may not be solvable.\n\nMore generally, all [[nilpotent group]]s are solvable. In particular, finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]] are solvable, as all finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]] are nilpotent.\n\nA small example of a solvable, non-nilpotent group is the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>3</sub>.\nIn fact, as the smallest simple non-abelian group is ''A''<sub>5</sub>, (the [[alternating group]] of degree 5) it follows that ''every'' group with order less than 60 is solvable. \n\nThe group ''S''<sub>5</sub> is not solvable &mdash; it has a composition series {E, ''A''<sub>5</sub>, ''S''<sub>5</sub>} (and the [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] states that every other composition series is equivalent to that one), giving factor groups isomorphic to ''A''<sub>5</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub>; and ''A''<sub>5</sub> is not abelian. Generalizing this argument, coupled with the fact that ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> is a normal, maximal, non-abelian simple subgroup of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > 4, we see that ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> is not solvable for ''n'' > 4. This is a key step in the proof that for every ''n'' > 4 there are [[polynomial]]s of degree ''n'' which are not solvable by radicals ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). This property is also used in complexity theory in the proof of [[NC (complexity)|Barrington's theorem]].\n\nThe celebrated [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] states that every finite group of odd order is solvable. In particular this implies that if a finite group is simple, it is either a prime cyclic or of even order.\n\nAny finite group whose [[Sylow group|''p''-Sylow subgroups]] are cyclic is a [[semidirect product]] of two cyclic groups, in particular solvable.  Such groups are called [[Z-group]]s.\n\nNumbers of solvable groups with order ''n'' are (start with ''n'' = 0)\n:0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 15, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 4, 1, 51, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 2, 2, 14, 1, 6, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 52, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 15, 2, 13, 2, 2, 1, 12, 1, 2, 4, 267, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 50, ... {{OEIS|id=A201733}}\n\nOrders of non-solvable groups are\n:60, 120, 168, 180, 240, 300, 336, 360, 420, 480, 504, 540, 600, 660, 672, 720, 780, 840, 900, 960, 1008, 1020, 1080, 1092, 1140, 1176, 1200, 1260, 1320, 1344, 1380, 1440, 1500, ... {{OEIS|id=A056866}}\n\n== Properties ==\n\nSolvability is closed under a number of operations.\n\n* If ''G'' is solvable, and there is a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] from ''G'' [[surjective|onto]] ''H'', then ''H'' is solvable; equivalently (by the [[Isomorphism theorem#First isomorphism theorem|first isomorphism theorem]]), if ''G'' is solvable, and ''N'' is a normal subgroup of ''G'', then ''G''/''N'' is solvable.<ref>Rotman (1995), {{Google books|id=lYrsiaHSHKcC|page=102|text=Every quotient of a solvable group is solvable|title=Theorem 5.16}}</ref>\n* The previous property can be expanded into the following property: ''G'' is solvable if and only if both ''N'' and ''G''/''N'' are solvable.\n* If ''G'' is solvable, and ''H'' is a subgroup of ''G'', then ''H'' is solvable.<ref>Rotman (1995), {{Google books|id=lYrsiaHSHKcC|page=102|text=Every subgroup H of a solvable group G is itself solvable|title=Theorem 5.15}}</ref>\n* If ''G'' and ''H'' are solvable, the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] ''G'' &times; ''H'' is solvable.\n\nSolvability is closed under [[group extension]]:\n* If ''H'' and ''G''/''H'' are solvable, then so is ''G''; in particular, if ''N'' and ''H'' are solvable, their [[semidirect product]] is also solvable.\n\nIt is also closed under wreath product:\n* If ''G'' and ''H'' are solvable, and ''X'' is a ''G''-set, then the [[wreath product]] of ''G'' and ''H'' with respect to ''X'' is also solvable.\n\nFor any positive integer ''N'', the solvable groups of [[derived length]] at most ''N'' form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|subvariety]] of the variety of groups, as they are closed under the taking of [[homomorphism|homomorphic]] images, [[subalgebra]]s, and [[Direct product of groups|(direct) products]].  The direct product of a sequence of solvable groups with unbounded derived length is not solvable, so the class of all solvable groups is not a variety.\n\n==Burnside's theorem==\n{{main|Burnside theorem}}\nBurnside's theorem states that if ''G''  is a [[finite group]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]] ''p<sup>a</sup>q<sup>b</sup>'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are [[prime number]]s, and ''a'' and ''b''  are [[negative and positive numbers|non-negative]] [[integer]]s, then ''G'' is solvable.\n\n==Related concepts==\n\n===Supersolvable groups===\n{{main|supersolvable group}}\nAs a strengthening of solvability, a group ''G'' is called '''supersolvable''' (or '''supersoluble''') if it has an ''invariant'' normal series whose factors are all cyclic. Since a normal series has finite length by definition, [[uncountable]] groups are not supersolvable. In fact, all supersolvable groups are [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]], and an abelian group is supersolvable if and only if it is finitely generated. The alternating group ''A''<sub>4</sub> is an example of a finite solvable group that is not supersolvable.\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to finitely generated groups, we can consider the following arrangement of classes of groups:\n\n:[[cyclic group|cyclic]] < [[abelian group|abelian]] < [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] < [[supersolvable group|supersolvable]] < [[polycyclic group|polycyclic]] < '''solvable''' < [[finitely generated group]].\n\n===Virtually solvable groups===\nA group ''G'' is called '''virtually solvable''' if it has a solvable subgroup of finite index.  This is similar to [[virtually abelian]].  Clearly all solvable groups are virtually solvable, since one can just choose the group itself, which has index 1.\n\n===Hypoabelian===\nA solvable group is one whose derived series reaches the trivial subgroup at a ''finite'' stage.  For an infinite group, the finite derived series may not stabilize, but the transfinite derived series always stabilizes.  A group whose transfinite derived series reaches the trivial group is called a '''[[perfect core|hypoabelian group]]''', and every solvable group is a hypoabelian group.  The first ordinal ''α'' such that ''G''<sup>(''α'')</sup> = ''G''<sup>(''α''+1)</sup> is called the (transfinite) derived length of the group ''G'', and it has been shown that every ordinal is the derived length of some group {{harv|Malcev|1949}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Prosolvable group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refimprove|date=January 2008}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Malcev | first1=A.

If <math>h^*_1,h^*_2, \\dots ,h^*_n \\dots \\in G</math> are chosen such that <math>h^*_n \\mapsto h_n</math> for all ''n'', then they must freely generate a free subgroup of ''G''. Hence:\n\n:Every SQ-universal group has as a subgroup, a free group on countably many generators.\n\nSince every countable group can be embedded in a countable [[simple group]], it is often sufficient to consider embeddings of simple groups. This observation allows us to easily prove some elementary results about SQ-universal groups, for instance:\n\n:If ''G'' is an SQ-universal group and ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'' (i.e. <math>N\\triangleleft G</math>) then either ''N'' is SQ-universal or the [[quotient group]] ''G''/''N'' is SQ-universal.\n\nTo prove this suppose ''N'' is not SQ-universal, then there is a countable group ''K'' that cannot be embedded into a quotient group of ''N''. Let ''H'' be any countable group, then the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] ''H'' × ''K'' is also countable and hence can be embedded in a countable simple group ''S''. Now, by hypotheseis, ''G'' is SQ-universal so ''S'' can be embedded in a quotient group, ''G''/''M'', say, of ''G''.  The second [[isomorphism theorem]] tells us:\n\n:<math>MN/M \\cong N/(M \\cap N)</math>\n\nNow <math>MN/M\\triangleleft G/M</math> and ''S'' is a simple subgroup of ''G''/''M'' so either:\n\n:<math>MN/M \\cap S \\cong 1</math>\n\nor:\n\n:<math>S\\subseteq MN/M \\cong N/(M \\cap N)</math>.\n\nThe latter cannot be true because it implies ''K'' ⊆ ''H'' × ''K'' ⊆ ''S'' ⊆ ''N''/(''M'' ∩ ''N'') contrary to our choice of ''K''. It follows that ''S'' can be embedded in (''G''/''M'')/(''MN''/''M''), which by the third [[isomorphism theorem]] is isomorphic to ''G''/''MN'', which is in turn isomorphic to (''G''/''N'')/(''MN''/''N''). Thus ''S'' has been embedded into a quotient group of ''G''/''N'', and since ''H'' ⊆ ''S'' was an arbitrary countable group, it follows that ''G''/''N'' is SQ-universal.\n\nSince every [[subgroup]] ''H'' of [[finite index]] in a group ''G'' contains a normal subgroup ''N'' also of finite index in ''G'',<ref>Lawson, Mark V. (1998) ''Inverse semigroups: the theory of partial symmetries'', World Scientific.  {{ISBN|981-02-3316-7}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=2805q4tFiCkC|page=52|text=every subgroup of finite index contains a normal subgroup of finite index}} p. 52]</ref> it easily follows that:\n\n:If a group ''G'' is  SQ-universal then so is any finite index subgroup ''H'' of ''G''. The converse of this statement is also true.<ref>P.M. Neumann: The SQ-universality of some finitely presented groups. J. Austral. Math. Soc. 16, 1-6 (1973)</ref>\n\n==Variants and generalizations of SQ-universality==\nSeveral variants of SQ-universality occur in the literature. The reader should be warned that terminology in this area is not yet completely stable and should read this section with this caveat in mind.\n\nLet <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> be a class of groups. (For the purposes of this section, groups are defined ''up to [[isomorphism]]'') A group ''G'' is called '''SQ-universal in the class <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>''' if <math>G\\in \\mathcal{P}</math> and every countable group in <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is isomorphic to a subgroup of a quotient of ''G''. The following result can be proved:\n\n: Let ''n'', ''m'' ∈ '''Z''' where ''m'' is odd, <math>n>10^{78}</math> and ''m'' > 1, and let ''B''(''m'', ''n'') be the free m-generator [[Burnside group]], then every non-[[cyclic group|cyclic]] subgroup of ''B''(''m'', ''n'') is SQ-universal in the class of groups of exponent ''n''.\n\nLet <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> be a class of groups. A group ''G'' is called '''SQ-universal for the class <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>''' if every group in <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is isomorphic to a subgroup of a quotient of ''G''. Note that there is no requirement that <math>G\\in \\mathcal{P}</math> nor that any groups be countable.\n\nThe standard definition of SQ-universality is equivalent to SQ-universality both ''in'' and ''for'' the class of countable groups.\n\nGiven a countable group ''G'', call an SQ-universal group ''H'' '''''G''-stable''', if every non-trivial factor group of ''H'' contains a copy of ''G''. Let <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> be the class of finitely presented SQ-universal groups that are ''G''-stable for some ''G'' then Houcine's version of the HNN theorem that can be re-stated as:\n\n: The free group on two generators is SQ-universal ''for'' <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>.\n\nHowever there are uncountably many finitely generated groups, and a countable group can only have countably many finitely generated subgroups. It is easy to see from this that:\n\n: No group can be SQ-universal ''in'' <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>.\n\nAn [[Infinity|infinite]] class <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> of groups is '''wrappable''' if given any groups <math>F,G\\in \\mathcal{P}</math> there exists a simple group ''S'' and a group <math>H\\in \\mathcal{P}</math> such that ''F'' and ''G'' can be embedded in ''S'' and ''S'' can be embedded in ''H''. The it is easy to prove:\n\n:If <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is a wrappable class of groups, ''G'' is an SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> and <math>N\\triangleleft G</math> then either ''N'' is SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> or ''G''/''N'' is SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>.\n\n:If <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is a wrappable class of groups and ''H'' is of finite index in ''G'' then ''G'' is SQ-universal for the class <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> if and only if ''H'' is SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>.\n\nThe motivation for the definition of wrappable class comes from results such as the [[Boone-Higman theorem]], which states that a countable group ''G'' has soluble word problem if and only if it can be embedded in a simple group ''S'' that can be embedded in a finitely presented group ''F''.  Houcine has shown that the group ''F'' can be constructed so that it too has soluble word problem. This together with the fact that taking the direct product of two groups preserves solubility of the word problem shows that:\n\n:The class of all [[finitely-presented group|finitely presented]] groups with soluble [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]] is wrappable.\n\nOther examples of wrappable classes of groups are:\n*The class of [[finite group]]s.\n*The class of torsion free groups.\n*The class of countable torsion free groups.\n*The class of all groups of a given infinite [[cardinality]].\n\nThe fact that a class <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is wrappable does not imply that any groups are SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>. It is clear, for instance, that some sort of cardinality restriction for the members of <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is required.\n\nIf we replace the phrase \"isomorphic to a subgroup of a quotient of\" with \"isomorphic to a subgroup of\" in the definition of \"SQ-universal\", we obtain the stronger concept of '''S-universal''' (respectively '''S-universal for/in <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>'''). The Higman Embedding Theorem can be used to prove that there is a finitely presented group that contains a copy of every finitely presented group. If <math>\\mathcal{W}</math> is the class of all finitely presented groups with soluble word problem, then it is known that there is no uniform [[algorithm]] to solve the word problem for groups in <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>. It follows, although the proof is not a straightforward as one might expect, that no group in <math>\\mathcal{W}</math> can contain a copy of every group in <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>. But it is clear that any SQ-universal group is ''a fortiori'' SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>. If we let <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> be the class of finitely presented groups, and ''F''<sub>2</sub> be the free group on two generators, we can sum this up as:\n*''F''<sub>2</sub> is SQ-universal in <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>.\n*There exists a group that is S-universal in <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>.\n*No group is S-universal in <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>.\n\nThe following questions are open (the second implies the first):\n*Is there a countable group that is not SQ-universal but is SQ-universal ''for'' <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>?\n*Is there a countable group that is not SQ-universal but is SQ-universal ''in'' <math>\\mathcal{W}</math>?\n\nWhile it is quite difficult to prove that ''F''<sub>2</sub> is SQ-universal, the fact that it is SQ-universal ''for the class of finite groups'' follows easily from these two facts:\n* Every [[symmetric group]] on a finite set can be generated by two elements\n* Every finite group can be embedded inside a symmetric group&mdash;the natural one being the [[Cayley group]], which is the symmetric group acting on this group as the finite set.\n\n==SQ-universality in other categories==\nIf <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is a category and <math>\\mathcal{P}</math> is a class of [[Object (category theory)|object]]s of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, then the definition of ''SQ-universal for <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>'' clearly makes sense. If <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is a [[concrete category]], then the definition of ''SQ-universal in <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>'' also makes sense. As in the group theoretic case, we use the term SQ-universal for an object that is SQ-universal both ''for'' and ''in'' the class of countable objects of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>.\n\nMany embedding theorems can be restated in terms of SQ-universality. Shirshov's Theorem that a [[Lie algebra]] of finite or countable dimension can be embedded into a 2-generator Lie algebra is equivalent to the statement that the 2-generator free Lie algebra is SQ-universal (in the category of Lie algebras). This can be proved by proving a version of the Higman, Neumann, Neumann theorem for Lie algebras.<ref>A.I. Lichtman and M. Shirvani, 'HNN-extensions of Lie algebras', Proc. American Math. Soc.

It follows from the definition that the theory of a group of finite Morley rank is [[ω-stable]]; therefore groups of finite Morley rank are stable groups. Groups of finite Morley rank behave in certain ways like finite-dimensional objects. The striking similarities between groups of finite Morley rank and finite groups are an object of active research.\n*All finite groups have finite Morley rank, in fact rank 0.\n*Algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields have finite Morley rank, equal to their dimension as algebraic sets.\n*{{harvtxt|Sela|2006}} showed that free groups, and more generally torsion free hyperbolic groups, are stable. Free groups on more than one generator are not [[superstable]].\n\n==The Cherlin–Zilber conjecture==\nThe '''Cherlin–Zilber conjecture''' (also called the '''algebraicity conjecture'''), due to Gregory {{harvtxt|Cherlin|1979}} and Boris {{harvtxt|Zilber|1977}}, suggests that infinite (ω-stable) [[simple groups]] are simple [[algebraic group]]s over [[algebraically closed field]]s.  The conjecture would have followed from [[Boris Zilber|Zilber]] trichotomy conjecture.  Cherlin posed the question for all ω-stable simple groups, but remarked that even the case of groups of finite Morley rank seemed hard.\n\nProgress towards this conjecture has followed [[Alexandre Borovik|Borovik]]’s program of transferring methods used in classification of [[finite simple groups]]. One possible source of counterexamples is '''bad groups''': nonsoluble connected groups of finite Morley rank all of whose proper connected definable subgroups are [[Nilpotent group|nilpotent]], (A group is called '''connected''' if it has no definable subgroups of finite index other than itself.)\n\nA number of special cases of this conjecture have been proved; for example:\n*Any connected group of Morley rank 1 is abelian.\n*Cherlin proved that a connected rank 2 group is solvable.\n*Cherlin proved that a simple group of Morley rank 3 is either a bad group or isomorphic to PSL<sub>2</sub>(''K'') for some algebraicially closed field ''K'' that ''G'' interprets.\n*{{harvs|txt | last1=Altinel | first1=Tuna | last2=Borovik | first2=Alexandre V. | last3=Cherlin | first3=Gregory | title=Simple groups of finite Morley rank | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-4305-5 | mr=2400564 | year=2008 | volume=145}} showed that an infinite group of finite Morley rank is either an algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2, or has finite 2-rank.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n|mr=1452677|last=Altinel|first=Tuna|last2=Borovik|first2=Alexandre|last3=Cherlin|first3= Gregory |title=Groups of mixed type|journal=J.

      "text": "In the branch of mathematics known as [[universal algebra]] (and in its applications), a '''subdirectly irreducible algebra''' is an algebra that cannot be factored as a [[subdirect product]] of \"simpler\" algebras. Subdirectly irreducible algebras play a somewhat analogous role in algebra to [[prime number|primes]] in [[number theory]].\n\n==Definition==\nA [[universal algebra]] ''A'' is said to be subdirectly irreducible when ''A'' has more than one element, and when any [[Subdirect product|subdirect representation]] of ''A'' includes (as a factor) an algebra [[isomorphic]] to ''A'', with the isomorphism being given by the projection map.\n\n==Examples==\n* The two-element chain, as either a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], a [[Heyting algebra]], a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], or a [[semilattice]], is subdirectly irreducible. In fact, a [[distributive lattice]] is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it has exactly two elements.\n* Any finite chain with two or more elements, as a [[Heyting algebra]], is subdirectly irreducible.  (This is not the case for chains of three or more elements as either lattices or semilattices, which are subdirectly reducible to the two-element chain.  The difference with Heyting algebras is that ''a'' → ''b'' need not be comparable with ''a'' under the lattice order even when ''b'' is.)\n* Any finite [[cyclic group]] of order a power of a prime (i.e. any finite [[p-group|''p''-group]]) is subdirectly irreducible.  (One weakness of the analogy between subdirect irreducibles and prime numbers is that the integers are subdirectly representable by any infinite family of nonisomorphic prime-power cyclic groups, e.g. just those of order a Mersenne prime assuming there are infinitely many.) In fact, an [[abelian group]] is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite ''p''-group or isomorphic to a [[Prüfer group]] (an infinite but countable ''p''-group, which is the [[direct limit]] of its finite ''p''-subgroups).\n* A vector space is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it has dimension one.\n\n==Properties==\nThe '''subdirect representation theorem''' of [[universal algebra]] states that every algebra is subdirectly representable by its subdirectly irreducible [[quotient]]s.  An equivalent definition of \"subdirect irreducible\" therefore is any algebra ''A'' that is not subdirectly representable by those of its quotients not isomorphic to ''A''.  (This is not quite the same thing as \"by its proper quotients\" because a proper quotient of ''A'' may be isomorphic to ''A'', for example the quotient of the semilattice ('''Z''', min) obtained by identifying just the two elements 3 and 4.)\n\nAn immediate corollary is that any [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]], as a class closed under homomorphisms, subalgebras, and direct products, is determined by its subdirectly irreducible members, since every algebra ''A'' in the variety can be constructed as a subalgebra of a suitable direct product of the subdirectly irreducible quotients of ''A'', all of which belong to the variety because ''A'' does.  For this reason one often studies not the variety itself but just its subdirect irreducibles.\n\nAn algebra ''A'' is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it contains two elements that are identified by every proper quotient, equivalently, if and only if its lattice '''Con''' ''A'' of [[congruence relation|congruence]]s has a least nonidentity element.  That is, any subdirect irreducible must contain a specific pair of elements witnessing its irreducibility in this way.  Given such a witness (''a'',''b'') to subdirect irreducibility we say that the subdirect irreducible is (''a'',''b'')-irreducible.\n\n{{anchor|JonssonsLemma}}Given any class ''C'' of similar algebras, '''Jónsson's Lemma''' (due to [[Bjarni Jónsson]]) states that if the variety HSP(''C'') generated by ''C'' is [[congruence-distributive variety|congruence-distributive]], its subdirect irreducibles are in HSP<sub>U</sub>(''C''), that is, they are quotients of subalgebras of [[ultraproduct]]s of members of ''C''. (If ''C'' is a finite set of finite algebras, the ultraproduct operation is redundant.)\n\n==Applications==\nA necessary and sufficient condition for a Heyting algebra to be subdirectly irreducible is for there to be a greatest element strictly below 1.  The witnessing pair is that element and 1, and identifying any other pair ''a'', ''b'' of elements identifies both ''a''→''b'' and ''b''→''a'' with 1 thereby collapsing everything above those two implications to 1.  Hence every finite chain of two or more elements as a Heyting algebra is subdirectly irreducible.\n\nBy [[#JonssonsLemma|Jónsson's Lemma]], subdirectly irreducible algebras of a congruence-distributive variety generated by a finite set of finite algebras are no larger than the generating algebras, since the quotients and subalgebras of an algebra ''A'' are never larger than ''A'' itself.  For example, the subdirect irreducibles in the variety generated by a finite linearly ordered Heyting algebra ''H'' must be just the nondegenerate quotients of ''H'', namely all smaller linearly ordered nondegenerate Heyting algebras. The conditions cannot be dropped in general: for example, the variety of all Heyting algebras is generated by the set of its finite subdirectly irreducible algebras, but there exist subdirectly irreducible Heyting algebras of arbitrary (infinite) cardinality. There also exists a single finite algebra generating a (non-congruence-distributive) variety with arbitrarily large subdirect irreducibles.<ref>R.

This is stronger than a perfect group, which is one whose first homology group vanishes. In more classical terms, a superperfect group is one whose [[abelianization]] and [[Schur multiplier]] both vanish; abelianization equals the first homology, while the Schur multiplier equals the second homology.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe first homology group of a group is the [[commutator subgroup|abelianization]] of the group itself, since the homology of a group ''G'' is the homology of any [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] of type ''K''(''G'', 1); the [[fundamental group]] of a ''K''(''G'', 1) is ''G'', and the first homology of ''K''(''G'', 1) is then abelianization of its fundamental group.

The smallest finite, non-trivial superperfect group is the [[binary icosahedral group]] (the fundamental group of the [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] homology sphere). \n\nThe alternating group ''A''<sub>5</sub> is perfect but not superperfect: it has a non-trivial central extension, the binary icosahedral group (which is in fact its UCE) is superperfect. More generally, the [[projective special linear group]]s PSL(''n'', ''q'') are simple (hence perfect) except for PSL(2, 2) and PSL(2, 3), but not superperfect, with the [[special linear group]]s SL(''n'',''q'') as central extensions. This family includes the binary icosahedral group (thought of as SL(2, 5)) as UCE of ''A''<sub>5</sub> (thought of as PSL(2, 5)).\n\nEvery [[acyclic space|acyclic group]] is superperfect, but the converse is not true: the binary icosahedral group is superperfect, but not acyclic.\n\n==References==\n* A.

      "text": "{{unsolved|mathematics|Is every  group surjunctive?}}\nIn mathematics, a '''surjunctive group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] such that every [[injective function|injective]] [[cellular automaton]] with the group elements as its cells is also [[surjective function|surjective]].  Surjunctive groups were introduced by {{harvtxt|Gottschalk|1973}}. It is unknown whether there can exist a group that is not surjunctive.\n\n==Definition==\nA [[cellular automaton]] consists of a regular system of cells, each containing a symbol from a finite [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], together with a uniform rule called a ''transition function'' for updating all cells simultaneously based on the values of neighboring cells. Most commonly the cells are arranged in the form of a line or a higher-dimensional [[integer lattice|integer grid]], but other arrangements of cells are also possible. What is required of the cells is that they form a structure in which every cell \"looks the same as\" every other cell: there is a [[symmetry]] of both the arrangement of cells and the rule set that takes any cell to any other cell. Mathematically, this can be formalized by the notion of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], a set of elements together with an associative and invertible binary operation. The elements of the group can be used as the cells of an automaton, with symmetries generated by the group operation. For instance, a one-dimensional line of cells can be described in this way as the additive group of the [[integer]]s, and the higher-dimensional integer grids can be described as the [[free abelian group]]s.\n\nThe collection of all possible states of a cellular automaton over a group can be described as the functions that map each group element to one of the symbols in the alphabet.\nAs a finite set, the alphabet has a [[discrete topology]], and the collection of states can be given the [[product topology]] (called a [[prodiscrete topology]] because it is the product of discrete topologies).\nTo be the transition function of a cellular automaton, a function from states to states must be a [[continuous function]] for this topology, and must also be [[equivariant]] with the group action, meaning that shifting the cells prior to applying the transition function produces the same result as applying the function and then shifting the cells. For such functions, the [[Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem]] ensures that the value of the transition function at each group element depends on the previous state of only a finite set of neighboring elements.\n\nA state transition function is a [[surjective function]] when every state has a predecessor (there can be no [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden]]). It is an [[injective function]] when no two states have the same successor. A surjunctive group is a group with the property that, when its elements are used as the cells of cellular automata, every injective transition function of a cellular automaton is also surjective.\nEquivalently, summarizing the definitions above, a group <math>G</math> is surjunctive if, for every finite set <math>S</math>, every continuous equivariant injective function <math>f:S^G \\to S^G</math> is also surjective.<ref name=CSC57>Ceccherini-Silberstein & Coornaert (2010) p.57</ref>  The implication from injectivity to surjectivity is a form of the [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden theorem]], and the cellular automata defined from injective and surjective transition functions are [[reversible cellular automaton|reversible]].\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of surjunctive groups include all locally [[residually finite group]]s,<ref name=CSC60>Ceccherini-Silberstein & Coornaert (2010) p.60</ref> all [[free group]]s,<ref name=CSC60/> all subgroups of surjunctive groups,<ref name=CSC58>Ceccherini-Silberstein & Coornaert (2010) p.58</ref> all abelian groups,<ref name=CSC60/> all [[sofic group]]s,<ref name=CSC276>Ceccherini-Silberstein & Coornaert (2010) p.276</ref> and every locally surjunctive group.<ref name=CSC58/>\n\nWhen he introduced surjunctive groups in 1973, Gottschalk observed that there were no known examples of non-surjunctive groups.

The group is called '''fat''' if it is not thin.\n\nGiven any generating set of the group, we can consider a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose vertices are elements of the group with two vertices adjacent if their ratio is in the generating set.

      "text": "{{redirect|Periodic group|groups in the chemical periodic table|Group (periodic table)}}\n\nIn [[group theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''torsion group''' or a '''periodic group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which each [[element (mathematics)|element]] has [[finite order]]. All finite groups are periodic. The concept of a periodic group should not be confused with that of a [[cyclic group]].\n\nThe '''exponent''' of a periodic group ''G'' is the [[least common multiple]], if it exists, of the orders of the elements of ''G''. Any [[finite group]] has an exponent: it is a divisor of |''G''|.\n\n[[Burnside's problem]] is a classical question, which deals with the relationship between periodic groups and [[finite group]]s, if we assume only that ''G'' is a [[finitely-generated group]]. The question is whether specifying an exponent forces finiteness (to which the answer is 'no', in general).\n \nExamples of infinite periodic groups include the additive group of the ring of polynomials over a finite field, and the quotient group of the rationals by the integers, as well as their direct summands, the [[Prüfer group]]s. Another example is the direct sum of all [[dihedral group]]s. None of these examples has a finite generating set, and any periodic [[linear group]] with a finite generating set is finite.  Explicit examples of finitely generated infinite periodic groups were constructed by Golod, based on joint work with Shafarevich, see [[Golod–Shafarevich theorem]], and by Aleshin and Grigorchuk using [[automata theory|automata]].\n\n==Mathematical logic==\nOne of the interesting properties of periodic groups is that the definition cannot be formalized in terms of [[first-order logic]]. This is because doing so would require an axiom of the form \n:<math>\\forall x.\\, ((x=e) \\lor (x\\circ x=e) \\lor ((x\\circ x)\\circ x=e) \\lor \\cdots)</math> \nwhich contains an infinite [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] and is therefore inadmissible. It is not possible to get around this infinite disjunction by using an infinite set of axioms: the [[compactness theorem]] implies that no set of first-order formulae can characterize the periodic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ebbinghaus|first1=H.-D.|last2=Flum|first2=J.|last3=Thomas|first3=W.|title=Mathematical logic|year=1994|publisher=Springer|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-387-94258-2|pages=50|url=https://www.springer.com/mathematics/book/978-0-387-94258-2|edition=2. ed., 4. pr.|accessdate=18 July 2012|quote=However, in first-order logic we may not form infinitely long disjunctions.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_metric",
      "text": "In [[group theory]], a '''word metric''' on a [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math> G </math> is a way to measure distance between any two elements of <math> G </math>. As the name suggests, the word metric is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on <math> G </math>, assigning to any two elements <math> g </math>, <math> h </math> of <math> G </math> a distance <math> d(g,h) </math> that measures how efficiently their difference <math> g^{-1} h </math> can be expressed as a [[Automata theory#Definitions|word]] whose letters come from a [[Generating set of a group|generating set]] for the group. The word metric on G is very closely related to the [[Cayley graph]] of G: the word metric measures the length of the shortest path in the Cayley graph between two elements of G.\n\nA [[Generating set of a group|generating set]] for <math>G</math> must first be chosen before a word metric on <math>G</math> is specified. Different choices of a generating set will typically yield different word metrics. While this seems at first to be a weakness in the concept of the word metric, it can be exploited to prove theorems about geometric properties of groups, as is done in [[geometric group theory]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== The group of integers Z ===\n\nThe group of [[integers]] '''Z''' is generated by the set {-1,+1}. The integer -3 can be expressed as -1-1-1+1-1, a word of length 5 in these generators. But the word which expresses -3 most efficiently is -1-1-1, a word of length 3. The distance between 0 and -3 in the word metric is therefore equal to 3. More generally, the distance between two integers m and n in the word metric is equal to |m-n|, because the shortest word representing the difference m-n has length equal to |m-n|.\n\n=== The group <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}</math> ===\n\nFor a more illustrative example, the elements of the group <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}</math> can be thought of as [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]] with integer coefficients. The group <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}</math> is generated by the standard unit vectors <math>e_1 = \\langle1,0\\rangle</math>, <math>e_2 = \\langle0,1\\rangle</math> and their inverses <math> -e_1=\\langle-1,0\\rangle </math>, <math> -e_2=\\langle0,-1\\rangle </math>. The [[Cayley graph]] of <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}</math> is the so-called [[taxicab geometry]]. It can be pictured in the plane as an infinite square grid of city streets, where each horizontal and vertical line with integer coordinates is a street, and each point of <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}</math> lies at the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical street. Each horizontal segment between two vertices represents the generating vector <math> e_1 </math> or <math> -e_1</math>, depending on whether the segment is travelled in the forward or backward direction, and each vertical segment represents <math> e_2 </math> or <math> -e_2</math>. A car starting from <math>\\langle1,2\\rangle</math> and travelling along the streets to <math>\\langle-2,4\\rangle</math> can make the trip by many different routes. But no matter what route is taken, the car must travel at least |1 - (-2)| = 3 horizontal blocks and at least |2 - 4| = 2 vertical blocks, for a total trip distance of at least 3 + 2 = 5. If the car goes out of its way the trip may be longer, but the minimal distance travelled by the car, equal in value to the word metric between <math>\\langle1,2\\rangle</math> and <math>\\langle-2,4\\rangle</math> is therefore equal to 5.\n\nIn general, given two elements <math> v = \\langle i,j\\rangle </math> and <math> w = \\langle k,l\\rangle </math> of <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}</math>, the distance between <math> v </math> and <math> w </math> in the word metric is equal to <math> |i-k| + |j-l| </math>.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nLet G be a group, let S be a [[generating set]] for G, and suppose that S is closed under the inverse operation on G. A [[Automata theory#Definitions|word]] over the set S is just a finite sequence <math> w = s_1 \\ldots s_L </math> whose entries <math>s_1, \\ldots, s_L</math> are elements of S. The integer L is called the length of the word <math>w</math>. Using the group operation in G, the entries of a word <math> w = s_1 \\ldots s_L </math> can be multiplied in order, remembering that the entries are elements of G. The result of this multiplication is an element <math>\\bar w</math> in the group G which is called the '''evaluation''' of the word w. As a special case, the empty word <math>w = \\emptyset</math> has length zero, and its evaluation is the identity element of G.\n\nGiven an element g of G, its '''word norm''' |g| with respect to the generating set S is defined to be the shortest length of a word <math>w</math> over S whose evaluation <math>\\bar w</math> is equal to g. Given two elements g,h in G, the distance d(g,h) in the word metric with respect to S is defined to be <math>|g^{-1} h|</math>. Equivalently, d(g,h) is the shortest length of a word w over S such that <math>g \\bar w = h</math>.\n\nThe word metric on G satisfies the axioms for a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], and it is not hard to prove this. The proof of the symmetry axiom d(g,h) = d(h,g) for a metric uses the assumption that the generating set S is closed under inverse.\n\n=== Variations ===\n\nThe word metric has an equivalent definition formulated in more geometric terms using the [[Cayley graph]] of G with respect to the generating set S. When each edge of the Cayley graph is assigned a metric of length 1, the distance between two group elements g,h in G is equal to the shortest length of a path in the Cayley graph from the vertex g to the vertex h.\n\nThe word metric on G can also be defined without assuming that the generating set S is closed under inverse. To do this, first symmetrize S, replacing it by a larger generating set consisting of each <math> s </math> in S as well as its inverse <math> s^{-1} </math>. Then define the word metric with respect to S to be the word metric with respect to the symmetrization of S.\n\n== Example in a free group ==\n\n[[File:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|thumb|In the [[free group]] on the two element set {a,b}, the distance between a and b in the word metric equals 2]]\n\nSuppose that F is the free group on the two element set <math>\\{a,b\\}</math>. A word w in the symmetric generating set <math>\\{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\\}</math> is said to be reduced if the letters <math> a,a^{-1}</math> do not occur next to each other in w, nor do the letters <math>b,b^{-1}</math>. Every element <math>g \\in F</math> is represented by a unique reduced word, and this reduced word is the shortest word representing g. For example, since the word <math>w = b^{-1} a</math> is reduced and has length 2, the word norm of <math>w</math> equals 2, so the distance in the word norm between <math>b</math> and <math>a</math> equals 2. This can be visualized in terms of the Cayley graph, where the shortest path between b and a has length 2.\n\n== Theorems ==\n\n=== Isometry of the left action ===\n\nThe group G [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on itself by left multiplication: the action of each <math>k \\in G</math> takes each <math>g \\in G</math> to <math>kg</math>. This action is an [[isometry]] of the word metric. The proof is simple: the distance between <math>kg</math> and <math>kh</math> equals <math>|(kg)^{-1} (kh)| = |g^{-1} h|</math> which equals the distance between <math>g</math> and <math>h</math>.\n\n=== Bilipschitz invariants of a group ===\n\nThe word metric on a group G is not unique, because different symmetric generating sets give different word metrics. However, finitely generated word metrics are unique up to [[Lipschitz continuity#Lipschitz continuity in metric spaces|bilipschitz]] equivalence: if <math>S</math>, <math>T</math> are two symmetric, finite generating sets for G with corresponding word metrics <math>d_S</math>, <math>d_T</math>, then there is a constant <math>K \\ge 1</math> such that for any <math>g,h \\in G</math>, \n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{K} \\, d_T(g,h) \\le d_S(g,h) \\le K \\, d_T(g,h) </math>.\n\nThis constant K is just the maximum of the <math>d_S</math> word norms of elements of <math>T</math> and the <math>d_T</math> word norms of elements of <math>S</math>. This proof is also easy: any word over S can be converted by substitution into a word over T, expanding the length of the word by a factor of at most K, and similarly for converting words over T into words over S.\n\nThe bilipschitz equivalence of word metrics implies in turn that the [[growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] of a finitely generated group is a well-defined isomorphism invariant of the group, independent of the choice of a finite generating set. This implies in turn that various properties of growth, such as polynomial growth, the degree of polynomial growth, and exponential growth, are isomorphism invariants of groups. This topic is discussed further in the article on the [[growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] of a group.\n\n=== Quasi-isometry invariants of a group ===\n\nIn [[geometric group theory]], groups are studied by their [[Group action (mathematics)|actions]] on metric spaces. A principle which generalizes the bilipschitz invariance of word metrics says that any finitely generated word metric on G is [[quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] to any [[proper metric space|proper]], [[geodesic metric space]] on which G [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]], [[properly discontinuously]] and [[Group action (mathematics)#Continuous group actions|cocompactly]]. Metric spaces on which G acts in this manner are called '''model spaces''' for G.\n\nIt follows in turn that any quasi-isometrically invariant property satisfied by the word metric of G or by any model space of G is an isomorphism invariant of G. Modern [[geometric group theory]] is in large part the study of quasi-isometry invariants.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Length function]]\n* [[Longest element of a Coxeter group]]\n\n== References ==\n* J.

Conversely, if (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') is a rational point on the unit circle in the 1st [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|quadrant]] of the coordinate system (i.e. ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, ''y''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0), then there exists a primitive right triangle with sides&nbsp;''xc'',&nbsp;''yc'',&nbsp;''c'', with ''c'' being the [[least common multiple]] of the denominators of ''x'' and ''y''. There is a correspondence between points (''a'', ''b'') in the ''x''-''y'' plane and points ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''ib'' in the complex plane which is used below.\n\n==Group operation==\nThe set of rational points on the unit circle, shortened ''G'' in this article, forms an [[Abelian group#Infinite abelian groups|infinite abelian group]] under rotations. The identity element is the point (1,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i''0&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. The group operation, or \"product\" is (''x'',&nbsp;''y'')&nbsp;*&nbsp;(''t'',&nbsp;''u'') = (''xt''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''uy'',&nbsp;''xu''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''yt'').  This product is angle addition since ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[cosine|cos]](''A'') and ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[sine|sin]](''A''), where ''A'' is the angle that the vector (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the vector (1,0), measured counter-clockwise. So with (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') and (''t'',&nbsp;''u'') forming angles ''A'' and ''B'' with (1,&nbsp;0) respectively, their product (''xt''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''uy'',&nbsp;''xu''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''yt'') is just the rational point on the unit circle forming the angle ''A''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''B'' with (1,&nbsp;0). The group operation is expressed more easily with complex numbers: identifying the points (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') and (''t'',&nbsp;''u'')  with ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' and ''t''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iu'' respectively, the group product above is just the ordinary complex number multiplication (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'')(''t''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iu'') =&nbsp;''xt''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''yu''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i''(''xu''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''yt''), which corresponds to the point (''xt''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''uy'',&nbsp;''xu''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''yt'') as above.\n\n===Example===\n\n3/5&nbsp;+&nbsp;4/5''i'' and 5/13&nbsp;+&nbsp;12/13''i'' (which correspond to the two most famous Pythagorean triples (3,4,5) and (5,12,13)) are rational points on the unit circle in the complex plane, and thus are elements of ''G''. Their group product is &minus;33/65&nbsp;+&nbsp;56/65''i'', which corresponds to the Pythagorean triple (33,56,65). The sum of the squares of the numerators 33 and 56 is 1089&nbsp;+&nbsp;3136&nbsp;=&nbsp;4225, which is the square of the denominator 65.\n\n===Other ways to describe the group===\n::<math>G \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2, \\mathbb{Q}).</math>\n\nThe set of all 2&times;2 [[orthogonal|rotation matrices]] with rational entries coincides with G. This follows from the fact that the [[circle group]] <math>S^1</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{SO}(2, \\mathbb{R})</math>, and the fact that their rational points coincide.\n\n==Group structure==\n\nThe structure of ''G'' is an infinite sum of [[cyclic group]]s. Let ''G''<sub>2</sub> denote the [[subgroup]] of ''G'' generated by the point {{nowrap|0 + 1''i''}}.  ''G''<sub>2</sub> is a [[cyclic subgroup]] of order 4.  For a prime ''p'' of form 4''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, let ''G''<sub>''p''</sub> denote the subgroup of elements with denominator ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.  ''G''<sub>''p''</sub> is  an infinite cyclic group, and the point (''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''b''<sup>2</sup>)/''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2''ab''/''p'')''i'' is a generator of ''G''<sub>''p''</sub>.  Furthermore, by factoring the denominators of an element of ''G'', it can be shown that ''G'' is a direct sum of ''G''<sub>2</sub> and the ''G''<sub>''p''</sub>.  That is:\n\n::<math>G \\cong G_2 \\oplus \\bigoplus_{p \\, \\equiv \\, 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 4)} G_p.</math>\n\nSince it is a [[direct sum]] rather than [[direct product]], only finitely many of the values in the ''G<sub>p</sub>''s are non-zero.\n\n===Example===\n\nViewing ''G'' as an infinite direct sum, consider the element ({''0''}; 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0, ...) where the first coordinate ''0'' is in [[cyclic group|''C''<sub>4</sub>]] and the other coordinates give the powers of (''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''b''<sup>2</sup>)/''p''(''r'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i''2''ab''/''p''(''r''), where ''p''(''r'') is the ''r''th prime number of form 4''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Then this corresponds to, in ''G'', the rational point (3/5&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i''4/5)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;(8/17&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i''15/17)<sup>1</sup> =&nbsp;&minus;416/425&nbsp;+&nbsp;i87/425. The denominator 425 is the product of the denominator 5 twice, and the denominator 17 once, and as in the previous example, the square of the numerator &minus;416 plus the square of the numerator 87 is equal to the square of the denominator 425. It should also be noted, as a connection to help retain understanding, that the denominator 5&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''(1) is the 1st prime of form 4''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, and the denominator 17&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''(3) is the 3rd prime of form&nbsp;4''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\n==The unit hyperbola's group of rational points==\nThere is a close connection between this group on the [[unit hyperbola]] and the group discussed above. If <math>\\frac {a + ib}{c}</math> is a rational point on the unit circle, where ''a''/''c'' and ''b''/''c'' are [[reduced fraction]]s, then (''c''/''a'',&nbsp;''b''/''a'') is a rational point on the unit hyperbola, since <math>(c/a)^2-(b/a)^2=1,</math> satisfying the equation for the unit hyperbola. The group operation here is <math>(x, y) \\times (u, v)=(xu+yv, xv+yu),</math>and the group identity is the same point (1, 0) as above. In this group there is a close connection with the [[hyperbolic cosine]] and [[hyperbolic sine]], which parallels the connection with [[cosine]] and [[sine]] in the unit circle group above.\n\n===Copies inside a larger group===\nThere are isomorphic copies of both groups, as subgroups (and as geometric objects) of the group of the rational points on the [[abelian variety]] in four-dimensional space given by the equation <math>w^2+x^2-y^2+z^2=0.</math> Note that this variety is the set of points with [[Minkowski metric]] relative to the origin equal to&nbsp;0. The identity in this larger group is (1, 0, 1, 0), and the group operation is <math>(a, b, c, d) \\times (w, x, y, z)=(aw-bx,ax+bw,cy+dz,cz+dy).</math>\n\nFor the group on the unit circle, the appropriate subgroup is the subgroup of points of the form (''w'', ''x'', 1, 0), with <math>w^2+x^2=1,</math> and its identity element is (1, 0, 1, 0). The unit hyperbola group corresponds to points of form (1, 0, ''y'', ''z''), with <math>y^2-z^2=1,</math> and the identity is again (1, 0, 1, 0). (Of course, since they are subgroups of the larger group, they both must have the same identity element.)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[Circle group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''The Group of Rational Points on the Unit Circle''[https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/1997/0025570x.di021195.02p0087x.pdf], Lin Tan, ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' Vol. 69, No. 3 (June, 1996), pp.&nbsp;163–171\n*''The Group of Primitive Pythagorean Triangles''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2690291], Ernest J.

      "title": "Height (abelian group)",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_%28abelian_group%29",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''height''' of an element ''g'' of an [[abelian group]] ''A'' is an invariant that captures its divisibility properties: it is the largest [[natural number]] ''N'' such that the equation ''Nx''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''g'' has a solution ''x'' ∈ ''A'', or the symbol ∞ if there is no such ''N''. The ''' ''p''-height''' considers only divisibility properties by the powers of a fixed [[prime number]] ''p''. The notion of height admits a refinement so that the ''p''-height becomes an [[ordinal number]]. Height plays an important role in [[Prüfer theorems]] and also in '''Ulm's theorem''', which describes the classification of certain infinite abelian groups in terms of their '''Ulm factors''' or '''Ulm invariants'''.\n\n== Definition of height ==\n\nLet ''A'' be an abelian group and ''g'' an element of ''A''. The ''' ''p''-height''' of ''g'' in ''A'', denoted ''h''<sub>''p''</sub>(''g''), is the largest natural number ''n'' such that the equation ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''g'' has a solution in ''x'' ∈ ''A'', or the symbol ∞ if a solution exists for all ''n''. Thus ''h''<sub>''p''</sub>(''g'') = ''n'' if and only if ''g'' ∈ ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>''A'' and ''g''&nbsp;∉&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''+1</sup>''A''. \nThis allows one to refine the notion of height.\n\nFor any ordinal ''&alpha;'', there is a subgroup ''p''<sup>''α''</sup>''A'' of ''A'' which is the image of the multiplication map by ''p'' iterated ''α'' times, defined using\n[[transfinite induction]]:\n\n* ''p''<sup>0</sup>''A'' = ''A'';\n* ''p''<sup>''α''+1</sup>''A'' = ''p''(''p''<sup>''&alpha;''</sup>''A'');\n* ''p''<sup>''β''</sup>''A''=∩<sub>''α'' < ''β''</sub> ''p''<sup>''α''</sup>''A'' if ''β'' is a [[limit ordinal]].\n\nThe subgroups ''p''<sup>''α''</sup>''A'' form a decreasing filtration of the group ''A'', and their intersection is the subgroup of the ''p''-divisible elements of ''A'', whose elements are assigned height ∞. The modified ''p''-height ''h''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>∗</sup>(''g'') = ''α'' if ''g'' ∈ ''p''<sup>''α''</sup>''A'', but ''g'' ∉ ''p''<sup>''α''+1</sup>''A''. The construction of ''p''<sup>''α''</sup>''A'' is [[functorial]] in ''A''; in particular, subquotients of the filtration are isomorphism invariants of ''A''.\n\n== Ulm subgroups ==\n\nLet ''p'' be a fixed prime number. The (first) '''Ulm subgroup''' of an abelian group ''A'', denoted ''U''(''A'') or ''A''<sup>1</sup>, is ''p''<sup>''ω''</sup>''A'' = ∩<sub>''n''</sub> ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>''A'', where ''ω'' is the [[limit ordinal|smallest infinite ordinal]]. It consists of all elements of ''A'' of infinite height. The family {''U''<sup>''σ''</sup>(''A'')} of Ulm subgroups indexed by ordinals ''σ'' is defined by transfinite induction:\n\n* ''U''<sup>0</sup>(''A'') = ''A'';\n* ''U''<sup>''σ''+1</sup>(''A'') = ''U''(''U''<sup>''&sigma;''</sup>(''A''));\n* ''U''<sup>''τ''</sup>(''A'') = ∩<sub>''σ'' < ''τ''</sub> ''U''<sup>''σ''</sup>(''A'') if ''τ'' is a [[limit ordinal]].\n\nEquivalently, ''U''<sup>''σ''</sup>(''A'') = ''p''<sup>''ωσ''</sup>''A'', where ''ωσ'' is the product of ordinals ''ω'' and ''σ''.\n\nUlm subgroups form a decreasing filtration of ''A'' whose quotients  ''U''<sub>''σ''</sub>(''A'') = ''U''<sup>''σ''</sup>(''A'')/''U''<sup>''σ''+1</sup>(''A'') are called the '''Ulm factors''' of ''A''. This filtration stabilizes and the smallest ordinal ''τ'' such that ''U''<sup>''τ''</sup>(''A'') = ''U''<sup>''τ''+1</sup>(''A'') is the '''Ulm length''' of ''A''. The smallest Ulm subgroup ''U''<sup>''τ''</sup>(''A''), also denoted ''U''<sup>∞</sup>(''A'') and ''p''<sup>∞</sup>A, consists of all ''p''-divisible elements of ''A'', and being [[divisible group]], it is a direct summand of ''A''.\n  \nFor every Ulm factor ''U''<sub>''σ''</sub>(''A'') the ''p''-heights of its elements are finite and they are unbounded for every Ulm factor except possibly the last one, namely ''U''<sub>''τ''&minus;1</sub>(''A'') when the Ulm length ''τ'' is a [[successor ordinal]].\n\n== Ulm's theorem ==\n\nThe [[Prüfer theorems|second Prüfer theorem]] provides a straightforward extension of the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] to countable abelian ''p''-groups without elements of infinite height: each such group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups whose orders are powers of ''p''. Moreover, the cardinality of the set of summands of order ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> is uniquely determined by the group and each sequence of at most countable cardinalities is realized. [[Helmut Ulm]] (1933) found an extension of this classification theory to general countable ''p''-groups: their isomorphism class is determined by the isomorphism classes of the Ulm factors and the ''p''-divisible part.\n\n: '''Ulm's theorem'''. ''Let'' ''A'' ''and'' ''B'' ''be countable abelian'' ''p''-''groups such that for every ordinal'' ''&sigma;'' ''their Ulm factors are isomorphic'', ''U''<sub>''&sigma;''</sub>(''A'') &cong; ''U''<sub>''&sigma;''</sub>(''B'') ''and the'' ''p''-''divisible parts of'' ''A'' ''and'' ''B'' ''are isomorphic'', ''U''<sup>&infin;</sup>(''A'') &cong; ''U''<sup>&infin;</sup>(''B''). ''Then'' ''A'' ''and'' ''B'' ''are isomorphic.''\n\nThere is a complement to this theorem, first stated by Leo Zippin (1935) and proved in Kurosh (1960), which addresses the existence of an abelian ''p''-group with given Ulm factors.\n\n: ''Let'' ''&tau;'' ''be an ordinal and'' {''A''<sub>''&sigma;''</sub>} ''be a family of countable abelian'' ''p''-''groups indexed by the ordinals'' ''&sigma;'' < ''&tau;'' ''such that the'' ''p''-''heights of elements of each'' ''A''<sub>''&sigma;''</sub> ''are finite and, except possibly for the last one, are unbounded. Then there exists a reduced abelian'' ''p''-''group'' ''A'' ''of Ulm length'' ''&tau;'' ''whose Ulm factors are isomorphic to these'' ''p''-''groups'', ''U''<sub>''&sigma;''</sub>(''A'') &cong; ''A''<sub>''&sigma;''</sub>.\n\nUlm's original proof was based on an extension of the theory of [[elementary divisors]] to infinite [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].\n\n=== Alternative formulation ===\n\n[[George Mackey]] and [[Irving Kaplansky]] generalized Ulm's theorem to certain [[module (algebra)|modules]] over a [[complete ring|complete]] [[discrete valuation ring]]. They introduced invariants of abelian groups that lead to a direct statement of the classification of countable periodic abelian groups: given an abelian group ''A'', a prime ''p'', and an ordinal ''α'', the corresponding ''' ''α''th Ulm invariant''' is the dimension of the quotient\n\n: ''p''<sup>''&alpha;''</sup>''A''[''p'']/''p''<sup>''&alpha;''+1</sup>''A''[''p''],\n\nwhere ''B''[''p''] denotes the ''p''-torsion of an abelian group ''B'', i.e. the subgroup of elements of order ''p'', viewed as a [[vector space]] over the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements.\n\n: ''A countable periodic reduced abelian group is determined uniquely up to isomorphism by its Ulm invariants for all prime numbers ''p'' and countable ordinals ''&alpha;''.''\n\nTheir simplified proof of Ulm's theorem served as a model for many further generalizations to other classes of abelian groups and modules.\n\n== References ==\n\n* László Fuchs (1970), ''Infinite abelian groups, Vol. I''.

Additionally, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used to denote either the set of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''p''}}]], i.e., a set of [[congruence relation|congruence classes]] of integers, or the set of [[p-adic integer|{{math|''p''}}-adic integers]].<ref name=edexcelc1>Keith Pledger and Dave Wilkins, \"Edexcel AS and A Level Modular Mathematics: Core Mathematics 1\" Pearson 2008</ref><ref>LK Turner, FJ BUdden, D Knighton, \"Advanced Mathematics\", Book 2, Longman 1975.</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |title=Z^* |id=Z^*}}</ref>\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\n[[File:Number-line.svg|right|thumb|300px|Integers can be thought of as discrete, equally spaced points on an infinitely long [[number line]]. In the above, non-[[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|negative]] integers are shown in purple and negative integers in red.]]\n\nLike the [[natural numbers]], {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[binary operation|operations]] of addition and [[multiplication]], that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly,&nbsp;{{num|0}}, {{math|'''Z'''}} (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under [[subtraction]]. The integers form a [[unital ring]] which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique [[ring homomorphism]] from the integers into this ring. This [[universal property]], namely to be an [[initial object]] in the [[category of rings]], characterizes the ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under [[division (mathematics)|division]], since the quotient of two integers (e.g.,&nbsp;1 divided by&nbsp;2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under [[exponentiation]], the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).\n\nThe following table lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Properties of addition and multiplication on integers\n!\n!scope=\"col\" |Addition\n!scope=\"col\" |Multiplication\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|{{math|''a'' × ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Associativity]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}\n|{{math|''a'' × (''b'' × ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') × ''c''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Commutativity]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' × ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of an [[identity element]]:\n|{{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' × 1 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of [[inverse element]]s:\n|{{math|''a'' + (−''a'') {{=}} 0}}\n|The only invertible integers (called [[Unit (ring theory)|units]]) are {{math|−1}} and&nbsp;{{math|1}}.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Distributivity]]:\n|colspan=2 align=center |{{math|''a'' × (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + (''a'' × ''c'')}}{{pad|1em}}and{{pad|1em}}{{math|(''a'' + ''b'') × ''c'' {{=}} (''a'' × ''c'') + (''b'' × ''c'')}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |No [[zero divisor]]s:\n| || | If {{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both)\n|}\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], the first five properties listed above for addition say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is an [[abelian group]]. It is also a [[cyclic group]], since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum {{nowrap|1 + 1 + … + 1}} or {{nowrap|(−1) + (−1) + … + (−1)}}. In fact, {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is the ''only'' infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\nThe first four properties listed above for multiplication say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is a [[commutative monoid]]. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g., there is no integer {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|2''x'' {{=}} 1}}. This means that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is not a group.\n\nAll the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with addition and multiplication is a [[commutative ring]] with [[multiplicative identity|unity]]. It is the prototype of all objects of such [[algebraic structure]]. Only those [[equality (mathematics)|equalities]] of [[algebraic expression|expressions]] are true in&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} [[for all]] values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Note that certain non-zero integers map to [[additive identity|zero]] in certain rings.\n\nThe lack of [[zero divisor]]s in the integers (last property in the table) means that the commutative ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} is an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under division, means that {{math|'''Z'''}} is ''not'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The smallest field containing the integers as a [[subring]] is the field of [[rational number]]s. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the [[field of fractions]] of any integral domain. And back, starting from an [[algebraic number field]] (an extension of rational numbers), its [[ring of integers]] can be extracted, which includes {{math|'''Z'''}} as its [[subring]].\n\nAlthough ordinary division is not defined on {{math|'''Z'''}}, the division \"with remainder\" is defined on them. It is called [[Euclidean division]] and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, there exist unique integers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''q'' × ''b'' + ''r''}} and {{math|0 ≤ ''r'' <  {{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}}, where {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of {{math|''b''}}. The integer {{math|''q''}} is called the ''quotient'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by {{math|''b''}}. The [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.\n\nAgain, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]]. This implies that {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[principal ideal domain]] and any positive integer can be written as the products of [[prime number|primes]] in an essentially unique way.<ref>{{citation | last=Serge|first = Lang |authorlink=Serge Lang |title = Algebra |edition=3rd| publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-201-55540-0|pp =86–87}}</ref> This is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].\n\n==Order-theoretic properties==\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] without upper or lower bound. The ordering of {{math|'''Z'''}} is given by:\n{{math|:… −3 < −2 < −1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < …}}\nAn integer is ''positive'' if it is greater than zero and ''negative'' if it is less than zero. Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.\n\nThe ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:\n# if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|''c'' < ''d''}}, then {{math|''a'' + ''c'' < ''b'' + ''d''}}\n# if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|0 < ''c''}}, then {{math|''ac'' < ''bc''}}.\n\nIt follows that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with the above ordering is an [[ordered ring]].\n\nThe integers are the only nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements are [[well-ordered]].<ref>{{citation|title=Modern Algebra|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Seth|last=Warner|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2012|isbn=978-0-486-13709-4|at=Theorem 20.14, p.&nbsp;185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqHDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA185}}.</ref> This is equivalent to the statement that any [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[valuation ring]] is either a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] or a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Relative numbers representation.svg|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers −5 to 5\n|Red points represent ordered pairs of [[natural number]]s.

However, this style of definition leads to many different cases (each arithmetic operation needs to be defined on each combination of types of integer) and makes it tedious to prove that these operations obey the laws of arithmetic.<ref>{{citation|title=Number Systems and the Foundations of Analysis|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Elliott|last=Mendelson|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2008|isbn=978-0-486-45792-5|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3domViIV7HMC&pg=PA86}}.</ref> Therefore, in modern set-theoretic mathematics a more abstract construction,<ref>Ivorra Castillo: ''Álgebra''</ref> which allows one to define the arithmetical operations without any case distinction, is often used instead.<ref>{{citation|title=Learning to Teach Number: A Handbook for Students and Teachers in the Primary School|series=The Stanley Thornes Teaching Primary Maths Series|first=Len|last=Frobisher|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7487-3515-0|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwJQIt4jQHUC&pg=PA126}}.</ref> The integers can thus be formally constructed as the [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair]]s of [[natural number]]s {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}.<ref name=\"Campbell-1970-p83\">{{cite book |author=Campbell, Howard E. |title=The structure of arithmetic |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-390-16895-5 |page=83}}</ref>\n\nThe intuition is that {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} stands for the result of subtracting {{math|''b''}} from {{math|''a''}}.<ref name=\"Campbell-1970-p83\"/> To confirm our expectation that {{nowrap|1 − 2}} and {{nowrap|4 − 5}} denote the same number, we define an [[equivalence relation]] {{math|~}} on these pairs with the following rule:\n:<math>(a,b) \\sim (c,d) </math>\nprecisely when\n:<math>a + d = b + c. </math>\n\nAddition and multiplication of integers can be defined in terms of the equivalent operations on the natural numbers;<ref name=\"Campbell-1970-p83\"/> denoting by {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} the equivalence class having {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} as a member, one has:\n:<math>[(a,b)] + [(c,d)] := [(a+c,b+d)].</math>\n:<math>[(a,b)]\\cdot[(c,d)] := [(ac+bd,ad+bc)].</math>\n\nThe negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:\n:<math>-[(a,b)] := [(b,a)].</math>\n\nHence subtraction can be defined as the addition of the additive inverse:\n:<math>[(a,b)] - [(c,d)] := [(a+d,b+c)].</math>\n\nThe standard ordering on the integers is given by:\n:<math>[(a,b)] < [(c,d)]</math> [[If and only if|iff]] <math>a+d < b+c.</math>\n\nIt is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.\n\nEvery equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form {{math|(''n'',0)}} or {{math|(0,''n'')}} (or both at once). The natural number {{math|''n''}} is identified with the class {{math|[(''n'',0)]}} (in other words the natural numbers are [[embedding|embedded]] into the integers by map sending {{math|''n''}} to {{math|[(''n'',0)]}}), and the class {{math|[(0,''n'')]}} is denoted {{math|−''n''}} (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class {{math|[(0,0)]}} a second time since {{math|−0 {{=}} 0.}}\n\nThus, {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} is denoted by\n:<math>\\begin{cases} a - b, & \\mbox{if }  a \\ge b  \\\\ -(b - a),  & \\mbox{if } a < b. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.\n\nThis notation recovers the familiar [[group representation|representation]] of the integers as  {{math|{…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …}}}.\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 0 &= [(0,0)] &= [(1,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k)] \\\\\n 1 &= [(1,0)] &= [(2,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+1,k)] \\\\\n-1 &= [(0,1)] &= [(1,2)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+1)] \\\\\n 2 &= [(2,0)] &= [(3,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+2,k)] \\\\\n-2 &= [(0,2)] &= [(1,3)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+2)].\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[Rewriting|term rewrite engines]].\nIntegers are represented as [[Term algebra|algebraic terms]] built using a few basic operations  (such as '''zero''', '''succ''', '''pred''', etc.) and, possibly, using [[natural number]]s, which are assumed to be already constructed (e.g., using the Peano approach).\n\nThere exist at least ten such constructions of signed integers.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Garavel |first=Hubert |title=On the Most Suitable Axiomatization of Signed Integers |conference=Post-proceedings of the 23rd International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques (WADT'2016) |year=2017 |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=10644 |pages=120–134 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72044-9_9 |url= https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321}}</ref> These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.\n\nThe technique for the construction of integers presented above in this section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation '''pair'''<math>(x,y)</math> that takes as arguments two natural numbers <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and returns an integer (equal to <math>x-y</math>). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written '''pair'''(0,0), or '''pair'''(1,1), or '''pair'''(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the [[proof assistant]] [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]]; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.\n\n==Computer science==\n{{Main|Integer (computer science)}}\nAn integer is often a primitive [[data type]] in [[computer language]]s. However, integer data types can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common [[two's complement]] representation, the inherent definition of [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] distinguishes between \"negative\" and \"non-negative\" rather than \"negative, positive, and&nbsp;0\". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted ''int'' or Integer in several programming languages (such as [[Algol68]], [[C (computer language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], etc.).\n\nVariable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of&nbsp;2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or&nbsp;10).\n\n==Cardinality==\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set of integers is equal to {{math|ℵ{{sub|0}}}} ([[Aleph number|aleph-null]]). This is readily demonstrated by the construction of a [[bijection]], that is, a function that is [[injective]] and [[surjective]] from {{math|'''Z'''}} to {{math|'''N'''}}.\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>0, 1, 2, …&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x \\leq 0\\\\ 2x-1, & \\mbox{if }  x > 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|<nowiki>{…</nowiki> (−4,8) (−3,6) (−2,4) (−1,2) (0,0) (1,1) (2,3) (3,5) …&#125;}}\n\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>1, 2, 3, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>g(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\ 2x+1, & \\mbox{if }  x \\ge 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|{… (−4,8) (−3,6) (−2,4) (−1,2) (0,1) (1,3) (2,5) (3,7) …&#125;}}\n\nIf the domain is restricted to {{math|'''Z'''}} then each and every member of {{math|'''Z'''}} has one and only one corresponding member of '''N''' and by the definition of cardinal equality the two sets have equal cardinality.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Number theory}}\n* [[0.999...]]\n* [[Canonical representation of a positive integer]]\n* [[Hyperinteger]]\n* [[Integer-valued function]]\n* [[Integer lattice]]\n* [[Integer part]]\n* [[Integer sequence]]\n* [[Profinite integer]]\n* [[Mathematical symbols]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notefoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* [[Eric Temple Bell|Bell, E.T.]], ''[[Men of Mathematics]].''

      "text": "In several [[mathematics|mathematical]] areas, including [[harmonic analysis]], [[topology]], and [[number theory]], '''locally compact abelian groups''' are [[abelian group]]s which have a particularly convenient topology on them. For example, the group of integers (equipped with the [[discrete topology]]), or the real numbers or the [[circle]] (both with their usual topology) are locally compact abelian groups.\n\n==Definition and examples==\n\nA [[topological group]] is called ''[[locally compact group|locally compact]]'' if the underlying topological space is [[locally compact space|locally compact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]; the topological group is called ''abelian'' if the underlying group is [[abelian group|abelian]].\n\nExamples of locally compact [[abelian group|abelian]] groups include:\n\n* <math>\\R^n</math> for ''n'' a positive integer,  with vector addition as group operation.\n*  The [[positive real numbers]] <math>\\R^+</math> with multiplication as operation.  This group is isomorphic to <math>(\\R, +)</math> by the exponential map.\n* Any finite abelian group, with the [[discrete topology]].  By the [[structure theorem for finite abelian groups]], all such groups are products of cyclic groups.\n* The integers <math>\\Z</math> under addition, again with the discrete topology.\n* The [[circle group]], denoted <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> for [[torus]]. This is the group of complex numbers of [[absolute value|modulus]] 1. <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> is isomorphic as a topological group to the [[quotient group]] <math>\\R/\\Z</math>.\n* The field <math>\\Q_p</math> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]s under addition, with the usual ''p''-adic topology.\n\n==The dual group==\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a locally compact ''abelian'' group, a [[Character (mathematics)|character]] of <math>G</math> is  a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[group homomorphism]] from <math>G</math> with values in the [[circle group]] <math>\\mathbb{T}</math>.  The set of all characters on <math>G</math> can be made into a locally compact abelian group, called the ''dual group'' of <math>G</math> and denoted <math>\\widehat G</math>. The group operation on the dual group is given by pointwise multiplication of characters, the inverse of a character is its complex conjugate and the [[topology]] on the space of characters is that of [[uniform convergence]] on [[compact set]]s (i.e., the [[compact-open topology]], viewing <math>\\widehat{G}</math> as a subset of the space of all continuous functions from <math>G</math> to <math>\\mathbb{T}</math>.).  This topology is in general not metrizable.  However, if the group <math>G</math> is a [[separable space|separable]] locally compact abelian group, then the dual group is metrizable.\n\nThis is analogous to the [[dual space]] in linear algebra: just as for a vector space <math>V</math> over a field <math>K</math>, the dual space is <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(V, K)</math>, so too is the dual group <math>\\mathrm{Hom}(G, \\mathbb{T})</math>. More abstractly, these are both examples of [[representable functor]]s, being represented respectively by <math>K</math> and <math>\\mathbb{T}</math>.\n\nA group that is isomorphic (as topological groups) to its dual group is called ''self-dual''. While the [[real numbers|reals]] and finite [[cyclic group]]s are self-dual, the group and the dual group are not ''naturally'' isomorphic, and should be thought of as two different groups.\n\n===Examples of dual groups===\n\nThe dual of <math>\\Z</math> is isomorphic to the circle group <math>\\mathbb{T}</math>. A character on the [[infinite cyclic group]] of integers <math>\\Z</math> under addition is determined by its value at the generator 1. Thus for any character <math>\\chi</math> on <math>\\Z</math>, <math>\\chi(n) = \\chi(1)^n</math>.  Moreover, this formula defines a character for any choice of <math>\\chi(1)</math> in <math>\\mathbb{T}</math>.  The topology of uniform convergence on compact sets is in this case the topology of [[pointwise convergence]].  This is the topology of the circle group inherited from the complex numbers.\n\nThe dual of <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> is canonically isomorphic with <math>\\Z</math>. Indeed, a character on <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> is of the form <math>z\\mapsto z^n</math> for <math>n</math> an integer.  Since <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> is compact, the topology on the dual group is that of uniform convergence, which turns out to be the [[discrete topology]].\n\nThe group of real numbers <math>\\R</math>, is isomorphic to its own dual; the characters on <math>\\R</math> are of the form <math>r\\mapsto e^{i\\theta r}</math> for <math>\\theta</math> a real number.  With these dualities, the version of the Fourier transform to be introduced next coincides with the classical [[Fourier transform]] on <math>\\R</math>.\n\nAnalogously, the group of <math>p</math>-adic numbers <math>\\Q_p</math> is isomorphic to its dual. (In fact, any finite extension of <math>\\Q_p</math> is also self-dual.) It follows that the [[adele ring|adele]]s are self-dual.\n\n==Pontryagin duality==\n\n[[Pontryagin duality]] asserts that the [[functor]]\n:<math>G \\mapsto \\hat G</math>\ninduces an [[equivalence of categories]] between the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of locally compact abelian groups (with continuous morphisms) and itself:\n:<math>LCA^{op} \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow LCA.</math>\n\n==Categorical properties==\n{{harvtxt|Clausen|2017}} shows that the category LCA of locally compact abelian groups measures, very roughly speaking, the difference between the integers and the reals.

Additionally, if ''K'' is (the interior of) a [[curve of constant width]], then the Minkowski sum of ''K'' and of its 180° rotation is a disk. These two facts can be combined to give a short proof of [[Barbier's theorem]] on the perimeter of curves of constant width.<ref>[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Barbier.shtml The Theorem of Barbier (Java)] at [[cut-the-knot]].</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nMinkowski addition plays a central role in [[mathematical morphology]]. It arises in the [[brush-and-stroke paradigm]] of [[2D computer graphics]] (with various uses, notably by [[Donald E. Knuth]] in [[Metafont]]), and as the [[solid sweep]] operation of [[3D computer graphics]].\n\n===Motion planning===\nMinkowski sums are used in [[motion planning]] of an object among obstacles. They are used for the computation of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], which is the set of all admissible positions of the object.  In the simple model of translational motion of an object in the plane, where the position of an object may be uniquely specified by the position of a fixed point of this object,  the configuration space are the Minkowski sum of the set of obstacles and the movable object placed at the origin and rotated 180 degrees.\n\n===Numerical control (NC) machining===\nIn [[numerical control]] machining, the programming of the NC tool exploits the fact that the Minkowski sum of the [[cutting piece]] with its trajectory gives the shape of the cut in the material.\n\n===3d Solid Modeling===\nIn [[OpenSCAD]] Minkowski sums are used to outline a shape with another shape creating a composite of both shapes.\n\n===Aggregation Theory===\nMinkowski sums are also frequently used in aggregation theory when individual objects to be aggregated are characterized via sets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zelenyuk | first1 = V | year = 2015 | title = Aggregation of scale efficiency | url = https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v240y2015i1p269-277.html | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 240 | issue = 1| pages = 269–277 | doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2014.06.038}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. | last2 = Zelenyuk | first2 = V. | year = 2014 | title = Aggregation of Malmquist productivity indexes allowing for reallocation of resources | url = https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v238y2014i3p774-785.html | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 238 | issue = 3| pages = 774–785 | doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2014.04.003}}</ref>\n\n==Algorithms for computing Minkowski sums==\n[[File:Shapley–Folkman lemma.svg|thumb|300px|alt=Minkowski addition of four line-segments. The left-hand pane displays four sets, which are displayed in a two-by-two array. Each of the sets contains exactly two points, which are displayed in red. In each set, the two points are joined by a pink line-segment, which is the convex hull of the original set. Each set has exactly one point that is indicated with a plus-symbol. In the top row of the two-by-two array, the plus-symbol lies in the interior of the line segment; in the bottom row, the plus-symbol coincides with one of the red-points. This completes the description of the left-hand pane of the diagram. The right-hand pane displays the Minkowski sum of the sets, which is the union of the sums having exactly one point from each summand-set; for the displayed sets, the sixteen sums are distinct points, which are displayed in red: The right-hand red sum-points are the sums of the left-hand red summand-points. The convex hull of the sixteen red-points is shaded in pink. In the pink interior of the right-hand sumset lies exactly one plus-symbol, which is the (unique) sum of the plus-symbols from the right-hand side. The right-hand plus-symbol is indeed the sum of the four plus-symbols from the left-hand sets, precisely two points from the original non-convex summand-sets and two points from the convex hulls of the remaining summand-sets.|\n|Minkowski addition and convex hulls. The sixteen dark-red points (on the right) form the Minkowski sum of the four non-convex sets (on the left), each of which consists of a pair of red points. Their convex hulls (shaded pink) contain plus-signs (+): The right plus-sign is the sum of the left plus-signs.]]\n\n===Planar case===\n\n====Two convex polygons in the plane====\nFor two [[convex polygon]]s P and Q in the plane with m and n vertices, their Minkowski sum is a convex polygon with at most m + n vertices and may be computed in time O (m + n) by a very simple procedure, which may be informally described as follows. Assume that the edges of a polygon are given and the direction, say, counterclockwise, along the polygon boundary. Then it is easily seen that these edges of the convex polygon are ordered by [[polar coordinate system|polar angle]]. Let us [[Merge algorithm|merge the ordered sequences]] of the directed edges from P and Q into a single ordered sequence S. Imagine that these edges are solid [[arrow]]s which can be moved freely while keeping them parallel to their original direction. Assemble these arrows in the order of the sequence S by attaching the tail of the next arrow to the head of the previous arrow. It turns out that the resulting [[polygonal chain]] will in fact be a convex polygon which is the Minkowski sum of P and Q.\n\n====Other====\nIf one polygon is convex and another one is not, the complexity of their Minkowski sum is O(nm). If both of them are nonconvex, their Minkowski sum complexity is O((mn)<sup>2</sup>).\n\n==Essential Minkowski sum==\nThere is also a notion of the '''essential Minkowski sum''' +<sub>e</sub> of two subsets of Euclidean space. Note that the usual Minkowski sum can be written as\n\n:<math>A + B = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\,|\\, A \\cap (z - B) \\neq \\emptyset \\}.</math>\n\nThus, the '''essential Minkowski sum''' is defined by\n\n:<math>A +_{\\mathrm{e}} B = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\,|\\, \\mu \\left[A \\cap (z - B)\\right] > 0 \\},</math>\n\nwhere ''μ'' denotes the ''n''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]. The reason for the term \"essential\" is the following property of [[indicator function]]s: while\n\n:<math>1_{A \\,+\\, B} (z) = \\sup_{x \\,\\in\\, \\mathbb{R}^{n}} 1_{A} (x) 1_{B} (z - x),</math>\n\nit can be seen that\n\n:<math>1_{A \\,+_{\\mathrm{e}}\\, B} (z) = \\mathop{\\mathrm{ess\\,sup}}_{x \\,\\in\\, \\mathbb{R}^{n}} 1_{A} (x) 1_{B} (z - x),</math>\n\nwhere \"ess&thinsp;sup\" denotes the [[essential supremum]].\n\n==''L<sup>p</sup>'' Minkowski sum==\n\nFor ''K'' and ''L'' compact convex subsets in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the Minkowski sum can be described by the [[support function]] of the convex sets:\n:<math> h_{K+L} = h_K + h_L. </math>\nFor ''p ≥ 1'', Firey<ref>{{citation|last=Firey|first=William J.|title=''p''-means of convex bodies|journal=Math.

An abelian group is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite cyclic ''p''-group or to a Prüfer group.\n\nThe Prüfer ''p''-group is the unique infinite [[p-group|''p''-group]] which is [[locally cyclic group|locally cyclic]] (every finite set of elements generates a cyclic group). As seen above, all proper subgroups of '''Z'''(''p''<sup>∞</sup>) are finite. The Prüfer ''p''-groups are the only infinite abelian groups with this property.<ref>See Vil'yams (2001)</ref> \n\nThe Prüfer ''p''-groups are [[divisible group|divisible]]. They play an important role in the classification of divisible groups; along with the rational numbers they are the simplest divisible groups.

It turns out that it is not always a summand, but it ''is'' a pure subgroup.  Under certain mild conditions, pure subgroups are direct summands. So, one can still recover the desired result under those conditions, as in Kulikoff's paper.  Pure subgroups can be used as an intermediate property between a result on direct summands with finiteness conditions and a full result on direct summands with less restrictive finiteness conditions.  Another example of this use is Prüfer's paper, where the fact that \"finite torsion Abelian groups are direct sums of cyclic groups\" is extended to the result that \"all torsion Abelian groups of finite [[exponent (group theory)|exponent]] are direct sums of cyclic groups\" via an intermediate consideration of pure subgroups.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nPure subgroups were generalized in several ways in the theory of abelian groups and modules.  [[Pure submodule]]s were defined in a variety of ways, but eventually settled on the modern definition in terms of tensor products or systems of equations; earlier definitions were usually more direct generalizations such as the single equation used above for n'th roots.  [[Pure injective module|Pure injective]] and pure projective modules follow closely from the ideas of Prüfer's 1923 paper.  While pure projective modules have not found as many applications as pure injectives, they are more closely related to the original work:  A module is pure projective if it is a direct summand of a direct sum of finitely presented modules.  In the case of the integers and Abelian groups a pure projective module amounts to a direct sum of cyclic groups.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* {{cite book | author=Phillip A.

If ''A'' is [[Torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]] then it embeds into a [[vector space]] over the [[rational numbers]] of dimension rank ''A''. For [[finitely generated abelian group]]s, rank is a strong invariant and every such group is determined up to isomorphism by its rank and [[torsion subgroup]]. [[Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] have been completely classified. However, the theory of abelian groups of higher rank is more involved.\n\nThe term rank has a different meaning in the context of [[elementary abelian group]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA subset {''a''<sub>''α''</sub>} of an abelian group is '''[[linearly independent]]''' (over '''Z''') if the only linear combination of these elements that is equal to zero is trivial: if\n\n: <math>\\sum_\\alpha n_\\alpha a_\\alpha = 0, \\quad n_\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{Z},</math>\n\nwhere all but finitely many coefficients ''n''<sub>''α''</sub> are zero (so that the sum is, in effect, finite), then all summands are 0. Any two maximal linearly independent sets in ''A'' have the same [[cardinality]], which is called the '''rank''' of ''A''.\n\nRank of an abelian group is analogous to the [[vector space dimension|dimension]] of a [[vector space]]. The main difference with the case of vector space is a presence of [[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]. An element of an abelian group ''A'' is classified as torsion if its [[order (group theory)|order]] is finite. The set of all torsion elements is a subgroup, called the [[torsion subgroup]] and denoted ''T''(''A''). A group is called torsion-free if it has no non-trivial torsion elements. The factor-group ''A''/''T''(''A'') is the unique maximal torsion-free quotient of ''A'' and its rank coincides with the rank of ''A''.\n\nThe notion of rank with analogous properties can be defined for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over any [[integral domain]], the case of abelian groups corresponding to modules over '''Z'''. For this, see [[finitely generated module#Generic rank]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\n* The rank of an abelian group ''A'' coincides with the dimension of the '''Q'''-vector space ''A'' ⊗ '''Q'''. If ''A'' is torsion-free then the canonical map ''A'' → ''A'' ⊗ '''Q''' is [[injective]] and the rank of ''A'' is the minimum dimension of '''Q'''-vector space containing ''A'' as an abelian subgroup. In particular, any intermediate group '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> < ''A'' < '''Q'''<sup>''n''</sup> has rank ''n''.\n* Abelian groups of rank 0 are exactly the [[periodic group|periodic abelian groups]].\n* The group '''Q''' of rational numbers has rank 1. [[Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are realized as subgroups of '''Q''' and there is a satisfactory classification of them up to isomorphism. By contrast, there is no satisfactory classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 2.<ref>{{citation|first1=Simon|last1=Thomas|first2=Scott|last2=Schneider|contribution=Countable Borel equivalence relations|title=Appalachian Set Theory: 2006-2012|volume=406|series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series|editor1-first=James|editor1-last=Cummings|editor2-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Schimmerling|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781107608504|pages=25–62|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139208574.003|citeseerx=10.1.1.648.3113}}.

For instance, for every cardinal ''d'' there exist torsion-free abelian groups of rank ''d'' that are [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]], i.e. cannot be expressed as a direct sum of a pair of their proper subgroups. These examples demonstrate that torsion-free abelian group of rank greater than 1 cannot be simply built by direct sums from torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1, whose theory is well understood. Moreover, for every integer <math>n\\ge 3</math>, there is a torsion-free abelian group of rank <math>2n-2</math> that is simultaneously a sum of two indecomposable groups, and a sum of ''n'' indecomposable groups.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Hence even the number of indecomposable summands of a group of an even rank greater or equal than 4 is not well-defined.\n\nAnother result about non-uniqueness of direct sum decompositions is due to A.L.S. Corner: given integers <math>n\\ge k\\ge 1</math>, there exists a torsion-free abelian group ''A'' of rank ''n'' such that for any partition <math>n = r_1 + \\cdots + r_k</math> into ''k'' natural summands, the group ''A'' is the direct sum of ''k'' indecomposable subgroups of ranks <math>r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k</math>.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Thus the sequence of ranks of indecomposable summands in a certain direct sum decomposition of a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank is very far from being an invariant of ''A''.\n\nOther surprising examples include torsion-free rank 2 groups ''A''<sub>''n'',''m''</sub> and ''B''<sub>''n'',''m''</sub> such that ''A''<sup>''n''</sup> is isomorphic to ''B''<sup>''n''</sup> if and only if ''n'' is divisible by ''m''.\n\nFor abelian groups of infinite rank, there is an example of a group ''K'' and a subgroup ''G'' such that \n* ''K'' is indecomposable; \n* ''K'' is generated by ''G'' and a single other element; and \n* Every nonzero direct summand of ''G'' is decomposable.\n\n==Generalization==\nThe notion of rank can be generalized for any module ''M'' over an [[integral domain]] ''R'', as the dimension over ''R''<sub>0</sub>, the [[quotient field]], of the [[tensor product]] of the module with the field:\n::<math>\\text{rank} (M)=\\dim_{R_0} M\\otimes_R R_0</math>\nIt makes sense, since ''R''<sub>0</sub> is a field, and thus any module (or, to be more specific, [[vector space]]) over it is free.\n\nIt is a generalization, since any abelian group is a module over the integers. It easily follows that the dimension of the product over '''Q''' is the cardinality of maximal linearly independent subset, since for any torsion element x and any rational q\n::<math>x\\otimes_{\\mathbf Z} q = 0</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rank of a group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Abelian group theory]]"

Some authors use this as the definition of a torsion element but this definition does not work well over more general rings.\n\nA module ''M'' over a ring ''R'' is called a ''torsion module'' if all its elements are torsion elements, and ''[[Torsion-free module|torsion-free]]'' if zero is the only torsion element.  If the ring ''R'' is an integral domain then the set of all torsion elements forms a submodule of ''M'', called the ''torsion submodule'' of ''M'', sometimes denoted T(''M''). If ''R'' is not commutative, T(''M'') may or may not be a submodule. It is shown in {{harv|Lam|2007}} that ''R'' is a right [[Ore condition|Ore ring]] if and only if T(''M'') is a submodule of ''M'' for all right ''R'' modules. Since right Noetherian domains are Ore, this covers the case when ''R'' is a right [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] (which might not be commutative).\n\nMore generally, let ''M'' be a module over a ring ''R'' and ''S'' be a multiplicatively closed subset of ''R''. An element ''m'' of ''M'' is called an ''S''-torsion element if there exists an element ''s'' in ''S'' such that ''s'' annihilates ''m'', i.e., {{nowrap|1=''s''&thinsp;''m'' = 0.}} In particular, one can take for ''S'' the set of regular elements of the ring ''R'' and recover the definition above.\n\nAn element ''g'' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is called a ''torsion element'' of the group if it has finite [[order (group theory)|order]], i.e., if there is a positive [[integer]] ''m'' such that ''g''<sup>''m''</sup> = ''e'', where ''e'' denotes the [[identity element]] of the group, and ''g''<sup>''m''</sup> denotes the product of ''m'' copies of ''g''. A group is called a ''[[torsion group |torsion (or periodic) group]]'' if all its elements are torsion elements, and a ''torsion-free group'' if the only torsion element is the identity element. Any [[abelian group]] may be viewed as a module over the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s, and in this case the two notions of torsion coincide.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n# Let ''M'' be a [[free module]] over any ring ''R''. Then it follows immediately from the definitions that ''M'' is torsion-free (if the ring ''R'' is not a domain then torsion is considered with respect to the set ''S'' of non-zero divisors of ''R''). In particular, any [[free abelian group]] is torsion-free and any [[vector space]] over a field '''K''' is torsion-free when viewed as the module over '''K'''. \n# By contrast with Example 1, any [[finite group]] (abelian or not) is periodic and finitely generated. [[Burnside's problem]] asks whether, conversely, any finitely generated periodic group must be finite. (The answer is \"no\" in general, even if the period is fixed.)\n# The torsion elements of the [[multiplicative group]] of a field are its [[root of unity|roots of unity]].\n# In the [[modular group]], '''Γ''' obtained from the group SL(2,'''Z''') of two by two integer matrices with unit determinant by factoring out its center, any nontrivial torsion element either has order two and is conjugate to the element ''S'' or has order three and is conjugate to the element ''ST''. In this case, torsion elements do not form a subgroup, for example, ''S''&nbsp;·&nbsp;''ST''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''T'', which has infinite order.\n# The abelian group '''Q'''/'''Z''', consisting of the rational numbers (mod 1), is periodic, i.e. every element has finite order. Analogously, the module '''K'''(''t'')/'''K'''[''t''] over the ring ''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K'''[''t''] of [[polynomial]]s in one variable is pure torsion. Both these examples can be generalized as follows: if ''R'' is a commutative domain and ''Q'' is its field of fractions, then ''Q''/''R'' is a torsion ''R''-module.\n# The torsion subgroup of ('''R'''/'''Z''',+) is ('''Q'''/'''Z''',+) while the groups ('''R''',+),('''Z''',+) are torsion-free.  The quotient of a [[torsion-free abelian group]] by a subgroup is torsion-free exactly when the subgroup is a [[pure subgroup]].\n# Consider a linear operator '''L''' acting on a finite-dimensional vector space '''V'''. If we view '''V''' as an '''F'''['''L''']-module in the natural way, then (as a result of many things, either simply by finite-dimensionality or as a consequence of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]), '''V''' is a torsion '''F'''['''L''']-module.\n\n== Case of a principal ideal domain ==\n\nSuppose that ''R'' is a (commutative) [[principal ideal domain]] and ''M'' is a [[finitely-generated module|finitely-generated ''R''-module]]. Then the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]] gives a detailed description of the module ''M'' up to isomorphism. In particular, it claims that \n\n: <math> M \\simeq F\\oplus T(M), </math>\n\nwhere ''F'' is a free ''R''-module of finite rank (depending only on ''M'')  and T(''M'') is the torsion submodule of ''M''. As a corollary, any finitely-generated torsion-free module over ''R'' is free. This corollary ''does not'' hold for more general commutative domains, even for ''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''K'''[''x'',''y''], the ring of polynomials in two variables.\nFor non-finitely generated modules, the above direct decomposition is not true. The torsion subgroup of an abelian group may not be a direct summand of it.\n\n== Torsion and localization ==\n\nAssume that ''R'' is a commutative domain and ''M'' is an ''R''-module. Let ''Q'' be the [[quotient field]] of the ring ''R''. Then one can consider the ''Q''-module \n\n: <math> M_Q = M \\otimes_R Q, </math>\n\nobtained from ''M'' by [[extension of scalars]]. Since ''Q'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], a module over ''Q'' is a [[vector space]], possibly, infinite-dimensional. There is a canonical homomorphism of abelian groups from ''M'' to ''M''<sub>''Q''</sub>, and the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this homomorphism is precisely the torsion submodule T(''M''). More generally, if ''S'' is a multiplicatively closed subset of the ring ''R'', then we may consider [[localization of a module|localization]] of the ''R''-module ''M'',\n\n: <math> M_S = M \\otimes_R R_S, </math>\n\nwhich is a module over the [[localization of a ring|localization]] ''R''<sub>''S''</sub>. There is a canonical map from ''M'' to ''M''<sub>''S''</sub>, whose kernel is precisely the ''S''-torsion submodule of ''M''.\nThus the torsion submodule of ''M'' can be interpreted as the set of the elements that 'vanish in the localization'. The same interpretation continues to hold in the non-commutative setting for rings satisfying the Ore condition, or more generally for any [[Ore condition#Multiplicative sets|right denominator set]] ''S'' and right ''R''-module ''M''.\n\n== Torsion in homological algebra ==\n\nThe concept of torsion plays an important role in [[homological algebra]]. If ''M'' and ''N'' are two modules over a commutative ring ''R'' (for example, two abelian groups, when ''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''Z'''), [[Tor functor]]s yield a family of ''R''-modules Tor<sub>''i''</sub>(''M'',''N''). The ''S''-torsion of an ''R''-module ''M'' is canonically isomorphic to Tor<sup>R</sup><sub>1</sub>(''M'',&nbsp;''R''<sub>''S''</sub>/''R'') by the long exact sequence of Tor<sup>R</sup><sub>*</sub>: The short exact sequence <math>0\\to R\\to R_S \\to R_S/R \\to 0</math> of ''R''-modules yields an exact sequence <math>0\\to\\operatorname{Tor}^R_1(M, R_S/R)\\to M\\to M_S</math>, hence <math>\\operatorname{Tor}^R_1(M, R_S/R)</math> is the kernel of the localisation map of ''M''. The symbol Tor denoting the functors reflects this relation with the algebraic torsion.

An abelian group ''A'' is called a '''torsion''' (or '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''') group if every element of ''A'' has finite order and is called '''torsion-free''' if every element of ''A'' except the [[identity element|identity]] is of infinite order.\n\nThe proof that ''A<sub>T</sub>'' is closed under addition relies on the commutativity of addition (see examples section).\n\nIf ''A'' is abelian, then the torsion subgroup ''T'' is a [[characteristic subgroup|fully characteristic subgroup]] of ''A'' and the factor group ''A''/''T'' is torsion-free. There is a [[covariant functor]] from the [[category of abelian groups]] to the category of torsion groups that sends every group to its torsion subgroup and every [[Group homomorphism|homomorphism]] to its restriction to the torsion subgroup. There is another covariant functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of torsion-free groups that sends every group to its quotient by its torsion subgroup, and sends every homomorphism to the obvious induced homomorphism (which is easily seen to be well-defined).\n\nIf ''A'' is finitely generated and abelian, then it can be written as the [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of its torsion subgroup ''T'' and a torsion-free subgroup (but this is not true for all infinitely generated abelian groups). In any decomposition of ''A'' as a direct sum of a torsion subgroup ''S'' and a torsion-free subgroup, ''S'' must equal ''T'' (but the torsion-free subgroup is not uniquely determined). This is a key step in the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s.\n\n==''p''-power torsion subgroups==\nFor any abelian group <math>(A, +)\\;</math> and any [[prime number]] ''p'' the set ''A<sub>Tp</sub>'' of elements of ''A'' that have order a power of ''p'' is a subgroup called the ''' ''p''-power torsion subgroup'''  or, more loosely, the ''' ''p''-torsion subgroup''':\n\n:<math>A_{T_p}=\\{a\\in A \\;|\\; \\exists n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\;, p^n a = 0\\}.\\;</math>\n\nThe torsion subgroup ''A<sub>T</sub>'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of its ''p''-power torsion subgroups over all prime numbers ''p'':\n\n:<math>A_T \\cong \\bigoplus_{p\\in P} A_{T_p}.\\;</math>\n\nWhen ''A'' is a finite abelian group, ''A<sub>Tp</sub>'' coincides with the unique [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow p-subgroup]] of ''A''.\n\nEach ''p''-power torsion subgroup of ''A'' is a [[characteristic subgroup|fully characteristic subgroup]]. More strongly, any homomorphism between abelian groups sends each ''p''-power torsion subgroup into the corresponding ''p''-power torsion subgroup.\n\nFor each prime number ''p'', this provides a [[functor]] from the category of abelian groups to the category of ''p''-power torsion groups that sends every group to its ''p''-power torsion subgroup, and restricts every homomorphism to the ''p''-torsion subgroups. The product over the set of all prime numbers of the restriction of these functors to the category of torsion groups, is a [[faithful functor]] from the category of torsion groups to the product over all prime numbers of the categories of ''p''-torsion groups. In a sense, this means that studying ''p''-torsion groups in isolation tells us everything about torsion groups in general.\n\n==Examples and further results==\n[[Image:Lattice torsion points.svg|right|thumb|200px|The 4-torsion subgroup of the quotient group of the complex numbers under addition by a lattice.]]\n\n*The torsion subset of a non-abelian group is not, in general, a subgroup.

Not every torsion group is finite however: consider the direct sum of a [[countably infinite|countable]] number of copies of the [[cyclic group]] ''C''<sub>2</sub>; this is a torsion group since every element has order 2. Nor need there be an upper bound on the orders of elements in a torsion group if it isn't [[generating set of a group|finitely generated]], as the example of the [[factor group]] '''Q'''/'''Z''' shows.\n*Every [[free abelian group]] is torsion-free, but the converse is not true, as is shown by the additive group of the [[rational number]]s '''Q'''.\n*Even if ''A'' is not finitely generated, the ''size'' of its torsion-free part is uniquely determined, as is explained in more detail in the article on [[rank of an abelian group]].\n*An abelian group ''A'' is torsion-free [[if and only if]] it is [[flat module|flat]] as a '''Z'''-[[module (mathematics)|module]], which means that whenever ''C'' is a subgroup of some abelian group ''B'', then the natural map from the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product]] ''C'' ⊗ ''A'' to ''B'' ⊗ ''A'' is [[injective]].\n*Tensoring an abelian group ''A'' with '''Q''' (or any [[divisible group]]) kills torsion. That is, if ''T'' is a torsion group then ''T'' ⊗ '''Q''' = 0. For a general abelian group ''A'' with torsion subgroup ''T'' one has ''A'' ⊗ '''Q''' ≅ ''A''/''T'' ⊗ '''Q'''.\n*Taking the torsion subgroup makes torsion abelian groups into a [[coreflective subcategory]] of abelian groups, while taking the quotient by the torsion subgroup makes torsion-free abelian groups into a [[reflective subcategory]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Torsion (algebra)]]\n* [[Torsion-free abelian group]]\n* [[Torsion abelian group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Epstein, D.

      "text": "{{context|date=May 2017}}\nInfinitely generated [[abelian group]]s have very complex structure and are far less well understood than [[finitely generated abelian groups]]. Even [[torsion-free abelian group]]s are vastly more varied in their characteristics than [[vector space]]s. Torsion-free abelian groups of [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] 1 are far more amenable than those of higher rank, and a satisfactory classification exists, even though there are an [[uncountable]] number of isomorphism classes.\n\n==Definition==\n\nA torsion-free abelian group of rank 1 is an abelian group such that every element except the identity has infinite order, and for any two non-identity elements ''a'' and ''b'' there is a non-trivial relation between them over the integers:\n\n:<math> n a + m b = 0 \\;</math>\n\n==Classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1==\n\nFor any non-identity element ''a'' in such a group and any prime number ''p'' there may or may not be another element ''a<sub>p<sup>n</sup></sub>'' such that:\n\n:<math>p^n a_{p^n} = a\\;</math>\n\nIf such an element exists for every ''n'', we say the ''' ''p''-root type of ''a'' is infinity''', otherwise, if ''n'' is the largest non-negative integer that there is such an element, we say the ''' ''p''-root type of ''a'' is ''n'' '''.\n\nWe call the sequence of ''p''-root types of an element ''a'' for all primes the '''root-type''' of ''a'':\n\n:<math>T(a)=\\{t_2,t_3,t_5,\\ldots\\}\\;</math>.\n\nIf ''b'' is another non-identity element of the group, then there is a non-trivial relation between ''a'' and ''b'':\n\n:<math>n a + m b = 0\\;</math>\n\nwhere we may take ''n'' and ''m'' to be [[coprime]].\n\nAs a consequence of this the root-type of ''b'' differs from the root-type of ''a'' only by a finite difference at a finite number of indices (corresponding to those primes which divide either ''n'' or ''m'').\n\nWe call the '''co-finite equivalence class of a root-type''' to be the set of root-types that differ from it by a finite difference at a finite number of indices. \n\nThe co-finite equivalence class of the type of a non-identity element is a well-defined invariant of a torsion-free abelian group of rank 1. We call this invariant the '''type''' of a torsion-free abelian group of rank 1. \n\nIf two torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have the same type they may be shown to be isomorphic.

Deshpande, {{ISBN|1-84265-189-7}}</ref>\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\nMultiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have\n\n:<math>x+(-1)\\cdot x=1\\cdot x+(-1)\\cdot x=(1+(-1))\\cdot x=0 \\cdot x=0</math>\n\nwhere we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation\n\n:<math>0\\cdot x=(0+0)\\cdot x=0\\cdot x+0\\cdot x \\, </math>\n\n[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]\n\nIn other words,\n\n:<math>x+(-1)\\cdot x=0 \\, </math>\n\nso (−1)&nbsp;·&nbsp;''x'', or&nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.\n\n=== Square of −1 ===\nThe [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.\n\nFor an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation\n\n:<math>0 =-1\\cdot 0 =-1\\cdot [1+(-1)]</math>\n\nThe first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that\n\n:<math>0 =-1\\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\\cdot1+(-1)\\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\\cdot(-1)</math>\n\nThe second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies\n\n:<math>(-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1</math>\n\nThe above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.\n\n=== Square roots of −1 ===\nAlthough there are no [[Real number|real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''<sup>2</sup> = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number whose square is 1 is −''i''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''<sup>2</sup> = −1 has infinitely many solutions]].\n\n== Exponentiation to negative integers ==\n[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''<sup>−1</sup> = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''<sup>''a''</sup>''x''<sup>''b''</sup> = ''x''<sup>(''a'' + ''b'')</sup> for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.\n\nExponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''<sup>−1</sup> as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.\n\n−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''<sup>−1</sup>(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin<sup>−1</sup>(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.\n\n== Computer representation ==\n{{Main|Signed number representations}}\nMost computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring \"11111111\", or \"FF\" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string \"11111111\" above represents 2<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;255.\n\n== Programming languages ==\nIn some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then −1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.\nIf the first item is indexed by 0, then −1 identifies the last item.\nIf the first item is indexed by 1, then −1 identifies the second-to-last item.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Menelaus's theorem]]\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Integers|-8]]\n[[Category:1 (number)|Negative one]]\n[[Category:Negative concepts]]"

The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a ''space'' between sexagesimal numerals. By 300&nbsp;BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholder]] in the same [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian system]]. In a tablet unearthed at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (dating from about 700&nbsp;BC), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Kaplan, Robert. (2000). ''The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nThe Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder.

For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as \"Arabic numerals\". The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:\n\n<blockquote>After my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the [[Hinduism|Hindus]] (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0&nbsp; ... any number may be written.<ref>Sigler, L.,  ''Fibonacci's Liber Abaci''.

From the 13th&nbsp;century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called ''[[algorism]]us'' after the Persian mathematician al-Khwārizmī. The most popular was written by [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]], about 1235 and was one of the earliest scientific books to be ''printed'' in 1488. Until the late 15th&nbsp;century, Hindu–Arabic numerals seem to have predominated among mathematicians, while merchants preferred to use the [[Roman numerals]].

Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a [[leading zero]] may be used to distinguish a number.\n\n===Elementary algebra===\nThe number 0 is the smallest [[non-negative]] integer. The [[natural number]] following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0.

It cannot be prime because it has an [[infinity|infinite]] number of [[divisor|factors]], and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed as a product of prime numbers (0 must always be one of the factors).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Constance |title=From zero to infinity: what makes numbers interesting |year=1992 |edition=4th |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3NFIvrTk4sC&pg=PA23&dq=zero+neither+prime+nor+composite&q=zero%20neither%20prime%20nor%20composite |isbn=978-0-88385-505-8}}</ref> Zero is, however, [[Parity (mathematics)|even]] (as well as being a multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number).\n\nThe following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number ''x'', unless otherwise stated.\n* Addition: ''x'' + 0 = 0 + ''x'' = ''x''. That is, 0 is an [[identity element]] (or neutral element) with respect to addition.\n* Subtraction: ''x'' − 0 = ''x'' and 0 − ''x'' = −''x''.\n* Multiplication: ''x'' · 0 = 0 · ''x'' = 0.\n* Division: {{sfrac|0|''x''}} = 0, for nonzero ''x''. But {{sfrac|''x''|0}} is [[Defined and undefined|undefined]], because 0 has no [[multiplicative inverse]] (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule.\n* Exponentiation: ''x''<sup>0</sup> = {{sfrac|''x''|''x''}} = 1, except that the case ''x'' = 0 may be left undefined in some [[0 to the power of 0|contexts]]. For all positive real ''x'', {{nowrap|0<sup>''x''</sup> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe expression {{sfrac|0|0}}, which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form {{sfrac|''f''(''x'')|''g''(''x'')}} as a result of applying the [[limit of a function|lim]] operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called \"[[indeterminate form]]\". That does not simply mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of {{sfrac|''f''(''x'')|''g''(''x'')}}, if it exists, must be found by another method, such as [[l'Hôpital's rule]].\n\nThe sum of 0 numbers (the ''[[empty sum]]'') is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the ''[[empty product]]'') is 1. The [[factorial]] 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.\n\n===Other branches of mathematics===\n* In [[set theory]], 0 is the [[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]]: if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is ''[[definition|defined]]'' to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]] for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.\n* Also in set theory, 0 is the lowest [[ordinal number]], corresponding to the empty set viewed as a [[well-order|well-ordered set]].\n* In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], 0 may be used to denote the [[truth value]] false.\n* In [[abstract algebra]], 0 is commonly used to denote a [[zero element]], which is a [[Identity element|neutral element]] for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an [[absorbing element]] for multiplication (if defined).\n* In [[lattice (order)|lattice theory]], 0 may denote the [[Greatest element|bottom element]] of a [[Lattice (order)|bounded lattice]].\n* In [[category theory]], 0 is sometimes used to denote an [[initial and terminal objects|initial object]] of a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n* In [[recursion theory]], 0 can be used to denote the [[Turing degree]] of the [[computable function|partial computable functions]].\n\n===Related mathematical terms===\n* A [[root of a function|zero of a function]] ''f'' is a point ''x'' in the domain of the function such that {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}}. When there are finitely many zeros these are called the roots of the function. This is related to [[zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] of a [[holomorphic function]].\n* The '''zero function''' (or zero map) on a domain ''D'' is the [[constant function]] with 0 as its only possible output value, i.e., the function ''f'' defined by {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} for all ''x'' in ''D''. The zero function is the only function that is both [[Even function|even]] and [[Odd function|odd]]. A particular zero function is a [[zero morphism]] in category theory; e.g., a zero map is the identity in the additive group of functions. The [[determinant]] on non-invertible [[Matrix (mathematics)|square matrices]] is a zero map.\n* Several branches of mathematics have [[zero element]]s, which generalize either the property {{nowrap|0 + ''x'' {{=}} ''x''}}, or the property {{nowrap|0 · ''x'' {{=}} 0,}} or both.\n\n==Physics==\nThe value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] (as measured in [[kelvin]]s) [[absolute zero|zero]] is the lowest possible value ([[negative temperature]]s are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of water. Measuring sound intensity in [[decibel]]s or [[phon]]s, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In [[physics]], the [[zero-point energy]] is the lowest possible energy that a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[physical system]] may possess and is the energy of the [[Stationary state|ground state]] of the system.\n\n==Chemistry==\nZero has been proposed as the [[atomic number]] of the theoretical element [[tetraneutron]]. It has been shown that a cluster of four [[neutron]]s may be stable enough to be considered an [[atom]] in its own right. This would create an [[chemical element|element]] with no [[proton]]s and no charge on its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].\n\nAs early as 1926, Andreas von Antropoff coined the term [[neutronium]] for a conjectured form of [[matter]] made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the [[periodic table]]. It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements.\n\n==Computer science==\nThe most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic [[computer science]] programming languages such as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]]. However, in the late 1950s [[LISP]] introduced [[zero-based numbering]] for arrays while [[Algol 58]] introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an [[Array data type|array]] are numbered starting from 0 in [[C (computer language)|C]], so that for an array of ''n'' items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to {{nowrap|''n''−1}}. This permits an array element's location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of the array, whereas 1-based languages precalculate the array's base address to be the position one element before the first.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThere can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing, for example Java's [[JDBC]] indexes parameters from 1 although [[Java (programming language)|Java]] itself uses 0-based indexing.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a [[null (SQL)|null value]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdLsCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT197&dq=%C2%A0In+databases,+it+is+possible+for+a+field+not+to+have+a+value+(null)#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0In%20databases,%20it%20is%20possible%20for%20a%20field%20not%20to%20have%20a%20value%20(null)&f=false |title=Knowledge-Base Assisted Database Retrieval Systems |last=Wu |first=X. |last2=Ichikawa |first2=T. |last3=Cercone |first3=N. |date=1996-10-25 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-4501-75-0 |language=en}}</ref> For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to [[Ternary logic|three-valued logic]]. No longer is a condition either ''true'' or ''false'', but it can be ''undetermined''. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA [[null pointer]] is a pointer in a computer program that does not point to any object or function. In C, the integer constant 0 is converted into the null pointer at [[compile time]] when it appears in a pointer context, and so 0 is a standard way to refer to the null pointer in code. However, the internal representation of the null pointer may be any bit pattern (possibly different values for different data types).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn mathematics {{nowrap|−0 {{=}} +0 {{=}} 0;}} both −0 and +0 represent exactly the same number, i.e., there is no \"positive zero\" or \"negative zero\" distinct from zero. However, in some computer hardware [[signed number representations]], zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives; this kind of dual representation is known as [[signed zero]], with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the [[signed magnitude]] and [[one's complement]] binary integer representations (but not the [[two's complement]] binary form used in most modern computers), and most [[floating point]] number representations (such as [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] and [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|IBM S/390]] floating point formats).\n\nIn binary, 0 represents the value for \"off\", which means no electricity flow.{{sfn|Chris Woodford|2006|p=9}}\n\nZero is the value of false in many programming languages.\n\nThe [[Unix epoch]] (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of January 1970.<ref>\nPaul DuBois.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=lFsaBAAAQBAJ \"MySQL Cookbook: Solutions for Database Developers and Administrators\"]\n2014.\np. 204.\n</ref><ref>\nArnold Robbins; Nelson Beebe.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=J9WbAgAAQBAJ \"Classic Shell Scripting\"].\n2005.\np. 274\n</ref><ref>\nIztok Fajfar.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHq9CgAAQBAJ \"Start Programming Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\"].\n2015.\np. 160.\n</ref>\n\nThe [[MacOS]] [[epoch (computing)|epoch]] and [[Palm OS]] epoch (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of January 1904.<ref>\nDarren R.

In some countries, dialling 0 places a call for [[operator assistance]].\n* DVDs that can be played in any region are sometimes referred to as being \"[[region 0]]\"\n* [[Roulette]] wheels usually feature a \"0\" space (and sometimes also a \"00\" space), whose presence is ignored when calculating payoffs (thereby allowing the house to win in the long run).\n* In [[Formula One]], if the reigning [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]] no longer competes in Formula One in the year following their victory in the title race, 0 is given to one of the drivers of the team that the reigning champion won the title with. This happened in 1993 and 1994, with [[Damon Hill]] driving car 0, due to the reigning World Champion ([[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Alain Prost]] respectively) not competing in the championship.\n* On the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], in most states exits are numbered based on the nearest milepost from the highway's western or southern terminus within that state. Several that are less than half a mile (800 m) from state boundaries in that direction are numbered as Exit 0.\n\n==Symbols and representations==\n{{Main|Symbols for zero}}\n[[File:Text figures 036.svg|71px|alt=horizontal guidelines with a zero touching top and bottom, a three dipping below, and a six cresting above the guidelines, from left to right|left]]\nThe modern numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter [[O]] more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0.<ref name=\"bemer\"/> [[Typewriter]]s originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0.

The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on [[IBM 3270]] displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as [[Andalé Mono]], and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-O–digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular (closer to a rectangle). A further distinction is made in [[FE-Schrift|falsification-hindering typeface]] as used on [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|German car number plates]] by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. Sometimes the digit 0 is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether.\n\n==Year label==\n{{Main|Year zero}}\nIn the [[Before Christ|BC]] [[calendar era]], the year 1&nbsp;BC is the first year before AD&nbsp;1; there is not a [[year zero]].

One is also the result of the [[empty product]], as any number multiplied by one is itself.

This is more formally referred to as a [[unary numeral system]]. Unlike [[base&nbsp;2]] or [[base&nbsp;10]], this is not a [[positional notation]].\n\nSince the base 1 exponential function (1<sup>''x''</sup>) always equals 1, its [[inverse function|inverse]] does not exist (which would be called the [[logarithm]] base&nbsp;1 if it did exist).\n\nThere are two ways to write the real number 1 as a [[recurring decimal]]: as 1.000..., and as [[0.999...]].\n\nFormalizations of the natural numbers have their own representations of 1:\n*in the [[Peano axioms]], 1 is the [[Successor function|successor]] of 0;\n*in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', 1 is defined as the set of all [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] (sets with one element);\n*in the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]] of natural numbers, 1 is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {0}.\n\nIn a multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] or [[monoid]], the [[identity element]] is sometimes denoted 1, but ''e'' (from the German ''Einheit'', \"unity\") is also traditional. However, 1 is especially common for the multiplicative identity of a ring, i.e., when an addition and 0 are also present. When such a ring has [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''n'' not equal to 0, the element called 1 has the property that {{nowrap|''n''1 {{=}} 1''n'' {{=}} 0}} (where this 0 is the additive identity of the ring). Important examples are [[finite field]]s.\n\n1 is the first [[figurate number]] of every kind, such as [[triangular number]], [[pentagonal number]] and [[centered hexagonal number]], to name just a few.\n\nIn many mathematical and engineering problems, numeric values are typically ''normalized'' to fall within the [[unit interval]] from 0 to 1, where 1 usually represents the maximum possible value in the range of parameters.  Likewise, [[vector space|vectors]] are often normalized to give [[unit vector]]s, that is vectors of magnitude one, because these often have more desirable properties. Functions, too, are often normalized by the condition that they have [[integral]] one, maximum value one, or [[square integrable|square integral]] one, depending on the application.\n\nBecause of the multiplicative identity, if ''f''(''x'') is a [[multiplicative function]], then ''f''(1) must equal 1.\n\nIt is also the first and second number in the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] sequence (0 is the zeroth) and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences.\n\n1 is neither a [[prime number]] nor a [[composite number]], but a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (meaning of [[ring theory]]), like −1 and, in the [[Gaussian integers]], ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'' and −''i''. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] guarantees [[factorization|unique factorization]] over the integers only up to units. (For example, {{nowrap|4 {{=}} 2{{sup|2}}}}, but if units are included, is also equal to, say, {{nowrap|(−1){{sup|6}} × 1{{sup|23}} × 2{{sup|2}},}} among infinitely many similar \"factorizations\".)\n\nThe definition of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] requires that 1 must not be equal to [[zero|0]]. Thus, there are no fields of characteristic 1. Nevertheless, abstract algebra can consider the [[field with one element]], which is not a singleton and is not a set at all.\n\n1 is the only positive integer divisible by exactly one positive integer (whereas prime numbers are divisible by exactly two positive integers, composite numbers are divisible by more than two positive integers, and zero is divisible by all positive integers). 1 was formerly considered prime by some mathematicians, using the definition that a prime is divisible only by 1 and itself. However, this complicates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, so modern definitions exclude units.\n\nBy definition, 1 is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[absolute value]], or [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a [[unit complex number]], [[unit vector]], and a [[identity matrix|unit matrix]] (more usually called an identity matrix). Note that the term ''unit matrix'' is sometimes used to mean something [[Matrix of ones|quite different]].\n\nBy definition, 1 is the [[probability]] of an event that is [[almost certain]] to occur.\n\n1 is the most common leading digit in many sets of data, a consequence of [[Benford's law]].\n\n1 is the only known [[Tamagawa number]] for a simply connected algebraic group over a number field.\n\nThe [[generating function]] that has all coefficients 1 is given by\n\n<math> \\frac{1}{1-x} = 1+x+x^2+x^3+ \\ldots </math>\n\nThis power series converges and has finite value [[if and only if]], <math> |x| < 1 </math>.<!--Probably not needed, really should look at convergence theorem as there are other series that converge iff <math> |x| < 1 </math> -->\n\nIn [[category theory]], 1 is sometimes used to denote the [[terminal object]] of a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\nIn [[number theory]], 1 is the value of [[Legendre's constant]], which was introduced in 1808 by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in expressing the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic behavior]] of the [[prime-counting function]]. Legendre's constant was originally conjectured to be approximately 1.08366, but was proven to equal exactly 1 in 1899.\n\n=== Table of basic calculations ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\"|[[Multiplication]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!11\n\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!21\n!22\n!23\n!24\n!25\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!50\n!100\n!1000\n|-\n|'''1 × ''x'''''\n|'''1'''\n|[[2 (number)|2]]\n|[[3 (number)|3]]\n|[[4 (number)|4]]\n|[[5 (number)|5]]\n|[[6 (number)|6]]\n|[[7 (number)|7]]\n|[[8 (number)|8]]\n|[[9 (number)|9]]\n|[[10 (number)|10]]\n!\n|[[11 (number)|11]]\n|[[12 (number)|12]]\n|[[13 (number)|13]]\n|[[14 (number)|14]]\n|[[15 (number)|15]]\n|[[16 (number)|16]]\n|[[17 (number)|17]]\n|[[18 (number)|18]]\n|[[19 (number)|19]]\n|[[20 (number)|20]]\n!\n|[[21 (number)|21]]\n|[[22 (number)|22]]\n|[[23 (number)|23]]\n|[[24 (number)|24]]\n|[[25 (number)|25]]\n!\n|[[50 (number)|50]]\n|[[100 (number)|100]]\n|[[1000 (number)|1000]]\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\"|[[Division (mathematics)|Division]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n|-\n|'''1 ÷ ''x'''''\n|'''1'''\n|0.5\n|0.{{overline|3}}\n|0.25\n|0.2\n|0.1{{overline|6}}\n|0.{{overline|142857}}\n|0.125\n|0.{{overline|1}}\n|0.1\n!\n|0.{{overline|09}}\n|0.08{{overline|3}}\n|0.{{overline|076923}}\n|0.0{{overline|714285}}\n|0.0{{overline|6}}\n|-\n|'''''x'' ÷ 1'''\n|'''1'''\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|7\n|8\n|9\n|10\n!\n|11\n|12\n|13\n|14\n|15\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\"|[[Exponentiation]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n|-\n|'''1{{sup|''x''}}'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n!\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|'''1'''\n|-\n|'''''x''{{sup|1}}'''\n|'''1'''\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|7\n|8\n|9\n|10\n!\n|11\n|12\n|13\n|14\n|15\n|16\n|17\n|18\n|19\n|20\n|}\n\n== In technology ==\n[[File:U+2673 DejaVu Sans.svg|50px|right|alt=Chasing-arrow triangle with numeral one within|1 as a resin identification code, used in recycling]]\n* The [[resin identification code]] used in recycling to identify [[polyethylene terephthalate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&DID=4645&DOC=FILE.PDF |title=Plastic Packaging Resins |publisher=American Chemistry Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103005/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&DID=4645&DOC=FILE.PDF |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df=}}</ref>\n*The [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] country code for the [[North American Numbering Plan]] area, which includes the United States, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean\n*A [[binary code]] is a sequence of 1 and [[0 (number)|0]] that is used in [[computer]]s for representing any kind of [[data]].\n*In many physical devices, 1 represents the value for \"on\", which means that electricity is flowing.<ref name=Woodford>{{citation |first=Chris |last=Woodford |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My7Zr0aP2L8C&pg=PA9 |title=Digital Technology |date=2006 |publisher=Evans Brothers |isbn=978-0-237-52725-9 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=Godbole>{{citation |first=Achyut S. |last=Godbole |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SN_46YHs27MC&pg=PA34 |title=Data Comms & Networks |date=1 September 2002 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-1-259-08223-8 |page=34}}</ref>\n*The numerical value of [[Boolean data type|true]] in many programming languages.\n*1 is the [[ASCII]] code of \"[[Start-of-Header|Start of Header]]\".\n\n== In science ==\n*[[Dimensionless quantities]] are also known as quantities of dimension one.\n*1 is the atomic number of [[hydrogen]].\n*+1 is the [[electric charge]] of [[positron]]s and protons.\n*Group 1 of the [[periodic table]] consists of the [[alkali metals]].\n*Period 1 of the periodic table consists of just two elements, [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].\n*The dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] has the minor-planet designation 1 Ceres because it was the first asteroid to be discovered.\n*The Roman numeral I often stands for the first-discovered satellite of a [[planet]] or [[minor planet]] (such as Neptune I, a.k.a.

It is the [[natural number]] following [[1]] and preceding [[3]].\n\n==In mathematics==\nAn [[integer]] is called ''[[Parity (mathematics)|even]]'' if it is divisible by 2. For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number, such as [[decimal]], [[hexadecimal]], or in any other base that is even, divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit. If it is even, then the whole number is even. In particular, when written in the decimal system, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or&nbsp;8.\n\nTwo is the smallest [[prime number]], and the only even prime number (for this reason it is sometimes called \"the oddest prime\").<ref>John Horton Conway & Richard K. Guy, ''The Book of Numbers''.

This binary number system is used extensively in [[Computer|computing]].\n\nFor any number ''x'':\n:''x'' + ''x'' = 2 · ''x'' [[addition]] to [[multiplication]]\n:''x'' · ''x'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup> [[multiplication]] to [[exponentiation]]\n:''x''<sup>''x''</sup> = ''x''↑↑2 [[exponentiation]] to [[tetration]]\n\nExtending this sequence of operations by introducing the notion of [[hyperoperation]]s, here denoted by \"hyper(''a'',''b'',''c'')\" with ''a'' and ''c'' being the first and second operand, and ''b'' being the ''level'' in the above sketched sequence of operations, the following holds in general:\n:hyper(''x'',''n'',''x'') = hyper(''x'',(''n'' + 1),2).\n\nTwo has therefore the unique property that {{nowrap|1=2 + 2 = 2 · 2 = 2{{sup|2}} = 2↑↑2 = 2↑↑↑2 = ...}}, disregarding the level of the hyperoperation, here denoted by [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]. The number of up-arrows refers to the level of the hyperoperation.\n\nTwo is the only number ''x'' such that the sum of the reciprocals of the powers of ''x'' equals itself.

Two is the first Mersenne prime exponent.\n\nTaking the [[square root]] of a number is such a common mathematical operation, that the spot on the root sign where the exponent would normally be written for cubic and other roots, may simply be left blank for square roots, as it is tacitly understood.\n\nThe [[square root of 2]] was the first known [[irrational number]].\n\nThe smallest [[field (mathematics)|field]] has two elements.\n\nIn a [[set theory|set-theoretical]] construction of the natural numbers, 2 is identified with the set <nowiki>{{∅},∅}</nowiki>.

The modern [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] languages still use this method. The [[Gupta script]] rotated the two lines 45&nbsp;degrees, making them diagonal. The top line was sometimes also shortened and had its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. In the [[Devanagari|Nagari]] script, the top line was written more like a curve connecting to the bottom line. In the Arabic [[Ghubār numerals|Ghubar]] writing, the bottom line was completely vertical, and the glyph looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern glyph.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl.

Later on, the [[Ten Commandments]] were given in the form of two tablets. The number also has ceremonial importance, such as the two candles that are traditionally kindled to usher in the [[Shabbat]], recalling the two different ways Shabbat is referred to in the two times the [[Ten Commandments]] are recorded in the [[Torah]]. These two expressions are known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as {{lang|he|שמור וזכור}} (\"guard\" and \"remember\"), as in \"Guard the Shabbat day to sanctify it\" ([[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 5:12) and \"Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it\" ([[Book of Exodus|Ex.]] 20:8). Two [[challah|challot]] (''lechem mishneh'') are placed on the table for each [[Shabbat]] meal and a blessing made over them, to commemorate the double portion of [[manna]] which fell in the [[The Exodus|desert]] every Friday to cover that day's meals and the Shabbat meals.\n\nIn [[Halakha|Jewish law]], the testimonies of two witnesses are required to verify and validate events, such as [[Jewish view of marriage|marriage]], divorce, and a crime that warrants [[capital punishment]].\n\n\"Second-Day Yom Tov\" (''Yom Tov Sheini Shebegaliyot'') is a rabbinical enactment that mandates a two-day celebration for each of the one-day [[Jewish holiday|Jewish festivals]] (i.e., the first and seventh day of [[Passover]], the day of [[Shavuot]], the first day of [[Sukkot]], and the day of [[Shemini Atzeret]]) outside the [[Land of Israel]].\n\n==Numerological significance==\n[[Image:2 playing cards.jpg|thumb|250px|The twos of all four suits in [[playing card]]s]]\nThe most common philosophical [[dichotomy]] is perhaps the one of [[Goodness and value theory|good]] and [[evil]], but there are many others. See [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] for an overview. In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]ian [[dialectic]], the process of [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] reconciles two different perspectives into one.\n \nThe ancient Sanskrit language of India, does not only have a [[singular number|singular]] and [[plural]] form for [[noun]]s, as do many other languages, but instead has, a singular (1) form, a [[Dual (number)|dual]] (2) form, and a plural (everything above 2) form, for all nouns, due to the significance of 2. It is viewed as important because of the anatomical significance of 2 (2 hands, 2 nostrils, 2 [[eyes]], 2 legs, etc.)\n\nTwo ({{lang|zh|二}}, ''èr'') is a good [[number in Chinese culture]]. There is a Chinese saying, \"good things come in pairs\". It is common to use double symbols in product brand names, e.g. double happiness, double coin, double elephants etc. [[Guangdong|Cantonese]] people like the number two because it sounds the same as the word \"easy\" ({{lang|zh|易}}) in [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]].\n\nIn [[Finland]], two [[candle]]s are lit on [[Independence Day (Finland)|Independence Day]] and put on a windowsill, to remind passersby of the sacrifices of past generations in the struggle for independence and democracy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1543054640?accountid=14757 |title=Candles light nation's way: MESSAGE |last=UUSI-VIDENOJA |first=Hannu |date=6 December 1994 |work=South China Morning Post |access-date=9 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn pre-1972 [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] orthography, ''2'' was shorthand for the [[reduplication]] that forms plurals: ''orang'' \"person\", ''orang-orang'' or ''orang2'' \"people\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn [[Astrology]], [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] is the second [[astrological sign|sign]] of the [[Zodiac]].\n\n==In sports==\n*In [[baseball]] scorekeeping, 2 is the position of the catcher.\n* In [[basketball]]:\n** A standard basket, known in the rules as a \"field goal\", is worth 2 points.\n** In the [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]] variant, successful shots from behind the \"three-point\" arc are instead worth 2 points (all other successful shots are worth 1 point).\n** In play diagrams, \"2\" typically denotes the [[shooting guard]].\n* In [[ice hockey]]:\n** A team typically has two [[Defenceman|defencemen]] on the ice at any given time.\n** Minor [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] last for 2 minutes or until the non-penalized team scores a goal, whichever comes first.\n* In most [[rugby league]] competitions (though not the [[Super League]], which uses static squad numbering), the starting right wing wears number 2.\n* In [[rugby union]] and [[rugby sevens|its sevens variant]], the starting hooker wears number 2.\n* In [[association football]], a player scoring two goals in one match is said to have recorded a brace.\n\n==In film==\n*''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003), starring [[Paul Walker]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Cole Hauser]], and [[Ludacris]].\n*''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'' (2005), starring [[Al Pacino]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Armand Assante]], and [[Carly Pope]].\n*''[[Two Lovers (2008 film)|Two Lovers]]'' (2008), starring [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], and [[Vinessa Shaw]]. \n\n==In other fields==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = ICS Pennant Two.svg\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Pennant (commissioning)|International maritime pennant]] for 2\n| image2 = ICS Two.svg\n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[International maritime signal flag]] for 2\n| footer = \n}}\n* [[AD 2]], the second year of the [[Common Era]]\n* Groups of two:\n** [[Lists of pairs]]\n** [[List of twins]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[Square (algebra)]]&nbsp;– (2 [[superscript]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201161638/http://numdic.com/2 The Number 2]\n*[http://www.positiveintegers.org/2 The Positive Integer 2]\n*[http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php/2.html Prime curiosities: 2]\n\n{{Wiktionary|two|both}}\n{{Commons and category|2|2 (number)}}\n\n{{Integers|zero}}\n \n{{Number systems|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2 (Number)}}\n[[Category:2 (number)]]\n[[Category:Integers]]"

It is the [[natural number]] following [[2]] and preceding [[4]].\n\n==Evolution of the glyph==\nThe use of three lines to denote the number 3 is only natural{{clarify |date=May 2019 |reason=?source?}} and occurred in many writing systems, including some (like Roman and [[Chinese numerals]]) that are still in use.  \n\nIn particular, that was also the original representation of 3 in the [[Brahmin]] Indians' numerical notation. However, during the [[Gupta Empire]] the sign was modified by the addition of a curve on each line. The [[Nagari]] rotated the lines clockwise{{clarify |date=May 2019 |reason=since didn't state whether lines were originally vertical or horizontal, I'm not sure the detail about rotation makes sense}}, ended each line with a short downward stroke on the right. In cursive, script the three strokes were eventually connected to form a glyph resembling \"3\" with an additional stroke at the bottom as \"'''३'''\". \n\nThe Hindu{{clarify |date=May 2019 |reason=so far we have said \"Brahmin\" \"Nagari\" and \"Indian\"}} numerals spread to the [[Caliphate]] in the 9th century.  The bottom stroke was dropped around the 10th century in the western parts of the Caliphate, such as the [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]], when a distinct variant (\"Western Arabic\") of the digit symbols developed, including modern Western 3.  In contrast, the Eastern Arabs retained and enlarged that stroke, rotating the character once more to yield the modern (\"Eastern\") [[Arabic script|Arabic]] digit \"'''٣'''\".<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl. David Bellos et al. London: The Harvill Press (1998): 393, Fig. 24.63</ref>\n\nIn most modern Western [[typeface]]s, the \"3\" glyph, like the other [[decimal digit]]s, has the height of a [[capital letter]], and sits on the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]].  In typefaces with [[text figures]], on the other hand, the glyph usually has the height of a [[lowercase letter]] \"x\" and a [[descender]]: \"[[File:Text figures 036.svg|30px]]\". In some [[French language|French]] text-figure typefaces, though, it has an [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] instead of a descender.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Flat-topped 3===\nA common variant of the digit three has a flat top, similar to the character Ʒ ([[ezh]]). This form is sometimes used to prevent people from fraudulently changing a three into an eight. It is usually found on [[Universal Product Code|UPC-A]] barcodes and [[standard 52-card deck]]s.\n\n==Mathematics==\n'''3''' is:\n*a rough approximation of [[pi|{{pi}}]] (3.1415...) and a very rough approximation of [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']] (2.71828..) when doing quick estimates.\n*the number of non-collinear points needed to determine a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] and a [[circle]].\n*the first odd [[prime number]] and the second smallest prime.\n*the first [[Fermat prime]] ({{nowrap|2{{sup|2{{sup|''n''}}}} + 1}}).\n*the first [[Mersenne prime]] ({{nowrap|2{{sup|''n''}} − 1}}).\n*the second [[Sophie Germain prime]].\n*the second Mersenne prime exponent.\n*the second [[factorial prime]] ({{nowrap|2! + 1}}).\n*the second [[Lucas prime]].\n*the second [[triangular number]]. It is the only prime triangular number.\n*the fourth [[Fibonacci number]].\n*the smallest number of sides that a simple (non-self-intersecting) [[polygon]] can have.\n\nThree is the only prime which is one less than a [[square number|perfect square]]. Any other number which is {{nowrap|''n''{{sup|2}} − 1}} for some integer ''n'' is not prime, since it is {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)(''n'' + 1)}}. This is true for 3 as well (with {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}), but in this case the smaller factor is 1. If ''n'' is greater than 2, both {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} and {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} are greater than 1 so their product is not prime.\n\nA [[natural number]] is [[divisible]] by three if the [[digital root|sum of its digits]] in [[base 10]] is divisible by 3. For example, the number 21 is divisible by three (3 times 7) and the sum of its digits is 2 + 1 = 3. Because of this, the reverse of any number that is divisible by three (or indeed, any [[permutation]] of its digits) is also divisible by three. For instance, 1368 and its reverse 8631 are both divisible by three (and so are 1386, 3168, 3186, 3618, etc.). See also [[Divisibility rule]]. This works in [[base 10]] and in any [[positional notation|positional numeral system]] whose [[radix|base]] divided by three leaves a remainder of one (bases 4, 7, 10, etc.).\n\nThree of the five [[Platonic solids]] have triangular faces – the [[tetrahedron]], the [[octahedron]], and the [[icosahedron]]. Also, three of the five Platonic solids have [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] where three faces meet&nbsp;– the [[tetrahedron]], the [[hexahedron]] ([[cube]]), and the [[dodecahedron]]. Furthermore, only three different types of [[polygons]] comprise the faces of the five Platonic solids&nbsp;– the [[triangle]], the [[square]], and the [[pentagon]].\n\nThere are only three distinct 4×4 [[panmagic square]]s.\n\nAccording to [[Pythagoras]] and the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] school, the number 3, which they called ''triad'', is the noblest of all digits, as it is the only number to equal the sum of all the terms below it, and the only number whose sum with those below equals the product of them and itself.<ref>{{citation |author=Priya Hemenway |title=Divine Proportion: Phi In Art, Nature, and Science |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company Inc. |year=2005 |isbn=1-4027-3522-7 |pages=53–54}}</ref>\n\nThe [[trisection of the angle]] was one of the three famous problems of antiquity.\n\n[[Gauss]] proved that every integer is the sum of at most 3 [[triangular numbers]].\n\n===Numeral systems===\nThere is some evidence to suggest that early man may have used counting systems which consisted of \"One, Two, Three\" and thereafter \"Many\" to describe counting limits. Early peoples had a word to describe the quantities of one, two, and three but any quantity beyond was simply denoted as \"Many\". This is most likely based on the prevalence of this phenomenon among people in such disparate regions as the deep Amazon and Borneo jungles, where western civilization's explorers have historical records of their first encounters with these indigenous people.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Gribbin | first1 = Mary  | last2 = Gribbin | first2 = John R. | last3 = Edney | first3 = Ralph | last4 = Halliday | first4 = Nicholas | title = Big numbers | publisher = Wizard | location = Cambridge | year = 2003 | isbn = 1840464313 }}</ref>\n\n===List of basic calculations===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n!width=\"105px\"|[[Multiplication]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n!21\n!22\n!23\n!24\n!25\n!50\n!100\n!1000\n!10000\n|-\n|'''3 × ''x'''''\n|'''3'''\n|[[6 (number)|6]]\n|[[9 (number)|9]]\n|[[12 (number)|12]]\n|[[15 (number)|15]]\n|[[18 (number)|18]]\n|[[21 (number)|21]]\n|[[24 (number)|24]]\n|[[27 (number)|27]]\n|[[30 (number)|30]]\n|[[33 (number)|33]]\n|[[36 (number)|36]]\n|[[39 (number)|39]]\n|[[42 (number)|42]]\n|[[45 (number)|45]]\n|[[48 (number)|48]]\n|[[51 (number)|51]]\n|[[54 (number)|54]]\n|[[57 (number)|57]]\n|[[60 (number)|60]]\n|[[63 (number)|63]]\n|[[66 (number)|66]]\n|[[69 (number)|69]]\n|[[72 (number)|72]]\n|[[75 (number)|75]]\n|[[150 (number)|150]]\n|[[300 (number)|300]]\n|[[3000 (number)|3000]]\n|[[30000 (number)|30000]]\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n!width=\"105px\"|[[Division (mathematics)|Division]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n|-\n|'''3 ÷ ''x'''''\n|'''3'''\n|[[1 (number)|1]].[[5 (number)|5]]\n|1\n|[[0 (number)|0]].75\n|0.6\n|0.5\n|0.{{overline|428571}}\n|0.[[375 (number)|375]]\n|0.{{overline|3}}\n|0.3\n!\n|0.{{overline|27}}\n|0.[[25 (number)|25]]\n|0.{{overline|230769}}\n|0.2{{overline|142857}}\n|0.2\n|0.1875\n|0.1{{overline|7647058823529411}}\n|0.1{{overline|6}}\n|0.1{{overline|57894736842105263}}\n|0.15\n|-\n|'''''x'' ÷ 3'''\n|0.{{overline|3}}\n|0.{{overline|6}}\n|1\n|1.{{overline|3}}\n|1.{{overline|6}}\n|2\n|2.{{overline|3}}\n|2.{{overline|6}}\n|'''3'''\n|3.{{overline|3}}\n!\n|3.{{overline|6}}\n|4\n|4.{{overline|3}}\n|4.{{overline|6}}\n|5\n|5.{{overline|3}}\n|5.{{overline|6}}\n|6\n|6.{{overline|3}}\n|6.{{overline|6}}\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n!width=\"105px\"|[[Exponentiation]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n|-\n|'''3{{sup|''x''}}'''\n|'''3'''\n|9\n|27\n|[[81 (number)|81]]\n|[[243 (number)|243]]\n|729\n|2187\n|6561\n|19683\n|59049\n!\n|177147\n|531441\n|1594323\n|4782969\n|14348907\n|43046721\n|129140163\n|387420489\n|1162261467\n|3486784401\n|-\n|'''''x''{{sup|3}}'''\n|1\n|[[8 (number)|8]]\n|[[27 (number)|27]]\n|[[64 (number)|64]]\n|[[125 (number)|125]]\n|[[216 (number)|216]]\n|[[343 (number)|343]]\n|[[512 (number)|512]]\n|729\n|[[1000 (number)|1000]]\n!\n|1331\n|1728\n|2197\n|2744\n|3375\n|4096\n|4913\n|5832\n|6859\n|8000\n|}\n\n==Science==\n*The Roman numeral III stands for [[giant star]] in the [[stellar classification|Yerkes spectral classification scheme]].\n*Three is the [[atomic number]] of [[lithium]].\n*Three is the [[ASCII]] code of \"[[End-of-text character|End of Text]]\".\n*Three is the number of [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] that humans can perceive.

Assuming the counter is proceeding at a uniform rate, the first two counts are necessary to establish the rate, and the count of \"three\" is predicted based on the timing of the \"one\" and \"two\" before it. Three is likely used instead of some other number because it requires the minimal amount counts while setting a rate.\n\nThere is another superstition that it is unlucky to take a [[Three on a match (superstition)|third light]], that is, to be the third person to light a cigarette from the same match or lighter. This superstition is sometimes asserted to have originated among soldiers in the trenches of the First World War when a sniper might see the first light, take aim on the second and fire on the third.\n\nThe phrase \"[[:wikt:Third time's the charm|Third time's the charm]]\" refers to the superstition that after two failures in any endeavor, a third attempt is more likely to succeed. This is also sometimes seen in reverse, as in \"third man [to do something, presumably forbidden] gets caught\".\n\n[[Luck]], especially bad luck, is often said to \"come in threes\".<ref>See \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O214-bad.html bad]\" in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 2006, via Encyclopedia.com.</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n* In [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], a [[field goal]] is worth three points.\n*In [[association football]]:\n** For purposes of league standings, since the mid-1990s almost all leagues have awarded [[three points for a win]].\n** A team that wins three trophies in a season is said to have won a [[Treble (association football)|treble]].\n** A player who scores three goals in a match is said to have scored a [[hat-trick]].\n* In [[baseball]]:\n** A batter [[Strikeout|strikes out]] upon the third [[Strike zone|strike]] in any single batting appearance.\n** Each team's half of an inning ends once the defense has recorded three outs (unless the home team has a [[Walk-off home run|walk-off hit]] in the ninth inning or any extra inning).\n** In scorekeeping, \"3\" denotes the first baseman.\n*In [[basketball]]:\n** [[Three-point field goal|Three points]] are awarded for a basket made from behind a designated arc on the floor.\n** The \"3 position\" is the [[small forward]].\n*In [[bowling]], three [[strike (bowling)|strikes]] bowled consecutively is known as a \"turkey\".\n* In [[cricket]], a bowler who is credited with dismissals of batsmen on three consecutive deliveries has achieved a \"hat-trick\".\n*In [[Gaelic games]] (Gaelic football for [[Gaelic football|men]] and [[Ladies' Gaelic football|women]], [[hurling]], and [[camogie]]), three points are awarded for a goal, scored when the ball passes underneath the crossbar and between the goal posts.\n*In [[ice hockey]]:\n** Scoring three goals is called a \"hat trick\" (usually not hyphenated in North America).\n** A team will typically have three [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] on the ice at any given time.\n* In [[professional wrestling]], a [[pin (professional wrestling)|pin]] is when one holds the opponent's shoulders against the mat for a count of three.\n* In [[rugby union]]:\n** A successful [[Penalty (rugby union)|penalty kick for goal]] or [[drop goal]] is worth three points.\n** In the [[National Rugby League (France)|French variation]] of the [[Rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]], a team receives a bonus point in the league standings if it wins a match while scoring at least three more tries than its opponent.\n** The starting [[Rugby union positions|tighthead prop]] wears the jersey number 3.\n* In [[rugby league]]:\n** One of the two starting centres wears the jersey number 3.

It is the [[natural number]] following [[3]] and preceding [[5]]\n\n==In mathematics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nFour is the smallest [[composite number]], its proper [[divisor]]s being {{num|1}} and {{num|2}}.\n\n4 is the smallest squared prime (''p''<sup>2</sup>) and the only even number in this form.  4 is also the only square one more than a prime number.\n\nA number is a multiple of 4 if its last two digits are a multiple of 4. For example, 1092 is a multiple of 4 because {{nowrap|1=92 = 4 × 23}}.\n\nIn addition, 2 + 2 = 2 × 2 = 2<sup>2</sup> = 4. Continuing the pattern in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]], {{nowrap|1=2 ↑↑ 2 = 2 ↑↑↑ 2 = 4}}, and so on, for any number of up arrows. (That is, {{nowrap|1=2 [''n''] 2 = 4}} for every positive integer ''n'', where {{nowrap|''a'' [''n''] ''b''}} is the [[hyperoperation]].)\n\nA four-sided plane figure is a [[quadrilateral]] (quadrangle) which include kites, rhombi, rectangles and squares, sometimes also called a ''tetragon''. A [[circle]] divided by 4 makes [[right angle]]s and four quadrants. Because of it, four (4) is the base number of the [[plane (mathematics)]]. Four [[cardinal directions]], [[Season|four seasons]], the [[duodecimal]] system, and the [[vigesimal]] system are based on four.\n\nA solid figure with four faces as well as four vertices is a [[tetrahedron]], and 4 is the smallest possible number of faces (as well as vertices) of a [[polyhedron]]. The regular tetrahedron is the simplest [[Platonic solid]]. A [[tetrahedron]], which can also be called a 3-[[simplex]], has four triangular faces and four vertices. It is the only self-dual [[regular polyhedron]].\n\n[[Four-dimensional space|Four-dimensional]] space is the highest-dimensional space featuring more than three convex regular figures:\n*Two-dimensional: infinitely many convex [[regular polygon]]s.\n*Three-dimensional: five convex [[Regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] (the five [[Platonic solid]]s).\n*Four-dimensional: six [[Convex regular 4-polytope|convex regular polychora]].\n*Five-dimensional and every higher-dimensional: three regular convex [[polytope]]s ([[simplex|regular simplexes]], [[hypercube]]s, [[cross-polytope]]s).\n\nFour-dimensional [[differential manifold]]s have some unique properties. There is only one [[differential structure]] on ℝ{{sup|''n''}} except when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, in which case there are uncountably many.\n\nThe smallest non-[[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[group (mathematics)|group]] has four elements; it is the [[Klein four-group]]. Four is also the order of the smallest non-trivial groups that are not [[simple group|simple]].\n\nFour is the only integer ''n'' for which the (non trivial) [[alternating group]] ''A{{sub|n}}'' is not simple.\n\nFour is the maximum number of dimensions of a real [[associative algebra|associative]] [[division algebra]] (the [[quaternions]]), by a [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|theorem]] of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]].\n\nThe [[four-color theorem]] states that a [[planar graph]] (or, equivalently, a flat [[map]] of two-dimensional regions such as countries) can be colored using four colors, so that adjacent vertices (or regions) are always different colors.<ref>Bryan Bunch, ''The Kingdom of Infinite Number''. New York: W. H. Freeman & Company (2000): 48</ref> Three colors are not, in general, sufficient to guarantee this. The largest planar [[complete graph]] has four vertices.\n\n[[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four [[square number]]s. Three are not always sufficient; {{num|7}} for instance cannot be written as the sum of three squares.\n\nEach natural number divisible by 4 is a difference of squares of two natural numbers, i.e. {{nowrap|1=4''x'' = ''y''<sup>2</sup> − ''z''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nFour is the highest degree general [[polynomial equation]] for which there is a [[solution in radicals]].\n\nThe [[four fours]] game, there are known solutions for all integers from 0 to 880 (but not 881).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==List of basic calculations==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n!width=\"105px\"|[[Multiplication]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!21\n!22\n!23\n!24\n!25\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!50\n!100\n!1000\n|-\n|'''4 × ''x'''''\n|'''4'''\n|{{num|8}}\n|{{num|12}}\n|{{num|16}}\n|{{num|20}}\n|{{num|24}}\n|{{num|28}}\n|{{num|32}}\n|{{num|36}}\n|{{num|40}}\n!\n|{{num|44}}\n|{{num|48}}\n|{{num|52}}\n|{{num|56}}\n|{{num|60}}\n|{{num|64}}\n|{{num|68}}\n|{{num|72}}\n|{{num|76}}\n|{{num|80}}\n!\n|{{num|84}}\n|{{num|88}}\n|{{num|92}}\n|{{num|96}}\n|{{num|100}}\n!\n|{{num|200}}\n|{{num|400}}\n|{{num|4000}}\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n!width=\"105px\"|[[Division (mathematics)|Division]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n|-\n|'''4 ÷ ''x'''''\n|'''4'''\n|2\n|1.{{overline|3}}\n|1\n|0.8\n|0.{{overline|6}}\n|0.{{overline|571428}}\n|0.5\n|0.{{overline|4}}\n|0.4\n!\n|0.{{overline|36}}\n|0.{{overline|3}}\n|0.{{overline|307692}}\n|0.{{overline|285714}}\n|0.2{{overline|6}}\n|0.25\n|-\n|'''''x'' ÷ 4'''\n|0.25\n|0.5\n|0.75\n|1\n|1.25\n|1.5\n|1.75\n|2\n|2.25\n|2.5\n!\n|2.75\n|3\n|3.25\n|3.5\n|3.75\n|4\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n!width=\"105px\"|[[Exponentiation]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n!width=\"5px\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n|-\n|'''4{{sup|''x''}}'''\n|4\n|16\n|64\n|256\n|1024\n|4096\n|16384\n|65536\n|262144\n|1048576\n!\n|4194304\n|16777216\n|67108864\n|-\n|'''''x''{{sup|4}}'''\n|1\n|16\n|81\n|256\n|625\n|1296\n|2401\n|4096\n|6561\n|10000\n!\n|14641\n|20736\n|28561\n|}\n\n==Evolution of the glyph==\n[[File:Evolution4glyph.png|x50px|right]]\n[[File:Vier.jpg|thumb|right|Two modern handwritten fours]]\nRepresenting 1, 2 and 3 in as many lines as the number represented worked well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The [[Brahmin]] Indians simplified 4 by joining its four lines into a cross that looks like the modern plus sign. The [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] would add a horizontal line on top of the numeral, and the Kshatrapa and Pallava evolved the numeral to a point where the speed of writing was a secondary concern. The [[Arab]]s' 4 still had the early concept of the cross, but for the sake of efficiency, was made in one stroke by connecting the \"western\" end to the \"northern\" end; the \"eastern\" end was finished off with a curve.

Boyd held that his decision cycle has philosophical generality, though for strategists the point remains that, through swift decisions, one can disrupt an opponent's decision cycle.\n*[[Richard McKeon]] outlined four classes (each with four subclasses) of modes of philosophical inquiry: (1) Modes of Being (Being); (2) Modes of Thought (That which is); (3) Modes of Fact (Existence); (4) Modes of Simplicity (Experience)—and, corresponding to them, four classes (each with four subclasses) of philosophical semantics: Principles, Methods, Interpretations, and Selections.

It is the [[natural number]] following [[4]] and preceding [[6]].\n\n== In mathematics ==\nFive is the third [[prime number]]. Because it can be written as {{nowrap|2{{sup|2{{sup|1}}}} + 1}}, five is classified as a [[Fermat number|Fermat prime]]; therefore a [[regular polygon]] with 5&nbsp;sides (a regular [[pentagon]]) is [[constructible polygon|constructible]] with compass and unmarked straightedge. Five is the third [[Sophie Germain prime]], the first [[safe prime]], the third [[Catalan number]], and the third [[Mersenne prime]] exponent. Five is the first [[Wilson prime]] and the third [[factorial prime]], also an [[alternating factorial]]. Five is the first [[good prime]].<ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A028388 |2=Good primes|accessdate=2016-06-01}}</ref> It is an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no imaginary part and real part of the form {{nowrap|3''n'' − 1}}. It is also the only number that is part of more than one pair of [[twin prime]]s. Five is a [[congruent number]].<ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A003273 |2=Congruent numbers|accessdate=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nFive is conjectured to be the only odd [[untouchable number]] and if this is the case then five will be the only odd prime number that is not the base of an aliquot tree.\n\nFive is also the only prime that is the sum of two consecutive primes, namely 2 and 3.\n\nThe number 5 is the fifth [[Fibonacci number]], being {{num|2}} plus {{num|3}}. It is the only Fibonacci number that is equal to its position. 5 is also a [[Pell number]] and a [[Markov number]], appearing in solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation: (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 13), (2, 5, 29), (5, 13, 194), (5, 29, 433), ... ({{OEIS2C|id=A030452}} lists Markov numbers that appear in solutions where one of the other two terms is 5). Whereas 5 is unique in the Fibonacci sequence, in the Perrin sequence 5 is both the fifth and sixth [[Perrin number]]s.\n\n5 is the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the smallest [[Pythagorean triple|integer-sided right triangle]].\n\nIn bases 10 and 20, 5 is a 1-[[automorphic number]].\n\nFive is the second [[Sierpinski number]] of the first kind, and can be written as S2 = (2<sup>2</sup>) + 1.\n\nWhile [[polynomial]] equations of degree {{num|4}} and below can be solved with radicals, equations of degree 5 and higher cannot generally be so solved. This is the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]. This is related to the fact that the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> is a [[solvable group]] for {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 4}} and not solvable for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}.\n\nWhile all [[graph theory|graphs]] with 4 or fewer vertices are [[planar graph|planar]], there exists a graph with 5 vertices which is not planar: ''K''<sub>5</sub>, the [[complete graph]] with 5 vertices.\n\nThere are five [[Platonic solid]]s.<ref>Bryan Bunch, ''The Kingdom of Infinite Number''. New York: W. H. Freeman & Company (2000): 61</ref>\n\nA [[polygon]] with five sides is a [[pentagon]]. [[Figurate number]]s representing pentagons (including five) are called [[pentagonal number]]s. Five is also a [[square pyramidal number]].\n\nFive is the only prime number to end in the digit 5 because all other numbers written with a 5 in the ones place under the decimal system are multiples of five. As a consequence of this, 5 is in base&nbsp;10 a 1-[[automorphic number]].\n\n[[fraction (mathematics)#Vulgar, proper, and improper fractions|Vulgar fractions]] with 5 or {{num|2}} in the [[fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] do not yield infinite [[decimal]] expansions, unlike expansions with all other prime denominators, because they are prime factors of [[10 (number)|ten]], the base. When written in the decimal system, all multiples of 5 will end in either 5 or {{num|0}}.\n\nThere are five [[Simple Lie group#Exceptional cases|Exceptional Lie groups]].\n\n=== List of basic calculations ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: \"white\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\"|[[Multiplication]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n!16\n!17\n!18\n!19\n!20\n|-\n|'''5 × ''x'''''\n|'''5'''\n|[[10 (number)|10]]\n|[[15 (number)|15]]\n|[[20 (number)|20]]\n|[[25 (number)|25]]\n|[[30 (number)|30]]\n|[[35 (number)|35]]\n|[[40 (number)|40]]\n|[[45 (number)|45]]\n|[[50 (number)|50]]\n!\n|[[55 (number)|55]]\n|[[60 (number)|60]]\n|[[65 (number)|65]]\n|[[70 (number)|70]]\n|[[75 (number)|75]]\n|[[80 (number)|80]]\n|[[85 (number)|85]]\n|[[90 (number)|90]]\n|[[95 (number)|95]]\n|[[100 (number)|100]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\"|[[Division (mathematics)|Division]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n|-\n|'''5 ÷ ''x'''''\n|'''5'''\n|2.5\n|1.{{overline|6}}\n|1.25\n|1\n|0.8{{overline|3}}\n|0.{{overline|714285}}\n|0.625\n|0.{{overline|5}}\n|0.5\n!\n|0.{{overline|45}}\n|0.41{{overline|6}}\n|0.{{overline|384615}}\n|0.3{{overline|571428}}\n|0.{{overline|3}}\n|-\n|'''''x'' ÷ 5'''\n|0.2\n|0.4\n|0.6\n|0.8\n|1\n|1.2\n|1.4\n|1.6\n|1.8\n|2\n!\n|2.2\n|2.4\n|2.6\n|2.8\n|3\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; background: white\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\"|[[Exponentiation]]\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n! style=\"width:5px;\"|\n!11\n!12\n!13\n!14\n!15\n|-\n|'''5{{sup|''x''}}'''\n|'''5'''\n|25\n|125\n|625\n|3125\n|15625\n|78125\n|390625\n|1953125\n|9765625\n!\n|48828125\n|244140625\n|1220703125\n|6103515625\n|30517578125\n|-\n|'''''x''{{sup|5}}'''\n|1\n|32\n|243\n|1024\n|3125\n|7776\n|16807\n|32768\n|59049\n|100000\n!\n|161051\n|248832\n|371293\n|537824\n|759375\n|}\n\nIn the powers of 5, every power ends with the number five and from 5<sup>3</sup>, if the exponent is odd, then the hundreds digit is 1; instead, if it is even, the hundreds digit is 6.\n\nIn fifth powers, {{var|n}}{{sup|5}} ends in the same digit as {{var|n}}.\n\n== Evolution of the glyph ==\n[[File:Evolution5glyph.png|x50px|right]]\nThe evolution of the modern Western [[glyph]] for the numeral 5 cannot be traced back to the Indian system as for the numbers 1 to 4. The [[Kushan Empire|Kushana]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empires in what is now [[India]] had among themselves several different glyphs which bear no resemblance to the modern glyph. The [[Devanagari|Nagari]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] took these glyphs and all came up with glyphs that are similar to a lowercase \"h\" rotated 180°. The Ghubar Arabs transformed the glyph in several different ways, producing glyphs that were more similar to the numbers 4 or 3 than to the number 5.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl. David Bellos et al. London: The [[Harvill Press]] (1998): 394, Fig. 24.65</ref> It was from those characters that Europeans finally came up with the modern 5.\n\nWhile the shape of the 5 character has an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] in most modern [[typeface]]s, in typefaces with [[text figures]] the character usually has a [[descender]], as, for example, in [[File:Text figures 256.svg]].\n\n== Science ==\n*The [[atomic number]] of [[boron]].\n*The number of appendages on most [[sea star|starfish]], which exhibit [[symmetry (biology)#Pentamerism|pentamerism]].\n*The most destructive known [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] rate as [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale#Category 5|Category 5]] on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]].\n*The most destructive known [[tornado]]es rate an F-5 on the [[Fujita scale]] or EF-5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]].\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n*[[Messier object]] [[Messier 5|M5]], a magnitude 7.0 [[globular cluster]] in the constellation [[Serpens]].\n*The [[New General Catalogue]] [http://www.ngcic.org/ object] [[NGC 5]], a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 13 [[spiral galaxy]] in the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]].\n*The Roman numeral V stands for dwarfs ([[main sequence]] stars) in the [[stellar classification|Yerkes spectral classification scheme]].\n*The Roman numeral V (usually) stands for the fifth-discovered satellite of a planet or minor planet (e.g. [[Amalthea (moon)|Jupiter V]]).\n*There are five [[Lagrangian point]]s in a two-body system.\n\n=== Biology ===\n*Perception is conceived to occur through [[five senses]].\n*Almost all amphibians, reptiles, and mammals which have fingers or toes have five of them on each extremity.<ref>{{citation |title=Vertebrates: Structures and Functions |series=Biological Systems in Vertebrates |first=S.

This is demonstrated in the [[Discordianism#Law of Fives|Law of Fives]], as well as in the [[Discordianism#Pentabarf|Pentabarf]], which contains five rules.\n*Each page of the [[Principia Discordia]]—the primary religious document in Discordianism—is labeled with five digits.\n\n=== Islam ===\n*The [[Five Pillars of Islam]]\n*[[Muslim]]s pray to [[Allah]] five times a day\n*According to Shia Muslims, the [[Panjetan-e-Pak|Panjetan]] or the Five Holy Purified Ones are the members of [[Muhammad]]'s family: [[Muhammad]], [[Ali]], [[Fatimah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] and is often symbolically represented by an image of the Khamsa.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n*The [[Torah]] contains five books—[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]—which are collectively called the Five Books of [[Moses]], the Pentateuch ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"five containers\", referring to the scroll cases in which the books were kept), or [[Chumash (Judaism)|Humash]] ({{lang|he|חומש}}, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for \"fifth\").\n*The book of [[Psalms]] is arranged into five books, paralleling the [[Five Books of Moses]].\n*The [[Hamsa|Khamsa]], an ancient symbol shaped like a hand with four fingers and one thumb, is used as a protective amulet by [[Jew]]s; that same symbol is also very popular in [[Arab]]ic culture, known to protect from envy and the [[evil eye]].\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n*The five sacred [[Sikh]] symbols prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh are commonly known as ''panj kakars'' or the \"Five Ks\" because they start with letter K representing ''kakka'' ({{lang|pa|ਕ}}) in the [[Punjabi language]]'s [[Gurmukhi script]]. They are: ''kesh'' (unshorn hair), ''kangha'' (the comb), ''kara'' (the steel bracelet), ''kachhehra'' (the soldiers shorts), and ''kirpan'' (the sword) (in Gurmukhi: {{lang|pa|ਕੇਸ, ਕੰਘਾ, ਕੜਾ, ਕਛਹਰਾ, ਕਿਰਪਾਨ}}). Also, there are five deadly evils: ''kam'' (lust), ''krodh'' (anger), ''moh'' (attachment), ''lobh'' (greed), and ''[[ankh]]ar'' (ego).\n\n=== [[Tao|Daoism]] ===\n*[[Wu Xing|5 Elements]]\n*[[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|5 Emperors]]\n\n=== Other religions and cultures ===\n*According to ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], the universe is made up of five [[classical element]]s: [[water (classical element)|water]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[aether (classical element)|ether]]. This concept was later adopted by Medieval [[alchemists]] and more recently by practitioners of [[Neo-Pagan]] religions such as [[Wicca]].\n*The [[pentagram]], or five-pointed star, bears religious significance in various faiths including [[Baha'i]], [[Christianity]], [[Freemasonry]], [[Satanism]], [[Taoism]], [[Thelema]], and [[Wicca]].\n*In [[Cantonese]], \"five\" sounds like the word \"not\" (character: {{lang|zh|唔}}). When five appears in front of a lucky number, e.g. \"58\", the result is considered unlucky.\n*In [[East Asia]]n tradition, there are [[Wu Xing|five elements]]: ([[water (Wu Xing)|water]], [[fire (Wu Xing)|fire]], [[earth (Wu Xing)|earth]], [[tree (Wu Xing)|wood]], and [[metal (Wu Xing)|metal]]). The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] names for the [[week-day names|days of the week]], Tuesday through [[Saturday]], come from these elements via the identification of the elements with the [[Classical planet|five planets visible with the naked eye]]. Also, the traditional Japanese calendar has a five-day weekly cycle that can be still observed in printed mixed calendars combining Western, Chinese-Buddhist, and Japanese names for each weekday.\n*Members of [[The Nation of Gods and Earths]], a primarily African American religious organization, call themselves the \"Five-Percenters\" because they believe that only 5% of mankind is truly enlightened.\n\n== Art, entertainment, and media ==\n=== Fictional entities ===\n*[[James the Red Engine]], a fictional character numbered 5.\n*[[Johnny 5]] is the lead character in the film ''Short Circuit'' (1986)\n*Number Five is a character in [[Lorien Legacies]]\n*Sankara Stones, five magical rocks in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' that are sought by the Thuggees for evil purposes\n*The Mach Five ({{nihongo2|マッハ号}} Mahha-gō?), the racing car Speed Racer (Go Mifune in the Japanese version) drives in the anime series of the same name (known as \"Mach Go!

An exception is the [[Super League]], which uses static squad numbering.\n*In [[rugby union]]:\n** A [[try]] is worth 5 points.\n** One of the two starting [[Lock (rugby union)|lock forwards]] wears number 5, and usually jumps at number 4 in the [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]].\n** In the [[National Rugby League (France)|French variation]] of the [[Rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]], a bonus point in the league standings is awarded to a team that loses by 5 or fewer points.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:U+2677 DejaVu Sans.svg|50px|right|5 as a resin identification code, used in recycling.]]\n*5 is the most common number of gears for automobiles with [[manual transmission]].\n*In radio communication, the term \"[[Five by five]]\" is used to indicate perfect signal strength and clarity.\n*On almost all devices with a [[numeric keypad]] such as telephones, computers, etc., the 5 key has a raised dot or raised bar to make dialing easier. Persons who are blind or have low vision find it useful to be able to feel the keys of a telephone. All other numbers can be found with their relative position around the 5 button (on computer keyboards, the 5 key of the [[numeric keypad|numpad]] has the raised dot or bar, but the 5 key that shifts with % does not).\n*On most [[telephone]]s, the 5 key is associated with the letters [[J]], [[K]], and [[L]], but on some of the [[BlackBerry]] phones, it is the key for [[G]] and [[H]].\n*The [[Pentium]], coined by [[Intel Corporation]], is a fifth-generation [[x86]] architecture [[microprocessor]].\n*The [[resin identification code]] used in recycling to identify [[polypropylene]].\n*A [[pentamer]] is an oligomer composed of five subunits.\n\n== Miscellaneous fields ==\n[[File:ICS Pennant Five.svg|100px|right|thumb|[[International maritime signal flags|International maritime signal flag for 5]]]]\n[[File:Symbol SPB-Metro L5.svg|80px|right|St. Petersburg Metro, Line 5]]\n[[File:5 playing cards.jpg|thumb|250px|The fives of all four suits in [[playing card]]s]]\n'''Five''' can refer to:\n*\"Give me five\" is a common phrase used preceding a [[high five]].\n*An informal term for the British Security Service, [[MI5]].\n*Five babies born at one time are [[multiple birth|quintuplets]].

If ''n'' is a natural number that is not 2 or 6, then there is a Graeco-Latin square with order ''n''.\n\nThere is not a prime ''p'' such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo ''p'' is 6, that is, ''ord''<sub>''p''</sub>(2) = 6.  \nBy [[Zsigmondy's theorem]], if ''n'' is a natural number that is not 1 or 6, then there is a prime ''p'' such that ''ord''<sub>''p''</sub>(2) = ''n''. See {{OEIS link|A112927}} for such ''p''.\n\nThe ring of integer of the sixth cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(ζ<sub>6</sub>)}} , which is called [[Eisenstein integer]], has 6 units: ±1, ±ω, ±ω<sup>2</sup>, where <math>\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}(-1 + i\\sqrt 3) = e^{2\\pi i/3}</math>.\n\nThe smallest non-[[abelian group|abelian]] [[group (mathematics)|group]] is the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>3</sub> which has [[factorial|3!]] = 6 elements.\n\n''S''<sub>6</sub>, with 720 elements, is the only finite symmetric group which has an [[outer automorphism]]. This automorphism allows us to construct a number of exceptional mathematical objects such as the S(5,6,12) [[Steiner system]], the [[projective plane]] of order&nbsp;4 and the [[Hoffman-Singleton graph]]. A closely related result is the following theorem: 6 is the only natural number ''n'' for which there is a construction of ''n'' [[isomorphic]] objects on an ''n''-set ''A'', invariant under all permutations of ''A'', but not naturally in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of ''A''. This can also be expressed category theoretically: consider the [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are the ''n'' element sets and whose arrows are the [[bijection]]s between the sets. This category has a non-trivial [[functor]] to itself only for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 6}}.\n\nSix similar coins can be arranged around a central coin of the same radius so that each coin makes contact with the central one (and touches both its neighbors without a gap), but seven cannot be so arranged. This makes 6 the answer to the two-dimensional [[kissing number problem]]. The densest [[sphere packing]] of the plane is obtained by extending this pattern to the [[hexagon]]al [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in which each circle touches just six others.\n\n[[File:120px-Hexahedron-slowturn.gif|frame|left|A [[cube]] has 6 [[Face (geometry)|faces]]]]\n6 is the largest of the four [[Harshad number|all-Harshad number]]s.\n\nA six-sided [[polygon]] is a hexagon, one of the three regular polygons capable of [[tessellation|tiling the plane]].

Gradually, the upper part of the stroke (above the central squiggle) became more curved, while the lower part of the stroke (below the central squiggle) became straighter. The Arabs dropped the part of the stroke below the squiggle. From there, the European evolution to our modern 6 was very straightforward, aside from a flirtation with a glyph that looked more like an uppercase G.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl.

Some historical calculator models use just five segments for the 6, by omitting the top horizontal bar. This glyph variant has not caught on; for calculators that can display results in hexadecimal, a 6 that looks like a \"b\" is not practical.\n\nJust as in most modern [[typeface]]s, in typefaces with [[text figures]] the 6 character usually has an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]], as, for example, in [[File:Text figures 036.svg|52px]].\n\nThis numeral resembles an inverted ''9''.

(See [[Lagrange's four-square theorem#Historical development]].)\n*Seven is the [[aliquot sum]] of one number, the [[cubic number]] {{num|8}} and is the base of the 7-aliquot tree.\n*7 is the only number ''D'' for which the equation {{nowrap|1=2{{sup|''n''}} − ''D'' = ''x''{{sup|2}}}} has more than two solutions for ''n'' and ''x'' natural. In particular, the equation {{nowrap|1=2{{sup|''n''}} − 7 = ''x''{{sup|2}}}} is known as the [[Ramanujan–Nagell equation]].\n*7 is the only dimension, besides the familiar 3, in which a vector [[cross product]] can [[seven-dimensional cross product|be defined]].\n*7 is the lowest [[dimension]] of a known [[exotic sphere]], although there may exist as yet unknown exotic smooth structures on the 4-dimensional sphere.\n*{{num|999,999}} divided by 7 is exactly {{num|142,857}}. Therefore, when a [[vulgar fraction]] with 7 in the [[denominator]] is converted to a [[decimal]] expansion, the result has the same six-[[numerical digit|digit]] repeating sequence after the decimal point, but the sequence can start with any of those six digits.<ref>Bryan Bunch, ''[[The Kingdom of Infinite Number]]''. New York: W. H. Freeman & Company (2000): 82</ref> For example, {{nowrap|1=1/7 = 0.142857 142857...}} and {{nowrap|1=2/7 = 0.285714 285714....}}\n:In fact, if one sorts the digits in the number 142,857 in ascending order, 124578, it is possible to know from which of the digits the decimal part of the number is going to begin with. The remainder of dividing any number by 7 will give the position in the sequence 124578 that the decimal part of the resulting number will start. For example, 628 ÷ 7 = {{sfrac|89|5|7}}; here 5 is the remainder, and would correspond to number 7 in the ranking of the ascending sequence. So in this case, {{nowrap|1=628 ÷ 7 = 89.714285}}. Another example, {{nowrap|1=5238 ÷ 7 = {{sfrac|748|2|7}}}}, hence the remainder is 2, and this corresponds to number 2 in the sequence. In this case, {{nowrap|1=5238 ÷ 7 = 748.285714}}.\n*A seven-sided shape is a [[heptagon]]. The regular ''n''-gons for ''n'' ≤ 6 can be constructed by [[compass and straightedge]] alone, but the regular heptagon cannot.

The western Ghubar Arabs' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight, though they showed some tendencies to making the [[grapheme|character]] more rectilinear. The eastern [[Arab]]s developed the character from a 6 lookalike into an uppercase V lookalike. Both modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a two-stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner, a line that is slightly curved in some font variants. As is the case with the [[Europe]]an glyph, the Cham and Khmer glyph for 7 also evolved to look like their glyph for 1, though in a different way, so they were also concerned with making their 7 more different. For the Khmer this often involved adding a horizontal line above the glyph.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl. David Bellos et al. London: The Harvill Press (1998): 395, Fig. 24.67</ref> This is analogous to the horizontal stroke through the middle that is sometimes used in handwriting in the Western world but which is almost never used in computer fonts. This horizontal stroke is, however, important to distinguish the glyph for seven from the glyph for [[1 (number)|one]] in writings that use a long upstroke in the glyph for 1. In some Greek dialects of early 12th&nbsp;century the longer line diagonal was drawn in a rather semicircular transverse line. \n[[File:sevens.svg|right|x50px]]\n[[File:Digital77.svg|left|x50px]]\nOn the [[seven-segment display]]s of pocket calculators and digital watches, 7 is the number with the most common glyph variation (1, 6 and 9 also have variant glyphs). Most calculators use three line segments, but on [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], [[Casio]], and a few other brands of calculators, 7 is written with four line segments because, in Japan, Korea and Taiwan 7 is written as ① in the illustration to the right.\n\nWhile the shape of the 7 character has an [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] in most modern [[typeface]]s, in typefaces with [[text figures]] the character usually has a [[descender]], as, for example, in [[File:TextFigs078.svg|40px]].\n\n[[File:Hand Written 7.svg|left|x50px]]Most people in Continental Europe,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Aamulehti: Opetushallitus harkitsee numero 7 viivan palauttamista |author=Eeva Törmänen |date=September 8, 2011 |journal=Tekniikka & Talous |url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/viihde/aamulehti+opetushallitus+harkitsee+numero+7+viivan+palauttamista/a682831 |language=Finnish}}</ref> and some in Britain and Ireland as well as Latin America, write 7 with a line in the middle (\"<s>7</s>\"), sometimes with the top line crooked. The line through the middle is useful to clearly differentiate the character from the [[1 (number)|number one]], as the two can appear similar when written in certain styles of handwriting.

If he repeats his point, the Pass line wins. If he rolls a seven, not only does the Pass line lose, the shooter loses control of the dice.

It is twice 4 or four times 2.\n* a [[power of two]], being 2{{sup|3}} (two cubed), and is the first number of the form {{mvar|p<sup>3</sup>}}, {{mvar|p}} being an integer greater than 1.\n* the first number which is neither [[prime]] nor [[semiprime]].\n* the base of the [[octal]] number system, which is mostly used with [[computer]]s.

In modern computers, a [[byte]] is a grouping of eight bits, also called an [[wikt:octet|octet]].\n* a [[Fibonacci number]], being {{num|3}} plus {{num|5}}. The next Fibonacci number is {{num|13}}. 8 is the only positive Fibonacci number, aside from 1, that is a perfect cube.<ref>Bryan Bunch, ''The Kingdom of Infinite Number''. New York: W. H.

[[Figurate number]]s representing octagons (including eight) are called [[octagonal number]]s.\n\nA [[polyhedron]] with eight faces is an [[octahedron]]. A [[cuboctahedron]] has as faces six equal squares and eight equal regular triangles.\n\nA [[cube]] has eight [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]].\n\n[[Sphenic number]]s always have exactly eight divisors.\n\nThe number 8 is involved with a number of interesting mathematical phenomena related to the notion of [[Bott periodicity theorem|Bott periodicity]]. For example, if ''O''(∞) is the direct limit of the inclusions of real orthogonal groups\n:<math>O(1)\\hookrightarrow O(2)\\hookrightarrow\\ldots\\hookrightarrow O(k)\\hookrightarrow\\ldots</math>,\nthen\n:<math>\\pi_{k+8}(O(\\infty))\\cong\\pi_{k}(O(\\infty))</math>.\n\nClifford algebras also display a periodicity of 8. For example, the algebra ''Cl''(''p'' + 8,''q'') is isomorphic to the algebra of 16 by 16 matrices with entries in ''Cl''(''p'',''q''). We also see a period of 8 in the [[K-theory]] of spheres and in the [[group representation|representation theory]] of the [[special orthogonal group|rotation group]]s, the latter giving rise to the 8 by 8 [[spinor]]ial chessboard. All of these properties are closely related to the properties of the [[octonion]]s.\n\nThe [[spin group]] Spin(8) is the unique such group that exhibits the phenomenon of [[triality]].\n\nThe lowest-dimensional even [[unimodular lattice]] is the 8-dimensional [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] lattice. Even positive definite unimodular lattices exist only in dimensions divisible by 8.\n\nA figure 8 is the common name of a [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]], often used in the context of sports, such as skating.

The Proto-Indo-European reconstruction ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/oḱtṓw|*oḱtṓ(w)-]]'' itself has been argued as representing an old dual, which would correspond to an original meaning of \"twice four\". \nProponents of this \"quaternary hypothesis\" adduce the numeral ''{{num|9}}'', which might be built on the stem ''new-'', meaning \"new\" (indicating the beginning of a \"new set of numerals\" after having counted to eight).<ref>the hypothesis is discussed critically (and rejected as \"without sufficient support\") by \nWerner Winter, 'Some thought about Indo-European numerals' in: Jadranka Gvozdanović (ed.), \n''Indo-European Numerals'', Walter de Gruyter, 1992, 14f.</ref>\n\n==Glyph==\n[[Image:Evo8glyph.svg|thumb|Evolution of the numeral 8 from the Indians to the Europeans]]\nThe modern 8 glyph, like all modern [[Arabic numerals]] (other than zero) originates with the [[Brahmi numerals]]. \nThe Brahmi numeral for ''eight'' by the 1st&nbsp;century was written in one stroke as a curve └┐ looking like an uppercase H with the bottom half of the left line and the upper half of the right line removed.\nHowever the ''eight'' glyph used in India in the early centuries of the Common Era developed considerable variation, and in some cases took the shape of a single wedge, which was adopted into the Perso-Arabic tradition as [[:wikt:٨|٨]] (and also gave rise to the later Devanagari numeral [[:wikt:८|८]]; the alternative curved glyph also existed as a variant in Perso-Arabic tradition, where it came to look similar to our glyph ''5''.{{year needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe numerals as used in [[Al-Andalus]] by the 10th century were a distinctive western variant of the glyphs used in the Arabic-speaking world, known as ''ghubār'' numerals (''ghubār'' translating to \"[[sand table]]\"). In these numerals, the line of the ''5''-like glyph used in Indian manuscripts for eight came to be formed in ghubār as a closed loop, which was the ''8''-shape that became adopted into European use in the 10th&nbsp;century.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl.

These are later (controversially) associated with the Eight Consciousnesses according to the [[Yogacara]] school of thought: consciousness in the five senses, thought-consciousness, self-consciousness, and unconsciousness-\"consciousness\" or \"store-house consciousness\" (alaya-vijñana). The \"irreversible\" state of enlightenment, at which point a Bodhisattva goes on \"autopilot\", is the Eight Ground or ''bhūmi''. In general, \"eight\" seems to be an auspicious number for Buddhists, e.g., the \"eight auspicious symbols\" (the jewel-encrusted parasol; the goldfish (always shown as a pair, e.g., the glyph of Pisces); the self-replenishing amphora; the white ''kamala'' lotus-flower; the white conch; the eternal (Celtic-style, infinitely looping) knot; the banner of imperial victory; the eight-spoked wheel that guides the ship of state, or that symbolizes the Buddha's teaching).

Eight gives an idea of growing prosperous, because the letter ({{nihongo2|八}}) broadens gradually.\n* The Japanese thought of {{Nihongo|eight|や|ya}} as a holy number in the ancient times. The reason is less well-understood, but it is thought that it is related to the fact they used eight to express large numbers vaguely such as {{Nihongo|manyfold|やえはたえ|Yae Hatae}} (literally, eightfold and twentyfold), {{Nihongo|many clouds|やくも|Yakumo}} (literally, eight clouds), {{Nihongo|millions and millions of Gods|やおよろずのかみ|Yaoyorozu no Kami}} (literally, eight millions of Gods), etc. It is also guessed that the ancient Japanese gave importance to pairs, so some researchers guess twice as {{Nihongo|four|よ|yo}}, which is also guessed to be a holy number in those times because it indicates the world (north, south, east, and west) might be considered a very holy number.\n* In [[numerology]], 8 is the number of building, and in some theories, also the number of destruction.\n\n====In astrology====\n* In [[astrology]], [[Scorpius|Scorpio]] is the 8th [[astrological sign]] of the [[Zodiac]].\n* In the [[Middle Ages]], 8 was the number of \"unmoving\" stars in the sky, and symbolized the perfection of incoming planetary energy.\n\n===In music and dance===\n* A note played for one-eighth the duration of a whole note is called an [[eighth note]], or quaver.\n* An [[octave]], the interval between two [[musical note]]s with the same letter name (where one has double the frequency of the other), is so called because there are eight notes between the two on a standard major or minor [[diatonic scale]], including the notes themselves and without chromatic deviation.

The Kshatrapa, Andhra and Gupta started curving the bottom vertical line coming up with a {{num|3}}-look-alike. The Nagari continued the bottom stroke to make a circle and enclose the 3-look-alike, in much the same way that the ''@'' character encircles a lowercase ''a''. As time went on, the enclosing circle became bigger and its line continued beyond the circle downwards, as the 3-look-alike became smaller. Soon, all that was left of the 3-look-alike was a squiggle. The Arabs simply connected that squiggle to the downward stroke at the middle and subsequent European change was purely cosmetic.\n\nWhile the shape of the 9 character has an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] in most modern [[typeface]]s, in typefaces with [[text figures]] the character usually has a [[descender]], as, for example, in [[File:TextFigs196.png]].\n\nThis numeral resembles an inverted ''6''. To disambiguate the two on objects and documents that can be inverted, the 9 is often underlined, as is done for the 6. Another distinction from the 6 is that it is sometimes handwritten with a straight stem, resembling a raised lower-case letter '''q'''.\n\n==Alphabets and codes==\n*In the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]], the digit 9 is called \"Niner\".\n*Five-digit [[produce]] [[Price Look-Up code|PLU codes]] that begin with 9 are [[Organic food|organic]].\n\n==Commerce==\n*Common terminal digit in [[psychological pricing]].\n\n==Culture and mythology==\n===Indian culture===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nNine is a number that appears often in [[Indian culture]] and mythology.

Ten is the eighth [[Perrin number]], preceded in the sequence by 5, 5, 7.\n\n*A [[polygon]] with ten sides is a [[decagon]], and 10 is a [[decagonal number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001107|title=Sloane's A001107 : 10-gonal (or decagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> Because 10 is the product of a power of 2 (namely 2<sup>1</sup>) with nothing but distinct [[Fermat prime]]s (specifically 5), a regular decagon is a [[constructible polygon]].\n\n*Ten is also a [[triangular number]], a [[centered triangular number]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005448|title=Sloane's A005448 : Centered triangular numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> and a [[tetrahedral number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000292|title=Sloane's A000292 : Tetrahedral numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\n*Ten is the number of [[Eight queens puzzle|''n'' queens problem]] solutions for ''n'' = 5.\n\n*Ten is the smallest number whose status as a possible [[friendly number]] is unknown.\n\n*Ten factorial seconds is exactly equal to 6 weeks.\n*According to a conjecture, ten is the average sum of the proper divisors of the natural numbers if the size of the numbers approaches infinity {{OEIS|A297575}}.\n\n*Ten is the smallest number whose [[fourth power]] can be written as a sum of two squares in two different ways.

Any integer written in the decimal system can be multiplied by ten by adding a zero to the end (e.g. 855 × 10 = 8550).\n\n==== Roman numerals ====\nThe [[Roman numeral]] for ten is [[X]] (which looks like two Vs [the Roman numeral for 5] put together); it is thought that the V for five is derived from an open hand (five digits displayed), and X for ten from both hands. Incidentally, the [[Chinese numeral|Chinese word numeral]] for ten, is also a cross: {{lang|zh|[[wikt:十|十]]}}.\n\n==== Positional numeral systems other than decimal ====\nThe digit '1' followed by '0' is how the value of ''p'' is written in base ''p''.

It is the first compound number in many other languages, e.g., Italian ''ùndici'' (but in Spanish and Portuguese, 16, and in French, 17 is the first compound number), Chinese 十一 ''shí yī'', Korean 열한 ''yeol han''.\n\n==In mathematics==\n11 is a [[prime number]]. It is the smallest two-digit prime number in the [[decimal]] [[radix|base]].\n\nThe next prime is [[13 (number)|13]], with which it comprises a [[twin prime]].\n\nIf a number is divisible by 11, reversing its digits will result in another multiple of 11. As long as no two adjacent digits of a number added together exceed 9, then multiplying the number by 11, reversing the digits of the product, and dividing that new number by 11, will yield a number that is the reverse of the original number. (For example: 142,312 × 11 = 1,565,432 → 2,345,651 ÷ 11 = 213,241.)\n\nMultiples of 11 by one-digit numbers all have matching double digits: 00 (=0), 11, 22, 33, 44, etc.\n\nAn 11-sided [[polygon]] is called a [[hendecagon|hendecagon or undecagon]].\n\nThere are 11 [[List of convex uniform tilings|regular and semiregular convex uniform tilings]] in the second dimension, and 11 [[List of convex uniform tilings|planigons]] that correspond to these 11 regular and semiregular tilings.\n\nIn base 10, there is a simple test to determine if an integer is divisible by 11: take every digit of the number located in odd position and add them up, then take the remaining digits and add them up. If the difference between the two sums is a multiple of 11, including 0, then the number is divisible by 11.<ref>{{cite book |title=Number Story: From Counting to Cryptography |last=Higgins |first=Peter |year=2008 |publisher=Copernicus |location=New York |isbn=978-1-84800-000-1 |page=47 |pages= }}</ref> For instance, if the number is 65,637 then (6 + 6 + 7) - (5 + 3) = 19 - 8 = 11, so 65,637 is divisible by 11. This technique also works with groups of digits rather than individual digits, so long as the number of digits in each group is odd, although not all groups have to have the same number of digits. For instance, if one uses three digits in each group, one gets from 65,637 the calculation (065) - 637 = -572, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test for divisibility is to separate a number into groups of two consecutive digits (adding a leading zero if there is an odd number of digits), and then add up the numbers so formed; if the result is divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11. For instance, if the number is 65,637, 06 + 56 + 37 = 99, which is divisible by 11, so 65,637 is divisible by eleven. This also works by adding a trailing zero instead of a leading one: 65 + 63 + 70 = 198, which is divisible by 11. This also works with larger groups of digits, providing that each group has an even number of digits (not all groups have to have the same number of digits).\n\nAn easy way of [[Multiplication|multiplying]] numbers by 11 in base 10 is:\nIf the number has:\n*1 digit - Replicate the digit (so 2 × 11 becomes 22).\n*2 digits - Add the 2 digits together and place the result in the middle (so 47 × 11 becomes 4 (11) 7 or 4 (10+1) 7 or (4+1) 1 7 or 517).\n*3 digits - Keep the first digit in its place for the result's first digit, add the first and second digits together to form the result's second digit, add the second and third digits together to form the result's third digit, and keep the third digit as the result's fourth digit.

Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\nIn [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zwölf''). The [[Duden]]{{year needed|date=May 2018}} (the German standard dictionary) mentions this rule as outdated.\n\n==Mathematical properties==\nTwelve is a [[composite number]], the smallest number with exactly six [[divisor]]s, its divisors being [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]] and 12. Twelve is also a [[highly composite number]], the next one being [[24 (number)|twenty-four]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nTwelve is the smallest [[abundant number]], since it is the smallest integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16) is greater than itself. Twelve is a [[sublime number]], a number that has a [[perfect number]] of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A081357|title=Sloane's A081357 : Sublime numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a [[semiperfect number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005835|title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIf an odd [[perfect number]] is of the form 12''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.\n\nA twelve-sided [[polygon]] is a [[dodecagon]]. A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.\n\nTwelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists. This cusp form is the discriminant Δ(''q'') whose Fourier coefficients are given by the [[Ramanujan]] {{mvar|&tau;}}-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at −1 i.e. ζ(−1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;−{{sfrac|12}}, the fact that the abelianization of [[SL(2,Z)]] has twelve elements, and even the properties of lattice polygons.\n\nThere are twelve [[Jacobian elliptic function]]s and twelve cubic [[distance-transitive graph]]s.\n\nThere are 12 [[Latin square]]s of size 3 × 3.\n\nThe [[duodecimal]] system (12<sub>10</sub> [twelve] =&nbsp;10<sub>12</sub>), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many [[ancient weights and measures|ancient]] and [[medieval weights and measures]], including [[hour]]s, probably originates from [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn [[base thirteen]] and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), twelve is represented as C.

For example, there are thirteen stars on the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and there are thirteen stripes on the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].\n**The first flag of the United States bore thirteen stripes, alternating red and white, and thirteen white stars in the blue union. The thirteen stripes represented the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from which the United States was created, and the thirteen stars represented the number of states in the new nation.  When two new states were added to the Union in 1795, the flag bore fifteen stars and fifteen stripes.  With the addition of five new states in 1818, the number of stripes was re-set and permanently fixed at thirteen.\n**The [[Great Seal of the United States]] bears many images of the number thirteen, representing the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from which the United States was created.  On the Seal's observe, the overhead glory bears thirteen stars.  The chest shield in front of the spread eagle bears thirteen stripes (seven white and six red).  In the eagle's right talon, it holds the Olive Branch of Peace, bearing thirteen olives and thirteen olive leaves.

In old days, weighing was done with a beam balance to make equal splits. It would be easier to split a heap of grains into sixteen equal parts through successive divisions than to split into ten parts. Chinese Taoists did finger computation on the trigrams and hexagrams by counting the finger tips and joints of the fingers with the tip of the thumb. Each hand can count up to 16 in such manner.
