      "text": "thumb|right|160px|Theodor Molien (ca 1920)\n\nTheodor Georg Andreas Molien (;  in Riga – 25 December 1941 in Tomsk) was a Baltic-German mathematician. He was born in Riga, Latvia, which at that time was a part of Russian Empire. Molien studied associative algebras and polynomial invariants of finite groups.\n\nLife\n\nYouth in Riga\nTheodor Molien's father Eduard Molien was a teacher at the Riga Governorate Gymnasium. Theodor entered that gymnasium in 1872 and graduated in 1879.\n\nStudies and work in Dorpat\nIn January 1880 Molien entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu) as a student of astronomy. To support his studies his family also moved to Dorpat (now Tartu). In October 1883 the council of the university gave him the degree of a candidate of astronomy. His thesis \"Bahn des Cometen 1880 III\" was published in Astronomische Nachrichten No. 2510. His further work was supervised by the head of the chair of applied mathematics of the University of Dorpat Anders Lindstedt. In a report to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat Lindstedt acknowledges Molien as having unquestionably exceptional scientific talent (unzweifelhaft ungewöhnliche wissenschaftliche Begabung).\n\nIn the autumn of 1883, as part of his studies Molien was sent to Leipzig for three semesters. There he attended lectures by Felix Klein on different fields of mathematics and worked in his seminar. He also attended lectures of Carl Neumann, Eduard Study, Wilhelm Killing and Georg Scheffers. At that time Klein was dealing with deep problems of algebra and theory of functions of a complex variable. Following his suggestion, Molien started to study linear transformations of elliptic functions. The obtained results he submitted to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat as a master thesis titled \"Ueber die lineare Transformation der elliptischen Functionen\". In spring 1885 Molien passed the master's exams and after the defence in the autumn of 1885 he obtained the scientific degree of a Master of Mathematics. In November 1885 he became a docent at the University of Dorpat. This position he held for 15 years.\n\nSummers (that were free from teaching) of 1886, 1888 and 1889 Molien spent in scientific centers of Germany. His interest concentrated on so-called higher complex numbers (nowadays called hypercomplex numbers). His studies resulted in his article \"Über Systeme höherer komplexer Zahlen\" (\"On systems of higher complex numbers\"), published in 1891 in Mathematische Annalen.\n\nOn 30 September 1892, Molien defended his dissertation, also titled \"Über Systeme höherer komplexer Zahlen\". He got the degree of a doctor of pure mathematics. The importance of his work was acknowledged by Georg Frobenius, Sophus Lie and other mathematicians. One of the main results of his dissertation sounds in modern terms as follows: every simple associative algebra over the field of complex numbers is isomorphic to the algebra of square matrices of a suitable order over the same field.\n\nFor his scientific achievements, in 1892 Molien was elected a member of Moscow Mathematical Society. In 1894 French mathematicians awarded him a golden medal dedicated to the seventieth birthday of Charles Hermite. During Dorpat years, Molien had mathematical correspondence with Frobenius and Hurwitz.\n\nSince the University of Dorpat had only one professorship in pure mathematics, Molien had to stay for years at docent's position. Being a docent in Dorpat, Molien prepared and gave different lecture courses: Theory of analytic and elliptic functions, modern geometry and algebra, theory of algebraic equations, number theory, projective geometry, theory of quaternions, history of mathematics and others. Some of these courses were new for the university.\n\nIn 1887 Russian powers decided to change the language of secondary and higher education in Baltic governorates from German to Russian with the deadline 1 January 1895. With the purpose of improving his Russian language, Molien was sent to Moscow for the year 1892.\n\nCareer in Tomsk\nOnly in December 1900 Molien was given a professor's position, but not in Dorpat, but in the starting Tomsk Technological Institute in Siberia. He became the first professor of mathematics in Siberia. His was given a task of organizing teaching mathematics at the institute. In Tomsk, besides giving courses in mathematical analysis and differential equations, he wrote textbooks and exercise books on these subjects, and also established a mathematical library at the institute.\n\nKnown for his oppositional political views, he had to retire in 1913. Since 1914, Molien was a professor at higher Siberian courses for women in Tomsk, and when in 1917 the faculty of physics and mathematics was opened at the Tomsk State University, he got a professorship there, and stayed at that university until his death on 25 December 1941.\n\nIn Tomsk Molien spent 41 years of his life. These years were scientifically not as fruitful as earlier years.\n\nHe got the title of Honoured Worker of Science.\n\nWorks\nBahn des Cometen 1880 III (candidates thesis), Astron. Nachr.

In 1897-1898 he was in correspondence with a leading Russian chess player Mikhail Chigorin. He was one of the strongest chess players in Dorpat and was particularly known for his blindfold play (Ken Whyld, personal communication, 1995). He was president of the Dorpat chess club, and several of his games were published in the chess journal Baltische Schachblätter (edited by Friedrich Amelung). In 1898 Molien published four chess studies.\n\nTo 1895 dates his manuscript \"On theory of assigning prizes in tournaments\".\n\nMolien had also talent for languages. He knew German, Estonian, French, Swedish already before he entered gymnasium where he learned Greek, Hebrew, Latin, English, Italian. Later he learned Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Norwegian.\n\nSee also\nMolien series\n List of Baltic German scientists\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:1861 births\nCategory:1941 deaths\nCategory:People from Riga\nCategory:People from the Governorate of Livonia\nCategory:Baltic-German people\nCategory:Imperial Russian mathematicians\nCategory:Soviet mathematicians\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:19th-century Russian mathematicians\nCategory:20th-century mathematicians\nCategory:University of Tartu alumni\nCategory:University of Tartu faculty\nCategory:Tomsk State University faculty\nCategory:Tomsk Polytechnic University faculty\nCategory:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 2nd class\nCategory:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 3rd class\nCategory:Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 2nd class\nCategory:Tomsk State Pedagogical University faculty"

      "text": "Mark Aronovich Naimark () (5 December 1909 – 30 December 1978) was a Soviet mathematician who made important contributions to functional analysis and mathematical physics.\n\n Life \nNaimark was born on 5 December 1909 in Odessa, part of modern-day Ukraine, but which was then part of the Russian Empire. His family was Jewish, his father Aron Iakovlevich Naimark a professional artist, and his mother Zefir Moiseevna. He was four years old at the onset of World War I in 1914, and seven when the tumultuous Russian Revolution began in 1917. Showing an early talent for mathematics, Naimark enrolled in a technical college at the age of fifteen in 1924 soon after the Russian Civil War had ended. There he studied while working at a foundry until enrolling in the Physics and Mathematics faculty at Odessa Institute of National Education in 1929. He married his wife Larisa Petrovna Shcherbakova in 1932, with whom he would have two sons.\n\nIn 1933, Naimark began graduate studies at Odessa State University in the Department of the Theory of Functions. He was supervised by the functional analyst Mark Krein, completing his candidate's dissertation in 1936. Krein was at the time still a young mathematician, only two years older than Naimark, but had already built a research group in functional analysis, and they worked together on some Naimark's first works on symmetric and Hermitian forms. In 1938 Naimark began his doctoral studies at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, where he developed his renowned work on self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators, and began a collaboration with Israel Gelfand that would last for over a decade. He received his doctorate in 1941, and was made a chair at the Seismological Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1941 Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, and in the same year the Romanian and German occupation of the Ukraine led to the 1941 Odessa massacre in Naimark's hometown. Naimark joined special duty (called \"home-guard\") during the war and worked on the labor front, moving to Tashkent with the Seismological Institute at the end of 1941 as the Nazi army advanced on Moscow, where he remained until 1943.\n\nAfter the war Naimark returned to Moscow, where he worked in various institutes, and in 1954 became a professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Physico-Technical Institute of Moscow. He was appointed a professor at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in 1962, where he stayed for the remainder of his career, and supervised seven doctoral students. During the writing of his last book, Theory of group representations, Naimark was too sick to write by himself, and so completed it by dictation to his wife. Naimark died on 30 December 1978 at age 69 after a prolonged illness, and was buried in Kuntsevo Cemetery in Moscow. He had written 123 papers and five books.\n\nWork\nNaimark's interests were formed in the 1930s during a golden age of functional analysis in the USSR. His early work with Krein included development of the theory of separation of roots of algebraic equations. Naimark also began to take interest in pedagogical techniques at this time, an interest that would stay with him for the rest of his life. After moving to the Steklov Institute of Mathematics for his D.Sc. Naimark worked intensively on spectral theory, extensions of symmetric operators, and the representation theory of locally compact operators. His collaboration with Israel Gelfand in the 1930s and 1940s led to several fundamental results in functional analysis, including the 1943 Gelfand-Naimark theorem and the GNS theorem.\n\nDuring his service in World War II Naimark wrote several papers on seismology, and helping to develop the Spectral theory of ordinary differential equations. He worked especially on second-order singular differential operators with a continuous spectrum, using eigenfunctions to describe their spectral decompositions, and studying the concept of a spectral singularity. His results are summarized in the monograph Linear Differential Operators, which was published in 1954.\n\nIn 1956 Naimark published his monograph Normed Rings, which gave the first comprehensive treatment of Banach algebras, and was enormously influential in the development of the field. His 1958 monograph Linear representations of the Lorentz group helped to develop the theory of representations of the fundamental series of the complex classical groups, beginning with SL(2,C). With Zhelobenko he later generalized these results to all complex semisimple Lie groups. In the 1960s Naimark's interests focused more intensively on the representation theory of groups and algebras in spaces with an indefinite metric, which became the subject of his last (1976) monograph, The theory of group representations.\n\nNaimark's name is associated with several important ideas in functional analysis:\n The Gelfand–Naimark theorem on the representation of C*-algebras by bounded operators\n Naimark's dilation theorem on extensions of symmetric operators\n The Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction (the GNS construction) establishing a correspondence between cyclic *-representations and linear functionals\n Naimark's problem on the irreducible representations of C*-algebras in terms of compact operators on a Hilbert space.\n Naimark equivalence of two group representations on a Banach space\n\nSelected publications\n Unitary representations of the classical group (with I.

      "text": "Johanna (Hanna) Neumann (née von Caemmerer) (12 February 1914 – 14 November 1971) was a German-born mathematician who worked on group theory.\n\n Biography \n\nNeumann was born on 12 February 1914 in Lankwitz, Steglitz-Zehlendorf (today a district of Berlin), Germany. She was the youngest of three children of Hermann and Katharina von Caemmerer.  As a result of her father's death in the first days of the First World War, the family income was small, and from the age of thirteen she was coaching school children.\n\nAfter two years at a private school she entered the Auguste-Viktoria-Schule, a girls' grammar school (Realgymnasium), in 1922.  She graduated in early 1932 and then entered the University of Berlin.  The lecture courses in mathematics that she took in her first year were: Introduction to Higher Mathematics given by Georg Feigl; Analytical Geometry and Projective Geometry both given by Ludwig Bieberbach, Differential and Integral Calculus given by Erhard Schmidt, and the Theory of Numbers given by Friedrich Schur.  She also took formal courses in physics, and attended lectures in psychology, literature and law.\nAs a result of her first year work, Hanna was awarded three-quarters' remission of fees and a position as a part-time assistant in the Mathematical Institute's library.\n\nA friendship between Hanna and Bernhard Neumann began in January 1933.  In March 1933, the Nazis came to power and in August 1933, Bernhard, who was Jewish, moved to Cambridge, England.  She visited Bernhard in London at Easter 1934 and they became secretly engaged.  After this she returned to Germany to continue her studies.\n\nIn her second year Neumann was part of a group of students who tried to prevent Nazi disruption of Jewish academics' lectures by ensuring that only genuine students attended.  She lost her job in the Mathematical Institute, presumably as a result of such activities. However she had by then been awarded, and continued to earn for the rest of her course, full remission of fees.\n\nIn the remainder of her undergraduate degree, she studied mathematics, physics and philosophy.  She completed her studies in 1936 with distinctions in the Staatsexamen in mathematics and physics. She began studying for her Ph.D. at the University of Göttingen in 1937, under the supervision of Helmut Hasse.\n\nDuring this time Bernhard and Hanna corresponded anonymously through friends, and were only able to meet once, in Denmark in 1936 when Bernhard was travelling to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.  In July 1938, Hanna moved to England.  She married Bernhard in December 1938 in Cardiff.  They went on to have five children.  The Neumanns moved to Oxford in 1940.\n\nNeumann completed her D Phil. in group theory at the Society of Home Students, Oxford in 1944 under Olga Taussky-Todd. Her thesis was entitled 'Sub-group Structure of Free Products of Groups with an Amalgamated Subgroup'.  The University of Oxford later awarded her a D.Sc. for her publications.\n\nFollowing her naturalisation as a British citizen, she took a teaching position at the University of Hull in 1946. From 1958 she took up a lecturing post at the Mathematics Department of Manchester College of Science and Technology (later to become UMIST). In 1961-1962 the Neumanns spent a year at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\n\nThe Neumanns moved to Australia in August 1963 to take academic positions at the Australian National University in Canberra. She was made chair of pure mathematics in 1964 and was dean of students between 1968 and 1969.\n\nShe died from a cerebral aneurysm while on a lecture tour in Ottawa, Ontario. A building at the Australian National University was named in her honour in 1973. Four of her five children became mathematicians including Peter M. Neumann.\n\n Research and Publications \n\nHer most widely known work \"Varieties of Groups\" was published in 1967.  It has been translated into Russian.  She published 34 articles, most in international journals.\n\n Teaching and Supervision \n\nAt the time of her appointment, the Department at ANU had recently started an  honours programme in mathematics and were looking for a relatively senior pure mathematician to be responsible for that aspect of the courses. Neumann\n\n..began organizing courses which would show the students something of mathematics as she saw it. She was able to introduce into the first year course, which had till then been entirely problem-oriented, a small strand of one lecture a week of an introduction to mathematics in the style of Feigl-Rohrbach. The later-year algebra courses much more thoroughly reflected her own interests and views. She continued to develop a style of teaching which aimed at making the acquisition of very abstract ideas accessible through judicious use of more concrete examples and well-graded exercises. \n\nHanna supervised 10 doctoral students and has 51 descendants.\n\n Recognition \n\n Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, elected in 1969.\n Fellow of the Australian College of Educators, elected in 1970.\n Two buildings at the Australian National University have been named after her.\n\n See also \nHanna Neumann conjecture\nHNN extension\n\n References \n\n External links \n\nCategory:Academics of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology\nCategory:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science\nCategory:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni\nCategory:University of Göttingen alumni\nCategory:Alumni of St Anne's College, Oxford\nCategory:Academics of the University of Hull\nCategory:German mathematicians\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Women mathematicians\nCategory:20th-century mathematicians\nCategory:1914 births\nCategory:1971 deaths\nCategory:Australian National University faculty\nCategory:People from Berlin\nCategory:Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty\nCategory:20th-century women mathematicians"

Praeger received BSc (1969) and MSc degrees from the University of Queensland (1974), and doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1973 under direction of Peter M. Neumann. She has published widely and has advised 27 PhD students (as of March 2018). She is currently Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Western Australia. She is best known for her works in group theory, algebraic graph theory and combinatorial designs.\n\nEducation\nPraeger completed her high school education at Brisbane Girls Grammar School. After graduating high school, Praeger went to the government vocational guidance section to inquire about how she could further study mathematics. The vocational guidance officer she spoke with tried to discourage her from studying mathematics further, suggesting she become a teacher or a nurse because two other girls who came to him wanting to study math weren't able to pass their courses. He reluctantly showed her an engineering course description, but she felt it didn't have enough mathematics. So she left without getting much information that day, but did continue on to receive her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Queensland.\n\nHaving met several women on the mathematics staff during her undergraduate studies, the prospect of becoming a mathematician didn't seem strange to her. During her first and second years she did honours studies in mathematics and physics, choosing to continue in mathematics after her second year. After completing her education at University of Queensland she was offered a research scholarship at ANU but chose instead to take the Commonwealth Scholarship to the University of Oxford and attended St Anne's College. At that point she knew she wanted to study algebra.\n\nAfter earning her doctorate in 1973, she obtained a research fellowship at ANU. She had her first opportunity at teaching regular classes at the University of Virginia during the semester she worked there. Afterwards, she returned to ANU, where she met her future husband, John Henstridge, who was studying statistics. She was later offered a short-term position at the University of Western Australia, which turned into a long term position, where she currently works today. In 1989 she received the degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Western Australia for her work on permutation groups and algebraic graph theory.\n\nCareer\n\nHer career has been largely the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Western Australia.  She was appointed full Professor in 1983 and was Head of the Department of Mathematics 1992–1994, inaugural Dean of Postgraduate Research Studies 1996–1998, Chair Promotions and Tenure Committee 2000–2004, Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Computing and Mathematics 2003–2006, ARC Professorial Fellow 2007. and ARC Federation Fellow in 2009.\n\nDuring her career, Praeger has been invited to speak at many conferences, including ones in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Morocco, Slovakia, Slovenia, France, Germany, USSR, Belgium, Iran, Italy, the Philippines, and Japan.\n\nAwards, honours and memberships\nPraeger is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, former president of the\nAustralian Mathematical Society (1992–1994 and first female President of the Society), and was appointed as a member of the Order of Australia in 1999 for her service to mathematics in Australia, especially through research and professional associations.\nOther awards include:\n In 1993 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by the Prince of Songkla University, Thailand.\n In 2003 she received the Centenary Medal of the Australian Government.\n In 2005 she was awarded Doctor Honoris Causis by the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.\n In 2009 she was named Western Australian Scientist of the Year.\n In 2011 she was awarded the Moyal Medal by Macquarie University, Australia (the first female recipient of the Medal since its establishment in 2000).\n She was awarded the 2011 Euler Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications (presented in 2017).\n In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 26 May 2013.\n In 2013 she was awarded the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal by the Australian Academy of Science (the first female recipient of the Medal since its establishment in 1935).\n In 2014 she was awarded the George Szekeres Medal by the Australian Mathematical Society (the first female recipient of the Medal since its establishment in 2002).\n In 2014 she was elected an Honorary Member of the London Mathematical Society.List of honorary members of the London Mathematical Society, retrieved 14 October 2015.\n In 2015 she was awarded an honorary doctorate in Mathematics Education by Yazd University, Iran.\n In 2015 she was awarded the Mehdi Behzad Prize of the Iranian Mathematical Society, for management in mathematics.\n In 2015 she was awarded Honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Saint Andrews, Scotland.\n In 2015 she was inducted into both the Western Australian Women's Hall of Fame and the Western Australian Science Hall of Fame., retrieved 10 June 2018.\n In 2017 she was awarded Honorary Doctor of Mathematics by the University of Queensland, Australia.\n in 2018 she was awarded Honorary Doctor by the University of Primorska, Slovenia.

In 1986, he proved the conjecture of Paul Erdős that a graph with n vertices and its complement can be covered with n2/4+2 cliques.\n\nHe has also contributed to the study of permutation groups. In 1993, he provided an upper bound for the order of a 2-transitive group of degree n not containing An avoiding the use of the classification of finite simple groups.

      "title": "Eliyahu Rips",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Rips",
      "text": "Eliyahu Rips, also Ilya Rips (; ; ; born 12 December 1948) is an Israeli mathematician of Latvian origin known for his research in geometric group theory. He became known to the general public following his coauthoring a paper on what is popularly known as Bible code, the supposed coded messaging in the Hebrew text of the Torah.\n\nBiography\nRips grew up in Latvia (then part of Soviet Union). His mother was Jewish and from Riga, the only of nine siblings that survived the war; the others were killed in Rumbula and other places. His father Aaron was a Jewish mathematician from Belarus; his wife, children and all of his relatives were killed during The Holocaust. Rips was the first high school student from Latvia to participate in the International Mathematical Olympiad. In January 1969 he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast---then illegal in the USSR---of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student Jan Palach. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the University of Latvia, attempted self-immolation in a protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked cloths ablaze. A group of bystanders were able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips' neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated. The secret service wanted to make sure he was not a member of a group of would-be self-immolators. He was then incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. It was only after his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a following wave of petitions by Western mathematicians that Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, under further protests by mathematicians in the U.S., he was allowed to emigrate to Israel in 1972.\n\nAfter recovering from his wounds and finishing his Ph.D., Rips joined the Department of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the  Aharon Karzir Prize. In 1979, Rips received the Erdős Prize from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994.\n\nSince completing his Ph.D., Rips has been on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University where he holds the position of Professor. His current research interests concentrate on geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on -trees.\n\nRips' work on group actions on -trees is mostly unpublished. The Rips machine, in the hands of Rips and his student Zlil Sela, has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups.\n\nThe Bible Code controversy\nIn the late seventies, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah. In 1994, Rips, together with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg, published an article in the journal Statistical Science, \"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\", which claimed the discovery of encoded messages in the Hebrew text of Genesis. This, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1997 book The Bible Code by journalist Michael Drosnin. While Rips originally claimed that he agreed with Drosnin's findings, he later distanced himself from his interpretations. Since Drosnin's book, Bible codes have been a subject of controversy, with the claims being criticized by Brendan McKay and others. An early supporter of Rips' theories was Robert Aumann, Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 2005, who headed a commission overseeing Rips' experiments attempting to prove the existence of a secret code from God in the Torah. Eventually, Aumann abandoned the idea and withdrew his support from Rips.\n\nStatistical criticism\nA popular puzzle is to find words in a square array of letters that conform to a pattern, for example, a word may be spelled diagonally moving in a north west direction, or perhaps left-to-right taking every second letter. One can also look for hidden words\nin printed books, and this is what was done in The Bible Code. The more patterns that are allowed, the more words that can be\nfound, and elementary statistics can be used to estimate the probabilities of finding certain hidden messages. The statistician\nJeffrey S. Rosenthal shows in his book  that hidden messages are expected and\nhence should not be seen as divine messages, or predictions of the future. This point was illustrated by Brendan McKay by finding messages in text of Moby Dick that supposedly \"predict\" future assassinations of famous people.\n\nIn 1997, Eliyahu Rips shared an Ig Nobel Prize for Literature with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg from Israel, and Michael Drosnin from the United States, for their claimed statistical discovery of hidden equidistant letter sequences in the Bible.\n\nSelected papers\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nReferences\n\n Grūtups, A.

      "text": "Issai Schur (January 10, 1875 – January 10, 1941Ledermann, Walter, and Neumann, Peter M.; \"The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and Other Documents\", in Joseph, Melnikov, Rentschler (2003), p. 45.) was a Russian mathematician who worked in Germany for most of his life. He studied at the University of Berlin. He obtained his doctorate in 1901, became lecturer in 1903 and, after a stay at the University of Bonn, professor in 1919.\n\nAs a student of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, he worked on group representations (the subject with which he is most closely associated), but also in combinatorics and number theory and even theoretical physics. He is perhaps best known today for his result on the existence of the Schur decomposition and for his work on group representations (Schur's lemma).\n\nSchur published under the name of both I. Schur, and J. Schur, the latter especially in Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This has led to some confusion.\n\nChildhood\nIssai Schur was born into a Jewish family, the son of the businessman Moses Schur and his wife Golde Schur (née Landau). He was born in Mogilev on the Dnieper River in what was then the Russian Empire. Schur used the name Schaia rather than Issai up in his middle twenties.Vogt, Annette. Issai Schur: als Wissenschaftler vertrieben. In Schoeps, Grozinger & Mattenklott [401, S. 217–235 (1999)] Schur's father may have been a wholesale merchant.The Kopelman Foundation. Mogiljow. JewishGen Belarus SIG, on The Jewish Encyclopedia Web site www.jewishgen.org/belarus/je_mogilev.htm conceived, created, and funded by The Kopelman Foundation, accessed 28 December 2003.\n\nIn 1888, at the age of 13, Schur went to Liepāja (Courland, now in Latvia), where his married sister and his brother lived, 640 km north-west of Mogilev. Kurland was one of the three Baltic governorates of Tsarist Russia, and since the Middle Ages the Baltic Germans were the trend-setting social class.Blaushild, Immanuel. Libau.

(Translation of the 36-page booklet: A Town Named Libau in English, German and Hebrew and additional material about Libau, Editor and Publisher of booklet unknown, believed to have been published in Israel, 1985.) The local Jewish community spoke mostly German and not Yiddish.Beare, Arlene, ed.

Vogt, Anne Here he became fluent in German.\n\nEducation\nIn October 1894, Schur attended the University of Berlin, with concentration in mathematics and physics. In 1901, he graduated summa cum laude under Frobenius and Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs with his dissertation On a class of matrices that can be assigned to a given matrix,Schur, Issai. Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen. Doctoral dissertation, Universität Berlin, 1901; reprinted in Brauer k Rohrbach [71, Band I, pp. 1–72 (1973)] which contains a general theory of the representation of linear groups. According to Vogt,vgl. Vogt, Anne he began to use the name Issai at this time. Schur thought that his chance of success in the Russian Empire was rather poor,Chandler, Bruce; Magnus, Wilhelm. The History of Combinatorial Group Theory: A Case Study in the History of Ideas. Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 9. Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982. and because he spoke German so perfectly, he remained in Berlin. He graduated in 1903 and was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. Schur held a position as professor at the Berlin University for the ten years from 1903 to 1913.vgl. Biographie der Leopoldino Carolina\n\nIn 1913 he accepted an appointment as associate professor and successor of Felix Hausdorff at the University of Bonn. In the following years Frobenius tried various ways to get Schur back to Berlin. Among other things, Schur's name was mentioned in a letter dated June 27, 1913Hermann Weyl: Nachlaß. Handschriften und Nachlässe, ETH Bibliothek, 1006:1. from Frobenius to Robert Gnehm (the School Board President of the ETH)  as a possible successor to Carl Friedrich Geiser.Carl Friedrich Geiser (1843–1934), der bei Ludwig Schläfli in Bern promoviert hatte, war von 1873 bis 1913 ordentlicher Professor am Eidgenössischen Polytechnikum in Zürich. Frobenius complained that they had never followed his advice before and then said: \"That is why I can't even recommend Prof. J. Schur (now in Bonn) to you. He's too good for Zurich, and should be my successor in Berlin\". Hermann Weyl got the job in Zurich. The efforts of Frobenius were finally successful in 1916, when Schur succeeded Johannes Knoblauch as adjunct professor. Frobenius died a year later, on August 3, 1917. Schur and Carathéodory were both named as the frontrunners for his successor. But they chose Constantin Carathéodory in the end. In 1919 Schur finally received a personal professorship, and in 1921 he took over the chair of the retired Friedrich Hermann Schottky. In 1922, he was also added to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\n\nDuring the time of National Socialism\nAfter the takeover by the National Socialists and the elimination of the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were \"Jewish\" in origin; a subsequent regulation3. Verordnung zur Durchführung des Berufsbeamtengesetzes. Vom 6. Mai 1933, RGBl.I S.245f. extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system. His colleague Erhard Schmidt fought for his reinstatement, and since Schur had been a Prussian official before the First World War,Diese sogenannten \"Altbeamten\" waren von der Entlassung wegen jüdischer Abstammung vorerst ausgenommen, 1. Verordnung zur Durchführung des Berufsbeamtengesetzes. Vom 11. April 1933, RGBl.I S.195. he was allowed to participate in certain special lectures on teaching in the winter semester of 1933/1934 again. Schur withdrew his application for leave from the Science Minister and passed up the offer of a visiting professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for the academic year 1933–34.Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. Studies in Memory of Issai Schur, Birkhäuser 2003. Brief des Ministeriums vom 11. September 1933, Brief von Schur vom 15. September 1933 One element that likely played a role in the rejection of the offer was that Schur no longer felt he could cope with the requirements that would have come with a new beginning in an English-speaking environment.Diese Ansicht vertritt Alfred Brauer in seiner Gedenkrede\n\nAlready in 1932, Schur's daughter Hilde had married the doctor Chaim Abelin in Bern.Schur war sein 1906 mit der Ärztin Regina Frumkin verheiratet. Der Ehe entsprossen zwei Kinder Georg und Hilde. Georg, der etwas älter als Hilde war, studierte Physik und war später als Versicherungsmathematiker in Israel tätig. As a result, Issai Schur visited his daughter in Bern several times. In Zurich he met often with George Pólya, with whom he was on friendly terms since before the First World War.George Pólya (1887–1985) hatte sich nach seinem Studium in Budapest 1914 und nach Aufenthalten in Göttingen und Paris an der ETH habilitiert. 1928 wurde er zum ordentlichen Professor ernannt. Ab 1940 war er dann in den USA tätig, zuletzt an der Stanford University. – Seine Bekanntschaften mit Schur geht auf die Zeit vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg zurück: Es existieren zahlreiche Briefe von Schur an Pólya aus den Jahren 1913/14, die in den Stanford University Libraries aufbewahrt werden\n\nOn such a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1935, a letter reached Schur from Ludwig Bieberbach signed on behalf of the Rector's, stating that Schur should urgently seek him out in the University of Berlin.Mitteilung von Frau Susanne Abelin der Enkelin von Issai Schur, Sommer 2001. Der Brief vom 20. August 1935 ist in Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. Studies in Memory of Issai Schur, Birkhäuser 2003. Seite lxxii They needed to discuss an important matter with him. It involved Schur's dismissal on September 30, 1935.Die von Hitler und Göring unterschriebene Entpflichtungsurkunde datiert vom 28. September 1935. Siehe Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. Studies in Memory of Issai Schur, Birkhäuser 2003. Seite lxxiv. Die Entlassung wäre anhand des Reichsbürgergesetzes ohnehin spätestens zum 31. Dezember 1935 verfügt worden\n\nSchur remained a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences after his release as a professor, but a little later he lost this last remnant of his official position. Due to an intervention from Bieberbach in the spring of 1938 he was forced to explain his resignation from the commission of the Academy.Der Vorgang ist beschrieben im Buch von Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze: Mathematiker auf der Flucht vor Hitler. Dokumente zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Band 10. Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung, Vieweg, 1998. Seite 69/70; die Austrittserklärung datiert vom 6. April 1938. Das Buch enthält darüber hinaus weitere interessante Angaben über die Situation von Schur in den dreißiger Jahren His membership in the Advisory Board of the Mathematical Journal was ended in early 1939.Siehe Volker R. Remmert: Mathematical Publishing in the Third Reich. Math. Intelligencer 22 (3) 2000, Seite 22–30\n\nEmigration\n250px|thumb|Schur's grave at Trumpeldor Cemetery\nSchur found himself lonely after the flight of many of his students and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer.\"Long after the war, I talked to Grunsky about that remark and he literally started to cry: You know what I did? I sent him a postcard to contratulate him on his sixtieth birthday. I admired him so much and was very respectful in that card. How lonely he must have been to remember such a small thing\", Schiffer, Menachem Max; Issai Schur. Some Personal Reminiscences (1986); 1998 in: Begehr, H. (Hrsg.), Mathematik in Berlin. Geschichte und Dokumentation, 1998 Aachen. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo,Siehe dazu und für das Folgende: Alfred Brauers Gedenkrede in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration: emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day it does not seem to be clear who were the donors.\n\nSchur was able to leave Germany in early 1939.Vergleiche den Brief des Reichsministers für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung an Issai Schur vom 24. Februar 1939. Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. Studies in Memory of Issai Schur, Birkhäuser 2003. Seite lxxxi His health, however, was already severely compromised. He traveled in the company of a nurse to his daughter in Bern, where his wife also followed a few days later. There they remained for several weeks and then emigrated to Palestine.  Two years later, on his 66th birthday, on January 10, 1941, he died in Tel Aviv of a heart attack.\n\nWork\nSchur continued the work of his teacher Frobenius with many important works for group theory and representation theory. In addition, he published important results and elegant proofs of known results in almost all branches of classical algebra and number theory. His collected worksveröffentlicht von Alfred Brauer und Hans Rohrbach are an impressive proof of this. There, his work on the theory of integral equations and infinite series can be found.\n\nLinear groups\nIn his doctoral thesis Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen Issai Schur determined the polynomial representations of the general linear group  on the field  of complex numbers. The results and methods of this work are still relevant today.See Festschrift der DMV Seite 549 In his book, J.A. Green determined the polynomial representations of  over infinite fields  with arbitrary characteristic.Polynomial representations of   It is mainly based on Schur's dissertation. Green writes, \"This remarkable work (of Schur) contained many very original ideas, developed with superb algebraic skill. Schur showed that these (polynomial) representations are completely reducible, that each one is \"homogeneous\" of some degree , and that es equivalence types of irreducible polynomial representations of , of fixed homogeneous degree , are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions  of  into not more than  parts. Moreover, Schur showed that the character of an irreducible representation of type  is given by a certain symmetric function  in  variables, since described as a Schur function. According to Green, the methods of Schur's dissertation today are important for the theory of algebraic groups.\n\nIn 1927 Schur, in his work On the rational representations of the general linear group, gave new proofs for the main results of his dissertation. If  is the natural -dimensional  vector space on which  operates, and if  is a natural number, then the -fold tensor product  over  is a -module, on which the symmetric group   of degree  also operates by permutation of the tensor factors of each generator  of . By exploiting these -bimodule actions on , Schur manages to find elegant proofs of his sentences. This work of Schur was once very well known.\n\nProfessorship in Berlin\nSchur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years.vgö. Chandler, Bruce; Magnus, Wilhelm. Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory).Briining, Jochen; Ferus, Dirk; Siegmund-Schultze; Reinhard.

They tried to help as best they could.Urs Stammbach Die Zürcher Vorlesung von Issai Schur über Darstellungstheorie Seite xiii, ETH-Bibliothek 2004 On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on December 12, 1935Schulratsarchiv der ETH-Zürich.

Before his return to Germany he visited his daughter in Bern for a few days, and on 27 February he returned via Karlsruhe, where his sister lived, to Berlin. In a letter to Pólya from Berne, he concludes with the words: From Switzerland I take farewell with a heavy heart.Siehe Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries, 26. Februar 1936.\n\nIn Berlin, meanwhile, Ludwig Bieberbach, in a letter dated February 20, 1936, informed the Reich Minister for Science, Art, and Education on the journey of Schur, and announced that he wanted to find out what was the content of the lecture in Zurich.Der Vorgang wird beschrieben in Charles Curtis: Pioneers of representation theory.

November 1960 anlässlich der Schur-Gedenkfeier im Rahmen der 150-Jahrfeier der Universität Berlin. Siehe Issai Schur: Gesammelte Abhandlungen, Seiten v–xiv. Alfred Brauer hat 1928 bei Schur promoviert. As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation – During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.Heinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held – as is clear from oral statements and also from letters – Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. – If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him''.\n\nSchur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs.

He received his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in 1968, where his adviser was Charles W. Curtis. Seitz specializes in the study of algebraic and finite groups. Seitz has been active in the effort to exploit the relationship between algebraic groups and the finite groups of Lie type, in order to study the structure and representations of groups in the latter class. Such information is important in its own right, but was also critical in the classification of the finite simple groups, a major achievement of 20th century mathematics. Seitz made contributions to the classification of finite simple groups, such as those containing standard subgroups of Lie type. Following the classification, he pioneered the study of the subgroup structure of simple algebraic groups, and as an application went a long way towards solving the maximal subgroup problem for finite groups. For this work he received the Creativity Award from the National Science Foundation in 1991.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Santa Monica, California, graduated from University High School in 1961. In high school he was a bowling champion with an average of 194 and a pool shark.\n\n Education and career \nSeitz received his B.A. and Masters at University of California, Berkeley. He went on to earn his Ph.D. at the University of Oregon in 1968. He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1968. In 1970, he moved to University of Oregon as assistant professor, where he became a full professor in 1977 and a CAS Distinguished Professor in 2000. In his tenure at University of Oregon he also served as the Department Head of Mathematics and Associate Dean for the sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Sela. The isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups. I. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 141 (1995), no. 2, pp. 217–283. in mid-1990s of the isomorphism problem for torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups. The machinery of group actions on real trees, developed by Eliyahu Rips, played a key role in Sela's approach. The solution of the isomorphism problem also relied on the notion of canonical representatives for elements of hyperbolic groups, introduced by Rips and Sela in a joint 1995 paper.Z. Sela, and E. Rips. Canonical representatives and equations in hyperbolic groups, Inventiones Mathematicae vol. 120 (1995), no. 3, pp. 489–512 The machinery of the canonical representatives allowed Rips and Sela to prove algorithmic solvability of finite systems of equations in torsion-free hyperbolic groups, by reducing the problem to solving equations in free groups where the Makanin-Razborov algorithm can be applied. The technique of canonical representatives was later generalized by DahmaniFrançois Dahmani.\nAccidental parabolics and relatively hyperbolic groups.\nIsrael Journal of Mathematics, vol. 153 (2006), pp. 93–127 to the case of relatively hyperbolic groups and played a key role in the solution of the isomorphism problem for toral relatively hyperbolic groups.François Dahmani, and Daniel Groves, The isomorphism problem for toral relatively hyperbolic groups. Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS, vol. 107 (2008), pp. 211–290\n\nIn his work on the isomorphism problem Sela also introduced and developed the notion of a JSJ-decomposition for word-hyperbolic groups,Z. Sela. Structure and rigidity in (Gromov) hyperbolic groups and discrete groups in rank 1 Lie groups. II. Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 7 (1997), no. 3, pp. 561–593 motivated by the notion of a JSJ decomposition for 3-manifolds. A JSJ-decomposition is a representation of a word-hyperbolic group as the fundamental group of a graph of groups which encodes in a canonical way all possible splittings over infinite cyclic subgroups. The idea of JSJ-decomposition was later extended by Rips and Sela to torsion-free finitely presented groupsE. Rips, and Z. Sela. Cyclic splittings of finitely presented groups and the canonical JSJ decomposition. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 146 (1997), no. 1, pp. 53–109 and this work gave rise a systematic development of the JSJ-decomposition theory with many further extensions and generalizations by other mathematicians.M.

Papasoglu, JSJ-decompositions of finitely presented groups and complexes of groups. Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 16 (2006), no. 1, pp. 70–125 Sela applied a combination of his JSJ-decomposition and real tree techniques to prove that torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups are Hopfian.Zlil Sela, Endomorphisms of hyperbolic groups. I. The Hopf property.\nTopology, vol. 38 (1999), no. 2, pp. 301–321 This result and Sela's approach were later generalized by others to finitely generated subgroups of hyperbolic groupsInna Bumagina, The Hopf property for subgroups of hyperbolic groups. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 106 (2004), pp. 211–230 and to the setting of relatively hyperbolic groups.\n\nSela's most important work came in early 2000s when he produced a solution to a famous Tarski conjecture. Namely, in a long series of papers,Z. Sela. Diophantine geometry over groups. I. Makanin-Razborov diagrams. Publications Mathématiques. Institut de Hautes Études Scientifiques, vol. 93 (2001), pp. 31–105Z. Sela. Diophantine geometry over groups. II. Completions, closures and formal solutions.

Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 16 (2006), no. 3, pp. 707–730 he proved that any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups have the same first-order theory. Sela's work relied on applying his earlier JSJ-decomposition and real tree techniques as well as developing new ideas and machinery of \"algebraic geometry\" over free groups.\n\nSela pushed this work further to study first-order theory of arbitrary torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups and to characterize all groups that are elementarily equivalent to (that is, have the same first order theory as) a given torsion-free word-hyperbolic group. In particular, his work implies that if a finitely generated group G is elementarily equivalent to a word-hyperbolic group then G is word-hyperbolic as well.\n\nSela also proved that the first order theory of a finitely generated free group is stable in the model-theoretic sense, providing a brand-new and qualitatively different source of examples for the stability theory.\n\nAn alternative solution for the Tarski conjecture has been presented by Olga Kharlampovich and Alexei Myasnikov.O. Kharlampovich, and A. Myasnikov. Tarski's problem about the elementary theory of free groups has a positive solution.

He published over 50 papers, predominantly in the areas of geometric group theory and the topology of 3-manifolds.\n\nStallings delivered an invited address as the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice in 1970John R.

Accessed December 4, 2008\n\nMathematical contributions\n\nMost of Stallings' mathematical contributions are in the areas of geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology (particularly the topology of 3-manifolds) and on the interplay between these two areas.\n\nAn early significant result of Stallings is his 1960 proofJohn Stallings. Polyhedral homotopy spheres. Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 66 (1960), pp. 485–488. of the Poincaré Conjecture in dimensions greater than six. (Stallings' proof was obtained independently from and shortly after the different proof of Stephen Smale who established the same result in dimensions bigger than fourStephen Smale. Generalized Poincaré's conjecture in dimensions greater than four. Annals of Mathematics (2nd Ser.), vol. 74 (1961), no. 2, pp. 391–406).\n\nUsing \"engulfing\" methods similar to those in his proof of the Poincaré Conjecture for n > 6, Stallings proved that ordinary Euclidean n-dimensional space has a unique piecewise linear, hence also smooth, structure, if n is not equal to 4.  This took on added significance when, as a consequence of work of Michael Freedman and Simon Donaldson in 1982, it was shown that 4-space has exotic smooth structures, in fact uncountably many such.\n\nIn a 1963 paperJohn Stallings.\nA finitely presented group whose 3-dimensional integral homology is not finitely generated.\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics, vol. 85 (1963), pp. 541–543 Stallings constructed an example of a finitely presented group with infinitely generated 3-dimensional integral homology group and, moreover, not of the type , that is, not admitting a classifying space with a finite 3-skeleton. This example came to be called the Stallings group and is a key example in the study of homological finiteness properties of groups. Robert Bieri later showedRobert Bieri. Homological dimension of discrete groups.\nQueen Mary College Mathematical Notes. Queen Mary College, Department of Pure Mathematics, London, 1976. that the Stallings group is exactly the kernel of the homomorphism from the direct product of three copies of the free group  to the additive group Z of integers that sends to 1 ∈ Z the six elements coming from the choice of free bases for the three copies of . Bieri also showed that the Stallings group fits into a sequence of examples of groups of type  but not of type . The Stallings group is a key object in the version of discrete Morse theory for cubical complexes developed by Mladen Bestvina and Noel Brady and in the study of subgroups of direct products of limit groups.Martin R. Bridson, James Howie, Charles F. Miller, and Hamish Short. The subgroups of direct products of surface groups. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 92  (2002), pp. 95–103.Martin R. Bridson, and James Howie. Subgroups of direct products of elementarily free groups.  Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 17  (2007),  no. 2, pp. 385–403Martin R. Bridson, and James Howie. Subgroups of direct products of two limit groups.  Mathematical Research Letters, vol. 14 (2007), no. 4, 547–558.\n\nStallings' most famous theorem in group theory is an algebraic characterization of groups with more than one end (that is, with more than one \"connected component at infinity\"), which is now known as Stallings' theorem about ends of groups. Stallings proved that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if this group admits a nontrivial splitting as an amalgamated free product or as an HNN-extension over a finite group (that is, in terms of Bass–Serre theory, if and only if the group admits a nontrivial action on a tree with finite edge stabilizers). More precisely, the theorem states that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if either G admits a splitting as an amalgamated free product , where the group C is finite and C ≠ A, C ≠ B, or G admits a splitting as an HNN-extension  where K,L ≤ H are finite subgroups of H.\n\nStallings proved this result in a series of works, first dealing with the torsion-free case (that is, a group with no nontrivial elements of finite order)John R. Stallings. On torsion-free groups with infinitely many ends.  Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 88 (1968), pp. 312–334. and then with the general case.John Stallings. Groups of cohomological dimension one.  Applications of Categorical Algebra (Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Vol. XVIII, New York, 1968)  pp. 124–128. American Mathematical Society, Providence, R.I, 1970. Stalling's theorem yielded a positive solution to the long-standing open problem about characterizing finitely generated groups of cohomological dimension one as exactly the free groups.John R. Stallings. Groups of dimension 1 are locally free.  Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 74 (1968), pp. 361–364 Stallings' theorem about ends of groups is considered one of the first results in geometric group theory proper since it connects a geometric property of a group (having more than one end) with its algebraic structure (admitting a splitting over a finite subgroup). Stallings' theorem spawned many subsequent alternative proofs by other mathematicians (e.g.Martin J. Dunwoody. Cutting up graphs.  Combinatorica  2  (1982), no. 1, pp. 15–23.Warren Dicks and Martin J. Dunwoody. Groups acting on graphs. Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics, 17. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989. ) as well as many applications (e.g.Peter Scott. A new proof of the annulus and torus theorems.  American Journal of Mathematics, vol. 102  (1980), no. 2, pp. 241–277). The theorem also motivated several generalizations and relative versions of Stallings' result to other contexts, such as the study of the notion of relative ends of a group with respect to a subgroup,Gadde A. Swarup. Relative version of a theorem of Stallings.\nJournal of Pure and Applied Algebra, vol. 11 (1977/78), no. 1–3, pp. 75–82Martin J. Dunwoody and E. L. Swenson. The algebraic torus theorem.

Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society (3), vol.  71  (1995),  no. 3, pp. 585–617 A comprehensive survey discussing, in particular, numerous applications and generalizations of Stallings' theorem, is given in a 2003 paper of C. T. C. Wall.C. T. C. Wall. The geometry of abstract groups and their splittings.\nRevista Matemática Complutense vol. 16 (2003), no. 1, pp. 5–101.\n\nAnother influential paper of Stallings is his 1983 article \"Topology on finite graphs\".John R. Stallings. Topology of finite graphs.  Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 71  (1983),  no. 3, pp. 551–565 Traditionally, the algebraic structure of subgroups of free groups has been studied in combinatorial group theory using combinatorial methods, such as the Schreier rewriting method and Nielsen transformations.Roger C. Lyndon and Paul E. Schupp. Combinatorial Group Theory. Springer–Verlag, New York, 2001. \"Classics in Mathematics\" series, reprint of the 1977 edition.  Stallings' paper put forward a topological approach based on the methods of covering space theory that also used a simple graph-theoretic framework. The paper introduced the notion of what is now commonly referred to as Stallings subgroup graph for describing subgroups of free groups, and also introduced a foldings technique (used for approximating and algorithmically obtaining the subgroup graphs) and the notion of what is now known as a Stallings folding. Most classical results regarding subgroups of free groups acquired simple and straightforward proofs in this set-up and Stallings' method has become the standard tool in the theory for studying the subgroup structure of free groups, including both the algebraic and algorithmic questions (see Ilya Kapovich and Alexei Myasnikov. Stallings foldings and subgroups of free groups.  Journal of Algebra, vol. 248  (2002),  no. 2, 608–668). In particular, Stallings subgroup graphs and Stallings foldings have been the used as a key tools in many attempts to approach the Hanna Neumann conjecture.J. Meakin, and P. Weil. Subgroups of free groups: a contribution to the Hanna Neumann conjecture. \nProceedings of the Conference on Geometric and Combinatorial Group Theory, Part I (Haifa, 2000). \nGeometriae Dedicata, vol. 94 (2002), pp. 33–43.Bilal Khan.

Math., 296, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002; \n\nStallings subgroup graphs can also be viewed as finite state automata and they have also found applications in semigroup theory and in computer science.Jean-Camille Birget, and Stuart W. Margolis. Two-letter group codes that preserve aperiodicity of inverse finite automata. Semigroup Forum, vol. 76 (2008), no. 1, pp. 159–168D. S. Ananichev, A. Cherubini, M. V. Volkov.

A topological approach to inverse and regular semigroups. Pacific Journal of Mathematics, vol. 208 (2003), no. 2, pp. 367–396\n\nStallings' foldings method has been generalized and applied to other contexts, particularly in Bass–Serre theory for approximating group actions on trees and studying the subgroup structure of the fundamental groups of graphs of groups. The first paper in this direction was written by Stallings himself,John R. Stallings. Foldings of G-trees.  Arboreal group theory (Berkeley, CA, 1988), pp. 355–368, Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ., 19, Springer, New York, 1991;  with several subsequent generalizations of Stallings' folding methods in the Bass-Serre theory context by other mathematicians.Mladen Bestvina and Mark Feighn.

Stallings. Non-positively curved triangles of groups.  Group theory from a geometrical viewpoint (Trieste, 1990),  pp. 491–503, World Sci. Publ., River Edge, NJ, 1991;  introduced and studied the notion of a triangle of groups. This notion was the starting point for the theory of complexes of groups (a higher-dimensional analog of Bass-Serre theory), developed by André HaefligerAndré Haefliger. Complexes of groups and orbihedra. in: \"Group theory from a geometrical viewpoint (Trieste, 1990)\", pp. 504–540, World Sci. Publ., River Edge, NJ, 1991.  and others.Jon Corson. Complexes of groups.

Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences], 319. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999.  Stallings' work pointed out the importance of imposing some sort of \"non-positive curvature\" conditions on the complexes of groups in order for the theory to work well; such restrictions are not necessary in the one-dimensional case of Bass-Serre theory.\n\nAmong Stallings' contributions to 3-manifold topology, the most well-known is the Stallings fibration theorem.John R. Stallings. On fibering certain 3-manifolds. 1962 Topology of 3-manifolds and related topics (Proc. The Univ. of Georgia Institute, 1961) pp. 95–100. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J The theorem states that if M is a compact irreducible 3-manifold whose fundamental group contains a normal subgroup, such that this subgroup is finitely generated and such that the quotient group by this subgroup is infinite cyclic, then M fibers over a circle. This is an important structural result in the theory of Haken manifolds that engendered many alternative proofs, generalizations and applications (e.g.John Hempel and William Jaco. 3-manifolds which fiber over a surface.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. 1966 gave a group-theoretic reformulation of the famous Poincaré conjecture. The paper began with a humorous admission: \"I have committed the sin of falsely proving Poincaré's Conjecture. But that was in another country; and besides, until now, no one has known about it.\"  Despite its ironic title, Stallings' paper informed much of the subsequent research on exploring the algebraic aspects of the Poincaré Conjecture (see, for example,Robert Myers.

She completed high school in 1935 and married, taking the name Szmielew. In the same year she entered the University of Warsaw, where she studied logic under Adolf Lindenbaum, Jan Łukasiewicz, Kazimierz Kuratowski, and Alfred Tarski. Her research at this time included work on the axiom of choice, but it was interrupted by the 1939 Invasion of Poland.\n\nSzmielew became a surveyor during World War II, during which time she continued her research on her own, developing a decision procedure based on quantifier elimination for the theory of abelian groups. She also taught for the Polish underground. After the liberation of Poland, Szmielew took a position at the University of Łódź, which was founded in May 1945. In 1947, she published her paper on the axiom of choice, earned a master's degree from the University of Warsaw, and moved to Warsaw as a senior assistant..\n\nIn 1949 and 1950, Szmielew visited the University of California, Berkeley, where Tarski had found a permanent position after being exiled from Poland for the war. She completed a Ph.D. at Berkeley in 1950 under Tarski's supervision, with her dissertation consisting of her work on abelian groups.

After spending some time on the Mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago, he moved in 1970 to the Rouse Ball Professorship in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, England, and later moved to the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida as a Graduate Research Professor.  He is currently a Professor Emeritus of Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and professor of mathematics at the University of Florida.  He received the Abel Prize 2008 together with Jacques Tits.\n\nWork\nThompson's doctoral thesis introduced new techniques, and included the solution of a problem in finite group theory which had stood for around sixty years, the nilpotency of Frobenius kernels. At the time, this achievement was noted in The New York Timeshttp://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/lam/paper/html/NYTimes.html New York Times article, April 26, 1959..\n\nThompson became a figure in the progress toward the classification of finite simple groups.  In 1963, he and Walter Feit proved that all nonabelian finite simple groups are of even order (the Odd Order Paper, filling a whole issue of the Pacific Journal of Mathematics). This work was recognised by the award of the 1965 Cole Prize in Algebra of the American Mathematical Society. His N-group papers classified all finite simple groups for which the normalizer of every non-identity solvable subgroup is solvable. This included, as a by-product, the classification of all minimal finite simple groups (simple groups for which every proper subgroup is solvable). This work had some influence on later developments in the classification of finite simple groups, and was quoted in the citation by Richard Brauer for the award of Thompson's Fields Medal in 1970 (Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Nice, France, 1970).\n\nThe Thompson group Th is one of the 26 sporadic finite simple groups. Thompson also made major contributions to the inverse Galois problem. He found a criterion for a finite group to be a Galois group, that in particular implies that the monster simple group is a Galois group.\n\nAwards\nIn 1971, Thompson was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences.   In 1982, he was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize of the London Mathematical Society, and in 1988, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Oxford.

He introduced Tits buildings, the Tits alternative, the Tits group, and the Tits metric.\n\n Career \nTits was born in Uccle to Léon Tits, a professor, and Lousia André. Jacques attended the Athénée of Uccle and the Free University of Brussels. His thesis advisor was Paul Libois, and Tits graduated with his doctorate in 1950 with the dissertation Généralisation des groupes projectifs basés sur la notion de transitivité. His academic career includes professorships at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) (1962–1964), the University of Bonn (1964–1974) and the Collège de France in Paris, until becoming emeritus in 2000. He changed his citizenship to French in 1974 in order to teach at the Collège de France, which at that point required French citizenship. Because Belgian nationality law did not allow dual nationality at the time, he renounced his Belgian citizenship. He has been a member of the French Academy of Sciences since then.\n\nTits was an \"honorary\" member of the Nicolas Bourbaki group; as such, he helped popularize Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter's work, introducing terms such as Coxeter number, Coxeter group, and Coxeter graph.Siobhan Roberts, \"Donald Coxeter: The man who saved geometry\", Toronto Life, January 2003\n\n Honors \nTits received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1993, the Cantor Medal from the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung (German Mathematical Society) in 1996, and the German distinction \"Pour le Mérite\".  In 2008 he was awarded the Abel Prize, along with John Griggs Thompson, “for their profound achievements in algebra and in particular for shaping modern group theory.” He is a member of several Academies of Sciences.\n\nHe is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988.\n\n Contributions \nHe introduced the theory of buildings (sometimes known as Tits buildings), which are combinatorial structures on which groups act, particularly in algebraic group theory (including finite groups, and groups defined over the p-adic numbers). The related theory of (B, N) pairs is a basic tool in the theory of groups of Lie type. Of particular importance is his classification of all irreducible buildings of spherical type and rank at least three, which involved classifying all polar spaces of rank at least three. The existence of these buildings initially depended on the existence of a group of Lie type in each case, but in joint work with Mark Ronan he constructed those of rank at least four independently, yielding the groups directly. In the rank-2 case spherical building are generalized n-gons, and in joint work with Richard Weiss he classified these when they admit a suitable group of symmetries (the so-called Moufang polygons). In collaboration with François Bruhat he developed the theory of affine buildings, and later he classified all irreducible buildings of affine type and rank at least four.\n\nAnother of his well-known theorems is the \"Tits alternative\":  if G is a finitely generated subgroup of a linear group, then either G has a solvable subgroup of finite index or it has a free subgroup of rank 2.\n\nThe Tits group and the Tits–Koecher construction are named after him.\nHe introduced the Kneser–Tits conjecture.\n\n Publications \n\nJ.

Ulm, Gottfried Köthe in 1930.\nHelmut Ulm (born June 21, 1908 in Gelsenkirchen; died June 13, 1975) was a German mathematician who established the classification of countable periodic abelian groups by means of their Ulm invariants.\n\n Short biography \n\nHelmut Ulm's father was an elementary school teacher in Elberfeld. After finishing high school in Wuppertal in 1926, he attended the universities of Göttingen (1926–1927), Jena (1927) and Bonn (1927–1930), where he studied mathematics and physics, attending the lectures of Richard Courant, Erich Bessel-Hagen, Felix Hausdorff, and the joint Hausdorff–Otto Toeplitz seminar. He graduated summa cum laude in 1930 with a thesis about countable periodic abelian groups (1933). In 1933–1935 he was an assistant in Göttingen and worked with Wilhelm Magnus and Olga Taussky-Todd editing David Hilbert's Collected Works. His Habilitationsschrift developed a generalization of the elementary divisor theory to infinite matrices, continuing ideas of Ulm's teacher Toeplitz.\nIt was submitted in Münster in 1936 and refereed by Heinrich Behnke, Gottfried Köthe, F. K. Schmidt, and B. L. van der Waerden.  Ulm's promotion was delayed, apparently, due to his anti-Nazi views.\n\nFrom 1935 until his retirement in 1974 Ulm worked at the University of Münster, as an assistant, docent, and eventually professor (1968). Besides his three important papers on the classification of infinite abelian groups, Ulm published only a few notes in the proceedings of the Münster mathematical seminar, one of which dealt with solution of systems of linear equations by a computer. He suffered from poor health. During the World War II, Ulm worked as a cryptographer. After the war he mostly taught courses in applied mathematics and supervised several Ph.D. theses; those of G. Tillmann (1952) and G. Roth (1961) were close to his old work on infinite-dimensional linear algebra and infinite groups.\n\n Bibliography \n\n Helmut Ulm, Zur Theorie der abzählbar-unendlichen Abelschen Gruppen. Math.

Topology, vol. 20 (1981), no. 2, pp. 119–132.Karen Vogtmann, A Stiefel complex for the orthogonal group of a field. Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici, vol. 57 (1982), no. 1, pp. 11–21\n\nVogtmann's most important contribution came in a 1986 paper with Marc Culler called \"Moduli of graphs and automorphisms of free groups\". The paper introduced an object that came to be known as Culler–Vogtmann Outer space. The Outer space Xn, associated to a free group Fn, is a free group analogBenson Farb. Problems on Mapping Class Groups and Related Topics. American Mathematical Society, 2006.\n; p. 335 of the Teichmüller space of a Riemann surface. Instead of marked conformal structures (or, in an equivalent model, hyperbolic structures) on a surface, points of the Outer space are represented by volume-one marked metric graphs. A marked metric graph consists of a homotopy equivalence between a wedge of n circles and a finite connected graph Γ without degree-one and degree-two vertices, where Γ is equipped with a volume-one metric structure, that is, assignment of positive real lengths to edges of Γ so that the sum of the lengths of all edges is equal to one. Points of Xn can also be thought of as free and discrete minimal isometric actions Fn on real trees where the quotient graph has volume one.\n\nBy construction the Outer space Xn is a finite-dimensional simplicial complex equipped with a natural action of Out(Fn) which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler–Vogtmann 1986 paper, obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space Xn is contractible. Thus the quotient space Xn /Out(Fn) is \"almost\" a classifying space for Out(Fn) and it can be thought of as a classifying space over Q. Moreover, Out(Fn) is known to be virtually torsion-free, so for any torsion-free subgroup H of Out(Fn) the action of H on Xn is discrete and free, so that Xn/H is a classifying space for H. For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining homological and cohomological information about Out(Fn). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved that Out(Fn) has virtual cohomological dimension 2n − 3.\n\nIn their 1986 paper Culler and Vogtmann do not assign Xn a specific name. According to Vogtmann,Karen Vogtmann, Automorphisms of free groups and Outer space.  Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 94 (2002), pp. 1–31; Quote from p. 3: \"Peter Shalen later invented the name Outer space for Xn\". the term Outer space for the complex Xn was later coined by Peter Shalen. In subsequent years the Outer space became a central object in the study of Out(Fn). In particular, the Outer space has a natural compactification, similar to Thurston's compactification of the Teichmüller space, and studying the action of Out(Fn) on this compactification yields interesting information about dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups.M. Bestvina, M. Feighn, M. Handel, Laminations, trees, and irreducible automorphisms of free groups. Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 7  (1997),  no. 2, 215–244Gilbert Levitt and Martin Lustig, Irreducible automorphisms of Fn have north-south dynamics on compactified Outer space.

Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure (4), vol. 33 (2000), no. 4, 433–465.\n\nMuch of Vogtmann's subsequent work concerned the study of the Outer space Xn, particularly its homotopy, homological and cohomological properties, and related questions for Out(Fn). For example, Hatcher and VogtmannAllen Hatcher, and Karen Vogtmann. Cerf theory for graphs.  Journal of the London Mathematical Society (2), vol. 58 (1998), no. 3, pp. 633–655.A. Hatcher, and K.

Geometry & Topology, vol. 8 (2004), pp. 1471–1499 Vogtmann explored the connection found by Maxim Kontsevich between the cohomology of certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and the homology of Out(Fn).\n\nA 2001 paper of Vogtmann, joint with Billera and Holmes, used the ideas of geometric group theory and CAT(0) geometry to study the space of phylogenetic trees, that is trees showing possible evolutionary relationships between different species.Louis J. Billera, Susan P. Holmes, and Karen Vogtmann. Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees. Advances in Applied Mathematics, vol. 27 (2001), no. 4, pp. 733–767  Identifying precise evolutionary trees is an important basic problem in mathematical biology and one also needs to have good quantitative tools for estimating how accurate a particular evolutionary tree is. The paper of Billera, Vogtmann and Holmes produced a method for quantifying the difference between two evolutionary trees, effectively determining the distance between them.Julie Rehmeyer. A Grove of Evolutionary Trees. Science News. May 10, 2007. Accessed November 28, 2008 The fact that the space of phylogenetic trees has \"non-positively curved geometry\", particularly the uniqueness of shortest paths or geodesics in CAT(0) spaces, allows using these results for practical statistical computations of estimating the confidence level of how accurate particular evolutionary tree is. A free software package implementing these algorithms has been developed and is actively used by biologists.\n\nSelected works\n \n\nSee also\nGeometric group theory\nTeichmüller space\nMapping class group\nTrain track map\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nKaren Vogtmann's webpage at Cornell University\n\nCornell Topology Festival\n\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:American women mathematicians\nCategory:Topologists\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Cornell University faculty\nCategory:1949 births\nCategory:University of California, Berkeley alumni\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:University of Michigan faculty\nCategory:Academics of the University of Warwick\nCategory:20th-century women mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century women mathematicians"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler",
      "text": "Boris Weisfeiler (born 1941 – disappeared 1985) was a Soviet-born mathematician and professor at Penn State University who lived in the United States before disappearing in Chile in 1985. Declassified US documents suggest a Chilean army patrol seized Weisfeiler and took him to Colonia Dignidad, a secretive Germanic agricultural commune set up in Chile in the 1960s.  The Chilean Pinochet military dictatorship alleged that he drowned. He is known for the Weisfeiler filtration, Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm, and Kac–Weisfeiler conjectures.\n \nWeisfeiler, a Jew, was born in the Soviet Union.  He received his Ph.D. in 1970 from the Steklov Institute of Mathematics Leningrad Department, as a student of Ernest Vinberg.The Mathematics Genealogy Project – Èrnest Vinberg In the early 1970s, Weisfeiler was asked to sign a letter against a colleague, and for his refusal was branded \"anti-Soviet\". Weisfeiler left the Soviet Union in 1975 to be free to advance his career and practice his religion. After a brief period under Armand Borel at the Institute for Advanced Study, near Princeton University, Weisfeiler became a professor at Pennsylvania State University. In 1981, he was naturalized as an American citizen.\n\nWeisfeiler's research spanned twenty years, and he published three dozen research papers during his lifetime. According to his colleague Alexander Lubotzky, Weisfeiler was studying \"the more difficult questions\" of algebraic groups in \"the case when the field is not algebraically closed and the groups do not split or—even worse—are nonisotropic\". He is known for the Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm, the Kac–Weisfeiler conjectures, the Weisfeiler filtration, and work on strong approximation and on finite linear groups.\n\nWeisfeiler, an experienced outdoorsman, flew to Chile at Christmastime of 1984 to hike alone in the Chilean Andes.\n\n Disappearance \nChile was then under a military dictatorship headed by General Augusto Pinochet, which committed numerous human rights abuses (before he died in 2006, Pinochet had been prosecuted for his role in Operation Colombo and indicted in absentia in other countries). After the effective end of military rule, in 1990, the Chilean government took steps to investigate additional activities under the Pinochet regime.\n\nAccording to Chilean governmental reports, Weisfeiler was hiking near the border of the Colonia at the time of his disappearance.  Various actual or supposed eyewitnesses' conflicting reports make the details of the disappearance impossible to discern.  The Chilean government has ruled that Weisfeiler had entered the confluence of two swift-moving rivers and drowned, his body never to be recovered. Local fishermen say they camped with Boris and gave him directions northward, toward a bridge near the Colonia. Some people claim to have seen his footprints near the river and to have found his backpack and other items (the items may have been sold or destroyed by the Chilean government in the late 1990s, as evidenced by Chilean governmental documents and published news articles).\n\nAlthough no conclusive proof connects the Weisfeiler's disappearance to any entity, some American and Chilean officials do suspect one particular group. Unknown to most of the world, Colonia Dignidad sat on a large tract of land not far from the border with Argentina. Idyllic in appearance, the Colonia was run by German expatriates who included alleged Nazi war criminals and sympathizers. The leader of the Colonia for most of its existence was former Nazi Paul Schäfer. The Colonia had a cult-like atmosphere, in which many children were molested, a crime for which its leaders have faced prosecution; Schäfer himself was convicted in May 2006, in connection with allegations of child abuse at the Colonia. The BBC has reported and Chilean governmental documents suggestOfficial website for Boris Weisfeiler that the Chilean Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (the secret police, which was disbanded in 1977) brought suspected anti-government prisoners there to be interrogated.\n\nAccording to United States Department of State reports, other witnesses claim they saw Boris Weisfeiler in the Colonia, several years after his disappearance. At least one claims he was alive some three years later; another claims he was assassinated as a Soviet or Jewish spy. Weisfeiler's whereabouts remain unknown, and his sister Olga, who, like her brother, emigrated to the United States, continues to petition numerous authorities to determine his fate.  Early in 2006, a bipartisan Congressional letter signed by 27 senators and representatives was delivered to Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in the hope of speeding an official Chilean investigation into his fate.\n\nOn August 21, 2012, a Chilean judge ordered the arrest of eight retired police and military officers in connection with the alleged kidnapping and disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler. According to the court filings, the suspects were to have been prosecuted for \"aggravated kidnapping\" and \"complicity\" in the disappearance of a U.S. citizen between January 3–5, 1985; the filings did not mention where Weisfeiler might have been taken after his detention or what may have happened to him afterwards. The case was closed in 2016, after the judge ruled the disappearance to be a common crime (for which the statute of limitations had passed), not a violation of human rights.\n\nables published by WikiLeaks (e.g. 05SANTIAGO2539, 08SANTIAGO93) mention Weisfeiler. One is 09SANTIAGO680, which says:\n\nIn other media and popular culture\nA short film, The Colony, based on Weisfeiler's disappearance and directed by Steven List, was released in 2007.\n\nSee also\n List of people who disappeared\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website for Boris Weisfeiler\n\nCategory:1941 births\nCategory:1980s missing person cases\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:American people of Russian-Jewish descent\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Missing people\nCategory:Missing person cases in Chile\nCategory:Pennsylvania State University faculty\nCategory:People from Pennsylvania\nCategory:People killed in Operation Condor\nCategory:Victims of human rights abuses"

      "text": " was a Japanese mathematician.  Above all, he is famous for discoveringLee and Parker, The Yamabe Problem, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 17 (1987), no. 1, 37–91. that every conformal class on a smooth compact manifold is represented by a Riemannian metric of constant scalar curvature. Other notable contributions include his definitive solution of Hilbert's fifth problem.According to : however, the question is still debated since in the literature there have been other such claims, largely based on different interpretations of Hilbert's statement of the problem given by various researchers. For a review of recent claims (however completely ignoring the contributions of Yamabe) and for a new one, see . For a general review, including an historical sketch dealing with all contributors, see the Hilbert's fifth problem entry.\n\nLife\nHidehiko Yamabe was born on August 22, 1923 in the city of Ashiya, belonging to the Hyōgo Prefecture, the sixth son of Takehiko and Rei Yamabe.The content of this section is largely based on the commemoration by . After completing the Senior High School in September 1944, he joined Tokyo University as a student of the Department of Mathematics and graduated in September 1947: his doctoral advisor was Shokichi Iyanaga. He was then associated with the Department of Mathematics at Osaka University until June 1956, even  while employed by the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. Shortly before coming to the United States of America, Yamabe married his wife Etsuko, and by 1956 they had two daughters. Yamabe died suddenly of a stroke in November 1960,According to , who also reports that Yamabe precisely suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage. just months after accepting a full professorship at Northwestern University.\n\nAcademic career\nAfter graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1947, Yamabe became an assistant at Osaka University. From 1952 until 1954 he was an assistant at Princeton University, receiving his Ph.D. from Osaka University while at Princeton. He left Princeton in 1954 to become assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. Except for one year as a professor at Osaka University, he stayed in Minnesota until 1960. Yamabe died suddenly of a stroke in November 1960,According to , who also refers that he precisely suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage. just months after accepting a full professorship at Northwestern University.\n\nThe Yamabe Memorial Lecture and the Yamabe Symposium\nAfter coming back to Japan, Etsuko Yamabe and her daughters lived with the benefits of Hidehiko's social security and of funds raised privately by her and her husband's friends in the United States of America.According to the University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008 p. 6). When she had achieved some financial stability, it was her wish to return the kindness shown to her in a time of great need by setting up funds for an annual lecture, to be alternatively held at Northwestern and Minnesota University: the Yamabe Memorial Lecture was so established, and was able to attract distinguished lecturers as Eugenio Calabi.According to the University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008 p. 7). Further funding permitted the expansion of the lecture to the present state bi-annual Yamabe Symposium.According to the University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008 p. 7): see also the brief historical sketch \"History of the Yamabe Memorial Symposium\" at the Symposium web page.\n\nWork\n\nResearch activity\nYamabe published eighteen papers on various mathematical topics:.According to . These have been collected and published as a book, edited by Ralph Philip Boas, Jr. for Gordon and Breach Science Publishers.See .\n\nHalf of Yamabe's papers concern  the theory of Lie groups and related topics. However, he is best known today for his remarkable posthumous paper, \"On a deformation of Riemannian structures on compact manifolds,\" Osaka Math. J. 12 (1960) 21–37. This paper claims to prove that any Riemannian metric on any compact manifold without boundary is conformal to  another metric for which the scalar curvature is constant. This assertion, which naturally generalizes the uniformization of Riemann surfaces to arbitrary dimensions,  is completely correct, as is the broad outline  of Yamabe's proof. However, Yamabe's argument contains a subtle analytic mistake arising form  the failure  of certain natural inclusions of Sobolev spaces to be compact. This mistake was only corrected in stages, on a case-by-case basis, first by Trudinger (\"Remarks Concerning the Conformal Deformation of Metrics to Constant Scalar Curvature\", Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa 22 (1968) 265–274), then by Aubin (Équations Différentielles Non Linéaires et Problème de Yamabe, J. Math. Pures Appl. 9: 55 (1976) 269–296), and finally, in full generality,  by Schoen (\"Conformal Deformation of a Riemannian Metric to Constant Scalar Curvature,\"  Journal of Differential Geometry 20 (1984) 478-495). Yamabe's visionary paper thereby became  a cornerstone of modern Riemannnian geometry, and  is thus largely responsible for his posthumous fame. For example, as of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet records 186 citations of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal, compared with only 148 citations of all of his other publications combined.\nAs of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet also lists 997 reviews containing the word \"Yamabe.\" This, of course, is notably larger than the number of papers that  explicitly cite any of Yamabe's articles. However, the vast majority of these reviews contain one of the phrases  \"scalar curvature\" or \"Yamabe equation,\" referring to Yamabe's equation  governing the behavior of the scalar curvature under conformal rescaling. In this sense, the influence of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal has become such a universal fixture of current mathematical thought that it is often implicitly referred to without an explicit citation.\n\nPublications\n\nSee also\nHilbert's fifth problem\nYamabe flow\nYamabe invariant\nYamabe problem\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n.

Hans had two brothers, Guenther and Wilfred, and sister Hiltgunt, who wrote an autobiography in 1974. According to her, their father lost his position as school principal due to his philosophy. She wrote:Hiltgunt Zassenhaus (1974) Walls: Resisting the Third Reich, Beacon Press\nHans, my eldest brother, studied mathematics. My brothers Guenther and Wilfred were in medical school. ... only students who participated in Nazi activities would get scholarships. That left us out. Together we made an all-out effort. ... soon our house became a beehive. Day in and day out for the next four years a small army of children of all ages would arrive to be tutored.\n\nAt the University of Hamburg Zassenhaus came under the influence of Emil Artin. As he wrote later:\nHis introductory course in analysis that I attended at the age of 17 converted me from a theoretical physicist to a mathematician.\n\nWhen just 21, Zassenhaus was studying composition series in group theory.  He proved his butterfly lemma that provides a refinement of two normal chains to isomorphic central chains. Inspired by Artin, Zassenhaus wrote a textbook Lehrbuch der Gruppentheorie that was later translated as Theory of Groups.\nHis thesis was on doubly transitive permutation groups with Frobenius groups as stabilizers. These groups are now called Zassenhaus groups. They have had a deep impact on the classification of finite simple groups.\nHe obtained his doctorate in June 1934, and took the teachers’ exam the next May. He became a scientific assistant at University of Rostock. In 1936 he became assistant to Artin back in Hamburg, but Artin departed for the USA the following year. Zassenhaus gave his Habilitation in 1938.\n\nAccording to his sister Hiltgunt, Hans was \"called up as a research scientist at a weather station\" for his part in the German war effort.\n\nZassenhaus married Lieselotte Lohmann in 1942. The couple raised three children: Michael (born 1943), Angela (born 1947), and Peter (born 1949). In 1943 Zassenhaus became extraordinary professor. He became Managing Director of the Hamburg Mathematical Seminar.\n\nAfter the war, and as a fellow of the British Council, Zassenhaus visited University of Glasgow in 1948. There he was given an honorary Master of Arts degree. The following year he joined the faculty of McGill University where the endowments of Peter Redpath financed a professorship. He was at McGill for a decade with leaves of absence to Institute for Advanced Study (55/6) and California Institute of Technology (58/9). There he was using computers to advance number theory. In 1959 Zassenhaus began teaching at University of Notre Dame and became director of its computing center in 1964.\n\nZassenhaus was a Mershon visiting professor at Ohio State University in the fall of 1963. In 1965 he came to Ohio State permanently. The mathematics department was led by Arnold Ross; Zassenhaus found a home there until his retirement in 1982. Nonetheless, he continued to take leaves of absence for visits to Göttingen (summer 67), Heidelberg (summer 69), UCLA (fall 70), Warwick (fall 72), CIT (74/5), U Montreal (77/8), Saarbrücken (79/80).\n\nHe served as editor in chief of the Journal of Number Theory from its first issue in 1967. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1968.\n\nHans Zassenhaus died in Columbus, Ohio on November 21, 1991.

Her contributions were honored with the 1990 Noether Lecture.  She served as President of the Association for Women in Mathematics from 1981 to 1983.  She earned her Ph.D. in physics in 1959 with her dissertation Problems on Modular Representations of Finite Groups under J. A. Green at the University of Manchester.  She currently is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  She has had five doctoral students.  She has co-authored a number of papers with Paul Fong in modular representation theory and Deligne–Lusztig theory.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSrinivasan was born in Madras,India. She attended the University of Madras, where she earned her bachelor of arts degree in 1954 and her master of science degree in 1955. She traveled to England for her doctoral study. She remained in England to commence her professional academic career as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Keele from 1960 through 1964. She then pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia through the National research Council of Canada from 1965 through 1966.She returned home to India to teach at the Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics of her Alma mater, the University of Madras, from 1966 though 1970.\n\nCareer\nSrinivasan then immigrated to the United States, where she taught for the next decade at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, as an associate professor. In 1977, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. That year, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. In 1980, she commenced her longstanding tenure at the University of Illinois as a professor of mathematics at the Chicago Circle campus.\n\nSrinivasan has distinguished herself in her field throughout her career. In January, 1979, she delivered the Invited Address to the American Mathematical Society(AMS)url=http://www.ams.org/home/page at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in Biloxi, Mississippi. She has also been invited to fill visiting professorships internationally at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, the University of Essen in Germany, Sydney University,and the Science University of Tokyo in Japan. She has served as an editor for several journals in her field: Proceedings of the AMS (from 1983 through 1987); Communications in Algebra (from 1978 through 1984); Mathematical Surveys and Monographs (from 1991 through 1993). From 1991 through 1994, she served on the Editorial Boards Committee of the AMS.\n\nSrinivasan collaborated with Paul Fong on finite groups of the Lie type, and this work has been linked to Lusztig's research on quantum groups, thus crossing over between mathematics and physics. Although Srinivasan generally advocates pure mathematical research, resisting the temptation to find a practical application for all mathematics, she nevertheless got excited by the application of her research to physics.\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-07-26.

      "text": "The Abel Prize  () is a Norwegian prize awarded annually by the King of Norway to one or more outstanding mathematicians. It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829) and directly modeled after the Nobel Prizes. It comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian Kroner (NOK) (€620,000 or $700,000).\n\nThe Abel Prize's history dates back to 1899, when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie when he learned that Alfred Nobel's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. In 1902 King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway indicated his willingness to finance a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes, but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001, and it was specifically intended \"to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize.\" The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee, the members of which are appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\nThe award ceremony takes place in the Aula of the University of Oslo, where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded between 1947 and 1989. The Abel Prize board has also established an Abel symposium, administered by the Norwegian Mathematical Society.\n\nHistory\n\nThe prize was first proposed in 1899, to be part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Niels Henrik Abel's birth in 1802. Shortly before his death in 1899, the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie proposed establishing an Abel Prize when he learned that Alfred Nobel's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. King Oscar II was willing to finance a mathematics prize in 1902, and the mathematicians Ludwig Sylow and Carl Størmer drew up statutes and rules for the proposed prize. However, Lie's influence waned after his death, and the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway in 1905 ended the first attempt to create an Abel Prize.\n\nthumb|The prize is awarded in the aula of the Domus Media building of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, where the Nobel Peace Prize was formerly awarded\n\nAfter interest in the concept of the prize had risen in 2001, a working group was formed to develop a proposal, which was presented to the Prime Minister of Norway in May. In August 2001, the Norwegian government announced that the prize would be awarded beginning in 2002, the two-hundredth anniversary of Abel's birth. Atle Selberg received an honorary Abel Prize in 2002, but the first actual Abel Prize was awarded in 2003.\n\nA book series presenting Abel Prize laureates and their research was commenced in 2010. The first two volumes cover the years 2003–2007 and 2008–2012 respectively.\n\nIn 2019 Karen Uhlenbeck became the first woman to win the Abel Prize, with the award committee citing “the fundamental impact of her work on analysis, geometry and mathematical physics.\n\n Selection criteria and funding \nAnyone may submit a nomination for the Abel Prize, however, self-nominations are not permitted. The nominee must be alive; however, if the awardee dies after being declared as the winner, the prize will be awarded posthumously.\n\nThe Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters declares the winner of the Abel Prize each March after recommendation by the Abel Committee, which consists of five leading mathematicians. Both Norwegians and non-Norwegians may serve on the Committee. They are elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and nominated by the International Mathematical Union and the European Mathematical Society. The committee is of 2018 chaired by Norwegian mathematician Hans Munthe-Kaas (University of Bergen), and was before that, headed by Professor John Rognes.\n\n Funding \nThe Norwegian Government gave the prize an initial funding of NOK 200 million (about €21.7 million) in 2001. Previously, the funding came from the Abel foundation, but today the prize is financed directly through the national budget.\n\nThe funding is controlled by the Board, which consists of members elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The current leader of the Board is John Grue.\n\n Laureates \n\n Year Laureate(s) Image Citizenship(s) Institution(s) Citation 2003  100px|alt=Jean-Pierre Serre  Collège de France \"For playing a key role in shaping the modern form of many parts of mathematics, including topology, algebraic geometry and number theory.\" 2004  100px|alt=Michael Atiya   University of Edinburgh \"For their discovery and proof of the index theorem, bringing together topology, geometry and analysis, and their outstanding role in building new bridges between mathematics and theoretical physics.\"  100px|alt=Isadore Singer   Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyUniversity of California, Berkeley 2005  100px|alt=Peter Lax  /   Courant Institute \"For his groundbreaking contributions to the theory and application of partial differential equations and to the computation of their solutions.\" 2006  100px|alt=Lennart Carleson  Royal Institute of Technology \"For his profound and seminal contributions to harmonic analysis and the theory of smooth dynamical systems.\" 2007  100px|alt=S.

      "text": "In mathematics, the Abel transform,N. H. Abel, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 1, pp. 153-157 (1826) named for Niels Henrik Abel, is an integral transform often used in the analysis of spherically symmetric or axially symmetric functions. The Abel transform of a function f(r) is given by:\n\nAssuming f(r) drops to zero more quickly than 1/r, the inverse Abel transform is given by\n\nIn image analysis, the forward Abel transform is used to project an optically thin, axially symmetric emission function onto a plane, and the reverse Abel transform is used to calculate the emission function given a projection (i.e. a scan or a photograph) of that emission function.\n\nIn absorption spectroscopy of cylindrical flames or plumes, the forward Abel transform is the integrated absorbance along a ray with closest distance y from the center of the flame, while the inverse Abel transform gives the local absorption coefficient at a distance r from the center. Abel transform is limited to applications with axially symmetric geometries. For more general asymmetrical cases, more general-oriented reconstruction algorithms such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithms should be employed.\n\nIn recent years, the inverse Abel transformation (and its variants) has become the cornerstone of data analysis in photofragment-ion imaging and photoelectron imaging. Among recent most notable extensions of inverse Abel transformation are the Onion Peeling and Basis Set Expansion (BASEX) methods of photoelectron and photoion image analysis.\n\n Geometrical interpretation \n\nthumb|right|256px|A geometrical interpretation of the Abel transform in two dimensions. An observer (I) looks along a line parallel to the x-axis a distance y above the origin. What the observer sees is the projection (i.e. the integral) of the circularly symmetric function f(r) along the line of sight. The function f(r) is represented in gray in this figure. The observer is assumed to be located infinitely far from the origin so that the limits of integration are ±∞\n\nIn two dimensions, the Abel transform F(y) can be interpreted as the projection of a circularly symmetric function f(r) along a set of parallel lines of sight which are a distance y from the origin. Referring to the figure on the right, the observer (I) will see\n\nwhere f(r) is the circularly symmetric function represented by the gray color in the figure. It is assumed that the observer is actually at x = ∞ so that the limits of integration are ±∞ and all lines of sight are parallel to the x-axis.\nRealizing that the radius r is related to x and y via r2 = x2 + y2, it follows that\n\nfor x>0. Since f(r) is an even function in x, we may write:\n\nwhich yields the Abel transform of f(r).\n\nThe Abel transform may be extended to higher dimensions. Of particular interest is the extension to three dimensions. If we have an axially symmetric function f(ρ,z)\nwhere ρ2 = x2 + y2 is the cylindrical radius, then we may want to know the projection of that function onto a plane parallel to the z axis. Without loss of generality, we can take that plane to be the yz-plane so that\n\nwhich is just the Abel transform of f(ρ,z) in ρ and y.\n\nA particular type of axial symmetry is spherical symmetry. In this case,\nwe have a function f(r) where r2 = x2 + y2 + z2.\nThe projection onto, say, the yz-plane will then be circularly symmetric and\nexpressible as F(s) where s2 = y2 + z2. Carrying out the integration, we have:\n\nwhich is again, the Abel transform of f(r) in r and s.\n\n Verification of the inverse Abel transform \nAssuming  is continuously differentiable and ,  drop to zero faster than , we can set  and . Integration by parts then yields\n\nDifferentiating formally,\n\nNow substitute this into the inverse Abel transform formula:\n\nBy Fubini's theorem, the last integral equals\n\n Generalization of the Abel transform to discontinuous F(y) \n\nConsider the case where  is discontinuous at , where it abruptly changes its value by a finite amount . That is,  and  are defined by . Such a situation is encountered in tethered polymers (Polymer brush) exhibiting a vertical phase separation, where  stands for the polymer density profile and  is related to the spatial distribution of terminal, non-tethered monomers of the polymers.\n\nThe Abel transform of a function f(r) is under these circumstances again given by:\n\nAssuming f(r) drops to zero more quickly than 1/r, the inverse Abel transform is however given by\n\nwhere  is the Dirac delta function and  the Heaviside step function. The extended version of the Abel transform for discontinuous F is proven upon applying the Abel transform to shifted, continuous , and it reduces to the classical Abel transform when . If  has more than a single discontinuity, one has to introduce shifts for any of them to come up with a generalized version of the inverse Abel transform which contains n additional terms, each of them corresponding to one of the n discontinuities.\n\n Relationship to other integral transforms \n\n Relationship to the Fourier and Hankel transforms \nThe Abel transform is one member of the FHA cycle of integral operators. For example, in two dimensions, if we define A as the Abel transform operator, F as the Fourier transform operator and H as the zeroth-order Hankel transform operator, then the special case of the Projection-slice theorem for circularly symmetric functions states that:\n\nIn other words, applying the Abel transform to a 1-dimensional function and\nthen applying the Fourier transform to that result is the same as applying\nthe Hankel transform to that function. This concept can be extended to higher\ndimensions.\n\n Relationship to the Radon transform \n\nAbel transform can be viewed as the Radon transform of an isotropic 2D function f(r). As f(r) is isotropic, its Radon transform is the same at different angles of the viewing axis. Thus, the Abel transform is a function of the distance along the viewing axis only.\n\n See also \n GPS radio occultation\n\n References \n\n \n\n External links \n\nCategory:Integral transforms\nCategory:Image processing\nCategory:Niels Henrik Abel"

      "title": "Abel–Ruffini theorem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem",
      "text": "In algebra, the Abel–Ruffini theorem (also known as Abel's impossibility theorem) states that there is no solution in radicals to general polynomial equations of degree five or higher with arbitrary coefficients. The theorem is named after Paolo Ruffini, who made an incomplete proof in 1799, and Niels Henrik Abel, who provided a proof in 1824.\n\n Interpretation \nThe theorem does not assert that some higher-degree polynomial equations have no solution. In fact, the opposite is true: every non-constant polynomial equation in one unknown, with real or complex coefficients, has at least one complex number as a solution (and thus, by polynomial division, as many complex roots as its degree, counting repeated roots); this is the fundamental theorem of algebra. These solutions can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy using numerical methods such as the Newton–Raphson method or the Laguerre method, and in this way they are no different from solutions to polynomial equations of the second, third, or fourth degrees. It also does not assert that no higher-degree polynomial equations can be solved in radicals: the equation  can be solved in radicals for every positive integer , for example.  The theorem only shows that there is no general solution in radicals that applies to all equations of a given degree greater than 4.\n\nThe solution of any second-degree polynomial equation can be expressed in terms of its coefficients, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots, in the familiar quadratic formula:  the roots of the equation  (with ) are\n\n.\n\nAnalogous formulas for third-degree equations and fourth-degree equations (using square roots and cube roots) have been known since the 16th century. What the Abel–Ruffini theorem says is that there is no similar formula for general equations of fifth degree or higher. In principle, it could be that the equations of the fifth degree could be split in several types and, for each one of these types, there could be some algebraic solution valid within that type.  Or, as Ian Stewart wrote, \"for all that Abel's  methods could prove, every particular quintic equation might be soluble, with a special formula for each equation.\" However, this is not so, but this impossibility is a strictly stronger result than the Abel–Ruffini theorem and is derived with Galois theory.\n\n Proof \nThe following proof is based on Galois theory and it is valid for any field of characteristic 0. Historically, Ruffini and Abel's proofs precede Galois theory. For a modern presentation of Abel's proof see the article of Rosen or the books of Tignol or Pesic.\n\nOne of the fundamental theorems of Galois theory states that a polynomial  is solvable by radicals over  if and only if its splitting field  over  has a solvable Galois group, so the proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem comes down to computing the Galois group of the general polynomial of the fifth degree, and showing that it is not solvable.\n\nConsider five indeterminates , and , let , and let\n\n.\n\nExpanding  out yields the elementary symmetric functions of the :\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\n\nThe coefficient of  in  is thus . Let  be the field obtained by adjoining the symmetric functions to the rationals. Then . Because the 's are indeterminates, every permutation  in the symmetric group on 5 letters  induces a distinct automorphism  on  that leaves  fixed and permutes the elements . Since an arbitrary rearrangement of the roots of the product form still produces the same polynomial, for example,\n\nis the same polynomial as\n\n,\n\nthe automorphisms  also leave  fixed, so they are elements of the Galois group .  Therefore, we have shown that ; however there could possibly be automorphisms there that are not in . But, since the Galois group of the splitting field of a quintic polynomial has at most  elements, and since  is a splitting field of , it follows that  is isomorphic to .  Generalizing this argument shows that the Galois group of every general polynomial of degree  is isomorphic to .\n\nThe only composition series of  is  (where  is the alternating group on five letters, also known as the icosahedral group). However, the quotient group  (isomorphic to  itself) is not abelian, and so  is not solvable, so it must be that the general polynomial of the fifth degree has no solution in radicals.  Since the first nontrivial normal subgroup of the symmetric group on  letters is always the alternating group on  letters, and since the alternating groups on  letters for  are always simple and non-abelian, and hence not solvable, it also says that the general polynomials of all degrees higher than the fifth also have no solution in radicals. Q.E.D.\n\nThe above construction of the Galois group for a fifth degree polynomial only applies to the general polynomial; specific polynomials of the fifth degree may have different Galois groups with quite different properties, for example,  has a splitting field generated by a primitive 5th root of unity, and hence its Galois group is abelian and the equation itself solvable by radicals; moreover, the argument does not provide any rational-valued quintic that has  or  as its Galois group.  However, since the result is on the general polynomial, it does say that a general “quintic formula” for the roots of a quintic using only a finite combination of the arithmetic operations and radicals in terms of the coefficients is impossible.\n\nThe proof is not valid if applied to polynomials whose degree is less than 5. Indeed:\n the group  is not simple, because the subgroup , isomorphic to the Klein four-group, is a normal subgroup;\n the groups  and  are simple, but since they are abelian too ( is the trivial group and  is the cyclic group of order 3), that is not a problem.\n\nThe proof remains valid if, instead of working with five indeterminates, one works with five concrete algebraically independent complex numbers, because, by the same argument, .\n\n History \nAround 1770, Joseph Louis Lagrange began the groundwork that unified the many different tricks that had been used up to that point to solve equations, relating them to the theory of groups of permutations, in the form of Lagrange resolvents. This innovative work by Lagrange was a precursor to Galois theory, and its failure to develop solutions for equations of fifth and higher degrees hinted that such solutions might be impossible, but it did not provide conclusive proof. The first person who conjectured that the problem of solving quintics by radicals might be impossible to solve was Carl Friedrich Gauss, who wrote in 1798 in section 359 of his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (which would be published only in 1801) that “there is little doubt that this problem does not so much defy modern methods of analysis as that it proposes the impossible”. The next year, in his thesis, he wrote “After the labors of many geometers left little hope of ever arriving at the resolution of the general equation algebraically, it appears more and more likely that this resolution is impossible and contradictory.” And he added “Perhaps it will not be so difficult to prove, with all rigor, the impossibility for the fifth degree. I shall set forth my investigations of this at greater length in another place.” Actually, Gauss published nothing else on this subject.\nthumb|Paolo Ruffini, Teoria generale delle equazioni, 1799\n\nThe theorem was first nearly proved by Paolo Ruffini in 1799. He sent his proof to several mathematicians to get it acknowledged, amongst them Lagrange (who did not reply) and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who sent him a letter saying: “Your memoir on the general solution of equations is a work which I have always believed should be kept in mind by mathematicians and which, in my opinion, proves conclusively the algebraic unsolvability of general equations of higher than fourth degree.” However, in general, Ruffini's proof was not considered convincing. Abel wrote: “The first and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Ruffini. But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difficult to determine the validity of his argument.  It seems to me that his argument is not completely satisfying.”\n\nThe proof also, as it was discovered later, was incomplete. Ruffini assumed that all radicals that he was dealing with could be expressed from the roots of the polynomial using field operations alone; in modern terms, he assumed that the radicals belonged to the splitting field of the polynomial. To see why this is really an extra assumption, consider, for instance, the polynomial . According to Cardano's formula, one of its roots (all of them, actually) can be expressed as the sum of a cube root of  with a cube root of . On the other hand, since , , , and , the roots , , and  of  are all real and therefore the field  is a subfield of . But then the numbers  cannot belong to . While Cauchy either did not notice Ruffini's assumption or felt that it was a minor one, most historians believe that the proof was not complete until Abel proved the theorem on natural irrationalities, which asserts that the assumption holds in the case of general polynomials. The Abel–Ruffini theorem is thus generally credited to Abel, who published a proof in just six pages in 1824. However, this short number of pages was obtained at the cost of writing in a very terse style. This was due to the fact that he had the proof printed at his own expenses and he needed to save paper and money. A more elaborated version of the proof would be published in 1826.\n\nProving that the general quintic (and higher) equations were unsolvable by radicals did not completely settle the matter, because the Abel–Ruffini theorem does not provide necessary and sufficient conditions for saying precisely which quintic (and higher) equations are unsolvable by radicals. Abel was working on a complete characterization when he died in 1829.\n\nAccording to Nathan Jacobson, “The proofs of Ruffini and of Abel […] were soon superseded by the crowning achievement of this line of research: Galois' discoveries in the theory of equations.” In 1830, Galois (at the age of 18) submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences a memoir on his theory of solvability by radicals, which was ultimately rejected in 1831 as being too sketchy and for giving a condition in terms of the roots of the equation instead of its coefficients. Galois was aware of the contributions of Ruffini and Abel, since he wrote “It is a common truth, today, that the general equation of degree greater than  cannot be solved by radicals… this truth has become common (by hearsay) despite the fact that geometers  have ignored the proofs of Abel and Ruffini…”  Galois then died in 1832 and his paper Mémoire sur les conditions de resolubilité des équations par radicaux remained unpublished until 1846, when it was published by Joseph Liouville accompanied by some of his own explanations. Prior to this publication, Liouville announced Galois' result to the Academy in a speech he gave on 4 July 1843. A simplification of Abel's proof was published by Pierre Wantzel in 1845. When he published it, he was already aware of the contributions by Galois and he mentions that, whereas Abel's proof is valid only for general polynomials, Galois' approach can be used to provide a concrete polynomial of degree 5 whose roots cannot be expressed in radicals from its coefficients.\n\nIn 1963, Vladimir Arnold discovered a topological proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which served as a starting point for topological Galois theory.\n\n Notes \n\nCategory:Solvable groups\nCategory:Theorems in algebra\nCategory:Galois theory\nCategory:Polynomials\nCategory:Articles containing proofs\nCategory:Niels Henrik Abel"

The identity is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.\n\nSince Abel's identity relates the different linearly independent solutions of the differential equation, it can be used to find one solution from the other. It provides useful identities relating the solutions, and is also useful as a part of other techniques such as the method of variation of parameters. It is especially useful for equations such as Bessel's equation where the solutions do not have a simple analytical form, because in such cases the Wronskian is difficult to compute directly.\n\nA generalisation to first-order systems of homogeneous linear differential equations is given by Liouville's formula.\n\nStatement\nConsider a homogeneous linear second-order ordinary differential equation\n\n \n\non an interval I of the real line with real- or complex-valued continuous functions p and q. Abel's identity states that the Wronskian  of two real- or complex-valued solutions  and  of this differential equation, that is the function defined by the determinant\n\n \n\nsatisfies the relation\n\n \n\nfor every point x0 in I, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nRemarks\n In particular, the Wronskian  is either always the zero function or always different from zero with the same sign at every point  in . In the latter case, the two solutions  and  are linearly independent (see that article about the Wronskian for a proof).\n It is not necessary to assume that the second derivatives of the solutions  and  are continuous.\n Abel's theorem is particularly useful if , because it implies that W=const.\n\nProof\nDifferentiating the Wronskian using the product rule gives (writing  for  and omitting the argument  for brevity)\n\n \n\nSolving for  in the original differential equation yields\n\n \n\nSubstituting this result into the derivative of the Wronskian function to replace the second derivatives of  and  gives\n \n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation, and it remains to show that Abel's identity gives the unique solution, which attains the value  at . Since the function  is continuous on , it is bounded on every closed and bounded subinterval of  and therefore integrable, hence\n\nis a well-defined function. Differentiating both sides, using the product rule, the chain rule, the derivative of the exponential function and the fundamental theorem of calculus, one obtains\n\ndue to the differential equation for . Therefore,  has to be constant on , because otherwise we would obtain a contradiction to the mean value theorem (applied separately to the real and imaginary part in the complex-valued case).

It suffices to show that the Wronskian solves the first-order linear differential equation\n\nbecause the remaining part of the proof then coincides with the one for the case .\n\nIn the case  we have  and the differential equation for  coincides with the one for . Therefore, assume  in the following.\n\nThe derivative of the Wronskian  is the derivative of the defining determinant. It follows from the Leibniz formula for determinants that this derivative can be calculated by differentiating every row separately, hence\n\n \n\nHowever, note that every determinant from the expansion contains a pair of identical rows, except the last one. Since determinants with linearly dependent rows are equal to 0, one is only left with the last one:\n\n \n\nSince every  solves the ordinary differential equation, we have\n\n \n\nfor every . Hence, adding to the last row of the above determinant  times its first row,  times its second row, and so on until  times its next to last row, the value of the determinant for the derivative of  is unchanged and we get\n\n \n\nProof using Liouville's formula\nThe solutions  form the square-matrix valued solution\n\nof the -dimensional first-order system of homogeneous linear differential equations\n\nThe trace of this matrix is , hence Abel's identity follows directly from Liouville's formula.\n\nReferences\n\n Abel, N.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category",
      "text": "In mathematics, an abelian category is a category in which morphisms and objects can be added and in which kernels and cokernels exist and have desirable properties. The motivating prototype example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups, Ab. The theory originated in an effort to unify several cohomology theories by Alexander Grothendieck and independently in the slightly earlier work of David Buchsbaum. Abelian categories are very stable categories; for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma. The class of Abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of chain complexes of an Abelian category, or the category of functors from a small category to an Abelian category are Abelian as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in homological algebra and beyond; the theory has major applications in algebraic geometry, cohomology and pure category theory. Abelian categories are named after Niels Henrik Abel.\n\nDefinitions\nA category is abelian if\nit has a zero object,\nit has all binary biproducts,\nit has all kernels and cokernels, and\nall monomorphisms and epimorphisms are normal.\n\nThis definition is equivalentPeter Freyd, Abelian Categories to the following \"piecemeal\" definition:\n A category is preadditive if it is enriched over the monoidal category Ab of abelian groups. This means that all hom-sets are abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is bilinear. \n A preadditive category is additive if every finite set of objects has a biproduct. This means that we can form finite direct sums and direct products. In Handbook of categorical algebra, vol. 2, F. Borceux Def. 1.2.6, it is required that an additive category has a zero object (empty biproduct).\n An additive category is preabelian if every morphism has both a kernel and a cokernel.\n Finally, a preabelian category is abelian if every monomorphism and every epimorphism is normal. This means that every monomorphism is a kernel of some morphism, and every epimorphism is a cokernel of some morphism.\n\nNote that the enriched structure on hom-sets is a consequence of the first three axioms of the first definition. This highlights the foundational relevance of the category of Abelian groups in the theory and its canonical nature.\n\nThe concept of exact sequence arises naturally in this setting, and it turns out that exact functors, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between Abelian categories. This exactness concept has been axiomatized in the theory of exact categories, forming a very special case of regular categories.\n\nExamples\n As mentioned above, the category of all abelian groups is an abelian category. The category of all finitely generated abelian groups is also an abelian category, as is the category of all finite abelian groups.\n If R is a ring, then the category of all left (or right) modules over R is an abelian category. In fact, it can be shown that any small abelian category is equivalent to a full subcategory of such a category of modules (Mitchell's embedding theorem).\n If R is a left-noetherian ring, then the category of finitely generated left modules over R is abelian. In particular, the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian commutative ring is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in commutative algebra.\n As special cases of the two previous examples: the category of vector spaces over a fixed field k is abelian, as is the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over k.\n If X is a topological space, then the category of all (real or complex) vector bundles on X is not usually an abelian category, as there can be monomorphisms that are not kernels.\n If X is a topological space, then the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on X is an abelian category. More generally, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a Grothendieck site is an abelian category. In this way, abelian categories show up in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n If C is a small category and A is an abelian category, then the category of all functors from C to A forms an abelian category. If C is small and preadditive, then the category of all additive functors from C to A also forms an abelian category. The latter is a generalization of the R-module example, since a ring can be understood as a preadditive category with a single object.\n\nGrothendieck's axioms\nIn his Tōhoku article, Grothendieck listed four additional axioms (and their duals) that an abelian category A might satisfy. These axioms are still in common use to this day. They are the following:\n AB3) For every indexed family (Ai) of objects of A, the coproduct *Ai exists in A (i.e. A is cocomplete).\n AB4) A satisfies AB3), and the coproduct of a family of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.\n AB5) A satisfies AB3), and filtered colimits of exact sequences are exact.\nand their duals\n AB3*) For every indexed family (Ai) of objects of A, the product PAi exists in A (i.e. A is complete).\n AB4*) A satisfies AB3*), and the product of a family of epimorphisms is an epimorphism.\n AB5*) A satisfies AB3*), and filtered limits of exact sequences are exact.\n\nAxioms AB1) and AB2) were also given. They are what make an additive category abelian. Specifically:\n AB1) Every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel.\n AB2) For every morphism f, the canonical morphism from coim f to im f is an isomorphism.\n\nGrothendieck also gave axioms AB6) and AB6*).\n\n AB6) A satisfies AB3), and given a family of filtered categories  and maps , we have , where lim denotes the filtered colimit.\n AB6*) A satisfies AB3*), and given a family of cofiltered categories  and maps , we have , where lim denotes the cofiltered limit.\n\nElementary properties\nGiven any pair A, B of objects in an abelian category, there is a special zero morphism from A to B. This can be defined as the zero element of the hom-set Hom(A,B), since this is an abelian group.\nAlternatively, it can be defined as the unique composition A → 0 → B, where 0 is the zero object of the abelian category.\n\nIn an abelian category, every morphism f can be written as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism.\nThis epimorphism is called the coimage of f, while the monomorphism is called the image of f.\n\nSubobjects and quotient objects are well-behaved in abelian categories.\nFor example, the poset of subobjects of any given object A is a bounded lattice.\n\nEvery abelian category A is a module over the monoidal category of finitely generated abelian groups; that is, we can form a tensor product of a finitely generated abelian group G and any object A of A.\nThe abelian category is also a comodule; Hom(G,A) can be interpreted as an object of A.\nIf A is complete, then we can remove the requirement that G be finitely generated; most generally, we can form finitary enriched limits in A.\n\nRelated concepts\nAbelian categories are the most general setting for homological algebra.\nAll of the constructions used in that field are relevant, such as exact sequences, and especially short exact sequences, and derived functors.\nImportant theorems that apply in all abelian categories include the five lemma (and the short five lemma as a special case), as well as the snake lemma (and the nine lemma as a special case).\n\nSubcategories of abelian categories\nThere are numerous types of (full, additive) subcategories of abelian categories that occur in nature, as well as some conflicting terminology.\n\nLet A be an abelian category, C a full, additive subcategory, and I the inclusion functor.\n C is an exact subcategory if it is itself an exact category and the inclusion I is an exact functor. This occurs if and only if C is closed under pull-backs of epimorphisms and push-outs of monomorphisms. The exact sequences in C are thus the exact sequences in A for which all objects lie in C.\n C is an abelian subcategory if it is itself an abelian category and the inclusion I is an exact functor. This occurs if and only if C is closed under taking kernels and cokernels. Note that there are examples of full subcategories of an abelian category which are themselves abelian but where the inclusion functor is not exact, so they are not abelian subcategories (see below).\n C is a thick subcategory if it is closed under taking direct summands and satisfies the 2-out-of-3 property on short exact sequences; that is, if  is a short exact sequence in A such that two of  lie in C, then so does the third. In other words, C is closed under kernels of epimorphisms, cokernels of monomorphisms, and extensions. Note that P. Gabriel used the term thick subcategory to describe what we here call a Serre subcategory.\n C is a topologizing subcategory if it is closed under subquotients.\n C is a Serre subcategory if, for all short exact sequences  in A we have M in C if and only if both  are in C. In other words, C is closed under extensions and subquotients. These subcategories are precisely the kernels of exact functors from A to another abelian category.\n C is a localizing subcategory if it is a Serre subcategory such that the quotient functor  admits a right adjoint.\n There are two competing notions of a wide subcategory. One version is that C contains every object of A (up to isomorphism); for a full subcategory this is obviously not interesting. (This is also called a lluf subcategory.) The other version is that C is closed under extensions.\n\nHere is an explicit example of a full, additive subcategory of an abelian category which is itself abelian but the inclusion functor is not exact. Let k be a field,  the algebra of upper-triangular  matrices over k, and  the category of finite-dimensional -modules. Then each  is an abelian category and we have an inclusion functor  identifying the simple projective, simple injective and indecomposable projective-injective modules. The essential image of I is a full, additive subcategory, but I is not exact.\n\n History \nAbelian categories were introduced by  (under the name of \"exact category\")  and  in order to unify various cohomology theories. At the time, there was a cohomology theory for sheaves, and a cohomology theory for groups. The two were defined differently, but they had similar properties. In fact, much of category theory was developed as a language to study these similarities. Grothendieck unified the two theories: they both arise as derived functors on abelian categories; the abelian category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and the abelian category of G-modules for a given group G.\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Additive categories\nCategory:Homological algebra\nCategory:Niels Henrik Abel"

      "text": "In abstract algebra, an abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written. That is, these are the groups that obey the axiom of commutativity. Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers. They are named after early 19th century mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.Jacobson 2009, p. 41\n\nThe concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as modules and vector spaces, are developed. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.\n\n Definition \n\nAn abelian group is a set, A, together with an operation • that combines any two elements a and b to form another element denoted . The symbol • is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, , must satisfy five requirements known as the abelian group axioms:\n\nClosure For all a, b in A, the result of the operation  is also in A.\nAssociativity For all a, b and c in A, the equation  holds.\nIdentity element There exists an element e in A, such that for all elements a in A, the equation  holds.\nInverse element For each a in A, there exists an element b in A such that , where e is the identity element.\nCommutativity For all a, b in A, a • b = b • a.\n\nA group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a \"non-abelian group\" or \"non-commutative group\".\n\n Facts \n\n Notation \n\nThere are two main notational conventions for abelian groups – additive and multiplicative.\n\n Convention Operation Identity Powers Inverse Addition x + y  0  nx  −x Multiplication x ⋅ y or xy  e or 1 xn x−1\n\nGenerally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for modules and rings. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being near-rings and partially ordered groups, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.\n\n Multiplication table \nTo verify that a finite group is abelian, a table (matrix) – known as a Cayley table – can be constructed in a similar fashion to a multiplication table. If the group is  under the operation ⋅, the  entry of this table contains the product . The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\nThis is true since if the group is abelian, then . This implies that the  entry of the table equals the  entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\n Examples \n For the integers and the operation addition \"+\", denoted , the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the additive identity, every integer n has an additive inverse, −n, and the addition operation is commutative since  for any two integers m and n.\n Every cyclic group G is abelian, because if x, y are in G, then    . Thus the integers, Z, form an abelian group under addition, as do the integers modulo n, Z/nZ.\n Every ring is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a commutative ring the invertible elements, or units, form an abelian multiplicative group. In particular, the real numbers are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.\n Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal, so each subgroup gives rise to a quotient group. Subgroups, quotients, and direct sums of abelian groups are again abelian. The finite simple abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order.Rose 2012, p. 32\n The concepts of abelian group and Z-module agree.  More specifically, every Z-module is an abelian group with its operation of addition, and every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers Z in a unique way.\n\nIn general, matrices, even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication – one example is the group of 2×2 rotation matrices.\n\n Historical remarks \n\nCamille Jordan named abelian groups after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a polynomial implies that the roots of the polynomial can be calculated by using radicals. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.\n\n Properties \nIf n is a natural number and x is an element of an abelian group G written additively, then nx can be defined as  (n summands) and . In this way, G becomes a module over the ring Z of integers. In fact, the modules over Z can be identified with the abelian groups.\n\nTheorems about abelian groups (i.e. modules over the principal ideal domain Z) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of finitely generated abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form Z/pkZ for p prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of Z.\n\nIf  are two group homomorphisms between abelian groups, then their sum , defined by , is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if H is a non-abelian group.) The set  of all group homomorphisms from G to H thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.\n\nSomewhat akin to the dimension of vector spaces, every abelian group has a rank. It is defined as the maximal cardinality of a set of linearly independent elements of the group. The integers and the rational numbers have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.\n\nThe center Z(G) of a group G is the set of elements that commute with every element of G. A group G is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center Z(G). The center of a group G is always a characteristic abelian subgroup of G. If the quotient group G/Z(G) of a group by its center is cyclic then G is abelian.Rose 2012, p. 48\n\n Finite abelian groups \nCyclic groups of integers modulo n, Z/nZ, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of Georg Frobenius and Ludwig Stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of linear algebra.\n\nAny group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is abelian.Rose 2012, p. 79 In fact, for every prime number p there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order p2, namely Zp2 and Zp×Zp.\n\n Classification \nThe fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group G can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime-power order; it is also known as the basis theorem for finite abelian groups.Kurzweil, H., & Stellmacher, B., The Theory of Finite Groups: An Introduction (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Verlag, 2004), pp. 43–54. This is generalized by the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, with finite groups being the special case when G has zero rank; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.\n\nThe classification was proven by Leopold Kronecker in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by Gauss in 1801; see history for details.\n\nThe cyclic group Zmn of order mn is isomorphic to the direct sum of Zm and Zn if and only if m and n are coprime. It follows that any finite abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form\n\nin either of the following canonical ways:\n the numbers k1, ..., ku are powers of (not necessarily distinct) primes,\n or k1 divides k2, which divides k3, and so on up to ku.\n\nFor example, Z15 can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5:  The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are isomorphic.\n\nFor another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either Z8 (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8),  (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or .\n\nSee also list of small groups for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.\n\n Automorphisms \nOne can apply the fundamental theorem to count (and sometimes determine) the automorphisms of a given finite abelian group G. To do this, one uses the fact that if G splits as a direct sum  of subgroups of coprime order, then .\n\nGiven this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of G it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the Sylow p-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of p). Fix a prime p and suppose the exponents ei of the cyclic factors of the Sylow p-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:\n\nfor some . One needs to find the automorphisms of\n\nOne special case is when n = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow p-subgroup P. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite cyclic group can be used. Another special case is when n is arbitrary but . Here, one is considering P to be of the form\n\nso elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension n over the finite field of p elements Fp. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so\n\nwhere GL is the appropriate general linear group. This is easily shown to have order\n\nIn the most general case, where the ei and n are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines\n\nand\n\nthen one has in particular , , and\n\nOne can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., & Rhea, D.).\n\nFinitely generated abelian groups\n\nAn abelian group  is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called generators)  such that every element of the group is a linear combination with integer coefficients of elements of . \n\nLet  be a free abelian group with basis  \nThere is a unique group homomorphism\n such that \n\nThis homomorphism is surjective, and its kernel is finitely generated (since integers form a Noetherian ring). Consider the matrix  with integer entries, such that the entries of its th column are the coefficients of the th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the cokernel of linear map defined by . Conversely every integer matrix defines a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nIt follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of  is equivalent with multiplying  on the left by a unimodular matrix (that is an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of  is equivalent with multiplying  on the right by an unimodular matrix.\n\nThe Smith normal form of  is a matrix\n\nwhere  and  are unimodular, and  is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries  are the first ones, and  is a divisor of  for . The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group  is the direct sum \n \nwhere  is the number of zero rows at the bottom of  (and also the rank of the group). This is the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nThe existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.\n\n Infinite abelian groups \nThe simplest infinite abelian group is the infinite cyclic group Z. Any finitely generated abelian group A is isomorphic to the direct sum of r copies of Z and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many cyclic groups of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number r, called the rank of A, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.\n\nBy contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. Divisible groups, i.e. abelian groups A in which the equation  admits a solution  for any natural number n and element a of A, constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to Q and Prüfer groups Qp/Zp for various prime numbers p, and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.For example, . Moreover, if a divisible group A is a subgroup of an abelian group G then A admits a direct complement: a subgroup C of G such that . Thus divisible groups are injective modules in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible (Baer's criterion). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called reduced.\n\nTwo important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are torsion groups and torsion-free groups, exemplified by the groups Q/Z (periodic) and Q (torsion-free).\n\n Torsion groups \n\nAn abelian group is called periodic or torsion, if every element has finite order. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second Prüfer theorems state that if A is a periodic group, and it either has a bounded exponent, i.e.,  for some natural number n, or is countable and the p-heights of the elements of A are finite for each p, then A is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.Countability assumption in the second Prüfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the direct product of the cyclic groups Z/pmZ for all natural m is not a direct sum of cyclic groups. The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to Z/pmZ in such a decomposition is an invariant of A. These theorems were later subsumed in the Kulikov criterion. In a different direction, Helmut Ulm found an extension of the second Prüfer theorem to countable abelian p-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their Ulm invariants.\n\n Torsion-free and mixed groups \n\nAn abelian group is called torsion-free if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of torsion-free abelian groups have been studied extensively:\n\n Free abelian groups, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of Z\n Cotorsion and algebraically compact torsion-free groups such as the p-adic integers\n Slender groups\n\nAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called mixed. If A is an abelian group and T(A) is its torsion subgroup, then the factor group A/T(A) is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of A, so  A is not isomorphic to . Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.\n\n Invariants and classification \nOne of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group A is its rank: the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of A. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of Q and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank r is a subgroup of Qr. On the other hand, the group of p-adic integers Zp is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z with different n are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.\n\nThe classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are pure and basic subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by Irving Kaplansky, László Fuchs, Phillip Griffith, and David Arnold, as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in Lecture Notes in Mathematics for more recent findings.\n\n Additive groups of rings \nThe additive group of a ring is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:\n\n Tensor product\n Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups\n Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions.\n\n Relation to other mathematical topics \nMany large abelian groups possess a natural topology, which turns them into topological groups.\n\nThe collection of all abelian groups, together with the homomorphisms between them, forms the category Ab, the prototype of an abelian category.\n\nNearly all well-known algebraic structures other than Boolean algebras are undecidable. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student  proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:\nAmongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the rank 1 case are well understood;\nThere are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;\nWhile countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.\nMany mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.\nFinite abelian groups remain a topic of research in computational group theory.\n\nMoreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the set theory commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the Whitehead problem: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also free abelian groups? In the 1970s, Saharon Shelah proved that the Whitehead problem is:\n Undecidable in ZFC (Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms), the conventional axiomatic set theory from which nearly all of present-day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;\n Undecidable even if ZFC is augmented by taking the generalized continuum hypothesis as an axiom;\n Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of constructibility (see statements true in L).\n\n A note on the typography \nAmong mathematical adjectives derived from the proper name of a mathematician, the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase a, rather than an uppercase A, indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.\n\n See also \n\nAbelianization\nClass field theory\nCommutator subgroup\nDihedral group of order 6, the smallest non-Abelian group\nSymmetric group of degree 3, also the smallest non-Abelian group\nElementary abelian group\nPontryagin duality\nPure injective module\nPure projective module\n\n Notes \n\n References \n \n \n \n \n  Unabridged and unaltered republication of a work first published by the Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, in 1978.\n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Abelian group theory\nCategory:Properties of groups\nCategory:Niels Henrik Abel"

      "text": "In mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry, complex analysis and algebraic number theory, an abelian variety is a projective algebraic variety that is also an algebraic group, i.e., has a group law that can be defined by regular functions. Abelian varieties are at the same time among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry and indispensable tools for much research on other topics in algebraic geometry and number theory.\n\nAn abelian variety can be defined by equations having coefficients in any field; the variety is then said to be defined over that field. Historically the first abelian varieties to be studied were those defined over the field of complex numbers. Such abelian varieties turn out to be exactly those complex tori that can be embedded into a complex  projective space. Abelian varieties defined over algebraic number fields are a special case, which is important also from the viewpoint of number theory. Localization techniques lead naturally from abelian varieties defined over number fields to ones defined over finite fields and various local fields. Since a number field is the fraction field of a Dedekind domain, for any nonzero prime of your Dedekind domain, there is a map from the Dedekind domain to the quotient of the Dedekind domain by the prime, which is a finite field for all finite primes. This induces a map from the fraction field to any such finite field. Given a curve with equation defined over the number field, we can apply this map to the coefficients to get a curve defined over some finite field, where the choices of finite field correspond to the finite primes of the number field.\n\nAbelian varieties appear naturally as Jacobian varieties (the connected components of zero in Picard varieties) and Albanese varieties of other algebraic varieties.  The group law of an abelian variety is necessarily commutative and the variety is non-singular. An elliptic curve is an abelian variety of dimension 1. Abelian varieties have Kodaira dimension 0.\n\n History and motivation \n\nIn the early  nineteenth century, the theory of elliptic functions succeeded  in giving a basis for the theory of elliptic integrals, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the square roots of cubic and quartic polynomials. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say quintics, what would happen?\n\nIn the work of Niels Abel and Carl Jacobi, the answer was formulated: this would involve functions of two complex variables, having four independent periods (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an abelian variety of dimension 2 (an abelian surface): what would now be called the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.\n\nAfter Abel and Jacobi, some of the most important contributors to the theory of abelian functions were Riemann, Weierstrass, Frobenius, Poincaré and Picard. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions. Eventually, in the 1920s, Lefschetz laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to be the first to use the name \"abelian variety\". It was André Weil in the 1940s who gave the subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.\n\nToday, abelian varieties form an important tool in number theory, in dynamical systems (more specifically in the study of Hamiltonian systems), and in algebraic geometry (especially Picard varieties and Albanese varieties).\n\n Analytic theory \n\n Definition \nA complex torus of dimension g is a torus of real dimension 2g that carries the structure of a complex manifold. It can always be obtained as the quotient of a g-dimensional complex vector space by a lattice of rank 2g.\nA complex abelian variety of dimension g is a complex torus of dimension g that is also a projective algebraic variety over the field of complex numbers. Since they are complex tori, abelian varieties carry the structure of a group. A morphism of abelian varieties is a morphism of the underlying algebraic varieties that preserves the identity element for the group structure. An isogeny is a finite-to-one morphism.\n\nWhen a complex torus carries the structure of an algebraic variety, this structure is necessarily unique. In the case g = 1, the notion of abelian variety is the same as that of elliptic curve, and every complex torus gives rise to such a curve; for g > 1 it has been known since Riemann that the algebraic variety condition imposes extra constraints on a complex torus.\n\n Riemann conditions \nThe following criterion by Riemann decides whether or not a given complex torus is an abelian variety, i.e. whether or not it can be embedded into a projective space. Let X be a g-dimensional torus given as X = V/L where V is a complex vector space of dimension g and L is a lattice in V. Then X is an abelian variety if and only if there exists a positive definite hermitian form on V whose imaginary part takes integral values on L×L. Such a form on X is usually called a (non-degenerate) Riemann form.  Choosing a basis for V and L, one can make this condition more explicit. There are several equivalent formulations of this; all of them are known as the Riemann conditions.\n\n The Jacobian of an algebraic curve \nEvery algebraic curve C of genus g ≥ 1 is associated with an abelian variety J of dimension g, by means of an analytic map of C into J. As a torus, J carries a commutative group structure, and the image of C generates J as a group. More accurately,     J is covered by C: J is covered by Cg: any point in J comes from a g-tuple of points in C. The study of differential forms on C, which give rise to the abelian integrals with which the theory started, can be derived from the simpler, translation-invariant theory of differentials on J. The abelian variety J is called the Jacobian variety of C, for any non-singular curve C over the complex numbers. From the point of view of birational geometry, its function field is the fixed field of the symmetric group on g letters acting on the function field of Cg.\n\n Abelian functions \nAn abelian function is a meromorphic function on an abelian variety, which may be regarded therefore as a periodic function of n complex variables, having 2n independent periods; equivalently, it is a function in the function field of an abelian variety.\nFor example, in the nineteenth century there was much interest in hyperelliptic integrals that may be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. This comes down to asking that J is a product of elliptic curves, up to an isogeny.\n\n Important Theorems \nOne important structure theorem of Abelian varieties is Matsusaka's theorem. It states that over an algebraically closed field every abelian variety  is the quotient of the Jacobian of some curve; that is, there is some surjection of abelian varieties  where  is a Jacobian. This theorem remains true if the ground field is infinite. Milne, J.S., Jacobian varieties, in Arithmetic Geometry, eds Cornell and Silverman, Springer-Verlag, 1986\n\n Algebraic definition \nTwo equivalent definitions of abelian variety over a general field k are commonly in use:\n a connected and complete algebraic group over k\n a connected and projective algebraic group over k.\nWhen the base is the field of complex numbers, these notions coincide with the previous definition. Over all bases, elliptic curves are abelian varieties of dimension 1.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Weil used the first definition (over an arbitrary base field) but could not at first prove that it implied the second. Only in 1948 did he prove that complete algebraic groups can be embedded into projective space. Meanwhile, in order to make the proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields that he had announced in 1940 work, he had to introduce the notion of an abstract variety and to rewrite the foundations of algebraic geometry to work with varieties without projective embeddings (see also the history section in the Algebraic Geometry article).\n\n Structure of the group of points \nBy the definitions, an abelian variety is a group variety. Its group of points can be proven to be commutative.\n\nFor C, and hence by the Lefschetz principle for every algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the torsion group of an abelian variety of dimension g is isomorphic to (Q/Z)2g. Hence, its n-torsion part is isomorphic to (Z/nZ)2g, i.e. the product of 2g copies of the cyclic group of order n.\n\nWhen the base field is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, the n-torsion is still isomorphic to (Z/nZ)2g when n and p are coprime. When n and p are not coprime, the same result can be recovered provided one interprets it as saying that the n-torsion defines a finite flat group scheme of rank 2g. If instead of looking at the full scheme structure on the n-torsion, one considers only the geometric points, one obtains a new invariant for varieties in characteristic p (the so-called p-rank when n = p).\n\nThe group of k-rational points for a global field k is finitely generated by the Mordell-Weil theorem. Hence, by the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a product of a free abelian group Zr and a finite commutative group for some non-negative integer r called the rank of the abelian variety. Similar results hold for some other classes of fields k.\n\nProducts\n\nThe product of an abelian variety A of dimension m, and an abelian variety B of dimension n, over the same field, is an abelian variety of dimension m + n. An abelian variety is simple if it is not isogenous to a product of abelian varieties of lower dimension. Any abelian variety is isogenous to a product of simple abelian varieties.\n\n Polarisation and dual abelian variety \n\n Dual abelian variety \n\nTo an abelian variety A over a field k, one associates a dual abelian variety Av (over the same field), which is the solution to the following moduli problem. A family of degree 0 line bundles parametrised by a k-variety T is defined to be a line bundle L on\nA×T such that\n for all t in T, the restriction of L to A×{t} is a degree 0 line bundle,\n the restriction of L to {0}×T is a trivial line bundle (here 0 is the identity of A).\n\nThen there is a variety Av and a family of degree 0 line bundles P, the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by Av such that a family L on T is associated a unique morphism f: T → Av so that L is isomorphic to the pullback of P along the morphism 1A×f: A×T → A×Av. Applying this to the case when T is a point, we see that the points of Av correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on A, so there is a natural group operation on Av given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.\n\nThis association is a duality in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism between the double dual Avv and A (defined via the Poincaré bundle) and that it is contravariant functorial, i.e. it associates to all morphisms f: A → B dual morphisms fv: Bv → Av in a compatible way. The n-torsion of an abelian variety and the n-torsion of its dual are dual to each other when n is coprime to the characteristic of the base. In general - for all n - the n-torsion group schemes of dual abelian varieties are Cartier duals of each other. This generalises the Weil pairing for elliptic curves.\n\n Polarisations \n\nA polarisation of an abelian variety is an isogeny from an abelian variety to its dual that is symmetric with respect to double-duality for abelian varieties and for which the pullback of the Poincaré bundle along the associated graph morphism is ample (so it is analogous to a positive-definite quadratic form). Polarised abelian varieties have finite automorphism groups. A principal polarisation is a polarisation that is an isomorphism. Jacobians of curves are naturally equipped with a principal polarisation as soon as one picks an arbitrary rational base point on the curve, and the curve can be reconstructed from its polarised Jacobian when the genus is > 1. Not all principally polarised abelian varieties are Jacobians of curves; see the Schottky problem. A polarisation induces a Rosati involution on the endomorphism ring  of A.\n\n Polarisations over the complex numbers \nOver the complex numbers, a polarised abelian variety can also be defined as an abelian variety A together with a choice of a Riemann form H. Two Riemann forms H1 and H2 are called equivalent if there are positive integers n and m such that nH1=mH2. A choice of an equivalence class of Riemann forms on A is called a polarisation of A. A morphism of polarised abelian varieties is a morphism A → B of abelian varieties such that the pullback of the Riemann form on B to A is equivalent to the given form on A.\n\n Abelian scheme \nOne can also define abelian varieties scheme-theoretically and  relative to a base. This allows for a uniform treatment of phenomena such as reduction mod p of abelian varieties (see Arithmetic of abelian varieties), and parameter-families of abelian varieties. An abelian scheme over a base scheme S of relative dimension g is a proper, smooth group scheme over S whose geometric fibers are connected and of dimension g. The fibers of an abelian scheme are abelian varieties, so one could think of an abelian scheme over S as being a family of abelian varieties parametrised by S.\n\nFor an abelian scheme A / S, the group of n-torsion points forms a finite flat group scheme. The union of the pn-torsion points, for all n, forms a p-divisible group. Deformations of abelian schemes are, according to the Serre–Tate theorem, governed by the deformation properties of the associated p-divisible groups.\n\nSemiabelian variety\nA semiabelian variety is a commutative group variety which is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus.\n\n See also \n Motives\n Timeline of abelian varieties\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n .

      "text": "Bernt Michael Holmboe (23 March 1795 – 28 March 1850) was a Norwegian mathematician. He was home-tutored from an early age, and was not enrolled in school until 1810. Following a short period at the Royal Frederick University, which included a stint as assistant to Christopher Hansteen, Holmboe was hired as a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School in 1818, where he met the future renowned mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. Holmboe's lasting impact on mathematics worldwide has been said to be his tutoring of Abel, both in school and privately. The two became friends and remained so until Abel's early death. Holmboe moved to the Royal Frederick University in 1826, where he worked until his own death in 1850.\n\nHolmboe's significant impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools. It was widely used, but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen's alternative offering, sparking what may have been Norway's first debate about school textbooks.\n\nEarly life and career\nBernt Michael Holmboe was born in Vang in 1795, the son of vicar Jens Holmboe (1746–1823) and his wife Cathrine Holst (1763–1823). He grew up in Eidsberg with his nine siblings, and was the elder brother of noted philologist Christopher Andreas Holmboe. Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age, but was sent to the Christiania Cathedral School in 1810 to complete his secondary education. There he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics. He enrolled as a student at the Royal Frederick University in 1814, a turbulent year in Norwegian history. Norway had been a province of Denmark since 1397, but had come under Swedish control in the January 1814 Treaty of Kiel. Following Norway's declaration of independence in the Constitution of 17 May, Sweden responded by waging a military campaign against Norway during the summer of 1814. Holmboe was a spokesperson for the student group opposed to the presence of Swedish troops in the country. Any outspokenness from the student community was highly visible at the time, as the university had only seventeen students as of 1813, its year of establishment.\n\nAs well as his private studies, Holmboe attended lectures given by Søren Rasmusen. In 1815 he was appointed to the position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen, a lecturer at the university, and delivered some lectures himself. In early 1818, Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position that had become vacant in 1817. The school principal, Jacob Rosted, had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among others. In his teaching, Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph-Louis Lagrange.\n\nNiels Henrik Abel\n\nAt the Christiania Cathedral School, Holmboe met Niels Henrik Abel, then a pupil there. Holmboe quickly discovered Abel's talent, and proclaimed him as a \"splendid genius\" in his report card.Quote:  In English: \"A splendid mathematical genius.\" (remark written by Holmboe) The school's primary focus was on classical education and Latin, and so Holmboe tutored Abel privately. His personal support for Abel has been called \"[Holmboe's] most important contribution to mathematics\".Quote:  In English: \"... the way Holmboe supported and helped Abel should be considered his most important contribution to mathematics.\" (statement of the article writer)\n\nHolmboe and Abel became close friends. Two of Holmboe's younger brothers studied with Abel, and the three were also on friendly terms. Abel was invited to the Holmboe family residence in Eidsberg on several occasions, including to celebrate Christmas.\n\nAbel died from tuberculosis in 1829, at the age of twenty-six. Ten years after Abel's death Holmboe edited and published his complete works in two volumes—Oeuvres complètes de N.H. Abel ('Complete Works of N.H. Abel'). He was the first to do so.\n\nLater life and career\nHolmboe published his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed with the second volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, the purpose of the books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.\n\nIn 1826, Holmboe was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University. Some claimed that he owed his appointment to Abel's absence, as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time. Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include Stereometrie (Stereometry) (1833), Plan- og sfærisk Trigonometrie (Plan and Spherical Trigonometry) (1834), and Lærebog i den høiere Mathematik (Textbook of Advanced Mathematics) (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818).\n\nAt the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who had become a professor there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote a review of the book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.\n\nHolmboe also became involved in the field of insurance. From 1832 to 1848 he was a member of Tilsynskomiteen for private forsørgelses- og understøttelsesselskaper, the country's first public committee for the supervision of insurance companies. On the other side of the table, from 1847 Holmboe was a member of the board of directors of the insurance company Gjensidige, founded by his former student Ole Jacob Broch.\n\nLegacy\nA Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize for teachers of mathematics was established in 2005, and is awarded annually. The prize money, NOK 50,000, are provided by the Abel Foundation, which awards the Abel Prize.The Abel Prize web site, The Abel Fund: Activity Profile The prize is administered by the board of the Norwegian Mathematical Society. The current board chairman is Tom Lindstrøm, professor at the University of Oslo.\n\nA street at Majorstuen in Oslo, Holmboes gate, has been named after Bernt Michael Holmboe. Before 1879 it was named Hansteens gate, after Christopher Hansteen.\n\nMarriage and children\nHolmboe married twice. His first wife, Nikoline Antonie Finkenhagen, born 1804 in Toten, died in 1839 after five years of marriage. They had three daughters, two of whom (Fredrikke and Nikoline, Jr.) reached adulthood, and one stillborn son. He married his second wife, Ingeborg Thorp in 1842. She was born in 1812 in Voss. This marriage produced two sons, Christopher and Jens, and two daughters, Cathrine and Olava. Only Jens and Cathrine reached adulthood.Genealogical entry for Bernt Michael Holmboe – published by Fogd Jens Holmboes legat.

      "text": "Robert Phelan Langlands,  (; born October 6, 1936) is an American-Canadian mathematician. He is best known as the founder of the Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures and results connecting representation theory and automorphic forms to the study of Galois groups in number theory,D Mackenzie (2000) Fermat's Last Theorem's First Cousin, Science 287(5454), 792-793. for which he received the 2018 Abel Prize. He is an emeritus professor and occupies Albert Einstein's office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n\nCareer\nLanglands was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, in 1936. In 1945 he moved to White Rock, near the US border, where his parent had a shop selling building materials.\n\nHe enrolled at the University of British Columbia at the age of 16, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1957; he continued on there to receive an M. Sc. in 1958. He then went to Yale University where he received a Ph.D. in 1960.\n\nHis first academic position was at Princeton University from 1960 to 1967, where he worked as an Associate Professor. He was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California Berkeley from 1964 to 1965 and between 1967 to 1972 he was at Yale University. He was appointed Hermann Weyl Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1972, and became Professor Emeritus in January 2007.\n\nResearch\nLanglands' Ph.D. thesis was on the analytical theory of Lie semigroups,For context, see the note by Derek Robinson at the IAS site but he soon moved into representation theory, adapting the methods of Harish-Chandra to the theory of automorphic forms. His first accomplishment in this field was a formula for the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms, in which particular types of Harish-Chandra's discrete series appeared.\n\nHe next constructed an analytical theory of Eisenstein series for reductive groups of rank greater than one, thus extending work of Hans Maass, Walter Roelcke, and Atle Selberg from the early 1950s for rank one groups such as . This amounted to describing in general terms the continuous spectra of arithmetic quotients, and showing that all automorphic forms arise in terms of cusp forms and the residues of Eisenstein series induced from cusp forms on smaller subgroups. As a first application, he proved the Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers for the large class of arbitrary simply connected Chevalley groups defined over the rational numbers. Previously this had been known only in a few isolated cases and for certain classical groups where it could be shown by inductionLanglands, Robert P. (1966), \"The volume of the fundamental domain for some arithmetical subgroups of Chevalley groups\", Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups, Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Providence, R.I.: Amer. Math. Soc., pp. 143–148, MR 0213362\n\nAs a second application of this work, he was able to show meromorphic continuation for a large class of -functions arising in the theory of automorphic forms, not previously known to have them. These occurred in the constant terms of Eisenstein series, and meromorphicity as well as a weak functional equation were a consequence of functional equations for Eisenstein series. This work led in turn, in the winter of 1966–67, to the now well known conjectures making up what is often called the Langlands program. Very roughly speaking, they propose a huge generalization of previously known examples of reciprocity, including (a) classical class field theory, in which characters of local and arithmetic abelian Galois groups are identified with characters of local multiplicative groups and the idele quotient group, respectively; (b) earlier results of Martin Eichler and Goro Shimura in which the Hasse–Weil zeta functions of arithmetic quotients of the upper half plane are identified with -functions occurring in Hecke's theory of holomorphic automorphic forms. These conjectures were first posed in relatively complete form in a famous letter to Weil, written in January 1967. It was in this letter that he introduced what has since become known as the -group and along with it, the notion of functoriality.\n\nThe book by Hervé Jacquet and Langlands on  presented a theory of automorphic forms for the general linear group , establishing among other things the Jacquet–Langlands correspondence showing that functoriality was capable of explaining very precisely how automorphic forms for  related to those for quaternion algebras. This book applied the adelic trace formula for  and quaternion algebras to do this. Subsequently James Arthur, a student of Langlands while he was at Yale, successfully developed the trace formula for groups of higher rank. This has become a major tool in attacking functoriality in general, and in particular has been applied to demonstrating that the Hasse–Weil zeta functions of certain Shimura varieties are among the -functions arising from automorphic forms.\n\nThe functoriality conjecture is far from proven, but a special case (the octahedral Artin conjecture, proved by LanglandsLanglands, Robert P, Base change for GL(2). Annals of Mathematics Studies, 96. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.; ; MR 574808 and TunnellTunnell, Jerrold, Artin's conjecture for representations of octahedral type, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (N.S.) 5 (1981), no. 2, 173–175.) was the starting point of Andrew Wiles' attack on the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture and Fermat's last theorem.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Langlands turned his attention to physics, particularly the problems of percolation and conformal invariance. In 1995, Langlands started a collaboration with Bill Casselman at the University of British Columbia with the aim of posting nearly all of his writings—including publications, preprints, as well as selected correspondence—on the Internet. The correspondence includes a copy of the original letter to Weil that introduced the -group. In recent years he has turned his attention back to automorphic forms, working in particular on a theme he calls `beyond endoscopy'.\n\nAwards and honors\nLanglands has received the 1996 Wolf Prize (which he shared with Andrew Wiles),AMS Notices the 2005 AMS Steele Prize, the 1980 Jeffery–Williams Prize, the 1988 NAS Award in Mathematics from the National Academy of Sciences, the 2006 Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences (with Richard Taylor) for his work on automorphic forms. In  2018 Langlands was awarded the Abel Prize for \"his visionary program connecting representation theory to number theory.\".\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1972 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1981. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-01-27.\n\nIn 2003, Langlands received a doctorate honoris causa from Université Laval.\n\nIn 2019, Langlands was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nPersonal life\nLanglands spent a year in Turkey in 1967–68, where his office at the Middle East Technical University was next to that of Cahit Arf.The work of Robert Langlands – Miscellaneous items, Digital Mathematics Archive, UBC SunSITE, last accessed 2013-12-10.

      "text": "Peter David Lax (born Lax Péter Dávid; 1 May 1926) is a Hungarian-born American mathematician working in the areas of pure and applied mathematics. \n\nLax has made important contributions to integrable systems, fluid dynamics and shock waves, solitonic physics, hyperbolic conservation laws, and mathematical and scientific computing, among other fields.\n\nIn a 1958 paper Lax stated a conjecture about matrix representations for third order hyperbolic polynomials which remained unproven for over four decades. Interest in the \"Lax conjecture\" grew as mathematicians working in several different areas recognized the importance of its implications in their field, until it was finally proven to be true in 2003.\n\nLife and education\nLax was born in Budapest, Hungary to a Jewish family. Lax began displaying an interest in mathematics at age twelve, and soon his parents hired Rózsa Péter as a tutor for him. His parents Klara Kornfield and Henry Lax were both physicians and his uncle Albert Kornfeld (also known as Albert Korodi) was a mathematician, as well as a friend of Leó Szilárd. \n\nThe family left Hungary on November 15, 1941, and traveled via Lisbon to the United States. As a high school student at Stuyvesant High School, Lax took no math classes but did compete on the school math team. During this time, he met with John von Neumann, Richard Courant, and Paul Erdős, who introduced him to Albert Einstein. \n\nAs he was still 17 when he finished high school, he could avoid military service, and was able to study for three semesters at New York University. He attended a complex analysis class in the role of a student, but ended up taking over as instructor. He met his future wife, Anneli Cahn (married to her first husband at that time) in this class.\n\nBefore being able to complete his studies, Lax was drafted into the U.S. Army. After basic training, the Army sent him to Texas A&M University for more studies. He was then sent to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and soon afterwards to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. At Los Alamos, he began working as a calculator operator, but eventually moved on to higher-level mathematics. \n\nAfter the war ended, he remained with the Army at Los Alamos for another year, while taking courses at the University of New Mexico, then studied at Stanford University for a semester with Gábor Szegő and George Pólya.\n\nLax returned to NYU for the 1946–1947 academic year, and by pooling credits from the four universities at which he had studied, he graduated that year. He stayed at NYU for his graduate studies, marrying Anneli in 1948 and earning a Ph.D. in 1949 under the supervision of Kurt O. Friedrichs..\n\nLax holds a faculty position in the Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.\n\nAwards and honors\nHe is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the National Academy of Sciences, USA. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1966 and again in 1973.

      "text": "John Willard Milnor (born February 20, 1931) is an American mathematician known for his work in differential topology, K-theory and dynamical systems. Milnor is a distinguished professor at Stony Brook University and one of the four mathematicians to have won the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, and the Abel Prize (along with Pierre Deligne, Jean-Pierre Serre, and John G. Thompson).\n\nEarly life and career\nMilnor was born on February 20, 1931 in Orange, New Jersey.Staff. A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS: The Institute for Advanced Study Faculty and Members 1930–1980, p. 35. Institute for Advanced Study, 1980. Accessed November 24, 2015. \"Milnor, John Willard M, Topology Born 1931 Orange, NJ.\" His father was J. Willard Milnor and his mother was Emily Cox Milnor. As an undergraduate at Princeton University he was named a Putnam Fellow in 1949 and 1950 and also proved the Fary–Milnor theorem. He continued on to graduate school at Princeton under the direction of Ralph Fox and submitted his dissertation, entitled \"Isotopy of Links\", which concerned link groups (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, in 1954. Upon completing his doctorate he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1970 to 1990.\n\nHis students have included Tadatoshi Akiba, Jon Folkman, John Mather, Laurent C. Siebenmann, and Michael Spivak. His wife, Dusa McDuff, is a professor of mathematics at Barnard College.\n\nResearch\nOne of his published works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of 7-dimensional spheres with nonstandard differential structure. Later, with Michel Kervaire, he showed that the 7-sphere has 15 differentiable structures (28 if one considers orientation).An n-sphere with nonstandard differential structure is called an exotic sphere, a term coined by Milnor. Egbert Brieskorn found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a singular point is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently Milnor worked on the topology of isolated singular points of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the Milnor fibration whose fiber has the homotopy type of a bouquet of μ spheres where μ is known as the Milnor number. Milnor's 1968 book on his theory inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area which continues to mature to this day.\n\nIn 1961 Milnor disproved the Hauptvermutung by illustrating two simplicial complexes which are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct.\n\nIn 1984 Milnor introduced a definition of attractor.  The objects generalize standard attractors, include so-called unstable attractors and are now known as Milnor attractors.\n\nMilnor's current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics:\n\nIt is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor's work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor's approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with Thurston. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with Poincaré's work on circle diffeomorphisms, which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor's work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems. \n\nHe was an editor of the Annals of Mathematics for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books.\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 1962 Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal for his work in differential topology. He later went on to win the National Medal of Science (1967), the Lester R. Ford Award in 1970 and again in 1984, the Leroy P Steele Prize for \"Seminal Contribution to Research\" (1982), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (1989), the Leroy P Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2004), and the Leroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2011) \"... for a paper of fundamental and lasting importance, On manifolds homeomorphic to the 7-sphere, Annals of Mathematics 64 (1956), 399–405\".  In 1991 a symposium was held at Stony Brook University in celebration of his 60th birthday.\n\nMilnor was awarded the 2011 Abel Prize, for his \"pioneering discoveries in topology, geometry and algebra.\" Reacting to the award, Milnor told the New Scientist \"It feels very good,\" adding that \"[o]ne is always surprised by a call at 6 o'clock in the morning.\"\nIn 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, for \"contributions to differential topology, geometric topology, algebraic topology, algebra, and dynamical systems\".2014 Class of the Fellows of the AMS, American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-11-04.\n\nPublications\nBooks\n\nJournal articles\n\nLecture notes\n\nSee also\n List of things named after John Milnor\n Orbit portrait\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n Home page at SUNYSB\n Photo\n Exotic spheres home page\n The Abel Prize 2011 – video \n \n\nCategory:1931 births\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:Abel Prize laureates\nCategory:Fields Medalists\nCategory:Institute for Advanced Study faculty\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nCategory:Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences\nCategory:National Medal of Science laureates\nCategory:People from Orange, New Jersey\nCategory:Princeton University alumni\nCategory:Princeton University faculty\nCategory:Putnam Fellows\nCategory:Stony Brook University faculty\nCategory:Topologists\nCategory:Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates\nCategory:Alexander von Humboldt Fellows\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:Dynamical systems theorists\nCategory:Geometers\nCategory:Sloan Fellows"

He was baptized in the Episcopal Church. He had a younger sister, Martha (born November 16, 1930).\n\nNash attended kindergarten and public school, and he learned from books provided by his parents and grandparents. Nash's parents pursued opportunities to supplement their son's education, and arranged for him to take advanced mathematics courses at a local community college during his final year of high school. He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (which later became Carnegie Mellon University) through a full benefit of the George Westinghouse Scholarship, initially majoring in chemical engineering. He switched to a chemistry major and eventually, at the advice of his teacher John Lighton Synge, to mathematics.  After graduating in 1948 (at age 19) with both a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics, Nash accepted a scholarship to Princeton University, where he pursued further graduate studies in mathematics.\n\nNash's adviser and former Carnegie professor Richard Duffin wrote a letter of recommendation for Nash's entrance to Princeton stating, \"He is a mathematical genius.\"  Nash was also accepted at Harvard University. However, the chairman of the mathematics department at Princeton, Solomon Lefschetz, offered him the John S. Kennedy fellowship, convincing Nash that Princeton valued him more.Nasar (2011), pp. 46–7. Further, he considered Princeton more favorably because of its proximity to his family in Bluefield. At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory, later known as the Nash equilibrium.Nasar (2002), pp. xvi–xix.\n\n Major contributions \nthumb|upright|Nash in November 2006 at a game theory conference in Cologne, Germany\n\n Game theory \nNash earned a Ph.D. degree in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games.\n\nThe thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. It won Nash the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994.\n\nPublications authored by Nash relating to the concept are in the following papers :\n\n Other mathematics \nNash did groundbreaking work in the area of real algebraic geometry:\n  See \n\nHis work in mathematics includes the Nash embedding theorem, which shows that every abstract Riemannian manifold can be isometrically realized as a submanifold of Euclidean space. He also made significant contributions to the theory of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations and to singularity theory.\n\nMikhail Leonidovich Gromov writes about Nash's work:\n\nJohn Milnor gives a list of 21 publications.\n\nIn the Nash biography A Beautiful Mind, author Sylvia Nasar explains that Nash was working on proving Hilbert's nineteenth problem, a theorem involving elliptic partial differential equations when, in 1956, he suffered a severe disappointment. He learned that an Italian mathematician, Ennio de Giorgi, had published a proof just months before Nash achieved his. Each took different routes to get to their solutions. The two mathematicians met each other at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University during the summer of 1956. It has been speculated that if only one had solved the problem, he would have been given the Fields Medal for the proof.\n\nIn 2011, the National Security Agency declassified letters written by Nash in the 1950s, in which he had proposed a new encryption–decryption machine. The letters show that Nash had anticipated many concepts of modern cryptography, which are based on computational hardness.\n\n Mental illness \nAlthough Nash's mental illness first began to manifest in the form of paranoia, his wife later described his behavior as erratic. Nash seemed to believe that all men who wore red ties were part of a communist conspiracy against him. He mailed letters to embassies in Washington, D.C., declaring that they were establishing a government.Nasar (2011), p. 251. Nash's psychological issues crossed into his professional life when he gave an American Mathematical Society lecture at Columbia University in 1959. Originally intended to present proof of the Riemann hypothesis, the lecture was incomprehensible. Colleagues in the audience immediately realized that something was wrong.\n\nHe was admitted to McLean Hospital in April 1959, staying through May of the same year. There, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, a person suffering from the disorder is typically dominated by relatively stable, often paranoid, fixed beliefs that are either false, over-imaginative or unrealistic, and usually accompanied by experiences of seemingly real perception of something not actually present.  Further signs are marked particularly by auditory and perceptional disturbances, a lack of motivation for life, and mild clinical depression.Nasar (2011), p. 32.\n\nIn 1961, Nash was admitted to the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton. Over the next nine years, he spent periods in psychiatric hospitals, where he received both antipsychotic medications and insulin shock therapy.\n\nAlthough he sometimes took prescribed medication, Nash later wrote that he did so only under pressure. After 1970, he was never committed to a hospital again, and he refused any further medication. According to Nash, the film A Beautiful Mind inaccurately implied he was taking what were the new atypical antipsychotics of the time period. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter who was worried about the film encouraging people with the disorder to stop taking their medication.\n\nNash felt psychotropic drugs were overrated and that the adverse effects were not given enough consideration once someone was deemed mentally ill.Nash, John \"PBS Interview: Paths to Recovery\". 2002.Nash, John \"PBS Interview: How does Recovery Happen?\" 2002. According to Sylvia Nasar, author of the book A Beautiful Mind, on which the movie was based, Nash recovered gradually with the passage of time. Encouraged by his then former wife, de Lardé, Nash lived at home and spent his time in the Princeton mathematics department where his eccentricities were accepted even when his condition was poor. De Lardé credits his recovery to maintaining \"a quiet life\" with social support.\n\nNash dated the start of what he termed \"mental disturbances\" to the early months of 1959, when his wife was pregnant. He described a process of change \"from scientific rationality of thinking into the delusional thinking characteristic of persons who are psychiatrically diagnosed as 'schizophrenic' or 'paranoid schizophrenic.Nash, John (1995) \"John F. Nash Jr. – Biographical\" from Les Prix Nobel. The Nobel Prizes 1994, Editor Tore Frängsmyr, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1952, For Nash, this included seeing himself as a messenger or having a special function of some kind, of having supporters and opponents and hidden schemers, along with a feeling of being persecuted and searching for signs representing divine revelation.Nash, John \"PBS Interview: Delusional Thinking\". 2002. Nash suggested his delusional thinking was related to his unhappiness, his desire to feel important and be recognized, and his characteristic way of thinking, saying, \"I wouldn't have had good scientific ideas if I had thought more normally.\" He also said, \"If I felt completely pressureless I don't think I would have gone in this pattern\".Nash, John \"PBS Interview: The Downward Spiral\" 2002. He did not draw a categorical distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Nash, John (April 10, 2005) \"Glimpsing inside a beautiful mind\". Interview by Shane Hegarty. Schizophrenia.com. Nash reported he did not hear voices until around 1964, and later engaged in a process of consciously rejecting them.Nash, John \"PBS Interview: Hearing voices\". 2002. He further stated he was always taken to hospitals against his will. He only temporarily renounced his \"dream-like delusional hypotheses\" after being in a hospital long enough to decide he would superficially conform — to behave normally or to experience \"enforced rationality\". Only gradually on his own did he \"intellectually reject\" some of the \"delusionally influenced\" and \"politically oriented\" thinking as a waste of effort. By 1995, however, even though he was \"thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists,\" he said he felt more limited.Nash, John \"John Nash: My experience with mental illness\". PBS Interview,2002.\n\nNash wrote in 1994:\n\n Recognition and later career \nthumb|right|Nash pictured in 2011\nIn 1978, Nash was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999.\n\nIn 1994, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (along with John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten) as a result of his game theory work as a Princeton graduate student.Nasar (2002), p. xiii. In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was  John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the Bank of Sweden's Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health ability to receive the award in recognition of his early work.\n\nNash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific studies.\n\nNash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being \"insane\" and not fitting into a usual social function, to being \"on strike\" from an economic point of view. He advanced views in evolutionary psychology about the value of human diversity and the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.\n\nNash developed work on the role of money in society. Within the framing theorem that people can be so controlled and motivated by money that they may not be able to reason rationally about it, he criticized interest groups that promote quasi-doctrines based on Keynesian economics that permit manipulative short-term inflation and debt tactics that ultimately undermine currencies. He suggested a global \"industrial consumption price index\" system that would support the development of more \"ideal money\" that people could trust rather than more unstable \"bad money\". He noted that some of his thinking parallels economist and political philosopher Friedrich Hayek's thinking regarding money and a nontypical viewpoint of the function of the authorities.Zuckerman, Julia (April 27, 2005) \"Nobel winner Nash critiques economic theory\". The Brown Daily Herald. By JULIA ZUCKERMAN Wednesday, April 27, 2005\n\nNash received an honorary degree, Doctor of Science and Technology, from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, an honorary degree in economics from the University of Naples Federico II on March 19, 2003, an honorary doctorate in economics from the University of Antwerp in April 2007, an honorary doctorate of science from the City University of Hong Kong on November 8, 2011, and was keynote speaker at a conference on game theory. He was also a prolific guest speaker at a number of world-class events, such as the Warwick Economics Summit in 2005 held at the University of Warwick. In 2012, he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved February 24, 2013. On May 19, 2015, a few days before his death, Nash, along with Louis Nirenberg, was awarded the 2015 Abel Prize by King Harald V of Norway at a ceremony in Oslo.\n\n Personal life \nIn 1951, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hired Nash as a C. L. E. Moore instructor in the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship in Massachusetts with Eleanor Stier, a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier, but Nash left Stier when she told him of her pregnancy.Goldstein, Scott (April 10, 2005)  Eleanor Stier, 84; Brookline nurse had son with Nobel laureate mathematician John F. Nash Jr., Boston.com News. The film based on Nash's life, A Beautiful Mind, was criticized during the run-up to the 2002 Oscars for omitting this aspect of his life. He was said to have abandoned her based on her social status, which he thought to have been beneath his.Sutherland, John (March 18, 2002) \"Beautiful mind, lousy character\",  The Guardian, March 18, 2002.\n\nIn Santa Monica, California in 1954, while in his 20s, Nash was arrested for indecent exposure in a sting operation targeting homosexual men. Although the charges were dropped, he was stripped of his top-secret security clearance and fired from RAND Corporation, where he had worked as a consultant.\n\nNot long after breaking up with Stier, Nash met Alicia Lardé Lopez-Harrison (January 1, 1933 – May 23, 2015), a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador. Lardé graduated from MIT, having majored in physics. They married in February 1957; although Nash was an atheist, the ceremony was performed in an Episcopal church. They had a son together, John Charles Martin Nash, who earned a PhD in Mathematics from Rutgers University.Nasar (2011), Chapter 17: Bad Boys, p. 143: \"In this circle, Nash learned to make a virtue of necessity, styling himself self-consciously as a \"free thinker.\" He announced that he was an atheist.\"Nasar (2011), p. 212: \"Nash, by then an atheist, balked at a Catholic ceremony. He would have been happy to get married in city hall.\"\n\nIn 1958, Nash earned a tenured position at MIT, and his first signs of mental illness were evident in early 1959. At this time, his wife was pregnant with their first child. He resigned his position as a member of the MIT mathematics faculty in the spring of 1959 and his wife had him admitted to  McLean Hospital for treatment of schizophrenia that same year. Their son, John Charles Martin Nash, was born soon afterward. The child was not named for a year because his wife felt Nash should have a say in the name given to the boy. Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lardé divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lardé's house as a boarder. This stability seemed to help him, and he learned how to consciously discard his paranoid delusions.David Goodstein, 'Mathematics to Madness, and Back', The New York Times, June 11, 1998 He stopped taking psychiatric medication and was allowed by Princeton to audit classes. He continued to work on mathematics and eventually was allowed to teach again. In the 1990s, Lardé and Nash resumed their relationship, remarrying in 2001.\n\n Death \nOn May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife were killed in a vehicle accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, New Jersey. They had been on their way home from the airport after a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the Abel Prize, when their taxicab driver, Tark Girgis, lost control of the vehicle and struck a guardrail. Both passengers were ejected from the car upon impact. State police revealed that it appeared neither passenger was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash. At the time of his death, the 86-year-old Nash was a longtime resident of West Windsor Township, New Jersey. He is survived by his son John Charles Martin Nash who lived with his parents at the time of their death, as well as his other son, John Stier.\n\nFollowing his death, obituaries appeared in scientific and popular media throughout the world. In addition to their obituary for Nash, The New York Times published an article containing quotes from Nash that had been assembled from media and other published sources. The quotes consisted of Nash's reflections on his life and achievements.\n\n Legacy \nAt Princeton, Nash became known as \"The Phantom of Fine Hall\" (Princeton's mathematics center), a shadowy figure who would scribble arcane equations on blackboards in the middle of the night. He is referred to in a novel set at Princeton, The Mind-Body Problem, 1983, by Rebecca Goldstein.\n\nSylvia Nasar's biography of Nash, A Beautiful Mind, was published in 1998. A film by the same name was released in 2001, directed by Ron Howard with Russell Crowe playing Nash; it won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\n Awards \n 1978 – INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize\n 1994 – Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences\n1999 – Leroy P Steele Prize\n 2010 – Double Helix Medal\n 2015 – Abel Prize\n\n See also \n\n Hex (board game)\n List of Nobel laureates\n\n References \n\n Bibliography \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Documentaries and video interviews \n \"A Brilliant Madness\" – a PBS American Experience documentary\n One on One – Professor John Nash with Riz Khan.

His contributions include the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality, which is important in the solution of the elliptic partial differential equations that arise in many areas of mathematics, and the formalization of the bounded mean oscillation known as John–Nirenberg space, which is used to study the behavior of both elastic materials and games of chance known as martingales.\n\nNirenberg's work on PDEs was described by the American Mathematical Society in 2002 as \"about the best that's been done\" towards solving the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem of fluid mechanics and turbulence, which is a Millennium Prize Problem and one of the largest unsolved problems in physics.\n\nBiography\nNirenberg was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and attended Baron Byng High School.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Sinai",
      "text": "Yakov Grigorevich Sinai (; born September 21, 1935) is a mathematician known for his work on dynamical systems.   He contributed to the modern metric theory of dynamical systems and connected the world of deterministic (dynamical) systems with the world of probabilistic (stochastic) systems.  He has also worked on mathematical physics and probability theory.  His efforts have provided the groundwork for advances in the physical sciences.\n\nSinai has won several awards, including the Nemmers Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics and the Abel Prize.\n\n Biography \nYakov Grigorevich Sinai was born into a Russian Jewish academic family on September 21, 1935, in Moscow, Soviet Union (now Russia).  His parents, Nadezda Kagan and Gregory Sinai, were both microbiologists. His grandfather, Veniamin Kagan, headed the Department of\nDifferential Geometry at Moscow State University and was a major influence on Sinai's life.\n\nSinai received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Moscow State University.  In 1960, he earned his Ph.D., also from Moscow State; his adviser was Andrey Kolmogorov. Together with Kolmogorov, he showed that even for \"unpredictable\" dynamic systems, the level of unpredictability of motion can be described mathematically.  In their idea, which became known as Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy, a system with zero entropy is entirely predictable, while a system with non-zero entropy has an unpredictability factor directly related to the amount of entropy.\n\nIn 1963, Sinai introduced the idea of dynamical billiards, also known as \"Sinai Billiards\".  In this idealized system, a particle bounces around inside a square boundary without loss of energy.  Inside the square is a circular wall, of which the particle also bounces off.  He then proved that for most initial trajectories of the ball, this system is ergodic, that is, after a long time, the amount of that time the ball will have spent in any given region on the surface of the table is approximately proportional to the area of that region.  It was the first time anyone proved a dynamic system was ergodic.\n\nAlso in 1963, Sinai announced a proof of the ergodic hypothesis for a gas consisting of n hard spheres confined to a box. The complete proof, however, was never published, and in 1987 Sinai declared that the announcement was premature. The problem remains open to this day.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1971, Sinai was a researcher in the Laboratory of Probabilistic and Statistical Methods at Moscow State University.  In 1971 he accepted a position as senior researcher at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics in Russia, while continuing to teach at Moscow State. He had to wait until 1981 to become a professor at Moscow State, likely because he had supported the dissident poet, mathematician and human rights activist Alexander Esenin-Volpin in 1968.\n\nSince 1993, Sinai has been a professor of mathematics at Princeton University, while maintaining his position at the Landau Institute.  For the 1997–98 academic year, he was the Thomas Jones Professor at Princeton, and in 2005, the Moore Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nIn 2002, Sinai won the Nemmers Prize for his \"revolutionizing\" work on dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, probability theory, and statistical physics.  In 2005, the Moscow Mathematical Journal dedicated an issue to Sinai writing \"Yakov Sinai is one of the greatest mathematicians of our time ... his exceptional scientific enthusiasm inspire[d] several generations of scientists all over the world.\"\n\nIn 2013, Sinai received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement. In 2014, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters awarded him the Abel Prize, for his contributions to dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and mathematical physics.  Presenting the award, Jordan Ellenberg said Sinai had solved real world physical problems \"with the soul of a mathematician\".  He praised the tools developed by Sinai which demonstrate how systems that look different may in fact have fundamental similarities.  The prize comes with 6 million Norwegian krone, equivalent at the time to $US 1 million or £600,000. He was also inducted into the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\nOther awards won by Sinai include the Boltzmann Medal (1986), the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics (1990), the Dirac Prize (1992), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (1997),  the Lagrange Prize (2008) and the Henri Poincaré Prize (2009). He is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  He is an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society (1992) and, in 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.  Sinai has been selected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1983), Brazilian Academy of Sciences (2000), the Academia Europaea, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society of London.  He holds honorary degrees from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Warwick University, and Warsaw University.\n\nSinai has authored more than 250 papers and books. Concepts in mathematics named after him include Sinai's random walk, Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measures, and Pirogov–Sinai theory.  Sinai has overseen more than 50 Ph.D. candidates.  He has spoken at the International Congress of Mathematicians four times.  In 2000, he was a plenary speaker at the First Latin American Congress in Mathematics.\n\nSinai is married to mathematician and physicist Elena B. Vul.

      "text": "Endre Szemerédi (; born August 21, 1940) is a Hungarian-American mathematician and computer scientist, working in the field of combinatorics and theoretical computer science. He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at Rutgers University since 1986. He also holds a professor emeritus status at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nSzemerédi has won prizes in mathematics and science, including the Abel Prize in 2012. He has made a number of discoveries in combinatorics and computer science, including Szemerédi's theorem, the Szemerédi regularity lemma, the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem, the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem and the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem.\n\nEarly life\nSzemerédi was born in Budapest. Since his parents wished him to become a doctor, Szemerédi enrolled at a college of medicine, but he dropped out after six months (in an interviewBy Gabor Stockert he explained it: \"I was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility.\").http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/blog/laureate/endre-szemeredi/Sunita Chand; Ramesh Chandra Parida . Science Reporter, February 2013, p. 17 He studied in Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest and received his PhD from Moscow State University. His adviser was Israel Gelfand. This stemmed from a misspelling, as Szemerédi originally wanted to study with Alexander Gelfond.\n\nAcademic career\nSzemerédi has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at Rutgers University since 1986. He has held visiting positions at Stanford University (1974), McGill University (1980), the University of South Carolina (1981–1983) and the University of Chicago (1985–1986).\n\nWork\nEndre Szemerédi has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of Paul Erdős and Pál Turán: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. This is now known as Szemerédi's theorem. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the Szemerédi regularity lemma, which has become an important lemma in combinatorics, being used for instance in property testing for graphs and in the theory of graph limits.\n\nHe is also known for the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem in incidence geometry and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem and Ruzsa–Szemerédi problem in graph theory. Miklós Ajtai and Szemerédi proved the corners theorem, an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the Szemerédi theorem. With Ajtai and János Komlós he proved the ct2/log t upper bound for the Ramsey number R(3,t), and constructed a sorting network of optimal depth. With Ajtai, Václav Chvátal, and Monroe M. Newborn, Szemerédi proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a graph with n vertices and m edges, where  has at least  crossings.  With Paul Erdős, he proved the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, Nick Pippenger, and William Trotter, he established a separation between nondeterministic linear time and deterministic linear time, in the spirit of the infamous P versus NP problem.\n\nAwards and honors\nSzemerédi has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tate",
      "text": "John Torrence Tate Jr. (born March 13, 1925) is an American mathematician, distinguished for many fundamental contributions in algebraic number theory, arithmetic geometry and related areas in algebraic geometry. He is professor emeritus at the University of Texas at Austin. He was awarded the Abel Prize in 2010.\n\nBiography\nTate was born in Minneapolis. His father, John Tate Sr., was a professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, and a longtime editor of Physical Review. His mother, Lois Beatrice Fossler, was a high school English teacher. Tate Jr.  received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard University, and entered the doctoral program in physics at Princeton University. He later transferred to the mathematics department and received his PhD in 1950 as a student of Emil Artin. Tate taught at Harvard for 36 years before joining the University of Texas in 1990 as a Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair. He retired from the Texas mathematics department in 2009, and returned to Harvard as a professor emeritus. He currently resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife Carol. He has three daughters with his first wife Karin Tate.\n\nMathematical work\nTate's thesis (1950) on Fourier analysis in number fields has become one of the ingredients for the modern theory of automorphic forms and their L-functions, notably by its use of the adele ring, its self-duality and harmonic analysis on it; independently and a little earlier, Kenkichi Iwasawa obtained a similar theory.  Together with his teacher Emil Artin, Tate gave a cohomological treatment of global class field theory, using techniques of group cohomology applied to the idele class group and Galois cohomology. This treatment made more transparent some of the algebraic structures in the previous approaches to class field theory which used central division algebras to compute the Brauer group of a global field.\n\nSubsequently, Tate introduced what are now known as Tate cohomology groups. In the decades following that discovery he extended the reach of Galois cohomology with the Poitou–Tate duality, the Tate–Shafarevich group, and relations with algebraic K-theory. With Jonathan Lubin, he recast local class field theory by the use of formal groups, creating the Lubin–Tate local theory of complex multiplication.\n\nHe has also made a number of individual and important contributions to p-adic theory; for example, Tate's invention of rigid analytic spaces can be said to have spawned the entire field of rigid analytic geometry. He found a p-adic analogue of Hodge theory, now called Hodge–Tate theory, which has blossomed into another central technique of modern algebraic number theory. Other innovations of his include the 'Tate curve' parametrization for certain p-adic elliptic curves and  the p-divisible (Tate–Barsotti) groups.\n\nMany of his results were not immediately published and some of them were written up by Serge Lang, Jean-Pierre Serre, Joseph H. Silverman and others. Tate and Serre collaborated on a paper on good reduction of abelian varieties. The classification of abelian varieties over finite fields was carried out by Taira Honda and Tate (the Honda–Tate theorem).J.T. Tate,   \"Classes d'isogénie des variétés abéliennes sur un corps fini (d' après T. Honda)\", Sem. Bourbaki Exp. 352, Lect. notes in math., 179, Springer  (1971)\n\nThe Tate conjectures are the equivalent for étale cohomology of the Hodge conjecture. They relate to the Galois action on the l-adic cohomology of an algebraic variety, identifying a space of 'Tate cycles' (the fixed cycles for a suitably Tate-twisted action) that conjecturally picks out the algebraic cycles. A special case of the conjectures, which are open in the general case, was involved in the proof of the Mordell conjecture by Gerd Faltings.\n\nTate has also had a major influence on the development of number theory through his role as a\nPh.D. advisor.  His students include George Bergman, Bernard Dwork, Benedict Gross, Robert Kottwitz, Jonathan Lubin, Stephen Lichtenbaum, James Milne, V. Kumar Murty, Carl Pomerance, Ken Ribet, Joseph H. Silverman, Dinesh Thakur.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nIn 1956 Tate was awarded the American Mathematical Society's Cole Prize for outstanding contributions to number theory. In 1995 he received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement from the American Mathematical Society. He was awarded a Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2002/03 for his creation of fundamental concepts in algebraic number theory.The 2002/3 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Wolf Foundation. Accessed March 24, 2010. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-08-25.\n\nIn 2010, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, of which he is a member, awarded him the Abel Prize, citing \"his vast and lasting impact on the theory of numbers\". According to a release by the Abel Prize committee \"Many of the major lines of research in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry are only possible because of the incisive contributions and illuminating insights of John Tate. He has truly left a conspicuous imprint on modern mathematics.\"\n\nTate has been described as \"one of the seminal mathematicians for the past half-century\" by William Beckner, Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas.\n\nSelected publications\n, Princeton University Ph.D. thesis under Emil Artin.

      "text": "Karen Keskulla Uhlenbeck (born August 24, 1942) is an American mathematician and a founder of modern geometric analysis. She is a professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin, where she held the Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair. She is currently a visiting associate at the Institute for Advanced Study and a visiting senior research scholar at Princeton University.\n\nUhlenbeck won the 2019 Abel Prize for \"her pioneering achievements in geometric partial differential equations, gauge theory, and integrable systems, and for the fundamental impact of her work on analysis, geometry and mathematical physics.\" She is the first woman to win the prize since its inception in 2003.\n\n Life and career \nUhlenbeck's first family name, Keskulla, comes from Keskküla and from her grandfather who was Estonian. Uhlenbeck received her B.A. (1964) from the University of Michigan. She began her graduate studies at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and married biophysicist Olke C. Uhlenbeck (the son of physicist George Uhlenbeck) in 1965. When her husband went to Harvard, she moved with him and restarted her studies at Brandeis University, where she earned an M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1968) under the supervision of Richard Palais. Her doctoral dissertation was titled The Calculus of Variations and Global Analysis.\n\nAfter temporary jobs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of California, Berkeley, and having difficulty finding a permanent position with her husband because of the \"anti-nepotism\" rules then in place that prevented hiring both a husband and wife even in distinct departments of a university, she took a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1971. However, she disliked Urbana and moved to the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1976 as well as separating from her first husband Olke Uhlenbeck in the same year. She moved again to the University of Chicago in 1983. In 1988, by which time she had married mathematician Robert F. Williams, she moved to the University of Texas at Austin as the Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chairholder. Uhlenbeck is currently a professor emeritus at the University of Texas at Austin, a visiting associate at the Institute for Advanced Study and a visiting senior research scholar at Princeton University.\n\n Research \nUhlenbeck is one of the founders of the field of geometric analysis, a discipline that uses differential geometry to study the solutions to differential equations and vice versa. She has also contributed to topological quantum field theory and integrable systems..\n\nTogether with Jonathan Sacks in the early 1980s, Uhlenbeck established regularity estimates that have found applications to studies of the singularities of harmonic maps and the existence of smooth local solutions to the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations in gauge theory. In particular, Donaldson describes their joint 1981 paper The existence of minimal immersions of 2-spheres as a \"landmark paper... which showed that, with a deeper analysis, variational arguments can still be used to give general existence results\" for harmonic map equations.\n\nBuilding on these ideas, Uhlenbeck initiated a systematic study of the moduli theory of minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds (also called minimal submanifold theory) in her 1983 paper, Closed minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\n\nIn particular, her work is described by Simon Donaldson in a survey of Yang–Mills geometry as foundational in the analytic aspects of the calculus of variations associated with the Yang–Mills functional. A wider survey of her contributions to the field of calculus of variations was published by Simon Donaldson in the March 2019 issue of Notices of the American Mathematical Society; Donaldson describes the work of Uhlenbeck, along with Shing-Tung Yau, Richard Schoen and several others, as developing a... \n\n Outreach \nIn 1991, Uhlenbeck co-founded, with Herbert Clemens and Dan Freed, the Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI) with the mission to \"provide an immersive educational and professional development opportunity for several parallel communities from across the larger umbrella of the mathematics profession.\" Uhlenbeck also co-founded the Women and Mathematics Program at the Institute for Advanced Study \"with the mission to recruit and retain more women in mathematics.\" British theoretical physicist and author Jim Al-Khalili describes Uhlenbeck as a \"role model\" for her work in promoting a career in mathematics to young people, particularly women.\n\n Personal life \nUhlenbeck is a self-described \"messy reader\" and \"messy thinker\", with boxes of books stacked on her desk at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. In spontaneous remarks made to Institute colleagues after winning the Abel Prize in March 2019, Uhlenbeck noted that for lack of prominent female role models during her apprenticeship in the field of mathematics, she had instead emulated chef Julia Child: \"She knew how to pick the turkey up off the floor and serve it\".\n\n Awards and honors \nIn March 2019, Uhlenbeck became the first woman to win the Abel Prize, with the award committee citing the decision for \"her pioneering achievements in geometric partial differential equations, gauge theory and integrable systems, and for the fundamental impact of her work on analysis, geometry and mathematical physics.\" Hans Munthe-Kaas, who chairs the award committee, stated that \"Her theories have revolutionised our understanding of minimal surfaces, such as more general minimisation problems in higher dimensions\". Uhlenbeck also won the National Medal of Science in 2000,. and the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research of the American Mathematical Society in 2007, \"for her foundational contributions in analytic aspects of mathematical gauge theory\", based on her 1982 papers \"Removable singularities in Yang–Mills fields\" and \"Connections with bounds on curvature\".\n\nShe became a MacArthur Fellow in 1983 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985. She was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1986. She became a Guggenheim Fellow in 2001,.\nan honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 2008, and a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012..\n\nShe was the Noether Lecturer of the Association for Women in Mathematics in 1988. In 1990, she was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, as only the second woman (after Emmy Noether) to give such a lecture.\n\nHer other awards include the University of Michigan alumna of the year (1984), the Sigma Xi Common Wealth Award for Science and Technology (1995), and honorary doctorates from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (2000), Ohio State University (2001), University of Michigan (2004), Harvard University (2007), and Princeton University (2012).\n\nSelected publications\nBooks\n\nResearch articles\n\n See also \n Timeline of women in mathematics\n Timeline of women in science\n\n References \n\nFurther reading\n\n External links \n\nCategory:1942 births\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:20th-century women mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century women mathematicians\nCategory:Abel Prize laureates\nCategory:American people of Estonian descent\nCategory:American women mathematicians\nCategory:Brandeis University alumni\nCategory:Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences alumni\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nCategory:Guggenheim Fellows\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:MacArthur Fellows\nCategory:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nCategory:National Medal of Science laureates\nCategory:People from Cleveland\nCategory:University of Chicago faculty\nCategory:University of Illinois at Chicago faculty\nCategory:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign faculty\nCategory:University of Michigan alumni\nCategory:University of Texas at Austin faculty"

      "text": "Sir Andrew John Wiles  (born 11 April 1953) is an English mathematician and a Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford, specialising in number theory. He is best known for proving Fermat's Last Theorem, for which he was awarded the 2016 Abel Prize and the 2017 Copley Medal by the Royal Society. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000, and in 2018 was appointed as the first Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford.\n\nEducation and early life\nWiles was born on 11 April 1953 in Cambridge, England, the son of Maurice Frank Wiles (1923–2005), later the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford, and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the chaplain at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, for the years 1952–55. Wiles attended King's College School, Cambridge, and The Leys School, Cambridge.\n\nWiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped at his local library where he found a book about the theorem. Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten year old, could understand it, but that no one had proven, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by Ken Ribet's 1986 proof of the epsilon conjecture, which Gerhard Frey had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.\n\nCareer and research\nWiles earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1974 at Merton College, Oxford, and a PhD in 1980 as a graduate student of Clare College, Cambridge. After a stay at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1981, Wiles became a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University. In 1985–86, Wiles was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques near Paris and at the École Normale Supérieure. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford, and then he returned to Princeton. From 1994 to 2009, Wiles was a Eugene Higgins Professor at Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor. In May 2018 he was appointed Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford, the first in the university's history. \n\nWiles's graduate research was guided by John Coates beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by the methods of Iwasawa theory. He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the rational numbers, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to totally real fields.\n\nHis biographical page at Princeton University's website states that \"Andrew has few equals in terms of his impact on modern number theory. Many of the world’s very best young number theorists received their PhDs under Andrew ... and many of these are today leaders and professors at top institutions around the world\".\n\nProof of Fermat's Last Theorem\n\nStarting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet, it became clear that Fermat's Last Theorem could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the modularity theorem (unproven at the time and then known as the \"Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture\"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.\n\nThe conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.Simon Singh (1997). Fermat's Last Theorem.  For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor John Coates states that it seemed \"impossible to actually prove\", and Ken Ribet considered himself \"one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible\", adding that \"Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it].\"\n\nDespite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for Frey's curve. He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.\n\nIn June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge.\n\nIn August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing, this area came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student Richard Taylor, he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated issue of the Annals of Mathematics.\n\nAwards and honours\nthumb|Andrew Wiles in front of the statue of Pierre de Fermat in Beaumont-de-Lomagne, Fermat's birthplace in southern France\nWiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world's other mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the BBC documentary series Horizon that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed \"The Proof\", and it was made an episode of the US Public Broadcasting Service's science television series Nova.

Slightly more generally, as is the case with the trigonometric functions sin and cos, several functions may be involved; this is more apparent than real, in that case, since there cos is an algebraic function of sin (in other words, we usually take their functions both as defined on the unit circle).\n\nThe scope of the idea of an addition theorem was fully explored in the nineteenth century, prompted by the discovery of the addition theorem for elliptic functions. To 'classify' addition theorems it is necessary to put some restriction on the type of function G admitted, such that \n\nF(x + y) = G(F(x), F(y)).\n\nIn this identity one can assume that F and G are vector-valued (have several components). An algebraic addition theorem is one in which G can be taken to be a vector of polynomials, in some set of variables. The conclusion of the mathematicians of the time was that the theory of abelian functions essentially exhausted the interesting possibilities: considered as a functional equation to be solved with polynomials, or indeed rational functions or algebraic functions, there were no further types of solution. \n\nIn more contemporary language this appears as part of the theory of algebraic groups, dealing with commutative groups. The connected, projective variety examples are indeed exhausted by abelian functions, as is shown by a number of results characterising an abelian variety by rather weak conditions on its group law. The so-called quasi-abelian functions are all known to come from extensions of abelian varieties by commutative affine group varieties. Therefore the old conclusions about the scope of global algebraic addition theorems can be said to hold. A more modern aspect is the theory of formal groups.\n\nSee also\nTimeline of abelian varieties\nAddition theorem for spherical harmonics\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry\nCategory:Theorems in algebra"

      "text": "In mathematics, the Ax–Grothendieck theorem is a result about injectivity and surjectivity of polynomials that was proved independently by James Ax and Alexander Grothendieck...\n\nThe theorem is often given as this special case: If P is an injective polynomial function from an n-dimensional complex vector space to itself then P is bijective. That is, if P always maps distinct arguments to distinct values, then the values of P cover all of Cn.\n\nThe full theorem generalizes to any algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field.Éléments de géométrie algébrique, IV3, Proposition 10.4.11.\n\nProof via finite fields\nGrothendieck's proof of the theorem is based on proving the analogous theorem for finite fields and their algebraic closures. That is, for any field F that is itself finite or that is the closure of a finite field, if a polynomial P from Fn to itself is injective then it is bijective.\n\nIf F is a finite field, then Fn is finite. In this case the theorem is true for trivial reasons having nothing to do with the representation of the function as a polynomial: any injection of a finite set to itself is a bijection. When F is the algebraic closure of a finite field, the result follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. The Ax–Grothendieck theorem for complex numbers can therefore be proven by showing that a counterexample over C would translate into a counterexample in some algebraic extension of a finite field.\n\nThis method of proof is noteworthy in that it is an example of the idea that finitistic algebraic relations in fields of characteristic 0 translate into algebraic relations over finite fields with large characteristic. Thus, one can use the arithmetic of finite fields to prove a statement about C even though there is no homomorphism from any finite field to C. The proof thus uses model-theoretic principles to prove an elementary statement about polynomials. The proof for the general case uses a similar method.\n\nOther proofs\nThere are other proofs of the theorem. Armand Borel gave a proof using topology. The case of n = 1 and field C follows since C is algebraically closed and can also be thought of as a special case of the result that for any analytic function f on C, injectivity of f implies surjectivity of f. This is a corollary of Picard's theorem.\n\nRelated results\nAnother example of reducing theorems about morphisms of finite type to finite fields can be found in EGA IV: There, it is proved that a radicial S-endomorphism of a scheme X of finite type over S is bijective (10.4.11), and that if X/S is of finite presentation, and the endomorphism is a monomorphism, then it is an automorphism (17.9.6). Therefore, a scheme of finite presentation over a base S is a cohopfian object in the category of S-schemes.\n\nThe Ax–Grothendieck theorem may also be used to prove the Garden of Eden theorem, a result that like the Ax–Grothendieck theorem relates injectivity with surjectivity but in cellular automata rather than in algebraic fields. Although direct proofs of this theorem are known, the proof via the Ax–Grothendieck theorem extends more broadly, to automata acting on amenable groups..\n\nSome partial converses to the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem:\n\nA generically surjective polynomial map of n-dimensional affine space over a finitely generated extension of Z or Z/pZ[t] is bijective with a polynomial inverse rational over the same ring (and therefore bijective on affine space of the algebraic closure).\nA generically surjective rational map of n-dimensional affine space over a Hilbertian field is generically bijective with a rational inverse defined over the same field.

      "text": "  \n\nIn elementary algebra, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial  into a sum involving terms of the form , where the exponents  and  are nonnegative integers with , and the coefficient  of each term is a specific positive integer depending on  and .  For example (for ),\n\nThe coefficient  in the term of  is known as the binomial coefficient  or  (the two have the same value). These coefficients for varying  and  can be arranged to form Pascal's triangle. These numbers also arise in combinatorics, where  gives the number of different combinations of  elements that can be chosen from an -element set.  Therefore  is often pronounced as \"n choose b\".\n\nHistory\nSpecial cases of the binomial theorem were known since at least the 4th century BC when Greek mathematician Euclid mentioned the special case of the binomial theorem for exponent 2.  There is evidence that the binomial theorem for cubes was known by the 6th century in India.\n\nBinomial coefficients, as combinatorial quantities expressing the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n without replacement, were of interest to ancient Indian mathematicians.  The earliest known reference to this combinatorial problem is the Chandaḥśāstra by the Indian lyricist Pingala (c. 200 BC), which contains a method for its solution.  The commentator Halayudha from the 10th century AD explains this method using what is now known as Pascal's triangle.  By the 6th century AD, the Indian mathematicians probably knew how to express this as a quotient , and a clear statement of this rule can be found in the 12th century text Lilavati by Bhaskara.\n\nThe first formulation of the binomial theorem and the table of binomial coefficients, to our knowledge, can be found in a work by Al-Karaji, quoted by Al-Samaw'al in his \"al-Bahir\". Al-Karaji described the triangular pattern of the binomial coefficients and also provided a mathematical proof of both the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, using an early form of mathematical induction.   The Persian poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam was probably familiar with the formula to higher orders, although many of his mathematical works are lost.  The binomial expansions of small degrees were known in the 13th century mathematical works of Yang Hui and also Chu Shih-Chieh.  Yang Hui attributes the method to a much earlier 11th century text of Jia Xian, although those writings are now also lost.\n\nIn 1544, Michael Stifel introduced the term \"binomial coefficient\" and showed how to use them to express  in terms of , via \"Pascal's triangle\".  Blaise Pascal studied the eponymous triangle comprehensively in the treatise Traité du triangle arithmétique (1653). However, the pattern of numbers was already known to the European mathematicians of the late Renaissance,  including Stifel, Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, and Simon Stevin.\n\nIsaac Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, valid for any rational exponent.\n\n Theorem statement \nAccording to the theorem, it is possible\nto expand any power of  into a sum of the form\n\nwhere each  is a specific positive integer known as a binomial coefficient. (When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term.  Hence one often sees the right side written as .) This formula is also referred to as the binomial formula or the binomial identity. Using summation notation, it can be written as\n\nThe final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of x and y in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical.\nA simple variant of the binomial formula is obtained by substituting 1 for y, so that it involves only a single variable. In this form, the formula reads\n\nor equivalently\n\n Examples \n\nThe most basic example of the binomial theorem is the formula for the square of :\n\nThe binomial coefficients 1, 2, 1 appearing in this expansion correspond to the second row of Pascal's triangle.  (Note that the top \"1\" of the triangle is considered to be row 0, by convention.) The coefficients of higher powers of  correspond to lower rows of the triangle:\n\nSeveral patterns can be observed from these examples. In general, for the expansion :\n the powers of  start at  and decrease by 1 in each term until they reach 0 (with , often unwritten);\n the powers of  start at 0 and increase by 1 until they reach ; \n the th row of Pascal's Triangle will be the coefficients of the expanded binomial when the terms are arranged in this way;\n the number of terms in the expansion before like terms are combined is the sum of the coefficients and is equal to ; and\n there will be  terms in the expression after combining like terms in the expansion.\n\nThe binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial. For example,\n\nFor a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied by using the form . This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:\n\n Geometric explanation \nthumb|300px|Visualisation of binomial expansion up to the 4th power\nFor positive values of a and b, the binomial theorem with  is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side  can be cut into a square of side a, a square of side b, and two rectangles with sides a and b. With , the theorem states that a cube of side  can be cut into a cube of side a, a cube of side b, three a×a×b rectangular boxes, and three a×b×b rectangular boxes.\n\nIn calculus, this picture also gives a geometric proof of the derivative  if one sets  and  interpreting b as an infinitesimal change in a, then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube,  where the coefficient of the linear term (in ) is  the area of the n faces, each of dimension \n\nSubstituting this into the definition of the derivative via a difference quotient and taking limits means that the higher order terms,  and higher, become negligible, and yields the formula  interpreted as\n\"the infinitesimal rate of change in volume of an n-cube as side length varies is the area of n of its -dimensional faces\".\nIf one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, one obtains Cavalieri's quadrature formula, the integral  – see proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula for details.\n\n Binomial coefficients \n\nThe coefficients that appear in the binomial expansion are called binomial coefficients. These are usually written , and pronounced “n choose k”.\n\n Formulae \nThe coefficient of xn−kyk is given by the formula\n\nwhich is defined in terms of the factorial function n!. Equivalently, this formula can be written\n\nwith k factors in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient  is actually an integer.\n\n Combinatorial interpretation \nThe binomial coefficient  can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose k elements from an n-element set. This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write  as a product\n\nthen, according to the distributive law, there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either x or y from each of the binomials of the product. For example, there will only be one term xn, corresponding to choosing x from each binomial. However, there will be several terms of the form xn−2y2, one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a y. Therefore, after combining like terms, the coefficient of xn−2y2 will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an n-element set.\n\n Proofs \n\n Combinatorial proof \n\n Example \nThe coefficient of xy2 in\n\nequals  because there are three x,y strings of length 3 with exactly two ys, namely,\n\ncorresponding to the three 2-element subsets of { 1, 2, 3 }, namely,\n\nwhere each subset specifies the positions of the y in a corresponding string.\n\n General case \nExpanding  yields the sum of the 2 n products of the form  where each e i is x or y. Rearranging factors shows that each product equals xn−kyk for some k between 0 and n. For a given k, the following are proved equal in succession:\n the number of copies of  in the expansion\n the number of n-character x,y strings having y in exactly k positions\n the number of k-element subsets of \n  (this is either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining  as ).\nThis proves the binomial theorem.\n\n Inductive proof \nInduction yields another proof of the binomial theorem. When , both sides equal 1, since  and .\nNow suppose that the equality holds for a given n; we will prove it for .\nFor , let  denote the coefficient of  in the polynomial .\nBy the inductive hypothesis,  is a polynomial in x and y such that  is  if , and 0 otherwise.\nThe identity\n\nshows that  also is a polynomial in x and y, and\n\nsince if , then  and . Now, the right hand side is\n\nby Pascal's identity.Binomial theorem – inductive proofs  On the other hand, if , then  and , so we get . Thus\n\nwhich is the inductive hypothesis with  substituted for n and so completes the inductive step.\n\n Generalizations \n\n Newton's generalized binomial theorem \n\nAround 1665, Isaac Newton generalized the binomial theorem to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers. (The same generalization also applies to complex exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an infinite series. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials.  However, for an arbitrary number r, one can define\n\nwhere  is the Pochhammer symbol, here standing for a falling factorial.  This agrees with the usual definitions when r is a nonnegative integer.  Then, if x and y are real numbers with |x| > |y|,This is to guarantee convergence. Depending on r, the series may also converge sometimes when |x| = |y|. and r is any complex number, one has\n\nWhen r is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for  are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most  nonzero terms. For other values of r, the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms.\n\nFor example,  gives the following series for the square root:\n\nTaking , the generalized binomial series gives the geometric series formula, valid for :\n\nMore generally, with :\n\nSo, for instance, when ,\n\n Further generalizations \nThe generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where x and y are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume |x| > |y| and define the powers of  and x using a holomorphic branch of log defined on an open disk of radius |x| centered at x.\nThe generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements x and y of a Banach algebra as long as , x is invertible, and ||y/x|| < 1.\n\nA version of the binomial theorem is valid for the following Pochhammer symbol-like family of polynomials: for a given real constant c, define  and  for .  Then\n\nThe case  recovers the usual binomial theorem.\n\nMore generally, a sequence  of polynomials is said to be binomial''' if\n  for all ,\n , and\n  for all , , and .\nAn operator  on the space of polynomials is said to be the basis operator of the sequence  if  and  for all . A sequence  is binomial if and only if its basis operator is a Delta operator. Writing  for the shift by  operator, the Delta operators corresponding to the above \"Pochhammer\" families of polynomials are the backward difference  for , the ordinary derivative for , and the forward difference  for .\n\n Multinomial theorem \n\nThe binomial theorem can be generalized to include powers of sums with more than two terms. The general version is\n\nwhere the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices k1 through km such that the sum of all ki is n. (For each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to n). The coefficients  are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula\n\nCombinatorially, the multinomial coefficient  counts the number of different ways to partition an n-element set into disjoint subsets of sizes .\n\n  Multi-binomial theorem \nIt is often useful when working in more dimensions, to deal with products of binomial expressions. By the binomial theorem this is equal to\n\nThis may be written more concisely, by multi-index notation, as\n\n General Leibniz rule \n\nThe general Leibniz rule gives the th derivative of a product of two functions in a form similar to that of the binomial theorem:\n\nHere, the superscript  indicates the th derivative of a function.  If one sets  and , and then cancels the common factor of  from both sides of the result, the ordinary binomial theorem is recovered.\n\n Applications \n\n Multiple-angle identities \nFor the complex numbers the binomial theorem can be combined with de Moivre's formula to yield multiple-angle formulas for the sine and cosine. According to De Moivre's formula,\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos(nx) and sin(nx). For example, since\n\nDe Moivre's formula tells us that\n\nwhich are the usual double-angle identities. Similarly, since\n\nDe Moivre's formula yields\n\nIn general,\n\nand\n\n Series for e \nThe number e is often defined by the formula\n\nApplying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual infinite series for e. In particular:\n\nThe kth term of this sum is\n\nAs n → ∞, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore\n\nThis indicates that e can be written as a series:\n\nIndeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an increasing function of n, it follows from the monotone convergence theorem for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to e.\n\n Probability \nThe binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials  with probability of success  all not happening is  A useful upper bound for this quantity is . \n\n The binomial theorem in abstract algebra \n\nFormula (1) is valid more generally for any elements x and y'' of a semiring satisfying . The theorem is true even more generally: alternativity suffices in place of associativity.\n\nThe binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the polynomial sequence   is of binomial type.\n\n In popular culture \n The binomial theorem is mentioned in the Major-General's Song in the comic opera The Pirates of Penzance.\n Professor Moriarty is described by Sherlock Holmes as having written a treatise on the binomial theorem.\n The Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, using the heteronym Álvaro de Campos, wrote that \"Newton's Binomial is as beautiful as the Venus de Milo.
