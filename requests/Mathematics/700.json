      "text": "[[File:Feodor Molin.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Theodor Molien (ca 1920)]]\n\n'''Theodor Georg Andreas Molien''' ({{lang-ru|Fedor Eduardovich Molin}}; {{OldStyleDate|10 September|1861|29 August}} in [[Riga]] – 25 December 1941 in [[Tomsk]]) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic-German]] [[mathematician]]. He was born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], which at that time was a part of [[Russian Empire]]. Molien studied [[associative algebra]]s and [[polynomial]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of finite [[Group (mathematics)|groups]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Youth in Riga===\nTheodor Molien's father Eduard Molien was a teacher at the Riga Governorate Gymnasium. Theodor entered that gymnasium in 1872 and graduated in 1879.\n\n===Studies and work in Dorpat===\nIn January 1880 Molien entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] (now University of Tartu) as a student of [[astronomy]]. To support his studies his family also moved to [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (now Tartu). In October 1883 the council of the university gave him the degree of a candidate of astronomy. His thesis \"Bahn des Cometen 1880 III\" was published in Astronomische Nachrichten No. 2510. His further work was supervised by the head of the chair of [[applied mathematics]] of the University of Dorpat [[Anders Lindstedt]]. In a report to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat Lindstedt acknowledges Molien as having unquestionably exceptional scientific talent (''unzweifelhaft ungewöhnliche wissenschaftliche Begabung'').\n\nIn the autumn of 1883, as part of his studies Molien was sent to [[Leipzig]] for three semesters. There he attended lectures by [[Felix Klein]] on different fields of mathematics and worked in his seminar. He also attended lectures of [[Carl Neumann]], [[Eduard Study]], [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Georg Scheffers]]. At that time Klein was dealing with deep problems of [[algebra]] and [[complex analysis|theory of functions of a complex variable]]. Following his suggestion, Molien started to study linear transformations of [[elliptic function]]s. The obtained results he submitted to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat as a master thesis titled \"Ueber die lineare Transformation der elliptischen Functionen\". In spring 1885 Molien passed the master's exams and after the defence in the autumn of 1885 he obtained the scientific degree of a Master of Mathematics. In November 1885 he became a docent at the University of Dorpat. This position he held for 15 years.\n\nSummers (that were free from teaching) of 1886, 1888 and 1889 Molien spent in scientific centers of [[Germany]]. His interest concentrated on so-called higher complex numbers (nowadays called [[hypercomplex number]]s). His studies resulted in his article \"Über Systeme höherer komplexer Zahlen\" (\"On systems of higher complex numbers\"), published in 1891 in [[Mathematische Annalen]].\n\nOn 30 September 1892, Molien defended his dissertation, also titled \"Über Systeme höherer komplexer Zahlen\". He got the degree of a doctor of pure mathematics. The importance of his work was acknowledged by [[Georg Frobenius]], [[Sophus Lie]] and other mathematicians. One of the main results of his dissertation sounds in modern terms as follows: every simple [[associative algebra]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s is isomorphic to the algebra of square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of a suitable order over the same field.\n\nFor his scientific achievements, in 1892 Molien was elected a member of [[Moscow Mathematical Society]]. In 1894 French mathematicians awarded him a golden medal dedicated to the seventieth birthday of Charles Hermite. During Dorpat years, Molien had mathematical correspondence with [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] and [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]].\n\nSince the University of Dorpat had only one professorship in pure mathematics, Molien had to stay for years at docent's position. Being a docent in Dorpat, Molien prepared and gave different lecture courses: Theory of [[analytic function|analytic]] and [[elliptic function]]s, modern geometry and algebra, theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, [[number theory]], [[projective geometry]], theory of [[quaternion]]s, [[history of mathematics]] and others. Some of these courses were new for the university.\n\nIn 1887 Russian powers decided to change the language of secondary and higher education in Baltic governorates from [[German language|German]] to [[Russian language|Russian]] with the deadline 1 January 1895. With the purpose of improving his Russian language, Molien was sent to [[Moscow]] for the year 1892.\n\n===Career in Tomsk===\nOnly in December 1900 Molien was given a professor's position, but not in [[Tartu|Dorpat]], but in the starting [[Tomsk Polytechnic University|Tomsk Technological Institute]] in [[Siberia]]. He became the first professor of mathematics in Siberia. His was given a task of organizing teaching mathematics at the institute. In [[Tomsk]], besides giving courses in [[mathematical analysis]] and [[differential equation]]s, he wrote textbooks and exercise books on these subjects, and also established a mathematical library at the institute.\n\nKnown for his oppositional political views, he had to retire in 1913. Since 1914, Molien was a professor at higher Siberian courses for women in Tomsk, and when in 1917 the faculty of physics and mathematics was opened at the [[Tomsk State University]], he got a professorship there, and stayed at that university until his death on 25 December 1941.\n\nIn Tomsk Molien spent 41 years of his life. These years were scientifically not as fruitful as earlier years.\n\nHe got the title of Honoured Worker of Science.\n\n==Works==\n*Bahn des Cometen 1880 III (candidates thesis), Astron. Nachr.

In 1897-1898 he was in correspondence with a leading Russian chess player [[Mikhail Chigorin]]. He was one of the strongest chess players in [[Tartu|Dorpat]] and was particularly known for his blindfold play (Ken Whyld, personal communication, 1995). He was president of the Dorpat chess club, and several of his games were published in the chess journal ''Baltische Schachblätter'' (edited by [[Friedrich Amelung]]). In 1898 Molien published four chess studies.\n\nTo 1895 dates his manuscript \"On theory of assigning prizes in tournaments\".\n\nMolien had also talent for languages. He knew [[German language|German]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[French language|French]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] already before he entered gymnasium where he learned [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]]. Later he learned [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Molien series]]\n* [[List_of_Baltic_Germans#Scientists|List of Baltic German scientists]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Molin}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Molien, Theodor}}\n[[Category:1861 births]]\n[[Category:1941 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Riga]]\n[[Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia]]\n[[Category:Baltic-German people]]\n[[Category:Imperial Russian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Soviet mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Group theorists]]\n[[Category:19th-century Russian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:University of Tartu alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Tartu faculty]]\n[[Category:Tomsk State University faculty]]\n[[Category:Tomsk Polytechnic University faculty]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 2nd class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 3rd class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 2nd class]]\n[[Category:Tomsk State Pedagogical University faculty]]"

His early work with Krein included development of the theory of separation of roots of algebraic equations. Naimark also began to take interest in pedagogical techniques at this time, an interest that would stay with him for the rest of his life.<ref name=\":2\" /> After moving to the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] for his D.Sc. Naimark worked intensively on spectral theory, extensions of symmetric operators, and the representation theory of locally compact operators.<ref name=\":2\" /> His collaboration with [[Israel Gelfand]] in the 1930s and 1940s led to several fundamental results in functional analysis, including the 1943 [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]] and the [[GNS theorem]].\n\nDuring his service in [[World War II]] Naimark wrote several papers on seismology, and helping to develop the [[Spectral theory of ordinary differential equations]]. He worked especially on second-order singular differential operators with a continuous spectrum, using eigenfunctions to describe their [[Decomposition of spectrum (functional analysis)|spectral decompositions]], and studying the concept of a spectral singularity. His results are summarized in the monograph ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oFnCoQEACAAJ Linear Differential Operators]'', which was published in 1954.\n\nIn 1956 Naimark published his monograph ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cN7BQgAACAAJ Normed Rings]'', which gave the first comprehensive treatment of Banach algebras, and was enormously influential in the development of the field.<ref name=\":2\" /> His 1958 monograph ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6oPiBQAAQBAJ Linear representations of the Lorentz group]'' helped to develop the theory of representations of the fundamental series of the complex [[classical group]]s, beginning with SL(2,C). With Zhelobenko he later generalized these results to all complex semisimple Lie groups. In the 1960s Naimark's interests focused more intensively on the representation theory of groups and algebras in spaces with an indefinite metric, which became the subject of his last (1976) monograph, ''The theory of group representations''.\n\nNaimark's name is associated with several important ideas in functional analysis:\n* The [[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] on the representation of [[C*-algebra]]s by [[bounded operator]]s\n* [[Naimark's dilation theorem]] on extensions of symmetric operators\n* The [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] (the GNS construction) establishing a correspondence between cyclic *-representations and linear functionals\n* [[Naimark's problem]] on the irreducible representations of C*-algebras in terms of compact operators on a Hilbert space.\n* [[Naimark equivalence]] of two group representations on a Banach space\n\n==Selected publications==\n* Unitary representations of the classical group (with [[I.

She was the youngest of three children of Hermann and Katharina von Caemmerer.  As a result of her father's death in the first days of the [[First World War]], the family income was small, and from the age of thirteen she was coaching school children.<ref name=\"ADB Neumann\">{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Kenneth F.|title=Neumann, Hanna (1914–1971)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/neumann-hanna-11224|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=MUP|accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hanna Neumann|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Neumann_Hanna.html|work=MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive|accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter two years at a private school she entered the Auguste-Viktoria-Schule, a girls' grammar school ([[Realgymnasium]]), in 1922.  She graduated in early 1932 and then entered the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].  The lecture courses in mathematics that she took in her first year were: Introduction to Higher Mathematics given by [[Georg Feigl]]; Analytical Geometry and Projective Geometry both given by [[Ludwig Bieberbach]], Differential and Integral Calculus given by [[Erhard Schmidt]], and the Theory of Numbers given by [[Friedrich Schur]].  She also took formal courses in physics, and attended lectures in psychology, literature and law.\nAs a result of her first year work, Hanna was awarded three-quarters' remission of fees and a position as a part-time assistant in the Mathematical Institute's library.<ref name=AAS>{{cite web|title=Hanna Neumann 1914-1971|url=https://www.science.org.au/fellowship/fellows/biographical-memoirs/hanna-neumann-1914-1971|work=Australian Academy of Science Biographical Memoirs|last=Newman|first= Michael Frederick|last2=Wall|first2= Gordon Elliott|accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ADB Neumann\">{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Kenneth F.|title=Neumann, Hanna (1914–1971)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/neumann-hanna-11224|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=MUP|accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nA friendship between Hanna and [[Bernhard Neumann]] began in January 1933.  In March 1933, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power and in August 1933, Bernhard, who was [[Jews|Jewish]], moved to [[Cambridge]], [[England]].  She visited Bernhard in [[London]] at Easter 1934 and they became secretly engaged.  After this she returned to Germany to continue her studies.<ref name=AAS/>\n\nIn her second year Neumann was part of a group of students who tried to prevent Nazi disruption of Jewish academics' lectures by ensuring that only genuine students attended.  She lost her job in the Mathematical Institute, presumably as a result of such activities. However she had by then been awarded, and continued to earn for the rest of her course, full remission of fees.<ref name=AAS/>\n\nIn the remainder of her undergraduate degree, she studied mathematics, physics and philosophy.  She completed her studies in 1936 with distinctions in the [[Staatsexamen]] in mathematics and physics. She began studying for her [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1937, under the supervision of [[Helmut Hasse]].<ref name=AAS/>\n\nDuring this time Bernhard and Hanna corresponded anonymously through friends, and were only able to meet once, in Denmark in 1936 when Bernhard was travelling to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Oslo]].  In July 1938, Hanna moved to England.  She married Bernhard in December 1938 in [[Cardiff]].  They went on to have five children.  The Neumanns moved to [[Oxford]] in 1940.\n\nNeumann completed her D Phil. in group theory at the [[Society of Home Students, Oxford]] in 1944 under [[Olga Taussky-Todd]]. Her thesis was entitled 'Sub-group Structure of Free Products of Groups with an Amalgamated Subgroup'.

She was able to introduce into the first year course, which had till then been entirely problem-oriented, a small strand of one lecture a week of an introduction to mathematics in the style of Feigl-Rohrbach. The later-year algebra courses much more thoroughly reflected her own interests and views.

Praeger received BSc (1969) and [[Master's degree|MSc]] degrees from the [[University of Queensland]] (1974), and doctorate from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1973 under direction of [[Peter M. Neumann]]. She has published widely and has advised 27 PhD students (as of March 2018). She is currently Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Western Australia]]. She is best known for her works in [[group theory]], [[algebraic graph theory]] and [[combinatorial design]]s.\n\n==Education==\nPraeger completed her high school education at [[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]]. After graduating high school, Praeger went to the government vocational guidance section to inquire about how she could further study mathematics. The vocational guidance officer she spoke with tried to discourage her from studying mathematics further,<ref name=interview>{{cite web\n|url=http://science.org.au/scientists/interviews/p/cp.html\n|title=Interviews with Australian Scientists: Professor Cheryl Praeger Mathematician\n|publisher=[[Australian Academy of Science]]\n|accessdate=16 April 2013\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408224736/http://www.science.org.au/scientists/interviews/p/cp.html\n|archivedate=8 April 2013\n|df=dmy-all\n}}</ref> suggesting she become a teacher or a nurse because two other girls who came to him wanting to study math weren't able to pass their courses.<ref name=interview/> He reluctantly showed her an engineering course description, but she felt it didn't have enough mathematics. So she left without getting much information that day, but did continue on to receive her bachelor's and master's degrees from the [[University of Queensland]].\n\nHaving met several women on the mathematics staff during her undergraduate studies, the prospect of becoming a mathematician didn't seem strange to her. During her first and second years she did honours studies in mathematics and physics, choosing to continue in mathematics after her second year.<ref name=interview/> After completing her education at University of Queensland she was offered a research scholarship at [[Australian National University|ANU]] but chose instead to take the Commonwealth Scholarship to the [[University of Oxford]] and attended [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]]. At that point she knew she wanted to study algebra.\n\nAfter earning her doctorate in 1973, she obtained a research fellowship at ANU. She had her first opportunity at teaching regular classes at the [[University of Virginia]] during the semester she worked there. Afterwards, she returned to ANU, where she met her future husband, John Henstridge, who was studying statistics. She was later offered a short-term position at the [[University of Western Australia]], which turned into a long term position, where she currently works today.<ref name=interview/> In 1989 she received the degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Western Australia for her work on permutation groups and algebraic graph theory.\n\n==Career==\n\nHer career has been largely the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Western Australia.  She was appointed full Professor in 1983 and was Head of the Department of Mathematics 1992–1994, inaugural Dean of Postgraduate Research Studies 1996–1998, Chair Promotions and Tenure Committee

He became known to the general public following his coauthoring a paper on what is popularly known as [[Bible code]], the supposed coded messaging in the Hebrew text of the [[Torah]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kmph.com/story/16664855/kmph-special-report-bible-codes-2012 |title=Secret Codes In The Bible And The Torah?

His mother was Jewish and from [[Riga]], the only of nine siblings that survived the war; the others were killed in [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]] and other places. His father Aaron was a Jewish mathematician from [[Belarus]]; his wife, children and all of his relatives were killed during [[The Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://satori.lv/raksts/11284/Lolita_Tomsone/Serkocins_Ripss |author=Lolita Tomsone |title=Sērkociņš Ripss |publisher=Satori |language=Latvian |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> Rips was the first high school student from Latvia to participate in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. In January 1969 he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast---then illegal in the USSR---of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student [[Jan Palach]]. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the [[University of Latvia]], attempted [[self-immolation]] in a protest against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked cloths ablaze. A group of bystanders were able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips' neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated. The secret service wanted to make sure he was not a member of a group of would-be self-immolators. He was then incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. It was only after his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a following wave of petitions by Western mathematicians that Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, under further protests by mathematicians in the U.S., he was allowed to emigrate to [[Israel]] in 1972.\n\nAfter recovering from his wounds and finishing his Ph.D., Rips joined the Department of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the  [[Aharon Karzir Prize]]. In 1979, Rips received the [[Erdős Prize]] from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994.\n\nSince completing his Ph.D., Rips has been on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University where he holds the position of Professor. His current research interests concentrate on geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees.\n\nRips' work on [[Group action (mathematics)|group actions]] on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees is mostly unpublished. The [[Rips machine]], in the hands of Rips and his student [[Zlil Sela]], has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the [[Group isomorphism problem|isomorphism problem]] for [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\n==''The Bible Code'' controversy==\nIn the late seventies, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah. In 1994, Rips, together with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg, published an article in the journal ''[[Statistical Science]]'', \"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\", which claimed the discovery of encoded messages in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/2004/08/18/ft/article9PRR2.html |title=Botschaften des Allmächtigen oder zurechtgeschusterte Daten? |date=18 August 2004 |work=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122041752/http://www.nzz.ch/2004/08/18/ft/article9PRR2.html |archivedate=22 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1997 book ''[[The Bible Code]]'' by journalist [[Michael Drosnin]]. While Rips originally claimed that he agreed with Drosnin's findings, he later distanced himself from his interpretations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1997/06/08/seek-and-ye-shall-find.html |title=Seek And Ye Shall Find |last=Begley |first=Sharon |date=8 June 1997 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> Since Drosnin's book, [[Bible code]]s have been a subject of controversy, with the claims being criticized by [[Brendan McKay]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/dilugim/torah.html |title=Torah Codes |website=cs.anu.edu.au |access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> An early supporter of Rips' theories was [[Robert Aumann]], Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 2005, who headed a commission overseeing Rips' experiments attempting to prove the existence of a secret code from God in the [[Torah]]. Eventually, Aumann abandoned the idea and withdrew his support from Rips.\n\n==Statistical criticism==\nA popular puzzle is to find words in a square array of letters that conform to a pattern, for example, a word may be spelled diagonally moving in a north west direction, or perhaps left-to-right taking every second letter. One can also look for hidden words\nin printed books, and this is what was done in ''[[The Bible Code]]''. The more patterns that are allowed, the more words that can be\nfound, and elementary statistics can be used to estimate the probabilities of finding certain hidden messages. The statistician\nJeffrey S. Rosenthal shows in his book <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNX7cRhWVi0 |title=Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities |access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> that hidden messages are expected and\nhence should not be seen as divine messages, or predictions of the future. This point was illustrated by [[Brendan McKay]] by finding messages in text of Moby Dick that supposedly \"predict\" future assassinations of famous people.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/moby.html |title=Assassinations Foretold in Moby Dick! |access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Eliyahu Rips shared an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg from Israel, and Michael Drosnin from the United States, for their claimed statistical discovery of hidden equidistant letter sequences in the Bible.\n\n==Selected papers==\n* {{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Rips |title=Group actions on '''R'''-trees |work=preprint}}\n* {{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Rips |title=Subgroups of small cancellation groups |journal=Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society |volume=14 |year=1982 |issue=1 |pages=45–47 |doi=10.1112/blms/14.1.45}}\n* {{Cite journal |last=Rips |first=E. |last2=Sela |first2=Z. |title=Structure and rigidity in hyperbolic groups.

Vogt, Anne</ref> Here he became fluent in German.\n\n==Education==\nIn October 1894, Schur attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], with concentration in mathematics and physics. In 1901, he graduated ''summa cum laude'' under Frobenius and [[Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs]] with his dissertation ''On a class of matrices that can be assigned to a given matrix'',<ref>Schur, Issai. Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen. Doctoral dissertation, Universität Berlin, 1901; reprinted in Brauer k Rohrbach [71, Band I, pp. 1–72 (1973)]</ref> which contains a general theory of the representation of [[linear group]]s. According to Vogt,<ref>vgl. Vogt, Anne</ref> he began to use the name ''Issai'' at this time. Schur thought that his chance of success in the Russian Empire was rather poor,<ref>Chandler, Bruce; Magnus, Wilhelm. The History of Combinatorial Group Theory: A Case Study in the History of Ideas. Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 9. Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982.</ref> and because he spoke German so perfectly, he remained in Berlin. He graduated in 1903 and was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. Schur held a position as professor at the Berlin University for the ten years from 1903 to 1913.<ref>vgl. Biographie der Leopoldino Carolina</ref>\n\nIn 1913 he accepted an appointment as associate professor and successor of [[Felix Hausdorff]] at the [[University of Bonn]]. In the following years Frobenius tried various ways to get Schur back to Berlin. Among other things, Schur's name was mentioned in a letter dated June 27, 1913<ref>Hermann Weyl: Nachlaß. Handschriften und Nachlässe, ETH Bibliothek, 1006:1.</ref> from Frobenius to Robert Gnehm (the School Board President of the ETH)  as a possible successor to [[Carl Friedrich Geiser]].<ref>Carl Friedrich Geiser (1843–1934), der bei Ludwig Schläfli in Bern promoviert hatte, war von 1873 bis 1913 ordentlicher Professor am Eidgenössischen Polytechnikum in Zürich.</ref> Frobenius complained that they had never followed his advice before and then said: \"That is why I can't even recommend Prof. J. Schur (now in Bonn) to you. He's too good for Zurich, and should be my successor in Berlin\". [[Hermann Weyl]] got the job in Zurich. The efforts of Frobenius were finally successful in 1916, when Schur succeeded Johannes Knoblauch as adjunct professor. Frobenius died a year later, on August 3, 1917. Schur and Carathéodory were both named as the frontrunners for his successor. But they chose [[Constantin Carathéodory]] in the end. In 1919 Schur finally received a personal professorship, and in 1921 he took over the chair of the retired [[Friedrich Hermann Schottky]]. In 1922, he was also added to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==During the time of National Socialism==\nAfter the takeover by the [[National Socialists]] and the elimination of the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were \"Jewish\" in origin; a subsequent regulation<ref>3. Verordnung zur Durchführung des Berufsbeamtengesetzes. Vom 6. Mai 1933, RGBl.I S.245f.</ref> extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system.

Der Ehe entsprossen zwei Kinder Georg und Hilde. Georg, der etwas älter als Hilde war, studierte Physik und war später als Versicherungsmathematiker in Israel tätig.</ref> As a result, Issai Schur visited his daughter in Bern several times. In Zurich he met often with [[George Pólya]], with whom he was on friendly terms since before the First World War.<ref>George Pólya (1887–1985) hatte sich nach seinem Studium in Budapest 1914 und nach Aufenthalten in Göttingen und Paris an der ETH habilitiert. 1928 wurde er zum ordentlichen Professor ernannt.

Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer.<ref>\"Long after the war, I talked to Grunsky about that remark and he literally started to cry: You know what I did? I sent him a postcard to contratulate him on his sixtieth birthday. I admired him so much and was very respectful in that card. How lonely he must have been to remember such a small thing\", Schiffer, Menachem Max; Issai Schur. Some Personal Reminiscences (1986); 1998 in: Begehr, H. (Hrsg.), Mathematik in Berlin. Geschichte und Dokumentation, 1998 Aachen.</ref> The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo,<ref>Siehe dazu und für das Folgende: Alfred Brauers Gedenkrede</ref> in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration: emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day it does not seem to be clear who were the donors.\n\nSchur was able to leave Germany in early 1939.<ref>Vergleiche den Brief des Reichsministers für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung an Issai Schur vom 24.

Seite lxxxi</ref> His health, however, was already severely compromised. He traveled in the company of a nurse to his daughter in Bern, where his wife also followed a few days later. There they remained for several weeks and then emigrated to Palestine.  Two years later, on his 66th birthday, on January 10, 1941, he died in Tel Aviv of a heart attack.\n\n==Work==\nSchur continued the work of his teacher Frobenius with many important works for [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]]. In addition, he published important results and elegant proofs of known results in almost all branches of classical algebra and number theory. His collected works<ref>veröffentlicht von Alfred Brauer und Hans Rohrbach</ref> are an impressive proof of this. There, his work on the theory of integral equations and infinite series can be found.\n\n===Linear groups===\nIn his doctoral thesis ''Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen'' Issai Schur determined the polynomial representations of the general linear group <math>GL(n, \\mathbb{C})</math> on the field <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> of [[complex number]]s. The results and methods of this work are still relevant today.<ref>See Festschrift der DMV Seite 549</ref> In his book, [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J.A.

Green writes, \"This remarkable work (of Schur) contained many very original ideas, developed with superb algebraic skill. Schur showed that these (polynomial) representations are completely reducible, that each one is \"homogeneous\" of some degree <math>r \\geq 0</math>, and that es equivalence types of irreducible polynomial representations of <math>GL_n(\\mathbb{C})</math>, of fixed homogeneous degree <math>r</math>, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions <math>\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n)</math> of <math>r</math> into not more than <math>n</math> parts. Moreover, Schur showed that the character of an irreducible representation of type <math>\\lambda</math> is given by a certain symmetric function <math>{\\underline{S}}_{\\lambda}</math> in <math>n</math> variables, since described as a Schur function.'' According to Green, the methods of Schur's dissertation today are important for the theory of algebraic groups.\n\nIn 1927 Schur, in his work ''On the rational representations of the general linear group'', gave new proofs for the main results of his dissertation. If <math>V</math> is the natural <math>n</math>-dimensional <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> vector space on which <math>GL(n, \\mathbb{C})</math> operates, and if <math>r</math> is a natural number, then the <math>r</math>-fold tensor product <math>V^{\\otimes r}</math> over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> is a <math>GL(n, \\mathbb {C})</math>-module, on which the symmetric group  <math>S_r</math> of degree <math>r</math> also operates by permutation of the tensor factors of each generator <math>v_1 \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes v_r</math> of <math>V^{\\otimes r}</math>. By exploiting these <math>S_r - GL(n, \\mathbb{C})</math>-bimodule actions on <math>V^{\\otimes r}</math>, Schur manages to find elegant proofs of his sentences. This work of Schur was once very well known.\n\n===Professorship in Berlin===\nSchur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years.<ref>vgö. Chandler, Bruce; Magnus, Wilhelm.</ref> Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory).<ref>Briining, Jochen; Ferus, Dirk; Siegmund-Schultze; Reinhard.

At the same time he asked that the formal invitation should come from President Rohn, ''comme le prof. Schur doit obtenir l'autorisation du ministère compétent de donner ces conférences''. George Pólya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on December 16.<ref>''Protokoller der Abteilung IX, Mathematik und Physik.''

November 1960 anlässlich der Schur-Gedenkfeier im Rahmen der 150-Jahrfeier der Universität Berlin. Siehe Issai Schur: Gesammelte Abhandlungen, Seiten v–xiv. Alfred Brauer hat 1928 bei Schur promoviert.</ref> ''As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation – During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.''\n\nHeinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held – as is clear from oral statements and also from letters – Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: ''Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. – If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him''.\n\nSchur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs. The testimony of Hopf is in accordance with statements of Schur's former students in Berlin, by Walter Ledermann and Bernhard Neumann.<ref>Siehe ''Interview with Bernhard Neumann'', [[Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society]], 39, March 2001, 9–11; Walter Ledermann: ''Issai Schur and his school in Berlin'', Bull.

He received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1968, where his adviser was [[Charles W. Curtis]]. Seitz specializes in the study of algebraic and finite groups. Seitz has been active in the effort to exploit the relationship between algebraic groups and the finite groups of Lie type, in order to study the structure and representations of groups in the latter class. Such information is important in its own right, but was also critical in the classification of the finite simple groups, a major achievement of 20th century mathematics. Seitz made contributions to the classification of finite simple groups, such as those containing standard subgroups of Lie type. Following the classification, he pioneered the study of the subgroup structure of simple algebraic groups, and as an application went a long way towards solving the maximal subgroup problem for finite groups. For this work he received the Creativity Award from the National Science Foundation in 1991.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in Santa Monica, California, graduated from University High School in 1961.

She is a professor of mathematics at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]],{{r|cant}} and has been the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Pi Mu Epsilon Journal]]'' since 1999.{{r|pme}}\n\n==Education and career==\nServatius is originally from [[Graz]] in [[Austria]].{{r|standard}}\nAs a student at an all-girl gymnasium in Graz that specialized in language studies rather than mathematics, her interest in mathematics was sparked by her participation in a national [[mathematical olympiad]],{{r|cant}}\nand she went on to earn master's degrees in mathematics and physics at the [[University of Graz]].{{r|pme}}\n\nShe became a high school mathematics and science teacher in [[Leibnitz]]. {{r|standard}} She moved to the US in 1981, to begin doctoral studies at [[Syracuse University]].{{r|cant}} She completed her Ph.D. in 1987,{{r|mgp}} and joined the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] {{r|standard}}  faculty in the same year.{{r|cant}} Her dissertation, ''Planar Rigidity'', was supervised by Jack Graver.{{r|mgp}}\n\n==Contributions==\nWhile still in Austria, Servatius began working on [[combinatorial group theory]], and her first publication (appearing while she was a graduate student) is in that subject.{{r|cant}}{{ran|Z}}\nShe switched to the theory of [[structural rigidity]] for her doctoral research,\nand later became the author (with Jack Graver and Herman Servatius) of the book ''Combinatorial Rigidity'' (1993).{{r|comb}}{{ran|G}}\nAnother well-cited paper of hers in this area characterizes the [[planar graph|planar]] [[Laman graph]]s, the minimally rigid graphs that can be embedded without crossings in the plane, as the graphs of [[pseudotriangle|pseudotriangulations]], partitions of a plane region into subregions with three convex corners studied in [[computational geometry]].{{ran|H}}\n\nServatius is also the co-editor of a book on [[matroid|matroid theory]].{{ran|B}}\nWith [[Tomaž Pisanski]] she wrote the book ''Configurations from a Graphical Viewpoint'' (2013), on [[Configuration (geometry)|configurations]] of points and lines in the plane with the same number of points touching each two lines and the

The paper introduced the notion of what is now commonly referred to as ''Stallings subgroup graph'' for describing subgroups of free groups, and also introduced a foldings technique (used for approximating and algorithmically obtaining the subgroup graphs) and the notion of what is now known as a ''Stallings folding''. Most classical results regarding subgroups of free groups acquired simple and straightforward proofs in this set-up and Stallings' method has become the standard tool in the theory for studying the subgroup structure of free groups, including both the algebraic and algorithmic questions (see <ref name=\"KWM\">Ilya Kapovich and Alexei Myasnikov.

He also had visiting positions at the [[University of Chicago]] (1960–61), the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (1962–63, 1968–69, spring 1981), the [[University of Tokyo]] (spring 1971), and the [[University of Padua]] (1994).  Suzuki received his Ph.D in 1952 from the University of Tokyo, despite having moved to the United States the previous year.  He was the first to attack the [[Feit–Thompson theorem|Burnside conjecture]], that every finite non-abelian simple group has even order.\n\nA notable achievement was his discovery in 1960 of the [[Suzuki groups]], an infinite family of the only non-abelian simple groups whose order is not divisible by 3. The smallest, of order 29120, was the first simple group of order less than 1 million to be discovered since [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|Dickson]]'s list of 1900.\n\nHe classified several classes of simple groups of small rank, including the [[CIT-group]]s and [[C-group]]s and [[CA-group]]s.\n\nThere is also a sporadic simple group called the [[Suzuki sporadic group|Suzuki group]], which he announced in 1968.  The [[Jacques Tits|Tits]] [[ovoid (projective geometry)|ovoid]] is also referred to as the Suzuki ovoid.\n\nHe wrote several textbooks in Japanese.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Baer-Suzuki theorem]]\n*[[Bender-Suzuki theorem]]\n*[[Brauer-Suzuki theorem]]\n*[[Brauer-Suzuki-Wall theorem]]\n\n==Publications==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Brauer | first1 = R. | authorlink = Richard Brauer | last2 = Suzuki | first2 = M. | year = 1959 | title = On finite groups of even order whose 2-Sylow group is a quaternion group | url = | journal = Proc.

At the time, this achievement was noted in ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/lam/paper/html/NYTimes.html New York Times article, April 26, 1959.</ref>.\n\nThompson became a figure in the progress toward the [[classification of finite simple groups]].  In 1963, he and [[Walter Feit]] proved that all [[Abelian group|nonabelian]] finite [[simple group]]s are of even [[Order (group theory)|order]] (the ''[[Feit–Thompson theorem|Odd Order Paper]]'', filling a whole issue of the ''[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]]''). This work was recognised by the award of the 1965 [[Cole Prize]] in Algebra of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. His [[N-group (finite group theory)|N-group papers]] classified all finite simple groups for which the [[Centralizer and normalizer|normalizer]] of every non-identity [[Solvable group|solvable]] [[subgroup]] is solvable. This included, as a by-product, the classification of all minimal finite simple groups (simple groups for which every proper subgroup is solvable). This work had some influence on later developments in the classification of finite simple groups, and was quoted in the citation by [[Richard Brauer]] for the award of Thompson's Fields Medal in 1970 (Proceedings of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[Nice]], [[France]], 1970).\n\nThe [[Thompson group (finite)|Thompson group]] ''Th'' is one of the 26 [[sporadic group|sporadic]] finite simple groups. Thompson also made major contributions to the [[inverse Galois problem]]. He found a criterion for a finite group to be a [[Galois group]], that in particular implies that the [[Monster group|monster simple group]] is a Galois group.\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1971, Thompson was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].   In 1982, he was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize of the [[London Mathematical Society]], and in 1988, he received the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Science]] from the [[University of Oxford]].

The related theory of [[(B, N) pair]]s is a basic tool in the theory of [[groups of Lie type]]. Of particular importance is his classification of all irreducible buildings of spherical type and rank at least three, which involved classifying all [[polar space]]s of rank at least three. The existence of these buildings initially depended on the existence of a [[group of Lie type]] in each case, but in joint work with [[Mark Ronan]] he constructed those of rank at least four independently, yielding the groups directly. In the rank-2 case spherical building are [[generalized n-gons]], and in joint work with Richard Weiss he classified these when they admit a suitable group of symmetries (the so-called [[Moufang polygon]]s). In collaboration with [[François Bruhat]] he developed the theory of affine buildings, and later he classified all irreducible buildings of affine type and rank at least four.\n\nAnother of his well-known theorems is the \"[[Tits alternative]]\":  if ''G'' is a [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] [[subgroup]] of a [[linear group]], then either ''G'' has a [[solvable subgroup]] of [[finite index]] or it has a [[free subgroup]] of rank 2.\n\nThe [[Tits group]] and the [[Tits–Koecher construction]] are named after him.\nHe introduced the [[Kneser–Tits conjecture]].\n\n== Publications ==\n*{{Cite journal | last1=Tits | first1=Jacques | title=Algebraic and abstract simple groups | year=1964 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=80 | pages=313–329 | mr=0164968 | jstor=1970394 | doi=10.2307/1970394 | issue=2 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Vieth, H. Ulm, [[Gottfried Köthe]] in 1930.]]\n'''Helmut Ulm''' (born June 21, 1908 in [[Gelsenkirchen]]; died June 13, 1975) was a [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] who established the classification of [[countable set|countable]] [[periodic group|periodic]] [[abelian group]]s by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.\n\n== Short biography ==\n\nHelmut Ulm's father was an elementary school teacher in [[Elberfeld]]. After finishing high school in [[Wuppertal]] in 1926, he attended the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1926–1927), [[University of Jena|Jena]] (1927) and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1927–1930), where he studied mathematics and physics, attending the lectures of [[Richard Courant]], [[:de:Erich Bessel-Hagen|Erich Bessel-Hagen]], [[Felix Hausdorff]], and the joint Hausdorff–[[Otto Toeplitz]] seminar. He graduated [[summa cum laude]] in 1930 with a thesis about countable periodic abelian groups (1933). In 1933–1935 he was an assistant in Göttingen and worked with [[Wilhelm Magnus]] and [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] editing [[David Hilbert]]'s ''Collected Works''. His [[Habilitationsschrift]] developed a generalization of the [[elementary divisor]] theory to infinite matrices, continuing ideas of Ulm's teacher Toeplitz.\nIt was submitted in Münster in 1936 and refereed by [[Heinrich Behnke]], [[Gottfried Köthe]], F. K. Schmidt, and [[B. L. van der Waerden]].  Ulm's promotion was delayed, apparently, due to his anti-[[Nazi]] views.\n\nFrom 1935 until his retirement in 1974 Ulm worked at the [[University of Münster]], as an assistant, docent, and eventually professor (1968). Besides his three important papers on the classification of infinite abelian groups, Ulm published only a few notes in the proceedings of the Münster mathematical seminar, one of which dealt with solution of systems of linear equations by a computer. He suffered from poor health. During the [[World War II]], Ulm worked as a [[cryptographer]]. After the war he mostly taught courses in applied mathematics and supervised several Ph.D. theses; those of G. Tillmann (1952) and G. Roth (1961) were close to his old work on infinite-dimensional linear algebra and infinite groups.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Helmut Ulm, ''Zur Theorie der abzählbar-unendlichen Abelschen Gruppen''.

A ''marked metric graph'' consists of a [[homotopy equivalence]] between a wedge of ''n'' circles and a finite connected graph ''Γ'' without degree-one and degree-two vertices, where ''Γ'' is equipped with a volume-one metric structure, that is, assignment of positive real lengths to edges of ''Γ'' so that the sum of the lengths of all edges is equal to one. Points of ''X<sub>n</sub>'' can also be thought of as free and discrete minimal isometric actions ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on [[real tree]]s where the quotient graph has volume one.\n\nBy construction the Outer space ''X<sub>n</sub>'' is a finite-dimensional [[simplicial complex]] equipped with a natural action of [[Out(Fn)|Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)]] which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler–Vogtmann 1986 paper,<ref name=\"CV86\"/> obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space ''X<sub>n</sub>'' is contractible. Thus the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] ''X<sub>n</sub>'' /Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is \"almost\" a [[classifying space]] for [[Out(Fn)|Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)]] and it can be thought of as a classifying space over '''[[Rational number|Q]]'''. Moreover, Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is known to be [[virtually]] torsion-free, so for any torsion-free [[subgroup]] ''H'' of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) the action of ''H'' on ''X<sub>n</sub>'' is discrete and free, so that ''X<sub>n</sub>''/''H'' is a classifying space for ''H''. For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining [[homology (mathematics)|homological]] and [[cohomology|cohomological]] information about Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved<ref name=\"CV86\"/> that Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) has virtual cohomological dimension 2''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;3.\n\nIn their 1986 paper Culler and Vogtmann do not assign ''X<sub>n</sub>'' a specific name. According to Vogtmann,<ref>Karen Vogtmann, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/h764p705m4m4v512/ ''Automorphisms of free groups and Outer space''.]  [[Geometriae Dedicata]], vol. 94 (2002), pp. 1–31; Quote from p. 3: \"Peter Shalen later invented the name ''Outer space'' for ''X<sub>n</sub>''\".</ref> the term ''Outer space'' for the complex ''X<sub>n</sub>'' was later coined by [[Peter Shalen]]. In subsequent years the Outer space became a central object in the study of [[Out(Fn)|Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)]]. In particular, the Outer space has a natural compactification, similar to [[William Thurston|Thurston]]'s compactification of the [[Teichmüller space]], and studying the action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on this compactification yields interesting information about dynamical properties of [[automorphism]]s of [[free group]]s.<ref>[[Mladen Bestvina|M.

After the effective end of military rule, in 1990, the Chilean government took steps to investigate additional activities under the Pinochet regime.\n\nAccording to Chilean governmental reports, Weisfeiler was hiking near the border of the Colonia at the time of his disappearance.  Various actual or supposed eyewitnesses' conflicting reports make the details of the disappearance impossible to discern.  The Chilean government has ruled that Weisfeiler had entered the confluence of two swift-moving rivers and drowned, his body never to be recovered. Local fishermen say they camped with Boris and gave him directions northward, toward a bridge near the Colonia. Some people claim to have seen his footprints near the river and to have found his backpack and other items (the items may have been sold or destroyed by the Chilean government in the late 1990s, as evidenced by Chilean governmental documents and published news articles).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://boris.weisfeiler.com/web%20pages/LA_SEGUNDA_Court_Auction_6-15-05.htm|title=LA SEGUNDA|website=boris.weisfeiler.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}</ref>\n\nAlthough no conclusive proof connects the Weisfeiler's disappearance to any entity, some American and Chilean officials do suspect one particular group. Unknown to most of the world, [[Colonia Dignidad]] sat on a large tract of land not far from the border with [[Argentina]].

The [[BBC]] has reported and Chilean governmental documents suggest<ref>[http://boris.weisfeiler.com Official website for Boris Weisfeiler]</ref> that the Chilean ''[[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional]]'' (the secret police, which was disbanded in 1977) brought suspected anti-government prisoners there to be interrogated.\n\nAccording to [[United States Department of State]] reports, other witnesses claim they saw Boris Weisfeiler in the Colonia, several years after his disappearance. At least one claims he was alive some three years later; another claims he was assassinated as a Soviet or Jewish spy. Weisfeiler's whereabouts remain unknown, and his sister Olga, who, like her brother, emigrated to the United States, continues to petition numerous authorities to determine his fate.  Early in 2006, a bipartisan Congressional letter signed by 27 senators and representatives was delivered to Chilean President [[Michelle Bachelet]] in the hope of speeding an official Chilean investigation into his fate.\n\nOn August 21, 2012, a Chilean judge ordered the arrest of eight retired police and military officers in connection with the alleged kidnapping and disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler. According to the court filings, the suspects were to have been prosecuted for \"aggravated kidnapping\" and \"complicity\" in the disappearance of a U.S. citizen between January 3–5, 1985; the filings did not mention where Weisfeiler might have been taken after his detention or what may have happened to him afterwards.

      "text": "'''Alice Segers Whittemore''' is an American [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] and [[biostatistics|biostatistician]] who studies the effects of genetics and lifestyle on cancer, after an earlier career as a pure mathematician studying [[group theory]]. She works as a professor of health research and policy and of biomedical data science at [[Stanford University]],{{r|profile}} and has served as president of the [[International Biometric Society]].{{r|norwood}}\n\n==Education and career==\nWhittemore originally studied pure mathematics.\nHer bachelor's degree is from [[Marymount Manhattan College]],{{r|norwood}}\nand she completed a Ph.D. in 1967 from the [[City University of New York]] with a dissertation on [[Frattini subgroup]]s supervised by [[Gilbert Baumslag]].{{r|mgp}}\n\nAs a professor of mathematics at [[Hunter College]], she became interested in epidemiology and statistics, and took a fellowship to [[New York University]] to accomplish that shift of interests, under the mentorship of [[Joseph Keller]].{{r|keller}} Keller and Whittemore married and moved together to Stanford in 1978.{{r|norwood|keller}} There Whittemore became a professor in the Department of Health Research and Policy. She was chief of epidemiology there from 1997 to 2001, and later became co-chair of the department.{{r|norwood}} Keller died in 2016.{{r|keller}}\n\n==Contributions==\nOne of Whittemore's studies found a link between [[fertility drug]]s and [[ovarian cancer]], especially strong among women who were treated with the drugs but failed to conceive.{{r|ball}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1992, Whittemore was elected as a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].{{r|aaas}} She is also a [[fellow of the American Statistical Association]], and a member of the [[National Academy of Medicine]].{{r|norwood}}\n\nIn 2004, she won the Janet L. Norwood Award for outstanding achievement by a woman in the statistical sciences.{{r|norwood}} In 2010, the  Statistics in Epidemiology section of the [[American Statistical Association]] gave her their Nathan Mantel Lifetime Achievement Award.{{r|mantel}}\nShe was the recipient of the [[Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies]] \n[[Florence Nightingale David Award]] in 2005{{r|fnda}} and\n[[R. A. Fisher Lectureship]] in 2016 \"for her fundamental contributions to biostatistics and epidemiology, covering a wide range of topics from environmental risk assessment to genetic linkage analysis, genetic association studies and cancer epidemiology; for bringing her statistical and mathematical insight to bear on the collection and interpretation of scientific data; for her leadership in large consortia of cancer studies; and for being a role model for many young scientists\".{{r|fisher}}\n\n==Selected publications==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Whittemore | first1 = A.

For a general review, including an historical sketch dealing with all contributors, see the [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] entry.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHidehiko Yamabe was born on August 22, 1923 in the city of [[Ashiya, Hyōgo|Ashiya]], belonging to the [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], the sixth son of Takehiko and Rei Yamabe.<ref>The content of this section is largely based on the commemoration by {{harvtxt|Goto|1961|p=i}}.</ref> After completing the Senior High School in September 1944, he joined Tokyo University as a student of the Department of Mathematics and graduated in September 1947: his doctoral advisor was [[Shokichi Iyanaga]].<ref name=\"docadv\"/> He was then associated with the Department of Mathematics at Osaka University until June 1956, even  while employed by the Department of Mathematics at [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. Shortly before coming to the [[United States of America]], Yamabe married his wife Etsuko, and by 1956 they had two daughters. Yamabe died suddenly of a [[stroke]] in November 1960,<ref>According to {{harvtxt|Goto|1961|p=i}}, who also reports that Yamabe precisely suffered from [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].</ref> just months after accepting a full professorship at [[Northwestern University]].\n\n===Academic career===\nAfter graduating from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1947, Yamabe became an assistant at [[Osaka University]]. From 1952 until 1954 he was an assistant at [[Princeton University]], receiving his Ph.D. from Osaka University while at Princeton. He left Princeton in 1954 to become assistant professor at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Except for one year as a professor at Osaka University, he stayed in Minnesota until 1960. Yamabe died suddenly of a [[stroke]] in November 1960,<ref>According to {{harvtxt|Goto|1961|p=i}}, who also refers that he precisely suffered from [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].</ref> just months after accepting a full professorship at [[Northwestern University]].\n\n===The Yamabe Memorial Lecture and the Yamabe Symposium===\nAfter coming back to Japan, Etsuko Yamabe and her daughters lived with the benefits of Hidehiko's social security and of funds raised privately by her and her husband's friends in the United States of America.<ref name=\"sym6\">According to the [[#{{harvid|Yamabe Symposium Organizing Committee|2008}}|University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008]] p. 6).</ref> When she had achieved some financial stability, it was her wish to return the kindness shown to her in a time of great need by setting up funds for an annual lecture, to be alternatively held at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] and [[Minnesota University]]: the ''Yamabe Memorial Lecture'' was so established, and was able to attract distinguished lecturers as [[Eugenio Calabi]].<ref name=\"sym7\">According to the [[#{{harvid|Yamabe Symposium Organizing Committee|2008}}|University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008]] p. 7).</ref> Further funding permitted the expansion of the lecture to the present state bi-annual ''Yamabe Symposium''.<ref>According to the [[#{{harvid|Yamabe Symposium Organizing Committee|2008}}|University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008]] p. 7): see also the brief historical sketch \"[[#{{Harvid|University of Minnesota|2012}}|History of the Yamabe Memorial Symposium]]\" at the Symposium web page.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Research activity===\nYamabe published eighteen papers on various mathematical topics:.<ref>According to {{harvtxt|Goto|1961|p=i}}.</ref> These have been collected and published as a book, edited by [[Ralph Philip Boas, Jr.]] for [[Taylor & Francis|Gordon and Breach Science Publishers]].<ref>See {{harv|Boas|1967}}.</ref>\n\nHalf of Yamabe's papers concern  the theory of Lie groups and related topics. However, he is best known today for his remarkable posthumous paper, \"On a deformation of Riemannian structures on compact manifolds,\" Osaka Math. J. 12 (1960) 21–37. This paper claims to prove that any Riemannian metric on any compact manifold without boundary is conformal to  another metric for which the scalar curvature is constant. This assertion, which naturally generalizes the uniformization of Riemann surfaces to arbitrary dimensions,  is completely correct, as is the broad outline  of Yamabe's proof. However, Yamabe's argument contains a subtle analytic mistake arising form  the failure  of certain natural inclusions of Sobolev spaces to be compact. This mistake was only corrected in stages, on a case-by-case basis, first by Trudinger (\"Remarks Concerning the Conformal Deformation of Metrics to Constant Scalar Curvature\", Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa 22 (1968) 265–274), then by Aubin (Équations Différentielles Non Linéaires et Problème de Yamabe, J. Math. Pures Appl. 9: 55 (1976) 269–296), and finally, in full generality,  by Schoen (\"Conformal Deformation of a Riemannian Metric to Constant Scalar Curvature,\"  Journal of Differential Geometry 20 (1984) 478-495). Yamabe's visionary paper thereby became  a cornerstone of modern Riemannnian geometry, and  is thus largely responsible for his posthumous fame. For example, as of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet records 186 citations of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal, compared with only 148 citations of all of his other publications combined.\nAs of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet also lists 997 reviews containing the word \"Yamabe.\" This, of course, is notably larger than the number of papers that  explicitly cite any of Yamabe's articles. However, the vast majority of these reviews contain one of the phrases  \"scalar curvature\" or \"Yamabe equation,\" referring to Yamabe's equation  governing the behavior of the scalar curvature under conformal rescaling. In this sense, the influence of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal has become such a universal fixture of current mathematical thought that it is often implicitly referred to without an explicit citation.\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation\n  | editor-last = Boas\n  | editor-first =  R.

Hans had two brothers, Guenther and Wilfred, and sister [[Hiltgunt Zassenhaus|Hiltgunt]], who wrote an autobiography in 1974. According to her, their father lost his position as school principal due to his philosophy. She wrote:<ref name=Hiltgunt>[[Hiltgunt Zassenhaus]] (1974) ''Walls: Resisting the Third Reich'', [[Beacon Press]]</ref>{{rp|21,2}}\n:Hans, my eldest brother, studied mathematics. My brothers Guenther and Wilfred were in medical school. ... only students who participated in Nazi activities would get scholarships. That left us out. Together we made an all-out effort. ... soon our house became a beehive. Day in and day out for the next four years a small army of children of all ages would arrive to be tutored.\n\nAt the [[University of Hamburg]] Zassenhaus came under the influence of [[Emil Artin]]. As he wrote later:\n:His introductory course in analysis that I attended at the age of 17 converted me from a theoretical physicist to a mathematician.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zassenhaus | first1 = Hans | year = 1964 | title = Emil Artin, His Life and Work | journal = Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–9 | doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093957731}}</ref>\n\nWhen just 21, Zassenhaus was studying [[composition series]] in [[group theory]].  He proved his [[butterfly lemma]] that provides a refinement of two normal chains to isomorphic central chains. Inspired by Artin, Zassenhaus wrote a [[textbook]] ''Lehrbuch der Gruppentheorie'' that was later translated as ''Theory of Groups''.\nHis thesis was on [[doubly transitive permutation group]]s with [[Frobenius group]]s as [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]]s. These [[group (mathematics)|group]]s are now called [[Zassenhaus group]]s. They have had a deep impact on the [[classification of finite simple groups]].\nHe obtained his doctorate in June 1934, and took the teachers’ exam the next May. He became a scientific assistant at [[University of Rostock]]. In 1936 he became assistant to Artin back in Hamburg, but Artin departed for the USA the following year. Zassenhaus gave his [[Habilitation]] in 1938.\n\nAccording to his sister Hiltgunt, Hans was \"called up as a research scientist at a weather station\"<ref name=Hiltgunt/>{{rp|55}} for his part in the German war effort.\n\nZassenhaus married Lieselotte Lohmann in 1942. The couple raised three children: Michael (born 1943), Angela (born 1947), and Peter (born 1949). In 1943 Zassenhaus became extraordinary [[professor]]. He became Managing Director of the Hamburg Mathematical Seminar.\n\nAfter the war, and as a fellow of the [[British Council]], Zassenhaus visited [[University of Glasgow]] in 1948. There he was given an honorary Master of Arts degree. The following year he joined the faculty of [[McGill University]] where the endowments of [[Peter Redpath]] financed a professorship. He was at McGill for a decade with [[leaves of absence]] to [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (55/6) and [[California Institute of Technology]] (58/9). There he was using [[computer]]s to advance [[number theory]]. In 1959 Zassenhaus began teaching at [[University of Notre Dame]] and became director of its computing center in 1964.\n\nZassenhaus was a [[Ralph D. Mershon|Mershon visiting professor]] at [[Ohio State University]] in the fall of 1963. In 1965 he came to Ohio State permanently. The mathematics department was led by [[Arnold Ross]]; Zassenhaus found a home there until his retirement in 1982. Nonetheless, he continued to take leaves of absence for visits to Göttingen (summer 67), Heidelberg (summer 69), UCLA (fall 70), Warwick (fall 72), CIT (74/5), U Montreal (77/8), Saarbrücken (79/80).\n\nHe served as editor in chief of the [[Journal of Number Theory]] from its first issue in 1967.

Her contributions were honored with the 1990 [[Noether Lecture]].  She served as President of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] from 1981 to 1983.  She earned her Ph.D. in physics in 1959 with her dissertation ''Problems on Modular Representations of Finite Groups'' under [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J. A. Green]] at the [[University of Manchester]].  She currently is a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].  She has had five doctoral students.  She has co-authored a number of papers with Paul Fong in [[modular representation theory]] and [[Deligne–Lusztig theory]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2019}}\nSrinivasan was born in Madras,India. She attended the [[University of Madras]], where she earned her bachelor of arts degree in 1954 and her master of science degree in 1955. She traveled to England for her doctoral study. She remained in England to commence her professional academic career as a lecturer in mathematics at the [[University of Keele]] from 1960 through 1964. She then pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[University of British Columbia]] through the National research Council of Canada from 1965 through 1966.She returned home to India to teach at the Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics of her Alma mater, the [[University of Madras]], from 1966 though 1970.\n\n==Career==\nSrinivasan then immigrated to the United States, where she taught for the next decade at [[Clark University]] in Worcester, Massachusetts, as an associate professor. In 1977, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. That year, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. In 1980, she commenced her longstanding tenure at the [[University of Illinois]] as a professor of mathematics at the Chicago Circle campus.\n\nSrinivasan has distinguished herself in her field throughout her career. In January, 1979, she delivered the Invited Address to the American Mathematical Society(AMS)<ref>url=http://www.ams.org/home/page</ref> at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in Biloxi, Mississippi. She has also been invited to fill visiting professorships internationally at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, the [[University of Essen]] in Germany, [[Sydney University]],and the [[Science University of Tokyo]] in Japan. She has served as an editor for several journals in her field: ''Proceedings of the AMS'' (from 1983 through 1987); ''Communications in Algebra'' (from 1978 through 1984); ''Mathematical Surveys and Monographs'' (from 1991 through 1993). From 1991 through 1994, she served on the Editorial Boards Committee of the AMS.\n\nSrinivasan collaborated with Paul Fong on finite groups of the Lie type, and this work has been linked to Lusztig's research on quantum groups, thus crossing over between mathematics and physics. Although Srinivasan generally advocates pure mathematical research, resisting the temptation to find a practical application for all mathematics, she nevertheless got excited by the application of her research to physics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth H.|title=International encyclopedia of women scientists|date=2002|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=0816043817}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 2012 she became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-26.</ref> In 2017, she was selected as a fellow of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] in the inaugural class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Launch of the AWM Fellows Program|url=https://awm-math.org/awards/awm-fellows/|website=awm-math.org/|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics|accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n* {{Citation | last1=Srinivasan | first1=Bhama | author1-link=Bhama Srinivasan | title=The characters of the finite symplectic group Sp(4,q) | doi=10.2307/1994960 | mr=0220845 | year=1968 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=131 | pages=488–525}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Srinivasan | first1=Bhama | author1-link=Bhama Srinivasan | title=Representations of finite Chevalley groups.

It is located to the south of the crater [[Barnard (lunar crater)|Barnard]], at the northwest edge of the [[Mare Australe]].\n\nThe rim of Abel is heavily eroded and distorted in shape, forming a somewhat [[polygon]]al figure. It is incised and overlaid by past impacts. The satellite crater Abel A overlies the southern rim, while Abel M and Abel L intrude into the western wall.\n\nThe eastern floor of Abel has been resurfaced by past [[lava]] flows, leaving a relatively smooth, flat surface with a low [[albedo]]. The remains of a small crater rim protrude near the northeast wall.

      "text": "{{for|summation transformation|summation by parts}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Abel transform''',<ref>N. H. Abel, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 1, pp. 153-157 (1826)</ref> named for [[Niels Henrik Abel]], is an [[integral transform]] often used in the analysis of spherically symmetric or axially symmetric functions. The Abel transform of a function ''f''(''r'') is given by:\n\n:<math>F(y)=2\\int_y^\\infty \\frac{f(r)r}{\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}dr.</math>\n\nAssuming ''f''(''r'') drops to zero more quickly than 1/''r'', the inverse Abel transform is given by\n\n:<math>\nf(r)=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_r^\\infty\\frac{d F}{dy}\\,\\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{y^2-r^2}}.\n</math>\n\nIn [[image analysis]], the forward Abel transform is used to project an optically thin, axially symmetric emission function onto a plane, and the reverse Abel transform is used to calculate the emission function given a projection (i.e. a scan or a photograph) of that emission function.\n\nIn [[absorption spectroscopy]] of cylindrical flames or plumes, the forward Abel transform is the integrated [[absorbance]] along a ray with closest distance y from the center of the flame, while the inverse Abel transform gives the local [[absorption coefficient]] at a distance r from the center. Abel transform is limited to applications with axially symmetric geometries. For more general asymmetrical cases, more general-oriented reconstruction algorithms such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique ([[Algebraic Reconstruction Technique|ART]]), Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization ([[MLEM]]), Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithms should be employed.\n\nIn recent years, the inverse Abel transformation (and its variants) has become the cornerstone of data analysis in [[photofragment-ion imaging]] and [[photofragment-ion imaging#Electron Imaging|photoelectron imaging]]. Among recent most notable extensions of inverse Abel transformation are the [[Onion Peeling]] and [[Basis Set Expansion (BASEX)]] methods of photoelectron and photoion image analysis.\n\n== Geometrical interpretation ==\n\n[[File:AbelTransform.png|thumb|right|256px|A geometrical interpretation of the Abel transform in two dimensions. An observer (I) looks along a line parallel to the ''x''-axis a distance ''y'' above the origin. What the observer sees is the projection (i.e. the integral) of the circularly symmetric function ''f''(''r'') along the line of sight. The function ''f''(''r'') is represented in gray in this figure. The observer is assumed to be located infinitely far from the origin so that the limits of integration are ±∞]]\n\nIn two dimensions, the Abel transform ''F''(''y'') can be interpreted as the projection of a circularly symmetric function ''f''(''r'') along a set of parallel lines of sight which are a distance ''y'' from the origin. Referring to the figure on the right, the observer (I) will see\n\n:<math>F(y)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f\\!\\left(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\right)\\,dx</math>\n\nwhere ''f''(''r'') is the circularly symmetric function represented by the gray color in the figure. It is assumed that the observer is actually at ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;∞ so that the limits of integration are ±∞ and all lines of sight are parallel to the ''x''-axis.\nRealizing that the [[radius]] ''r'' is related to ''x'' and ''y'' via ''r''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>, it follows that\n\n:<math>dx=\\frac{r\\,dr}{\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}.</math>\n\nfor ''x>0''. Since ''f''(''r'') is an [[even function]] in ''x'', we may write:\n\n:<math>F(y) = 2\\int_{0}^\\infty f\\left(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\right)\\,dx = 2\\int_{|y|}^\\infty f(r)\\,\\frac{r\\,dr}{\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}</math>\n\nwhich yields the Abel transform of ''f(r)''.\n\nThe Abel transform may be extended to higher dimensions. Of particular interest is the extension to three dimensions. If we have an axially symmetric function ''f''(ρ'',z'')\nwhere ρ<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup> is the cylindrical radius, then we may want to know the projection of that function onto a plane parallel to the ''z'' axis. [[Without loss of generality]], we can take that plane to be the ''yz''-plane so that\n\n:<math>F(y,z)\n\n=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(\\rho,z)\\,dx\n\n=2\\int_y^\\infty \\frac{f(\\rho,z)\\rho\\,d\\rho}{\\sqrt{\\rho^2-y^2}}\n</math>\n\nwhich is just the Abel transform of ''f''(ρ'',z'') in ρ and ''y''.\n\nA particular type of axial symmetry is spherical symmetry. In this case,\nwe have a function ''f''(''r'') where ''r''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>2</sup>.\nThe projection onto, say, the ''yz''-plane will then be circularly symmetric and\nexpressible as ''F''(''s'') where ''s''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>2</sup>. Carrying out the integration, we have:\n\n:<math>F(s)\n\n=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(r)\\,dx\n\n=2\\int_s^\\infty \\frac{f(r)r\\,dr}{\\sqrt{r^2-s^2}}</math>\n\nwhich is again, the Abel transform of ''f''(''r'') in ''r'' and ''s''.\n\n== Verification of the inverse Abel transform ==\nAssuming <math>f</math> is continuously differentiable and <math>f</math>, <math>f'</math> drop to zero faster than <math>1/r</math>, we can set <math>u=f(r)</math> and <math> v=\\sqrt{r^2-y^2} </math>. Integration by parts then yields\n\n:<math>F(y) = -2 \\int_y^\\infty f'(r) \\sqrt{r^2-y^2} \\, dr.</math>\n\nDifferentiating [[Differentiation under the integral sign|formally]],\n\n:<math>F'(y) = 2 y \\int_y^\\infty \\frac{f'(r)}{\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}} \\, dr.</math>\n\nNow substitute this into the inverse Abel transform formula:\n\n:<math>-\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_r^\\infty \\frac{F'(y)}{\\sqrt{y^2-r^2}} \\, dy = \\int_r^\\infty \\int_y^\\infty \\frac{-2 y}{\\pi \\sqrt{(y^2-r^2) (s^2-y^2)}} f'(s) \\, ds dy.</math>\n\nBy [[Fubini's theorem]], the last integral equals\n\n:<math>\\int_r^\\infty \\int_r^s \\frac{-2 y}{\\pi \\sqrt{(y^2-r^2) (s^2-y^2)}} \\, dy f'(s) \\,ds = \\int_r^\\infty (-1) f'(s) \\, ds = f(r).</math>\n\n== Generalization of the Abel transform to discontinuous ''F''(''y'') ==\n\nConsider the case where <math>F(y)</math> is discontinuous at <math>y=y_\\Delta</math>, where it abruptly changes its value by a finite amount <math>\\Delta F</math>. That is, <math>y_\\Delta</math> and <math>\\Delta F</math> are defined by <math>\\Delta F \\equiv \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} [ F(y_\\Delta-\\epsilon) - F(y_\\Delta+\\epsilon) ]</math>. Such a situation is encountered in tethered polymers ([[Polymer brush]]) exhibiting a vertical phase separation, where <math>F(y)</math> stands for the polymer density profile and <math>f(r)</math> is related to the spatial distribution of terminal, non-tethered monomers of the polymers.\n\nThe Abel transform of a function ''f''(''r'') is under these circumstances again given by:\n\n:<math>F(y)=2\\int_y^\\infty \\frac{f(r)r\\,dr}{\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}.</math>\n\nAssuming ''f''(''r'') drops to zero more quickly than 1/''r'', the inverse Abel transform is however given by\n\n:<math>\nf(r)=\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\delta(r-y_\\Delta)\\sqrt{1-(y_\\Delta/r)^2} - \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{H(y_\\Delta-r)}{\\sqrt{y_\\Delta^2-r^2}} \\right] \\Delta F-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_r^\\infty\\frac{d F}{dy}\\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{y^2-r^2}}.\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Dirac delta function]] and <math>H(x)</math> the [[Heaviside step function]]. The extended version of the Abel transform for discontinuous F is proven upon applying the Abel transform to shifted, continuous <math>F(y)</math>, and it reduces to the classical Abel transform when <math>\\Delta F=0</math>. If <math>F(y)</math> has more than a single discontinuity, one has to introduce shifts for any of them to come up with a generalized version of the inverse Abel transform which contains ''n'' additional terms, each of them corresponding to one of the ''n'' discontinuities.\n\n== Relationship to other integral transforms ==\n\n=== Relationship to the Fourier and Hankel transforms ===\nThe Abel transform is one member of the [[Projection-slice theorem|FHA cycle]] of integral operators. For example, in two dimensions, if we define ''A'' as the Abel transform operator, ''F'' as the [[Fourier transform]] operator and ''H'' as the zeroth-order [[Hankel transform]] operator, then the special case of the [[Projection-slice theorem]] for circularly symmetric functions states that:\n\n:<math>FA=H.\\,</math>\n\nIn other words, applying the Abel transform to a 1-dimensional function and\nthen applying the Fourier transform to that result is the same as applying\nthe Hankel transform to that function. This concept can be extended to higher\ndimensions.\n\n=== Relationship to the Radon transform ===\n\nAbel transform can be viewed as the Radon transform of an isotropic 2D function ''f(r)''. As ''f(r)'' is isotropic, its Radon transform is the same at different angles of the viewing axis. Thus, the Abel transform is a function of the distance along the viewing axis only.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[GPS radio occultation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | author=Bracewell, R. | title=The Fourier Transform and its Applications | publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York | year=1965 | isbn=0-07-007016-4}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n[[Category:Integral transforms]]\n[[Category:Image processing]]\n[[Category:Niels Henrik Abel]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Abel–Jacobi map''' is a construction of [[algebraic geometry]] which relates an [[algebraic curve]] to its [[Jacobian variety]]. In [[Riemannian geometry]], it is a more general construction mapping a [[manifold]] to its Jacobi torus.\nThe name derives from the [[#Abel–Jacobi theorem|theorem]] of [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]] that two [[effective divisor]]s are [[linearly equivalent]] if and only if they are indistinguishable under the Abel–Jacobi map.\n\n==Construction of the map==\n\nIn [[complex algebraic geometry]], the Jacobian of a curve ''C'' is constructed using path integration. Namely, suppose ''C'' has [[genus of a curve|genus]] ''g'', which means topologically that\n\n: <math>H_1(C, \\Z) \\cong \\Z^{2g}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, this homology group consists of (homology classes of) ''cycles'' in ''C'', or in other words, closed loops. Therefore, we can choose 2''g'' loops <math>\\gamma_1, \\ldots, \\gamma_{2g}</math> generating it. On the other hand, another more algebro-geometric way of saying that the genus of ''C'' is ''g'' is that\n\n: <math>H^0(C, K) \\cong \\Complex^g,</math> \n\nwhere ''K'' is the [[canonical bundle]] on ''C''.\n\nBy definition, this is the space of globally defined holomorphic [[differential form]]s on ''C'', so we can choose ''g'' linearly independent forms <math>\\omega_1, \\ldots, \\omega_g</math>. Given forms and closed loops we can integrate, and we define 2''g'' vectors\n\n: <math>\\Omega_j = \\left(\\int_{\\gamma_j} \\omega_1, \\ldots, \\int_{\\gamma_j} \\omega_g\\right) \\in \\Complex^g.</math>\n\nIt follows from the [[Riemann bilinear relations]] that the <math>\\Omega_j</math> generate a nondegenerate [[lattice (group)|lattice]] <math>\\Lambda</math> (that is, they are a real basis for <math>\\Complex^g \\cong \\R^{2g}</math>), and the Jacobian is defined by\n\n:<math>J(C) = \\Complex^g/\\Lambda.</math>\n\nThe '''Abel–Jacobi map''' is then defined as follows. We pick some base point <math>p_0 \\in C</math> and, nearly mimicking the definition of <math>\\Lambda,</math> define the map\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} u : C \\to J(C) \\\\ u(p) = \\left( \\int_{p_0}^p \\omega_1, \\dots, \\int_{p_0}^p \\omega_g\\right) \\bmod \\Lambda \\end{cases}</math>\n\nAlthough this is seemingly dependent on a path from <math>p_0</math> to <math>p,</math> any two such paths define a closed loop in <math>C</math> and, therefore, an element of <math>H_1(C, \\Z),</math> so integration over it gives an element of <math>\\Lambda.</math> Thus the difference is erased in the passage to the quotient by <math>\\Lambda</math>. Changing base-point <math>p_0</math> does change the map, but only by a translation of the torus.\n\n==The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold==\n\nLet <math>M</math> be a smooth compact [[manifold]]. Let <math>\\pi = \\pi_1(M)</math> be its fundamental group. Let <math>f: \\pi \\to \\pi^{ab}</math> be its [[abelianisation]] map. Let <math>\\operatorname{tor}= \\operatorname{tor}(\\pi^{ab})</math> be the torsion subgroup of <math>\\pi^{ab}</math>. Let <math>g: \\pi^{ab} \\to \\pi^{ab}/\\operatorname{tor}</math> be the quotient by torsion. If <math>M</math> is a surface, <math>\\pi^{ab}/\\operatorname{tor}</math> is non-canonically isomorphic to <math>\\Z^{2g}</math>, where <math>g</math> is the genus; more generally, <math>\\pi^{ab}/\\operatorname{tor}</math> is non-canonically isomorphic to <math>\\Z^b </math>, where <math>b</math> is the first Betti number. Let <math>\\varphi=g \\circ f : \\pi \\to \\Z^b </math> be the composite homomorphism.\n\nDefinition. The cover <math>\\bar M</math> of the manifold <math>M</math> corresponding to the subgroup <math>\\ker(\\varphi) \\subset \\pi</math> is called the universal (or maximal) free abelian cover.\n\nNow assume ''M'' has a [[Riemannian metric]]. Let <math>E</math> be the space of harmonic 1-forms on <math>M</math>, with dual <math>E^*</math> canonically identified with <math>H_1(M,\\R)</math>. By integrating an integral harmonic 1-form along paths from a basepoint <math>x_0\\in M</math>, we obtain a map to the circle <math>\\R/\\Z=S^1</math>.\n\nSimilarly, in order to define a map <math>M\\to H_1(M,\\R) / H_1(M,\\Z)_{\\R}</math> without choosing a basis for cohomology, we argue as follows. Let <math>x</math> be a point in the [[universal cover]] <math>\\tilde{M}</math> of <math>M</math>. Thus <math>x</math> is represented by a point of <math>M</math> together with a path <math>c</math> from <math>x_0</math> to it. By integrating along the path <math>c</math>, we obtain a linear form on <math>E</math>: \n\n:<math>h\\to \\int_c h.</math>\n\nThis gives rise a map \n\n:<math>\\tilde{M}\\to E^* = H_1(M,\\R),</math> \n\nwhich, furthermore, descends to a map\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} \\overline{A}_M: \\overline{M}\\to E^* \\\\ c\\mapsto \\left( h\\mapsto \\int_c h \\right) \\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline{M}</math> is the universal free abelian cover.\n\nDefinition. The Jacobi variety (Jacobi torus) of <math>M</math> is the torus\n\n:<math>J_1(M)=H_1(M,\\R)/H_1(M,\\Z)_{\\R}.</math>\n\nDefinition. The ''Abel–Jacobi map''\n\n:<math>A_M: M \\to J_1(M),</math>\n\nis obtained from the map above by passing to quotients.\n\nThe Abel–Jacobi map is unique up to translations of the Jacobi torus. The map has applications in [[Systolic geometry]]. The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold shows up in the large time asymptotics of the heat kernel on a periodic manifold ({{harvtxt|Kotani|Sunada|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Sunada|2012}}).\n\nIn much the same way, one can define a graph-theoretic analogue of Abel–Jacobi map as a piecewise-linear map from a finite graph into a flat torus (or a Cayley graph associated with a finite abelian group), which is closely related to asymptotic behaviors of random walks on crystal lattices, and can be used for design of crystal structures.\n\n==Abel–Jacobi theorem==\n\nThe following theorem was proved by Abel: Suppose that\n\n:<math>D = \\sum\\nolimits_i n_i p_i</math>\n\nis a divisor (meaning a formal integer-linear combination of points of ''C''). We can define\n\n:<math>u(D) = \\sum\\nolimits_i n_i u(p_i)</math>\n\nand therefore speak of the value of the Abel–Jacobi map on divisors. The theorem is then that if ''D'' and ''E'' are two ''effective'' divisors, meaning that the <math>n_i</math> are all positive integers, then\n\n:<math>u(D) = u(E)</math> if and only if <math>D</math> is [[linearly equivalent]] to <math>E.</math> This implies that the Abel-Jacobi map induces an injective map (of abelian groups) from the space of divisor classes of degree zero to the Jacobian.\nJacobi proved that this map is also surjective, so the two groups are naturally isomorphic.\n\nThe Abel–Jacobi theorem implies that the [[Albanese variety]] of a compact complex curve (dual of holomorphic 1-forms modulo periods) is isomorphic to its [[Jacobian variety]] (divisors of degree 0 modulo equivalence). For higher-dimensional compact projective varieties the Albanese variety and the Picard variety are dual but need not be isomorphic.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book| author = E. Arbarello |author2=M.

In fact, the opposite is true: ''every'' non-constant polynomial equation in one unknown, with [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex numbers|complex]] coefficients, has at least one complex number as a solution (and thus, by [[polynomial division]], as many complex roots as its degree, counting repeated roots); this is the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. These solutions can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy using numerical methods such as the [[Newton's method|Newton&ndash;Raphson method]] or the [[Laguerre's method|Laguerre method]], and in this way they are no different from solutions to polynomial equations of the second, third, or fourth degrees. It also does ''not'' assert that ''no'' higher-degree polynomial equations can be solved in radicals: the equation <math>x^{n}-1=0</math> can be solved in radicals for every positive integer <math>n</math>, for example.  The theorem only shows that there is no ''general solution in radicals'' that applies to ''all'' equations of a given degree greater than 4.\n\nThe solution of any second-degree polynomial equation can be expressed in terms of its coefficients, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and [[square root]]s, in the familiar [[quadratic formula]]:  the roots of the equation <math>ax^{2}+bx+c</math> (with <math>a \\neq 0</math>) are\n\n:<math>\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</math>.\n\nAnalogous formulas for [[cubic equation|third-degree equations]] and [[quartic equation|fourth-degree equations]] (using [[square root]]s and [[cube root]]s) have been known since the 16th century. What the Abel–Ruffini theorem says is that there is no similar formula for general equations of fifth degree or higher. In principle, it could be that the equations of the fifth degree could be split in several types and, for each one of these types, there could be some algebraic solution valid within that type.  Or, as [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] wrote, \"for all that Abel's  methods could prove, every particular quintic equation might be soluble, with a special formula for each equation.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{Citation|last = Stewart|first = Ian|author-link = Ian Stewart (mathematician)|title = Galois Theory|chapter = Historical Introduction|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|isbn = 978-1-4822-4582-0|year = 2015|edition = 4th}}</ref> However, this is not so, but this impossibility is a strictly stronger result than the Abel–Ruffini theorem and is derived with [[Galois theory]].\n\n== Proof ==\nThe following proof is based on [[Galois theory]] and it is valid for any field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]&nbsp;0.

Because the <math>y_i</math>'s are indeterminates, every permutation <math>\\sigma</math> in the symmetric group on 5 letters <math>S_5</math> induces a distinct [[automorphism]] <math>\\sigma '</math> on <math>E</math> that leaves <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> fixed and permutes the elements <math>y_i</math>. Since an arbitrary rearrangement of the roots of the product form still produces the same polynomial, for example,\n\n:<math>\\left(x-y_{3}\\right) \\left(x-y_{1}\\right) \\left(x-y_{2}\\right) \\left(x-y_{5}\\right) \\left(x-y_{4}\\right)</math>\n\nis the same polynomial as\n\n:<math>\\left(x-y_{1}\\right) \\left(x-y_{2}\\right) \\left(x-y_{3}\\right) \\left(x-y_{4}\\right) \\left(x-y_{5}\\right)</math>,\n\nthe automorphisms <math>\\sigma '</math> also leave <math>F</math> fixed, so they are elements of the Galois group <math>\\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)</math>.  Therefore, we have shown that <math>S_5 \\subseteq \\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)</math>; however there could possibly be automorphisms there that are not in <math>S_5</math>. But, since the Galois group of the splitting field of a quintic polynomial has at most <math>5!</math> elements, and since <math>E</math> is a splitting field of <math>P(x)</math>, it follows that <math>\\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)</math> is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to <math>S_5</math>.  Generalizing this argument shows that the Galois group of every general polynomial of degree <math>n</math> is isomorphic to <math>S_n</math>.\n\nThe only [[composition series]] of <math>S_5</math> is <math>S_5 \\geq A_5 \\geq \\lbrace e \\rbrace</math> (where <math>A_5</math> is the [[alternating group]] on five letters, also known as the [[icosahedral group]]). However, the [[quotient group]] <math>A_5 / \\lbrace e \\rbrace</math> (isomorphic to <math>A_5</math> itself) is not [[Abelian group|abelian]], and so <math>S_5</math> is not solvable, so it must be that the general polynomial of the fifth degree has no solution in radicals.  Since the first nontrivial [[normal subgroup]] of the symmetric group on&nbsp;<math>n</math> letters is always the alternating group on&nbsp;<math>n</math> letters, and since the alternating groups on&nbsp;<math>n</math> letters for <math>n \\geq 5</math> are always [[simple group|simple]] and non-abelian, and hence not solvable, it also says that the general polynomials of all degrees higher than the fifth also have no solution in radicals. [[Q.E.D.]]\n\nThe above construction of the Galois group for a fifth degree polynomial only applies to the ''general polynomial''; specific polynomials of the fifth degree may have different Galois groups with quite different properties, for example, <math>x^{5}-1</math> has a splitting field generated by a [[primitive root of unity|primitive 5th root of unity]], and hence its Galois group is abelian and the equation itself solvable by radicals; moreover, the argument does not provide any rational-valued quintic that has <math>S_5</math> or <math>A_5</math> as its Galois group.  However, since the result is on the general polynomial, it does say that a general “quintic formula” for the roots of a quintic using only a finite combination of the arithmetic operations and radicals in terms of the coefficients is impossible.\n\nThe proof is not valid if applied to polynomials whose degree is less than 5. Indeed:\n* the group <math>A_4</math> is ''not'' simple, because the subgroup <math>\\{e,(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\\}</math>, isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]], is a normal subgroup;\n* the groups <math>A_2</math> and <math>A_3</math> ''are'' simple, but since they are abelian too (<math>A_2</math> is the trivial group and <math>A_3</math> is the [[cyclic group]] of order 3), that is not a problem.\n\nThe proof remains valid if, instead of working with five indeterminates, one works with five concrete [[Algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] complex numbers, because, by the same argument,&nbsp;<math>\\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)=S_5</math>.\n\n== History ==\nAround 1770, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] began the groundwork that unified the many different tricks that had been used up to that point to solve equations, relating them to the theory of groups of [[permutation]]s, in the form of [[Lagrange resolvents]].<ref>{{Citation|last = Lagrange|first = Joseph-Louis|author-link = Joseph Louis Lagrange|chapter = Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations|title = Œuvres de Lagrange|editor-last = Serret|editor-first = Joseph-Alfred|editor-link = Joseph Alfred Serret|year = 1869|origyear = 1771|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|pages = 205–421|volume = III}}</ref> This innovative work by Lagrange was a precursor to Galois theory, and its failure to develop solutions for equations of fifth and higher degrees hinted that such solutions might be impossible, but it did not provide conclusive proof. The first person who conjectured that the problem of solving quintics by radicals might be impossible to solve was [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who wrote in 1798 in section&nbsp;359 of his book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (which would be published only in 1801) that “there is little doubt that this problem does not so much defy modern methods of analysis as that it proposes the impossible”. The next year, in his [[thesis]], he wrote “After the labors of many geometers left little hope of ever arriving at the resolution of the general equation algebraically, it appears more and more likely that this resolution is impossible and contradictory.” And he added “Perhaps it will not be so difficult to prove, with all rigor, the impossibility for the fifth degree. I shall set forth my investigations of this at greater length in another place.” Actually, Gauss published nothing else on this subject.<ref name=\"Ayoub\"/>\n[[File:Ruffini - Teoria generale delle equazioni, 1799 - 1366896.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Ruffini]], ''Teoria generale delle equazioni'', 1799]]\n\nThe theorem was first nearly proved by [[Paolo Ruffini]] in 1799.<ref>{{Citation|last = Ruffini|first = Paolo|author-link = Paolo Ruffini|year = 1799|title = Teoria generale delle equazioni, in cui si dimostra impossibile la soluzione algebraica delle equazioni generali di grado superiore al quarto|publisher = Stamperia di S. Tommaso d'Aquino|language = Italian}}</ref> He sent his proof to several mathematicians to get it acknowledged, amongst them Lagrange (who did not reply) and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who sent him a letter saying: “Your memoir on the general solution of equations is a work which I have always believed should be kept in mind by mathematicians and which, in my opinion, proves conclusively the algebraic unsolvability of general equations of higher than fourth degree.”<ref name=\"Kiernan\">{{Citation|last = Kiernan|first = B.

Abel wrote: “The first and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Ruffini. But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difficult to determine the validity of his argument.

Ruffini assumed that all radicals that he was dealing with could be expressed from the roots of the polynomial using field operations alone; in modern terms, he assumed that the radicals belonged to the splitting field of the polynomial. To see why this is really an extra assumption, consider, for instance, the polynomial <math>P(x)=x^{3}-15x-20</math>. According to [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's formula]], one of its roots (all of them, actually) can be expressed as the sum of a cube root of <math>10+5i</math> with a cube root of <math>10-5i</math>. On the other hand, since <math>P(-3)<0</math>, <math>P(-2)>0</math>, <math>P(-1)<0</math>, and <math>P(5)>0</math>, the roots <math>r_1</math>, <math>r_2</math>, and <math>r_3</math> of <math>P(x)</math> are all real and therefore the field <math>\\mathbf{Q}(r_1,r_2,r_3)</math> is a subfield of <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>. But then the numbers <math>10 \\pm 5i</math> cannot belong to <math>\\mathbf{Q}(r_1,r_2,r_3)</math>. While Cauchy either did not notice Ruffini's assumption or felt that it was a minor one, most historians believe that the proof was not complete until Abel proved the theorem on natural irrationalities, which asserts that the assumption holds in the case of general polynomials.<ref name=\"Tignol_Abel\"/><ref>{{Citation|last = Stewart|first = Ian|author-link = Ian Stewart (mathematician)|title = Galois Theory|chapter = The Idea Behind Galois Theory|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|isbn = 978-1-4822-4582-0|year = 2015|edition = 4th}}</ref> The Abel–Ruffini theorem is thus generally credited to Abel, who published a proof in just six pages in 1824.<ref name=\"Abel1\"/> However, this short number of pages was obtained at the cost of writing in a very terse style.

For the formula on difference operators, see [[Summation by parts]].''\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Abel's identity''' (also called as '''Abel's Formula'''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Elementary_Differential_Equations.html?id=1dIXAAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Elementary Differential Equations|last=Rainville|first=Earl David|last2=Bedient|first2=Phillip Edward|date=1969|publisher=Collier-Macmillan International Editions|language=en}}</ref> or '''Abel's differential equation identity''') is an equation that expresses the [[Wronskian]] of two solutions of a homogeneous second-order linear [[ordinary differential equation]] in terms of a coefficient of the original differential equation.\nThe relation can be generalised to ''n''th-order linear ordinary differential equations. The identity is named after the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]].\n\nSince Abel's identity relates the different [[linear independence|linearly independent]] solutions of the differential equation, it can be used to find one solution from the other. It provides useful identities relating the solutions, and is also useful as a part of other techniques such as the [[method of variation of parameters]]. It is especially useful for equations such as [[Bessel function|Bessel's equation]] where the solutions do not have a simple analytical form, because in such cases the Wronskian is difficult to compute directly.\n\nA generalisation to first-order systems of homogeneous linear differential equations is given by [[Liouville's formula]].\n\n==Statement==\nConsider a [[Homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] linear second-order ordinary differential equation\n\n: <math> y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)\\,y = 0</math>\n\non an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''I'' of the [[real line]] with [[real number|real]]- or [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[continuous functions]] ''p'' and ''q''. Abel's identity states that the Wronskian <math>W=(y_1,y_2)</math> of two real- or complex-valued solutions <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math> of this differential equation, that is the function defined by the [[determinant]]\n\n: <math>W(y_1,y_2)(x)\n=\\begin{vmatrix}y_1(x)&y_2(x)\\\\y'_1(x)&y'_2(x)\\end{vmatrix}\n=y_1(x)\\,y'_2(x) - y'_1(x)\\,y_2(x),\\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\nsatisfies the relation\n\n: <math>W(y_1,y_2)(x)=C \\exp\\biggl(-\\int_{x_0}^x p(t) \\,\\textrm{d}t\\biggr),\\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\nfor every point ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''I'', where ''C'' is an arbitrary constant.\n\n===Remarks===\n* In particular, the Wronskian <math>W(y_1,y_2)</math> is either always the zero function or always different from zero with the same sign at every point <math>x</math> in <math>I</math>. In the latter case, the two solutions <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math> are linearly independent (see that article about the Wronskian for a proof).\n* It is not necessary to assume that the second derivatives of the solutions <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math> are continuous.\n* Abel's theorem is particularly useful if <math>p(x)=0</math>, because it implies that ''W=const''.\n\n===Proof===\n[[Derivative|Differentiating]] the Wronskian using the [[product rule]] gives (writing <math>W</math> for <math>W(y_1,y_2)</math> and omitting the argument <math>x</math> for brevity)\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nW' &= y_1' y_2' + y_1 y_2'' - y_1'' y_2 - y_1' y_2' \\\\\n& = y_1 y_2'' - y_1'' y_2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSolving for <math>y''</math> in the original differential equation yields\n\n: <math> y'' = -(py'+qy). </math>\n\nSubstituting this result into the derivative of the Wronskian function to replace the second derivatives of <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math> gives\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n W'&= -y_1(py_2'+qy_2)+(py_1'+qy_1)y_2 \\\\\n&= -p(y_1y_2'-y_1'y_2)\\\\\n&= -pW.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation, and it remains to show that Abel's identity gives the unique solution, which attains the value <math>W(x_0)</math> at <math>x_0</math>. Since the function <math>p</math> is continuous on <math>I</math>, it is bounded on every closed and bounded subinterval of <math>I</math> and therefore integrable, hence\n\n:<math>V(x)=W(x) \\exp\\left(\\int_{x_0}^x p(\\xi) \\,\\textrm{d}\\xi\\right), \\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\nis a well-defined function. Differentiating both sides, using the product rule, the [[chain rule]], the derivative of the [[exponential function]] and the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], one obtains\n\n:<math>V'(x)=\\bigl(W'(x)+W(x)p(x)\\bigr)\\exp\\biggl(\\int_{x_0}^x p(\\xi) \\,\\textrm{d}\\xi\\biggr)=0,\\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\ndue to the differential equation for <math>W</math>. Therefore, <math>V</math> has to be constant on <math>I</math>, because otherwise we would obtain a contradiction to the [[mean value theorem]] (applied separately to the real and imaginary part in the complex-valued case). Since <math>V(x_0) = W(x_0)</math>, Abel's identity follows by solving the definition of <math>V</math> for <math>W(x)</math>.\n\n==Generalization==\nConsider a homogeneous linear <math>n</math>th-order (<math>n \\geq 1</math>) ordinary differential equation\n\n: <math>y^{(n)} + p_{n-1}(x)\\,y^{(n-1)} + \\cdots + p_1(x)\\,y' + p_0(x)\\,y = 0,</math>\n\non an interval <math>I</math> of the real line with a real- or complex-valued continuous function <math>p_{n-1}</math>. The generalisation of Abel's identity states that the Wronskian <math>W(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)</math> of <math>n</math> real- or complex-valued solutions <math>y_1,\\ldots,y_n</math> of this <math>n</math>th-order differential equation, that is the function defined by the determinant\n\n: <math>W(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)(x)\n=\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1(x) & y_2(x) & \\cdots & y_n(x)\\\\\ny'_1(x) & y'_2(x)& \\cdots & y'_n(x)\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\ny_1^{(n-1)}(x) & y_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix},\\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\nsatisfies the relation\n\n: <math>W(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)(x)=W(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)(x_0) \\exp\\biggl(-\\int_{x_0}^x p_{n-1}(\\xi) \\,\\textrm{d}\\xi\\biggr),\\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\nfor every point <math>x_0</math> in <math>I</math>.\n\n===Direct proof===\nFor brevity, we write <math>W</math> for <math>W(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)</math> and omit the argument <math>x</math>. It suffices to show that the Wronskian solves the first-order linear differential equation\n\n:<math>W'=-p_{n-1}\\,W,</math>\n\nbecause the remaining part of the proof then coincides with the one for the case <math>n=2</math>.\n\nIn the case <math>n=1</math> we have <math>W=y_1</math> and the differential equation for <math>W</math> coincides with the one for <math>y_1</math>. Therefore, assume <math>n \\geq 2</math> in the following.\n\nThe derivative of the Wronskian <math>W</math> is the derivative of the defining determinant. It follows from the [[Leibniz formula for determinants]] that this derivative can be calculated by differentiating every row separately, hence\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}W' & =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny'_1 & y'_2 & \\cdots & y'_n\\\\\ny'_1 & y'_2 & \\cdots & y'_n\\\\\ny''_1 & y''_2 & \\cdots & y''_n\\\\\ny'''_1 & y'''_2 & \\cdots & y'''_n\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\ny_1^{(n-1)} & y_2^{(n-1)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)}\n\\end{vmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1 & y_2 & \\cdots & y_n\\\\\ny''_1 & y''_2 & \\cdots & y''_n\\\\\ny''_1 & y''_2 & \\cdots & y''_n\\\\\ny'''_1 & y'''_2 & \\cdots & y'''_n\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\ny_1^{(n-1)} & y_2^{(n-1)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)}\n\\end{vmatrix}\\\\\n&\\qquad+\\ \\cdots\\ +\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1 & y_2 & \\cdots & y_n\\\\\ny'_1 & y'_2 & \\cdots & y'_n\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\ny_1^{(n-3)} & y_2^{(n-3)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-3)}\\\\\ny_1^{(n-2)} & y_2^{(n-2)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)}\\\\\ny_1^{(n)} & y_2^{(n)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n)}\n\\end{vmatrix}.\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHowever, note that every determinant from the expansion contains a pair of identical rows, except the last one. Since determinants with linearly dependent rows are equal to 0, one is only left with the last one:\n\n: <math>W'=\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1 & y_2 & \\cdots & y_n\\\\\ny'_1 & y'_2 & \\cdots & y'_n\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\ny_1^{(n-2)} & y_2^{(n-2)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)}\\\\\ny_1^{(n)} & y_2^{(n)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n)}\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nSince every <math>y_i</math> solves the ordinary differential equation, we have\n\n: <math>y_i^{(n)}  + p_{n-2}\\,y_i^{(n-2)} + \\cdots + p_1\\,y'_i + p_0\\,y_i = -p_{n-1}\\,y_i^{(n-1)}</math>\n\nfor every <math>i \\in \\lbrace 1,\\ldots,n \\rbrace</math>. Hence, adding to the last row of the above determinant <math>p_0</math> times its first row, <math>p_1</math> times its second row, and so on until <math>p_{n-2}</math> times its next to last row, the value of the determinant for the derivative of <math>W</math> is unchanged and we get\n\n: <math>W'=\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1 & y_2 & \\cdots & y_n \\\\\ny'_1 & y'_2 & \\cdots & y'_n \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\ny_1^{(n-2)} & y_2^{(n-2)} & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)} \\\\\n-p_{n-1}\\,y_1^{(n-1)} & -p_{n-1}\\,y_2^{(n-1)} & \\cdots & -p_{n-1}\\,y_n^{(n-1)}\n\\end{vmatrix}\n=-p_{n-1}W.\n</math>\n\n===Proof using Liouville's formula===\nThe solutions <math>y_1,\\ldots,y_n</math> form the square-matrix valued solution\n\n:<math>\\Phi(x)=\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_1(x) & y_2(x) & \\cdots & y_n(x)\\\\\ny'_1(x) & y'_2(x)& \\cdots & y'_n(x)\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\ny_1^{(n-2)}(x) & y_2^{(n-2)}(x) & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)}(x)\\\\\ny_1^{(n-1)}(x) & y_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad x\\in I,</math>\n\nof the <math>n</math>-dimensional first-order system of homogeneous linear differential equations\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}y'\\\\y''\\\\\\vdots\\\\y^{(n-1)}\\\\y^{(n)}\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\\n0&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\n0&0&0&\\cdots&1\\\\\n-p_0(x)&-p_1(x)&-p_2(x)&\\cdots&-p_{n-1}(x)\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}y\\\\y'\\\\\\vdots\\\\y^{(n-2)}\\\\y^{(n-1)}\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of this matrix is <math>-p_{n-1}(x)</math>, hence Abel's identity follows directly from [[Liouville's formula]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Abel, N.

It is named after Norwegian mathematician [[Niels Henrik Abel]].\n\n==Theorem==\n\nLet\n\n:<math>G (x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k x^k</math>\n\nbe a power series with real coefficients ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> with radius of convergence&nbsp;1.  Suppose that the series \n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k</math> \n\nconverges.  Then ''G''(''x'') is continuous from the left at <math>x=1</math>, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to 1^-} G(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k. </math>\n\nThe same theorem holds for complex power series \n\n:<math>G(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k z^k,</math> \n\nprovided that <math>z \\to 1</math> within a ''Stolz sector'', that is, a region of the open unit disk where\n\n: <math> |1-z|\\leq M(1-|z|)</math>\n\nfor some&nbsp;''M''.  Without this restriction, the limit may fail to exist: for example, the power series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n>0} \\frac{z^{3^n}-z^{2\\cdot 3^n}} n </math>\n\nconverges to 0 at ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, but is unbounded near any point of the form ''e''<sup>{{pi}}i/3<sup>''n''</sup></sup>, so the value at ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 is not the limit as ''z'' tends to 1 in the whole open disk.\n\nNote that ''G''(''z'') is continuous on the real closed interval [0,&nbsp;''t''] for ''t''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1, by virtue of the uniform convergence of the series on compact subsets of the disk of convergence.  Abel's theorem allows us to say more, namely that ''G''(''z'') is continuous on&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;1].\n\n==Remarks==\nAs an immediate consequence of this theorem, if ''z'' is any nonzero complex number for which the series \n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k z^k</math> \n\nconverges, then it follows that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{t\\to 1^{-}} G(tz) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_kz^k</math>\n\nin which the limit is taken [[one-sided limit|from below]].\n\nThe theorem can also be generalized to account for sums which diverge to infinity.{{cn|date=May 2015}} If\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k = \\infty</math>\n\nthen \n\n:<math>\\lim_{z\\to 1^{-}} G(z) \\to \\infty.</math> \n\nHowever, if the series is only known to be divergent, the theorem fails; take for example, the power series for \n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1+z}.</math>\n\nAt <math>z=1</math> the series is equal to <math>1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \\cdots, </math> but <math>\\tfrac{1}{1+1}=\\tfrac{1}{2}.</math>\n\nWe also remark the theorem holds for radii of convergence other than <math>R=1</math>: let \n\n:<math>G(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_kx^k</math> \n\nbe a power series with radius of convergence <math>R</math>, and suppose the series converges at <math>x=R</math>. Then <math>G(x)</math> is continuous from the left at <math>x=R</math>, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to R^-}G(x)=G(R)</math>\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe utility of Abel's theorem is that it allows us to find the limit of a power series as its argument (i.e. <math>z</math>) approaches 1 from below, even in cases where the [[radius of convergence]], <math>R</math>, of the power series is equal to 1 and we cannot be sure whether the limit should be finite or not. See e.g. the [[binomial series]]. Abel's theorem allows us to evaluate many series in closed form. For example, when \n\n:<math> a_k = \\frac{(-1)^k}{k+1},</math>\n\nwe obtain \n\n:<math>G_a(z) = \\frac{\\ln(1+z)}{z}, \\qquad 0 < z < 1,</math> \n\nby integrating the uniformly convergent geometric power series term by term on <math>[-z, 0]</math>; thus the series \n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}</math> \n\nconverges to <math>\\ln(2)</math> by Abel's theorem. Similarly, \n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}</math> \n\nconverges to  <math>\\arctan(1) = \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}.</math>\n\n<math>G_a(z)</math> is called the [[generating function]] of the sequence <math>a</math>. Abel's theorem is frequently useful in dealing with generating functions of real-valued and non-negative [[sequence]]s, such as [[probability-generating function]]s. In particular, it is useful in the theory of [[Galton&ndash;Watson process]]es.\n\n==Outline of proof==\n\nAfter subtracting a constant from <math>a_0 </math>, we may assume that <math>\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k=0</math>. Let <math>s_n=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\\!</math>. Then substituting <math>a_k=s_k-s_{k-1}</math> and performing a simple manipulation of the series ([[summation by parts]]) results in\n\n:<math>G_a(z) = (1-z)\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} s_k z^k.</math>\n\nGiven <math>\\varepsilon > 0,</math> pick ''n'' large enough so that <math>|s_k| < \\varepsilon</math> for all <math>k\\ge n</math> and note that\n\n:<math>\\left|(1-z)\\sum_{k=n}^\\infty s_kz^k \\right| \\le \\varepsilon |1-z|\\sum_{k=n}^\\infty |z|^k = \\varepsilon|1-z|\\frac{|z|^n}{1-|z|} < \\varepsilon M </math>\n\nwhen ''z'' lies within the given Stolz angle. Whenever ''z'' is sufficiently close to 1 we have\n\n:<math>\\left|(1-z)\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} s_kz^k \\right| < \\varepsilon, </math>\n\nso that <math>|G_a(z)| < (M+1)\\varepsilon</math> when ''z'' is both sufficiently close to 1 and within the Stolz angle.\n\n==Related concepts==\n\nConverses to a theorem like Abel's are called [[Tauberian theorem]]s: There is no exact converse, but results conditional on some hypothesis.

      "title": "Abelian category",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category",
      "text": "{{Short description|category with direct sums and certain types of kernels and cokernels}}\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''abelian category''' is a [[category (category theory)|category]] in which [[morphism]]s and objects can be added and in which [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]]s and [[cokernel]]s exist and have desirable properties. The motivating prototype example of an abelian category is the [[category of abelian groups]], '''Ab'''. The theory originated in an effort to unify several [[cohomology theory|cohomology theories]] by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and independently in the slightly earlier work of [[David Buchsbaum]]. Abelian categories are very ''stable'' categories; for example they are [[regular category|regular]] and they satisfy the [[snake lemma]]. The class of Abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of [[chain complex]]es of an Abelian category, or the category of [[functor]]s from a [[small category]] to an Abelian category are Abelian as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in [[homological algebra]] and beyond; the theory has major applications in [[algebraic geometry]], [[cohomology]] and pure [[category theory]]. Abelian categories are named after [[Niels Henrik Abel]].\n\n==Definitions==\nA category is '''abelian''' if\n*it has a [[zero object]],\n*it has all binary [[biproduct|biproducts]],\n*it has all [[kernel (category theory)|kernels]] and [[cokernel|cokernels]], and\n*all [[monomorphism|monomorphisms]] and [[epimorphism|epimorphisms]] are [[normal morphism|normal]].\n\nThis definition is equivalent<ref>Peter Freyd, [http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/tr3abs.html Abelian Categories]</ref> to the following \"piecemeal\" definition:\n* A category is ''[[preadditive category|preadditive]]'' if it is [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[monoidal category]] '''Ab''' of [[abelian group]]s. This means that all [[hom-set]]s are abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is [[bilinear operator|bilinear]]. \n* A preadditive category is ''[[additive category|additive]]'' if every [[finite set]] of objects has a [[biproduct]]. This means that we can form finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s and [[direct product]]s. In <ref>Handbook of categorical algebra, vol. 2, F. Borceux</ref> Def. 1.2.6, it is required that an additive category has a zero object (empty biproduct).\n* An additive category is ''[[preabelian category|preabelian]]'' if every morphism has both a [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and a [[cokernel]].\n* Finally, a preabelian category is '''abelian''' if every [[monomorphism]] and every [[epimorphism]] is [[normal morphism|normal]]. This means that every monomorphism is a kernel of some morphism, and every epimorphism is a cokernel of some morphism.\n\nNote that the enriched structure on [[hom-set]]s is a ''consequence'' of the first three [[axiom]]s of the first definition. This highlights the foundational relevance of the category of [[Abelian group]]s in the theory and its canonical nature.\n\nThe concept of [[exact sequence]] arises naturally in this setting, and it turns out that [[exact functor]]s, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between Abelian categories. This ''exactness'' concept has been axiomatized in the theory of [[Exact category|exact categories]], forming a very special case of [[regular category|regular categories]].\n\n==Examples==\n* As mentioned above, the category of all abelian groups is an abelian category. The category of all [[finitely generated abelian group]]s is also an abelian category, as is the category of all finite abelian groups.\n* If ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], then the category of all left (or right) [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''R'' is an abelian category. In fact, it can be shown that any small abelian category is equivalent to a [[full subcategory]] of such a category of modules (''[[Mitchell's embedding theorem]]'').\n* If ''R'' is a left-[[noetherian ring]], then the category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] left modules over ''R'' is abelian. In particular, the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian [[commutative ring]] is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in [[commutative algebra]].\n* As special cases of the two previous examples: the category of [[vector space]]s over a fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' is abelian, as is the category of finite-[[Hamel dimension|dimensional]] vector spaces over ''k''.\n* If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then the category of all (real or complex) [[vector bundles]] on ''X'' is not usually an abelian category, as there can be monomorphisms that are not kernels.\n* If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then the category of all [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups on ''X'' is an abelian category. More generally, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck site]] is an abelian category. In this way, abelian categories show up in [[algebraic topology]] and [[algebraic geometry]].\n* If '''C''' is a [[category (mathematics)#Small_and_large_categories|small category]] and '''A''' is an abelian category, then the [[functor category|category of all functors]] from '''C''' to '''A''' forms an abelian category. If '''C''' is small and [[preadditive category|preadditive]], then the category of all [[additive functor]]s from '''C''' to '''A''' also forms an abelian category. The latter is a generalization of the ''R''-module example, since a ring can be understood as a preadditive category with a single object.\n\n==Grothendieck's axioms==\nIn his [[Tōhoku article]], Grothendieck listed four additional axioms (and their duals) that an abelian category '''A''' might satisfy. These axioms are still in common use to this day. They are the following:\n* AB3) For every indexed family (A<sub>i</sub>) of objects of '''A''', the [[coproduct]] *A<sub>i</sub> exists in '''A''' (i.e. '''A''' is [[cocomplete]]).\n* AB4) '''A''' satisfies AB3), and the coproduct of a family of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.\n* AB5) '''A''' satisfies AB3), and [[filtered colimit]]s of [[exact sequence]]s are exact.\nand their duals\n* AB3*) For every indexed family (A<sub>i</sub>) of objects of '''A''', the [[Product (category theory)|product]] PA<sub>i</sub> exists in '''A''' (i.e. '''A''' is [[Complete category|complete]]).\n* AB4*) '''A''' satisfies AB3*), and the product of a family of epimorphisms is an epimorphism.\n* AB5*) '''A''' satisfies AB3*), and [[filtered limit]]s of exact sequences are exact.\n\nAxioms AB1) and AB2) were also given. They are what make an additive category abelian. Specifically:\n* AB1) Every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel.\n* AB2) For every morphism ''f'', the canonical morphism from coim ''f'' to im ''f'' is an isomorphism.\n\nGrothendieck also gave axioms AB6) and AB6*).\n\n* AB6) '''A''' satisfies AB3), and given a family of filtered categories <math>I_j, j\\in J</math> and maps <math>A_j : I_j \\to A</math>, we have <math>\\prod_{j\\in J} \\lim_{I_j} A_j = \\lim_{I_j, \\forall j\\in J} \\prod_{j\\in J} A_j</math>, where lim denotes the filtered colimit.\n* AB6*) '''A''' satisfies AB3*), and given a family of cofiltered categories <math>I_j, j\\in J</math> and maps <math>A_j : I_j \\to A</math>, we have <math>\\sum_{j\\in J} \\lim_{I_j} A_j = \\lim_{I_j, \\forall j\\in J} \\sum_{j\\in J} A_j</math>, where lim denotes the cofiltered limit.\n\n==Elementary properties==\nGiven any pair ''A'', ''B'' of objects in an abelian category, there is a special [[zero morphism]] from ''A'' to ''B''. This can be defined as the [[0 (number)|zero]] element of the [[hom-set]] Hom(''A'',''B''), since this is an abelian group.\nAlternatively, it can be defined as the unique composition ''A'' → 0 → ''B'', where 0 is the [[zero object]] of the abelian category.\n\nIn an abelian category, every morphism ''f'' can be written as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism.\nThis epimorphism is called the ''[[coimage]]'' of ''f'', while the monomorphism is called the ''[[image (category theory)|image]]'' of ''f''.\n\n[[Subobject]]s and [[quotient object]]s are [[well-behaved]] in abelian categories.\nFor example, the [[poset]] of subobjects of any given object ''A'' is a [[bounded lattice]].\n\nEvery abelian category '''A''' is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the monoidal category of finitely generated abelian groups; that is, we can form a [[tensor product]] of a finitely generated abelian group ''G'' and any object ''A'' of '''A'''.\nThe abelian category is also a [[comodule]]; Hom(''G'',''A'') can be interpreted as an object of '''A'''.\nIf '''A''' is [[complete category|complete]], then we can remove the requirement that ''G'' be finitely generated; most generally, we can form [[finitary]] [[enriched limit]]s in '''A'''.\n\n==Related concepts==\nAbelian categories are the most general setting for [[homological algebra]].\nAll of the constructions used in that field are relevant, such as exact sequences, and especially [[short exact sequence]]s, and [[derived functor]]s.\nImportant theorems that apply in all abelian categories include the [[five lemma]] (and the [[short five lemma]] as a special case), as well as the [[snake lemma]] (and the [[nine lemma]] as a special case).\n\n==Subcategories of abelian categories==\nThere are numerous types of (full, additive) subcategories of abelian categories that occur in nature, as well as some conflicting terminology.\n\nLet '''A''' be an abelian category, '''C''' a full, additive subcategory, and ''I'' the inclusion functor.\n* '''C''' is an exact subcategory if it is itself an [[exact category]] and the inclusion ''I'' is an [[exact functor]]. This occurs if and only if '''C''' is closed under pull-backs of epimorphisms and push-outs of monomorphisms. The exact sequences in '''C''' are thus the exact sequences in '''A''' for which all objects lie in '''C'''.\n* '''C''' is an abelian subcategory if it is itself an abelian category and the inclusion ''I'' is an [[exact functor]]. This occurs if and only if '''C''' is closed under taking kernels and cokernels. Note that there are examples of full subcategories of an abelian category which are themselves abelian but where the inclusion functor is not exact, so they are not abelian subcategories (see below).\n* '''C''' is a thick subcategory if it is closed under taking direct summands and satisfies the 2-out-of-3 property on short exact sequences; that is, if <math>0 \\to M' \\to M \\to M'' \\to 0 </math> is a short exact sequence in '''A''' such that two of <math>M',M,M''</math> lie in '''C''', then so does the third. In other words, '''C''' is closed under kernels of epimorphisms, cokernels of monomorphisms, and extensions. Note that P. Gabriel used the term ''thick subcategory'' to describe what we here call a ''Serre subcategory''.\n* '''C''' is a topologizing subcategory if it is closed under [[subquotient]]s.\n* '''C''' is a [[localizing subcategory|Serre subcategory]] if, for all short exact sequences <math>0 \\to M' \\to M \\to M'' \\to 0 </math> in '''A''' we have ''M'' in '''C''' if and only if both <math>M',M''</math> are in '''C'''. In other words, '''C''' is closed under extensions and [[subquotient]]s. These subcategories are precisely the kernels of exact functors from '''A''' to another abelian category.\n* '''C''' is a [[localizing subcategory]] if it is a Serre subcategory such that the quotient functor <math>Q\\colon\\mathbf A\\to\\mathbf A/\\mathbf C</math> admits a [[Adjoint functors|right adjoint]].\n* There are two competing notions of a wide subcategory. One version is that '''C''' contains every object of '''A''' (up to isomorphism); for a full subcategory this is obviously not interesting. (This is also called a [[subcategory#Types of subcategories|lluf]] subcategory.) The other version is that '''C''' is closed under extensions.\n\nHere is an explicit example of a full, additive subcategory of an abelian category which is itself abelian but the inclusion functor is not exact. Let ''k'' be a field, <math>T_n</math> the algebra of upper-triangular <math>n\\times n</math> matrices over ''k'', and <math>\\mathbf A_n</math> the category of finite-dimensional <math>T_n</math>-modules. Then each <math>\\mathbf A_n</math> is an abelian category and we have an inclusion functor <math>I\\colon\\mathbf A_2\\to\\mathbf A_3</math> identifying the simple projective, simple injective and indecomposable projective-injective modules. The essential image of ''I'' is a full, additive subcategory, but ''I'' is not exact.\n\n== History ==\nAbelian categories were introduced by {{harvtxt|Buchsbaum|1955}} (under the name of \"exact category\")  and {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1957}} in order to unify various cohomology theories. At the time, there was a cohomology theory for [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]], and a cohomology theory for [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. The two were defined differently, but they had similar properties. In fact, much of [[category theory]] was developed as a language to study these similarities. Grothendieck unified the two theories: they both arise as [[derived functor]]s on abelian categories; the abelian category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and the abelian category of [[G-module|''G''-modules]] for a given group ''G''.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Category theory}}\n<references />\n*{{Citation | last1=Buchsbaum | first1=David A. | authorlink=David Buchsbaum| title=Exact categories and duality | jstor=1993003 | mr=0074407 | year=1955 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=80 | issue=1 | pages=1–34 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1955-0074407-6}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Freyd | first1=Peter | author1-link=Peter Freyd | title=Abelian Categories | url=http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/tr3abs.html | publisher=Harper and Row | location=New York | year=1964}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Grothendieck | first1=Alexander | author1-link=Alexander Grothendieck | title=Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique | mr=0102537 | year=1957 | journal=[[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]] |series= Second Series | issn=0040-8735 | volume=9 | pages=119–221|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.tmj/1178244839 | doi=10.2748/tmj/1178244839}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Mitchell | first1=Barry | title=Theory of Categories | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | year=1965}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Popescu | first1=Nicolae | author-link=Nicolae Popescu| title=Abelian categories with applications to rings and modules | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | year=1973}}\n\n<!--\n----\n==To do==\n''There are still several facts listed in [[Preadditive category]], [[Additive category]], and [[Preabelian category]] that should be repeated here when this is the most common context in which they're used.''\n\n-->\n\n[[Category:Additive categories]]\n[[Category:Homological algebra]]\n[[Category:Niels Henrik Abel]]"

The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being [[near-ring]]s and [[partially ordered group]]s, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.\n\n=== Multiplication table ===\nTo verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) – known as a [[Cayley table]] – can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is {{nowrap|1=''G'' = {''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''e'', ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>}<nowiki/>}} under the operation ⋅, the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')th}} entry of this table contains the product {{nowrap|''g''<sub>''i''</sub> ⋅ ''g''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\nThis is true since if the group is abelian, then {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>''i''</sub> ⋅ ''g''<sub>''j''</sub> = ''g''<sub>''j''</sub> ⋅ ''g''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. This implies that the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')th}} entry of the table equals the {{nowrap|(''j'', ''i'')th}} entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\n== Examples ==\n* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] \"+\", denoted {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}, the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer ''n'' has an [[additive inverse]], −''n'', and the addition operation is commutative since {{nowrap|1=''m'' + ''n'' = ''n'' + ''m''}} for any two integers ''m'' and ''n''.\n* Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''a''<sup>''m''</sup>''a''<sup>''n''</sup>}} {{nowrap|1== ''a''<sup>''m'' + ''n''</sup>}} {{nowrap|1== ''a''<sup>''n'' + ''m''</sup>}} {{nowrap|1== ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>''a''<sup>''m''</sup> = ''yx''}}. Thus the [[integer]]s, '''Z''', form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.\n* Every [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.\n* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian. The finite [[simple group|simple]] abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order.<ref>Rose 2012, p. 32</ref>\n* The concepts of abelian group and '''Z'''-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] agree.  More specifically, every ''Z''-module is an abelian group with its operation of addition, and every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers '''Z''' in a unique way.\n\nIn general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication – one example is the group of 2×2 [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].\n\n== Historical remarks ==\n<!-- This particular statement seems to be suspect, but the direction is right. Note: updated and corrected on Sept. 2, 2012 -->\n[[Camille Jordan]] named abelian groups after [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]], because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a [[polynomial]] implies that the roots of the polynomial can be [[solvability by radicals|calculated by using radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.\n\n== Properties ==\nIf ''n'' is a [[natural number]] and ''x'' is an element of an abelian group ''G'' written additively, then ''nx'' can be defined as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x''}} (''n'' summands) and {{nowrap|1=(−''n'')''x'' = −(''nx'')}}. In this way, ''G'' becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z''' of integers. In fact, the modules over '''Z''' can be identified with the abelian groups.\n\nTheorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] '''Z''') can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form '''Z'''/''p''<sup>k</sup>'''Z''' for ''p'' prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of '''Z'''.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'', ''g'' : ''G'' → ''H''}} are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum {{nowrap|''f'' + ''g''}}, defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f'' + ''g'') (''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')}}, is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if ''H'' is a non-abelian group.) The set {{nowrap|Hom(''G'', ''H'')}} of all group homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''H'' thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.\n\nSomewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the maximal [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of a set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.\n\nThe [[center (group theory)|center]] ''Z''(''G'') of a group ''G'' is the set of elements that commute with every element of ''G''. A group ''G'' is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center ''Z''(''G''). The center of a group ''G'' is always a [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] abelian subgroup of ''G''. If the quotient group ''G''/''Z''(''G'') of a group by its center is cyclic then ''G'' is abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, p. 48</ref>\n\n== Finite abelian groups ==\nCyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].\n\nAny group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, p. 79</ref> In fact, for every prime number ''p'' there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order ''p''<sup>2</sup>, namely '''Z'''<sub>''p''<sup>2</sup></sub> and '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>×'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>.\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group ''G'' can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order; it is also known as the '''basis theorem for finite abelian groups'''.<ref>[[:de:Hans Kurzweil|Kurzweil, H.]], & [[:de:Bernd Stellmacher|Stellmacher, B.]], ''The Theory of Finite Groups: An Introduction'' (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iebSBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PR1&pg=PA43 pp. 43–54].</ref> This is generalized by the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]], with finite groups being the special case when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.\n\nThe classification was proven by [[Leopold Kronecker]] in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by Gauss in 1801; see [[Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups#History|history]] for details.\n\nThe cyclic group '''Z'''<sub>''mn''</sub> of order ''mn'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of '''Z'''<sub>''m''</sub> and '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> if and only if ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group ''G'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{u}\\ \\mathbf{Z}_{k_i}</math>\n\nin either of the following canonical ways:\n* the numbers ''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''u''</sub> are powers of (not necessarily distinct) primes,\n* or ''k''<sub>1</sub> [[divisor|divides]] ''k''<sub>2</sub>, which divides ''k''<sub>3</sub>, and so on up to ''k''<sub>''u''</sub>.\n\nFor example, '''Z'''<sub>15</sub> can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>15</sub> ≅ {0, 5, 10} ⊕ {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}.}} The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].\n\nFor another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either '''Z'''<sub>8</sub> (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>4</sub> ⊕ '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub> ⊕ '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> ⊕ '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nSee also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.\n\n=== Automorphisms ===\nOne can apply the [[#Classification|fundamental theorem]] to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group ''G''. To do this, one uses the fact that if ''G'' splits as a direct sum {{nowrap|''H'' ⊕ ''K''}} of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then {{nowrap|Aut(''H'' ⊕ ''K'') ≅ Aut(''H'') ⊕ Aut(''K'')}}.\n\nGiven this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of ''G'' it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] ''p''-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of ''p''). Fix a prime ''p'' and suppose the exponents ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of the cyclic factors of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:\n\n:<math>e_1\\leq e_2 \\leq\\cdots\\leq e_n</math>\n\nfor some {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}}. One needs to find the automorphisms of\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.</math>\n\nOne special case is when ''n'' = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P''. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when ''n'' is arbitrary but {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1 for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}. Here, one is considering ''P'' to be of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_p \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_p,</math>\n\nso elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension ''n'' over the finite field of ''p'' elements '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\cong\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbf{F}_p),</math>\n\nwhere GL is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order\n\n:<math> \\left|\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\right|=(p^n-1)\\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).</math>\n\nIn the most general case, where the ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''n'' are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines\n\n:<math>d_k=\\max\\{r\\mid e_r = e_k^{\\,}\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>c_k=\\min\\{r\\mid e_r=e_k\\}</math>\n\nthen one has in particular {{nowrap|''d''<sub>''k''</sub> ≥ ''k''}}, {{nowrap|''c''<sub>''k''</sub> ≤ ''k''}}, and\n\n:<math> \\left|\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\right| = \\prod_{k=1}^n (p^{d_k}-p^{k-1}) \\prod_{j=1}^n (p^{e_j})^{n-d_j} \\prod_{i=1}^n (p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}. </math>\n\nOne can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., & Rhea, D.).\n\n==Finitely generated abelian groups==\n{{main|Finitely generated abelian group}}\nAn abelian group {{mvar|A}} is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called ''generators'') <math>G=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}</math> such that every element of the group is a [[linear combination]] with integer coefficients of elements of {{mvar|G}}. \n\nLet {{mvar|L}} be a [[free abelian group]] with basis <math>B=\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}.</math> \nThere is a unique [[group homomorphism]]\n<math>p\\colon L \\to A,</math> such that \n:<math>p(b_i) = x_i\\quad \\text{for } i=1,\\ldots, n.</math>\nThis homomorphism is surjective, and its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] is finitely generated (since integers form a [[Noetherian ring]]). Consider the matrix {{mvar|M}} with integer entries, such that the entries of its {{mvar|j}}th column are the coefficients of the {{mvar|j}}th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the [[cokernel]] of linear map defined by {{mvar|M}}. Conversely every [[integer matrix]] defines a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nIt follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of {{mvar|A}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the left by a [[unimodular matrix]] (that is an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of {{mvar|M}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the right by an unimodular matrix.\n\nThe [[Smith normal form]] of {{mvar|M}} is a matrix\n:<math>S=UMV,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}} are unimodular, and {{mvar|S}} is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries {{tmath|d_{1,1}, \\ldots, d_{k,k} }} are the first ones, and {{tmath|d_{j,j} }} is a divisor of {{tmath|d_{i,i} }} for {{math|''i'' > ''j''}}. The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group {{mvar|A}} is the [[direct sum]] \n:<math>\\Z^r \\oplus \\Z/d_{1,1}\\Z \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\Z/d_{k,k}\\Z,</math> \nwhere {{mvar|r}} is the number of zero rows at the bottom of {{mvar|r}} (and also the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the group). This is the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]].\n\nThe existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.\n\n== Infinite abelian groups ==\nThe simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z'''. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] ''A'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of ''r'' copies of '''Z''' and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number ''r'', called the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of ''A'', and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.\n\nBy contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups ''A'' in which the equation {{nowrap|1=''nx'' = ''a''}} admits a solution {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''A''}} for any natural number ''n'' and element ''a'' of ''A'', constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to '''Q''' and [[Prüfer group]]s '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>/'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> for various prime numbers ''p'', and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.<ref>For example, {{nowrap|'''Q'''/'''Z''' ≅ ∑<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>/'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.</ref> Moreover, if a divisible group ''A'' is a subgroup of an abelian group ''G'' then ''A'' admits a direct complement: a subgroup ''C'' of ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''A'' ⊕ ''C''}}. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''.\n\nTwo important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', exemplified by the groups '''Q'''/'''Z''' (periodic) and '''Q''' (torsion-free).\n\n=== Torsion groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''', if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Prüfer theorems]] state that if ''A'' is a periodic group, and it either has a '''bounded exponent''', i.e., {{nowrap|1=''nA'' = 0}} for some natural number ''n'', or is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|''p''-heights]] of the elements of ''A'' are finite for each ''p'', then ''A'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.<ref>Countability assumption in the second Prüfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''m''</sup>'''Z''' for all natural ''m'' is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.</ref> The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''m''</sup>'''Z''' in such a decomposition is an invariant of ''A''. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Prüfer theorem to countable abelian ''p''-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.\n\n=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of [[torsion-free abelian group]]s have been studied extensively:\n\n* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of '''Z'''\n* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]\n* [[Slender group]]s\n\nAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If ''A'' is an abelian group and ''T''(''A'') is its [[torsion subgroup]], then the factor group ''A''/''T''(''A'') is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of ''A'', so  ''A'' is ''not'' isomorphic to {{nowrap|''T''(''A'') ⊕ ''A''/''T''(''A'')}}. Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.\n\n=== Invariants and classification ===\nOne of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group ''A'' is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of ''A''. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of '''Q''' and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank ''r'' is a subgroup of '''Q'''<sup>''r''</sup>. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]] '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite '''Z'''-rank and the groups '''Z'''{{su|b=''p''|p=''n''}} with different ''n'' are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.\n\nThe classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], [[László Fuchs]], [[Phillip Griffith]], and [[David Arnold (mathematician)|David Arnold]], as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in ''[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]]'' for more recent findings.\n\n=== Additive groups of rings ===\nThe additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:\n\n* [[Tensor product]]\n* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups\n* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions.\n\n== Relation to other mathematical topics ==\nMany large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.\n\nThe collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[Group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] '''Ab''', the prototype of an [[abelian category]].\n\nNearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student {{harvs|first=Wanda|last=Szmielew|authorlink=Wanda Szmielew|year=1955|txt}} proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:\n*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;\n*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;\n*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.\n*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.\n*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in [[computational group theory]].\n\nMoreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:\n* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]] ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]]), the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present-day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;\n* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;\n* Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).\n\n== A note on the typography ==\nAmong mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase '''a''', rather than an uppercase '''A''', indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701231658/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html |archive-date=1 July 2013|dead-url=yes|access-date=3 July 2016|title=Abel Prize Awarded: The Mathematicians' Nobel}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Abelianization]]\n*[[Class field theory]]\n*[[Commutator subgroup]]\n*[[Dihedral group of order 6]], the smallest non-Abelian group\n*[[Symmetric group of degree 3]], also the smallest non-Abelian group\n*[[Elementary abelian group]]\n*[[Pontryagin duality]]\n*[[Pure injective module]]\n*[[Pure projective module]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=David |date=2004 |title=Galois Theory |publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]] |mr=2119052 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Fuchs |first=László |date=1970 |title=Infinite Abelian Groups |series=Pure and Applied Mathematics |volume=36-I |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |mr=0255673 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Fuchs |first=László |date=1973 |title=Infinite Abelian Groups |series=Pure and Applied Mathematics |volume=36-II |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |mr=0349869 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Phillip A. |last=Griffith  |date=1970 |title=Infinite Abelian group theory |series=Chicago Lectures in Mathematics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-30870-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Rose |first=John S. |date=2012 |title=A Course on Group Theory |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-68194-7|ref=harv}} Unabridged and unaltered republication of a work first published by the Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, in 1978.\n* {{cite book |last=Herstein |first=I.

      "text": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |Algebraic}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], particularly in [[algebraic geometry]], [[complex analysis]] and [[algebraic number theory]], an '''abelian variety''' is a [[Algebraic variety#Projective variety|projective algebraic variety]] that is also an [[algebraic group]], i.e., has a [[group law]] that can be defined by [[regular function]]s. Abelian varieties are at the same time among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry and indispensable tools for much research on other topics in algebraic geometry and number theory.\n\nAn abelian variety can be defined by equations having coefficients in any [[Field (mathematics)|field]]; the variety is then said to be defined ''over'' that field. Historically the first abelian varieties to be studied were those defined over the field of [[complex numbers]]. Such abelian varieties turn out to be exactly those [[Complex torus|complex tori]] that can be embedded into a complex  [[projective space]]. Abelian varieties defined over [[algebraic number fields]] are a special case, which is important also from the viewpoint of number theory. [[Localization of a ring|Localization]] techniques lead naturally from abelian varieties defined over number fields to ones defined over [[finite field]]s and various [[local field]]s. Since a number field is the fraction field of a [[Dedekind domain]], for any nonzero prime of your [[Dedekind domain]], there is a map from the Dedekind domain to the quotient of the Dedekind domain by the prime, which is a finite field for all finite primes. This induces a map from the fraction field to any such finite field. Given a curve with equation defined over the number field, we can apply this map to the coefficients to get a curve defined over some finite field, where the choices of finite field correspond to the finite primes of the number field.\n\nAbelian varieties appear naturally as [[Jacobian variety|Jacobian varieties]] (the connected components of zero in [[Picard variety|Picard varieties]]) and [[Albanese variety|Albanese varieties]] of other algebraic varieties.  The group law of an abelian variety is necessarily [[commutative]] and the variety is [[non-singular]]. An [[elliptic curve]] is an abelian variety of dimension 1. Abelian varieties have [[Kodaira dimension]] 0.\n\n== History and motivation ==\n\n{{details|History of manifolds and varieties}}\n\nIn the early  nineteenth century, the theory of [[elliptic function]]s succeeded  in giving a basis for the theory of [[elliptic integral]]s, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the [[square root]]s of [[cubic polynomial|cubic]] and [[quartic polynomial]]s. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say [[quintic polynomial|quintics]], what would happen?\n\nIn the work of [[Niels Abel]] and [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], the answer was formulated: this would involve functions of [[two complex variables]], having four independent ''periods'' (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an abelian variety of dimension 2 (an '''abelian surface'''): what would now be called the ''Jacobian of a [[hyperelliptic curve]] of genus 2''.\n\nAfter Abel and Jacobi, some of the most important contributors to the theory of abelian functions were [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]], [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Charles Émile Picard|Picard]]. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions. Eventually, in the 1920s, [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]] laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to be the first to use the name \"abelian variety\". It was [[André Weil]] in the 1940s who gave the subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.\n\nToday, abelian varieties form an important tool in number theory, in [[dynamical system]]s (more specifically in the study of [[Hamiltonian system]]s), and in algebraic geometry (especially [[Picard variety|Picard varieties]] and [[Albanese variety|Albanese varieties]]).\n\n== Analytic theory ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nA complex torus of dimension ''g'' is a [[torus]] of real dimension 2''g'' that carries the structure of a [[complex manifold]]. It can always be obtained as the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient]] of a ''g''-dimensional complex [[vector space]] by a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] of rank 2''g''.\nA complex abelian variety of dimension ''g'' is a complex torus of dimension ''g'' that is also a projective [[algebraic variety]] over the field of complex numbers. Since they are complex tori, abelian varieties carry the structure of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. A [[morphism]] of abelian varieties is a morphism of the underlying algebraic varieties that preserves the [[identity element]] for the group structure. An '''[[isogeny]]''' is a finite-to-one morphism.\n\nWhen a complex torus carries the structure of an algebraic variety, this structure is necessarily unique. In the case ''g'' = 1, the notion of abelian variety is the same as that of [[elliptic curve]], and every complex torus gives rise to such a curve; for ''g'' > 1 it has been known since [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] that the algebraic variety condition imposes extra constraints on a complex torus.\n\n=== Riemann conditions ===\nThe following criterion by Riemann decides whether or not a given complex torus is an abelian variety, i.e. whether or not it can be embedded into a projective space. Let ''X'' be a ''g''-dimensional torus given as ''X'' = ''V''/''L'' where ''V'' is a complex vector space of dimension ''g'' and ''L'' is a lattice in ''V''. Then ''X'' is an abelian variety if and only if there exists a [[positive definite bilinear form|positive definite]] [[hermitian form]] on ''V'' whose [[imaginary part]] takes [[integer|integral]] values on ''L''&times;''L''. Such a form on ''X'' is usually called a (non-degenerate) [[Riemann form]].  Choosing a basis for ''V'' and ''L'', one can make this condition more explicit. There are several equivalent formulations of this; all of them are known as the Riemann conditions.\n\n=== The Jacobian of an algebraic curve ===\nEvery algebraic curve ''C'' of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' ≥ 1 is associated with an abelian variety ''J'' of dimension ''g'', by means of an analytic map of ''C'' into ''J''. As a torus, ''J'' carries a commutative [[group (mathematics)|group]] structure, and the image of ''C'' generates ''J'' as a group. More accurately,     ''J'' is covered by ''C'':<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bruin |first1=N. |title=N-Covers of Hyperelliptic Curves |url=http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/flynn/arts/art21.pdf |publisher=Math Department Oxford University |accessdate=14 January 2015}} ''J'' is covered by ''C''<sup>''g''</sup>:</ref> any point in ''J'' comes from a ''g''-tuple of points in ''C''. The study of differential forms on ''C'', which give rise to the ''[[abelian integral]]s'' with which the theory started, can be derived from the simpler, translation-invariant theory of differentials on ''J''. The abelian variety ''J'' is called the '''Jacobian variety''' of ''C'', for any non-singular curve ''C'' over the complex numbers. From the point of view of [[birational geometry]], its [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] is the fixed field of the [[symmetric group]] on ''g'' letters acting on the function field of ''C''<sup>''g''</sup>.\n\n=== Abelian functions ===\nAn '''abelian function''' is a [[meromorphic function]] on an abelian variety, which may be regarded therefore as a periodic function of ''n'' complex variables, having 2''n'' independent periods; equivalently, it is a function in the function field of an abelian variety.\nFor example, in the nineteenth century there was much interest in [[hyperelliptic integral]]s that may be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. This comes down to asking that ''J'' is a product of elliptic curves, [[up to]] an isogeny.\n\n{{See also|abelian integral}}\n\n=== Important Theorems ===\nOne important structure theorem of Abelian varieties is '''Matsusaka's theorem'''. It states that over an algebraically closed field every abelian variety <math>A</math> is the quotient of the Jacobian of some curve; that is, there is some surjection of abelian varieties <math>J \\to A</math> where <math>J</math> is a Jacobian. This theorem remains true if the ground field is infinite.<ref> Milne, J.S., Jacobian varieties, in Arithmetic Geometry, eds Cornell and Silverman, Springer-Verlag, 1986</ref>\n\n== Algebraic definition ==\nTwo equivalent definitions of abelian variety over a general field ''k'' are commonly in use:\n* a [[connected space|connected]] and [[Complete variety|complete]] [[algebraic group]] over ''k''\n* a [[connected space|connected]] and [[projective variety|projective]] [[algebraic group]] over ''k''.\nWhen the base is the field of complex numbers, these notions coincide with the previous definition. Over all bases, [[elliptic curve]]s are abelian varieties of dimension 1.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Weil used the first definition (over an arbitrary base field) but could not at first prove that it implied the second. Only in 1948 did he prove that complete algebraic groups can be embedded into projective space. Meanwhile, in order to make the proof of the [[Generalised Riemann hypothesis|Riemann hypothesis]] for [[algebraic curve|curves]] over [[finite field]]s that he had announced in 1940 work, he had to introduce the notion of an [[abstract variety]] and to rewrite the foundations of algebraic geometry to work with varieties without projective embeddings (see also the history section in the [[Algebraic Geometry]] article).\n\n== Structure of the group of points ==\nBy the definitions, an abelian variety is a group variety. Its group of points can be proven to be [[abelian group|commutative]].\n\nFor '''C''', and hence by the [[Lefschetz principle]] for every [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero, the [[torsion group]] of an abelian variety of dimension ''g'' is [[isomorphic]] to ('''Q'''/'''Z''')<sup>2''g''</sup>. Hence, its ''n''-torsion part is isomorphic to ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>2''g''</sup>, i.e. the product of 2''g'' copies of the [[cyclic group]] of order ''n''.\n\nWhen the base field is an algebraically closed field of characteristic ''p'', the ''n''-torsion is still isomorphic to ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>2''g''</sup> when ''n'' and ''p'' are [[coprime]]. When ''n'' and ''p'' are not coprime, the same result can be recovered provided one interprets it as saying that the ''n''-torsion defines a finite flat group scheme of rank 2''g''. If instead of looking at the full scheme structure on the ''n''-torsion, one considers only the geometric points, one obtains a new invariant for varieties in characteristic ''p'' (the so-called ''p''-rank when ''n'' = ''p'').\n\nThe group of [[rational point|''k''-rational points]] for a [[global field]] ''k'' is [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] by the [[Mordell-Weil theorem]]. Hence, by the structure theorem for [[finitely generated abelian group]]s, it is isomorphic to a product of a [[free abelian group]] '''Z'''<sup>''r''</sup> and a finite commutative group for some non-negative integer ''r'' called the '''rank''' of the abelian variety. Similar results hold for some other classes of fields ''k''.\n\n==Products==\n\nThe product of an abelian variety ''A'' of dimension ''m'', and an abelian variety ''B'' of dimension ''n'', over the same field, is an abelian variety of dimension ''m'' + ''n''. An abelian variety is '''simple''' if it is not [[isogeny|isogenous]] to a product of abelian varieties of lower dimension. Any abelian variety is isogenous to a product of simple abelian varieties.\n\n== Polarisation and dual abelian variety ==\n\n=== Dual abelian variety ===\n{{main|Dual abelian variety}}\nTo an abelian variety ''A'' over a field ''k'', one associates a '''dual abelian variety''' ''A''<sup>v</sup> (over the same field), which is the solution to the following [[moduli problem]]. A family of degree 0 line bundles parametrised by a ''k''-variety ''T'' is defined to be a [[line bundle]] ''L'' on\n''A''×''T'' such that\n# for all ''t'' in ''T'', the restriction of ''L'' to ''A''×{''t''} is a degree 0 line bundle,\n# the restriction of ''L'' to {0}×''T'' is a trivial line bundle (here 0 is the identity of ''A'').\n\nThen there is a variety ''A''<sup>v</sup> and a family of degree 0 line bundles ''P'', the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by ''A''<sup>v</sup> such that a family ''L'' on ''T'' is associated a unique morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''A''<sup>v</sup> so that ''L'' is isomorphic to the pullback of ''P'' along the morphism 1<sub>A</sub>×''f'': ''A''×''T'' → ''A''×''A''<sup>v</sup>. Applying this to the case when ''T'' is a point, we see that the points of ''A''<sup>v</sup> correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on ''A'', so there is a natural group operation on ''A''<sup>v</sup> given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.\n\nThis association is a duality in the sense that there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between the double dual ''A''<sup>vv</sup> and ''A'' (defined via the Poincaré bundle) and that it is [[contravariant functor]]ial, i.e. it associates to all morphisms ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' dual morphisms ''f''<sup>v</sup>: ''B''<sup>v</sup> → ''A''<sup>v</sup> in a compatible way. The ''n''-torsion of an abelian variety and the ''n''-torsion of its dual are [[Pontryagin duality|dual]] to each other when ''n'' is coprime to the characteristic of the base. In general - for all ''n'' - the ''n''-torsion [[group scheme]]s of dual abelian varieties are [[Cartier dual]]s of each other. This generalises the [[Weil pairing]] for elliptic curves.\n\n=== Polarisations ===\n\nA '''polarisation''' of an abelian variety is an ''[[isogeny]]'' from an abelian variety to its dual that is symmetric with respect to ''double-duality'' for abelian varieties and for which the pullback of the Poincaré bundle along the associated graph morphism is ample (so it is analogous to a positive-definite quadratic form). Polarised abelian varieties have finite [[automorphism group]]s. A '''principal polarisation''' is a polarisation that is an isomorphism. Jacobians of curves are naturally equipped with a principal polarisation as soon as one picks an arbitrary rational base point on the curve, and the curve can be reconstructed from its polarised Jacobian when the genus is > 1. Not all principally polarised abelian varieties are Jacobians of curves; see the [[Schottky problem]]. A polarisation induces a [[Rosati involution]] on the [[endomorphism ring]] <math>\\mathrm{End}(A)\\otimes\\mathbb{Q}</math> of ''A''.\n\n=== Polarisations over the complex numbers ===\nOver the complex numbers, a '''polarised abelian variety''' can also be defined as an abelian variety ''A'' together with a choice of a Riemann form ''H''. Two Riemann forms ''H''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> are called [[equivalence relation|equivalent]] if there are positive integers ''n'' and ''m'' such that ''nH''<sub>1</sub>=''mH''<sub>2</sub>. A choice of an equivalence class of Riemann forms on ''A'' is called a '''polarisation''' of ''A''. A morphism of polarised abelian varieties is a morphism ''A'' → ''B'' of abelian varieties such that the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the Riemann form on ''B'' to ''A'' is equivalent to the given form on ''A''.\n\n== Abelian scheme ==\nOne can also define abelian varieties [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]-theoretically and  [[relative to a base]]. This allows for a uniform treatment of phenomena such as reduction mod ''p'' of abelian varieties (see [[Arithmetic of abelian varieties]]), and parameter-families of abelian varieties. An '''abelian scheme''' over a base scheme ''S'' of relative dimension ''g'' is a [[Proper morphism|proper]], [[smooth morphism|smooth]] [[group scheme]] over ''S'' whose [[geometric fiber]]s are [[connected space|connected]] and of dimension ''g''. The fibers of an abelian scheme are abelian varieties, so one could think of an abelian scheme over S as being a family of abelian varieties parametrised by&nbsp;''S''.\n\nFor an abelian scheme ''A'' / ''S'', the group of ''n''-torsion points forms a [[finite flat group scheme]]. The union of the ''p''<sup>''n''</sup>-torsion points, for all ''n'', forms a [[p-divisible group]]. [[Deformation theory|Deformations]] of abelian schemes are, according to the [[Serre–Tate theorem]], governed by the deformation properties of the associated ''p''-divisible groups.\n\n==Semiabelian variety==\nA '''semiabelian variety''' is a commutative group variety which is an extension of an abelian variety by a [[Algebraic torus|torus]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|Motive]]s\n* [[Timeline of abelian varieties]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation | last1=Birkenhake | first1=Christina | last2=Lange | first2=H. | title=Complex Abelian varieties | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-54747-3 | year=1992}}.

Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age, but was sent to the [[Oslo Cathedral School|Christiania Cathedral School]] in 1810 to complete his secondary education. There he undertook extracurricular studies in [[mathematics]]. He enrolled as a student at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in 1814, a [[Norway in 1814|turbulent year]] in Norwegian history. Norway had been a province of [[Denmark]] since 1397, but had come under [[Sweden|Swedish]] control in the January 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]]. Following Norway's declaration of independence in the [[Norwegian Constitution|Constitution of 17 May]], Sweden responded by waging a [[Swedish campaign against Norway (1814)|military campaign against Norway]] during the summer of 1814.

The school principal, [[Jacob Rosted]], had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the [[Sanskrit language]] among others.

The 274-page book was named ''Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel'' (''Textbook in Mathematics. Part One''). In 1827 he followed with the second volume, ''Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel'' (''Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two''), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, the purpose of the books was to instill [[logical]] thinking. For instance, in the field [[geometry]], it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.<ref name=bio/>\n\nIn 1826, Holmboe was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University.<ref name=bio/> Some claimed that he owed his appointment to Abel's absence, as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time.<ref name=abel/> Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include ''Stereometrie'' (''Stereometry'') (1833), ''Plan- og sfærisk Trigonometrie'' (''Plan and Spherical Trigonometry'') (1834), and ''Lærebog i den høiere Mathematik'' (''Textbook of Advanced Mathematics'') (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including [[Ole Jacob Broch]] (born 1818).<ref name=bio/>\n\nAt the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who had become a professor there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote a review of the book for the newspaper ''[[Morgenbladet]]'', in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians.

One of his most noted accomplishments is his proof of [[Lusin's conjecture]].<ref name=mathgene> {{MathGenealogy|id=19781}}</ref><ref name=mactutor>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Carleson}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHe was a student of [[Arne Beurling]] and received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1950. He is a [[professor emeritus]] at Uppsala University, the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and has served as director of the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] in [[Djursholm]] outside Stockholm 1968–1984. Between 1978 and 1982 he served as president of the [[International Mathematical Union]].\n\nCarleson married Butte Jonsson in 1953, and they had two children: Caspar (born 1955) and Beatrice (born 1958).\n\n==Work==\nHis work has included the solution of some [[mathematical problems|outstanding problems]], using techniques from  [[combinatorics]] and [[probability theory]] (especially [[stopping time]]s). In the theory of [[Hardy space]]s, Carleson's contributions include the [[corona theorem]] (1962) and  establishing the [[almost everywhere]] [[convergence of Fourier series]] for [[square-integrable function]]s (now known as [[Carleson's theorem]]). He is also known for the theory of [[Carleson measure]]s.\n\nIn the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, Carleson has worked in [[complex dynamics]].\n\nIn addition to publishing some landmark papers, Carleson has also published two books: First, an influential book on [[potential theory]], \"Selected Problems on Exceptional Sets\" (Van Nostrand, 1967), and  second a book on the [[dynamic system|iteration]] of [[analytic function]]s, ''Complex Dynamics'' (Springer, 1993, in collaboration with T.

His first accomplishment in this field was a formula for the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms, in which particular types of Harish-Chandra's discrete series appeared.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publications.ias.edu/rpl/section/14|work=IAS|title=IAS publication paper 14|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=156362|title=MR review|work=Mathscinet|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe next constructed an analytical theory of [[Eisenstein series]] for reductive groups of [[Linear algebraic group#Tori|rank]] greater than one, thus extending work of [[Hans Maass]], Walter Roelcke, and [[Atle Selberg]] from the early 1950s for rank one groups such as {{math|''SL''(2)}}. This amounted to describing in general terms the continuous [[Spectral geometry|spectra]] of arithmetic quotients, and showing that all automorphic forms arise in terms of cusp forms and the residues of Eisenstein series induced from cusp forms on smaller subgroups. As a first application, he proved the [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]] for the large class of arbitrary simply connected [[Chevalley group]]s defined over the rational numbers. Previously this had been known only in a few isolated cases and for certain classical groups where it could be shown by induction<ref>Langlands, Robert P. (1966), \"The volume of the fundamental domain for some arithmetical subgroups of Chevalley groups\", Algebraic Groups and Discontinuous Subgroups, Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Providence, R.I.: Amer. Math. Soc., pp. 143–148, MR 0213362</ref>\n\nAs a second application of this work, he was able to show [[meromorphic function|meromorphic]] continuation for a large class of [[L-function|{{math|''L''}}-functions]] arising in the theory of automorphic forms, not previously known to have them. These occurred in the constant terms of Eisenstein series, and meromorphicity as well as a weak [[functional equation (L-function)|functional equation]] were a consequence of functional equations for Eisenstein series. This work led in turn, in the winter of 1966–67, to the now well known conjectures<ref name=\"publications.ias.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://publications.ias.edu/rpl/paper/43|title=IAS paper 43|work=IAS|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> making up what is often called the [[Langlands program]]. Very roughly speaking, they propose a huge generalization of previously known examples of reciprocity, including (a) classical [[class field theory]], in which characters of local and arithmetic abelian [[Galois group]]s are identified with characters of local [[multiplicative group]]s and the idele quotient group, respectively; (b) earlier results of [[Martin Eichler]] and [[Goro Shimura]] in which the [[Hasse–Weil zeta function]]s of arithmetic quotients of the [[upper half plane]] are identified with {{math|''L''}}-functions occurring in [[Erich Hecke|Hecke]]'s theory of [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] automorphic forms. These conjectures were first posed in relatively complete form in a famous letter to Weil,<ref name=\"publications.ias.edu\"/> written in January 1967. It was in this letter that he introduced what has since become known as the {{math|''L''}}-group and along with it, the notion of functoriality.\n\nThe book by [[Hervé Jacquet]] and Langlands on {{math|''GL''(2)}} presented a theory of automorphic forms for the [[general linear group]] {{math|''GL''(2)}}, establishing among other things the [[Jacquet–Langlands correspondence]] showing that functoriality was capable of explaining very precisely how automorphic forms for {{math|''GL''(2)}} related to those for [[quaternion algebra]]s. This book applied the adelic [[Selberg trace formula|trace formula]] for {{math|''GL''(2)}} and quaternion algebras to do this. Subsequently [[James Arthur (mathematician)|James Arthur]], a student of Langlands while he was at Yale, successfully developed the trace formula for groups of higher rank. This has become a major tool in attacking functoriality in general, and in particular has been applied to demonstrating that the [[Hasse–Weil zeta function]]s of certain [[Shimura variety|Shimura varieties]] are among the {{math|''L''}}-functions arising from automorphic forms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publications.ias.edu/rpl/paper/60|work=Institute of Advanced Studies|title=IAS paper 60|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe functoriality conjecture is far from proven, but a special case (the octahedral [[Artin L-function#The Artin conjecture|Artin conjecture]], proved by Langlands<ref>Langlands, Robert P, Base change for GL(2). Annals of Mathematics Studies, 96.

In 1995, Langlands started a collaboration with [[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Bill Casselman]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] with the aim of posting nearly all of his writings—including publications, preprints, as well as selected correspondence—on the Internet. The correspondence includes a copy of the original letter to Weil that introduced the {{math|''L''}}-group.

Interest in the \"Lax conjecture\" grew as mathematicians working in several different areas recognized the importance of its implications in their field, until it was finally proven to be true in 2003.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Adrian S.|last2=Parrilo|first2=Pablo A.|last3=Ramana|first3=Motakuri V.|year=2005|title=The Lax conjecture is true|journal=[[Proc.

As a high school student at [[Stuyvesant High School]], Lax took no math classes but did compete on the school math team. During this time, he met with [[John von Neumann]], [[Richard Courant]], and [[Paul Erdős]], who introduced him to [[Albert Einstein]]. \n\nAs he was still 17 when he finished high school, he could avoid military service, and was able to study for three semesters at [[New York University]]. He attended a [[complex analysis]] class in the role of a student, but ended up taking over as instructor. He met his future wife, [[Anneli Cahn Lax|Anneli Cahn]] (married to her first husband at that time) in this class.<ref name=\"mmp\" /><ref name=\"conv\" />\n\nBefore being able to complete his studies, Lax was drafted into the U.S. Army. After basic training, the Army sent him to [[Texas A&M University]] for more studies. He was then sent to [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and soon afterwards to the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], [[New Mexico]]. At Los Alamos, he began working as a calculator operator, but eventually moved on to higher-level mathematics. \n\nAfter the war ended, he remained with the Army at Los Alamos for another year, while taking courses at the [[University of New Mexico]], then studied at [[Stanford University]] for a semester with [[Gábor Szegő]] and [[George Pólya]].<ref name=\"mmp\" />\n\nLax returned to NYU for the 1946–1947 academic year, and by pooling credits from the four universities at which he had studied, he graduated that year. He stayed at NYU for his graduate studies, marrying Anneli in 1948 and earning a Ph.D. in 1949 under the supervision of [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]].<ref name=\"mmp\">{{citation|contribution=Peter D.

He continued on to graduate school at Princeton under the direction of [[Ralph Fox]] and submitted his dissertation, entitled \"[[Regular isotopy|Isotopy]] of [[link (knot theory)|Link]]s\", which concerned [[link group]]s (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, in 1954. Upon completing his doctorate he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] from 1970 to 1990.\n\nHis students have included [[Tadatoshi Akiba]], [[Jon Folkman]], [[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]], [[Laurent C. Siebenmann]], and [[Michael Spivak]]. His wife, [[Dusa McDuff]], is a professor of mathematics at [[Barnard College]].\n\n==Research==\nOne of his published works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of [[Seven-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[Hypersphere|spheres]] with nonstandard differential structure. Later, with [[Michel Kervaire]], he showed that the 7-sphere has 15 [[differentiable structure]]s (28 if one considers orientation).<br/>An ''n''-sphere with nonstandard differential structure is called an [[exotic sphere]], a term coined by Milnor. [[Egbert Brieskorn]] found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a [[Singular point of a curve|singular point]] is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently Milnor worked on the [[topology]] of isolated [[Singular point of a curve|singular points]] of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the [[Milnor fibration]] whose fiber has the [[homotopy]] type of a bouquet of μ spheres where μ is known as the [[Milnor number]]. Milnor's 1968 book on his theory inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area which continues to mature to this day.\n\nIn 1961 Milnor disproved the [[Hauptvermutung]] by illustrating two [[simplicial complex]]es which are [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] but [[Combinatorial topology|combinatorially]] distinct.\n\nIn 1984 Milnor introduced a definition of [[attractor]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milnor|first=John|date=1985|title=On the concept of attractor|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103942677|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|language=EN|volume=99|issue=2|pages=177–195|issn=0010-3616}}</ref>  The objects generalize standard attractors, include so-called [[unstable attractor]]s and are now known as [[Milnor attractor]]s.\n\nMilnor's current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of ''Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics'':\n\n<blockquote>It is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor's work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor's approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with [[William Thurston|Thurston]]. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré's]] work on [[Diffeomorphism#Topology|circle diffeomorphisms]], which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor's work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyubich|first=Mikhail|title=Holomorphic Dynamics and Renormalization: A Volume in Honour of John Milnor's 75th Birthday|year=1993|location=Houston, Texas|pages=85–92|authorlink=Milnor's Program in Dynamics|editor=Michael Yampolsky|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe was an editor of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1962 Milnor was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] for his work in differential topology.

He learned that an Italian mathematician, [[Ennio de Giorgi]], had published a proof just months before Nash achieved his. Each took different routes to get to their solutions. The two mathematicians met each other at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] of [[New York University]] during the summer of 1956. It has been speculated that if only one had solved the problem, he would have been given the [[Fields Medal]] for the proof.<ref name=\"Nash1995\" />\n\nIn 2011, the [[National Security Agency]] declassified letters written by Nash in the 1950s, in which he had proposed a new [[encryption]]–decryption machine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/press-releases/2012/nash-exhibit.shtml |website=[[National Security Agency]] |title=2012 Press Release – National Cryptologic Museum Opens New Exhibit on Dr. John Nash |access-date=February 25, 2012}}</ref> The letters show that Nash had anticipated many concepts of modern [[cryptography]], which are based on [[Computational hardness assumption|computational hardness]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://agtb.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/john-nashs-letter-to-the-nsa/ |title=John Nash's Letter to the NSA; Turing's Invisible Hand |access-date=February 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Mental illness ==\nAlthough Nash's [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] first began to manifest in the form of [[paranoia]], his wife later described his behavior as erratic.

There, he was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. According to the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', or DSM, a person suffering from the disorder is typically dominated by relatively stable, often paranoid, fixed beliefs that are either false, over-imaginative or unrealistic, and usually accompanied by experiences of seemingly real perception of something not actually present.

After 1970, he was never committed to a hospital again, and he refused any further medication. According to Nash, the film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' inaccurately implied he was taking what were the new [[atypical antipsychotic]]s of the time period. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter who was worried about the film encouraging people with the disorder to stop taking their medication.<ref>{{cite web|first=Marika|last=Greihsel|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-interview.html|title=John F.

De Lardé credits his [[Recovery approach|recovery]] to maintaining \"a quiet life\" with [[social support]].<ref name=\"Nasar1994\" />\n\nNash dated the start of what he termed \"mental disturbances\" to the early months of 1959, when his wife was pregnant.

He only temporarily renounced his \"dream-like delusional hypotheses\" after being in a hospital long enough to decide he would superficially conform&nbsp;— to behave normally or to experience \"enforced rationality\". Only gradually on his own did he \"intellectually reject\" some of the \"delusionally influenced\" and \"politically oriented\" thinking as a waste of effort. By 1995, however, even though he was \"thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists,\" he said he felt more limited.<ref name=\"Nash1995\" /><ref name=Experiences>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_08.html \"John Nash: My experience with mental illness\"]. PBS Interview,2002.</ref>\n\nNash wrote in 1994:\n\n{{quote|I spent times of the order of five to eight months in hospitals in New Jersey, always on an involuntary basis and always attempting a legal argument for release. And it did happen that when I had been long enough hospitalized that I would finally renounce my delusional hypotheses and revert to thinking of myself as a human of more conventional circumstances and return to mathematical research. In these interludes of, as it were, enforced rationality, I did succeed in doing some respectable mathematical research. Thus there came about the research for \"Le problème de Cauchy pour les équations différentielles d'un fluide général\"; the idea that Prof. <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Heisuke Hironaka|Heisuke]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Hironaka called \"the Nash blowing-up transformation\"; and those of \"Arc Structure of Singularities\" and \"Analyticity of Solutions of Implicit Function Problems with Analytic Data\".\n\nBut after my return to the dream-like delusional hypotheses in the later 60s I became a person of delusionally influenced thinking but of relatively moderate behavior and thus tended to avoid hospitalization and the direct attention of psychiatrists.\n\nThus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists.<ref name=\"Nash1995\" />}}\n\n== Recognition and later career ==\n[[File:John Forbes Nash, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|Nash pictured in 2011]]\nIn 1978, Nash was awarded the [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] in 1999.\n\nIn 1994, he received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (along with [[John Harsanyi]] and [[Reinhard Selten]]) as a result of his [[game theory]] work as a Princeton graduate student.<ref>Nasar (2002), p. xiii.</ref> In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was {{em|the}} John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the [[Bank of Sweden]]'s Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health ability to receive the award in recognition of his early work.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Work of John Nash in Game Theory|journal=Nobel Seminar|date=December 8, 1994|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810134711/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-lecture.pdf |access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nNash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific studies.\n\nNash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being \"insane\" and not fitting into a usual social function, to being \"on [[Strike action|strike]]\" from an economic point of view. He advanced views in [[evolutionary psychology]] about the value of human diversity and the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.<ref>{{cite web |last=Neubauer |first=David |date=June 1, 2007 |url=http://health.yahoo.com/experts/depression/8207/john-nash-and-a-beautiful-mind-on-strike/ |title=John Nash and a Beautiful Mind on Strike |website=Yahoo!

Within the framing theorem that people can be so controlled and motivated by money that they may not be able to reason rationally about it, he criticized interest groups that promote quasi-doctrines based on [[Keynesian economics]] that permit manipulative short-term [[inflation]] and [[debt]] tactics that ultimately undermine currencies. He suggested a global \"industrial consumption [[price index]]\" system that would support the development of more \"[[ideal money]]\" that people could trust rather than more unstable \"bad money\". He noted that some of his thinking parallels economist and [[political philosopher]] [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s thinking regarding money and a nontypical viewpoint of the function of the authorities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nash, John |year=2002 |jstor=1061553 |title=Ideal Money |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=4–11 |doi=10.2307/1061553}}</ref><ref>Zuckerman, Julia (April 27, 2005) [http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/04/27/nobel-winner-nash-critiques-economic-theory/ \"Nobel winner Nash critiques economic theory\"].

Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lardé divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lardé's house as a boarder.

Together with Kolmogorov, he showed that even for \"unpredictable\" dynamic systems, the level of unpredictability of motion can be described mathematically.  In their idea, which became known as [[Measure-preserving dynamical system#Measure-theoretic entropy|Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy]], a system with zero entropy is entirely predictable, while a system with non-zero entropy has an unpredictability factor directly related to the amount of entropy.<ref name=Nature />\n\nIn 1963, Sinai introduced the idea of [[dynamical billiards]], also known as \"Sinai Billiards\".  In this idealized system, a particle bounces around inside a square boundary without loss of energy.  Inside the square is a circular wall, of which the particle also bounces off.  He then proved that for most initial trajectories of the ball, this system is [[ergodic]], that is, after a long time, the amount of that time the ball will have spent in any given region on the surface of the table is approximately proportional to the area of that region.  It was the first time anyone proved a dynamic system was ergodic.<ref name=Nature />\n\nAlso in 1963, Sinai announced a proof of the [[ergodic hypothesis]] for a gas consisting of ''n'' hard spheres confined to a box. The complete proof, however, was never published, and in 1987 Sinai declared that the announcement was premature. The problem remains open to this day.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2691/1/UffinkFinal.pdf|title=Compendium of the foundations of classical statistical physics|last=Uffink|first=Jos|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1960 to 1971, Sinai was a researcher in the Laboratory of Probabilistic and Statistical Methods at Moscow State University.  In 1971 he accepted a position as senior researcher at the [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in Russia, while continuing to teach at Moscow State.

He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986.

He has held visiting positions at [[Stanford University]] (1974), [[McGill University]] (1980), the [[University of South Carolina]] (1981–1983) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1985–1986).\n\n==Work==\nEndre Szemerédi has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]]: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive [[upper density]] then it contains arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s. This is now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], which has become an important lemma in [[combinatorics]], being used for instance in [[property testing]] for graphs and in the theory of [[graph limit]]s.\n\nHe is also known for the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]] in [[Incidence geometry (structure)|incidence geometry]] and the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] and [[Ruzsa–Szemerédi problem]] in [[graph theory]]. [[Miklós Ajtai]] and Szemerédi proved the [[corners theorem]], an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the [[Szemerédi's theorem|Szemerédi theorem]]. With Ajtai and [[János Komlós (mathematician)|János Komlós]] he proved the ''ct''<sup>2</sup>/log ''t'' upper bound for the [[Ramsey number]] ''R''(3,''t''), and constructed a [[sorting network]] of optimal depth. With Ajtai, [[Václav Chvátal]], and [[Monty Newborn|Monroe M. Newborn]], Szemerédi proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges, where {{nowrap|''m'' > 4''n''}} has at least {{nowrap|''m''<sup>3</sup> / 64''n''<sup>2</sup>}} [[Crossing lemma|crossings]].  With [[Paul Erdős]], he proved the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]] on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, [[Nick Pippenger]], and [[William T. Trotter|William Trotter]], he established a separation between [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|nondeterministic]] [[linear time]] and [[Deterministic computation|deterministic]] linear time, in the spirit of the infamous [[P versus NP problem]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nSzemerédi has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science.

He is professor emeritus at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He was awarded the [[Abel Prize]] in 2010.\n\n==Biography==\nTate was born in [[Minneapolis]]. His father, [[John Torrence Tate Sr.|John Tate Sr.]], was a professor of physics at the [[University of Minnesota]], and a longtime editor of ''[[Physical Review]]''. His mother, Lois Beatrice Fossler, was a high school English teacher. Tate Jr.  received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from [[Harvard University]], and entered the doctoral program in physics at [[Princeton University]]. He later transferred to the mathematics department and received his PhD in 1950 as a student of [[Emil Artin]]. Tate taught at Harvard for 36 years before joining the University of Texas in 1990 as a Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tate}}</ref> He retired from the Texas mathematics department in 2009, and returned to Harvard as a professor emeritus. He currently resides in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] with his wife Carol. He has three daughters with his first wife Karin Tate.<ref name=\"stat\"/>\n\n==Mathematical work==\n[[Tate's thesis]] (1950) on [[Fourier analysis]] in [[number fields]] has become one of the ingredients for the modern theory of [[automorphic forms]] and their [[L-functions]], notably by its use of the [[adele ring]], its self-duality and harmonic analysis on it; independently and a little earlier, [[Kenkichi Iwasawa]] obtained a similar theory.  Together with his teacher [[Emil Artin]], Tate gave a cohomological treatment of [[global class field theory]], using techniques of [[group cohomology]] applied to the [[idele class group]] and [[Galois cohomology]].<ref name=\"xin\">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sci/2010-03/25/c_13223596.htm|title=American mathematician John Tate wins 2010 Abel Prize|author=|publisher=Xinhua.net|date=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822035034/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sci/2010-03/25/c_13223596.htm|archivedate=2010-08-22|df=}}</ref> This treatment made more transparent some of the algebraic structures in the previous approaches to class field theory which used central division algebras to compute the [[Brauer group]] of a global field.\n\nSubsequently, Tate introduced what are now known as [[Tate cohomology group]]s. In the decades following that discovery he extended the reach of Galois cohomology with the [[Poitou–Tate duality]], the [[Tate–Shafarevich group]], and relations with [[algebraic K-theory]]. With [[Jonathan Lubin]], he recast [[local class field theory]] by the use of [[formal group]]s, creating the [[Lubin–Tate formal group|Lubin–Tate local theory]] of [[complex multiplication]].\n\nHe has also made a number of individual and important contributions to [[p-adic]] theory; for example, Tate's invention of [[rigid analytic space]]s can be said to have spawned the entire field of [[rigid analytic geometry]]. He found a [[p-adic numbers|p-adic]] analogue of [[Hodge theory]], now called [[Hodge–Tate theory]], which has blossomed into another central technique of modern [[algebraic number theory]].<ref name=\"xin\"/> Other innovations of his include the '[[Tate curve]]' parametrization for certain p-adic [[elliptic curve]]s and  the [[Barsotti–Tate group|p-divisible (Tate–Barsotti) groups]].\n\nMany of his results were not immediately published and some of them were written up by [[Serge Lang]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Joseph H. Silverman]] and others. Tate and Serre collaborated on a paper on [[good reduction]] of [[abelian varieties]]. The classification of abelian varieties over [[finite field]]s was carried out by Taira Honda and Tate (the [[Honda–Tate theorem]]).<ref>J.T. Tate,   \"Classes d'isogénie des variétés abéliennes sur un corps fini (d' après T. Honda)\", Sem. Bourbaki Exp. 352, Lect. notes in math., 179, Springer  (1971)</ref>\n\nThe [[Tate conjecture]]s are the equivalent for [[étale cohomology]] of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. They relate to the Galois action on the l-adic cohomology of an algebraic variety, identifying a space of '[[Tate cycle]]s' (the fixed cycles for a suitably [[Tate-twist]]ed action) that conjecturally picks out the algebraic cycles. A special case of the conjectures, which are open in the general case, was involved in the proof of the [[Mordell conjecture]] by [[Gerd Faltings]].\n\nTate has also had a major influence on the development of number theory through his role as a\nPh.D. advisor.

From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]], and then he returned to Princeton.

The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=How Math's Most Famous Proof Nearly Broke|url=http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke|publisher=Nautilus|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=28 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.<ref name=\"Singh\">[[Simon Singh]] (1997).

There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said. ... Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Taniyama conjecture. Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's last theorem was true. Q.E.D.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!'

This work settles many of the basic problems on [[cyclotomic field]]s which go back to Kummer, and is unquestionably one of the major advances in number theory in our times. Earlier he did deep work on the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves with complex multiplication – one offshoot of this was his proof of an unexpected and beautiful generalisation of the classical explicit reciprocity laws of Artin–Hasse–Iwasawa. Most recently, he has made new progress on the construction of ℓ-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the \"main conjecture\" for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields – again a remarkable result since none of the classical tools of cyclotomic fields applied to these problems.<ref name=\"royal\">{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1989%2F39%27) |title = EC/1989/39: Wiles, Sir Andrew John |publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wikiquote-inline}}\n*{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Abel Prize laureates}}\n{{Copley_Medallists_2001–2050}}\n{{Schock Prize laureates}}\n{{Wolf Prize in Mathematics}}\n{{Shaw Prize}}\n{{FRS 1989}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wiles, Andrew John}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Clare College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Clay Research Award recipients]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Copley Medal]]\n[[Category:English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Regius Professors of Mathematics (University of Oxford)]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Merton College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Fermat's Last Theorem]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n[[Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars]]\n[[Category:King Faisal International Prize recipients for Science]]\n[[Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:MacArthur Fellows]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Number theorists]]\n[[Category:People educated at The Leys School]]\n[[Category:People from Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Princeton University faculty]]\n[[Category:Rolf Schock Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:Royal Medal winners]]\n[[Category:Recipients of awards from the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study]]\n[[Category:Whitehead Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates]]\n[[Category:Abel Prize laureates]]"

      "text": "{{About|addition theorems in general|specific addition theorems for trigonometric functions|angle addition formulas}}\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''addition theorem''' is a formula such as that for the [[exponential function]]\n\n:''e''<sup>''x'' + ''y''</sup> = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>·''e''<sup>''y''</sup> \n\nthat expresses, for a particular function ''f'', ''f''(''x'' + ''y'') in terms of ''f''(''x'') and ''f''(''y''). Slightly more generally, as is the case with the [[trigonometric function]]s ''sin'' and ''cos'', several functions may be involved; this is more apparent than real, in that case, since there ''cos'' is an [[algebraic function]] of ''sin'' (in other words, we usually take their functions both as defined on the [[unit circle]]).\n\nThe scope of the idea of an addition theorem was fully explored in the nineteenth century, prompted by the discovery of the addition theorem for [[elliptic function]]s. To 'classify' addition theorems it is necessary to put some restriction on the type of function ''G'' admitted, such that \n\n:''F''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''G''(''F''(''x''), ''F''(''y'')).\n\nIn this identity one can assume that ''F'' and ''G'' are vector-valued (have several components). An '''algebraic addition theorem''' is one in which ''G'' can be taken to be a vector of [[polynomial]]s, in some set of variables. The conclusion of the mathematicians of the time was that the theory of [[abelian function]]s essentially exhausted the interesting possibilities: considered as a [[functional equation]] to be solved with polynomials, or indeed [[rational function]]s or [[algebraic function]]s, there were no further types of solution. \n\nIn more contemporary language this appears as part of the theory of [[algebraic group]]s, dealing with commutative groups. The connected, [[projective variety]] examples are indeed exhausted by abelian functions, as is shown by a number of results characterising an [[abelian variety]] by rather weak conditions on its group law. The so-called [[quasi-abelian function]]s are all known to come from extensions of abelian varieties by commutative affine group varieties. Therefore the old conclusions about the scope of global algebraic addition theorems can be said to hold. A more modern aspect is the theory of [[formal group]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Timeline of abelian varieties]]\n*[[Spherical harmonics#Addition theorem|Addition theorem for spherical harmonics]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Springer|id=A/a110350|title=Addition theorems in the theory of special functions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Addition Theorem}}\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebra]]"

By linearity it is enough to prove the theorem when each matrix has only one nonzero entry, which is 1. In this case each matrix can be encoded as a directed edge of a graph with ''n'' vertices. So all matrices together give a graph on ''n'' vertices with 2''n'' directed edges. The identity holds provided that for any two vertices ''A'' and ''B'' of the graph, the number of odd Eulerian paths from ''A'' to ''B'' is the same as the number of even ones. (Here a path is called odd or even depending on whether its edges taken in order give an odd or even permutation of the 2''n'' edges.)

That is, for any field ''F'' that is itself finite or that is the closure of a finite field, if a polynomial ''P'' from ''F<sup>n</sup>'' to itself is injective then it is bijective.\n\nIf ''F'' is a finite field, then ''F<sup>n</sup>'' is finite. In this case the theorem is true for trivial reasons having nothing to do with the representation of the function as a polynomial: any injection of a finite set to itself is a bijection. When ''F'' is the algebraic closure of a finite field, the result follows from [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]. The Ax–Grothendieck theorem for complex numbers can therefore be proven by showing that a counterexample over '''C''' would translate into a counterexample in some algebraic extension of a finite field.\n\nThis method of proof is noteworthy in that it is an example of the idea that finitistic algebraic relations in fields of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 translate into algebraic relations over finite fields with large characteristic.<ref name=\"Terence Tao\"/> Thus, one can use the arithmetic of finite fields to prove a statement about '''C''' even though there is no [[homomorphism]] from any finite field to '''C'''. The proof thus uses [[model theory|model-theoretic principles]] to prove an elementary statement about polynomials. The proof for the general case uses a similar method.\n\n==Other proofs==\nThere are other proofs of the theorem. [[Armand Borel]] gave a proof using topology.<ref name=\"Serre\"/> The case of ''n'' = 1 and field '''C''' follows since '''C''' is algebraically closed and can also be thought of as a special case of the result that for any [[analytic function]] ''f'' on '''C''', injectivity of ''f'' implies surjectivity of ''f''. This is a corollary of [[Picard theorem|Picard's theorem]].\n\n==Related results==\nAnother example of reducing theorems about [[morphism of finite type|morphisms of finite type]] to finite fields can be found in [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique|EGA IV]]: There, it is proved that a [[radicial morphism|radicial]] ''S''-endomorphism of a scheme ''X'' of finite type over ''S'' is bijective (10.4.11), and that if ''X''/''S'' is of finite presentation, and the endomorphism is a monomorphism, then it is an automorphism (17.9.6). Therefore, a scheme of finite presentation over a base ''S'' is a cohopfian object in the category of ''S''-schemes.\n\nThe Ax–Grothendieck theorem may also be used to prove the [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden theorem]], a result that like the Ax–Grothendieck theorem relates injectivity with surjectivity but in [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] rather than in algebraic fields. Although direct proofs of this theorem are known, the proof via the Ax–Grothendieck theorem extends more broadly, to automata acting on [[amenable group]]s.<ref>{{citation|title=On algebraic cellular automata|first1=Tullio|last1=Ceccherini-Silberstein|first2=Michel|last2=Coornaert|year=2010|arxiv=1011.4759|bibcode=2010arXiv1011.4759C}}.</ref>\n\nSome partial converses to the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem:\n\n*A generically surjective polynomial map of ''n''-dimensional affine space over a finitely generated extension of '''Z''' or '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''[''t''] is bijective with a polynomial inverse rational over the same ring (and therefore bijective on affine space of the algebraic closure).\n*A generically surjective rational map of ''n''-dimensional affine space over a Hilbertian field is generically bijective with a rational inverse defined over the same field.

(When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term.  Hence one often sees the right side written as <math>\\binom{n}{0} x^n + \\ldots</math>.) This formula is also referred to as the '''binomial formula''' or the '''binomial identity'''. Using [[Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], it can be written as\n:<math>(x+y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}x^{n-k}y^k = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}x^{k}y^{n-k}.\n</math>\nThe final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of ''x'' and ''y'' in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical.\nA simple variant of the binomial formula is obtained by [[substitution (algebra)|substituting]] 1 for ''y'', so that it involves only a single [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. In this form, the formula reads\n:<math>(1+x)^n = {n \\choose 0}x^0 + {n \\choose 1}x^1 + {n \\choose 2}x^2 + \\cdots + {n \\choose {n-1}}x^{n-1} + {n \\choose n}x^n,</math>\nor equivalently\n:<math>(1+x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}x^k.</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe most basic example of the binomial theorem is the formula for the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of {{math|''x'' + ''y''}}:\n\n:<math>(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.</math>\n\nThe binomial coefficients 1, 2, 1 appearing in this expansion correspond to the second row of Pascal's triangle.  (Note that the top \"1\" of the triangle is considered to be row 0, by convention.) The coefficients of higher powers of {{math|''x'' + ''y''}} correspond to lower rows of the triangle:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 & = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^4 & = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^5 & = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^6 & = x^6 + 6x^5y + 15x^4y^2 + 20x^3y^3 + 15x^2y^4 + 6xy^5 + y^6, \\\\[8pt]\n(x+y)^7 & = x^7 + 7x^6y + 21x^5y^2 + 35x^4y^3 + 35x^3y^4 + 21x^2y^5 + 7xy^6 + y^7.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nSeveral patterns can be observed from these examples. In general, for the expansion {{math|(''x'' + ''y'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}:\n# the powers of {{mvar|x}} start at {{mvar|n}} and decrease by 1 in each term until they reach 0 (with {{math|1=''x''<sup>0</sup> = 1}}, often unwritten);\n# the powers of {{mvar|y}} start at 0 and increase by 1 until they reach {{mvar|n}}; \n# the {{mvar|n}}th row of Pascal's Triangle will be the coefficients of the expanded binomial when the terms are arranged in this way;\n# the number of terms in the expansion before like terms are combined is the sum of the coefficients and is equal to {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}}; and\n# there will be {{math|''n'' + 1}} terms in the expression after combining like terms in the expansion.\n\nThe binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial. For example,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(x+2)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2(2) + 3x(2)^2 + 2^3 \\\\\n&= x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8.\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied by using the form {{math|1=(''x'' − ''y'')<sup>''n''</sup> = (''x'' + (−''y''))<sup>''n''</sup>}}. This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:\n:<math>(x-y)^3 = (x+(-y))^3 = x^3 + 3x^2(-y) + 3x(-y)^2 + (-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 -y^3.</math>\n\n=== Geometric explanation ===\n[[File:binomial_theorem_visualisation.svg|thumb|300px|Visualisation of binomial expansion up to the 4th power]]\nFor positive values of ''a'' and ''b'', the binomial theorem with {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} can be cut into a square of side ''a'', a square of side ''b'', and two rectangles with sides ''a'' and ''b''. With {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3}}, the theorem states that a cube of side {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} can be cut into a cube of side ''a'', a cube of side ''b'', three ''a''×''a''×''b'' rectangular boxes, and three ''a''×''b''×''b'' rectangular boxes.\n\nIn [[calculus]], this picture also gives a geometric proof of the [[derivative]] <math>(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}:</math><ref name=\"barth2004\">{{cite journal | last = Barth | first = Nils R.| title = Computing Cavalieri's Quadrature Formula by a Symmetry of the ''n''-Cube | doi = 10.2307/4145193 | jstor = 4145193 | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly| issn = 0002-9890| volume = 111| issue = 9| pages = 811–813 | date=2004 | pmid =  | pmc =| postscript = , [http://nbarth.net/math/papers/barth-01-cavalieri.pdf author's copy], [http://nbarth.net/math/papers/ further remarks and resources]}}</ref> if one sets <math>a=x</math> and <math>b=\\Delta x,</math> interpreting ''b'' as an [[infinitesimal]] change in ''a,'' then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]], <math>(x+\\Delta x)^n,</math> where the coefficient of the linear term (in <math>\\Delta x</math>) is <math>nx^{n-1},</math> the area of the ''n'' faces, each of dimension <math>(n-1):</math>\n:<math>(x+\\Delta x)^n = x^n + nx^{n-1}\\Delta x + \\binom{n}{2}x^{n-2}(\\Delta x)^2 + \\cdots.</math>\nSubstituting this into the [[definition of the derivative]] via a [[difference quotient]] and taking limits means that the higher order terms, <math>(\\Delta x)^2</math> and higher, become negligible, and yields the formula <math>(x^n)'=nx^{n-1},</math> interpreted as\n:\"the infinitesimal rate of change in volume of an ''n''-cube as side length varies is the area of ''n'' of its <math>(n-1)</math>-dimensional faces\".\nIf one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], one obtains [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]], the integral <math>\\textstyle{\\int x^{n-1}\\,dx = \\tfrac{1}{n} x^n}</math> – see [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula#Proof|proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula]] for details.<ref name=\"barth2004\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Binomial coefficients ==\n{{Main|Binomial coefficient}}\nThe coefficients that appear in the binomial expansion are called '''binomial coefficients'''. These are usually written <math> \\tbinom nk </math>, and pronounced “''n'' choose ''k''”.\n\n=== Formulae ===\nThe coefficient of ''x''<sup>''n''−''k''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup> is given by the formula\n\n:<math>{n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}</math>\n\nwhich is defined in terms of the [[factorial]] function ''n''!. Equivalently, this formula can be written\n\n:<math>{n \\choose k} = \\frac{n (n-1) \\cdots (n-k+1)}{k (k-1) \\cdots 1} = \\prod_{\\ell=1}^k \\frac{n-\\ell+1}{\\ell} = \\prod_{\\ell=0}^{k-1} \\frac{n-\\ell}{k - \\ell}</math>\n\nwith ''k'' factors in both the numerator and denominator of the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient <math> \\tbinom nk </math> is actually an [[integer]].\n\n=== Combinatorial interpretation ===\nThe binomial coefficient <math> \\tbinom nk </math> can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose ''k'' elements from an ''n''-element set. This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write {{math|1=(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'')<sup>''n''</sup>}} as a [[Product (mathematics)|product]]\n:<math>(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\\cdots(x+y),</math>\nthen, according to the [[distributive law]], there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either ''x'' or ''y'' from each of the binomials of the product. For example, there will only be one term ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>, corresponding to choosing ''x'' from each binomial. However, there will be several terms of the form ''x''<sup>''n''−2</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup>, one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a ''y''. Therefore, after [[combining like terms]], the coefficient of ''x''<sup>''n''−2</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup> will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an ''n''-element set.\n\n== Proofs ==\n\n=== Combinatorial proof ===\n\n==== Example ====\nThe coefficient of ''xy''<sup>2</sup> in\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^3 &= (x+y)(x+y)(x+y) \\\\\n&= xxx + xxy + xyx + \\underline{xyy} + yxx + \\underline{yxy} + \\underline{yyx} + yyy \\\\\n&= x^3 + 3x^2y + \\underline{3xy^2} + y^3.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nequals <math>\\tbinom{3}{2}=3</math> because there are three ''x'',''y'' strings of length 3 with exactly two ''y'''s, namely,\n\n:<math>xyy, \\; yxy, \\; yyx,</math>\n\ncorresponding to the three 2-element subsets of {&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3&nbsp;}, namely,\n\n:<math>\\{2,3\\},\\;\\{1,3\\},\\;\\{1,2\\}, </math>\n\nwhere each subset specifies the positions of the ''y'' in a corresponding string.\n\n==== General case ====\nExpanding {{math|1=(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'')<sup>''n''</sup>}} yields the sum of the 2<sup>&nbsp;''n''</sup> products of the form {{math|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;''e''<sub>&nbsp;''n''</sub>}} where each ''e''<sub>&nbsp;''i''</sub> is ''x'' or&nbsp;''y''. Rearranging factors shows that each product equals ''x''<sup>''n''−''k''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup> for some ''k'' between 0 and&nbsp;''n''. For a given ''k'', the following are proved equal in succession:\n* the number of copies of {{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''k''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup>}} in the expansion\n* the number of ''n''-character ''x'',''y'' strings having ''y'' in exactly ''k'' positions\n* the number of ''k''-element subsets of {{math|1={{mset|&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''}}}}\n* <math>{n \\choose k}</math> (this is either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining <math>{n \\choose k}</math> as <math>\\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}</math>).\nThis proves the binomial theorem.\n\n=== Inductive proof ===\n[[mathematical induction|Induction]] yields another proof of the binomial theorem.

Now, the right hand side is\n\n:<math> \\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n+1}{k},</math>\n\nby [[Pascal's identity]].<ref>[http://proofs.wiki/Binomial_theorem Binomial theorem] – inductive proofs {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224130932/http://proofs.wiki/Binomial_theorem |date=February 24, 2015 }}</ref> On the other hand, if {{math|1=''j''&nbsp;+''k''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}, then {{math|1=(''j''&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''n''}} and {{math|1=''j''&nbsp;+(''k''&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''n''}}, so we get {{math|1=0&nbsp;+&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}}.

(The same generalization also applies to [[complex number|complex]] exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an [[infinite series]]. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials.  However, for an arbitrary number ''r'', one can define\n\n:<math>{r \\choose k}=\\frac{r(r-1) \\cdots (r-k+1)}{k!} =\\frac{(r)_k}{k!},</math>\n<!--\nThis is not the same as \\frac{r!}{k!(r−k)!}. Factorials are typically only defined on natural number arguments, but even if you are using factorials generalized (e.g. by the \\Gamma function) to non-integer values, they are still undefined on the negative integers. To get the usual binomial theorem as a special case of this so-called generalization, we had better define the binomial coefficient when ''r'' is an integer, but in that case ''r''−''k'' will be a negative integer for sufficiently large ''k'', so one cannot use any formula involving the factorial <math>(r−k)!</math>.\n\nThis negative comment about \"not the same as…\" seems to be needed. People keep coming along and completing this formula with this expression involving factorials, missing the point of this section.\n~~~~perhaps someone could put a better explanation in! Here is an attempt!.\nThe problem with substituting \\frac{r!}{k!(r−k)!} is that the ! ends up being used for negative numbers which doesn't work with the definition of !. Consequently, the notation here is used because if you look at it for a negative value of n, the value is still defined with this notation. That being said, many text books are careless about it.\n-->\nwhere <math>(\\cdot)_k</math> is the [[Pochhammer symbol]], here standing for a [[falling factorial]].  This agrees with the usual definitions when ''r'' is a nonnegative integer.  Then, if ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers with <span class=\"texhtml\">|''x''|&nbsp;>&nbsp;|''y''|</span>,<ref name=convergence group=Note>This is to guarantee convergence. Depending on ''r'', the series may also converge sometimes when <span class=\"texhtml\">|''x''|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|''y''|</span>.</ref> and ''r'' is any complex number, one has\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(x+y)^r & =\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {r \\choose k} x^{r-k} y^k \\\\\n& = x^r + r x^{r-1} y + \\frac{r(r-1)}{2!} x^{r-2} y^2 + \\frac{r(r-1)(r-2)}{3!} x^{r-3} y^3 + \\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nWhen ''r'' is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for {{math|1=''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''r''}} are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most {{math|1=''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}} nonzero terms. For other values of ''r'', the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2}} gives the following series for the square root:\n:<math>\\sqrt{1+x} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x^3 - \\frac{5}{128}x^4 + \\frac{7}{256}x^5 - \\cdots</math>\n\nTaking <math>r=-1</math>, the generalized binomial series gives the [[Geometric series#Formula|geometric series formula]], valid for <math>|x| < 1</math>:\n\n:<math>(1+x)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1+x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + \\cdots</math>\n\nMore generally, with {{math|1=''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;−''s''}}:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{(1-x)^s} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {s+k-1 \\choose k} x^k.</math>\n\nSo, for instance, when <math>s=1/2</math>,\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x}} = 1 -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{8}x^2 - \\frac{5}{16}x^3 + \\frac{35}{128}x^4 - \\frac{63}{256}x^5 + \\cdots</math>\n\n=== Further generalizations ===\nThe generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where ''x'' and ''y'' are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume <span class=\"texhtml\">|''x''|&nbsp;>&nbsp;|''y''|</span><ref name=convergence group=Note /> and define the powers of {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''}} and ''x'' using a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] [[complex logarithm|branch of log]] defined on an open disk of radius |''x''| centered at ''x''.\nThe generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a [[Banach algebra]] as long as {{math|1=''xy''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''yx''}}, ''x''&nbsp;is invertible, and&nbsp;<span class=\"texhtml\">||''y/x''||&nbsp;<&nbsp;1</span>.\n\nA version of the binomial theorem is valid for the following [[Pochhammer symbol]]-like family of polynomials: for a given real constant ''c'', define <math> x^{(0)} = 1 </math> and <math> x^{(n)} = \\prod_{k=1}^{n}[x+(k-1)c]</math> for <math> n > 0</math>.

The coefficients <math> \\tbinom n{k_1,\\cdots,k_m} </math> are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula\n\n:<math> {n \\choose k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m} = \\frac{n!}{k_1! \\cdot k_2! \\cdots k_m!}.</math>\n\nCombinatorially, the multinomial coefficient <math>\\tbinom n{k_1,\\cdots,k_m}</math> counts the number of different ways to [[Partition of a set|partition]] an ''n''-element set into [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[subset]]s of sizes {{math|1=''k''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''k''<sub>''m''</sub>}}.\n\n=== {{anchor|multi-binomial}} Multi-binomial theorem ===\nIt is often useful when working in more dimensions, to deal with products of binomial expressions. By the binomial theorem this is equal to\n\n:<math> (x_{1}+y_{1})^{n_{1}}\\dotsm(x_{d}+y_{d})^{n_{d}} = \\sum_{k_{1}=0}^{n_{1}}\\dotsm\\sum_{k_{d}=0}^{n_{d}} \\binom{n_{1}}{k_{1}}\\, x_{1}^{k_{1}}y_{1}^{n_{1}-k_{1}}\\;\\dotsc\\;\\binom{n_{d}}{k_{d}}\\, x_{d}^{k_{d}}y_{d}^{n_{d}-k_{d}}. </math>\n\nThis may be written more concisely, by [[multi-index notation]], as\n\n:<math> (x+y)^\\alpha = \\sum_{\\nu \\le \\alpha} \\binom{\\alpha}{\\nu} x^\\nu y^{\\alpha - \\nu}.</math>\n\n=== General Leibniz rule ===\n{{Main|General Leibniz rule}}\n\nThe general Leibniz rule gives the {{mvar|n}}th derivative of a product of two functions in a form similar to that of the binomial theorem:<ref>{{cite book |last=Seely |first=Robert T. |title=Calculus of One and Several Variables |location=Glenview |publisher=Scott, Foresman |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-673-07779-0 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>(fg)^{(n)}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f^{(n-k)}(x) g^{(k)}(x).</math>\n\nHere, the superscript {{math|(''n'')}} indicates the {{mvar|n}}th derivative of a function.  If one sets {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''e''{{sup|''ax''}}}} and {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''e''{{sup|''bx''}}}}, and then cancels the common factor of {{math|''e''{{sup|(''a'' + ''b'')''x''}}}} from both sides of the result, the ordinary binomial theorem is recovered.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Multiple-angle identities ===\nFor the [[complex numbers]] the binomial theorem can be combined with [[de Moivre's formula]] to yield [[List of trigonometric identities#Multiple-angle formulae|multiple-angle formulas]] for the [[sine]] and [[cosine]]. According to De Moivre's formula,\n:<math>\\cos\\left(nx\\right)+i\\sin\\left(nx\\right) = \\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^n.</math>\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos(''nx'') and sin(''nx''). For example, since\n:<math>\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^2 = \\cos^2 x + 2i \\cos x \\sin x - \\sin^2 x,</math>\nDe Moivre's formula tells us that\n:<math>\\cos(2x) = \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\sin(2x) = 2 \\cos x \\sin x,</math>\nwhich are the usual double-angle identities. Similarly, since\n:<math>\\left(\\cos x+i\\sin x\\right)^3 = \\cos^3 x + 3i \\cos^2 x \\sin x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x - i \\sin^3 x,</math>\nDe Moivre's formula yields\n:<math>\\cos(3x) = \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x \\sin^2 x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sin(3x) = 3\\cos^2 x \\sin x - \\sin^3 x.</math>\nIn general,\n:<math>\\cos(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ even}} (-1)^{k/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x</math>\nand\n:<math>\\sin(nx) = \\sum_{k\\text{ odd}} (-1)^{(k-1)/2} {n \\choose k}\\cos^{n-k} x \\sin^k x.</math>\n\n=== Series for ''e'' ===\nThe [[e (mathematical constant)|number ''e'']] is often defined by the formula\n\n:<math>e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n.</math>\n\nApplying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual [[infinite series]] for ''e''. In particular:\n\n:<math>\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = 1 + {n \\choose 1}\\frac{1}{n} + {n \\choose 2}\\frac{1}{n^2} + {n \\choose 3}\\frac{1}{n^3} + \\cdots + {n \\choose n}\\frac{1}{n^n}.</math>\n\nThe ''k''th term of this sum is\n\n:<math>{n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}\\cdot\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots (n-k+1)}{n^k}</math>\n\nAs ''n''&nbsp;→&nbsp;∞, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} {n \\choose k}\\frac{1}{n^k} = \\frac{1}{k!}.</math>\n\nThis indicates that ''e'' can be written as a series:\n\n:<math>e=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k!}=\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\cdots.</math>\n\nIndeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an [[Monotonic function|increasing function]] of ''n'', it follows from the [[monotone convergence theorem]] for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to&nbsp;''e''.\n\n=== Probability ===\nThe binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the [[negative binomial distribution]]. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials <math>\\{X_t\\}_{t\\in S}</math> with probability of success <math>p\\in [0,1]</math> all not happening is  <math display=\"block\"> P\\left(\\bigcap_{t\\in S} X_t^C\\right) = (1-p)^{|S|} = \\sum_{n=0}^{|S|} {|S| \\choose n} (-p)^n</math>A useful upper bound for this quantity is <math> e^{-pn}</math>. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Compression|last=Cover|first=Thomas M.|last2=Thomas|first2=Joy A.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780471200611|pages=320|language=en|doi=10.1002/0471200611.ch5}}</ref>\n\n== The binomial theorem in abstract algebra ==\n\nFormula (1) is valid more generally for any elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a [[semiring]] satisfying {{math|1=''xy''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''yx''}}. The [[theorem]] is true even more generally: [[alternativity]] suffices in place of [[associativity]].\n\nThe binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the [[polynomial sequence]]  {{math|1={{mset|&nbsp;1,&nbsp;''x'',&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>,&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>,&nbsp;...&nbsp;}}}} is of [[binomial type]].\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The binomial theorem is mentioned in the [[Major-General's Song]] in the comic opera [[The Pirates of Penzance]].\n* [[Professor Moriarty]] is described by Sherlock Holmes as having written [[A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem|a treatise on the binomial theorem]].\n* The Portuguese poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], using the heteronym [[Álvaro de Campos]], wrote that \"Newton's Binomial is as beautiful as the [[Venus de Milo]].
