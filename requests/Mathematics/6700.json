      "text": "{{Expert needed|date=March 2011}}\nIn [[operations research]], the '''Big M method''' is a method of solving [[linear programming]] problems using the [[simplex algorithm]].  The Big M method extends the simplex algorithm to problems that contain \"greater-than\" constraints. It does so by associating the constraints with large negative constants which would not be part of any optimal solution, if it exists.\n\n==Algorithm==\nThe simplex algorithm is the original and still one of the most widely used methods for solving linear maximization problems.  However, to apply it, the origin (all variables equal to 0) must be a feasible point.  This condition is satisfied only when all the constraints (except non-negativity) are less-than constraints and with a positive constant on the right-hand side.  The Big M method introduces surplus and artificial variables to convert all inequalities into that form.  The \"Big M\" refers to a large number associated with the artificial variables, represented by the letter&nbsp;M.\n\nThe steps in the algorithm are as follows:\n# Multiply the inequality constraints to ensure that the right hand side is positive.\n# If the problem is of minimization, transform to maximization by multiplying the objective by -1\n# For any greater-than constraints, introduce surplus and artificial variables (as shown below)\n# Choose a large positive Value M and introduce a term in the objective of the form -M multiplying the artificial variables\n# For less-than or equal constraints, introduce slack variables so that all constraints are equalities\n# Solve the problem using the usual simplex method.\n\nFor example, ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;≤ &nbsp;100 becomes ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''s''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100, whilst ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;100 becomes ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&minus; s<sub>1</sub> + ''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100. The artificial variables must be shown to be&nbsp;0.  The function to be maximised is rewritten to include the sum of all the artificial variables. Then [[row reductions]] are applied to gain a final solution.\n\nThe value of M must be chosen sufficiently large so that the artificial variable would not be part of any feasible solution.\n\nFor a sufficiently large M, the optimal solution contains any artificial variables in the basis (i.e. positive values) if and only if the problem is not feasible.\n\n==Other usage==\nWhen used in the objective function, the Big M method sometimes refers to formulations of linear optimization problems in which violations of a constraint or set of constraints are associated with a large positive penalty constant, M.\n\nWhen used in the constraints themselves, one of the many uses of Big M, for example, refers to ensuring equality of variables only when a certain binary variable takes on one value, but to leave the variables \"open\" if the binary variable takes on its opposite value. One instance of this is as follows: for a sufficiently large M and z binary variable (0 or 1), the constraints\n\n: <math>x - y \\leq M z</math>\n\n: <math>x - y \\geq -M z</math>\n\nensure that when <math>z = 0</math> then <math>x = y</math>. Otherwise, when <math>z = 1</math>, then <math>-M \\leq x - y \\leq M</math>, indicating that the variables x and y can have any values so long as the absolute value of their difference is bounded by <math>M</math> (hence the need for M to be \"large enough.\")\n\n==See also==\n*[[Two phase method (linear programming)]] another approach for solving problems with >= constraints\n*[[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]], which apply to [[Non-Linear Optimization]] problems with inequality constraints.\n \n==References and external links==\n'''Bibliography'''\n*{{cite book|last1=Griva|first1=Igor|last2=Nash|first2=Stephan G.|last3=Sofer|first3=Ariela|title=Linear and Nonlinear Optimization|isbn=978-0-89871-661-0|publisher=Society for Industrial Mathematics|edition=2nd}}\n'''Discussion'''\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091122222848/http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~lkillen/teach/CA427Simplexbigmexample.pdf Simplex – Big M Method], Lynn Killen, [[Dublin City University]].\n*[http://businessmanagementcourses.org/Lesson09TheBigMMethod.pdf The Big M Method], businessmanagementcourses.org\n*[http://hutchies.iconbar.com/bigm.html The Big M Method], Mark Hutchinson\n\n{{Optimization algorithms}}\n\n[[Category:Linear programming]]\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]"

(2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 ]</ref> It is used to empirically measure [[productive efficiency]] of decision making units (DMUs). Although DEA has a strong link to production theory in economics, the tool is also used for benchmarking in operations management, where a set of measures is selected to benchmark the performance of manufacturing and service operations. In  benchmarking, the efficient DMUs, as defined by DEA, may not necessarily form a “production frontier”, but rather lead to a “best-practice frontier” (Cook, Tone and Zhu, 2014). DEA is referred to as \"balanced benchmarking\" by Sherman and Zhu (2013). \n\nNon-parametric approaches have the benefit of not assuming a particular functional form/shape for the frontier, however they do not provide a general relationship (equation) relating output and input. There are also [[parametric statistics|parametric]] approaches which are used for the estimation of production frontiers (see Lovell & Schmidt 1988 for an early survey). These require that the shape of the frontier be guessed beforehand by specifying a particular function relating output to input.  The relative strengths from each of these approaches can be combined in a hybrid method  (Tofallis, 2001,) where the frontier units are identified by DEA, then fitted to a smooth surface. This allows a best-practice relationship between multiple outputs and multiple inputs to be estimated.\n\n\"The framework has been adapted from multi-input, multi-output production functions and applied in many industries. DEA develops a function whose form is determined by the most efficient producers.  This method differs from the [[Ordinary Least Squares]] (OLS) statistical technique that bases comparisons relative to an average producer.  Like [[Stochastic Frontier Analysis]] (SFA), DEA identifies a \"[[Pareto efficiency#Pareto frontier|frontier]]\" which are characterized as an extreme point method that assumes that if a firm can produce a certain level of output utilizing specific input levels, another firm of equal scale should be capable of doing the same. The most efficient producers can form a 'composite producer', allowing the computation of an efficient solution for every level of input or output. Where there is no actual corresponding firm, 'virtual producers' are identified to make comparisons\" (Berg 2010).\n\nAttempts to synthesize DEA and SFA, improving upon their drawbacks, were also made in the literature, via proposing various versions of non-parametric SFA <ref name=simar2015>{{cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jproda/v43y2015i2p199-214.html |author=Park, B., L.

Also see many references therein.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn [[microeconomic]] production theory, a firm's input and output combinations are depicted using a production function. Using such a function, one can show the maximum output which can be achieved with any possible combination of inputs, that is, one can construct a production technology frontier (Sieford & Thrall 1990).<ref name=SeifordThrall>{{cite journal |author1=L.M. Seiford |author2=R.M. Thrall |year=1990 |title=Recent Developments in DEA: The Mathematical Programming Approach to Frontier Analysis |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=46 |issue=1–2 |pages=7–38 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(90)90045-u}}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the ideas of Farrell (1957), the seminal work \"Measuring the efficiency of decision making units\" by [[Abraham Charnes|Charnes]], [[William W. Cooper|Cooper]] & [[Edwardo Rhodes|Rhodes]] (1978) applies linear programming to estimate an empirical production technology frontier for the first time. In Germany, the procedure was used earlier to estimate the marginal productivity of R&D and other factors of production (Brockhoff 1970). Since then, there have been a large number of books and journal articles written on DEA or applying DEA on various sets of problems. \n\nOther than comparing efficiency across DMUs within an organization, DEA has also been used to compare efficiency across firms. There are several types of DEA with the most basic being CCR based on Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes, however there are also DEA which address varying returns to scale, either CRS (constant returns to scale, VRS (variable), non increasing returns to scale or the non decreasing returns to scale by Ylvinger (2000). The main developments of DEA in the 1970s and 1980s are documented by Seiford & Thrall (1990).\n==Techniques==\n{{cleanup|section|date=July 2009}}\nData envelopment analysis (DEA) is a [[linear programming]] methodology to measure the [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] of multiple decision-making units (DMUs) when the production process presents a structure of multiple inputs and outputs.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Yishi Zhang|author2=Anrong Yang|author3=Chan Xiong|author4=Teng Wang|author5=Zigang Zhang|title=Feature selection using data envelopment analysis|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|date=2014|volume=64|pages=70–80|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2014.03.022}}</ref>\n\n\"DEA has been used for both production and cost data. Utilizing the selected variables, such as unit cost and output, DEA software searches for the points with the lowest unit cost for any given output, connecting those points to form the efficiency frontier. Any company not on the frontier is considered inefficient. A numerical coefficient is given to each firm, defining its relative efficiency. Different variables that could be used to establish the efficiency frontier are: number of employees, service quality, environmental safety, and fuel consumption. An early survey of studies of electricity distribution companies identified more than thirty DEA analyses—indicating widespread application of this technique to that network industry. (Jamasb, T. J., Pollitt, M. G. 2001). A number of studies using this technique have been published for water utilities.  The main advantage to this method is its ability to accommodate a multiplicity of inputs and outputs. It is also useful because it takes into consideration returns to scale in calculating efficiency, allowing for the concept of increasing or decreasing efficiency based on size and output levels. A drawback of this technique is that model specification and inclusion/exclusion of variables can affect the results.\" (Berg 2010)\n\nUnder general DEA benchmarking, for example, \"if one benchmarks the performance of computers, it is natural to consider different features (screen size and resolution, memory size, process speed, hard disk size, and others). One would then have to classify these features into “inputs” and “outputs” in order to apply a proper DEA analysis. However, these features may not actually represent inputs and outputs at all, in the standard notion of production. In fact, if one examines the benchmarking literature, other terms, such as “indicators”, “outcomes”, and “metrics”, are used. The issue now becomes one of how to classify these performance measures into inputs and outputs, for use in DEA.\" (Cook, Tone, and Zhu, 2014)\n\nSome of the advantages of DEA are:\n* no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function\n* proven to be useful in uncovering relationships that remain hidden for other methodologies\n* capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs\n* capable of being used with any input-output measurement\n* the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit\n\nSome of the disadvantages of DEA are:\n* results are sensitive to the selection of inputs and outputs (Berg 2010).\n* you cannot test for the best specification (Berg 2010). \n* the number of efficient firms on the frontier tends to increase with the number of inputs and output variables (Berg 2010).\n\nA desire to Improve upon DEA, by reducing its disadvantages or strengthening its advantages has been a major cause for many discoveries in the recent literature. The currently most often DEA-based method to obtain unique efficiency rankings is called [[cross-efficiency]]. Originally developed by Sexton et al. in 1986<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sexton|first=Thomas R.|date=1986|title=Data envelopment analysis: Critique and extension|url=|journal=New Directions for Program Evaluation|volume=32|pages=73–105|via=}}</ref>, it found widespread application ever since Doyle and Green's 1994 publication<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=John|last2=Green|first2=Rodney|date=1994-05-01|title=Efficiency and Cross-efficiency in DEA: Derivations, Meanings and Uses|journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society|language=en|volume=45|issue=5|pages=567–578|doi=10.1057/jors.1994.84|issn=0160-5682}}</ref>.  Cross-efficiency is based on the original DEA results, but implents a secondary objective where each DMU peer-appraises all other DMU's with its own factor weights. The average of these peer-appraisal scores is then used to calculate a DMU's cross-efficiency score. This approach avoids DEA's disadvantages of having multiple efficient DMUs and potentially non-unique weights<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dyson|first=R. G.|last2=Allen|first2=R.|last3=Camanho|first3=A.

Another approach to remedy some of DEA's drawbacks is Stochastic DEA, which synthesizes DEA and SFA.<ref name=simar2011/>\n\n==Sample applications==\n\nDEA is commonly applied in the electric utilities sector. For instance, a government authority can choose data envelopment analysis as their measuring tool to design an individualized regulatory rate for each firm based on their comparative efficiency. The input components would include man-hours, losses, capital (lines and transformers only), and goods and services. The output variables would include number of customers, energy delivered, length of lines, and degree of coastal exposure. (Berg 2010)\n\nDEA is also regularly used to assess the efficiency of public and not-for-profit organizations, e.g. hospitals (Kuntz, Scholtes & Vera 2007; Kuntz & Vera 2007; Vera & Kuntz 2007), police forces (Thanassoulis 1995; Sun 2002; Aristovnik et al. 2013, 2014), or liberal arts colleges (Eckles, 2010).\n\n===Examples===\nIn the DEA methodology, formally developed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (1978), efficiency is defined as a ratio of weighted sum of outputs to a weighted sum of inputs, where the weights structure is calculated by means of mathematical programming and  [[constant returns to scale]] (CRS) are assumed. In 1984, Banker, Charnes and Cooper developed a model with variable returns to scale (VRS).\n\nAssume that we have the following data:\n\n* Unit 1 produces 100 items per day, and the inputs per item are 10 dollars for materials and 2 labour-hours\n* Unit 2 produces 80 items per day, and the inputs are 8 dollars for materials and 4 labour-hours\n* Unit 3 produces 120 items per day, and the inputs are 12 dollars for materials and 1.5 labour-hours\n\nTo calculate the efficiency of unit 1, we define the objective function (OF) as\n\n*<math>Max Efficiency :(100u_1)/(10v_1+2v_2)</math>\n\nwhich is subject to (ST) all efficiency of other units (efficiency cannot be larger than 1):\n\n*Efficiency of unit 1: <math>(100u_1)/(10v_1+2v_2)\\leq 1</math>     \n*Efficiency of unit 2: <math display=\"inline\">(80u_1)/(8v_1+4v_2)\\leq 1</math>        \n*Efficiency of unit 3: <math>(120u_1)/(12v_1+1.5v_2)\\leq 1</math>\n\nand non-negativity:\n\n*<math>u,v \\geq 0</math>\n\nA fraction with decision variables in the numerator and denominator is nonlinear. Since we are using a linear programming technique, we need to linearize the formulation, such that the denominator of the objective function is constant (in this case 1), then maximize the numerator.\n\nThe new formulation would be:\n\n* OF\n**<math>Max Efficiency :100u_1</math>\n*ST\n** Efficiency of unit 1: <math>100u_1-(10v_1+2v_2)\\leq 0</math>\n** Efficiency of unit 2: <math display=\"inline\">80u_1-(8v_1+4v_2)\\leq 0</math>\n** Efficiency of unit 3: <math>120u_1-(12v_1+1.5v_2)\\leq 0</math>\n**Denominator of nonlinear OF'':''   <math>10v_1+2v_2=1</math>\n** Non-negativity: <math>u,v \\geq 0</math>\n\n==Inefficiency measuring==\nData Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been recognized as a valuable analytical research instrument and a practical decision support tool. DEA has been credited for not requiring a complete specification for the functional form of the production frontier nor the distribution of inefficient deviations from the frontier. Rather, DEA requires general production and distribution assumptions only. However, if those assumptions are too weak, inefficiency levels may be systematically underestimated in small samples. In addition, erroneous assumptions may cause inconsistency with a bias over the frontier. Therefore, the ability to alter, test and select production assumptions is essential in conducting DEA-based research. However, the DEA models currently available offer a limited variety of alternative production assumptions only.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | author = Banker R.D. | authorlink3 = William W.

This is slightly different than the above definition, which permits a change of inner product.  For instance, the above definition makes a cone in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> with ellipsoidal base self-dual, because the inner product can be changed to make the base spherical, and a cone with spherical base in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is equal to its internal dual.\n\nThe nonnegative [[orthant]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and the space of all [[positive semidefinite matrix|positive semidefinite matrices]] are self-dual, as are the cones with ellipsoidal base (often called \"spherical cones\", \"Lorentz cones\", or sometimes \"ice-cream cones\").  So are all cones in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> whose base is the convex hull of a regular polygon with an odd number of vertices.  A less regular example is the cone in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> whose base is the \"house\": the convex hull of a square and a point outside the square forming an equilateral triangle (of the appropriate height) with one of the sides of the square.\n\n==Polar cone==\n[[File:Polar cone illustration.svg|right|thumb|The polar of the closed convex cone ''C'' is the closed convex cone ''C<sup>o</sup>'', and vice versa.]]\nFor a set ''C'' in ''X'', the '''polar cone''' of ''C'' is the set<ref name=\"Rockafellar\">{{cite book|author=[[Rockafellar, R.

      "text": "The '''dual''' of a given [[linear program]] (LP) is another LP that is derived from the original (the '''primal''') LP in the following schematic way:\n\n* Each variable in the primal LP becomes a constraint in the dual LP;\n* Each constraint in the primal LP becomes a variable in the dual LP;\n* The objective direction is inversed – maximum in the primal becomes minimum in the dual and vice-versa.\n\nThe [[weak duality]] theorem states that the objective value of the dual LP at any feasible solution is always a bound on the objective of the primal LP at any feasible solution (upper or lower bound, depending of whether it is a maximization or minimization problem).  In fact, this bounding property holds for the optimal values of the dual and primal LPs.\n\nThe [[strong duality]] theorem states that, moreover, if the primal has an optimal solution then the dual has an optimal solution too, ''and the two optima are equal''.<ref name=\"gm06\">{{Cite Gartner Matousek 2006}} Pages 81–104.</ref>\n\nThese theorems belong to a larger class of [[Duality (optimization)|duality theorems in optimization]]. The strong duality theorem is one of the cases in which the [[duality gap]] (the gap between the optimum of the primal and the optimum of the dual) is 0.\n\n== Constructing the dual LP ==\nGiven a primal LP, the following algorithm can be used to construct its dual LP.<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|85}} The primal LP is defined by:\n\n* A set of ''n'' variables:       <math>x_1 ,\\ldots, x_n</math>. \n* For each variable ''i'', a ''sign constraint'' – it should be either non-negative (<math>x_i \\geq 0</math>), or non-positive  (<math>x_i \\leq 0</math>), or unconstrained  (<math>x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>).\n* An objective function:    <math>\\text{maximize} ~~~ c_1 x_1 +\\cdots + c_n x_n</math>\n* A list of ''m'' constraints. Each constraint ''j'' is:   <math>a_{j 1} x_1 +\\cdots + a_{j n} x_n \\lesseqqgtr b_j</math>where the symbol before the <math>b_j</math> can be either <math>\\geq</math> or <math>\\leq</math> or <math>=</math>. \n\nThe dual LP is constructed as follows.\n\n* Each primal constraint becomes a dual variable. So there are ''m'' variables: <math>y_1 ,\\ldots, y_m</math>.\n*The sign constraint of each dual variable is \"opposite\" to the sign of its primal constraint. So  \"<math>\\geq b_j </math>\" becomes  <math>y_j \\leq 0 </math> and  \"<math>\\leq b_j </math>\" becomes  <math>y_j \\geq 0 </math>  and \"<math>= b_j </math>\" becomes <math>y_j \\in \\mathbb{R} </math>.\n* The dual objective function is    <math>\\text{minimize } ~~~ b_1 y_1 +\\cdots + b_m y_m</math>\n* Each primal variable becomes a dual constraint. So there are ''n'' constraints.  The coefficient of a dual variable in the dual constraint is the coefficient of its primal variable in its primal constraint.  So each constraint ''i'' is: <math>a_{1 i} y_1 +\\cdots + a_{m i} y_m \\lesseqqgtr c_i</math>, where the symbol before the <math>c_i</math> is similar to the constraint on variable ''i'' in the primal LP. So <math>x_i \\leq 0 </math> becomes \"<math>\\leq c_i </math>\" and <math>x_i \\geq 0 </math>becomes \"<math>\\geq c_i </math>\"  and <math>x_i \\in \\mathbb{R} </math> becomes \"<math>= c_i </math>\" .\n\nFrom this algorithm, it is easy to see that the dual of the dual is the primal.\n\n== Vector formulations ==\nIf all constraints have the same sign, it is possible to present the above recipe in a shorter way using matrices and vectors. The following table shows the relation between various kinds of primals and duals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Primal\n!Dual\n!Note\n|-\n|Maximize '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x'''  subject to ''A'''''x''' ≤ '''b''', '''x''' ≥ 0\n|Minimize  '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''  subject to ''A''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' ≥ '''c''', '''y''' ≥ 0\n|This is called a \"symmetric\" dual problem\n|-\n|Maximize '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x''' subject to ''A'''''x''' ≤ '''b'''\n|Minimize  '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' subject to ''A''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' = '''c''', '''y''' ≥ 0\n|This is called an \"asymmetric\" dual problem\n|-\n|Maximize '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x'''  subject to ''A'''''x''' = '''b''', '''x''' ≥ 0\n|Minimize  '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''  subject to ''A''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' ≥ '''c'''\n|\n|}\n\n== The duality theorems ==\nBelow, suppose the primal LP is \"maximize '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x''' subject to [constraints]\" and the dual LP is \"minimize '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' subject to [constraints]\". \n\n=== Weak duality ===\n\n\nThe '''weak duality theorem''' says that, for each feasible solution '''x''' of the primal and each feasible solution '''y''' of the dual:  '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x''' ≤ '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''. In other words, the objective value in each feasible solution of the dual is an upper-bound on the objective value of the primal, and objective value in each feasible solution of the primal is a lower-bound on the objective value of the dual. This implies:<blockquote>max<sub>'''x'''</sub> '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x'''   ≤  min'''<sub>y</sub>''' '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''</blockquote>In particular, if the primal is unbounded (from above) then the dual has no feasible solution, and if the dual is unbounded (from below) then the primal has no feasible solution.\n\nThe weak duality theorem is relatively simple to prove. Suppose the primal LP is \"Maximize '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x'''  subject to ''A'''''x''' ≤ '''b''', '''x''' ≥ 0\". Suppose we create a linear combination of the constraints, with positive coefficients, such that the coefficients of '''x''' in the constraints are at least '''c'''<sup>T</sup>. This linear combination gives us an upper bound on the objective. The variables '''y''' of the dual LP are the coefficients of this linear combination. The dual LP tries to find such coefficients that minimize the resulting upper bound. This gives the LP \"Minimize  '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''  subject to ''A''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' ≥ '''c''', '''y''' ≥ 0\".<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|81-83}}   See the tiny example below.\n\n=== Strong duality ===\n\n\nThe '''strong duality theorem''' says that the bounds given by the weak duality theorem are tight, i.e.:<blockquote>max<sub>'''x'''</sub> '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x'''  =  min'''<sub>y</sub>''' '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''</blockquote>The strong duality theorem is harder to prove; the proofs usually use the weak duality theorem as a sub-routine.\n\nOne proof uses the [[simplex algorithm]] and relies on the proof that, with the suitable pivot rule, it provides a correct solution. The proof establishes that, once the simplex algorithm finishes with a solution to the primal LP, it is possible to read from the final tableau, a solution to the dual LP.  So, by running the simplex algorithm, we obtain solutions to both the primal and the dual simultaneously.<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|87-89}}\n\nAnother proof uses the [[Farkas lemma]].<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|94}}\n\n<br />\n\n=== Theoretic application ===\nThe weak duality has an interesting theoretic application: it shows that finding a ''single'' feasible solution is as hard as finding an ''optimal'' feasible solution. Suppose we have an oracle that, given an LP, finds an arbitrary feasible solution (if one exists). Given the LP \"Maximize '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x'''  subject to ''A'''''x''' ≤ '''b''', '''x''' ≥ 0\", we can construct another LP by combining this LP with its dual. The combined LP has both '''x''' and '''y''' as variables:<blockquote>Maximize '''1''' </blockquote><blockquote>subject to ''A'''''x''' ≤ '''b''',    ''A''<sup>T</sup>'''y''' ≥ '''c''',    '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x''' ≥ '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y''',    '''x''' ≥ 0,   '''y''' ≥ 0</blockquote>If the combined LP has a feasible solution ('''x''','''y'''), then by weak duality, '''c'''<sup>T</sup>'''x''' = '''b'''<sup>T</sup>'''y'''. So '''x''' must be a maximal solution of the primal LP and '''y''' must be a minimal solution of the dual LP. If the combined LP has no feasible solution, then the primal LP has no feasible solution too.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Tiny example ===\n\nConsider the primal LP, with two variables and one constraint:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{maximize } & 3 x_1 + 4 x_2 \n\\\\\n\\text{subject to } & 5 x_1 + 6 x_2 = 7\n\\\\\n&  x_1\\geq 0, x_2\\geq 0\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nApplying the recipe above gives the following dual LP, with one variable and two constraints:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{minimize } & 7 y_1\n\\\\\n\\text{subject to } \n &  5 y_1 \\geq 3\n\\\\\n &  6 y_1 \\geq 4\n\\\\\n &  y_1\\in \\mathbb{R}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIt is easy to see that the maximum of the primal LP is attained when ''x''<sub>1</sub> is minimized to its lower bound (0) and ''x''<sub>2</sub> is maximized to is upper bound under the constraint (7/6). The maximum is 4&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;7/6&nbsp;=&nbsp;14/3.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum of the dual LP is attained when ''y''<sub>1</sub> is minimized to its lower bound under the constraints: the first constraint gives a lower bound of 3/5 while the second constraint gives a stricter lower bound of 4/6, so the actual lower bound is 4/6 and the minimum is 7&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;4/6 = 14/3.\n\nIn accordance with the strong duality theorem, the maximum of the primal equals the minimum of the dual.\n\nWe use this example to illustrate the proof of the weak duality theorem. Suppose that, in the primal LP, we want to get an upper bound on the objective <math>3 x_1 + 4 x_2</math>.  We can use the constraint multiplied by some coefficient, say <math>y_1</math>. For any <math>y_1</math> we get:   <math>y_1\\cdot (5 x_1 + 6 x_2) = 7 y_1</math>.  Now, if  <math>y_1\\cdot 5 x_1 \\geq 3 x_1</math>and <math>y_1\\cdot 6 x_2 \\geq 4 x_2</math>, then <math>y_1\\cdot (5 x_1 + 6 x_2) \\geq 3 x_1 + 4 x_2</math>, so <math>7 y_1 \\geq 3 x_1 + 4 x_2</math>. Hence, the objective of the dual LP is an upper bound on the objective of the primal LP.\n\n=== Farmer example ===\nConsider a farmer who may grow wheat and barley with the set provision of some ''L'' land, ''F'' fertilizer and ''P'' pesticide.\nTo grow one unit of wheat one unit of land, <math>F_1</math> units of fertilizer and <math>P_1</math> units of pesticide must be used.\n\nThe primal problem would be the farmer deciding how much wheat (<math>x_1</math>) and barley (<math>x_2</math>) to grow if their sell prices are <math>S_1</math> and <math>S_2</math> per unit.\n\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Maximize: <math>S_1 \\cdot x_1 + S_2 \\cdot x_2</math>\n| (maximize the revenue from producing wheat and barley)\n|-\n| subject to:\n|<math>x_1 + x_2 \\leq L</math>\n| (cannot use more land than available)\n|-\n|\n|<math>F_1 \\cdot x_1 + F_2 \\cdot x_2 \\leq F</math>\n| (cannot use more fertilizer than available)\n|-\n|\n|<math>P_1 \\cdot x_1 + P_2 \\cdot x_2 \\leq P</math>\n| (cannot use more pesticide than available)\n|-\n|\n|<math>x_1, x_2 \\geq 0</math>\n| (cannot grow negative amounts).\n|}\n\nFor the dual problem assume that ''y'' unit prices for each of these means of production (inputs) are set by a planning board. The planning board's job is to minimize the total cost of procuring the set amounts of inputs while providing the farmer with a floor on the unit price of each of his crops (outputs), ''S''<sub>1</sub> for wheat and ''S''<sub>2</sub> for barley. This corresponds to the following LP:\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Minimize: <math>L\\cdot y_L + F\\cdot y_F + P\\cdot y_P</math>\n| (minimize the total cost of the means of production as the \"objective function\")\n|-\n| subject to:\n|<math>y_L+F_1\\cdot y_F+P_1\\cdot y_P\\geq S_1</math>\n| (the farmer must receive no less than ''S''<sub>1</sub> for his wheat)\n|-\n|\n|<math>y_L+F_2\\cdot y_F+P_2\\cdot y_P\\geq S_2</math>\n| (the farmer must receive no less than ''S''<sub>2</sub> for his barley)\n|-\n|\n|<math>y_L, y_F, y_P\\geq 0</math>\n| (prices cannot be negative).\n|}\n\nIn matrix form this becomes:\n\n: Minimize: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} L & F & P \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} y_L \\\\ y_F \\\\ y_P \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n: subject to: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & F_1 & P_1 \\\\ 1 & F_2 & P_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} y_L \\\\ y_F \\\\ y_P \\end{bmatrix} \\ge \\begin{bmatrix} S_1 \\\\ S_2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\, \\begin{bmatrix} y_L \\\\ y_F \\\\ y_P \\end{bmatrix} \\ge 0. </math>\n\nThe primal problem deals with physical quantities. With all inputs available in limited quantities, and assuming the unit prices of all outputs is known, what quantities of outputs to produce so as to maximize total revenue? The dual problem deals with economic values. With floor guarantees on all output unit prices, and assuming the available quantity of all inputs is known, what input unit pricing scheme to set so as to minimize total expenditure?\n\nTo each variable in the primal space corresponds an inequality to satisfy in the dual space, both indexed by output type. To each inequality to satisfy in the primal space corresponds a variable in the dual space, both indexed by input type.\n\nThe coefficients that bound the inequalities in the primal space are used to compute the objective in the dual space, input quantities in this example. The coefficients used to compute the objective in the primal space bound the inequalities in the dual space, output unit prices in this example.\n\nBoth the primal and the dual problems make use of the same matrix. In the primal space, this matrix expresses the consumption of physical quantities of inputs necessary to produce set quantities of outputs. In the dual space, it expresses the creation of the economic values associated with the outputs from set input unit prices.\n\nSince each inequality can be replaced by an equality and a slack variable, this means each primal variable corresponds to a dual slack variable, and each dual variable corresponds to a primal slack variable.  This relation allows us to speak about complementary slackness.\n\n=== Infeasible program ===\nA LP can also be unbounded or infeasible. Duality theory tells us that: \n\n* If the primal is unbounded then the dual is infeasible; \n* If the dual is unbounded, then the primal must be infeasible. \n\nHowever, it is possible for both the dual and the primal to be infeasible. Here is an example:\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Maximize: <math>2x_1 -x_2</math>\n|-\n| Subject to:\n|<math>x_1 -x_2 \\le 1</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>-x_1 +x_2 \\le -2</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>x_1, x_2 \\geq 0.</math>\n|}\n\n== Applications ==\nThe max-flow min-cut theorem is a special case of the strong duality theorem: flow-maximization is the primal LP, and cut-minimization is the dual LP. See [[Max-flow min-cut theorem#Linear program formulation]].\n\nOther graph-related theorems can be proved using the strong duality theorem, in particular, [[Konig's theorem (graph theory)|Konig's theorem]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~amirali/Public/Teaching/ORF523/S16/ORF523_S16_Lec6_gh.pdf|title=Lecture 6: linear programming and matching|last=A.

Ahmadi|first=|date=2016|website=Princeton University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Minimax theorem]] for zero-sum games can be proved using the strong-duality theorem.<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|sub.8.1}}\n\n== Alternative algorithm ==\nSometimes, one may find it more intuitive to obtain the dual program without looking at the program matrix. Consider the following linear program:\n{| cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n| Minimize\n| colspan=\"2\" |<math> \\sum_{i=1}^m c_i x_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n d_j t_j </math>\n|-\n| subject to\n|<math> \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij} x_i + e_j t_j \\ge g_j</math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le j \\le n </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> f_i x_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij} t_j \\ge h_i</math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le i \\le m </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_i \\ge 0,\\, t_j \\ge 0 </math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le i \\le m, 1 \\le j \\le n </math>\n|}\n\nWe have ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' conditions and all variables are non-negative. We shall define ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' dual variables: '''y'''<sub>j</sub> and '''s'''<sub>''i''</sub>. We get:\n{| cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n| Minimize\n| colspan=\"2\" |<math> \\sum_{i=1}^m c_i x_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n d_j t_j </math>\n|-\n| subject to\n|<math> \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij} x_i  \\cdot y_j + e_j t_j \\cdot y_j \\ge g_j \\cdot y_j </math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le j \\le n </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> f_i x_i \\cdot s_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij} t_j \\cdot s_i \\ge h_i \\cdot s_i</math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le i \\le m </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> x_i \\ge 0,\\, t_j \\ge 0 </math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le i \\le m, 1 \\le j \\le n </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> y_j \\ge 0,\\, s_i \\ge 0 </math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le j \\le n, 1 \\le i \\le m </math>\n|}\n\nSince this is a minimization problem, we would like to obtain a dual program that is a lower bound of the primal. In other words, we would like the sum of all right hand side of the constraints to be the maximal under the condition that for each primal variable the sum of its [[coefficient]]s do not exceed its coefficient in the linear function. For example, '''x'''<sub>1</sub> appears in ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 constraints. If we sum its constraints' coefficients we get ''a''<sub>1,1</sub>'''y'''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>1,2</sub>'''y'''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>1,;;n;;</sub>'''y'''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''f''<sub>1</sub>'''s'''<sub>1</sub>. This sum must be at most '''c'''<sub>1</sub>. As a result, we get:\n\n{| cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n| Maximize\n| colspan=\"2\" |<math> \\sum_{j=1}^n g_j y_j + \\sum_{i=1}^m h_i s_i </math>\n|-\n| subject to\n|<math> \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} y_j + f_i s_i \\le c_i</math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le i \\le m </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> e_j y_j + \\sum_{i=1}^m b_{ij} s_i \\le d_j</math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le j \\le n </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> y_j \\ge 0,\\, s_i \\ge 0 </math>\n|,\n|<math> 1 \\le j \\le n, 1 \\le i \\le m </math>\n|}\n\nNote that we assume in our calculations steps that the program is in standard form. However, any linear program may be transformed to standard form and it is therefore not a limiting factor.\n\n== Real-life interpretations ==\nThe duality theorem has an economic interpretation. If we interpret the primal LP as a classical \"resource allocation\" problem, its dual LP can be interpreted as a \"[[Shadow price|resource valuation]]\" problem. See also [[Shadow price]].\n\nThe duality theorem has a physical interpretation too.<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|86-87}} \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:linear programming]]"

The Lagrangian dual problem is obtained by forming the [[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrangian]] of a minimization problem by using nonnegative [[Lagrange multiplier]]s to add the constraints to the objective function, and then solving for the primal variable values that minimize the original objective function.  This solution gives the primal variables as functions of the Lagrange multipliers, which are called dual variables, so that the new problem is to maximize the objective function with respect to the dual variables under the derived constraints on the dual variables (including at least the nonnegativity constraints).\n\nIn general given two [[dual pair]]s of [[separated space|separated]] [[locally convex space]]s <math>\\left(X,X^*\\right)</math> and <math>\\left(Y,Y^*\\right)</math> and the function <math>f: X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}</math>, we can define the primal problem as finding <math>\\hat{x}</math> such that <math>f(\\hat{x}) = \\inf_{x \\in X} f(x). \\,</math>\nIn other words, if <math>\\hat{x}</math> exists, <math>f(\\hat{x})</math> is the [[minimum]] of the function <math>f</math> and the [[infimum]] (greatest lower bound) of the function is attained.\n\nIf there are constraint conditions, these can be built into the function <math>f</math> by letting <math>\\tilde{f} = f + I_{\\mathrm{constraints}}</math> where <math>I_{\\mathrm{constraints}}</math> is a suitable function on <math>X</math> that has a minimum 0 on the constraints, and for which one can prove that <math>\\inf_{x \\in X} \\tilde{f}(x) = \\inf_{x \\ \\mathrm{constrained}} f(x)</math>.

In the primal problem, the objective function is a linear combination of ''n'' variables. There are ''m'' constraints, each of which places an upper bound on a linear combination of the ''n'' variables. The goal is to maximize the value of the objective function subject to the constraints. A ''solution'' is a [[List (computing)|vector]] (a list) of ''n'' values that achieves the maximum value for the objective function.\n\nIn the dual problem, the objective function is a linear combination of the ''m'' values that are the limits in the ''m'' constraints from the primal problem. There are ''n'' dual constraints, each of which places a lower bound on a linear combination of ''m'' dual variables.\n\n=== Relationship between the primal problem and the dual problem ===\nIn the linear case, in the primal problem, from each sub-optimal point that satisfies all the constraints, there is a direction or [[linear subspace|subspace]] of directions to move that increases the objective function. Moving in any such direction is said to remove slack between the [[candidate solution]] and one or more constraints. An ''infeasible'' value of the candidate solution is one that exceeds one or more of the constraints.\n\nIn the dual problem, the dual vector multiplies the constraints that determine the positions of the constraints in the primal. Varying the dual vector in the dual problem is equivalent to revising the upper bounds in the primal problem. The lowest upper bound is sought. That is, the dual vector is minimized in order to remove slack between the candidate positions of the constraints and the actual optimum. An infeasible value of the dual vector is one that is too low. It sets the candidate positions of one or more of the constraints in a position that excludes the actual optimum.\n\nThis intuition is made formal by the equations in [[Linear programming#Duality|Linear programming: Duality]].\n\n== Nonlinear case ==\nIn [[nonlinear programming]], the constraints are not necessarily linear. Nonetheless, many of the same principles apply.\n\nTo ensure that the global maximum of a non-linear problem can be identified easily, the problem formulation often requires that the functions be convex and have compact lower level sets. \n\nThis is the significance of the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]]. They provide necessary conditions for identifying local optima of non-linear programming problems. There are additional conditions (constraint qualifications) that are necessary so that it will be possible to define the direction to an ''optimal'' solution. An optimal solution is one that is a local optimum, but possibly not a global optimum.\n\n===The strong Lagrangian principle: Lagrange duality {{anchor|Lagrange duality}}===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Lagrange duality]] -->\nGiven a [[nonlinear programming]] problem in standard form\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{minimize }    &f_0(x) \\\\\n\\text{subject to } &f_i(x) \\leq 0,\\ i \\in \\left \\{1,\\dots,m \\right \\} \\\\\n                    &h_i(x) = 0,\\ i \\in \\left \\{1,\\dots,p \\right \\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwith the domain <math>\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n</math> having non-empty interior, the ''Lagrangian function'' <math>\\Lambda: \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\mathbb{R}^p \\to \\mathbb{R} </math> is defined as\n\n: <math>\\Lambda(x,\\lambda,\\nu) = f_0(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i f_i(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\nu_i h_i(x).</math>\n\nThe vectors <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\nu</math> are called the ''dual variables'' or ''Lagrange multiplier vectors'' associated with the problem.  The ''Lagrange dual function'' <math>g:\\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\mathbb{R}^p \\to \\mathbb{R} </math> is defined as\n\n: <math>g(\\lambda,\\nu) = \\inf_{x\\in\\mathcal{D}} \\Lambda(x,\\lambda,\\nu) = \\inf_{x\\in\\mathcal{D}} \\left ( f_0(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i f_i(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\nu_i h_i(x) \\right ).</math>\n\nThe dual function ''g'' is concave, even when the initial problem is not convex, because it is a point-wise infimum of affine functions.  The dual function yields lower bounds on the optimal value <math>p^*</math> of the initial problem; for any <math>\\lambda \\geq 0 </math> and any <math>\\nu</math> we have <math>g(\\lambda,\\nu) \\leq p^* </math>. \n\nIf a [[constraint qualification]] such as [[Slater's condition]] holds and the original problem is convex, then we have [[strong duality]], i.e. <math>d^* = \\max_{\\lambda \\ge 0, \\nu} g(\\lambda,\\nu) = \\inf f_0 = p^*</math>.\n\n=== Convex problems ===\nFor a convex minimization problem with inequality constraints,\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n&\\underset{x}{\\operatorname{minimize}}& & f(x) \\\\\n&\\operatorname{subject\\;to}\n& &g_i(x) \\leq 0, \\quad i = 1,\\dots,m\n\\end{align}</math>\nthe Lagrangian dual problem is\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n&\\underset{u}{\\operatorname{maximize}}& & \\inf_x \\left(f(x) + \\sum_{j=1}^m u_j g_j(x)\\right) \\\\\n&\\operatorname{subject\\;to}\n& &u_i \\geq 0, \\quad i = 1,\\dots,m\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere the objective function is the Lagrange dual function. Provided that the functions <math>f</math> and <math>g_1, \\cdots, g_m</math> are continuously differentiable, the infimum occurs where the gradient is equal to zero. The problem  \n: <math>\\begin{align}\n&\\underset{x, u}{\\operatorname{maximize}}& & f(x) + \\sum_{j=1}^m u_j g_j(x) \\\\\n&\\operatorname{subject\\;to}\n& & \\nabla f(x) + \\sum_{j=1}^m u_j \\nabla g_j(x) = 0 \\\\\n&&&u_i \\geq 0, \\quad i = 1,\\dots,m\n\\end{align}</math>\nis called the Wolfe dual problem. This problem may be difficult to deal with computationally, because the objective function is not concave in the joint variables <math>(u,x)</math>. Also, the equality constraint <math>\\nabla f(x) + \\sum_{j=1}^m u_j \\nabla g_j(x)</math> is nonlinear in general, so the Wolfe dual problem is typically a nonconvex optimization problem. In any case, [[weak duality]] holds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geoffrion |first1=Arthur M. |title=Duality in Nonlinear Programming: A Simplified Applications-Oriented Development | jstor=2028848 |journal=SIAM Review |volume=13 |year=1971 |pages=1–37 |issue=1 |doi=10.1137/1013001}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to [[George Dantzig]], the duality theorem for linear optimization was conjectured by [[John von Neumann]] immediately after Dantzig presented the linear programming problem.

This alternative \"duality gap\" quantifies the discrepancy between the value of a current feasible but suboptimal iterate for the primal problem and the value of the dual problem; the value of the dual problem is, under regularity conditions, equal to the value of the ''[[convex relaxation]]'' of the primal problem: The convex relaxation is the problem arising replacing a non-convex feasible set with its closed [[convex hull]] and with replacing a non-convex function with its convex [[lower semi-continuous|closure]], that is the function that has the [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] that is the closed convex hull of the original primal objective function.<ref>{{cite book |author1=[[Ravindra K.

      "text": "[[File:Ellipsoid 2.png|thumb|400px|An iteration of the ellipsoid method]]\nIn [[mathematical optimization]], the '''ellipsoid method''' is an [[iterative method]] for [[convex optimization|minimizing]] [[convex function]]s. When specialized to solving feasible [[linear optimization]] problems with rational data, the ellipsoid method is an  [[algorithm]] which finds an optimal solution in a finite number of steps.\n\nThe ellipsoid method generates a sequence of [[ellipsoid]]s whose volume uniformly decreases at every step, thus enclosing a minimizer of a [[convex function]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe ellipsoid method has a long history. As an [[iterative method]], a preliminary version was introduced by [[Naum Z. Shor]]. In 1972, an [[approximation algorithm]] for real [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] was studied by [[Arkadi Nemirovski]] and David B. Yudin (Judin). As an algorithm for solving [[linear programming]] problems with rational data, the ellipsoid algorithm was studied by [[Leonid Khachiyan]]: Khachiyan's achievement was to prove the [[Polynomial time|polynomial-time]] solvability of linear programs.\n\nFollowing Khachiyan's work, the ellipsoid method was the only algorithm for solving linear programs whose runtime had been proved to be polynomial until [[Karmarkar's algorithm]]. However, Karmarkar's [[interior-point method]] and variants of the [[simplex algorithm]] are much faster than the ellipsoid method in practice. Karmarkar's algorithm is also faster in the worst case.\n\nHowever, the ellipsoidal algorithm allows [[computational complexity theory|complexity theorists]] to achieve (worst-case) bounds that depend on the dimension of the problem and on the size of the data, but not on the number of rows, so it remained important in [[combinatorial optimization]] theory for many years.<ref>[[Martin Grötschel|M.

We are also given an initial [[ellipsoid]] <math>\\mathcal{E}^{(0)} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n</math> defined as\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E}^{(0)} = \\left \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\ : \\ (z - x_0)^T P_{(0)}^{-1} (z-x_0) \\leqslant 1   \\right \\}</math>\n\ncontaining a minimizer <math>x^*</math>, where <math>P \\succ 0</math> and <math>x_0</math> is the center of <math>\\mathcal{E}</math>.  Finally, we require the existence of a [[cutting-plane]] oracle for the function ''f''.  One example of a cutting-plane is given by a [[subgradient]] ''g'' of ''f''.\n\n==Unconstrained minimization==\nAt the ''k''-th iteration of the algorithm, we have a point <math>x^{(k)}</math> at the center of an ellipsoid\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E}^{(k)} = \\left \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\ : \\ \\left (x-x^{(k)} \\right )^T P_{(k)}^{-1} \\left (x-x^{(k)} \\right ) \\leqslant 1   \\right \\}.</math>\n\nWe query the cutting-plane oracle to obtain a vector <math>g^{(k+1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</math> such that\n\n:<math>g^{(k+1)T} \\left (x^* - x^{(k)} \\right ) \\leqslant 0.</math>\n\nWe therefore conclude that\n\n:<math>x^* \\in \\mathcal{E}^{(k)} \\cap \\left \\{z \\ : \\ g^{(k+1)T} \\left (z - x^{(k)} \\right ) \\leqslant 0 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nWe set <math>\\mathcal{E}^{(k+1)}</math> to be the ellipsoid of minimal volume containing the half-ellipsoid described above and compute <math>x^{(k+1)}</math>. The update is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx^{(k+1)} &= x^{(k)} - \\frac{1}{n+1} P_{(k)} \\tilde{g}^{(k+1)} \\\\\nP_{(k+1)} &= \\frac{n^2}{n^2-1} \\left(P_{(k)} - \\frac{2}{n+1} P_{(k)} \\tilde{g}^{(k+1)} \\tilde{g}^{(k+1)T} P_{(k)} \\right ) \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\tilde{g}^{(k+1)} = \\left (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{g^{(k+1)T} P g^{(k+1)}}} \\right )g^{(k+1)}.</math>\n\nThe stopping criterion is given by the property that\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{g^{(k)T}P_{(k)}g^{(k)}} \\leqslant \\epsilon \\quad  \\Rightarrow \\quad f \\left (x^{(k)} \\right ) - f \\left(x^* \\right ) \\leqslant \\epsilon.</math>\n\n{|border = \"1\"\n|+ Sample sequence of iterates\n |-\n |[[File:Ellipsoid 1.png|thumb|center|250px|<math>k = 0</math>]]\n |[[File:Ellipsoid 2.png|thumb|center|250px|<math>k = 1</math>]]\n |[[File:Ellipsoid 3.png|thumb|center|250px|<math>k = 2</math>]]\n |-\n |[[File:Ellipsoid 4.png|thumb|center|250px|<math>k = 3</math>]]\n |[[File:Ellipsoid 5.png|thumb|center|250px|<math>k = 4</math>]]\n |[[File:Ellipsoid 6.png|thumb|center|250px|<math>k = 5</math>]]\n|}\n\n==Inequality-constrained minimization==\nAt the ''k''-th iteration of the algorithm for constrained minimization, we have a point <math>x^{(k)}</math> at the center of an ellipsoid <math>\\mathcal{E}^{(k)}</math> as before.  We also must maintain a list of values <math>f_{\\rm{best}}^{(k)}</math> recording the smallest objective value of feasible iterates so far.  Depending on whether or not the point <math>x^{(k)}</math> is feasible, we perform one of two tasks:\n\n*If <math>x^{(k)}</math> is feasible, perform essentially the same update as in the unconstrained case, by choosing a subgradient <math>g_0</math> that satisfies\n\n::<math>g_0^T \\left (x^*-x^{(k)} \\right ) + f_0 \\left (x^{(k)} \\right ) - f_{\\rm{best}}^{(k)} \\leqslant 0</math>\n\n*If <math>x^{(k)}</math> is infeasible and violates the ''j''-th constraint, update the ellipsoid with a feasibility cut.  Our feasibility cut may be a subgradient <math>g_j</math> of <math>f_j</math> which must satisfy\n\n::<math>g_j^T \\left (z-x^{(k)} \\right ) + f_j \\left (x^{(k)} \\right )\\leqslant 0</math>\n\nfor all feasible ''z''.\n\n===Application to linear programming===\n\nInequality-constrained minimization of a function that is zero everywhere corresponds to the problem of simply identifying any feasible point.  It turns out that any linear programming problem can be reduced to a linear feasibility problem (e.g. minimize the zero function subject to some linear inequality and equality constraints).  One way to do this is by combining the primal and dual linear programs together into one program, and adding the additional (linear) constraint that the value of the primal solution is [[weak duality|no worse than]] the value of the dual solution.  Another way is to treat the objective of the linear program as an additional constraint, and use binary search to find the optimum value.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Performance==\nThe ellipsoid method is used on low-dimensional problems, such as planar location problems, where it is [[numerically stable]]. On even \"small\"-sized problems, it suffers from numerical instability and poor performance in practice.\n\nHowever, the ellipsoid method is an important theoretical technique in [[combinatorial optimization]]. In [[computational complexity theory]], the ellipsoid algorithm is attractive because its complexity depends on the number of columns and the digital size of the coefficients, but not on the number of rows.

The lemma says that exactly one of the following two statements must be true (depending on ''b''<sub>1</sub> and ''b''<sub>2</sub>):\n\n# There exist ''x''<sub>1</sub> ≥ 0, ''x''<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0 such that 6 ''x''<sub>1</sub>+ 4 ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ''b''<sub>1</sub> and 3 ''x''<sub>1</sub>  = ''b''<sub>2</sub>,  or -\n# There exist ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub> such that 6 ''y''<sub>1</sub> + 3 ''y''<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0 and 4 ''y''<sub>1</sub> ≥ 0 and ''b''<sub>1</sub> ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub> ''y''<sub>2</sub> < 0.\n\nHere is a proof of the lemma in this special case: \n\n* If   ''b''<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0  and  ''b''<sub>1</sub>-2''b''<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0, then option 1 is true, since the solution of the linear equations is ''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''b''<sub>2</sub>/3  and  ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ''b''<sub>1</sub>-2''b''<sub>2</sub>.  Option 2 is false, since ''b''<sub>1</sub> ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub> ''y''<sub>2</sub> ≥ ''b2'' (2 ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''y''<sub>2</sub>) = ''b2'' (6 ''y''<sub>1</sub> + 3 ''y''<sub>2</sub>) / 3, so if the right-hand side is positive, the left-hand side must be positive too. \n* Otherwise, option 1 is false, since the unique solution of the linear equations is not weakly-positive. But in this case, option 2 is true:    \n** If ''b''<sub>2</sub> < 0 then we can take e.g. ''y''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''y''<sub>2</sub> = 1; \n** If ''b''<sub>1</sub>-2''b''<sub>2</sub> < 0  then, for some number ''B'' > 0,  ''b<sub>1</sub> = 2b<sub>2</sub> - B, so:''     ''b''<sub>1</sub> ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub> ''y''<sub>2</sub> = 2 ''b''<sub>2</sub> ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub> ''y''<sub>2</sub> - ''B'' ''y''<sub>1</sub> = ''b''<sub>2</sub> (6 ''y''<sub>1</sub> + 3 ''y''<sub>2</sub>)/3 - ''B'' ''y''<sub>1</sub>.   So we can take, for example, y1 = 1, y2 = -2.\n\n== Geometric interpretation ==\nDenote the ''convex cone'' generated by the columns of <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> by  <math>C(\\mathbf{A})=\\{\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{x} \\geq 0 \\}</math>. Then <math>C(\\mathbf{A}) </math> is a '''closed''' convex cone. The vector <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> proves that <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> lies in <math>C(\\mathbf{A})</math>, while the vector <math>\\mathbf{y}</math> gives a linear functional that separates <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> from <math>C(\\mathbf{A})</math>.\n\nLet <math>\\mathbf{a}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{a}_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}</math> denote the columns of <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>. In terms of these vectors, Farkas' lemma states that exactly one of the following two statements is true:\n# There exist coefficients <math>x_1,\\dots,x_n \\in \\mathbb{R},x_1,\\dots,x_n \\geq 0</math> , such that  <math>\\mathbf{b} =x_1\\mathbf{a}_1+\\dots+x_n \\mathbf{a}_n </math>, i.e., '''b''' lies in the cone of '''A''';\n# There exists a vector <math>\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}</math>  such that  <math>\\mathbf{a}_i^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y} \\geq 0 </math> for <math>i=1,\\dots,n </math>  and <math>\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y}  < 0</math>, i.e., there is a hyperplane through the origin, separating the vector '''b''' from the cone of '''A'''.\n\nThe vectors <math>x_1\\mathbf{a}_1+\\dots+x_n \\mathbf{a}_n </math> with nonnegative coefficients constitute the [[convex cone]] of the set <math>\\{\\mathbf{a}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{a}_n\\}</math> so the first statement says that <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is in this cone.\n\nThe second statement says that there exists a vector <math>\\mathbf{y}</math>  such that the angle of <math>\\mathbf{y}</math>  with the vectors  <math>\\mathbf{a}_i</math> is at most 90° while the angle of <math>\\mathbf{y}</math>  with the vector <math>\\mathbf{b}</math>  is more than  90°. The hyperplane normal to this vector has the vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}_i</math>  on one side and the vector <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> on the other side. Hence, this hyperplane separates the vectors in the cone of <math>\\{\\mathbf{a}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{a}_n\\}</math> and the vector <math>\\mathbf{b}</math>.\n\nFor example, let ''n,m''=2 and ''a''<sub>1</sub> = (1,0)<sup>T</sup> and ''a''<sub>2</sub> = (1,1)<sup>T</sup>. The convex cone spanned by ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub> can be seen as a wedge-shaped slice of the first quadrant in the ''x-y'' plane. Now, suppose ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0,1). Certainly, ''b'' is not in the convex cone ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>1</sub>+''a''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>. Hence, there must be a separating hyperplane. Let ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(1,−1)<sup>T</sup>. We can see that ''a''<sub>1</sub> · ''y'' = 1, ''a''<sub>2</sub> · ''y'' = 0, and ''b'' · ''y'' = −1. Hence, the hyperplane with normal ''y'' indeed separates the convex cone ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>1</sub>+''a''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub> from ''b''.\n\n== Logic interpretation ==\nA particularly suggestive and easy-to-remember version is the following: if a set of inequalities has no solution, then a contradiction can be produced from it by linear combination with nonnegative coefficients.  In formulas: if <math>Ax</math> ≤ <math>b</math> is unsolvable then <math>y^{\\mathsf{T}} A = 0</math>, <math>y^{\\mathsf{T}} b = -1</math>, <math>y</math> ≥ <math>0</math> has a solution.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Boyd|first1=Stephen P.|title=Convex Optimization|year=2004|chapter=Section 5.8.3|chapter-url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|chapter-format=pdf|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|accessdate=October 15, 2011|last2=Vandenberghe|first2=Lieven}}</ref> Note that <math>y^{\\mathsf{T}} A</math> is a combination of the left hand sides, <math>y^{\\mathsf{T}} b</math> a combination of the right hand side of the inequalities.  Since the positive combination produces a zero vector on the left and a −1 on the right, the contradiction is apparent.\n\nThus, Farkas' lemma can be viewed as a theorem of [[Completeness (logic)|logical completeness]]: <math>Ax</math> ≤ <math>b</math> is a set of \"axioms\", the linear combinations are the \"derivation rules\", and the lemma says that, if the set of axioms is inconsistent, then it can be refuted using the derivation rules.<ref name=\"gm06\">{{Cite Gartner Matousek 2006}} Pages 81–104.</ref>{{Rp|92-94}}\n\n== Variants ==\nThe Farkas Lemma has several variants with different sign-constraints (the first one is the original version):<ref name=\"gm06\" />{{Rp|92}}\n\n* Either the system <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{x} \\geq 0</math>  ,    or the system <math>\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y} \\geq 0</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y}  < 0</math>.\n* Either the system <math>\\mathbf{Ax} \\leq \\mathbf{b}</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{x} \\geq 0</math>  ,    or the system <math>\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y} \\geq 0</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y}  < 0 </math> and <math> \\mathbf{y} \\geq 0</math>.\n* Either the system <math>\\mathbf{Ax} \\leq \\mathbf{b}</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</math>  ,    or the system <math>\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y} = 0</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y}  < 0</math> and <math> \\mathbf{y} \\geq 0</math>.\n* Either the system <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</math>  ,  or the system <math>\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y} = 0</math> has a solution with <math>\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y}  \\neq  0</math>.\n\nThe latter variant is mentioned for completeness; it is not actually a \"Farkas lemma\" since it contains only equalities. Its proof is a simple exercise in linear algebra.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n{{math_theorem|name=Generalized Farkas' lemma| Let <math>\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}</math> , <math>\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}</math>, <math> \\mathbf{S} </math> is a closed convex cone in <math> \\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> and the [[dual cone]] of <math> \\mathbf{S}</math> is  <math>\\mathbf{S^{*}} =\\{ \\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} | \\mathbf{z}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0, \\forall \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{S} \\} </math>. If convex cone <math>C(\\mathbf{A})=\\{\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}| \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{S} \\}</math> is  closed, then exactly one of the following two statements is true:\n# There exists an <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> such that <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{S} </math>.\n# There exists a <math>\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}</math> such that <math>\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbf{S^{*}} </math> and <math>\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{y}  < 0</math>. }}\n\nGeneralized Farkas' lemma can be interpreted geometrically as follows: either a vector is in a given closed [[cone (linear algebra)|convex cone]] or there exists a [[hyperplane]] separating the vector from the cone—there are no other possibilities. The closedness condition is necessary, see '''Separation theorem I''' in [[Hyperplane separation theorem]]. For original Farkas' lemma, <math> \\mathbf{S} </math> is the nonnegative orthant  <math>\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}</math>, hence the closedness condition holds automatically. Indeed, for polyhedral convex cone, i.e., there  exists a <math>\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}</math>  such  that  <math> \\mathbf{S}=\\{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{k} \\} </math>, the closedness condition holds automatically. In [[convex optimization]], various kinds of constraint qualification, e.g. [[Slater's condition]], are responsible for closedness of the underlying convex cone <math>C(\\mathbf{A}) </math>. \n\nBy setting <math> \\mathbf{S} =\\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{S^{*}}=\\{0\\}</math>  in Generalized Farkas' lemma, we obtain the following corollary about the solvability for a finite system of linear equalities. \n{{math_theorem|name=Corollary| Let <math>\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}</math>.

An extension of Farkas' lemma can be used to analyze the strong duality conditions for and construct the dual of a semidefinite program. It is sufficient to prove the existence of the Kuhn–Tucker constraints using the [[Fredholm alternative]] but for the condition to be necessary, one must apply Von Neumann's [[minimax theorem]] to show the equations derived by Cauchy are not violated.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hyperplane separation theorem]]\n*[[Dual linear program]]\n*[[Fourier–Motzkin elimination]] - can be used to prove Farkas' lemma.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n== Further reading ==\n* {{citation|first = R.

      "text": "In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''fundamental theorem of [[linear programming]]''' states, in a weak formulation, that the [[maxima and minima]] of a [[linear function]] over a [[convex polygon]]al region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the [[line segment]] between them.\n\n==Statement==\nConsider the optimization problem \n\n:<math>\\min c^T x \\text{ subject to } x \\in P</math>\n\nWhere <math>P = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : Ax \\leq b\\}</math>.  If <math>P</math> is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and <math>x^\\ast</math> is an optimal solution to the problem, then <math>x^\\ast</math> is either an extreme point (vertex) of <math>P</math>, or lies on a face <math>F \\subset P</math> of optimal solutions.\n\n==Proof==\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that <math>x^\\ast \\in \\mathrm{int}(P)</math>. Then there exists some <math>\\epsilon > 0</math> such that the ball of radius <math>\\epsilon</math> centered at <math>x^\\ast</math> is contained in <math>P</math>, that is <math>B_{\\epsilon}(x^\\ast) \\subset P</math>.  Therefore,\n\n:<math>x^\\ast - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\frac{c}{||c||} \\in P</math> and \n\n:<math>c^T\\left( x^\\ast - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\frac{c}{||c||}\\right) = c^T x^\\ast - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\frac{c^T c}{||c||} = c^T x^\\ast - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} ||c|| < c^T x^\\ast.</math>\n\nHence <math>x^\\ast</math> is not an optimal solution, a contradiction. Therefore, <math>x^\\ast</math> must live on the boundary of <math>P</math>. If <math>x^\\ast</math> is not a vertex itself, it must be the convex combination of vertices of <math>P</math>, say <math>x_1, ..., x_t</math>.  Then <math>x^\\ast = \\sum_{i=1}^t \\lambda_i x_i</math> with <math>\\lambda_i \\geq 0</math> and <math>\\sum_{i=1}^t \\lambda_i = 1</math>.

Since the sum is equal to zero, we must have that each individual term is equal to zero.  Hence, <math>c^{T}x^{\\ast}=c^{T}x_{i}</math> for each <math>x_i</math>, so every <math>x_i</math> is also optimal, and therefore all points on the face whose vertices are <math>x_1, ..., x_t</math>, are optimal solutions.\n\n==References==\n* http://www.linearprogramming.info/fundamental-theorem-of-linear-programming-and-its-properties/\n* http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TheFundamentalTheoremOfLinearProgramming/\n\n{{Fundamental theorems}}\n[[Category:Fundamental theorems]]\n[[Category:Linear programming]]"

For example, the Graver basis of <math>A=(1, 2, 1)</math> consists of the vectors (2,&minus;1,0), (0,&minus;1,2), (1,0,&minus;1), (1,&minus;1,1) and their negations.\n\n==Solving integer programming using Graver bases==\n\n[[Integer programming]] is the problem of optimizing a linear or nonlinear objective function over the set of integer points satisfying a system of linear inequalities. Formally, it can be written in standard form as follows:\n\n:<math>\\min\\{f(x)\\ :\\ x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n,\\ Ax=b,\\ l\\leq x\\leq u\\}\\ .</math>\n\nIt is one of the most fundamental discrete optimization problems and has a very broad modeling power and numerous applications in a variety of areas, but is typically very hard computationally as noted below. However, given the Graver basis <math>G(A)</math> of <math>A</math>, the problem with linear and various nonlinear objective functions can be solved in polynomial time as explained next.\n\n===Linear integer programming===\n\nThe most studied case, treated thoroughly in,<ref name=\"Sch\">[[Alexander Schrijver]]: ''Theory of Linear and Integer Programming'', Wiley, xii+471 pp., 1986</ref> is that of [[integer programming|linear integer programming]],\n\n:<math>\\min\\{wx\\ :\\ x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n,\\ Ax=b,\\ l\\leq x\\leq u\\}\\ .</math>\n\nIt may be assumed that all variables are bounded from below and above: such bounds either appear naturally in the application at hand, or can be enforced without losing any optimal solutions. But, even with linear objective functions the problem is NP-hard and hence presumably cannot be solved in polynomial time.\n\nHowever, given the Graver basis <math>G(A)</math> of <math>A</math> it ''can'' be solved in polynomial time using the following simple iterative algorithm.<ref name=\"Onn\" /><ref name=\"HOW\">Raymond Hemmecke, Shmuel Onn, Robert Weismantel: A polynomial oracle-time\nalgorithm for convex integer minimization, Mathematical Programming\n126:97–117, 2011</ref>  Assume first that some initial feasible point ''x'' is given. While possible, repeat the following iteration: find positive integer ''q'' and element ''g'' in <math>G(A)</math> such that ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''qg'' does not violate the bounds and gives best possible improvement; update ''x''&nbsp;:=&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''qg'' and proceed to the next iteration. The last point ''x'' is optimal and the number of iterations is polynomial. To find an initial feasible point, a suitable auxiliary program can be set up and solved in a similar fashion.\n\n===Nonlinear integer programming===\n\nTurning to the case of general objective functions ''f'', if the variables are unbounded then the problem may in fact be uncomputable: it follows from the solution of [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] (see <ref name=\"Mat\">Yuri V. Matiyasevich: ''Hilbert's Tenth Problem'', MIT Press, xxiv+264 pp., 1993</ref>), that there exists no algorithm which, given an integer polynomial ''f'' of degree 8 in 58 variables, decides if the minimum value of f over all 58-dimensional integer vectors is 0. However, when the variables are bounded, the problem\n\n: <math>\\min\\{f(x)\\ :\\ x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n,\\ Ax=b,\\ l\\leq x\\leq u\\}</math>\n\ncan be solved using the Graver basis <math>G(A)</math> in polynomial time for\nseveral nonlinear objective functions including{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}:\n\n* '''Separable-convex''' functions of the form <math>f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i)</math>;\n* In particular the '''p-norm''' <math>f(x)=\\|x\\|_p</math> for every positive integer ''p'';\n* '''Composite-concave''' functions ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''g''(''Wx''), where ''W'' is a ''d''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' integer matrix with ''d'' fixed, and where ''g'' is a ''d''-variate concave function;\n* Certain '''(in)-definite quadratic''' and '''higher degree polynomial''' functions.\n\n==Some applications==\n\n===Multi-dimensional tables===\n\nConsider the following optimization problem over three-dimensional tables with prescribed line sums,\n\n:<math>\\min\\{wx\\ :\\ x\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}_+^{l\\times m\\times n}\\,,\\ \\sum_i x_{i,j,k}=a_{j,k} \\,,\\ \\sum_j x_{i,j,k}=b_{i,k}\\,,\\ \\sum_k x_{i,j,k}=c_{i,j}\\}\\ ,</math>\n\nwith <math>a_{j,k}</math>, <math>b_{i,k}</math>, <math>c_{i,j}</math> nonnegative integers (whose maximum value implicitly bounds all variables from above). Denote by <math>A</math> the (''lm''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''ln''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''mn'')&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;(''lmn'') defining matrix of this system. Note that this matrix is generally ''not'' [[totally unimodular]]. Nonetheless, it was shown in <ref name=\"DHOW\">[[Jesús A. De Loera]], Raymond Hemmecke, Shmuel Onn, Robert Weismantel: ''N''-fold integer programming, Discrete\nOptimization, 5:231–241, 2008</ref> that for every fixed ''l'' and ''m'', its Graver basis <math>G(A)</math> can be computed in time which is polynomial in&nbsp;''n''. The results mentioned above allow then to solve this problem in polynomial time for fixed ''l'' and ''m'' and variable ''n''. Note that if only one side ''l'' of the table is fixed (even with ''l''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3) while both ''m'' and ''n'' are variable, then the problem is NP hard, as shown in.<ref name=\"DO1\">[[Jesús A. De Loera]], Shmuel Onn: The complexity of\nthree-way statistical tables, SIAM Journal on Computing, 33:819–836, 2004</ref> More generally, similar positive results hold for higher-dimensional table problems (introduced in <ref name=\"Mot\">Theodore S. Motzkin: The multi-index transportation\nproblem, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 58:494, 1952</ref>): for every fixed ''d'' and <math>m_1, \\dots, m_d</math>, (non)-linear optimization over <math>m_1 \\times \\cdots \\times m_d \\times n</math> tables with variable n and prescribed margins can be done in polynomial time. This has further applications to entry security problems and privacy in statistical databases.\n\n===Multi-commodity flows===\n\nConsider the ''integer'' [[multi-commodity flow problem]] of routing ''k'' types of integer commodities from ''m'' suppliers to ''n'' consumers subject to supply, consumption, and capacity constraints, so as to minimize the sum of linear or congestion-dependent convex costs on the arcs. Then for every fixed ''k'' and ''m'', the Graver basis of the defining system can be computed and the resulting separable-convex objective function\nminimized in time which is polynomial in the variable number ''n'' of consumers and in the rest of the data.\n\n===Other applications===\n\nThe many applications of the algorithmic theory of Graver bases also include stochastic integer programming,<ref name=\"HOW\" /> ''N''-fold integer programming, ''N''-fold 4-block decomposable integer programming,<ref name=\"HKW\">Raymond Hemmecke, Matthias Köppe, Robert Weismantel: A polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing over ''N''-fold 4-block decomposable integer programs, IPCO 14, 2010</ref> clustering, and disclosure control in statistical databases. In some of these applications the relevant Graver basis ''cannot'' be computed in polynomial time, but can be accessed in an indirect way that allows to use it in polynomial time.\n\n==Universality and parametrization==\n\nIt was shown in <ref name=\"DO2\">Jesus A. De Loera, Shmuel Onn: All\nlinear and integer programs are slim 3-way transportation programs, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 17:806–821, 2006</ref> that every (bounded) integer programming problem is precisely equivalent to the 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' table problem discussed above for some ''m'' and ''n'' and some line sums. Thus, such 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' table problems are '''universal''' for integer programming. Moreover, for each fixed ''m'', the resulting class of integer programs can be solved in polynomial time by the iterative Graver basis method described above. So the table width ''m'' provides a '''parametrization''' of all integer programming problems.\n\n==Hierarchy of approximations for integer programming==\n\nDenote by <math>G(m,n)</math> the Graver basis of the matrix <math>A</math> defining the universal 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' table problem discussed above. The elements of <math>G(m,n)</math> are 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' tables with all line sums equal to 0. The ''type'' of such a table is the number of its nonzero 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m'' ''layers''. It turns out that there is a finite ''Graver complexity function'' ''g''(''m'') such that for any ''n'', the type of any element of the Graver basis <math>G(m,n)</math> is at most ''g''(''m''). It follows that the Graver basis <math>G(m,n)</math> is the union of the <math>{n\\choose g(m)}</math> suitably embedded copies of the Graver basis <math>G(m,g(m))</math>. To approximately solve in practice an arbitrary integer programming problem, proceed as follows. First embed it in a suitable 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' table problem as enabled by the universality noted above. Now apply the following hierarchy of approximations of <math>G(m,n)</math>. At level ''k'' of this hierarchy, let <math>G_k(m,n)</math> be the subset of <math>G(m,n)</math> consisting only of those elements of type at most ''k''; use this approximation <math>G_k(m,n)</math> in the iterative algorithm as long as possible to obtain as good as possible feasible point for the integer programming problem embedded in the 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' table problem; if the objective function value of this point is satisfactory (say, as compared to the value of the [[linear programming relaxation]]), then use this point; otherwise increment ''k'' and proceed to the next level of the hierarchy. It can be shown <ref name=\"Onn\" /> that for any fixed level ''k'', the approximation <math>G_k(m,n)</math> of the Graver basis has polynomial cardinality <math>O\\left(m^{g(k)}n^k\\right)</math> and can be computed in that much time.\n\n==Fixed parameter tractability: from polynomial to cubic time complexity==\n\nThe time complexity of solving some of the applications discussed above, such as multi-dimensional table problems, multicommodity flow problems, and ''N''-fold integer programming problems, is dominated by the cardinality of the relevant Graver basis, which is a polynomial <math>O\\left(n^g\\right)</math> with typically large degree ''g'' which\nis a suitable Graver complexity of the system. In <ref name=\"HOR\">Raymond Hemmecke, Shmuel Onn, Lyubov Romanchuk: ''N''-fold integer programming in cubic time, Mathematical Programming, 137:325–341, 2013</ref> a much faster algorithm is presented, which finds at each iteration the best improvement ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''qg'' with ''q'' positive integer and ''g'' element in <math>G(A)</math> ''without explicitly constructing the Graver basis'', in cubic time <math>O\\left(n^3\\right)</math> regardless of the system.\nIn the terminology of [[parameterized complexity]], this implies that all these problems suitably parameterized, and in particular ''l''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' table problems parametrized by ''l'' and ''m'', are '''fixed parameter tractable'''.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Linear programming]]"

      "text": "[[File:Icosidodecahedral graph.png|thumb|The graph of an [[Icosidodecahedron]], an example for which the conjecture is true.]]\nIn [[mathematical programming]] and [[polyhedral combinatorics]], the '''Hirsch conjecture''' is the statement that the [[Edge (geometry)|edge]]-[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of an ''n''-[[Facet (mathematics)|facet]] [[polytope]] in ''d''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] has [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] no more than ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''d''. That is, any two [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the polytope must be connected to each other by a path of [[Glossary of graph theory#Walks|length]] at most ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''d''.  The conjecture was first put forth in a letter by {{Interlanguage link multi|Warren M. Hirsch|es|vertical-align=sup}} to [[George B. Dantzig]] in 1957<ref name=\"z84\" /><ref>{{harvtxt|Dantzig|1963}}, pp. 160 and 168.</ref> and was motivated by the analysis of the [[simplex method]] in [[linear programming]], as the diameter of a polytope provides a lower bound on the number of steps needed by the simplex method.  The conjecture is now known to be false in general.\n\nThe Hirsch conjecture was proven for ''d'' < 4 and for various special cases,<ref>E.g. see {{harvtxt|Naddef|1989}} for 0-1 polytopes.</ref> while the best known upper bounds on the diameter are only sub-exponential in ''n'' and ''d''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kalai|Kleitman|1992}}.</ref> After more than fifty years, a counter-example was announced in May 2010 by [[Francisco Santos Leal]], from the [[University of Cantabria]].<ref name=disproved>{{harvtxt|Santos|2011}}.</ref><ref name=Kalai-blog-Hirsch>{{harvtxt|Kalai|2010}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://gaussianos.com/francisco-santos-encuentra-un-contraejemplo-que-refuta-la-conjetura-de-hirsch/|title=Francisco Santos encuentra un contraejemplo que refuta la conjetura de Hirsch|website=Gaussianos|date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> The result was presented at the conference ''100 Years in Seattle: the mathematics of [[Victor Klee|Klee]] and [[Branko Grünbaum|Grünbaum]]'' and appeared in ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Santos|2011}}</ref> Specifically, the paper presented a 43-dimensional polytope of 86 facets with a diameter of more than 43. The counterexample has no direct consequences for the analysis of the simplex method, as it does not rule out the possibility of a larger but still linear or polynomial number of steps.\n\nVarious equivalent formulations of the problem had been given, such as the ''d''-step conjecture, which states that the diameter of any 2''d''-facet polytope in ''d''-dimensional Euclidean space is no more than ''d''; Santos Leal's counterexample also disproves this conjecture.<ref name=\"z84\">{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1994}}, p. 84.</ref><ref name=\"d-step\">{{harvtxt|Klee|Walkup|1967}}.</ref>\n\n== Statement of the Conjecture ==\n\nThe ''graph'' of a convex [[polytope]] <math>P</math> is any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose vertices are in [[bijection]] with the vertices of <math>P</math> in such a way that any two vertices of the graph are joined by an edge if and only if the two corresponding vertices of <math>P</math> are joined by an edge of the polytope. The [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] of <math>P</math>, denoted <math>\\delta(P)</math>, is the diameter of any one of its graphs. These definitions are [[well-defined]] since any two graphs of the same polytope must be [[isomorphism | isomorphic]] as graphs. We may then state the Hirsch conjecture as follows:\n\n'''Conjecture''' Let <math>P</math> be a ''d''-dimensional convex polytope with ''n'' facets. Then <math>\\delta(P)\\leq n-d</math>.\n\nFor example, a cube in three dimensions has six facets. The Hirsch conjecture then indicates that the diameter of this cube cannot be greater than three. Accepting the conjecture would imply that any two vertices of the cube may be connected by a [[Path (graph theory) | path]] from vertex to vertex using, at most, three steps. For all polytopes of dimension at least 8, this bound is actually optimal; no polytope of dimension <math>d\\geq 8</math> has a diameter less than ''n-d'', with ''n'' being the number of its facets, as before.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1994}}</ref> In other words, for nearly all cases, the conjecture provides the minimum number of steps needed to join any two vertices of a polytope by a path along its edges. Since the [[simplex method]] essentially operates by constructing a path from some vertex of the [[feasible region]] to an optimal point, the Hirsch conjecture would provide a lower bound needed for the simplex method to terminate in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe Hirsch conjecture is a special case of the ''polynomial Hirsch conjecture'', which claims that there exists some positive integer ''k'' such that, for all polytopes <math>P</math>, <math>\\delta(P)=O(n^k)</math>, where ''n'' is the number of facets of ''P''.\n\n== Progress and Intermediate Results ==\n\nThe Hirsch conjecture has been proven true for a number of cases. For example, any polytope with dimension 3 or lower satisfies the conjecture. Any ''d''-dimensional polytope with ''n'' facets such that <math> n-d\\leq 6 </math> satisfies the conjecture as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1994}}</ref>\n\nOther attempts to solve the conjecture manifested out of a desire to formulate a different problem whose solution would imply the Hirsch conjecture. One example of particular importance is the ''d-step conjecture'', a relaxation of the Hirsch conjecture that has actually been shown to be equivalent to it.\n\n'''Theorem''' The following statements are equivalent:\n# <math>\\delta(P)\\leq n-d </math> for all ''d''-dimensional polytopes <math>P</math> with ''n'' facets.\n# <math>\\delta(P)\\leq d </math> for all ''d''-dimensional polytopes <math>P</math> with ''2d'' facets.\n\nIn other words, in order to prove or disprove the Hirsch conjecture, one only needs to consider polytopes with exactly twice as many facets as its dimension. Another significant relaxation is that the Hirsch conjecture holds for all polytopes if and only if it holds for all [[simple polytope | simple polytopes]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1994}}</ref>\n\n== Counterexample ==\n\n[[File:Octahedron.jpg|thumb|The [[octahedron]] is one of the most well-known examples of a spindle.]]\n\nUnfortunately, the Hirsch conjecture is not true in all cases, as shown by Francisco Santos in 2011. Santos' explicit construction of a counterexample comes both from the fact that the conjecture may be relaxed to only consider simple polytopes, and from equivalence between the Hirsch and ''d''-step conjectures.<ref>{{harvtxt|Santos|2011}}</ref> In particular, Santos produces his counterexample by examining a particular class of polytopes called ''spindles''.\n\n'''Definition''' A ''d''-spindle is a ''d''-dimensional polytope <math>P</math> for which there exist a pair of distinct vertices such that every facet of <math>P</math> contains exactly one of these two vertices.\n\nThe length of the shortest path between these two vertices is called the ''length'' of the spindle. The disproof of the Hirsch conjecture relies on the following theorem, referred to as the ''strong d-step theorem for spindles''.\n\n'''Theorem (Santos)''' Let <math>P</math> be a ''d''-spindle. Let ''n'' be the number of its facets, and let ''l'' be its length. Then there exists an <math>(n-d)</math>-spindle, <math>P'</math>, with <math>2n-2d</math> facets and a length bounded below by <math>l+n-2d</math>. In particular, if <math>l>d</math>, then <math>P'</math> violates the ''d''-step conjecture.\n\nSantos then proceeds to construct a 5-dimensionsal spindle with length 6, hence proving that there exists another spindle that serves as a counterexample to the Hirsch conjecture. The first of these two spindles has 48 facets and 322 vertices, while the spindle that actually disproves the conjecture has 86 facets and is 43-dimensional. This counterexample does not disprove the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which remains an open problem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Santos|2011}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Dantzig|first=George B.|authorlink=George B.

When the dimension is two, the \"cube\" is a squashed square. When the dimension is three, the \"cube\" is a squashed cube. Illustrations of the \"cube\" have appeared besides algebraic descriptions.<ref name=\"DNT08\" /><ref name=\"GZ94\" />\n\nThe Klee–Minty polytope is given by<ref>Greenberg, Harvey J., ''Klee-Minty Polytope Shows Exponential Time Complexity of Simplex Method'' University of Colorado at Denver (1997) [http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/notes/Klee-Minty.pdf PDF download]</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_1\\le 5\\\\\n4x_1+x_2 \\le 25\\\\\n8x_1+4x_2+x_3 \\le 125 \\\\\n \\vdots\\\\\n2^Dx_1+2^{D-1}x_2+ \\dots +4x_{D-1}+x_D \\le 5^D \\\\\nx_1\\ge0, \\, \\, \\dots , \\, \\, x_D \\ge0.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis has ''D'' variables, ''D'' constraints other than the ''D'' non-negativity constraints, and 2<sup>''D''</sup> vertices, just as a ''D''-dimensional [[hypercube]] does.

The [[time complexity]] of an [[algorithm]] counts the number of [[arithmetic operation]]s sufficient for the algorithm to solve the problem. For example, [[Gaussian elimination]] requires on the [[Big oh|order&nbsp;of]]''&nbsp;D''<sup>3</sup> operations, and so it is said to have polynomial time-complexity, because its complexity is bounded by a [[cubic polynomial]]. There are examples of algorithms that do not have polynomial-time complexity. For example, a generalization of Gaussian elimination called [[Buchberger's algorithm]] has for its complexity an <!--doubly --> exponential function of the problem data (the [[degree of a polynomial|degree of the polynomials]] and the number of variables of the [[multivariate polynomial]]s). Because exponential functions eventually grow much faster than polynomial functions, an<!-- attained rather than upper bound --> exponential complexity implies that an algorithm has slow performance on large problems.\n\n=== Worst case ===\n[[File:Simplex description.png|thumb|240px|An illustration of a three-dimensional [[polytope]] which is the feasible region for a linear programming problem.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_inequality",
      "text": "In mathematics  a '''linear inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] which involves a [[linear function]]. A linear inequality contains one of the symbols of inequality:<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|Heeren|1986|loc=p. 355}}</ref>. It shows the data which is not equal in graph form.\n* < is less than\n\n* > is greater than\n* ≤ is less than or equal to\n* ≥ is greater than or equal to\n* ≠ is not equal to\n* = is equal to \nA linear inequality looks exactly like a [[linear equation]], with the inequality sign replacing the equality sign.\n\n==Linear inequalities of real numbers==\n\n===Two-dimensional linear inequalities===\n[[File:Linearineq1.svg|thumb|<center>Graph of linear inequality:<br> x + 3y < 9</center>]]\n\nTwo-dimensional linear inequalities are expressions in two variables of the form:\n:<math>ax + by < c \\text{ and } ax + by \\geq c,</math>\nwhere the inequalities may either be strict or not. The solution set of such an inequality can be graphically represented by a half-plane (all the points on one \"side\" of a fixed line) in the Euclidean plane.<ref>Technically, for this statement to be correct both ''a'' and ''b'' can not simultaneously be zero. In that situation, the solution set is either empty or the entire plane.</ref> The line that determines the half-planes (''ax'' + ''by'' = ''c'') is not included in the solution set when the inequality is strict. A simple procedure to determine which half-plane is in the solution set is to calculate the value of ''ax'' + ''by'' at a point (''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''y''<sub>0</sub>) which is not on the line and observe whether or not the inequality is satisfied.\n\nFor example,<ref>{{harvnb|Angel|Porter|1989|loc=p. 310}}</ref> to draw the solution set of ''x'' + 3''y'' < 9, one first draws the line with equation ''x'' + 3''y'' = 9 as a dotted line, to indicate that the line is not included in the solution set since the inequality is strict. Then, pick a convenient point not on the line, such as (0,0). Since 0 + 3(0) = 0 < 9, this point is in the solution set, so the half-plane containing this point (the half-plane \"below\" the line) is the solution set of this linear inequality.\n\n===Linear inequalities in general dimensions===\nIn '''R'''<sup>n</sup> linear inequalities are the expressions that may be written in the form\n\n:<math> f(\\bar{x}) < b </math> or <math> f(\\bar{x}) \\leq b,</math> \nwhere ''f'' is a [[linear form]] (also called a ''linear functional''), <math>\\bar{x} = (x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)</math> and ''b'' a constant real number.\n \nMore concretely, this may be written out as\n:<math>a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n < b </math>\nor\n:<math>a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n \\leq b.</math>\n\nHere <math>x_1, x_2,...,x_n</math> are called the unknowns, and <math>a_{1}, a_{2},..., a_{n}</math> are called the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, these may be written as\n\n:<math> g(x) < 0 \\,</math> or <math> g(x) \\leq 0,</math> \nwhere ''g'' is an [[affine function]].<ref>In the 2-dimensional case, both linear forms and affine functions are historically called ''linear functions'' because their graphs are lines. In other dimensions, neither type of function has a graph which is a line, so the generalization of linear function in two dimensions to higher dimensions is done by means of algebraic properties and this causes the split into two types of functions. However, the difference between affine functions and linear forms is just the addition of a constant.</ref>\n\nThat is\n: <math>a_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n < 0</math>\nor\n: <math>a_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n \\leq 0.</math>\n\nNote that any inequality containing a \"greater than\" or a \"greater than or equal\" sign can be rewritten with a \"less than\" or \"less than or equal\" sign, so there is no need to define linear inequalities using those signs.\n\n===Systems of linear inequalities===\nA system of linear inequalities is a set of linear inequalities in the same variables:\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\na_{11} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{12} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{1n} x_n &&\\; \\leq \\;&&& b_1      \\\\\na_{21} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{22} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{2n} x_n &&\\; \\leq \\;&&& b_2      \\\\\n\\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&     && \\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&              && \\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&     &&& \\;\\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{m2} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{mn} x_n &&\\; \\leq \\;&&& b_m      \\\\\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nHere <math>x_1,\\ x_2,...,x_n</math> are the unknowns, <math>a_{11},\\ a_{12},...,\\ a_{mn}</math> are the coefficients of the system, and <math>b_1,\\ b_2,...,b_m</math> are the constant terms.\n\nThis can be concisely written as the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] inequality\n\n:<math>Ax \\leq b,</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is an ''m''&times;''n'' matrix, ''x'' is an ''n''&times;1 [[column vector]] of variables, and ''b'' is an ''m''&times;1 column vector of constants.\n\nIn the above systems both strict and non-strict inequalities may be used.\n\n*Not all systems of linear inequalities have solutions.\n\n===Applications ===\n\n====Polyhedra====\nThe set of solutions of a real linear inequality constitutes a [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] of the 'n'-dimensional real space, one of the two defined by the corresponding linear equation.\n\nThe set of solutions of a system of linear inequalities corresponds to the intersection of the half-spaces defined by individual inequalities. It is a [[convex set]], since the half-spaces are convex sets, and the intersection of a set of convex sets is also convex. In the non-[[degenerate case]]s this convex set is a [[convex polyhedron]] (possibly unbounded, e.g., a half-space, a slab between two parallel half-spaces or a [[polyhedral cone]]). It may also be empty or a convex polyhedron of lower dimension confined to an [[affine subspace]] of the ''n''-dimensional space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n====Linear programming====\n{{main|Linear programming}}\n\nA linear programming problem seeks to optimize (find a maximum or minimum value) a function (called the [[Loss function|objective function]]) subject to a number of constraints on the variables which, in general, are linear inequalities.<ref>{{harvnb|Angel|Porter|1989|loc=p. 373}}</ref> The list of constraints is a system of linear inequalities.\n\n==Generalization==\n\nThe above definition requires well-defined operations of [[addition]], [[multiplication]] and [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]]; therefore, the notion of a linear inequality may be extended to [[ordered ring]]s, and in particular to [[ordered field]]s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first1=Allen R.|last1=Angel|first2=Stuart R.|last2=Porter|edition=3rd|year=1989|title=A Survey of Mathematics with Applications|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-13696-1}}\n* {{citation|first1=Charles D.|last1=Miller|first2=Vern E.|last2=Heeren|year=1986|edition=5th|title=Mathematical Ideas|publisher=Scott, Foresman|isbn=0-673-18276-2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121225122022/http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/linear_inequalities Khan Academy: Linear inequalities, free online micro lectures]\n\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Linear programming]]\n[[Category:Polyhedra]]"

      "text": "[[File:IP_polytope_with_LP_relaxation.svg|right|thumb|300px|A (general) [[integer program]] and its LP-relaxation]]\nIn mathematics, the '''relaxation''' of a [[Mixed integer linear programming|(mixed) integer linear program]] is the problem that arises by removing the integrality constraint of each variable.\n\nFor example, in a [[0-1 integer program]], all constraints are of the form\n\n:<math>x_i\\in\\{0,1\\}</math>.\n\nThe relaxation of the original integer program instead uses a collection of linear constraints\n:<math>0 \\le x_i \\le 1.</math>\n\nThe resulting relaxation is a [[linear program]], hence the name. This [[Relaxation technique (mathematics)|relaxation technique]] transforms an [[NP-hard]] optimization problem (integer programming) into a related problem that is solvable in [[polynomial time]] (linear programming); the solution to the relaxed linear program can be used to gain information about the solution to the original integer program.\n\n==Example==\nConsider the [[set cover problem]], the linear programming relaxation of which was first considered by {{harvtxt|Lovász|1975}}. In this problem, one is given as input a family of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s ''F'' = {''S''<sub>0</sub>, ''S''<sub>1</sub>, ...}; the task is to find a subfamily, with as few sets as possible, having the same [[union (set theory)|union]] as ''F''.\n\nTo formulate this as a 0-1 integer program, form an [[indicator variable]] ''x<sub>i</sub>'' for each set ''S<sub>i</sub>'', that takes the value 1 when ''S<sub>i</sub>'' belongs to the chosen subfamily and 0 when it does not. Then a valid cover can be described by an assignment of values to the indicator variables satisfying the constraints\n:<math>\\textstyle x_i\\in\\{0,1\\}</math>\n(that is, only the specified indicator variable values are allowed) and, for each element ''e<sub>j</sub>'' of the union of ''F'',\n:<math>\\textstyle \\sum_{\\{i\\mid e_j\\in S_i\\}} x_i \\ge 1</math>\n(that is, each element is covered). The minimum set cover corresponds to the assignment of indicator variables satisfying these constraints and minimizing the linear objective function\n:<math>\\textstyle \\min \\sum_i x_i.</math>\nThe linear programming relaxation of the set cover problem describes a ''fractional cover'' in which the input sets are assigned weights such that the total weight of the sets containing each element is at least one and the total weight of all sets is minimized.\n\nAs a specific example of the set cover problem, consider the instance ''F'' = {{''a'', ''b''}, {''b'', ''c''}, {''a'', ''c''}}. There are three optimal set covers, each of which includes two of the three given sets. Thus, the optimal value of the objective function of the corresponding 0-1 integer program is 2, the number of sets in the optimal covers. However, there is a fractional solution in which each set is assigned the weight 1/2, and for which the total value of the objective function is 3/2. Thus, in this example, the linear programming relaxation has a value differing from that of the unrelaxed 0-1 integer program.\n\n==Solution quality of relaxed and original programs==\nThe linear programming relaxation of an integer program may be solved using any standard linear programming technique. If the optimal solution to the linear program happens to have all variables either 0 or 1, it will also be an optimal solution to the original integer program. However, this is generally not true, except for some special cases (e.g., \nproblems with [[totally unimodular]] matrix specifications.)\n\nIn all cases, though, the solution quality of the linear program is at least as good as that of the integer program, because any integer program solution would also be a valid linear program solution. That is, in a maximization problem, the relaxed program has a value greater than or equal to that of the original program, while in a minimization problem such as the set cover problem the relaxed program has a value smaller than or equal to that of the original program. Thus, the relaxation provides an optimistic bound on the integer program's solution.\n\nIn the example instance of the set cover problem described above, in which the relaxation has an optimal solution value of 3/2, we can deduce that the optimal solution value of the unrelaxed integer program is at least as large. Since the set cover problem has solution values that are integers (the numbers of sets chosen in the subfamily), the optimal solution quality must be at least as large as the next larger integer, 2. Thus, in this instance, despite having a different value from the unrelaxed problem, the linear programming relaxation gives us a tight lower bound on the solution quality of the original problem.\n\n==Approximation and integrality gap==\n\n<!-- this section is linked to from [[Randomized_rounding]], please update that link there if you change the section title here --nealeyoung May 31, 2010 -->\n\nLinear programming relaxation is a standard technique for designing [[approximation algorithm]]s for hard optimization problems. In this application, an important concept is the '''integrality gap''', the maximum ratio between the solution quality of the integer program and of its relaxation. In an instance of a minimization problem, if the real minimum (the minimum of the integer problem) is <math>M_{int}</math>, and the relaxed minimum (the minimum of the linear programming relaxation) is <math>M_{frac}</math>, then the integrality gap of that instance is <math>IG=\\frac{M_{int}}{M_{frac}}</math>. In a maximization problem the fraction is reversed. The integrality gap is always at least 1. In [[#Example|the example above]], the instance ''F'' = {{''a'', ''b''}, {''b'', ''c''}, {''a'', ''c''}} shows an integrality gap of 4/3.\n\nTypically, the integrality gap translates into the [[approximation ratio]] of an approximation algorithm. This is because an approximation algorithm relies on some rounding strategy that finds, for every relaxed solution of size <math>M_{frac}</math>, an integer solution of size at most <math>RR\\cdot M_{frac}</math> (where ''RR'' is the rounding ratio). If there is an instance with integrality gap ''IG'', then ''every'' rounding strategy will return, on that instance, a rounded solution of size at least <math>M_{int} = IG\\cdot M_{frac}</math>. Therefore necessarily <math>RR \\geq IG</math>. The rounding ratio ''RR'' is only an upper bound on the approximation ratio, so in theory the actual approximation ratio may be lower than ''IG'', but this may be hard to prove. In practice, a large ''IG'' usually implies that the approximation ratio in the linear programming relaxation might be bad, and it may be better to look for other approximation schemes for that problem.\n\nFor the set cover problem, Lovász proved that the integrality gap for an instance with ''n'' elements is ''H<sub>n</sub>'', the ''n''th [[harmonic number]]. One can turn the linear programming relaxation for this problem into an approximate solution of the original unrelaxed set cover instance via the technique of [[randomized rounding]] {{harv|Raghavan|Tompson|1987}}. Given a fractional cover, in which each set ''S<sub>i</sub>'' has weight ''w<sub>i</sub>'', choose randomly the value of each 0-1 indicator variable ''x<sub>i</sub>'' to be 1 with probability ''w<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;&times;(ln&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+1), and 0 otherwise. Then any element ''e<sub>j</sub>'' has probability less than 1/(''e''&times;''n'') of remaining uncovered, so with constant probability all elements are covered. The cover generated by this technique has total size, with high probability, (1+o(1))(ln&nbsp;''n'')''W'', where ''W'' is the total weight of the fractional solution. Thus, this technique leads to a [[Randomized algorithm|randomized]] approximation algorithm that finds a set cover within a logarithmic factor of the optimum. As {{harvtxt|Young|1995}} showed, both the random part of this algorithm and the need to construct an explicit solution to the linear programming relaxation may be eliminated using the [[method of conditional probabilities]], leading to a deterministic [[greedy algorithm]] for set cover, known already to Lovász, that repeatedly selects the set that covers the largest possible number of remaining uncovered elements. This greedy algorithm approximates the set cover to within the same ''H<sub>n</sub>'' factor that Lovász proved as the integrality gap for set cover. There are strong complexity-theoretic reasons for believing that no polynomial time approximation algorithm can achieve a significantly better approximation ratio {{harv|Feige|1998}}.\n\nSimilar [[randomized rounding]] techniques, and derandomized approximation algorithms, may be used in conjunction with linear programming relaxation to develop approximation algorithms for many other problems, as described by Raghavan, Tompson, and Young.\n\n==Branch and bound for exact solutions==\nAs well as its uses in approximation, linear programming plays an important role in [[branch and bound]] algorithms for computing the true optimum solution to hard optimization problems.\n\nIf some variables in the optimal solution have fractional values, we may start a [[branch and bound]] type process, in which we recursively solve subproblems in which some of the fractional variables have their values fixed to either zero or one. In each step of an algorithm of this type, we consider a subproblem of the original 0-1 integer program in which some of the variables have values assigned to them, either 0 or 1, and the remaining variables are still free to take on either value. In subproblem ''i'', let ''V<sub>i</sub>'' denote the set of remaining variables. The process begins by considering a subproblem in which no variable values have been assigned, and in which ''V<sub>0</sub>'' is the whole set of variables of the original problem. Then, for each subproblem ''i'', it performs the following steps.\n# Compute the optimal solution to the linear programming relaxation of the current subproblem. That is, for each variable ''x<sub>j</sub>'' in ''V<sub>i</sub>'', we replace the constraint that ''x<sub>j</sub>'' be 0 or 1 by the relaxed constraint that it be in the interval [0,1]; however, variables that have already been assigned values are not relaxed.\n# If the current subproblem's relaxed solution is worse than the best integer solution found so far, backtrack from this branch of the recursive search.\n# If the relaxed solution has all variables set to 0 or 1, test it against the best integer solution found so far and keep whichever of the two solutions is best.\n# Otherwise, let ''x<sub>j</sub>'' be any variable that is set to a fractional value in the relaxed solution. Form two subproblems, one in which ''x<sub>j</sub>'' is set to 0 and the other in which ''x<sub>j</sub>'' is set to 1; in both subproblems, the existing assignments of values to some of the variables are still used, so the set of remaining variables becomes ''V<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{''x<sub>j</sub>''}. Recursively search both subproblems.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to prove theoretical bounds on the performance of algorithms of this type, they can be very effective in practice.\n\n==Cutting plane method==\nTwo 0-1 integer programs that are equivalent, in that they have the same objective function and the same set of feasible solutions, may have quite different linear programming relaxations: a linear programming relaxation can be viewed geometrically, as a [[convex polytope]] that includes all feasible solutions and excludes all other 0-1 vectors, and infinitely many different polytopes have this property. Ideally, one would like to use as a relaxation the [[convex hull]] of the feasible solutions; linear programming on this polytope would automatically yield the correct solution to the original integer program. However, in general, this polytope will have exponentially many [[Facet (mathematics)|facet]]s and be difficult to construct. Typical relaxations, such as the relaxation of the set cover problem discussed earlier, form a polytope that strictly contains the convex hull and has vertices other than the 0-1 vectors that solve the unrelaxed problem.\n\nThe [[cutting-plane method]] for solving 0-1 integer programs, first introduced for the [[traveling salesman problem]] by {{harvtxt|Dantzig|Fulkerson|Johnson|1954}} and generalized to other integer programs by {{harvtxt|Gomory|1958}}, takes advantage of this multiplicity of possible relaxations by finding a sequence of relaxations that more tightly constrain the solution space until eventually an integer solution is obtained. This method starts from any relaxation of the given program, and finds an optimal solution using a linear programming solver. If the solution assigns integer values to all variables, it is also the optimal solution to the unrelaxed problem. Otherwise, an additional linear constraint (a ''cutting plane'' or ''cut'') is found that separates the resulting fractional solution from the convex hull of the integer solutions, and the method repeats on this new more tightly constrained problem.\n\nProblem-specific methods are needed to find the cuts used by this method. It is especially desirable to find cutting planes that form facets of the convex hull of the integer solutions, as these planes are the ones that most tightly constrain the solution space; there always exists a cutting plane of this type that separates any fractional solution from the integer solutions. Much research has been performed on methods for finding these facets for different types of combinatorial optimization problems, under the framework of [[polyhedral combinatorics]] {{harv|Aardal|Weismantel|1997}}.\n\nThe related [[branch and cut]] method combines the cutting plane and branch and bound methods.

      "text": "In the study of [[algorithm]]s, an '''LP-type problem''' (also called a '''generalized linear program''') is an [[optimization problem]] that shares certain properties with low-dimensional [[linear program]]s and that may be solved by similar algorithms. LP-type problems include many important optimization problems that are not themselves linear programs, such as the problem of finding the [[Smallest circle problem|smallest circle]] containing a given set of planar points. They may be solved by a combination of [[randomized algorithm]]s in an amount of time that is [[linear time|linear]] in the number of elements defining the problem, and subexponential in the dimension of the problem.\n\n==Definition==\nLP-type problems were defined by {{harvtxt|Sharir|Welzl|1992}} as problems in which one is given as input a finite set {{mvar|S}} of elements, and a function {{mvar|f}} that maps subsets of {{mvar|S}} to values from a totally ordered set. The function is required to satisfy two key properties:\n*Monotonicity: for every two sets {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⊆ ''S''}}, ''f''(''A'') ≤ ''f''(''B'') ≤ ''f''(''S'').\n*Locality: for every two sets {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⊆ ''S''}} and every element {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|S}}, if {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = ''f''(''B'') = ''f''(''A'' ∪ {''x''})}}, then {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = ''f''(''B'' ∪ {''x''})}}.\n\nA ''basis'' of an LP-type problem is a set {{math|''B'' ⊆ ''S''}} with the property that every proper subset of {{mvar|B}} has a smaller value of {{mvar|f}} than {{mvar|B}} itself, and the ''dimension'' (or ''combinatorial dimension'') of an LP-type problem is defined to be the maximum [[cardinality]] of a basis.\n\nIt is assumed that an optimization algorithm may evaluate the function {{mvar|f}} only on sets that are themselves bases or that are formed by adding a single element to a basis. Alternatively, the algorithm may be restricted to two primitive operations: a ''violation test'' that determines, for a basis {{mvar|B}} and an element {{mvar|x}} whether {{math|1=''f''(''B'') = ''f''(''B'' ∪ {''x''})}}, and a ''basis computation'' that (with the same inputs) finds a basis of {{math|''B'' ∪ {''x''}}}. The task for the algorithm to perform is to evaluate {{math|''f''(''S'')}} by only using these restricted evaluations or primitives.\n\n==Examples and applications==\nA [[linear program]] may be defined by a system of {{mvar|d}} non-negative [[Function of a real variable|real variables]], subject to {{mvar|n}} linear inequality constraints, together with a non-negative linear objective function to be minimized. This may be placed into the framework of LP-type problems by letting {{mvar|S}} be the set of constraints, and defining {{math|''f''(''A'')}} (for a subset {{mvar|A}} of the constraints) to be the minimum objective function value of the smaller linear program defined by {{mvar|A}}. With suitable general position assumptions (in order to prevent multiple solution points having the same optimal objective function value), this satisfies the monotonicity and locality requirements of an LP-type problem, and has combinatorial dimension equal to the number {{mvar|d}} of variables.<ref name=\"msw96\">{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}.</ref> Similarly, an [[integer program]] (consisting of a collection of linear constraints and a linear objective function, as in a linear program, but with the additional restriction that the variables must take on only integer values) satisfies both the monotonicity and locality properties of an LP-type problem, with the same general position assumptions as for linear programs. Theorems of {{harvtxt|Bell|1977}} and {{harvtxt|Scarf|1977}} show that, for an integer program with {{mvar|d}} variables, the combinatorial dimension is at most&nbsp;{{math|2<sup>''d''</sup>}}.<ref name=\"msw96\"/>\n\nMany natural optimization problems in [[computational geometry]] are LP-type:\n[[Image:Smallest circle problem.svg|thumb|240px|Smallest circle problem]]\n*The [[smallest circle problem]] is the problem of finding the minimum radius of a circle containing a given set of {{mvar|n}} points in the plane. It satisfies monotonicity (adding more points can only make the circle larger) and locality (if the smallest circle for set {{mvar|A}} contains {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|x}}, then the same circle also contains {{math|''B'' ∪ {''x''}}}). Because the smallest circle is always determined by some three points, the smallest circle problem has combinatorial dimension three, even though it is defined using two-dimensional Euclidean geometry.<ref>Although the smallest circle problem was first stated to be an LP-type problem by {{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}, several earlier papers described algorithms for this problem based on ideas from low-dimensional linear programming, including {{harvtxt|Megiddo|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Welzl|1991}}.</ref> More generally, the smallest enclosing ball of points in {{mvar|d}} dimensions forms an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension {{math|''d'' + 1}}. The smallest circle problem can be generalized to the smallest ball enclosing a set of balls,<ref>{{harvtxt|Fischer|Gärtner|2004}}.</ref> to the smallest ball that touches or surrounds each of a set of balls,<ref>{{harvtxt|Löffler|van Kreveld|2010}}.</ref> to the weighted [[1-center problem]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Dyer|1986}}.</ref> or to similar smaller enclosing ball problems in non-Euclidean spaces such as the space with distances defined by [[Bregman divergence]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Nielsen|Nock|2008}}.</ref> The related problem of finding the smallest enclosing [[ellipsoid]] is also an LP-type problem, but with a larger combinatorial dimension, {{math|''d''(''d'' + 3)/2}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Welzl|1991}}.</ref>\n*Let {{math|''K''<sub>0</sub>, ''K''<sub>1</sub>, ...}} be a sequence of {{mvar|n}} [[convex set]]s in {{mvar|d}}-dimensional Euclidean space, and suppose that we wish to find the longest [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of this sequence that has a common intersection point. This may be expressed as an LP-type problem in which {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = &minus;''i''}} where ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> is the first member of ''A'' that does not belong to an intersecting prefix of ''A'', and where {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = &minus;''n''}} if there is no such member. The combinatorial dimension of this system is {{math|''d'' + 1}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}.</ref>\n*Suppose we are given a collection of axis-aligned rectangular boxes in three-dimensional space, and wish to find a line directed into the positive octant of space that cuts through all the boxes. This may be expressed as an LP-type problem with combinatorial dimension 4.<ref>{{harvtxt|Amenta|1994}}.</ref>\n*The problem of finding the closest distance between two [[convex polytope]]s, specified by their sets of vertices, may be represented as an LP-type problem. In this formulation, the set {{mvar|S}} is the set of all vertices in both polytopes, and the function value {{math|''f''(''A'')}} is the negation of the smallest distance between the [[convex hull]]s of the two subsets {{mvar|''A''}} of vertices in the two polytopes. The combinatorial dimension of the problem is {{math|''d'' + 1}} if the two polytopes are disjoint, or {{math|''d'' + 2}} if they have a nonempty intersection.<ref name=\"msw96\"/>\n*Let {{math|1=''S'' = {''f''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''<sub>1</sub>, ...}}} be a set of [[quasiconvex function]]s. Then the pointwise maximum {{math|max<sub>''i''</sub> ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is itself quasiconvex, and the problem of finding the minimum value of {{math|max<sub>''i''</sub> ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is an LP-type problem. It has combinatorial dimension at most {{math|2''d'' + 1}}, where {{mvar|d}} is the dimension of the domain of the functions, but for sufficiently smooth functions the combinatorial dimension is smaller, at most {{math|''d'' + 1}}. Many other LP-type problems can also be expressed using quasiconvex functions in this way; for instance, the smallest enclosing circle problem is the problem of minimizing {{math|max<sub>''i''</sub> ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} where each of the functions {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} measures the Euclidean distance from one of the given points.<ref>{{harvtxt|Amenta|Bern|Eppstein|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Eppstein|2005}}.</ref>\n\nLP-type problems have also been used to determine the optimal outcomes of certain games in [[algorithmic game theory]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Halman|2007}}.</ref> improve vertex placement in [[finite element method]] meshes,<ref>{{harvtxt|Amenta|Bern|Eppstein|1999}}.</ref> solve [[facility location]] problems,<ref>{{harvtxt|Puerto|Rodríguez-Chía|Tamir|2010}}.</ref> analyze the time complexity of certain exponential-time search algorithms,<ref>{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2006}}.</ref> and reconstruct the three-dimensional positions of objects from their two-dimensional images.<ref>{{harvtxt|Li|2007}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Seidel===\n{{harvtxt|Seidel|1991}} gave an algorithm for low-dimensional linear programming that may be adapted to the LP-type problem framework. Seidel's algorithm takes as input the set {{mvar|S}} and a separate set {{mvar|X}} (initially empty) of elements known to belong to the optimal basis. It then considers the remaining elements one-by-one in a random order, performing violation tests for each one and, depending on the result, performing a recursive call to the same algorithm with a larger set of known basis elements. It may be expressed with the following pseudocode:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">def seidel(S,f,X):\n    R = empty set\n    B = X\n    for x in a random permutation of S:\n        if f(B) ≠ f(B ∪ {x}):\n            B = seidel(R,f, basis(X ∪ {x}))\n        R = R ∪ {x}\n    return B</source>\n\nIn a problem with combinatorial dimension {{mvar|d}}, the violation test in the {{mvar|i}}th iteration of the algorithm fails only when {{mvar|x}} is one of the {{math|''d'' &minus; {{mabs|''X''}} }} remaining basis elements, which happens with probability at most {{math|(''d'' &minus; {{mabs|''X''}})/''i''}}. Based on this calculation, it can be shown that overall the expected number of violation tests performed by the algorithm is {{math|O(''d''! n)}}, linear in {{mvar|n}} but worse than exponential in {{mvar|d}}.\n\n===Clarkson===\n{{harvtxt|Clarkson|1995}} defines two algorithms, a recursive algorithm and an iterative algorithm, for linear programming based on random sampling techniques, and suggests a combination of the two that calls the iterative algorithm from the recursive algorithm. The recursive algorithm repeatedly chooses random samples whose size is approximately the square root of the input size, solves the sampled problem recursively, and then uses violation tests to find a subset of the remaining elements that must include at least one basis element:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">def recursive(S,f):\n    X = empty set\n    repeat:\n        R = a random subset of S with size d√n\n        B = basis for R ∪ X, computed recursively\n        V = {x | f(B) ≠ f(B ∪ {x})}\n        X = X ∪ V\n    until V is empty\n    return B</source>\n\nIn each iteration, the expected size of {{mvar|V}} is {{math|O({{radic|''n''}})}},<ref>Tail bounds on the size of {{mvar|V}} are also known: see {{harvtxt|Gärtner|Welzl|2001}}.</ref> and whenever {{mvar|V}} is nonempty it includes at least one new element of the eventual basis of {{mvar|S}}. Therefore, the algorithm performs at most {{mvar|d}} iterations, each of which performs {{mvar|n}} violation tests and makes a single recursive call to a subproblem of size {{math|O(''d''{{radic|''n''}})}}.\n\nClarkson's iterative algorithm assigns weights to each element of {{mvar|S}}, initially all of them equal. It then chooses a set {{mvar|R}} of {{math|9''d''<sup>2</sup>}} elements from {{mvar|S}} at random, and computes the sets {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|V}} as in the previous algorithm. If the total weight of {{mvar|V}} is at most {{math|2/(9''d'' &minus; 1)}} times the total weight of {{mvar|S}} (as happens with constant probability) then the algorithm doubles the weights of every element of {{mvar|V}}, and as before it repeats this process until {{mvar|V}} becomes empty. In each iteration, the weight of the optimal basis can be shown to increase at a greater rate than the total weight of {{mvar|S}}, from which it follows that the algorithm must terminate within {{math|O(log ''n'')}} iterations.\n\nBy using the recursive algorithm to solve a given problem, switching to the iterative algorithm for its recursive calls, and then switching again to Seidel's algorithm for the calls made by the iterative algorithm, it is possible solve a given LP-type problem using {{math|O(''dn'' + ''d''! ''d''<sup>O(1)</sup> log ''n'')}} violation tests.\n\nWhen applied to a linear program, this algorithm can be interpreted as being a dual [[simplex method]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kalai|1992}}.</ref> With certain additional computational primitives beyond the violation test and basis computation primitives, this method can be made deterministic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chazelle|Matoušek|1996}}.</ref>\n\n===Matoušek, Sharir, and Welzl===\n{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}} describe an algorithm that uses an additional property of linear programs that is not always held by other LP-type problems, that all bases have the same cardinality of each other. If an LP-type problem does not have this property, it can be made to have it by adding {{math|''d''}} new dummy elements and by modifying the function {{mvar|f}} to return the [[ordered pair]] of its old value {{math|''f''(''A'')}} and of the number {{math|min(''d'',{{!}}''A''{{!}})}}, ordered [[lexicographic order|lexicographically]].\n\nRather than adding elements of ''S'' one at a time, or finding samples of the elements, {{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}} describe an algorithm that removes elements one at a time. At each step it maintains a basis {{mvar|C}} that may initially be the set of dummy elements. It may be described with the following pseudocode:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">def msw(S,f,C):\n    if S = C:\n        return C\n    choose a random element x of S \\ C\n    B = msw(S \\ x, f, C)\n    if f(B) ≠ f(B ∪ {x}):\n        B = basis(B ∪ {x})\n        B = msw(S, f, B)\n    return B</source>\n\nIn most of the recursive calls of the algorithm, the violation test succeeds and the if statement is skipped. However, with a small probability the violation test fails and the algorithm makes an additional basis computation and then an additional recursive call. As the authors show, the expected time for the algorithm is linear in ''n'' and exponential in the square root of {{math|''d'' log ''n''}}. By combining this method with Clarkson's recursive and iterative procedures, these two forms of time dependence can be separated out from each other, resulting in an algorithm that performs O(''dn'') violation tests in the outer recursive algorithm and a number that is exponential in the square root of {{math|''d'' log ''d''}} in the lower levels of the algorithm.<ref>{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}. A very similar time bound for linear programming was also given by {{harvtxt|Kalai|1992}}.</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Optimization with outliers===\n{{harvtxt|Matoušek|1995}} considers a variation of LP-type optimization problems in which one is given, together with the set {{mvar|S}} and the objective function {{mvar|f}}, a number {{mvar|k}}; the task is to remove {{mvar|k}} elements from {{mvar|S}} in order to make the objective function on the remaining set as small as possible. For instance, when applied to the smallest circle problem, this would give the smallest circle that contains all but {{mvar|k}} of a given set of planar points. He shows that, for all non-degenerate LP-type problems (that is, problems in which all bases have distinct values) this problem may be solved in time {{math|O(''nk''<sup>''d''</sup>)}}, by solving a set of {{math|O(''k''<sup>''d''</sup>)}} LP-type problems defined by subsets of {{mvar|S}}.\n\n===Implicit problems===\nSome geometric optimization problems may be expressed as LP-type problems in which the number of elements in the LP-type formulation is significantly greater than the number of input data values for the optimization problem. As an example, consider a collection of {{mvar|n}} points in the plane, each moving with constant velocity. At any point in time, the [[diameter]] of this system is the maximum distance between two of its points. The problem of finding a time at which the diameter is minimized can be formulated as minimizing the pointwise maximum of {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}} quasiconvex functions, one for each pair of points, measuring the Euclidean distance between the pair as a function of time. Thus, it can be solved as an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension two on a set of {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}} elements, but this set is significantly larger than the number of input points.<ref>The LP-type formulation of this problem was given by {{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}, but it was studied earlier using other algorithmic methods by {{harvtxt|Gupta|Janardan|Smid|1996}}. Chan also cites an unpublished manuscript by Clarkson for an {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}} time algorithm, matching the time that can be achieved by the implicit LP-type approach.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}} describes an algorithm for solving implicitly defined LP-type problems such as this one in which each LP-type element is determined by a {{mvar|k}}-tuple of input values, for some constant {{mvar|k}}. In order to apply his approach, there must exist a ''decision algorithm'' that can determine, for a given LP-type basis {{mvar|B}} and set {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|n}} input values, whether {{mvar|B}} is a basis for the LP-type problem determined by {{mvar|S}}.\n\nChan's algorithm performs the following steps:\n*If the number of input values is below some threshold value, find the set of LP-type elements that it determines and solve the resulting explicit LP-type problem.\n*Otherwise, partition the input values into a suitable number greater than {{mvar|k}} of equal-sized subsets {{math|''S<sub>i</sub>''}}.\n*If {{mvar|f}} is the objective function for the implicitly defined LP-type problem to be solved, then define a function {{mvar|g}} that maps collections of subsets {{math|''S<sub>i</sub>''}} to the value of {{mvar|f}} on the union of the collection. Then the collection of subsets {{math|''S<sub>i</sub>''}} and the objective function {{mvar|g}} itself defines an LP-type problem, of the same dimension as the implicit problem to be solved.\n*Solve the (explicit) LP-type problem defined by {{mvar|g}} using Clarkson's algorithm, which performs a linear number of violation tests and a polylogarithmic number of basis evaluations. The basis evaluations for {{mvar|g}} may be performed by recursive calls to Chan's algorithm, and the violation tests may be performed by calls to the decision algorithm.\n\nWith the assumption that the decision algorithm takes an amount of time {{math|O(''T''(''n''))}} that grows at least polynomially as a function of the input size {{mvar|n}}, Chan shows that the threshold for switching to an explicit LP formulation and the number of subsets in the partition can be chosen in such a way that the implicit LP-type optimization algorithm also runs in time {{math|O(''T''(''n''))}}.\n\nFor instance, for the minimum diameter of moving points, the decision algorithm needs only to calculate the diameter of a set of points at a fixed time, a problem that can be solved in {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}} time using the [[rotating calipers]] technique. Therefore, Chan's algorithm for finding the time at which the diameter is minimized also takes time {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}}.\nChan uses this method to find a point of maximal [[Centerpoint (geometry)|Tukey depth]] among a given collection of {{mvar|n}} points in {{mvar|d}}-dimensional Euclidean space, in time {{math|O(''n''<sup>''d'' &minus; 1</sup> + ''n'' log ''n'')}}. A similar technique was used by {{harvtxt|Braß|Heinrich-Litan|Morin|2003}} to find a point of maximal Tukey depth for the uniform distribution on a convex polygon.\n\n==History and related problems==\nThe discovery of linear time algorithms for linear programming and the observation that the same algorithms could in many cases be used to solve geometric optimization problems that were not linear programs goes back at least to {{harvs|last=Megiddo|year=1983|year2=1984|txt}}, who gave a linear expected time algorithm for both three-variable linear programs and the smallest circle problem. However, Megiddo formulated the generalization of linear programming geometrically rather than combinatorially, as a [[convex optimization]] problem rather than as an abstract problem on systems of sets. Similarly, {{harvtxt|Dyer|1986}} and Clarkson (in the 1988 conference version of {{harvnb|Clarkson|1995}}) observed that their methods could be applied to convex programs as well as linear programs. {{harvtxt|Dyer|1992}} showed that the minimum enclosing ellipsoid problem could also be formulated as a convex optimization problem by adding a small number of non-linear constraints.  The use of randomization to improve the time bounds for low dimensional linear programming and related problems was pioneered by Clarkson and by {{harvtxt|Dyer|Frieze|1989}}.\n\nThe definition of LP-type problems in terms of functions satisfying the axioms of locality and monotonicity is from {{harvtxt|Sharir|Welzl|1992}}, but other authors in the same timeframe formulated alternative combinatorial generalizations of linear programs. For instance, in a framework developed by {{harvtxt|Gärtner|1995}}, the function {{mvar|f}} is replaced by a total ordering on the subsets of {{mvar|S}}. It is possible to break the ties in an LP-type problem to create a total order, but only at the expense of an increase in the combinatorial dimension.<ref>{{harvtxt|Matoušek|2009}}.</ref>\nAdditionally, as in LP-type problems, Gärtner defines certain primitives for performing computations on subsets of elements; however, his formalization does not have an analogue of the combinatorial dimension.\n\nAnother abstract generalization of both linear programs and [[linear complementarity problem]]s, formulated by {{harvtxt|Stickney|Watson|1978}} and later studied by several other authors, concerns orientations of the edges of a [[hypercube]] with the property that every face of the hypercube (including the whole hypercube as a face) has a [[unique sink orientation|unique sink]], a vertex with no outgoing edges. An orientation of this type may be formed from an LP-type problem by corresponding the subsets of ''S'' with the vertices of a hypercube in such a way that two subsets differ by a single element if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent, and by orienting the edge between neighboring sets {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}} towards {{mvar|B}} if {{math|''f''(''A'') ≠ ''f''(''B'')}} and towards {{mvar|A}} otherwise. The resulting orientation has the additional property that it forms a [[directed acyclic graph]], from which it can be shown that a randomized algorithm can find the unique sink of the whole hypercube (the optimal basis of the LP-type problem) in a number of steps exponential in the square root of&nbsp;{{mvar|n}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Szabó|Welzl|2001}}.</ref>\n\nThe more recently developed framework of [[violator space]]s generalizes LP-type problems, in the sense that every LP-type problem can be modeled by a violator space but not necessarily vice versa. Violator spaces are defined similarly to LP-type problems, by a function {{mvar|f}} that maps sets to objective function values, but the values of {{mvar|f}} are not ordered. Despite the lack of ordering, every set {{mvar|S}} has a well-defined set of bases (the minimal sets with the same value as the whole set) that can be found by variations of Clarkson's algorithms for LP-type problems. Indeed, violator spaces have been shown to exactly characterize the systems that can be solved by Clarkson's algorithms.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gärtner|Matoušek|Rüst|Škovroň|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Brise|Gärtner|2011}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{citation\n | last = Amenta | first = Nina | authorlink = Nina Amenta\n | doi = 10.1007/BF02574379\n | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]\n | mr = 1298910\n | pages = 241–261\n | title = Helly-type theorems and generalized linear programming\n | url = http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/pubs/helly.pdf\n | volume = 12\n | year = 1994}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Amenta | first1 = Nina | author1-link = Nina Amenta\n | last2 = Bern | first2 = Marshall\n | last3 = Eppstein | first3 = David | author3-link = David Eppstein\n | arxiv = cs.CG/9809081\n | doi = 10.1006/jagm.1998.0984\n | issue = 2\n | journal = Journal of Algorithms\n | mr = 1671836\n | pages = 302–322\n | title = Optimal point placement for mesh smoothing\n | volume = 30\n | year = 1999}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Bell | first = David E.\n | issue = 2\n | journal = Studies in Applied Mathematics\n | mr = 0462617\n | pages = 187–188\n | title = A theorem concerning the integer lattice\n | url = http://www.people.hbs.edu/dbell/theorem%20on%20integer%20lattice.pdf\n | volume = 56\n | year = 1977}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Braß | first1 = Peter\n | last2 = Heinrich-Litan | first2 = Laura\n | last3 = Morin | first3 = Pat\n | doi = 10.1142/S021819590300127X\n | issue = 5\n | journal = International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications\n | mr = 2012837\n | pages = 439–445\n | title = Computing the center of area of a convex polygon\n | url = http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/publications/facility/center-ijcga.pdf\n | volume = 13\n | year = 2003}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Brise | first1 = Yves\n | last2 = Gärtner | first2 = Bernd\n | arxiv = 0906.4706\n | doi = 10.1016/j.comgeo.2010.09.003\n | issue = 2\n | journal = [[Computational Geometry (journal)|Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications]]\n | mr = 2737285\n | pages = 70–81\n | title = Clarkson's algorithm for violator spaces\n | url = http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/ybrise/data/papers/VS.pdf\n | volume = 44\n | year = 2011}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Chan | first = Timothy M. | author-link = Timothy M.

      "text": "'''MPS''' (Mathematical Programming System) is a file format for presenting and archiving [[linear programming]] (LP) and [[mixed integer programming]] problems.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]\n\nThe format was named after an early [[IBM]] LP product<ref>{{Citation | title=Optimization Subroutine Library, Guide and Reference, document SC23-0519 | publisher=IBM|author=IBM|url=http://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/ekkosl01/CCONTENTS?wirelessshow=1}}</ref> and has emerged as a de facto standard [[ASCII]] medium among most of the commercial LP solvers. Essentially all commercial LP solvers accept this format, and it is also accepted by the open-source [[COIN-OR]] system.  Other software may require a customized reader routine in order to read MPS files. However, with the acceptance of [[algebraic modeling language]]s MPS usage has declined. For example, according to the [[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] server statistics in January 2011 less than 1% of submissions were in MPS form compared to 59.4% of [[AMPL]] and 29.7% of [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] submissions.\n\nMPS is column-oriented (as opposed to entering the model as equations), and all model components (variables, rows, etc.) receive names. MPS is an old format, so it is set up for punch cards: Fields start in column 2, 5, 15, 25, 40 and 50. Sections of an MPS file are marked by so-called header cards, which are distinguished by their starting in column 1. Although it is typical to use upper-case throughout the file for historical reasons, many MPS-readers will accept mixed-case for anything except the header cards, and some allow mixed-case anywhere. The names that you choose for the individual entities (constraints or variables) are not important to the solver; one should pick meaningful names, or easy names for a post-processing code to read.\n\n== MPS format ==\nHere is a little sample model written in MPS format (explained in more detail below):\n\n NAME          TESTPROB\n ROWS\n  N  COST\n  L  LIM1\n  G  LIM2\n  E  MYEQN\n COLUMNS\n     XONE      COST                 1   LIM1                 1\n     XONE      LIM2                 1\n     YTWO      COST                 4   LIM1                 1\n     YTWO      MYEQN               -1\n     ZTHREE    COST                 9   LIM2                 1\n     ZTHREE    MYEQN                1\n RHS\n     RHS1      LIM1                 5   LIM2                10\n     RHS1      MYEQN                7\n BOUNDS\n  UP BND1      XONE                 4\n  LO BND1      YTWO                -1\n  UP BND1      YTWO                 1\n ENDATA\n\nFor comparison, here is the same model written out in an equation-oriented format:\n\n Optimize\n  COST:    XONE + 4*YTWO + 9*ZTHREE\n Subject To\n  LIM1:    XONE + YTWO          <= 5\n  LIM2:    XONE        + ZTHREE >= 10\n  MYEQN:        - YTWO + ZTHREE  = 7\n Bounds\n        XONE <= 4\n  -1 <= YTWO <= 1\n End\n\nAs mentioned below, the lower bound on XONE is either zero or -infinity, depending upon implementation, because it is not specified.  Strangely, nothing in MPS format specifies the direction of optimization, and there is no standard \"default\" direction; some LP solvers will maximize if not instructed otherwise, others will minimize,<ref>{{cite manual|url=http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/courses/567/cplex/reffileformatscplex.pdf|page=28|title=ILOG CPLEX 10.0 File Formats| date=January 2006 |work=ILOG}}</ref> and still others put safety first and have no default and require a selection somewhere in a control program or by a calling parameter. If the model is formulated for minimization and the solver requires maximization (or vice versa), it is easy to convert between the two by negating all coefficients of the objective function. The optimal value of the objective function will then be the negative of the original optimal value, but the values of the variables themselves will be correct.  Some programs support specifying minimization/maximization within the MPS file.\n OBJSENSE\n  MAX\n\n== Variables ==\nThe NAME record can have any value, starting in column 15.\n\nThe ROWS section defines the names of all the constraints; entries in column 2 or 3 are E for equality  ( = ) rows, L for less-than ( <= ) rows, G for greater-than ( >= ) rows, and N for non-constraining rows. The order of the rows named in this section is unimportant, except for non-constraining rows market N,  the first of which would be interpreted as the objective function.\n\nThe COLUMNS section contains the entries of the A-matrix. All entries for a given column must be placed consecutively, although within a column the order of the entries (rows) is irrelevant. Rows not mentioned for a column are implied to have a coefficient of zero.\n\nThe RHS section allows one or more right-hand-side vectors to be defined; there is seldom more than one. In the above example, the name of the RHS vector is RHS1, and has non-zero values in all 3 of the constraint rows of the problem. Rows not mentioned in an RHS vector would be assumed to have a right-hand-side of zero.\n\nThe optional BOUNDS section specifies lower and upper bounds on individual variables, if they are not given by rows in the matrix. All the bounds that have a given name in column 5 are taken together as a set. Variables not mentioned in a given BOUNDS set are taken to be non-negative (lower bound zero, no upper bound). A bound of type UP means an upper bound is applied to the variable. A bound of type LO means a lower bound is applied. A bound type of FX (\"fixed\") means that the variable has upper and lower bounds equal to a single value. A bound type of FR (\"free\") means the variable has neither lower nor upper bounds and so can take on negative values.   A variation on that is MI for free negative, giving an upper bound of 0 but no lower bound.  Bound type PL is for a free positive from zero to plus infinity, but as this is the normal default, it is seldom used.  There are also bound types for use in [[mixed integer programming|MIP]]  models – BV for binary, being 0 or 1.  UI for upper integer and LI for lower integer.  SC stands for semi-continuous and indicates that the variable may be zero, but if not must be equal to at least the value given.\n\nAnother optional section called RANGES specifies double-inequalities, in a somewhat counterintuitive way not described here. Ways to mark integer variables are also beyond the scope of this article(keyword MARKER and possibly SOS are involved). The final card must be ENDATA (notice the odd spelling).\n\nA few special cases of the MPS standard are not consistently handled by implementations. In the BOUNDS section, if a variable is given a nonpositive upper bound but no lower bound, its lower bound may default to zero or to minus infinity (also, if the upper bound is given as zero, the lower bound might be zero or negative infinity).<ref>[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cosinfoc/v12r4/index.jsp?topic=%2Filog.odms.cplex.help%2FCPLEX%2FFile_formats_reference%2Ftopics%2FMPS_records.html IBM CPLEX document]</ref> If an integer variable has no upper bound specified, its upper bound may default to one rather than to plus infinity.\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nMPS has many limitations. It does not specify the direction of optimization which is handled differently by solvers. Numeric fields have 12 characters width therefore limiting the precision. The representation is neither easy for human interpretation nor compact (although reserves column / row order information, which is often beneficial for LP solver behaviour reproducibility). One of the alternatives to MPS that does not have its limitations and is supported by most solvers is the [[nl (format)|nl file format]].\n\n== {{anchor|extensions}} Extensions ==\n\nMany LP products include extensions to the MPS format. The free format MPS allows for long names and more accurate data by allowing fields to exceed the columns defined by the original standard, and apply whitespaces as separators instead of fixed column positions (note that this makes some MPS files that included whitespaces as part of names to be no longer valid). Some extensions include adding new kind of data to the MPS file (e.g. sections to include objective sense, integrality requirements, quadratic data or advanced MIP modelling constructs).

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_cost",
      "text": "{{citations missing|date=May 2009}}\n{{Short description|concept in linear programming and mathematical optimization}}\n\nIn [[linear programming]], '''reduced cost''', or '''opportunity cost''', is the amount by which an [[objective function]] coefficient would have to improve (so increase for maximization problem, decrease for minimization problem) before it would be possible for a corresponding variable to assume a positive value in the optimal solution. It is the cost for increasing a variable by a small amount, i.e., the first derivative from a certain point on the [[polyhedron]] that constrains the problem. When the point is a vertex in the polyhedron, the variable with the most extreme cost, negatively for minimization and positively maximization, is sometimes referred to as the '''steepest edge'''. \n\nGiven a system minimize <math>\\mathbf{c}^T\\mathbf{x}</math> subject to <math>\\mathbf{Ax}\\leq\\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{x}\\geq 0</math>, the reduced cost vector can be computed as <math>\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{y}</math>, where <math>\\mathbf{y}</math> is the dual cost vector.\n\nIt follows directly that for a minimization problem, any non-[[basic variable]]s at their lower bounds with strictly negative reduced costs are eligible to enter that basis, while any basic variables must have a reduced cost that is exactly 0. For a maximization problem, the non-basic variables at their lower bounds that are eligible for entering the basis have a strictly positive reduced cost. \n\n== Interpretation ==\nFor the case where x and y are optimal, the reduced costs can help explain why variables attain the value they do. For each variable, the corresponding sum of that stuff gives the reduced cost show which constraints forces the variable up and down. For non-basic variables, the distance to zero gives the minimal change in the object coefficient to change the solution vector x.\n\n== Reduced costs in pivot strategy ==\nIn principle, a good [[pivot strategy]] would be to select whichever variable has the greatest reduced cost. However, the steepest edge might ultimately not be the most attractive, as the edge might be very short, thus affording only a small betterment of the object function value. From a computational view, another problem is that to compute the steepest edge, an inner product must be computed for every variable in the system, making the computational cost too high in many cases. The [[Devex algorithm]] attempts to overcome the latter problem by estimating the reduced costs rather than calculating them at every pivot step, exploiting that a pivot step might not alter the reduced costs of all variables dramatically.\n\n== Reduced Cost in Linear Programming ==\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courses.psu.edu/for/for466w_mem14/Ch11/HTML/Sec4/ch11sec4_RC.htm |title=Interpreting LP Solutions - Reduced Cost |publisher=Courses.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08}}</ref>\nAssociated with each variable is a reduced cost value. However, the reduced cost value is only non-zero when the optimal value of a variable is zero. A somewhat intuitive way to think about the reduced cost variable is to think of it as indicating how much the cost of the activity represented by the variable must be reduced before any of that activity will be done. More precisely,\n\n... the reduced cost value indicates how much the objective function coefficient on the corresponding variable must be improved before the value of the variable will be positive in the optimal solution.\n\nIn the case of a minimization problem, \"improved\" means \"reduced\". So, in the case of a cost-minimization problem, where the objective function coefficients represent the per-unit cost of the activities represented by the variables, the \"reduced cost\" coefficients indicate how much each cost coefficient would have to be reduced before the activity represented by the corresponding variable would be cost-effective. In the case of a maximization problem, \"improved\" means \"increased\". In this case, where, for example, the objective function coefficient might represent the net profit per unit of the activity. The reduced cost value indicates how much the profitability of the activity would have to be increased in order for the activity to occur in the optimal solution. The units of the reduced-cost  values are the same as the units of the corresponding objective function coefficients.\n\nIf the optimal value of a variable is positive (not zero), then the reduced cost is always zero. If the optimal value of a variable is zero and the reduced cost corresponding to the variable is also zero, then there is at least one other corner that is also in the optimal solution. The value of this variable will be positive at one of the other optimal corners.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Linear programming]]\n* [[Shadow price]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Linear programming]]"

Many practical problems in [[operations research]] and [[combinatorial optimization]] can be modeled or approximated as semidefinite programming problems. In automatic control theory, SDPs are used in the context of [[linear matrix inequality|linear matrix inequalities]].  SDPs are in fact a special case of [[conic optimization|cone programming]] and can be efficiently solved by [[interior point methods]].\nAll [[linear programming|linear programs]] can be expressed as SDPs, and via hierarchies of SDPs the solutions of polynomial optimization problems can be approximated.  Semidefinite programming has been used in the [[optimization]] of complex systems. In recent years, some quantum query complexity problems have been formulated in terms of semidefinite programs.\n\n== Motivation and definition ==\n\n=== Initial motivation ===\n\nA [[linear programming]] problem is one in which we wish to maximize or minimize a linear objective function of real variables over a [[polytope]]. In semidefinite programming, we instead use real-valued vectors and are allowed to take the dot product of vectors; nonnegativity constraints on real variables in LP (''linear programming'') are replaced by semidefiniteness constraints on matrix variables in SDP (''semidefinite programming''). Specifically, a general semidefinite programming problem can be defined as any mathematical programming problem of the form\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n{\\displaystyle \\min_{x^1, \\ldots, x^n \\in \\mathbb{R}^n}} & {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i,j \\in [n]} c_{i,j} (x^i \\cdot x^j)} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i,j \\in [n]} a_{i,j,k} (x^i \\cdot x^j) \\leq b_k} \\text{  for all }k \\\\\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nwhere the <math>c_{i,j}, a_{i,j,k}</math>, and the <math> b_k </math> are real numbers and <math>x^i \\cdot x^j</math> is the [[dot product]] of <math>x^i</math> and  <math>x^j</math>.\n\n=== Equivalent formulations ===\n\nAn <math>n \\times n</math> matrix <math>M</math> is said to be [[Positive-definite matrix#Positive-semidefinite|positive semidefinite]] if it is the [[Gramian matrix]] of some vectors (i.e. if there exist vectors <math>x^1, \\ldots, x^n</math> such that <math>m_{i,j}=x^i \\cdot x^j</math> for all <math>i,j</math>). If this is the case, we denote this as <math>M \\succeq 0</math>. Note that there are several other equivalent definitions of being positive semidefinite, for example, positive semidefinite matrices are self-adjoint matrices that have only non-negative eigenvalues.\n\nDenote by <math>\\mathbb{S}^n</math> the space of all <math>n \\times n</math> real symmetric matrices.  The space is equipped with the [[Inner product space|inner product]] (where <math>{\\rm tr}</math> denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]])\n<math>\n  \\langle A,B\\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} = {\\rm tr}(A^T B) = \\sum_{i=1,j=1}^n\n  A_{ij}B_{ij}.\n</math>\n\nWe can rewrite the mathematical program given in the previous section equivalently as\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n{\\displaystyle\\min_{X \\in \\mathbb{S}^n}} & \\langle C, X \\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & \\langle A_k, X \\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} \\leq b_k, \\quad k = 1,\\ldots,m \\\\\n& X \\succeq 0\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nwhere entry <math>i,j</math> in <math>C</math> is given by <math>c_{i,j}</math> from the previous section and <math>A_k</math> is an <math>n \\times n</math> matrix having <math>i,j</math>th entry <math>a_{i,j,k}</math> from the previous section.\n\nNote that if we add [[slack variable]]s appropriately, this SDP can be converted to one of the form\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n{\\displaystyle\\min_{X \\in \\mathbb{S}^n}} & \\langle C, X \\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & \\langle A_k, X \\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} = b_k, \\quad k = 1,\\ldots,m \\\\\n& X \\succeq 0.\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nFor convenience, an SDP may be specified in a slightly different, but equivalent form.  For example, linear expressions involving nonnegative [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] variables may be added to the program specification.  This remains an SDP because each variable can be incorporated into the matrix <math>X</math> as a diagonal entry (<math>X_{ii}</math> for some <math>i</math>).  To ensure that <math>X_{ii} \\geq 0</math>, constraints <math>X_{ij} = 0</math> can be added for all <math>j \\neq i</math>.  As another example, note that for any positive semidefinite matrix <math>X</math>, there exists a set of vectors <math>\\{ v_i \\}</math> such that the <math>i</math>, <math>j</math> entry of <math>X</math> is <math>X_{ij} = (v_i, v_j)</math> the [[dot product|scalar product]] of <math>v_i</math> and <math>v_j</math>.  Therefore, SDPs are often formulated in terms of linear expressions on scalar products of vectors.  Given the solution to the SDP in the standard form, the vectors <math>\\{ v_i \\}</math> can be recovered in <math>O(n^3)</math> time (e.g., by using an incomplete [[Cholesky decomposition]] of X).\n\n== Duality theory ==\n\n=== Definitions ===\n\nAnalogously to linear programming, given a general SDP of the form\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n{\\displaystyle\\min_{X \\in \\mathbb{S}^n}} & \\langle C, X \\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & \\langle A_i, X \\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} = b_i, \\quad i = 1,\\ldots,m \\\\\n& X \\succeq 0\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\n(the primal problem or P-SDP), we define the ''[[dual problem|dual]]'' semidefinite program (D-SDP) as\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n{\\displaystyle\\max_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m}} & \\langle b, y \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^m} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & {\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^m} y_i A_i \\preceq C\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nwhere for any two matrices <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math>, <math>P \\succeq Q</math> means <math>P-Q \\succeq 0</math>.\n\n=== Weak duality ===\n\nThe [[weak duality]] theorem states that the value of the primal SDP is at least the value of the dual SDP.  Therefore, any feasible solution to the dual SDP lower-bounds the primal SDP value, and conversely, any feasible solution to the primal SDP upper-bounds the dual SDP value.  This is because\n:<math>\n\\langle C, X \\rangle - \\langle b, y \\rangle\n= \\langle C, X \\rangle - \\sum_{i=1}^m y_i b_i\n= \\langle C, X \\rangle - \\sum_{i=1}^m y_i \\langle A_i, X \\rangle\n= \\langle C - \\sum_{i=1}^m y_i A_i, X \\rangle\n\\geq 0,\n</math>\nwhere the last inequality is because both matrices are positive semidefinite, and the result of this function is sometimes referred to as duality gap.\n\n=== Strong duality ===\n\nUnder a condition known as [[Slater's condition]], the value of the primal and dual SDPs are equal.  This is known as [[strong duality]].  Unlike for [[Linear programming|linear programs]], however, not every SDP satisfies strong duality; in general, the value of the dual SDP may lie strictly below the value of the primal.\n\n(i) Suppose the primal problem (P-SDP) is bounded below and strictly\nfeasible (i.e., there exists\n<math>X_0\\in\\mathbb{S}^n, X_0\\succ 0</math> such that <math>\\langle\nA_i,X_0\\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} = b_i</math>, <math>i=1,\\ldots,m</math>).\nThen there is an optimal solution <math>y^*</math> to (D-SDP) and\n:<math>\\langle C,X^*\\rangle_{\\mathbb{S}^n} = \\langle b,y^*\\rangle_{\\R^m}.</math>\n\n(ii) Suppose the dual problem (D-SDP) is bounded above and strictly\nfeasible (i.e.,\n<math>\\sum_{i=1}^m (y_0)_i A_i\n\\prec C</math> for some <math>y_0\\in\\R^m</math>).\nThen there is an optimal solution <math>X^*</math> to (P-SDP) and\nthe equality from (i) holds.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Example 1 ===\nConsider three random variables <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>C</math>.

Suppose that we know from some prior knowledge (empirical results of an experiment, for example) that <math>-0.2 \\leq \\rho_{AB} \\leq -0.1</math> and <math>0.4 \\leq \\rho_{BC} \\leq 0.5</math>.  The problem of determining the smallest and largest values that <math>\\rho_{AC} \\ </math> can take is given by:\n\n:minimize/maximize <math>x_{13}</math>\n:subject to\n:<math>-0.2 \\leq x_{12} \\leq -0.1</math>\n:<math>0.4 \\leq x_{23} \\leq 0.5</math>\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & x_{12} & x_{13} \\\\\n  x_{12} & 1 & x_{23} \\\\\n  x_{13} & x_{23} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} \\succeq 0.</math>\n\nWe set <math>\\rho_{AB} = x_{12}, \\ \\rho_{AC} = x_{13}, \\ \\rho_{BC} = x_{23} </math> to obtain the answer.  This can be formulated by an SDP.  We handle the inequality constraints by augmenting the variable matrix and introducing [[slack variable]]s, for example\n\n<math>\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n1 & x_{12} & x_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\nx_{12} & 1 & x_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\nx_{13} & x_{23} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & s_{1} & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & s_{2} & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & s_{3}\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=x_{12} + s_{1}=-0.1</math>\n\nSolving this SDP gives the minimum and maximum values of <math>\\rho_{AC} = x_{13} \\ </math> as <math>-0.978</math> and <math> 0.872 </math> respectively.\n\n=== Example 2 ===\n\nConsider the problem\n\n: minimize <math>\\frac{(c^T x)^2}{d^Tx} </math>\n: subject to <math>Ax +b\\geq 0</math>\n\nwhere we assume that <math>d^Tx>0</math> whenever <math>Ax+b\\geq 0</math>.\n\nIntroducing an auxiliary variable <math>t</math> the problem can be reformulated:\n\n: minimize <math>t</math>\n: subject to <math>Ax+b\\geq 0, \\, \\frac{(c^T x)^2}{d^Tx}\\leq t</math>\n\nIn this formulation, the objective is a linear function of the variables <math>x,t</math>.\n\nThe first restriction can be written as\n\n: <math>\\textbf{diag}(Ax+b)\\geq 0</math>\n\nwhere the matrix <math>\\textbf{diag}(Ax+b)</math> is the square matrix with values in the diagonal equal\nto the elements of the vector <math>Ax+b</math>.\n\nThe second restriction can be written as\n\n: <math>td^Tx-(c^Tx)^2\\geq 0</math>\n\nDefining <math>D</math> as follows\n\n: <math>D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}t&c^Tx\\\\c^Tx&d^Tx\\end{array}\\right]</math>\n\nWe can use the theory of Schur Complements to see that\n\n:<math>D \\succeq 0</math>\n(Boyd and Vandenberghe, 1996)\n\nThe semidefinite program associated with this problem is\n\n: minimize <math>t</math>\n: subject to <math>\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\textbf{diag}(Ax+b)&0&0\\\\0&t&c^Tx\\\\0&c^Tx&d^Tx\\end{array}\\right] \\succeq 0</math>\n\n=== Example 3 (Goemans-Williamson MAX CUT approximation algorithm) ===\n\n<!-- this section is linked to from [[Randomized_rounding]], please update that link there if you change the section title here --nealeyoung May 31, 2010 -->\n\nSemidefinite programs are important tools for developing approximation algorithms for NP-hard maximization problems.  The first approximation algorithm based on an SDP is due to [[Michel Goemans]] and [[David P. Williamson]] (JACM, 1995).  They studied the [[Maximum cut|MAX CUT problem]]: Given a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' = (''V'', ''E''), output a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the vertices ''V'' so as to maximize the number of edges crossing from one side to the other.  This problem can be expressed as an [[Quadratic programming|integer quadratic program]]:\n:Maximize <math>\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} \\frac{1-v_{i} v_{j}}{2},</math> such that each <math>v_i\\in\\{1,-1\\}</math>.\n\nUnless [[P = NP]], we cannot solve this maximization problem efficiently.  However, Goemans and Williamson observed a general three-step procedure for attacking this sort of problem:\n# ''Relax'' the integer quadratic program into an SDP.\n# Solve the SDP (to within an arbitrarily small additive error <math>\\epsilon</math>).\n# ''Round'' the SDP solution to obtain an approximate solution to the original integer quadratic program.\nFor MAX CUT, the most natural relaxation is\n:<math>\\max \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} \\frac{1-\\langle v_{i}, v_{j}\\rangle}{2},</math> such that <math>\\lVert v_i\\rVert^2 = 1</math>, where the maximization is over vectors <math>\\{v_i\\}</math> instead of integer scalars.\n\nThis is an SDP because the objective function and constraints are all linear functions of vector inner products.  Solving the SDP gives a set of unit vectors in <math>\\mathbf{R^n}</math>; since the vectors are not required to be collinear, the value of this relaxed program can only be higher than the value of the original quadratic integer program.  Finally, a rounding procedure is needed to obtain a partition.  Goemans and Williamson simply choose a uniformly random hyperplane through the origin and divide the vertices according to which side of the hyperplane the corresponding vectors lie.  Straightforward analysis shows that this procedure achieves an expected ''approximation ratio'' (performance guarantee) of 0.87856 - ε.  (The expected value of the cut is the sum over edges of the probability that the edge is cut, which is proportional to the angle <math>\\cos^{-1}\\langle v_{i}, v_{j}\\rangle</math> between the vectors at the endpoints of the edge over <math>\\pi</math>.  Comparing this probability to <math>(1-\\langle v_{i}, v_{j}\\rangle)/{2}</math>, in expectation the ratio is always at least 0.87856.)  Assuming the [[Unique games conjecture|Unique Games Conjecture]], it can be shown that this approximation ratio is essentially optimal.\n\nSince the original paper of Goemans and Williamson, SDPs have been applied to develop numerous approximation algorithms.  Recently, Prasad Raghavendra has developed a general framework for constraint satisfaction problems based on the [[Unique games conjecture|Unique Games Conjecture]].<ref>Raghavendra, P. 2008.

ACM, New York, NY, 245-254.</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\nThere are several types of algorithms for solving SDPs.  These algorithms output the value of the SDP up to an additive error <math>\\epsilon</math> in time that is polynomial in the program description size and <math>\\log (1/\\epsilon)</math>.\n\n=== Interior point methods ===\nMost codes are based on [[interior point methods]] (CSDP, [[MOSEK]], SeDuMi, SDPT3, DSDP, SDPA). Robust and efficient for general linear SDP problems. Restricted by the fact that the algorithms are second-order methods and need to store and factorize a large (and often dense) matrix.\n\n=== First-order methods ===\nFirst-order methods for [[conic optimization]] avoid computing, storing and factorizing a large Hessian matrix and scale to much larger problems than interior point methods, at some cost in accuracy. A first-order method is implemented in the Splitting Cone Solver (SCS) <ref>Brendan O'Donoghue, Eric Chu,\nNeal Parikh, Stephen Boyd, \"Conic Optimization via Operator Splitting and\nHomogeneous Self-Dual Embedding\",\nJournal of Optimization Theory and Applications,\n2016,\npp 1042--1068,\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/scs.pdf.\n</ref>. Another first-order method is the [[alternating direction method of multipliers]] (ADMM)<ref>Wen, Zaiwen, Donald Goldfarb, and Wotao Yin. \"Alternating direction augmented Lagrangian methods for semidefinite programming.\" Mathematical Programming Computation 2.3-4 (2010): 203-230.</ref>. This method requires in every step projection on the cone of semidefinite matrices.\n\n=== Bundle method ===\nThe code ConicBundle formulates the SDP problem as a [[nonsmooth optimization]] problem and solves it by the Spectral Bundle method of nonsmooth optimization. This approach is very efficient for a special class of linear SDP problems.\n\n=== Other ===\nAlgorithms based on [[Augmented Lagrangian method]] (PENSDP) are similar in behavior to the interior point methods and can be specialized to some very large scale problems. Other algorithms use low-rank information and reformulation of the SDP as a [[nonlinear programming]] problem (SDPLR).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monteiro|first=Renato D.

The result was an annual budget allocated to foods such as [[evaporated milk]], cabbage, dried navy beans, and beef liver at a cost of approximately $0.11 a day in 1939 U.S. dollars.\n\nWhile the name “Stigler Diet” was applied after the experiment by outsiders, according to Stigler, “No one recommends these diets for anyone, let alone everyone.”  The Stigler diet has been much ridiculed for its lack of variety and palatability; however, his methodology has received praise and is considered to be some of the earliest work in [[linear programming]].\n\n== Linear programming problem ==\n\nThe Stigler diet question is a [[linear programming]] problem.  Lacking any sophisticated method of solving such a problem, Stigler was forced to utilize heuristic methods in order to find a solution.  The diet question originally asked in which quantities a 154-pound male would have to consume 77 different foods in order to fulfill the recommended intake of 9 different nutrients while keeping expense at a minimum.  Through \"trial and error, mathematical insight and agility,\" Stigler was able to eliminate 62 of the foods from the original 77 (these foods were removed because they lacked nutrients in comparison to the remaining 15).  From the reduced list, Stigler calculated the required amounts of each of the remaining 15 foods to arrive at a cost-minimizing solution to his question. According to Stigler's calculations, the annual cost of his solution was $39.93 in 1939 dollars.  When corrected for inflation using the [[consumer price index]], the cost of the diet in 2016 dollars is about $690.12<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=39.93&year1=1939&year2=2016|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|website=data.bls.gov|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref> [http://eh.net/hmit].

Every edge has exactly two faces, and every vertex is surrounded by alternating faces and edges. The smallest polyhedron is the [[tetrahedron]] with 4 triangular faces, 6 edges, and 4 vertices. Named polyhedra primarily come from the families of [[platonic solid]]s, [[Archimedean solid]]s, [[Catalan solid]]s, and [[Johnson solid]]s, as well as dihedral symmetry families including the [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[bipyramid]]s, [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprism]]s, and [[trapezohedron]]s.\n\n== Polyhedra by vertex count ==\nNotes: Polyhedra with different names that are topologically identical are listed together.

The word polyhedron comes from the [[Greek language|Classical Greek]] πολύεδρον, as ''poly-'' (stem of πολύς, \"many\") + ''-hedron'' (form of ἕδρα, \"base\" or \"seat\").\n\nA [[convex polyhedron]] is the [[convex hull]] of finitely many points, not all on the same plane.\n[[Cube (geometry)|Cubes]] and [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] are examples of convex polyhedra.\n\nA polyhedron is a 3-dimensional example of the more general [[polytope]] in any number of dimensions.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|A skeletal polyhedron (specifically, a [[rhombicuboctahedron]]) drawn by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to illustrate a book by [[Luca Pacioli]]]]\n[[convex polyhedron|Convex polyhedra]] are well-defined, with several equivalent standard definitions. However, the formal mathematical definition of polyhedra that are not required to be convex has been problematic.\nMany definitions of \"polyhedron\" have been given within particular contexts,<ref name=\"lakatos\">{{citation\n | last = Lakatos | first = Imre | authorlink = Imre Lakatos\n | doi = 10.1017/CBO9781316286425\n | isbn = 978-1-107-53405-6\n | location = Cambridge\n | mr = 3469698\n | orig-year = 1976\n | page = 16\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | quote = definitions are frequently proposed and argued about\n | series = Cambridge Philosophy Classics\n | title = Proofs and Refutations: The logic of mathematical discovery\n | year = 2015| title-link = Proofs and Refutations }}.</ref> some more rigorous than others, and there is not universal agreement over which of these to choose.\nSome of these definitions exclude shapes that have often been counted as polyhedra (such as the [[star polyhedron|self-crossing polyhedra]]) or include\nshapes that are often not considered as valid polyhedra (such as solids whose boundaries are not [[manifold]]s). As [[Branko Grünbaum]] observed,\n{{quote|\"The Original Sin in the theory of polyhedra goes back to Euclid, and through Kepler, Poinsot, Cauchy and many others ... at each stage ... the writers failed to define what are the polyhedra\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1994}}, p.&nbsp;43.</ref>}}\nNevertheless, there is general agreement that a polyhedron is a solid or surface that can be described by its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] (corner points), [[edge (geometry)|edges]] (line segments connecting certain pairs of vertices),\n[[face (geometry)|faces]] (two-dimensional [[polygon]]s), and sometimes by its three-dimensional interior [[volume]].\nOne can distinguish among these different definitions according to whether they describe the polyhedron as a solid, whether they describe it as a surface, or whether they describe it more abstractly based on its [[incidence geometry]].\n* A common and somewhat naive definition of a polyhedron is that it is a solid whose boundary can be covered by finitely many planes<ref>{{citation|title=Solid Geometry|first=Joseph P.|last=McCormack|publisher=D. Appleton-Century Company|year=1931|page=416}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications|last1=de Berg|first1=M.|last2=van Kreveld|first2=M.|last3=Overmars|first3=M.|author3-link=Mark Overmars|last4=Schwarzkopf|first4=O.|author4-link=Otfried Cheong|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer|year=2000|page=64}}.</ref> or that it is a solid formed as the union of finitely many convex polyhedra.<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Polyhedron, abstract|id=Polyhedron,_abstract&oldid=25452|first=S.V.|last=Matveev}}</ref> Natural refinements of this definition require the solid to be bounded, to have a connected interior, and possibly also to have a connected boundary. The faces of such a polyhedron can be defined as the [[Connected component (topology)|connected components]] of the parts of the boundary within each of the planes that cover it, and the edges and vertices as the line segments and points where the faces meet.

These can be defined as [[partially ordered set]]s whose elements are the vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. A vertex or edge element is less than an edge or face element (in this partial order) when the vertex or edge is part of the edge or face. Additionally, one may include a special bottom element of this partial order (representing the empty set) and a top element representing the whole polyhedron. If the sections of the partial order between elements three levels apart (that is, between each face and the bottom element, and between the top element and each vertex) have the same structure as the abstract representation of a polygon, then these partially ordered sets carry exactly the same information as a topological polyhedron. However, these requirements are often relaxed, to instead require only that sections between elements two levels apart have the same structure as the abstract representation of a line segment.<ref name=\"bursta\">{{citation\n | last1 = Burgiel | first1 = H.\n | last2 = Stanton | first2 = D.\n | doi = 10.1007/s004540010030\n | issue = 2–3\n | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]\n | mr = 1758047\n | pages = 241–255\n | title = Realizations of regular abstract polyhedra of types {3,6} and {6,3}\n | volume = 24\n | year = 2000}}.</ref> (This means that each edge contains two vertices and belongs to two faces, and that each vertex on a face belongs to two edges of that face.) Geometric polyhedra, defined in other ways, can be described abstractly in this way, but it is also possible to use abstract polyhedra as the basis of a definition of geometric polyhedra. A ''realization'' of an abstract polyhedron is generally taken to be a mapping from the vertices of the abstract polyhedron to geometric points, such that the points of each face are coplanar. A geometric polyhedron can then be defined as a realization of an abstract polyhedron.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}, pp.&nbsp;468–469.</ref> Realizations that forgo the requirement of planarity, that impose additional requirements of symmetry, or that map the vertices to higher dimensional spaces have also been considered.<ref name=\"bursta\"/> Unlike the solid-based and surface-based definitions, this works perfectly well for star polyhedra. However, without additional restrictions, this definition allows [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] or unfaithful polyhedra (for instance, by mapping all vertices to a single point) and the question of how to constrain realizations to avoid these degeneracies has not been settled.\n\nIn all of these definitions, a polyhedron is typically understood as a three-dimensional example<!-- There are polyhedra in 4-dimensions like the [[regular skew polyhedron]] with flat faces and skew [[vertex figure]]s, and seen as an approximation of the surface of a 4D [[duocylinder]].--> of the more general [[polytope]] in any number of dimensions. For example, a polygon has a two-dimensional body and no faces, while a [[4-polytope]] has a four-dimensional body and an additional set of three-dimensional \"cells\".\nHowever, some of the literature on higher-dimensional geometry uses the term \"polyhedron\" to mean something else: not a three-dimensional polytope, but a shape that is different from a polytope in some way. For instance, some sources define a convex polyhedron to be the intersection of finitely many [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and a polytope to be a bounded polyhedron.<ref name=\"polytope-bounded-1\">{{citation\n | last = Grünbaum | first = Branko\n | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4613-0019-9\n | edition = 2nd\n | isbn = 978-0-387-00424-2\n | location = New York\n | mr = 1976856\n | page = 26\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag\n | ref = Grünbaum-Convex-Polytopes<!-- Don't interfere with harv links to the other Grünbaum 2003 reference -->\n | series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics\n | title = Convex Polytopes\n | volume = 221\n | year = 2003}}.</ref><ref name=\"polytope-bounded-2\">{{citation\n | last1 = Bruns | first1 = Winfried\n | last2 = Gubeladze | first2 = Joseph\n | contribution = Definition 1.1\n | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pbgg1pFxW8YC&pg=PA5\n | doi = 10.1007/b105283\n | isbn = 978-0-387-76355-2\n | mr = 2508056\n | page = 5\n | publisher = Springer | location = Dordrecht\n | series = Springer Monographs in Mathematics\n | title = Polytopes, Rings, and ''K''-theory\n | year = 2009| citeseerx = 10.1.1.693.2630\n }}.</ref> The remainder of this article considers only three-dimensional polyhedra.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Number of faces===\nPolyhedra may be classified and are often named according to the number of faces. The naming system is based on Classical Greek, for example [[tetrahedron]] (4), [[pentahedron]] (5), [[hexahedron]] (6), [[triacontahedron]] (30), and so on.\n\nFor a complete list of the Greek numeral prefixes see [[Numeral prefix#Table of number prefixes in English|Numeral prefixes>Table of number prefixes in English>Greek>Quantitative]]\n\n===Topological characteristics===\nThe topological class of a polyhedron is defined by its Euler characteristic and orientability.\n\nFrom this perspective, any polyhedral surface may be classed as certain kind of topological [[manifold (geometry)|manifold]]. For example, the surface of a convex or indeed any [[simply connected space|simply connected]] polyhedron is a topological sphere.\n\n====Euler characteristic====\nThe [[Euler characteristic]] χ relates the number of vertices ''V'', edges ''E'', and faces ''F'' of a polyhedron:\n:<math>\\chi=V-E+F.\\ </math>\n\nThis is equal to the topological Euler characteristic of its surface. For a convex polyhedron, or more generally any simply connected polyhedron with surface a topological sphere, χ = 2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richeson|2008}}, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>  For more complicated shapes, the Euler characteristic relates to the number of [[toroid]]al holes, handles or [[cross-cap]]s in the surface and will be less than 2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richeson|2008}}, p.&nbsp;180.</ref>\n\n====Orientability====\n[[File:Klein bottle2.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Self-intersecting polyhedral [[Klein bottle]] with quadrilateral faces]]\nSome polyhedra have two distinct sides to their surface. For example, the inside and outside of a [[convex polytope|convex polyhedron]] paper model can each be given a different colour (although the inside colour will be hidden from view). These polyhedra are [[Orientability|orientable]]. The same is true for non-convex polyhedra without self-crossings. Some non-convex self-crossing polyhedra can be coloured in the same way but have regions turned \"inside out\" so that both colours appear on the outside in different places; these are still considered to be orientable.\n\nBut for some other self-crossing polyhedra with simple-polygon faces, such as the [[tetrahemihexahedron]], it is not possible to colour the two sides of each face with two different colours so that adjacent faces have consistent colours.\nIn this case the polyhedron is said to be one-sided or non-orientable.\nFor polyhedra with self-crossing faces, it may not be clear what it means for adjacent faces to be consistently coloured, but for these polyhedra it is still possible to determine whether it is orientable or non-orientable by considering a topological [[cell complex]] with the same incidences between its vertices, edges, and faces.\n\nAll polyhedra with odd-numbered Euler characteristic χ are non-orientable. A given figure with even χ < 2 may or may not be orientable. For example, the one-holed [[toroid]] and the [[Klein bottle]] both have χ = 0, with the first being orientable and the other not.\n\n===Duality===\n{{main|Dual polyhedron}}\n[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|180px|The octahedron is dual to the cube]]\n\nFor every convex polyhedron, there exists a dual polyhedron having\n* faces in place of the original's vertices and vice versa, and\n* the same number of edges.\nThe dual of a convex polyhedron can be obtained by the process of [[Dual polyhedron#Polar reciprocation|polar reciprocation]].<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Cundy | first1 = H.

See in particular the bottom of page 260.</ref>\n\nAbstract polyhedra also have duals, which satisfy in addition that they have the same Euler characteristic and orientability as the initial polyhedron. However, this form of duality does not describe the shape of a dual polyhedron, but only its combinatorial structure. For some definitions of non-convex geometric polyhedra, there exist polyhedra whose abstract duals cannot be realized as geometric polyhedra under the same definition.\n\n===Vertex figures===\n{{Main|Vertex figure}}\nFor every vertex one can define a [[vertex figure]], which describes the local structure of the polyhedron around the vertex. Precise definitions vary, but a vertex figure can be thought of as the polygon exposed where a slice through the polyhedron cuts off a corner.<ref name=\"cromwell\" /> If the vertex figure is a [[regular polygon]], then the vertex itself is said to be regular.\n\n===Volume===\n\nPolyhedral solids have an associated quantity called [[volume]] that measures how much space they occupy.  Simple families of solids may have simple formulas for their volumes; for example, the volumes of pyramids, prisms, and [[parallelepiped]]s can easily be expressed in terms of their edge lengths or other coordinates.  (See [[volume#Volume formulas|Volume § Volume formulas]] for a list that includes many of these formulas.)\n\nVolumes of more complicated polyhedra may not have simple formulas.  Volumes of such polyhedra may be computed by subdividing the polyhedron into smaller pieces (for example, by [[point set triangulation|triangulation]]).  For example, the [[Platonic solid#Radii, area, and volume|volume of a regular polyhedron]] can be computed by dividing it into congruent [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], with each pyramid having a face of the polyhedron as its base and the centre of the polyhedron as its apex.\n\nIn general, it can be derived from the [[divergence theorem]] that the volume of a polyhedral solid is given by\n<math block=display>\n\\frac{1}{3} \\left| \\sum_F (Q_F \\cdot N_F) \\operatorname{area}(F) \\right|,\n</math>\nwhere the sum is over faces {{mvar|F}} of the polyhedron, {{math|''Q''<sub>''F''</sub>}} is an arbitrary point on face {{mvar|F}}, {{math|''N''<sub>''F''</sub>}} is the [[unit vector]] perpendicular to {{mvar|F}} pointing outside the solid, and the multiplication dot is the [[dot product]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Ronald N.|authorlink=Ron Goldman (mathematician) |editor-last=Arvo |editor-first=James |title=Graphic Gems Package: Graphics Gems II |publisher=Academic Press |year=1991 |pages=170–171 |chapter=Chapter IV.1: Area of planar polygons and volume of polyhedra}}</ref>  Since it may be difficult to enumerate the faces, volume computation may be challenging, and hence there exist specialized [[algorithm]]s to determine the volume (many of these generalize to [[convex polytope]]s in higher dimensions).<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Büeler | first1 = B. | last2 = Enge | first2 = A. | last3 = Fukuda | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-0348-8438-9_6 | chapter = Exact Volume Computation for Polytopes: A Practical Study | title = Polytopes — Combinatorics and Computation | pages = 131 | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-3-7643-6351-2 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.39.7700 }}</ref>\n\n===Dehn invariant===\n{{main|Dehn invariant}}\nIn two dimensions, the [[Bolyai–Gerwien theorem]] asserts that any polygon may be transformed into any other polygon of the same area by [[Dissection problem|cutting it up into finitely many polygonal pieces and rearranging them]].  The analogous question for polyhedra was the subject of [[Hilbert's third problem]]. [[Max Dehn]] solved this problem by showing that, unlike in the 2-D case, there exist polyhedra of the same volume that cannot be cut into smaller polyhedra and reassembled into each other. To prove this Dehn discovered another value associated with a polyhedron, the [[Dehn invariant]], such that two polyhedra can only be dissected into each other when they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. It was later proven by Sydler that this is the only obstacle to dissection: every two Euclidean polyhedra with the same volumes and Dehn invariants can be cut up and reassembled into each other.<ref>{{citation |last=Sydler |first=J.-P. | authorlink = Jean-Pierre Sydler |title=Conditions nécessaires et suffisantes pour l'équivalence des polyèdres de l'espace euclidien à trois dimensions |journal=[[Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici|Comment.

A [[convex polyhedron]] is a polyhedron that, as a solid, forms a convex set. A convex polyhedron can also be defined as a [[bounded set|bounded]] intersection of finitely many [[half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], or as the [[convex hull]] of finitely many points.\n\nImportant classes of convex polyhedra include the highly symmetrical [[Platonic solid]]s, the [[Archimedean polyhedron|Archimedean solids]] and their duals the [[Catalan solid]]s, and the regular-faced [[Johnson solid]]s.\n\n==Symmetries==\n[[File:Revolução de poliedros 03.webm|thumb|280px|Some polyhedra rotating around a symmetrical axis (at [[:pt:Matemateca IME-USP|Matemateca IME-USP]])]]\nMany of the most studied polyhedra are highly [[Symmetry|symmetrical]], that is, their appearance is unchanged by some reflection or rotation of space.  Each such symmetry may change the location of a given vertex, face, or edge, but the set of all vertices (likewise faces, edges) is unchanged.  The collection of symmetries of a polyhedron is called its [[symmetry group]].\n\nAll the elements that can be superimposed on each other by symmetries are said to form a [[Symmetry orbit#Orbits and stabilizers|symmetry orbit]]. For example, all the faces of a cube lie in one orbit, while all the edges lie in another. If all the elements of a given dimension, say all the faces, lie in the same orbit, the figure is said to be transitive on that orbit. For example, a cube is face-transitive, while a truncated cube has two symmetry orbits of faces.\n\nThe same abstract structure may support more or less symmetric geometric polyhedra. But where a polyhedral name is given, such as [[icosidodecahedron]], the most symmetrical geometry is almost always implied, unless otherwise stated.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThere are several types of highly symmetric polyhedron, classified by which kind of element – faces, edges, or vertices – belong to a single symmetry orbit:\n* [[Regular polyhedron|Regular]]: vertex-transitive, edge-transitive and face-transitive.  (This implies that every face is the same [[regular polygon]]; it also implies that every vertex is regular.)\n* [[Quasiregular polyhedron|Quasi-regular]]: vertex-transitive and edge-transitive (and hence has regular faces) but not face-transitive. A quasi-regular dual is face-transitive and edge-transitive (and hence every vertex is regular) but not vertex-transitive.\n* [[Semiregular polyhedron|Semi-regular]]: vertex-transitive but not edge-transitive, and every face is a regular polygon. (This is one of several definitions of the term, depending on author. Some definitions overlap with the quasi-regular class.) These polyhedra include the semiregular [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s. A semi-regular dual is face-transitive but not vertex-transitive, and every vertex is regular.\n* [[Uniform polyhedron|Uniform]]: vertex-transitive and every face is a regular polygon, i.e., it is regular, quasi-regular or semi-regular. A uniform dual is face-transitive and has regular vertices, but is not necessarily vertex-transitive.\n* [[Isogonal figure|Isogonal]]: vertex-transitive.\n* [[Isotoxal]]: edge-transitive.\n* [[Isohedral]]: face-transitive.\n* [[Noble polyhedron|Noble]]: face-transitive and vertex-transitive (but not necessarily edge-transitive). The regular polyhedra are also noble; they are the only noble uniform polyhedra.  The duals of noble polyhedra are themselves noble.\n\nSome classes of polyhedra have only a single main axis of symmetry. These include the [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[bipyramid]]s, [[trapezohedra]], [[cupola (geometry)|cupolae]], as well as the semiregular prisms and antiprisms.\n\n===Regular polyhedra===\n{{main|Platonic solid|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron}}\n\nRegular polyhedra are the most highly symmetrical. Altogether there are nine regular polyhedra: five convex and four star polyhedra.\n\nThe five convex examples have been known since antiquity and are called the [[Platonic solids]]. These are the triangular pyramid or [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]], [[octahedron]], [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em\"\n|[[File:Tetrahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[File:Hexahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[File:Octahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[File:Dodecahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[File:Icosahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|}\n\nThere are also four regular star polyhedra, known as the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]] after their discoverers.\n\nThe dual of a regular polyhedron is also regular.\n\n===Uniform polyhedra and their duals===\n{{Main|Uniform polyhedron}}\n\nUniform polyhedra are [[vertex-transitive]] and every face is a [[regular polygon]].\nThey may be subdivided into the [[Regular polyhedron|regular]], [[Quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]], or [[Semiregular polyhedron|semi-regular]], and may be convex or starry.\n\nThe duals of the uniform polyhedra have irregular faces but are [[face-transitive]], and every [[vertex figure]] is a regular polygon. A uniform polyhedron has the same symmetry orbits as its dual, with the faces and vertices simply swapped over. The duals of the convex Archimedean polyhedra are sometimes called the [[Catalan solid]]s.\n\nThe uniform polyhedra and their duals are traditionally classified according to their degree of symmetry, and whether they are [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] or not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Convex uniform\n!Convex uniform dual\n!Star uniform\n!Star uniform dual\n|-\n![[Regular polyhedron|Regular]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|[[Platonic solid]]s\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|[[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Quasiregular polyhedron|Quasiregular]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" |[[Archimedean solid]]s\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Catalan solid]]s\n|colspan=2 rowspan=2|[[Uniform star polyhedron]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=\"3\"|[[Semiregular polyhedron|Semiregular]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]]\n|[[Bipyramid]]s\n|[[Star prism]]s\n|[[Star bipyramid]]s\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Antiprism]]s\n|[[Trapezohedron|Trapezohedra]]\n|[[Star antiprism]]s\n|[[Star trapezohedra]]\n|}\n\n===Isohedra===\n{{main|Isohedron}}\n\nAn '''isohedron''' is a polyhedron with symmetries acting transitively on its faces. Their topology can be represented by a [[face configuration]]. All 5 [[Platonic solids]] and 13 [[Catalan solid]]s are isohedra, as well as the infinite families of [[trapezohedra]] and [[bipyramid]]s. Some isohedra allow geometric variations including concave and self-intersecting forms.\n\n===Symmetry groups===\n[[File:Icosahedral reflection domains.png|thumb|Full [[icosahedral symmetry]] divides the sphere into 120 triangular domains.]]\nMany of the symmetries or [[point groups in three dimensions]] are named after polyhedra having the associated symmetry.

Examples include the [[snub cuboctahedron]] and [[snub icosidodecahedron]].\n\n== Other important families of polyhedra ==\n=== Polyhedra with regular faces ===\n\nBesides the regular and uniform polyhedra, there are some other classes which have regular faces but lower overall symmetry.\n\n====Equal regular faces====\nConvex polyhedra where every face is the same kind of regular polygon may be found among three families:\n* Triangles: These polyhedra are called [[deltahedra]]. There are eight convex deltahedra: three of the Platonic solids and five non-uniform examples.\n* Squares: The cube is the only convex example. Other examples (the [[polycube]]s) can be obtained by joining cubes together, although care must be taken if [[coplanar]] faces are to be avoided.\n* Pentagons: The regular dodecahedron is the only convex example.\n\nPolyhedra with congruent regular faces of six or more sides are all non-convex.\n\nThe total number of convex polyhedra with equal regular faces is thus ten: the five Platonic solids and the five non-uniform deltahedra.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cromwell|1997}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OJowej1QWpoC&pg=PA86 p.&nbsp;86].</ref>  There are infinitely many non-convex examples.

In 1966, he published a list of 92 such solids, gave them names and numbers, and conjectured that there were no others. [[Victor Zalgaller]] proved in 1969 that the list of these '''[[Johnson solid]]s''' was complete.\n\n=== Pyramids ===\n{{main|Pyramid (geometry)}}\nPyramids include some of the most time-honoured and famous of all polyhedra, such as the four-sided [[Egyptian pyramid]]s.\n\n=== Stellations and facettings ===\n{{Main|Stellation|Faceting}}\n\nStellation of a polyhedron is the process of extending the faces (within their planes) so that they meet to form a new polyhedron.\n\nIt is the exact reciprocal{{clarify|what is this word support see ed to mean in this context?|date=March 2017}} to the process of facetting, which is the process of removing parts of a polyhedron without creating any new vertices.\n\nThe figures below show some stellations of the regular octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em\"\n|-\n|[[File:First stellation of octahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:First stellation of dodecahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:Second stellation of dodecahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:Third stellation of dodecahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:Sixteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:First stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:Seventeenth stellation of icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|}\n\n=== Zonohedra ===\n{{main|Zonohedron}}\nA zonohedron is a convex polyhedron in which every face is a [[polygon]] that is symmetric under [[rotation]]s through 180°.

Topologically, the surfaces of such polyhedra are [[torus]] surfaces having one or more holes through the middle.\n\n===Space-filling polyhedra===\n{{Main|Honeycomb (geometry)}}\nA space-filling polyhedron packs with copies of itself to fill space. Such a close-packing or space-filling is often called a tessellation of space or a honeycomb. Space-filling polyhedra must have a [[#Dehn invariant|Dehn invariant]] equal to zero. Some honeycombs involve more than one kind of polyhedron.\n\n=== Lattice polyhedra ===\n{{main|Ehrhart polynomial}}\nA convex polyhedron in which all vertices have integer coordinates is called a [[convex lattice polytope|lattice polyhedron]] or [[integral polyhedron]].  The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polyhedron counts how many points with [[integer]] coordinates lie within a scaled copy of the polyhedron, as a function of the scale factor. The study of these polynomials lies at the intersection of [[combinatorics]] and [[commutative algebra]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley |first=Richard P. |date=1997 |title=Enumerative Combinatorics, Volume I |edition=1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=235–239 |isbn=978-0-521-66351-9 |author-link=Richard P.

A polyhedron that can do this is called a flexible polyhedron. By [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy's rigidity theorem]], flexible polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as the bellows theorem.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Demaine | first1 = Erik D. | author1-link = Erik Demaine\n | last2 = O'Rourke | first2 = Joseph | author2-link = Joseph O'Rourke (professor)\n | contribution = 23.2 Flexible polyhedra\n | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511735172\n | isbn = 978-0-521-85757-4\n | mr = 2354878\n | pages = 345–348\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press, Cambridge\n | title = Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, origami, polyhedra\n | year = 2007}}.</ref>\n\n=== Compounds ===\n{{main|Polyhedral compound}}\nA polyhedral compound is made of two or more polyhedra sharing a common centre.  Symmetrical compounds often share the same vertices as other well-known polyhedra and may often also be formed by stellation. Some are listed in the [[list of Wenninger polyhedron models]].\n\n=== Orthogonal polyhedra ===\nAn orthogonal polyhedron is one all of whose faces meet at [[right angle]]s, and all of whose edges are parallel to axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. Aside from the [[rectangular box]]es, orthogonal polyhedra are nonconvex. They are the 3D analogs of 2D orthogonal polygons, also known as [[rectilinear polygon]]s.  Orthogonal polyhedra are used in [[computational geometry]], where their constrained structure has enabled advances on problems unsolved for arbitrary polyhedra, for example, unfolding the surface of a polyhedron to a [[polygonal net]].<ref>{{citation\n | last = O'Rourke | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph O'Rourke (professor)\n | contribution = Unfolding orthogonal polyhedra\n | doi = 10.1090/conm/453/08805\n | mr = 2405687\n | pages = 307–317\n | publisher = Amer.

The [[apeirohedron|apeirohedra]] form a related class of objects with infinitely many faces. Examples of apeirohedra include:\n* tilings or [[tessellation]]s of the plane, and\n* sponge-like structures called [[skew apeirohedron|infinite skew polyhedra]].\n\n===Complex polyhedra===\n{{Main|Complex polytope}}\nThere are objects called complex polyhedra, for which the underlying space is a [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] rather than real Euclidean space.  Precise definitions exist only for the regular complex polyhedra, whose symmetry groups are [[complex reflection group]]s.  The complex polyhedra are mathematically more closely related to [[configuration (polytope)|configurations]] than to real polyhedra.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Coxeter | first = H.S.M. | author-link = Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter\n | location = Cambridge\n | mr = 0370328\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | title = Regular Complex Polytopes\n | year = 1974}}. {{page needed|date=February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Curved polyhedra===\nSome fields of study allow polyhedra to have curved faces and edges. Curved faces can allow [[digon]]al faces to exist with a positive area.\n\n====Spherical polyhedra====\n{{Main|Spherical polyhedron}}\n\nWhen the surface of a sphere is divided by finitely many [[great arc]]s (equivalently, by planes passing through the center of the sphere), the result is called a spherical polyhedron.  Many convex polytopes having some degree of symmetry (for example, all the Platonic solids) can be projected onto the surface of a concentric sphere to produce a spherical polyhedron.  However, the reverse process is not always possible; some spherical polyhedra (such as the [[hosohedron|hosohedra]]) have no flat-faced analogue.<ref>{{citation|title=Divided Spheres: Geodesics and the Orderly Subdivision of the Sphere|first=Edward S.|last=Popko|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4665-0430-1|page=463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjTSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA463|quote=\"A hosohedron is only possible on a sphere\"}}.</ref>\n\n====Curved spacefilling polyhedra====\nIf faces are allowed to be concave as well as convex, adjacent faces may be made to meet together with no gap.

Such figures have a long history: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] devised frame models of the regular solids, which he drew for [[Pacioli]]'s book ''Divina Proportione'', and similar [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame]] polyhedra appear in [[M.C. Escher]]'s print [[Stars (M. C. Escher)|''Stars'']].<ref>{{citation | last=Coxeter | first=H.S.M. | author-link=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | doi=10.1007/BF03023010 | issue=1 | journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer | pages=59–69 | title=A special book review: M.C. Escher: His life and complete graphic work | volume=7 | year=1985}} Coxeter's analysis of ''Stars'' is on pp. 61–62.</ref>  One highlight of this approach is [[Steinitz's theorem]], which gives a purely graph-theoretic characterization of the skeletons of convex polyhedra: it states that the skeleton of every convex polyhedron is a [[vertex connectivity|3-connected]] [[planar graph]], and every 3-connected planar graph is the skeleton of some convex polyhedron.\n\nAn early idea of [[#Abstract polyhedra|abstract polyhedra]] was developed in [[Branko Grünbaum]]'s study of \"hollow-faced polyhedra.\"  Grünbaum defined faces to be cyclically ordered sets of vertices, and allowed them to be [[Skew polygon|skew]] as well as planar.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1994}}.</ref>\n\nThe graph perspective allows one to apply [[Glossary of graph theory|graph terminology]] and properties to polyhedra.  For example, the tetrahedron and [[Császár polyhedron]] are the only known polyhedra whose skeletons are [[complete graph]]s (K<sub>4</sub>), and various symmetry restrictions on polyhedra give rise to skeletons that are [[symmetric graph]]s.\n\n==Alternative usages==\nFrom the latter half of the twentieth century, various mathematical constructs have been found to have properties also present in traditional polyhedra. Rather than confining the term \"polyhedron\" to describe a three-dimensional polytope, it has been adopted to describe various related but distinct kinds of structure.\n\n=== Higher-dimensional polyhedra ===\nA polyhedron has been defined as a set of points in [[real number|real]] [[affine space|affine]] (or [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) space of any dimension ''n'' that has flat sides.  It may alternatively be defined as the intersection of finitely many [[half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]].  Unlike a conventional polyhedron, it may be bounded or unbounded.  In this meaning, a [[polytope]] is a bounded polyhedron.<ref name=\"polytope-bounded-1\"/><ref name=\"polytope-bounded-2\"/>\n\nAnalytically, such a convex polyhedron is expressed as the solution set for a system of linear inequalities. Defining polyhedra in this way provides a geometric perspective for problems in [[linear programming]].\nMany traditional polyhedral forms are polyhedra in this sense. Other examples include:\n* A quadrant in the plane.  For instance, the region of the cartesian plane consisting of all points above the horizontal axis and to the right of the vertical axis: {{math| { ( ''x'', ''y'' ) : ''x'' ≥ 0, ''y'' ≥ 0 } }}.  Its sides are the two positive axes, and it is otherwise unbounded.\n* An octant in Euclidean 3-space,  {{math| { ( ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' ) : ''x'' ≥ 0, ''y'' ≥ 0, ''z'' ≥ 0 } }}.\n* A prism of infinite extent.  For instance a doubly infinite square prism in 3-space, consisting of a square in the ''xy''-plane swept along the ''z''-axis:  {{math|{ ( ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' ) : 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1,  0 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 1 } }}.\n* Each [[cell (geometry)|cell]] in a [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi tessellation]] is a convex polyhedron.  In the Voronoi tessellation of a set ''S'', the cell ''A'' corresponding to a point {{math|''c'' ∈ ''S''}} is bounded (hence a traditional polyhedron) when ''c'' lies in the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the [[convex hull]] of ''S'', and otherwise (when ''c'' lies on the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the convex hull of ''S'') ''A'' is unbounded.\n\n=== Topological polyhedra ===\nA topological polytope is a topological space given along with a specific decomposition into shapes that are topologically equivalent to [[convex polytope]]s and that are attached to each other in a regular way.\n\nSuch a figure is called ''simplicial'' if each of its regions is a [[simplex]], i.e. in an ''n''-dimensional space each region has ''n''+1 vertices.  The dual of a simplicial polytope is called ''simple''.  Similarly, a widely studied class of polytopes (polyhedra) is that of cubical polyhedra, when the basic building block is an ''n''-dimensional cube.\n\n===Abstract polyhedra===\n{{Main|Abstract polytope}}\n\nAn [[abstract polytope]] is a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) of elements whose partial ordering obeys certain rules of incidence (connectivity) and ranking. The elements of the set correspond to the vertices, edges, faces and so on of the polytope: vertices have rank 0, edges rank 1, etc. with the partially ordered ranking corresponding to the dimensionality of the geometric elements. The empty set, required by set theory, has a rank of −1 and is sometimes said to correspond to the null polytope. An abstract polyhedron is an abstract polytope having the following ranking:\n* rank 3: The maximal element, sometimes identified with the body.\n* rank 2: The polygonal faces.\n* rank 1: The edges.\n* rank 0: the vertices.\n* rank −1: The empty set, sometimes identified with the ''null polytope'' or ''nullitope''<ref>[[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|N.W. Johnson]]: ''Geometries and Transformations'', (2018) {{ISBN|978-1-107-10340-5}} Chapter 11: ''Finite Symmetry Groups'', 11.1 ''Polytopes and Honeycombs'', p.224</ref>.\n\nAny geometric polyhedron is then said to be a \"realization\" in real space of the abstract poset as described above.<!-- but see discussion -->\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Ancient===\n;Prehistory\nPolyhedra appeared in early [[architecture|architectural forms]] such as cubes and cuboids, with the earliest four-sided pyramids of ancient [[Egypt]] also dating from the Stone Age.\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] preceded the Greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]  [[dodecahedron]] made of [[soapstone]] on [[Monte Loffa]]. Its faces were marked with different designs, suggesting to some scholars that it may have been used as a gaming die.<ref>{{cite arxiv |title=An Etruscan dodecahedron|first=Amelia Carolina|last=Sparavigna|year=2012|eprint=1205.0706|class=math.HO|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n;Greek civilisation\nThe earliest known ''written'' records of these shapes come from Classical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] authors, who also gave the first known mathematical description of them. The earlier Greeks were interested primarily in the [[Regular polyhedron#History|convex regular polyhedra]], which came to be known as the [[Platonic solid]]s. [[Pythagoras]] knew at least three of them, and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (circa 417 B.&nbsp;C.) described all five. Eventually, [[Euclid]] described their construction in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Later, [[Archimedes]] expanded his study to the [[Uniform polyhedron|convex uniform polyhedra]] which now bear his name. His original work is lost and his solids come down to us through [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]].\n\n;China\nCubical gaming dice in China have been dated back as early as 600 B.C.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nBy 236 AD, Liu Hui was describing the dissection of the cube into its characteristic tetrahedron (orthoscheme) and related solids, using assemblages of these solids as the basis for calculating volumes of earth to be moved during engineering excavations.\n\n;Islamic civilisation\nAfter the end of the Classical era, scholars in the Islamic civilisation continued to take the Greek knowledge forward (see [[Mathematics in medieval Islam]]).\n\nThe 9th century scholar [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] gave formulae for calculating the volumes of polyhedra such as truncated pyramids.\n\nThen in the 10th century [[Abūl Wafā' Būzjānī|Abu'l Wafa]] described the convex regular and quasiregular spherical polyhedra.\n\n===Renaissance===\nAs with other areas of Greek thought maintained and enhanced by Islamic scholars, Western interest in polyhedra revived during the Italian [[Renaissance]]. Artists constructed skeletal polyhedra, depicting them from life as a part of their investigations into [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Several appear in marquetry panels of the period. [[Piero della Francesca]] gave the first written description of direct geometrical construction of such perspective views of polyhedra. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made skeletal models of several polyhedra and drew illustrations of them for a book by Pacioli. A painting by an anonymous artist of Pacioli and a pupil depicts a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] half-filled with water.\n\nAs the Renaissance spread beyond Italy, later artists such as [[Wenzel Jamnitzer]], Dürer and others also depicted polyhedra of various kinds, many of them novel, in imaginative etchings.\n\n=== Star polyhedra ===\nFor almost 2,000 years, the concept of a polyhedron as a convex solid had remained as developed by the ancient Greek mathematicians.\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] star forms were discovered. A marble tarsia in the floor of [[St. Mark's Basilica]], Venice, depicts a stellated dodecahedron. Artists such as [[Wenzel Jamnitzer]] delighted in depicting novel star-like forms of increasing complexity.\n\n[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630) used [[star polygon]]s, typically [[pentagram]]s, to build star polyhedra. Some of these figures may have been discovered before Kepler's time, but he was the first to recognize that they could be considered \"regular\" if one removed the restriction that regular polytopes must be convex. Later, [[Louis Poinsot]] realised that star [[vertex figure]]s (circuits around each corner) can also be used, and discovered the remaining two regular star polyhedra. Cauchy proved Poinsot's list complete, and Cayley gave them their accepted English names: (Kepler's) the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great stellated dodecahedron]], and (Poinsot's) the [[great icosahedron]] and [[great dodecahedron]]. Collectively they are called the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].\n\nThe Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra may be constructed from the Platonic solids by a process called [[stellation]]. Most stellations are not regular. The study of stellations of the Platonic solids was given a big push by [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] and others in 1938, with the now famous paper ''The 59 icosahedra''.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Coxeter | first1 = H.S.M. | author1-link = Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter\n | last2 = Du Val | first2 = P.\n | last3 = Flather | first3 = H.T.\n | last4 = Petrie | first4 = J.F.\n | isbn = 978-1-899618-32-3\n | mr = 676126\n | orig-year = 1938\n | publisher = Tarquin Publications\n | title = The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra\n | year = 1999}}.</ref>\n\nThe reciprocal process to stellation is called [[facetting]] (or faceting).

This signalled the birth of [[topology]], sometimes referred to as \"rubber sheet geometry\", and [[Henri Poincaré]] developed its core ideas around the end of the nineteenth century. This allowed many longstanding issues over what was or was not a polyhedron to be resolved.\n\n[[Max Brückner]] summarised work on polyhedra to date, including many findings of his own, in his book \"Vielecke und Vielflache: Theorie und Geschichte\" (Polygons and polyhedra: Theory and History). Published in German in 1900, it remained little known.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery of higher dimensions led to the idea of a polyhedron as a three-dimensional example of the more general polytope.\n\n===Twentieth-century revival===\nBy the early years of the twentieth century, mathematicians had moved on and geometry was little studied. Coxeter's analysis in ''The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra'' introduced modern ideas from [[graph theory]] and [[combinatorics]] into the study of polyhedra, signalling a rebirth of interest in geometry.\n\nCoxeter himself went on to enumerate the star uniform polyhedra for the first time, to treat tilings of the plane as polyhedra, to discover the [[regular skew polyhedron|regular skew polyhedra]] and to develop the theory of [[complex polytope|complex polyhedra]] first discovered by Shephard in 1952, as well as making fundamental contributions to many other areas of geometry.\n\nIn the second part of the twentieth century, Grünbaum published important works in two areas. One was in [[convex polytope]]s, where he noted a tendency among mathematicians to define a \"polyhedron\" in different and sometimes incompatible ways to suit the needs of the moment. The other was a series of papers broadening the accepted definition of a polyhedron, for example discovering many new [[Regular polyhedron#History|regular polyhedra]]. At the close of the 20th century these latter ideas merged with other work on [[incidence complex]]es to create the modern idea of an abstract polyhedron (as an abstract 3-polytope), notably presented by McMullen and Schulte.\n\n==In nature==\n<!--This needs a bit of writing, esp. re '''''crystals'''''.-->\n\nFor natural occurrences of regular polyhedra, ''see [[Regular polyhedron#Regular polyhedra in nature|Regular polyhedron: Regular polyhedra in nature]].''\n\nIrregular polyhedra appear in nature as [[crystal]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[defect (geometry)|Defect]]\n* [[Deltohedron]]\n* [[Extension of a polyhedron]]\n* [[Goldberg polyhedron]]\n* [[Regular polytope#History of discovery|History of the regular polytopes]].\n* [[List of books about polyhedra]]\n* [[List of small polyhedra by vertex count]]\n* [[Near-miss Johnson solid]]\n* [[Net (polyhedron)]]\n* [[Polyhedron model]]s\n* [[Schlegel diagram]]\n* [[Spidron]]\n* [[Stella (software)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation\n | last = Cromwell | first = Peter R.\n | isbn = 978-0-521-55432-9\n | location = Cambridge\n | mr = 1458063\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | title = Polyhedra\n | year = 1997}}.\n* {{citation\n | last = Grünbaum | first = Branko | author-link = Branko Grünbaum\n | editor1-last = Bisztriczky | editor1-first = Tibor\n | editor2-last = Schneider | editor2-first = Peter McMullen;Rolf\n | editor3-last = Weiss | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Polyhedra with hollow faces\n | doi = 10.1007/978-94-011-0924-6_3\n | isbn = 978-94-010-4398-4\n | location = Dordrecht\n | mr = 1322057\n | pages = 43–70\n | publisher = Kluwer Acad.

Because alternation reduces all polygon faces to half as many sides, it can only be applied to polytopes with all even-sided faces. An alternated square face becomes a [[digon]], and being degenerate, is usually reduced to a single edge.\n\nMore generally any [[vertex-uniform]] polyhedron or tiling with a [[vertex configuration]] consisting of all even-numbered elements can be ''alternated''. For example, the alternation of a vertex figure with ''2a.2b.2c'' is ''a.3.b.3.c.3'' where the three is the number of elements in this vertex figure. A special case is square faces whose order divides in half into degenerate [[digon]]s. So for example, the cube ''4.4.4'' is alternated as ''2.3.2.3.2.3'' which is reduced to 3.3.3, being the [[tetrahedron]], and all the 6 edges of the tetrahedra can also be seen as the degenerate faces of the original cube.\n\n== Snub ==\n{{further|Snub (geometry)}}\n\nA '''snub''' (in [[Snub (geometry)#Coxeter's snubs, regular and quasiregular|Coxeter's terminology]]) can be seen as an '''alternation''' of a [[truncation (geometry)|truncated]] regular or truncated [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasiregular]] polyhedron. In general a polyhedron can be snubbed if its truncation has only even-sided faces. All [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] polyhedra can be snubbed, not just from regular polyhedra.\n\nThe [[snub square antiprism]] is an example of a general snub, and can be represented by ss{2,4}, with the [[square antiprism]], s{2,4}.\n\n== Alternated polytopes ==\n\nThis ''alternation'' operation applies to higher-dimensional polytopes and honeycombs as well, but in general most of the results of this operation will not be uniform. The voids created by the deleted vertices will not in general create uniform facets, and there are typically not enough degrees of freedom to allow an appropriate rescaling of the new edges. Exceptions do exist, however, such as the derivation of the [[snub 24-cell]] from the [[truncated 24-cell]].\n\nExamples:\n* [[Honeycomb (geometry)|Honeycombs]]\n*# An alternated [[cubic honeycomb]] is the [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]].\n*# An alternated [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]] is the [[gyrated alternated cubic honeycomb]].\n* [[4-polytope]]\n*# An alternated [[truncated 24-cell]] is the [[snub 24-cell]].\n* 4-honeycombs:\n*# An alternated [[truncated 24-cell honeycomb]] is the [[snub 24-cell honeycomb]].\n* A [[hypercube]] can always be alternated into a uniform [[demihypercube]].\n*# [[Cube]] → [[Tetrahedron]] (regular)\n*#* [[Image:hexahedron.png|50px]] → [[Image:tetrahedron.png|50px]]\n*# ''Tesseract'' ([[8-cell]]) → [[16-cell]] (regular)\n*#* [[Image:Schlegel wireframe 8-cell.png|50px]] → [[Image:Schlegel wireframe 16-cell.png|50px]]\n*# [[Penteract]] → [[demipenteract]] (semiregular)\n*# [[Hexeract]] → [[demihexeract]] (uniform)\n*# ...\n\n== Altered polyhedra ==\nCoxeter also used the operator ''a'', which contains both halves, so retains the original symmetry. For even-sided regular polyhedra, a{2p,q} represents a [[compound polyhedron]] with two opposite copies of h{2p,q}. For odd-sided, greater than 3, regular polyhedra a{p,q}, becomes a [[star polyhedron]].\n\n[[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] extended the use of the '''altered''' operator ''a''{p,q}, ''b''{p,q} for '''blended''', and ''c''{p,q} for '''converted''', as {{CDD|node_h3|p|node|q|node}}, {{CDD|node|p|node_h3|q|node}}, and {{CDD|node|p|node|q|node_h3}} respectively.\n\nThe compound polyhedron, [[stellated octahedron]] can be represented by a{4,3}, and {{CDD|node_h3|4|node|3|node}}, [[File:Compound_of_two_tetrahedra.png|40px]].\n\nThe star-polyhedron, [[small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron]], can be represented by a{5,3}, and {{CDD|node_h3|5|node|3|node}}, [[File:Small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron.png|40px]]. Here all the pentagons have been alternated into pentagrams, and triangles have been inserted to take up the resulting free edges.\n\n== Alternate truncations ==\n\nA similar operation can [[Truncation (geometry)|truncate]] alternate vertices, rather than just removing them. Below is a set of polyhedra that can be generated from the [[Catalan solid]]s. These have two types of vertices which can be alternately truncated. Truncating the \"higher order\" vertices and both vertex types produce these forms:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Original\n!Alternated<BR>truncation\n!Truncation\n!Truncated name\n|-\n|[[Cube]]<BR>Dual of rectified tetrahedron\n|[[Image:hexahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Image:Alternate truncated cube.png|50px]]\n|[[File:Uniform polyhedron-43-t01.svg|50px]]\n|[[Alternate truncated cube]]\n|-\n|[[Rhombic dodecahedron]]<BR>Dual of cuboctahedron\n|[[Image:rhombicdodecahedron.jpg|50px]] \n|[[Image:Truncated rhombic dodecahedron2.png|50px]] \n|[[File:StellaTruncRhombicDodeca.png|50px]]\n|[[Truncated rhombic dodecahedron]]\n|-\n|[[Rhombic triacontahedron]]<BR>Dual of icosidodecahedron\n|[[Image:Rhombictriacontahedron.svg|50px]]\n|[[Image:Truncated rhombic triacontahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:StellaTruncRhombicTriaconta.png|50px]]\n|[[Truncated rhombic triacontahedron]]\n|-\n|[[Triakis tetrahedron]]<BR>Dual of truncated tetrahedron\n|[[Image:Triakistetrahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Image:Truncated triakis tetrahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:StellaTruncTriakisTetra.png|50px]]\n|[[Truncated triakis tetrahedron]]\n|-\n|[[Triakis octahedron]]<BR>Dual of truncated cube\n|[[Image:Triakisoctahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Image:Truncated triakis octahedron.png|50px]]\n|[[File:StellaTruncTriakisOcta.png|50px]]\n|[[Truncated triakis octahedron]]\n|-\n|[[Triakis icosahedron]]<BR>Dual of truncated dodecahedron\n|[[Image:Triakisicosahedron.jpg|50px]]\n|[[Image:Truncated triakis icosahedron.png|50px]]\n|\n|[[Truncated triakis icosahedron]]\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conway polyhedral notation]]\n* [[Wythoff construction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Coxeter|Coxeter, H.S.M.]] ''[[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]'', (3rd edition, 1973), Dover edition, {{ISBN|0-486-61480-8}}\n* [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] ''Uniform Polytopes'', Manuscript (1991)\n** [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|N.W.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_defect",
      "text": "In [[geometry]], the ('''angular''') '''defect''' (or '''deficit''' or '''deficiency''') means the failure of some [[angle]]s to add up to the expected amount of 360° or 180°, when such angles in the [[Euclidean plane]] would. The opposite notion is the [[angle excess|excess]].\n\nClassically the defect arises in two ways:\n* the defect of a vertex of a polyhedron;\n* the defect of a [[hyperbolic triangle]];\nand the excess also arises in two ways:\n* the excess of a [[toroidal polyhedron]].\n* the excess of a [[spherical triangle]];\nIn the Euclidean plane, angles about a point add up to 360°, while [[Internal and external angle|interior angles]] in a triangle add up to 180° (equivalently, ''exterior'' angles add up to 360°). However, on a convex polyhedron the angles at a vertex on average add up to less than 360°, on a spherical triangle the interior angles always add up to more than 180° (the exterior angles add up to ''less'' than 360°), and the angles in a hyperbolic triangle always add up to less than 180° (the exterior angles add up to ''more'' than 360°).\n\nIn modern terms, the defect at a vertex or over a triangle (with a minus) is precisely the curvature at that point or the total (integrated) over the triangle, as established by the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]].\n\n== Defect of a vertex ==\nFor a [[polyhedron]], the defect at a vertex equals 2π minus the sum of all the angles at the vertex (all the faces at the vertex are included).  If a polyhedron is convex, then the defect of each vertex is always positive.  If the sum of the angles exceeds a full [[turn (geometry)|turn]], as occurs in some vertices of many non-convex polyhedra, then the defect is negative.\n\nThe concept of defect extends to higher dimensions as the amount by which the sum of the [[dihedral angle]]s of the [[cell (geometry)|cells]] at a [[peak (mathematics)|peak]] falls short of a full circle.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe defect of any of the vertices of a regular [[dodecahedron]] (in which three regular [[pentagon]]s meet at each vertex) is 36°, or π/5 radians, or 1/10 of a circle. Each of the angles measures 108°; three of these meet at each vertex, so the defect is 360° − (108° + 108° + 108°) = 36°.\n\nThe same procedure can be followed for the other [[Platonic solid]]s:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Shape\n!Number of vertices \n!Polygons meeting at each vertex\n!Defect at each vertex\n!Total defect\n|-\n|[[tetrahedron]]||4||Three equilateral triangles||<math>\\pi \\ \\ (180^\\circ )</math>||<math>4\\pi \\ \\ (720^\\circ )</math>\n|-\n|[[octahedron]]||6||Four equilateral triangles||<math>{2 \\pi\\over 3} \\    (120^\\circ )</math>||<math>4\\pi \\ \\ (720^\\circ )</math>\n|-\n|[[cube]]||8||Three squares||<math>{\\pi\\over 2}\\ \\  (90^\\circ )</math>||<math>4\\pi \\ \\ (720^\\circ )</math>\n|-\n|[[icosahedron]]||12||Five equilateral triangles||<math>{\\pi\\over 3}\\ \\  (60^\\circ )</math>||<math>4\\pi \\ \\ (720^\\circ )</math>\n|-\n|[[dodecahedron]]||20||Three regular pentagons||<math>{\\pi\\over 5}\\ \\  (36^\\circ )</math>||<math>4\\pi \\ \\ (720^\\circ )</math>\n|}\n\n==Descartes' theorem==\nDescartes' theorem on the \"total defect\" of a polyhedron states that if the polyhedron is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a sphere (i.e. topologically equivalent to a sphere, so that it may be deformed into a sphere by stretching without tearing), the \"total defect\", i.e. the sum of the defects of all of the vertices, is two full circles (or 720° or 4π radians).  The polyhedron need not be convex.<ref>[[René Descartes|Descartes, René]], ''Progymnasmata de solidorum elementis'', in ''Oeuvres de Descartes'', vol. X, pp. 265–276</ref>\n\nA generalization says the number of circles in the total defect equals the [[Euler characteristic]] of the polyhedron. This is a special case of the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] which relates the integral of the [[Gaussian curvature]] to the Euler characteristic. Here the Gaussian curvature is concentrated at the vertices: on the faces and edges the Gaussian curvature is zero and the integral of Gaussian curvature at a vertex is equal to the defect there.\n\nThis can be used to calculate the number ''V'' of vertices of a polyhedron by totaling the angles of all the faces, and adding the total defect. This total will have one complete circle for every vertex in the polyhedron. Care has to be taken to use the correct Euler characteristic for the polyhedron.\n\nA converse to this theorem is given by [[Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem]], according to which a metric space that is locally Euclidean except for a finite number of points of positive angular defect, adding to 4π, can be realized in a unique way as the surface of a convex polyhedron.\n\n==Positive defects on non-convex figures==\nIt is tempting to think that every non-convex polyhedron must have some vertices whose defect is negative, but this need not be the case. Two counterexamples to this are the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and the [[great stellated dodecahedron]], which have twelve convex points each with positive defects. \n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Polyhedra with positive defects\n|[[Image:Polydera with positive defects convex.svg|180px]]\n|[[Image:Polydera with positive defects concave.svg|180px]]\n|}\n\nA counterexample which does not intersect itself is provided by a [[cube]] where one face is replaced by a [[square pyramid]]: this [[elongated square pyramid]] is convex and the defects at each vertex are each positive.  Now consider the same cube where the square pyramid goes into the cube: this is concave, but the defects remain the same and so are all positive.\n\nNegative defect indicates that the vertex resembles a [[saddle point]], whereas positive defect indicates that the vertex resembles a [[local maximum]] or minimum.\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n<references />\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Richeson, D.; ''Euler's Gem: The Polyhedron Formula and the Birth of Topology'', Princeton (2008), Pages 220–225.\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|defect}}\n*{{Mathworld | urlname=AngularDefect | title=Angular defect }}\n\n[[Category:Polyhedra]]\n[[Category:Hyperbolic geometry]]"

The triangular gyrobicupola is an [[Archimedean solid]], the [[cuboctahedron]]; the other five are [[Johnson solid]]s.\n\nBicupolae of higher order can be constructed if the flank faces are allowed to stretch into [[rectangle]]s and [[isosceles triangle]]s.\n\nBicupolae are special in having four faces on every vertex.

An extra axial straw is added which doesn't exist in the simple polyhedron]]\nAn ''n''-gonal '''bipyramid''' or '''dipyramid''' is a [[polyhedron]] formed by joining an ''n''-gonal [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] and its [[mirror image]] base-to-base. An ''n''-gonal bipyramid has 2''n'' [[triangle]] faces, 3''n'' edges, and 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' vertices.\n\nThe referenced ''n''-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.\n\n==Right, oblique and concave bipyramids==\nA '''right bipyramid''' has two points above and below the [[centroid]] of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called '''oblique bipyramids'''. A '''regular bipyramid''' has a [[regular polygon]] internal face and is usually implied to be a ''right bipyramid''. A right bipyramid can be represented as {{nowrap|{ } + P}} for internal polygon P, and a regular ''n''-bipyramid {{nowrap|{ } + {''n''}.}}\n\nA '''concave bipyramid''' has a concave interior polygon.\n:[[File:Concave quadrilateral bipyramid.png|160px|A concave bipyramid]]\n\nThe [[face-transitive]] regular bipyramids are the [[dual polyhedra]] of the [[Prism (geometry)|uniform prisms]] and will generally have [[isosceles triangle]] faces.\n\nA bipyramid can be [[Perspective projection|projected]] on a sphere or [[globe]] as ''n'' equally spaced lines of [[longitude]] going from [[Geographical pole|pole]] to pole, and [[Bisection|bisected]] by a line around the [[equator]].\n\nBipyramid [[face (geometry)|face]]s, projected as [[spherical triangle]]s, represent the fundamental domains in the [[List of spherical symmetry groups#Dihedral|dihedral symmetry]] D<sub>''n''h</sub>.

This works for any location of the apex, provided that ''h'' is measured as the [[perpendicular]] distance from the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] which contains the base.\n\nThe volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] with side length ''s'' and whose height is ''h'' is therefore:\n:<math>V = \\frac{n}{6}hs^2 \\cot\\frac{\\pi}{n}.</math>\n\n==Equilateral triangle bipyramids==\nOnly three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are [[equilateral triangle]]s, and thus the bipyramid is a [[deltahedron]]): the [[Triangular dipyramid|triangular]], [[tetragonal]], and [[Pentagonal dipyramid|pentagonal]] bipyramids.

Boerdijk]], is a linear stacking of regular [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], arranged so that the edges of the complex that belong to only one tetrahedron form three intertwined [[helix|helices]]. There are two [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] forms, with either clockwise or counterclockwise windings. Unlike any other stacking of [[Platonic solids]], the Boerdijk–Coxeter helix is not rotationally repetitive in 3-dimensional space. Even in an infinite string of stacked tetrahedra, no two tetrahedra will have the same orientation, because the helical pitch per cell is not a rational fraction of the circle. However, modified forms of this helix have been found which are rotationally repetitive,{{Sfn|Sadler|Fang|Kovacs|Klee|2013}} and in 4-dimensional space this helix repeats in rings of exactly 30 tetrahedral cells that tessellate the [[3-sphere]] surface of the [[600-cell]], one of the six regular convex [[4-polytope|polychorons]].\n\n[[Buckminster Fuller]] named it a ''tetrahelix'' and considered them with regular and irregular tetrahedral elements.{{Sfn|Fuller|1975|loc=[http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/p3000.html 930.00 Tetrahelix]}}\n\n== Geometry ==\nThe coordinates of vertices of Boerdijk–Coxeter helix composed of tetrahedrons with unit edge length can be written in the form\n\n: <math>(r\\cos n\\theta,r\\sin n\\theta,n h)</math>\nwhere <math>r=3\\sqrt{3}/10</math>, <math>\\theta=\\pm\\cos^{-1}(-2/3)</math>, <math>h=1/\\sqrt{10}</math> and <math>n</math> is an arbitrary integer.

The collective of such helices in the 600-cell represent a discrete [[Hopf fibration#Discrete examples|Hopf fibration]].

There are 13 Catalan solids. They are named for the [[Belgium|Belgian]] mathematician, [[Eugène Catalan]], who first described them in 1865.\n\nThe Catalan solids are all convex. They are [[face-transitive]] but not [[vertex-transitive]]. This is because the dual Archimedean solids are vertex-transitive and not face-transitive. Note that unlike [[Platonic solid]]s and [[Archimedean solid]]s, the faces of Catalan solids are ''not'' [[regular polygon]]s.  However, the [[vertex figure]]s of Catalan solids are regular, and they have constant [[dihedral angle]]s. Being face-transitive, Catalan solids are [[isohedron|isohedra]].\n\nAdditionally, two of the Catalan solids are [[edge-transitive]]: the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] and the [[rhombic triacontahedron]]. These are the [[Quasiregular polyhedron#Quasiregular duals|duals]] of the two [[Quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]] Archimedean solids.\n\nJust as [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]] and [[antiprisms]] are generally not considered Archimedean solids, so [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]] are generally not considered Catalan solids, despite being face-transitive.\n\nTwo of the Catalan solids are [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]: the [[pentagonal icositetrahedron]] and the [[pentagonal hexecontahedron]], dual to the chiral [[snub cube]] and [[snub dodecahedron]]. These each come in two [[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]. Not counting the enantiomorphs, bipyramids, and trapezohedra, there are a total of 13 Catalan solids.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!{{mvar|n}}||[[Archimedean solid]]||Catalan solid\n|-\n!1\n||[[truncated tetrahedron]]||[[triakis tetrahedron]]\n|-\n!2\n||[[truncated cube]]||[[triakis octahedron]]\n|-\n!3\n||[[truncated cuboctahedron]]||[[disdyakis dodecahedron]]\n|-\n!4\n||[[truncated octahedron]]||[[tetrakis hexahedron]]\n|-\n!5\n||[[truncated dodecahedron]]||[[triakis icosahedron]]\n|-\n!6\n||[[truncated icosidodecahedron]]||[[disdyakis triacontahedron]]\n|-\n!7\n||[[truncated icosahedron]]||[[pentakis dodecahedron]]\n|-\n!8\n||[[cuboctahedron]]||[[rhombic dodecahedron]]\n|-\n!9\n||[[icosidodecahedron]]||[[rhombic triacontahedron]]\n|-\n!10\n||[[rhombicuboctahedron]]||[[deltoidal icositetrahedron]]\n|-\n!11\n||[[rhombicosidodecahedron]]||[[deltoidal hexecontahedron]]\n|-\n!12\n||[[snub cube]]||[[pentagonal icositetrahedron]]\n|-\n!13\n||[[snub dodecahedron]]||[[pentagonal hexecontahedron]]\n|}\n\n== Symmetry ==\nThe Catalan solids, along with their dual [[Archimedean solids]], can be grouped in those with tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral symmetry.\nFor both octahedral and icosahedral symmetry there are six forms. The only Catalan solid with genuine tetrahedral symmetry is the [[triakis tetrahedron]] (dual of the [[truncated tetrahedron]]).

It is similar to [[Expansion (geometry)|expansion]], moving faces apart and outward, but also maintains the original vertices. For polyhedra, this operation adds a new hexagonal face in place of each original edge. \n\nIn [[Conway polyhedron notation]] it is represented by the letter ''c''. A polyhedron with '''e''' edges will have a chamfered form containing 2'''e''' new vertices, 3'''e''' new edges, and '''e''' new hexagonal faces.\n\n==Chamfered Platonic solids==\n\nIn the chapters below the chamfers of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are described in detail. Each is shown in a version with edges of equal length and in a canonical version where all edges touch the same [[midsphere]]. (They only look noticeably different for solids containing triangles.) The shown [[dual polyhedron|duals]] are dual to the canonical versions.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n!Seed\n|[[File:Polyhedron 4a.png|150px]] [[File:Polyhedron 4b.png|150px]] <br>[[tetrahedron|{3,3}]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron 6.png|150px]]<br>[[cube|{4,3}]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron 8.png|150px]]<br>[[octahedron|{3,4}]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron 12.png|150px]]<br>[[dodecahedron|{5,3}]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron 20.png|150px]]<br>[[icosahedron|{3,5}]]\n|- align=center\n!Chamfered\n|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4a edeq.png|150px]] [[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4b edeq.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 6 edeq.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 8 edeq.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 12 edeq.png|150px]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 20 edeq.png|150px]]\n|}\n\n=== Chamfered tetrahedron===\n\n{| class=wikitable align=\"right\" width=310\n!bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2|Chamfered tetrahedron\n|-\n|align=center colspan=2|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4a edeq max.png|300px]]<br><span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">(with equal edge length)</span>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Conway polyhedron notation|Conway notation]]||cT\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Goldberg polyhedron]]||GP<sub>III</sub>(2,0) = {3+,3}<sub>2,0</sub>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Faces||4 [[triangle]]s<BR>6 [[hexagon]]s\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Edges||24 (2 types)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Vertices||16 (2 types)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Vertex configuration]]||(12) 3.6.6<BR>(4) 6.6.6\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Symmetry group]]||[[Tetrahedral symmetry|Tetrahedral]] (''T''<sub>''d''</sub>)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Dual polyhedron]]||Alternate-triakis tetratetrahedron\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Properties||[[convex set|convex]], [[equilateral]]-faced\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center|[[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4a net.svg|100px]]<BR>[[net (polyhedron)|net]]\n|}\n\nThe '''[[chamfer]]ed tetrahedron''' (or '''alternate truncated cube''') is a [[convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron]] constructed as an [[alternation (geometry)|alternately]] [[truncated cube]] or chamfer operation on a tetrahedron, replacing its 6 edges with hexagons.\n\nIt is the [[Goldberg polyhedron]] G<sub>III</sub>(2,0), containing triangular and hexagonal faces.\n\n[[File:Polyhedron truncated 4b max.png|thumb|left|250px|The [[truncated tetrahedron]] looks similar, but its hexagons correspond to 4 of the tetrahedrons vertices, rather than to its 6 edges.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 90%;\"\n|+ Tetrahedral chamfers and related solids\n| [[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4a.png|250px]]<br>chamfered tetrahedron (canonical)\n| [[File:Polyhedron 4-4 dual.png|250px]]<br>dual of the tetratetrahedron\n| [[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4b.png|250px]]<br>chamfered tetrahedron (canonical)\n|-\n| [[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4a dual.png|250px]]<br>alternate-triakis tetratetrahedron\n| [[File:Polyhedron 4-4.png|250px]]<br>[[tetratetrahedron]]\n| [[File:Polyhedron chamfered 4b dual.png|250px]]<br>alternate-triakis tetratetrahedron\n|}\n\n{{-}}\n\n=== Chamfered cube===\n\n{| class=wikitable align=\"right\" width=310\n!bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2|Chamfered cube\n|-\n|align=center colspan=2|[[Image:Polyhedron chamfered 6 edeq max.png|300px]]<br><span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">(with equal edge length)</span>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Conway polyhedron notation|Conway notation]]||cC = t4daC\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Goldberg polyhedron]]||GP<sub>IV</sub>(2,0) = {4+,3}<sub>2,0</sub>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Faces||6 [[square (geometry)|square]]s<BR>12 [[hexagon]]s\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Edges||48 (2 types)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Vertices||32 (2 types)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Vertex configuration]]||(24) 4.6.6<BR>(8) 6.6.6\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[List of spherical symmetry groups|Symmetry]]||[[octahedral symmetry|''O''<sub>''h''</sub>]], [4,3], (*432)<BR>[[pyritohedral symmetry|''T''<sub>''h''</sub>]], [4,3<sup>+</sup>], (3*2)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Dual polyhedron]]||[[Tetrakis cuboctahedron]]\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Properties||[[convex set|convex]], [[zonohedron]], [[equilateral]]-faced\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center|[[Image:Truncated rhombic dodecahedron net.png|250px]]<BR>[[net (polyhedron)|net]]\n|}\n\nThe '''chamfered cube''' is a [[convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron]] with 32 vertices, 48 edges, and 18 faces: 12 hexagons and 6 squares.

Its dual is the [[tetrakis cuboctahedron]].\n\nIt is also inaccurately called a '''truncated rhombic dodecahedron''', although that name rather suggests a [[rhombicuboctahedron]]. It can more accurately be called a '''tetratruncated rhombic dodecahedron''' because only the order-4 vertices are truncated.\n\nThe hexagonal faces are [[equilateral]] but not [[regular polygon|regular]]. They are formed by a truncated rhombus, have 2 internal angles of about 109.47° <math>\\cos^{-1}(-\\frac{1}{3})</math> and 4 internal angles of about 125.26°, while a regular hexagon would have all 120° angles.\n\nBecause all its faces have an even number of sides with 180° rotation symmetry, it is a [[zonohedron]].

Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]\nIn [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nA chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.\n\n== Examples==\n[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|left|Left and [[right-hand rule]]s in three dimensions]]\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|+ The [[tetromino]]s S and Z are enantiomorphs in 2-dimensions\n![[File:Tetromino S.svg|100px]]<BR>S\n![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]<BR>Z\n|}\nSome chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].\n\nMany other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.\n\n==Chirality and symmetry group==\nA figure is achiral<!--sic!--> if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as <math>v\\mapsto Av+b</math> with an [[orthogonal matrix]] <math>A</math> and a vector <math>b</math>. The [[determinant]] of <math>A</math> is either 1 or &minus;1 then. If it is &minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)\n\nSee <ref>{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces.

(A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure <math>F</math> is a plane <math>P</math>, such that <math>F</math> is invariant under the mapping <math>(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,y,-z)</math>, when <math>P</math> is chosen to be the <math>x</math>-<math>y</math>-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure <math>F</math> is a point <math>C</math>, such that <math>F</math> is invariant under the mapping <math>(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)</math>, when <math>C</math> is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure\n\n:<math>F_0=\\left\\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\\right\\}</math>\n\nwhich is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry <math>(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-y,x,-z)</math> and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure\n\n:<math>F_1=\\left\\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\\right\\}</math>\n\nalso is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\nNote also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].\n\n==Chirality in two dimensions==\n[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.<br>This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]\nIn two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure <math>F</math> is a line <math>L</math>, such that <math>F</math> is invariant under the mapping <math>(x,y)\\mapsto(x,-y)</math>, when <math>L</math> is chosen to be the <math>x</math>-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.\n\nConsider the following pattern:\n:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]\n\nThis figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:\n:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]\n\nBut if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].\n\n==Knot theory==<!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] -->\n\nA [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]].

The new polyhedra are shown as maps on the surface of the cube so the topological changes are more apparent. Vertices are marked in all forms with circles.]]\nIn geometry, '''Conway polyhedron notation''', invented by [[John Horton Conway]] and promoted by [[George W. Hart]], is used to describe [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] based on a seed polyhedron modified by various prefix [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s.<ref name=\"SoT\">{{cite book|author1=John Horton Conway|author2=Heidi Burgiel|author3=Chaim Goodman-Strass| title=The Symmetries of Things|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-220-5|chapter= Chapter 21: Naming the Archimedean and Catalan polyhedra and Tilings}}</ref><ref>{{mathworld|id=ConwayPolyhedronNotation|title=Conway Polyhedron Notation}}</ref>\n\nConway and Hart extended the idea of using operators, like [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] as defined by [[Kepler]], to build related polyhedra of the same symmetry. For example, ''tC'' represents a [[truncated cube]], and ''taC'', parsed as {{tmath|t(aC)}}, is ([[topology|topologically]]) a [[truncated cuboctahedron]]. The simplest operator [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] swaps vertex and face elements; e.g., a dual cube is an octahedron: ''dC''=''O''. Applied in a series, these operators allow many higher order polyhedra to be generated. Conway defined the operators ''abdegjkmost'', while Hart added ''r'' and ''p''.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/conway_notation.html|author=George W. Hart|title=Conway Notation for Polyhedra|website=Virtual Polyhedra|date=1998}}</ref> Conway's basic operations are sufficient to generate the [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] and [[Catalan solid]]s from the Platonic solids. Some basic operations can be made as composites of others. Later implementations named further operators, sometimes referred to as \"extended\" operators.<ref name=\"Antiprism\">{{cite web|url=http://www.antiprism.com/programs/conway.html|author=Adrian Rossiter|title=conway - Conway Notation transformations|website=Antiprism Polyhedron Modelling Software}}</ref><ref name=\"Levskaya\">{{cite web|url=https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/|author=Anselm Levskaya|title=polyHédronisme}}</ref>\n \nPolyhedra can be studied topologically, in terms of how their vertices, edges, and faces connect together, or geometrically, in terms of the placement of those elements in space. Different implementations of these operators may create polyhedra that are geometrically different but topologically equivalent. These topologically equivalent polyhedra can be thought of as one of many [[graph embedding|embeddings]] of a [[polyhedral graph]] on the sphere. Unless otherwise specified, in this article (and in the literature on Conway operators in general) topology is the primary concern. Polyhedra with [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] 0 (i.e. topologically equivalent to a sphere) are often put into [[Canonical polyhedron|canonical form]] to avoid ambiguity.\n\nIn general, it is difficult to predict the result of the composite of two or more operations from a given seed polyhedron. For instance, ambo applied twice is the expand operation: ''aa'' = ''e'', while a truncation after ambo produces [[bevel]]: ''ta'' = ''b''. Many basic questions about Conway operators remain open, for instance, how many operators of a given \"size\" exist.<ref name=Brinkmann>{{Cite journal|year=2017|title=Goldberg, Fuller, Caspar, Klug and Coxeter and a general approach to local symmetry-preserving operations|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=473|issue=2206|pages=20170267|arxiv=1705.02848|last1=Brinkmann|first1=G.|last2=Goetschalckx|first2=P.|last3=Schein|first3=S.|doi=10.1098/rspa.2017.0267|bibcode=2017RSPSA.47370267B}}</ref>\n\n== Operators ==\nIn Conway's notation, operations on polyhedra are applied like functions, from right to left. For example, a [[cuboctahedron]] is an ''ambo<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/conway_notation.html |title=Conway Notation for Polyhedra| website=Virtual Polyhedra| date=1998| first=George| last=Hart}} (See fourth row in table, \"a = ambo\".)</ref> cube'', i.e. {{tmath|1=a(C) = aC}}, and a [[truncated cuboctahedron]] is {{tmath|1=t(a(C)) = t(aC) = taC}}. Repeated application of an operator can be denoted with an exponent: ''j<sup>2</sup>'' = ''o''. In general, Conway operators are not [[commutative]]. \n\nIndividual operators can be visualized in terms of \"chambers\", as below. Each white chamber is a rotated version of the others. For [[achiral]] operators, the red chambers are a reflection of the white chambers. Achiral and [[chiral]] operators are also called local symmetry-preserving operations (LSP) and local operations that preserve orientation-preserving symmetries (LOPSP), respectively, although the exact definition is a little more restrictive.<ref name=\"Brinkmann\" />\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Triangle chambers.svg\nFile:Quadrilateral chambers.svg\nFile:Pentagon chambers.svg\nFile:Hexagon chambers.svg\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n! x \n| <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  a & b & c \\\\\n  0 & d & 0 \\\\\n  a' & b' & c'\n  \\end{bmatrix}=\\mathbf{M}_x</math> \n|-\n! xd\n| <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  c & b & a \\\\\n  0 & d & 0 \\\\\n  c' & b' & a'\n  \\end{bmatrix}=\\mathbf{M}_x\\mathbf{M}_d</math> \n|-\n!dx\n| <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  a' & b' & c' \\\\\n  0 & d & 0 \\\\\n  a & b & c\n  \\end{bmatrix}=\\mathbf{M}_d\\mathbf{M}_x</math> \n|-\n!dxd\n| <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  c' & b' & a' \\\\\n  0 & d & 0 \\\\\n  c & b & a\n  \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{M}_d\\mathbf{M}_x\\mathbf{M}_d</math> \n|}\nThe relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the seed and the polyhedron created by the operations listed in this article can be expressed as a matrix <math>\\mathbf{M}_x</math>. When ''x'' is the operator, <math>v,e,f</math> are the vertices, edges, and faces of the seed (respectively), and <math>v',e',f'</math> are the vertices, edges, and faces of the result, then \n\n:<math>\\mathbf{M}_x \\begin{bmatrix} v \\\\ e \\\\ f \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v' \\\\ e' \\\\ f' \\end{bmatrix}</math>.\n\nThe matrix for the composition of two operators is just the product of the matrixes for the two operators. Distinct operators may have the same matrix, for example, ''p'' and ''l''. The edge count of the result is an integer multiple ''d'' of that of the seed: this is called the inflation rate, or the edge factor.<ref name=\"Brinkmann\" />\n\nThe simplest operators, the [[identity operator]] ''S'' and the [[Dual polyhedron|dual operator]] ''d'', have simple matrix forms:\n: <math>\\mathbf{M}_S = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{I}_3</math>, <math>\\mathbf{M}_d = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}</math>\nTwo dual operators cancel out; ''dd'' = ''S'', and the square of <math>\\mathbf{M}_d</math> is the [[identity matrix]]. When applied to other operators, the dual operator corresponds to horizontal and vertical reflections of the matrix. Operators can be grouped into groups of four (or fewer if some forms are the same) by identifying the operators ''x'', ''xd'' (operator of dual), ''dx'' (dual of operator), and ''dxd'' (conjugate of operator). In this article, only the matrix for ''x'' is given, since the others are simple reflections.\n\nHart introduced the reflection operator ''r'', that gives the mirror image of the polyhedron.{{cn|date=October 2018 <!--Hart 1998?-->}} This is not strictly a LOPSP, since it does not preserve orientation (it reverses it). ''r'' has no effect on achiral seeds, and ''rr'' returns the original seed. An overline can be used to indicate the other chiral form of an operator, like {{overline|''s''}} = ''rsr''. ''r'' does not affect the matrix.\n\nAn operation is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a composition of operators aside from ''d'' and ''r''. The majority of Conway's original operators are irreducible: the exceptions are ''e'', ''b'', ''o'', and ''m''.\n\nSome open questions about Conway operators include:<ref name=\"Brinkmann\" />\n* Are there two non-equivalent series of operations, not related by ''d'' or ''r'', that create the same polyhedron from the same seed?\n* How many Conway operators exist for a given inflation rate?\n* Can an algorithm be developed to generate all the Conway operators for a given inflation rate?\n* Can an algorithm be developed to decompose a given polyhedron into a series of operations on a smaller seed?\n\n== Original operations ==\nStrictly, seed (''S''), needle (''n''), and zip (''z'') were not included by Conway, but they are related to original Conway operations by duality so are included here.\n\nFrom here on, operations are visualized on cube seeds, drawn on the surface of that cube. Blue faces cross edges of the seed, and pink faces lie over vertices of the seed. There is some flexibility in the exact placement of vertices, especially with chiral operators. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Original Conway operators\n|-\n!

They may be applied to any independent subset of faces, or may be converted into a ''join''-form by removing the original edges. Conway notation supports an optional index to these operators: 0 for the join-form, or 3 or higher for how many sides affected faces have. For example, ''k''<sub>4</sub>''Y''<sub>4</sub>=O: taking a square-based pyramid and gluing another pyramid to the square base gives an octahedron.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n!Operator||k||l||L||K||(kk)\n|-\n!x\n|[[File:Conway_kC.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Conway_lC.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Conway_LC.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Conway_KC.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Conway kkC.png|80px]]\n|-\n!x<sub>0</sub>\n|[[File:Conway_jC.png|80px]]<br>''k''<sub>0</sub> = ''j''\n|[[File:Conway_cC.png|80px]]<br>''l''<sub>0</sub> = ''c''\n|[[File:Conway L0C.png|80px]]<br>''L''<sub>0</sub>\n|[[File:Conway_K0C.png|80px]]<br>''K''<sub>0</sub> = ''jk''\n|[[File:Conway (kk)0C.png|80px]]<br>{{tmath|1=(kk)_0}}\n|- align=center\n!Augmentation\n||[[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]]||[[Prism (geometry)|Prism]]||[[Antiprism]]||||\n|}\n\nThe truncate operator ''t'' also has an index form ''t<sub>n</sub>'', indicating that only vertices of a certain degree are truncated. It is equivalent to ''dk<sub>n</sub>d''.\n\nSome of the extended operators can be created in special cases with ''k<sub>n</sub>'' and ''t<sub>n</sub>'' operators. For example, a [[chamfered cube]], ''cC'', can be constructed as ''t''<sub>4</sub>''daC'', as a [[rhombic dodecahedron]], ''daC'' or ''jC'', with its degree-4 vertices truncated. A lofted cube, ''lC'' is the same as ''t''<sub>4</sub>''kC''. A quinto-dodecahedron, ''qD'' can be constructed as ''t''<sub>5</sub>''daaD'' or ''t''<sub>5</sub>''deD'' or ''t''<sub>5</sub>''oD'', a [[deltoidal hexecontahedron]], ''deD'' or ''oD'', with its degree-5 vertices truncated.\n\n===Meta/Bevel===\nMeta adds vertices at the center and along the edges, while bevel adds faces at the center, seed vertices, and along the edges. The index is how many vertices or faces are added along the edges. Meta (in its non-indexed form) is also called [[cantitruncation]] or [[omnitruncation]]. Note that 0 here does not mean the same as for augmentation operations: it means zero vertices (or faces) are added along the edges.<ref name=\"Antiprism\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Meta/Bevel operators\n|-\n!  n !!

The index 1 form is identical to Conway's ortho and expand operators: expand is also called [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellation]] and [[Expansion (geometry)|expansion]].

This construction can be extended to any face by identifying the chambers of the triangle or square (the \"master polygon\").<ref name=\"Brinkmann\" /> Operators in the triangular family can be used to produce the [[Goldberg polyhedra]] and [[geodesic polyhedra]]: see [[List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra]] for formulas.\n\nThe two families are the triangular GC family, ''c<sub>a,b</sub>'' and ''u<sub>a,b</sub>'', and the quadrilateral GC family, ''e<sub>a,b</sub>'' and ''o<sub>a,b</sub>''. Both the GC families are indexed by two integers <math>a \\ge 1</math> and <math>b \\ge 0</math>. They possess many nice qualities:\n* The indexes of the families have a relationship with certain [[Euclidean domain]]s over the complex numbers: the [[Eisenstein integers]] for the triangular GC family, and the [[Gaussian integers]] for the quadrilateral GC family.\n* Operators in the ''x'' and ''dxd'' columns within the same family commute with each other.\n\nThe operators are divided into three classes (examples are written in terms of ''c'' but apply to all 4 operators):\n* Class I: {{tmath|1=b=0}}. Achiral, preserves original edges. Can be written with the zero index suppressed, e.g. ''c''<sub>''a'',0</sub> = ''c<sub>a</sub>''.\n* Class II: {{tmath|1=a=b}}. Also achiral. Can be decomposed as ''c<sub>a,a</sub>'' = ''c<sub>a</sub>c''<sub>1,1</sub>\n* Class III: All other operators. These are chiral, and ''c<sub>a,b</sub>'' and ''c<sub>b,a</sub>'' are the chiral pairs of each other.\n\nOf the original Conway operations, the only ones that do not fall into the GC family are ''g'' and ''s'' (gyro and snub). Meta and bevel (''m'' and ''b'') can be expressed in terms of one operator from the triangular family and one from the quadrilateral family.\n\n==== Triangular ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Triangular Goldberg-Coxeter operators\n|-\n!  a !! b !!

In the case of a cuboid this gives 6&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp; =&nbsp;12&nbsp;+&nbsp;2; that is, like a cube, a cuboid has 6 [[Face (geometry)|faces]], 8 [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], and 12 edges. \nAlong with the rectangular cuboids, any [[parallelepiped]] is a cuboid of this type, as is a square [[frustum]] (the shape formed by truncation of the apex of a [[square pyramid]]).\n\n==Rectangular cuboid==\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\"  style=\"background:#fff; float:right; margin-left:10px; width:250px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\" colspan=\"2\"|Rectangular cuboid\n|- \n|colspan=2|[[File:Cuboid simple.svg|240px|Rectangular cuboid]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#aeae74;\"|Type||[[Prism (geometry)|Prism]]<BR>[[Plesiohedron]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|Faces||6 [[rectangle]]s\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|Edges||12\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|Vertices||8\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|[[List of spherical symmetry groups|Symmetry group]]||[[Dihedral symmetry|''D''<sub>''2h''</sub>]], [2,2], (*222), order 8\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|[[Schläfli symbol]]||{&nbsp;}&nbsp;×&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;×&nbsp;{&nbsp;}\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|[[Coxeter diagram]]||{{CDD|node_1|2|node_1|2|node_1}}\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|[[Dual polyhedron]]||Rectangular fusil\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\"|Properties||[[Convex polyhedron|convex]], [[zonohedron]], [[isogonal figure|isogonal]]\n|} In a rectangular cuboid, all angles are [[right angle]]s, and opposite faces of a cuboid are [[congruence (geometry)|equal]].  By definition this makes it a '''right rectangular [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]''', and the terms ''rectangular [[parallelepiped]]'' or ''orthogonal parallelepiped'' are also used to designate this polyhedron.  The terms \"rectangular prism\" and \"oblong prism\", however, are ambiguous, since they do not specify all angles.\n\nThe '''square cuboid''', '''square box''', or '''right square prism''' (also ambiguously called ''square prism'') is a special case of the cuboid in which at least two faces are squares. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] {4}&nbsp;×&nbsp;{&nbsp;}, and its symmetry is doubled from [2,2] to [4,2], order 16.\n\nThe [[cube (geometry)|cube]] is a special case of the square cuboid in which all six faces are squares.

If the triangles are [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] and the rectangles are [[Square (geometry)|square]]s, while the base and its opposite face are [[regular polygons]], the [[triangular cupola|triangular]], [[square cupola|square]], and [[pentagonal cupola|pentagonal]] cupolae all count among the [[Johnson solid]]s, and can be formed by taking sections of the [[cuboctahedron]], [[rhombicuboctahedron]], and [[rhombicosidodecahedron]], respectively.\n\nA cupola can be seen as a [[prism (geometry)|prism]] where one of the polygons has been collapsed in half by merging alternate vertices.\n\nA cupola can be given an extended [[Schläfli symbol]] {''n''} &#124;&#124; t{''n''}, representing a [[regular polygon]] {n} joined by a parallel of its [[Truncation (geometry)#Truncation of polygons|truncation]], t{n} or {2n}.\n\nCupolae are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.\n\nIts dual contains a shape that is sort of a weld between half of an ''n''-sided [[trapezohedron]] and a ''2n''-sided [[pyramid]].\n\n==Examples==\n{{Cupolae}}\n\n[[Image:Tile 3464.svg|thumb|Plane \"[[hexagon]]al cupolae\" in the [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]]]]\nThe above-mentioned three polyhedra are the only non-trivial convex cupolae with regular faces: The \"[[hexagon]]al cupola\" is a plane figure, and the [[triangular prism]] might be considered a \"cupola\" of degree&nbsp;2 (the cupola of a line segment and a square). However, cupolae of higher-degree polygons may be constructed with [[Regular polygon#Taxonomic classification|irregular]] triangular and rectangular faces.\n\n==Coordinates of the vertices==\n[[File:Cupola_40.png|thumb|left|A 40-sided cupola has 40 isosceles triangles (blue), 40 rectangles (yellow), a top regular [[tetracontagon|40-gon]] (red) and a bottom regular [[octacontagon|80-gon]] (hidden).]]\nThe definition of the cupola does not require the base (or the side opposite the base, which can be called the top) to be a regular polygon, but it is convenient to consider the case where the cupola has its maximal symmetry, C<sub>''n''v</sub>. In that case, the top is a regular ''n''-gon, while the base is either a regular 2''n''-gon or a 2''n''-gon which has two different side lengths alternating and the same angles as a regular 2''n''-gon. It is convenient to fix the coordinate system so that the base lies in the ''xy''-plane, with the top in a plane parallel to the ''xy''-plane. The ''z''-axis is the ''n''-fold axis, and the mirror planes pass through the ''z''-axis and bisect the sides of the base. They also either bisect the sides or the angles of the top polygon, or both. (If ''n'' is even, half of the mirror planes bisect the sides of the top polygon and half bisect the angles, while if ''n'' is odd, each mirror plane bisects one side and one angle of the top polygon.) The vertices of the base can be designated V<sub>1</sub> through V<sub>2''n''</sub>, while the vertices of the top polygon can be designated V<sub>2''n''+1</sub> through V<sub>3''n''</sub>. With these conventions, the coordinates of the vertices can be written as:\n*''V''<sub>2''j''−1</sub>: (''r<sub>b</sub>'' cos[2π(''j'' − 1) / ''n'' + α], ''r<sub>b</sub>'' sin[2π(''j'' − 1) / ''n'' + α], 0)\n*''V''<sub>2''j''</sub>: (''r<sub>b</sub>'' cos(2π''j'' / ''n'' − α), ''r<sub>b</sub>'' sin(2π''j'' / ''n'' − α), 0)\n*''V''<sub>2''n''+''j''</sub>: (''r<sub>t</sub>'' cos(π''j'' / ''n''), ''r<sub>t</sub>'' sin(π''j'' / ''n''), ''h'')\n\nwhere ''j'' = 1, 2, ..., ''n''.\n\nSince the polygons ''V''<sub>1</sub>''V''<sub>2</sub>''V''<sub>2''n''+2</sub>''V''<sub>2''n''+1</sub>, etc. are rectangles, this puts a constraint on the values of ''r<sub>b</sub>'', ''r<sub>t</sub>'', and α. The distance ''V''<sub>1</sub>''V''<sub>2</sub> is equal to\n:''r<sub>b</sub>''{[cos(2π / ''n'' − α) − cos α]<sup>2</sup> + [sin(2π / ''n'' − α) − sin α]<sup>2</sup>}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n:= ''r<sub>b</sub>''{[cos<sup>2</sup>(2π / ''n'' − α) − 2cos(2π / ''n'' − α)cos α + cos<sup>2</sup> α] + [sin<sup>2</sup>(2π / ''n'' − α) − 2sin(2π / ''n'' − α)sin α + sin<sup>2</sup> α]}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n:= ''r<sub>b</sub>''{2[1 − cos(2π / ''n'' − α)cos α − sin(2π / ''n'' − α)sin α]}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n:= ''r<sub>b</sub>''{2[1 − cos(2π / ''n'' − 2α)]}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n\nwhile the distance ''V''<sub>2''n''+1</sub>''V''<sub>2''n''+2</sub> is equal to\n:''r<sub>t</sub>''{[cos(π / ''n'') − 1]<sup>2</sup> + sin<sup>2</sup>(π / ''n'')}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n:= ''r<sub>t</sub>''{[cos<sup>2</sup>(π / ''n'') − 2cos(π / ''n'') + 1] + sin<sup>2</sup>(π / ''n'')}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n:= ''r<sub>t</sub>''{2[1 − cos(π / ''n'')]}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>.\n\nThese are to be equal, and if this common edge is denoted by ''s'',\n:''r<sub>b</sub>'' = ''s'' / {2[1 − cos(2π / n − 2α)]}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n:r<sub>t</sub> = ''s'' / {2[1 − cos(π / ''n'')]}<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>\n\nThese values are to be inserted into the expressions for the coordinates of the vertices given earlier.\n\n== Star-cupolae ==\n{{Star-cupolae}}\n{{Star-cupoloids}}\nStar cupolae exist for all bases {''n''/''d''} where <sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<sup>''n''</sup>/<sub>''d''</sub>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6 and ''d'' is odd. At the limits the cupolae collapse into plane figures: beyond the limits the triangles and squares can no longer span the distance between the two polygons. When ''d'' is even, the bottom base {2''n''/''d''} becomes degenerate: we can form a ''cuploid'' or ''semicupola'' by withdrawing this degenerate face and instead letting the triangles and squares connect to each other here. In particular, the [[tetrahemihexahedron]] may be seen as a {3/2}-cuploid. The cupolae are all [[orientability|orientable]], while the cuploids are all nonorientable. When ''n''/''d'' > 2 in a cuploid, the triangles and squares do not cover the entire base, and a small membrane is left in the base that simply covers empty space. Hence the {5/2} and {7/2} cuploids pictured above have membranes (not filled in), while the {5/4} and {7/4} cuploids pictured above do not.\n\nThe height ''h'' of an {''n''/''d''}-cupola or cuploid is given by the formula\n<math>h = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{4 \\sin^{2} (\\frac{\\pi d}{n})}}</math>. In particular, ''h'' = 0 at the limits of ''n''/''d'' = 6 and ''n''/''d'' = 6/5, and ''h'' is maximized at ''n''/''d'' = 2 (the triangular prism, where the triangles are upright).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orchidpalms.com/polyhedra/cupolas/cupola1.html|title=cupolas|author=|date=|website=www.orchidpalms.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orchidpalms.com/polyhedra/cupolas/cupola2.html|title=semicupolas|author=|date=|website=www.orchidpalms.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the images above, the star cupolae have been given a consistent colour scheme to aid identifying their faces: the base ''n''/''d''-gon is red, the base 2''n''/''d''-gon is yellow, the squares are blue, and the triangles are green.

For ''n''=2, the top digon face is reduced to a single edge. The vertices of the top polygon are aligned with vertices in the lower polygon. The symmetry is C<sub>''n''v</sub>, order 2''n''.\n\nAn anticupola can't be constructed with all regular faces, although some can be made regular. If the top ''n''-gon and triangles are regular, the base 2''n''-gon can not be planar and regular. In such a case, ''n''=6 generates a regular hexagon and surrounding equilateral triangles of a [[snub hexagonal tiling]], which can be closed into a zero volume polygon with the base a symmetric 12-gon shaped like a larger hexagon, having adjacent pairs of [[Collinearity|colinear]] edges.\n\nTwo anticupola can be augmented together on their base as a [[bianticupola]].\n\n{| class=wikitable width=400\n|+ Family of convex anticupolae\n|-\n!n||2 !!3 !!4 !!5 !!6...\n|-\n!Name || s{2} <nowiki>||</nowiki> t{2} || s{3} <nowiki>||</nowiki> t{3} || s{4} <nowiki>||</nowiki> t{4} || s{5} <nowiki>||</nowiki> t{5} || s{6} <nowiki>||</nowiki> t{6} \n|- align=center\n!Image\n|valign=bottom|[[File:Digonal anticupola.png|80px]]<BR>Digonal\n|valign=bottom|[[File:triangular anticupola.png|80px]]<BR>Triangular\n|valign=bottom|[[File:square anticupola.png|80px]]<BR>Square\n|valign=bottom|[[File:Pentagonal anticupola.png|80px]]<BR>Pentagonal\n|valign=bottom|[[File:Hexagonal anticupola.png|80px]]<BR>Hexagonal\n|- align=center\n!Transparent\n|[[File:Digonal anticupola-trans.png|70px]]\n|[[File:triangular anticupola-trans.png|80px]]\n|[[File:square anticupola-trans.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Pentagonal anticupola-trans.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Hexagonal anticupola-trans.png|80px]]\n|- align=center\n!Net\n|[[File:Digonal anticupola_net.png|80px]]\n|[[File:triangular anticupola_net.png|80px]]\n|[[File:square anticupola_net.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Pentagonal anticupola_net.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Hexagonal anticupola_net.png|80px]]\n|}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Hypercupolae==\nThe '''hypercupolae''' or '''polyhedral cupolae''' are a family of convex nonuniform polychora (here four-dimensional figures), analogous to the cupolas.

      "text": "{{distinguish|Dehn function}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''Dehn invariant''' of a [[polyhedron]] is a value used to determine whether polyhedra can be [[dissection problem|dissected]] into each other or whether they can [[Honeycomb (geometry)|tile space]]. It is named after [[Max Dehn]], who used it to solve [[Hilbert's third problem]] on whether all polyhedra with equal volume could be dissected into each other.\n\nTwo polyhedra have a dissection into polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into either one, if and only if their volumes and Dehn invariants are equal.\nA polyhedron can be cut up and reassembled to tile space if and only if its Dehn invariant is zero, so having Dehn invariant zero is a necessary condition for being a space-filling polyhedron.\nIt is also an open problem whether the Dehn invariant of a self-intersection free [[flexible polyhedron]] is invariant as it flexes. \n\nThe Dehn invariant is zero for the [[cube]] but nonzero for the other [[Platonic solid]]s, implying that the other solids cannot tile space and that they cannot be dissected into a cube. All of the [[Archimedean solid]]s have Dehn invariants that are rational combinations of the invariants for the Platonic solids. In particular, the [[truncated octahedron]] also tiles space and has Dehn invariant zero like the cube.\n\nThe Dehn invariants of polyhedra are elements of an infinite-dimensional [[vector space]]. As an [[abelian group]], this space is part of an [[exact sequence]] involving [[group homology]].\nSimilar invariants can also be defined for some other [[dissection puzzle]]s, including the problem of dissecting [[rectilinear polygon]]s into each other by axis-parallel cuts and translations.\n\n==Background==\nIn two dimensions, the [[Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem]] states that any two [[polygon]]s of equal area can be cut up into polygonal pieces and reassembled into each other. [[David Hilbert]] became interested in this result as a way to axiomatize [[area]], in connection with [[Hilbert's axioms]] for [[Euclidean geometry]]. In [[Hilbert's third problem]], he posed the question of whether two polyhedra of equal volumes can always be cut into polyhedral pieces and reassembled into each other. Hilbert's student [[Max Dehn]], in his 1900 [[habilitation]] thesis, invented the Dehn invariant in order to provide a negative solution to Hilbert's problem. Although Dehn formulated his invariant differently,\nthe modern approach is to describe it as a value in a [[Tensor product of modules|tensor product]], following {{harvtxt|Jessen|1968}}.<ref name=\"ds00\">{{citation\n | last1 = Dupont | first1 = Johan L.\n | last2 = Sah | first2 = Chih-Han\n | contribution = Three questions about simplices in spherical and hyperbolic 3-space\n | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4612-1340-6_3\n | mr = 1731633\n | pages = 49–76\n | publisher = Birkhäuser Boston, Boston, MA\n | series = Gelfand Math.

By [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy's rigidity theorem]], they must be non-convex, and it is known (the [[Bellows conjecture|\"bellows theorem\"]]) that the volume of the polyhedron must stay constant throughout this motion. A stronger version of this theorem is conjectured, stating that the Dehn invariant of such a polyhedron must also remain invariant throughout any continuous motion. This conjecture is called the \"[[strong bellows conjecture]]\". It is known to be true for the first known flexible polyhedra, the (self-intersecting) [[Bricard octahedron|Bricard octahedra]], and for a non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedron derived from them, [[Steffen's polyhedron]].<ref name=\"alexandrov\">{{citation\n | last = Alexandrov | first = Victor\n | arxiv = 0901.2989\n | doi = 10.1007/s00022-011-0061-7\n | issue = 1–2\n | journal = Journal of Geometry\n | mr = 2823098\n | pages = 1–13\n | title = The Dehn invariants of the Bricard octahedra\n | volume = 99\n | year = 2010}}.</ref>\nFor more complicated polyhedra with self-intersections the \"strong bellows conjecture\" is known to be false.<ref name=\"alexandrov_and_connelly\">{{citation\n | last1 = Alexandrov | first1 = Victor\n | last2 = Connelly | first2 = Robert | author2-link = Robert Connelly\n | arxiv = 0905.3683\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Illinois Journal of Mathematics\n | mr = 3006683\n | pages = 127–155\n | title = Flexible suspensions with a hexagonal equator\n | volume = 55\n | year = 2011| doi = 10.1215/ijm/1355927031\n }}.</ref> However, it remains an open problem for flexible polyhedra that have no self-intersections.\n\nThe total [[mean curvature]] of a polyhedral surface has been defined as the sum over the edges of the edge lengths multiplied by the exterior dihedral angles.

In this context, the partitioning is called simply a '''dissection''' (of one polytope into another).

This process ''is'' possible, however, for any two [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]] (such as [[cube]]) in three dimension and any two [[zonohedra]] of equal volume (in any dimension).\n\nA dissection into [[triangle]]s of equal area is called an [[equidissection]].

Vertices of one correspond to faces of the other, and edges correspond to each other.]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], any [[polyhedron]] is associated with a second '''dual''' figure, where the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of one correspond to the [[face (geometry)|face]]s of the other and the edges between pairs of vertices of one correspond to the edges between pairs of faces of the other.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}}, \"Basic notions about stellation and duality\", p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Such dual figures remain combinatorial or [[abstract polytope|abstract polyhedra]], but not all are also geometric polyhedra.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}</ref> Starting with any given polyhedron, the dual of its dual is the original polyhedron.\n\nDuality preserves the [[symmetry|symmetries]] of a polyhedron. Therefore, for many classes of polyhedra defined by their symmetries, the duals also belong to a symmetric class. Thus, the regular polyhedra{{snd}}the (convex) [[Platonic solid]]s and (star) [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]{{snd}}form dual pairs, where the regular [[tetrahedron]] is [[#Self-dual polyhedra|self-dual]].  The dual of an isogonal polyhedron, having equivalent vertices, is one which is isohedral, having equivalent faces. The dual of an  [[isotoxal figure|isotoxal]] polyhedron (having equivalent edges) is also isotoxal.\n\nDuality is closely related to ''reciprocity'' or ''polarity'', a geometric transformation that, when applied to a convex polyhedron, realizes the dual polyhedron as another convex polyhedron.\n\n==Kinds of duality==\n[[File:Ioanniskepplerih00kepl 0271 crop.jpg|thumb|400px|The dual of a [[Platonic solid]] can be constructed by connecting the face centers. In general this creates only a [[#Topological duality|topological dual]].<br>Images from [[Kepler]]'s [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619)]]\n\nThere are many kinds of duality. The kinds most relevant to elementary polyhedra are polar reciprocity and topological or abstract duality.\n\n===Polar reciprocation===\n{{See also|Polar reciprocation}}\n\nThe dual of polyhedron ''P'' is often defined in terms of [[polar reciprocation]] about a sphere. Here, each vertex (pole) is associated with a face plane (polar plane or just polar) so that the ray from the center to the vertex is perpendicular to the plane, and the product of the distances from the center to each is equal to the square of the radius.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cundy|Rollett|1961}}, 3.2 Duality, pp.&nbsp;78–79; {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}}, Pages 3-5. (Note, Wenninger's discussion includes nonconvex polyhedra.)</ref>\n\nWhen the sphere has radius ''r'' and is centered at the origin, i.e. defined by equation <math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2,</math> and ''P'' is a convex polyhedron then its polar dual is defined as\n\n:<math>P^\\circ = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid y \\cdot x \\leq r^2 \\text{ for all } x \\in P \\}</math>\nwhere ''y''·''x'' denotes the standard [[dot product]] of ''y'' and ''x''.  Typically when no sphere is specified in the construction of the dual, then the unit sphere is used, meaning ''r'' = 1 in the above definition.<ref>{{harvtxt|Barvinok|2002}}, Page 143.</ref>\n\nFor each face of ''P'' described by the linear equation\n:<math>x_0x + y_0y + z_0z = r^2,</math>\nthe dual polyhedron ''P''° will have a vertex (''x''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>0</sub>,''z''<sub>0</sub>).  Similarly, each vertex of ''P'' corresponds to a face of ''P''°, and each edge of ''P'' corresponds to an edge of ''P''°.  The correspondence between the vertices, edges and faces of ''P'' and ''P''° reverses inclusion.  For example if an edge of ''P'' contains a vertex, the corresponding edge of ''P''° will be contained in the corresponding face.\n\n\nFor the more symmetrical polyhedra having an obvious centroid, it is common to make the polyhedron and sphere concentric, as in the Dorman Luke construction described below.\nHowever, it is possible to reciprocate a polyhedron about any sphere, and the resulting form of the dual will depend on the size and position of the sphere; as the sphere is varied, so too is the dual form. The choice of center for the sphere is sufficient to define the dual up to similarity. If multiple symmetry axes are present, they will necessarily intersect at a single point, and this is usually taken to be the centroid.  Failing that, a circumscribed sphere, inscribed sphere, or midsphere (one with all edges as tangents) is commonly used.\n\nIf a polyhedron in [[Euclidean space]] has an element passing through the center of the sphere, the corresponding element of its dual will go to infinity. Since Euclidean space never reaches infinity, the projective equivalent, called extended Euclidean space, may be formed by adding the required 'plane at infinity'. Some theorists prefer to stick to Euclidean space and say that there is no dual. Meanwhile, {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}} found a way to represent these infinite duals, in a manner suitable for making  models (of some finite portion!).\n\nThe concept of ''duality'' here is closely related to the [[duality (projective geometry)|duality]] in [[projective geometry]], where lines and edges are interchanged. Projective polarity works well enough for convex polyhedra. But for non-convex figures such as star polyhedra, when we seek to rigorously define this form of polyhedral duality in terms of projective polarity, various problems appear.<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|2013}}, and {{harvtxt|Gailiunas|Sharp|2005}}. {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}} also discusses some issues on the way to deriving his infinite duals.</ref> \nBecause of the definitional issues for geometric duality of non-convex polyhedra, {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2007}} argues that any proper definition of a non-convex polyhedron should include a notion of a dual polyhedron.\n\n====Canonical duals====\n[[File:Dual compound 6-8 max.png|thumb|Canonical dual [[Polytope compound#Dual compounds|Compound]] of the cuboctahedron (light) and rhombic dodecahedron (dark). Pairs of edges meet on their common [[intersphere]].]]\n\nAny convex polyhedron can be distorted into a [[canonical polyhedron|canonical form]], in which a unit [[midsphere]] (or intersphere) exists tangent to every edge, and such that the average position of the points of tangency is the center of the sphere. This form is unique up to congruences.\n\nIf we reciprocate such a canonical polyhedron about its midsphere, the dual polyhedron will share the same edge-tangency points and so must also be canonical. It is the canonical dual, and the two together form a canonical dual pair.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2007}}, Theorem 3.1, p.&nbsp;449.</ref>\n\n===Topological duality===\nEven when a pair of polyhedra cannot be obtained by reciprocation from each other, they may be called duals of each other as long as the vertices of one correspond to the faces of the other, and the edges of one correspond to the edges of the other, in an incidence-preserving way. Such pairs of polyhedra are still topologically or abstractly dual.\n\nThe vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron form a [[graph theory|graph]] (the [[n-skeleton|1-skeleton]] of the polyhedron), embedded on a topological sphere, the surface of the polyhedron.\nThe same graph can be projected to form a [[Schlegel diagram]] on a flat plane. The graph formed by the edges and vertices of the dual polyhedron is its [[dual graph]]. More generally, for any polyhedron whose faces form a closed surface, the vertices and edges of the polyhedron form a graph embedded on this surface, and the vertices and edges of the (abstract) dual polyhedron form the dual graph.\n\nAn [[Abstract polytope|abstract polyhedron]] is a certain kind of [[partially ordered set]] (poset) of elements, such that adjacencies, or connections, between elements of the set correspond to adjacencies between elements (faces, edges, etc.) of a polyhedron. Every such poset has a dual poset, formed by reversing all of the order relations. If the poset is visualized as a [[Hasse diagram]], the dual poset may be visualized simply by turning the Hasse diagram upside down.\nEvery geometric polyhedron corresponds to an abstract polyhedron in this way, and has an abstract dual polyhedron. However, for some types of non-convex geometric polyhedron, the dual polyhedron may not be realized geometrically.\n\n==Dorman Luke construction==\nFor a [[uniform polyhedron]], the face of the dual polyhedron may be found from the original polyhedron's [[vertex figure]] using the '''Dorman Luke''' construction.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cundy|Rollett|1961}}, p.&nbsp; 117; {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}}, p.&nbsp;30.</ref>\n\nAs an example, the illustration below shows the vertex figure (red) of the [[cuboctahedron]] being used to derive a face (blue) of the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].\n\n[[Image:DormanLuke.svg]]\n\nBefore beginning the construction, the [[vertex figure]] ''ABCD'' is obtained by cutting each connected edge at (in this case) its midpoint.\n\nDorman Luke's construction then proceeds:\n\n:#Draw the vertex figure ''ABCD''\n:#Draw the circumcircle (tangent to every corner ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'').\n:#Draw lines tangent to the circumcircle at each corner ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D''.\n:#Mark the points ''E'', ''F'', ''G'', ''H'', where each tangent line meets the adjacent tangent.\n:#The polygon ''EFGH'' is a face of the dual polyhedron.\n\nIn this example the size of the vertex figure was chosen so that its circumcircle lies on the [[intersphere]] of the cuboctahedron, which also becomes the intersphere of the dual rhombic dodecahedron.\n\nDorman Luke's construction can only be used where a polyhedron has such an intersphere and the vertex figure is cyclic. For instance, it can be applied to the [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]].\n\n==Self-dual polyhedra==\nTopologically, a self-dual polyhedron is one whose dual has exactly the same connectivity between vertices, edges and faces. Abstractly, they have the same Hasse diagram.\n \nA geometrically '''self-dual polyhedron''' is not only topologically self-dual, but its polar reciprocal about a certain point, typically its centroid, is a similar figure. For example, the dual of a regular tetrahedron is another regular tetrahedron, [[reflection through the origin|reflected through the origin]].\n\nEvery polygon is topologically self-dual (it has the same number of vertices as edges, and these are switched by duality), but will not in general be geometrically self-dual (up to rigid motion, for instance). Every polygon has a [[regular polygon|regular form]] which is geometrically self-dual about its intersphere: all angles are congruent, as are all edges, so under duality these congruences swap.\n\nSimilarly, every topologically self-dual convex polyhedron can be realized by an equivalent geometrically self-dual polyhedron, its [[canonical polyhedron]], reciprocal about the center of the [[midsphere]].\n\nThere are infinitely many geometrically self-dual polyhedra. The simplest infinite family are the canonical [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] of ''n'' sides. Another infinite family, [[elongated pyramid]]s, consists of polyhedra that can be roughly described as a pyramid sitting on top of a [[prism (geometry)|prism]] (with the same number of sides). Adding a frustum (pyramid with the top cut off) below the prism generates another infinite family, and so on.\n\nThere are many other convex, self-dual polyhedra. For example, there are 6 different ones with 7 vertices, and 16 with 8 vertices.<ref>3D [[Java (programming language)|Java]] models at [http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/SymmetricSelfDuals.html Symmetries of Canonical Self-Dual Polyhedra], based on paper by Gunnar Brinkmann, Brendan D.

The regular compound of two [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], known as the [[Stella octangula]], is the only regular compound with this property.\n\n==Dual polytopes and tessellations==\nDuality can be generalized to ''n''-dimensional space and '''dual [[polytope]]s;''' in two dimension these are called [[dual polygon]]s.\n\nThe vertices of one polytope correspond to the (''n'' &minus; 1)-dimensional elements, or facets, of the other, and the ''j'' points that define a (''j'' &minus; 1)-dimensional element will correspond to ''j'' hyperplanes that intersect to give a (''n'' &minus; ''j'')-dimensional element. The dual of an ''n''-dimensional tessellation or [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] can be defined similarly.\n\nIn general, the facets of a polytope's dual will be the topological duals of the polytope's vertex figures. For the polar reciprocals of the [[regular polytope|regular]] and [[Uniform polytope|uniform]] polytopes, the dual facets will be polar reciprocals of the original's vertex figure. For example, in four dimensions, the vertex figure of the [[600-cell]] is the [[Regular icosahedron|icosahedron]];  the dual of the 600-cell is the [[120-cell]], whose facets are [[dodecahedron|dodecahedra]], which are the dual of the icosahedron.\n\n===Self-dual polytopes and tessellations===\n[[File:Kah 4 4.png|thumb|The [[square tiling]], {4,4}, is self-dual, as shown by these red and blue tilings]]\n[[File:Infinite-order apeirogonal tiling and dual.png|thumb|The [[Infinite-order apeirogonal tiling]], {&infin;,&infin;} in red, and its dual position in blue]]\nThe primary class of self-dual polytopes are [[regular polytope]]s with [[palindromic]] [[Schläfli symbol]]s.

Starting with the regular [[octahedron]], it is [[Elongated polyhedron|elongated]] along one axes, adding 8 new triangles. It has 2 sets of 3 coplanar equilateral triangles (each forming a half-[[hexagon]]), and thus is not a [[Johnson solid]]. \n\nIf the sets of coplanar triangles are considered a single [[isosceles trapezoid]]al face (a [[triamond]]), it has 8 vertices, 14 edges, and 8 faces - 4 triangles [[File:Polyiamond-1-1.svg|20px]] and 4 triamonds [[File:Polyiamond-3-1.svg|40px]]. This construction has been called a '''triamond stretched octahedron'''.<ref>[http://www.interocitors.com/polyhedra/Triamonds Convex Triamond Regular Polyhedra]</ref>\n\n== As a folded hexahedron ==\nAnother interpretation can represent this solid as a [[hexahedron]], by considering pairs of trapezoids as a folded regular [[hexagon]]. It will have 6 faces (4 triangles, and 2 hexagons), 12 edges, and 8 vertices. \n\nIt could also be seen as a ''folded tetrahedron'' also seeing pairs of end triangles as a folded rhombus. It would have 8 vertices, 10 edges, and 4 faces.\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\n\nThe [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the 8 vertices of an ''elongated octahedron'', elongated in the x-axis, with edge length 2 are:\n: ( ±1, 0, ±2 )\n: ( ±2, ±1, 0 ).\n\nThe 2 extra vertices of the [[deltahedron|deltahedral]] variation are: \n: ( 0, ±1, 0 ).\n\n== Related polyhedra and honeycombs ==\n\nIn the special case, where the trapezoid faces are [[square]]s or [[rectangle]]s, the pairs of triangles becoming coplanar and the polyhedron's geometry is more specifically a '''right [[rhombic prism]]'''.\n: [[File:Rhombic prism triangles.png|120px]]\n\nThis polyhedron has a highest symmetry as [[Dihedral symmetry|D<sub>2h</sub> symmetry]], order 8, representing 3 orthogonal mirrors. Removing one mirror between the pairs of triangles divides the polyhedron into two identical [[wedge (geometry)|wedges]], giving the names '''octahedral wedge''', or '''double wedge'''. The half-model has 8 triangles and 2 squares.\n:[[File:Tet-oct-wedge.png|160px]]\n\nIt can also be seen as the [[Augmentation (geometry)|augmentation]] of 2 [[octahedron]]s, sharing a common edge, with 2 [[tetrahedron]]s filling in the gaps. This represents a section of a [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]]. The ''elongated octahedron'' can thus be used with the tetrahedron as a space-filling honeycomb.\n:[[File:HC P1-P3.png|240px]]\n\n== See also==\n* [[Bifastigium]]\n* [[Edge-contracted icosahedron]]\n* [[Elongated dodecahedron]]\n* [[Elongated gyrobifastigium]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{The Geometrical Foundation of Natural Structure (book)}} p.172 tetrahedra-octahedral packing\n* [[H.

Since, however, the minimal face ''F''<sub>&minus;1</sub> and the maximal face ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> must be in every flag, they are often omitted from the list of faces, as a shorthand. These latter two are called '''improper''' faces.\n\nFor example, a flag of a polyhedron comprises one vertex, one edge incident to that vertex, and one polygonal face incident to both, plus the two improper faces.\n\nA polytope may be regarded as regular if, and only if, its [[symmetry group]] is [[transitive group action|transitive]] on its flags. This definition excludes [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] polytopes.\n\n==Incidence geometry==\nIn the more abstract setting of [[incidence geometry]], which is a set having a symmetric and reflexive [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] called ''incidence'' defined on its elements, a '''flag''' is a set of elements that are mutually incident.<ref>{{harvnb|Beutelspacher|Rosenbaum|1998|loc=pg. 3}}</ref> This level of abstraction generalizes both the polyhedral concept given above as well as the related [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]] concept from linear algebra.\n\nA flag is ''maximal'' if it is not contained in a larger flag. An incidence geometry (Ω, {{mvar|I}}) has '''rank''' {{mvar|r}} if Ω can be partitioned into sets Ω<sub>1</sub>, Ω<sub>2</sub>, ..., Ω<sub>{{mvar|r}}</sub>, such that each maximal flag of the geometry intersects each of these sets in exactly one element. In this case, the elements of set Ω<sub>{{mvar|j}}</sub> are called elements of '''type {{mvar|j}}'''.\n\nConsequently, in a geometry of rank {{mvar|r}}, each maximal flag has exactly {{mvar|r}} elements.\n\nAn incidence geometry of rank 2 is commonly called an ''incidence structure'' with elements of type 1 called points and elements of type 2 called blocks (or lines in some situations).<ref>{{harvnb|Beutelspacher|Rosenbaum|1998|loc=pg. 5}}</ref> More formally,\n:An incidence structure is a triple '''D''' = (''V'', ''B'', {{mvar|I}}) where ''V'' and ''B'' are any two disjoint sets and {{mvar|I}} is a binary relation between ''V'' and ''B'', that is, {{mvar|I}} ⊆ ''V'' × ''B''.

Bland, ''Solid Mensuration with proofs'', 1938, p.&nbsp;67</ref>\n\nIn [[computer graphics]], the [[viewing frustum]] is the three-dimensional region which is visible on the screen. It is formed by a [[clipping (computer graphics)|clipped]] pyramid; in particular, ''[[frustum culling]]'' is a method of [[hidden surface determination]].\n\nIn the [[aerospace industry]], a frustum is the [[payload fairing|fairing]] between two stages of a [[multistage rocket]] (such as the [[Saturn V]]), which is shaped like a [[truncation (geometry)|truncated]] cone.\n\nIf [[Isotoxal figure|all the edges are forced to be identical]], a frustum becomes a uniform [[prism (geometry)|prism]].\n\n==Elements, special cases, and related concepts==\n[[File:Square frustum.png|thumb|200px|Square frustum]]\n[[File:Triangulated monorectified tetrahedron.png|thumb|200px|A regular [[octahedron]] can be augmented on 3 faces to create a triangular frustum]]\nEach plane section is a floor or base of the frustum. Its axis if any, is that of the original cone or pyramid. A frustum is circular if it has circular bases; it is right if the axis is perpendicular to both bases, and oblique otherwise.\n\nThe height of a frustum is the perpendicular distance between the planes of the two bases.\n\nCones and pyramids can be viewed as degenerate cases of frusta, where one of the cutting planes passes through the [[apex (geometry)|apex]] (so that the corresponding base reduces to a point). The pyramidal frusta are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.\n\nTwo frusta joined at their bases make a [[bifrustum]].\n\n==Formula==\n\n===Volume===\nThe volume formula of a frustum of a square pyramid was introduced by the ancient [[Egyptian mathematics]] in what is called the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]], written in the [[13th dynasty]] (ca. 1850 BC):\n:<math>V = \\frac{1}{3} h(a^2 + a b +b^2).</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are the base and top side lengths of the truncated pyramid, and ''h'' is the height.\nThe Egyptians knew the correct formula for obtaining the volume of a truncated square pyramid, but no proof of this equation is given in the Moscow papyrus.\n\nThe [[volume]] of a conical or pyramidal frustum is the volume of the solid before slicing the apex off, minus the volume of the apex:\n:<math>V = \\frac{h_1 B_1 - h_2 B_2}{3}</math>\nwhere ''B''<sub>1</sub> is the area of one base, ''B''<sub>2</sub> is the area of the other base, and ''h''<sub>1</sub>, ''h''<sub>2</sub> are the perpendicular heights from the apex to the planes of the two bases.\n\nConsidering that\n:<math>\\frac{B_1}{h_1^2}=\\frac{B_2}{h_2^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{B_1 B_2}}{h_1 h_2} = \\alpha</math>,\nthe formula for the volume can be expressed as a product of this proportionality α/3 and a [[Factorization#Sum.2Fdifference of two cubes|difference of cubes]] of heights ''h''<sub>1</sub> and ''h''<sub>2</sub> only.\n:<math>V = \\frac{h_1 \\alpha h_1^2 - h_2 \\alpha h_2^2}{3} = \\frac{\\alpha}{3}(h_1^3 - h_2^3)</math>\n\nBy factoring the difference of two cubes ( a<sup>3</sup> − b<sup>3</sup> = (a-b)(a<sup>2</sup> + ab + b<sup>2</sup>) ) one gets ''h''<sub>1</sub>−''h''<sub>2</sub> = ''h'', the height of the frustum, and α(''h''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''h''<sub>1</sub>''h''<sub>2</sub> + ''h''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)/3.\n\nDistributing α and substituting from its definition, the [[Heronian mean]] of areas ''B''<sub>1</sub> and ''B''<sub>2</sub> is obtained. The alternative formula is therefore\n:<math>V = \\frac{h}{3}(B_1+\\sqrt{B_1 B_2}+B_2)</math>.\n[[Heron of Alexandria]] is noted for deriving this formula and with it encountering the [[imaginary number]], the square root of negative one.<ref>Nahin, Paul. ''An Imaginary Tale: The story of {{sqrt|−1}}.'' Princeton University Press. 1998</ref>\n\nIn particular, the volume of a circular cone frustum is \n:<math>V = \\frac{\\pi h}{3}(r_1^2+r_1 r_2+r_2^2)</math>\nwhere [[pi|''π'']] is 3.14159265..., and ''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub> are the [[Radius (geometry)|radii]] of the two bases.\n\n[[Image:Frustum with symbols.svg|right|miniatur|x200px|Pyramidal frustum]]\nThe volume of a pyramidal frustum whose bases are ''n''-sided regular polygons is\n:<math>V= \\frac{n h}{12} (a_1^2+a_1a_2+a_2^2)\\cot \\frac{\\pi}{n}</math>\nwhere ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub> are the sides of the two bases.\n\n===Surface area===\n[[File:CroppedCone.svg|thumb|Conical frustum]]\nFor a right circular conical frustum<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathwords.com/f/frustum.htm |title=Mathwords.com: Frustum |access-date=17 July 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10407782.2017.1372670 Ahmed T.

In geodesic dome terminology, this is the \"breakdown structure\" or \"principal polyhedral triangle\" (PPT). The 4-regular case uses the square lattice over the [[Gaussian integers]], and the 3-regular case uses triangular lattice over the [[Eisenstein integers]]. For convenience, an alternate parameterization of the Eisenstein integers is used, based on the sixth root of unity instead of the third.{{efn|This simplifies the definition of the equivalence class, makes the class definition the same for 3- and 4-regular graphs, and corresponds with the parameterization traditionally used for geodesic domes and Goldberg polyhedra.}} The usual definition of Eisenstein integers uses the element <math display=\"inline\">\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-1 + i\\sqrt{3}\\right) = e^{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi i} = u - 1</math>.  A norm, <math>t(k, \\ell)</math>, is defined as the square of the absolute value of the complex number. For 3-regular graphs this norm is the [[Capsid#Triangulation number (T-number)|T-number or triangulation number]] used in virology.\n\nThe master polygon is an equilateral triangle or square laid over the lattice. The table to the right gives formulas for the vertices of the master polygons in the complex plane, and the gallery below shows the (3,2) master triangle and square. So that the polygon can be described by a single complex number, one vertex is fixed at 0. There are multiple numbers that can describe the same polygon: these are [[Integral domain#Divisibility, prime and irreducible elements|associate]]s of each other: if <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are associates, then <math>x=u^n y</math> in the Eisensteins or <math>x=i^n y</math> in the Gaussians for some integer <math>n</math>. The set of elements that are associates of each other is an [[equivalence class]], and the element of each equivalence class that has <math>a>0</math> and <math>b\\ge0</math> is the [[Normal form (mathematics)|normal form]].\n<gallery widths=400 heights=400>\nFile:Breakdown 3 2 tri.svg|(3,2) master triangle over triangular grid\nFile:Subdivided square 3 2 with explanation.svg|(3,2) master square over square grid\n</gallery>\n\nMaster polygons, and the operator <math>GC_{k,\\ell}\\left(G_0\\right)</math>, can be classified as follows:\n* Class I: <math>\\ell = 0.</math>\n* Class II: <math>k = \\ell.</math>\n* Class III: all other.

If and only if <math>GC_{a,b}\\left(GC_{c,d}\\left(G_0\\right)\\right) = GC_{e,f}\\left(G_0\\right)</math> (i.e. the series of operations on the left produces a graph isomorphic to the one on the right), then for a 3-regular graph <math>(a + bu)(c + du)</math> is in the equivalence class of <math>(e + fu)</math>, and for a 4-regular graph <math>(a + bi)(c + di)</math> is in the equivalence class of <math>(e + fi)</math>. There are some useful consequences of this:\n* The application of repeated Goldberg–Coxeter operations is [[commutative]] and [[associative]].\n* Complex conjugation of the element <math>a + bi</math> or <math>a + bu</math> corresponds to reflection of the constructed graph.\n* Since the Gaussian integers and Euclidean integers are both [[Euclidean domain]]s, elements of those domains can be uniquely factored into prime elements. Therefore, it also makes sense to decompose a Goldberg–Coxeter operator into a sequence of \"prime\" Goldberg–Coxeter operators, and this sequence is unique (up to rearrangement).\n\n===Performing the GC construction===\nThe steps of performing the GC construction <math>GC_{k,\\ell}(G_0)</math>are as follows:\n# Determine the master polygon, based on <math>k</math>, <math>\\ell</math>, and <math>G_0</math>\n# If operating on a 3- or 4-regular graph (instead of a graph with triangular/quadrilateral faces), take its [[dual graph]]. This dual graph will have triangular or quadrilateral faces.\n# Replace the faces of the triangulated/quadrangulated graph with the master polygon. Be aware that planar graphs have an \"external\" face that must be replaced as well. In the below example, this is done by attaching it to one side of the graph and connecting other sides as necessary. This temporarily introduces overlapping edges into the graph, but the resulting graph is planar. The vertices can be rearranged so that there are no overlapping edges.\n# If the original graph was a 3- or 4-regular graph, take the dual of the result of step 3. Otherwise, the result of step 3 is the GC construction.\n\nBelow is an example, where <math>GC_{1,1}(G_0)</math> is constructed on the [[n-skeleton|skeleton]] of a [[cube]]. In the last two graphs, blue lines are edges of <math>G_0</math>, while black lines are edges of <math>GC_{1,1}(G_0)</math>. (Dotted lines are normal graph edges, just drawn differently to make overlapping graph edges more visible.) Red vertices are in <math>G_0</math> and remain in <math>GC_{1,1}(G_0)</math>, while blue vertices are newly created by the construction and are only in <math>GC_{1,1}(G_0)</math>.\n<gallery widths=200 heights=200>File:Subdivided square 01 01.svg|Master square (1,1)\nFile:Hexahedron.svg|Starting polyhedron (Cube)\nFile:Cube skeleton.svg|<math>G_0</math>, the skeleton of the cube\nFile:GC_1,1_Cube_faces.svg|Intermediate step of constructing <math>GC_{1,1}(G_0)</math>. \nFile:Rhombic_dodecahedron_skeleton.svg|The result <math>GC_{1,1}(G_0)</math>, after rearrangement\nFile:Rhombicdodecahedron.jpg|Embedding of the result ([[rhombic dodecahedron]])</gallery>\n\n==Extensions==\nThe Goldberg–Coxeter construction can be easily extended to some non-planar graphs, such as [[toroidal graph]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10910-016-0706-8|title=Lego-like spheres and tori|journal=Journal of Mathematical Chemistry|volume=55|issue=3|pages=752|year=2016|last1=Deza|first1=Michel-Marie|last2=Sikirić|first2=Mathieu Dutour}}</ref> Class III operators, because of their chirality, require a graph that can be [[graph embedding|embedded]] on an [[orientable surface]], but class I and II operators can be used on non-orientable graphs.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Geodesic grid]]\n*[[Quadrilateralized spherical cube]]\n*[[Loop subdivision surface]]\n*[[Catmull–Clark subdivision surface]]\n*[[Conway polyhedron notation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goldberg-Coxeter construction}}\n[[Category:Graph operations]]\n[[Category:Polyhedra]]"

      "text": "[[File:Coxeter-Dynkin 3-space groups.png|480px|thumb|For Euclidean 3-space, there are 3 simple and related Goursat tetrahedra, represented by [4,3,4], [4,3<sup>1,1</sup>], and [3<sup>[4]</sup>]. They can be seen inside as points on and within a cube, {4,3}.]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''Goursat tetrahedron''' is a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] [[fundamental domain]] of a [[Wythoff construction]]. Each tetrahedral face represents a reflection hyperplane on 3-dimensional surfaces: the [[3-sphere]], the Euclidean 3-space, and hyperbolic 3-space. [[Coxeter]] named them after [[Édouard Goursat]] who first looked into these domains. It is an extension of the theory of [[Schwarz triangle]]s for Wythoff constructions on the sphere.\n\n==Graphical representation==\nA '''Goursat tetrahedron''' can be represented graphically by a tetrahedral graph, which is in a dual configuration of the fundamental domain tetrahedron. In the graph, each node represents a face (mirror) of the Goursat tetrahedron. Each edge is labeled by a rational value corresponding to the reflection order, being π/[[dihedral angle]].\n:[[File:General Goursat tetrahedron.png|100px]]\n\nA 4-node [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] represents this tetrahedral graphs with order-2 edges hidden. If many edges are order 2, the [[Coxeter group]] can be represented by a [[Coxeter notation|bracket notation]].\n\nExistence requires each of the 3-node subgraphs of this graph, (p q r), (p u s), (q t u), and (r s t), must correspond to a [[Schwarz triangle]].\n\n== Extended symmetry ==\n{| class=wikitable align=right width=600\n|[[File:Tetrahedral subgroup tree.png|360px]]\n|[[File:Tetrahedron symmetry tree.png|240px]]\n|-\n|colspan=2|The symmetry of a Goursat tetrahedron can be [[tetrahedral symmetry]] of any subgroup symmetry shown in this tree, with subgroups below with subgroup indices labeled in the colored edges.\n|}\n\nAn extended symmetry of the Goursat tetrahedron is a [[semidirect product]] of the [[Coxeter group]] symmetry and the [[fundamental domain]] symmetry (the Goursat tetrahedron in these cases). [[Coxeter notation]] supports this symmetry as double-brackets like [Y[X]] means full Coxeter group symmetry [X], with '''Y''' as a symmetry of the Goursat tetrahedron. If '''Y''' is a pure reflective symmetry, the group will represent another Coxeter group of mirrors. If there is only one simple doubling symmetry, '''Y''' can be implicit like <nowiki>[[</nowiki>X]] with either reflectional or rotational symmetry depending on the context.\n\nThe extended symmetry of each Goursat tetrahedron is also given below. The highest possible symmetry is that of the regular [[tetrahedron]] as [3,3], and this occurs in the prismatic point group [2,2,2] or [2<sup>[3,3]</sup>] and the paracompact hyperbolic group [3<sup>[3,3]</sup>].\n\nSee [[Tetrahedron#Isometries of irregular tetrahedra]] for 7 lower symmetry isometries of the tetrahedron.\n\n==Whole number solutions==\nThe following sections show all of the whole number Goursat tetrahedral solutions on the 3-sphere, Euclidean 3-space, and Hyperbolic 3-space. The extended symmetry of each tetrahedron is also given.\n\nThe colored tetrahedal diagrams below are [[vertex figure]]s for [[Omnitruncation|omnitruncated]] polytopes and honeycombs from each symmetry family. The edge labels represent polygonal face orders, which is double the Coxeter graph branch order. The [[dihedral angle]] of an edge labeled ''2n'' is π/''n''. Yellow edges labeled 4 come from right angle (unconnected) mirror nodes in the Coxeter diagram.\n\n===3-sphere (finite) solutions===\n[[File:Coxeter diagram finite rank4

There are numerous topologically distinct forms of a hendecahedron, for example the [[decagonal pyramid]], and [[enneagonal prism]].\n\nThree forms are [[Johnson solid]]s: [[augmented hexagonal prism]], [[biaugmented triangular prism]], and [[elongated pentagonal pyramid]].\n\nTwo classes, the bisymmetric and the sphenoid hendecahedra, are [[Space-filling polyhedron|space-filling]].<ref name=Inch1996>Inchbald (1996)</ref>\n\n== Name of hendecahedron ==\nThe name of hendecahedron is based on its meaning. Hen- represents one. Deca represents ten, and when combined with the polyhedron suffix -hedron, the name becomes Hendecahedron.\n\n== Common Hendecahedron ==\nIn all the convex hendecahedrons, there are a total of 440,564 convex ones with distinct differences in topology. There are significant differences in the structure of topology, which means two types of polyhedrons cannot be transformed by moving vertex positions, twisting, or scaling, such as a pentagonal pyramid and a nine diagonal column. They can't change with each other, so their topology structure is different. But the pentagonal prism and enneagonal prism can interchange by stretching out or drawing back one of the nine sides of the scale, so the triangulum prism and the triangulum pyramid have no obvious difference in topology.\n\nThe common hendecahedrons are cones, cylinders, some Jason polyhedrons, and the semi-regular polyhedron. The semi-regular polyhedron here is not the Archimedean solid, but the enneagonal prism.\n\nOther hendecahedrons include enneagonal prism, Spherical octagonal pyramid, two side taper triangular prism of the duality of six, side cone Angle and bisymmetric hendecahedron, which can close shop space.\n\n== Bisymmetric Hendecahedron ==\nThe Bisymmetric Hendecahedron is a [[space-filling polyhedron]] which can be assembled into layers of interpenetrating \"boat-shaped\" tetramers, which in turn are then stacked to fill space; it is hence a three-dimensional analogue of the [[Cairo pentagonal tiling|Cairo pentagon]].\n[[File:Net of Bisymmetric Hendecahedron.svg|thumb|Net of Bisymmetric Hendecahedron]]\n\n== Sphenoid Hendecahedron ==\nThe Sphenoid Hendecahedron is a [[space-filling polyhedron]] which can be assembled into layers of the [[Snub trihexagonal tiling#Floret_pentagonal_tiling|Floret tiling]], which in turn are stacked to fill space.\n\n== Hendecahedron in Chemistry ==\nIn the chemistry, after removing all 18 sides in borane hydrogen ions ([B<sub>11</sub>H<sub>11</sub>]), it is an Octadecahedron. If making a perpendicular to the center of gravity to the surface of a boron atom, a new polyhedron is constructed, which is 18 surface structures of the dual polyhedron, also one of hendecahedrons.\n\n==Convex==\nThere are 440,564 topologically distinct ''convex'' hendecahedra, excluding mirror images, having at least 8 vertices.<ref>[http://www.numericana.com/data/polycount.htm Counting polyhedra]</ref> (Two polyhedra are \"topologically distinct\" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Thomas H.
